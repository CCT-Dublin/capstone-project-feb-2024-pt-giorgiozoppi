231,City centre convenient,"A Chocolatier’s Stay at the Leonardo Hotel, Parnell Street, Dublin

During my recent trip to Dublin, I stayed at the Leonardo Hotel on Parnell Street—a perfect base for my explorations, including a visit to the Guinness Storehouse. Located right in the heart of the city, the hotel provided a comfortable and modern retreat with all the amenities I needed to unwind after a day immersed in Dublin’s rich flavours and history.

From the moment I arrived, the Leonardo Hotel made me feel welcome. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, and the check-in process was smooth. My room was spacious and thoughtfully designed, with a focus on comfort. After a busy day sampling stouts and chocolate pairings, it was the ideal spot to relax, featuring a cosy bed, well-appointed bathroom, and a seating area where I could reflect on my day and jot down ideas inspired by my visit.

The hotel’s location was excellent, offering easy access to both the Guinness Storehouse and Dublin’s vibrant centre. Parnell Street is close to a variety of cafes, restaurants, and cultural landmarks, allowing me to enjoy the city’s atmosphere as I strolled to different spots. Returning to the Leonardo each evening felt like a welcome escape, with its contemporary décor and peaceful environment.

Breakfast at the hotel was another highlight. As a chef, I’m always keen to see what’s on offer, and the Leonardo didn’t disappoint. The buffet featured fresh, local ingredients with a great selection of hot and cold options, setting me up nicely for a day of tasting and exploring.

My stay at the Leonardo Hotel, combined with my visit to the Guinness Storehouse, was a memorable experience. Dublin has a unique charm, and the Leonardo Hotel added to it, giving me the ideal mix of convenience, comfort, and hospitality. For anyone visiting Dublin, especially for culinary adventures, I’d highly recommend the Leonardo as a welcoming place to rest, recharge, and enjoy the city to the fullest.",4,2024,10,15
231,Excellent location for Dublin town centre and temple bar,"Hotel is brilliantly located. Short walk to Temple Bar and O’Connell Street. Airport bus stops on O’Connell Street just around the corner. Luggage area meant we could leave our bags after check-out and roam Dublin bag free before our return flight. Hotel smells amazing as soon as you walk in. Tea/coffee and water available in the foyer. Breakfast was great, fantastic choice of food. The bar was also gorgeous. The room was so modern, trendy and spotless, lovely bathroom with great shower. Definitely would return here.",5,2024,10,07
231,Worse hotel experience,"The manager is the worse and most annoying hotel resectionist you’ll meet to date, you’ll see him with his bald head and white shirt. He’s rude and very proactive and made me actually leave my hotel willingly in the middle of the night because he wouldn’t let my girlfriend stay with me just because one of my boys came up to my room first to charge their phone and leave which was 6 hours ago before she came at night, there’s cleaner and nicer hotels with friendly staff around Dublin id recommend avoiding this one",1,2024,10,02
231,Superb location but...,"This hotel is in a great location. It is just around the corner from where the buses from the airport stop and where the hop on hop off tour buses pick up. It's also on a tram route if you don't fancy the short walk to the river and Temple Bar area. The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. Breakfast was tasty with a good choice but there may be a queue if you arrive for your breakfast at the same time as a tour group. We ate in the hotel on our first evening. The restaurant was closed for a tour group but we were able to eat in the bar (from the same menu) and the staff were very apologetic about the delay. The food was absolutely fine when it arrived. Our issues started when we checked in and whilst we got the upgrade we requested online, we were not given the accompanying vouchers for free drinks and 20% of food. This was resolved by the bar staff who took it upon themselves to go down to reception and retrieve said vouchers. We thought that was us sorted. Unfortunately, that we had an upgrade that included mineral water, snacks ad a daily paper - was not communicated from reception to housekeeping. Twice we had to ask for our goodies (that we had paid for) We did get a lovely apology and some delicious chocolates from housekeeping (thank you!) But if you go for an online upgrade do check at reception on check in that everyone knows you have this. Apart from this I would give this hotel and I would use again next time we are visiting my daughter. ",3,2024,09,26
231,Carol in Dublin,"Great location, very central. Some disappointing uncomfortable experiences during our last breakfast with the unfriendly rather rude staff 17-09-2024! However Valentine the french lady at reception was the star during our stay. She was humble, friendly and accommodating. Also special thanks/praise to Reina on the 2nd floor restaurant/bar. gr room 551!",3,2024,09,22
231,Great location in city centre,"The hotel itself it very central, just off O'Connell Street.  It is also around the corner from Henry Street, so it is ideal for shopping.  
Our room was lovely and clean.  Very big shower.  We only stayed one night, but the room had everything needed.  
We did not eat in the hotel, but the bar menu looked lovely.  
Very good value for money.",5,2024,09,03
231,Fantastic,"Brilliant hotel with brilliant team of people.  The rooms were spotless, greeted us with fresh cookies and glasses of bubbles as we checked in.  Lovely touches but the staff are stand out at this hotel,  so friendly and so lovely,  check in,  housekeeping,  bar staff just delightful.  Breakfast was delicious! ",5,2024,09,02
231,Clean and polite hotel,Although we had been moved here due to our other hotel being double booked this Hotel was lovely and clean breakfast was spot on easy check in and out all the staff was friendly and polite great location with a good old fashioned pub (Parnell) within a 2 minute walk,5,2024,09,01
231,One person ruined our stay . Adrian,Although the room was nice and majority or staff were welcoming and helpful there was one person who made me and my partners night terrible. Adrian who stated he is a nightshift manager grilled myself and my partner about our stay and if we were both booked into the room. The sheet clearly stated 2 people and he was stating because her name wasn’t on the sheet that we should have to pay an additional €30. Even when he was shown the booking had 2 persons he challenged as I didn’t write her name on the check in sheet. Visibly frustrated by this he continued to be obnoxious and rude. Using the line if you don't like it then go somewhere else. If this is the type of behaviour from a manager then it’s truly appalling. This is enough for me and my partner to never go back to this hotel again. He is a vile person,1,2024,08,27
231,"Lovely hotel, great location","The hotel has been renovated to a high standard, really clean spacious modern bedrooms, plenty of plug sockets and storage for a short stay. 
Only downside is there’s nowhere to hang your towels after a shower other than the bathroom door but if there’s 2 or more of you in the room it’s not ideal. 
The beds in our and our groups opinion really really uncomfortable. 
Friendly staff, vending and ice machines available in the corridors. Aircon in the rooms. 
The hotel is in a great central location and easy to walk everywhere.",4,2024,08,24
231,Great hotel,"Great location, beautiful hotel and smells gorgeous! The rooms are all newly refurbished and are really lovely. The air con wasn’t the best but luckily the weather wasn’t particularly hot when we stayed. Breakfast was good but if you go later be prepared to miss out on the muffins and white bread! The reception staff are exceptionally helpful!
Mind the numerous drunks lying in the surrounding streets, constantly asked for money.",4,2024,08,23
231,"Great location and rooms, staff not so great.","Good things first...Location is excellent.  Feels very central and can walk just about anywhere or easily hop on a bus.  Room was very clean, exactly as shown in their advertisements.  Breakfast buffet was very good and worth the money.  The down side of this hotel was the staff.  The front desk was not very helpful or knowledgeable, even about their own hotel.  Couldn't get any change at front desk, then the bar only accepts cards and no cash.  Bar staff was nice but struggled with communication and there was no checking to see how you were with your meal, need another drink, etc.  Felt that they socialized more than served the customer.  So as long as you are good with your room and location and don't need the staff, they are good.  They could really work on their customer service.  There are a lot of hotels to choose from and if they improved this, they would be 5 stars!",3,2024,08,20
231,Excellent stay,"Location wise the hotel is excellent - close to all bus routes and nice cafes and shops.
We had a pleasant 4 night stays at Leonardo Parnell. Room was clean, we had a nice view and the best of all was Valentina, the front desk staff who did her best to make our stay lovely.",4,2024,08,19
231,Congratulations on the facilities and especially for the treatment of your employees.,"For the attention of the Manager of the Leonardo Hotel, Parnell St. Dublin.

Good afternoon. My name is Fernando de Pando and last week I was staying at his hotel. I wanted to congratulate you on the services provided, room, dining room, rooms and other hotel services. Everything was perfect. Especially my family and I wanted to congratulate him for the magnificent treatment that two girls at his hotel reception gave us, always attentive and friendly. I don't know their names but I know that they are Spanish and that one of them was from the province of Jaén and the other from Burgos. They were very kind to us and I wanted you to convey our gratitude to them.
In the future we intend to return to Dublin and we will not hesitate to stay at your hotel both for its facilities and for the quality of its employees.

Yours sincerely.

Fernando de Pando Torrejón.-",5,2024,07,24
231,Poor experience,"Only had an okay experience. We arrived early and our room was not ready. Staff member at reception told us we would receive a phone call when our room was ready. We never did. We stayed in this hotel with another group of 2. The couple we travelled with were told upon check in that they had free checkout until 3pm. When we found this out, we also rang down and asked if we could receive the same free checkout as we would have to wait around for this couple to checkout. We were told this was no problem. The following morning, the cleaning staff were knocking on our door @9am which woke us up, even though we were checking out this day. Usually staff wait until you are checked out to clean the room? As we were now awake we decided to head out for an hour or two and checked to see if the late checkout was still okay. A different member of staff told us this was not possible even though we had already got the all clear the night previous. There is no communication between staff. Would not return.",2,2024,07,24
231,Inadequate facilities for the money ,"I recently stayed at your hotel and would like to express my dissatisfaction with my experience. Although the hotel was very clean, several issues significantly impacted my stay.

First, the heat in the room was unbearable. When booking, I specifically chose a room with air conditioning, but it did not work on the first night. When I called for assistance, the facilities staff brought a fan and mentioned they didn’t know how to fix the air conditioning, nor were there any available rooms to move to. The second day, I complained again and received the same response: ""We don’t know how to fix it, but here is another fan."" 

The room was much hotter than the hallway, and the window did not open wide enough to allow proper airflow. Furthermore, the TV only had five working channels, and the staff seemed generally clueless about resolving these issues. 

Given the price I paid, I am extremely unhappy with the facilities. At the very least, there should have been cold water in the fridge. By contrast, I booked into a Premier Inn at half the cost, which provided a much more comfortable bed, functional air conditioning, and cold water in the fridge.

The only positive aspect of my stay was that your staff stored our bags until we could check in at the Premier Inn.

Due to these issues and the high cost, I will not be returning to your hotel. ",1,2024,07,23
231,"Nice stay, great location","First time at this hotel while in Dublin.
Great location for what we need it for. Room was clean and done to a high standard. Bar Lounge was a little soulless, but it was during the day since we arrived early for our room.
Reception team was friendly and helpful, think they could do with a system with holding luggage, they give you a ticket but then have no idea where they put them once they open the luggage room. So, you can to locate them yourself, and it’s hard when it’s full and other luggage in front of your bags.
We opted for room only, so can’t comment on breakfast. 
Would stay again",4,2024,07,23
231,Best in the city center,This modern hotel is right in the center of Dublin where virtually all the sites of consequence are within a 30 minute walk or a 10 minute cab ride. Rooms are well-situated with very comfy beds and sheets. Sol and Zulema from the front desk performed efficient check-ins and check-outs  to welcome and send off guests. They both made our stay better than Dublin’s drizzly summer.,5,2024,07,20
231,Jobs worth night manager a,"This hotel is lovely, however they have employed an over officious night manager. This man harasses guests as they return to the hotel and asks who they are. Has he ever stayed at a hotel himself? Does he think he works for the state? Why does he think he has the right the harass customers with key cards? He threatens to evict guests in the early hour of the morning if they do not identify themselves. Leonardo Parnell would do well to dispense of this particular individual as quickly as possible or seek a serious level of retraining. I understand finding staff for less desirable timings can be a challenge but nothing would be worse than this.",1,2024,07,14
231,Dublin City Centre Gem Of A Hotel,"We stayed at this beautiful hotel recently.  Parking couldn't be easier at the nearby car park which offers reduced rated for guests.  What struck us immediately on entering the hotel was a welcoming staff member in the lobby. The helpfulness and friendliness of every staff member we encountered was a lovely feature throughout our stay. The room was beautifully appointed, with the largest shower we have seen in any hotel. Beds really comfortable and good quality bed linen. There is a very extensive room service menu compared to the usual limited fare. Location us perfect, right next to O'Connell Street, Dublins' main thoroughfare. The quality of the buffet breakfast was excellent with freshly chopped fruit, an array of cereals, excellent hot buffet , and a very good selection of coffees. Over all a wonderful stay.",5,2024,07,08
231,Dublin stay,"We were given an upgrade which was a great surprise. Rooms lovely ,clean . Staff very friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast delicious with plenty of choices.  Hotel only accepts cash which is a shame as I would like to have the option. Location is excellent as it's in the city a few yards away from o Connell street and Henry street with lots of shops.",5,2024,07,05
231,A hotel at the heart of Dublin,"We arrived early and our rooms were not ready so the hotel staff stored our bags securely so we could wonder around the city. Check-in was quick and easy and staff very friendly. We are-booked breakfast for the next morning as we checked in with no problems. The room was large, clean and cosy with a nice big bed and large screen television as well as a nice clean bathroom. We slept well and had no problems with noise. There was plenty of choice at breakfast the next morning and check out was quick and hassle free. I would use this hotel again on future trips to Dublin. It exceeded our expectations.",5,2024,06,25
231,"Not good value, poor customer service","A terrible mistake of a booking. We got here and the room’s windows were open, which we found odd. We quickly found that the AC was broken - at the height of summer. We were given a fan, which helped very little. They refused our request to change rooms as they were too busy (at £150 a night!). Their last resort was to offer…water. Breakfast was OK but not spectacular, the room was very clean, which was a positive. Uncomfortable bed, very hot room, bad customer service. The basics at this hotel are wrong, My advice - avoid. I’d not stay again.",1,2024,06,25
231,Horrible Hotel ,"Horrible Hotel!  Never have I ever written a review while still at the hotel but I feel obligated to fellow travelers to warn them stay away from this place! 
Checked in on Sunday to what looked like a Motel 6 room, but we were early arriving, this room was ready, we were very tired and knew we would not be spending much time in it so we let it go.  
Mon night a/c not working, called front desk, someone came up but couldn't fix it, offered us a fan until it could be fixed in the am. Not that hot so we declined the fan offer. About half hour later we hear a loud whaling sound, realized it was the toilet, flushed it but noise did not stop. Called down again, had to move all our  stuff to another room at 11:30 pm.   
Out all day on Tues, come back and had no service to our room, not a big deal, we called for towels since we got no fresh ones + we already were short on towels.  Turned a/c on and again not working.  Go down to the front desk to talk to a manager, nothing she can do tonight except offer us free bkfst tomorrow and a drink whenever we want and will move us to a new room on Wed. They have no open rooms to move us to tonight.  
We stayed at a Leonardo hotel in Glasgow RIGHT before this stay and there is no comparison.  This hotel is being remodeled and while I understand that, we did pay to stay at what was advertised as a 4 star hotel.  This is FALSE ADVERTISING to say the least, this hotel is not even 1 star!!!!   Hearing lots of complaints while walking thru the lobby of keys not working and we had the same problem 2x.  
I'm hesitant to post this since the rest of our stay is questionable at this point but it can't get worse (I hope???) and  I truly feel that I need to stop anyone else from making the same mistake I did - stay anywhere else!!  
",1,2024,06,11
231,"Cannot Recommend, bad customer service","I don’t like, and rarely write, bad reviews.  Things do go wrong for all the best intentions, so I believe to forgive and forget the isolated incident.  It is when I see a basic systemic problem that I feel I should pass on my views to others as a precaution.  Basically, this is a cold, run down and unfriendly place that is lacking in fundamental customer service.
Leonardo Hotel, formerly the Jurys Inn, is in transition.  What ever Irish charm that may existed in the past is gone.  The management is abusive to their employees (and us customers) for the most part.  I witnessed three examples of harsh criticism, which, in my opinion, were uncalled for.  (Praise in public, criticize in private).  In one case a new bartender was learning his closeup duties from a positive female cook.   She then left and in walked a few ‘back office’ managers.  They demanded free drinks and when he asked how to account for them, he was verbally attacked and threatened with his new job.  
My room was old and fairly dated.  The carpet was stained, and the bathroom had mold (I got a bad cold).  The window faced a large recycling garbage area.  When I opened the window, I got a strong garbage aroma!  Unfortunately, since the room reeked and the ventilation was poor, I needed to leave it open.  In the early morning, the noise of the trucks outside the window would wake me up (and I’m a fairly sound sleeper).
The key card that is needed to first to call the lift, and then to use to select the floor, consistently didn’t’ work well, if at all (I had to replace my keys twice).  Technical problems do happen, it is the customer service response that was terrible.  Waiting in line for 14 minutes while a manager was chatting on the phone is unacceptable.
The area around the hotel is fairly seedy with a lot of beggars (drug addicts) and other questionable people.  I met a few young ladies at night and politely declined!  This is certainly not a 4 star hotel and neither is the area.
Besides not liking to write or read bad reviews, I don’t like too long reviews!  In conclusion I cannot recommend this hotel at all this point.  They are in the process of refurbishing many of the rooms (beware of a lot of construction crew wandering the corridors).  Hopefully they will refurbish or replace their local management group and regain the lovely Irish charm of Dublin.",2,2024,05,18
231,Hotel needs refurb,"Sunny day in Dublin.  Had an executive room.  5th floor.  The room was extremely warm.  No air conditioning.  Had to move down to 3rd floor.  Much inferior room.  Staff was very good about accommodating me.   But, no compensation for lesser room offered.   At the rates they are charging they need air conditioning!!!!!",3,2024,05,14
231,Bad booking in experience,"stayed here before and it has been ok, but on my last trip there was booking error (corporate booking) and on having to talk with the desk manager she took a view that she was not interested in my booking error and ordered me to cover my booking with a person credit card....i didnt have any issue here covering the booking with my card but just wanted to ensure i was not paying twice for the room.  Ina any case, she was rude and had bad customer service skills and i will not be going back there.

She put me in a bad mood an otherwise pleasant stay in Dublin.",1,2024,05,09
231,Not a place to stay,"+ location
- the phone in the room was not working
- no shower gel in the bathroom; the bottle was filled with water
- no slippers 
For a 4 stars hotels this is shameful.
All in all, has an old and not renovated vibe and I would not recommend it as it needs a lot of improvements.",1,2024,05,01
231,Very decent hotel,"Excellent hotel right in the heart of Dublin and close to public transport, bus tours and coaches to the airport.  Breakfast was good and all in all we felt the hotel was reasonably priced. Beware of the umbrellas on loan in reception area, if you go over your original 'hire time' they will default you to a £20 payment just to hire an umbrella! (not the hotel's fault obviously).
Beware that bar and toilets are on the second floor and you can't access either without your room key. Caught us out more than once!",4,2024,04,23
231,Not friendly,"Room was ok but backed into a constant noise area. 
Made a complaint about the food and was basically told to F off . As a company we will not use this place again. Won’t let this review go u less I retire more. Exactly why they want u to miss. Shocking",3,2024,04,11
231,Easter competition,"It’s a very complete hotel with everything you can imagine, details everywhere like the plugs it’s not only the UK it’s also USB and USBC, magazines with recommendations on where to go, details for disable people, modern.
Also I will do my guess for the quantity of eggs in the basket: 38!!",5,2024,03,31
231,Stay somewhere else!,"This hotel is ran down, sink faucets that only have extremely hot water, beds are old, hard as rocks. Terrible bed pillows, rude staff and tv and remote do not work. We also stayed at the other Leonardo hotel in Dublin and it was a much better experience than the one on Parnell. Only the 5th floor of the hotel has up to date, comfortable rooms. The rest is old and in bad shape. The walls are so thin you can hear everything going on in near by rooms and in the hallways. Too loud and couldn’t sleep. Stay somewhere else in Dublin, not here!",1,2024,03,31
231,Convenient  hotel,Very well positioned hotel for getting to and from airport and for attractions and bus tours of Dublin. Staff were pleasant and the room was clean and tidy. Breakfast was good with a range of choices. Our room was quiet on 4th floor. Able to store luggage whilst exploring the city.,4,2024,03,26
231,Centrally located and very good size room.,"Very centrally located hotel, close to supermarkets, bus stops and a shopping centre. The hotel room had a very comfortable bed, was of a very good size and the staff were very professional and knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2024,03,25
231,Excellent in so many ways.,One of the most comfortable and spacious rooms I have stayed in. Excellent breakfast with so many choices. Very central location and extremely helpful and professional staff not only on Reception but throughout the hotel. Excellent hotel and very deserving of its four star hotel rating.,5,2024,03,25
231,Great location for a City Break in Dublin,"Exceptionally helpful reception team, NOTHING was any trouble at all. A good bag room too which meant we could just head straight out and explore as opposed to waiting until check in. The room was very comfortable and included ironing board and iron, ample supplies of coffee, tea etc. The inclusive breakfast was fresh with a good selection of continental and traditional food. The only negative were the pillows; way too hard !!!

A very pleasant stay, would happily stay there again.",5,2024,03,24
231,Amazing hotel and amazing stay,"I can't say enough just how good this hotel is!
We were booked for a night's stay, arriving in Dublin at 0900 hours. We went to the hotel and was amazed at how nice and clean the lobby is. It also smelt amazing. We asked if we could drop out bags, and they, of course, said yes, giving us receipts. 
We returned later that afternoon and checking was smooth and quick. The key card to the room is required to operate the lifts. The room was spacious and spotless. As it was my wife's birthday they left balloons a little message and some chocolates. Nice touch and neither of us mentioned it was her birthday, so not too sure how they knew but it was greatly appreciated. 
The shower was amazing. Very big walk in with 2 powerful shower heads. 
The bed was comfy, firm but very comfortable as we're the pillows. Great nights sleep. 
It was very warm but there is air con. 
The only downside was the view which is an internal quad but I didn't come for the view and didn't spend any time looking out. 
Checkout was again smooth and quick and again we left our bags there till the end of the day. 
Personally I think this is in a great location as its a 10 minute walk from the main food and bar area. 
I would 100%stay here again and I would recommend this hotel to absolutely everyone. ",5,2024,03,15
231,Great hotel,"Great hotel and what an amazing manager. Had a fab stay, nice breakfast and really well located. Luggage storage available on the last day which was really helpful. Paul the manager is amazing and great at dealing with any minor issues. What a legend!",5,2024,03,13
231,Great hotel,"Nice hotel, perfect location for transport around the city and to and from Dublin airport. Breakfast was delicious, buffet style and food areas were kept clean and well stocked. Room was comfortable and clean and staff were friendly. Didn’t use the gym or bar.",5,2024,03,11
231,Overall Great hotel minus the pillows.  Clean and all amenities are well kept.,"Very nice hotel, friendly and helpful staff,  the gym is small and has basics. Breakfast has good variety and good cofffee.    Photos show a nespresso in the room but im guessing its only in the suits as there was none in our room.   The keycards are bad, our group had 4 rooms and had to get new keys multiple times a day because they stopped working, (annoying after a long day to have to walk all the corridors and elevator back to get a new key).   The pillows are hard as rock, recommend bringing your own.",5,2024,03,08
231,Awesome location!!,"Awesome location! All the main attractions are walking distance. Felipe checked us in early and gave us a room on the top floor! Also, gave us complimentary tickets to the bar and breakfast how sweet. Room was clean and can’t ask for more!! Can’t wait to walk around Dublin!",5,2024,03,06
231,"Comfortable, Central, Clean, Courteous","From arrival to checkout the Leonardo didn’t disappoint. Check in was quick. Staff were friendly. Hotel was clean & well maintained (some improvements work being carried out but never impacted on our stay). Very central to the north side of Dublin - literally a 5 minute walk into O’Connell St. 
Comfy beds & clean rooms. Contained a full size ironing board & iron. Something you rarely find in hotel rooms. Lots of coat hangers  supplied, storage & drawers for clothes together with a suitcase stand. 
Our only complaint was the key cards to our rooms. Often didn’t work or took several attempts before they worked which became arduous hence my 4 instead of 5 star review. However all in all a very pleasurable 4 night stay. We would return.",4,2024,02,25
231,Not the Best,"I chose to stay here as it was close to the centre and the reviews were ok. Plus it was close to a restaurant we wanted to eat at. 

When we checked in I was confused to hear that the restaurant was closed due to being “out of season” The hotel was incredibly busy as was the local area so I found that very bizarre but luckily we weren’t planning on eating there anyway.

When we got to the room my keys didn’t work at all so back down to reception. I wasn’t alone as someone else had the same problem. 

We asked about using the gym and given a key to go. It’s the size of a broom cupboard with one treadmill and one CrossFit with a couple of small weights. The treadmill was not great and a soft platform so after only 20 minutes or so running you can feel your calves tightening. Maybe just a cheap one they bought.

After going out for a nice dinner and a beautiful walk around the area and along the river we headed back. Just as we were trying to get to sleep in the early hours there were multiple people coming back, shouting and banging doors which woke me up but the worst was a couple who for 10 minutes stood outside a door opposite singing, talking and laughing and eventually I lost the plot and went out to the hall to find out  they couldn’t get into their room as their keys didn’t work either so instead of getting it sorted at reception they decided to wake the entire floor. Being grumpy and tired :) I told them maybe not so nicely to keep quiet and go to reception to get it sorted and come back quietly and I actually didn’t hear them come back. Now I know the hotel can’t be directly responsible for these people, however they are indirectly as the room keys are clearly useless. 

The breakfast is actually quite good and plenty of choices but given the poor gym, hopeless keys and a bad nights sleep I would not go back.",3,2024,02,24
231,Great Location,"Great location within walking distance from everything.  Hop On Hop Off just 4 minutes walk to the main stop.  Restaurants, shops, pharmacies, supermarkets all within 2-3 minutes.   Girls at reception were very helpful.  Sorry didn't get their names.  Rooms were spacious, bathroom was big.  Bed and pillows not comfortable at all.  They need update.  Old furniture, the door was too heave to open.  In general the hotel needs a good update.  Carpet in the common area at 2nd floor had a terrible smell.    Breakfast was ok with lots of options.  More variety at colds could be better.  Coffee was ok.  In general we had a great time (due to the location mostly) and because we did not spent that much time in the room, if we ever visit Dublin again most probably will stay here again.",4,2024,02,22
231,Affordable luxury,"Excellent hotel. Really comfortable rooms, newly renovated with a big TV and great shower. Ideal location and a bit of luxury at an affordable price. Great value for money. Antonio on reception was polite and helpful. If I had to make one criticism it is that the bed wasn't made properly. The fitted sheet wasn't exactly fitted properly but only a minor issue.",5,2024,02,21
231,Take of 2 parts,"Modern hotel with great location Rooms big modern with all facilities you need,spotlessly clean  Most import really comfy bed and pillows Bar very relaxed atmosphere prices were very reasonable, breakfast was excellent large selection Staff very friendly and helpful But the bar ran out of Jameson Ps I’m sure I was in Dublin, one night ran out of ice, ran out of lemonade forced to buy those ridiculously priced glass mixer bottles and understaffed only one staff who had other duties serving food etc so often waiting on them returning But everything considered I’d stay again",4,2024,02,21
231,Antonio was great,"Great hotel, Antonio was great and had some fab recommendations with local bars, restaurants and places to visit. Would come back and stay again. 
Lovely breakfast and great location. 
The ability to store bags was also extremely useful. Thank you",4,2024,02,18
231,Dublin Rocks,"First time in Dublin. Wasn't sure where to stay. Very central and staff were lovely and friendly. Busy hotel with clean rooms. Would definitely go back and recommend friends too. 
Funny situation was we didn't know we had to use key card on lifts to go up. Luckily we weren't the only ones. 😀
",5,2024,02,17
231,Great central hotel.,"Super hotel, great location and reasonably priced. The staff were very helpful. Decent hotel bar and although we didn't eat in there the meals looked lovely. 
The beds were some of the comfiest we've slept in. We only stayed for two nights and towels were changed on the second day which was great.
Would definitely stay again next time in Dublin.",5,2024,02,14
231,Very pleased,"Very nice hotel. Staff was very attentive. On-site pub was active, but not loud. Very good food in the restaurant. Comfortable room and bed. Overlooks Christchurch. Everything is well maintained and clean. Saint Patrick's is a 5 minute walk. ",5,2024,02,02
231,Great Location and Price!,"Great location and price - staff seemed a little jaded, but still professional. One really annoying aspect of our stay though - the access cards kept failing to work. Might be proximity to other cards in our pockets causing this, but nevertheless something to address. When I raised the issue, the hotel staff were sharp and efficient in responding. Thanks team, you were good fun. Cleaning staff there were lovely!",3,2024,01,31
231,Great Hotel - Highly Reccomended,"A Really Great Stay at Leonardo Hotel, Parnell St, Dublin.
Very central, Lovely room, brilliant shower, friendly, efficient staff. 
Amazing breakfast & such comfortable beds!
Definitely Reccomended - near EVERYTHING, shops, restaurants & transport...... 
Ive also stayed at the Leonardo Beach front Hotel in Brighton....sooooo nice! 
You won't be disappointed & great value. 
Thanks to all the staff, especially Antonio on Reception, who gave us a warm welcome & answered any questions we had. ( we unfortunately missed him to say goodbye when we left) 
Will definitely keep staying at Leonardo Hotels, can't go wrong.",5,2024,01,30
231,Very happy,"We were really concerned staying here when looking at some of the recent reviews.
We had no reason to.
The hotel is well located, you're an able person 8 - 10 min walk from the main spot (We prefer to just stay outside of the carnage). 
The hotel reception is small and what you need, bearing in mind the restaurant, bar, gym, etc are located on the 2nd floor - no issues for me.
We stayed on the 5th floor.
The hotel was having some work done - it is the quietest part of the year, so when else would they be expected to do it. 
Having said that, the work being done did not impact us negatively in any way. There was some drilling/banging, but none of this was before 11am. 
The room we had was brand new (as a result of having to make improvements!!).
The bed was comfy, the shower was a large walk in shower. 
The heating was good and overall it was very clean. 
We didn't eat in the ge hotel (our opinion is why would you when there are so many places to eat outside the hotel) but the bar was very nice/decor/clean. 
We've stayed in better and certainly worse hotels, however, for our experience and value for money we were very happy.
(We've stayed in some American hotels that are shamed by this one and we disagree that motels are better, we've stayed in some and no they don't even compare).
We often take Trip Advisor reviews with a pinch of salt and glad we did on this occassion.
Overall, I'd recommend the hotel and would be happy to return.",5,2024,01,22
231,"Very nice stay! Hotels very central, room was warm and beds were comfortable! Receptionist Gema was very pleasant! Hotel","Very nice stay! Hotel is in a great location! The beds were comfortable and the room was warm and very clean! Shower was lovely and the bar and restaurant was lovely, compliments to the team and staff and Gema at reception who was very friendly",5,2024,01,18
231,Please stay elsewhere if you want a nice hotel,"This would be a very basic motel in the USA. 
Lobby & rooms & services are definitely not that of even a 1-star hotel. 
No amenities at all, a very ugly lobby, no bellhops or even luggage trolleys…
The breakfasts (extra charges) were just average. Dinner was truly terrible— don’t even think to try their “Gem salad” or the inedible hamburger. 
When there were very long delays checking in at the front desk, a “manager” emerged to berate her staff —and did not offer explanations or apologies for the inconvenience.",1,2024,01,10
231,Room cards don't work & lifts rubbish,"I stayed for 4 nights.  I've stayed in several Leonardo Hotels over the years and they are usually fine, but this one seems to have escaped quality control. The room cards don't work half the time, the lifts are rubbish, and the customer service is poor.  Otherwise the room is ok - though the heating (in Jan) isn't great.",1,2024,01,09
231,Nicely situated hotel in the centre of Dublin,"Lovely comfortable hotel situated centrally in Dublin. Very reasonably priced. Good clean room, nice bar serving decent food. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The rooms are spacious and the bed very comfortable.",5,2024,01,09

Lidl underneath tesco across the rd various eateries nearby  o connell St just around the corner and walking distance to most museums temple bar ect
Nice big clean room we where on 2nd floor same floor as the bar lounge but didn't hear any noise 
Nice breakfast again everything clean and tidy

Will return again. ",4,2024,01,02
231,Great value stay,"The rooms are a good size and very clean,  comfortable and warm with air conditioning that the guest can control. Room facilities are what you would expect. Breakfast buffet in the restaurant sets you up for the day. Reception staff Dongsu and Gemma very friendly and helpful.",4,2023,12,27
231,Noisy with a smile,"Friendly staff, good location, but the world’s smallest beds (absolutely no way did we have a double despite this being what was sold - more like a big single), limited hot water particularly in the mornings, towels you could crack with a hammer and best of all… paper thin walls so you can hear next door at it all night. Bring ear plugs, or perhaps just join in!",3,2023,12,21
231,Disappointed! Some positives though.,"We were booked into this hotel by booking.com after our original hotel double booked us. 
The start to our stay couldn’t have gotten much worse. 
We travelled as a group of 10 ladies for my mums 50th birthday celebration. 
I called previously in the week to request early check in. As we landed at 6am and didn’t want to have to wait around for 9 hours on very little sleep. We were assured this wouldn’t be a problem. 
On arrival we were told that early check in wasn’t available on this day as the hotel was fully booked however Antonio assured us we would be able to check in by lunch. So we went and explored for a few hours before getting a couple of hours sleep. However when we arrived back we were told none of our rooms were ready and that there was only one maid working on this date - which we later found out to be untrue. 
We managed to check in by 1pm so were grateful for that. 
The rooms were tiny with a very basic bathroom. However the breakfast was lovely and the location was spot on.",3,2023,12,21
231,ANTONIO! :),ANTONIO WAS FABULOUS!!!! He is the best Receptionist i have ever encountered! He made our stay perfect. Highly recommend!!!  He deserves a pay rise! Absolutely phenomenal service. Stay at this hotel !!!,5,2023,12,17
231,"Perfect choice for those who’s looking for a reasonable, affordable and best location hotel.","The hotel is ordinary and the building is old but the hotel staff are really kind, helpful and friendly! I’m surprised too  that despite that it’s a very old building, the hotel and rooms are very clean. No musty smell at all.  Their restaurant serves really good food. They have good choices  for  breakfast and the price per person is so reasonable. Location wise, it is right in the middle of downtown. The hotel rate is so reasonable as well. They don’t have their own parking area but they have a recommended parking garage which  they provide a  50 percent discount for their guests. I just hope that they’ll consider to do full renovation of  the building in the future  since they really have potential to succeed. They are situated  in a perfect location!",4,2023,12,16
231,Unexpected perfect location ,Excellent location to walk anywhere.  The hotel is well maintained with all ammenities.  Restaurant is available and there is a bar.  Hotel staff is very friendly.   We were given vouchers for some free drinks.  There is free coffee/tea available.,5,2023,12,15
231,Won't waste anymore of my time.,Would not recommend this hotel.staff do not know what there doing need retraining at the very least.did not get the room I paid for the hotel is a mess.so called premier rooms what a joke.will never ever consider staying here again not even for free.,1,2023,12,14
231,honest review!,"We had a nice night at this hotel. The bed was comfy, the linen & pillows etc also good quality. Everything was clean and in good order. My only moans were the quality of the coffee/tea courtesy tray - they were not at all good. Next moan was the deadheads who were slamming doors at 2.30am but no hotel can stop that, just a shame really. Its location is good for exploring Dublin with good transport links but if you really want to reduce travel times it might be worth staying on the opposite side of the River Liffy and paying a tad more for you hotel.  Warning - Dublin is not at all cheap!!!",4,2023,12,12
231,"Major quality issues, decent professionalism from staff.","We recently visited this hotel for a few nights in the center of Dublin, and sadly we left wanting to not come back any time soon due to issues I am going to address here, where hopefully something will be done about this. The only two positive things I will mention was that the staff are friendly, and that they display a good amount of professionalism, where an issue with my initial booking was dealt with well. The second thing is that around Christmas time, the decorations around the lobby and the restaurant/bar area is done well and looks very nice.

Firstly, the key cards we received from the reception didn’t seem to work at all when trying to put them into the reader to make the lifts work, it was always a 50/50 chance that it might work, and I spent minutes trying out different techniques, where an employee couldn’t figure it out straight away either when he mentioned that they never work properly.

When we got to our room, we were hit with a bland, dirty and cold atmosphere. The first room, the small bathroom, was very dirty, the lamp displays obvious signs of rust and wear, the sink was crammed under a glass shelf, the toilet was on an incline so that when showering, some water got onto the ground it runs to the toilet so while using it you’re pretty much getting your feet or socks etc soaked. In addition there is not even a toilet brush. Furthermore, the shower doesn’t have a shower head, so it is impossible to not get your hair wet unless you perform acrobatics. 

The bed was very thin, and for us two people we barely fit. The bed’s mattress was extremely solid, and even though our welcome letter we found in the room mentioned that it was ‘personalized’ for our comfort, we found none of that and never in our few nights of staying here we slept well, where we always woke up with a lot of back pain. The pillow case one night had small stains on it, which looked like blood, and some other black stains. 

The heating did not work at all, all that came out of the air conditioning was cold air, and when turning it off it didn’t stop, just continued at a slower setting. The room generally did not have good insulation as we were always freezing and had to use the blankets just to stay remotely warm.

The general cleanliness is a large concern for us as not only the bathroom felt dirty, but we also found garbage from a previous guest under our bed, suggesting that nothing is vacuumed at all. 

There is no safe in the room, and not even a closet for our clothes. And there are permanent drilling sounds as there is construction right next to the hotel, so sleeping past 7am or earlier than 9pm is not an option. 

Overall, we would not recommend staying in this hotel. Cleanliness has to be improved, and us just simply feeling “well” in the room was not achieved.",2,2023,12,06
231,Would not recommend!,"Absolute shambles of a hotel. Checked in to see multiple complaints from guests and the staff very unhelpful.

Booked a double room, checked into a single room (having waited 10 minutes to check in)

Took at least 15 minutes to change rooms. 

If I could cancel my stay and move somewhere else for tomorrow night I would!",1,2023,11,27
231,Sol the receptionist is amazing!!!,Shout out to Sol on reception today (27/11). Amazingly professional and friendly and got me checked in answering all my questions. Hope you and the team enjoy the sweets. Thankyou for the lovely welcome to Leonardo Parnell Street 👌👌👌😁😁😁😍😍😍,5,2023,11,27
231,Fantastic hotel..,"Well..what can I say ..I think the couple of previous reviews giving a poor reflection of the hotel are a million miles away from mine and my wife's experience when we stayed for 3 nights from the 19th Nov 23.. we have nothing but great things to say about everything from the cleanliness to the restaurant especially the breakfast also the rooms for comfort ..the staff were all so helpful and friendly and a credit to the hotel...the location is ideal for most of the attractions and only a minutes walk to the main dublin streets...I wish we could have stayed longer and when (not if) we return to visit dublin we will stay here...please take our review before some of the negative ones..we,ve been totally honest and open about our experience..I promise you won't be dissapointed..",5,2023,11,26
231,Horrible Experience with this Hotel Stay,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in November 2023.  On our last nights on 11/17/23, I woke up with fear because someone tried to access our room at about 12:40 am.  I heard several buzzing sounds of someone using the key card to access our room but failed to do so because the door was bolted that night by us.  We let the front desk people know the next morning when we checked out and we were told that one of the hotel staff went to the wrong room.  Really at 12:40 am?  ",2,2023,11,21
231,Horrible hotel ,"This place is a disgrace. Room is dirty,there is no closet space,beds are uncomfortable.
The bathroom is small, dirty,run down and smelled of dead rodents. 
Breakfast was very disappointing. Not much to choose from,the cheese and fruits were old,juts like the pastries..
The staff was really indifferent,no one made the extra mile.
The rooms are very noisy,there were drilling happening each night until 7 pm
",1,2023,11,19
231,Amazing experience,Stay at Leonardo Hotel in Dublin was the best choice. The accommodation was excellent and the hotel’s organization surprised me. I am so thankful to Ricardo for receiving me and my family so well. Very gentle guy. Thanks you all.,5,2023,11,19
231,Convenient location,"Overall a good stay and we would rebook if in Dublin again. It didn't get off to a good start when having just unpacked everything we discovered that the heating in our room was broken. No phone in room either so a long trip to reception. After a bit of back and for and discussion we got upgraded to an Executive room so all was well. This room did not have very good double glazing so was quite noisy being at the front on the main street. The location is excellent, only a short walk to anywhere and the buses were very convenient. TIP! I f travelling from the airport get a number 16 bus, it stops just around the corner and only costs 2.60 euros. If you don't have coins to pay the exact amouont on the bus get a 90 minute bus pass from the convenience store at the airport exit. Staff good. Chipshop and Tesco opposite if you can't be bothered.",3,2023,11,14
231,Castle treatment,Well secure and fully equipped in guests needs. They have plenty of refreshments in reception for tired hungry travellers. There is a bar located on the second floor open for guests to 1.30am and a great selection of bar food and restaurant. There is a well serviced lift and rooms are very clean and airy. ,5,2023,11,11
231,Poor accommodations,Hotel under construction noisy and dirty.  Housekeeping was poor to say the least.  Bar staff made no attempt to accommodate guests.  Not great area. Would recommend finding another hotel south of the river!,2,2023,11,09
231,"Great - Antonio, Conor & Sol","Great location and tidy rooms. Lots of choice at breakfast and nicer bar in the hotel.

And Guinness 😄",5,2023,11,01
231,Great stay,"I had a great stay while I was there. Staff at the front desk were very helpful, rooms were very clean, and food in restaurant was good. My only complaint was my breakfast to go was poor, it cost the same as the meal I would have had in the restaurant and it contained no protein and a lot of sugary items. That could really be improved. Staff Connor and Antonio at the front desk were very helpful going out their way each time I needed something, quite pleasant, efficient and a pleasure to deal with.",5,2023,10,21
231,Excellent staff,"I stayed in two separate occasions on the same trip in this hotel. Each time was a great experience. Rooms are clean, beds are confortable. But more importantly, the staff is amazing. Very professional and kind. At reception Dong Su was always very kind and went the extra mile to make sure my stay was as pleasant as possible. Thank you Dong Su!",5,2023,10,19
231,Front desk people were the best !,"It’s a fair hotel - if you’re looking for an average priced hotel, this is OK.  Safe and clean. It’s in a busy area with cabs always waiting outside (I never went out or came home after 11pm)  Upon check-in I was upset to see that there was no in room refrigerator.  But they held my stuff downstairs. The front desk was so sweet - Antonio, Donysu, Millan & Sharon were there when I checked in & helped me with everything during my stay. They remembered me and were always helpful and respectful. Antonio helped with restaurant reservations and cabs - all of them very sweet. 
Again - decent place to stay for a decent price - good location! ",4,2023,10,15
231,Great two weeks at Leonardo Hotel - Great staff particularly Antonio,"Great 2 Weeks stay at Leonardo Hotel Parnell Street, Staff Exceptional especially Antonio, he was very welcoming, so helpful and always friendly, Anderson, Ricardo & Liam. Lovely Breakfast, Spacious room. Ameties very good overall stay.",5,2023,10,14
231,Poor guest services,I was very disappointed by the staffs behavior today.   I have spent a good deal of money staying here 6 days and was treated poorly by the front desk staff. I was challenged gaining access to the property even with a key card I used to open the door,1,2023,10,14
231,Great venue to conference and stay ,"Stayed once more here for work, the conference facilities are excellent and Karolina looked after us tremendously once more.Millan and Connor on reception were there for anything required and helped facilitate our conferencing seamlessly.",5,2023,10,12
231,Perfect!!!!,"Excellent attention from the entire Leonardo team. Mateo, Ricardo and Sol have helped us with everything, super kind and friendly. They made us feel very comfortable. We recommend 100%!!! Amazing yime in Dublin!!!",5,2023,10,12
231,Good place to,"Antonio, Milan , Sharon
Every one was a big help.
Enjoyed our stay. Go stay Very Helpful place to stay. The only thing is I don't need to leave 200 words minimum to say that I enjoyed the. Breakfast and lunch we're. Conveniently located to many interesting",5,2023,10,12
231,Regular satisfied guest.,"I've been staying once a week for over two years so they must be doing something right. Central location, friendly staff (shout out to Antonio, Sharon and Millan tonight) and (comparatively) reasonable prices - what's not to like.",5,2023,10,11
231,Perfect place in the heart of Dublin.,"Wonderful hotel! After a long travel day, it was a delight to check in to this hotel. The front desk staff, especially Dongsu, were so friendly and welcoming, and the room was great. Very comfortable bed, exceptionally clean and spacious, and so well located just off O’Connell Street and the centre of Dublin. I will stay here again.",5,2023,10,11
231,Leonardo Hotel Parnell Street,We were a family of 4 and had 2 interconnecting rooms that worked really well.  Rooms were clean and hotel overall offered clean and friendly service.  Large breakfast area was clean and food presented well.  Good location and lovely Irish Bar with entertainment close by.   Cons - needed a fridge in the room and the room electronic keys kept not working and you had to constantly go to reception and get them reprogrammed.,4,2023,10,08
231,Great location and accomodation,A lot of famous places and monuments are just walking distance away from this hotel. The bar/restaurant serves great food and stays open until late. The bar itself is also a nice place to sit down and have some drinks. Depending on the availability of the rooms I would stay in this hotel during my next visit to Dublin.,4,2023,09,25
231,"Disgusting customer service! Over charged, still waiting for our refund","We stayed at Parnell street for 2 nights in June 23, 
When I checked in, a new member of staff processed it and charged us in the wrong currency. She apologised and refunded us and then re-charged us. When checking our bank statement when we got home we realised that they had refunded us less than we paid. So are £45 out of pocket. I called the hotel they told me to email customer services, which I  have done  on multiple occasions and now I am being ignored, shocking customer service from a hotel chain!! 
I do not recommend staying here!! ",1,2023,09,25
231,you can walk anywhere,"Perfect location for all areas of Dublin, O'Connell Street directly to the south, with all buses running frequently nearby, the room was ideal, good bathroom and comfortable beds, young lady who served us in the bar late at night, 13th and 14th September was extremely pleasant and efficient, the only downside which is minor, the coffee machines at breakfast were never working simultaneously, which always caused a bit of a queue, buffet was perfectly good and choice was exceptionally varied.",5,2023,09,23
231,Excellent staff and an Excellent stay.,We stayed here for four days and it was wonderful. The staff in particular Mateo Pronzati were super helpful and went above and beyond in making sure we had everything. One of the best hotels we have stayed in and can not find any faults.,5,2023,09,19
231,Comfortable stay,"We stayed at Leonardo for 5 nights during our visit to Dublin.  Our hotel room was a comfortable size with a twin size bed and double bed - and ac during a unusual heat spell in early September!  The room was a bit noisy with a recycle truck yard outside our window, but it wasn’t too much of an issue as we rise early.
Breakfast offered a good variety of options … porridge, yogurt, fruit, cereals, eggs, sausage, breads, etc.
The location made walking to various Dublin easy enough - although in retrospect I would have preferred a location on the other side of the River Liffey as most of the attractions we wanted to see were across the river.
There are plenty of restaurants,  pubs and retail stores within close walking.  We especially enjoyed Kingfisher across the street and The Church Cafe (church converted into a restaurant!).",4,2023,09,19
231,"Excellent, friendly, helpful staff","I needed to confirm some details about our stay, and after a few aborted attempts, was contacted my Muhammad, the Hotel Manager. He sorted them with no problems, so when Chris and I arrived at the hotel, things could not have gone smoother. The only amusing hiccup was that I was down for an accessible room, and Chris had a standard room, when it should have been the other way around. Soon sorted. Waiting was a plate of fancy cakes, well appointed rooms, that had a connecting door between Chris and My Room.
Bathrooms were clean - Chris had a walk in shower room, and I had a bath (bit shallow, but still comfortable).
By the time we were in, it was getting a bit late to wander around, so we elected to eat in the Restaurant - they pointed us to the Bar (which had the same menu)
The menu is not extensive. Chris had the Tomato soup, and Pizza Bread Roll, whilst I had BBQ Chicken wings (on the recommendation of the Barman John(athon?). They were brilliant!. Next I had the rump steak, but that was a bit tough, and Chris's burger was dry.
Breakfasts every day were good - make up a full Irish, Continental, Cereal, Toast, whatever. Very enjoyable, and set us up for days of exploring.
The hotel was able to arrange Taxi's for various things - going to the Railway or the airport, for instance.
All in all, it was a very enjoyable stay, with a friendly staff - John(athon) was an excellent Barman, talking knowledgeably about the drinks behind the bar, and helping us select the right one. All of the front of house staff were helpful and friendly, helping us print out boarding cards, accessing safe deposits - nothing seemed to much for them
I thoroughly recommend this hotel for a central stay in Dublin!",4,2023,09,10
231,Don’t Do It!,"Yuck. Change of ownership did not improve this facility in any way.  It is worse. 4th and last stay. Dublin is worse too. Do not waste your time. Dirty, smelly, loud, and much smaller rooms as the Leonardo. There is nothing Irish about Dublin anymore.",1,2023,09,09
231,"Great location, not a good stay but hopefully refurbishment under Leonardo will improve the comfort.","Hotel and rooms a little tired but they are refurbishing. Staff friendly and approachable for requests. Unfortunately banging from staff area and deliveries under our window (room 244) at all hours of the night caused us to only have one nights sleep out of 6, avoid this room if you value your sleep. ",2,2023,09,05
231,Great reception in city hotel,The reception staff were wonderful especially Suzanne and Anderson. The rooms were very small and felt sterile. The breakfast was good and gluten friendly. Hotel needs updating especially bathrooms. Parking is very far away and difficult to walk to with a lot of luggage. ,3,2023,09,03
231,Weekend away,"Stayed here for 2 nights in July 2023 in order to celebrate our wedding anniversary and also, of course, to see the wonderful sights.

It was situated in the perfect place as it was a short walk to the Big Bus Tour stop 1 which made us visiting sights much easier.

The breakfast is great and they have a large restaurant area so seating is not an issue.

We also ate in their bar restaurant on one evening and there food is very gastro pub style and very tasty.

We will definitely book here again when we visit Dublin again",5,2023,08,31
231,Not worth it - avoid at all costs,Terrible hotel from start to finish. Paying 5 star prices for youth hostel quality. Rooms are tired and lack any comfort or finish and the bathrooms had mold. Save your money and disappointment and book elsewhere.,1,2023,08,30
231,Not worth it ,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights.  We had to pay for the 4 nights upon checkin (just under $1600).  The location is fair in that it is a few blocks from
a shopping area on Henry Street.  The meals (breakfast and dinner) were
acceptable; one has to pay for each on the spot.  The room we stayed in was
poor.  There are no USB outlets and no toilet brush.  The mattresses, beds
and furniture are tired.  A major room update / renovation is needed.  The staff is polite and friendly.
",2,2023,08,30
231,Enjoyable Stay in Dublin,"We arrived at the hotel a couple hours before the 3pm check-in and our bags were placed in a secure room with other luggage. So, we wandered the streets, found a pub (easy to do in Dublin), had a beer and returned to the hotel and it was time for check-in. This event went very smoothly so we took the elvator up to our room. We had reserved an Executive Superking room. The entry door was very heavy for a hotel room - apparently doors to all the rooms are heavy and close with a bang.
The front desk staff  was efficient, responsive and helpful. For security reasons you must use your room key in the elevator to go up - not required to go down.
The hotel is in a nice location, an easy walk to O'Connell St for pubs and restaurants.
Our room had both still and sparkling water provided daily along with bisuits (cookies). We had a mini fridge and in room safe. I was surprised the room was not larger, but it is Europe ! The WIFI worked very well in our room. Housekeeping was meticulous and the the housekeepers were friendly and efficient.
I rate this hotel a 4 star due to the expectation we had for a room larger than what we had.",4,2023,08,27
231,Poor Service and No Redeeming Features,"The hotel is in a rough area there are homeless people roaring at each other on the street. It felt really unsafe. I arrived at reception and was dealt with by the only female receptionist and she was really rude. She kept laughing under her hand while dealing with me. Not a good start. It was £150 euro for our room with no breakfast. It was expensive. The television was impossible to operate. I rang reception about the internet password which we couldn't get to work. Then I rang back about the TV that we couldn't get to work and they would not answer the phone! After 20 minutes we got someone. He said someone would be up to fix the television.We waited an hour. Really poor service and customer care. The hotel is really noisy, doors are banging at all hours of the day and night. Do not stay here. Pillows are really uncomfortable mattress was pretty good but I would not return to this hotel.  Apart from the girl who served us in the bar she was lovely.",1,2023,08,24
231,Amazing staff member 😊,"What a fantastic experience. Such a lovely and clean hotel and their staff are lovely. Especially a lady named Suzanne, we’d like to say a personal thank you for making our anniversary trip evening better with the complementary drinks and discounted food. 
Incredible customer service 

Thank you again 😊",5,2023,08,21
231,Good clean hotel a short walk from Temple Bar,"Very friendly staff when we checked in. Nice and clean hotel. Breakfast is amazing, a lot of choice and lovely warm full English! Highly recommend! Out of the centre so quieter but nice walk in. Definitely stay here again. Just 4/5 as no safe in the room or fridge and the room door handle was a bit wobbly but still locked. Towels and bedding all fresh and nice room. Good hotel security as required room key to use lift.",4,2023,08,20
231,Average Experience ,"Stayed here for 2 nights, was fine for what we needed it for. Front of House/Desk staff were lovely, rooms are ok, however, needs modernising a lot more (compared to their hotels in other locations). For us, felt a bit vulnerable with the location, didn't ""feel safe"" on the street it is located, but I guess that's what you get for a very busy capital city. The reason for dropping a star for staff is due to not having a pleasant experience with the Bar Staff. If you are thinking of paying cash, don't even bother coming here at all. We were hit with the ""No Card Policy"" because of covid - luckily one of us had a card on us just for 3 drinks! We stopped in the Galway location, where they happily accepted cash! Told them this, and they came back with ""because its a metropolitan area"". Unfortunately due this attitude, it put us off coming back into the bar/restaurant area. Unfortunately won't be returning.",3,2023,08,20
231,Worst Hotel Experience EVER,"I usually never write reviews, but feel I must write this one for anyone considering staying in this hotel. The room had stained carpets, the second bed for my daughter & granddaughter was an old pull out sofa with a thin mattress, and the bathroom look liked it had been used hard and wasn't clean. Outside the door that I could barely open was a piece of trash on the floor that on first glance looked like it had blood on it! We immediately check outed after just 15-min -- travel agent booked a refundable 2-night reservation. Cleaning and hotel managers were beyond rude and have refused to refund any part of prepaid reservation. Save your money and find another hotel, such as the Ashling.",1,2023,08,11
231,2 Nights stay in Dublin,"Convenient location for walking to near by attractions likes Jameson, Guinness, and others. 

Rooms are clean, modern and we didnt have issues with the noise (from behind the walls/or outside the windows since we had a streetview room). During our first night someone triggered the alarm at 5AM in the morning so it was a brutal wake up call but the hotel apologized for it the following day in a small letter, which was a very nice thing of them to acknowledge. Staff at the front desk was really nice too

Breakfast included was decent, plenty of options and espresso machines were a welcome thing too.

Parking - the hotel works with Q Parking lot, I believe it was called, is a close walking distance but driving was, due to one way streets, takes a moment to get in and out of the hotel - no big deal if you are on a lazy vacation/trip. The small drop off area in front of the hotel is good but gets pretty busy when people have their tax waiting for them so you may need to work around that.

TIP: if you arrive early you may want to plan your day around not being in the room as this appeared to be a very busy and popular hotel and we didnt get to our room until about the actual check in time 3PM - its of course an info given in advance but this is the first time we had to wait so close to actual time, add to that an overnight flight and a jet lag and it was super brutal to wait in the lobby, not the hotel's fault as its the usual policy, just an advice for planning ahead",5,2023,08,11
231,"Amazing vacation, amazing location","Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street a hotel with 4-star hotel offering comfortable accommodation in a central location. The room is modern, clean and nicely. 
The hotel has an on-site restaurant, serving a range of international and local dishes.
Friendly staff who can greatly enhance the overall customer experience, they are incredibly diverse, kind-hearted, and display an immense capacity for empathy.",5,2023,08,09
231,Jury’s inn,"Friendly staff when arriving at the hotel, who arranged a welcome breakfast for us.  Couldn’t check in until 3pm but was able to put bags in secure room.
Excellent choices at breakfast which is well worth the extra cost.
Room is clean and tidy but could do with a revamp (this maybe on the cards with work happening at the hotel during our visit)
Nothing bad to report on our visit to Dublin",4,2023,08,09
231,Great location in the centre of Dublin,"We arrived to the hotel after a long travelling day and were tired.
As we checked into our room we were disappointed not to find a fridge, a safe and weren't very impressed with the room.
when we spoke to reception, a fridge was brought to our room and safes are actually available close to reception.
Waking up the next morning we realised there was actually nothing wrong with the place, we were just too tired the night before.
The hotel is a standard 4 star hotel with all facilities you expect to find of a hotel of that standard.  It is extremely well located in the centre of Dublin and most attractions are within walking distance.
The staff are very helpful and responsive.",4,2023,08,08
231,A great hotel in a great location,"This is the second time web have used this hotel and I can say that we have had another great stay. We enjoyed our second free upgrade to an executive room which was a great surprise. The hotel is modern, clean with friendly attentive staff. The location is perfect in the heart of Dublin just round the corner from O’Connell Street. I cannot recommend this hotel enough.",5,2023,08,05
231,Great hotel for a weekend break.,"Great hotel, located to the North of Dublin city centre. All main attractions are within walking distance however buses & trams are easily accessible. Room was clean and well looked after.   Breakfast was good, great choice with everything topped up when becoming empty. Friendly staff and good bar which stayed open late. Like most hotels in the city centre it was expensive in comparison for value for money but I would certainly use it again.",5,2023,08,01
231,"Great location & comfortable rooms, if bathroom a little dated","Great location for exploring Dublin. Close to all the major sight seeing areas. Easy access from the airport bus - stops close by. Rooms comfortable with TV, kettle, shower.
Bathroom a little dated (tile work needed a good clean up) & no logic to where soap dispenser & shelving placed (too high up & not convenient) No view, just looked across at the rooms opposite. Relatively quiet (but always ask for a room away from the lift area)
Staff helpful at desk as needed an early taxi. But then messed up when we changed the time - rang early to say taxi waiting, when amended to later. Paid for breakfast which was a good choice of hot & cold food - self service. Not the cheapest for a nights stay but pleasant enough",4,2023,07,31
231,Just ok,"Our first room was pretty bad. Toilet didn't flush. Very noisy outside, carpet pretty dirty.But we got moved to a much nicer, quieter room with no fuss. Keys needing replacing daily, wouldn't work. Staff very accommodating. Great position. Would recommend if you pay a bit more for a better room",4,2023,07,28
231,Berwick to Ireland,Hotel is in really good location and has helpful staff. Our room was very tired and the carpet needs replacing. Stayed for 4 nights. Our keys became non functional each and had to be re coded. Very firm bed and no top sheet. We would stay again if the room was renovated.,3,2023,07,25
231,Not worth the money!!,"I stayed here with my 2 children a couple of days ago and I would never stay again. Arriving at the hotel first impressions were good, nice staff large pleasant lobby etc. The room was large but basic, musty damp smell in the room(we were in 458 on the 4th floor), stains on the carpet and our window overlooked bins and rubbish. However beds were comfy and it did the job for one night. Had we been staying longer I'd have definitely asked for a different room. Hotel was noisy during the late evening/night will people shouting and roaring,banging on doors and kids shouting and stamping in the rooms around us. There was so much different noise from different rooms that I suspect there may be families living there(refugees?)
Breakfast was disgusting! After paying for breakfast when booking we still needed to go eat elsewhere and the food in the hotel was inedible.
The hotel itself is very central however the area is extremely rough. I'm a dub but didn't feel safe outside the hotel with my kids particularly in the evening/night. People openly dealing drugs on Moore Street as we walked past, gangs lying around the streets drinking and smoking pot. Each to their own but there's a time and a place surely. No guards to be seen anywhere, they turn a blind eye to the drug dealing but are quick to move homeless people along who are begging. 
My advice to anyone coming to Dublin would be stay on the southside of the city or preferably choose a different destination for your holiday😒",3,2023,07,22
231,"Location good, Mattresses needs some work. ","Location, cleanliness, food and service was good. The beds are not that great as they use cheap spring mattresses that made my back hurt every night. I cant recommend this hotel unless they change the mattresses to standard hotel foam mattresses. ",3,2023,07,19
231,2ND VISIT NOT QUITE THE SAME,"This is my 2nd visit to the hotel. I was a little disappointed.   What on earth is matter with your TV channels only 4 that is crazy.   No fridge, glasses or ice bucket. It is a great shame to let these little things which was otherwise a lovely 2nd visit.",3,2023,07,18
231,"Jay Mehta, India ",Superb location (under 5 min walk to O Connors Street) and great room/bathroom size are the key attractions. Helpful and courteous staff. Didn't use the restaurant. The bar is nice (though not exquisite). Would certainly recommend. ,5,2023,07,10
231,Great stay and location,"The whole stay was faultless. The staff were very friendly and in particular Catherine on Reception gave us some brilliant advice and recommendations for our stay in Dublin. We went to Howth which was a DART trip away and well worth a visit , something we wouldn't have discovered without her help.",5,2023,07,07
231,Jury's Inn & Leonardo Hotels Parnell St Dublin,"Upon arrival to check in on the evening of my stay, I was informed by a member of staff that I was unable to pay for my room with cash.  This was very disappointing as this was not listed when reservations were made online and there were no alternative payment arrangements offered by the hotel.  Luckily I managed to source some bank details from a friend who was staying at the hotel.  This ultimately and unduly affected my stay as I felt ostracized for attempting to pay with legal tender and only for my friend's kind assistance, I would have had great difficulty in finding suitable accommodation for the night.  During check in, I found the member of hotel staff to be extremely passive  when questioned about the hotel's policy on cash payments.  I was informed that the ""Jury's Inn and Leonardo Hotels would look into this in the future""

SIMPLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH 😠😠

Due to this extremely negative experience, I will not be recommending Jury's Inn and/or Leonardo Hotels Dublin in the future.",1,2023,07,03
231,Great experience,"Extremely happy with our stay, the hotel is quite and has a good vibe, up to date and very clean. Staff very professional and welcoming. breakfast was delicious and a variety to suit every taste and a very chilled atmosphere. Room was clean and beds very comfortable. I would definitely recommend and come back next time I am in Dublin. ",5,2023,07,03
231,Very comfortable,"Nice rooms and the beds are very comfortable with lots of pillows. I didn't try the bar or restaurant so can't comment on them. Check staff are nice. Only down side was the air conditioning unit outside the room needs a service, it made a racket during the night. Other then that very pleased with my stay and would return.",4,2023,06,30
231,"Go for the breakfast, stay for the location","The hotel was in a great place in Dublin and the breakfast was AMAZING. As a gluten-free vegetarian, my daughter is vegetarian, and the rest of the family love their breakfast meats and such, the restaurant offered a VERY filling breakfast to get our day started.  The staff was so friendly, worth a visit for sure. ",5,2023,06,21
231,"Great location, good stay","My wife and I recently spent 4 nights at this hotel.  One of the best things about this place is the location - very close to public transport links (e.g. bus to/from the airport), with an array of bars and restaurants close by, and  close enough to the main attractions without being too noisy.  We had a room on the 4th floor and it was very quiet.  The room had pretty much everything we needed, including a decent wi-fi and powerful a/c, but the furnishings all felt a bit old/out-dated and in need of a refurb.  More drawers/storage space would, also, not have been amiss.  For £200/night (without breakfast) we expected a little better.  We also expected our room to be cleaned by the time we returned after a day out.  However, the cleaning operative did not turn up until after we had returned in the late afternoon each day.  On a better note, the staff were courteous and attentive and the attention to safety/security (e.g. door key needed to operate the lifts) was very reassuring. In the end, we did take breakfast (at a very reasonable £12.50) which comprised an excellent buffet with quality produce.  We did not use the bar or take any additional meals so cannot comment about that.  Having a Tesco literally over the road was very convenient for any incidentals/snacks!",4,2023,06,21
231,Poor Value for the Price,"We stayed at this hotel in 2019 when we visited Dublin and were very impressed then. We had a lovely big room with a bath. However, on this particular visit, we paid a lot more for our room and it was a disappointing small room on the fifth floor with a scabby wee shower and fittings that had definitely seen better days.
I also thought the state of the lobby had declined since our last visit, and there was a strong, strange smell permeating through this area of the hotel - kind of like the strong air-freshener used to disguise the smell of sweaty bodies and urine in public lavatories! For 206 Euros per night, I would really have expected something better. Overall, a disappointment. I'll try somewhere else next time.",3,2023,06,21
231,Too rude staff memmbers,"A couple of rude people, one at desk and one at the bar, serving us.  In a time where jobs are hard to come by there is no need for such rudeness.  In a time where we are come back from the pandemic, we need to be better humans. These people were not and were quite aggressive to others in my group.  Will not bring people for our annual conference again there.",1,2023,06,19
231,Everything perfect,"Great location, close to everything. 
Big parking building 5 minites away from the hotel.
Excellent service, very thoughtful staff, always willing to help/offer or suggest.
Rooms clean and cozy, comfortable beds.
Will come back",5,2023,06,18

Highly recommended.",5,2023,06,18
231,Nicola and Joe’s Dublin stay,"It was a very pleasant stay with all the usual amenities including a Nespresso coffee machine. The staff are friendly and the customer service good. The breakfast was good with all the usual things, a coffee machine, toaster, fruit, fried breakfast, cold meats and cheese for those who like continental breakfasts including pastries. I would recommend this hotel but it’s quite expensive.",5,2023,06,09
231,Amazing Breakfast!,"Lovely stay, fantastic breakfast!
We were upgraded as our air con didn't work. The Exec room was a lot better than the original.  
We had added breakfast on when we booked, it was amazing! So much choice and very clean. The jars, bowls etc were checked and replenished often.",5,2023,06,06
231,Good breakfast!,"Our room was nicely furnished and clean. We booked  the executive room and had a Nespresso coffee machine which suited us. We had cans of coke and Kit Kats with a few biscuits thrown in with bottles or still and fizzy water. The king size bed was hard but very comfortable with good pillows. 
We had breakfast the second day and it was delicious… buffet style but everything was fresh and cooked well. Lots of nice croissant and pastries with different breads to toast. All together a nice experience overall!",4,2023,06,06
231,BESt BREAKFAST EVER . ,"Booked our hotel through a holiday company just said we wanted to be central to everything, we were. The hotel was great only thing to aware of is that they only take cards payments for food and drinks which was annoying as we’d budgeted and taken cash , the waiter at the hotel said everything was card payments in Dublin which wasn’t true . Would definitely stay in a Jurys hotel again if only for the breakfast BEST ever . ",5,2023,06,06
231,Great location and super staff.,"Excellent location in Dublin; walking distance to Trinity College, St. Patrick's cathedral, many other downtown sites.  Breakfast was pretty good.  Bar staff were very friendly and it was opened late at night; nice location to get some work done.  Very friendly staff in the hotel, and extraordinarily quick addressing a minor plumbing problem we had.  Nice stay overall; it was a little pricey, but overall a good experience; and we'd come back again if in Dublin.",4,2023,06,04
231,Leonardo Hotel (formerly known as Jury’s Inn Parnell st.),"We spent two nights at Leonardo Hotel (formerly Jury’s Inn) in Dublin, Parnell street. It was a great location because it wasn’t too far from everything and yet wasn’t close enough to hear the party crowds late at night. There’s a Tesco literally across the street, a Lidl and an Aldi around the corner as well. You are also close to O’Connoll Street. Basically, it’s a great location if you want to stock up on supplies during your stay. When we got there on our first day, we got upgraded to an executive room. It was a surprise to us because we signed up for one of their twin rooms and when we checked-in, we were upgraded. They reminded us that there was NO extra charge for the upgrade. It was a great gesture on their part. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,06,02
231,Hotel in Dublin,A reasonably cheap hotel - we went on a package with flight - the room was comfortable and the staff were professional and friendly. Security was tight but discreet. We would have liked a few more 'basics' in the room such as water but the hotel is close enough to the City Centre to be able to walk everywhere.,4,2023,05,29
231,Centrally placed and clean,"Centrally placed; 2 -3 minutes to the airport coaches.
10-15 minutes walk to the Temple bar area - 

Nice staff, large room( 3 bed although we were only 2).
Good breakfast( EUR 12,50 pr.person and day) ; you get ""everything"".

We gladly come back",3,2023,05,23
231,Good start to our Ireland trip,"I appreciate what the front desk did for us.  After an overnight flight from Philadelphia to Dublin, we arrived at the hotel around 11am, which was really way too early to check in.  A room was available, so instead of just storing our luggage, we got into our room immediately.  We were even given an upgrade to one of the Executive King rooms.

I did think the room was a little small, and I did think the carpet could have been a little cleaner, but the bed itself was very comfortable.  The location was also really great as there were plenty of restaurants and shops within easy walking distance.  My wife and I did not have any noise issues.",4,2023,05,12
231,Great location for central Dublin,"We stayed for two separate nights after arriving in Dublin by ferry and before leaving the same way. 
Great location very near O'Connell St (150m?).
Good restaurant right across the road  - The Kingfisher - couldn't be handier.
Good breakfast buffet.
OK bar and snacks in evening.
Rooms clean, comfortable, serviceable.
Staff friendly and reasonably efficient.
Sort of price I'd expect - not cheap but not outrageous.
One gripe - failed to deliver the wakeup call we asked for (had set other alarms)",3,2023,05,12
231,Could definitely do with improvement ,"The room and house keeping was very good the house keeping staff were always friendly and helpful. 
The location is good but just outside a higher quality area. 
Unfortunately the people around the hotel were at times unpredictable. 
We found the reception staff to be too busy to assist with area information. 
The keys for the room malfunctioned 5 times and not once did the staff apologise for the inconvenience. 
As a smoker standing on the street was very uncomfortable,the amount of times we were asked for cigarettes became an every second person. 
Maybe a small area for smoking or vaping would be a safer and more comfortable experience. 
The breakfast was okay and the kitchen staff were helpful and friendly. 
If you choose to hire a car the parking is discounted at 20 Euro a day but a 5 minute walk from the hotel. ",3,2023,04,30
231,Decent hotel with friendly staff,Staff are very friendly and go out of their way for you. Rooms are adequate for the price paid. We had a family room for 3 adults which was comfortable. Bathroom is a bit tired and basic but ok. The lift can be noisy during the night so I would ask to be away from it if I visited again. Overall a decent place to stay in the centre of Dublin.,4,2023,04,21
231,Dublin City break,"Positives;

Location 10/10 everything is so close shops, bars & restaurants.

Staff friendly and efficient some more experienced than others.

Very comfortable bed!

Negatives;

They really need to change their carpets in their rooms they are stained, very old & musty.

Lobby could be cleaner I know they get a lot of traffic in & out however they should keep on top of it.

Bar is quite depressing  not inviting at all.We were standing for ages as there was no one at the bar. Some staff members seemed quite overworked and did not want to be there.

Overall we did had a pleasant experience and we would go back as their location was so convenient for us. I really do hope they will look into the feedback given and improve.",3,2023,04,17
231,Stay 14th April 23," Not impressed with room, stains on wall in bedroom, skirting boards dirty,in bathroom skirting board beside toilet damaged and paint peeling, double bed because casters on it moves when one goes to sit orit lie down.  Room could do with freshing up. Not impressed given price paid. ",3,2023,04,15
231,Nice stay,"Staff were great esp conor at check in he was so welcoming and liz in the bar. Location good, hotel very clean. Only compliant was the food pizza was extremely greasy and ingredients not fresh but from jars, I was also annoyed that the waitress didn't write down the order and some of it was wrong but she did handle it well.  A better selection on drinks in the bar would also have been nice maybe some cocktails, ginger ale, pineapple juice",4,2023,04,14
231,Don’t judge Dublin by this cover,"Don’t judge Dublin by this cover. It hasn’t even been a day and I want to check out. From the time the doors to the hotel opened, you are received with the smell of an old carpet and shampoo. The hotel room is drab and the bathroom stinks! When we went down to the restaurant, the staff was not friendly. I literally left my plate and walked out. The rooms are lust as bad. The carpet is old and stained. I honestly do not know if I will be able to stay the week there.",1,2023,03,31
231,Great mid price hotel,"We have just had a 2 night stay and cannot rate this city centre hotel highly enough.  From the fantastic staff and their genuine Irish welcome to the comfortable beds and cuddly duvets every thing was spot on, 10/10.  The breakfast was a real feast and the bar area was great for a few drinks and snacks.  Nothing was too much trouble and the location just perfect.  We will be returning very soon.",5,2023,03,25
231,Excellent Stay,Excellent accommodations and great entertainment. Stayed here during St Patrick’s day weekend. On group trip.  Evening entertainment was too notch. Room accommodations were great and accessible to all town activities. ,5,2023,03,18
231,"Great experience, will be back soon! ","Great stay! Hotel is located in city centre and it is very convenient and close to everything we wanted to see. Reception team so welcoming and we were being looked after during our stay, anything we asked for they did for us without any issue.
Breakfast is full Irish buffet and it was very delicious,you should definitely book it if you are planning to visit this hotel.
Bar and Restaurant Menu is great with lot of choices for food and drinks.
Rooms very clean, beds wonderful, we had good rest and slept very well.
We will definitely come back soon!",5,2023,03,16
231,Good location and consistent brand,I was spending two nights in Dublin. It was in a handy area for supermarkets and things. The shower head could be a bit better but was one and it was hot. The bed was very comfortable and the size of the room generous. A fridge would be awesome (just bar fridge size) in the room but it was good and I enjoyed my stay. I do find this chain of hotels quite good and consistent. The wifi and lifts worked well and there were plugs near the bed.,4,2023,03,14
231,"Great location, dropping standards","Very disappointing stay. Standards have dropped considerably since I last stayed here in November 2022. 
On arrival, was told bar was closed for maintenance for one night - on the second night, still not open. Meals were served in the restaurant - BUT only wine and soft drinks were available. 
Breakfast buffet - good choice available, BUT the hot food was only luke warm.
Only 5 TV channels available (Irish)  - BUT no BBC or ITV (Weak or no signal. Check antennae cable connection). Not good enough for this hotel. Reported to reception and was told that was correct!
In the first room I had there was a leaking window - reported and maintenance attended quickly - was going to require silicon to fix so I requested a new room. This was sorted within half and hour.",3,2023,03,14
231,Great hotel to cover Dublin,"Hotel in just the right location to cover Dublin, right by all the transport and close enough to walk to everything. Nice quiet hotel, staff so helpful, clean and comfortable, breakfast could not be bettered. Only issue we experienced was our room was cold, no matter what temperature we had it on.",3,2023,03,13
231,Great place with even better staff,"We recently stayed in the hotel to celebrate a very special occasion as a couple. Conor on reception was amazing when I called with a few special requests before we arrived, he ensured me they would all be looked after which they were before we arrived. Every staff member we met was so nice and really good at their job. Customer service skills can be non existent sometimes in this industry but they all went above and beyond. As someone who works in the same industry I can appreciate when someone is great at what they do and we appreciated it so much! Cant wait to come back!",5,2023,02,27
231,Birthday break,"Absolutely fantastic trip to Dublin celebrating our birthdays the Jury’s Inn hotel staff were amazing especially Conor Bradley 
Room was spacious clean the breakfast was fab lots of choice great location",5,2023,02,20
231,Enjoyable Stay,"Enjoyed our stay here. Reception staff were very friendly, approachable and helpful. The area is ideal for anybody wanting to explore Dublin on foot and is close to the Temple Bar area. Parking on-site with a hotel discount was handy too. Would stay here again.",4,2023,02,19
231,10/10 stay!!! Lovely staff and lovely hotel. Definitely recommend! Keep up the good work!,"I stayed here with my mum for a mid week break in February. Absolutely brilliant time in this Jurys Inn. It was central, only a 10 minutes walk to Grafton Street, literally around the corner from O’Connell St. Breakfast was 10/10. Plenty of staff on, brilliant selection of food and plenty of food. Nothing was an issue for the staff, they were all lovely. From the reception staff to the bar staff to the house keeping staff. All fantastic!! We only stayed two nights and had our room cleaned on the second day. Really really impressed, you have to stay here. I will 100% be back! We enjoyed this stay so much.",5,2023,02,18

231,Brilliant Hotel,"I stayed here for a 2 night break with the family and was thrilled! The Breakfast was lovely and all for a very cheap price! The room was great and also the Reception staff were amazing! Thank you! Also a great location, right in the Heart of Dublin city! We will be coming back again! Very good experience!",5,2023,02,16
231,Can't be Faulted ,"Stayed here with mates and can't fault it. Room was very clean and had all things needed. Staff were excellent. Chap on check in was a good laugh , he was young enough and also the bar staff were also very pleasant and good to deal with. Location is great, close to gig venues and plenty of bars and restaurants. ",5,2023,02,12
231,"Some great staff, but I won’t be back. ","The staff are generally pleasant (Conor is great!) but the hotel is average at best. The location is central, but feels unsafe. Everything is dated and there is a general musty smell throughout the hotel. My room was overlooking the refuse collection site, so I would hate to have been there in the summer. The room was dated, and could have been cleaner. The shower was never anything more than lukewarm and breakfast was unappealing (hair in my toast and the bowl of fruit yoghurt looked pretty unpleasant) Juice had been spilt on the floor by the drinks station, so the floor was incredibly sticky - Perhaps instead of a warning sign it would have been better to clean the floor? Other colleagues had issues with noise from the restaurant setting up for breakfast from 5am. Based on this stay I will not be booking with this hotel chain again. There are plenty of other affordable hotel chains which offer much better accommodation. ",2,2023,02,08
231,Good place to stay,"Good hotel, there was a party of 15 and all rooms with breakfast no complaints at all.
Easy walking distance to main tourist areas and eateries. 
Breakfast was really nice, some items on the buffet breakfast ran out so had to ask but it was quickly sorted out. There's a bar in the hotel so was good to have that as a meeting point for a drink or two before hitting the town. 
Would stay again",5,2023,02,06
231,Lovely place to stay,"The hotel was in a good situation for what we needed, it had a bar, restaurant and gym. It was clean throughout, the bedrooms were fine and roomy  with tea and coffee making facilities, iron and ironing board, hair dryer and television.  All the staff on reception were very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay there again next time I visit Dublin.",5,2023,02,05
231,Nice Stay!,"We arrived wayyy before our check in time and got to store our luggage. Went shopping in the meanwhile. Then checked into a clean room. I brought earplugs because I knew the location is right downtown so I reccomend the same if your a light sleeper. I had a good sleep. 
Reception staff was supernice. 
I would definitely stay again. Really nice location if you're going shopping!
Thanks :)",5,2023,02,01
231,Affordable accomodation.,Great location. Comfy beds. Quiet hotel. The only critic the bar was closed. It wasnt advertised as shut so we came back to hotel for cocktails but only limited drinks were available in the restaurant. A bit disappointed.,5,2023,02,01
231,An unspectacular hotel with a hygiene issue,"This Jurys Inn is modestly priced and offers modest accommodation. One real no-no was my experience one evening in the bar on the second floor when a mouse ran across my foot, a sign of poor cleaning processes on premises where food is prepared and stored (the restaurant is just opposite the bar). Could do better.",3,2023,01,30
231,Great hotel and location,"Cracking hotel in a great location. We arrived at the hotel a bit too early for check but we met by Frederica who was brilliant and said we could check in straight away. 
She was so helpful and gave us lots of information about the hotel. We have stayed in Jury's Inn's a lot and they are great value for a short break. The room was clean and had everything we need. 
Breakfast was great, lots of choice, hot and cold. 
When we checked out, we were again met by Frederica who arranged for our luggage to be stored away as our flight wasn't until the evening. 
We would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2023,01,21
231,Great experience ,Myself and mam stayed here for a night to shop in the city centre. It was a wonderful experience and the staff were 10/10 especially the lovely lady on reception and the friendly young man working in the bar! Thank you for a wonderful stay - will be back. ,5,2023,01,17
231,"Great hotel , would return here","A well situated hotel for getting into Dublin centre and just a 10 min stroll into temple bar .
The rooms are well equipped with all you need for your stay , the bed was surprisingly comfortable ( I am fussy with mattresses) .
The breakfast is worth paying for and the selection was excellent for all tastes. We only had 2 nights here but would definitely return .",5,2023,01,16
231,Perfect Stay,"Stayed at Jury’s Inn for 2 nights from Thurs-Saturday.
We had a very early flight and got to the hotel at around 8am and we’re very tired so we’re hoping we could check in early, and to our surprise they were super accommodating and allowed us to check in early so we could have a couple of hours sleep before heading out to explore Dublin. This was really appreciated and can’t thank you enough.

The hotel itself is lovely , really central in walking distance from everything. The staff are lovely. Rooms very nice hot shower nothing to complain about. 

I asked for them to do something special for my partner as it was his birthday and they put a little treat in the room for us which was really appreciated!

All in all wonderful stay and would return!",5,2023,01,15
231,Loved it!,"Stayed for two nights to see Dublin and we weren't disappointed. Hotel is perfect for the city centre and Temple Bar plus shopping centres on the doorstep!. Hotel staff soo friendly, room and hotel very clean and the Irish breakfast was to die for 😋. Thank you.",5,2023,01,13
231,Lovely,"Stayed here for only one night on a short trip over from Liverpool. Was placed on floor 4 and had no issues with the room other than a very loud fan in the bathroom.
Staff were all very helpful and even let us check into our room 7 hours early when we asked if we could put luggage in.",5,2023,01,11
231,Ok Base for a couple,"Conor on reception lovely and friendly tbh all the staff were.
Rooms pretty loud as looking. On to the street found the area a little sketchy at times 

No bath - shower was like a wet room and just made the whole room wet .

Good size room though and relatively clean .",3,2023,01,08
231,Good stay at Jurys Inn,"Really good stay. We were upgraded to an executive room, the staff were so friendly, the breakfast was tasty, the room was clean and the bed was comfy. The location is good, the value for money was extremely good. Was sceptical due to some poor reviews on here, but overall was pleased with the stay. The only improvement could be modernising the bathrooms and putting nicer products in here, but for the price and the overall stay it’s not a deal breaker. 

Thank you Jurys inn for a lovely stay.",4,2023,01,06
231,"Very clean, comfortable hotel with friendly staff","Every trip to Dublin i choose this hotel… For the price the place is very clean, has lovely staff, is right in the centre of the city, the beds are comfortable and plus if you have to check out or are early to check you have the option to leave your luggage there and go out…The only thing i would say is breakfast is a bit low quality (as there was no gluten free option, and the eggs, sausages ect. were soggy and distasteful) but this place will always be the hotel to stay for us ❤️",5,2023,01,03
231,Great place to stay with great staff,"Hotel was very clean, located in a perfect place for visiting local attractions etc with an amazing breakfast to set you up for the day.

Everything was fantastic but what made it was the really nice staff, so friendly and helpful, could not have asked for better staff,  esecially house keeping, you leave a room at 12 noon and the rrom is still serviced. 

Staff a massive credit to this hotel.",5,2023,01,03
231,It's really a 4 stars?,"The room is on 2nd floor. No safe, no minifridge in this room. The bathroom is as shown in the photos. The room is not soundproof. The TV had only few channels working (I asked the receptionist for information but they didn't know why they stopped working and they didn't check). They have a wonderful hall and a nice small gym. Nice staff.",3,2022,12,30
231,"Good hotel, but a little expensive","The hotel is well located in the city centre, close to a lot of attractions. The room was good, clean and comfortable. 

The breakfast is nice, with many options for the guests and the staff is very friendly. They have a luggage room to leave your luggages when your are arriving or leaving.

I would recommend the hotel, but it's expensive.",5,2022,12,21
231,"Very poor, would not recommend","Very disappointed with our stay. We stayed on the 5th floor. The shower had hairs still in it from the previous guest, the toilet seat was wonky/broken. The room was heated by a very old fashioned fan like vent which did not work properly so our room was absolutely freezing in the night time, we both had to sleep with a hoodie on to warm ourselves. The main issue was at 5am a very loud noise began to happen which I think it from the old pipes within the hotel. It was a horn like sound that happened every 5/10 minutes consistently between 5am and 6am which completely disturbed our sleep and woke us up from that point on. When I spoke to the staff on checkout about the noises at 5am the receptionist told me it must have been construction (at 5am??)  they made no effort to offer any form of apology or ask any further questions about the issue. Would not recommend.",1,2022,12,20
231,Really welcoming Staff,"I stayed here with my sister for an event in the Olympia. Ater traveling from Wexford and getting caught in traffic we were stressed and tired but we got to reception to check in and our experience from the start of our stay was such a lovely one. We were pleasantly greeted by Conor who was very efficient from start to finished but managed to make us have such a laugh while telling us all we needed, along with some recommendations while we were staying there. I am only really writing this review just to give him a mention because he is a credit to the hotel. Room, bar and others are adequate but his service was top notch. Really well done, you are made for customer service. We will definitely be back",5,2022,12,13
231,Food is hit and miss,"The food was disappointing, pulled pork s/w is unsubstantial without the advertised slaw, the burger was ok but the fries were not fresh, staff were friendly and as efficient as the kitchen would allow. ",2,2022,12,07
231,December trip,"I recently stayed in Jurys Inn parnell street on a work trip supporting service users. 

From the minute we arrived we were greeted with issues. We had booked our trips via booking.com and had booked 4 rooms for 4 adults. There was confusion regarding this and we showed the receptionist our booking through a mobile phone. When the receptionist returned the phone to us he passed it over the card machine resulting in €340 payment being taking from our bank account via phonepay. The receptionist was not apologetic and we then were greeted by manager who would not listen to what the issue was. When asked when the money would go back into the account we had a blunt reply of ""3-5 working days"" and no empathy. We are in the height of a cost of living crisis and also on the mouth of Christmas so this situation was not ideal. We waited 1 hour to get checked in which was traumatic for our service users with learning disabilities. One staff member called Conor was helpful during the incident. 

At 9pm we received a phonecall to the room to advise payment was incorrect and we needed to come down to reception to pay balance. We advised we would be down in a bit as we were busy. Another phonecall received 10 minutes later to again ask us to come down to pay balance.

Our rooms were very dated, heating not working in 2 rooms and one of the rooms smelt like cleaning chemicals. One of the rooms we're adjoining to a different room and were noisy until 2am. 

Only good thing about this hotel was location. Wouldn't stay again or recommend. 

",1,2022,12,02
231,Warm comfy and practical,"Isn't it funny how people have different experiences. Stayed here with my sister last month after a show in the bord gais theatre. First time stay and won't be the last(staying here again next weekend for a Christmas shopping trip). The staff on the main desk were lovely to us and check in was pretty fast. The breakfast was lovely and plentiful and the coffee was great so I was happy. The room was small but that didn't bother us as it was only one night. The only reason I've put 4 stars is because it was a right mare trying to get into the room...it took ages for the key to take before we could get in,this system either need to be explained or made easier in some way. Plus there is a tescos right across the road and around the corner is Moore Street so super close to the shops. Super excited to return here next weekend.",4,2022,11,28
231,Shower issues ,"Hotel generally ok for the price. Reception and bar area lovely and welcoming staff. Rooms basic but ok, (no fridge in standard room). I write this review whilst still in the hotel on my final day/night, as I woke up at 5am today to see if the shower would be hot, (before everyone starts to use the showers throughout the hotel and before writing my review). What completely ruined my stay was the shower, as the shower does not get hot enough. Respect to the staff as I complained, and on two occasions, they sent a maintenance person to the room, but the issue was not rectified - therefore, that alone would put me off returning. We were offered another room but the temperature of the water was the same so we did not see the point in moving. It was just a letdown for a birthday get-away as I usually stay in hotels, not wanting to leave, but this time, I've just wanted to get home to use our shower!

",3,2022,11,28
231,Overall Good Hotel And Quite Affordable,"It was my first time in Dublin and it was a nice experience the hotel everyone was friendly  and breakfast  was very good enjoyed every minute of it 😊 what I loved most was that they put a chocolate and a note congratulating my boyfriend it was his birthday 🥰 It is quite affordable especially since it’s in the centre, good to shop and stop to put stuff in room.",5,2022,11,27
231,No complaints,"Stayed here for the second time, no complaints, room was clean and well serviced, bar prices were reasonable 
Didn’t  eat here so can’t comment 
Would certainly return
Within walking distance of many parts of the city 
An earlier check in would be helpful but had improved since last year",4,2022,11,23
231,Be Cautious of Neighborhood !!,"I gave this hotel five stars in March, 2022. After staying there again in October for 12 days I've lowered my rating. Again, great location, spacious and clean room (Executive Double), nice bathroom, quiet at night and fine mattress. Avoid the food in the bar which came  from the restaurant. The neighborhood is becoming dangerous. Drug deals on Moore Street and pickpockets galore. Look everyone in the eye so they don't think you are an easy target. On Monday, 17 October at 4:30 PM a drunk wandered in to the hotel lobby and went to sleep in the middle of the floor. One thing you learn if you travel to Ireland frequently is that there is absolutely no police protection. The Garda are impotent. The Garda showed up, did nothing, just tried to talk to the bum, and stayed there for over two hours until the bum woke up and wandered out with the police. This person would have been arrested, cuffed and thrown in jail for malicious trespassing in the United States.

Bottom line, be careful outside the hotel, otherwise it's a great place to stay. The three employees who I want to compliment are Conor and Antonio on the front desk and Marie, the wonderful lady who works on the 4th floor, who made sure we had everything we needed during our 12 day stay.",4,2022,11,18
231,"So, So ..","Good location, and simple checkin. there is also a discuount on local parking overnigjht. breakfast is simple, and rooms are clan, but feels very '90s' in the decor and general experience. no complaints, but will look elsewhere when next in Dublin",3,2022,11,17
231,Brutal!,"Most unfriendly,  unhelpful,  ignorant staff, that I've come across in a long time. Bedroom absolutely freezing,  had to send for maintenance person at 12am to try and work it. She said she fixed it and it would warm up in 10 minutes or so, went to bed with an extra layer on! Breakfast looked good,  but was freezing and after payingan extrae14 each for it, it shouldat leastbe edible.  Couldn't find cups for tea, waitress that was looking after food was so rude and practically shouted at me for asking.. I know that city hotels have such a turn over of people,  they don't need to be nice, but never again would I stand in it. It doesn't cost any thing and at their prices, it should be a must!",2,2022,11,03
231,Jury’s Inn Parnell Street,"From the moment we arrived at Jury’s Inn Parnell St., for a girly night away  we were greeted by Conor on reception who was so friendly, chatty and welcoming. Our room was spotlessly clean, bar staff very friendly and a great selection on them breakfast buffet. Great location, highly recommend Jury’s Inn.",4,2022,10,24
231,"A nice, central hotel to base a Dublin stay","The staff throughout the hotel were attentive, very helpful and couldn't do enough to help.  Room entry 4.00 pm, but we arrived very early and were able to access our rooms immediately. Reception staff looked after our luggage on day of departure until we were ready to go to airport. 
The room itself was immaculate and roomy. Facilities were good.Perhaps a bit more wardrobe space would have been good in a room for three people and I would have liked a room safe.
Only criticism I would offer was in relation to the restaurant. The staff were lovely and the breakfast was fine. No problems. Buffet-style but lots of choice. However, the plate warmer was not on, so plates were cold and the heating plates for the bacon, egg, sausages were also not on, so the food on them got cold quickly. 
We had booked B&B, so dined out in town. However, the hotel menu seemed quite limited and geared for an American clientele, burgers, hot dogs etc. Limited use of traditional Irish fare.",4,2022,10,24
231,Short stay,"Stayed for two nights with friends brilliant hotel very comfy beds clean  lovely breakfast and staff friendly, helpful and happy to help it is a short bus journey from airport and easy to get around Dublin will definitely stay here again",5,2022,10,21
231,Worst Jury's Inn I have stayed.,"I am on business for 3 days and when I checked in, I specifically requested a room away from elevators and service doors.  Low and behold the lady that checked me in purposely allocated me in a room adjacent to two service doors.  So severely disrupted by sleep.  
The staff don't really seem to care even though I requested a room change following, they all ganged up in reception to tell me that's not possible including security. Stay away from this hotel if you are in Dublin. Further it's not in the nicest part of the city.",1,2022,10,18
231,"Central to O’Connell Street, clean,","Lovely room, nice staff, very central, clean, unfortunately we could hear everything from the room next to us, all conversation! Uncomfortable, makes you self conscious what you are saying and doing. Bus stop around the corner, shops, Murphy’s inn well worth a visit.",3,2022,10,15
231,Recommend,Very good centrally located hotel. Excellent large room. (No refrigerator which surprised me). Room service delivery charge (which I was unaccustomed to) Excellent breakfast. Would stay again once I got used to the quirks of the hotel.,4,2022,10,04
231,Better than Expected,"I didn't have high expectations for the hotel, but it exceeded them.  The staff were friendly and the rooms comfortable.  I didn't try the breakfast because it was fairly expensive, but there's a Centra across the street where you can buy tea/coffee and breakfast stuff fairly cheaply.  The main downside is that the hotel is a bit far from the main tourist attractions in Dublin, maybe a 25-30 minute walk to the attractions south of the river, and a taxi or tram ride away from Phoenix Park and the west side of the city.  But for a reasonably priced place to lay your head down at the end of the night, this place is good.",4,2022,10,02
231,Choose somewhere else.,Old accommodations that were NOT convenient to the parking garage or any restaurants or sights that we were interested in visiting. The alley our room windows opened up to was incredibly noisy with garbage trucks and singing drunks until 2am. The breakfast was superb therefore I gave 2 stars. ,2,2022,09,26
231,Good stay,"Very good hotel in the centre od Dublin.amazing staff and clean rooms.only negative was check in time, was there at 3:45 and was told the room would be ready in 15 minutes but took like 40 minutes. The restaurant was kinda expensive but you get what you pay fort, the food was amazing.",5,2022,09,20
231,Very well located with all you may need,"Great location, clean room/bathroom, excellent service, many very nice restaurants nearby, safe neighbourhood. Honestly, difficult to ask for more as far as quality/price ratio is concerned. I would go back without hesitation.",4,2022,09,17
231,Better than expected,"After a not so great experience at the pricey Gresham, we stayed at the Jury’s Inn on Parnell Street. There were 3 of us in a family room and the rate was half of that at the Gresham. The breakfast buffet was comparable to the Gresham but 2 euros cheaper. Room and bathroom was a bit small for the 3 of us, but we didn’t spend much time in our room so it wasn’t an issue. Friendly staff - especially Conor. But overall a great value, clean rooms, quiet and convenient location. I highly recommend.",5,2022,09,14
231,Not offering value for money,"Very mediocre hotel not worth the money. Old and tired look. A/c not working, the control for a/c is ‘Sanyo’-at least 20 yrs old. Rooms are clean but look very old and jaded. Not worth 220 euros/night at all.
The location is good but the rooms are comparatively smaller.",1,2022,09,07
231,Honey moon,"We booked with booking. Com
Decided few days before cancel
Personal reasons etc.
I call jurys to cancel they said i had contact booking. Com in order to cancel
So i contacted booking. Com
I got confirmation email say booking at jurys Hotel Dublin parnell Street was cancelled.
Only find out few days later that Jurys charged us for night b&b €351.00
I call hotel see why had we been charged for hotel booking when we had  given them plenty of notice and followed their advice.
Only get very Rude Staff which sounded like was charged of hotel spoken very rudely to me
He Did not care we charge for room we not stay inn just staff no Help at all very Rude and selfish and arrogant behaviour please stay away from this hotel all they care about is wallet and charging couple on honeymoon room was never stayed inn
When i asked if its possible ro change date for another time they not even consider it..
They just bunch of con artists stay away from Jurys Hotel parnell Street Dublin",1,2022,09,04
231,Not a bad hotel ~ Location is great,"Just got back from a 3 Night stay… Didn’t get off to the best of starts as the room was not ready at 3pm… As it was booked for a special birthday treat we were expecting something a little better than what we got…

The rooms are basic but clean… No fridge, no safe and no plug one side of the bed..

Staff were friendly however the check in was poor and no info given as to how to use the lifts etc etc 

Location was great which for us was what we wanted

We only are in for one breakfast and tbh that was nice and worth the money

Would we come back…. Possibly",3,2022,08,29
231,Awesome stay with friends,"We stayed at Jurys inn from 11th -15th of August, in room 533. 
We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. Our room was nice and spacious enough for the two of us. It was a nice walking distance from the main streets and the Temple bar area which we frequently visited.
All the staff was very friendly and greeted us with a smile. Our favourite was Rishi, who was on nightshifts in the reception. He was very friendly and helpful and always super professional and polite, a real gem. The hotel is super lucky to have such a great member in their team. 
All in all, our stay was awesome and we look forward to come vistit again in the future.",5,2022,08,29
231,Noisy early mornings,"Staff are very hard working here abd friendly and helpful.,The hotel is in a good location and is clean.Our room was,a little small and we had only one chair between us .The bathroom was great.The bed was very comfortable too.We had a room at the back of the hotel on the third floor and we were woken up early 6am by builders and bin collection each day.",3,2022,08,18
231,Definitely not worth the price,"Room was really small and incredibly stuffy. No air con and if you left the windows open then it was quite noisy. 
The shower was a tiny cubicle … the type last seen in the 80s. No chance of keeping your hair dry in this tiny space. 
Breakfast was the usual Jury’s fare. A decent enough choice but bacon was “flabby”, pastries tough and eggs pretty well done. 
If this has been the usual £70 for an average city centre ish hotel there would be no complaints but at 192 this was daylight robbery. Would t stay here again",3,2022,08,13
231,Hello,Good service and location I prefer staying there when in Dublino so I think I can choose it from now on ababbabbb anananan ababab I have non more to say but thank you even if price should be cheaper for a triple,3,2022,08,09
231,Hen do,Slight unhappy. Location was great. Few minutes walk to bars and shops. Our card was over charged by £1000 ! Not enough towels were given and then we were left with none in 2 rooms. Staff were helpful I will say,2,2022,08,08
231,"Jury's Inn, Parnell Street, Dublin","The hotel was centrally located. A few minutes walk from restaurants, bars, shops and tourist sights. The car park recommended by the hotel was quite distant and not easy to find due to one way systems.",5,2022,08,07
231,None,"Overall, I was very impressed with my stay. Great location and value for money. The breakfast was particularly good with an excellent range of items. It's a few years since I last stayed at this Jury's hotel but I would definitely stay there again. The staff were particularly pleasant.",4,2022,08,05
231,Excellent location and minutes from Grafton Street.,"A nice hotel with an excellent location. The price was very good considering we had a massive suite overlooking Christchurch. Plenty of room for our family of four. Lovely breakfast.

Checkin was great with helpful reception desk who looked after our baggage until we were able to check in.",4,2022,08,02
231,Totally dated,"Central location, Would not go back, there are enough reasons this is always one of the cheapest hotels. It's very dated. stayed there in 2021 and 2022. The room and bathroom weren't nice at all. It needs renovation.",1,2022,08,02
231,Very good,I stayed here with my 2 daughters for 2 nights. We were here on a shopping trip and we were not disappointed. I was a bit worried after reading some of the negative reviews but I didn’t need to worry. Location was very good. Breakfast was very good. Our room was cleaned while we were there so no problems with that! We were very happy here and would definitely stay again!,5,2022,08,01
231,Things that go bump in the night,Stayed here for one night at the end of a business trip. We were given room 303 which was opposite the lifts and above the bar area. I’m not sure what it was making the noises but we were disturbed by frequent scraping sounds like furniture being dragged across a wooden floor. I’m typing this at 2.40am having been unable to stay asleep because of the intermittent noises. We have to be up and on the road at 7am so to say I am not happy is an understatement. Not a happy camper.,2,2022,07,28
231,"Great hotel, amazing staff, highly recommend!","We landed in Dublin from Australia and I felt unwell.  We arrived at hotel and I gradually got worse. Delores on reception assisted me and made arrangements for me to go to hospital.  Delores looked after my husband,  arranged discounted extended stay, breakfast etc. I can't thank Delores enough for helping us. The hotel room was great, breakfast delicious,  bar area perfect, serving amazing cocktails & friendly service.  Excellent hotel , good location, highly recommend! Thank you!",5,2022,07,27
231,Poor,"Poor experience from on line check in that was not fit for purpose . Staff no idea about loyalty offers made with online check in. No atmosphere in the hotel
Room was fine but check out and check in took way too long and restaurant menu lots choices not available and bar was same.",2,2022,07,23
231,Awesome place to stay! ,"Great experience overall. During these times of uncertainty (thank you covid) the Jury inn staff made us feel welcome right from the start. Our room, 316 was clean and beds were comfortable and the pillows really added to our great night sleep. Parnell  street is very busy, so if you are someone who needs a window open during the night, ask for a room away from the street.
All staff were very helpful, especially to this tea lover, extra tea bags were not a problem, those little things make a difference. So convenient to  pubs, bus tours and shopping.
Only one suggestion would be to have an option to choose a room with a small fridge, so as options for extra milk and other drinks could be keep cold. ",5,2022,07,22
231,OK but some changes needed.,"The room was fine, good size for a family of 3. However it should be made much clearer that you do not accept cash as payment, we were then told it would be an extra €100 to pay by cash. The lock in the bathroom didn't work and my daughter was stuck inside until husband managed to unlock from the outside. Public toilets also didn't have a lock on some of the cubicles. However the breakfast was fantastic, lots of choice and we were able to fill up for a day of sightseeing. To be honest, I probably wouldn't stay here again but it was a good budget stay.",3,2022,07,21
231,"Staff great, rooms poor standard.","The bed was extremely uncomfortable and I although it was stated as double I think it must have been narrower than a standard double. The mattress needed replacing and bowed in the middle. There was very little room to get out of the bed on one side. It felt like the bedroom had been put into a space not quite big enough for a bedroom. There was no body lotion in the complimentary toiletries which is pretty much standard in other hotels. The hotel was very run down overall and needs refurnishing. The staff, however, were excellent, very helpful and friendly. I feel bad leaving a bad review on their behalf, staff great, facilities poor.",2,2022,07,18
231,Pass on this place,"My husband and I arrived at 9am.  We had been told prior to arrival they would do anything they could to get us a room available at that time.  Nothing was ready.  After flying all night on little sleep, not what you want to hear, but ok.  Here is a key to go to the second floor and use the restroom and they will call us when our room is ready.   

We went up and changed and tried to freshen up.  Decided to make the best of it and go see some sites.  We had not heard from them - we weren’t sure if phones were working properly with new SIM cards so we came back at 4pm (past check in which was at 3).  STILL no room ready!   I pointed out it was AFTER check in time.   Oh well.  We now go to get some dinner. We get some dinner and finally a room is ready.   

Seeing as we are in Ireland for several weeks, we have a lot of luggage.  We are at the farthest room from the elevator (and the carpet is not forgiving to the roll suitcases!).   Not fun after the exhaustion you have at that point.  

There is a VERY little sink in the bathroom.  Don’t plan on setting anything on it.  

Room was just ok.  Breakfast had a nice buffet.  Only nice thing about the hotel.  

I would not come back here and recommend others look for something better.",2,2022,07,12
231,Whānau returning home,"We stayed at the hotel during the first week of July and got a  double room for myself and my daughter. 
Although the room was comfortable,  the lack of servicing of the room I.e. changing of towels, emptying of rubbish bins etc, let them down a bit. We had to call for fresh towels and toilet paper which wasn't good  ...
",3,2022,07,11
231,"Not bad, but could have been better.","Nice staff. Breakfast good but not excellent.
Our room was definitely too small to host 4 people (two adults and two kids). There was almost no cupboard for clothes. The room would need some maintenance. 
The hotel is located centrally close to POI.",3,2022,07,08
231,The Jury’s out,"Room was okay,bathroom was a disabled bathroom so sink was low but it was clean.
Breakfast was poor,coffee machine programmed for just black coffee,milk had run out on cereal area,only brown bread available for toast,warm food selection was very poor.
Staff were polite and we were able to leave bags before check in time.",3,2022,07,01
231,Very comfy bed!,We were in Dublin for an Eagles concert and stayed here for 2 nights as hotel choice was somewhat limited due to another concert in town on same night as the Eagles. Location was quite good and handy to get to but we generally prefer to be on other side of river. The hotel was very clean but we didn't have much contact with staff members as we didn't spend much time in the hotel. The bed in our room was very comfortable and the breakfast each morning was delicious so on a B&B basis we did well and have no complaints on that score. Our room wasn't cleaned at all during our stay but we were told on checking in that if we wanted towels changed just to let reception know. I do think this blaming everything on covid now is wearing a bit thin though. We arrived at hotel around 1pm expecting to be told no room ready but we were pleasantly surprised to get in straight away so all in all we had an enjoyable stay with no problems.,4,2022,06,27
231,Mouldy bathroom,"Mouldy bathroom.....

We stayed in Jury's Inn Parnell Street last weekend as we had a family Christening and location was good.
We arrived at 11am (room not ready even though we advised early arrival as travelling with young kids, not a biggie as we got to leave our bags and head out for the day). Returned late evening for a quick change to meet friends for dinner. Returned just after 9pm got kids ready for bed and then noticed the bathroom ceiling was covered in mould around toilet wasn't very well maintained. As kids just got into bed and almost sleep, I decided to wait until morning to speak to hotel.

Went down on way to breakfast to speak to staff, they told me they were aware of mould as there was a leak, I asked them why they sold the room, no reply! We were heading out to the christening for the day as advised to pack up and leave bags at reception and they would allocate us an upgraded room when we returned.

Again, we didn't return until late that night, but at first inspection room looked bigger and bathroom was cleaner, so we just got into bed.
 
Next morning, we were checking out to catch our flight back to Scotland, so we all were showering and when lifting a clean towel to bring into bathroom there was blood stains on it!!!
Called reception who sent up clean towels.
On check out spoke to the same duty manager as day before who didn't seem overly concerned regarding the bloody towel or our poor experience of our stay. Advised they would refund us a % turned out to be only 80 euro that got refund, not great considering the poor experience/service.

Breakfast wasn't the best earlier, hotel obviously ran or running out of products as Orange juice was watered down, no bread, mugs, glasses, or juices left when asked to top up juices they advised only apple juice left. Seemed to be too much trouble for staff when I asked and got a roll of the eyes.",1,2022,06,26
231,Nice public areas. Rooms need update,"I would agree with recent reviews. No room service due to COVID is poor excuse now. Understand not everyone may be comfortable with staff entering room but why not give customers the choice. For the price and 4 Star hotel it’s not really acceptable not to clean rooms. We did have ours cleaned on 4th night which makes no sense when the reason for not cleaning for short stays is COVID !  The public areas are lovely, Bar area was great and breakfast was very good. The room needed updating, very tired for a 4 Star hotel especially as it was an executive room. Didn’t overly like the location and would  pick hotel the other side of the river next time. I think Jury hotels have lost their way a bit in recent years and if you’re going for big chain would pick another one.",2,2022,06,24
231,Good clean convenient hotel,"Good clean hotel, check-in & bar service could be quicker. Good, almost black-out curtains in the bedroom. Poor quality toilet paper was a disappointment in the bathroom. Conveniently located centrally for north of the river amenities.",4,2022,06,23
231,No room service / cleaning even if you stay 4 nights,"We never experienced such a bad (it means not existing) room service in a hotel of this level. We stayed for 4 days and no room service is absolutely not acceptable, especially for the price we paid. If no room service is possible because of staff shortage, you have to reduce your room prices!!!",1,2022,06,21
231,Overpriced. Avoid,Stayed whilst touring with friends. Extremely overpriced for what is essentially a 3 star bland corporate hotel. Shocked to find out rooms only serviced every 4 days. Had to ask for clean towels and be prepared to make your own bed. Cancelled our booking for jury's in Belfast and stayed elsewhere. Avoid . Given 1 star as I couldn't give zero.,1,2022,06,20
231,Two-stars service at four-starts price,"Rooms in this hotel are only cleaned after the fourth day of stay, apparently because of Covid policies (that are not applied in other Dublin hotels I visited recently). That is a management decision you might or might not agree with, but it should be clearly advertised before you make your booking.

By the way, you can't either file a complaint in an official form, because the hotel doesn't supply you with them.

So, if you are looking for a four-star experience, including your room cleaned up every day, bright light in the bathroom that doesn't hide the dirt, noise-less air conditioning, etc... book somewhere else",1,2022,06,20
231,Dublin Parnell street,"We stayed at the Sam hotel a few years ago and decided to come back on this trip but we are more likely to go with the Clayton next time based on this experience even though it is more out of the way. Too many COVID hangovers (no room cleaning for short stays, no room service, no change given for the cash only coffee machine in your own reception foyer - ALL because of COVID) some staff were quite brusque.",3,2022,06,18
231,Enjoyable stay in Dublin,"Jury's Inn, Parnell Street, Dublin.  Clean & comfortable room on the 5th floor. Excellent breakfast choice, friendly staff & good location near to shopping, restaurants & bus/tram stops. A busy street but plenty of crossing areas.",5,2022,06,18
231,Very enjoyable,The room was a bit small but the friendly staff more than made up for it. Extra requests were shortly answered and the breakfast was delicious. We will definitely stay here again on future Ireland visits.,5,2022,06,17
231,Nice clean comfortable hotel,"Spent 4 nights at the Jurys Inn Parnell Street, 30th May to 3rd June B&B. Hotel was very clean throughout, our room was comfortable. Breakfast was very nice with a decent selection of hot and cold options.
Hotel location was quite (for a city). Very handy for O'Connell Street the main shopping centre. If you want to be more in the centre of the night life i.e. around Temple bar, then perhaps a hotel south over the river for convenience. Saying that if you're in Dublin for 2 or more days use the hop on hop of buses worth the money and nothing is to hard to get to.",4,2022,06,10
231,Great Service,"Was in Dublin for a vacation for a few days. The front desk service Was great , rooms clean, coffee/teas  in room.  Early check-in was provided Location was very centrally located. Would stay here again.",5,2022,06,10
231,None,"your staff was very professional, friendly, and courteous.  Next time in ""Ireland"" i will stay at the ""Jurrys Inn"". Excellent location, bus service,taxis, airport close by.(30 minutes ). i stayed on ""Parnell Street"" in Dublin. fantastic restaurants, pubs, and coffee shops all close by. even the post office is around the corner.",5,2022,06,08
231,"NO PARKING - it says ""parking"" but it is not the hotel's and not free.  it is a public parking 5-6 minutes walk away","It is a big hotel near the heart of Dublin, rooms are ok but the beds kept moving with the slightest push.
There are better located hotels if you are interested in the pubs area, this one is located near the shopping area.
Breakfast was mediocre at best, the food was cold and a lot of the times things ran out.
The main issue with this hotel is they say they have ""parking"", but it is a public parking about 5-6 minutes walk that the hotel covers 50% of. Still cost us 12 euros for the overnight parking.",2,2022,06,08
231,Good hotel is a good location,"Over our years of visiting Europe, we've learned that it's important that your lodging be located close to where you'll be arriving into the city. Jury's Inn couldn't be better in that regard, being little more than a block from the bus/train station. In addition, it's a good lodging for central Belfast -- close to a lot of things of interest.

Our room featured a phone, full bath (REALLY appreciated on a trip to Europe), fridge, in-room safe, hair dryer, iron & board, kettle, and TV with 77 channels. It was clean & well-maintained. Staff was efficient, friendly, and quick to assist when we needed help in our room. Wifi was free. 

A coin laundromat (hard to find in Europe) is just two blocks away. The Belfast Visitor Center, innumerable restaurants, city hall -- the center point for city buses, and the start point for Hop On buses -- are also nearby.

Belfast doesn't try to hide the agony of The Troubles but, as those days are now in the past, it is now a vibrant & fun city to visit. Jury's Inn would be hard to top as a place to enjoy this place.",5,2022,06,06
231,Mini Marathon stay,"Stayed for 1 night before the Women's Mini Marathon,  very convenient location, close to Luas.  Got a lovely surprise of goodie bags on check out which were being given to participants in the mini marathon, a little treat greatly appreciated.",4,2022,06,05
231,Please be aware if you book this hotel with Booking.com the full payment will be taken at the time of booking.,I booked rooms for three families and the cost of the booking was taken from my account as soon as I made the booking. This caused my card account to be short of funds until I was able to sort out separate payments for the rooms from each of the families. This also appeared to be 'difficult' for the recepionist to arrange when we arrived at the hotel.,2,2022,06,05
231,Good choice for a short city break,"Good value hotel which is located just off Grafton Street.  Friendly staff, rooms were clean and comfortable.  We didn’t eat breakfast but it looked good as we walked past! We were able to leave our cases after check out which was helpful.  A good choice for a short city break.",4,2022,05,28
231,Wonderful staff!,"All of the staff are wonderful. The breakfast was great with a varity of food. The room was very tired and in need of updating, otherwise it was clean. The tv was tiny. The beds wete comfortable  for sleeping",3,2022,05,25
231,Fantastic staff. Terrible bedrooms,"Reception staff were welcoming and friendly. Reception itself was modern and clean. 
However the standard of bedrooms badly let this hotel down. 
Our room was of adequate size but badly needed the stained and dirty carpet replaced, as well as the smelly sofa and desk that was covered in dried glue. 
The bathroom was clean but again needed the damaged and decaying bath panel replacing, as well as the dirty and stained shower curtain. Attention to the mouldy grouting between the tiles would also be necessary and overdue.",1,2022,05,24
231,"We enjoyed the food and the worm hospitality , the breakfast are very good. ","Too bad the room is not cleaned every day during the hotel stay.
The sheets weren't replaced during our stay, for throwing the garbage you need to call the reception for sending someone to collect it from out side the door.
Otherwise the hotel could be rated 10-10.

231,Lovely Stay,"Stayed at Jury's Inn Parnell in Dublin and at the Cork location. Great staff and services, clean and spacious rooms. Ate at the Cork location at the service and food was great. Thank you for your contribution to making this holiday special:)",5,2022,05,23
231,Wonderful hotel,"Stayed here for an overnight city break & could not fault it . The reception area is very welcoming , rooms are very comfortable & breakfast was really good. Would highly recommend it to anyone staying in Dublin",5,2022,05,17
231,Comfortable,"May- 4th thru 6th - 2022

This property is located in a great section if town. Located in the Heart of Parnell square. Your cool section off town that has everything you need. Tesco directly across the street and Aldi a skip down the street. Their’s a few shopping centers in the area. You have the tram lines right their for you as well it access the rest of town via by foot or by the tram. The room was comfortable and spacious. Their wasn’t an fan’s with this room like my previous stay at the Jury’s Inn in Cork. But that was fine Air Condition got pretty cold. The Wi-fi performed very well. I was able to work successfully. The bar and restaurant were very nice with the bar having a few of the city streets. My only dissapoinment would be the breakfast buffet. Their wasnt as good as the Breakfast in the Cork Jury’s INN. But overall enjoyed my time their. The staff was very nice and accommodating and That’s always worth 5 stars.",5,2022,05,11
231,Clean your own room!!,"If you reserve at Jury's Parnell street be sure to bring your own cleaning materials if staying longer than one night. Your bed will not be made, nor your bathroom cleaned. If you run out of toilet rolls you need to go to reception. The excuse Covid restrictions, but all restrictions have been lifted but obviously the management of Jurys are not aware or have cut their housekeeping staff. It is only right and proper to state on all your websites advertising your rooms that self cleaning of rooms are required therefore giving customers true transparency. Operational staff are curtious, excellent breakfast.",2,2022,05,10
231,None,"A lovely hotel in the centre of Dublin. So near all shops & transport. Any staff we had dealings with were very friendly & professional. Room was lovely and quiet even though it was so central. Food was good in the bar. Breakfast was good too. Sunday morning was busy so had to wait a little while for some foods, but that didn't matter as it was very nice. Will stay again :)",4,2022,05,01
231,Overpriced and poor quality.,"A tired hotel that badly needs a refurb. The mattress was old and springy. The decor was in need of renewal. The quality of the food at breakfast was second rate. All for the fee of €165 euros for B&B. 
The staff were really nice and helpful but it’s one of those hotels who overcharge for what they offer.",2,2022,04,29
231,Amazing,This place was amazing and they really went all in with customer service here. From check in to check out they really went over their normal duties to make us feel welcomed there for our trip in Ireland.,5,2022,04,26
231,Don’t go here!!!,"There was 3 of us. Me, my wife and my 10 year old daughter staying for a wedding and sightseeing. For starters there were beds for three but everything else was for two. Cups, glasses, teabags, we had to ask for all of these things. We would presume being a family we would be put away from the drunks and prostitutes. First night the neighbours were shouting and swearing until 3 in the morning. 3rd night they were having sex all night and morning. It was horrendous. Being an adjoining room we could hear everything going on to the point that we had to have the tv on loud at 3am just so my 10 year old would stop asking what they were doing. Despite banging on the wall/doors they wouldn’t shut up. I didn’t raise it with staff as 1 it was late and I didn’t want to make it worse or go on any later and 2 I had no confidence in the competence of the staff dealing with the problem. Also throughout the weekend out of our window was the refuse area for the city, which isn’t an issue but all the local thieves go round there to swap stolen goods and smoke crack pipes all day long. Another awkward conversation with my 10 year old. Needless to say we won’t be staying again. Shocking",1,2022,04,26
231,None,Location is fantastic with all shops and bars in short walking distance.  plenty of buses and taxis but you will need change for all the buses as they do not offer change. Jamesones distillary 20 minute walk away and a good experience even just for the history if you do not like whiskey,5,2022,04,26
231,Would definitely recommend if you want to get out and about!,"Great hotel, well located for Dublin City. Its on the route for the bus hop on/off tour and is close to primark and walking distance from the main shopping area of O'Connell street. The breakfast was great and on the floor, there was a cold water or ice machine, which was great for wine in the room. Service was good and staff were friendly and accommodating",5,2022,04,23
231,One night stopover in Dublin ,Excellent hotel would definitely recommend for anyone having a stayover in Dublin. Great staff. Checked in on line. Other hotels please take note. So much quicker. Lovely warm spotless room.Full credit to the housekeeping staff. Room had everything you'd need. Grand breakfast with Excellent staff on duty. Had a lovely stay.,5,2022,04,17
231,Not worth the money,"Not 4-star standard. Room was just moderately clean upon our arrival. No housekeeping during our three day visit. Gym so small that it is not worth mentioning. Crowded breakfast with many things empty. Location is central to centre, but try to find another place to stay",2,2022,04,17
231,Perfect wee break Hotel,"Only in the hotel to sleep! But comfy beds & clean, spacious room. All very clean & perfect for our wee break - esp good location for our hop-on-off bus day, seeing sights of Dublin & visiting some of the city sights. Staff friendly & helpful, good Jury's Inn experience once again :)",5,2022,04,10
231,!,Booked jury’s inn as a last minute due to another hotel cancellation. Called day before arrival booked 3 rooms. Everything perfect. UNTIL  just landed in Dublin City at 2:30pm after travelling 4 hours to get there hotel reception calls telling me that they have over booked and that there was no rooms available. Told me to make my way to the hotel that they would sort us with something. Get to the hotel we are there for about 30 mins back and fourth with reception to be told rooms are available and that to call back in an hour that they where just being cleaned. Fast forward an hour we land back to hotel for the man at reception to be confused can’t find our booking. He gets help from another man for him to tell us that there is actually no rooms available and that they are sending us to another hotel 10mins away. Fine perfect whatever we literally just need a bed to sleep in at this point. he comes back to tell us actually there is rooms available at this hotel that 2 are ready and 1 is still being cleaned. Finally got the keys to the 2 rooms mind you we have a concert to get ready for that starts at half 5 check in should have been at 4 we don’t get the keys until 5:10pm. Charged us €259 per room and they absolutely weren’t worth it. Total disaster.,1,2022,04,10
231,Not a Good Experience,"After the first day we noticed the room was not cleaned, the towels were not changed and the trash was not removed. I checked with the front desk and they said the rooms were only cleaned every four (4) days. Every 4 days? I have never heard or seen this in a hotel. We had to take our towels down to the front desk to get new towels and bring our trash down to the front desk for disposal.  The person manning the reception desk did not display any empathy or interest in helping. Just repeated the current policy. I have stayed in hotels all over the world and have never had this type of service. 

In addition one of the cleaning staff daily left two bottles of water and two biscuits in a white bag outside our hotel door. After 4 days we had a collection of water and biscuits. Appears no one ever checked the room to see if we were using the items.

Another interesting situation. I changed my original booking by one day.  A refund was due.
I tried to check out on line. The software would not let me check out.  When I ask the person at the reception they said because I had changed my arrival date by one day and was due a refund I could not check out on line.? Why? What has one to do with the other except that the software program is not robust. 

On the plus side the breakfast is good, great location and the hot water shower is excellent.

We have stayed at this hotel at least 4 times flying over from the USA. 

Another inconvenient situation is,  that flying from America, airplanes arrive at Dublin airport 0430-0530. Obviously one arrives at the hotel very early and cannot check in until 4pm. While one can look around Dublin for a while, 11 or 12 hours is a bit much combined with jet lag. There must be some way to check in to a room when one arrives. Surely some type of creative scheme could be worked out to let people check in upon arrival.  This would let your hotel stand out as customer friendly versus other hotels.",3,2022,04,09
231,Excellent,Great location and clean and spacious room. Breakfast was vast although could have been hotter. Nice bar and friendly staff. Would definitely recommend for visiting Dublin as convenient for access to transport links and city centre,5,2022,04,09
231,"Decent Hotel, Good Location","Standard level of comfort & amenities one would expect from a mid-range hotel chain. Rooms are comfortable & clean, likewise the bathroom, if ever so slightly old-fashioned. Location is highly convenient, very central with easy access to Temple Bar, the GPO. (Small tip - when approaching the hotel for the first time, go via O’Connell Street, so that you turn left into Parnell Street to get to the hotel. We came via the adjacent street, which is less …salubrious and maybe not the best aspect of Dublin if you’re a first time visitor.) Other reviews have mentioned the thinness of the walls and I would have to agree - we heard our neighbour’s alarm on more than one occasion! Wasn’t a problem for us, but might have been had they been noisier, or is staying with young children. Overall recommended, at the right price.",4,2022,04,09
231,Nice hotel,"Location was excellent for commuting in and out the city centre.  Rooms were spacious and very clean. Bed was a bit uncomfortable for me but nothing that couldn't be solved with a topper mattress.  Breakfast was absolutely fantastic,  and the service both in the restaurant and bar was fabulous.  Bar prices were surprisingly less expensive than the pub prices around Dublin.  Noise from traffic on the main road took a bit of getting used to in the morning but it was ok. Fabulous hotel, well worth a visit.",5,2022,04,07
231,Perfect place with a perfect price,"Loved the place, the location, the room, the beds were super comfortable and clean. The Staff was really nice and super courteous, both at arrival and on check out. I will always come here when I come to Dublin! Location is literally in the City Centre, good restaurant if you need and excellent pub going until 1 am (if I'm correct). Strongly suggest to book the breakfast too as hardly you can get anything better in the city for the same price. 5 star and I will make sure me back here in the future.",5,2022,04,07
231,Noisy fan in room spoiled the sleep and no call pick-up or call back from reception!,"· The fan in the room was making a lot of noise over the night even if I switch on or off the the air conditioner thermostat. I tried changing all the settings in thermostat switch but the fan continued to make a lot of noise in the room so that I could not sleep. I called the reception almost 6 times in the night from the room phone but it was always giving an engaged tone and surprisingly nobody called me back. Since it was already night and in half sleep, I could not dress up and go downstairs to reception physically myself ! At the end I had to use earbuds to get rid of noise myself and get some light sleep. When I told this in the reception while checking out in the morning ( huge noise of the fan overnight, nobody picked up the phone even after ringing 6 times or no call backs etc.), all I heard from the front desk staff that a standards"" we are sorry for the inconvenience and will have someone check"". There was absolutely no gesture of compensation or any discount ! I would not call this as customer service after losing sleep even after paying for accommodation.",1,2022,04,04

The Bedroom (229) Is Very Tired & Looks Nothing Like The Photos. It Was A Disabled Room For Some Reason Which Has A Walk In Shower Which Is No Issue However The Seat In The Shower Won’t Stay Folded Away So Was A Bit Of A Mission To Have A Shower & Then The Bathroom Floor Was Soaked. The Bed Had No Valance On It & Looked Like A Put Up Bed. Breakfast Area Was So Cold Toasters Etc Not Even Switched On. Not Great",3,2022,03,29
231,Avoid,"Check in was awful, the guy on reception (short Indian sounding guy) they don’t wear name badges which is why I’m describing. He was super rude and when the payment wasn’t going through on my partners phone he said loudly “it’s not the machine, I just had someone use this machine” we were so embarrassed. 

We got woken up by someone entering our room at around 7 am, they left. Then they called us at 10am and woke us up again! And finally they called again at 11:55 to supposedly apologise? I would have appreciated the apology except we were checking out in 5 minutes and I they woke us up twice so paired with the really rude receptionist I left feeling deflated rather then rested.

231,WATCH YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENT !!!,"SImilar to ""laura w wrote a review Feb 2022"" the hotel's booking system needs attention.

My travelling companion tried to book two rooms but his credit card company security department blocked the transaction so he asked me to book. I booked but my credit card company (different to his) also blocked the transaction. What had happened was that Jurys took half the payment twice/ one room at a time which flags up as potential fraud. 

After all the aggravation with the credit card security department I cancelled but only today found the money had never refunded, a month later. 

But believe it or not my companion's booking that was blocked by his credit card appears to have been ""released"" and Jurys have taken his money as well !!! So he is chasing a refund as well.

The american guy at ""central reservations"" was very helpful on the telephone I would have to say.

BUT WATCH YOUR CREDIT CARD  AND BANK STATEMENTS WHEN DEALING WITH THIS HOTEL !!!!",1,2022,03,20
231,Never again,"Where do we begin? We arrived in the early hours of the morning due to the timings of our flight to be greeted by an unenthusiastic man with a clipboard. Think Gunther from friends *if you know you know* . The hotel was an ok size, however the bathroom was not cleaned properly. There were also strange banging noises which sounded like furniture moving. We were quite unsettled by this but went to sleep since we were so tired. 

The next morning we noticed there were breakfast bags laid outside many of the rooms. It became apparent we had been given a room in a corridor full of people quarantining. We went to reception to let them know about the noises and asked to be moved corridors. They did nothing about this. 

We had an unfortunate encounter with the same Gunther character on our last evening who was extremely aggy with us for wanting a midnight snack. Overall, the location was the best thing about the hotel and they did let us leave luggage on the last day. However, due to the unpleasant experiences and encounters with Gunther, we would not recommend staying here.",2,2022,03,18

the toilet has phone in the bathroom, something straight out of Dynasty! 
there were no staff working, one member on reception took 20 mins to check in, even though i got an email asking me to check in online. so that was pointless! 
location is ok, just be careful of crackhead ally next door! 
wont stay again. much better hotels for more competitive prices.",1,2022,03,14
231,Great stay!,"Good location, clean and spacious room. Can't say anything bad about this hotel! We had a room facing the road and there was zero road noise. Great breakfast.

I heard another customer complaining at reception about his bathroom so I wasn’t alone! 

Ordered a drink to the room at reception, after an hour rang reception (no answer after 5 calls) rang bar no answer, was asked to come to bar to get the drink even though the receptionist ordered the drink to be brought I front of me at check in! 

I was also put at the very end room which is not ideal, have to walk so long to lift. Eventually I went down to reception again and ordered drink again. 

I wanted to order food as well but gave up, went to McDonald’s next door instead as it’s probably better service! 

Didn’t even stay for breakfast as I wanted to
Leave as soon as possible. 2 rooms around me were partying most of the night and going room to room. No security or anything to stop the music. 
I checked out early and didn’t even want to get breakfast.

Awful service and the hotel has a lot to work on.",1,2022,03,03
231,None,"Your staff are lovely, especially Conor on the front desk who was excellent - nothing was too much trouble and he was friendly, efficient and welcoming.
The breakfast is also excellent - a really good selection of hot and cold food to please all tastes. My only nit-pick would be to say that some Gluten Free bread options, and refilling the water melon would have made it perfect.",5,2022,03,03
231,Wonderful Experience !!,"My wife and I stayed in this fine hotel for 5 days in February. We had an Executive Double room. The room was spacious and clean. Sleep quality was very comfortable and quiet at night. Bathroom was roomy, plenty of towels and good water pressure. The room was stocked with goodies which the staff replenished daily. The location is fantastic, close to shopping, museums, restaurants, and there is a Tesco across the street and a Lidl's around the corner. Their bar is cozy with a fine food menu. The staff is very helpful and friendly.

When we return to Dublin we will stay here again, except this time longer. We would like to compliment Gabija and Marlena at the front desk and Marie in housekeeping who took care of us on the 4th floor.

231,Great base for exploring Dublin,"It's our third time staying in this hotel, I think that says it all. Great location, convenient for airport and exploring Dublin on foot with theatres, museums and shopping at your doorstep. Excellent buffet breakfast. Too good! The sausages were to die for. A special mention for the housekeeping staff on the third floor who returned a swimsuit I had mistakenly wrapped up in a wet towel. A real touch of kindness. We'll be back!",5,2022,02,27

231,Dublin shopping trip,Lovely hotel and very easy to get to  the hotel from the  train station  staff was very friendly and helpful we found Conor very friendly at our check-in. It was so close to Henry Street  for shopping. We will definitely stay again,5,2022,02,25
231,Mrs,Lovely well located hotel. Our room was great. Everything you need for a relaxed stay. Staff friendly and helpful. Breakfast good plenty of choice. Bar was cosy. Staff in bar great. Very clean. Hand sanitiser dotted around so pleased with this.,5,2022,02,24
231,Accident while staying,"I had stayed at this for two nights with my partner. On our last day I sustained a very serious injury during a accident in the bathroom. I was unconscious for some time and  was not given any help by the “manager” Mohammed. He did not ask how I was when my partner called down for help and assistance; instead he only stated “is the room alright, is the room damaged”. My partner was handed a plaster and a small sterile wipe and was not given any help on where to get ice from so my partner was left frantically searching the hotel for more help.

I was NOT provided any face to face first aid, my welfare was not checked, I was not given any medical advice and NO physical or verbal injury report was done. We were in a country abroad we didn’t know where the nearest medical centre or hospital was, we was not given any advice. I later took myself to the hospital and found that I had a grade two traumatic brain injury, server damage to my face, eye, nose and head. I was told by a trauma consultant that I was very lucky I had not fractured my skull or sustained a bleed on the brain. I have chosen not to upload a photo of my injuries as I don’t want to cause distress to anyone who may view them. The injuries I sustained are may be too graphic to show.

The hotel gave me no help, advice, care or attention. All I would say is that I am lucky I was not alone in the room at the time! If that had been someone more frail and less able I dread to think how they would have been treated. Such inadequate of service, no duty of care or respect for there guests.",1,2022,02,24
231,Birthday stay with my sister,Fantastic stay last night (22nd Feb 22) staff were exceptionally helpful and accommodating. Hotel was absolutely immaculate.

231,MONEY GRABBERS,"Do not stay here!! I made a reservation with free cancellation through booking.com (the hotel handles payment). After cancelling my booking, I was told the refund would be in my account after 10 working days. A month later I still had no refund and the hotel did not answer any of my emails. Nearly 2 months later I had to prove to booking.com that the money was taken from my account and not refunded. As the hotel had no resolution to this, booking.com eventually gave me my money back on behalf of the hotel. I would highly recommend not booking this hotel, unless you want to be waiting months for your money back.",1,2022,02,22
231,Great Hotel very central,"Check in was excellent as you done it all online no waiting around reception . Bedroom very spacious and clean all bed linen and towels are of high standard and quality . Breakfast was excellent great variety and choices, waitress all very helpful.

231,"So reception staff the best, clean staff have to start clean not just change the garbage bags.","Very dirty, only the bed sheet were clean. Windows were so dirty that I could not understand is the day outside or night. Garbage bags were left in hallway near our doors for a 6 hours for sure. Very cold, bathroom cold and look like a 1 star hostel bathroom, but maybe for Irland it is ok.",1,2022,02,16

231,Dissapponting,"Hotel in general was nice, good breakfast. They allowed us to check in early with no extra charge. However was not a pleasant sleep. We stayed two nights, the first night i had to call reception at 1:30am because a couple were SCREAMING at each other for an hour. I doubt we were the only people that reported it. Someone from reception eventually came up and it seemed to settle down. I write this review at 00:15am on a Wednesday morning as I am unable to get to sleep because of what sounds like a party in a room close by. Surely this can be monitored more closely. Will not be staying here again.",3,2022,02,15
231,Over priced and disappointing.,"The online photos make this hotel appear more special than it actually is and the price doesn’t match what’s on offer. In reality, I could have spent €74 less* to stay in Dublin’s Travelodge, and the only difference would be the distance I have to walk to the heart of the city.

I’m not saying that this is a bad hotel by any means, it just didn’t live up to the perception given by the photos or price point. This, coupled with the broken toilet seat and extractor fan, and the ridiculously slow toasters which result in a cold breakfast by the time you’ve waited, left me feeling ripped off and disappointed on what was supposed to be a special Valentines night away.

*based on a similar booking - 1 night stay on a Saturday (4th-5th Mar), standard room with breakfast and free cancellation.
Jury’s Inn via Booking.com - €261
Travelodge - €187",3,2022,02,15
231,Pants !!,"Booked for a 3 day stay for rugby weekend with my fiancée.  Arrived late after the match and a few drinks . Disappointed to find some used ladies underwear on the floor of the room. Mentioned to Dora the manager the next morning. She was Very apologetic and promised a room upgrade if we came back later in the day. When we did go back our room was moved to a floor above but no upgrade. Ultimately mistakes do happen but during covid times cleaning should be thorough and if I had arrived before partner, I could have been in big trouble. Not the standard expected from Jurys!!",2,2022,02,06
231,Wouldn’t recommend,Stayed here for one night. Great central location but unfortunately that’s where the good review ends. Staff very rude and Unaccommodating. Walls paper thin to the point where we could here our neighbor’s snoring. ALL NIGHT LONG. Beds are so small would be a serious push to call a double and the mattress are the cheapest of cheap so much so there’s and indent in the center and you keep rolling into it all night. Breakfast ridiculously expensive if not part of your package and to make things worse when we arrived and paid the extortionate price they started to take the food away 30 minutes before last service. Coffee machine only does instant cheap coffee and all the pastries are pre packed and soggy. Overall a hostel would do just as good of a job. Won’t be returning.,2,2022,02,04
231,Well worth the stay,"This is a cashless hotel so beware. They only take card.
Apart from that, the room was very clean, the beds comfortable and the pillows were even more so.
The bath was a bit short and shallow and the shampoo that was fixed to the wall was too high to reach if you were bathing. The right height for a shower though.",5,2022,02,04
231,DO NOT RECOMMEND,"We were told on arrival the resident bar would be open till 11 30, when we came back after a long day we were told the bar was closed and last orders were 30 mins ago this was at 10pm so we ordered a takeaway (Chinese) to be told be the reception staff that they would not give us plates or cutlery we had to end up using the teaspoons that were there for the tea in our room I am so shocked by this hotels manner and attitude and they definitely don't have the customer in mind once they have your cash for the room the politeness stops. Will never be staying I  a jurys Inn again",1,2022,02,02
231,Nice hotel,"Nice spacious  hotel room. Hotel quiet ,noise from the street could not be heard. Breakfast lovely and great choice. Staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel convenient to all places . Would definitely recommend.",5,2022,02,02
231,Brilliant stay,"The location is fantastic - 5 minute walk from O’Connell Bridge and the Q-Park Spire car park for which the hotel validates the parking ticket for a discounted price.  
The room was nice, plenty of storage and the bed was super comfy!  Didn’t hear any noise from neighbouring rooms and our room looked out onto the courtyard on level 2 so there was no traffic noise apart from the odd emergency vehicle. 
Breakfast was a buffet / self-serve on Sunday and Monday mornings, and on Tuesday we had to order the cooked breakfast but continental was still self-serve.  The sausages were delicious!  Had such a good breakfast every day we didn’t bother having lunch.  
No negatives, I loved my stay and would recommend to anyone, and I will stay again when next in Dublin.",5,2022,02,01

231,Average stay,"Somewhere to get your head down. The bed was comfortable but the room was pretty basic and needed upgrading. Shower decent though. Breakfast experience was varied. First couple of days had ordered taken and cooked but never got the order right, final day buffet out so easier. Easily accessible amenities",3,2022,01,27

231,Excellent hotel,"In Dublin for the weekend with my wife and two kids. Really enjoyed this hotel. Staff were very friendly and very helpful. Room was perfect. Sleeping conditions excellent. Breakfast was excellent. Only things I would mark down for is the parking is a 5 minute walk away and the bar is quiet small. Don’t know why they didn’t open up a small bit of the breakfast area to sit people as a lot of people were left standing. 
Overall I’d definitely recommend this hotel",5,2022,01,22
231,Shocking that this is considered a 4 star hotel!!,"One experience I feel the need to discuss was out dining experience. We arrived down at the restaurant early at 7pm as we were afraid we wouldn’t be able to get food (and couldnt risk going outside the hotel-this was the whole reason we chose a 4 star hotel, we thought it would be fabulous). We sat at a table and ordered 2 pints of guinness. It took 5 minutes to receive out pints, all going fine. Next we ordered 2 more, again, all fine. At about 7:30 we decided we better just order food so our order was taken by the man (who I think was european, all black clothing, a quiet man). We also ordered 2 more pints. 35 minutes passed and no sign of either the food or drinks. At this point we were aware that out 90 minutes was quickly passing by.  We called over the manager (in a suit) and informed him. He seemed not too bothered when we told him we had ordered food and drinks and wanted to check had the order been taken yet as we still didn’t  have them. He returned to the bar (bearing in mind there seemed to be 4 staff on the bar/restaurant floor who seemed to struggle to cope with only 8-10 tables, mainly couples. Drinks for the couple next to us were also slow to come. 5 minutes passed and having not heard back from the manager I went to the bar to ask again about our food where I was quite rudely informed that our “90 minutes is almost up and we will need to leave soon. I quickly informed said manager that as a paying guest who booked this hotel with the intention of eating inside there I would not be able to leave until myself and my partner had eaten the food and drank the last 2 drinks we ordered. We eventually got our food another 20 minutes later, lukewarm pizza with barely any pepperoni on it. The food was alright in fairness. 
However, what we witnessed next is something neither myself nor my partner have never ever experienced nor do we ever wish to experience again. The couple beside us having experienced the same delays with their orders wanted to order their desert before they left. The lady (and her partner) were honestly aggressively told that their “time was up” and “can you see there are more people waiting to eat”. The manager continued to patronise a paying guest and her partner by telling her that she “needs to be kinder to staff”. At this point I almost felt the need to intervene. He continued on his little rant, informing the paying guest who had had a ling day and just wanted her desert to finish off her new years eve that he himself “has been as work since 7 and he has also gad a long day”. 
I think at this point both myself and my partner thought we were being pranked.
The guest kept her composure despite being patronised  by the manager and she quickly deescalated the situation by just requesting the desert she wanted. I don't think he took her order. She seemed genuinely upset, as she should be after paying over €220 for a 4 start hotel on new years eve only to be spoken to by a member of staff in this way. I believe she then went down to the reception to make a complaint and shortly after she returned the deserts they ordered were sent over promptly.
We were STUNNED. Shocked, disgusted at having paid this kind of money to witness this kind of behaviour by a staff member.
The breakfast in the morning (while seated by the lovely kind french girl and assisted in serving by the african lady) the breakfast could only be described as inedible. Again I genuinely believed we were being pranked. The fried egg was rock solid. Only the sausages, cold toast and mushrooms were just about edible. Having paid the extra €40 (€20 each) for breakfast I wish I hadnt!!!!!
When checking out of the hotel (we couldn’t  wait to leave) we exited from the lift at reception only to hear another lady who was checking out. Clearly she had encountered some issues the night before too as when asked by the girl at reception “was everything ok after that?” She replied “No. let’s just put it this way…I will never ever ewver be back and neither will anyone I know”.
That pretty much summed up our own experience. We were glad to leave. The only positive from the entire experience was the fact that when our cards and cash wouldn’t work to pay the parking fee at Q-park the attendant let us exit for free (saving us €27 at least).
I honestly have no words for the entire experience. The WORST hotel/break/stay I have ever experienced ever in my life across several countries. 
I would suggest that the only thing that could remedy this for us would be a full €242.50 refund of what I paid for this.

(Also: I phoned the day to ask abt restrictions and their impact on food serving times and room service. I was told that there was “no need to book for dinner as we don’t normally take bookings”. I was mot made aware at the time that the hotel was infact far too over-booked for the available staff to cater for. (Many must have been close contacts). Again, I was not made aware of just how under staffed they were! The day we arrived and got our key at the desk I asked again about dinner times and only then was I told “It was very busy lastnight and people were queuing for ages to get drinks and food so you might have to  for a long time”. When I phoned the day before and asked about room service I was told it was available. However at check in when collecting the key and when I realised that we may not actually be able to get food I asked about room service and was then told a different answer; that there was no room service. To me, how this hotel has maintained 4 stars is beyond me. I would much rather have been phoned ip and told the hotel was understaffed and given the option to cancel my booking with a full refund rather than waste 3 hours travel each way and pay a whopping €250 plus euro for one night in what I can only describe as shocking service. )

I do not blame the staff per-se for majority of what we experienced. There was an Irish girl working at reception who was as helpful as she could be given the pressure she must have been under an d a lady who I think was French at the breakfast room who was the nicest staff member we came across.",1,2022,01,17
231,None,"Disgraceful to take a booking with no facilities open and to not tell guests until arrival that restaurant is closed & you cannot even order an alcoholic drink on room service.
Booking was direct with the hotel, not a 3rd party website so not good enough to not display this information at time of booking.

Walls very thin, children shouting in corridor gave us an early morning alarm call!",1,2022,01,17
231,"Convenient, central and clean","Hotel conveniently located off O’Connell Street.  Room on 4th floor was clean, quiet and bed was very comfortable so we had a good nights sleep. Not much space between one side of the bed and the wall meant I had to walk sideways to get out! 
Kettle, tea and coffee etc was provided along with hairdryer, iron, ironing board and decent clothes hangers for our stay.  Shower was powerful and water temperature perfect.  
Room though could do with a bit of TLC.  Some carpet stains, bathroom shelf needs tightened, hand towel had large hole in it, needed to call reception as lights kept going off despite keycard in panel and no chairs to sit at small table in corner of room. Few biscuits would have been welcome. 
Reception staff were pleasant and maintenance staff were speedy sorting out lights. 
Great selection for breakfast but unfortunately apart from sausages, the breakfast was not hot.",3,2022,01,16
231,Lovely hotel in a great location,"Brilliant hotel! 
Fantastic location, staff are so friendly and helpful, the breakfast was amazing too! 

Hotel room was lovely, clean and tidy! Great selection of teas and coffees also.  
Lobby smells amazing when you first walk in and for added security you cannot use the lifts unless you have a room key. 

Would certainly stay here again",5,2022,01,05
231,Poor from start to finish,"We were a group of 6 (three couples) attending a wedding.

The reception area is OK, but the rest of the hotel is extremely dated. Our room overlooked an area where water collected and seagulls had nested - so there were bones and all sorts visible from our window (plus really loud noise from the gulls). The rooms were very old (not even a mini fridge) and the beds were terrible. Shower was not particularly clean.

On the day of the wedding, there was no hot water anywhere in the hotel. Guests were only informed of this when we went down to reception (e.g. no email or other notification was given, even though they had known about the issue for several hours). We were offered a shower at their sister hotel across town, which was not a practical solution for our group and I completely appreciate this is not the staff's fault - they were courteous during this time. 

I was promised a full refund for my room, which I still have not received 3 months later. Every time I try and contact the hotel, someone new picks up the matter and I am back to square one - completely unacceptable.

There must be so many better alternatives in Dublin!",2,2022,01,04
231,No noise control and guest comfort,"Rooms were dated, beds were terrible,  and the noise was shocking.  
Staff had no duty of care to their guests comfort
I had two rooms and my teenage son and friend were terrified 
Check in was good reception staff were lovely.",1,2021,12,31

Tv horrendous",1,2021,12,18
231,Food unpalatable.,"The stay was good overall. Room was clean and the ambience in the restaurant was okey. Breakfast wasn't too bad. Staff were nice. 
I wouldn't recommend dining in their retaurant. The food choices was very basic, not one you'd go for a fine dining. I ordered the roast chicken. It was a big portion, but appears very dry still with hair all over it, and the small amount of gravy on the side is watery not even enough for the portion of the chicken. My husband ordered a good portion of salmon sitting on top of a massive portion of cabbage swimming on its own water. 
Both are unpalatable. Cooked very basic with salt. 
We didn't complain that night, as we only want to enjoy our date because it was a Christmas present from our children, but I raised my concern to the Duty Manager (Dolores) the next day and showed her the picture of the chicken with hair.",1,2021,12,17
231,Basic and unhygienic facilties,"I stayed with my sisters in a room for 3 people however only 2 bath towels were provided, one of which had holes in it and wasn't very soft. I phoned reception for another towel but there was no answer the first time I tried. There was scum in the corner of the bath, a dirty looking shower curtain, stains on the bathroom floor and bedroom carpet and the TV unit was dusty. The paintwork was tired and in need of a fresh coat. There was a lot of noise from downstairs or neighbouring rooms late into the night so I couldn't get to sleep for a long time and was rudely awoken at 6am by the Dublin City Council bin lorries with loud noise for a couple of hours as the depot was outside the bedroom window! Going down for breakfast I didn't have my phone on me so couldn't provide my covid passport which was fine so I ran back up to the room for it, only to come back down with it to then be asked for ID also (which I didn't have on me). This should have all been asked for at check-in to make breakfast more enjoyable. Breakfast was a buffet served by 1 lady who was struggling to keep up with the number of people. She was having to make toast while serving the hot food. The toast was cold and burnt and there were no trays so we had to go back up for tea. A better experience would have been for staff to serve tea/coffee and toast to the table for us. We left with a grubby feeling and weren't impressed. We'll not be back.",2,2021,12,16
231,I would say this hotel is OK but next time we might try another one. Cleaners are doing a good job. Convenient for the centre of,"I wrote my review then tripadvisor lost it.
This hotel was ok. I probably wouldn't go back merely due to the strong smell of perfume in the aircon in reception and being unable to get our free coffee midmorning when we wanted it.
The room was large and clean and the bed was comfy but the bathroom soap dispenser didn't work and I burnt myself turning the shower off. 
",3,2021,12,16
231,"Good location, but basic hotel","The bathroom was very old and basic for a 4 star hotel. The climate control didn't work properly, it was too cold or too hot. The rooms are not cleaned during the stay with the excuse of the COVID-19. On the positive side, the staff was friendly and the location is very convenient, only 5 minutes walking to the airport bus and 10 minutes to the main attractions.",2,2021,12,16
231,None,"Yes. We ordered a starter and main course off the menu. When the food arrived we were given both starters and main course at the same time. We were told that nothing could be done, I asked for the main courses to kept hot.
The starter of breaded shrimp/prawns were to say the least awful, for a supposed quality hotel they looked like they were frozen product from ICELAND.
When we did get our main meals, the quality of the Lasagne was like dried up cardboard and dog food. Staff were apologetic but this did not make up for a terrible experience. Our overall bill came to about 50euros, this included a free pint (I paid for 2 ), 10% discount and we did not pay for the Lasagne. In my opinion I would have been better off going to Burger King.

I also paid an extra 10euro each to get complimentary paper etc, no paper and had to ask for our vouchers.

Overall rooms were fine, staff were ok ,location great, drinks selection in bar poor, parking discount great..
Would I stay again, maybe, but I would not upgrade, would not buy food or drink, but just stay for location.",1,2021,12,13

Breakfast was a good selection of items, however the cooked items could have been warmer
The bar area was comfortable and reasonably priced.
Room was clean and spacious with a superb bed.
My only criticism would be the check in time of 4.00.
Granted, we were welcome to leave our bags in a secure room, but after arriving on an early flight at 9.30, it’s a long time to kill before being allocated a room",4,2021,12,10

231,Great hotel in a great location,"Arrived around 12, could not have a early check in but the staff offered to keep our luggage, give us a ring when the room was ready and gave us some information to where we could get some great food. The room was nice, but no fridge and could not figure out the AC. The best part of the hotel was definitely the staff! And i want to give a HUGE shout out to Connor, i so wish i could be a fly on the wall during your holiday in Hemsedal - hope you survive! Much love your Norwegian friends.",4,2021,12,06
231,Dublin city centre visit,"My wife and I are in our sixties and we visit Dublin once or twice a month. We have stayed a few times in the Jury's hotel on Parnell Street. Each visit was very pleasant,  safe and friendly. The hotel is perfectly located for a walk around the city or a trip by Luas, Dublin's tram system. Food, bar, hotel service are all beyond reproach. The staff are very professional.  We have stayed in other hotels around the city but this is the best.",5,2021,12,03
231,Horrible customer service,Horrible staff. They cancelled my room and I never got a refund. Their policies are very strict and their customer service is rigid. As for as hospitality goes this might be the worse experience I’ve ever had anywhere. I highly urge that no one stays here.,1,2021,12,02
231,Door keys unreliable,"The hotel is in an excellent position to visit Dublin but there are a few niggles, the most serious of which is the door card which provides entry to your room, lighting and access to use of the lifts.  There for two nights and three times I had to go to reception to get a new card.  I was told that it was because it had been near a mobile phone.  Not so, on the third occasion I used it to enter my room and then went to my partner's room and when time came to go to bed the card would not work.  A better method is needed.

Room spotlessly clean, good bath / shower but if taking a bath it is annoying to have to stand up just to press the soap dispenser.  May be a small tablet of soap in the soap bowl would help.  Breakfast of acceptable quality and ingredients of a good range.  Car parking not on site but a 10 minutes walk away.  Allow €15 a day on top of hotel daily rate.  All in all good value.

",3,2021,12,01
231,"Great location, and helpful staff","A positive note - we had the room next door playing loud music beginning at almost 1AM, again at 2AM and 3AM and the staff was very helpful at getting them to stop their partying finally at 3AM.

We have stayed at this hotel in the past and never had problems with party goers in the room next to us.  

We love the location of the hotel, near everything we enjoy.  Drop off for AirCoach is right around the corner, and the Heritage Bar & Grill is located in the next block, a great pub.

They are doing their best to provide a nice breakfast experience during Covid and the variety of items is still very good.",4,2021,11,27
231,??,"Disappointed with room , especially given expensive cost. Poor breakfast experience, self service understandable but no help in finding missing Essentials. Strange taste from Tea cups and disappointing service",3,2021,11,24
231,A midweek break.,Excellent location for shopping and sightseeing. Rooms are spacious and spotless. Beds are really comfortable. The staff are very friendly and always willing to help. We will definitely be staying here again. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. ,5,2021,11,24
231,No services but nice location,"The hotel itself is in a great location for all the sights of Dublin city.  
The Lobby was clean and comfortable and the staff that checked me in were very friendly and helpful.

However during my stay I feel a few things could have been better.
There are over two hundred rooms in this hotel, and they are serviced by three small elevators.
One of the elevators was out of service forcing us to have to wait for the two remaining to return to reception constantly.   When thy did arrive, they proved to only hold a few people at a time and considering we are in a pandemic it did not seem such a good idea to pack the lift.
Often we would have to wait longer for space to become available.
I was told upon check in that there is no cleaning service but if I wanted the room cleaned, I would have to arrange it at reception.  Also, I was told that any towels etc. I needed I just had to call reception and they would be sent to my room.   The flaw in this was many times I would ring reception only for the call to be ignored.  Effectively meaning I would have to go searching for a maintenance cart and get the towels and supplies myself.  I found this time consuming and frustrating as the carts could be anywhere in the building.
Also what was failed to mention is that all food from room service was not available despite a sign in the room claiming it was.   This was not a big problem as you could just pick it up from the kitchen yourself, but I would have liked the option.
There were vending machines on each floor along with an ice machine.  I have no idea why an ice machine was supplied when none of the rooms seemed to be equipped with ice buckets.  Also, the vending machines themselves were pretty bare and looked like they had not been restocked for some time.   
As much as I am aware that Covid has curbed a lot of facilities in hotels I can’t help feel that it is also used as an excuse to hire less staff and suspend services unnecessarily 
i.e. I can have towels brought to my room but not a sandwich?

Overall it is a nice hotel and a great location, but it appears to be lacking in staff and services.
The rooms are clean and comfortable.  No microwaves, safes or mini-fridges are supplied and as a person who often has longer stays, I would have liked the use of them.
The bar is lovely, and the food was very good.

A great spot but just know what you are getting before booking.",3,2021,11,24
231,Great location,Enjoyed our stay at this great located hotel for one night . Service desk male was so helpful and friendly and even helped us with tourist map . Beds so comfy. Had a room on third floor that faced the courtyard and was really quiet. Would stay there again if in Dublin.,4,2021,11,23
231,Shocking service!,I booked a trip for my daughter and her partner to Dublin. My daughter has Coeliac disease so has to follow a strict gluten free diet. The package included breakfast. On the first morning there was nothing for her to eat so they said they would refund her the full money and for her to go and get breakfast outside. She has finally received an email today from Dolores who only offered her 10 euros not the 22 euros when she was promised the breakfast money back. I’m not sure what part of the 12 euros she thought she had! Disgusting that in 2021 a large company can’t accommodate food allergies and the after customer service is disappointing. Don’t waste your time going here.,1,2021,11,15
231,None,After a flight from Rome into Dublin late at night. Arrived at the hotel at almost 12am. Was very tired and hungry. The guy who was at the check-in was quite rude to me which made me very comfortable. I think you can improve your staff's customer service skills.,2,2021,11,06
231,Very disappointed in Jurys.,"My husband and I  stayed in Jurys for two nights on 28\29th of October this year. The booking was made in 2019 as we had tickets for a concert which was cancelled and rescheduled a number of times during lockdown as was our hotel booking. On check in we asked if we needed to book a table for dinner as we were short on time .The receptionist told us we could book but did not need to. She also told us that the bar was open until 11.30pm.
We arrived at the bar which was the only area serving food, at about 7pm .A sign stated "" please wait to be seated"" which we did. All the tables were occupied although one table became free during our wait. None of the three staff acknowledged us or the three people queuing behind us until after 15 minutes my husband asked a staff member for a table. He told us we would have to wait until a table became free but we could buy a drink whilst waiting but would have to sit outside the bar while we waited. When asked about the empty table he said it was reserved. We left and dined in a restaurant opposite the hotel as did the three other people who were in the queue. We came back to the hotel after our meal to order a taxi to the concert and asked to book a table in the bar for dinner on the following night. The same receptionist who dealt with us on check in said that the bar does not take bookings.
We returned to the hotel at 11.05pm and decided to go to the bar for a nightcap. It was closed and in total darkness. The next day we had a lovely meal in the bar. No queue this time although when I asked for a particular table I was told it was reserved for ""staycations"". Service was friendly and prompt. We charged our bill to our room as we had an e-voucher credit to spend.  On returning to our room after dinner reception rang literally as soon as we entered the room and asked for details of the e-voucher. As reception confirmed this e-voucher on check in we were puzzled as to why they needed details at this late hour ,and why this could not be dealt with on check out. 
On checking out we complained about the issues we had encountered. The manager apologised. She told us they had sorted the confusion about the e-voucher. She confirmed the bar do not take dinner bookings unless a meal is included in the booking. She took details of my mobile phone number and email address and told me someone would ring me that afternoon the to discuss the complaints. Today my husband received a customer satisfaction survey from Jurys to fill in as the booking was in his name. I am still waiting for them to contact me by phone or email a week after the complaint was made.
We have been regular customers of Jurys over the years and have always felt their standards are high. I have stayed in this hotel twice this year and also Jurys in Belfast in June this year but I cannot say the high standards apply to Jurys Parnell street.
When we stayed in Jurys Parnell street for one night in September this year. I checked in online and was asked for a payment. I cannot remember the exact amount as this was another booking made pre pandemic for a concert which was cancelled and rescheduled along with the hotel reservation but think it was about 89 euros. We were unsure if we had paid the full amount for the room at  time of booking so I paid the amount requested. On arrival at the hotel the receptionist told us there was a credit on our account the exact amount of the payment requested on online check in.  The receptionist could not understand  why I was asked for a payment which was then applied as a credit on our account. I later asked for the money to be refunded to my credit card which was processed. On checking out the following day we were told that we owed the amount which had been refunded. We had not made any charges to our room during our stay so we knew we had no bill to pay. When we explained about this payment and refund to a manager he told us there was nothing to pay. I felt this experience was a misunderstanding and thought no more about it until our latest experience in Jurys.
However now I feel that there are obviously major problems with staff information, communication and following up complaints. I also wonder if there is a problem with staff computer skills or does the booking and payment computer programme need an upgrade ?

Also one lift was out of order when we arrived. The following morning when a lot of guests were checking out another customer told us that two out of three lifts were out of order and customers were waiting a long time for the lift. At one stage during our stay we heard a member of staff at reception say that there were people trapped in a lift as a number of staff ran towards the stairs.",2,2021,11,05
231,Amazing experience and hospitality!,"I just have to go out of my way to thank Conor for all the help he gave my daughter and I while we stayed at this hotel. From helping us with checking our luggage, to electrical problems (our fault) to advice, directions, suggestions and getting us a last minute Covid test when our packed covid tests were recalled. The last day we were there he got us a last minute taxi. Always with a smile and always genuinely acted interested in us and our wellbeing. He made our experience amazing and made us feel like we weren't alone on the last leg of our world travels. What a great guy and amazing service. I hope he gets many large raises in the future.",5,2021,11,05
231,Enjoyed our stay,"Stayed here in October with my daughter. The room was clean and warm the bed was very comfy we had a lovely sleep and woke up feeling refreshed. I didn't like that the hotel didn't take cash for anything this made things a little awkward but i suppose with covid cashless it safer. That is the only downfall for me, otherwise we enjoyed our stay and the man at reception was very helpful and kind. The location was perfect for us close to alot of clothe shops and right across from Tesco. There is alot of place at there doorstep to go to eat if you dont want to eat in the hotel. We will definitely return again and look forward to it 👌😊",4,2021,11,05
231,"Perfect location, but not perfect standard.","The location is perfect in the center of Dublin. We had our rooms at 4th floor to a backyard and it was very quiet. We had 2 adjoining rooms that we got unlocked between which was perfect for a family. The beds were comfortable. The hotel is quite worn down with not so fresh carpets in corridor and rooms, and the air conditioning was only working in one of the rooms and the toilet was very noisy when flushing. The cleaning of the room was ok, but not more. We didn’t try the restaurant.",3,2021,10,30
231,Loud  drunks  mouldy rooms this is place  for you,"Mould  surrounded  window in room

2  night out of  3 we  were  woken to the  sound  of drunks  next door  fighting  shouting  from 2.30am to 4am 

When going for  breakfast  don't  go at peak  time  the lady serving  breakfast  is that slow  there  a backlog    in a  que   which is  unnecessary  

Jury's   standards  has  definitely  slipped 

Reception  disd  ask if  I wanted  to  speak to someone  about  the issues  I felt its gone  beyond  that !",2,2021,10,29
231,Great staff,"We stayed here for three nights during the week and the experience was fantastic all round. I would like to give a special mention to the staff however. While everyone was great there were two lads in particular that truly stood out. I met Lee and Adam working in the hotel bar (Thursday night, 21st). The lads were brilliant at their jobs and were more than attentive. We were above in Dublin celebrating our sons birthday and the lads were kind enough to give me suggestions on where we could go, how to get around, what to see and also just answered any questions I had. It was this genuine interaction that made the stay for me!",5,2021,10,29
231,You must check out this Hotel if traveling to Dublin!,"The value outweighed the price we paid, the balance was pretty offset. 

Excellent service, the room was as clean as a hound’s tooth and the premise was cozy, well-lit with a contemporary lobby design.

Loved every bit of it. I really appreciate the work you guys are putting in, keep it up.",5,2021,10,28
231,Jury's hotel,Hotel room was nice. Staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good but there was no fresh fruit on one of the days - that was my only disappointment. Nice hotel and close to shops. Would recommend the hotel.,5,2021,10,23
231,Great rooms in the heart of Dublin,"We enjoyed our stay at Jurys Inn and found the location terrific. Very convenient. Clean and quiet. 
We will probably stay here again when we return to Dublin. 
Check in and check out was simple. Would like to see the mask requirement enforced in the lobby and on the elevators.",4,2021,10,22
231,Perfect location! Wonderful staff. Our room was facing the river has beautiful view however a little noisy. ,"Fantastic location and service. Parking at hotel as we know was expensive therefore we found alternative parking less than 10mins walk to hotel at ""train station south car park"" for 24hrs less than €10. Breakfast was good. Overall, excellent! Highly recommended. ",5,2021,10,22
231,Good Mid-range Hotel Near Public Transportation,"We spent three nights in the hotel, and were pleased with our room. We overlooked the building site next door, and we didn't have issue with construction noise. There's two green LUAS stops close by and most buses stop on O'Connell Street around the corner, making it very good for getting around the city. The bed was okay,  harder than expected, though the pillows were not firm enough for me. It was fine. My only complaint was that there is no refrigerator nor microwave in the room. Besides that, the staff was polite, professional, and helpful during the two times I interacted with them.",4,2021,10,21
231,6.45am building site noise,"The hotel is next to a building site. The drilling and hammering began at 6.45am. This is actually illegal. When we called the front desk we were told “There’s a building site next door, sorry about that” by an enthusiastic member of staff. If the hotel are aware of the noise then they need to take it up with builders and put guests in rooms that are not affected.",1,2021,10,19
231,Adam in the restaurant. Top lad,"Dinner @ 8pm 18th October in the bar restaurant.Adam in the restaurant was great. Really friendly, not just with us but all the guests. A definite keeper for the hotel. A real asset to the hotel. He was very attentive and gave plenty of recommendations for places to visit whilst in Dublin. We didn't get the name of his colleague but she was also very attentive.",5,2021,10,18
231,"Average Room, Amazing DM Mohammed and Rude Night Auditor. ","So I went for my Birthday with a colleague of mine. To our surprise, we were given handicapped room the first time without explaining the directions or anything about our package or room. Later, when we called, we were asked to come down to reception and was given another room which was dirty, had moulds on the roof and red hair on the bed. After calling 3 times to the reception and waiting for 45 mins, DM Mohammed along with Lady Manager and Accomodation Supervisor came. The room was smelling very bad coz the bins were full and stinking. The issue was addressed very well by the managers, especially DM Mohammed. The only disappointing thing after that was the Night Auditor who misbehaved with my friend as he went down around 10:50pm to the front desk to ask if some cookie/pastry can be arranged to surprise me. The guy walked away and told him no and asked him to go to the room. He seemed more like a bouncer and was very rude. He then started talking to other guests while my friend was still talking to him, he basically walked away. We were very happy untill this incident happened. Anyways felt like letting you guys know how unprofessional and scary that was for us. We have the images for the room too, but as the issue was very professionally handled and solved, we don't think it's accurate to post anything. Thanks Mohammed again for looking after us so well. Another thing which was missing was Halal food options as my friend is a Muslim but the hotel had no options for him, had to eat out most of the times. ",3,2021,10,18
231,Great location,"The hotel is very close to the city centre, which makes it easy to go around. We were able to check in quite early (11AM) and also do an early check out(6AM), so we really appreciated that.  Apart for this, the room was fairly standard, comfy bed, good shower water pressure.

We stayed only for a short while, but overall it was a great stay.",5,2021,10,12
231,Short but very sweet stay,Stay on a Saturday night with my sister. The hotel was great and really close for the aircoach bustop for Belfast. Lovely big spacious room and a great breakfast the next day. Easy stroll to Grafton Street and Temple bar area. All staff very friendly and helpful - many thanks everyone.,5,2021,10,11
231,Highly recommended,"Lovely room, the staff were very helpful and let us check in early and leave our bags after we checked out, ideally situated for the shops and public transport.
I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone, best nights sleep I’ve had for a long time",5,2021,10,09
231,Good centrally located hotel in Dublin centre . ,"Pleasant and efficient staff and great shopping  location with access to local restaurants and cinemas. 

Very good transport access via bus and tram. 

Facilities were well up to standard, and dining facilities and breakfast was very good and reasonably priced.

231,Pleasant,"Pleasant stay, clean friendly, great location, Breakfast was Good Reception did there best to check me in on early arrival which was much appreciated.

The location is ideal for exploring Dublin but quiet enough to get some rest.",4,2021,10,05
231,None,"The lovely girl on reception upgraded us to an executive room and this definitely enhanced our stay at Jurys Parnell.
Very comfortable bed and I enjoyed the fluffy white towels.
Breakfast was much better than I anticipated and I considered that it was good value for 11 euros  if the room rate did not include breakfast. Lovely to have the buffet experience again.
Hotel has a good location and we would stay again .",4,2021,10,04
231,Perfect location!,"Great location away from the noise, but close enough to be in on the action. Clean & very comfortable beds. Clean, decent sized room. Friendly, helpful staff. What more do we need. Strict COVID measures in place. Will definitely return.",5,2021,10,04
231,Good stay,"Stayed here for a couple of nights.  good location for what we were wanting to visit everything within 10-20 mins walk, if you don’t like walking there are trams/buses at the end of the road. Check in was easy we did it online, staff were very helpful. I would stay here again, like any hotel you use it as a base for sleeping and showering, we didn’t take the breakfast option as we prefer to eat out.",4,2021,10,02
231,The invisible Hotel,"Almost impossible to find as it's google maps address sends you to a very dodgy alley behind the hotel (Moore Street I believe).

As I wasn't particularly in the mood to buy what I can only imagine was delicious crack cocaine
I declined the kind offers of the denizens thereof.

Eventually one of these drug addled knackers said I think its over the road from Tesco which (if only it said so on your website would have been most helpful.

So you end up going round in circles via a baffling one way system and have to ask taxi drivers where it is and then even half of them don't now

Here's an idea for you,

Why don't you have some signage at a level below 60 feet (5th Floor) ? in the air so those of us who arrive by private car don't have to waste almost an hour going round in circles for an age trying to find the front door

Unless I was arriving via light aircraft, helicopter , parachute or Airship, the chances of finding this place is remote at best

No parking either

Nowhere near good enough",1,2021,10,01
231,Great stay,A nice clean hotel room friendly staff and a buffet breakfast what more could you ask for in the city centre easy to find trams stop outside 5 minute walk to aircoach to the airport close to bars and shops,5,2021,09,29
231,It is a 3 star hotel! Not 4 starts!,"Bathroom amenities are very poor and cleaning of the bathtub was very bad... There was black mold in the bathtub! The location is very good but you can get better prices for better quality also in well-located hotels... This is truly a 3 star hotel, not 4!! the breakfast is okay, nothing special... there is not much selection of food/drinks.",3,2021,09,29
231,Beware of poor parking instructions!,"We stayed here for 4 nights...would not recommend. Carpets were dirty, room was okay - nothing special, and the bathroom could use an upgrade. Breakfast was good though! If you have a car, get very specific instructions from the front desk on parking! When we checked in, we were given an address for a parking garage and told that we could get 50% off, no other instructions or information. Well, when we left the parking garage the first time, we weren't given a receipt to show that we paid, so we went to the front desk of the hotel to explain, and they said to bring the paper receipt from the parking garage after you pay. So we saved all the paper receipts, and when it came time to check out, the person at check-out told us that wasn't the case and we should have brought the ticket you get when you first park your car and there was no way they could give us the 50% off. Very frustrating to say the least.",2,2021,09,29
231,Good Location in Dublin,"Easy access for airport bus and just round the corner from  O'Connell Street and a 10 min walk to Temple Bar.

We arrived around 1pm and we're able to check in straight away. Room was spacious and had everything we needed for a short stay. Breakfast was buffet with a good selection available.",5,2021,09,27

231,Very comfortable stay and excellent service at the restaurant,We stayed for one night three weeks ago as a stop over. Room was clean and very comfortable.

231,Customer Satisfaction.,"On arrival we checked in and went to room ..
1. Couldn’t make out the extra treat we were getting … Later discovered it was a view 😂😂..
2. After an hour discovered no air conditioning. Reported it straight away 24 hours later by chance saw engineer who took 5 mins to sort out . 
3 In morning NO HOT water which wasn’t going to be resolved at least until Monday morning 24+ hours later . We then had to be transferred to another hotel .. having booked the Guiness brewery , so couldn’t wash or have breakfast 😏",2,2021,09,12
231,Disappointed,"Quite disappointed to be honest, was told at check in that we could have a clean during the stay as we were staying a week, all we had to do was let them know when we would be out all day and wanted the room cleaning.  Went to reception the following night to as for a room clean on the Tuesday as we would be in Galway all day only to be told there was no room cleaning, this is OK if all the staff sing off the same hymn sheet, don't tell us we can have the room cleaned if we can't.  Breakfast was OK when we got it intact, a breakfast bag was delivered every morning between 6.30am and 7am and left outside the room.  On more than one occasion either everything was just thrown in the bag or the bag thrown down, fruit pots were often upside down causing the juice to leak so when you went to lift the paper bag the bottom fell out, other times the yoghurt pot had split so everything in the bag was covered in yoghurt! Now to the bar, by far the worst pint of Guinness we had in 7 days in Dublin, did not taste nice at all and god only knows what barrel they attached to the Coors pump but it really did not taste like Coors. ",2,2021,09,11
231,Could have been so much better,"Arrived for an 11 night stay to be told the room would not be cleaned for a week and at that time we would have to change own beds . I can change a bed no problem but I have never had same sheets for a week in any hotel I have stayed in. Reason for this ,Covid.
After a few days the small room and small bathroom became grubby and we asked for it to be cleaned . Reluctantly they agreed however on returning to the hotel it had not been done.
On approaching reception they said possibly tomorrow. I advised that since we were having to approach housekeeping staff in corridors to ask for the basics, fresh towels , toilet paper. This was not acceptable.
After I pointed out that I fully understand that covid restrictions make things more complicated basis services should still apply. When I  asked if the reduction in housekeeping service would be reflected In the price suddenly was offered a full clean the next day.
This was carried out but not to a high standard , however they did change the bedding.
For remainder of stay still had to hunt dow trolleys in corridors for towels etc.
Over all public areas were clean enough but hotel had no atmosphere .
Staff seems disinterested.
We ate in the restaurant one night, food was to me a preprepared offering simply reheated. Ate out after that.
All I can say is the hotel seeded it’s purpose .
I could not recommend it to others and would not return. I feel now that Covid is being blamed in many places for what used to be just poor service.",2,2021,09,10
231,"Extremely disapponted with our 4 Night stay in this Hotel, would definitely not Staycation in Ireland again,.","There were 5 ladies in my group, we  booked adjoining rooms with breakfast included.  We  got an email the day before we arrived to say breakfast would be delivered to our room which would be  a continential   breakfast or we could avail of a breakfast roll/bap downstairs.  When we arrived at the hotel we were informed that not only was the breakfast roll/bap not available but that our rooms would not be serviced for the 4 days stay.   The breakfast was delivered in a paper bag and consisted of porridge, yogurt, fruit, orange juice and cakes.   We  had expected at least the continental breakfast would be delivered in a Tray with fresh Tea/Coffee and a proper continental  breakfast.   We had to phone reception on several occasions to request fresh towels, tea, coffee, toilet paper etc.  as they ignored some requests.  

I personally think a number of hotels  in Ireland are  jumping on the band waggon as they  say  with regard to Covid as I have stayed in other hotels who provide a full service to rooms together with a delicious breakfast selection with no issues.

The carpet in the rooms and  also in the corridors could  have done with a  good cleaning and in general the room  was not very clean .

They advise us to staycation at home in Ireland but I have to say the experience last year and  this year has definitely not convenience me that we get value for money at home.",1,2021,09,08
231,"Filrthy room, bedsheets not changed after previous guest. Avoid!","The room was filthy dark and tiny for a family room, nothing like the pictures show. There were marks on the mirror in the room and bathroom, the double bed wasn’t changed, there were bedsheets after previous guest! (only the single bed had clean sheets), trash on the floor, toothpaste spead on the bathroom glass shelf, bathroom floor not cleaned. We asked for a room change but were waiting for ages being ignored so eventually we decided to find another hotel accomodation and left the hotel. Still awaiting refund-was told that the refund will be processed but no mention about the late check out fee of €30 which we paid on arrival before we saw the room.
It was our family weekend away and instead on enjoying the short stay we wasted time on waiting for a room change and then because nothing was happening, on finding available hotel accomodation last minute and moving to a different clean Hotel ( Maldron Hotel which was beautiful and clean, bright spacious rooms and friendly staff)- our weekend was spoiled because of what happened in Jurys Inn. The  manager and staff ignore my masages-no reply received. This is not what a 4 star hotel should be like whatsoever,  room cleanliness, Manager, staff friendliness and refund process should be changed.
Avoid!",1,2021,09,01
231,Handy to everything ,"My husband and I were impressed by the friendly service of the reception. We had arrived early well before check-in and they let us go on up to our room.

It was bright clean and enough space for 2 of us. There's no fridge or safe that's the only thing that we both missed. There is an iron and ironing board.

Dublin is expensive for food and drink we didn't realise there is a restaurant on the 2nd floor.

We had a lovely bag full of food for breakfast witch was at our door when we woke up.

We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend the hotel.

If you are driving as we were the street beside the hotel is a car park we paid just 15 euro for over night. We just walked everywhere and didn't use the car at all during our visit. ",5,2021,08,30
231,Recommend for a stay in Dublin,"Great location, lovely bright room.

231,Mediocre hotel,"Mediocre hotel nothing too special, blonde woman at the door asked us our room numbers on arrival and when we all answered she told one of our friends to shut up, we wouldn’t be a rude bunch either which pissed us off she acted like she had some authority, completely rude and uncalled for, also second night almost being interrogated and barely getting back into my room as a lady, man at the front desk began questioning about my room relatively late after telling people at the front door I was stepping out to have a smoke which may I add is super danger and they should have an allocated area for smokers because I felt so unease having to step outside of the hotel doors to have a smoke on a rough enough area especially in the evenings and nights, only smoking area they had was a court yard which was open at certain hours, as I was saying the man at the front desk questioning me about all the info I had about my room after seeing me walk outside for a smoke and seeing me use my key card. May I also add the prices of “snacks” is insane a pot of noodles, taytos and a small bottle of coke ranking up to a €10 would u be well!? Showers could’ve also been cleaner and more toilet roles and towels would be sufficient aswell as atleast if room service employees would pop in to collect rubbish instead we had to find our own way of disposing it, don’t think it was worth almost €300 for the way we were treated but sure look can’t do anything now, that blonde woman at the door needs to get off her high horse though telling customers to shut up after literally asking them a question.

231,Great experience,Staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms were spacious and clean and everything we needed! Beds were comfy and I liked the safety of the hotel as you cannot access the rooms without a keycard. Being able to leave our bags off before we checked in and after we checked out was great and handy and also getting our parking validated was great. We would definitely stay here again. Great experience for a great price!,4,2021,08,17
231,None,"excellent overall .
great service, friendliness, cleanliness, comfort and so near to o Connell st.
staff are no 1 and no request is A PROBLEM FOR THEM 
would stay here again 
they prices of their rooms are  also very competitive",5,2021,08,17
231,Mediocre stay,We stayed for 2 nights at the beginning of our family holiday. Room was quite small for 3 of us maybe a camp bed instead of a double couch would have been a better option. Key cards stopped working several times. Electricity went in our room morning of checkout no showers and no cup of tea with our prepared breakfast bags which were no great shakes. Bar closed at 10pm and no table service as under covid guidelines there should be. Poorest selection in a bar I have ever seen. Most staff were friendly but the couple who weren't took the shine off.,2,2021,08,13
231,"Good location, great staff!","Cheap and cheerful, nothing was a problem, we enjoyed our stay here, staff were very friendly! Kids can stay for free and they get a free breakfast! Close to shops and supermarkets! Definitely recommend it!",5,2021,08,11
231,None,"Service for bag drop was excellent and at all times staff were very good , helpful and polite. The decor is just a little dated but that did not affect our stay one bit. It was a pleasure and will definitely be back.",4,2021,08,11
231,Nice place to stay,"Nice hotel in a central location. Room was clean and a good size. Check in time is on the late side but a lovely member of staff allowed us to check in early. They also have baggage storage facilities prior to check in. Lighting isn't great in the room and there were a few small bits that need attention, like a touch up in the bathroom. Overall I would stay again if I came back to Dublin.",4,2021,08,08
231,Never again,"I recently stayed at this hotel while it is in a great location that is within walking distance that is the only plus side 

Due to the ongoing pandemic I appreciate that the safety of all is paramount but the cleanness and customers comfort should be taken into consideration.

I stayed here with my son and husband from Monday to Friday firstly the level of cleanliness within the room was room , the tray with the cups and spoons , well the spoon had food on it so I didn’t have hope there was also dust throughout. The only sanitized used wrap was on the remote
As our phone didn’t work I had to call to reception 3 times to get our towels changed and was informed that someone come and collect our old towels and give us fresh ones this NEVER happened 

I also asked for rubbish bags and toilet roll but had to get these myself. 

I was completely unsatisfied with the room and it felt ver hostel like in regards to the the hygiene 

Will not be staying here again",1,2021,08,06
231,4 stars hotel? Not even close.,"We stayed for 5 days in this hotel. The position and the view are over the top but not the rest though. They never cleaned our room and they didn't provide any kind of whatever room service. Room was dirty, bathroom was uncomfortable, no fridge, no safecase, even the window was blocked. It's a 100% 2 stars hotel.",2,2021,08,04
231,Refusing to refund my FREE CANCELLATION booking,"DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM ON BOOKING.COM!!!!!! I booked a double room with them with free cancellation. They took the full price of the room up front without notifying me that this was going to happen, which I didn’t mind as I intended to stay. Then due to covid my plans changed and I cancelled my booking, after 2 weeks I rang to ask why I hadn’t received my refund and they said it takes up to 14 working days, it has now been nearly a month and I still haven’t received any refund. Absolute disgrace, and everytime I ring there an “issue with their system” or they just HANG UP!!!",1,2021,08,03
231,Awful,"we got there they said that our names weren’t in the system and that they wouldn’t take us for the night as they didn’t have enough rooms they didn’t help with us finding somewhere else to stay and we’re very hostile towards us. 
We booked , confirmed and paid for this stay and it was our first time in Dublin and we’re left with no other option than to go back home to cork.",1,2021,07,30
231,A huge disappointment,"I’m writing this review from my hotel room jury’s inn Dublin Parnell street ,I’m staying here with my wife and two kids age 3 and 5 and my friend and his wife and two kids  .at the minute I’m so disappointed with the hole experience ,  we booked two family rooms side by side which we got rooms are clean but extremely small .and walls are paper tin with a lot of street noise 
But the final straw was the restaurant we  booked a table for 7pm for 4  adults and 4 kids expecting this to be a quick and painless experience as the kids was going to be going to bed by 8 pm .was I wrong 
It was the most disappointing disorganised restaurant I was ever in 

There was 4 staff  on duty which did not have a clue there was a man in front of us getting turned away  because they had no table yet he had it prebooked  
And the restaurant was only half full
 We sat down to order our food a friendly lady took our order  and it went down hill from there 
No cutlery was brought out with our starters so we eat it with our hands the table was not cleared afterwards  50 minutes from getting our starter we still had not received our main course or the kids still had not Got there food 
At 9 pm we got our food after requesting to see a manager which in turn was aulful bad food , that was not eaten the kids got over cooked chicken nuggets 
We would have a 100 Times better experience if we went to macdonlds 
At this stage the restaurant was in complete disarray with all customers in the same situation as  we were not getting there food a complete disappointment for such a large chain of hotels the basic training of hospitality  was  gone out the window",1,2021,07,30
231,Beautiful Hotel For A City Break,"Lovely hotel  for a city break we stayed 2 nights here and loved it 🤩hotel within walking distance of everything etc cinema, bars ,great Shopping centers and so much to do around the city 🛍 Hotel is immaculate beautiful food and service in the restaurant for both dinner and breakfast 😋 

Staff couldn’t have done anymore for us they were so so helpful and informative especially as we didn’t really know our way around or didn’t have a plan as what we wanted to do around Dublin the staff recommended we visit Dublin zoo 🐒 Phoenix Park🦆Temple Bar 🍻 St. Stephen’s Green and some great spots for shopping 😍🛍All of which we done and really really enjoyed.

The hotel it’s self dose not have a hotel car park but have a great System in place with Q park only around the corner from the hotel and very cheap once you activate your car park ticket at the hotel staff in reception are great and will help do this for you and make it as easy as possible for you 🚘🚗

Great security in the hotel your key card is used for everything toilet lifts etc it makes you feel so safe plenty of hand sanitizer throughout the hotel and all staff obeying the Covid 19 rules 😷 

Highly recommend this hotel for every type of stay and great value for money.",5,2021,07,27
231,"If you have to cancel, then I hope you're not in a rush for your money back...","I had to cancel my August booking for personal reasons; it was free cancellation so I didn't anticipate a problem. This was on July 5th. I emailed the hotel and was informed that it could take up to 14 days for my refund!? Why!? When 14 days had passed I emailed again and was informed the 14 days excluded bank holidays and weekends. Why wasn't I told this originally. My final email reply from the hotel (now that 14 days excluding bank holidays and weekends have passed) informed me that the refund has been given, BUT it will take a FURTHER 7-10 business days before it appears in my account! I really didn't want to have to write a negative review in light of the COVID-related problems the industry has suffered, but this really seems excessive. They were certainly quick enough taking my money, but giving it back is another issue entirely. I am fortunate in that I was not relying on receiving my money back to make other arrangements, but others might not be so fortunate. I did see reviews warning my about this, I should have taken more notice...",2,2021,07,26
231,Amazing hotel,This hotel is amazing it's perfect for family's the staff are just amazing there all very friendly and the room are just amazing definitely will be staying here again highly recommend it to anyone the bar and restaurant are also amazing,5,2021,07,21
231,Amazing hotel 😍,"I visited Jury’s Inn Parnell Street in July 2021 😻 the room was so nice and really clean before we arrived 🤩 We were staying in room 534 and it is such a beautiful room, bed is beyond comfortable, bathroom is a lovely size & the shower is a great shower! We then had a dressing table that had a kettle, tea bags, sugar, a hair dryer and a TV 😄 the hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the ilac shopping centre & Henry street 🏬 seagulls are always flying onto the balcony outside and make sure to say hello 👋🏻 We had dinner at the hotel one evening and it wasn’t great, we had been booked in for 7:30 and we had arrived a few minutes earlier, we got a booth and all was going great. We got our food & drinks ordered and here is where it started going downhill we hadn’t gotten our food until 8:40! I got the Sweet chilli stir fry with chicken and my mom got the Punjab chicken curry they were so delicious but we were beyond hungry at that stage! We then ordered our desserts around 9, I got the Baileys cheesecake and my mom asked for the sticky toffee pudding she was then told that they didn’t have that so she ordered the chocolate brownie. We then were sat there waiting for the desserts until 9:50 !! A lovely lady named karolina kept letting us know that they were beyond sorry that the meals were taking so long and we know that it wasn’t here fault at all. Another member of staff came up to our booth around 9:45 to tell my mom that they didn’t have the brownie either so she got the Baileys cheesecake aswell we ate the desserts and brought our drinks back to the room. There was a family sat behind us and they had told us the same thing had happened the night before!! This was the only bad incident we had in the hotel 🏨 Staff are lovely there !! Highly recommend everyone visit sometime ‼️",5,2021,07,16
231,None,"No very clean at all towels were stained and also so was bed sheets.
The room was incredibly dusty and apararently the remote had been sanitised obviously not has my hand stuck to it.
And also apparently the toilet was sanitised even though there was a lovely streak down it !!!",1,2021,07,16
231,Average,"This was a couples stay in July 2021. The beds in our room were comfortable, cleaning in room not 100% with dust on the TV and other surfaces. 

With a ""this room has been sanitised"" sign on the door, but finding dirt and dust on the rooms surfaces does not inspire confidence in the cleaning 

The stay at the hotel was average, with comfortable beds. I have made allowances for gaps in the service delivered due to to ongoing COVID-19 Restrictions. 

",3,2021,07,14
231,Great hotel; avoid the restaurant,"The hotel is great but the restaurant and bar is a disaster. We waited 40 minutes for starters and a further hour for main course. The menu has been reduced so there are only 3-4 options for each course so it shouldn’t be that difficult. There was another 4 tables close to us - one returned all the food and left having waited 2 hours; another with 2 kids waited 1 1/2 hours for starters and then left; another table had to return their main course twice having waited 2 hours to get it. 
It seems it’s grossly understaffed and the waiting staff are being let down by very poor management. Our dinner was included in the “staycation” package. It’ll be interesting to see what breakfast is like this morning…",3,2021,07,14
231,Disappointing ‘romantic getaway’,"We had booked a package for a romantic getaway for 2 nights - breakfast and a bottle of fizz. We were given a disability room (despite having booked a standard room) that had long hairs visible on the shower drain.

The biggest let down was the breakfast that we chose to pay extra for. We were told when checking in that a paper bag would be dropped off to the room between 7-10 consisting of porridge (add boiling water to, no extra milk was provided), fruit, yogurt, orange juice and a croissant. There was only one chair in the room so we had to awkwardly share this to eat our breakfast. There was also an option to go to the restaurant to collect a ciabatta. I do not understand the logic of not serving paying customers a cooked breakfast when the restaurant is open for ciabattas and also for dinners as normal in the evenings.

Despite breakfast being delivered to the rooms, only one small bin was provided - our room was not cleaned in the 2 nights we were there which meant there was a collection of waste we were unable to dispose of and that our towels were also not changed.

All in all, a disappointing ‘romantic getaway’ to the city - we will not stay with this chain again.",2,2021,07,13
231,Staycation,"Just returned from Jurys Parnell Street for one of their family staycations! Well done to everyone for a very enjoyable stay, a warm welcome when arriving, beautiful clean room, fantastic dinner in hotel bar with a great menu which catered for everyone! Due to current covid restrictions continental breakfast was delivered to our room and a lovely note attached to our bag inviting us to collect bacon rolls from reception which were delicious! This hotel goes above and beyond delivering excellent Customer service, everyone is credit to Jurys and I can honestly say our little holiday was one on the most enjoyable occasions!",5,2021,07,08
231,Amazing,"Great place to stay , everything is so close. Great security makes you feel safe. Air conditioning and comfy beds . Nice staff and lovely dinner . 10/10 would stay again ! Everything in walking distance",5,2021,06,20
231,Great price Great location,Extremely friendly staff. Robert at check-in was very friendly and helpful. Katerina the waitress was lovely when we had our dinner each evening of our stay. Breakfast due to covid was as good as it could be given the circumstances however the bacon on the baguette could have done with less fat and seemed to be more boiled than the usual. Great location and great price. Would definitely recommend,4,2021,06,13
231,Good stay bad food,"It was a mostly satisfactory and enjoyable experience but the food was clearly frozen & thrown together whilst being ridiculously over priced, for example, the battered cod is comparable to store bought aldi frozen cod and the chicken burger was extremely tough & tasteless. Would advise staying but avoiding the restaurant",2,2021,06,07
231,I was never refunded money due back to me.,We decided not to stay a second night due to A/c not working and unsatisfactory Ventilation in the rooms. I have to wait Twenty days for a refund according to the Hotel. I want my money back or i will take further action as required,1,2021,06,06
231,5 star,Came for work with 2 colleagues from start to finish this has been a 5 star stay great value easy check in average room but spotless that matched the great price paid bar was lovely food excellent pub grub and our stay was made by Simon who was so attentive and professional the whole time he looked after us highly recommended,5,2021,04,30
231,Beware!,"Booked a room for Jan on Booking.com on the ""free cancellation"" option. Cancelled back at the beginning of December and am still awaiting my refund despite chasing multiple times.

Room was clean and fresh as was the bathroom. We loved our stay and will be back for a more leisurely stay. The hotel is so central. Felt very safe in there. We booked for dinner, only negative I have was the dinner for baby the mash potato was dry and had hard skin like it was microwaved had requested a drop of soup with it but they only gave gravy it softened the mash and she ate some. Apart from that our stay was lovely.",5,2020,12,19
231,"Noisy, we are exhausted today","Beautiful food and service in the restaurant, however we hardly slept due to the people in the two rooms next to us. I would suggest putting all young men and woman on the one floor, the noise of them was unbelievable. Dreading the journey home so tired.cards for access to lift rarely worked and didn't realise we couldn't have breakfast only bags at the door which I don't understand as we could all sit and have dinner last night. Nobody told us we couldn't pay cash during booking thank god we had one with us.",2,2020,12,13
231,Worst stay ever,Unable to have dinner with friends staying in hotel with us dirty rag on floor when entered the room supposidly sanitised..unable to pay cash had to use friends card.. Unable to order food at the table we were sitting at but other people could.. Security done spot check on our room but didn't check our friends room felt very discriminated against.... Husband was question on his way bk up to room,1,2020,12,12
231,Refund,They are totally rubbish. Booked through booking.com. Did cancelled within free cancellation. However still struggling to get my refund. Initially told will get refund within 14 day. Now saying it can take 90 days. Eating my money. Don’t trust them at all,1,2020,12,09
231,Gillian conroy,"Absolutely loved my stay here, the location was central too everything, it was immaculate, staff couldn't be any more helpful, I was there for a medical appointment at the matter, located 10 Mt's from hospital very reassuring and gp 5 minutes away, highly recommended this hotel for every type of stay be that leisure, work ect, priced very reasonable for what you got, I only wish too ➕ information regarding facilities, food, thing too do be in room in a 📂 and no outdoor for smokers even just a small area would complement this hotel even further",5,2020,12,03
231,‘Stole the Show’ -five stars,"Unfortunately during my stay my friend and I experienced some minor theft from another guest in the middle of the night. Immediately after the incident we contacted the front desk. All the staff on duty (especially Adrian, the night porter) were so attentive, acted so fast, and appropriately for the situation. Even though we had this negative experience with another guest, I can’t commend the efficiency and positive attitude of the staff more.",5,2020,10,13
231,Very clean hotel,"Extremely clean hotel with friendly staff. We stayed for the night and decided against breakfast but it did smell delicious so were full of regret.

I have been waiting for more than 90 days to receive a refund. Furthermore, all communication has been initiated by me and i never heard anything from the hotel. Booking.com have made a lot of promises even stating that the refund had been done. However, up till today i still not have received anything.",1,2020,09,24
231,Do not stay!,"Staff are very rude so we got the manager and she was even more rude!! Booked a room but because we didnt turn up on time they put us as a no show. Still took our money and give the room to someone else! So if I bought a house I'd have to move in straight away so that no one else does???? I think not... so why should it be any different for the room I have paid for! I work in a hotel myself and we keep the room open for however long the guest is staying, whether they turn up or not!! Very very rude staff! And the refund takes forever!!!! So now I'm stuck in ireland with no where do stay and they did not care at all! I advise against staying here!! All these people care about is your wallet!!! Wasnt even a nice welcome as we entered the building!! Vile business!! I'd stay well away!!",1,2020,09,23

231,Suitable Base for Families,"I stayed here in August with family.

I arrived late evening after a 1 and a half hour drive. I was welcomed by smiling receptionists. The delivery of information was simple and efficient.

Breakfast at the time we visited was takeaway or room service so we went for the option of eating out.

The hotel room was large and spacious and showers had power and were clean.

I felt this hotel were adhering easily to standards of covid 19 safety advice.

I would recommend anyone visiting an area in Dublin to stay as without all the bells and whistles this place gave everything needed for a stay.",4,2020,09,10
231,One Night In Dublin,"Stayed here en-route to London and although the hotel is a relatively nice hotel, I was a little naffed off that my room was not up to a standard with cleanliness that one would expect. Remembering that we are in the midst of a global pandemic one would think that they would be spot on with cleaning. What naffed me off? There was some sticky sweets and a lid to a juice bottle on the bedroom floor (the lid I happened to stand on so it really hurt my foot). All that aside it was fine and good value for money. 

The only disappointing thing really was the fact that breakfast came in a bag, consisting of a croisant (not a good one), a yoghurt, a tub of fresh fruit And a bottle of orange juice. This again due to Covid as the hotel is not able to serve breakfast in the dinning room. A bacon ciabatta was available to grab from the dinning area and we did, but again a little disappointing. 

The staff however were all very pleasant.

All that aside, I would probably stay again as we are in unusual times.",3,2020,09,06
231,Hotel was lovely,"I stayed here 2 days when I flew back from London lovely room lovely staff I had ordered flowers for my cousin funeral they took the bouquets in for me and then brought them up to me staff extremely friendly and professional the room was spotless very clean and comfortable bed limited food menu due to covid-19.. and not much variety for breakfast,  parnell Street right in the city center which is great for shopping i would also say security is good too i came back at 1am from galway and was security to get in so that's good too i had to leave early to catch my flight back to London but all in all when I go back home to ireland i will book to stay here again and an ice machine on every floor brilliant 👏 ",5,2020,08,30
231,Average !,"Stayed for 4 nights with my children and husband as we were visiting Dublin , the location was great however, not much facilities within the hotel ,our breakfast was put in bags and left at the front door for us to pick up , they said this is delivered between 6:00-6:30, the bag contained yogurts and cold orange juice and chopped fruit,  so by the time we got up 08:30-9am it didn’t really feel very cold :-( and the idea to leave the food in the floor ( obviously packaged ) it wasn’t ideal for me - I guess this is due to pandemic but surely they should of thought of a better way , the breakfast was continental which is boring after a couple of days and wanted something hot ,at times they missed missed out some of items from the bag which with kids it caused a bit of an issue so parents had to step in and sacrifice. There was an option of bacon baps to be picked up from the restaurants daily included in the breakfast package but no catering for vegetarians which three of us were !! . Apart from the bar in the hotel no other facilities available especially for kids . They are also building another hotel next door so scaffolding and drilling going on during the day . Also a lot of drunks hang out literally in front of and near the hotel which I gues can’t be helped but with kids and them shouting it wasn’t ideal when going pass .. as I said average hotel and don’t think I would want to stay here again thanks .",3,2020,08,29

 Shame to remember Dublin this way but it's a very dirty run down city no social distancing what so ever and as for the view from hotel room was awful no way near 4 stars for this hotel my personal opinion never again.😔",1,2020,08,15
231,Nice place to stay,The facilities were immaculate and the location of the hotel is perfect! Staff were extremely friendly and efficient.They apply all the safety guidelines put in place.

231,Don't think I'd be returning. ,"Family trip away from the North into the south of Ireland. Booked this hotel ages ago,  only to learn on check in that no cooked breakfast was happening. You were going to given a pack lunch basically even though the kitchen was open to serve dinner and tea! The key cards to enter the lifts and room were a nightmare, been to reception four times to reprogram the card. Our room was on the 3rd floor, view of the main street and busy traffic noise. Cleanness was ok, not worth the money. ",3,2020,08,10
231,Not the best deal during August 2020,"A short review of our stay during August 2020
- good location 
- ice and water available FOC
- very poor breakfast which is left outside your room from 6am. Breakfast included 3 mini croissants, jam, yogurt, fruit salad. There is not information on the hotel website about this change due to COVID, however their inside restaurant is still open ... and available to use for dinner and lunches 
- bad coffee (only available from small bags) 
 
",3,2020,08,07
231,"Very Disappointing, Unfriendly and Uninterested Staff","Every staff member we came in contact with was Cold, Uninterested and very Unapproachable. 

We trekked for 15 minutes with heavy bags to be told we couldn’t leave our bags in reception even though it is stated on website that you can. 

Dinner was extremely overpriced €15 for a soggy painni with Tortilla chips, which we had to go up and ask for cutlery. 

Even when checking out we weren’t even asked how our stay was, or greeted with any sort of friendliness that you would expect at a hotel. 

The room beside us were talking at full volume well into the early morning and not to mention their headboard knocking against the wall.... 

Overall very disappointed with our stay. Coming from someone who has worked in Hotels, I don’t understand why no one there had any sort of skills for dealing with Guests.",2,2020,08,06
231,Awful,"We had choosen Jury's Inn due to the 4 start rating and the good reviews. We arrived late and check in was quick and easy the lady that checked us in was amazing. The hotel was lovely at reception but the room was total shock. The room was dark and dull, Carpet covered in stains and ripped,two different colours of paint on the walls where it's been touch up jobs, the dust and the bath really put me off. The TV in the room was outdated and poor selection of channels compared to other 4* hotels I've stayed in when you can get sky channels etc. I expected better from this hotel. The noise coming from other rooms kept us awake as tvs were very Loud and doors slamming. Breakfast was poor and no choose of a hot breakfast, I understand d we are in the middle of covid but we have stayed in other hotels during this and had the option of a hot bacon bap etc. I won't be back as I was very disappointed.",1,2020,07,31
231,1st class lesson in poor customer service,"My partner and I were due to spend an overnight stay in Dublin, staying at Jury's Inn. Due to the quarantine rules in place (announced days before our stay) as a result of the Corona virus pandemic we were unable to use this stay. We booked through a 3rd party website but contacted Jury's Inn for advice, hoping that we would be able to move the booking or receive a refund in the form of a voucher. 
Jury's Inn washed their hands of us and offered no sympathy, no advice, no help and were quite rude in their correspondence with us. 

Had you offered us a change of date or a Jury's Inn voucher to use on a future stay you would have retained 2 customers. However, we weren't offered anything of the sort though feel that we should have been given the circumstances. 
We won't be returning or using you again. I'd highly recommend that others stay clear given that this is the level of customer service that you should expect.",1,2020,07,27
231,Brilliant hotel.,"I stayed at the hotel just for a single night with my daughter, from the moment we arrived I was struck by how lovely the staff were and how helpful they were. (Thank you Robert)  They work really hard to provide the best service they can. 

The hotel is perfectly situated in the city centre. It's clean, modern, and very well presented. The rooms are spacious and well equipped. 

Even when faced with a less than well behaved guest, the staff dealt with it very promptly and professionally. 

I honestly couldn't fault the hotel and staff here and would 100% recommend staying here.",5,2020,07,25
231,Breakfast ,"Would not recommend breakfast I asked numerous times at reception how do you choose what you want for breakfast I could never get a straight answer so they left a pre packed meal at our door at 6am to find out it was a croissant,yougart,fruit and orange juice it cost me and my girlfriend and extra €40 would not recommend the breakfast ",1,2020,07,19
231,A Great Stay.,"After looking a few different hotels for a stay in Dublin, we decided on this one. It really didn’t let us down, great rooms, friendly staff and a fully stocked bar. Only 2 nights booked, but everything about our stay was excellent. The only thing I would say is that is a good 10/15 minute walk into Temple Bar, that was fine for us but could be a problem for some people. Other than that, I couldn’t recommend this hotel more.",4,2020,04,22
231,Very nice,"We wanted for nothing, the room was comfortable and the hotel central.   A short walk took us to pretty well anywhere we could want to go.   The breakfast was to die for, the beds comfortable and the staff amiable.   Would return in a trice. ",5,2020,04,12
231,Family trip,"We stayed at this hotel during the shutdown in Dublin in March 2020.
The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel is a great location with walkable areas and plenty of stores, restaurants and services. 
Hotel vey clean and staf again was super friendly and helpful despite the trying times. ",5,2020,04,10
231,Convenient and Pleasing,"Comfortable beds. Pillows a bit hard but not a deal breaker. Close to everything in Dublin with easy access to buses and Dart. Friendly staff. Good breakfast. Everything pretty clean.  Smaller rooms but we are used to U.S., sized rooms and assume they are typical for Europe.  All good!",4,2020,03,23
231,Lovely hotel in walking distance of Dublin's attractions,"My husband and I stayed here with a couple of friends during February half term. The hotel is a short taxi ride from Dublin airport, and within walking distance of all the main Dublin attractions (the zoo was about 45min walk which we were happy to do, depends what you call walking distance!) The rooms were spacious, clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. Friendly staff and a good bar, with great breakfast! There's a great fish and chip restaurant/takeaway opposite called Kingfisher's, worth a try!",5,2020,03,23
231,okay,"we were in dublin and in this hotel on the weekend from 6th to 8th march. actually we wanted to go to the six nations, but this was cancelled. the hotel and the rooms are okay, but not more. the price is definitely high and can only be justified by the very good location - but there are better ones, also centrally located",3,2020,03,20
231,Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street - review,"Great location and facilities. The main sites in the city centre were only a 10 minute walk away. There were also good transport links in the near area. The hotel room was a decent size and very clean.
However, it was not clear from our online booking if our request for breakfast included had gone through and, as a result, we had to pay more for breakfast upon arrival.
That said, breakfast and dinner were very good, just be clear on the finer details of your booking before paying.",3,2020,03,17
231,Terrible expierience,"Together with my partner, we booked a hotel for two. However, after a few days, it turned out that our friend was going to Dublin with us, which is why I contacted the hotel to change the booking of one room for two to the room for three people. At this point, I would like to add that I managed my choice with the fact that the hotel boasts four stars, and we wanted comfort because our stay in Dublin was short and very fast. 
When the room was changed from two to three people, I was informed about the extra costs, at the beginning I was told that it would be about 20 euros per night. In a later conversation, this amount was changed to 30 euros per night. My problem was not the amount but the fact that I could not get one specific price. After that, money for the room 158 GBP (without this extra 60 euros) was withdrawn from my account twice. Of course, I immediately informed the hotel about this but the money was held for 10 days! It was not my fault, so why I had to suffer and wait for the money! This is not acceptable. 
After all, we still decided to go to this hotel. We arrived in Dublin very late at night (at around 01:00). The gentleman at the reception did not belong to friendly people. This gentleman was simply rude. This did not give us a good impression of a four-star hotel. We have been informed that we have to pay extra for a third person. We knew this in advance and were ready to pay 60 euros. The reception informed us in a very rude and unprofessional manner that we had to pay 50 euros per night (100 euros in total). Of course, we disagreed with this and presented them with an email with the information we received. Before we showed the e-mail, the receptionist did not want to believe us and expected us to pay 100 euros. It is not about money but about the attitude of the reception staff who approached us dismissively, insolently and behaved as if we were not customers. It was very unprofessional. By the time we got to that we only have to pay an extra 60 euros, my card was rejected by the card reader. I tried again and it turned out that the card was rejected again. I asked my partner if he could try but unfortunately, his card was also rejected. Of course, no one has any influence on technology, but as people, we have an influence on what will happen next. At this point, we were very tired and we wanted to go to bed. The receptionist was unable to explain to us why (he just mentioned that could be a technical problem) our cards were not accept",1,2020,03,14
231,not very accommodating,"We saved for years to finally go to Ireland for St Patrick's day, and of coarse the Corona virus caused the cancellation of all St patty day celebrations across Ireland even the Dublin parade. We just wanted to move the dates to next year and Jury's Inn would not work with us very disappointed",1,2020,03,10
231,Good trip,Fine hotel. Nothing exceptional but as expected for a short business type trip. Only downfall was that the room was very very hot even when temperature turned down. Otherwise happy with my stay. Good location for trinity college and transport links. ,4,2020,03,09
231,Quick Stay,Stayed here on the night of 7th March for a concert in the 3Arena. Only 5min walk away from the Luas. Car Park is 3/4min walk on Marlborough St and is €15 for the night. Staff were friendly and would def stay here again,5,2020,03,09
231,SHORT BREAK,"Apart from difficulty finding the car-parking facility (provided by a partner organisation) the time in the hotel was very pleasant and relaxing.  Reception staff probably haven't actually driven the route to Spires Car Park which is now plagued by one way streets and Luas lines, so difficult to access.",4,2020,03,09
231,Shoppers Delight!,"The hotel is in a great location in central Dublin if you are mainly interested in shopping, eating and going to a few pubs.  Its approx 100m from all the main shops on Henry Street, all the great pubs and restaurants along and just off O'Connell street and only a 10 min walk to the  entertainment area south of the Liffey.  However, the hotel is very quiet for such a central location and at a great price too.  The room was actually a decent size for the city centre, comfortable bed, and a nice bathroom too.  Check in was fast and efficient and the staff were really helpful.  I found exactly the hotel I needed for my weekend in Dublin.",5,2020,03,08
231,To be recommanded !,"Great Location, Great Staff, many thanks to Rosilda and and the rest of the Reception, Restaurant and Cleaning Staff. 
Room very clean and breakfast suitable for any kind of diet. 
I fully recommand as a former Club Med PR. Bravo Jurys Inn and thank you !!!",5,2020,03,08
231,73,"All was good with the exception of the smoking area. Guests who smoked had to stand outside the front enterance. There is an area for smoking or drinking ""al fresco"" available but this remained closed on my last two visits.. ",4,2020,03,06
231,TOTAL UNDERSTANDING WHEN NEEDED,"This hotel I would highly recommend to anyone.
Lovely staff, lovely room, great breakfast options.
We are planning to return to Dublin next year and we will be staying in this hotel for sure.
Thanks everyone for a lovely stay.",5,2020,03,03
231,very  enjoyable," Just come back from a few days visiting our son .The Jury inn was a very well positioned hotel, with friendly helpful staff. The room  was clean,comfortable bed and quiet room 430. Could not fault the hotel at all.",5,2020,03,03
231,Lovely Hotel,"Brilliant hotel, very central to O Connell street, and very friendly staff and rooms are excellent, food is brilliant, great price. Would book in there again. Would recommend it to family and friends.",5,2020,03,02
231,My stay in Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street,"The location is fantastic..you can walk everywhere and you are 15/20m walk to Temple Bar area, shops, good pubs etc.
Breakfast is good for the money you pay.
Bathroom in the room could look better, with more beauty products as body cream, soap etc.
All facilities were very clean.",4,2020,03,02
231,Top class,A very welcoming stay top class check in great staff splendid location excellent would stay again when in dublin ...close to o connell street and all major shops etc...a special mention to Vanessa on reception a credit to this hotel and a role model to all who do the same job as her top class,5,2020,03,02
231,Excellent service and quality!,"A family weekend away! Excellent check-in, very friendly staff. Booked and paid before arriving and got an great rate inc. breakfast. Rooms very comfortable, bed and pillows so lovely, slept like a log! Bath was a bonus for my hubby. Room and bathroom clean and spot on. Breakfast was nice, enough to choose from, bacon a little fatty and sausages could have been better quality but no other suggestions. Hotel very situated, @ 15 mins walk to Temple Bar area. Taxi outside our hotel to airport was 20 euro! Even though we had been told is was @ 30-35! I would stay here again.",4,2020,03,02
231,Great location!,"Great stay at the Jury's inn! Location is perfect, with a 10minute walk to temple bar. 
Parnell St. is full of shops, restaurants and bars so plenty of options a couple of steps away! 
Rooms were spotless with all the basic needs. 
Not a great deal of noise from outside the hotel. 
Breakfast was good with plenty of choice. 
We were placed next to a staff only door (room 365) which was slammed a number of times throughout each night - which was annoying but not the end of the world. 
Apart from that, the staff were great! We had our 'do not disturb' on our door but still got fresh towels left outside our room each day!
I would definetly stay here again.",5,2020,03,02
231,"Great location, modern quality hotel","  Quick efficient check in and the room was a good size. Everything you needed for a short stay. Quality linen and beds made for a great nights sleep. All clean, crisp modern and well thought out. Only slight negative bathroom had some new fittings but bath had been skipped when refurbished so looked tired around the edges. Great modern shower over so not too bad. Ice machines on each floor a great and welcome feature.

      Fantastic location just a short stroll from temple bar and very close to airport bus stops. Happy to use again.",4,2020,03,01
231,"After giving a second chance, will not come back","Last year I stayed at Belfast's Jurys Inn and was not too satisfied with the hotel. This year it was a second chance (that turned out to be not too successful). Will most likely remove this hotel chain from my future options in Scotland and Ireland. 
Here is what I thought of my current stay at Dublin’s Jurys Inn in Parnell street.
The automatic check-in machines were not fully functional. Upon getting a card to the room, there was a message that the check-in details were being printed, but this printout (with the room number, for example) never came out.
There is a nice supply of towels, but NOWHERE to hang them to dry. There is one small hook on the bathroom's door, but it's useless, if you want to dry a towel. Other than that, no hooks, nor rails to hang the towels you used. Additionally, a toilet brush would be nice to have, which is normally standard equipment in each bathroom, but not in this hotel (or at least the room I was at).",2,2020,02,29
231,Good Hotel,"Good Hotel  central location only problem 3 of us in a triple room only 2 towels/cups/glasses. Maybe could also do with the staff being more visible at breakfast.
Breakfast itself was good 
Overall was good stay ",4,2020,02,29
231,Amazing hotel and staff,"This hotel has a fabulous location. You are right in the middle of everything. The staff go above and beyond to accommodate the guests and to ensure you have a fantastic stay. Hotel is beautiful and clean. The breakfast has a fantastic choice. And the evening meals are beautiful and great value for money. We were a group of 12 friends visiting the city but this hotel offers a fabulous service for families, couples and groups. When we return to Dublin we would not stay anywhere else!! ",5,2020,02,29
231,Looking at alternative venues,"whilst the hotel staff and facilities are generally excellent on this stay the restaurant was closed which meant anyone wishing to eat in the hotel, dined in the bar, less tables and too much food odour! ",4,2020,02,28
231,Excellent location and a very good service,"The hotel is located very close to the center and far enough to rest well. It's very warm, pthe breakfast is very good and the bar is very nice. The room is very comfortable and clean, only missing a small fridge to put our drinks. I recommend. ",4,2020,02,26
231,Mini break in the Capital.,"We stayed in Jury's for one night. The hotel was beautifully decorated. Staff were very welcomining and food was delicious. The location was perfect, we were shopping and visiting sites and it was centrally located just a stones throw from everything. The bed was super comfy with  lovely clean modern en suite.  The breakfast was unbelievable. Every choice was catered for. We were really spoiled for choice. No complaints from the kids, loads of choice. Beautiful food in a beautiful hotel. It was an A+ for us, and reasonably priced. We will be back.",5,2020,02,26
231,Dublin stay,"Able to check in early which was very helpful.  Good location.Room fine, clean and appropriately 
Resourced... though able to hear mobile phone + of neighbouring rooms. We didn't use hotel restaurant or bar.",4,2020,02,25
231,Jurys - valentines weekend 2020,"Great location, great staff. Breakfast was fantastic and bar food very well priced.
Car parking not on site which was a pain due to the bad weather that weekend but apart from that, great place to stay.",5,2020,02,25
231,Another excellent stay!,"This hotel must be the handiest hotel in dublin! At the top of Moore Street, surrounding by shops. Easy taxi spin from Heuston station or Bus Aras. Rooms and bedding so comfortable. Lovely bar and restaurant. Always a great breakfast!",5,2020,02,24
231,Weekend Away,"Stayed in February for a friends birthday weekend away. Check in was quick and easy and the room was clean and tidy, bed extremely comfortable!! Card didn’t always work in the lift but was given another one at reception no questions asked. Great location, short walk to the bars! Had a fab weekend and would definitely stay again if we came back to Dublin.",5,2020,02,24
231,Awesome,"Excellent in every area. Only a short walk to the main bars/shops, temple bar 15 mins walk. Great food options around and a tesco over the road. Staff very friendly and overall a great hotel. Bus links nearby to airport!",5,2020,02,24
231,Jurys,This hotel was very clean and hospitable.  It was centrally located making walking to many attractions easy.  It was always easy to find at night because of it's proximity to the spire.  I was very pleased with my experience and would definitely stay here again.,5,2020,02,24
231,Husbands 50th birthday surprise,"I  booked this as a surprise for my husbands 50th birthday.  Simon checked us in and acknowledged it was a special occasion. He gave us some vouchers for free drinks. We went to our room and it was a disabled room. I rang reception and spoke to Simon , informed him my husband was 50 not 70, he apologised and upgraded us to an executive room. Plentiful breakfast, and pleasant staff. ",5,2020,02,24
231,Great hotel,Good location very efficient staff on the desk upon arrival ideal to cater for a short stay in Dublin and any enquiries or problems were dealt with efficiently during our stay I would not hesitate booking to stay again in the future ,5,2020,02,24
231,Very Enjoyable Stay,"Great central location with very comfortable rooms. Excellent breakfast with lots of choice. Very friendly, helpful and courteous staff in all areas particularly in the restaurant and bar. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2020,02,24
231,Good hotel for seeing dublin,"Good location and very clean and tidy hotel well worth a visit when planning a trip to dublin, everything is in walking distance temple bar 15 minutes walk and surrounded by good places to eat and enjoy a pint or 2",4,2020,02,24
231,Excellent hotel,"We visited this hotel in Feb 2020, for our 25th anniversary. Hotel is very central within each reach of restaurants pubs etc and also airport. Hotel is clean & very comfy. The staff are helpful and polite. We were given upgrade without anything being said and chocs in our room, also invited for free drink at the bar. Breakfast was very nice. Would highly recommended, this is our second visit.",5,2020,02,24
231,60th weekend,Nice hotel never had breakfast so cannot comment on food trouble with keys as the cards kept losing connection and we were not the only persons with this trouble but staff helpful in giving new keys great position to explore Dublin clean and quite room I would go back ,4,2020,02,24
231,Nice Hotel in a great location,"We found the hotel excellently located, and with good customer service. The check in was quick and easy, as was the check out. They had secure space to look after our cases on check out, so we could spend the day in museums before the flight, without dragging them around.
The breakfast was standard fare, but there was plenty of it, and quickly restocked as it ran out. 
The rooms were quiet of a night, which is a real bonus.
One suggestion would be to have a selection of pillow thicknesses. They are all really thick, which gave my wife a stiff neck after the first night. We asked for a thinner one and this was supplied.
The bar prices are pretty reasonable for a Dublin City Centre hotel.
I would definitely recommend a stay here, and will visit again in the future.",5,2020,02,23
231,Clean and tidy,"The room surpassed our expectations regarding cleanliness. 
The breakfast was very nice and the service were very kind and helpful.
The location is perfect to get to know the city and also very close to the bus stop from the airport.",5,2020,02,23
231,Weekend trip," Perfectly good hotel and much cheaper than many around it. Easy walking distance of Templebar, major shopping streets, museums etc. Guiness storehouse a little further but walkable in about 30-40 minutes. Clean, pleasant staff, welcoming reception, comfy bed. Easy check in and check out. About 28 euros in taxi from airport. Definitely reccomend. ",5,2020,02,23
231,Perfectly good hotel,"great value hotel, in good location.  Rooms fine with good bathroom and shower.  would be good for a small fridge in room but all other aspects fine.  Buffet breakfast varied and plentiful.  staff friendly and helpful.",4,2020,02,22
231,A cheap and comfortable stay!,"My partner and I stayed at this hotel for a long weekend in Dublin. It was an absolute steal at just £112 for two nights (we got an early check-in and luggage storage for a late departure too making it a lovely, long three days). The hotel is located close to the main street, O’Connell’s, and the main bus stop and is just a short walk away from the river and Temple Bar area too. The decor was a little dated and in need of a revamp, but the room was clean and comfortable and the staff were remarkably helpful throughout our stay. We had the most wonderful, relaxed trip away and would definitely recommend this hotel! ",4,2020,02,22
231,Good value central location,Stayed for a night while attending a concert.  Hotel was just around the corner from where the bus dropped us off. Lovely cosy quiet room.  Bath was too shallow to be any use and batteries for the tv remote died but nice bar and good breakfast ,4,2020,02,22
231,Would stay here again.,"Good location and great breakfast. Rooms were nice and cleaned well. We had a room around the back of the hotel on level 2, which was very quiet. The only complaint we had were that the pillows were really uncomfortable.",4,2020,02,22
231,Good find,"Things I liked;
The hotel is clean and tidy and centrally located.
The staff were very friendly and efficient.
The bar was reasonable, just a bit expensive.
Breakfast was good, nice selection.
Incredibly reasonable cost given location and during half term.
Downsides;
The family room we had was cramped with a double sofa bed set up for our 2 children, my 8 year old was not too impressed sharing with his 2 year old brother. Unfortunately my 2 year old fell out and bumped his head on the metal frame that sticks out. 
I paid a very good price so although disappointed with the room, it did not warrant complaint. I just don’t understand why family rooms can’t be just that, slightly better sizes and just have some single beds in them!
Pillows were very uncomfortable.
We struggled to get room temp comfortable 
The road/tram noise was quite distracting, 
but, the aforementioned positive points and the good price help to balance these things out. Hence the ‘average’ review.

On trying to make contact with the hotel prior to our stay, I was told I had to go through the agent I booked with. They listened after the agent relayed our party would require an accessible room BUT when I got in touch after my Dad had sadly passed away and told them we no longer needed an accessible room (not wanting to occupy one without cause but also not to serve as a reminder of Dad), I was told we wouldn’t get one but we did ;(",3,2020,02,21
231,Fine hotel,"Great breakfast. nice rooms,quiet and great pillows  good location for transport,airport bus,shops and bars.
Fast check in and out. Bag storage very useful. Gluten free bread available and food hot and varied",5,2020,02,19
231,Comfy room but I felt cold,Central location but moore st rough area beside it. Two men fighting outside when leaving. But hotel very nice. Staff lovely and comfy bed. I did feel the room was a bit cold. Breakfast average. Bar was very nice,4,2020,02,18
231,Average,Overall ok but waited 20 minutes each morning for breakfast as there were no toilets available. Check in process was not very welcoming. No pool which would add more value. Breakfast was good but little choice.,3,2020,02,18
231,Lovely,"Can’t fault this hotel at all, absolutely spotless, professional staff, who were always on hand to help and advise. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble. Our room was quiet, no noise at all & really effective blackout curtains for once!!  Beds & Pillows really really comfy.
Can’t rate this Hotel highly enough!! So Thankyou Jury’s in for a lovely short break. 
Judith Appleton (stayed 12-14)",5,2020,02,17
231,Great location and great staff,"Arrived early to drop our bags off as we had an early morning flight. Goran on the check in desk found a room for us so we were able to check in at 9am! There is also a room to leave you bags after check out, bags are tagged and given a number so they are secure. Internet connection was good too. Hotel is in a great location, just by O'Connel street which leads to Temple Bar. Will be visiting again.",5,2020,02,17
231,Excellent Stay,"We stayed in Jury’s Parnell recently for one night and could not recommend it highly enough.

We found the location to be perfect, just a short walk from O’Connell Street, with great access to buses, luas and trains!

Check-in was quick and efficient and good info given by reception on the hotel and things to do and see in the area.

We found the room to be really spacious, very modern and spotlessly clean.

All the facilities are really good, and loved the coffee machine and free coffee! Great touch!

We then headed to the bar on the second floor for a bite to eat! The menu has a great selection at great prices, especially given the hotels location in the centre of the city! Highly recommend the chicken burger and beef burger, both were delicious!

The location for this hotel is perfect, really close to all the tourist attractions, shops and pubs. We went for a walk around the area and found there was loads to see and do! Hotel also had great info on things to do in the area!

When we returned to the hotel we went to the bar for a drink. We thought there was great atmosphere and as we found throughout the hotel, super friendly service!

The next morning we went to the restaurant for breakfast and wow! What a super selection and one of the best breakfasts we’ve had!

All in all we thought this hotel was a little gem in the centre of Dublin city and thought the staff are a credit to this hotel, extremely helpful and always in a friendly but professional manner! We’d recommend this hotel highly and cannot wait to return. Well done to all management and staff, super hotel!",5,2020,02,17
231,Jury's Parnell Street,"Very central location - could walk where I needed to get to.
Public transport very near.  
Very helpful staff.
Facilities were clean and neat.  Amazing how quite hotel was for being in the centre of the city.
Good internet access",4,2020,02,17
231,Super City Break Location,"We stayed for three nights in February 2020 on a city break, on a bed-and-breakfast rate.  Reception staff were excellent; at check-in, when we were made to feel very welcome, and again at check-out, when a delay to our ferry meant that we needed to stay in the city for another couple of hours.  Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, and service at this high standard wins loyal customers.

Our rooms were on the inside, away from the road noise, and my fitness tracker reports that I managed a deep and full night's sleep each night.  Bedrooms were clean and comfortable.  I had a family room with two additional twin beds for my sons, these were proper beds, not sofas.

As others have reported, the location is PERFECT for anyone wanting to see/visit/work in the centre of Dublin.  Supermarkets, convenience stores and food outlets are all adjacent to the hotel on Parnell Street.  The historic GPO is just around the corner, and an easy stroll along O'Connell Street leads to the River Liffey and beyond.  So if shopping on Grafton Street is your thing, or you want to visit the Temple Bar area, or catch a local train from nearby Connolly station, the Jurys Inn should be on your shortlist.

The breakfast service is also worth a mention, a full range of cereals, pastries, bread, fruit and hot items such as eggs, sausages and bacon were all plentiful and good quality.  Staff worked hard to keep the area clean and tidy during breakfast.

This was our second visit to Jurys Inn on Parnell Street, and we'll be back again.",5,2020,02,16
231,"Great location, clean and quiet","Great for the price. The location is perfect, only a ten minute walk into the busy city centre but still out of the loud streets so you can have your window open. 

Everything was extremely clean, which is the main thing! Check in / out was really simple too, with really friendly staff. 

The rooms are pretty basic - but they have everything you need. Hair dryer, iron and tea/coffee facilities. 

The chocolates on the best for Valentine’s Day was a special bonus! Thank you, we will be returning next time we come to Dublin.",4,2020,02,16
231,Great stay,"Stayed here for 1 night in Dublin. The staff were very friendly, the hotel is in excellent location and the beds were so comfy. Breakfast was fine. Only issue i had was when i got lunch the lettuce was not fresh. However, the waitress was great offered new meal etc so was happy with response but was just put off meal. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone and i will be return next time in Dublin. ",4,2020,02,16
231,Very good business visit,"I stayed at Jurys Inn Parnell Street as I was in the city for business. The reception staff member that dealt with me on arrival was very helpful and good humoured. A discounted breakfast rate was offered if booked then rather than the following day. The room was very comfortable and well appointed. The breakfast buffet was excellent with a very good choice. Another great feature of this hotel is how central it is with close proximity to O'Connell Street, Luas, Cineworld, Henry Street etc. Very happy with the stay.",5,2020,02,16
231,Jurys Inn,We stayed at the Jurys Inn and couldn't be more pleased.  The staff was very friendly and professional.  We had an overnight flight and we were very tired upon arrival.  The staff at Jurys Inn allowed us to check in several hours early.  When we needed service or help the staff was there to help.,5,2020,02,15
231,a 2 star hotel,"Poor room with no money value. Not even one small bottle of water to welcome you as you enter the room. Breakfast without the possibility to have something extra if you want, like pancakes or a good espresso.  Not available to help you when something might go wrong.",2,2020,02,15
231,Weekend break,"We stayed in an executive room Friday to monday, the hotel is a typical chain hotel having said that there was nothing wrong with it. The room was ok quite adequate decent tv, nice comfy bed, fridge, tea and coffee making stuff, it overlooked the road so you got a certain amount of road noise, it bothered the wife but i was ok with it.
The bathroom again was adequate a bit small but no probelm.
 We only used the restaurant for breakfast and it had plenty of choice all buffet style, the only problem was on saturday when with the rugby match it was bedlam, but the staff did a great job under a lot of pressure.
 The bar was ok drinks were expensive but so is it any where in Dublin. The location was pretty good being at one end of o'connell street, not too far from all main spots which was good as the weather was quite bad.
In summary would I stay here again proably but I would also look at other hotels. I have given a four rating but feel it was more of a three and a half.",4,2020,02,14
231,Short stay in Dublin,Was very happy with service received. Asked for an early check in and this happened. Every memener of staff encountered were polite and professional. The thing that set it apart for me was when we put a do not disturb sign on our door housekeeping left a bag outside with towels and toilet rolls... Great touch by them. Rooms were good and toilets and showers were clean. Breakfast was of a good standard and the bar was good. Happy with our stay. ,5,2020,02,13

231,country visitors,"value for money,  Hotel in nice convenient location.  Disappointed that there was only one bath towel in bathroom which had to be shared between 2 people.  Otherwise everything was good and a nice comfortable bed.  Would return again.",4,2020,02,10

231,Three Days in Dublin,"I enjoyed my stay in the hotel. The room was excellent and the breakfast buffet had an very good choice of hot and cold foods. There was a very good atmosphere in the hotel bar making an evening drink an enjoyable experience. The only minor complaint was the shower in the room, sometimes the pressure was too low to get a good shower.",5,2020,02,10
231,Brilliant location and hotel,"The hotel is located just a short walk from temple bar and other great bars. Only took 25 minutes to get to the Guinness brew house. Always quiet, lovely clean room, and the staff were polite and always happy to help. Would recommended this to anyone staying.",5,2020,02,09
231,Jury's Inn Parnell St Dublin,Overall stay was good miss having safe in room also there never seems to be enough personnel on reception during busy hours apart from that the overall stay was great. Breakfast was excellent a very varied choice to suit all tastes. ,4,2020,02,08

231,the property is very NICE,"The hotel is nice, the room very comfortable, the front desk staff very friendly. The parking is no were near the property ( long walk in the cooold weather) the bar/restaurant staff has 0 manners, horrible service and the food was horrible as well. ",3,2020,02,03
231,Six Nations Rugby visit: Ireland v Scotland,"The hotel was excellent and staff were delightful. Mattress was sublimely comfy (wish I cd hv same at home!). Room was super-clean and we were happy with everything. / Next time, however, we'd choose the other Jury's Inn, simply because it is in a more ""happening"" place and appeared to have more travel options directto the Aviva Stadium.",5,2020,02,02
231,"Nice hotel, good location","Great location, staff lovely & helpful. Only gripe was that pillows were so big that if you lay on them both you felt as if you were sitting up! Even one was too much. Don't think it's necessary. Apart from that it was nice. ",4,2020,02,01
231,Room and Lifts,"I stay from time to time in this hotel.  This time I had to change rooms 3 times. Poor room, Bad smell in the second room.  3 lifts only one working the 1st day, then 2 the second day.  Long delays getting to my room and down again.",3,2020,01,31
231,My considerations,"The hotel is very well located.
About value for money it´s dificult to rate, i`ve made my booking with e-dreams and I think I´ve been over charged, but  I don´t now who´s to blame.
Rooms should have a TV with more channel options, particularly in other languages.
The room toilets should have bidets.",4,2020,01,30
231,Great weekend,"Excellent from a to y!  Would have been  a to z but breakfast a bit slow monday morning although we did hit very busy time but should not have to wait for sausages & eggs.
Room excellent, pristine and quiet, service staff friendly and attentive but unobtrusive. ",5,2020,01,30
231,A little noisy ,"Fantastic colleague's warm and clean. Central to the city centre bars etc, the only thing that stops me giving 5 stars in a front facing room you can hear traffic and trams . Only a little nit pick don't let it stop you from stopping hear a great hotel .",4,2020,01,29
231,Great central hotel,"Great location, and cheaper if your a member and book direct, everything is good however if you want the BBC channels your out of luck, from my last two visits they have never worked, try and get a front facing room.",5,2020,01,28
231,Great base to explore Dublin,"Went with friends for a long weekend. Excellent location, shops nearby and 10 min walk to Temple Bar. 
Best bit of the hotel is late breakfast and late checkouts. Staff were lovely. 
There were lots of people at breakfast but hotel was generally quiet. Breakfast is lovely, all the usual items plus continental items, fruit, smoothies and pastries. 
The rooms are basic but clean. Tv quality was rubbish but we were not in the room long enough for it to be an issue. ",5,2020,01,28
231,jurys inn,Very nice entrance fast check in our room was ready early we arrived around 10am although we had emailed ahead of arrival to get early check in no knowledge of this but allowed us to have our room very clean and amazing comfy beds we had an executive room on fifth floor nice bright room tea and coffee tray etc what you would expect we only had breakfast on Monday the day we were leaving as we wanted to explore around Dublin slept perfectly on Saturday night the Sunday night not so great as other guests were very noisy around 3am in the morning had to complain to reception through the night about noise Monday morning at breakfast was not the best ad to ask for butter for toast and had to wait around 15 minutes for hot food to come from kitchen as the buffet was not replenished when we went down most guests had already been down for breakfast but all things considered it was a good stay and would go back ,4,2020,01,28
231,Great Location,"Well situated for day tripping, shopping, tours, walking tours, eateries, and entertainment. Would have been perfect with a better bed and a shower that didn't pool around your feet. Good staff, hearty breakfasts.",4,2020,01,28
231,January Jaunt,"We stayed for one night with breakfast in the morning and were not disappointed, arrived a little early but this caused no issue, reception staff were friendly welcoming and very efficient the hotel was clean and well presented, our room had all we needed and was clean, I’m curious about the set up of the duvet as to whether is was intentionally dressed this way or if it was an accident! I would love to know the answer? Overall a very enjoyable stay Thank you.",5,2020,01,27
231,Everything excellent!,"Large and clean room, very comfortable bed and pillows.

231,"Jurys Inn, Parnell Street Dublin","Amazing accommodation and very high standards in the hotel. I upgraded to an executive room and i can say having the late check out and other perks were definitely worth that bit extra cost. The hotel had a Great location nearby to many parts of the city centre and outskirts of Dublin. Having visited Dublin 3 times this was by far the best hotel and location I've stayed in. 
Also breakfast choice was excellent and tasteful. The choice of drinks in the bar was brilliant. 
Would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone.",5,2020,01,27
231,An hotel to come back,"Staff always pleasant to help and very polite. Comfortable and clean rooms.
Excellent location. Breakfast full of options and alternative food for those who have any intolerance. If i return to Dublin, probably will choose Jury’s inn again.",5,2020,01,27
231,Overall very good,"Nice and clean hotel with all necessities. Strong smell from some product in the lobby.
Clean rooms with great beds. Very fluffy cover. No minibar. Ok breakfast. I didn't have the opportunity to eat at the restaurant, but the menue looked great and the restaurant looked fine. 
All in all a very pleasant stay.",4,2020,01,27
231,1 night stay for business,Jurys hotel is perfectly situated near O'Connell street.  I got the aircoach and walked around the corner.  Check-in was quick and efficient and i found my room easily.  I had a very pleasant stay.  There was a lot of choice for breakfast at the buffet and lots of juices / smoothies.  It was very convenient for me and I would definitely stay here again.,5,2020,01,27
231,Lovely stay,"Stayed here for two nights, breakfast included. The hotel lobby, restaurant and rooms were clean. The staff was nice. Breakfast was lovely, plenty of choice. The room had an iron, which isn’t very common nowadays but came in handy. My second stay at a Jury’s Inn and I was not disappointed.",4,2020,01,25
231,Great hotel,"Great all over, food, cleanliness, security aware feel good factor staff amazing and helpful great beds, close to shops, bars just a short walk to Temple 
Great to have ice dispenser on each floor . Breakfast top every option going can’t fault the hotel ",5,2020,01,23
231,Amazing breakfast and good location!,"The breakfast is sooo tasty and such a wide range of foods. Really good location, not too far from all the big attractions but not right in the hussle and bussle and you have everything you would need within walking distance. Pretty basic but it's all you need if you're out all day exploring!",4,2020,01,23
231,Short stop over ,Stayed here with colleagues midweek while in Dublin on business. Had a executive room which was large and spacious and had everything needed. Cannot comment on breakfast as the rate paid by my company did not include breakfast and I was not paying the exorbitant fee to eat so checked out and ate elsewhere. Central location and pleasant stay. ,4,2020,01,22
231,Dublin trip,Hotel very good. Nice staff who were happy to help. Room clean and bright with a comfy bed. Generally very impressed with the hotel. One minor criticism and that was the restaurant. Food was a bit hit and miss. I ordered a steak and it was excellent but the chips that came with it were very poor. Go to the bother of delivering a great steak but let down by frozen chips which were horrible. ,4,2020,01,21
231,Visit from Scotland,"
Very early check in as our room was ready. That was such an unexpected bonus. Great start to the day.
Room was a normal size for the standard rate that we paid. 
Shower was powerful.
Had it’s own ironing board, iron and hair dryer, which doesn’t usually happen in hotels.
Big bay windows. Great for light.
The temperature control unit was spot on. Hot or cold.
Bed was good.
Lobby area of the hotel smelled delicious. Small positive, but reassuring that they look after that area.
The actual hotel was absolutely spot on for the area. Airport shuttle bus stop is around the corner, tram around the corner, spire around the corner, temple bar a very very easy walk away. You catch my drift.lol

Like other reviewers have put up. The restaurant was closed on the Monday and Tuesday. Maybe due to lack of customers at this time of the year? The same meals were served in the bar area, which was probably better. Better atmosphere, plenty of seats, tv,s etc.
If you happen to stay in a room that’s overlooking the main stretch of road, be aware that it is rather noisy. The tram operates till late and starts early morning and loves to make a ding ding noise. The glazing isn’t the best. 
The windows are my only complaint for this hotel.",4,2020,01,21
231,Dissapointing,"Not to the usual standard for a hotel of its rating, resteraunt closed Tuesday & Wednesday evenings, didn't look on Thursday we went out to eat..... very noisy from both outside working and guests in the rooms either ide of us, no real noise insulation.",2,2020,01,20
231,Great,"Thank you for making my wife birthday weekend very joyful and we could not wished to have had a better weekend,the staff was very helpful and friendly,the breakfast was lovely and loads to choose from and the evening meals were very good too,the staff printed our broading passes off and very helpful in booking our taxi we no problem at all",5,2020,01,20
231,"Great Service, right next to the city centre.","Upgraded us to an executive room as our double wasnt available at checkin.

Couldn't do enough for you, excellent friendly staff. If we every return to Dublin we will be stopping there!

Breakfast was excellent and well stocked too.

Lovely clean room.",5,2020,01,20
231,Dublin weekend,"fantastic place to stay, not far from the river. great central point just far away enough from Temple Bar's hustle and bustle. Selection of drinks good, great range of breakfast items. was able to check in on line",5,2020,01,19
231,Two night stay ,"Good central location, close to City centre and main attractions. Clean and well presented. Friendly and helpful staff. Lovely room and comfy bed. Great food selection for breakfast. Highly recommend and would happily return. ",4,2020,01,19
231,Brilliant,"Arrived at the hotel and the staff couldn’t have done more for us! Jurys inn is very close to the Temple Bar atmosphere, it looks further apart on Maps but is a very quick walk. The hotel was glistening when we arrived, everywhere spotless. Very secure and safe, when we come back to the hotel late at night, a staff member would have to open the doors and take your door number, so you knew that not just anyone can come in the hotel. It’s very close to the airport, shops like Tesco was right opposite. Would definitely recommend this hotel, the breakfast in the mornings was lovely, really nice food and lots of options! I will  definitely be staying here again.",5,2020,01,18
231,1 night stay,"good location don't bother with online check in didnt work gave us our cards  but no room number plus they weren't activated. Receptionist who assisted us 
on check was very professional and helpful. If ordering room service and you have prepaid for your t
room be aware you will need to go down to reception to order and pay first very annoying that u cldnt pay once food arrived or by card. close  to luas line and Henry street
",3,2020,01,18
231,Great Stay and Helpful Staff,"Arranged this stay for my parents they had a great time and Goran at the desk helped me arrange a birthday treat for my mother. I asked him to deliver the treat by a certain time and he ensured this happened. 
They said the room was clean and comfortable. Great value for money. ",4,2020,01,18
231,Does what it needs to do,"Slightly less impressive than other Jurys I've stayed in, but it does what it should. Bathroom had some issues but nothing shocking. Breakfast was sufficient,  slightly overpriced. Friendly and helpful staff. Good location. Will stay again. ",4,2020,01,18
231,"Excellent service, location and Food","Excellent location, the attention of his people was the maximum.
Very quiet and cleanliness

231,Business Trip,Lovely hotel in great location. Bed and room was spot on! Food in the bar was stunning! Small gym onsite if fancy a work out. Close to many shops and bars. Just a 15 to 20 min walk to Temple Bar. So much to see and do. Beautiful city very clean and freindly ,5,2020,01,17
231,Comfortable and Reliable Hotel in Dublin,"Jurys Inn is a standard mid-range hotel chain that operates in Ireland and the UK. I saw these hotels in several cities I passed through during my visit to Ireland. 

I stayed at the Parnell street location in Dublin. My room and bed were comfortable, the bedding was and linens were nice. The staff was always friendly and helpful.Checking and checkout was hassle free.

The hotel offers free WiFi, and has a bar and restaurant and breakfast can be included in the cost of your room at a reasonable rate.

Henry street and the tram (Luas) are a 5 min walk, and the hotel is a 10 min walk to the river and the South side of Dublin.

It is a nice basic hotel that is a good value.",4,2020,01,15
231,Winter stay,Great location and prompt check-in and check out. Breakfast too was good. We arrived early and was given a room immediately. The room was large enough and the amenities provided were good. We were able to check out 3 hours later by paying 10 Euros per hour which was very reasonable,5,2020,01,15
231,Great stay in a good location,"We arrived at the hotel at 8:30am and was told our room wasn't ready (understandable). We went for breakfast and when we came down, the receptionist came over to us and said they have got a room prepared for us now, at no extra cost. Excellent! This meant we could get a few hours sleep before exploring Dublin (we had been up since 2am!).

The hotel is clean and quiet - even though we were on the same floor as the restaurant and bar, we never heard much noise at all (apart from at 1am, when someone was trying to open the adjourning door in our room - you know, the door which links 2 rooms together if you have a large family) - it made us shoot out of bed!

Free luggage storage too, so you can leave your bags on the last day if your flight is late. 

The area has lots of places to eat, but it is feels like it could be a rough area but never felt threatened. There is an Aldi, Lidl and Tesco within 3 minutes of the hotel too.

We'd stay here again.",5,2020,01,14
231,Excellent days in Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street,"Our family loved to be in Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street at the end of December, 2019. The location, the surrounding places, shopping streets all very nice. Also very easy to get around to the southern part of Dublin.",5,2020,01,13
231,Nice hotel in the city center,"We stayed in the hotel for three days, it was just perfect: great rooms, very clean, quiet, nice comfortable beds, great location in the city center, so you can easily go on foot everywhere, really recommend",5,2020,01,13
231,Good Room and Great Breakfast,"We paid £115 for a room for one night with breakfast included. The hotel is in a great location round the corner from Oconnell St and the Aircoach bus stop which takes you to and from the airport.
The lobby is clean and smells lovely and the staff are friendly and helpful, we were able to leave our bags with them while we explored before check in and after check out.
The hotel was pretty quiet when we were there but it was the first weekend in January after everyone had gone back to work.
The room was big enough with a bed and a sofa bed, there were plugs next to the bed which is always a bonus. 

The breakfast is excellent, gluten free options are available and theres a huge amount of choice for those who are not restricted - the sausages were lovely as was the white pudding. It was lovely to have soda bread for breakfast too.

Would definitely recommend and will absolutely stay again.",4,2020,01,13
231,Should be 5 star,One of the best hotels in Dublin. Close to most of the tourists sites. Tram is 5 minutes away. Some of the best bars in the area. The hotel is spotless. I was surprised how cheap it was. Breakfast is a must at the hotel.  ,5,2020,01,11
231,Good hotel," Convenient location to activities and tourist sites. Friendly staff.  The staff seemed overwhelmed with   customers the days we were there at check-in, in the bar (only place to eat) and at breakfast. Otherwise it was good.",4,2020,01,11
231,Leena,"The hotel has very good location in city center , not far from Henry street and the Temple area. The service was very good. The breakfast was good too. Near the hotel there was many good pubs and places to eat local food. ",5,2020,01,10
231,Parnell St jury’s,"The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, even organising taxis to a concert venue for us. There were double panes of glass in the room, but we were still woken by a vehicle reversing in the building site behind the hotel, as our room was at the back. But every other aspect was just perfect for our family of 5 children and my sister in law. ",4,2020,01,09
231,Excellent choice,We had great time at this hotel. The room was warm and clean and the breakfast was excellent. Kostas- the head chef- does excellent job there! We enjoy every minute and the stuff was very helpful in every possible way!Thank you.,5,2020,01,08
231,Disappointed as room was freezing &refused another a room.,"Disappointed as room was freezing, refused another room, given electric heater. Had 3 month old baby with us , breakfast cold and smell of cigarette smoke thru avent in room. Good location , close to all amenities ",2,2020,01,08
231,Very disappointed with staff,"The manager of this hotel is one of the rudest staff member that I have ever encountered and his total lack of customer relations needs to be revised by this hotel. Would not recommend this establishment, there is a severe lack of professionalism with regard to their manager Adrian [--]. The manner in which me and my friends were dealt with, who were paying customers may I add, was appalling. Anyone looking to stay in this hotel would be making a big mistake.",1,2020,01,08
231,Truly remarkable hotel,"We have booked an executive room for 7 days.
First of all the location of this hotel is really excellent. Everything is within walking distance, for example the temple bar area within 10-15min , the Guinness factory in 20min etc. 
Also the most of the tourist offices have the meeting points for their busses at the O’ Connell street just in 2 min walk.
So, if you plan to book some daily tour, the location of the hotel is very convenient. The cleanness was daily and extremely good and the staff were kind and helpful with very easy & quick check in & check out. 
PS. I already miss this bed!!!!
Ιf I have to write a negative comment about this hotel, this is about the price and the value for money stay. But Dublin hotels are generally extremely (perhaps unjustifiably) expensive especially during the Christmas period. So, from this point of view, this hotel compared to the prices of this period and the other hotels, is a very good and advantageous choice.",4,2020,01,08
231,Good location,"Great location and easy check in / check out! Room was in OK condition, wish it was a little bit better. The bathroom was a tad bit old/dirty. We weren't in the hotel often so it wasn't really an issue, so overall it was perfect for our trip especially since we were fairly close to the Train stations and top sites.",4,2020,01,07
231,xmas Day Dinner,The staff in the hotel dining room were very friendly & made you feel welcome . Also reception staff very helpful & friendly The problem is the Hotel Chef he needs to be sent back to college to learn how to serve food . Our Xmas Day Dinner looked like a dogs dinner on the plate Spoiled our stay for Xmas ,5,2020,01,06
231,Jurys Inn Dublin,"Good hotel and not bad location for general tourist attractions.  Close to bus for arrrival and departure too.  Staff helpful and breakfast very good in terms of selection and amount,  Room was clean and comfortable, we had a room for 3 and while fine as we did not spend much time in the room woud be small if there for a long stay",4,2020,01,06
231,Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street Christmas 2019,Good for a tour. Central place. In the heart of city. Not very good climate. Could be improved breakfast. Bathroom a little noise. Comfortable room. There is no mini-bar in our room. Anyway you can try it.,4,2020,01,06
231,"Handy, quiet location.",Being a family we chose to stay on the north side of the river away from the Temple Bar nightlife and found this hotel perfect for our needs. It was just a short walk to catch a tram but we also covered a lot of Dublin on foot. The hotel rooms were quiet which suited us to a tee after pounding the pavement sightseeing in the daylight hours. A family member needed to see a Doctor during our stay and we were relieved when hotel staff pointed us in the direction of medical services close by on Parnell Street.,4,2020,01,04
231,Wonderful hotel in Dublin,"Jurys Inn was a wonderful place to stay during our two nights in Dublin. It's in a great location that's conveniently near transportation, restaurants, and pubs.

I would definitely consider staying here again the next time I visit Dublin.",5,2020,01,04

231,Great stay,Stayed here with my husband and 2 kids for one night and everything was excellent. The room was sparkling clean and everything was very comfortable.

231,Hard beds,"Location was in good area -  clean hotel - room was ok but not as photos depicted.  
The bed was far too hard and we both ended up with achey backs.  Didn't eat at hotel as was cheaper to use local shops and restaurants. Though we did drink at the bar and it was quite expensive but was warned about that",3,2020,01,02
231,Great stay,We stayed here for 3 nights. Great room. Very friendly and helpful staff. Bar people great. Easy check in and out. Everything within walking distance!! Couldn't ask for more. I will be staying here again in the future and would recommend this to anyone.,5,2020,01,01

Our room was very quiet, considering we were in such a busy part of the city. Had a really nice meal in the 2nd floor restaurant, for a very reasonable price, where Ciara and her team looked after us really well. Nothing was any trouble, even washing baby bowls and getting a cup of milk.  Breakfast was lovely too. Overall, great service, very friendly staff. Will definitely return.",4,2019,12,30

231,Great location ,"Stayed for one night would have been very happy to stay longer.
Check In was fast and professional,  room was small but clean and had everything we needed. Breakfast was excellent,  really enjoyed the crispy potatoes.
The hotel is located in the centre of  Dublin city by one of Dublin's luas stops (tram stop). There is also a major shopping area within four minutes walk of the hotel. All the tour buses and the airport bus stop just around the corner.",5,2019,12,21
231,Mr,"Great location, excellent breakfast spread. Tram service at the door. Irish pub food nearby. Onsite bar is a good place to start or meet. Handy to shops, shopping, outlets, ect, ect, 200 characters ffs,,,,,",5,2019,12,18
231,We expected more from this brand,"Currently staying at Jury’s Inn Dublin, whilst our room is admittedly a standard room, it is incredibly basic, with a tiny TV that will only play the first 5 channels, and so cold we’ve had to request a free standing heater. If you are looking for a “couples city retreat” this falls short of home comforts, although it is conveniently situated for many attractions. I’d say ok for a quick business trip perhaps but not for leisure, just too basic an offer.",2,2019,12,18
231,A weekend break,Needed somewhere central for me and my daughter to stay with a friend that we were meeting up with. 5 mins in taxi from heuston station. City centre on your doorstep. Hotel were great to get a taxi within 5 mins from the time you needed it. ,4,2019,12,18
231,Not as it used to be,"Last year the room was equiped with a safety box and a fridge free of charge, this year they told us that it was upon request. Furthermore they used to have apples at the exit of the elevators, amenities in the bathroom, chocolate every day... so in conclusion less for more. However, nice staff and very helpful.",3,2019,12,18
231,Great hotel!,We were very happy with the room. Everything was very clean and room was really big. The hotel is in really busy area but we had no problem sleeping and night. We would recommend a restaurant on 2nd floor i think . Food is great and service was brilliant. We had very nice waitress and very professional. Her name is Irina. All in all very pleasant stay and we are very happy with hotel and service provided . ,5,2019,12,18
231,Great time,"Stayed for a few days and had a good time. Steak and nachos were great to line the stomach for a night out. Didn't spend much time in the bar but when I was it was amazing service off Emilia, friendly and a great chat even when shes busy she still does her best to make you comfortable, would stay again just for that.",5,2019,12,17
231,Has it all!,"From the minute we arrived the staff were exceptional. Friendly, pleasant & efficient in every dept. Great location, a stones throw from Henry & O Connell St. Had a meal in the bar on our first evening & while it was slow coming from the kitchen, it was worth the wait. Portions were generous, presentation was appealing & price was reasonable. Our room was spacious, bright & warm. Had all the room comforts you would expect. Ice &  cold water available on every floor & vending machines in reception & on some floors too. Breakfast had good choice, though we had to wait for more hot food as we went during rush time. Reception staff were extremely obliging and  pleasant. Was our second time to stay here & we will return for a city break again.",5,2019,12,16
231,Long weekend stay,"Very nice staff and very 
good location. Very tasty bar menu, but breakfast selection rather limited. Nevertheless, overall, a good place for a stay of several days. We had a relaxing time thanks to super friendly staff.",4,2019,12,16
231,Jury's inn Parnell street Dublin,"Just had to a fantastic stay ãt Jury's inn in Dublin, Parnell street.

Great location, Tesco straight from across the road, everything close by, transfer by bus is 30 mins. Many taxis around if you prefer.

Hotel staff can really recommend this hotel for your a stay in Dublin.

Great pubs, and shopping centres all around, 10 mins walk to temple bar, first time in Dublin, loved it.",5,2019,12,12
231,Very comfortable and affordable.,"I booked this during a flash sale and I got a very good deal with breakfast included.
The room was very comfortable. The bar is modern. We availed of the Spire parking for 15 euro for 24 hours. It's about a 5 min walk away. 
It's very close to the Henry St. and Jervis shops.
I would stay there again. ",5,2019,12,12
231,More Premier Inn than Hilton,"Maybe our expectations were too high for this hotel but we were a little disappointed. The check-in procedure was good with a friendly and helpful receptionist. Our room was on the fourth floor and overlooking an inner courtyard thus it was quiet. I think it was the room that we weren't keen on. Large double bed plus a single.....not ideal for a couple. The wardrobe was open fronted displaying all of our clothes, there wasn't a safe nor a fridge which, we think, are basic necessities now. Bottled water, vouchers for costa coffee and newspapers each day were a nice touch however. Bathroom was functional but shower curtains should be consigned to history. Bed was comfortable although not well made each day. Everyone  we encountered were friendly and the lifts were frequent when needed. Breakfast was in the restaurant which is nice. The choice was really good but the quality of the cooked food was just adequate.
The hotel itself is well positioned, closed to O'Connell Street shops, bars and eating places. Also it's a short walk to No1 stop for the Hop-on, hop-off tourist bus which is a must. 
Overall the hotel is clean, warm and comfortable but nearer 3 star to 4. ",3,2019,12,11
231,Amazing location and amazing hotel,"Perfect location in the middle of everything you need. Friendliest staff and beautiful spotless rooms.
Second time staying here for a shopping trip and would highly recommend. It is decorated beautifully also",5,2019,12,10

231,Appaling,"Lady at reception didnt have the right room for us at check in, had to show proof that we booked a family room. We paid with cash upon arrival, money was taken out of my card upon further inspection, I was assured it was only an issue with the bank and that I would receive my money back. After a week Money got taken out of my card regardless, I was told a manger was sorting it out and I would get a call back, had to ring three times as I got no call back. Final time ringing i got on to the manager who then told me i would have to wait a further 2 to 3 working days to receive my own money back, my compensation was the next time i stay I could get free breakfast or a room upgrade. I will not be giving this company my card details anymore so this compensation is useless to me ",1,2019,12,10
231,Ideal hotel for a weekend in Dublin,"Hotel position was good. Easy walking to places of interest. Hotel was clean & quiet. The bar was quite lively the night we visited it, disappointed that they were advertising an offer of a bottle of prosecco for £20 but when we asked for it we were told they didn't have any. We ate in the bar on our first night, food was average, staff were very good.",5,2019,12,09
231,Very Convenient and Pleasant,We stayed for 3 nights. First impressions were that it needs a refresh as it is looking a bit faded. It provided its service as a City Hotel well - except for breakfast which was awful. We had not booked breakfast but on the last morning we were in a hurry so we ate there. It was the most expensive we had whilst we were in Dublin and by far the worst. There are some very good restaurants open for breakfast extremely close by. I suggest you try them,4,2019,12,08
231,Ladies toilets filthy and glass in bar when handed to me  was dirty and stained.,"Visited this bar on our family Christmas annual outing.  The ladies toilets were disgusting with toilet damp paper shrewn around the floor and the floor wet and slippery.  No dry toilet tissue to use.  Foul smell all the way up the stairs.  
When my drink was served to me my glass was dirty and unwashed.  
Very disappointing.  Bad service.  Very little English from bar men.  No English speaking staff.  And very unhelpful and uninviting.  Would never return.",1,2019,12,08

231,Great Location and nice rooms,"We had a 3 nights stay on 4th floor. It was a room away from the street and nice quiet at night. Rooms are not big but you have what you need and everything is clean. Breakfast buffet is not great but good.Hotel is located next to shopping streets, restaurants, pubs etc. Walking distance to everything and the bus to Airport is just around the corner. ",5,2019,12,02
231,Fantastic service and exceptional location,It's a 10ish minute walk to the Temple bar and George St area but it's the staff that really make this hotel shine. I've stayed in lots of Jury's Inns over the years but these guys really did go over and above for us.,5,2019,12,02

Bathroom spotlessly clean and functional

231,Comfortable and convenient,"Pleasant, cosy, and excellently located. Small room with too small a bed though. Very thin walls, you can hear your neighbours talk. Good breakfast. The location was perfect for us because it was walking distance from the centre and also very close to some Joyce-related sites such as the James Joyce Centre and the college he went to.",4,2019,12,02

231,Excellent hotel,"The room were so cleaned and were very comfortable. The bed was so awesome. The only bad thing was that our room was not exterior, but it wasn't so important, since we only went to sleep.  And the service was super correct. Thanks for all. ",5,2019,11,24
231,STANDARD EXPERIENCE FROM STANDARD ROOM,"Did an overnight stay in Dublin city. Booked through exterior website for best rate. Check in was fine - Rosalie? Room was standard double - bed was a double but seemed small. Was soft, clean and comfortable. Room was quite basic overall but thankfully spent most of the time uptown.
Breakfast is best described as ok. Welcome was not particularly good. Choice was all pretty standard but not well cooked. You know when the bacon is stuck together that it has been deep fried from the packet with inside half cooked. Everything is self service from making toast to hot water in a mug with a teabag. This hotel's biggest selling point must be the location which is almost perfect. Would go back at the right price!!",4,2019,11,24
231,Great hotel in the City center ,"It’s a great value for your money this hotel, it’s just a 10 minutes walk to the center of the City, where you can find any type of buses to your destination. It’s clean, well presented and overall very good. I just wished they upgrade it’s breakfast bufé as I felt it was very basic and not tasty. ",4,2019,11,23
231,Lovely short stay ,"Only stayed for 1 night on business. Ample staff on the desk for checking in. Very well presented, clean and welcoming lobby. No wait for lifts. Nice, quiet & comfortable room on the 5th floor. Good choice for breakfast and very polite staff. ",5,2019,11,22

231,Handy comfortable place to stay,I had a very comfortable room and the service was great - I love hotels that provide a kettle and plenty of teabags  - this was up to standard. The service in the bar/restaurant was great and the staff were very friendly.,5,2019,11,18

security system to ensure that only guests circulate in the hotel
Good Breakfast and an excellent Halloween.

231,Nice place to stay in Dublin,The hotel is located a short distance from the river and many of the key attractions. The rooms were cosy - warm shower and comfortable bed.

The staff were excellent but especially the security man who was very helpful and full of knowledge of places to go thank you.
Would defo recommend this hotel a great base to see Dublin ",4,2019,11,16
231,Great hotel and great breakfast ,"My family enjoyed our stay at Jurys Inn off Parnell St.  the amenities were great.  The room was clean and neat.  The staff was very friendly and hospitable.  We really loved the breakfast buffet.  The hostess was so friendly and accommodated my toddler with fun activity play packets.  The location is great and right near O’Connell.  It’s a good walk to Temple Bar and main attractions but very doable.  It actually might be a good thing to be a little away from all the action but close enough if you need some.  I wish there was a security safe in the room but Dublin is really safe anyways and I wouldn’t worry too much about that kinda stuff... but, if you need to lock something up, you’ll have to lock it up in the complimentary safes in the lobby.  They’ll loan you the key but you’ll pay a hefty fine if you lose that key.  That was the only thing that was a little out of the ordinary for me but maybe I’m spoiled with in room safes.  Otherwise, I would certainly come back here for accommodations when in Dublin.  ",5,2019,11,16
231,short break,"An excellent hotel located very centrally, close to the city centre and handy for aerlink coaches.   All staff were respectful and helpful.  I have been here before and each time I come to Dublin, I try to get a room at this hotel ",5,2019,11,14

231,Long weekend in Dublin,"My stay at Jury's Inn was very positive. I don't usually stay at a modern hotel ( usually do B n' B's) but it was my first time to Dublin and I wanted something well situated, with lots of shopping and restaurants nearby - my reason for choosing Jury's Inn. ",5,2019,11,13
231,Jury's Inn Parnell Street.,I chose your hotel because of the reasonable price i got on booking.com. The location was ideal aswell close to bus aras and O Connell street. Not being from Dublin i needed somewhere central and close to the concert Venue i attended. Your premises was perfect for my short city break.   ,5,2019,11,12

231,Great Location,"Perfect walking distance from everywhere but far enough to not fear being noisy.

The hotel bar had great hours but had very limited seating. The price was very reasonable for the stay.

The room was a good size and my fiance and I liked that we could link the beds together.
",5,2019,11,11
231,Great hotel,"Great location, good value for money, lovely selection for breakfast, rooms were clean and all usual facilities included. My only criticism and it’s minor is just that the family room could have been slightly bigger but it was adequate size for one night so no real complaints",5,2019,11,11
231,Staying for concert,"Lovely hotel.great location. Just the room was quite cold,had to leave on the heat all day and all evening. But apart from that, it was a nice room with a great front view.. food was only ok. There was 1 nice lad at reception, very friendly. And the girl at the bar at night time,was very nice. Will be back to revisit.",4,2019,11,11
231,"Perfect location, comfortable hotel","The hotel is very central with great amenities and shops nearby. It lacks the finer details that would make it a standout hotel but in terms of comfort, value for money and cleanliness, you won’t find better. We stayed for just one night but look forward to staying again. ",3,2019,11,09
231,Jurys Inn review,"Very good hotel, me and my friends had very enjoyable time.
The room was large enough for the three of us and i loved the big buffet offered for breakfast. All the staff was nice and friendly with us.",4,2019,11,09
231,Great Hotel in Central Dublin,"Excellent location for this hotel ln central Dublin. Recommended by many and they were all right. Jurys Inn is a real find. Amazing service throughout our stay. Polite, friendly and professional staff at all levels; house keeping, front desk, bar, restaurant, and management. Perfect place to stay when in Dublin. Best Coffee with Bailey Irish Cream I have ever had. Worth a stay.",5,2019,11,08
231,An excellent experience: above and beyond the call of duty,"Myself and my best friend stayed in Parnell St Juries on Saturday 2nd November 2019. We were only due to stay the night, and to arrive very late, as we were attending a gig in the 3 Arena on the quays.

I checked in alone, and the staff were extremely professional and courteous, walking that notoriously fine line between being chatty and being intrusive.  The Duty Manager politely asked whether I had any plans, and I told what gig we were going to.

Room was spotless, well-furnished, well-stocked with all toiletries, conveniences and water/tea/coffee and was much more spacious than I had anticipated.

So far, a comfortable 4/5 experience. 

Then the heavens opened. 

To make a long story short, it rained so heavily for so long, on such a cold and unpleasant night, that myself and my mate were soaked to the skin, and unfit to even sit in a warm pub, let alone stand in a crowded concert hall. My ticket had disintegrated in the rain and - although the steward would still let me in - we called it a night and decided to go back to Jurys to try and at least dry off.

The staff could NOT have been more helpful. They provided us with extra towels, ensured we had all the hair-dryers/water/coffee etc we needed, and were just generally superb.

As it was so early (but still lashing), we considered going to the bar in the Hotel. I had a change of clothes, but my poor buddy was stuck wearing my running gear.  Again, the staff were super accommodating and allowed us sit in the bar despite our somewhat bedraggled experience.

I slept like a log, and the breakfast was superb.  

This is my first review but - as is probably clear from the singular nature of the night's events, and the phenomenal service we received - I felt I had to leave a well-deserved and glowing review.

The experience was excellent, even without our particular needs on the night. Overall, a well-earned 5 star review.",5,2019,11,08
231,Jury's Parnell Street Dublin,"Service was excellent, room was clean & comfortable. Bar area welcoming, however prices are a bit steep. 
Disappointed that as I was not taking breakfast and only wanted a coffee I was charged 3 Euros
20, this felt a bit mean.
Also it would be an idea perhaps to have a separate price for guests, like myself, who just want a continental breakfast and not a cooked one.
Apart from above minor complaints our stay was enjoyable. 
Hotel is well situated for shopping, cinemas, restaurants & bars which are all within a short walk.

",4,2019,11,07
231,Dublin weekend," the lokation was very good, standard rooms, breakfast was ok for normal people but not for me who is gluten alergic. good check in and check out. good service bookin taxi. bathroom was standard but clean .beds very good. personal very polite and nice.

231,Mother and daughter mini break,"Excellent for shopping, everything on your doorstep. Reception staff very friendly and the early check in and noon check out were a huge advantage to us. Room was large with a double for me and a single for my daughter, plenty of space for us and our shopping. Bathroom could have been a little cleaner,(skirting board and around the toilet)the shower was super and plenty of hot water all day.Will definitely return in the future.",4,2019,11,06
231,Great hotel. Room was very roomy. Close to all amenities.,"Even though the hotel is in a great location and you can walk to all areas of the city centre, The Guinness tour, The Jameson’s tour, Molley Malone & most importantly The Temple Bar.  it’s also on a quiet street. So win win. 
Staff are really friendly. 
",5,2019,11,05
231,Jury's went above and beyond for the marathon runners,"We stayed in Jurys Inn the night before the Dublin marathon. They had an early breakfast for runners which was ideal. They had a room available until that evening for runners (who had checked out in the morning) to shower in which was much needed  and appreciated before our bus back to Cork. All staff went above and beyond during our stay. Would definitely recommend, especially for people running the marathon in the future.",5,2019,11,05
231,Great stay. Good location! No issues.,"Had a message to say rooms were ready which was an hour before expected check in which was great! It meant rather than drop off luggage we took it up to the room.  

Room was clean and looked very modern. Light cracks to some tiles on bathroom floor but nothing else to report.

Breakfast was really tasty and plenty of choice, bar area lovely and had a really comfortable night.  Only disturbance was a couple noisy guests but hotel itself fab and in a really good location!",5,2019,11,04
231,"Good location, rooms need a spruce","Good location, rooms need a spruce. Bath was blocked and not draining but was sorted in 6 hours. Bathroom was mouldy on the ceiling. Shower curtain was gross. Bed sheets all had Brown marks on them. 
Bar staff were average, 200 ml soft drinks were crap and no soft drinks on tap so uber expensive. ",3,2019,11,04
231,Quality doesn’t justify the price,"Stayed there in October last week 2019. The hotel is very pricy for the quality of room and bathroom it provides. My bathroom sink has crack marks and chipped, giving a very run down feeling. Except for the location, nothing about this hotel is positive. ",1,2019,11,04
231,Centrally located,"City Hotel, room is very small, bed are comfortable, bathroom looks outdated and needs to be improved. The Location is Great, everything is within walking distance. Breakfast is just average. Ist not a 4 Star Hotel for me, Maximum 3 Star.",3,2019,11,04
231,Nice Hotel in Dublin,"This hotel is nice and very safe for a solo female traveler. The breakfast area is decent, but the dinner service was wanting. Ended up eating at the bar instead and there was a fantastic bartender. I sadly don’t remember his name. The location is away from the Temple Bar area, so it is more quiet in the evening. Overall, it was a nice stay with comfortable beds. ",4,2019,11,01
231,Well worth every penny,Staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was amazing and the bed was so comfortable. The hotel is located near so many shops and restaurants will definitely be staying here again. Would reccomend it 100%,5,2019,10,31
231,"Solid,not 4 star","Average but clean room. No pen,paper, clock, safe, Gideon’s bible. Location ok, near shopping. Across the River is the fun side. Staff great, friendly.  Can hear all that is going on in hallway, and hence visa Versace.",3,2019,10,30
231,VERY GOOD,"Although the room service did not work, the room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Check in was super easy with the screens in reception as it meant no waiting times and the location was perfect, right in the centre of Dublin. ",4,2019,10,30

231,Dublin Weekend Break,"Great hotel, lovely bar and it’s within walking distance to Temple Bar with good amenities near by. Do not book through Opodo though as we booked and paid for B&B but never got the breakfast (Opodo mistake) and Opodo also cancelled our return flights to Glasgow without letting us know by email resulting in us having to pay £400 extra to return home on the same flight we had originally booked. Jurys is great but Opodo suck...!!! ",4,2019,10,29
231,Very upset,"I booked,  reserved , phoned in advance and everything for connecting rooms travelling with 5 children I was expecgted to be okay with them elsewhere in hotel! 
Staff should be better informed of the hotel rooming list and layout and communicate in advance with guests not leave them to ring and advise you that you messed up. ",1,2019,10,29
231,Great stay,"Clean rooms. Executive room was worth upgrade price, king size bed and more floor space. Small gym.  Friendly staff. Good restaurant and bar. Close to sights and bus stops.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,10,28
231,Great end to trip,"The hotel was clean, comfortable and the staff were all friendly.  This was the last stop of a two week vacation where we stayed in various accommodations.  It was a lovely way to end the trip.  The rooms were comfortable.  The restaurant and bar area was delicious and inviting.  I will be coming back",5,2019,10,28
231,Friends away,"Convenient location, secure comfortable
Single Beds need caster stops to stop movement. Coffee needs upgrading. Bottled water would be good. Biscuits useful. Auto checkin did not work but receptionist was good. ",4,2019,10,28
231,Perfect location for our stay in Dublin,"We had a very pleasant stay at the Jurys Inn Parnell Street - very helpful and friendly even from our check-in - and the good service kept on during the 3 days/nights we enjoined the hotel.
We enjoyed the spacious room - no 213 - and the quietness - we will be back at a later time",5,2019,10,28
231,Excellent stay,We stayed at Jurys Inn for three nights on October. The staff were very helpful and friendly and made us feel welcome throughout our stay. Early arrival and late departure were no problem. Also the location of the hotel is good. When we come back to Dublin we are definitely going to stay at Jurys Inn again!,5,2019,10,28
231,Friends away days,"Very convenient for transfers from airport, literally 5mins to the bus. Comfortable clean room. Tea tray could have been better. Upgrade of coffee definitely needed and a few biscuits would have helped. Not to far to walk to main areas. Good facilities in same area. Would use again.",4,2019,10,27
231,Excellent location,"Nice hotel on great location, friendly staff, excellent breakfast. Hotel is just about to main Dublin street where all airport buses are arriving as well as excursion buses. Staff is very friendly and willing to give you all reccomendations.",5,2019,10,26
231,Perfect stay,We had a great time. The room was very clean and quiet. Breakfast: a lot of choice and the staff is very friendly. Gave a lot of good tips. Really good hotel and we definitely would like to come back here. ,5,2019,10,26
231,Disappointing stay ,"Let me start by saying I am a well-travelled person who takes most TripAdvisor reviews with a grain of salt. However, I was quite disappointed with our stay at Jury's Inn. My husband and I were excited as this hotel was one of the more expensive ones on our trip. We had certain standards in mind (being a 4 star hotel) and they were simply not met. 

Check in took over 30 minutes and when we finally got checked in the person at the desk claimed I had not paid (which I had, in full, and had to produce my credit card bill to prove as much), Wi-Fi did not work the entire stay (no compensation was offered nor an apology when I addressed this at checkout) and early checkout did not work due to said Wi-Fi issue. These issues are small but being a 4 star hotel being unable to connect to Wi-Fi and having one person working the desk at peak check-in time (from 3pm) is bizarre to me. It affected our stay as we needed to be connected to work and family back in Australia. Time wise, we simply did not have the patience after an extended trip to wait 30+ minutes to be checked in and the final nail in the coffin was being told I owed the hotel when I had paid in full six months prior. These areas need serious consideration from management to prevent this from happening to guests/how to manage this effectively when it does. 

With that said, it was not all bad. The bed and room were comfortable and safe, the breakfast buffet was fantastic and the staff were friendly - probably the best asset this hotel has. The hotel was well located. 

Was this was perhaps a series of unfortunate occurances that happened at all once and we were unlucky? Probably. 

With the plethora of other options available in Dublin at this high price point would we book with Jury's Inn again? No. ",3,2019,10,24
231,Great hotel for a family weekend,"Great hotel for a family weekend in Dublin. Perfect location, large room, comfy beds and good breakfast. Short distance to hop on-hop off bus and airport buses (approximate 2 min), and with traditional fish&chips restaurant across the street.",5,2019,10,24
231,"Great location, nice hotel",Everything was to a good standard about this hotel. It was in a great location for the city center and near to public transport. Breakfast was good and plenty of choice. Staff were friendly and helpful too.,5,2019,10,24
231,No,"Even though the location is great, the price is right, and the breakfast is extensive, just say no.  There were cobwebs in the room. The beds were really really bad. I had a backache the day after my first night. The pillows were also really bad. There has to be a better hotel in this city. ",2,2019,10,24
231,Nice clean Hotel,"This hotel was very clean and close to the port, were drove into Dublin and had a nice stay. 
The room was clean but we were not placed very close to an elevator, The clerk did not notice the mobility challeged person i was travelling with and was too busy talking amongst themselves instead of helping the guests in the hotel. The breakfast was far less appealing than the Jurys inn we stayed in, in Belfast.",3,2019,10,23
231,Group journey with our english course (business english),The personal is very friendly. The location is very clear to the most interesting attractions so you can go on foot. A room changing was no problem. The station  for the sky bus is very closed to the hotel.,5,2019,10,23
231,My favourite hotel in Dublin,"It Is the third time I am guest of Jurys Inn Parnell street and I would definitively recommend It. It is located in the city centre and all the bus stops are closed. The personnel is super kind and professional, rooms are clean and breakfast is rich and complete. Since I am often in Dublin for work i don't have any doubts that I will choose Jurys Inn also the next times.",5,2019,10,23
231,A nice hotel in a pretty good location,"A nice hotel in a pretty good location. Helpful and service-oriented staff. Yet, since the hotel was pretty expensive, for the amount I've paid, I would expect that the hotel will be in a better condition, since there are parts that need some ""face-lifting"". Also, although I can't say that the room was dirty, I've been to much cleaner hotel rooms that this one.",4,2019,10,23
231,Excellent experience,"The hotel has a very good location, one block from O'Connell street, a commercial area, near plenty of restaurants, bars and supermarkets. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The hotel staff was very kind and ready to help at any moment. Very good breakfast. ",5,2019,10,22
231,Barb and Earle’s stay in Dublin,"Great brekky, and hotel was in a good location, heart of Dublin. Easy to find and to go on day outings from. Good nights sleep, we stay for 11 nights. Brekky gave us a good start for every day, didn’t need lunch some days.",4,2019,10,22
231,Honeymoon to DUB,"Hotel was in a great location! You can't beat it - in the heart of it all. The staff were friendly. When the woman at the front desk realized it was our honeymoon she offered us 2 breakfast vouchers. Hotel does need to be updated, however.",5,2019,10,22
231,4 Day Dublin-Trip,"We were a group of 10 people, had a stay of 3 nights in the Jury Inn Dublin and enjoyed it. The staff was very nice and competent. The breakfast buffet was also very good. We cannot say anything negative.",5,2019,10,22
231,Amazing hotel,Really good hotel. Excellent location and rooms are very clean and well equipped. Staff also are very nice and friendly. Also they will look after your luggage if you have a late flight even after the check out. ,5,2019,10,21
231,Weekend break,Nice hotel in a great location. Had booked breakfast which was excellent with a huge choice. Room was very clean with really comfortable beds and pillows. Hotel bar was a nice place to relax after a busy day.,5,2019,10,21
231,Very disappointing,"The hotel is located on a rather seedy street in a seedy part of town. We felt quite uncomfortable walking to the hotel, especially in the evening. The hotel lacks any personality and the service is equally unimpressive.
The room was clean and quiet but if we ever return to Dublin it will not be to this hotel",1,2019,10,20
231,Ring the hotel if you have a special request,"We booked this hotel two months before our trip through Aer Lingus website as we were flying with them and booked a room with a sofa but requested a shower only as I cannot get in a bath.

On going to the room which was on the second floor overlooking Parnell Street, we saw how spacious it was but it had a bath.  My husband rang reception but they had no rooms available with a shower only.  We were moved the following day to a quieter room with a walk-in shower but it was smaller and only had a chair for one person.  We were not happy that one of us had to sit on the bed but didn't complain again as at least I could have a shower.  We just didn't feel we got what we paid for.

We cannot comment about the food as we didn't eat there.  Reception staff were pleasant and helpful in spite of working in a very busy environment.  The lobby sometimes felt like Kings Cross station!  

Water is available in a dispenser in the lobby and taxis can easily be found in the rank outside the hotel.

Parnell Street is off O'Connell which is being worked on as it has been allowed to deteriorate.  We felt this is a medium grade hotel in a slightly rundown area.",4,2019,10,20
231,"Uncomfortable bed, phone problems","We found the bed very uncomfortable and small, and our room facing the street was so noisy it sounded like the window was open, although it was not. We also did not feel comfortable in the area after dark.
I also had problems trying to use the phone. I needed to contact British Airways and didn't want to use my cell since I get charged by the minute and there was a long hold time. First I was told I couldn't make outgoing call from the room. Then later I was told they have to turn it on after taking my credit card information (which they had). Then the number still did not work, although I was able to reach it with my cell.",3,2019,10,19
231,Hated it,"Stayed here 2 days last week and hated it.

10-minute wait behind a group booking, which was still being booked in when a second member of staff finally logged on and invited others to check in.

I was asked for my credit card, which I expected would be used as preauthorisation for things such as breakfast. It wasn't explained to me that it wouldn't cover this, and I was not asked if I also wanted to do a preauthorisation. More on this later.

The room itself was a major let-down, and this was an Executive Room, 409. It was very dark with all the lights on and on the small side. The TV was like something from the 1980s - SD only and about 10 channels. In this day and age, that doesn't cut it.

The first night, I tried dinner in the restaurant. It took a full hour from placing our order to get served, with an overcooked burger and bland fries. My colleague ordered fish with ""potatoes and seasonal vegetables"" and got fish with a few cherry tomatoes and chips! Other guests were also complaining about both the wait and the quality of the food.

Now, onto that breakfast. Nothing wrong with the selection, but what I absolutely object to, having paid nearly 200 Eur a night for the room, is an embarrassing situation when you are asked for your room number, told that breakfast was not included, requested that they add it to the bill, get told that you didn't preauthorise with your card (like that's MY fault?!) and then wait (in front of about 10 other guests waiting to be seated) while you're dragged through the humiliation of the waitress phoning reception to confirm that you're trying to cheat them by not paying for your breakfast.

This should never happen in any hotel. It certainly shouldn't happen in a supposed 4-star Jury's Inn at nearly 200 Euro a night.

Strongly not recommended.",1,2019,10,19
231,Good stay in Dublin,"Traditional hotel in a good location. Excellent breakfast. Could use some updates in room like USB ports and a safe. Comfortable beds, helpful staff. Definitely an adequate accommodation in busy area but room was quiet but not outstanding. Fair price for Dublin.",4,2019,10,17
231,Lovely hotel in Dublin city centre,"Great room and service... reception always booked us taxis when we asked...great restaurant and staff!
Little frustrated because I brought my straight iron (chi limited edition breast cancer edition) and asked reception what I needed because the wattage was a lot...from the states...they told me a converter...I had an adapter...went out and purchased converter...chi didn't work so I had to go out and buy a cheap hair straightener...got back to states and my chi does not work anymore!",5,2019,10,15
231,"Hotel Jury's Inn Parnel street Dublin, 4 days 5 nights with kids","The hotel is very centrally located. The rooms are very specious and well kept. The breakfast is almost lavish. Best for people who are visiting Dublin for sightseeing. Most places can be visited by walk. If you are plannig to take guided tours, most of the tour companies start their tours from places near the hotel. 
The staff is very courteous and welcoming.
There is only one negative I faced is that, before travel I had sent an email to the hotel enquiring about an important matter. I never received any reply from them. When I called up they said they will reply in sometime, but again the reply never came.",5,2019,10,15
231,All Good,"My husband and I stayed for 2 nights in September 2019 as part of a site seeing trip around Ireland.

The hotel is 5-10 minutes' walk from the bus stop (from the airport).  We arrived at about midnight and the check-in was quick so we could get to our room.  It is very corportate so what you expect is what you get.  Complimentary tea and coffee was a bit tight - only enough milk for 1 very strong cuppa each!  We booked room only and ate breakfast out (One Society - 5/10 minutes' walk, great place).

Technically, it's on the wrong side of the river for site seeing but we preferred it.  It was only about 10 minutes' walk to the main sites and it was good not to be in the centre of the tourist area.  

It felt like we were paying a lot for the room but I guess this is down to Dublin being expensive and the value of sterling being low.",4,2019,10,15
231,Jury's Inn Parnell Street,Staff were courteous and helpful. The rooms were comfortable and clean. Unfortunately I had booked with Booking.Com and was disappointed with their service however Jury's Inn staff were a pleasure to deal with.,5,2019,10,15
231,Stay at Jurys Inn Dublin,We had a very nice stay at the Jurys Inn on Parnell street in Dublin. The rooms were very clean and neat. They also had a very nice selection for breakfast. Centrally located to many restaurants and a nice walk from other attractions. A great place to stay!,5,2019,10,14
231,Very good,Very good. Excellent breakfast good value for money. Comfortable beds. Staff were very friendl . I would come back again. Location is good. Not far from the shopping center mc donals KFC burger king tescos etc,5,2019,10,14

231,"Central location, quiet hotel","Booked this hotel two months before visit and had a very quick acknowledgement for a request for a quiet room. 

Got the 747 bus from the airport and had a short walk to the hotel 

Quick and welcoming check in. 

Comfortable beds and room had everything needed. 

Friendly staff from the reception to housekeeping. 

Breakfast had lots of choice, cooked breakfast, cereal, fruit, pastries, cheese, ham, smoothies, etc

Checked out early but able to store bags so able to explore the city for the day as had an evening flight. 

Will return. 

Only feedback was the email received for quick check in and quick checkout, the link didn’t work - not an issue for me as both were quick.

231,Amazig stay,The staff is very friendly and the Breakfast is good too. The Hotel is near the City center (15 Minutes walk) and there are bus and train stations near the Hotel. The room could be a Bit bigger for a family ( three adults) but the bathroom is defnitly big enough.                                              ,5,2019,10,12
231,Excellent service,Simon on the bar was fantastic with his service he was friendly and chatty and made us feel very welcome the bar had a lovely atmosphere. The hotel is very central in the city and walkin distance from everything,5,2019,10,12
231,Business trip to Dublin,"Stayed here for 3 nights this week for a business trip. Check in was friendly and efficient. Large room with a double bed, sofa, smallish tv, desk and iron / board. No safe in the room (but available at reception) and no fridge. Had UK tv channels (terrestrial only). 10 mins walk to Temple Bar and close to shopping, bars etc on the North Side.
Good business hotel but quite expensive",4,2019,10,11
231,Hotel close to everthing a tourist needs,"Spent 3 nights here. Staff is super friendly and helpful.  Room was clean.Quite quiet overnight,  The beds were most comfortable.  Breakfast had something for everyone. There is a bar as well as a dining room.  We enjoyed our breakfasts!",5,2019,10,10
231,Fantastic Hotel & Bar,"What a great little hotel. We stayed here for my girlfriend’s birthday weekend. Neither of us had been to Dublin before and wasn’t sure what to expect. The hotel was extremely clean and tidy. We had a normal double room which had everything we needed in there as we only intended to sleep in it and be out most of the time. The bed was lovely and comfortable and was just the right size for two adults. 
However, we found the bar which was located on the 2nd floor and was amazing. We found ourselves in there on both nights as I’m slightly too old for the Temple Bar nightlife. They catered for all tastes when it came to drinks, cocktails, ales, lager and even made me my own cocktail as it wasn’t on the menu. That was a great touch. Thank you Daria!!! 
Breakfast was served in the restaurant and was a buffet breakfast which was very nice.
The only slight downside was the bar food. I had a chicken and bacon club sandwich which was rather difficult to eat as the bread wasn’t toasted and just fell apart as I ate it. My girlfriend had the chicken Caesar salad which again was a slight disappointment as the croutons were slightly soggy and had no crunch... This wasn’t enough to dampen our spirits or affect my review score. Brilliant little place and highly recommended. Thanks guys!!!

231,Great Stay!,"Although we only stayed one night, our group of six ladies were very pleased with this hotel.  The front desk staff was especially friendly and accommodating, the hotel was clean and comfortable.  Beds were great.",5,2019,10,09
231,Fantastic stay !! Brilliant hotel,"We stayed for two nights, hotel was brilliant very clean, all staff were fantastic very helpful! Food was lovely,  free wifi, free safe deposit boxes, free gym, great location, overall hotel was really good only downside was the 3pm check in when we arrived at 9am ",5,2019,10,09
231,Hard beds and pillow ,"It seems that the Irish like small beds...(a double is the norm) which are hard .. not soft at all.. and pillows that are like rocks.
Staff very nice and accommodating!
Good location.... close to Temple Bar area.",3,2019,10,09
231,Extremely comfortable short stay in Dublin,"Everything was excellent at this hotel which is superbly located in town.  The staff, the room, and the breakfast were all extremely good.   We were very happy to be there for a day, and would love to return to Dublin for a longer trip.  ",5,2019,10,07
231,HOTEL HELL - Do NOT stay AT THIS HOTEL!!!! You will be sorry!!!!,"I have never ever seen such complete disregard for customer service. This hotel is the worse hotel I have ever stayed in my life. I travel a lot and have complete empathy for hotel staff but this was ridiculous. These people ignored you completely or would out right lie to you about things. I called and asked for a room service menu and the front desk lady said, ""We don't have them because we are ""between"" having menus printed up."" later we were told by an Irish employee that was a lie and were actually handed a menu. We asked for a wake up call we NEVER got to be at airport on time for an early flight. We had called for a cab one night and he came a little early and asked the front desk to ring our room, she told him she did but she lied to him too....we didn't get the call. A friend dropped a package off at the front desk and we never got the either. I could go on and on with the total disregard of care and the out right lies these people will look in the face and tell you but I'm so sick of even thinking about this whole nightmare of a stay!!!! DO yourself a favor and pick a different hotel. There are plenty of lovely hotels in Dublin but this IS NOT one of them. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1,2019,10,07
231,Great Location - Great Stuff,"Great Location and Great Stuff, 
very friendly and so helpfull
Near center, great help and breakfast
Great View, strange nearby streats but... no problem at all
Very Quit room although looking at a main street

",4,2019,10,06
231,Unpleasant,"Dirty room, we had to ask for it to be cleaned. Sheets stained. Website repeatedly called rooms and bathrooms spacious. Spacious if you are a mouse. Desk staff unhelpful and occasionally rude. Good location",2,2019,10,04
231,Jurys Inn Parnell Street,"Loved this hotel! Friendly staff, clean quiet room and the location is perfect. Bus stops right around the corner, walking distance to lots of attractions. The rates were very reasonable as well. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2019,10,01
231,Weekend Trip,Weekend trip to Dublin with a friend. Very disappointed with the hotel. It was a marginal 3 star and certainly not 4 star quality. Rooms old and small and location not convenient. Definitely had to go to the city center for dining. Would not recommend ,3,2019,10,01
231,"Very Nice Hotel, Great Location","Excellent Hotel with good selection of breakfast choices and nice bar area.
Staff were courteous & friendly.  Great location for shopping on Henry Street!
Will definitely consider a return stay if prices are competitively lower.",5,2019,10,01
231,Not a 4 star Hotel,"We checked in for a 2 night stay and on the way to the room observed stained carpet. Upon entering our standard room we were disappointed by the size of the room. It would be by far the smallest of any 4 star we had stayed in either in Scotland or Ireland during the last 4 weeks of our travels. The bathroom was also on the small side. Being the last 2 nights of our UK stay with a 17 hour journey ahead of us, we checked out, losing our money. It wasn’t hard to find better, just around the corner was the Gresham which truly was 4 star from their beautiful reception area to the great room. It only cost us 50 Euro more over 2 nights including breakfast, which the Jury Inn didn’t. Do yourself a favour and look elsewhere.",2,2019,10,01
231,Oh well...," First, our reservation was canceled because of ‘no show “ even if I sent an email telling our flight was landing a 8:30 am. I didn’t want to beg for an early check in, but it my reservation ended up being canceled! And as an excuse, we were given breakfast vouchers, but nobody told us that it finished at 10.30 am. So we didn’t used it. And one night, we were locked outside in the rain for 5 minutes, because the go at the front desk was “busy”. Not impressed at all.",3,2019,09,30
231,"Real nice hotel, so so location.","Real nice hotel, clean, quiet very comfortable beds and an excellent breakfast buffet.  Although there is a fair number of pubs and restaurants nearby most of the attractions are further south near or south of the Liffey River.  Next time I would stay at the Jurys Inn Christ Church.  Staff were helpful, just after a long oversees flight they recommended ""The Church"" for lunch - btw great restaurant in a big old church - go there.  If you didn't bring face cloths with you ask for them when you check in....there are none in the rooms.",4,2019,09,30
231,Not bad at all,"As you'd expect from a Jurys Inn, this was not a bad experience.  It fell short of getting 5/5, but not by much.

One think I did find annoying is in the bathroom.  I am probably one of an increasingly rare breed that prefers a bath to a shower.  It's great therefore to have a bath in the bathroom.  However, if you're going to supply a bath you need to assume that people might actually want to use it and, therefore, make soap readily accessible to someone that is in the bath.  There were dispensers by the sink at up at a higher level for the shower, neither were reachable without inconvenient (and potentially dangerous) manoeuvring.  

It's a small thing, but when no bars of soap are supplied it becomes a real nuisance.",4,2019,09,30
231,Very accommodating,I travelled with my 83 year old Mom from the US to Dublin. We arrived extremely early and the hotel staff worked to provide us a room before the 3:00pm check in time.  The room was clean and comfortable. ,5,2019,09,29
231,Average hotel not a 4 star,"Efficient staff, area around hotel was dirty with bags of garbage around-obviously not hotel's issue. Very sterile room, didn't want to linger there. Bathroom exhaust fan not working or efficient. Stale cigarette smell in room, especially noticeable when steam from bathroom got into room. OK breakfast with standard offerings, nice breakfast area. Long, long corridors in this property, hotel larger than it looks. ",3,2019,09,25
231,Jurys Parnell St. Excellent!,"Thought would be another corporate style of hotel with standard staff etc etc.

The staff make your stay and from the check in to checkout, luggage storage before you can check in or leave, housekeeping and even need something printed off they do it and with a smile.

I travel a fair bit and was pleasantly surprised this hotel is great there is another Jury’s by the Cathedral don’t know if it’s the same in standard, but stay at Parnell St. good location off O’Connell but not noisy as we had a room over looking courtyard. Good facilities nearby and easy to get bus to and from airport.

",5,2019,09,24
231,Good location and easy access to transport links,"This hotel is located across the street from the Rotunda Hospital, and about 100m from O'Connell Street, so there's easy access via Aircoach from and to the airport. In addition, a new tram line ( Luas) now runs right in front of the hotel. One of the main shopping streets ( Henry Street) is a 5 minute walk away, as is the GPO.
 During my student days, I had lived a short walk from the hotel, so I knew the area well. In my opinion, the neighborhood might be described as being mildly seedy, but not, I think, dangerous.
 The rooms were dofortable, and breakfast was very good, as was the hotel bar",5,2019,09,24
231,"Lovely hotel, great staff"," We had a great stay at Jurys Inn. All the staff were so helpful. We were allowed to check in early. The rooms were clean and well appointed. The buffet breakfast was always good with lots of choice. The hotel is in an ideal location walkable to nearly all Dublin's attractions. ",5,2019,09,24
231,Great location,"We were in Dublin for a weekend break - the hotel was in a great location to get around the city. It was a short walk to O'Connell Street where you could pick up a bus, tram or taxi to get around. It was easy walking distance to the Temple Bar area where there are various visitor attractions and shopping opportunities. There is also a great selection of bars and restaurants in the area.",5,2019,09,24
231,"Comfortable sleep, good quality food","Enjoyed the breakfast, wish I had time to eat more! Had to go to the airport! Next time I’m back, will make the most of the buffet breakfast!
Enjoyed the lunch the day before which was Salmon Linguine it was better than one of the other jury’s Inn hotel I had been to, so a better chef indeed!",5,2019,09,23
231,Couples trip to Dublin,Hotel staff were very helpful and courteous.  We stayed for 4 nights and enjoyed our time there.  The room was a bit small for two people with medium sized suitcases however everything else was great.  Location was great!  We could walk everywhere we wanted to go within Dublin city centre.  ,5,2019,09,22
231,Great place,"Stayed here for 2 nights and will stay here again if we come back to Dublin. Staff were very good and friendly, location of hotel is good. Far enough away from temple bar area so its not too noisy but close enough so you can walk it. 
Highlight from the group was definitely the breakfast, a good variety of choice and the hot food was cooked well and plentiful. 
As for the room, nice and clean woth good beds, only let down was the shower (i prefer a really powerful shower) others in the group thought it was fine. ",5,2019,09,21
231,Well located but average quality hotel,"Jurys Inn is well located however I question the 4 star rating. The guest rooms would definitely need some improvements such as carpet replacement and also TV needs to be upgraded. The corridor carpet also needs to be replace in my opinion. The rooms though are very clean, spacious and comfortable. I enjoyed coffee machine in the room. ",3,2019,09,19
231,Dublin Experience,"I stayed at the Jurys Inn on Parnell Street.  Clean hotel, friendly staff and located in a quieter area of Dublin.  Shops, Hop on Hop off bus is close by and plenty of Pubs to enjoy.  I will stay here again when I return to Dublin in 2021.",5,2019,09,19
231,No Bacon,So I checked in Sep 17th 2019. Sep 18th Went for breakfast wanting eggs and bacon to find 2 hard fried eggs and no bacon. I asked staff where the bacon was and they said it had run out. As they started walking away I asked if anymore was coming and they said in about 10 or 15 minutes. Did not have time to wait so had beans black pudding and naff porridge instead. Very agitating that staff let food run out before thinking to replenish it! No apology wanted. I'll just tell my travel agent to never book my group in here again. They also put me and my colleague in handicap rooms. Not the nicest of rooms with old looking carpet and no bath.! TV is tiny 27 inch thing and about 5 meters from the bed.! Location is not family friendly after dark. Tons of addicts and lord knows what liquids on the pavements outside. View from my room was of dirty industrial roof and ally covered in pidgieon muck. Considering I'm the Tout Manager for the group I would have thought they could have dome a lot better. My advise is keep well away from this place,1,2019,09,18
231,Myself and my work mate poor nites stay in hotel,"1: room temp very hot and could get it resolved
2: window would close proper
3: noise from behind hotel was unbearable and went on through the nite was some bin disposable unit worked all nite
4: work started at 6am in the area digging and building no sleep at all
5: was told one price on phone told another on desk
6: myself and my work mate both got some sort of bites on our ankles and knees and I had a few on my arms 

I never ever complain about a hotel but this was a step to far for me ",3,2019,09,17
231,My review of jury’s hotel in Dublin,It was a very good hotel . The location was very good . The staff at the hotel were very friendly and the breakfast was excellent . I would recommend the hotel to anyone . The hotel room was very clean  with great facilities .,5,2019,09,16
231,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel in a really convenient location. Airport bus stops across O'Connell Street a five minute walk away and the stop is near for return. Really clean comfortable room, excellent breakfast. The staff at the hotel are so welcoming and nothing was too much trouble for them. They arranged a pack up as we had to be out early in the morning on one of our days. There is a luggage room available is you need to use it. I will definitely stay here again when I return to Dublin. ",5,2019,09,16
231,Mixed bag,"It’s clearly not a 5 star place but ideally located just minutes from the river and night life. The executive rooms are well spaced out with a massive bed. Very comfortable. Shower too was excellent. Really powerful so spot on.  

The real let down was the breakfast.  The sausages, bacon and eggs were woeful.  Cold, fatty and really unappetising. The kingfisher opposite is a far better bet.  The management really need to look at this as a decent breakfast should be a staple part of a city hotel break.",4,2019,09,15
231,"Comfy bed, poor breakfast ","I would give room 4 out of 5. Stayed in executive room and the bed was huge and very comfortable. Decent nights sleep. Good location. Mark down though as breakfast was poor- poor quality bacon, eggs, black pudding etc. ",3,2019,09,15
231,Avoid,"Arrived after a long drive from Cobh....reception staff not very welcoming,  different explanations from them regarding car parking, very confusing.   Instructions of how to navigate the car park written in the lift which you cannot access unless you have a room card.  Bedroom 423 seems like a quirky afterthought with one of the most incomfortanle beds, tv reception not good and the restaurant needs to train their staff, although to be fair the food was good.  Very bland, corporate hotel more suitable for a business person.  Would not recommend. ",1,2019,09,15
231,Great location,"Room was clean and comfortable although some guests were very noisy coming late into their rooms and making a racket (could be that we were located on the 2nd floor which is where the restaurant was located too).
",5,2019,09,14
231,Excellent location ,"My wife, baby and my self stayed at the Jurys Inn. It was our first trip to Dublin with our baby son. 
The staff were very helpful and a baby cot was provided and put up by staff. We flew into Dublin and arrived at about 9 am. We went to Jurys inn straight away and were able to store our luggage there before our room was ready. A life saver as then we didn’t need to lug our luggage around until 3pm the check in time. 
The rooms were clean and had a modern feel to them, the buffet breakfast was excellent and our baby ate for free. We would recommend and would stay again as it is ideally located for visiting the city. ",5,2019,09,14
231,We love Dublin,"Jury's Inn is perfectly located.  We walked to so many sites from there.   Pillows need help, the rooms are small but very clean.  I am not sure why there are no wash cloths.  But the perfect location will come into consideration next year when we return.   ",4,2019,09,14
231,Good overall hotel,"Hotel was in a good location.  Very clean, comfortable.  Staff was wonderful.  Bar was very nice to unwind after a long day of site seeing.  Beds very comfortable.  Bathroom size and shower/tub were perfect.  But fr the price, breakfast should have been included.",4,2019,09,14
231,Comfort and location,"We stayed at Jurys Inn at beginning of September before returning home to Canada.  We found accommodation comfortable and in such a great location.  We were close to shopping, transit, restaurants and all the attractions ‘downtown’.  We opted for included breakfast which had great variety and was excellent value.  While we didn’t eat in restaurant during day we did enjoy a drink in the bar.  The only negative was the strongly perfumed lobby which for a scent sensitive person was overbearing.",5,2019,09,14
231,Overall a pleasant stay.,"The staff were very accommodating, our stay included a large breakfast spread that allowed something for everyone. The building was located in the hub of the city, but I wasn’t disturbed by street noises at night. 
Was awaken by nearby doors slamming, but other than that the stay was pleasant. ",4,2019,09,13
231,Restaurant lets it down,"Checking in went well, a pleasant staff member explained all that was necessary to us. Location of Jurys Inn was near the malls and we had a tram pass so could get around easily if we had to go further. Some of the rooms up our hall way were still being serviced when we arrived so we asked the person on duty if we could have another luggage rack and he obliged. We also asked if we could have a top sheet to place on the bed as we knew the doona was going to be too heavy and warm. Again he obliged. As we were staying 5 nights, on the 4th day, perhaps a different staff member thought to give us a clean top sheet which was nice but it was a doona cover and just covered us both!
The restaurant did a huge variable breakfast, covering everything imaginable. Staff, especially Ella and a blonde Irish lady were an asset to the hotel with their attention to detail and friendliness. However we decided to dine in one night and ordered pizza. It had to be either a frozen pizza heated up or somebody from another country that does not make or eat pizzas. There were a few basil leaves and/or rocket leaves thrown on top which wilted from the lukewarm heat of the pizza. This was to be a night for amateur staff as before dinner we had ordered drinks at the bar. The girl did not know how to pour a Guinness and the young adult male filled an enormous glass with ice to pour soda water in for me. I said no, not that much ice, thank you, I just want a little bit. He tipped it out and then half filled it again with ice, again I had to say a third of that amount now please. I asked for a slice of lemon in it and another staff member, it may have been the Guinness pourer, picked up a lime and a lemon and asked which one was the lemon. We wondered how much training these people get?
The night before we left we invited our friends who had come for 2 days from London, to eat with us in the bar. They ordered nachos and I ordered a toasted sandwich and chips. The nachos were barely covered with a tablespoon of cheese. My sandwich was average but at least I had more nutrition than the others. Each evening we noted that like us at the restaurant, we saw only one table with guests. I am not surprised.
Our very early checkout the next day went smoothly and taxi promptly called and arrived for our trip to the airport.",4,2019,09,13
231,Lovely service,Everyone was very friendly and the breakfast was superb!  We felt taken care of and were treated well by the staff.  The location (on Parnell St) was close to everything we wanted to see and do and we enjoyed our stay! ,5,2019,09,12
231,"Great location, poor breakfast and rude awakening from builders","First the positive, hotel is well located just round corner from O'Connell street and close to good bars and restaurants and the HoHo bus stop.  The room was spacious, clean and generally comfortable although pillows were too hard for my taste which impacted my sleep and I had stiff neck in morning. 
The negatives, the breakfast was one of the worst we have experienced in a chain hotel.  Many items had run out all together, even at 8.30 including basics like yoghurt. Hot items were left to dry out under the heat lamps, croissants were small and dry, no pastries, fresh fruit selection was poor as were the cold meats and cheeses.  I ordered poached eggs on toast which took 20 minutes to arrive and then bizarrely were served with rocket and balsamic vinegar dressing.  There were plenty of tables so the restaurant wasn't busy, so I dread to think what it would have been like if there was a rush.
The other big issue was noise from the building site next door that we were not warned about.  It started at 7.30 in the morning, waking us up with loud drilling that made the whole room vibrate.  Our complaints on check out fell on deaf ears.",4,2019,09,12
231,Great Hotel!,"Great hotel, in a good good location, lovely friendly helpful staff! Clean tidy room and very comfortable!
Shame the stay didn’t include breakfast  instead of room only. Lovely quiet stop here, would recommend! ",5,2019,09,09
231,A chain hotel that works harder!,"From  the warm reception at the front desk, where we were offered thorough, helpful advice with directions on a map to a standard, but attractively and thoughtfully arranged room, and excellent buffet breakfast we were utterly blown away by a chain hotel striving and succeeding to offer first class service. We have since stayed at highly rated hotels which did not meet this standard for guests.",5,2019,09,09
231,Large group weekend stay,"The hotel is in a great location and easy walking distance to everything. Rooms were a good size and clean. Overall a good selection for a cooked breakfast. A small selection of healthier breakfast. 
All the staff were very friendly. We had no issues with checking in or out and they made things very easy with a group of 8. ",4,2019,09,09
231,Dining letdown,"Overall a nice hotel, reception staff wonderful, very attentive.  Avoid night porter.  Lots of choice at breakfast but lukewarm and tasteless. Would stay again, as good outweighed the bad, but would go out for breakfast next time. ",3,2019,09,07
231,Really nice place to stay in Dublin,"Good location, with transport opportunities to get you wherever you want to go.
Good restaurants in the vicinity. Good location, not very crowded and a good view.
Spacious room and excellent cleaning services. Morning paper included was a big plus for me.",5,2019,09,04
231,Great location ,"Stayed here for the All-Ireland GAA Final. We arrived early Sunday morning and was able to leave our bags in storage until later on as check in wasn’t until 3pm. Check in was swift. Staff were very helpful. The room was lovely and clean very spacious with all the usual bits and pieces you would need for a stay. I would recommend this hotel purely for location as it is located just off the top of O’Connell street, so it’s very very central for people visit Dublin as a tourist or even for shopping/night out. ",5,2019,09,03
231,Good quality hotel and well located ,"Staying here for 2 more days having been here since last Sunday.
Pleasant room. Security entry to lifts and room. Good buffet breakfast. Had drinks in the bar this evening and can recommend the baked breads and honeyed sherry chorizo from the Nibble or Share menu. Delicious.",4,2019,09,03
231,Enjoyable stay,We came for a wedding the hotel breakfast and restaurant meals were excellent.  Rooms very comfortable and very clean.  We had a great stay and would highly recommend this hotel.  Location was central for getting around dublin,5,2019,09,03

231,excellent place,It was a great place. The only thing i could complain about was breakfast. My children didn't have chocolate powder the first 4 or 5 days but there were things enough for them to eat. They even gave me olive oil. Thanks ,5,2019,09,02
231,Anniversary weekend in Dublin,"Had a great weekend, celebrating our 35th Wedding Anniversary, at Jurys Inn Dublin (Parnell Street). The hotel is in a great location for tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, shopping and transport. Its within walking distance of the Temple Bar area. The bed was very comfortable and the room was  modern and clean. Staff were very friendly, with a special shout out for receptionist Catrina who went the extra mile to make our stay so memorable.",5,2019,09,02
231,Recent stay in Dublin,"Very centrally located with quick access to public transport, sights in the city centre and shopping facilities. Very friendly and helpful staff. Good breakfast. Parking is a few minutes away. The direct neighbourhood is not everybodies preference.",4,2019,09,02
231,Last night off our holiday.,"We booked our room and I made a human mistake with the date, I didn’t get a email to say/ask why we didn’t turn up? We arrived and the guy on reception was lovely about it. We booked in (paying twice 😢) he gave us breakfast as compensation 👍",3,2019,09,02

breakfast excellent as were other meals.Staff at reception welcoming and available to book taxis.
within walking distance of Murrays bar and shops and malls/tourist information /bus stops",5,2019,09,01
231,Quick trip to Dublin,"Expensive hotel but.... relative to what is an expensive city to visit.  The check in was great as the woman behind the counter was friendly and very helpful.  The bed was super comfortable and the breakfast was pretty good.  Great location as it’s walking distance to everything, including the Guinness Brewery.",4,2019,09,01
231,Great Stay,Our arrival to Ireland was exhausting and we got in early.  Our room was ready before and we were allowed to check in early.  This helped us to acclimate from jet lag by resting so we could enjoy our trip. Not many hotels would allow you this privilege. They arranged for us to have a taxi when needed for our departure.  Check out was a breeze.  Just drop the key in the box and go.  Never had I have an easier time with needs (which were not much as they met our needs prior to us needing to ask) Only needed questions/ directions.  Great place to stay.   ,5,2019,08,31
231,Very good hotel 10 minute walk to Dublin city centre,"Stayed at the hotel overnight whilst in Dublin.  The discounted car parking is approximately 15 minute walk away which was not a great problem for ourselves.

The rooms were adequate however we took a multi socket plug which certainly helped ourselves with our child and all the electrical charging involved.

Breakfast was very good with a large cooked breakfast or if you prefer freshly cooked options.  You paid extra if you wanted pancakes which my son did and really enjoyed.

I used the gym at the hotel as running would have been too much being such a busy city.  The gym had a treadmill and a cross trainer however is small with only these items of equipment.

The hotel for its price and location is recommended.",4,2019,08,31
231,"Lovely hotel, wonderful staff!","We stayed at Jurys Inn Parnell Street for six days while attending an international conference.  The room was very comfortable and surprisingly quiet for the hotel's location on a busy street.  The beds were wonderful, housekeeping was thorough and prompt, and we genuinely enjoyed our stay.

While all the hotel staff we dealt with was superb, special thanks and recognition are due to Ana at the front desk, for her incredible insight and compassion.  We arrived at about 1:00 pm, two hours before check-in time, absolutely wiped out from a very rough overnight flight from the States.  I was afraid we'd have to hang out in the lobby for two hours, jet-lagged and exhausted, waiting to check in, but Ana was having none of that.  She took one look at us, said ""I am going to get you into a room right away,"" and found a room of the type we had reserved that was all made up and ready.  She even sent someone up to our room with mineral water and three packets of biscuits (cookies) as a welcome to Dublin!  Ana was truly our lifesaver, and Jurys Inn Parnell Street is very fortunate to have her compassion and superior customer service skills at the front desk.  ",5,2019,08,30
231,"Good location, friendly staff","This is a good, basic hotel with air conditioning. (Although, the air conditioning could not be turned down to a very cold temperature). It is north of the Liffey River (there is another Jury's Inn in Dublin south of the Liffey River). I booked it because reviews said it was a little quieter than the other one as well as a little cheaper. They worked with me because we stayed 5 nights, then took a one night break to go down to Kilkenny, then came back for one night. I could not book it that way online because there was a 3 night minimum, but because we were staying 5 nights they let me book the 1 night Sat night stay (but I had to call them to do it, and there is no US number so you have to call Ireland directly to do it).

The front desk staff is very friendly but gave me slightly bad information about the Sunday schedule for the Airlink bus to the airport (It does not start running on Sundays until 6:30 AM, so if you have a 7:30 AM flight as we did, it will not work for you). They told me it started running at 4:30 AM which I believe is the weekday schedule, but fortunately we checked out the schedule on the sign.

If you are doing bus tours out of Dublin, it is a good place to stay because it is close to the Gresham Hotel on O'Connell street where all the bus tours leave from. It is very close walking distance to O'Connell, which is the main street, and you can also easily walk to Temple Bar, Trinity College, etc. Some of our group even walked to the Guinness Storehouse, which is a little farther away.

We got a ""superior"" room which had a double bed and a single bed. The bathroom is a typical European hotel bathroom - i.e. small with very little counter space. As others have mentioned, the room had no USB connectors but I brought my plug adapter. Also in a pinch I believe you can use the TV's USB port as a USB charger.

The breakfast was not bad, the potatoes were very good, typical eggs, sausages, etc. My daughter noticed that the grilled tomatoes were not grilled enough for her taste, especially the day we ate at 6:30 AM to catch a bus tour. They seemed to have been placed under the broiler for only a few seconds. For some reason they have cut fruit and yogurt in one location and some watermelon slices and other fruit in a completely different location, so the first day I assumed that was all the fruit and never saw the cut fruit (no big deal for me). All the European hotels now seem to have coffee machines where you select a type and put your cup under it - usually they let you get a latte, cappucino, etc. but here there was only black coffee which was fine for me but others may expect more variety. Milk for coffee is on your table. Breakfast staff is friendly.

My only complaints are there was construction noise starting at about 5:30 AM (not the hotel's fault), and I was supposed to get a discount from getting a Jury Awards number, but because I had to change my original reservation by talking to them, my discount got lost, and the staff weren't familiar with the discount offer.  They did keep our bags for free during our one day trip offsite (we left a couple of bags with Jury's Inn when we took the day/night trip down to Kilkenny).

I would stay there again if I could get a good deal on the price.",4,2019,08,29
231,Jury’s Inn Dublin,"Review of recent experience as a guest of Jury’s Inn Parnell St Dublin. A reasonably costed hotel chain but for mature travellers somewhat challenging in the areas of car parking, off loading luggage and shower facilities. No bar fridge made storage of medicines difficult. ",3,2019,08,29
231,Good central location,This hotel is well located for weekend exploring Dublin. Rooms and breakfast are fine. Our only real problem was  in cancelling charges which had been made in error for breakfasts that had been paid in cash.,4,2019,08,29
231,Short Break,"nothing to really say was overall a good service and the staff were helpful and friendly and the hotel was close to city centre, there is no parking at the hotel but this can be arranged through the hotel were they have discount at a public carpark for 15 euro's per day",5,2019,08,29
231,Very charming hotel.,"Location is great, easy to get to from the port or an airport, right in downtown, close to all the sightseeing,  pubs and shops, restaurants. Check in is 3pm which is inconvenience,  but reception takes care off your luggage,  so you can roam around the city if you come early. good facilities, rooms are spacious and clean.",4,2019,08,29

Hotel offers a very lush breakfast with a pleasant atmosphere.
The staff is very helpful and respond to the requests.",5,2019,08,28
231,our stay in jurys inn Parnell Street,"very helpful and friendly staff. Just a few minutes to Bachelors Walk.
Rooms have no good standards.In my opinion no 4 stars worth. The bathroom has a smell of urine and the room is worn. The windows was not usable",3,2019,08,28
231,Pleasant stay within Dublin City centre.,"We had a pleasant stay within Dublin City's busy shopping and Tourist area .  
The hotel was clean, the food was good and the staff were cheery and obliging. 
The only down side was the price of the hotel.  E269 per night which is steep for any hotel under 5* but I had a gift voucher which nearly covered the cost.
I recommend this hotel and will probably stay there again in the future, depending if the price is right.  ",5,2019,08,28
231,Staff and Bar were awesome!,I booked the hotel room but unfortunately missed my flight due to weather. They allowed my cousin to check in that night (instead of me) and they gave me a key at 6am the next day when I finally arrived. Also the Irish coffees at the bar were some of the best we had in Ireland (and we had a lot haha). Highly recommend!,5,2019,08,28
231,Could be better,"We had travelled 25hours to find out our room would not be ready until 12 midday. It was 9am so we were fine with that and had a look around Dublin. When we got back at midday we were made tovwait another hour as there had been a mix up with our rooms even after we had been upgraded to executive room of which we paid extra. Room was a bit small and outdated. Breakfast could have had more variety. Besides this, location was good and bed was comfy and serviced daily. ",3,2019,08,28
231,We stay here when we go for hubby's staff parties near O' Connell street.,Perfect for our 1 night stays when going out in the city. We use this hotel when the hubby has work parties as we live in the country. Usually lucky to get a good sale price. Not sure we'd stay if we had to pay the €170 they were looking for the week before we booked. But that's based only needing a place to sleep. We haven't really used the other services so maybe others would see more value. ,4,2019,08,27
231,Amazing stay!,"It was a very nice hotel and could not fault the cleanliness or the way staff treat you at all! Location was good for bars etc however Temple Bar etc was at the other side but good if you don’t mind a walk and meaning it’s a lot lot quieter on a night! The only downfall was the room service as we had to pick it up from the bar defeating the point of “room” service, and the phone in our room did not work so when we rang back to see if it was ready it had been sitting for a while! However the rest of the stay was great, we even got chocolates and Prosecco with it being my birthday trip =) ",5,2019,08,27
231,Nice property for the money,Wonderful. Centrally located. Easy to get around the property. Quiet.   Food in the an was great. Staff friendly.  Dennis at the front desk is particularly friendly and helpful. Mothers should bring their single daughters to meet him.,5,2019,08,27
231,Our home away from home,"This was our third time staying at Jury’s Inn Dublin Parnell Street in five years.

231,Good value hotel,"This hotel is really nice and in a good location , the rooms are good with great en suite and comfortable beds. The windows can be opened wide which is a bonus, once closed the rooms are very quiet.
The buffet breakfast is good.
The only minor complaint is that there is only one chair.",4,2019,08,26
231,4 nights in Dublin ,"Courteous and efficient staff, decent room, great location. It’s just doing the corner from upper O’Connell Street. We did a couple of coach tours which happened to have a pick up point at the Gresham Hotel which was less than 5 mins around the corner on upper O’Connell so the location was great. There’s a Tesco across the road which is perfect for fruit, snacks etc. ",5,2019,08,24
231,"10 Days at Jurys Inn, Parnell Street, Dublin","We had stayed at the Jurys Inn in Cork on a previous visit and found it excellent, so on our trip to Dublin  we decided to try another 'branch'.  Standards were just as high, staff were very friendly and breakfast excellent.  Our only complaint was about the electronic keys, which failed on a regular basis and needed almost daily resetting or recharging. It was very frustrating to reach the 4th floor and then have to descend in order to have the keys sorted out.. again!  It seems there was a particular knack to using them, so perhaps they should be issued with instructions! Also there was only one chair in a room for 3 people.",5,2019,08,24
231,Good!,"Jurys Inn is a safe brand.  There are more frills than a Premier Inn, but not many.  Still no bathroom toiletries.  However, the staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were spotless, the breakfast was great, we had a good night's sleep, and location not too bad either.",4,2019,08,24
231,Excellent hotel!,We had a wonderful time in this hotel  the rooms are clean and new and spacious. The breakfast has a variety of food and the staff is lovely.

231,Great stay with the family,"No issues at all. Room was spacious and clean. There was air conditioning and the beds were comfy.
Good location. Grocery store across the street and tons of shops and restaurants nearby.
Nice lobby, super friendly staff.",5,2019,08,21
231,Review,"Good sized room, which was very clean and comfortable.  I think the location was very convenient as we were within walking distance to the city centre. The staff were friendly and welcoming. I thought this hotel was very  good value for money and I would stay here again.  ",4,2019,08,21
231,If you drive a car - don’t think of staying here.,"If you drive a car - don’t think of staying here.

There is nowhere  to pull up and unload, let alone park for 10 minutes. When you ask reception where to unload they react as if they have never heard of traveling by car, let alone having luggage ! 

The only solution is to go around the block via a maze of one way streets and approach the hotel again until a taxi slips out of the taxi zone and jump in and dodge the police patrol. That process can take 20 mins/circuit. 

The very thought of a porter or luggage trolley again seems foreign to the staff (sigh).
 I now understand that this is Dublin! But I still think a little help from reception or a porter would go a long way. 

Finally we get to a small room - with queen bed :=) but only 1 chair. 

After a stressful checkin, room service is the thing - but no ! Because we took up the emailed option to checkin by email “for a quick and easy checkin” - we need to return to reception to again authorise the credit card. So much for an easy checkin !
DO NOT PRE-checkin. 

There is no in-room safe and no USB points. Room is ok. Food ok. 
Call for a porter? - don’t bother, I can take the bags down from 5th floor and return before they even answer the phone. 
3 star hotel with serious glitches in customer service. 

Best tip - Kingfisher restaurant (directly across the road) is a great eating spot for both breakfast & dinner. 

If there is a next time, I will look for an alternative.

231,Nice hotel in a very good location,"Great location - close to Temple Bar area but not in the middle of Temple Bar area, so it is quieter and not too crowded. Walking distance to most tourist sites, shopping areas, restaurants and bars. There were three big groceries stores nearby, and also close to the bus stop where we can take the hop on-and-hop off bus and airport shuttle. The room is clean and comfortable; and you can get a nice full Irish breakfast from the breakfast buffet. We probably paid premium price as we were there on a weekend of a peak season, but it was all worth it.",4,2019,08,19
231,Comfiest hotel in Dublin,Great location and amenities provided! Although I think the cleanliness can be better; some spots needed a little more scrubbing before giving the room over to a new customer. The location is perfectly located at the city center with a quick walk to henry street and the luas stations on O'Connell street and the hotel has an amazing bar and restaurant. ,5,2019,08,17
231,"Great location, friendly staff.","This hotel is in a great location, and its clean and organized, with a friendly staff. Very busy now, though, so its possible to feel processed. Can't say enough good things about the lovely Liz at the breakfast. No direct hook up for charging, though, and you have to buy a conversion plug for 5 euros out of a machine if you need to do so. There is a conversion built in for the shave.",4,2019,08,17
231,Beautiful Place to Stay,"Jurys Inn was clean, comfortable and centrally located.  The breakfast and bedding were great.  Staff were very helpful.  The security for the elevators and floors were appreciated.  We'd definitely stay here again.",5,2019,08,16
231,Great central Dublin hotel,"Our welcome on checking in was friendly and efficient. The woman at the front desk helped us get our bearings and find a nearby parking garage. The room we had faced the courtyard, and was very quiet, considering the hotel’s location on a busy street. The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom well-appointed. Greatest strengths were the staff and the location. Only drawback was no onsite parking. We would definitely stay here on our next visit.",5,2019,08,15
231,Beige but mostly comfortable ,"A hotel that provides clean warm spacious digs
Nothing fancy
Nothing really wrong
I had zero view and was on a low level near skips that were collected and heard at 530am
Sigh
Sound proofing not the best with outside and neighbor nose
At least for me
WiFi and water pressure very good
Near lots of eats and theatre 
Breakfast buffet great with a veggo section
Pastries lackluster

231,Jury Inn Dublin Parnell Street,"Ok hotel, not sure about the understanding of some of the front counter staff when we tried to explain a problem with a neighbouring guest. Comfortable stay other than that one issue. Would stay again.",5,2019,08,14
231,Dublin night life,"If you want to be where the night life is in Dublin , stay at the Jury Inn. Next door to the Hard Rock Cafe and several Taverns within a short distance. The drawback is the noise at night. It was hectic until early morning. The alley next to the hotel echoes the noises. Ask for a quiet room. Everything else was great. Good staff.",4,2019,08,14
231,personal travel - great hotel room,our hotel room was just outstanding and the customer service was excellent. The only thing I would want would be for better TV channels but that's just me. Would stay there again it was a great location.,5,2019,08,14
231,nice and central,"room was large and spacious bath/shower clen and comfortable,walk round corner to main shopping bit further down road to bars resturants,good breakfast choice did not stay or evening meal so cannot comment but suspect should be good.",4,2019,08,14

231,"Very convenient, very helpful staff","Excellent central location. Very helpful staff. Room was clean and well equipt. 
Lovely meal in the bar in the evening, with a good atmosphere. 

Only down side was the buffet type breakfast. We went in in the last half hour and the hot items were no longer hot.
Convenient car park just a short walk away with the price discounted to €15 for 24 hours by the hotel. 
",5,2019,08,14
231,Great stay,"We loved our stay at jury’s inn. Quiet, great location, loads of fast food, restaurants and grocery stores with in steps. We loved having a kettle in the room and the water and ice dispensers by the elevator on each level. ",5,2019,08,13
231,Great hotel in the heart of Dublin,"The hotel is in the heart of Dublin, and within easy walking distance of a large number of sites of historical or aesthetic interest. Breakfast was included, and was excellent, and convenient for starting the day and moving on to the sights of Dublin. The staff was friendly and helpful. The car park facility was a short 7 minute walk, easily done by myself and my daughter with all of our luggage (one large rolling bag and one duffel each) . The best thing I can say about the hotel is that I will try to stay there again when I return to Dublin.",5,2019,08,12
231,"Jurys Inn Parnell, great location","True city center. From Guinness Storehouse to Trinity University, all walking distance. Restaurants, pubs, and shops were all a few steps from the hotel. The staff were all helpful and accommodating to our requests. Housekeeping was really on their A game.",5,2019,08,12
231,Girls trip!!,"Very pleased with hotel.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Hotel was clean and room was spacious. Food in the resturant was great.  Would differently stay here again. Location to local interest, most within walking distant.",5,2019,08,12
231,Great stay,"Clean, well looked after property and extremely efficient staff. 
Comfy room. 
Central, however not noisy.
A couple of mins away from tram stop.
Sky Sports in the bar was a bonus.
Tasty breakfast.
Thanks everyone!",5,2019,08,12
231,Another great stay,Another great stay. Great hotel for exploring the city. Very good beds and an excellent breakfast to set you up for the day ahead. Staff are all very friendly. Stayed with my mum and 2 boys. Will be back for our next trip.,5,2019,08,12
231,Comfy bed and nice staff,"I spent a night here for a work conference a few months ago and it was a good trip. Nice bed, good service from the hotel staff and the room was decent also. The bathroom was clean and the shower had good water pressure too.",4,2019,08,11
231,"Wonderful staff, great location!","We arrived close to midnight, rather distraught after the airline lost our luggage. Throughout that first day the staff was friendly, sympathetic and helpful. Helped us through the day with practical advice , even placing calls for us, until the luggage arrived. Always with a smile and a kind word. I would mention them by name, but I'm afraid of forgetting someone so I'll just say thanks to the entire staff!
The hotel itself is not fancy, but clean and cozy,  the location is ideal for anyone wishing to explore Dublin.",5,2019,08,11
231,A motel on several floors,"Regardless of other opinions, lets be blunt, this is a budget hotel and is no better than a motel in the sky - although it charges premium rates.  

So lets start at the beginning.  A pleasant lady checked us in after a full day of travel back to Dublin. She confirmed we had twin beds which we had reserved.  We ""hiked"" to our room - the the hotel is a square with a cement quadrangle in the centre - so a VERY long walk given that the elevators are only on one side of the square.  Of course, no twin beds greeted us.  It took almost 30 minutes before anyone finally answered our call to the front desk. We were then told to come back to the front desk and pick up another key.  As if.  The front desk was reminded of a little thing called customer service and her error.  A new key to a room across the hall was finally walked up to us. Not a good start for the Jurys Inn Parnell

Here's our take on the place:  It felt like a ""barracks"" or institutional dorm. The halls are rather grey and it takes forever to walk to your room (remember that after you have toured Dublin all day).  The rooms are small.  Each floor is a square with rooms on both sides of the hall, so if you are on the inside (quadrangle side) all your see is wall and the window of other rooms (that's where my ""barracks"" comment comes in) - absolutely no view.  There is no safe.  Soap/shampoo only comes out of a wall pump.  There is no bottled water - you can buy this from a machine for a 1.5 Euro BUT it only uses credit cards, no cash (as if you're going to use your foreign credit card for a 1.5 Euro purchase!).  The neighbourhood is noisy, a bit grungy and very touristy (its just off O'Connell).  Finally, you should note that there is a substantial walk from this hotel if you want to see most of the major sights of Dublin which are on the other side of the Liffey River. 

Some reviewers lavished praise on the Jurys Inn Parnell's breakfast.  I guess some people are easily pleased.  It was absolutely average, nothing special, again in an institutional style eating hall.  

To me, the Jurys Inn Parnell is a hotel for travelling salesmen or large tourist groups.  Only basic services and amenities are provided.  Each major city has them. I just wish that I had booked my last day in Dublin in a better quality hotel than the Jurys Inn Parnell - and likely for less money.",2,2019,08,08
231,Great Location,"Tye hotel is just on the spearhead of the city center. Every shop, restaurant, and pub is just walking distance. Even some of the tourist places can be visited by walking, especially the Guiness Storehouse. A convenient supermarket is also just across the street.",5,2019,08,08
231,Great location,Great hotel in a great location... rooms amazing! Staff very helpful... nothing was a bother.... highly recommend this hotel! Will be back for sure! Dublin is an amazing city...Guinness Storehouse highly recommend as it boat trip up the liffy! ,5,2019,08,07
231,"clean, classy, convenient","Great hotel, wonderful breakfast buffet, close to major attractions, most within walking distance.  The second floor bar is comfortable.  The hotel is close to train and bus connections.  Cabs are easily available on the Parnell Street.",5,2019,08,07
231,EXCELENT HOTEL!,Services and rooms of excelent quality. Complete breakfast with a lot of options. I use to stay on the hotel for business and they always treated me super nicely. they are polite and correct. The location is also on the most important points. Is on the center! ,5,2019,08,07
231,jurys inn dublin,Very nice hotel. located within easy walking distance of public transportation from airport. Easy walking distance to oconnell street where you can get the hop on hop off buses and lots of shopping and restaurants.,5,2019,08,07
231,"Not horrible for Dublin, Dublin is boring, AC is horrible, bartender smelled like body odor.","The bartender stunk so badly that I could not eat my food in their restaurant. The body odor was unbearable. The decor of the outside reminds me of a prison when you look out your  room window.  Their AIR CONDITION WAS A JOKE. Good thing it was a cool night and I could open the window, it was cooler outside (72degrees F) than the air-conditioning could reach. Dublin is a bore fest. ",1,2019,08,06
231,"Great hotel, fantastic location","The location was fantastic. Just off O'Connell St (the main drag) and on Parnell St you are close to everything. The busses and trams are just steps away and you are in easy reach of the Hop On Hop Off tour busses and cabs stop right in front of the hotel. It was a very modern hotel, with great rooms and service. My wife and I loved breakfast (included in our package) in the restaurant and thoroughly enjoyed the bar when we didn't want to go out.",5,2019,08,06
231,pleasant hotel,"A nice hotel, excellent breakfasts, roomy and comfortable rooms and a reasonable location for first visit to Dublin.
Beds and pillows fabulous. Very quiet and easy to get to. Surprise, however, that such a large hotel did not lend umbrellas! ",5,2019,08,05
231,Family visit to Dublin,Invest in training your staff to deliver a better service to the guests.  Reception staff is not oriented to help guests and I was told that they could not make reservations for guests because the Hotel management had blocked certain sites.  A Hotel is supposed to provide assistance in making reservations for sightseeing tours and other requested tourist attractions.  For the first time I stayed in a Hotel that made sure no assistance could be provided. CHEAP! ,4,2019,08,02
231,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed here for three nights. The hotel is situated in a great location, and is only a short walk away from the main attractions. The staff were helpful, friendly and made us feel very welcome. A nice touch from the staff by leaving clean towels in a laundry bag outside our door, as we left our do not disturb sign on. The room was spacious and we slept very well, due to the bed being comfortable. We certainly will be coming back to stay when we next visit Dublin. ",5,2019,07,31
231,COMFORTABLE CLEAN BEDS BUT OTHERWISE NOT WONDERFUL ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT,"Have stayed at Jury's in Cork before so expected this Jury's to be as good but sadly it was not, With much difficulty, & many hours later, I tried to add an additional night to the start of our original booking. Very pleasant check-in young man confirmed that stay was joined up but on return to room mid afternoon on the 2nd day our room key was blocked so down in the lift again to get key re-activated. Lift up again to find room not cleaned. Left a Do Not Disturb sign out & to be fair the housekeeping did leave some clean towels outside & a note to offer cleaning later on should we want it. The overflow exit outlet in washbasin was very dirty so left a note. It was cleaned & a box of chocs & drinks voucher left as compensation & this was much appreciated.  Then reception staff were not able to print out our boarding passes as the IT system seemed to be either blocked or very, very slow. Had to walk a mile down the road to find a print shop to perform this procedure. The bathroom in Room 327 was adequate ....good toiletries & useful tissue dispenser but rather feeble shower. Shower curtains are not good these days....reinforced glass doors are better. The hotel bedroom very heavy fire doors belonged in a youth hostel & the corridor carpets were quiet shabby. I feel rather mean complaining about little things as they are not really important in the scheme of life ....but....standards still have to be maintained & I feel that this Jury's needs much improvement.",3,2019,07,31
231,"Great location, decent accommodations, not perfect","Plusses - great location, helpful, friendly staff, air conditioning (!), decent breakfast, great curtains keeping light out, good security, clean room

Minuses - weird and lousy shower fixture (hard to work), lousy shower curtain, bed barely large enough to fit two people, toilet paper underneath soap by sink (getting paper wet every time), unbelievably long walk to room once off elevator 

They let us check in early which was great.  We had breakfast there every day and while it was not outstanding, it was good enough with a healthy selection of options and a pleasant dining space.

All in all I was glad we stayed there and the terrible European heatwave of 2019 made us very grateful for the air conditining.",4,2019,07,30
231,Basic city hotel,"Over priced city hotel, positive is that it is convenient for local attractions and they offer a parking discount at a car park a short walk away, our room had a hideous small window so hot and stuffy.",3,2019,07,30
231,"Nice clean hotel with good breakfast, and great staff","We stayed here for four nights. Hotel is well situated in a quiet area compared to the busy downtown.  Short walk to major attractions. The staff was very helpful with requests, breakfast was very good, and rooms quiet and clean.  ",4,2019,07,30
231,Great service,Everything was great.  Friendly service and a great location.  Only drawback was parking off-site and no spot to drop luggage before having to find parking. Liked that the bar was open late.  Breakfast was too expensive for what you get.,5,2019,07,29
231,Great location and room,"We stayed at the Jurys Inn during our city break to Dublin, it is in a great location 5 mins walk from the bus stop for the 747 Airport Express which takes about 35 mins to get to the airport. It is also 10 mins walk from Temple Bar and 30 mins from the Guinness Storehouse. Check in was very easy and the room was extremely comfortable and a great size, it is the perfect place to plan your Dublin escape around.",5,2019,07,29
231,Perfect location,"Perfect location for us, just off the main O'Connell Street so quiet at night. 10 min walk to bus tour departure points. Tesco store 2 mins walk. Clean rooms, friendly staff. Express check-in and check-out so no queuing. ",4,2019,07,29
231,"Great hotel, Great location","We booked this hotel due to its location just off the main road in Dublin city.

Upon arrival we were provided with a warm welcome and given the key to our rooms. The staff here are very friendly. 

The rooms were spacious and had lovely bathrooms and very comfortable beds. The rooms were cleaned every day.

Would stay here again.",5,2019,07,29
231,Nice hotel very clean,The hotel is centrally located and all staff encountered were very friendly the breakfast was delicious and the rooms were very clean and when requested we received more amenities for tea and coffee making within minutes,4,2019,07,28
231,Convienetly located to most Dublin sites,"My Husband and I stayed at Jury's Inn Parnell street 7/19-7/22 and found it very comfortable, quiet and conveniently located to O'Connnell Street and most Dublin attractions. The breakfast was very good, front desk staff friendly and we were 5 min walk to Murray's, a nice restaurant on O'Connell St. with free Irish singing and dancing along with an outdoor biergarten out back.  The Jury's is also a short walk to the pick up spots for bus tours to heading to the Cliffs of Moher and Belfast. Shopping on Moore and Henry street are  just around the corner and it is an easy walk down to the river Liffey. We were very happy with our stay on the north side of the river and would stay again when back in Dublin.",4,2019,07,27
231,Jury's Inn was awesome! ,"Definitely a great stay! First off the lobby of the inn smells amazing! Our room was very clean and the customer service at the front desk was very helpful in finding us a bus to get to our next destination. The location was also very nice in that it was in the middle of the bustling city of Dublin, and everything was within walking distance. Not to mention they provide an excellent full course breakfast buffet for guests staying in the hotel. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking to visit Dublin, Ireland. ",5,2019,07,26
231,"Very nice,centrally located hotel.","Location is ideal,just round the corner from the city centre.Tesco across a road as well as a fabulous eating place called Kingfisher [best fish and chips in the world!].You get free bottles of water and cookies in your room every day.Breakfast is good.Room can be a bit noisy-you can hear people in the other rooms,banging  doors esp in the morning.The bar is nice and cosy.Air conditioning in the room in this hot weather very effective.Problems with the room toilet were quickly sorted out.Staff are very friendly.Slight disadvantage that toilets are located on the 2nd floor next to the restaurant instead of near the reception on the ground floor.
No hesitation in recommending this hotel.",5,2019,07,25
231,Comfortable and clean - good for a short stay,"The check in could have been more professional but help with using the safety deposit boxes and our check out was with helpful and attentive staff. The rooms were clean and surprisingly quiet, considering they faced a busy road. The helpful housekeeping department immediately brought a choice of pillows after my first night's sleep with an uncomfortable one. I recommend that families specifically request for rooms to be next to each other, even when booking months in advance. ",4,2019,07,24
231,Vacation,The staff was very accommodating and friendly. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome and assisted us each time we asked. The location was awesome— centrally located and within  walking distance. Would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2019,07,23
231,Visit Ireland,"We are from England I feel we sometimes got a cold reception from the Local Irish people but the Polish people were very polite and professional, Brexit was a touchy subject but still we were visitors and I feel everything around was overpriced",4,2019,07,23
231,Great place to stay,"Great place to stay in a great part of town easy to get to shops, buses, restaurants, and has room service also  have stayed here twice and both times had no problem with anything also  has a nice restaurant inside ",5,2019,07,22
231,Wonderful location!,"Everything about the Jury's Inn (Parnell St) was great! They accommodated our requests (top sheet for the bed) and helped us book events, suggested places to go, arranged for taxis when requested and were overall lovely to deal with. The room was small but very clean. AC worked wonderfully and lots of pressure in the shower.",5,2019,07,22
231,My review,"Not great. Way too expensive for what it was, and the experience was not set off to a great start due to me having to pay a second time for the room since it wasn't logged in the system that I had paid. It would be one thing if the front desk woman tried to help, but she didn't do anything except repeat the same frustrating thing over and over again. Room was devoid of basic amenities and toiletries. Bed was comfy at least and hotel was decently quiet.",2,2019,07,22
231,Not a bad first impression,"Not sure if this is entirely your fault, but you should do something about those access cards. I've traveled with my family and at some point, while we were trying to use the elevator, only one card was functional out of three which was given to us. 
I'll definitely return one day to check if its fixed :)
",4,2019,07,22
231,Very nice urban hotel in Dublin,"This is your hotel if you are looking for a urban style, affordable prices and good quality. The location is closed to the center of the city. You get very good service, friendly staff and good accommodations.",5,2019,07,20
231,Nice hotel in Dublin with a great location,"We stayed here for fours nights in June. The room had ample space and was clean. Our toilet had an issue (running) and although they sent someone up the first night to fix it, he was unable to and they kept promising to fix it but it was never fixed. Luckily it did not affect our good nights sleep. We had day trips each day so we really only used the hotel to crash in and that worked great. The front desk staff were really friendly and helpful. The breakfast bar was ample and everything was hot. We would recommend this hotel.",4,2019,07,19
231,Old and tired,"The location was great but it is old and tired 
The reception staff were very pleasant and helpful 
it was a safe hotel with out the room swipe we could not go up in the lift ..
The service and food at breakfast were both great ",4,2019,07,19
231,Stay here- it is the best.,"Great staff great location provided access to great fun and discovery in Dublin. They give good advice on attractions and things to do in the countryside, provided reasonable parking accommodations through a third-party garage which ended up being the cheapest we experienced in Europe. Would not hesitate to book here again if I'm fortunate enough to get to go back to Dublin. PS4 Pub crawling start with the interactive Scottish Folk Music Experience in the temple bar. Lots of fun if you enjoy having fun?",5,2019,07,18
231,Perfect for city centre Dublin,"Excellent service in excellent hotel by excellent staff!
Well worth every penny.....Front of house staff were particularly efficient and helpful with all my questions .
Just couldn’t believe how close we were to absolutely everything we’d planned to do and more.
We’ve decided to come back here every year to meet up despite the fact my daughters will likely be living in different parts of the globe!
WELL DONE JURYS!
",5,2019,07,18
231,Jurys Inn and the verdict is - book this hotel.,"Jurys Inn is very conveniently located in downtown Dublin. A short walk leads you to shopping, restaurants, bars, souvenir shops, and more. The evening entertainment in Murray's Pub (1 1/2 blocks from the hotel) is not to be missed. The food is good as well as the service but the band the dancers were great.",5,2019,07,17
231,A doorman would be nice.,A doorman to assist with baggage would be nice. The staff was excellent and responded to our request for additional bedding with a great deal of respect and courtesy. The morning breakfast would be better if waffles were available.,5,2019,07,17
231,My stay at Jury's,"Not a pleasant experience, as it started off badly when the guy was not even going to give me a room even though I showed him that I had paid. Then given a dark dreary room with no day light. Staff where of a poor standard, and they appeared to not care whether you where please or not.",2,2019,07,17
231,VERY GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY,"Spent 3 nights at Jurys Inn in Parnell St. on a business trip. Rooms are large, clean and pleasant. Breakfast is excellent. Location and service - great as well. I was very pleased and definitely  recommend. ",5,2019,07,16
231,Great Location!,"Stayed 3 nights prior to a family member’s wedding in Straffan. Jury’s Inn rates a 4 for location, which offset a general lack of cleaning and maintenance, so I gave it a 3 overall. It was a few blocks from where a dozen other friends and family -also from the US - were staying, and is a great location for visiting all the wonderful central Dublin attractions. It’s around the corner from O’Connell St and a 10 minute walk to the O’Connell St Bridge. Trinity College and St Stephens Green are only a few more blocks from the bridge. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. However, the hotel is a a bit worn out- hallway carpets need a good cleaning or replacement.  And periodically a sour odor emanated from the bathroom sink. This may be a Dublin problem overall- but a definite negative in a hotel!  The duvet cover seemed a bit soiled on top- and there was no top sheet, just the duvet- so had it been laundered between guests?   I might stay again given the location, but management should really pay more attention to cleaning and maintenance. ",3,2019,07,16
231,Top hotel,"We were looked after very well by all members of staff. The room was great and we slept well.
Breakfast was a self serve but plenty of things on offer and staff around if you wanted anything freshly cooked.
check out was 12.00 so rushing so we will definitely return. ",5,2019,07,16
231,Lovely Hotel in a Good Location,Had a great stay in Dublin in a convenient location away from the noise and crowds across the river but close enough to enjoy it at our discretion.  Our only complaint was the long corridors.  Our room was located very far from the elevators.  The young man at the desk offered to move us to a room closer to the elevators but we declined his offer.  If we were staying longer we would have moved.  Overall the staff was friendly and helpful and the breakfast was excellent.  We would definitely stay again.,5,2019,07,15
231,Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street -Great location !,"This hotel was at a great location to get around Dublin.  The rooms were clean and renovated with A/C.  It was a great place to have for a family vacation and near the Hop-on-Hop off buses, and tour operators.",5,2019,07,15
231,Comfortable base to see Dublin,"Jurys Inn is a very comfortable place, clear and with a kind and helpful staff. It is placed near the city centre that you can reach by a short and relaxing walk. Few meters away there is the bus stop to reach the airport. Very good accomodation for families.",5,2019,07,15
231,Great Location,"This hotel is next to one of the main streets in Dublin, it is closed to bars, restaurants, transportation, shops...
It also had the best breakfast I had in any of the 6 hotels I stayed around Ireland during my trip",4,2019,07,15
231,Great location," This is a very comfortable hotel. This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel and found it very convenient. The location is excellent. Just minutes from O’Connell Street and walking distance to most of the Dublin attraction.",4,2019,07,14
231,Standard chain hotel,Good location - only a few minutes walk from the airport shuttle bus and super easy to get to the city centre/croke park by foot. Friendly staff and a good breakfast. Bar prices were very reasonable. On our first morning housekeeping tried to enter at about 8:30 which we felt was very early. A good stay and would recommend,3,2019,07,12
231,Stay in Dublin,"I will come back next week, actually. I was very satisfied with the cleanliness. Great work for housekeeping they all deserve a raise. :) 
On the next meeting that the GM has with the personnel please make sure to congratulate the housekeeping department. ",5,2019,07,12
231,Very Comfortable,My boyfriend and I were only staying there for the day but the room was very comfortable and it was so nice! Only downside was that the room was overlooking the patio/garden so we had to close the curtains all the time just to get some privacy. But it was great! ,5,2019,07,12
231,Recent vacation,We stayed here for a couple of days the staff were very very friendly especially the young lady on the reception when we arrived on the Thursday the hotel was very clean and comfortable a lovely place to stay thank you for making our stay very relaxing Keith and karen,5,2019,07,12
231,Fabulous,Great location and lovely room. The hotel was spotless and the staff very friendly. There was some noise late in the night from another room but it didn't take from our stay overall. Will definitely be back.,5,2019,07,10
231,almost a great stay.,"Poorly designed bedroom, with little space.  No room for clothes.  The hotel decor and staff were excellent making our stay pleasant. The location is perfect for getting to see tourist sites and for getting public transportation.",4,2019,07,09
231,Great stay,An incredibly friendly and helpful staff and the hotel great value for money. We enjoyed our stay very much and would highly recommend it to anyone staying in Dublin. It was also handy to most places of interest,5,2019,07,08
231,Dull and extremely overpriced.  ,We spent over 1300 euro for the executive room for 4 nights. The room is just a basic room with a king size bed.  No sofa.  Really drab and plain.  For Friday and Saturday we paid over 400 Euro a night.  The buffet is horrible.  If you end up staying here don’t waste your money on the breakfast.  Go across the street to the Kingfisher.  Much much much better.  ,2,2019,07,08
231,Central,"Great hotel if you want to be in the centre of things.  Stayed  here to go to Croke Park to a concert, which is a 20 minute dander away.

Breakfast was really good, buffet style with plenty of fresh produce to choose from.

Only disappointing thing was the cleanliness of the bathrooms, they were dated, bath with plastic shower curtain and chipped tiles on the floor.

231,"Good hotel, good location, excellent staff!","This was our first time in Dublin, so we didn't know where to stay or what to expect. We were very pleased with our stay at the Jury's Inn, Parnell Street. The location was fine-easy to get buses and other transportation and you can walk to some tourist attractions. There are grocery stores close-by and the area around the hotel seems very safe. The hotel is older and the rooms are smaller than in US chains, but our room was very clean and the beds were very comfortable.  Breakfast was included in our booking and it was very good. It was a full breakfast and included anything you could want. The staff was very accommodating. When I told them we had booked an early tour and we would not be able to have breakfast the next day, the desk clerk said they would order two take-away breakfasts for us and they were waiting for us at the desk (ham and cheese sandwich,  an Apple, juice ). We did order dinner in the bar after the dining room had closed and we waited quite a while for our food.  We would definitely stay there again!",4,2019,07,05
231,Close to City Centre,"The rooms were large and clean and the hotel was close to the airport. (about 40 mins by bus) and very close to city centre, easy walking distance to main attractions
Hotel clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful.
Disappointed that a breakfast was not included in the price.",4,2019,07,04
231,Excellent Location,Hotel is centrally located to many of the attractions and very close to The Temple Bar district which is a must visit while in Dublin. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are a decent size and have tea and coffee making facilities .Bed was very comfortable. Would definitely stay here again when I next visit Dublin.,5,2019,07,04
231,Good hotel,"Friendly staff, Very good services, good location, shopping mall nearby, restaurants...walking distance to major attractions - Trinity College, St. Patrick church and other churches, Grafton st shopping area ....",5,2019,07,03
231,Good hotel,"Not the best value for money I've ever had, but the room is clean with good staff and is in a reasonable location. Room were a touch small. Convenient for 747 bus and Henry Street shopping. Clean with good lobby. ",4,2019,07,03
231,Spacious ,"This hotel is within walking distance to lots of places and restaurants, though not as close to the tourist stuff. You can easily walk to Dublin Writers Museum, Garden of Remembrance, O'Connell Street, but is a little further to get to Trinity College, and Temple Bar might be too far for a comfortable walk. That said, this hotel is clean, has spacious rooms and bathrooms, and the staff is delightful. There is breakfast on site, and if you are in Dublin on the weekend, there isn't a lot that opens before 10:30. The breakfast area and bar are on the second floor. Easy access to the airport buses. And this hotel has air conditioning, so it would be a good option for the hot summer months (you totally wouldn't need AC in other times of the year!). ",5,2019,07,02
231,Great experience,"Rooms were very clean, nice friendly staff. We felt very safe here. 
We could walk to so many places with ease. Tour buses are right around the corner.
We would book here again for sure. 
And they pour a good pint of Guiness :)

231,june stay,"mattress was dirty did not sleep under cover, no wash cloths, floors dirty, very plain no counter space in bathroom hair dryer chrome plastic cracked and peeling would cut you if you weren't being careful. location good staff good price WAY out of line for what you get",2,2019,07,02
231,Nice hotel but WAYYYYY too pricey,"Me & My wife visited recently and we stayed for 3 nights, we paid £406 and when we arrived we had such a tiny room and no view outside the window,
Hotel itself is clean and staff were all nice (hense the 3 stars) but the cost for what we had was ridiculous (and the £406 was a pay in advance rate too - so the cheapest one possible)
So may think again before booking into a Jurys inn in the future unless they drasticly reduce their prices.",3,2019,07,01
231,Great hotel at a great location,"We stayed at Jurys Inn Parnell Street just for a weekend. Great location, clean  room, good breakfast, free wifi, helpful staff, close to O'connell Street with all the bus connections, not to far to walk to the Temple bar or the Dart. We had a lovelly stay in Dublin. And when we come back to visit again it is Jurys Inn Parnell Street we will choose for our Hotel.     ",5,2019,07,01
231,Not the right matrass for me,"Great location, good but rather expensive breakfast, poor beds, no safe, no fridge, no toilet brush, filthy walls in the shower, smells like they use a cheap toilet spray when you enter the hotel. Kind staff(reception, cleaners and in the restaurant). But not worth more than €200 a night.",2,2019,06,30
231,Jury’s Inn Survey,"Convenient location and friendly hotel, good size clean room, amenities and breakfast.
Would recommend to future travellers looking to tour Dublin. As a first timer to Dublin was very pleased with choosing this hotel, sight unseen.",5,2019,06,29
231,In Dublin's fair city where the girls are so pretty,"Very nice hotel, more than we expected. Very nice breakfast (unlike a lot of English hotels). Was hoping for proper tea, not teabags, well well. What gave a bit poor sleeping quality was that it was not possible to open the window in the room at all. I fully understand that people want to avoid people trying to kill themselves, but still. As a Norwegian used to colder bedrooms it felt a bit claustrophobic, therefore I have rated the sleep quality as poor. No, it doesn't helm adjusting the temperature, this is psychologica. Checking in took a long time, it also took a long time to order and pay in the restaurant/bar in the second floor. But the room in itself was really great. Big bed, large duvet. But it should be possible to sort the garbage, everything went straight in the same bin. And I missed a fridge in the room. Not a minibar, but a fridge.",4,2019,06,28
231,Tired hotel lousy coffee,"This hotel had its heyday 20 years ago. Room tired beds uncomfortable breakfast poor. And OMG don’t get me on the coffee. These days it should be simple to get a decent cup of coffee, but not here. And don’t ask the breakfast staff for a decent cup of coffee or you will get your ear chewed off. Too expensive too for the hotel quality.",2,2019,06,28
231,Very satisfactory,"All staff from the bar, reception and cleaning service were very kínd and cooperative. The hotel is very conveniently located, is quiet and the envirnonment very friendly. I travelled with my daughter and she also enyoyed the hotel very much, she fell a bit ill the first days with a cold and they were very generous both the restaurant and the bar to procure her with what she needed. ",5,2019,06,27
231,Great location,"The room is standard, very clean but no air condition and dated. The staff are very friendly and helpful.  My room was £240.  Pricey. No extra’s in the room like water or even a biscuit! 
Breakfast was good.  Great location.  But not really worth the cost.",3,2019,06,27
231,V good,"Well located hotel just off OConnell street, friendly staff comfortable room. Only down side car park a few streets away but we found it easy enough would be an issue if you had a lot of luggage. Good buffet breakfast.",4,2019,06,27
231,Great location and great staff!,"We stopped at Jury’s Inn during a family European vacation and were very pleased with the location - only minutes from great food, historical locations, and fun. The room was comfortable for our whole family, especially after a long journey overseas. ",5,2019,06,26
231,Lack understanding,"For anyone who has an unexpected change in their travel plans like I had when my flight was cancelled by the airline due to mechanical issues, this hotel did not reconsider one of the total days of my stay for reimbursement and that showed a lack of taking the clinic as the most important and lack of empathy. One day would not make this hotel go broke and hold have gone a long way in how they do care about their future clients.",1,2019,06,26
231,Delightful Dublin stay!,"We came on a mother and daughter trip and we absolutely loved our stay at Jury Inn, perfect location for sightseeing everything within 30 minute walk and only a 10-15 minute walk from Temple Bar! 
The staff are very welcoming and polite and rooms are very clean and tidy with lovely comfy beds! 
Breakfast is highly recommended, caters for everyone, full English, continental, fresh fruit and cereal. And all delicious and it is help yourself!
Also definitely recommend the restaurant, especially the lamb rump it is very tasty!! 
Highly recommended this hotel and it's staff! 
Easy access to get to on the air link bus getting off at cathal brugha street stop.  
All in all, 10/10, definitely will return! ",5,2019,06,25
231,Great budget hotel,"We were here for five nights. Out room was very clean, and so quiet that a couple nights I had to turn on the TV to get to sleep! Beds were fine, plenty of pillows, TV had several Irish and English channels. Our room faced the interior courtyard on the second floor. We paid to have breakfast the first day - it was good, standard hotel breakfast. There is a nice bar/restaurant on the 2nd floor, so if  you want a place to relax - it was great the first night when we needed a bite to eat but didn't feel like going out. Lovely, helpful front desk. The hotel is in a bustling, urban area, next to a pedestrian street with some pop up markets. A grocery store is around the corner. Not particularly close to most tourist attractions, but lots of buses, etc. We'd go back.",5,2019,06,25
231,Nice hotel in the heart of Dublin,Superb hotel for a city trip to Dublin. Its situated close to O’Connell Street and the General Post Office. The personnel is very friendly and helpfull. Excellent (beside coffee) full irish breakfast.,5,2019,06,25
231,Two stays on 1 trip to Ireland,"The family really enjoyed our stay at the Jury's Inn.  Centrally located, it was a great base to explore all that Dublin has to offer.  We actually stayed here twice.  On our start and at the end.  As some have noted we were able to check in at 7:00 a.m. This was amazing after flying overnight.  We went right to breakfast which is excellent.  The selection was substantial but more important- really good.  The staff took care of 5 really tired guests.  We really enjoyed our stay both times.",5,2019,06,25
231,very nice hotel,"i thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel.  i thought the location was great, although the other Jury's location is better.  but wasn't available.  still the walk to everything was not that bad and felt safe. ",5,2019,06,24
231,Visiting Dublin with spouse and friend after 21 amazing days in this beautiful country,"This was a very nice hotel with a great staff who strive to make your visit comfortable. After a four hour bus ride from Killarney it was a relief to have our check in process sorted out by a pleasant young lady named Catrina. Because our reservations were made by a friend who arrived a few hours earlier  room assignments were a bit confusing, however Catrina quickly sorted this out. All of us found the breakfast buffet to be great , good quality and many tasty things to choose from.  The location was perfect. You can walk to most anything, but if your not a walker, or have an impairment, local transportation , buses, rapid transit, etc. are right around the corner . We would definitely stay at this particular Jury's Inn again.",4,2019,06,24
231,Not Worth The Stress!,"We booked and paid in full for this accommodation months in advance. It was a no cancellation booking. When we arrived after 30 hours in transit, we were told that they had overbooked and we would be moved to their hotel out of town. We specifically chose this hotel for the location as it was close to the activities we had planned as we had limited time in Dublin. A tour leader who had booked too many rooms heard our conversation and made one of his rooms available to us. There was no attempt to make contact with us during the stay or apologise for the stress caused at check-in. Not even a free drink!! Overbooking, we discovered afterwards, is a common theme in reviews for this hotel. This is an ingenious way of doing business and I would not stay with this hotel chain again. Nor would I recommend it to fellow travellers. There are many other great options. Stay with a hotel chain that respects your hard earned money.",1,2019,06,24
231,Nice hotel great location,Great hotel for our one night pre cruise stay in Dublin.  Great buffet for breakfast.  Rooms are very clean but a bit small which is not unusual for hotels in Europe.  Location is very close to everything.  ,5,2019,06,24
231,Not an exciting location,"Perhaps we were spoiled by the other four hotels we visited on our trip to Ireland.  The Jury's Hotel Parnell was clean, but it was not an interesting place to stay.  The neighborhood around it was not the best, but it was not too far from places to see.  The restaurant food was ordinary and they ran out of some items.  Coffee in the room was greatly appreciated.",3,2019,06,23
231,Great location,"Great central location,near shops restaurants and transport . Hotel clean and comfortable. Friendly helpful staffs.  Great value for money. Would happily recommend to friends. Bed was a little small but comfortable. ",4,2019,06,23
231,Excellent service,"Highly recommend this hotel great location, good facilities and nice rooms. Will definitely use again. Ps why does this have to be 200 characters I am starting to run out of superlatives and nice things to say",5,2019,06,23
231,Jury's Inn Dublin Parnell,"Enjoyed the very quiet room we had which I specifically requested. Staff was very courteous and helpful. The hotel is in an excellent location just a less than 5 minute walk to bus, particularly the Airport bus which we took to and from the hotel.  There are lots of restaurants and shops within minutes walking.",5,2019,06,23
231,"Location, quite.","Great location handy for shopping  very central, comfortable, staff very helpful. We’ll definitely recommend this accommodation if your either just visiting or going to concerts bus’s available close by.",5,2019,06,23
231,Great Location - Used for Base of travel,"The staff was wonderful, I had some personal issues and they were very helpful. I was very surprised to find that the hotel does NOT have a business office so I could print items needed to handle some issues. I had to send to the staff and wait for them to print. Not my favorite thing to do, but it is what it is. The room was very clean. We had three people in our room so it was tight, but the staff did a great job. For this caliber of hotel I was surprised at the lack of amenities in the rooms. I could have sworn when I booked that it indicated there would be a fridge in the room and there was none. No I did not ask about that. The bathroom sink had cracks and there were grout that needs replacing in the bathroom, but the room itself was fine. The bed was super comfortable. The young adults I traveled with (never traveled internationally before) were very impressed with the comforter and bed. The location of the hotel is awesome. It's close to almost everything. The never ate in the dining room - it even seemed at times that it was only open for the tour groups. The bar area was very comfortable. I did eat some appetizers which were provided by the kitchen and very good. The staff was a bit slow for service...if you did not go up to the bar for our drink or order, they ignored you. My only other issue was that our room was on the 2nd floor and I have no idea what was above us, but it sounded like a bowling alley all night every night......Close to everything and we walked all over the city from this hotel.",4,2019,06,23
231,good base,Stayed 1 night pre cruise Good base for seeing the city - only 10 mins walk to the river and Temple Bar. Rooms ok size - bed comfortable  Hotel retaurant good  Breakfast room good- choices plentiful  Staff helpful at reception,4,2019,06,23
231,Perfect location,This hotel is within walking distance of everything you need or want to do. Rooms are very clean and staff very helpful and pleasant. My only complaint would be the spotty internet service.  My phone would not stay connected every time I went to browse something I would have to reconnect,5,2019,06,23
231,A Ok Stay.,"A Nice room, very clean, the Staff were friendly when approached but no interaction took place between the staff and customers.  Not a lot of atmosphere anywhere in the hotel, from the restaurant to the bar to the reception area.  The area it is situated in is a bit run down and this does not come across in the description of the hotel.  Tidy up around the hotel and it would be more appealing.  The restaurant food was very basic for a 4* hotel. The breakfast was good and plenty of choice. ",3,2019,06,22
231,Great location. Nice experience,My wife and I stayed two nights during a drive around Ireland. Hotel is very convenient to O’Connell street. Clean and  rooms are nice. Room was quiet in the off street side of the hotel. Great breakfast buffet. ,5,2019,06,21
231,Extra customer service,"When we first got to the hotel there was a huge party checking in and it seemed chaotic but we were in our room pretty quickly. The room was large, clean and had a very comfortable bed and since we were visiting Dublin for our Anniversary, there were heart balloons on the bed, chocolate and an invitation for a complementary Prosecco in the bar. A very nice welcome. The staff was so accommodating because we wanted a lighter duvet and a top sheet and could we please have another chair? Haha! They did it all quickly and cheerfully. Breakfast was good and if you prepay it’s only 11 euro. The location was good too and walking distance to everything. Parnell is a busy street but with the window closed it was really quiet- I’m a super light sleeper and we slept great there. Highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,06,20
231,They still are holding the pre-authorisation - how annoying ,"7 days ago an authorisation was taken from my card as well as payment for £600 .. I was told it would be refunded the next day - 7 days later they still have the money .... 

How rude and unfair is this - don’t trust them they lie about there intentions.

",1,2019,06,20
231,Great hotel with excellent service,"Comfortable rooms with nice beds - excellent service all Way through - little difficult to Get understood in the bar, but never mind we Got something in the end. We likes the tea facility in the room and the icemachine outside the room.",5,2019,06,20
231,Great Stay At Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street,"Well located hotel in Dublin City Centre, in walking distance to most of the top attractions. Staff were brilliant, top marks to Dolores & Robert on reception, Milosz & Daria in Bar/Restaurant & Irina in Breakfast Room. Full marks to all of these five staff, they are a credit to the hotel, well done!!! They all had fabulous peoples skills and were very helpful, thanks!!!",5,2019,06,19
231,Very mixed review,"Nowhere to park out front when offloading luggage & not mentioned on website except to say parking is available, albeit some 600+ metres away. The room was well appointed & reception staff most helpful. When checking out of the carpark that was a disaster to say the least. On checking in we were told to simply insert the ticket on leaving the carpark which we did. Unfortunately the ticket did not work so walked back to reception leaving my wife with the car & was told by reception that ticket was ok & to try again. Walked back again to the carpark & again ticket did not work saying that I needed to pay the parking fee at the pay station in order to exit. We ended up paying the 23€ just to get out of the carpark. Not impressed at all.",2,2019,06,19
231,Location is very good but facilities can be improved,The hotel has a great location which is closes to tourists places and shopping areas. The only thing I would complain is the bathroom. The showerhead was fixed to the ceiling but facing the wall which means I had to squeeze myself towards to the wall in order to have a shower. I am a fairly small person but still found it uncomfortable so I don't know how other people were coping with.,3,2019,06,19
231,"perfect location, great service",location of the jurys inn is perfect for a weekend in dublin. right in the middle of the all the shops and pubs. rooms are standard and very quiet perfect for couples of friends. the only thing missing in the room was a minibar. ,5,2019,06,19
231,Visit for concert,"Hotel staff at Jury's were so helpful, friendly and accommodating, highly recommend.
From reception to bar staff and housekeeping staff couldn't do enough for us.
Comfortable beds, cleanliness excellent.",5,2019,06,18
231,Shambolic Check in,"We arrived early due to an early flight, the hotel was happy to provide facility for storing bags which was great, unfortunately it was downhill from there.
We were told that our rooms would not be ready until 16:00 (not great for a 15:00 check in). Upon returning to check in at 16:00 the room was still not ready, this is completely unacceptable. The customer facing staff were friendly and helpful enough, however the cleaning staff could be heard on the radio telling reception if they could clean rooms quicker they should try, completely unprofessional.

When we did finally get into the room it was comfortable enough, and the facilities were pretty good.",1,2019,06,17
231,First trip to ireland,"Very nice hotel. Staff is very kind and Will help you with all your questions. The restaurant and breakfastbuffet was delicious. It's nice that's in the city and the transport like tram, bus and train are from walking distance. Only complain that we had is that if the people next door talk very loud or smash their door you hear it very loudly in the room.",4,2019,06,16
231,Central location in Dublin ,"Just spent 3 nights at jury’s Inn Dublin Parnell Street. We had 2 rooms for 3adults and one teenage. Rooms had big floor to ceiling windows with views of the street. The room had comfortable beds, small but adequate bathroom with soap and shampoo dispenser, good shower. Tea and coffee making in the room. Breakfast was an option but worth the cost. Full English breakfast along with sweet breakfast rolls and breads. European meats cheeses and fruits. Buffet style so no waiting. 
Location is excellent. Many restaurants and stores in easy walking distance as was public transport just outside the door. 
Will stay again next trip to Dublin and recommend highly.  Did I mention helpful, friendly and welcoming staff. A great city hotel. ",5,2019,06,13
231,Great stay,Had a wonderful stay here with my wife for our anniversary. Staff most welcoming. Accommodation very comfortable and food was top quality. Would love to come back again for my wife’s birthday in September. Highly recommend ,4,2019,06,13

231,Fabulous stay - First time in Dublin,It was a fabulous stay and the accommodations were excellent!  The hotel staff was extremely helpful right down to providing spot on recommendations for places to see and eat. I would recommend Jury’s Inn to everyone visiting Dublin. ,5,2019,06,10
231,Great stay at Jurys Inn Parnell St!,"This was my second time to stay here and I had a very pleasant time here.It was clean, comfortable and I felt very safe.The staff were helpful and pleasant.The breakfast was really good value and tasty.",5,2019,06,10
231,Jurys Inn Parnell St.,When we checked in we were a little concerned about the location of this hotel. Phone map took us on back streets. Once there and on main streets it was a very convenient location. We walked to all the city sites we wanted to see. If we left a do not disturb sign on the door the house keeping staff left clean towels and bathroom tissue at the door. The room was clean and comfortable.,5,2019,06,09
231,Basic,"Basic hotel with average rooms.  Nothing special about hotel and location. Had a sandwich in the bar that was not good. Breakfast  buffet was good. Service checking in and out was good. Executive room not worth it, not a larger nicer room by any means.",4,2019,06,09
231,"Decent hotel, wonderful staff","Really enjoyed my stay. Very central, clean, and the staff were polite, engaging, & very helpful.  A special mention to Liz & Katrina!  Decent size bar with a good menu.  Dublin is more expensive than London, so please bear that in mind.  Would highly recommend.",4,2019,06,09
231,"Nice, quiet hotel in the heart of it sll","Excellent location with a short walk from Airlink drop-off. Easy walk to Temple Bar district, shopping, and train station . Very quiet for sleep even though right downtown.  Bed was quite comfortable . Room was on small size, but, who needs a large room - there's lots to see and do!",5,2019,06,09
231,Good Enough,"Did the job but in a basic, no frills, slightly expensive way. Room was noisy and there were few TV channels. Bed was hard. However location was great for the office I was working in, staff were efficient and pleasant, check-in/check-out via mobile/kiosk was very slick.",4,2019,06,08
231,Very nice and clean hotel,I stayed there for 12 nights. Comfortable rooms with great mattresses and pillows. The breakfast was tasty but it was exactly the same every day. Good location about 10-15min walk from Temple bar area.,4,2019,06,08
231,One night stay,"A good nights sleep, though the room expensive compared to other hotels stayed at especially as the room lacked facilities such  as a fridge and safe deposit box, both of which we needed use of. Breakfast was good and the hotel in a good position. Room and bathroom clean but very basic toiletries etc",3,2019,06,08
231,"Great hotel, wonderful service","We loved our stay. Rooms were clean, modern and bright. Service was wonderful. Especially breakfast. Liz took GREAT care of us!! Thank you for the warm hospitality. Location was perfect, too. Wonderful value.",5,2019,06,08
231,Bad customer service/management,The hotel itself was lovely and centred to everything however we found the customer service not up to standards after discovering something had been charged to our card from the bar that wasn't us we addressed it at the reception area and was assured by the manager that she would speak to staff and go through cctv and get back to us later that day and provide refund if discovered it wasn't us well a month later we are still awaiting this call and the refund poor customer service,3,2019,06,08
231,Perfect location,Jury’s Inn is a beautiful hotel that is centrally located. The only reason I didn’t give it five stars is it didn’t have sufficient outlets. They supply a blow dryer but no out let near a mirror. Otherwise the restaurants cleanliness and location are perfect.,4,2019,06,07
231,Excellent visit,"Jury's Inn , Parnell Street is just perfect for it's location and price.  It is quite central to most things- the Go-Dublin stops, tourist attractions, Temple Bar, Tesco, eateries.  From the airport, we took the AirLink  bus from Dublin airport and it stopped just minutes away from Jury's Inn. The Kingfisher Restaurant was just across which was a nice and friendly restaurant.",4,2019,06,06
231,Wonderful Dublin Memories,"A well run, efficient, clean & comfortable hotel that is within walking distance to all the major attractions & nightlife. The rooms were spacious & quiet & the staff friendly & very helpful.Car parking is available at a local company with a discount for hotel guests (€15 per day).",5,2019,06,06
231,Bar staff,Thanks so much to Andrew and Milosz for being the best bar staff we encountered in our week in Ireland.  Very professional with the right amount of banter.  We really appreciated the service.  Thanks again.,5,2019,06,06
231,Great hotel,this was my 3rd stay in the hotel and the 2nd time with other couples. the location is brilliant and the service and cleanliness cannot be faulted. only a short walk to the temple bar area. wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.,5,2019,06,05
231,Very nice hotel,"Stayed at this property for 2 nights at the beginning of a 8 day Ireland escorted tour with gate 1 . Very central hotel with fresh, well designed room with very comfortable beds.
Very central for exploring Dublin attractions. Breakfast buffet was excellent with great choices. Staff were very nice and friendly.Would definately stay again.",5,2019,06,05
231,Good location just off O'Connell Street,"Good service, friendly and polite staff. Easy check in and out. Very comfortable bed. Bathroom needs an update by todays standards. Breakfast was extensive and well laid out. Able to leave luggage before and after stay.",4,2019,06,04
231,Rude staff,"Stayed here with 3 couples on 1 night, and 2 couples on a second night.  Attended 2 concerts. On the first night we were in the hospital bar and got served at 01:30hours, we were informed that we can get a drink but we had to drink it outside the bar, thus we didn't have an issue with. On the 2nd night we attempted to get a drink at 01:15 and we were dismissed at the bar by the male bartender all he said was I've called last orders.  We asked him if it was possible to get a drink and he repeated I called last orders and then disengaged with us.  I had another date booked in November and because of this experience, I've booked with another hotel provider. ",2,2019,06,04
231,Bad sleep and useless room keys,"Didn't get a wink of sleep, bed extremely small and on wheels so it kept moving if you turn over in bed. The most annoying thing was the room key not working on THREE occasions, so i had to keep going up and down. and these were not kept near a phone/bank card to disable them. The last thing you need when you have luggage and have got off a flight is to keep going up and down to fix your room key. i would not stay here again.",2,2019,06,04
231,Nice Older Style Hotel in a great location,"Jurys Inn Parnell Street is a well maintained older hotel in a fantastic location in the heart of Dublin. The majority of staff were friendly, helpful and went out of their way for guests. The room was a good size and the bathroom facilities were above average. A small criticism was that our bed was a bit lumpy. The breakfast was really good and the sausages were the best! The restaurant and bar on the second floor was nice. We ate lunch there on our first day which was Monday. The food was fresh and so good, we had a return visit on the Wednesday. Unfortunately the experience wasn't repeated. My fish and chips was almost inedible. The batter was like rubber. It had clearly been cooked previously and microwaved. My wife said the same about her pasta. I suspect the quality of the food varies with the day it is cooked. All in all however, the experience was excellent and I would definitely return,",5,2019,06,03
231,Great location but no parking,"Great location but no parking and not informed about the car park hotel use, bed uncomfortable, staff unhelpful, noise in hotel all night, undercooked breakfast, the only people that was any bit helpful was the door man, as he helped with taxis, main door close at 12 at night understandable but when trying to get into hotel you are looked at like a robber, stains on the bedroom walls",1,2019,06,03
231,"Great location, very welcoming ","I stayed at the Jurys Inn for 2 nights last week whilst away in Dublin with some friends, we felt very welcomed and the staff were very friendly. Our room was on the top floor and given that it is in the centre of Dublin it was incredibly peaceful. The room had everything you need, hairdryer, tea/coffee making facilities, toiletries, towels and even air con which is often costs extra in each room. I couldn’t locate the safe in our room however my friends had one in theirs, free to use but if you lose the key then you have to pay. We didn’t have breakfast at the hotel so cannot comment on that however very happy and satisfied with our stay. I will hopefully be back! ",5,2019,06,03
231,Excellent location,"A comfortable hotel in a great location, close to O’Connell St, restaurants, bars and shops. It is within walking distance of most of the main tourist attractions (eg less than 30 min walk to the Guinness Storehouse or Jameson Bow St) Breakfast is a hot and cold buffet and is of a good quality and variety. 
",5,2019,06,03
231,Jurys Inn Dublin,"Let me start with saying that all the hotels in Dublin are expensive.  If you take a 4 * hotel in other cities you get more luxury that we had in Dublin.  Everything was very clean, room size was ok but the bathroom was very small.  Bed was also very small for 2 adults but because we were on a citytrip you are not that often in your room.  Food was fine. The people of the hotel were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good and there was enough choice.",4,2019,06,03
231,"Hotel and bartender,Andrew","Kudos to this hotel for our family stay, through 6/3/19.  Very clean, modern room, close to area transit and attractions.  Staff member that really stood out was Andrew, in the pub.  He was friendly, helpful, attentive and had lots of suggestions about drinks to try, things to see in area.  His personality makes him the best bartender we have met on our trip of 10 days in London and 5 days in Dublin.  Congrats to him for his good work!",5,2019,06,03
231,Stay for concert,"Staff at reception were helpful and friendly. Rooms were very small for the price of the room 209 a night I'd expect better standards on room size. Lifts took ages to come down when you press buttons and when we took one of the lifts it went out of order while we used it bit of inconvenience. Woke up from noise from neighbour rooms in the morning, had a terrible stay. Wont be staying again",2,2019,06,01
231,Basic,"Starting with the positive, it is in a fantastic location. 
The rooms however are very small. I have travelled all over Ireland and by far the smallest room. 
Staff at check in were friendly however, the bar staff were less pleasant to deal with. 
Food was not good. BLT untoasted with barely cooked bacon. 
Bar closed at 1.30 with no warning, just told we had to leave. No last call or prior warning. 
Poor overall for €200 a night. 
",3,2019,06,01
231,Fantastic,Fantastic stay would definitely stay here again staff at reception are so helpful and knowledgeable rooms are spacious and very well kept wonderful staff. Breakfast is buffet style so much to choose from if you are vegetarian or meat eater food is 1st class.,5,2019,05,31
231,A little retail therapy in Dublin,"This is an excellent, well located property close to the city centre.  I stayed here with my daughter and we were greeted warmly by the staff at reception. I had requested a quiet room as I am recovering from surgery. We were allocated a room on the third floor overlooking the courtyard. There wasn't a sound which was lovely. The property is very close to Henry Street and O'Connell street. When you come out of the front entrance turn left and look for the Ilac shopping centre. Go straight through this and you will arrive in Henry Street where all the main shops are. It is ithen easy to access O'Connell Street, Grafton Street, Temple Bar etc. I can definitely recommend this hotel for the comfortable rooms and the buffet breakfast with lots of healthy options. Would have liked some potato bead though! Good value for money property. Will definitely return. ",5,2019,05,31
231,The Jury IS In,"And the verdict...Jury's Inn is excellent!!

Dublin is a great city with lots of options. For Dublin, when considering a hotel we were all about location. We wanted someplace that was central (walkable) from key locations about the city. Jury Inn offers that. On top of it all, the hotel is prime location for Henry Street if you love shopping, buskers, food, and drink. 

The Jury's Inn is a well manged, very clean, remarkably quiet hotel in the middle of everything. The Airlink bus stops are very close for coming and going, and transportation needs are easily fullfilled nearby by taxi, streetcar, bus, or Hop on-Hop Off buses. 

The staff is very friendly, knowledgable, helpful, and patient. The rooms are standard, but well kept, quiet, comfortable and clean. Morning breakfast ranges from full Irish to thorough continental, depending upon your hunger. The resturant and bar are well-stocked, full menued, and very good. 

This is a great hotel to use as your homebase while visiting Dublin. It is surrounded by wonderful Pubs and eating establishments, sites to see, and plenty of stores to pick up the odds and ends or trinkets for home. Best of all, it's very reasonable!

If you are heading to Dublin, I highly recommend the Jury's Inn as your choice.",5,2019,05,30
231,Not the best place.. wouldn’t return,"Is what it is, good location basic amenities, relatively clean. Needs modernising and decorating, staff in bar were friendly, poor standard for the superior room and not really value for money, shame as Dublin is great! ",3,2019,05,30
231,Helpful suggestions for a valuable stay,The location and service received were excellent. We were disappointed there was no airport shuttle or early check-in. Having taken an overnight flight we were exhausted and needed a nap (3-4 hours) to refresh ourselves. Fortunately our relatives had checked in a day ahead and we napped in their room. The offering of these two suggestions would certainly make this a 5-star hotel.,4,2019,05,30
231,Neat and clean,"Very nice hotel in downtown Dublin,  close to pubs, eateries and entertainment areas. On main trolley line. Hotel is neat and very clean, however  it does not cater to people used to having wash cloths or taking showers, bathrooms have curved bottom tubs with shower heads, not very good for old legs. Breakfast was adequate and typical Irish fare.",3,2019,05,29
231,Lovely hotel,This is a great hotel to stay in if you wish to explore the city on foot . The rooms are of a good size and grr breakfast is delicious . All the staff are friendly and helpful . Our only disappointment was the shower .... the water pressure was a bit too low and there was no hand held shower ,5,2019,05,29
231,Excellent Hotel!!!,"This hotel is amazing! Staff is wonderful, rooms are clean and location is great. I highly recommend this hotel. We go to Dublin every year and was very pleasantly surprised at this hotel. Don't pass up an opportunity to stay here!",5,2019,05,29
231,jurys inn,very nice clean hotel. staff were very friendly and helpful. food was good. rooms were lovely.  definitely would recommend . central to everything. busses trams shops pubs and entertainment.  i would definitely use this hotel again ,5,2019,05,29
231,Spice girls,Hotel is lovely and great location. Staff was so helpful and friendly. Manager so helpful when we came in and took our bags and keep them safe till we check in. Check in was so easy and fast. Food was lovely. Bathroom could do with upgrade. ,5,2019,05,28
231,would definitely recommend,"Lovely staff very helpful nothing was too much trouble, excellent room service quality food for tired kids. Quiet clean rooms and great central location. I would definitely book with Jury’s inn again. ",5,2019,05,28
231,Mini Break to see Mark Knopfler,"I booked tickets for my Husband for the 3 Arena for Christmas. The hotel was perfectly situated to access as we flew to Dublin airport and bus to get back was just around the corner. Also to get to 3Arena was perfect as just walked down the road and jumped on the Luas.(tram) 
Very clean, quiet and friendly staff.,",5,2019,05,28
231,The best choice of the accommodation in the center of Dublin,"We booked several hotels in Parnell Sq area first (with cancellation option), then tried to compare using other people's reviews. Finally we chose Jurys Inn and did not regret it for a second. Perfect location, very quiet (we were staying on the 5th floor, window towards inner yard). The only slight concern was some sort of an odd smell in the room (possibly some cleaning chemical, not sure), but that disappeared next day as we always kept window open to have fresh air in the room. Staff is friendly and helping, we liked the breakfast, too. However, there are so many options out there for eating out to try we only used it on the first morning. Comfortable beds and pillows deserve separate notion. Would suggest to have toilet brush in bathroom (minor disasters happen!).",5,2019,05,28
231,Spice Girls,"Didn’t spend long in the hotel due to the concert but we did interact with staff during check in, a nice gentleman showed us how to use the self service check in and we also got ice from the bar. Everyone was helpful.",5,2019,05,28
231,Nice hotel,Nice hotel and bar but the room was very poor quality for the money that we paid. There was very little room for 2 of us and had a smell of stale cigarettes. The bar was nice but very noisy with loud music and hard to have a conversation. ,3,2019,05,28
231,A new Hotel for me in Dublin,"A good room with good service. Perhaps not as well situated as other Hotels this Jury's Inn is one I would recommend,. I will probably return for a business trip - but high prices in Dublin means I will probably look elsewhere for a social visit.",4,2019,05,27
231,Nice hotel,"We were very satisfied with our stay at the hotel. The rooms were clean, quiet, and the beds quite cosy. The hotel staff was very polite and helpful. The location of the hotel is very good, close to all the attractions. We definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,05,27
231,One night in Jurrys Inn,Is pent only one night at the hotel but I would recommend it because of its location and helpful staff. They let us leave our baggage before check-in and were kind to call a taxi. I can not comment on food because we left before the breakfast. ,4,2019,05,27
231,Very Accommodating ,"Arrived in Dublin at 4:30 a m. Jurys gave us our room at that time. We were surprised since we were very early for our reservation. 
The restaurant/bar is pleasant and the bartenders were helpful. 
The location is perfect for sightseeing and walking around the city. ",4,2019,05,23
231,"Clean, Comfortable, Affordable and Great Customer Service","The Jurys Inn was more than myself or my wife could have hoped for. While that may sound like hyperbole, it certainly isn't and I'll explain why. 

After Killarney and Dingle, we came to Dublin and arrived at our Airbnb, with the door wide open and no response from the owner of the flat. My wife didn't feel safe and I don't blame her, but we decided to go get some food and wait to hear form the owner. After a late lunch and no word from said owner, my wife began to panic. It was now 8pm and we had to make a decision, stay in the place we paid 3 nights for and not feel safe(not an option) or search for a nearby Hotel and hope they have a room available at a price we could manage.

That's where Jurys Inn came in; thanks to the staff and especially the Hotel manager, we were able to secure the last room they had available. She listened to our situation and helped us navigate some online sites to secure the best price for the room. She also gave us a voucher for a free breakfast at their restaurant, which was delicious. The dinner we had on our own dime was very good as well. Though we lost most the money from the airbnb, the additional money spent at Jurys Inn was well worth it. 

We stayed 3 nights in total and we had a clean, comfortable and affordable stay in a good location for walking the city. If you are looking for something that checks these boxes, Jurys Inn is the place for you. 

Thanks for making the last half of our trip as good as the first.
",5,2019,05,22
231,The Service is Amazing,"Before I arrived, a relative of mine phoned them to ask if they would be able to send a birthday present to me at the hotel, as I would be there on my birthday.

When my partner and I arrived and got the keys to our room, we found some very lovely surprises awaited us, courtesy of the hotel. I have never experienced this level of service in any other hotel, even supposed 'five star' places! Top marks Parnell Street for making my birthday one to remember!",5,2019,05,22
231,Amazing as always,"Jury’s Parnell Street is the only hotel is the only hotel I will stay in when I bust Dublin . We are always looked after by Patrick who is the manager. He personally goes out of his way as do all the staff at the hotel .  Also best accommodation services for disabled guests like myself as my mum . A huge thank you to Patrick and all his staff at Jury’s hotel Parnell Street .
This review is long over due as I have been staying at this hotel for years .",5,2019,05,22
231,Terrible business hotel,"Always long queues at reception, room service does not answer the phone and they refuse to provide their one of the most basic and necessary services nowadays: lending a plug converter from the continental to the irish one, because literally ""they do not trust that guest will give them back"". Very funny policy which has left me uncommunicated and unable to work for the evening. 

",1,2019,05,21
231,Great Friendly service.  Clean comfortable rooms.  Great breakfast,"Stayed the weekend with my Mum and Daughter.  Great friendly service, good atmosphere.  Central location for the city and lovely breakfast with huge choice.  Rooms clean and comfortable.   Evening meals served in the bar.  Breakfast in the restaurant.  ",5,2019,05,21
231,Clean and tidy Hotel,"Amazing & respectful staff and reception, helpful with friendly smile. Some staff are angels. The hot breakfast buffet is just wonderful. I never tasted and over easy eggs like here, with many other options and dishes. The location is amazing few steps from Henry avenue and o’connell street with an amazing shopping area around. With Upper Luas stop in the vicinity you would find an airport shuttle. Facing the gate of the hotel Tesco market and Lidle is around the corner to the left of the hotel. I wish to write a separate compliment to the staff who received me and helped me with transportation; she needs to be promoted.",5,2019,05,20
231,Primier inn minus,Wifi was virtually unusable - I complained but nothing was done. Standard slightly below a premier inn but double the price. The rest of the service was passible and the breakfast very average. Not worth 200 euros a night ,3,2019,05,20
231,Don't expect to receive the room you book and pay for!,"City centre hotel in less than desirable area. Very busy and had a long wait to check in.
Once I reached the front desk I was told my room had been sold as the hotel was overbooked, even through I had pre-paid, in full, for an Executive Room.
I was provided with a 'Superior' room, (an Oxymoron if ever I've seen one) which was one of the last rooms available in the hotel and directly opposite the lifts. Consequently I had little to no sleep during my first night at the hotel due to the audible noise from the 24 hour operation of the lifts.

To compound the hotel's mistake, the staff were unable to refund me the difference in room rate per night and were only able to offer me a breakfast voucher by way of compensation. If I had wanted breakfast at the hotel I would have booked this with the hotel directly at time of booking. The Manager did then provide me with a £10 bar credit once I pointed this out. I would have rather eaten out, but this forced my hand somewhat.

Given the Hotel's location, the bar area on the second floor is open to the public and unfortunately this attracts a number of patrons who are in a sorry state. They were routinely removed by security and the manager once the bar staff became aware, but this did leave me feeling a little unsafe within the hotel. As a result, I promptly ate my meal and left. 

I was moved on the second day to an Executive Room once one had become available, but the quality of the room was below par of that of Jury's Inn's competitors, given the city centre premium being charged per night, so it was largely disappointing. 

Suffice to say I won't be staying here again and I would look elsewhere than the Jury's Inn brand when booking business travel in the future.",1,2019,05,20
231,Good place to stay.,"Stayed for two nights in May preceding a cruise.  Clean room (though a bit dated), helpful staff, and good location.  Walked to all destinations including Guinness Storehouse which took about 30-minutes at a leisurely pace.  Taxi from the airport cost us 20 Euros.  Didn’t do breakfast at the hotel so can’t comment on the food.   Would return again.",4,2019,05,19
231,weekend stay,Great location and a very friendly staff that was happy to help and gave good suggestions of what to do and see in Dublin. The bathroom could have been renovated and a bit cleaner. Breakfast was good as well.,4,2019,05,19
231,Mid week break,"This Hotel is in a central location for shops, restaurants, bars and the Hop on hop off bus stop , breakfast has a good variety, rooms are clean, the staff where very helpful especially Daria and Milosz.",5,2019,05,18
231,Very nice and helpful staff - disappointing neighbourhood,"The staff was extremely nice and helpful. They provided us with all necessary information about the location of the places we wanted to visit, distances, buses, etc.
The Hotel is clean but clearly needs to be renovated. Old furniture and bathroom.
We didn't like the neighbourhood (no nice restaurants, or pubs, or shops). I will find a different one for a future visit.",3,2019,05,18
231,"Basic accommodation, good location","Basic, clean accommodation. No charm or character and no safety deposit box in the room. Good WiFi. Bed and pillows ok and the room was surprisingly quiet. Great location and the 747 bus to/from the airport is just around the corner. ",3,2019,05,17
231,Great location.,"Very convenient for central Dublin, and priced accordingly.
Rooms are quite dated and ours had a large unwanted second bed which took up lots of space. 
All clean and tidy, reception staff were excellent and unlike many hotels, were cheery as well as efficient and helpful.  
Breakfast was a decent quality varied buffet with the usual problems of luke warm food, but was generally good other than that. 
Its a good standard of hotel and fits the bill if you want a central location.",4,2019,05,17
231,Disappointing service,"I’m writing this from my room!! Superior service seems to mean small double bed, sofa couch & some vouchers for free coffees & 10% off restaurant/bar. My colleague travelling with me on same board didn’t get these vouchers.
I did ask for net curtains as my room looks out into an overlooked quadrangle. Despite asking twice (and both times being assured that someone would be at my room in a few minutes, no one attended. I’m not prudish but as a single female traveller I don’t need to be in a goldfish bowl. Staff are pleasant but lack training.. and lifts are annoying as you need your card key to go anywhere. Disappointed in the brand - I thought it was meant to be better than most.. but it’s just the same albeit with a different name.",3,2019,05,16
231,Jurys Inn,Good location. Breakfast buffet was delicious. Staff were very welcoming and provided excellent service. Inconvenient parking. Could provide a valet parking option.No safe in room. Decor could be updated. ,4,2019,05,16
231,"Excellent, Conveniently-Located Dublin, Ireland, Hotel!","My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at Jurys Inn Parnell Street Hotel in Dublin, Ireland! The hotel's location was close to the Hop-On-Hop-Off bus stop # 1, where we could also catch buses for various tours and an airport shuttle. The hotel staff was professional, friendly, and helpful. We enthusiastically recommend this hotel to others visiting Dublin, Ireland!",5,2019,05,16
231,Great Location,"Stayed 1 nite at Jury’s Inn.  Great rate from hotels.com.  Very convenient location to shopping along Henry Street and O’Connell Street.  The  checkin was very pleasant.  Room was comfortable however bathroom was a little small.  Overall, good stay.",5,2019,05,15
231,Best Place to Stay in Dublin!,"Awesome facilities, comfortable bed with blackout curtains, warn and helpful welcome checking in. Bowl of apples as you get off the elevator.  Great breakfast, and comfortable bar/lounge with food service when the restaurant is not open. Centrally located, close proximity to so many places to go.",5,2019,05,15
231,Good position but something missing,"The hotel is nice and in a very good position. The price is too high: there were no amenities in the bathroom (except soap and shampoo) and there was not a minibar in the room.
Their restaurant is good but I waited 45 min for a salad, I complained and they made me a discount of 50%, fair enough.
The staff is very nice and kind.
It's nice overall but need to improve to be a 4 stars hotel.",3,2019,05,15
231,Sightseeing in Dublin,The hotel is very centrally located that you can visit Dublin on foot. The atmosphere is friendly. The rooms are very clean. The breakfast is very good. You can sleep well. Be careful to get a higher situated room with a view.,4,2019,05,14
231,First trip to Dublin,"What a lovely city Dublin is. Ideal hotel location for the cities attractions. Good service & bar. Good selection of food at breakfast, but lacked latte & capacino coffee.

231,"Great stay, good location and helpful staff.","The Jury's Inn, north of the LIffy River on Parnell St., is in a good location, a 10 minute walk to the Temple Bar area for example. The breakfast is comprehensive, with many choices. Nice bar area on the 2nd floor to eat, drink and meet up. A grocery/liquor store is located across the street where you'll find everything you may need. The rooms were clean, complimentary fruit available daily in lobby areas. Our whole group was happy with our stay. ",5,2019,05,13

Groceries opposite, near airport bus stop and walk to all attractions possible.
Lovely smelling lobby with fruit water available.
Only gripe was the thin walls - we were disturbed by our neighbour coughing all night.",4,2019,05,11
231,Perfect in every way,"We stayed here after a long flight from Florida.  It was clean, inviting comfortable and quiet. The check in was quick and easy.

231,Great location!,We loved our stay at Jurys Inn. It is just around the corner from where many tours pick up on O’Connell street. After arriving at the hotel at 4:30 AM from a very early flight we were very grateful they allowed us to check in early! Tesco across the street was perfect for some quick sandwiches and snacks. Super comfy bed!!,5,2019,05,07

231,Nice hotel and location - beware if you have food allergies.....,"This was overall a nice hotel; couldn't fault the reception staff who were excellent (was upgraded to an Executive Room). Bar facilities are very nice, restaurant food I found pretty average but staff in general were very good. However, on having breakfast, decided to have a cereal which I thought was plain corn flakes- none of the cereals were labelled though. I had a mild reaction which I put down to eating nuts. I could only assume that it was the corn flakes and then realized it could be Crunchy Nut Corn Flakes or equivalent. Whilst not a severe reaction, this could have been a lot worse. I subsequently reported this to Restaurant Manager who seemed to have no idea what a nut allergy was. I was amazed. Just feel that some basic labelling of the cereals and foodstuff in your restaurant wouldn't go amiss. Not life threatening in my case but could be much worse for someone with a more severe allergen. ",3,2019,05,03
231,Great stay in the heart of Dublin,"Great hotel for location, service and amenities. New addition to the hotel is room service, the food is excellent and the rooms are exceptional.

231,Minimal options,"Great location, but it lacks basic features such as USB ports, comfortable bedding,  a mini fridge, and towels for 2.  If you are budget conscious, it may be doable.  If you want some additional amenities, it is not your place.",3,2019,05,01
231,Good Location,"This hotel has a good location just off of O’Connell Street. The rooms are small but the bed is comfortable. The room was clean. We opted for the breakfast which was good, actually better than we expected.

Recommend this hotel.  Very serviceable.",4,2019,04,29
231,Lovely hotel,"Ideally located. Rooms are absolutely gorgeous, huge and well-equipped. The entire hotel is spotless. Staff were all very friendly.

231,"Great value, location, and Breakfast!","This location is perfect for shopping and is a 10-15min walk to most sights. The staff were all really nice, the room was clean, and breakfast was definitely  a standout! The location is perfect for shopping- we stayed here our last night in Dublin and it was a great homebase to get to all the stores in the area. Great value for Dublin. Views are not so great (we tried 2 different rooms), but not a big deal as we were not in the room much during the day.",5,2019,04,26

We arrived a few hours before the 3pm check in but this wasn't a problem and we were checked in there and then.  We got the return bus from the airport which stops in Cathal Brugha Street.
The hotel is very secure, you cannot go above floor 2 in the lift without inserting your room key.
Our room was really spacious, had a double and single bed, loads of floor space, a small round table and a desk (with draws) with a chair, a tv with plenty of channels (we watched the England game), a kettle with complimentary tea/coffee etc and a cupboard.  There wasn't a safe but this wasn't a massive problem, we just locked stuff in our case.  The bathroom was also spacious with a shower over the bath and complimentary toiletries.  The room was cleaned everyday.  The view was of a car park which didn't belong to the hotel which wasn't the greatest but we didn't spend much time in the room and there was no disturbance.
The hotel was in a great location, opposite a tesco and on the corner of O'Connell Street, a short walk down to the Liffey and onto Temple Bar.  You could access the Ilac shopping centre off Parnell Street and Henry Street was the next block down where the rest of the high street shops are.
We had all you can eat breakfast included which was great.  Loads of hot and cold cereal to choose from, fresh bread, cakes, hot breakfast and unlimited drinks.  There was a bar in the hotel too but we never went.
The staff were friendly and attentive, we left our luggage there on the last day and went out cause our flight home wasn't until 7pm.
Would definitely stay here again.  Highly recommend.",5,2019,04,23
231,Great stay,"Stayed here for the Easter break, Good Friday to Bank Holiday Monday. Checked in really easily room was clean & spacious (425). However it did overlook an apartment block so not very private for either us or them, which meant closing the curtains regularly. Paid for breakfast every morning which was lovely & had an evening meal there once which was also good. Bar staff were ok, but seem preoccupied on a few occasions with talking & not serving. On checking out they did make an error on the final bill where they charged us twice for breakfast for the 3 days, but they did rectify",4,2019,04,23
231,Brilliant as always,"This is our 3rd visit to the hotel and again ir was faultless. Well positioned, comfortable and great service from checking in to checking out. We will never even look at another hotel in Dublin whilst this one is here.",5,2019,04,21
231,Good value,"Stayed 3 nights. Staff great and room (exec) great also. Price good value compared to competition. Food expensive , but good, although service could be slow, due to lack of bar staff. All round, a great experience, will return",5,2019,04,20
231,Above and Beyond,My husband and I stayed at Jurys Inn to celebrate our honeymoon and the staff went out of their way to make it an exceptional trip. We were more than pleased! The hotel was so clean and the staff was so friendly. ,5,2019,04,18
231,Great service!,Sandro is great! The hotel was clean and breakfast was very good.  I would recommend the hotel to anyone who asks.  Sandro deserves a promotion for all his concerns!  And I hope he receives this as a result of all his efforts.,5,2019,04,18
231,Location on point! ,"Outstanding location for any tourist to Dublin. Easy walking distance to high points of interested. Unfortunately, the beds are rock hard and extremely uncomfortable. 

Breakfast was amazing and great value. Disappointing to be turned away to the bar area when tables are available. 
",4,2019,04,18
231,"Shocking - do not book, you would be lucky to have a room on arrival!","Arrived at this hotel to find that we have been double booked. We were greeted by blank faces of the reception staff, left stranded in reception while the manager plucked up courage to tell us they had double booked all of our rooms, a large group. We were offered to move to another hotel for first night and then back here for second night, we were not willing to spend our two day trip packing and repacking. 
Our booking was made 12 months ago, how can you possibly double book?
We were advised by locals that it is a regular occurrence for this hotel.",1,2019,04,17
231,"Great location , fantastic service","The hotel is in a great location in the centre of Dublin albeit a bit pricey £415 for 2 nights

Breakfast was delicious and great selection",4,2019,04,17
231,Solo stay,"Everything was very nice here: very comfortable bed, pleasant staff, huge breakfast buffet, and comfortable bar. I chose this hotel for it’s location (which worked out great for me) so everything else was just icing on the cake. 
I walked everywhere and felt comfortable/safe the entire time. 
I’d definitely go back.",4,2019,04,16
231,Good location,"The hotel itself is just ok, the bar area is very nice and the staff is super friendly and helpful.  The location is very good, The Kingfisher and Murray's Bar are just a quick walk out the door.   The room could have been a little cleaner, but it was ""ok"".",3,2019,04,16
231,Family stay,"Great value for money, we had a superior package with early check in and late checkout, room was clean, breakfast was lovely, also great location close to all shops but in a quieter part of the city, we will definately stay again",5,2019,04,16

231,Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street,I thought this hotel was great. There were three of us and the hotel stored our luggage for us when we took off to tour Ireland. The location is really good and if you like walking then this is the place for you. The breakfast was good and the hotel clean. We really liked all the staff and the room was sufficient for our needs and spotless.,4,2019,04,15
231,Welcome to Dublin,"First experience of the Jurys Inn and I had expectations.  The bed was comfortable, but the room was small for three of us and I want to feel really welcomed ... and didnt really feel it.  Check in is your chance to really impress and is an area to work on.",3,2019,04,15
231,Perfect location ,"The Jury's Hotel on Parnell Street is a perfect location for the city centre, temple bar and the hop on hop off bus. It took 20 minute taxi drive from the airport and cost 22 euros. It is 10 minute walk to the temple bar area so it is close enough for ease of access but further enough away so you don't get disturbed by noise at night. We walked to most attractions and got the hop on bus to the Guinness factory. The bar here was good although slightly expensive. The breakfast was very good with lots of choice. Rooms are clean and adequate. Bathrooms equipped with large area and grab bars an emergency pull cords. TV, coffee making facilities, iron and board. Highly recommended. ",5,2019,04,14
231,HEN DO RUINED,"arrived Now at this hotel to get here after travelling to be told that our booking ( that we booked 12 months ago) has been double booked !!! and the other booking got here first and have had our rooms!!!! 
They then tried to put us in the sister hotel further away as compensation although hen do was based around the Arlington and the Temple bar !! Obviously by this point the hen was very upset and so were the other 9 member of the bridal party !! Then they we’re saying we could stay one night there and come back here tomorrow night to stay !!! So unpack and then repack to get up early check out there to check in again here !! What an absolute joke !! They finally managed to find 5 available rooms at the Arlington hotel which the manager had to sort and at 22:08 we were offered a free drink at the bar and a free taxi to the Arlington with the Hen already in tears and the night ruined !!!!",1,2019,04,13
231,Good location and very helpful staff,"We had a triple room that was spacious enough for the three of us.  Modern hotel with staff that are eager to please!  We loved the ability to store our luggage while we left Dublin for a few nights to explore the countryside.  The breakfast was complete and plentiful!  The location of the hotel was great for us because we are walkers and were able to get everywhere we needed quickly due to the location on the north side!
We would stay here again for sure!",5,2019,04,12
231,Great Base for Dublin City Break,"Just got back from this lovely, centrally located hotel,  Airport bus (747) drops you just around the corner in O'connell Street. We regularly walked to Temple Bar (20 minute walk), walked to the Guiness Storehouse (40 minute walk), other times we got the ""green"" hop on hop off bus (which you can get every 15 minutes at stops everywhere in the city) Room more than adequate, breakfast lovely,  All staff we encountered, without exception were extremely friendly and helpful and a credit to this hotel,  The trip was for my husband's birthday and we were greeted with balloons in our room, a birthday card, chocolates and a voucher for a glass of prosecco in the bar, the lovely lady in the bar even put strawberries in our fizz!!!  Lovely memorable touch, thank you!",5,2019,04,12
231,Dublin shopping trip with grandaughter,I took my 13 year old grandaughter to Dublin for a shopping trip. We stayed in The Jury's Inn Parnell Street.  I was a super hotel. Centrally located . Extremely helpful staff. Lovely room and very nice supper. I would highly recommend the hotel. ,5,2019,04,11
231,A Fine Stay at an Undistinguished Hotel,"To be fair, I would prefer to rate this Jury’s Inn with either a 3+ or 4- Rating. It is certainly a more than adequate hotel but not in the league with 4 or 5 star properties. As other reviews have stated, the location just a few steps from O’Connell Street, shopping malls, etc makes this a desirable place to stay. It is also only a 2 minute walk to where the Airport Express Bus stops which saves a lot out of pocket expense getting to Dublin Airport. 
The breakfast is varied and good (not great) and my guest room was clean and comfortable. 
I stay at everything from Pensions to 5-Star hotels, and find that they all offer something distinctive. For an average 3-Star property, the Jury’s Inn on Parnell is just fine. I actually can’t find anything to complain about. This is of course kind of a backhanded complement, but it accurately portrays my opinion. ",3,2019,04,10
231,Great stay,"Stayed here for 3 nights for my partners birthday. The rooms were decent size, clean with comfortable beds. We were bed and breakfast and I couldn’t fault it, great choice of cereals, yoghurts, smoothies and cooked breakfast. Location is good, just round the corner from the tour bus stop, not too far from temple bar and there’s some nice bars local to hotel. I enjoyed my stay and if I came back to Dublin I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again.",5,2019,04,10
231,A nice experience,"
Rooms are rather small but clean,very comfortable beds,
Pretty varied breakfast with good quality products, less coffee.
A good espresso would be appreciated in the morning.The fridge and the safe box would be useful in the room.
A long procedure for recovering a sum of money due to a misunderstanding. 
Apart from these small observations, it is a hotel where I will come back with pleasure

",4,2019,04,10
231,Great Moderately Priced Hotel,We were pleasantly surprised by this Jurys Inn property. We booked it because of the location (great location!!) but loved the service and the pleasantness of the staff at the desk and in the restaurant and bar. Great morning breakfast spread -- so much better than a run-of-the-mill American hotel breakfast -- so I'd recommend adding breakfast. We arrived quite early but our room was ready and everything was terrific all the way through the stay.,5,2019,04,08
231,A perfect weekend,"Cannot fault anything about this hotel. Bedrooms, staff, bar, location, reception, comfort, just everything was FAB! 
The breakfast is amazing, something for everyone, fruit, yoghurts, full English, juices, breads, meats, cheeses. 
PERFECT! Thanks a million ",5,2019,04,08
231,Great Birthday stay,"I stayed for 3 nights for my birthday in April 2019. I had a card, balloons and chocolates waiting for my arrival. I was offered breakfast for €11 which I thought was a tad expensive but in comparison to the rest of the city and the food you got was really decent. Full English, cereals, porridge, fruit, yoghurts, smoothies, coffee, tea and fruit juice. The selection and quality was amazing. Rooms were great and had a great sleep each night. Staff were very polite, professional and nothing was too much trouble, even checking in 2 hours early. It is a great location being just off O’Connell Street. There are a Tesco, Aldi, Lidl, McDonald’s, KFC, an IMAX cinema plus lots of cafes and bars all on the street of the hotel. It is just around the corner of where the Aircoach Bus drops you off from Dublin airport at €12 return. This was my second visit in 6 months to Dublin and this hotel and will return again!",5,2019,04,08
231,Visit home,"Staff, food, service, rooms excellent.
Cleaned daily fresh towels, fresh fruit and daily papers.
Breakfast hot, fantastic choice.
Location ideal for traveling throughout the city and central enough to get back to easily",5,2019,04,07
231,3 night stay couple from England,"We chose the Jury’s in for our 3 night stay in Dublin because it was close enough to temple bar to walk to and from but further out enough to not be in the middle of it every night. 
Great experience in arrival from staff. Offers of help to organise taxi and keeping luggage when leaving. We didn’t have breakfast so no comment here but did enjoy a drink in the bar one night. 
Easy 15 mins walk to temple bar and a mix of couples, stags and hen dos, group travel and business people staying in the hotel which was quiet despite being busy. Tesco opposite very handy too",5,2019,04,07
231,Poor customer service,"I am really upset to have to write this review. Overall my actual experience in the jury's inn was good, room was big, clean and service in the hotel from the cleaning staff and bar staff was friendly. However, check in was a mess on the automated service which no one came to assist and then I have asked for points to be added to my jury's membership account for my staff which is being refused as I booked my trip through Expedia. I sent aware that ,y points could therefore not be added! I had signed up especially to be a jury's member and booked this hotel because of good reviews then this happened. I asked if an exception could be made as I was not aware and basically was told no in no certain terms. How disappointing to ruin your review over that. Will be choosing my normal choice of Hilton over jury's now because of this, who are more flexible with their loyal members. ",2,2019,04,07
231,Ireland Trip,Stayed at Jury's Inn in Dublin from 3/19-26.  We had 2 rooms adjoining on the 3rd floor.  Rooms were clean and spacious.  Our view wasn't great but I'm not there to stay in my hotel room.  Breakfast was included with our rooms and was very good with plenty of choices. Hotel staff were very nice and accommodating.  We enjoyed our stay very much and there were plenty of pubs/restaurants within walking distance. I felt the area was very safe and right in the heart of Dublin.  This however was not my first choice of hotels but I couldn't get rooms at the other hotel.  So happy it worked out this way ~ I liked this hotel much better than my original choice.  Would definitely stay with this hotel again.  :),5,2019,04,06
231,City Centre Gem,"Clean,quiet rooms, comfortable beds, nice restaurant  and a great breakfast. Friendly efficient staff and most importantly extremely well located for Dublin city centre meetings or shopping. All around winner.",5,2019,04,06
231,Walking Distance to Major Attractions,"Wonderful modern hotel in a perfect location to walk to most of Dublin's major attractions.  One block from O'Connell Street a major shopping area.  We walked everywhere.

Large comfortable room with king bed & sofa, free wifi and free breakfast buffet.  No room safe but can get safe deposit box at Front Desk.

Thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  If you're traveling to Britain and Ireland, look for a Jurys Inn.  I stayed at Jurys Inn in several cities on my trip --never had a complaint.",5,2019,04,04
231,Great central hotel,"This hotel is in a perfect location for central Dublin and within walking distance of many key attractions.  Despite being near a busy street, it was extremely quiet and the rooms were comfortable and spacious.  There was plenty of choice for breakfast and the staff are happy to provide alternatives if requested.   ",5,2019,04,04
231,Lovely for a visit to Dublin,"Excellent Hotel and in good location. Only a few minutes walk away from restaurants , bars and buses to the rest of the capital. .  Breakfast were wonderful. Could not find anything negative about this hotel at all. ",5,2019,04,03
231,Business Trip,"A one night stay for a Business Trip.  Good hotel just a pity about its location, not a particularly nice area of Dublin, in my opinion.  The hotel, as I said was good, it was when I went out to find somewhere to eat, that I did not feel comfortable walking in the surrounding streets",5,2019,04,03
231,Nice hotel and good location,"Very happy with my stay, and the location is perfect - walking distance to everything and airport busses just around the corner.
Nice breakfast restaurant and cozy bar area, friendly staff and good service.",5,2019,04,03
231,Wonderful stay!,"Very clean hotel, very friendly and knowledgeable personal, great central location! Definitely would stay here again. In fact, we stayed at Jury's Inn Galway and Belfast all in one week! I love their distinctive pleasant air freshener throughout the hotels.",5,2019,04,02
231,Quiet clean and central,"The Jury's In was quiet, clean and central to Edinburgh attractions. An in room fridge would have been handy, but not a big deal. The concrete walls were a plus. The in hotel restaurant was good as well. Helpful staff and a reasonable price. We won't stay again.",4,2019,04,02
231,Wonderful,"The overall stay was wonderful, they watched our bags for us after checkout so we could site see more. The beds were comfortable and the rooms quiet, the food was great and the bar nice and cozy. The only issue we had was the desk booked a tour to the cliffs of moher for us, we paid €30 down and when we showed up for the tour they had no record of us. Upon return of the trip we asked for the money back and had no issues but I recommend the system be updated so this doesnt happen to someone else. Overall the stay was nice and i enjoyed the room.",4,2019,04,02
231,2 x night break in Dublin,"Hotel is centrally located ( Nr  shopping streets like Henry St )  We had a double room  which was   quite. small but  very clean and the bed was  very comfortable .   Only criticism would be that there  was no voile type curtain at the window - so if getting dressed you needed to completely cliose the  blackout curtains and  put the  light on .   Neighbouring. rooms had windows very close overlooking. our room  so   again .. you couldn t have any privacy  without completely closing the curtains . The breakfast had a nice selection  of. hot and cold buffet items .  The hotel is walkable to the Temple Bar  and The Hard Rock Cafe  and  about a 5 min walk from neighbouring  restaurants like Nandos . The Guiniess Storehouse by taxi  to the hotel is approx 10 Euros .  The Aircoach
 airport shuttle stop  is just around the corner ( The Upper O Connell st stop - a few mins walk to the hotel)  
We enjoyed our stay at Jury s Inn Parnell
Street and will probably return .",4,2019,04,01
231,Thin walls,Stayed here over St Paddy's weekend. The walls are super thin.  Our neighbors came in at 11pm and we could hear every word of their conversation till 2am.   Beds are very uncomfortable. they is a rod in the middle of the beds across hitting right smack in the middle of the back.. Breakfast buffet is great.  ,2,2019,04,01
231,Brilliant hotel,"Can't fault the hotel one bit. Just brilliant all round. Close enough to where we wanted to venture and yet not right on top of the hussle and bussle of everything. 
Rooms perfect and clean, restaurant and bar area great and staff were professional and nothing was too much if asked. Thoroughly recommend staying here and we will be back.   ",5,2019,04,01
231,Jurys inn for the win,Good spacious sized rooms nice bar and ideal location for the centre of dublin! We didnt have breakfeast included in our price thats probaly the only downfall i think should be included in every price,5,2019,04,01
231,"Basic room, nothing frwat","We came to Ireland/Scotland for our honeymoon, stayed in 7 different towns - this was the most basic, small room we stayed in. Tiny bathroom, tiny shower. Bed was on wheels which made the pillows fall behind the bed. Breakfast was good, typical selection. It was only like a 10-15 minute walk to Temple Bar neighborhood, which was nice. ",3,2019,04,01
231,Good Choice,"Chose this hotel from TripAdvisor reviews for a quick (one night) stay convenient to sights and transportation.  About a 10 to 15 minute walk to Temple Bar area. 3 minute walk to Air Coach bus to Airport as well as Hop on Hop off stop. Hotel was clean, staff was great/ very helpful.  For the short stay this was perfect.",4,2019,03,31

231,Good value hotel in a central location,"This is a decent hotel situated in the city centre. Rooms are clean but feel cramped. Rooms include all of the essentials you’d expect to find in a city hotel, however, you won’t find any extras in your room. 

On a side note, our bathroom had an unpleasant odour throughout our stay (which was present before we used it). ",4,2019,03,30
231,Great location ,"The location is ideally situation from a tourists view close to the tourist hum.   We were in a executive room, large with a bar fridge, pod coffee maker, everything u need.

231,"Great hotel, good location, friendly staff","We arrived early after an overnight flight and the man at the front desk was able to get us checked in early as we had requested and even had an upgrade for us. The room was very clean and well kept, the food in the morning for breakfast was great and the hotel was close to downtown so it was easy to get around. Can't wait to go back next time I'm in Dublin!",5,2019,03,27
231,Great location and hotel,"I really enjoyed my stay here. The staff is so friendly and helpful. They tentatively took care of every inquiry. 
The rooms are small but what makes up for it are the amenities, including the bar and restaurant on the second floor. Breakfast is great too, with a lot of different options. The breakfast is the perfect start to long tour days. 
Catalina at reception is always so enthusiastic and sweet. She gave us a great recommendation to see the Celtic Nights show at the Arlington Hotel a few blocks away, which was an awesome cherry on top to our stay. You can tell she loves and job and knows the area well. ",5,2019,03,27
231,Not a Four Star Hotel,"This hotel was a disappointment related to the amount I paid to stay there. It needs a remodel , the linens and towels were worn and not of good quality. The carpet in the halls was very dingy . It is a 3 star with a 4 star location. ",3,2019,03,26
231,"Excellent location, great staff","Parnell St is handy for most of Dublins daytime and nightime pursuits. The hotel was super clean, lovely helpful staff. Good bar where women can feel comfortable. Free fruit! Iced water on tap. Blackout curtains for a great lie-in. Altogether a lovely hotel. 
Could do with extractors and toilet brushes in the bathrooms but apart from that nothing to fault. ",4,2019,03,26
231,Amazing 21st!,"Took my boyfriend to Dublin for his 21st. In the hotel, I did mentioned in the comment box, that it was for 21st so walked into a room of balloons, chocolates, card and Prosecco. Great touch! Room was amazing, so big at the very end of the hotel so only one room beside us. Location was great, easily accessible to everything in dublin. Hotel bar was great and a pub over the road did breakfast (quite cheap) so was overall one of the best hotels we have stayed in.",5,2019,03,26
231,Glasgow minister,"The hotel reception was welcoming and the staff pleasant and helpful.    I liked the security of access to guest only areas.     The room was comfortable and serviced daily with tea and coffee facilities: access to wifi.

231,Great hotel in a great location,What a great hotel in a great location for all what you need to do especially for shopping and Temple bar. Very good location for transfer to the airport and hop on and off bus. I hadpaid far more for other hotels and not got this standard,5,2019,03,26

231,Comfort Stay.  Excellent Location.,The hotel was comfortable and in an excellent location for our purposes.  Excellent breakfast.  We arrived early and the staff was able to check us on immediately which was welcome nrws after a transatlantic flight.  We were assigned a room which was larger than what we had booked so were very happy about that.  The room dif have some heating issues  but stsff arranged for a space heater which solved the problem.  Also the toilet started leaking during our last night.  It was a minor leak but reported it right away.  Staff made arrangements to get it repaired the next day.,4,2019,03,25
231,st.patrick day 2019,Good location for parade 1 block away. Was able to get into at least one of our rooms early to that was really important to us.  Got a quick nap then hit the streets of Dublin. Nice bar on the second floor for a late night drink,5,2019,03,24
231,Brilliant Location,"My friend and I stayed here for St Patrick’s Day. Its perfectly located near the high street & temple bar is just a short walk away. The only negative is that for the price we paid, we’d have expected breakfast included. ",5,2019,03,24
231,Location,"We were on the same floor as the bar and restaurant--so this could colour my review. 

Location -- it is in the heart of Dublin and had the best accommodation for the price. Walk to everything.

Opposite is a great breakfast place. (I seem to remember the breakfast at the hotel being a bit expensive?!)  Beside is a good pub--we didn't particularly like the ""vibe"" of the hotel bar...too hotel and not enough pub for OUR liking.

The central location attracts those on the ""tear"".  We had a bridal party on our floor.  This is not the hotel's fault.  I asked the women - who were rushing in and out of each other's rooms, slamming doors and yelling to each other--to be quiet, but I was shocked by what one of them said to me. So I contacted reception.  However, the girls had gone by the time the security guy came up.  Luckily, the ladies didn't come home late and make a noise.  Mind you, I was prepared and had my noise cancelling headphones on :).  I realise they were just having a good time and I was probably cranky after a long flight. 

So basically, the walls are a wee bit thin.

The room was large with a sofa and a comfy chair.  Loads of tea and coffee things.  It was clean and comfortable with basic toiletries.  That sounds worse than I mean it to. Overall, the best for the price but nothing ""special"" if that's what you are looking for. 

Dublin is a party town...anyone wandering around Temple Bar at 12am on a Saturday night will attest to that. 

Still bearing in mind that I'm a fussy older client, I would stay here again. 

The staff were most courteous and attentive. They responded quickly.",4,2019,03,24
231,Ireland trip,"I picked this hotel be cause I was mainly going to be sleeping there not because of my booked activities,  the beds the rooms the bathrooms were all very clean and comfortable , staff was very friendly and helpful with wake up calls , answering questions and getting cabs scheduled . 
If I were doing more of  lounging type vacation I would most likely try to choose a hotel with more of a party bar than a chill out bar and possibly larger rooms outside activities but that's mainly because I'm used to south American beach resorts for my vacations and that's how those work ",4,2019,03,23
231,Stay at Jurys Inn Dublin,"The hotel is very central and easy to find. You are near everything. The reception area is nice, the rooms are very clean, the beds comfortable. There is a bar and restaurant on the second floor. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. I stayed with my teenage daughter, we were at the Drake concert and I found the price 119 euro was a good price considering its Dublin and the location. I would definitely recommend!",5,2019,03,22
231,Brilliant,"Very happy with with our stay we will definitely remember our experience, it was walking distance away from all the of the attractions and trams to get everywhere, we will definitely return back to here next year ",5,2019,03,21
231,Basic but a little expensive,"As you walk into the foyer which is spacious and clean; there seems to be a few shady looking people watching everything that's going on and I don't mean staff. ( I have noticed this on my three visits over the past year). The rooms are small but clean. The bar and restaurant are on the second floor with access via a lift. Any other floor access requires your room card. The food in the bar/restaurant is average, nothing exciting and has been between warn and almost hot!! Price for fish(which was mainly batter) and chips €18.00. When the ""bar manager"" came around and asked me if the food was alright and I replied ""poor"" he just said ""OK"" and walked away. Obivously did'nt hear or care what I said.
The breakfast is self service and unless you're lucky enough to arrive at the same time as the fry is displayed, it will be warm to cold!! As work pays for the accomadation there I would'nt stay.",3,2019,03,20
231,Fabulous Dublin,"Stayed here with my wife for 2 nights on a 3 day city break. Great hotel we had a lovely room with good facilities.

231,City centre convenience for a reasonable cost.,"I stayed here on a Sunday night. Parking is very close by and a very reasonable rate for overnight parking. The hotel reception staff were friendly and efficient. The room was very clean and comfortable. There was a problem with the air conditioning in the room. A call to reception  ensured the matter was promptly fixed by a very polite member of staff who replaced the keyboard.
The hotel breakfast was comprehensive and well presented. 
All the main sights in the city are within a walking distance. Including Dublin Castle, Stephens Green , Temple Bar, The National Art Gallery and Trinity College to name but a few.I would definitely reccommend this hotel.",4,2019,03,19
231,Great Location,"The Inn is well-traveled but clean and has all you need for a Dublin stay.

231,St Patrick’s weekend,Had a great time but too expensive. The hotel put the price up for St Patrick’s weekend. They charged us £675.50 for a double room with breakfast for 2 nights which works out £168 per person per night.  Will book some where different to stay next year,4,2019,03,19

231,Fabulous Stay 🍀,"Just got back from our very first trip to Dublin! First I will start with save a few dollars and take a 7 euro PP Airlink bus to this hotel rather than a taxi! It will drop you off one block from the hotel. We arrived at 7am after taking a Red eye flight exhausted and they let us check in! The hotel security is very good and I felt very safe here. You cannot get to any of the floors on the elevator without a key card! The main doors are locked in the evening and front staff will buzz you in. Not a problem as I never saw the front desk without at least one person on. 
The front desk is a wonderful resource for directions and recommendations for restaurants. Favorite restaurant and only a 2 minute walk was Murray’s on the corner! Great food, live music everyday and Irish step dancers come on at 9:30pm(not sure if they do that every night). The beds are super comfortable only complaint was no cover sheet! We never heard any other guests, the rooms are well insulated. Very clean and maids came everyday! I did not care for the in room shampoo- but thankfully I brought some of my own. Location of this hotel was great taxis are parked right outside front door and buses and tram are right at the corner. We went down to the temple bar area at night it can get crowded and crazy there! Glad our hotel was not in that immediate vicinity. Very loud!  Took us approximately 15 minute walk back to hotel from temple bar area! 
Do be sure to visit some of the smaller pubs I love that they have musicians come in and play live Irish music sitting in their little circle right at the tables. Palace bar -upstairs where they have over 100 whiskey’s was our favorite take! 
We purchased some Irish whiskey to take home from the Irish whiskey museum only to find it a lot cheaper at the duty free in the airport before we left to come home! But we did a tasting there and that was a lot of fun. Even better was at Jameson and the bar there was fantastic after! 
To conclude we had an unforgettable visit and felt very welcomed by the people there. This is a city with a lot of history and we learned a lot about their culture. 
Dublin I’ll never forget You ❤️",5,2019,03,15
231,"Excellent all round accommodation, food and attentive staff.","Stayed at Jurys Inn, Parnel Square for short midweek stay. Very conveniently located as base for exploring.

231,"Great location, accommodating staff.","Arriving at the hotel in the early morning (well before our anticipated check in) we were greeted promptly, and upon explaining we were battling a migraine, extra steps were taken to assist us in finding a quiet place to wait, and then being told they had a room made available for us to recover.  Rooms were clean, quiet, and just right for a simple stay.",5,2019,03,10

231,Quiet and clean sanctuary for a great nights sleep in a busy city,"I have travelled to Dublin for work a few times and have struggled to find an affordable hotel that is central and above all, nice to stay in.

This Jury’s is lovely. My second stay there this week. Reception staff were very polite and friendly; the rooms are compact but clean and have all the things you need including an iron and ironing board (how boring, but I was working!)

Great breakfast buffet. I expect I will be there again! Thanks. ",5,2019,03,09

231,Jurys Inn hotel in Dublin,"Very comfortable hotel and well located, in the centre of Dublin. Great offer together with the flight. Very comfortable bed and very quiet room. I would have preferred that the room had a shower instead of a bath. I would go back again.",5,2019,03,05
231,A go to hotel,"Myself and two friends stayed for three nights. Effortless check in and out and great rooms. Had everything we needed. Situated about a 10 min walk to the centre of Dublin, it's well located for a weekend break. The breakfast was brilliant, lots of options! There is a tesco conveniently located across the road and loads of places to eat. Very easy to get to from the airport by bus. Would recommend and stay again.",5,2019,03,04
231,Very friendly and helpful staff,"I stayed here on a work trip. I arrived very early, but was checked very olitely without any question. The room was large and clean and equipped with everything I could have needed. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was well maintained with a good shower. The only problem I had was trying to get the air conditioning onto a warmer setting - but that may have been my incompetence. I had a good evening meal in the bar with very quick and pleasant service and an excellent breakfast. The hotel is very convenient for the centre and near an airport coach stop. ",4,2019,03,04
231,Good business hotel,"Reception was quick and friendly. Rooms were standard business type rooms. 
Bathroom fine but bit basic. Breakfast was good although some mushrooms would have been good for those that are vegetarian but want a cooked breakfast.",4,2019,03,04
231,Good location,"Hotel in good location just off O Connell Street and close to bars and restaurants. Excellent breakfast with a choice of fresh food, Double Rooms have plenty of space and are clean and good finish. Tripple rooms not so much room. Friendly staff on the desk and at the restaurant. Good value overall",5,2019,03,04
231,Quick trip to Dublin!,Jury's Inn was in a perfect location! About a 10 minute walk to Temple Bar. Everything was in walking distance.The room and lobby were very nice as well. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin! ,5,2019,03,04
231,"Tasty breakfast, excellent location but bit worn out","We had a great time, location is great, breakfast was really good and bonus points for actually working and fast wifi.

The room was clean but bit worn out. True to Irish/English standards the shower and sink are horrible to use.",4,2019,03,04
231,Adequate,"Worst bar service I have ever experienced anywhere in the world. One little kid left to manage a very busy bar on his own with no help. Queues of people waiting to order or pay bills while the poor kid was making cocktails or running to the kitchen for fresh ice. Its not his fault, he did his best. Its extremely bad management.

Also, for €109 per night a breakfast would have been nice. My friends stayed for the weekend and breakfast was included. Very poor form. I only stayed because my friends were staying there. The Gresham was cheaper that night and included breakfast.",3,2019,03,04
231,Couple of days away,"Jury’s inn hotel I could not fault.All staff very helpful,even printed our boarding passes off,for our flight.Breakfadt was lovely and this hotel is in the central for bars etc.Would recommend to anybody going to Dublin that wants a good clean hotel.",5,2019,03,03
231,Ideal location for visiting Dublin,"We've just returned from a very enjoyable, and slightly tipsy, 3 night break at the Jury's Inn on Parnell Street.  The staff are very friendly, from the reception, through to those in the restaurant serving breakfast right through to the bar, and no forgetting the hard work carried out daily by the maids.  It's definitely one of the most comfortablist hotels we've stayed at for a while and I would highly recommend a visit to the Parnell Heritage & Grill.  We plan to visit again very soon.",4,2019,03,02
231,Comfortable,"Stayed here for two nights but didn't have breakfast as we prefer to eat out when visiting places. 

Check in was welcoming and we arrived to find a comfortable sized room with all the amenities we needed.

The hotel itself was just round the corner from O'Connell Street and only 10 minute walk to a main shopping centre and temple bar. Tesco express across the road for any essentials you'd need.

Comfortable bed and a good place to stay in Dublin. ",4,2019,03,02
231,"Very good option in downtown Dublin, we were very happy here","loved our stay here, it was one night but it was the perfect place for our first day in Ireland, incredible breakfast, nice staff, good location, nicely sized room and comfortable beds; we were jetlagged and in good company in their lobby early in the morning, it's a spacious nice lobby so perfect after a redeye, we went to a fun breakfast spot about a 10 minute walk toward downtown (Lemon Jelly Cafe) near the hotel our first day, had dinner at the restaurant directly across the street, liked that a big Tesco was also right across the street - and otherwise enjoyed exploring the area.  Good value for a Sunday night stay.  We would happily stay here again.  That said - I would have preferred to stay closer to Temple Bar and the heart of everything BUT this location was more than fine.  We stayed only our first night in Dublin, because the night before our flight out of Ireland, the price tripled (I think all of Dublin got pricy for that late February weekend), so we had to stay elsewhere for budget reasons.  The Sunday night rate we got in mid-February was fine but I suspect sometimes the price will be too high for us, depending on events in Dublin.",5,2019,03,02
231,A short trip to Dublin,Jurys Inn is located in the perfect location for Dublin sight seeing!  There is a magnificent book shop across the road.  Luas & Buses all run nearby.   Nice breakfast and lovely rooms.  Nice bed. Quiet.  2nd floor near everything.  ,5,2019,03,01
231,Good location to explore city from,"We had a pleasant quiet room on the 5th floor. The location is very central so we were able to walk everywhere we visited. 
Breakfast seemed good value with some vegan options and was kept full.
Only criticism is the room didn’t have a safe: I think there is a facility at the front desk. ",4,2019,03,01
231,Dublin weekend ,"Thought the hotel was pretty good and clean,the staff were really friendly nothing too much trouble and the bar prices reasonable (bearing in mind it’s an expensive city particularly temple bar) would stay again easily,also the bath in my room was fairly low and easy to climb into with grab handles and being disabled found this excellent plus the bottom of the bath had a built in non skid surface all in all recommended. ",4,2019,02,27
231,Fab stay,"Hotel heart of Dublin very quiet no noise and staff very helpful would recommend, breakfast was lovely and beds were very comfy , bathrooms were spotless actually smelled the bleach as soon as opened door",5,2019,02,26

231,Perfect Location off of O'Connell St,"The Jurys Inn was situated in a perfect location - being within walking distance to all the popular tourist sights! O'Connell Street was only a minutes walking distance, a 13 minute walk to Temple Bar and a 30 minute walk to the Guinness Storehouse.

The room was a very good size, considering it is in the centre of the city. The staff were also incredibly welcoming. 

I would definitely return here in the future!",5,2019,02,23

Close to everything you would want in Dublin 
Free WiFi and hotel will store your bag if you arrive early or when you check out 
Would highly recommend this hotel",5,2019,02,22
231,Hotel below Average,"the hotel was average to below. Dublin seems to be stretched to capacity and as a consequence hotels seem to not be stepping upto the mark as the demand outstrips the supply, but it is a city that feels like it is at Tipping point for infrastructure failure which you feel in the hotels in terms of quality.",2,2019,02,22
231,Dublin stay,"The value for money was below my expectations but the location is great, I will not go back to this hotel and will not recommend it to my friends, but the staff servicing the rooms was kind and the city very exciting ",2,2019,02,22
231,Good value hotel with good service,"Really nice hotel with excellent friendly helpful staff. Feels a bit more than the usual chain standard hotel. Located on the north side so a bit of a walk from most of the stuff south of the river but that was ok for us, you can always get a tram/taxi. Rooms of a good standard and the hotel has a really nice bar on the 2nd floor that  unlike most of Dublin its not too expensive. Free 24 hour wifi too!",4,2019,02,22
231,Stay at Jury's Inn,"Had a lovely break, lovely relaxed hotel, lovely staff and a great location, very clean and breakfast very good. Car park across the road linked to the hotel as well, you come out the front door and you are in the middle of the whole city.",5,2019,02,21

231,Very good service,We booked from two different countries and where placed att two different hotels of the same group. The manager on duty lost the problem and rebooked one part of our groupe! The hotel was like you can expect. Nice position just on the side of the centre.,5,2019,02,20
231,DUBLIN TRIP,"Great stay, very helpful staff from start to finish just what you want from a 2 night stay no issues(1 little thing extra bar staff at busy times) would I stop there again yes! and and says it all....",5,2019,02,19
231,Weekend stay to take in a show,"Excellent hotel with friendly staff and great breakfast. Late bar snack with a few drinks was great on arrival. Front page information confirmed parking available, but it was only on arrival I learnt this was at a third party's property and would require additional fee. This was reduced by Jurys but was till Eur28. Would have preferred to know this up front. Excellent location for all Dublin sight seeing.",5,2019,02,18
231,The hotel was anything but a Happy Place once you turned on either the hot tap or shower. We’d been better off using a W,The communication in this hotel is non existent. You get more water from a Watering Can than the shower in room 515. This experienced put a distinct damper on an otherwise outstanding weekend stay in Dublin.,1,2019,02,18
231,"Great place, good value.",Very close to center. No need for public transportation. Great clean rooms. Very kind stuff. Quiet at night. Good restaurant with very good breakfast and good choice for dinner.This hotel made my first time in Dublin great. ,5,2019,02,18
231,Great Stay but Parking is a Hassle,"Jurys Inn Parnell Street is a great hotel in a central location, but the parking is a bit of a hassle.

My wife and I stayed at Jurys Inn for a couple of nights. We drove in from Belfast, so we had to deal with the frustrations of Dublin traffic when we arrived. The parking for the hotel is in a shared garage a block or two away which my wife and I had a difficult time finding. We ended up looping around the area several times before finally stumbling upon it. The whole process added quite a bit of time to our check-in.

That being said, the location is great. The hotel is near historic O’Connell Street, River Liffey, Trinity College, and all the other sites central to the city. It’s truly fantastic to be able to walk from one sightseeing spot to another while still being close enough to the hotel to drop off souvenirs and leftovers or turn in for the evening.

The rooms are clean, comfortable, have with plenty of room, and includes a refreshing air conditioning unit. Additionally, the staff is friendly, helpful, and accommodating.

Overall, I would highly recommend Jurys Inn Parnell Street. Given the central location, I don’t think much can be done about the parking, but just set your expectations that it’s going to be a bit of a pain if you’re driving in.",4,2019,02,17
231,Grand,Enjoyable. Great location. My review has to be 200 minimum so I am using them up writing this. I had a good night sleep. Check out was very easy. They kept my bag the following day as I toured around the place.,4,2019,02,16

231,Great location,"Good value for money, double room is a bit small but its enough. Breakfast was good, definitely add on with booking as its much cheaper than the 12 Euros if you book when you arrive. Central location and easy to get the bus from the airport. The main negative is the noisy lorry's/bin men outside and you can hear all noise from the corridor. All in all good value for money",4,2019,02,13
231,Top Hotel,"Second Visit to this Hotel. Popped over to Dublin for a short break to celebrate my Birthday. Late check in due to Flight time, but Room was readily available and had modern decor and furnishings. Receptionist was excellent and check-in was fast.

Will definitely return.",5,2019,02,13
231,A few issues but rectified well,"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights in this hotel, the food and service was super, and the location was excellent, we had a couple of issues, door lock was broken and the really rowdy group of people next to and opposite our room (knocking on our door after midnight) was less than ideal, but the hotel staff dealt with it well and compensated us for the trouble. I would say this hotel is a good 3* not 4*",4,2019,02,12
231,Great location.,"Great location, 10 minutes walk to Grattan Street, Temple bar area and Dame street, clean and tidy, very pleasant helpful staff, well stocked bar great breakfast.

231,"Good hotel, but noisy.","Good hotel in busy part of Dublin. Parking as I found out was difficult and expensive. Friendly greeting at reception and room was of the usual standard. However the room overlooked what looked like a tip/refuse collection facility and the noise was incredibly loud all night. Pillows very uncomfortable in the room, too big to use 2 and too small to only use 1, but that's my personal preference. Bar area was excellent as were the staff. Ate out first night and in the bar the second. Wasn't impressed by the burger I had, very dry and tasteless.

There was quite alot of variety and selection of breakfast foods in an equally pleasant surroundings..the bedroom was clean light and airy...yes I would stay there again. ,5,2019,02,06
231,City break.,Hotel is very convenient to bus stop in Parnell square for people from Donegal visiting the capital. Close to centre and shopping. Luas is close by which is a hassle free way to travel. Foyer is more like a waiting room than a reception area but staff are friendly and helpful. ,4,2019,02,05
231,Bad experience in Jury's inn,Call several time reception but nobody picked the phone. All night my family couldn't sleep because next room guests were noisy. I don't know any manager come for round check or not Its disappointing. ,2,2019,02,05
231,Very good,When booking it said the hotel had parking facilities but when we arrived we had to park a bit away from the hotel and then pay to keep the car there overnight. Other than that great location and hotel.,5,2019,02,05
231,Dublin,Central location.Good amenities. Friendly staff. Very clean and secure location. Have been here a few times and we always come back. Lots to do beside the hotel close to shopping and historical areas.,5,2019,02,04
231,Dublin Stay,"Enjoyed my mini-vacay in Dublin. Jury's Hotel was very conveniently located in city center. Only thing I would have requested, was not to have a room facing the street. Busy street and late night revelers! ",4,2019,02,03

231,Loved This Hotel,"Loved this hotel! Couldn't fault a thing, modern, clean, staff very efficient and helpful. The breakfast was great with loads of choice. Rooms lovely, beds comfy, even left us Diet Coke and Kitkats in the fridge and bottled water. Bus from the airport stopped just around the corner which was handy, only cost €7. Location good and about 10-15min walk to Temple Bar, would defo stay again if returning to Dublin.",5,2019,02,02
231,no problems,"my birthday trip away . warm greeting  helped us with information through out our stay . in a good location we found. the rooms are typical jury's. bed okay room fine . clean bathroom . hot water no issues with that . 
the breakfast was typical buffet .  started the day off okay on that .  i didn't have any problem with this hotel .",4,2019,01,31
231,Ripoff,"They overcharged for the room, the soap and shampoo were all watered down, they offered laundry on the website but don't tell you they charged exorbitantly for doing it and won't allow you to do your own.  They tried to charge us a fortune for dinner which would have been the equivalent of $200 US for two people!",2,2019,01,30
231,Cardbaord thick walls and next to a rubbish collecting facility - NOISY,"Walls very thin and we had issues with young girls in the room next to us. called security and they did nothing. didn't sleep at all the last night. Also, was placed in a room next to a rubbish collection facility which was very noisy. Room was very hot and couldn't adjust the temperature, so we had to either leave the window closed due to the noise outside or opened due to the room temperature. We didn't ask to change rooms because I was told when we checked in that the hotel was full. For the extra cost, I would have stayed at the other Jurtys in by Christ Church.",2,2019,01,29
231,Visit to Jurys Inn - Parnell Street Dublin,this hotel was very average and not good value for money.  For a Jurys Inn in city centre - not up to expectations.  The room was average size and had no view and no fridge.    I have stayed in many Jurys Inns all over the country - and booked this one because of location - and was disappointed.,3,2019,01,29
231,Long Weekend in Dublin,"Having never been to Dublin before I was unsure what area to book in and chose Jurys in Parnell Street. Turned out to be a great location and a short walk to the other side of the river. Would recommend this laid back hotel. Paid a little extra per night for an upgrade which was well worth the small charge, impressed with all the staff and a great 2nd floor bar with again, very nice staff.",5,2019,01,29
231,Great place to stay,"Very helpful and friendly staff. The location was great, close to shops and restaurants. Rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. Breakfast in the morning was great. Same day dry cleaning was also nice. ",5,2019,01,28
231,An Chead Dail Visit,"We stayed for 2 nights and because of its central location we were able to visit Glasnevin, Dublin Castle and the film ""Mary Queen Of Scots"". The room was warm, quiet and a good size. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the choice of food at breakfast was excellent.",5,2019,01,28
231,All staff very helpful and friendly,All staff were very helpful and friendly the rooms were very clean and the beds were so comfortable we were up for one night for the trad fest we were so close to everything and the price for one night was 109 Euro which was reasonable for where hotel is situated ,5,2019,01,28
231,Great Hotel in the heart of Dublin!,Spent 3 nights at Jurys Inn and it was very enjoyable. The room was large and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was clean and good sized. The entire staff was gracious and very helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a reasonably priced hotel in Dublin.,5,2019,01,28
231,Concert stay,"Really enjoyed my time in Jury's Parnell St, the staff were exceptionally friendly and welcoming. The room was very clean, bed was comfy and there was a good selection for breakfast.The only thing i would suggest is that the temperature be set lower in the room. A card advises keeping the temp between 18-21 degrees to conserve energy but was set to 25 degrees initially but a very small point!",5,2019,01,28
231,Overall a good experience,"The hotel isncentrally located in Dublin. No matter what we had planned for the day, the things we were going to do were only 15 minutes away. Aldi was two.stores up from us (2 min walk), the mall was a 2 min walk, the bus stop to get back to the airport was less than a 10 min walk, a tour agency was less than a 10 min walk, distilleries, pubs, etc were all less than 15 min away. Safe area. We were out late and had no issues at all. There is staff thar mans the entryway door. Staff is friendly. Overall, good experience.",4,2019,01,27
231,Stay away from room 244,"no sleep, room was surrounded by noise throughout the night. this was my second time being put in this room, but management dont seem to care about the feedback they are given. I know that I was not the first complaint regarding room 244 but yet its ignored. location excellent, breakfast amazing though",3,2019,01,27
231,Excellent experience,"Jurys Inn went above and beyond for my sisters birthday. The staff where extremely friendly and helpfully. Very comfortable beds, clean and spacious room.Overall very enjoyable stay and would highly recommend a stay here",5,2019,01,24
231,Lovely two night stay,"Spent two nights here in Dublin. Hotel was well situated. Walking distance to all tourist attractions and just round the corner from bus and tram stops. Bus from airport stopped 5 minutes walk away. Very nice room, restaurant and bar. Breakfast was great! Lots of choice including multiple gluten free options. Staff all very friendly and helpful. All in all a great stay! Will definitely be recommending to anyone heading in this direction.",5,2019,01,24
231,Avery happy expierence with overnight stay to celebrate grandaughters birthday,"A very central hotel to stay to explore all Dublin has to offer.A few minutes walk to wax museme,leprecaun museme,and the historical GPO.not forgetting all the shopping plus numerous other places of interest to visit.My grandaughter was made to feel so special during our stay as she celebrated her birthdaywhen her desert plate arrived all decorated with her name inscribed on it.Wonderful staff and so cheerful .A most enjoyable stay was had by allWill certainly  stay again.",5,2019,01,23
231,One night stand,"Very good but a short stay,  location is very good and staff are friendly. Good bar and rooms are clean and nice. Next time i will stay at this hotel again, defently for a longer time than 1 night. Food times",4,2019,01,23
231,Amazing stay !,"First time going to this hotel and before we traveled I emailed the hotel letting them know it was my partners birthday. They emailed back saying they will upgrade our room to a superior room. When we arrived our room was not ready, however they gave us free drinks at the bar and we only had to wait a short while for our room. once we went inside there was a card and chocolates left for us, which was a lovely touch.

Dafydd was exceptional and really made our stay amazing. All the staff were very friendly and the room was beautiful with a huge bed. Barely any noise also considering its excellent location. Will definitely be back soon!",5,2019,01,23
231,Surprise surprise,"Booked and pre paid at a rock bottom price of €88 which included a very good breakfast. Check in time is 4pm. No queue at reception. Warm welcome from the young lady. Precise instructions about room location, WiFi etc. Room had a double and a single bed. We had requested a quiet room and certainly got It, right at the back, away from the city centre traffic noise.Perfectly equipped with a kettle, mugs, choice of teas and coffees  proper full size steam iron and ironing board, full size hairdryer . Comfortable and clean.Beds were the essence of comfort as we found out later on. Basic bathroom with bath and decent shower over bath. Large fluffy towels. Soap and shower gel.is of the type from a dispenser. Bring your own shower cap.Heating/cooling is via overhead fan with control switch in the wall.Drinks in the bar later were served by a most obliging young barman.Breakfast next morning was buffet style and a very busy dining room had lots of staff on duty. Excellent breakfast, free newspaper. Honestly , as a hotel bang in the city centre we thought "" captive audience.  Won't be up to much as it will always be full and they wont have to try"". Surprise surprise . We were wrong. Check out was just as friendly and efficient as check in....with an offer of help with bags and if we required a taxi. Would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2019,01,23
231,Fantastic stay!,It’s the 3rd time I’ve stayed at this hotel and we had another fantastic stay. It’s a great location in the centre of Dublin. Close enough to the main attractions but also not right in the centre of the noise and craziness of Temple Bar. Staff are friendly and accommodating. We were there for a friends 40th and they gave us complimentary drinks and had balloons and a card in the room on our arrival. A lovely touch. Breakfast is great and the hotel overall is spacious and clean. It’s my Dublin go to hotel and I’d highly recommend it. ,5,2019,01,22
231,January overnight superior,We have used Parnell Street on several occasions and as usual the staff are very polite and helpful.  Room very pleasant and good food in restaurant.  All in all a very pleasant overnight. Will definitely recommend and use again when in Dublin.,5,2019,01,22
231,Really comfy beds,I stayed in a twin room with my friend. The room was very spacious for such a central location. The beds were really comfortable and the room was very clean. The location was great with bus stops for the airport and tourist buses round the corner.,5,2019,01,22
231,Friends annual reunion,An excellent centrally situated hotel. The staff are friendly & very helpful. The rooms are average sized but clean with a decent bathroom. Breakfast good. We visit this hotel each January & will continue to do so as a group. Each of us would also use this hotel if back in Dublin for a visit. ,5,2019,01,22
231,Mid Week Break,All was great except room temperature. Would stay here again - great location close to all the sights everything within walking distance from hotel.Reception very pleasant and rooms clean and tidy.Great value,4,2019,01,22
231,Excellent hotel,"Lovely hotel in a good location for the city centre.Helpful staff, lovely rooms and a good atmosphere in the hotel bar in the evenings and the prices were reasonable too.  Bed was extremely comfortable.",5,2019,01,22
231,Walking distance to so many places.,"Just a few minutes walk from the aircoach bus stop.That is outside Murray's, good for Irish music and dance. We were able to walk to Temple Bar , Grafton Street and Trinity College. The hotel is clean , modern and the service was excellent. Breakfast was enjoyed.Some rooms facing the Street are noisier as you would expect , but it did quieten down on a January night. ",5,2019,01,20
231,Terrible,"We arrived late in the evening, and there was no one at the door.   The receptionist was patronizing and unpleasant (so unlike most Irish people!).  The parking was far away, and we were given incorrect directions to it.  There is also no in and out privileges at the car park if you want the discount.  The ice machine didn’t work, and when I went down to the bar to get some ice there was no bartender in the room for 10 minutes.  The only soap was a squeeze bottle on the wall not reachable from the bathtub.  Also, a very busy and unattractive street.  The only good thing was a comfortable bed, otherwise, awful.",1,2019,01,20
231,Nice stay,"A really good location. My husband and I were going to a concert at the Olympia Theatre which was only a few minutes walk .   Hotel comfortable . Didn't get a great welcome tho, the guy on the desk just said 'Checking in? Then after getting our door card he said 'The lift is over there' . Not a lot of conversation.  The view out of our window wasn't great, looking over at apartments ( not the end of the world tho).  Breakfast next day was pretty good . Before we left we decided to have a coffee in the bar, took I am sure from ordering to receiving approx. 10mins. ",4,2019,01,19
231,Great accommodation at a great location!!,This accommodation was very spacious for my daughter and I and we were very pleased with everything about it!!  The location was super fantastic as it was extremely close to many supermarkets and the main shopping district!!!  Will definitely stay here again.  The only regret is that I didn't get to spend more time here to enjoy it!!!,5,2019,01,18
231,Good location,"Very central, lovely room, great bed, fifth floor was very quiet. Excellent value as we stayed mid week. Didn't have breakfast, too expensive, lovely coffee shops very nearby offering breakfast for a quarter of the price.",5,2019,01,18
231,"Amazing few days in Dublin,","Took my 80yr old Mum to Dublin as a Christmas gift from my sister and I as she had never been and wanted to see it, she had a great time and was very impressed with the cleanliness and friendliness, our Hotel (Jury’s) was fantastic right in the heart of everything and very clean and friendly helpful staff, food was very good to from breakfast to lunch and dinner. We had a great time and would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2019,01,18
231,Excellent comfortable hotel,"The hotel is excellent - clean, comfortable, modern, great breakfast and very helpful and friendly staff. It is also very conveniently located in the centre of the norhside of the city centre. The only negative is that the area is a little 'rough' - so care needs to be taken if walking to and from the hotel at night, particularly  if traveling alone.",5,2019,01,17
231,Mrs,My daughter booked my stay at the hotel for my 60th birthday and the staff made our stay that little bit more special by the little things they did for example upgrading our room and leaving a birthday card and balloons in our room along with a voucher for a complimentary drink in the bar,5,2019,01,17
231,Great family Dublin trip,"We had a great stay at the hotel, food was great, and it was central to all the night life. The bar /restaurant on floor 2,is well set out and the staff are friendly and welcoming.The beds are really comfortable and quiet, great nights sleep. ",5,2019,01,17
231,One overnight stay in Dublin to facilitate shopping next day,The stay was fine for the stated purpose. Proximity to shops is excellent. Travelling by car presents significant problems. Maybe a carpark closer and more accessible from the hotel would prove of benefit.,3,2019,01,16
231,Jury’s inn Dublin,Jurys inn is a good quality hotel for short or long stays in Dublin. Some times the price can be expensive but if you check before you book you can get a reasonable priced stay. The menu in the bar/restaurant can be a little boring if staying for a long time but plenty of places in Dublin to eat,5,2019,01,16
231,Great location in central dublin,"I stayed here one night with my husband and found the location brilliant for shopping. It's within minutes of 3 different shopping centres as well as numerous individual shops and supermarkets. 

The room was adequate, it was big enough for 3 people but only had one chair to sit on so we had to ask for another one. The bathroom could do with an update, the grout had black marks on and the shower curtain was really wobbly. But on the plus there are large bottles of toiletries which was nice.

The breakfast was disappointing though .....There was a limited choice of hot food and pastries but what was there was nice.",4,2019,01,16
231,Return stay to Jury's Inn Dublin,"This hotel is both centrally located, has friendly helpful staff, provides an excellent breakfast ….all of this whilst being cost effective against other similar hotels in Dublin. This was our return visit to Dublin this January following a similar visit in January 18 and although we would not normally have  stayed at the same hotel/location on a return visit, the Jury's Inn in Parnell Street ticked all the boxes and yet again delivered a very enjoyable stay.",5,2019,01,16
231,Jurys Hell,"I would never recommend this hotel to anyone, was not greeted by anyone from Dublin majority of staff were from overseas with poor English. Rooms were not cleaned nor beds changed for the 10 days we stayed there, all was done was clean towels and  tea and coffee replaced, I had to run around chasing tissues and toilet rolls from the cleaning cart, It was an experience I do not wish to repeat, with a big name like Jurys I was expecting much more, well just a clean bed and room would have been nice.",1,2019,01,15
231,A great weekend spent in Dublin,"A return trip to Dublin. Stayed again in Jury’s Hotel Parnell Street, this time with another 14 family and friends to celebrate my 60th birthday.  We had an excellent stay again and all thoroughly enjoyed our time in Jury’s being so central and easy access to places we wished to see and visit.  Boxty, a lovely Irish restaurant provided my group a wonderful place to celebrate my birthday and we recommend this as a must to visit for food. My 3 night stay was truly great and made better by the people we encountered from Dublin especially Jury’s Hotel.",5,2019,01,15
231,Getaway,"This is a great hotel very central to shops, bars and restaurants, The hotel is very clean, the bedrooms are lovely, the staff were very attentive and the breakfast was great, we will definitely stay here the next time we are in Dublin.",5,2019,01,15
231,welcoming place to stay in central Dublin,"This was a good place to stay for our large group -due to size , location, great buffet breakfast and friendly bar. Rooms were both clean and comfortable - the lift card system took some getting used to....but it did mean that we felt very secure. All staff were polite  and helpful. I  arrived before check in and as my room was available I was able to check in early. ",5,2019,01,15
231,Weekend Family / Friends Trip to Dublin,Hotel is very well located and everything was reachable in walking distance. Staff was friendly and we noticed that Investments are taking place to refurbish the hotel.Cleanliness of toilet could be improved but rest was all okay.,3,2019,01,15
231,Good hotel,Good location as it is handy for the 747 bus stops and we had a reasonable price for room upgrade o an executive room which I would recommend you take if able. No issues with storing luggage for a few hours if you are too early for check in or need to check out but are too early for onward journey.,4,2019,01,15
231,"Standard international style hotel, lovely staff.","We stayed two nights in a double room which had an extra bed for families. We arrived early and asked to use the baggage locker but were given early access to our room; this was much appreciated. The room overlooked a council refuse truck park which wasn't great but caused no problems.
When room was made up the tea bag rack wasn't replenished - a minor annoyance. The tea mugs were not changed - we noted a mark on one which remained there the next day. In fact there was no sign of any fresh mugs on the housekeeping trolley so I am not sure if the mugs ever leave the room and get sterilised?
Breakfast was included in our room rate and was a very impressive spread, served as a help yourself buffet. 
Every member of staff we encountered was really pleasant and helpful.",4,2019,01,14
231,"Brilliant hotel, great location","From the minute we checked we couldn't have asked for better staff, all were very polite, friendly and helpful. Room was spacious, clean and well appointed. The hotel bar was lovely and we had a great meal in the restaurant. We will definitely be returning.",5,2019,01,14
231,Great Stay at Jurys Inn,"Hotel was excellent.  Location was really close to everything we wanted to see, but just far away enough that it wasn't loud at night.  Staff was all super nice.  Room was great, beds were comfy, and everything was super clean.",5,2019,01,14
231,Solo Traveller - Great Location!,"I had quite a journey to get to Dublin, and hadn't had more than 4 hours sleep over the previous two nights, so I was incredibly thankful when I got to this hotel. It was modern, clean, quiet and the bed felt so comfortable! 

I had the smallest double you room available (I was on a slight budget) and it was a good size. I always look at the tea and coffee collection (habit after working out of hotels for years!) and this one got the thumbs up from me! Hot chocolate and herbal teas! 

There was a bathroom in the room with an incredible shower, I slept like a baby that night. 

The staff were really helpful and friendly. I had an evening flight and was able to leave my luggage in the hotel whilst I went out to explore Dublin. You are right next to O'Connell street which seems to be the main bus thoroughfare through the city. I could catch a hop-on / hop-off bus from there and my bus to the airport. 

It took me about 15 minutes to walk to Temple Bar from the hotel too, there are loads of shops and places to eat within walking distance. 

The breakfast was fairly standard, but everything that you would want.",5,2019,01,14
231,Horrendous break,"Shocking staff, twice complained about people screaming from adjacent rooms, one was a group of 3 men the other night it was a group of children from Japan. Neither occasion did staff deal with the problem I had to sort it myself, horrendous place with lazy staff",1,2019,01,14
231,great stay,Excellent location    can visit all the sites from here easily   very clean and comfortable  - all amenities available  staff friendly and helpful     nothing to much troublealthough a great location it was quiet and had bar which was open late,5,2019,01,14
231,Jurys Inn Parnell street - great stay,In Dublin for 3 nights - business Friday - leisure Sat/Sun.  Jurys Inns are always to a good standard - and very good value for Money - Jurys inn parnell street was no exception.  Great location - just few minutes walk to the shops - 10 mins walk to temple bar area.  Would definitely recommend - and will be my first choice next time in Dublin,5,2019,01,14
231,"Great location, decent hotel","No doubt this hotel has it’s location going for it, a short walk from Connelly St train station, right around the corner from O’Connell St, pubs, bars, restaurants and a couple of shopping malls all virtually next door, and then of course Temple Bar, Grafton St are just over a 20min walk.

As for the hotel it’s pretty decent, had a comfortable stay.  I’d been put in an accessible room as that’s what was available at check in, so had plenty of space, but the decor felt somewhat tired and outdated, but it was good to see plenty of plug sockets etc for charging devices.  Also with it being an accessible room the bathroom didn’t have a tub, but a large shower, just annoying that the curtain didn’t reach all the way around and resulted in me partially soaking the bathroom floor.

Breakfast in the hotel was decent enough, nothing to write home about, just another beige hotel buffet breakfast, you won’t go hungry but don’t expect anything amazing!

No issue staying here again.",4,2019,01,13
231,"Fantastic,rob on reception amazing","This hotel is fantastic with anazing service, robert in reception is so proffesional and helpfull and wearing a big smile,akso simon in the bar so much fun,the rooms are are clean and well equipped, location fantastic, can't fault it in any way..Gary and Carol stayed 11.1.19 to 13 1.19",5,2019,01,12
231,A stay in center of Dublin,"I spent a good time in Dublin. I was there for working but I had also some fun with my collegues.The hotel, situated in the center of Dublin, is cozy and confortable. Rooms are spacious and clean. You can have a good breakfast and if you like to spend time with friends till late in the night, the bar can offer sandwiches and snacks with good beer. Yes, it's a very good place.",4,2019,01,11
231,Jurys,I stayed in jurys while up in Dublin to see les miserables  . When I looked up hotels nearest to bord gais it said jurys Parnell st was 1.1km so I booked it thinking we could walk . But when we arrived in hotel and I put it into Google maps it was 3.4km  so 15 mins in car never mind walking so I was disappointed.,3,2019,01,11
231,Lovely room in a good location,"A really nice hotel with good WiFi. The room was quite spacious and very comfortable. The hotel is in a really central location with lots of restaurants, shopping and tourist sites within walking distance. ",4,2019,01,10
231,Business stay,"The hotel is in a good location and was easy to find.The staff were very welcoming when I checked in and went above and beyond to help me check in earlier. (My flight brought me in early to Dublin)The room was lovely and plenty of room. My air con/heater wasn’t working properly. I asked reception and they couldn’t have been more helpful. Maintenance sorted it out immediately. Very impressed  The breakfast had a wide variety available which was excellent. The hot food was not hot though - it was a little on the cold side. A real shame, I hope that it was a temporary challenge as everything else was so perfect",4,2019,01,09
231,Family city break,"Great location, we had a room overlooking the courtyard which took away all the noise of the city. Hotel is within walking distance of all the central attractions. The airport bus stopped just around the corner. The buffet breakfast is good quality with a great selection so it's well worth the extra.",5,2019,01,09
231,Jurys inn,"Good hotel close to all amenities. Friendly helpful staff that have a can do attitude.The rooms are nicely appointed but could do with an upgrade. Breakfast was OK - found it expensive for what you actually get, the eggs where extremely hard and you couldn’t actually order your eggs on site so they were pre made which makes them very hard.",4,2019,01,08
231,Centrally located,This hotel is right in the heart of the city centre.  Staff are very friendly and efficent.  The hotel is nice however the shower seemed small and the bath tub creaked when standing in it taking a shower,3,2019,01,07
231,A great family hotel,Easy to reach as it's very central. The reception and staff in general were friendly and obliging. Best part of all was the wide selection at breakfast and complimentary newspaper. I would recommend this hotel for anyone traveling with family  as l was during a stopover in Dublin. Also ideal for business trips,5,2019,01,07
231,Good location to O’Connell street,"Great location to many pubs and Temple bar.  It’s my go to location because the bus drops you right off by the hotel coming from the airport 

Clean rooms. Bathroom could use a bit of updating. Street noise however you are in Dublin so no escaping that.   Would recommend to solo travelers and couples   Market across the street which is nice",4,2019,01,06
231,Good value and excellent service,"We booked this Jury's Inn as the host hotel for a large North American choir that was singing at St. Patrick's Cathedral for six days just after Christmas.  Our ""must haves"" for the hotel selection were reasonable price, breakfast included, free Wifi and no more than 20-minute walk to St. Patrick's.  While the walk was slightly longer we had great weather and no-one minded.  The breakfast was amazing and despite high drink prices in the bar everyone enjoyed the hotel and its friendly, efficient staff.  Everyone at reception was helpful and accommodating.  Letitia very kindly handled an unusual photocopying request for me and other guests who had minor problems with their rooms were dealt with quickly and pleasantly by employees.  Housekeeping staff were equally responsive and we got the impression that Jury's is a great place to work.  We would recommend this well-located property to anyone and would certainly stay there again!",4,2019,01,06
231,Great Place to Stay While in Dublin,"My husband and I had a great experience when we stayed at Jurys Inn for the first couple days of our honeymoon in Ireland.  Not only is the hotel in a great location to stay while exploring Dublin, the staff are all very gracious and helpful.  One night my husband and I could not sleep, due to jet lag, so we decided to just walk around the city until we felt sleepy.  Not only did Jurys Inn night staff make sure we had water before we left, they warned us which streets to avoid during our walk.  Also, on our last morning of our stay, my husband and I were delayed while sightseeing and the staff gave us some extra time to pack up and did not charge us.
I highly recommend Jurys Inn, and I hope to stay there again next time we travel to Ireland!  ",5,2019,01,06
231,Dublin,A very good location good hotel apart from doors banging staff friendly good bar staff hotel carpets could do with renewing breakfast was very good quality food and not to busy news papers available will return ,4,2019,01,05
231,Perfect Location,We stayed for seven nights and really got to know the hotel!  The location is great for walking almost anywhere in Dublin.  Staff are friendly and accommodating.  Rooms are clean and quiet.  Buffet breakfast is excellent and abundant.  Bar prices are high - much cheaper to walk to one of the many excellent pubs in the area.  And for your room - there's a TESCO right across the street if you want a sandwich or bottle of wine!,4,2019,01,05
231,Jury's inn .Parnell street.,"Very well located. good breakfast,and the restaurant food was good and well priced.the staff very helpful at all times.very relaxing atmosphere.the bar was nice too.the location is very central to all amenities.",5,2019,01,05
231,Christmas in Dublin,"Last year we spend Christmas in Dublin, at the Jurys Inn Parnell Street hotel, which was very good.The staff was very friendly and offered us great service. Besides that the breakfast was excellent! All together, we had a very nice stay in this hotel.I'd recommend this hotel to everyone who's thinking about going to Dublin for a city trip or something like that. At last, we stayed in the hotel on first christmas day, because everything is closed then in Dublin. So, we had Christmas dinner at the Jurys Inn hotel, which was also very good.",5,2019,01,05
231,"Excellent  Service, environment and location",I stayed here with my daughter as a break away to the city after Christmas. Location was excellent as was the service and quality of the hotel. Breakfast was very tasty and variety was excellent. The staff were very helpful from the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out. I am putting in average for sleep as we were located next to the lift and this was very loud. Not great for family.,5,2019,01,04
231,Jurys Inn is a good choice!,"The Jurys Inn, while not on Dublin’s most touristy street is a good choice for a hotel. They have clean rooms and a great full Irish breakfast. I recommend the superior room package. It’s worth it to have bigger beds and an ironing board. I don’t think it really costs that much more.",4,2019,01,04
231,Great Hotel in Dublin,We had a wonderful stay right before New Years at Jury's Inn.  We pre-paid for the executive room with early check in.  We arrived at around 9:30 am and dropped our bags off to tour Dublin prior to our 12:00 early check in.  When we arrived back early at around 11:30 our room (416) was ready for us.  The location was fantastic with about a 20 minute walk to most major tourist attractions in Dublin. The room was comfortable with everything you could need from shampoo and conditioner to coffee and tea.  It was nice to be removed from the crowds and noise in the Temple Bar area. Would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2019,01,02
231,Perfect Hotel in Dublin,"All what you need: perfect location (15 min by foot to all the sightseeing’s), good breakfast (fresh bread, strong coffee, natural juices), comfortable bed (warm blanket, different pillows), sparkling clean room!
We stayed during 2019 New Year week (beautifully decorated), so some mornings they had full capacity on breakfast, but personal solves it fast and we never had to wait more than 2 min.
Highly recommended ",5,2019,01,02
231,New Year Visit 2019,"This is our fifth visit to Dublin for New Year.
The hotel room is clean and comfortable. Room 549 was perfect. In our room there was a decent hair dryer, ironing board, iron, shampoo, conditioner and variety of tea, coffee and milk cartons. The room was cleaned every day and all towels are renewed as well. New Year's Day we put the not to be disturbed sign outside our door. A note was pushed under the door saying a bag of clean towels were left outside our room and if we wanted the room to be cleaned the maid would kindly come and clean it.  It's the small touches like this that makes a hotel go from go to excellent. The buffet breakfast was excellent and the chef and staff were very helpful and worked so hard to keep all food areas well stocked. The evening meal was well presented and plentiful. We couldn't fault the politeness and very welcoming  staff (cleaners, restaurant, bar and reception staff). The view from room  549 was pretty overlooking the yard with a pretty Christmas tree sparkling and i appreciated the quietness of our room. I am a light sleeper and I had no issues with sleeping. I have recommended this hotel to family and if you are looking for a central hotel without the noise I would recommend it. The staff are so helpful and we requested a quiet room with a bath and we got just that. I didn't want to wait until I went home to write my review because I feel the few negative comments written don't match what I've experienced at The Jury Inn. I would like to thank all the staff for making our 2019 New Year a pleasurable one. ",5,2019,01,01
231,Fantastic Hotel,"We had a great stay at Jury's.   We pre-paid for the executive room with early check in.   We got into our hotel at noon as advertised.  Fantastic.     Breakfast was good.   The location is about 20 minute walk to most major tourist attractions.  Grocery store next door.    Away from some of the crowds in the temple bar area, the walking was fine.   No surprises at check out, everything was as advertised.  Would stay here again.",5,2019,01,01
231,Mini break,Very enjoyable stay at jury’s inn. Excellent food. Very comfortable room with super bath and hot water. No noise and very well located. Highly recommend. Got a very good deal which was excellent value.,5,2018,12,31
231,Lovely hotel,"My Sons and myself stayed during the Papal visit 2018.The hotel is not far from Connolly train station so was ideal for us and a great location for site seeing.The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful.The rooms are very clean and we had breakfast on each morning which was excellent, there was great choice and food was hot and delicious.I have stayed in Jury Hotels any time I go on holiday as I find there level of service very good .I highly recommend a stay .",5,2018,12,31
231,Lovely hotel,Hotel staff were very nice and helpful at the hotel. The rooms were clean albeit a little small. Having to use the key in the lift every time was a bit of a pain but overall really enjoyed my stay. Location was good off O’Connell street.,4,2018,12,31
231,A very good choice!,"Jurys inn was a good choice for our holidays. Centrally located, very close to most attractions, we reached everything on foot. Our staying at the hotel was overall satisfying  although in the photos it looked better than it really is! ",4,2018,12,31
231,Excellent,"This hotel was a great place to stay in. The cleaning service was absolutely amazing, and when I put in special requests (wanting still water put in my room), they were willing to fulfill these requests. They offer laundry service, but note that it is not self-service. The staff was friendly, but if you are a monolingual anglophone, it is essential to be patient as English is not the first language for some staff members (though they are more than capable of communicating efficiently). The location was ideal as it was a short walk from O'Connell Street, a major Street in Dublin.",4,2018,12,30
231,"Great stay, very clean room, wonderful staff, excellent location","From the moment we checked in, (many hours before check in time), an amazing staff member, Angi, took pity on our travel condition and check us into our room. We could not be more thankful - she was wonderful! Patient, professional, and always with a smile. She explained everything about the hotel and gave us a map for when we woke us from the travel coma. Big shout out to here - thank you Angi!
The room was great, so clean, and for a basic room, what I would expect size wise; two beds, closet area, dresser, flat screen, iron/board, hair dryer, INSTANT coffee maker (for those of you that revolve around coffee) and tea, free wifi worked perfectly and black out curtains were what was needed for the first day/night to acclimate to the time difference. Bathroom was super nice, plenty of pressured hot water and lighting, towels, etc. Beds were firm but soft top and plenty of pillows to choose from. 
The hotel location is perfect; not noisy and around the corner from everything you need from hundreds of restaurants, pharmacy, shopping, bus stops, and chartered bus tickets. A short walk to Temple Bar, Trinity, Christ Church, etc.
The restaurant inside is wonderful, and another 'great job' to Andrew and the bar team. We didn't get the manager's name but he was always there and ready to jump in if things got hectic so there was never a wait for food or drinks. Loved it and a great choice for when you feel like just staying in for a night. Prices to us were very reasonable, but everyone's version of 'reasonable' is different. The main restaurant offers breakfast (and you can include it in your room fee) but I don't eat breakfast so I cannot comment. It was very busy every day. We did, however, have Christmas dinner in the main dining room and it was delicious. 
Would highly recommend this hotel to my family and friends without hesitation. Thank you all at Jurys Inn Parnell for a wonderful vacation and first time visit to Ireland.",5,2018,12,30
231,Christmas trip,"Our Annual trip to Dublin is always made better by the fact we stay in jury’s. We love visiting Santa in Arnotts and have been going for 10+years. Jury’s is central to everything we all want to see as a family and for meeting up with family & friends. Very friendly staff and fantastic rooms and bars/food/snacks.myself, husband and my children look forward to this all year long! ",4,2018,12,29
231,"Nice enough hotel, dodgy location at night ","Being located on the North Side of Dublin the hotel is in a very questionable neighbourhood at night. The hotel is comfortable and the staff pleasant. However, given the location I would not stay there again. ",3,2018,12,29
231,Birthday celebrations,Best sleep I ever had in a Dublin hotel room very sound proof. We were celebrating my Mams 80th  birthday a most memorable stay. Would highly recommend hotel to stay in. All staff were so helpful from the minute we arrived until we left. ,5,2018,12,28
231,Andrew,"Hotel staff tried there best but seemed confused and over worked at a time when the Hotel is very full and could do with more hands to the pump. Food was great, both Breakfast and christmas dinner, bit sad that for the cost of dinner for Five people, jurys Inn produced 2 crackers and not a great atmosphere.  ",2,2018,12,28
231,"Nice Hotel, good location",Jurys inn at Parnell street was a cosy and neat Hotel. Rooms were clean and beds comfortable. The staff was very friendly. Breakfast was good too! There was a bar in the Hotel as will. The location was great. ,5,2018,12,28
231,Jurys Inn,My husband and I recently enjoyed a lovely stay at this hotel. Excellent value for money and suburb location. I have stayed in quite a few hotel in Dublin over the years but this has been my favourite.,5,2018,12,27
231,Christmas in Dublin,We spent 5 days and nights in Dublin right before Christmas.  The staff at the desk were very helpful in booking two bus tours that we did to Cliffs of Moher and Northern Ireland (bus picked us up just a couple of blocks away).  The room was clean and quiet.  We were on 5th floor--room 528 so we did not hear street noise.  The food in the bar was good.  We just had nachos and pizza late one night.  The drinks were delicious.  The breakfast was huge with many choices--I especially enjoyed the crispy potatoes.,5,2018,12,27
231,"Comfortable Stay , Helpful and courteous staff","Was in Dublin for a short stay and arriving early morning after a long flight. The check in was a breeze, got a room immdtly which was a big relief . Rooms are good, clean , comfortable. Breakfast is continental with limited choice and for a short stay is fine. Location is excellent in the heart of the action of town.",4,2018,12,27
231,Family trip,"Me and my 2 boys ages 8 and 6,came up for a night before Christmas to attend walking with dinosaurs in the 3 arena and wild lights at the zoo.we paid 99 euros for a night with breakfast for the 3 of us.the desk ordered us taxis at 3 different occasions.it was our 1st time at this hotel and it's location,value and service were excellent.we ll definitely stay again on future nights in Dublin ",5,2018,12,27
231,Excellent service and value,I enjoyed a lovely Christmas trip in Dublin staying at the Jury’s Inn. The staff was great and quite helpful. It is a bit out of the way of where I spent most of my time (South of the river) but it was a short walk which was refreshing. Christmas dinner was easy to reserve via email and was a nice way to spend the evening. ,4,2018,12,27
231,Fantastic Xmas Break,"Visited over Xmas period service fantastic, staff really pleasant and could not do enough for you. The location was superb, visited Dublin a few times but this was best hotel for location we have stayed will definitely return",5,2018,12,27
231,CHRISTMAS SHOPPING TRIP ,"Jurys is very convenient for all the shops and restaurants. It’s just around the corner from O’Connell Street in the city Centre.
Check in was very quick and easy.

We had a good room on the 5th floor - very clean and comfortable with a pleasant decor.
There was decent lighting and well situated mirrors.
The bathroom was bright, modern and spotless.

We were looking forward to a cooked breakfast - usually a nice treat in a hotel.
There was a fair selection of food but no soda or potato bread which is a big part of a ‘Full Irish’. So we settled for bacon and egg.
But we found that the plates for the hot food were really cold and by the time we sat down to eat, the bacon and eggs were cold and unappetising.

For us the breakfast was a big disappointment.

Otherwise we were happy with the hotel and I’m sure we will stay there again.

",4,2018,12,26
231,Xmas in Dublin,"This hotel was brilliant! Everything that we needed was there. Room was very clean, and had plenty of towels, decent hairdryer, ironing board & iron, Wi-Fi, lots of sachets tea & coffee, thermostat, Windows also opened enough to give you fresh air. Good signal on Tv, shower worked well. Staff were really friendly and helpful, ice machine by lift, and also vending machines. Breakfast was totally delicious, with everything you could wish for, full English, continental, porridge, cereal, fruit, everything tasted great! Would definitely stay at a Jurys hotel again. One very small gripe would be that as we were at the back of the hotel the rubbish was emptied at about 5.30am and was quite noisey, diddnt really bother us but might have if we were light sleepers, would suggest asking for room at front of hotel. Location was great, lots of shops, including Tesco opposite, ver central! Really brilliant stay!!!",5,2018,12,25
231,Excellent Dublin shopping trip with the family,"The hotel is in a great position very central to everything, the room were excellent and very clean. The room service was excellent the staff very helpful nothing was to much trouble also the restaurant offered excellent food and value for money. This hotel is excellent and would recommend to all top qaulity hotel in a central location.   ",5,2018,12,25
231,Happy days at Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street,"Very good hotel :) A nice restaurant and bar, good food. A peacefulroo to stay. A short way to big shopping centers and nice restaurants. Nice and friendly personnel. I can recommend the hotel for the people at different ages. ",5,2018,12,25
231,Good but not 4 star,"Stayed here for 2 nights 19th-21st December for a shopping trip in Dublin. Entrance fantastic and the blonde receptionist allowed us to check in at 11 am, which was fantastic given we had suitcases. However, once you get into the lift and get out on the fifth floor the hotel is incredibly dated. The rooms are slightly better with clean beds and bathrooms. However, I have stayed in much better-looking hotels for a similar price. The bar is very nice and extremely good staff each night. On the first night, our heating was not working. We phoned reception who sent a maintenance man who brought a portable radiator and his assurance that the heating would be fixed the next day... this did not happen. The food for dinner was extremely average and the breakfast was below average. Not a great variety and often food was not very warm, however, the fantastic staff bring up this fact. Finally, on the first night, we had an expensive gift taken from the second floor where it had been accidentally left. Whilst the staff took time to review the CCTV they did little about it until I persisted to get them to ask who they suspected had the item if they had seen it. This lack of effort initially ruined our second night and morning and it wasn't until one of the managers went and asked the other guests whether they had seen the gift did we get it back. That manager was fantastic. Finally, they allowed us to leave our bags until our train that night which was fantastic and again the staff were very good in general, especially the blonde receptionist who my partner and I loved!!",3,2018,12,24
231,Lovely pre Christmas break. It was a Xmas gift voucher with which I had problems processing.Staff were a great help.,It was a Christmas gift voucher with which I had a lot of trouble processing incl many phone calls and texts to Dublin and Birmingham. In future I would prefer to book direct with the hotel. However in this instance I wish to thank reservetations for solving our problem. Happy Christmas to them and all your staff.,5,2018,12,24

231,Classical 4 stars hotel close to Canal street,"Classical 4 stars hotel close to Canal Street. The neighboroud of the hotel is not the one we can expect from a 4 stars hotel, but the hotel is close to Canal street and the old Dublin. The hotel itself is clean and comfortable.",4,2018,12,24
231,Been here before,"I’ve stayed in the Parnell Street Jurys Inn before and had such a good experience hence staying there again for the second time when i visited Dublin. The staff are super friendly, bag storage for free is available, public transport close by and it’s in such a good location. We had a troublesome sleep the first night due to paper thin walls and random bangs coming from upstairs until 2am. Apart from lack of sleep due to an unlucky bedroom this hotel is great. ",4,2018,12,23
231,Fine Place to stay,"This was our second trip to Dublin, and we booked late. Jury's Inn is probably akin to a Best Western in the states. It is clean and nice, but doesn't have the service or amenities of a luxury hotel. The front desk staff is friendly and cheerful, but inexperienced. The parking is blocks away, no valet. (They didn't know what the word meant). We weren't here long enough to check out the pool area, the bar is small and nice, we slept late, due to jet lag (coming from California) and the restaurant was closed at noon, so I don't know how it was. Great neighborhood, lots to see and do, lots of pubs and restaurants. ",4,2018,12,22
231,Not a Jury's Quality,"not value for money.. better quality and service elsewhereOne chair in bedroom, instead of two. Service in restaurant non existent. Waited over 30 mins to be served and left without food. Staff couldn't care when we complained. ",2,2018,12,22
231,Noisy neighbours,"Sad that my overall experience was blighted by noisy neighbours. I was a single traveller and was put in a room with a double and single meaning i was inbetween groups of women and men. The women (teenage girls) were noisy, giggling, doors opening and closing until 1am. They may as well have been in the room with me. The hotel needs to put like with like. Other than that, couldn't fault it. ",4,2018,12,20
231,super!!!,"a exellent stay in Dublin ,5th time already and it is perfect!!!Very nice people and very helpful.Breakfast was also super .i have no complains. Sorry for mine English.Hotel ,the rooms all was very good,i go surrely back next year.",5,2018,12,20
231,mid week trip,"Excellent location, Great public transport links (luas), Friendly staff, Very clean and comfortable rooms. Would defiantly recommend and return again when staying in Dublin again. Very close to main shopping areas, tourist attractions and night life.",5,2018,12,20
231,Great place to stay,The shower was amazing! And the bed very comfy. The staff were extremely friendly. The food was very good but service on an evening was slow. There was also a phone in the bathroom which was dirty. But we had no reason to use it.,4,2018,12,20
231,Would Stay Again,"We stayed here for four nights. Our room was 527, it was clean and comfortable. The bed was comfy but the bedding was quite cheap feeling, pillows and duvet a bit thin and cardboard’y. The bathroom was ok but the shower wasn’t very powerful and it struggled through maintain temperature which always gets my goat in hotels. 

The breakfast was nice, we enjoyed the options. The staff are all very friendly. 

The bar is a bit hit and miss, one guy that works in it, he wears black rimmed glasses is very good but the others are a bit lack lustre, we had terrible service one night but the other two were fine. The food is really nice. 

Fairly good location, close to everything. A little walk to temple bar but only 5/10 mins. Close to the shops. 

We would stay again. ",4,2018,12,19
231,So impressed !!,I needed to make some very last minute changes to my booking. I was not too hopeful about being able to make the changes I wanted/needed but Jurys obliged 100% much to my surprise. Good on ye and thank you! You absolutely made our day. A+++ service. ,5,2018,12,19
231,Basic!!!,"Terribly basic room!! Badly needs updating! Not at all what I would consider of a 4 star hotel! Lacks the amenities I have experienced in many other hotels! I will not return to this hotel, felt robbed!",1,2018,12,18
231,Xmas trip,Good hotel but lacking in some personal touches..main staff very helpfull but restaurant staff very casual. Superior rooms not worth paying extra for but very clean and beds were comfy. Expected more but good for a budget hotel ,4,2018,12,18
231,Good location,"We stayed at this hotel for a night whilst in Dublin for a few days. The hotel was priced well in terms of the over night accommodation. It was located a short walk to Temple Bar where all the pubs are located. Room was very basic and the bathroom was dated. On a positive, the bed was extremely comfy giving us a good nights sleep! We pre booked breakfast which for 2 of us was €22 - personally don’t feel the breakfast was that great! Slightly cold and not great coffee! I’d recommend finding somewhere outside the hotel for breakfast!",4,2018,12,17
231,Jurys parnell street,Stayed in jury inn parnell very disappointed staff very young seemed very badily trained.ordered breakfast to room on our first 2 mornings 1st morning didnt arrive 2nd morning was cold.night before we left went to pay our bill as were leaving at 4am next morning onlt to be told we owed €180 for room which was interesting since room was paid for before we even arrived.hotel itself is very nice but because of staff wont be back,1,2018,12,17
231,Gluton Free foods highlighted better,"We had difficulty at the desk, my colleague was telling the receptionist that i used to stay at the Hotel and was asking her if my name was still on the points system as i would be using the Hotel for the next 2 years with the Caranua Board, she did not seem to understand, and we gave up.",4,2018,12,17
231,Excellent stay in Dublin,"Many thanks to all very kind Staff. I suggest this hotel because of clean rooms, strategic location and gentle Staff! I had only a little problem with safe and coffy machine ... they were solved in a few time!",5,2018,12,17

231,Jurys Inn,My sisters and myself have stayed here  a few times and would  highly recommend it. it's close to everything and the staff are very friendly. The rooms are spacious  and very clean. there is also tea and coffee facilities.,5,2018,12,15
231,Birthday trip,"We went just for 1 night as a birthday treat for my twin friends. The staff in the hotel are so so friendly and made sure our cases were stored away and checked us in early as we had an early morning flight. When we got into the room, it was lovely and clean, balloons on the bed and little boxes of chocolates on the table were so cute! There was also some cards to take to the bar for complimentary glasses of Prosecco. Beds super comfy, room lovely and warm as it was a horrible weather day and bathroom spotless.The hotel is round the corner from the main bus links to the airport, bus 16 is only 3.50€ and there is a Tesco directly opposite which is very handy! Very very good central location and would always recommend for a city break ",5,2018,12,14
231,Fab location,"We came away to Dublin for
My hen weekend and booked 3 rooms in the hotel for this. 

The location is just around the corner from O’Connell street and short walk to temple bar, trinity college and other tourist spots.

The rooms were small but comfortable and very clean. We had breakfast included in the cost of our rooms and we all enjoyed the choice available to us although it was slow to be topped up on certain items though if you managed to catch a member of staff this was easily sorted.

€249 per room even when divided by 3 people is still a little steep. Yes breakfast was included and the location is excellent but still felt a bit more than it was worth.

Check out is 12pm which was lovely however we had a knock at the room door at 11.10am from housekeeping to clean the room and turn it around. Whilst 50 minutes might not seem like much we wanted a lazier morning having had a rather busy day previously",4,2018,12,13
231,Service is Key,"After planning to spend 6 nights in this hotel, I was worried how it would be, but after my stay, I have to say that the best thing is the staff. One of the friendliest hotels I have stayed in.

I would have to personally thank, Ella from the restaurant and Lore and Emilia from reception, there level of service, certainly makes a difference.

Well done to you all and keep up the good work!",4,2018,12,13

231,Incompetent.,"Checkin took ages. They took a Pre-authorisation from my credit card but later waiter ran after me out of restaurant saying I didn't have enough credit. What!  Then manager knocked on my room door and woke me up to ask why I wasn't paying for my meal! Apparently the check-in person pre-authorised enough for breakfast only, even though I asked her the way to the restaurant. Room 559 charmless by he way. As much style as a hospital.

231,Unfunny circus,"I went with 2 friends, one of them had a problem in the room.He could not have the room that was already booked and paid (and he also called to tell at what time we were arriving) because apparently they made a mistake and gave it to other person because he had a similar name. (This is also hard to believe because my friend has a name that is really uncommon in our country, not kidding, it is 8 words in total, it is pretty hard to mistake it with other one).We had to take a bus rented by our company in the entrance of the hotel next day.They agreed that to solve our problem they could gave us rooms in the other Jurys and then pay a taxi to take us to the office we had to go (where the bus was going). We agreed.We took a taxi and went to the other one.After all of this adventures we could sleep 4 hours at most.We woke up just to have more surprises, first they tried to charge me the price of the room that I had already paid, (and asking for a more expensive price than what I paid). After clearing things we took the taxi that was waiting for us.The driver told us that it was not paid and that the hotel told him nothing about the deal we made and we were supposed to pay. We told him to go to the first Jurys instead, to complain about this and then take the regular bus (being late to our meeting). At the end they paid for the taxi but we where late and we went through a lot of headaches because of the messy organization of this hotel.",1,2018,12,07
231,Nothing but Praise,First time in this hotel for a short stay in Dublin. There for some Christmas shopping and could not have chosen a better placed hotel. Reception was fine. We were there too early but they took our bag and let us start shopping. Room was big and bright overlooking courtyard. Very clean and bed was super. Self service breakfast in restaurant - something for everyone although would have liked the bacon cooked a bit more. Hotel bar (and staff) were great and good place to relax at night. Would have no hesitation in recommending Jurys and will certainly return.,5,2018,12,06
231,Nice stay,"Lovely staff, very comfortable rooms and good breakfast. Quiet and spaceful rooms. Happy with the stay . Hair dryer and soap and gel provided . Within walking distance of all points of the city . Nice shopping Centers around",5,2018,12,04
231,Nice stay and well located,Stayed at the Jurys in for four nights. Like it a lot. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were good size and the beds comfortable. The location is very good. Short walking distance for many places.,4,2018,12,04
231,Not that great,"I been at the Christchurch Jury’s a few times and remember a time when I lived continuously gor 50 days service was excellent thereThough being a frequent customer, I never received any benefits or discountsThe room could have been much better for the amount I paid & WIFI kept disconnecting Have been to Ballsbridge hotel and Mesphil and I reckon Jury’s inn at Parnell is definitely not at the top of my list",3,2018,12,04
231,A great Location,Jurys Inn is a very centrally located hotel just off the main street in the heart of Dublin.Food was excellent and the room spacious clean and comfortable.The staff are friendly and go out of their way to make you feel welcome. I look forward to my next visit,5,2018,12,04
231,Highly recommended,"Every year for the past 15 years my friends and I travel to Dublin for a Christmas break  and most of the time we stay here as it is our favourite. The hotel is safe, central and the staff are always friendly and helpful.The breakfast selection is good. The beds and pillows are soo comfy it makes it difficult to get out in the morning. Try it. They are worth visiting.",5,2018,12,04
231,Fantastic hotel in a great location,"Me and my fiancée stayed at the Jurys Inn Parnell Street Hotel for 3 nights. I have to say that the rooms were spotless, very comfortable and much nicer than I thought they'd be. The location of the hotel in Parnell Street was perfect for doing all things touristy whilst in Dublin. Only downside I could see from this hotel is that on each of the nights we stayed, there was rowdy people falling in from nights out in the small hours creating a lot of noise and banging on our room door. Obviously this is not the hotels fault but they could probably do with some better security to monitor this kind of behaviour as not to desturb other guests. I'd definitely stay here again.",5,2018,12,04
231,Great location,"Just returned from a long weekend at Jurys Inn, great room with large double bed and a extra single bed , the location was great and everything was in walking distance. The breakfast was good value with a great selection. Would recommend staying here.",4,2018,12,03
231,Highly recommended,"Stayed with two colleagues for a work commitment. Very good hotel, rooms very clean and well equipped and very quiet for a city centre location. Didn’t eat in the hotel so cannot comment, however had a drink in the very welcoming bar, the food looked very good. Well located just around the corner from O’Connell street. Would stay again.",5,2018,12,02
231,Excellent Accommodation,"Excellent hotel! Close to city centre, local markets and cobblestone roads with lots of shops of all kinds, room comfortable and well-decorated, breakfast nice as well! Stuff friendly! Recommended !!!",5,2018,12,02
231,Mother and daughters trip for shopping and concert,"Mother and daughters trip for shopping and concert had a lovely time. Hotel very central and clean. Would recommend this hotel to family, friends and anyone staying in Dublin. Room was clean but not very big but it suited us fine.",5,2018,11,29
231,Excellent hotel,"Jurys Inn is a modern hotel with a very warm restaurant and cafeteria. It is located in a very convenient place, close to some of the best sights in the city of Dublin, is comfortable and provides excellent services.",5,2018,11,29
231,Excellent,My friend and I go to Dublin every year to shop for Christmas. The past few years we have stayed in jury's. The staff are helpful and friendly. The rooms are worm and clean we r not keen on the evening meals in the restaurant so didn't book in for the meal this year as it wasn't great the past few years. Breakfast is always fabulous and freash,5,2018,11,29
231,"Good location, not special hotel","We where there during 16-19th of November. 
The hotel is located well, breakfast was awful and very expensive. 

Rooms are ok, simple and nothing extra, its a good place if you just want to sleep there and stay out all day. 

Hotel bar was nice, however well understaffed they should have more staff during rush hours. We waited 15-20 minutes to buy drinks.",3,2018,11,29
231,Good Location,"Good location, close to shops, nice reception and welcoming when you arriveNice enough stay bar the 2.30am fire alarm in hotel which was set off by a guest. Bathroom was a bit dated, hair was on floor of bathroom",4,2018,11,28
231,Great location ,Booked the hotel for a girls weekend. The hotels wasn’t fancy but it did the job. The reception staff were very helpful and were great at giving recommendations and directions. Location was great as had access to everything. ,4,2018,11,27
231,40th birthday celebrations,"a large group of couples stayed at this hotel for three nights over the weekend. We found everything about the hotel was absolutely great, Kind and friendly staff, fabulously clean and spacious rooms, great breakfast and fantastic location.",5,2018,11,27
231,Excellent service very helpful staff cleanliness of rooms were outstanding and great location,Rooms are spotless everything you need in them .staff very polite and helpful .would recommend Jurys to everybody .stayed in jurys in praque Jurys hotels are outstanding .Cleaning staff are lovely polite and mannerly .,5,2018,11,27
231,Quality on Tap,"Absolutely brilliant standards in terms of cleanliness,quality of fittings ,fixtures and appurtenances.... super bed,lovely fluffy towels,quality soaps etc..and the complimentary fruit a real good perk",5,2018,11,27
231,Trisha,Stayed here with my sisters and it was the perfect location for our shopping trip. Staff are so friendly and the food was good too. Could not fault a thing. Even got a discount on my car park. Will definitely be back!,5,2018,11,27
231,Lovely hotel,Excellent service friendly staff lively clean hotel have stayed here a few times and is the only hotel in Dublin I use close to local shops and bars from.the minute you enter all the staff r so helpful lovely lunch and dinner and excellent breakfast ,5,2018,11,26
231,Lovely hotel great location,We arrived very early and were offered a room ready “upgrade” to an executive suite for $20 more a night per night. The “executive suite” was incredibly small for two people. We made a complaint at check out about this and they immediately refunded the money. It was still nice to be able to have our hotel room at 8:00 in the morning after a long flight. Staff and housekeeping incredibly kind. Great central location.,4,2018,11,26
231,Great location and a very nice staff,"Just spent w weekend at Jurys Inn and I was overall very pleased with it. I think for a mid range hotel it has a great location and nice clean rooms. The bonus is very helpful staff always willing to to the extra

Thank you",4,2018,11,26
231,Not good enough for the price,"Stayed two nights in what we thought would be a failry luxurious hotel - what we recieved was nothing special and certainly not worth the money we paid.

It was an OK check-in - then a very long walk to find our room - this is a very large hotel! The bedroom was an adequate size, clean modern however a little bland. It had most things we needed but very basic. Basic toiletries - no shower cap, body lotion. Towels were rough. Basic tea and coffee - no complimentary water, no biscuits. These are the little things I would have expected having paid over £400 for two nights (without breakfast). 

Location was OK - about a 10 minute walk into the main centre and across the river. The nights sleep was also OK - fairly quiet and the beds were comfy enough.

Would not go back though - I'd have been better off booking a Premier Inn or Holiday Inn.",3,2018,11,26
231,watch out,"Watch out when booking out of this hotel. while waiting in reception for your pre-booked airport transfer the reception calls for a eurocab on your behalf, you presume its your transfer and let them take you to the airport. you then have to pay the fare for this journey. when you argue that it was already paid for they respond by saying that the company has changed hands and that you should pay it and you will get a receipt to which you can claim it back when you get home. so please check before you get in what you think is your prepaid for transfer. ",3,2018,11,26
231,Jurys Inn breakfast voucher little problem.,We had an excellent time in Jurys as usual. However we encountered two little problems.One the room wasnt ready until after 3 PM. The second problem was with the breakfast vouchers. There appears to be a communication issue between the breakfast sign in and the check out desk. These problems were sorted out quickly and we had a great stay in the hotel.,5,2018,11,26
231,Okay .. but pricey,We stayed for a weekend for a birthday celebration and the accomodation was good .. the rooms were clean and spacious and the service was good - however not as good as the price! The location is good but again - not worth the price label ,3,2018,11,25
231,Comfortable stay in a great location,"We had a comfortable stay here, and were in walking distance to the O'Connell Street and most major Dublin attractions.  We didn't need to take buses or even the LUAS for most of the sightseeing in the city.  Even the tour buses to other areas of Ireland met right around the block.  The bed was very comfortable, nice hot water in the shower, and pretty functional bathroom.  The only thing I would change would be better coffee in the room (we only had instant available), but this was not a big deal. ",4,2018,11,25
231,4 day stay in Dublin,"Excellent place great service close to everything people really friendly loved it.Felt very safe hotel very secure, restaurant offered a nice variety at  lunch or dinner. walking to and from hotel are names were remembered by receptionist as well as bar. ",5,2018,11,25
231,Business trip to Dublin,Very good location in the city center. The staff is excellent and helpful. The breakfast very good and tasty with plenty of food to chose. Room clean. One thing to improve the noise within hotel could be lover - people walking down the hall. ,4,2018,11,24
231,Top class Hotel,"Have used several different Hotels in Dublin, keep coming back to Jurys because its the best. The choice at breakfast is unbeatable,  lots of fresh fuit, cereals big choice, their porridge is something special. The beds are super comfortable,  clean and lovely pillows too. Will be back for sure.",5,2018,11,23
231,Convenient location,"I needed a hotel near to where my son lives. I'm glad I stayed here, most convenient. The hotel itself has helpful and friendly staff, the restaurant caters for many diets, the room was quite basic but clean (apart from awful stain on carpet) and bed comfy. My room faced the inner courtyard and was therefore nice and quiet. Even noise from other guests was not too apparent (some hotels you hear a pin drop next door!). They kindly store your luggage if your flight is much later than your checkout time.  It loses a rating for the poor heating to the room, supplied by a fan driven heating system in the ceiling, either it wasn't working properly for that room or the system is inefficient. On the plus side when I complained I was supplied with an oil filled radiator. Overall, I enjoyed staying here.",4,2018,11,23
231,We'll placed. Nice hotel,"We'll placed. Recommended car park wasn't too far away (even in the rain). The bar was a great place to catch up on emails and relax after a long day working round Dublin area.
Breakfast was ok. Only one coffee choice and no pancakes (but they were on the menu card). But wide choice of reasonable food.
Only other thing was take your key card every where with you else you can't use lifts or toilets.",5,2018,11,22
231,Overnight Stay in Dublin,"Spent one night in Dublin for a concert in 3Arena first time staying in this hotel.Hotel great location, very central for nightlife and shopping. I felt it was fairly priced. The staff were very nice and customer service was excellent.  The bar was lovely and the bar food was good. Enjoyed our stay and will stay again if in Dublin.  Most enjoyable stay. Great selection for breakfastWould highly recommend",5,2018,11,21
231,Trip,I enjoyed going to Jurys Inn Parnell Street and return there whenever I am in Dublin - which is two or three times a year. It is a very pleasant atmosphere for someone visiting a city on their own. Thanks.,5,2018,11,21
231,Excellent Customer Service,"I stay on a regular basis at hotel and have alway found the staff to be very helpful. Rooms are decent size, beds are generally comfortable and wide range of breakfast items. Liz who works during breakfast time is always cheerful and makes extra effort to check everything you need is catered for. ",5,2018,11,21
231,Nice hotel ideal location,Stayed here for one night for a concert. The location is ideal and so close to everything. Room was tidy but lacked attention to detail.. mugs in the room were dirty with tea drips down the side and the glasses in the bathroom had old toothpaste on them. Other than that no issues. Staff on the front desk were really nice and helpful.,4,2018,11,20
231,Great location!,"We were more than satisfied with our stay at Jurys Inn.  Great staff, very convenient location, lobby smelled so good every time we walked in.  It was nice having a restaurant onsite for those wet late nights that we didn't want to venture out again.",5,2018,11,20
231,Good hotel in city center ,"Check In great. 
Hotel room... clean, spacious, quiet. 
Location... great for all the sights are in easy walking distance. 
Early Check Out... not so great. Front desk couldn't tell you where the bus stops were for the airport express. Kept saying cabs out front.  Well no thanks, not when I paid only €6 for a ride and not wanting to pay €20-30 for the same thing. 
Otherwise great experience. ",4,2018,11,20
231,Dublin Night Out,This is a lovely comfortable hotel in the Centre of Dublin. Rooms are spacious and very quiet considering you are in the city Centre. The breakfast was first class. Staff are very helpful and Curtious. ,5,2018,11,19
231,Jurys Inn Dublin,"The hotel was very nice. Our room was very clean, and quiet. Bed was very comfortable. The hotel is centrally located and close to everything. Staff were very helpful and attentive. The only thing I would say is that it is a nice hotel but was missing that ""irish charm"". I could have been in a hotel anywhere, and missed a little of that irish charm. Overall though, it was a good hotel and suited our needs for a night. ",5,2018,11,19
231,"Excellent Hotel, excellent service","Everything was very good. Very kind staff, excellent service, easy check-in and check-out. Only a bit noisy in the night because of the traffic noise in front of the Hotel. But on the other side the Hotel is well located, it´s just a short walk to the inner city.",4,2018,11,19
231,Great hotel ,"Great hotel. Modern, clean, comfortable beds friendly staff and a welcoming atmosphere. Close enough to the center of Dublin just a short walk to shopping, restaurants, pubs of course and the sights to see. Good location to base you exploration of Dublin and Ireland. Did I mention the comfortable bed?  ",5,2018,11,18
231,"Clean, good price and good location","It was a girls' trip and we decided we want somewhere decently located so we didn't have to worry about taking a cab, bus or driving. FYI, they do not have a parking garage of their own but an arrangement with a garage nearby at a discounted price.All the places we visited (e.g.Trinity College, Brazenhead Pub, etc) are nearby. There is no swimming pool. There is a gym which I never went so I cannot tell you. The room is kept clean the entire week of our stay. Some reviewers complained of loud noises but I did not experience that. Maybe I'm out every morning by 8 am and back to the hotel by 9 pm. The evenings are reasonably quiet for me to sleep through the night.The staff is very friendly. When my friend got sick, one of the staff personally walked outside to point us where the nearest pharmacy is.",5,2018,11,18
231,Excellent facilities and service at the Jurys Inn,"Stayed for 3 nights for our nephews 21st birthday. Arrived very late on first night and were well looked after at reception and the bar. Facilities and staff were excellent, Breakfast buffet was amazingly good. Highly recommend this hotel. Excellent location. Dr Cooper",5,2018,11,17
231,Great stay,"Great location, friendly proffessional staff. Tesco across the road for essentials. Very clean and tidy. Beutifully decorated ( for christmas) away from all the bars, but only about a five or ten minute walk from temple bar.",5,2018,11,16
231,Lack of sleep,"This was a return visit after 4 years, cannot fault the location at all less than a 2 minute walk to O'Connell street the airport bus stopped there was so was very convenient for that. Our room was ready on arrival 9.30am so we took our cases up and went out for the day. We were in room 503 which is quite possibly the loudest room ive stayed in when i say no sleep im not exaggerating we thought originally it was the air con that was keeping us awake it sounded like a washing machine was constantly running,  we later worked out it was the lift and we were next to the lobby. The Girl on reception organised a room change for us after 3pm which was great as we were going out for the day, the next room we stayed in was 355 although a long walk from the lift lobby it was still quite noisy our neighbours in the room either opposite or next door contributed to that also. Overall we will not return to this Jurys will probably go back to the christ church one although the staff were friendly and helpful i want to be able to get a good night sleep. ",3,2018,11,16
231,"Fantastic staff, brilliant location",The location is perfect for business trips and the staff were a delight. Nothing was asking too much of any of the staff and they made the stay especially enjoyable. This will definitely be my hotel of choice for future trips.,5,2018,11,16
231,Good location and value,The hotel is located in a good area close to services. There is a grocery store across the street.  Convenient to airport bus transportation and is a short walk. The room was clean and quiet. The staff were helpful considering my language barrier. ,5,2018,11,15
231,Wonderful stay,"This hotel is ideally situated for the sights & shops of Dublin city centre. A very warm welcome on arrival, a very comfortable clean  & quiet room & a bar with very reasonable prices. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant but did have a delicious pizza in the bar. Lovely Christmas decorations went up throughout the hotel one day while we had been sightseeing, including a lit tree outside our window in the courtyard! ",5,2018,11,14
231,Very well located,Hotel well located in the city center near O'Connell Street.Good service however the bathroom and the air conditioning could be improved (too old).We had a quiet room which we appreciated.Prices are a little high though.,4,2018,11,14
231,Judgement time,"Excellent hotel in a terrific location. Our room was very quiet, we could not hear any outside noise or guests in the hotel. Very comfortable bed and warm duvet.Breakfast was good with a separate counter for gluten free. The porridge was made with water so that meant those with a dairy allergy could enjoy it too and there was soya and almond milk available.Welcoming and helpful staff contributed to our stay.The location is at the top of Dublin's main shopping street and buses/trams/taxis are all close by, with the main station not too far a walk away either.",5,2018,11,14
231,Friendly staff and good location!,"Nothing wrong with the hotel but a tad outdated. The rooms were spacious enough and the beds where comfy, clean but a bid short if you are 1.90. Friendly staff  a nice bar area but not the best kitchen. The breakfast was good though. Location wise a good spot as most of the city center is in walking distance. Definitely wouldn’t mind staying there again.",3,2018,11,13
231,U2 dublin,good location to everything  cant go wrong here  short walk to temple bar and can go anywhere from O'Connell st.  definetly go in the O'Connell pub you will be amazed of the inside does not look like it from outside,5,2018,11,13
231,father and son weekend in Dublin,"excellent hotel with good service, bar and restaurant and clean and silent rooms in  a less touristic part of the central city with 10 minutes walk from the real city center. A hotel with made our weekend to a real success because of the warm atmosphere.",5,2018,11,13
231,Great Hot,Great location and easy walk to/from drop-off point for airport bus. Comfortable bed and excellent breakfast included in our package. Very welcoming front desk staff who seem genuinely interested in our travels and reasons for visiting Dublin. Helpful in providing local map with areas of interest to visit and also printing maps to find specific location we wanted to visit. Highly recommended,5,2018,11,12
231,Not great,"Room 404, next to lift and front of the building so very noisy street traffic all night. Tired room. Wonderful mattress, awful lumpy pillows.
Breakfast (7.45 a.m) was not nice, tepid and dried out fried eggs and potatoes. Skin on the beans.  Had two mini pain au chocolat, one was fresh and tasty, the other clearly from the day before as it was stale.
Left the bar as it took so long to get served
Couple in the next room had a shouting/fist fight at 2 in the morning.
Not a good nights rest",3,2018,11,12
231,Excellent city centre break,"Used my Jurys Rewards points to provide a 3 night stop in this great city.Fine hotel - very helpful staff, everywhere spotlessly clean; breakfast busy & buffet style, plenty of choice and constantly refilled. Small gym, useful for making space for further Guinness later on :-)Room was a bit too warm, couldn't quite get to grips with the auto-air con, but no big deal.Great location, handy for all the sights and 100m or so from a direct bus to and from the airport.",4,2018,11,12
231,Great hotel,"Great hotel in an ideal location, 5th stay for us. Not as welcoming this time but would still come here again. Had booked early check-in but the room wasn’t ready and had to wait 20 minutes which was pointless. Otherwise a good stay.",4,2018,11,10
231,Disappointing hotel in good location,"The service was good and the location is excellent from most perspectives: however, this hotel seems old fashioned, tired and in need of refurbishment. It would not be competitive in most European or North American cities",4,2018,11,10
231,Nice stay,Spent three nights at the Jurys Inn Parnell Street - convenient hotel with good location to key sites in Dublin.  We liked that is was very close to shuttles to and from the Dublin Airport which pick up and drop off on O'Connell Street - a 5 minute walk to the stop.  We arrived early AM and our room wasn't ready yet but they stored our luggage for the day no problem.  Room was small (as are most rooms in Europe) but had necessary amenities.  Good bar at this hotel - nice place to stop in evenings after spending day in town.  Recommend this hotel if making trip to Dublin!,5,2018,11,09
231,"Close to the city centre, clean rooms, helpful staff","A nice stay at Jurys Inn. The hotel is located in the city centre and just a short walk from everything Dublin has to offer. Dublins best fish&chips is located just across the street. Dublin city bikes are located near by too.We came in early and that was no problem. We got our room with no extra charge! Helpful staff pointing out places to see in Dublin. Free Wifi and clean rooms.The hotel could use a bit of modernization, a carpet change and a bit of paint. ",4,2018,11,09
231,One night stay,"I stayed here for one night after travelling to Dublin with my friend. The hotel was easy to find and in a very good ‘city centre’ location. There are shops and bars in the immediate area and a bus stop round the corner for airport transfers etc. Its 7 euro pp each way. As you enter the hotel, there is a beautiful scent that hits you straight away, I’m not sure what it is but it’s really pleasant.  There is complimentary juice in the reception area. Check in was quick and easy and staff really welcoming and professional. You need to use your room card to use the lift and again to enter your room. I asked for a quiet room on a high floor and thats what we got. Rooms fairly basic however, beds very comfortable with lovely clean linen. Coffee sachets could be better and complimentary water would have been nice. Overall, a decent night’s stay and would return again.  ",5,2018,11,09
231,Nice hotel for a reasonable price,"Had a good one night stay.  Nice room, comfortable bed, good buffet breakfast, friendly and helpful staff.   The hotel is in a great location and a short walk to all of central Dublin.  It's also close to public transport and the Airlink and Aircoach buses to and from the airport. ",5,2018,11,08
231,A great city Centre hotel!,"My wife and I are leaving today after a great 4 night stay. We chose this place after reading many good trip advisor reviews and were happy we did. The hotel is in a really good area to be able to walk to many things! You can get to Temple bar in 10 minutes, over to the hop on hop off bus in 1 minute and you are surrounded by shopping, restaurants, bars, grocery stores and fast food too. The hotel itself is pretty modern, rooms are nicely appointed and fairly good size. We had interior courtyard room and it was very quiet, and the bed was comfortable. We had a tasty buffet breakfast included with the room, thanks to Expedia booking. It was a great stay, perfect for exploring Dublin and the staff is very nice too! Overall a great stay!",5,2018,11,08
231,50th birthday madness,"Hotel feels a little far out for main attractions but close to lots of shopping, restaurants. Rooms clean, comfy beds and secure although felt quite cold. Rang maintenance who sorted straight away though. 
Lovely bar area, and stay open late. Very reasonable prices too for a hotel and for Dublin. Big shout out to the young gentleman behind the bar called Lee! What an absolute credit to Jurys. He was the ultimate customer service on very late night, just before the bar closed. Patient, smily, chatty, and organised. 
Overall would stay here again maybe but personally prefer the other side of river.",4,2018,11,08
231,City break to Dublin,"Very easy and fully explained how to make a booking online and offer a free cancellation service with paying on the day possible. Very welcoming lobby, entrance and the front of house staff very happy to help and welcoming. We stayed in room 320 on the 3rd floor the walk to our room I could see the hotel was very clean and presentable. Upon entering our room we had a great view of the city and parnell street. With complimentary teas coffee etc with toiletries provided too if needed. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable and seemed fresh. 

Would definitely stay again with a great location to walk to most tourist areas of Dublin ",5,2018,11,07
231,Perfect location for shopping but disappointing service at their restaurant,"The lady at the reception was lovely and offered to keep our  bags until check in time. The rooms were clean and quite. 
Overall it was a nice stay but disappointed with the service at the restaurant.

We decided to eat at the restaurant our first night and got down there 20 min before closing time. The waitresses that were preparing for breakfast said that they were closing, did not offer us table and were not really welcoming. They finally said we could order IF we knew what we wanted. We said yes even though we had no clue what was on the menu as we were hungry. So the feeling we got from them was to be quick because their shift was almost over. We then had an incident with one of the dish we ordered but Jana the manager came and assisted the waitresses who were in hurry to go home and she handled it well. ",4,2018,11,07
231,Lovely hotel with good late night bar!,"We had a lovely stay here, the room was clean and spacious. The hotel was quiet but with a good late night bar - ideal for drinks after dinner. Service was friendly and price was good, though not cheap!",5,2018,11,07
231,"Nice clean hotel. Staff friendly and helpful, location just off O'Connell street makes it great access to things","Wife and I stayed this past weekend and had a great time. the rooms are clean and neat, typically European rooms with large bed, desk, bathroom. no comfy chair :-). we walked everywhere in Dublin from the hotel. once you get used to using o'connell street as the reference point, everything is accessible. We ate on night in the bar, had pizza, very good. shopping and pubs are close as you want to walk.",4,2018,11,07
231,Dublin mid-week break,"This is an excellent hotel. The location couldn't be better being close to the city centre to the north of the river. Pretty much everything that matters is within walking distance. If you need buses or trams, the stops are just around the corner. A short walk away is the entrance to one of the main shopping centres which leads on to more shops and other centres. If you can resist the shops just walk on a little further and you will cross the river to the Temple Bar area where you will find entertainment, restaurants and loads of bars. The hotel was of a very high standard with friendly, attentive staff, a very good restaurant and warm, clean and comfortable rooms. we will return to Dublin and this hotel will be our first choice accommodation.",5,2018,11,06
231,Neither fish nor fowl,"We stayed here for two nights in September.  I took my husband for a birthday weekend trip to Dublin so he could see if the Guinness was truly in a different class (and to sprint round the historical attractions).  Therefore we weren't looking for a luxury hotel, but a good quality, comfortable place within walking distance of the main attractions and a bar suitable for a nightcap.
On the plus side, the duty manager, normally based in Milton Keynes, was exceptionally helpful.  He was welcoming and discussed available rooms with us, suggesting that as they had a stag party staying he would put us away from any noise from the bar and the lifts.
As we suspected, the stags obviously went out well before our evening started and came back long after we had gone to bed, so we neither heard nor saw them.
The breakfast was good quality (lovely sausages) and with reasonable, though not huge, choice.
The location was good, close to bus stops, taxis and shops.  Contrary to other reviewers, we didn't find the location at all edgy or worrying.  Certainly I would prefer to be here than in some of the ""livelier"" areas.
The bar wasn't exactly atmospheric but was pleasant enough and the bar staff were friendly and efficient.
On the downside - the room was dingy, the bathroom smelt strongly of damp which permeated the whole room, and there was a large stain on the carpet which had clearly not responded to cleaning and therefore the carpet should have been replaced.  I hesitate to speculate what the stain was.
There were strategically placed machines on the upper floors for guests to buy bottles of water.  However we could not get them to accept our money so had to go to bed with no water.
The reception area was poorly lit and not in a romantic way so one felt slightly depressed on arrival.
I have no idea why other reviewers rate this place so highly.  It should provide basic facilities well - say, a step up from a Comfort inn or H I Express.  In fact it was worse - only the service staff save it.  The Management responsible for facilities and maintenance should be disciplined.",3,2018,11,06
231,Happy Out,In heart of city. Spotless. Good breakfast. Comfortable room. 4/5 because we ordered a pizza from room service at 8 pm. Got a call at 9 pm to say there was no pizza available that night. Would stay again however...,4,2018,11,06
231,Price - Quality,"We stayed in a room for three, the double bed was small and too soft, the auxiliary bed had wheels and moved a lot. Was uncomfortable. The bathroom very old and the shower faucet did not work propertly, it was not a room according for the price we paid",1,2018,11,06
231,Weekend in Dublin,"Great location close to shops, pubs, tour buses, airport bus, taxi rank outside hotel. Lovely clean hotel, room pleasantly decorated, not a bad size, bathroom  good decor and spotless. Bedding and towels pristine. Service can not be faulted, every member of staff I came into contact with was friendly, professional, and nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was very good, hot or cold food, great variety of choice. Please think about getting feather pillows, that's my only gripe, but still a great hotel.",5,2018,11,05
231,Stayed for slayer gig,"Very clean, helpful and friendly staff in a perfect location, close to everything. Really comfortable sleep and at a reasonable price. Excellent place to stay would recommend to anyone that's staying in Dublin city for a few nights.",5,2018,11,05
231,Shopping trip to Dublin,"Stayed here recently with friends for a night. Hotel was beautiful, staff extremely professional. Breakfast was fantastic. Location of this hotel is brilliant. Literally a 2 min walk through Moore Street to Henry Street. Overall fantastic experience. Will certainly use this hotel when in Dublin again",5,2018,11,05
231,"Great location, great breakfast.",really enjoyed our stay .  11 of us celebrating my sons 40th birthday !  Only one thing was on the evening the staff in the bar where very busy and left our food plates on the table for a very long time.,5,2018,11,05
231,Penny-Pinching?,"We stayed at Jurys Inn (Dublin) in room 451 in October/November 2018.

The room was basically a standard hotel room (on the small side) with two beds: one double & one single. The room was dark – no central light, just lights around the edge.

There was no safe.

There was not much storage space either in the room or bathroom.

Bathroom was the usual bath / shower arrangement – but the water pressure was low.

The hotel did not have a “business centre” or anywhere to print off documentation. However, the reception staff were very helpful – we had to email any documents to them and then they printed the documents.

Breakfast was good – plenty of variety and the food was replenished promptly. You can order poached and boiled eggs separately.

We ate in the restaurant twice during our stay – whilst the food was good the atmosphere was very poor – and the restaurant was cold – we had to ask for the heating to be turned up. In addition, the bread rolls came with margarine – we had to ask for butter.

Our main issue was that on two days our room was not serviced by the time we returned (16:00 on one day and 14:30) – Reception blamed the delay on the staff “working their way through the rooms”, but we thought that the rooms should have been serviced within 4 hours.

Our headline refers the impression we had that maybe the hotel was trying to save money:- margarine instead of butter and not enough maids to service the rooms.

The hotel is in the North-side of Dublin and is handy for most sites. We went to Andrea Bocelli’s concert at the 3Arena. This was easy to get to – catch a tram from Abbey Street.

Would we stay again? Not sure, there was nothing to stand out and there were a few issues.",3,2018,11,05
231,Lovely hotel and staff! ,"I stopped here for 4 nights with my boyfriend. We arrived hours before our check in time due to an early flight, just hoping to drop the bags off. When we arrived, we were informed our room was ready and we could check in. We were very pleased as we were very tired. The room was a perfect size and the bed was unbelievably comfy! We only had 2 meals here (room service) but the food was very nice what we ordered. The room was cleaned daily with fresh towels, tea, coffee etc. When we checked out the lady at the front desk was very lovely. (Lore was her name, I think.) All in all, I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again!",5,2018,11,04
231,"Good Location, Good Service.",Decent price and a decent location.  The hotel was dated but clean.  We stayed here on our first night and so it was easy to find from the airport.  Nothing special but I would stay again for a quick in and out night.,4,2018,11,04
231,Overpriced and dated hotel,Don't stay here. Why this hotel has good ratings i don't know.  As a frequent user of hotels i would say that this isn't somewhere that i will be taking my family back to.  Check-in time was changed without notification. The room was meant to be a family room but was a small double.  Walls are paper thin.  Toilets in the bar area smell. Sofa in the reception looks like someone has been sick on it.... need i say more?,1,2018,11,03
231,Nice hotel in central dublin,"A value for money hotel in the centre. The staff is very friendly and exerted. We enjoyed the central position of the hotel. The rooms are clean, altough the building itself is not the newest anymore.",4,2018,11,03
231,A nice trip to the heart of Dublin,The hotel lies in the heart of Dublin and therefore it's easy to walk to the most places of interest. The rooms are arranged very aesthetically and the roomservice is very neat in tidying up every day. Every day there were new towels even there was no necessity. The staff at the front desk was very helpfull at every time and very courteuos and nice.We will visit Dublin again next year and we are upt o book again in this hotel - we can recommend it to the best of our Knowledge.,5,2018,11,03
231,Comfortable/Friendly ,"Stayed here twice this year, both times for a short family break in Dublin, the rooms are nice, clean and modern with comfortable beds as well, the breakfast is a buffet type but with an excellent choice of cereal, fruit or full Irish breakfast (including my favourite White pudding). Nice friendly staff & a good central location.",4,2018,11,01
231,Amazing 50th Birthday weekend.,"So grateful to Jury's for making and helping me celebrate my 50th, they upgraded my husband and I to an executive suite, provided balloons, fancy chocs, free prossecco and a lot of other little welcome touches, staff are so helpful and friendly, can't wait to go back, there's so much of Dublin we didn't get to see.",5,2018,11,01
231,Really good hotel excellent staff,"Only one crit on the room - the bed headboard was very dustyWe ordered black coffee at the bar, told the machine was broken and served with a very weak lukewarm cup - just accepted and paid - it put us off ordering an evening meal",5,2018,11,01
231,Excellent,"Great location, Good service.Great staff. Helpfull staff. Good breakfast. I was very happy with everything. Looking forward to stay at Jurys Inn in Liverpool 23.nov until 26 nov. with 10 people from my family.",5,2018,11,01
231,Dublin weekend break,For the price paid we had an excellent room with everything we needed and extras like tea and ironing board. Staff were all helpful and friendly. The bar was great late at night. Location was perfect for short walk down O’Connell st or Moore St. Will be using again,5,2018,10,31
231,"Good location, comfortable stay","Hotel is in good location, friendly staff, good breakfast spread.  Hotel generally needs updating, décor and general feel is a bit tired.  Very basic items in bedroom - did have iron, hair drier and kettle.  Nice touch would have been complimentary water and better range of bathroom - shampoo, conditioner, soap etc.",3,2018,10,31
231,Good location in town,"Medium sized rooms, some backing onto a fairly noisy courtyard, others fronting on to the main road. Small, but quite efficient lifts. There is a bar and cafe area and a main restaurant. The food isn't great, besides our crowd there were few other diners. Breakfast was good and the coffee very good. 
The hotel is opposite the Christchurch Cathedral and close to some good places to eat.",4,2018,10,29
231,Best choice for Dublin,"Great location to walk to every thing. Beautiful room and surroundings and lovely lovely staff,The front desk is friendly and actively reach out to be helpful. We were offered help for storing out luggage and directions for dinner. The room was lovely and quiet ",5,2018,10,29
231,Top Hotel and special position in town,"Very confortable hotel and well situated in the middle of Dublin. Very good quality for rooms, beds and breakfast. Beautiful location and special for friends trip and couples.We were really happy to be there",5,2018,10,29
231,Nice Hotel - Nice Location,Very good level of services and perfeclty located at Dublin's town centre. Clean room and very good breakfast. Upgraded my room at executive! Only problem is that he hotel does not have its own parking. An available parking is close but its exact location must be commnunicated to hotel clients before arrival.   ,5,2018,10,29
231,Short trip to dublin,"This was a quick trip to recce as my 60th b/day looms soon, an excellent hotel and great location a short walk from temple bar area and away from the hubbub and noise from that area.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our stay, and recommend this as a hotel to stay to enjoy the beautiful place called Dublin ",5,2018,10,29
231,Got a room for disabled people even though we are not disabled,"We got a room for disabled people even though we are not disabled. After we checked out our first room and found the bathroom very inconvenient for disabled people (shower in the middle of the room without border/edge, sink and toilet too low, looked weird all in all), we asked for a normal room, for not disabled people. What we got was another room for disabled people! The 2nd room was exactly the same. So the moving was for nothing and we didn't want to ask a third time. Very annoying. The room was okay, but the bathroom for disabled people was inconvenient for normal people and it was dirty (underneath the chair in the shower and on the floor), plus it seemed kind of old to me. The rest of the room was good and we got a present on Sunday with snacks and water which was very nice. The breakfast was average, but very big. It was too expensive all in all!",3,2018,10,28
231,Good place to stay if you are on a business trip,"Had a couple of days business trip and found this place to be very good and convenient. Close to shopping malls and eating places as well. The rooms are spacious, neat and well maintained.
The breakfast is quite nice. REcommended place to stay in Dublin.",5,2018,10,26
231,Great deal.,"Would recommend this hotel when staying in Dublin. Walking distance to restaurants, shopping, and the bus stops including the hop on hop off and a the bus to and from the airport. Good value all around.",4,2018,10,25
231,A winter break,Enjoyed a lovely stay. We worried about sleeping in a room right next to the elevators but had a very peaceful sleep. Beds have excellent mattresses. Nice and friendly staff. Great location. Favorite Jurys Inn so far.,5,2018,10,24
231,"Location, Location, Location","Our third trip to Dublin. Our best experience yet. Excellent service, Excellent room, Excellent value........Great location.....close to Temple Bar area, Trinity College, Christ Church, St. Peters, museums, libraries, shopping, restaurants.........",5,2018,10,24
231,Not the last stay.,"Staff very courteous and very helpful.Nothing was too much trouble.Hotel is very clean, pleasant and breakfast was very good. Plenty to choose from. Although we did miss mushrooms.Will definitely book this hotel again.",5,2018,10,24
231,Centre of town,"This hotel is a great option if you want to be right in the middle of Dublin and to be able to walk everywhere. It's not the smartest of locations but is good value, nicely decorated and clean. Staff were unfailingly friendly and helpful. The room was a good size and well designed. ",5,2018,10,24
231,Short Stay,"I always stay at jurys when in dublin & never had any problems. Always recommend this hotel to friends but this time I felt I was ripped with the food in bar. 2 ham sandwiches, menu said there was chunky bits of ham, but when we received them it was packet ham you buy anywhere for 1 euro. Not nice",2,2018,10,24
231,"Central location, convenient clean and comfortable","Perfect stop for visiting Dublin, for business or just to have an explore. 

Staff are exceptionally helpful. My executive room was spacious and spotlessly clean. Whenever I am in Dublin I don’t stay anywhere else.

Rooms are well appointed and the beds are large and incredibly comfortable. 

Just a 5-10minute walk from the shuttle bus to the town centre from the airport location couldn’t be more convenient. 

Thanks to all the team at the Jury’s Inn Parnell street. Every time I drop in you all exceed expectations. ",5,2018,10,24
231,"Clean, convenient and comfortable",This hotel is very convenient for the centre of Dublin without being in the noisy Temple Bar area.  It was clean and tidy with am excellent breakfast. The staff were also very polite and helpful.  Thank you.,5,2018,10,23
231,No Frills hotel with good location,We stayed 2 nights at a weekend. Prices was high for weekend as usual for most hotel. Convenient ice machines with cold water at corridor. Bed was comfortable and location was good near to my car rental office and 10 mins walk to Temple Bar area.,4,2018,10,23
231,great place and great location,"the hotel was booked by our travel agent as a package and i’m glad she chose this hotel. the staff was friendly and very helpful, the restaurant and late night bar were excellent and the location was great.",5,2018,10,22
231,First of 4 hotels we stayed in,"Looking back over our 7 day 4 hotel trip to Ireland, Jury's Inn stands as our favorite. The beds were so soft and comfy. The breakfast was delicious with wonderful little touches like yogurt in small jars. They even had smoothies! Lots of fresh fruit too! Convenient ice machines with cold water! Even the staff were the friendliest and most helpful! First solo trip for my daughter and I, so we needed lots of questions answered. Well done!",5,2018,10,21
231,Nice hotel and good location,We stayed here 3 nights and we're happy for this hotel. It was really easy to walk to the city from hotel. There were many shops near the hotel. The breakfast was really good and there were really nice staff. Rooms were ok but they were not in new condition any more. They were clean. There was some noise from backyard really early in the morning because there was parking place for garbage trucks.We ordered some pizzas from room service and it was good food for reasonable price.Overall this hotel was nice place to stay.,4,2018,10,21
231,Weekend stay ,Hotel very nice food really good very near to everything tesco lidl aldi all  2 min away same with shops bars and restaurants bus stop for aircoach route 700 2 mins away all in all good my bad point is the hotel is very noisy doors slamming etc all night im a light sleeper so disturbed my sleep prob would try the christ church jurys inn next visit enjoy 😁😁,3,2018,10,21
231,"Great hotel, great location!","We chose this hotel based upon reviews on this site. There are some critical reviews but to be honest I don't recognise the place I stayed in. On arrival, Angelika, on reception, asked if we were in Dublin for a special occasion and I told her it was my birthday the next day. After booking us in, she gave us a slip for two complimentary drinks in the hotel's bar! The next day in our room there was again a complimentary slip for the bar, a birthday card from the hotel and chocolates! Our room was on the third floor at the rear and had liquid soaps, shampoo and shower gel in wall-mounted dispensers. Tea/coffee is provided, TV and an iron and ironing board. If you don't want to bring toiletries because of all the problems at the airport, or you've simply forgotten something, don't worry, there are several supermarkets close by or more upmarket shops within walking distance. My wife forgot her shower cap and mentioned it to the lady on reception, two were sent up to our room! The bar/restaurant area on the second floor is very pleasant and like everywhere else in the hotel, the staff are friendly, welcoming and attentive. As well as serving drinks, you can get a snack in the bar area should you want one. The restaurant at breakfast is buffet style and provides all you would want both hot and cold, with additional dishes available either free or at an additional cost. We got to the city on the airport bus (747) which takes about half an hour. It drops you in Cathal Brugha St which is off O'Connell St, so about five minutes walk from the hotel, it also picks you up there on the return journey. The hotel has shops and budget supermarkets nearby and is really handy for the City centre. I'm in my late sixties but my wife and I would walk to Temple Bar area in about ten minutes, it took about half and hour to walk up to St. Stephen's Green and slightly less to the Jameson Distillery. Having stayed in other hotels in Dublin before we found this one well placed for the City centre amenities. If like us you decide to take a trip on the Dart down the coast, the hotel is about fifteen to twenty minutes walk from Connolly station. As others have said, the staff here are the hotel's best asset and certainly we will return",5,2018,10,21
231,"Good location, very expensive",For the time we went we paid very high rates for a hotel that is equivalent in Spain to a 2 star hotel. Rooms were clean and not small but old. Reception is also very old and out of date but we were very well attended by the employees. ,2,2018,10,21
231,Perfect Hotel for a weekend in Dublin,I really liked this hotel. The personal was very friendly and gave us helpful tipps for our stay in Dublin. The hotel was also very clean and calm. The hotel is situated about 5 minutes from the city-center.,5,2018,10,19
231,"Excellent location, staff and hotel overall","during this trip we stayed in three hotels this was by far the best for being centrally located (with big suitcases easy walking access from the Dublin airport bus drop off, to the Dublin to Belfast coach pick up spot, and centrally located to get tourist information if not already given by reception desk :) compare and buy the hop on hop off buses and easy walking access back to the hotel if you miss the last bus. Easy access to O'Connell street and Templebar area. Very attentive staff from reception to cleaners, nothing was a bother. The sleep quality was magnificent bed and pillows just right other hotels no selection of hard soft pillows and beds too soft, but not here :)the hotels we stayed in Dublin had no fridges but one would be good :) Excellent overall :)))))",5,2018,10,19
231,Needs to be refurbished,"While the staff is friendly, the hotel itself needs needs to be refurbished and thoroughly cleaned.  My room had a terrible mold/mildew smell, and I was told it was a “characteristic of the hotel”.  I understand it is damp in Dublin, but it is time to change the old carpets and power wash the rooms.  Tv and heat/ac were broken and never fixed despite repeated calls for service.   There are no amenities in the bathroom and low quality towels. The walls are quite thin and you’ll be able to hear your neighbors’ baby and kids awaken in the early morning.   I was served dinner on dirty dishe.  This is a no frills, dilapadidated hotel that should be cleaned and upgraded.  No concierge and limited phone service in the evening.  I called for a wake up call after 10:00pm and no one answered until 10:30pm.  “Sorry, I was helping a guest.”   This would be a zero rating — the staff was the only saving grace and much like the rest of the people in Dublin, they were friendly.",1,2018,10,18
231,Value for money. Very good location,"It was overall fantastic. Fabuylous location . Good breakfast. Clean and good value for money.But beware of the recommendation of"" their carpark"". There are other options closer to the hotel. Not only is far away but also difficult to reach by car. We left our 10 year old child at reception, and we were away for 20 minutes.",4,2018,10,17
231,"Great location, Excellent Staff","Was in Dublin with my Mom.  Had a wonderful stay at this Hotel.  Beds were super comfy and the breakfast was plentiful and always fresh.  It was a tad expensive but realizing this is a major city, comparable in that sense.  Location was perfect for walking everywhere. Late night pizzas were delicious from the restaurant.  Would definitely recommend!",5,2018,10,17
231,First class Jury Service!,"From arrival at the front desk to our departure we received an excellent standard of service. Smiling faces at reception, friendly bar and restaurant staff. Rooms were very comfortable and clean. Lovely food in the restaurant, our first night we ate there and it was wonderful, good selection of dishes and very tasty food. Only drawback was the noise from the road, but I expected that as we were central in a very busy city with a main road running along the front of the hotel.",5,2018,10,16
231,Exceptional hotel,The hotel was most comfortable with extra touches like fruit on a side table at the elevator. The room was most comfortable with messages reminding guests to be happy. The breakfast was one of the best I have ever had.,5,2018,10,15
231,Great hotel,"The hotel is in a great central location close to tram/bus stops, it is about a 10 minute walk from the river. The hotel was clean, tidy and not dated. We had a triple room and it was still spacious. The staff were amazingly friendly and helpful, we arrived early and they kept our bags in a secure room all day, the staff on reception were very friendly and chatty. Me and two friends were visiting as a birthday trip, I had emailed ahead and said it was a special trip for that occasion, when we got to the room they had put out balloons, a birthday card and three mini boxes of truffle chocolates as well as a note to say we had a complimentary glass of prosecco at the bar. The bar was really nice and the food was very good and had a big selection for a hotel restaurant. The buffet breakfast was also really good with a big selection of hot and cold food. We booked directly on the Jury’s Inn website as they had a really good offer on when we booked. The second day we had a knock at the door and a member of staff had brought us a basket of treats (crisps/chocolate) as a thank you for booking directly with them. When we checked out, again the staff were really helpful and booked us a taxi and again we could leave our bags all day.

Overall for a biggish chain, very impressed with the level of service for the price we paid. Would definitely stay again and recommend to everyone.",5,2018,10,15
231,Very nice hotel.,"Jurys Inn Parnell Street is a very nice and lovely hotel with friendly and helpful staff. Jurys Inn is perfectly located for a vacation stay, it is close to the center and yet in a quiet area.We will be back.",5,2018,10,15
231,Good location but needs a bit of money spent on it!,"Central location but the hotel needs a bit of money spent on it which you thought Jury's could afford. The bar area was nice but the breakfast was very disappointing, should have an Irish element with local breads etc. Bedrooms basic but a good bed. Television was not working properly which was irritating. Simply could be a bit better.",3,2018,10,15
231,"Good location, good service, good hotel",The hotel is located in a very central area of Dublin. You can access on foot to any tourist site. In O'Connell Street almost all buses stop to go anywhere. Abundant and varied breakfast. 100% recommended Somewhat higher price per room night.,5,2018,10,15
231,Jurys Inn Dublin,Beautiful hotel in Parnel Square. Great location for shopping. Popular Murrays Pub around the corner. Comfortable rooms. Ice machine on every floor!! AC in every room. Walking distance to many attractions  or a short cab away. ,4,2018,10,15
231,Lovely stay in Jury's - Parnell street with my mother and sister.,"Every request was dealt with very efficiently from arrival to departure. Quiet room, close to lift etc - nothing was a problem. Our beds were very comfortable - because we requested a quiet room we were able to keep our window open and not be disturbed by traffic etc. Lovely hot shower. Great breakfast, very efficient staff assisting at breakfast. This hotel is brilliantly located and was ideal for us attending a performance in the Gate Theatre. Every single member of staff we encountered were superb and that, more than anything else is why I would recommend this experience to other people because you can have the best location, food etc but if don't have the staff....it's pointless.",5,2018,10,15
231,Over priced dated hotel and ruined clothes!!,"Having just left the hotel and paid £450 for 3 nights, I'm left incredibly appalled at the state of the hotel. It's very dated and needs some serious investment to bring it up to scratch. During our 2nd night througout the night I could here a dripping noise and was kept awake by it, little did I know it was in our room and above the clothes/hanging area. In the morning several items were soaking wet and an expensive Coat arm was soaking. This isn't rain water it's foul smelling old stale water so I'll now have a dry cleaning bill on top of several items that couldn't then be worn again I had to purchase things rather than wear dirty clothes. The reception desk weren't interested in my issue just that they'd send someone to look at it. That night guess what... drip drip drip drip luck i didn't have any more items of clothing that could be damaged. when leaving no apology, no how was your stay nothing. If you like overpriced dirty old dated hotels this is the place for you.",1,2018,10,15
231,"Good quality, very basic room","Stayed here for a few days visiting Dublin and surrounding areas. The hotel is very well situated and makes most of Dublin walkable, Temple Bar about 15 minutes’ walk. All the staff we came into contact with was very friendly and check-in and checkout very easy. We had a standard room which was very basic but clean and in good condition, room 446 which was a bit of a walk as it was nearly exactly the opposite side of the hotel to the lifts. Breakfast was buffet style and as with all buffets if you turn up at the wrong time after it has sat under heat lights could be dry but the do keep it toped up and regularly bring out fresh eggs, bacon ect. The hotel is literally just around the corner from the skycoach stop so easy to and from the airport. I did found the hotel expensive but this is a European city so it was to be expected, plenty of restaurants nearby with one just across the road which we never tried as we found some good ones in Temple Bar.   ",4,2018,10,15
231,Weekend break,Hotel was ok. Stayed in Dublin lots of times in different hotels and got same /better for a lot less. Recommended if the price s right. Location not too bad. Our room was on fifth floor and was very   quiet ,3,2018,10,14
231,Does what it needs to,"Comfy beds, helpful staff, good breakfast, decent location, rooms well equipped...does exactly what you'd expect to be honest.

Easy level walk to the centre, lots of places to eat nearby, taxi rank outside.",4,2018,10,14
231,Good value,"Nice hotel, room was good. Nothing exciting, I probably would stay closer in town, but it was an ok walk. The bartender was a kid that really had no idea what he was doing. The staff was very nice and helpful, they were the best part of the stay. I expected a little more.",3,2018,10,13
231,Generally very good,"We stayed here for two nights as somewhere simple and easy to stay for a city break - quite shocked (very pleasantly) by the level of customer service for the price point, it was almost, faultless.
On checking-in the Receptionist was very friendly and helpful. He casually asked during the check-in if we were here for any particular reason and we said that it’s my birthday today and here for that.  He disappeared and returned a few seconds later with a voucher for two free drinks “as a birthday present from us”.  He then spent a long time with a map showing us his personal favourite restaurants around the city.  As we were early, our room wasn’t ready, so we came back a couple hours later and were given our keys by another friendly Receptionist.
On reaching the room, we found balloons on the bed, another voucher for two glasses of bubbly, and a hand written birthday card.  A really lovely touch, and totally unexpected from a large corporation.
The room was very clean and freshly decorated.  
I’m allergic to feathers, so we had to call Reception to ask for a non-feathered duvet.  Within 10 minutes a lady was at our door to change it.  I didn’t catch her name, however she had a Lithuanian accent - again, very smiley, chatty and profusely wishing me a happy birthday.
A lady who answered the phone (possibly Polish accent) when we called to order room service dinners one evening was less than helpful, and unfortunately let the hotel staff down with a deliberately obstructive and dismissive ‘computer says no’ type of attitude that was not of the standard of other staff.
Overall though apart from her, the quality of customer service here has been very good.  Only other minor improvement would be the signal on the TV and WIFI being poor in our room. ",5,2018,10,13
231,Excellent stay,"More than happy to accomodate a large group of lads on a Stag weekend, Clean rooms, friendly staff willing to help, good location in the city centre, great place to stay in a great city! Look forward to visiting again.",5,2018,10,13
231,Wonderfully located but...,"Very good location. You are right in the Center of Dublin on walking distance. This are the pros together with a fair enough breakfast and a nice working wifi, About the room: it is small and the bathroom is even smaller. Not a very confortable piece of room I must say mainly if you have to work on it.",4,2018,10,13
231,Was this the same place?,"We chose this hotel based on reviews on Trip Advisor which has not failed us before, but we can only think that maybe we were reading reviews for some other property:  the breakfast was Motel 6, at best, nothing fresh and certainly not worth 12 euros; there were no amenities in the room other than a hair dryer and wifi; beds were small with poor mattresses; hotel was not near anything nor at the back door of the post office; the walls were very thin - not only could we hear everything that was said next door, but when someone moved next door our bed actually moved;   In their favor, front desk staff were very nice and tried to be accomdating. ",1,2018,10,13
231,Great!,"It was a wonderful stay!! Lore was extra helpful to my niece and myself, we had no trouble at check in or check out, they only thing was when I booked the parking was f no charge but we had to pay! So that was upsetting!",5,2018,10,12
231,Denise,"Central location close to shops bars and restaurant's  and walking distances to most places of interest. Staff are very accommodating, polite and friendly. Buffet breakfast was good with plenty of choice, we also ate in the bar area and the food was also good. The hotel is clean and fresh and would recommend this hotel which is approx. 30 mins from the airport.",5,2018,10,11
231,Great stay at Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street,"Great stay at Jurys Inn. Location is central to City Centre, able to walk to many attractions. Room was clean and comfortable. The restaurant within was very good, and there many other places to eat in the same block as the hotel. ",5,2018,10,10
231,Everything on hotel doorstep ,"Stayed on a Sunday night. On checking in we found out the concert we were to attend wasn’t going ahead. We were delighted in that case that we had chosen jury’s Parnell st. because it’s so close to great shops Penney’s Mary’s st. and Jervis and Ilac centres. Cinema and lots of eating options on your doorstep. Also only 5 mins walk from the abbey st. Luas stop. 
Hotel itself is basic but the beds were extremely comfortable and we both had a great nights sleep. 
Special mention to Lore on reception who has such a lovely manner and was very helpful. Also to the porter who kindly looked after our bags when we checked out so we didn’t have to drag them about when doing a last bit of shopping. 
Kingfisher cafe across the road does a great breakfast too ! ",5,2018,10,10
231,Dublin Holiday,"Excellent location, we walked to a lot of our sight seeing destinations. Fantastic breakfast buffet. Loved the duvet on the bed. Had some difficulty figuring out how to keep the lights on, was the first time we'd encountered that set up but it made good sense once we did. ",4,2018,10,09
231,Vacation tourist visit ,"Clean rooms and modern.
Pick one off the street to minimize noise.
Nice dining room for breakfast and dinner.
Good location, except O'Connell street is a little creepy at night.
Fitness center is minimalistic.

231,Perfect location.,"This hotel has the perfect location for anyone visiting Dublin! Within walking distance to most places within the city. Staff are all very friendly and professional. Rooms were very clean and to high standard, beds were very comfortable. Good variety of breakfast available to suit everyone's taste.
Would recommend to a friend.",5,2018,10,09
231,Excellent for a weekend in Dublin,"This friendly hotel with very helpful staff is well positioned for shops, sightseeing and nightlife. Comfortable beds, decent sized bedrooms, clean and well maintained.  Good breakfast, too! I would be happy to stay there again.",5,2018,10,09
231,Comfortable hotel outside the loud tourist zone,"North side of Dublin not as touristy as South side, for better or worse.  This hotel is only a 10 min walk to the Liffey and all the attractions (South side of city).  You'll find quicker times to and from airport from this location, too.",5,2018,10,09
231,"Jurys Inn Parnell St., Dublin","Overall, this hotel was great. It is a short walk to the Temple Bar area and even closer to the shopping district. It is right off O'Connell St., which is the main street into the downtown core. The rooms were clean and roomy, but if you have any difficulty walking you will need to ask for a room close to the elevator. The hotel is build as a square with a garden area in the middle. The rooms could mean a fair walk for yourself.Breakfast was good,with some hot options for a continental breakfast and for 10 euros, is probably a better option than trying to find a café or restaurant for the same price. There is no parking and , although they have a deal with a car parking area, it is 14 euros a night, which is quite expensive. We also stayed at the Jurys Inn in Cork and the prices were more reasonable. However, overall it was quite comfortable.",4,2018,10,09
231,"Great location, reasonable pricing",It's a perfect 3.5 star hotel. It was economical and convenient. We would return. Coffee in rooms was instant coffee which wasn't that great but there are cafes all over the place to grab and go. We enjoyed the bar area and the breakfast area for meeting up with our family. ,4,2018,10,09
231,"Great Hotel, Awesome Location","Jury's Inn is in a great location just minutes from O'Connell Street where all the action is. The staff are great and the rooms are great! Beds are really comfy. The only thing is there is no safe or mini fridge. That would of been nice to have. Other than that, I would highly recommend.",4,2018,10,09
231,"Good value, great location","Room was pretty basic but had everything we needed and was clean.  It's on the border between a great shopping area and a seedy ""don't go there"" area.  We stayed on the right side and had no problems at all.  Lots of restaurants in the area.  Breakfast was outstanding.  Employees were helpful.  Glad we stayed there and would do so again.",4,2018,10,09
231,Perfect for business,"I have stayed at the other Jury’s inn in Dublin but this one in Parnell street is far better situated for the city centreThe rooms were extremely quiet, clean and well equipped with plenty of power points . The hotel staff were welcoming and professional and there wasn’t a thing I could criticiseAs I said, perfect for business . If I were to be lucky enough to be in Dublin for a romantic weekend I would probably go for something more boutique like but for the business traveller it is perfect",5,2018,10,08
231,"Good location, friendly staff","This was a nice hotel with a great location to Center City and convenient for walking tours, sightseeing and transportation.  The breakfast was very good and considering what is in the a great choice and value.  The rooms were nice and clean as was the whole hotel.",5,2018,10,08
231,Ireland Vacation,"Room service was good everyday.  Breakfasts were excellent with hot full Irish breakfasts available or a great cold selection and a variety of juice, coffee, and milk.  Location was excellent for the Hop on Hop off bus and Airlink bus 747 to and from the airport.  Executive room was a nice size.",5,2018,10,08
231,Good hotel,"Very good hotel and a good locationGreat breakfast. Restaurant services good. Staff was very friendly .Location is very central and within walking distance of most downtown attractions. Plenty of nearby shopping, attractions, restaurants and bars.Hotel area is fine.",5,2018,10,08

231,Expensive and excellent,"Excellent location- close to O'Connell Steet and shops and eateries- most attractions and CCD are in walking distance, very friendly and helpful staff - handled our somewhat complicated booking really well, very good breakfast - good quality and qunantity, decent sized rooms, all amenities as expected.  No issues at all. Very pleased with our stay.  Prompt and helpful reponse to our email communications.",5,2018,10,07
231,Tired hotel,Hotel needs upgrading. Room smelled bad. Carpets are old. Restaurant was satisfactory. Cannot park easily in front of hotel to exit your vehicle with baggage. Good location to walk to city center amenities but walk to airport bus in the rain is somewhat long. Took a long time to check in.,2,2018,10,07
231,Magnificent staff and excellent location,"The location was fantastic with very quiet rooms and very comfortable beds. The bar was very good with a good range of drinks available. The food menu was also good and was of an extremely high standard. All the staff were magnificent, very friendly, welcoming and extremely helpful. Overall a thoroughly magnificent stay",5,2018,10,06
231,Decent hotel - good location,"Staff was very friendly.  Restaurant services good.  Location is very central and within walking distance of most downtown attractions.  Plenty of nearby shopping, attractions, restaurants and bars.  Rooms are good, however stayed in two sections of the hotel, and one section is definitely better.  Hotel area is fine, but not too distant from undesirable areas. ",5,2018,10,06
231,Nice location,"From Dublin airport you can catch the 747 outside the airport, after buying a return ticket from the outside booths for twelve euros. If you let the bus driver know which hotel you are staying at as you get on he will give you a shout at your nearest stop. For the jurys inn the stop is only a few minutes away. 
Very easy check in at the hotel. We were offered an executive room for an extra twenty euros per night. We didn't take it but perks of an upgrade included slightly later check out. Coffee express machine and a larger bed.
Our room was a standard one. It was clean but signs of a little wear and tear.
Fabulous breakfast .....would definitely recommend.  Cereals,  pastries, fruits, yogurts, jams and breads. On top of an all you can eat bacon, sausages,  eggs, fried and scrambled,  black pudding, beans , fresh tomatoes and small diced potatoes. Tea, coffee and fresh orange juice.
The hotel is about 15mins walk to the temple bar area. Surrounded by shops, bars and eating out places.
We found prices in temple bar had gone up from last year.  A pint of Guinness and A pink gin and tonic.....18 euros!! I kid you not.  Amazing  atmosphere so despite the high prices worth a look.
Overall good hotel and nice location.",4,2018,10,05
231,Comfortable Stay,"Jurys Inn in Parnell Street is conveniently located to Dublins attractions. Jurys Inn is a comfortable and clean hotel. The staff are very attentive and cheerful. Despite its busy location, the rooms are quiet . The hotel dining options are excellent. We had bistro meals quite late and breakfast consisted of a broad selection of options.",5,2018,10,05
231,Our 2 night stay in Dublin,"Hotel did not meet our expectations, no parking, no clock in room, table only one chair very small bathroom with limited supplies. Staff were friendly, rooms were clean and breakfast was great, however we expected more for the price.",3,2018,10,05
231,Nice hotel in Dublin,"Jurys Inn, Parnell Str, is a very nice 3 star hotel in Dublin. Very friendly staff. Normal size of the room although I would have preferred more space instead of the extra bed. The cleaning was very good. Many choices for breakfast and the breakfast room was big enough for many guests. The bar was ok for a coffee or something else to drink. Not many choices of wine. 
No refrigerator in the room but the friendly staff installed one immediately. No safe-box in the room, we used one in the reception. A minus. Nice bathroom but as always too little space for personal things. And I don’t understand why there are bathrooms without a hand-shower. But the shower was easy to understand and good construction so no water on the floor. 
I can recommend this hotel. On the north side near the Spire, shopping, buses, trams and trains. Only a short walk to Temple Bar and Grafton Street.",4,2018,10,05
231,Amazing staff,"I came into this hotel at 4 am because I was locked out of my airbnb the man at the reception desk, Brendan, was so amazing he found me a room for the night. My phone was dead and a woman at the front desk offered her charger to me. This has been a great experience and the room of course was lovely but the staff is what makes this hotel so amazing. ",5,2018,10,05
231,The jurys still out...,"Stayed at the Jurys inn parnell street for two nights with my wife.

Clean rooms with minimum fuss, cleaned daily.

Great location close to o’Connell street and within walking distance of temple bar and other sites 

Had a nice room, however it overlooked a council cleaning facility of some sort which with the window open was slightly noisy. Did have aircon unit thought in the room.

The service at the front desk is mixed depending who is on, wouldn’t suggest they were overly helpful.

Overall clean hotel with good ammenities and good location.

However feel it is overpriced and overhyped for what you receive.",3,2018,10,04
231,Jurys to Jurys ,"Having come from the jury’s inn chelt I can honestly say this one has set the bench mark. Staff upon arrival were lovely. Emilia particularly remembered my friend and made us feel very welcome throughout our stay. Went to the bar for a drink and food. Simon caught our eye and went above and beyond making us feel welcome and ensured the quality of the food and drink was okay. Had dinner in the restaraunt on the second night and food was fantastic. 2 girls in the restaurant (forgot names) but both were lovely and friendly. David who was in charge that night made us feel very welcome and spent time to chat with us. 
Hotel rooms spacious and clean! Overall excellent experience! We will be back Dublin :)",5,2018,10,03
231,Very Good Location,"We enjoyed our three night stay here.  It's in a convenient location - within walking distance to the GPO Museum, stores, restaurants, and the LUAS tram on O'Connell Street.  We walked a little further - maybe a 15 minute walk to - EPIC museum and Trinity College. We ate breakfast and dinner every day in the restaurant and found the food to be very good with many choices available.  The staff was friendly, professional, courteous, and very helpful.",5,2018,10,03
231,Above and beyond,The staff were absolutely lovely. They couldn’t do enough and went above and beyond to make sure my stay was a good one. The food in the restaurant was great as was the breakfast. The rooms are comfortable but it’s the staff that really make this place. ,5,2018,10,03
231,DUBlN ALONE,"Jurys Inn is central to all in Dublin. The breakfasts will fill you up for all your activities. Excellent room refreshing, paper in the morning, luggage storage and laundry service. Very helpful staff. ",5,2018,10,02
231,Nice hotel - Nice Bar Area - Could have used more counter space in the bathroom. Maids need to prop open doors when clea,Nice hotel - Nice bar area - Good Breakfast Buffet - Maids need to prop open doors vs slamming them each time they went in and out. If you are a light sleeper choose the back rooms not the ones facing the street.,4,2018,10,02
231,Weekend Tourist,"Great location on Parnell Street five minutes walk to river and bridge over to main attractions. Great buffet breakfast, friendly helpful staff, clean basic rooms with toiletries provided. Easy access to and from airport with bus stop a couple of minutes walk away. ",5,2018,10,02
231,An excellent choice,"We booked online and were happy when we arrived that it met our every need.  It is well located in Dublin and extremely accessible to tour buses as well as city buses.  It is not at all elegant or decorated, but it has everything you could want and is attractive while very practical.  The staff was amazingly helpful and knowledgeable about tourist things.  The best rooms are the executive rooms -- I would suggest staying in one of these tho they cost a little more -- in fact, we found it expensive for what we considered a ""regular"" small American-style room.  We liked it so much we stayed there again at the end of our trip.",5,2018,10,02
231,"Nice hotel, good location","This Jury's Inn was a nice hotel.  I have to say the bedding/linens were extremely comfortable and the hotel room was quiet at night.  The room was a bit small, but most hotels in Dublin are the same.  There's a restaurant and bar on the 2nd floor and the breakfast was fine.  The location is nicely walkable to the city center as well as a nearby LUAS stop (trolley car).  The only slightly negative thing I could say is the bar staff at night were not very good.  They weren't proper bartenders but looked like maybe borrowed from the kitchen staff and not very organized.",4,2018,10,02
231,3 night business trip ,"I spent 3 nights at the hotel last week. I thought it was great for someone who needed a comfortable bed to get a good nights sleep after busy meeting days. Good pillows, good bed, good sleep. Would book again.",4,2018,10,02
231,Great location for shops and Temple Bar.,"Came to Dublin for my boyfriend's 35th birthday. Easy check in, got my key card that said ""the key to happiness"" I thought ok, whatever. Opened the door and there were balloons, a slice of cake, some chocolates and a card! Certainly made us smile!! 

The hotel is very conveniently located, close to supermarkets (literally around the corner and across the road). And around the corner from the main shopping area. It's also really close walk to Temple Bar area. 

The walls are quite thin so I did hear the next door room snoring. And the beds are not comfortable for me, but I'm used to my memory foam mattress at home, so this one did give me a sore back. The bathroom is not that modern but does the job. 

I would stay again for the convenient location if it was a short trip.",4,2018,10,02
231,Dharshan - Jurys Inn Parnell Street,The service was excellent. Staff were extremely helpful and very pleasant. We had absolutely no problems at all. Both check in and check out was extremely quick. Very well located with easy access to most amenities. Numerous restaurants and shopping malls within walking distance. Access to transport including hop on - hop off were very convenient.,5,2018,10,02

231,"Good location, comfortable hotel","Really nice, helpful and smiley staff - it makes such a difference. Location is excellent for Go Dublin trips which I cant rate highly enough. Outside was slightly rough, but didnt cause us any worry. Also good for eating out. Comfortable, clean room, all was very good, no complaints, nice breakfast, too, again helpful staff. ",5,2018,10,01
231,Nightmare,"Myself and a colleague were due to stay at Jurys Inn Parnell Street for one night on Thursday 27th September. Upon arrival we were told ourselves and a number of other guest's did not have a room as the hotel had been overbooked.  While angry, we know mistakes can happen but the hotel we were moved to was what I would describe as student accommodation. Upon complaining to the Jury's Inn they wanted nothing to do with it. Hotel itself looked nice, though I've been scarred from this experience and will make sure my company prioritises other hotels in the area.",1,2018,10,01
231,Convenient location,We stayed at the Jury Inn the last night of our trip to Ireland. We were able to walk to the Temple Bar area and easily drove to the airport the next morning. The room was basic but comfortable. The staff was very helpful.,4,2018,10,01
231,Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street,"Everything about the hotel was great.  The location in relation to the city and it’s various neighbourhoods was terrific.  The only possible downside is that the hotel’s immediate area is in need of revitalization (abandoned buildings-some homelessness) This is not the fault of the hotel and I must add that we were not bothered or approached by any locals in a negative way at night or any other time and we walked everywhere. A block or less away, the abandoness ends. Hotel staff is very friendly and rooms were clean.  Very good value for money.  We would stay here again.",5,2018,10,01
231,Lovely and central location,"This hotel was absolutely one of the best we've stayed in. Clean, warm, welcoming and located in the middle of everything. You can walk to restaurants, bars, museums, shops, parks and a train station. They had a great bar and restaurant on-site as well. The room was clean and a good size for the price. My only suggestion would be to please ask the housekeeping staff to be quiet in the mornings.Some people like to sleep late while on vacation...",5,2018,10,01
231,Excellent Staff,"Great location - all Dublin’s central attractions are an easy walk. Staff was able to give us a very early check in on a Monday morning, which was much appreciated after our red eye flight. Good food options on the same block. Quiet and clean, and a reasonable rate. Definitely recommended.",5,2018,09,30
231,Excellent stay!,"Staff freindly, amazing location and what a great, rare treat to find gluten free food so well labelled. The staff could not have done more to have improved our stay! When I asked for an allergy free pillow it was no problem at all. They immediately brought two to my room and asked if I needed any thing else. I said I would prefer fresh milk in the room and this was also brought immediately.",5,2018,09,30
231,"Great Inn, Good Location","I was only in Dublin for 1 night but this Inn was a good walking location for touring Dublin.The rooms are clean and quiet, the bed was very comfortable. All of the staff I met was courteous and very helpful.",5,2018,09,29
231,Good stay,"Only a one night stay but room was lovely, got a very warm welcome on arrival. A lovely hotel, the only reason I would potentially not return is because it was quite expensive for my budget, although it was nice for a treat",5,2018,09,28
231,"Good location, friendly staff, perfect stay :)","Very happy with the Hotel. It's located just two Walking minutes from Shoppingstreet Henry/Mary Street. Friendly staff, nice, big rooms. Reception staff was always very helpful and friendly. We will come back for sure!",5,2018,09,26
231,Good stay,I didn’t spend 10€ to buy breakfast so I just went down the street to grab a quick bite in the morning. When asking staff where is a good place to eat they recommended the place across the street and that was it. It was good food but I enjoy when staff ask a few questions back about what type of atmosphere we are looking for or cuisine type. That way they can spread their knowledge of the surroundings onto the guests. The bed was a bit hard where we didn’t get a great night sleep but still an average one. Hotel was in an amazing location and walking distance to a lot of amenities and attractions. ,4,2018,09,26
231,Intruder at midnight,The hotel is centrally located and our room was spacious however the hotel gave another person our room key due to a error on their system and as a result we got a rude awakening at midnight. We had even locked the door from the inside but the lock was broken. Staff knew about the incident and made no attempt to apologise until we complained. ,3,2018,09,25
231,Perfect location,Very friendly staff. Nice convienient hotel. I found it a quiet room on the fourth floor.Centre of Dubin. Luas across the road that brings you to Grafton Street. Right beside Centra food store. Shopping centre right beside that.,5,2018,09,25
231,Well located but not cheap,The hotel is well situated at the top of O’Connell Street and most places are easily within walking distance. The new Luis line is very close and the bus to the airport less than 200 yards away. There is a Tesco right opposite where you can buy anything you may have forgotten to bring with you,4,2018,09,25
231,Fabulous stay,We stayed here for five nights great rooms clean and well decorated. The beds are so comfy which after a busy day of sightseeing and sampling the famous Guinness or whisky is needed. The hotel does breakfast for a set price and it’s totally worth it there’s so much selection and the food is so tasty it’s worth it. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful and the cleaning staff are second to none. I would definitely recommend a stay it’s close enough to everything but not right in temple area so you don’t have any of that noise it’s a five minute walk away. ,5,2018,09,25
231,Great location!!!,"This is a great location for doing anything in the city or getting to transportation, many options! 15 minute taxi ride from Dublin Airport. 12 minute walk to Temple Bar or Trinity College areas. Transportation/Walking options are great from this hotel!! The food was decent, not amazing but decent! The rooms don’t have safes, mini-fridges or microwaves.  I found it hard as a solo traveler to eat all my food at restaurants. I often stuffed myself as much as I could or ordered small items I finished, but didn’t make a proper meal knowing there was no way to store my food. Great location and clean enough! Basic hotel with a great staff and even better location!!!",4,2018,09,24
231,Nice central hotel in Dublin,"Check in was quick and informative. Room a good size but not a great view! Location was very central but a little quirky. Sad that Dublin seems to have a homeless problem too. There was a Lidl, Tesco and shopping mall close to the hotel and it was in walking distance to the centre. Bed was very comfortable and clean except for long black hairs in the bathroom...not nice. We had a very nice dinner in the bar one night and the breakfast was very nice too with a great selection. Housekeeping didn't do a good job of replenishing the coffee tray and when we called reception to request fresh milk one morning we gave up after 30 minutes.",3,2018,09,24
231,My Review,"Had a very nice stay. the food, the staff, the drinks were all amazing. The Breakfast was amazing aswel, waking up to that when your dying of a hangover was exactly what you needed. The only fault i would say was we had to wait 20-30 mins for a room as they were so busy and at that we ended up with a disability room not the one we booked but it did us grand. Would definitely come back!",5,2018,09,24
231,Convenient location!,"The rooms were a bit pricy. The breakfast was average, it was ok though given the prize ! It was a bit noisy when luggage were pulled in the corridor. Nice and clean room. All in all we had a good staying. ",4,2018,09,24
231,A good night’s sleep and a good start to the day,"Comfortable bed with lots of pillows
Spacious room, but bathroom looking a bit dated
Very good breakfast buffet with all the makings of a great Full Irish
A good night’s sleep and a good start to the day",4,2018,09,24
231,Wonderful staff,"Wonderful staff, comfortable and quiet accommodations, and great location.  And the need to have a minimum of 200 characters is not necessary.  Your need for 200 characters does not support your claim of a quick survey. I suspect this requirement has been put in place by the survey company.  All that aside, my review of Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street is not affected by this requirement.",5,2018,09,23
231,Comfortable and convenient,"We stayed for three nights at the Jurys Inn on Parnell Street and enjoyed it very much. The hotel is modern and well located for getting to the visitor attractions in Dublin, being a couple of minutes from O'Connell Street. It is also close to where the Airlink Express Coach no. 747 from the airport has a stop. 
Our room was clean and comfortable and of decent size; it was also quiet. We did have an issue with the shower in which we couldn't regulate the temperature, and were offered another room when we reported it. We were also told it would be repaired but it wasn't while we we there. We didn't take up the option of a different room as there was a bath as an alternative.
We really enjoyed the breakfast; good quality food and loads of choice.
Staff were unfailingly friendly; this hotel is a good option for stays in Dublin.",4,2018,09,20
231,Lovely stay,"Stayed here for 3 nights, very nice size room and bathroom. The perfume (?) smell at the lobby is horribly unwelcoming though. It triggered my asthma anytime I walked through the main door! Really don’t know what is the point of it. Smells as if they were trying to mask a decomposing dead body 🙈🙈🙈",5,2018,09,20
231,Great hotel,"The hotel was lovely. Wonderful service and helpful employees. The restaurant breakfast buffet surpassed our expectations. The location was great, close to city transportation and within walking distance to most of the sights we wanted to see.",5,2018,09,19
231,Great Location,"Located on a bustling corner in the City, the location is fantastic with a grocery store, fashion retail shops, and plenty of good restaurants nearby.  It is a standard hotel, with a bar on the second floor, room service, and appears to accommodate business travelers.  The staff was very friendly and the desk was always staffed. Rooms are spacious, quiet, and appointed with everything you need to make a hot beverage, there is a hair dryer, iron, shower products, and the bathrooms do feature tubs.  Upon entering our room, it was musty and the decor was in need of a refresh, but it was exactly what we needed for the night before continuing our journey.  There is a popular restaurant across the street, a coffee shop around the corner, and a bakery with enticing donuts just down the sidewalk.",3,2018,09,19
231,100% no complaints,From the time we 4 ladies checked in at reception everything was tops.Our two twin rooms  very comfortable  and we had the 2 twin rooms  beside each other As on of the ladies in my group was 84 and the other 93 the waitress did table service for breakfast.,5,2018,09,19
231,Perfect location for some days in Dublin.,"Spent 3 nights as this hotel, and was surprised how centrally it was. 5-10 min walk from Tempel Bar area.
Very nice rooms, fantastic beds and a service minded staff. A very pleasant stay. Recommended!",5,2018,09,19
231,Hotel was overbooked and ruined my trip,"I booked 3 rooms at the Jury's Inn 3 months before our trip and we prepaid for the rooms. When we arrived at the hotel to check in, we were told that they overbooked the hotel and we would not be able to stay there. Instead of finding us a comparable hotel to stay at, they placed us at an old, run down 3 star hotel a few blocks away. This was an extremely disappointing experience as we had spent hours doing research to find the perfect hotel that met all of our needs. I had less than 48 hours to enjoy Dublin and it was very frustrating to have to spend hours during my time there fighting with the hotel front desk and on the phone with Orbitz trying to resolve this situation. Steer clear of this hotel as it seems to be their policy to overbook which shows that all they care about is money and they place little value in their customers comfort and happiness.",1,2018,09,19
231,Great hotel in Dublin,A welcome surprise to find the hotel had available rooms for last minute trip. They had a Lovely staff and Great bed and towels. The coffee set up was a little awkward but we appreciated having coffee in the room. ,5,2018,09,19
231,Did not Disappoint,"Warm welcome from helpful reception staff who directed us to a pleasant room overlooking Dublin.  The room had air-con, tea/coffee tray, good free wifi, comfortable bed and desk.  No frig, no safe.  We asked for and were given a second chair, which was much appreciated.  The bathroom was an adequate size, shower over bath with a grab rail.
Breakfast was excellent, good choice, well presented and a fair price, discounted if booked the evening before.  Once booked, there are no refunds.
There are a few restaurants close to the hotel.  We ate at Kingfisher seafood restaurant (delicious), a Vietnamese in Parnell St, the other side of O’Connell St (also delicious) and the pub adjacent to the 1916 “surrender house” (adequate).  The hotel does offer evening meals.
The hotel is a short walk to the start of the hop-on, hop-off bus tours and the Yellow Umbrella “Free” Walking Tours in O’Connell St and a few minutes more to cross the bridge to Trinity College and Temple Bar. 
When we booked and Jurys Inn Parnell St seemed to offer better value close to the city, than most Dublin hotels.  We were very happy with our choice.",4,2018,09,18
231,Stay & Meals,We thought the cost of hotel was expensive for September 2018 as we stayed February 2018 nearly half the cost what we paid including breakfast we thought the venue was excellent for our needs and meals breakfast and evening dinner was excellent value for money.,5,2018,09,18
231,A very HAPPY Mary from Sydney Australia,Great location...lovely staff..very clean...home from home really!Gustav treated us to a drink ...when I told him it was our 25th Wedding Anniversary...Patrick the Manager wished us well on our travels ..a very personable young man!,5,2018,09,18
231,"Lovely Hotel, would recommend",The staff in this hotel were lovely at from a slightly jaded bar man but he can be excused.  The rooms could do with some jazzing up but the bed linen and pillows were amazing.  Would like to see some toiletries in the bathroom but had the basic shower gel and shampoo/conditioner but would have liked to see more.   Ordered breakfast to my room and got 4 ! poached eggs which were amazing. The front of house staff were amazing and the reception was covered all night and guardedd so you felt protected.  Will be using again. ,4,2018,09,18
231,Good modern hotel in central Dublin.,"Enjoyed our long weekend in Dublin. The hotel was in a great location, very clean and comfortable with a delicious breakfast. Dublin is a very busy city so it's best to book ahead for the most popular attractions. Don't miss the Guiness Storehouse. The epic museum is also very good.",5,2018,09,17
231,Good hotel but didn’t sleep well,"Stayed for 3 nights for business, unfortunately someone set the fire alarms off on my second night so didn’t get good sleep. Once dressed made way downstairs then alarms turned off. Unfortunately a shop in Parnell Street then went off for a few hours.. so don’t recommend room 212 which is in the corner by Moore street. Room was generally ok otherwise. 
Breakfast was very good quality, as always with Jury’s hotels (and many other hotels) you get the smallest glass for Orange juice, so need to take two. Just wish they gave a normal size as a choice. 
Staff were friendly and would stay again if room was not at front or side of hotel.",4,2018,09,17
231,Weekend in Dublin,"My stay was lovely. Location is city center. Was very pleased with the service- from beginning to end. Staff was knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. Had dinner in the hoteland the breakfast was terrific.",5,2018,09,17
231,Great location and hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights great  location
Rooms good size.
Trames and buses outside.
Close to city and bars. Will come back.
Breakfast fab.room service very good.
All shops near by.and all bus trips.checking in little slow.",5,2018,09,17
231,Last night in Dublin,"We stayed at the Jurys Inn on Parnell Street our last night in Ireland.  After a trip around the country staying at a castle and lovely hotels in Kinsale and Kilarney we ended at the Jury Inn.  The hotel is very dated, rooms are old and need updating.  We did not like the location as it is on the otherside of river.  When we started our trip we stayed near Trinity which is a much better location.",3,2018,09,17
231,Really well located in Dublin!,"Great room (clean and cozy), great food (a lot of choice) for breakfast and good service (the person at the reception guided us before we asked him). I recommend. Room was ready even if we arrived before noon.                                              ",4,2018,09,17
231,Great staff!!,"The front desk staff were very accommodating and responsive.  We were early check ins from a 7:30am flight arrival.  The room was clean and comfortable.   The hotel location was far enough from city center sites to be quiet but close enough to walk to.  Breakfast was a simple buffet, but just right.  ",4,2018,09,16
231,"Great location, friendly staff","I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights, in September. The location is perfect for tourists and business travellers alike, less than 5min walk from the aircoach station, and the hop on hop off bus station, where all buses for the excursions leave as well. Hotel very quiet and very clean, comfortable beds. A good selection of continental and full English breakfast. On the day we left early in the morning in an excursion, they supplied a bag of breakfast to take away. Staff very friendly at reception, check in was quick. They were very helpful with all questions we had, helped us to print our boarding passes. I would like to mention the one lady from reception, I think her name was Lore, she was particularly helpful and friendly. I would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,09,16
231,A good base for a city break,"We spent 3 nights in an executive room and were completely satisfied with all the facilities.  Breakfast was always excellent with a very efficient buffet system.  Close to bus and tram routes and only a 15 minute walk from Connolly railway station, this is a good centralised location for touring.  The front desk staff, some of whom are multilingual, were excellent in every way.",5,2018,09,16
231,"2 Nights in Dublin nice location, shame about the price 7 star price.",I was ripped off and double charged at check-in because the staff said I had only booked for one night. The hotel is expensive for what you get. It's in a good location and that's the best part about it. Staff should discourage vagrants from the front of the hotel at the main entrance it's very off putting. The hotel should be honest with clients when booking the hotel stay and clearly state there is no on site car parking. Car parking is off site but it's chargeable with only a modest discount offered when you show the reception your ticket before leaving the location.,1,2018,09,16
231,Poor value for money. Not worth it.,"We had booked an executive room for 3 nights and it was not available for the first night. The standard room was equivalent to a 2 star hotel. there were no bathroom amenities apart from soap, something I expected in a 4 start hotel and executive suite so I did not bring the basics as I expected them to be provided. The hotel did give us vouchers for breakfast first they offered only 2 days but we asked for 3 days. We usually have light breakfast and we had booked it with out room. In summary. The general facilities were also disappointing, the lobby is very poor, the only good thing about this hotel is the position but we will look for other options next time we go to Dublin.",3,2018,09,15
231,Soap,Great location to reach meeting places for day trips. Really need to use individual toiletries instead of multi use pumps that can’t be reached if taking a bath. Free coffee in the lobby would have been nice,4,2018,09,14
231,"Expensive, good location but food poor","I was shocked at the hotel prices in Dublin in general.  Although the staff are welcoming, helpful and friendly, and my room/bed was very comfortable, the food was very poor quality.  So overall I would rate this hotel as expensive for what it was, and that you are paying for location.",3,2018,09,14
231,"Jurys inn, a good spot","This hotel has a fantastic breakfast. Really, really great selection and quality. The rooms are average and could be cleaned better to be honest. But overall nice. The bed I slept in was excellent. Overall a god hotel in a convenient location. Several great pubs within 2 blocks. ",4,2018,09,14
231,Good stay,"Good starting location for nearby sightseeing. Friendly staff and very informative sightseeing informations. Versatile and good breakfast. Big clean and nice rooms. Enjoyed our stay at the hotel, very nice and friendly.   ",5,2018,09,13
231,short breK IN DUBLIN,"On arrival at hotel the reception staff were friendly helpful and efficient. The accommodation was very good, and the breakfasts excellent. Lots of choice, and always fresh and well presented.Would have no hesitation in recommending hotel to friends and family.",5,2018,09,13
231,Nice hotel,Stayed here for four nights in July.Its a good hotel.Staffs were really helpful and polite.Room was good and spacious.Plus point about this hotel is its location.Easy transportation to and from airport and also to get around Dublin.Overall a good hotel and would definitely stay here again.,4,2018,09,11
231,Jochen,"The location was very good, excellent breakfast, brilliant service. Missed a safe and a little fridgein the room and the bed was for a tall man (188cm) a little bit to small.Otherwise very satisfied, nice and quiet with fitness center close to the room.",4,2018,09,11
231,Short stay in Dublin,"Lovely hotel for our short stay in Dublin. We were able to check in early and catch a nap before sightseeing. Clean. Quiet, beautiful room. Airport bus dropped us off a 3 minute walk to the hotel located centrally to everything. Surprise to find the next little street had fruit and veggie vendors, a nice bakery restaurant and a big surprise was a great mall for shopping. Even a library there. Very close to the main office for the Big Green Bus which we also took advantage of by going on it twice in one day.",5,2018,09,10
231,"Great place, great location","Jurys Inn Parnell Street was a great hotel - we got two rooms, one for my folks (with a view of Parnell Street) and a twin room for me and my brother (facing the nondescript interior courtyard). Rooms were clean and comfortable, though the twin felt a little cramped. Bathroom was good sized and clean and modern. The breakfast bar was excellent - a wide selection of hot and cold breakfast items catering to almost every taste. The location is great for exploring central Dublin - it's walkable to so many central Dublin locations on both sides of the river. However, driving to/from this location is a big pain in the butt for people not familiar with driving in Dublin. GPS may bring you to the location, but if you're on the wrong side of the street, you will have to go around a big block to be able to turn around to get back to the proper side of the street to their turnout. Their car park is in a nice structure a few blocks away, which takes a little bit of time to figure out how to easily reach, esp if your car is at the hotel entrance, facing the wrong way from the direction of the parking structure. Parking was 14/day with the hotel discount.",5,2018,09,10
231,"Excellent hotel, close to all the sights","We enjoyed our stay in the Jurys Inn, Parnell Street, on this our 2nd visit to Dublin.  Free wi-fi was helpful as we had problems with our ferry booking, the choice of TV channels was excellent - though I would have preferred another BBC1 region, as we come from the London area!  Good sized bathroom, and excellent choice of food at breakfast.  We also ate in the restaurant one evening.",5,2018,09,10
231,Dublin brilliant city Jury's Inn not so!,"Lets start with the good points the bed, pillows and quilt were very comfortable. Now the negatives there was no safe in the room apparently you only get a safe in an executive suite!!! There are safes in reception but I did not want to use them as in the foyer and visible for everyone to see!  There was no fridge in the room! yet plenty of room for one to be installed. After check out I asked where the toilet was to be told it was on the 2nd floor to which I said do I need a key fob to get up to the 2nd floor as to access the lift you need a key card I was told no the lifts go to the 2nd floor without a fob. Finally I get up to the toilets to find a key card lock on the toilets!!! I then had to go find a member of staff to give me a card to get into the toilet seems ridiculous for a toilet. I do not think the room was worth the amount charged quite out of date and not in the best area. I will not return to this hotel in future. Oh and the view from the room was a rubbish tip!",3,2018,09,10
231,"Excellent hotel, very close to everything","Location is key for this hotel.  It is around the corner from the 747 bus stop.  There are also at least 3 supermarkets nearby, so it would be easy to get supplies.  And of course, there are many restaurants and pubs as well (Murray's down the street has great live music every night!).  We walked everywhere including to the riverfront and Trinity College.  Great spread at breakfast as well.  All in all, highly recommended",5,2018,09,09
231,Would not stay again,"The hotel location is great, centrally located and you can easily walk to many areas of interest.  They also have a very good breakfast buffet which was included in the price.

However those are the few positives I can say.

Our room was so small it bordered on being claustrophobic.  No one explained when we checked in that we not only had to use our room key to operate the lift but also to work lighting in the room (perhaps this was in paperwork in the room but it should have been highlighted on checking in.

We could not adjust the thermostat in our room and when staff came they adjusted it with head of a writing pen and then told us, w/o apologies, that that is what we would need to use each time we adjusted heat.  The temperature of the shower water alternated between scalding hot and ice cold with little ability to adjust adequately.

Lastly there was no designated concierge to assist with questions about directions, tours etc.  although some desk staff were helpful others were not helpful and some seemed irritated that we were asking for assistance.

Dublin itself was a good experience with friendly people and good tour guides but I never again will stay at this hotel.

",2,2018,09,09
231,Good place to stay in downtown Dublin,"Quiet bar, decent self-serve breakfast, helpful staff all around. Parnell Street near O'Connell in the thick of things. The Jurys Inn is a  quiet, clean place to stay. Go for it, you won't be sorry, you'll be comfortable. ",4,2018,09,08
231,Dublin Parnell Street,"Jury’s Inn Parnell Street sadly didn’t justify the amount charged. The bathrooms looked like hospital bathrooms, with mould on the doorframe and poor decor.This hotel sadly seems to value money more than it’s guests.",1,2018,09,08
231," Celebration Vacation ","Location !”
10 day stay and could not be happier. Room was clean, bed was comfortable, small fridge in room, perfect to keep water cold. Very nice to have coffee maker in room, and bottled water supplied everyday. Booked with breakfast everyday. Great value, full Irish breakfast buffet and abundant other choices. The entire staff cheerful and helpful. Lore at check in, housekeeping, the entire dining staff. Location perfect.",4,2018,09,08
231,Walkable Dublin option,"PROS/FOR:
Excellent location (Parnell+O'Connell streets), walkable to all locations throughout the city.
Friendly and helpful staff.
Coffee and Tea making provisions
Housekeeping respects DND signs. Average housekeeping noise [3 Bulls of 5; still many cart door slams]

CONS/AGAINST:
For the price, I think it's overvalued. However, this might [also] be the case for other hotels in Dublin during the summer.
A comfortable room, but not overly impressive.
Three pump-style body-wash and shampoo toiletries [only].
No in-shower shelf for personal toiletries
Door jambs are tight, causing hard door slams.

NEUTRAL:
Nightly, loud street voices occur sometime after midnight, but lasting only a few minutes. They're not enough to wake you if you're sleeping, but may cause concern if you're [already] awake.

SUGGESTIONS:

231,Centrally located hotel with excellent breakfast selection,"We checked in at the Jurys' Inn late morning, however upon requesting early check in, it was not available until 1-1/2 hrs. No problem!  We had lunch across the street at Kingfishers and our room was ready. But when checking on the room, noticed was a bit on the run down side. I understand this a very popular hotel as it was packed and no vacancy whatsoever, but perhaps the owners should do some room remodeling and update it, with more USB and/or charging stations which were lacking. The bathroom needs to be updated as the bath tub floor ,since it's very slippery, so you have to be very careful.  
The real star of our stay is the breakfast which is abundant and excellent selections, even including gluten free options. We had dinner during our first evening as it was raining(how rare....), and the food was surprisingly good, specially the mussels in tomato sauce and paprika were awesome, as it was the breaded halloumi cheese bites for appetizers.  The hotel is centrally located and one of the few that it has a good price including breakfast.  Temple Bar was a 20 min walk, via Moore Street(careful there in the evening) or via O'Connell Street in order to get to Trinity College and other sights.",4,2018,09,08
231,"Clean, comfortable and well located","Early check in was available, which was fabulous. We had a twin room, it was a good size with a large bathroom. Breakfast was included and was plentiful with lovely service. We easily located the hotel, using the Airbus from the airport and a short walk to Jury’s. We also found a number of yummy restaurants near the hotel. Well located for the full Dublin experience but far enough away from the madness to get a good nights sleep.",5,2018,09,06
231,Vacation in Dublin/Ireland,"A highly recommendable hotel in the (near) centre of Dublin.Service is fine, there is a good atmosphere and the rooms (we have stayed in two occasions during August) are nice and clean.   The hotel is close to Henry Street that has a fine shopping area and it is also close to the bus stop on O'Connell street for the busses going to Dublin Airport.",5,2018,09,06
231,Great stay!,"Arrived to the hotel - rooms very clean and was ready prior to the nornal checkin, which was very helpful.   We had a standard double room which was big enough for the two of us travelling. Over our trip we stayed at Jurys in dublin, galway and glasgow. Highly rated!",5,2018,09,05
231,Great Dublin hotel in great location,"This Jurys was a great stay for my wife and I on our 4 day Dublin vacation. Short walk down O'Connell street to all the main attractions. Staff and hotel was very nice, clean, bar and restaurant very nice.",5,2018,09,04
231,Great stay,Enjoyed the breakfast and location.  Near Henry St for shopping and a few wonderful pubs for entertainment.  Rooms were comfortable and hotel staff very accommodating.  Conveniently located close to the tour bus terminal.,5,2018,09,04
231,very good choice,"99% pleased. Great location... close to everything. There were 5 of us in 3 rooms for 2 nights. Rooms were a bit small, as were the bathrooms, but still about average for European hotels. Tried twice to call the reception desk from our room, but couldn't get an answer... guess they were too busy. We had to leave early on Saturday morning to get to the airport... that's when we found out that weekend breakfast is delayed 1/2 hour, so 3 of us ended up pre-paying for a breakfast that we couldn't wait for... that was a serious disappointment as our Friday breakfast was excellent. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2018,09,04
231,Great location and excellent breakfast,"Very friendly and helpful staff. Great location, you can walk to everywhere. Room was little for four person, air condition was no so effective. Breakfast was excellent. Maybe the best porridge I ever had in hotel. Lot of fresh vegetables and fruits. Healthy choices like smoothies etc. Nice atmosphere in breakfast room. Fresh apples available too in lift lobby.",4,2018,09,04
231,Good Location,A hotel with friendly staff and a very good location with O'Connell street around the corner. Waking distance to Temple bar. The breakfast was good with everything that you needed. I can recommend this hotel.,3,2018,09,04
231,Excellent value and location,Great location near the buses in O'Connell Street and surrounded by restaurants and supermarkets. The Kingfisher restaurant across the road was excellent. The staff were very helpful and the breakfast options were plentiful. The car park is only about a 10 minute walk away and you can get a discount for this from Reception.,5,2018,09,04
231,"Good location, good value.","Met some friends who were already booked here.  Street was a little busy, but location was very good.  Better than the airport hotel we stayed in recently, for sure!  Basic hotel.Our room smelled like it had been a smoking room very recently!",5,2018,09,03
231,Within Walking Distance to Everything,"We loved it here. It's within walking distance to the Luis tram and the bus hub on O'Connel street. Very centrally located. Nice rooms, very clean, friendly multi-lingual staff, great restaurant onsite, comfy beds.",5,2018,09,03
231,very nice hotel and good value for your money,"Very nice hotel and good value.  The only issue I had with the hotel was the location.  I would of liked to be closer to the Temple Bar neighborhood or near some of the historical sites in town.  This was close to the public transportation routes though, which made our morning walk to catch a bus very easy.",4,2018,09,03
231,Terrible service at high prices,"Terrible service and not cheap. I have been made to feel unwelcome here from the first moment. I paid £330 for a room for 2 nights, upon arrival I had to pay a further £40 for my wife and I to have breakfast, I had to pay this in cash because they can’t take debit cards at this hotel it has to be credit cards, why? I also sat in the bar and watched an elderly gentleman wait for a cheese sandwich for a hour, when he enquired how long it would be he was told another half hour, there was 8 people in the bar, he asked for his money back. Most of the staff are Eastern European and don’t understand you or don’t want to. The English man who is the manager is completely uninterested in his guests. I’d like to thank Jurys inn for making my anniversary as difficult as possible. I’m in Ireland on business all the time and I have to acccommodate my employees but I will never be paying this shambolic establishment ever again. Seriously there’s so much better than this place for the money.",1,2018,09,02

All in all, our stay was great!!  Very helpful staff at the front desk!!",5,2018,08,31
231,Fantastic!!!! 🇮🇪🍀🇮🇪🍀🇮🇪🍀🇮🇪,"Upon arrival we were greeted by genuinely smiley  and happy staff who made us feel so welcome! Gustavo & Patrick checked us in quickly and gave us all the information we needed for our 3 days in Dublin.

The hotel couldn't be in a better location, the drop off point from the airport is literally a 3 minute walk away. There's a Tesco opposite the hotel for any snacks you may want.

The food in both the Bar and Restaurant was incredible, food came out piping hot and extremely fast. Ella and Alexander were brilliant =) Breakfast was equally as delicious 😋

All the staff are an absolute credit to this hotel and made us feel at home.

The only downside was having to leave!!!

231,Air Conditioning made this hotel a hit,"This hotel  has a good central location, bar and restaurant had very good food, and with the heat wave, the AC was a pleasant surprise.  It is across the street from Chapters bookstore and one street over from the HopOn HopOff coach office and pick up point.  A taxi to the airport was 24 Euros.  A bus is also available one street over, but our flight was so early we chose the taxi.  
The room was large with a  nice seating area.  Would stay there again.",4,2018,08,25
231,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed the night for a concert in the 3 arena. The hotel is in the heart of the city and only a 30 minute walk from the areana. Very nice hotel, very clean and overall a very comfortable stay. I'd definitely visit again",5,2018,08,23
231,Too expensive for what you get,"Well meaning but overpriced. Good location to be sure, but disappointing overall. Good staff except for an Irish hotel there were remarakably few Irish people working there, so it took away the sense of locale. Every single person I spoke to came from somewhere other than Ireland. By definition I approve of multilingual staff , but this was ridiculous! Aside from that , it should be priced more reasonably, considering what the overall impression is as you leave.",3,2018,08,22
231,Dublin Weekend,"Overall a bit expensive with no breakfast and no simple parking arrangements,the rest of the stay was fine.find it difficult to write an essay to get the number of letters used up.the location of the hotel was very cenrtral and thus good for all venues",3,2018,08,22
231,Great,"Very enjoyable stay...and it's in Ireland!!Very very comfy beds. Slept very well. Had breakfast which was hot tasty and fresh. Nice bar with good service. Would stay again. Shopping, great restaurants all within 10 minutes walking distance. Airport approx 2o mins away.",5,2018,08,22
231,Beautiful! ,Stayed here at the beginning of August. Our stay was beautiful from start to finish. Would highly recommend a visit to this hotel. Friendly staff amazing food and drink. Could not fault! Thank you for a beautiful stay. ,5,2018,08,21
231,Brief holiday in Dublin,"The room was excellent and the location is good. We upgraded our room and the super king size bed was great. There is the noise of the City waking up early morning - bins being emptied and seagulls, but this is pleasant. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.",5,2018,08,21
231,Great location; comfy stay,"This is an ideal hotel if you like to walk.  It is in the heart of Dublin with great food and an easy walk to most major sites.  We love the walk from the hotel to Trinity and St. Stephen's Green, and it was convenient to transportation for day trips. Worked really well for an event a Croke Park, too.  We'll definitely return!",5,2018,08,21
231,Kev and Rena's trip,"Hotel lovely, but we thought a bit pricey, very comfy bed, fabulous breakfast, great location.  Would have liked a safe in the room, and a fridge would have been very handy.  Looked after our cases on our last day as we had a late flight.",5,2018,08,21
231,Good experience!!!,"I stated before, we had a good experience, I was disappointed the front manager would not approve an upgrade since we had trouble locating the hotel and parking, and checked in late, with only 1 day to tour Dublin and was leaving for San Diego, long flight the next day. Plus our anniversary.  I know in USA, they are very accommodating with upgrades at no charge.Other than that, everything was great",5,2018,08,20
231,don't stay at Jurys inn in Parnell St. if you drive or smoke,"Don't stay at Jurys inn in Parnell St. if you drive or smoke, Hotel was clean and bar was good, no smoking area at the end of a very tiring day, grossly misled about parking, no car park, use of one in the city would have been accurate.",2,2018,08,20
231,Most disappointing ,"I stayed in Dublin for one night with my family and although the location was great(central Dublin city) the accommodation was most disappointing. I booked online a family room , to arrive to a double room with a pull out couch. Yes this can be a family room I hear you say. However, it was not made up and had not provided sheets, duvet, towels, cups or glasses for 4 people. I rang the reception and even though I was listened to by an agreeable receptionist, the excuse was my booking agency. I had to be firm and demand another room, which I duly got but no water provided and was equally as small. Breakfast for a child was the same price as an adult, therefore, I would most certainly NOT recommend this hotel for a family. ",2,2018,08,19
231,Lovely hotel,"Stay for 2 nights with my sister-in-law, as a stop over.  The hotel was modern, clean and well maintained.  Staff where friendly and helpful.  Beds where very comfortable and had a lovely sized ensuite.  Only thing that let it down was the breakfast, which was over cooked and tasteless.  Not much choice of fresh fruit.  Coffee was weak, so we only had breakfast there once. But overall great and would stay there again",4,2018,08,19
231,Everything in order,"We stayed two nights in August 2018. Really nothing to complain about, except the first night at around 5 in the morning, when the people in the next room suddenly decided to get noisy. Not the hotel's fault, obviously. The location was excellent, the bed comfy, the breakfast plentiful and the service in the bar attentive. The same goes for the people in the reception. Would return.",4,2018,08,19
231,Good hotel,"Although we didn't spend much time at the hotel, it's a good hotel.

Rooms:
- clean and basic
- quiet since hotel is north of River Liffey.  Very happy about that.

Location:
- walkable to everything.  However, most of the sights are south of the River Liffey.
- Tesco Supermarket across the street for inexpensive food and beverages.

Taxi:
- taxi stand outside of hotel.
- we left for the airport before 6am and since it was so early, there were no taxis waiting at the stand.  We asked the front desk to call for one and it arrived very quickly (in 10 minutes).  There was not an extra charge either.  It cost the same amount as our ride from the airport to the hotel - 28 Euros",4,2018,08,18
231,Okay stay,"Breakfast was great,fantastic selection for a  good price, but purchase at the desk, not the restaurant as it is cheaper at the desk.  The staff were wonderful, helpful and accommodating.  The only thing was cleanliness of the room, specifically the flooring was not the greatest.  Also, make sure the staff give accurate information for distance to train, as we almost missed ours with inaccurate information given..",3,2018,08,18
231,Great location,"Hotel was really nice and we were upgraded to an executive room as complimentary from the hotel. Room was spacious and included air con, mini fridge, safety deposit box, tea and coffee machine. Bathroom had bath tub and shower. Breakfast was lovely as there was a variety of food which fresh. Location was great and everything was within walking distance or a bus/tram ride away. For some bizarre reason we could hear seagulls at night. There is no sea nearby but there are rivers. Turns out the seagulls hang around dustbins looking for left overs. Other than great stay.",4,2018,08,18
231,First time in this hotel,"My company chose the hotel as it was close to the office. It was the first time I had stayed there as my company usually put me in a different hotel in Dublin. For the same price it did not compare as well as other hotels in Dublin given that there was no room safe, no bottled water, no mini-fridge, only a basic hotel TV package with local news/weather coming from Gravesend in Kent!, no black-out curtains and seagulls that woke me really early in the morning. However, the beds were really comfy as were the pillows. The shower worked really well too (with refillable soap and shampoo provided).      ",3,2018,08,17
231,Love it 👌🏻,"The rooms were clean and the beds were perfect.  Very good breakfast, with everything you need and then some! perfect location,  friendly and helpfull staff. I hope to come again 🇮🇪 Everything you need right around the corner!",5,2018,08,17
231,Great stay as always!,Everytime that we are in Dublin we stay in Jurys Inn Parnell Street. It is a lovely hotel with a great location  (walking distance to most attractions) and the staff is very friendly. Especially Liz made our breakfast even nicer. Thank you!,5,2018,08,16
231,A Very Pleasant Stay,A very pleasant stay.  Every staff member encountered was particularly pleasant and helpful. It was a nice touch to have 2 bottles of water in the Room along with the tea/coffee/biscuits etc and the free newspaper next morning ,5,2018,08,15
231,Staying In Dublin at Jury's Innon Parnell Street,"I was very impressed by the cleanliness, the restaurant, the service provided.  It was a great location right in the middle of everything - O'Connell Street a block away with the Tourist Office, Hop On Hop Off busses - Temple Bar, Writers' Museum - we were so pleased we stayed twice! Three days before we began a tour and then two more nights when we returned!",5,2018,08,15
231,Short stay in Dublin,"This is our second stay at this hotel and it was very satisfying. The staff was very friendly, the room was  nice and clean. We appreciated the facilities (including tea/coffee cooker in the room). The hotel is greatly located in the center of Dublin. Ideal for sightseeing! ",5,2018,08,15
231,Convenient amd Clean,Booked two rooms recently.  The staff during check-in and check-out was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Rooms were clean and beds were comfortable.  Walkable to most tourist sites.  Also close to transportation if needed.  Shopping area very close.  ,4,2018,08,13
231,Jury's Inn Parnell St Stay,"Friendly staff from many nationalities   Irish, Poles, Argentinians and Brazilians all took great care of us.  Amazed how cosmopolitan Dublin has become.  Very convenient location as it is right of O'Connell St.  ",5,2018,08,12
231,Really impressed ,"Firstly when my friend recommended this location I was unsure but it’s a brilliant location I really think the rooms are nice modern the hotel is well located for shopping and central locations 

We ate in the bar and the sea bass was delicious 

The service all over the hotel was great at all times

I would recommend this place it is very safe and fully keycarded.

I would certainly stay again

Thank you ",4,2018,08,11
231,Comfortable,"Room, nothing special, but comfortable, good location. It is a bit overpriced for the quality.  Staff was good.  Parking is a long walk from location at a private garage, long way to drag luggage.  Bathroom was large but could use some updating. ",5,2018,08,10
231,Jury's Inn Parnell Sr,Nice location just out of the hussle and bustle. Lovely outdoor area where you can have a drink on level 2. Our room 4th floor is looking over a rubbish collection centre which is noisy and unappealing to the eye. We have booked for a 4 night stay so am a little disappointed on the room choice given. Am sure there are nicer views from other rooms and less noisy. Just got the dodgy side I guess. ,3,2018,08,10
231,Great Location. Comfortable rooms.,Hotel location central to many attractions. Staff were friendly & helpful. Rooms were comfortable and AirCond is available. But would be a better hotel experience if we did not have to re-activate our key cards at the service counter for each day we were out.  We stayed for 3 nights only. ,4,2018,08,10
231,disappointing,air conditioning in room was awful they tried to moved us to another room and that one also had a problem. moved back and they gave us a fan and never made any attempt to fix the problem. also breakfast the second day had items missing and they were very slow replacing the food.,3,2018,08,09
231,Good (average) hotel,Hotel is located in good location (around the corner from the GPO) - being a good balance between the airport and the city centre. Facilities and room quality is average. Staff were very nice and attentive.,4,2018,08,09
231,Dublin,"The Jurys Inn was a great location for our family trip, especially since we did several tours which left from OConnell street very close by. The rooms were clean and beds very comfortable. The WiFi worked well. The hotel breakfast opened early and was convenient for our first day in Dublin. Overall a great stay. ",5,2018,08,08
231,Business regular,I am a regular at Parnell street have been for some time. Regular staff service and friendliness is always good. Location is a little bit out of the way for tourists but not too far that you can’t walk. ,4,2018,08,08
231,Excellent stay!,"Lovely hotel very clean and friendly helpful staff
On arrival our room was not ready as they had been really busy. We were given a complimentary drinks voucher. On returning from the bar a room was still not ready so we were upgraded to an executive suite.
Being on a main road I expected it to be rather noisy but it wasn't too bad .
I will definitely be returning to this lovely hotel.",5,2018,08,08
231,Very disappointed,"Stayed 2 nights. 1st night late evening thought someone on floor above or below was dragging furniture across floor. Next night same thing. Phoned to complain at 12:30am was told that they would have it stopped. Continued to 1.30am then restarted at 6.00 am, we were on 3rd floor kitchen on 2nd. Very disappointed.",1,2018,08,07
231,Great locale that isn't too busy,Great location for wandering around Dublin without being too close to Temple Bar.  Excellent value for location.  There were also small touches in the lobby like fruit water that made it feel less like a chain hotel.,4,2018,08,06
231,Pleasant stay,"Very good location, easy walk to anything you want to see. Friendly staff were helpful for an early morning excursion start and arranged a take away breakfast. Around the corner to O'Connell Street which leads you to the Temple Bar area.",4,2018,08,06
231,Great hotel,"Great hotel in a great location. Round the corner from Airlink bus stop from Airport. Large room and very clean. Good buffet breakfast, helpful friendly staff. Second time I've stayed here. 10 min walk to Temple bar area. 2 shopping centres within 10 mins.",5,2018,08,06
231,We definitely recommend the Jury’s Inn. Could not think of one thing to complain about!!,"The Jury’s Inn was an excellent hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful, the complimentary breakfast was awesome and the location is perfect! The beds are very comfortable and ours was recently renovated. We stayed for two nights and will return in a week for another night and are so happy we are staying there again!!",5,2018,08,06
231,Superb,"This is a superb hotel set in a great location, ( just a short walk and you're in the famous Temple Bar area ) clean rooms with comfortable beds, exceptionally friendly and professional staff across the board, A superb hotel.",4,2018,08,06
231,A wonderful stay as always,"This was me and my girlfriend's second stay at Jurys Inn on Parnell Street.
And just as last time, it couldn't have been any better (unless our room was upgraded to a top-floor full suite - haha).
The hotel is very clean, and updated. The front desk staff is remarkably friendly and helpful if needed. And they are attentive to anything you need from them.
The hotel is located in a convenient spot to Temple Bar and all of Central Dublin, while also being away from it enough that you don't need to worry about any noise.
I have recommended this hotel to anyone that is thinking of traveling to Dublin, one group has already booked it themselves. And anytime I come to Dublin I will be sure to book at the Jurys Inn.",5,2018,08,06
231,Convenient location,"Was convenient for me as only 15 minute walk from where I was working. Nice and clean everywhere. Fruit bowls in communal areas. Friendly reception on check-in.
Room was clean and despite being in a busy part of town the double glazing kept the room quiet.
I ate in the restaurant and the selection of food was adequate. A good pint of Guiness.
The breakfast was a very broad selection buffet, nicely presented and well stocked.
I would definately stay again.",4,2018,08,06
231,Great place to stay,"excellent location, nice friendly staff, easy to check in and check out, leave your bags for that last minute shop or sight see event. Everything within an easy walk. Public Transport excellent and very close by ",5,2018,08,06
231,Very inadequate,"Booked for 2 nights, 1st night kept awake by what seemed like dragging furniture over the floor of either room below or above. Gave them the benefit  of the doubt but next night started again about 11.30pm till 1.30 am. Phoned reception at 12.30 pm and he said he would have it stopped still going for another hour, then started again at 6.00 am... We were on the 3rd floor, booked over 9 months prior - admittedly just standard room but it was less than stndard, paid $750 Aust. For 2 nights with b'fast. Room #363 - internal room tiny window looked onto a brick wall - little natural light. Would not recommend.",2,2018,08,05
231,Excellent stay at Jurys Inn Parnell Str,"I must say, this is an excellent hotel !
Friendly and helpful staff in general (as where all 'Dubliners').
The hotel/room was perfect, clean, whatever you need, whatever you ask  ... what can I say more ...",5,2018,08,05
231,Nice hotel in a cetral location!,"The Jurys Inn Parnell St. was recommended by our travel agent, and it turned out to be the right choice! Friendly, helpful staff in a very nice hotel that was in walking distance from many of Dublins treasures!  ",5,2018,08,02
231,Bacation,"My daughter and I stayed here for a short trip to Dublin. It was our first time to Ireland. The hotel was in a perfect location. We could walk to everything we wanted to do. One of the pick up points for our bus tour was right around the corner. Hotel was clean and accommodations were comfortable. Would definitely stay here again. All amenities are provided: soap, shampoo, body wash, hair dryer, iron, etc. Great trip! ",5,2018,08,02
231,Miss Sarah Nulty,We had to stay on Sunday night as our flight from cork was cancelled on Saturday we booked the hotel on line Saturday evening to check in on Sunday afternoon. My dad regularly stays in this hotel we were a bit disappointed that the rooms were not ready when we arrived .,5,2018,08,01
231,Good choice in north Dublin,"Excellent full-service hotel in Dublin. Friendly service, good facilities. Our executive room, with its king bed, was well appointed & very comfortable. Lavish breakfast buffet. Not ideal with a car, since the public parking garage (discounted to 10 euro per night with validation) is a 7 minute walk & (thanks to Dublin streets) a 10 minute drive. You have to hope for a space at the small taxi rank in front of the hotel entrance to unload luggage. Some like the location, but the hotel’s immediate neighborhood is a bit run down. It’s north of the river, with the quainter parts of town to the south. On balance, though, we were very happy with our stay here.",4,2018,08,01
231,Excellent hotel- convenient and clean!,"We were very comfortable in the clean and spacious hotel.  It was centrally located.  It was easy to leave the airport, grab a bus, and walk three minutes to the hotel- what a relief! Staff was awesome.  Breakfast was delicious!  We would definitely come back!",5,2018,07,31
231,A good hotel,"I stayed there with my family in the past week and it was worth it. Its location is very good, nearby of many Dublin highlights. There are only two things I would like to say about the guestroom I stayed. First, there is no safe, which is something very important because I do not like to hang around and carry passports and money. And second, the mattress could be better. Other than these two things, the hotel was very good and met our expectations.",4,2018,07,30
231,Good downtown location,"This hotel was completely different from the Belfast location.  Accessible to shopping and restaurants, comfortable location and nice staff.  Easy location for transportation to and from the airport.    For my last night in Dublin it worked very well in every way.

Comfortable and large room with a really large bathroom.  That was a nice surprise.",3,2018,07,29
231,Family,"very good location for vacation in Dublin. Close to restaurant areas and Temple bar location. Handy with a Tesco store across the street. 
Ice machine ocn each floor for deeping drinks cold. 
Breakfast room was big and food was good",4,2018,07,29
231,1 night stay with friends,"Visited here with 2 friends.Reception was large and staff were very welcoming.We got bar food, menu had a good choice,we were waiting a little while,but it was worth the wait as it was very tasty. We got a double room.very average with plain grey decor.bathroom was small,clean,but old fashioned.Duvets were heavy & not too comfy.Overall good location,good food,bedrooms could do with a spruce.",3,2018,07,29
231,Great stay,"Stayed here as part of a surprise birthday trip for my girlfriend.  Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the receptionist, who checked us in with no issues at all.  We explained it was our first time in Dublin, so she provided us with a map of the city and highlighted all the main attractions with a highlighter pen, which helped us a lot.

The rooms were fine with a large bed (Executive room) and a decent bathroom.

The location is great and is a short walk away from Henry Street, which is full of shops and restaurants.  It is also a short walk away from Temple Bar, which is very lively in the evening with lots of bars playing live music.

We had a great first day at the Guinness Storehouse which I recommend to anyone who hasn't been before.  The second day we bought a ticket for an open top bus tour (green bus), so spent the day touring the city.  We could get off at any stop and visit the area and the busses came every 10 minutes so we could continue the tour easily.

Coaches from the airport were very helpful too, dropping and picking us up just around the corner.  At 7 Euro's each way, it's much cheaper than getting a taxi.

Overall a great first experience in Dublin for both of us.",5,2018,07,28
231,Fab hotel,We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. Staff are very friendly and helpful. We walked to all of the attractions. Breakfast was lovely as was the food in the restaurant. Looking forward to staying there again soon,5,2018,07,27
231,Good location but a 3 star.,"A chain hotel centrally located in Dublin within walking distance of the Temple Bar neighborhood and shopping district. Express airport shuttle bus is a 5-minute walk from the hotel. The hotel is in a relatively busy neighborhood with lots of shops and pedestrians in front of it. The square shape architecture of the hotel with a courtyard in the middle makes the rooms quieter. The rooms are clean and well maintained but a bit small - too much furniture is crammed in there which leaves you little space for language. There is no refrigerator but coffee, tea, hot water boiler, hair dryer and iron board are available. The Wi-Fi coverage is good and reliable. Staff are warm, friendly and helpful. Breakfast consists of cereals, fruits, eggs, sausages, beans, potatoes and bread. Overall, I thought it was a good choice in Dublin. The hotel is rated as a 4-star but I think the rating is a bit outdated. I would say they are a 3 star by today’s standards. I also found the rates high at $300 a night.",3,2018,07,27
231,It's there or thereabout.,"Had three nights here early to mid-July and the stay was pleasant with the hotel fairly close to the centre of Dublin. 

The room we had really could have done with a fridge and a safe as the weather was unquestionably not Irish when we visited and it seemed rather odd not to see a fridge or minibar for somewhere to put a bottle of water/soft drinks in.

The safe was available in the lobby area which seemed a little bizarre.

However, a nice touch though from the hotel was the free bottles of water at the end of the corridor. 

The room we had was at the end of the hotel and our view wasn't the best as we overlooked a cleaning depot whose staff were up and about so early each morning and when I heard the reversing lorry beepers I genuinely thought each morning that through the dazed state that I found myself in that my wife was leaving me with her bags packed on a luggage trolley. I then woke up fully to see life wasn't that cruel. 

The beds were comfortable.

Plus points were the comfortable breakfast/dining room with a chilled out bar nearby.

The score on the door would have been a four from me but the fridge and safe and the odd view shaded it back to a three. 

In summing up the staff and the Jury's overall persona would not stop me booking the hotel again.",3,2018,07,26
231,Jurys Inn Parnell St.,"Great hotel, great beds and they have air conditioning. The food was great, the service was great and I would definitely recommend this hotel.  The location was also great to get around to see the sites in Dublin.",5,2018,07,26
231,Our great Dublin stay,"We stayed at Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street for 4 nights. The position was perfect, we could walk to most places. The hop-on-hop-off bus was a few minutes walk away. The staff were great. The foood yum.",5,2018,07,26
231,Great Stay,"Nice and clean accommodation. Located in the very center of Dublin, close to vibrant shopping miles and uncountable pubs. Everything was a memorable experience and hopefully we can relive it once more sometimes again.",4,2018,07,26
231,Enjoyable stay in central location.,Good hotel in central location. Close to LUAS light rail and bus stops. Good general sleeping quarters and breakfast top class. Staff were excellent...obliging and helpful.Rooms were clean and tidy.Enjoyed our short stay and will return.,4,2018,07,25
231,Very good hotel to stay for a city trip to Dublin,We very much liked this hotel because of the perfect location (centrally in the city centre but not too crowdy location). We very much appreciated the friendliness of the staff and good service. The breakfast was very good and also the rooms are very good and were clean. The only negative point for us (but that was only a detail) is the view we had outside the window (we were located at the rear of the building).,4,2018,07,25
231,Very Good.,"Lovely clean hotel with lovely reception staff! Conveniently placed just off O’Connell street where the airport bus drops you off. There’s a Tesco just opposite the hotel for your bits and bobs. We found the location excellent and they even gave us a Happy Saturday’ basket which contained crisps, nuts and chocolate!! A lovely touch. Thank you !",4,2018,07,24
231,Centrally Located and convenient to transportation,"We spent 6 days at Jury’s Inn in May 2018, after cruising to Ireland from the US.  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  We had a suite with a king size bed that was quite large with plenty of closet space and a very nice full bath.  They have a lovely breakfast on the second floor with a lounge and great bar with a friendly bartender.  We also had dinner there one evening and it was excellent.  The elevator can only we accessed by using your guest key, which we found a great security idea.  The only drawback was the lobby, it is a little dated with not very nice furniture. It could use a facelift.",5,2018,07,24
231,A weekend away,"the people of jurys really know how to look after there clients we were made to feel so welcome.the food and drinks were so nice and fresh and the friendly staff on all levels helped our weekend one we will never forget,thanks guys",5,2018,07,24
231,Great staying,"Before the Jury Inn, I stayed in Trinity Hotel and it sucks even though I paid more there. I was very satisfied with cleaness, enough water supply, not humid bathroom system, airconditioning, and spacious room. And the location was great. I could reach anywhere within 10 mins walk. Lidle, Tesco and other markets surround the Inn and they open very late. Great. If I go back to Ireland, I would defo stay in Jury Inn again.",5,2018,07,23
231,Good Location,"Very good holiday, only ruined by an Irish airline who cancelled our original Flight back. Booked an extra night with no fuss and got to stay in the same room which was another bonus. Managed to get in a trip to Leopardstown racecourse, caught the tram that runs right past the hotel and Shelbourne Park for an evening of dog racing.",5,2018,07,23
231,Great Location,"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights with my daughter. Excellent hotel for location. Beds comfy & rooms very good size. Had lovely breakfasts, everything you could wish for. Hotel bar very relaxing. Staff superb, really helpful if you needed to know anything. Would definitely stay here again if we came to Dublin.",5,2018,07,23
231,Dublin in July,"Excelent hotel, very good room, good location in Dublin.
I went to Dublin for work. The hotel is very clean, service is very friendly. The hotel is located in the center of Dublin but it is an quiet area near to shopping centers, restaurants and traditional pubs. Very well linked by public transports.",4,2018,07,23
231,great value,"i slept like a baby. the location was good, the staff was friendly. though i didnt find the breakfast superb it s probably because i dont like the english breakfast not that the food was bad. i dont even need to mention the room was very clean",4,2018,07,23
231,A couple of nights in Dublin,We need a place to stay while waiting for friends to join us after a cruise which ended in Dublin. We decided on Jury's Inn because it looked centrally located to places we wanted to visit. It was and that worked out really fine. some things required a short taxi ride mainly because it was raining. The hotel was modern and clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable and quiet. We will probably stay there again the next time we want a short break in Dublin.,4,2018,07,22
231,"Some good,some bad","How are we expected to wash our faces ?We have stayed in other 4star hotels with better amenities.Noise level of our first room was unbearable .Theres no safe or mini bar and very few drawers for storage.The hotel was in the centre of the city,had friendly staff and is very clean.",4,2018,07,22
231,Great place to stay,"I was here for a few days on a business trip/conference. The rates with the conference were very reasonable making this a really great deal. My room was clean and quiet, with good temperature control and plenty of space. The front desk staff were very helpful. The breakfast buffet was excellent. The ""gym"" was pretty minimal. The location is just off the main strip of O'Connell Street which seemed like a great place to be (my main goal was to be reasonably close to the Convention Centre). I would definitely stay here again.",4,2018,07,21
231,Turn the Corner,"This hotel is PERFECTLY situated! You walk two blocks, and you and turn the corner and you are on the madness that is O'Connell street, but it is a nice respite when coming home for the evening to get away from the bustle and just have a beautiful calm hotel. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Dublin is such a walkable city! I thought my room was exceptionally large by European standards.",5,2018,07,21
231,Great breakfast. Non-existent parking.,"The breakfast was good, and the room itself was adequate. But the desk clerks were a bit unhelpful and even rude. And there is no parking at all on-site. It’s just a mess. There is no way that I would return.",2,2018,07,21
231,Handy hotel,"The hotel is near to airport bus drop off stop and stop for return journey. It’s very convenient for most of the city, we walked to everything we wanted to see. It’s just off O’Connell Street on Parnell so not as noisy or busy. ",5,2018,07,20
231,Great stay at Jury's Inn Dublin,"We stayed at Jury's Inn Dublin in June 2018. We had a great time. The rooms were clean and neat, staff were helpful, friendly and ready to help at anytime , the buffet breakfast was really awesome. We loved our stay at the Jury's Inn Dublin. I would definitely stay again.",5,2018,07,20
231,Good Hotel for Dublin visit,"We stayed for two nights at the end of June while visiting family.  
Check in was quick and painless, our rooms were fine, there was everything we needed. 
Out room was an internal one and very quiet, no traffic noise.  
There was air conditioning which was centrally controlled. 
There are tea and coffee making facilities, an ironing board and iron, adequate storage and comfortable beds. 
There is no safe but there is a safety deposit box available at reception. 
There are no extras in the bathroom, just soap in a wall mounted dispenser so you need your own conditioner etc, no shower caps.
We ate in the hotel that evening in the restaurant area, which was quieter and more relaxing than the bar area but with the same choice of food,  the bar is quite busy in the evenings and popular for food and bar snacks. 
There was quite a good choice and we were very happy with the food which was very tasty and well cooked. It was an easier option than going out to look for a restaurant and we were very glad we opted to stay there. 
I don’t usually have dessert but the sponge dessert was delicious. 
Breakfast had the usual choices, and it was perfectly fine without being outstanding. 
There is a courtyard adjoining the breakfast area for people who wish to smoke, with a few picnic tables, it’s the only outside space as far as I could see. 
The location is good, as it’s close to the centre but the area around the hotel and generally at the top of O’Connell St is a bit less than salubrious, do watch your bag and beware of pickpockets etc who are likely to target tourists. 
Overall we were more than satisfied and would stay here again and would recommend the hotel.",4,2018,07,19
231,bed bugs?,my family and me have (bed bug?) bites all over after three nights in Jurys Inn Parnell Street. Otherwise the room was ok but rather small. Breakfast very good. Location very good. Reception staff average.,2,2018,07,19
231,Great location and quality hotel,"We stayed here 3 nights and found it very convenient for sightseeing in Dublin. There is plenty to do, see and eat within walking distance and it is very convenient to public transportation. The staff is very accommodating and helpful,  especially helping us switch rooms to allow our family to be closer together. Rooms were clean,  well appointed and spacious- considering we had 3 children with us,  that means a lot! The on-site full breakfast was delicious and convenient. I highly recommend this hotel if you're visiting Dublin. ",4,2018,07,17
231,"Good Hotel, Excellent Location","The hotel is located very close to the city centre and main shopping area of O'Connell St. Also very close to where all the day tours start. 
Room was comfortable for 2 adults, clean and quiet. 

However, Front desk was not very smart. They didn't keep a record of the 2nd person occupying the room and hence rejected an important parcel.
Also, avoid room service here! They add 5 Euro to your order as ""tray charge"". This is absolutely ridiculous! We're not running away with the tray, are we?!!",4,2018,07,17
231,Stayed here for concert in the 3 Arena,"We stayed here recently for a concert in the 3 Arena, its really easy to locate and its in a great location, its within walking distance to city center. There are loads of shops and places to eat on this street. Check in was easy and simple, the gentleman that checked us in and was so friendly and helpful, he was also super chatty. The room was lovely and clean, it had all the amenities that we needed. It was quite. The breakfast was buffet style, there was loads of different on foods on offer and it was all very well presented.",5,2018,07,17
231,Jury’s Inn,"Jury’s Inn on Parnell is in a great location. We were able to walk along the river, which was close by, and their were also lots of  pubs and eating establishments to choose from. The rooms were also comfortable and clean.",5,2018,07,17
231,Great Location and Nice Breakfast ,"We spent two nights here on a Cosmos tour. I can reiterate a lot of what other people wrote here. The location is really quite good. It's a leisurely 15-minute walk to Trinity College, for example. It's less than that to the Temple Bar area. I can also say that the breakfast was the nicest in the number of places at which we stayed in Ireland. There was the usual,  but the eggs were fresh and the sausage was tasty. Also a nice selection of fruit. In addition,  the hotel has air conditioning, which we did not find in our other stops in Ireland.  I have no problem sleeping with an open window rather than AC, but the latter does help maintain a steady temperature,  which is better for sleeping. ",4,2018,07,16
231,"Great spot for eating, drinking and transportation.",Very good hotel. Best breakfast in all of my travels through Europe. I was in room 239 and I could hear noise from the next building. It kept me up through the night. Management offered me free transportation to the airport. Since I booked through Expedia they could not reduce the rate of my room.,4,2018,07,16
231,Location and service,"Nice hotel with greate location, close to bars, restaurant, main street and public transportation.
Big clean rooms with greate beds and linnen, clean bathrooms.
Ice-machine in each floor, cold water and apple served everyday with the elevators.
Breakfast was a pleasure, everything to choose from and excellent service by all personell. Service in reception was also greate, always smiling and helpful. 
Door-card was a problem every day, out of function, had to go go reception to activate it several times.",5,2018,07,16
231,Lovely Stay!,Jury's Inn Dublin Parnell Street was super! Good breakfast and superb hosting!The venue is also close to public transport making it within easy reach and at all hours. The customer care service is also superb and they are always ready and willing to help.  ,5,2018,07,16
231,Expensive and Dirty Bathroom,We picked this hotel because of the location and it was close to the downtown sights. We were able to walk nearly everywhere. Upon check in they tried to change the type of room I booked. After I insisted that wasn’t what I booked they did give me the original room. The air conditioner worked well and I was glad we had it as it was hot. The room was also quiet. However the room was borderline disgustingly dirty. The bathroom had mold and cracks and stains. The walls were cracking off. In the room there were stains on the carpet and I really didn’t feel comfortable walking without shoes. We paid almost 300 a night for this room so I was really disappointed. I would have addressed all of this upon check out however they never asked how the stay was. Would I stay here again probably not would I recommend it to others no way. Please see the below pics of the gross bathroom.,3,2018,07,13
231,Best place to stay in Dublin,"The hotel is located on Parnell Street which is n close vicinity to many attractions within 5 to 10 minutes of walk. The hotel is centrally located in Dublin with easy access to public transport and taxis. Five minutes walk to O'Connell street, 10 Minutes walk to Temple Bar, supermarkets adjacent to it,and across the road, few Indian restaurants close by, what more one can ask for.

The hotel is tastefully done with a fully functional bar and restaurant, very friendly and helpful staff and damn good services. I liked it in every aspect.

In case you are a book lover, there is a huge book store just opposite to it which you can't resist and miss. 

Overall a very good place to be in while in Dublin.",4,2018,07,13
231,Great service and great place to stay while visiting Dublin!,The service and the the staff were outstanding. The only negative was that we had to park our car a little ways away. The proximity to every thing was in walking distance. I’m would highly recommend this hotel!,5,2018,07,11
231,location,Location location location. Near  O'Connell street with excellent friendly staff. Complimentary water and fruit available a welcome gesture. Easy access to Ml Buble concert in Croke Park. A pleasant 30 minute walk.,4,2018,07,10
231,"Great Location, good night's sleep","We stayed here for two nights to start out our Ireland vacation.  We couldn't have picked a better place for the price we paid.  First off, it had A/C.  Ireland was in the midst of a heat wave when we visited and no other hotel we stayed at had A/C which made a lot of difference in getting a good night's sleep.  We thought the location was excellent.  Being north of the River Liffey meant that we didn't have to drive our rental car all the way into the center city and since I am used to driving on the right side of the road, this meant the probability that less pedestrians would be hit by me!  Jury's Inn had worked out a deal with a nearby Clery's Q-park so we only had to pay €10 per day for parking.  The hotel had all the amenities that you would expect from a good 3 star hotel.  There were ice makers on each floor but no ice bucket in our room...a quick visit to the bar on the 2nd floor solved that.  The breakfast buffet was good and worth the extra money for one morning.  We ate out at a nearby bakery for our 2nd morning.  All the major Dublin attractions were within a reasonable walk and we were able to see the Dublin Castle, St. Patrick's Cathedral and Trinity College all in one day.  After our stay, I will be looking to stay at other Jury's Inns.",4,2018,07,10
231,Great stay,"Centrally located in the centre of Dublin.  Walking distance to many of the sites.  Helpful receptionist at check in who gave me a street map when I queried directions to the train station.  Nice, clean room.  Good value for money.",5,2018,07,09
231,Very comfortable stay,"The front desk staff very helpful , the bar and wait staff very pleasant. It was during a he’s wave and they provided a fan for the room which helped. Also hydration stations on all floors so we could drink slot of water.",5,2018,07,09
231,Highly recommended  Excellent stay.,"5 days family holiday, hotel was lovley rooms clean. We paid for early check in, paper and complimentary water and bigger towels( BUT you got a free paper at breakfast and water bottles at reception and the towels was the same as other rooms??) Breakfast was lovley lots of choice. Location was excellent walking distance to attractions or you could use hop on hop.off bus which take you to all the sights. ",5,2018,07,09
231,Nice Hotel in the Heart of Dublin - Modern and Convenient,"I was not familiar with this hotel brand, but a colleague recommended it. It is very conveniently located, so that we were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to visit in Dublin. The room we had was modern, comfortable, with great towels, a nice king size bed, and well designed. The lobby has a lovely fruit flavored water waiting for you when you come in after a long day of trooping all over Dublin. We also decided to take the breakfast option. It is a very full and complete array of nicely prepared food of high quality. They even had smoothies. It is worth it if you like a big breakfast!

Several things to note however. The hotel is on a very, very busy street. We had a car, but were taking it back to the rental place (good idea in Dublin- you don't need one). There is no place to really park in front of the hotel. We did what everyone seems to do in Dublin - just sort of pull up to the curb and park. Parking through the hotel is expensive. You can park in a nearby ramp to save money, but you will not have all day privileges. I went in while my husband started organizing all of our stuff while I checked in. Nearby there is a bus you can catch that goes directly to the airport. It was not expensive, and well worth not having to worry about a car in Dublin.

Second minor issue: We had lots of bags of purchases and 3 suitcases, and assorted day bags. I could not find a staff person to help me. I finally grabbed the bell boy cart, and we loaded it up ourselves. My husband took off for the airport, and I pushed that heavy cart up to our room myself. This is quite surprising, as usually I find there are lots of staff happy to help move luggage.

These are relatively minor glitches. This is a well positioned and very nicely furnished European style hotel. I would stay there again.",4,2018,07,08
231,Jurys Inn Dublin,"Very satisfied, good night's sleep (we requested and got a courtyard room), air-con worked fine, bathroom clean, plenty of towels, good water pressure on the shower. No issues at all really. Good location to centre & a few local pubs.",5,2018,07,08
231,Amazing hotel,"Far outweighed my expectations.  Nice clean modern hotel.  Staff are beyond helpful and beyond friendly.  Rooms are very nice with good cold air conditioning. Complimentary tea coffee, biscuits, there was even coke and chocolates in the fridge for us also complimentary.  Breakfast was buffet style and the choice was endless and tasty.  It's about 10 minute walk away into the Temple bar area.  I would stay here again tomorrow.  Great hotel.",5,2018,07,08
231,Good place and good staff,This is a very good place to stay. The location is convenient to go our for sigh seeing. The staff are friendly. Especially thank Manager Anna for the help to solve our problem. We enjoyed our stay for three nights. ,5,2018,07,08
231,Rudest Staff member I have ever met!,"I have never been motivated to write a negative review about any where I have stayed before as generally customer service has been at a high. However, for the past 2 evenings, the gentleman who has manned the front desk at this hotel has been beyond rude to me as a guest of this hotel. 

1) I asked about room service during our first evening’s stay, he rudely spat out to me that there were no pizzas left (before I had even mentioned what I was after) and told me I couldn’t order as no-one had taken my credit card details during check in. 
2) When my key card failed to unlock the door to my room on return during our second evening, I returned to reception and politely asked to have it reconnected. He began quizing me as to how it was broken, as if the fault was mine?
3) I had spoken to another staff member (who was helpful and kind like the other 99%) during the day of or second stay and got them to add my credit card to the room. When I phoned to ask during the second evening, I was met with the same abruptness from this gentleman and when I requested a Diet Coke with my pizza, he spat out the line that is written on the front of the menu about a shorter menu availability at night. When I asked for a compromise, he met me with the same line.

The hotel itself was very clean and comfortable, the breakfast staff and check in staff where very friendly and kind, but this guy, what an eejit! So rude! I stayed in room 533 from 06/07 - 08-07. I am happy to explain this further to anyone who wishes to discuss it.",1,2018,07,07
231,Frustrating experience,"I have selected the hotel due to its very good location and facilities.
However I havn't received the type of room reserved and paid for , which spoiled the good  potential the hotel has,and left my wife and me with a very bab taste of our Dublin vacation we were looking forward to.
It's a real shame!
",2,2018,07,06
231,Lovely hotel,Right in the heart of everything great place to stay very clean and comfortable great location for getting about Dublin on foot  every thing you need right on your door step reasonable price hotel bar and brilliant service ,5,2018,07,05
231,Jurys Inn Dublin - Overpriced Executive Room,"I stayed here twice in June, once with my daughter and again on my own, in particular because of its central location. The reception staff were very nice on both occasions and the room my daughter and I stayed in was adequate, clean and tidy.
The second stay was upgraded to an Executive Suite, which I thought would be great, given mine was a working stay.  In addition to the room rate, you received a bottle of water, KitKat's, a king size bed and a Safe.  In all honesty the room was no better than the first booking - same view of the restaurant and 7/11 across the street, slightly larger bed - but not worth the extra rate.
I thought 2 visits showed some loyalty, however when I realised I'd short booked the room by one day, they charged me an extra day at the current room rate which was of course higher than I'd originally paid.  My mistake, but I wont be going back, there's plenty of other hotels to choose from.
Restaurant food was very average but the World Cup game was great!",4,2018,07,05
231,Jurys Inn,Along with other Jury Inns this offers excellent service especially at the reception and a very nice lady called Lore. It is a shame that they do not have internet though and only Wi FI and I had to go to the hotel next door to get it,5,2018,07,04
231,Overpriced Basic budget hotel,"It cost us more per night staying at this supposed 4 star ( more like 2 star) than it did for the opulent 5 star Jumeirah Emirates Towers in Dubai.  Dublin hotel prices are ridiculous and this hotel is about as basic as it gets. Room was poky and small, storage was poor,  shower was old style in the bath, the sink was tiny and both room and bathroom were tired and old.  The location is okay but better to stay over the river nearer to temple bar / grafton street. The breakfast was cheap and it was awful and my wife got sick from the unfresh fruit. can sum this up by saying this was supremely average hotel but costs more than you pay for 5 stars luxury in most cities.",3,2018,07,04
231,"Best location, comfort, staff","Thosxwas our second stay at Jury's Inn, Parnell Street. That speaks for itself. Best were the staff, as helpful and dedicated to customer service as possible. The rooms are comfy, the breakfast delicious and varied and the location superb.",5,2018,07,02
231,"Good staff, good service, good stay","We have a great stay at Jurys. The staff was friendly, very courteous, and the facilities were clean. The restaurant at the hotel seemed to have a great selection and good hours.  The room was a little small for my taste, but it was very comfortable. ",4,2018,07,01
231,"Good location, friendly staff, nice room, etc.","As noted in my title, Very Good Hotel in a good location, within easy walking distance of Temple Bar and literally around the corner from stop One of the DoDublin tours. Room was comfortable; breakfast buffet was plentiful, well prepared and fresh. What more can you say. ",5,2018,07,01
231,"Smart, friendly hotel",Superb value for money.  Incredibly clean with excellent customer service. A very well run hotel. Situated perfectly for touring the city on foot. Didn’t have an evening meal but the breakfast was spot on.  It must have been good because the greedy so and so next to us had 5 platefuls!,5,2018,06,29
231,Nice hotel in a great location.,"We stayed here for 2 nights for our first trip to Dublin.  The hotel was very nice looking with friendly staff who were willing to assist. Our room was spacious with a comfortable bed and shower toiletries were provided. 

We did not try the breakfast due to bad reviews we had seen, but Dublin has a variety of cafes and pubs that sell food and drink. We did have a drink in the bar one night which again had a friendly bartender. 

The hotel is in a great location with low cost supermarkets on the same street. I would also recommend Chapter One Bookstore just across the road, which is great for readers as it has a huge range of new and secondhand books.

The only issue we had with the hotel was that on our second day we left at half 9 in the morning, when we arrived later at four to get changed our room had not been cleaned. After i had got out of the shower the cleaner knocked on our door and said that she was leaving soon so we would have to leave if we wanted our room cleaning we said we would leave in 10 minutes. A minute later another cleaner knocks on our door and said if we didn't leave soon we would not have our room cleaned. This was very frustrating as we had already told them once we would be leaving in 10 minutes and it felt like we were being rushed. 

Regardless of that i enjoyed my stay and would consider staying here again for our next visit.",4,2018,06,28
231,Amazing!,"Great place to stay! Neat,friendly, next to the Main Street! (O’Connell street). 
Best value for my money. Nice rooms big enough space with very kind staff. Fancy and big lobby. 
Very quiet even though it’s so near the center of the city. 
Come here when you in Dublin I recommend it! ",5,2018,06,28
231,Ticks all of the boxes,"This Jury's Inn is in a convenient location, the rooms (and bathrooms!) were quite large, and all of the staff members I interacted with were very friendly and helpful.  The sheets were clean and comfortable. The point of being in Dublin is *not* spending time in your hotel room, and this was an excellent place to lay my head between busy days of sightseeing.  There is a Tesco right across the street if you need groceries, and a market street just around the corner. I wound up spending most of my time on the South side of the Liffey, rather than the north, where the hotel is located, but it's an easy walk (15 minutes to get to TCD where the Book of Kells is located), 10-15 minutes to Temple Bar.  I stayed my first two nights at a small boutique hotel by St. Stephen's green, and while that room had more charm, it was *tiny* (no desk, with sink located in bedroom not bathroom), and that room had a weird oppressive sewer smell combined with toothpaste, so I was much happier at the Jury's Inn (which I had booked first before my plans changed), where the room was much more spacious and less stinky.",5,2018,06,27
231,A good choice in Dublin at a good price,"There is nothing wrong in this hotel but also nothing great. I liked everything: the location, the service, the breakfast, the rooms and the price. it is a perfect choice for a business trip or for people who look for a no surprise hotel with everything convenient. ",4,2018,06,27
231,Short Stay,Great location. Really surprised how good Jurys Inn was. Very comfy beds. Excellent breakfast. Overall excellent. staff were very helpful and friendly.  A busy hotel but very well run.  Really enjoyed our stay,5,2018,06,26
231,Location is very good,"Yes, the location is great! Right in D1 City Center . . . yet far enough away to have a fairly peaceful time. Go to Murray's bar right down the street for dinner! The hotel is clean, quiet, nice staff, . . . When you're ready to depart JUST walk AROUND THE CORNER from this hotel –on Oconnel Street in front of “Ned Kelly’s” bar. It is called Aircoach (info@aircoach.ie) Route 700 and goes every 15 minutes with only one or two more stops before arriving at Dublin Airport, great inexpensive bus service!",4,2018,06,26
231,Lovely trip to Dublin,Very nice hotel and extremely friendly staff. Really enjoyed our stay and will definitely consider coming back here on our next trip to Dublin. Great location with everything at walking distanceFood was very nice too. ,5,2018,06,26
231,Centrally located and comfortable,"The location of this hotel is almost ideal. Few paces away from the Airlink Express stop (the bus service from Dublin Airport to the city) and a walkable distance to key landmarks like Trinity College, St Stephen's Green and the Samuel Beckett bridge. The breakfast buffet has a wide variety and is highly recommended. The rooms are spacious and quiet with the basic amenities and the staff is cordial and helpful. Overall a very pleasant experience. You save 1 € if you book breakfast a day in advance.",4,2018,06,25
231,Nice Rooms at Affordable Rates!,"After looking for a one-night stay in Dublin on our way back to the States, we found that hotels like the Marriott were VERY expensive. This hotel offered a much more affordable stay but with high-level accommodations.  Nice rooms, nice bar, nice restaurant and friendly service.  Really enjoyed how convenient it was to lots of restaurants and activities - including Temple Bar.  Great service.  We shall return.",4,2018,06,25
231,Highly recommended,"We stayed at Jury’s Inn for 5 nights while on vacation.  Check in was easy. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet with the usual amenities in the bathroom and a coffee bar in the bedroom area. In the reception area we met the most accommodating young lady named Loredana.  Loredana offered suggestions for dinner, sightseeing and tours.  She seemed genuinely eager to help make our first visit to Dublin a success, booking reservations and calling for taxi service.  Thank you Loredana!",5,2018,06,25
231,great location,Room was clean and well laid out. Great location. Grocery across the road for bits and pieces. Mall just down the road. GPO about 5 mins walk. Good shower and bathroom. Lovely fresh flower scent in main lobby. ,5,2018,06,24
231,Good base to tour Dublin from,"Solid rooms, American style, generous size, twin Queens, nice bathrooms. Breakfast buffet was very good with typical European style offerings. Evening meals are better at nearby restaurants. Nice bar on second floor. Place seemed safe with elevators key carded at lobby level. Tubs are very slick without mats so be careful!",4,2018,06,24
231,Fantastic location ,"A nice efficient welcome, paid for breakfast when we checked in (highly recommended). Room was clean, bed comfortable, enough coat hangers, good bathroom and a quiet room. Brilliant location to go exploring Dublin, we didn’t get any public transport at all as everywhere we wanted to go we could walk. Breakfast is brilliant, plenty of choice to set you up for a day in the beautiful city of Dublin. Hotel staff were efficient and friendly, would highly recommend.",5,2018,06,24
231,Graduation Stay,"Only here for one night, as we were down in Dublin for my son's girlfriend's Graduation. Top quality hotel. Staff very polite and helpful from the minute we arrived. Double room was spacious, quiet and clean with good size en-suite. Stayed for breakfast, which was one of the better buffet-style ones we have had. Good location, too. Plenty to see and do within a short walk, or pop onto the bus/trams for stuff a bit farther afield.",5,2018,06,24
231,Jury's Inn parnell st,"Loredana checked us in and was so friendly, helpful and obviously happy in her job. All smiles & very curtious. Hotel was clean, tidy, very centrally located. Breakfast was plentiful. Would definitely recommend and return.",5,2018,06,24
231,Dublin Visit,"Very good, very comfortable, clean and the breakfasts were fantastic, better than I've had in most hotels that include breakfast.  Staff were very helpful.  Loved having a kettle in my room instead of a coffee maker that you find in north america.  ",5,2018,06,23
231,Accommodation excellence,After hiking the Dingle Peninsula the luxury of Jurys Inn was fantastic Clean spacious rooms and helpful staff was the cherry on top The fact that there was a concert on the same weekend did compromise our sleep due to noisy revellers in the street outside but this was no reflection on the hotel ,4,2018,06,23
231,"Excellent location, great food,","We only were only able to stay one night, but it was worth it.  The breakfast was delicious  and service very good.  we enjoyed our room and it was quite, and the bed very comfortable.  The staff was friendly and helped us with directions to places we wanted to go within walking distance.",5,2018,06,22
231,Wonderful hotel,"Large comfortable room with air conditioning. 
The Buffet breakfast had a large variety of foods, hot, cold, gluten free.  This is definitely an added bonus.

Very conveniently located. Shopping, restaurants, tours, and very close to  cruise ship port.",4,2018,06,20
231,Great Place To Stay!,"We stayed there for 4 nights in June.  Location was a little north of the city center, but within easy walking distance to city center.  It was great to be a little away from the hustle and bustle.  No problems sleeping due to noise, which reviewers at several other hotels noted.  The blackout blinds are great if you want to sleep in.  We were able to check in earlier than promised, which was nice.  There is great public transportation within a few blocks (LUNAS and the train). If you are taking any day bus tours the meeting point for pick up  is right down the street  not even 5 minutes walk.  The room was on the small side, but the bed was very comfortable and it was nice and clean. We had some 12 hour day trips, so it was exactly what we needed.  The staff were very friendly and helpful with getting taxis, printing boarding passes etc....  We even received a welcome basket with assorted snacks and beverages.  We were very happy with our stay. ",5,2018,06,20
231,Lovely Hotel and great staff,"Just a quick weekend break,  the good thing is Jury's is on the bus route direct from the airport so €12 return ... that'll do nicely.

Hotel was much more prices than normal due to the fact Taylor Swift was in town with a show.....Whoops

Hotel is a good position bar and breakfast great and the room was adequate for what I needed main plus point is its position easy to walk to Temple Bar but your not in the middle of all the noise.

Stayed several times and will be staying again",4,2018,06,20
231,2 night stay,Very convenient location and comfortable beds. Great breakfast choices. Nice foyer area for chatting with friends. Helpful staff and taxis available immediately outside the front door s of the hotel. Would definitely stay again.,4,2018,06,20
231,A 3 stars hotel well located,The location was great. At a walking distance from the main attractions. Breakfast was good although they do not have natural juice. The juices  tasted awfull. The hotel needs an up grade urgently. The staff at the reception were very friendly. ,3,2018,06,19
231,well over priced,"the hotel was plain and was offered very few bath amenities , for what they charged me I could have stayed in a much better hotel in Paris , Rome . The ave was loud and crowded . They had the nerve to offer bottled water at the reception desk for a price ( classless ) ",1,2018,06,19
231,Excellent,"Great location to see Dublin.  The rooms are spacious and clean. Amazing value for families. They have a good selection of food for breakfast. Parking is problematic as it's not on the same site, About 5-8 minutes walk.",5,2018,06,19
231,Great location and staff,"The hotel is in a great location, very central and only short walk to all of Dublins major attractions. All the staff in the hotel were fantastic from check in, through to checkout including the cleaners and restaurant staff. A blonde lady on reception (Lara Dana I think her name was) was very friendly and helpful. Rooms were quiet, roomy and very clean. Breakfast had something for everyone. Will definitely be coming back, thank you.",5,2018,06,18
231,Lovely stay in Dublin,"Very good location. Excellent hotel with friendly and helpful staff. Peaceful room, slept well, and housekeeping was impeccable. Delicious varied breakfast, with newspaper provided to start the day. Real pleasure to stay here.",5,2018,06,18
231,problem with the parking fee,"mismanagement of price reduction for Clerys Q-Park : arrived at 3 pm, we parked at Clerys Q-Park for a period of 3 hours ( we have to  join friends in Howth) and leaving the parking at 6 pm we paid 10 euros while we had done the necessary with the reception to benefit from the price negotiate by your hotel. Same rate the next morning while we are staying in the car park for 8 or 89 hours , and hop ... another 10 euros ...
",2,2018,06,18
231,Very nice hotel,"Stayed here for a few days in June. Overall a very good hotel. Security is tight. You need to use your keycard to open almost all the doors in this hotel so you can feel safe knowing that no one but guests are in the hotel. The rooms & bathrooms are clean. Staff friendly and it's in a great location to everything that Dublin offers. Should the occasion arise, I wouldn't hesitate to book this Jurys Inn again.",5,2018,06,18
231,Comfortable stay,"The Three star hotel is located about 5 minutes drive from Connolly Station from where most of the tour buses start. Buses and taxis are easily available. For shopping enthusiasts Henry Street is about 5 minutes walk from the Hotel. 

It is a big hotel with different types of rooms. Our room was a family room with one double bed and one extra bed. The extra bed makes the room a little cramped. The room faced the courtyard. Amenities provided were nice. Breakfast is served on the second floor. The spread was vast and very good. The staff were cordial and friendly.",4,2018,06,17
231,work stay,"Good location, not far from tourist attractions and transportation. The staff is nice and helpful. I had a nice quiet room overlooking the patio; very comfortable bed. Only thing missing in the room is a safe, but they are provided at the reception desk. Good breakfast.",4,2018,06,16
231,A very comfortable stay with an excellent breakfast,"It is a bit tricky to drive to this hotel; not their fault, it is just the way the roads run. You are able to drop off outside in the loading zone and then park your car at the Q-Park Clery’s parking area, for which you receive a discount when you validate your ticket at the hotel. The car park is close. All staff with whom we dealt were friendly and helpful. The room we were allocated was at the back of the hotel and was very quiet - no street noise. Breakfast was excellent with an extensive variety of good quality food. Service here was also of a high standard. Some people might find the bathroom / shower small, so this is something you would need to check.",4,2018,06,16
231,Great location,Very impressed with this hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and we were made to feel welcome. We were a party of 8 and all our rooms were together. They were high standard rooms with plenty of space and very clean. The breakfast room was very attractive and there was a large selection of food. There is a large bar area on the same floor. The bar staff found out that we were celebrating a birthday and gave us a voucher for a free drink each which was totally unexpected. On the morning of her birthday the dining room staff brought out a huge piece of cheesecake with a candle on top and happy birthday written in red sauce. It was a nice surprise. There is also a patio area if you want to sit outside in the fresh air. The hotel is in a good location and a short walk takes you to one of the main streets where you can catch the city tour buses and there are plenty of bars and restaurants around the hotel area. I would definitely stay here again.,5,2018,06,16

231,Weekend Trip,"Lovely hotel. Our room overlooked the courtyard but the other people with us overlooked a yard with road sweepers/cleaners in it. The bed was lovely and comfy.

231,Good day in Dublin,"There was a few hiccups checking in like no where to park while unloading your car and our rooms weren’t ready, but again we were checking in an hour before our allotted time. Also there was confusion in the morning when the taxi came to pick me up for an early flight. The driver was told to wait outside while I was told by the desk clerk to wait in the lobby? Miscommunication.",5,2018,06,13
231,Great reception on arrival,Lovely stay here. Location fantastic so near everything. We were upgraded when we said it was both of our birthdays. Room really nice comfy huge bed. Best breakfast I've had In dublin hotel so many choices. We will be back very soon,5,2018,06,13

231,Excellent location and room,"For those looking to stay right in Dublin with an easy walk to everything, this hotel is perfect.    It is less than 5 minutes walk to the Airlink bus, lots of restaurants in the immediate vicinity, and Tesco across the street.    The rooms were clean, comfortable, and quiet.    There is fresh fruit out every day by the elevators on each floor, and the breakfasts were very good with a wide selection of items.    Our room was ready by the time we got there around noon, which was appreciated.  We walked everywhere in Dublin, although the Hop On Hop Off buses are right around the corner on O'Connell Street.   ",5,2018,06,12
231,Weekend in Dublin,"Hotel lovely, very convenient to shops and restaurants. Rooms were very clean and the staff were very nice and helpful. We have stayed in this hotel a good few times and would recommend it highly to anyone.",5,2018,06,12
231,Very comfortable and convenient,"The reception staff is friendly and the hotel is clean and comfortable.  Fresh apples near the elevator were a very nice touch.  Location is central and great for sightseeing, shopping, and transportation but quieter than the temple bar area for those who like their sleep!  ",5,2018,06,12
231,Good,"Helpful staff, great location, airconditioner, sturdy breakfast (they had glutenfree and vegetarian options)  and a clean room. The Hotel was somewhat expensive for 4 nights, however that would probably have been solved if we had booked our stay earlier. ",5,2018,06,12
231,Family adventure,"We all enjoyed our stay twice, May 26th before our cruise and June7th after the Cruise. The hotel was very handy to the city sites of Dublin and we all enjoyed being able to walk to each of them. Meals were exceptional.",5,2018,06,11
231,Jury's Inn,"The room was nice,  great to use for just a place to sleep.  It was walking distance to transportation and only 10-25 minutes walking to all the must see areas in Dublin. We did not eat any of the food but prices were comparable

Breakfast was tasty with an excellent selection buffet. Rooms were comfortable and very quiet which we were not expecting given the city location. Brilliant hotel!,4,2018,06,10
231,Friendly and Helpful Atmosphere in a Nice Hotel,"This hotel turned out to be much better than I expected. I was a bit worried about the location because we usually stay in South Dublin, but it turned out to be very convenient, especially with the Luas now open. The hotel seems to be very contemporary. The rooms are spacious and the beds extremely comfortable. Our room faced an inner courtyard, so was quiet. We had booked a meeting room for our small group and it was set up well. Anything we asked for or needed was provided with a smile. It was a pleasure staying there. Also there's a convenience store next door and a Tesco across the street. ",5,2018,06,10
231,Great stay in Dublin,"Great location, clean and air conditioned rooms. Service was excellent. Breakfast was very nice. Great value for the money. I thought one of the best stays on our travels through Ireland and London...",5,2018,06,09
231,First Time In Dublin,"There was nothing special about this hotel, especially for the price.  We had a view of the rooftop air conditioning units. And it wasn't in a very good location.  Staff was nice enough, but not very helpful when we asked about getting a bus to Gaway.",3,2018,06,08
231,Appallingly over priced,"Can’t believe other guest reviews
This is so over priced....
If you are paying under 150 euro then ok but anything above that is a serious rip off
This is just a three star hotel... nothing more. Don’t pay higher prices for this as it is so so average. Clean but ordinary and very very very over priced. Dont buy breakfast... go for a walk down the street.... so so much better value.",1,2018,06,08
231,Great Hotel,"Stayed here in February 2018 with Friends and found it provided everything we needed. It is my second stay at this hotel and it is in an ideal location, being just a 10 minute walk along O’Connel Street to the Temple Bar area.

Would definitely recommend, accommodation is good quality and relatively modern as you’d expect with a Jury’s Inn. ",4,2018,06,08
231,Great Hotel,"Awesome room, great service, nothing more needs said. I don't see why this needs to be 200 characters though as there was nothing more I can really add other than it was a great stay and would go again.",5,2018,06,08
231,G. O’Connor,Repeat customer and never dissatisfied. Stayed in courtyard room which was v. quiet for a city centre hotel. V. friendly and helpful staff. Lovely king size comfortable bed. Celebrating a birthday and was given some lovely surprises!,5,2018,06,07
231,Good value and nice location,"We stayed one night as a stopover to Paris and enjoyed the hotel and the area. The room was what I expected but nothing fancy. We were able to walk to the Temple Bar area, Trinity College, and the Dublin Castle, and we had a great meal at the pub up the street. The room was very quiet.",4,2018,06,06
231,Overnight stay,Great location and within walking distance of the city centre. Wondeful array of breakfast options in a light and airy dining room! Very helpful reception staff who provided us with sightseeing information.,5,2018,06,05
231,Not a bad stay but needs improvement,"Bedroom very clean, room service pizza very nice. 
View from room was awful - over looking a recycling place that was very noisy if window left open. 
Most staff have minimal English skills and found hard to understand us. Therefore didn’t come over particularly friendly. 
Value for money was OK. ",3,2018,06,05
231,"Very nice hotel in a great location, next to O'Connell Street.","This is a very nice hotel.  The lobby is modern and even smells great.  The front desk staff is very helpful and provided great recommendations for dinner.  The rooms are decent sized and the bed was SUPER comfortable!  The hotel is located right next to O'Connell Street and an easy walk to Temple Bar area.  There is no parking on-site, but you can park at the Clery's Car Park and get a discount.  It's about an 8-10 min walk to the hotel.  There is a bar and restaurant on-site.  Didn't try the restaurant but definitely enjoyed the bar.  Would stay again!",5,2018,06,04
231,Dublin,"This hotel was a reasonable hotel. The room was clean, bed was comfortable, air con worked and bathroom was OK too. The shower water didn’t back up so at least they must clear the hair gunk regularly. Didn’t sleep much because we were given room 202 right at the front overlooking a main road and the soundproofing was rubbish. Wasn’t asked at checkout how was our stay so I guess they must have known it was noisy. Didn’t enquire if there was a quieter room so can’t complain too much. ",3,2018,06,04
231,Girls trip,"For a big birthday celebration myself and 7 friends went to Jurys Parnell Street.. the hotel was secure, close to train station, shops, bars and restaurants.. breakfast was great a buffet style with hot and cold choices. ",5,2018,06,04
231,Great location perfect stay,"Fantastic hotel stayed for two nights.

231,Mike M from Canada,Overall very good - expectations certainly met - staff are approachable and friendly - location fantastic - minor cosmetic improvements needed - food quality and selection were great - definitely recommend this hotel,4,2018,06,04
231,Ideally located... recommended,"Nice clean, friendly hotel right in the middle of Dublin. Excellent based to explore from.
Desk staff were very friendly and professional. Room size (Double + two Singles) was good, and it was nice to have a bath/tub (seemingly rare these days).
",5,2018,06,04
231,Very pleasant staff,The staff at the hotel couldn't have been more helpful. My husband is disabled and received help with such kindness. Nothing was too much trouble particularly in the dining room where I have yet to meet the staff's equivalent in helpfulness. First class service and an excellent breakfast.,4,2018,06,04
231,Excellent Location,"Nice hotel in fabulous location. We were checked into a corner room which had lovely views over Dublin and the market street below. The staff were all very very friendly, breakfast was nice with a large selection.",5,2018,06,04
231,Very Pleasant Stay,"We stayed here two nights at the beginning of our trip and again on our last night. The room was very comfortable and the hotel is well located in this compact city. We walked all over, but the Hop-on-Hop-off bus stop is right around the corner if that's your preference. Huge variety in the included breakfast buffet. Staff is very helpful. Absolutely no complaints!",5,2018,06,03
231,Dublin Vacation,"The hotel is in a wonderful location. My room had clearly been renovated and was extremely modern with a great bathroom. Very easy to get a cab from the hotel to any location you are going in Dublin. Most places are in easy walking distance from the hotel. The restaurant was nice, had a good breakfast buffet and ate there one night for dinner. The bar in the hotel is great. Overall very friendly people, great location and very clean.",5,2018,06,03
231,American Couple Visiting,We stayed at the Jury’s Inn at Parnell Square and enjoyed it very much. The location is very good for getting around Dublin and for access to tourist buses if that’s your thing. The hotel is in an active part of Dublin so there is noise outside but the windows have been fitted with double panes of glass so there is very little noise heard in the room when you have the windows closed up. The beds are great to sleep on and the Irish Breakfast is fantastic. If you’re a breakfast person you should pay the advance rate which is cheaper. ,4,2018,06,03
231,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel,friendly staff,excellent location,good value for money. The food in the hotel restaurant is good.we traveled as a family of 5 and really enjoyed ourselves.the room was clean and modern,we would love to return.",5,2018,06,02

staff are friendly and are always there to assist you if you have any concern, issues, etc.
there is also large family rooms for families going there on holiday.",4,2018,06,01
231,Overnight stay,"We visited Dublin for a concert. All hotel prices appeared to be higher as a result and I wish we had booked earlier. 

I was pleased with our choice it was very near to the airport bus and location wise it was great for us almost on O’Connell street and close to temple bar.

Check in was fine and service excellent. Room was clean and we had a good nights sleep. Breakfast was plentiful. I would not hesitate to stay again. ",5,2018,05,31
231,Wonderful,The view from our room was not great but being in the middle of the city it wasn't a problem. I came to Dublin (where I was born)to celebrate my 70th birthday so it is unlikely I will return but I enjoyed every moment of my stay.,5,2018,05,30
231,Nice hotel located near the Temple bar district ,"Nice hotel, just a few blocks back from the river and walking distance to Temple Bar district and fun shops. They also have parking in the back. They will give you 50% off your parking at the front desk. Modern renovations. Very nice place to stay.",4,2018,05,29
231,Great short stay,"Staying here for 3 nights (2 adults and 2 children). It’s very central. 10-15 minute walk to Temple Bar. Very close to O’Connell Street which is where all the buses and trams go from and plenty of restaurants.

The breakfast is lovely, even though you help yourself to everything (including cutlery!) There is a great choice of food.

One thing to note-you need your key card to operate the lift (which I can understand helps make the hotel safer/secure ) and also to use the toilets by the main restaurant/bar on the second floor - which did seem odd.

There is a Tesco opposite which is handy for snacks/drinks etc!

The hotel room is clean and spacious for the 4 of us, the children have full size proper beds. 

We had a great time. ",4,2018,05,29
231,Nice location,"Stayed here for three nights.  Friendly and professional staff.  We had breakfast only once for £11.00 each, tasty and a great variety.  Note to other travellers, there is no safe in room, but they do have safety deposit boxes in the lobby at no cost, just asked reception.",4,2018,05,29
231,Well designed room and good facilities,"A well thought out design of room, the 10 euro buffet breakfast worth it, and service excellent. In addition, the new tram (Luas) line now stops doors from the hotel entrance. Location is not in the center of Dublin, but within easy (and interesting) walking distance of it. Also the trams take you everywhere. ",5,2018,05,29
231,Nice hotel with an excellent and friendly staff,"We spent four nights in this hotel and it was a good choice.

Pros:
great situated hotel
simply furnished spacious room
friendly staff and excellent service
tasty full Irish breakfast

Cons:
it could be a better bathroom",5,2018,05,29
231,Dublin 2018,"Excellent staff, service and great pizza from Room Service. We stayed for 3 nights and it was absolutely faultless. Would highly recommend staying here and the ice machine was heaven on earth - what a marvellous idea!!",5,2018,05,29
231,Lovely hotel,"We stayed for 2 nights at this lovely hotel! It’s in a great location just around the corner from O’Connell Street a short walk down to the river Liffey. We hadn’t booked breakfast as we thought we would have breakfast out but after looking around we decided that the all you can eat breakfast in hotel was a good deal, lots of variety and very fresh. I think we were lucky as we had what looked like a family room complete with sofa bed lots of space and very clean! This is our second stay at a Jury’s inn and would definitely recommend it!!",5,2018,05,29
231,Weekend stay,Although the hotel is in an excellent location and is very clean. The amount of people arriving or returning to the hotel in the middle of the night and causing a disturbance and causing disturbed sleep. On the second night it sounded like there was some work going on in the room above. Great location but over rated price for stay,2,2018,05,27
231,Really lovely,So near everything. Defiantly stay again. Lovely staff. Clean comfy perfect. Moore st famous food market just around the corner. Close to o Connell st. A few mins from the Luas. Breakfast was lovely. Everything was lovely.,5,2018,05,27
231,Excellent inner city accommodation,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the property was centrally located, close to markets, shopping and only a short walk to Trinity College and the book of Kells exhibit which was fantastic.  We had everything we needed for our comfort, staff very helpful. Thank you",5,2018,05,27
231,Check-in Mess,"This was the hotel for our final night of our Cosmos Irish Explorer tour in 2017.

We arrived in the city early and spent time downtown until check-in time.  Even then, most of the rooms were not ready, and so a great number of us stood in the lobby waiting for ONE young lady to sort it out ... while the other 3 or 4 clerks stood dumbly by.  I gather housekeeping was running behind.

I was not the last to get a room and I waited 30-45 minutes.

Other than that, the room was fine, with a king sized bed and nicely cool.  The breakfast buffet was okay, with ample seating.",3,2018,05,23
231,3.5,It’s location is perfect. It’s really close to a lot within walking distance. The staff were very nice and efficient. The room is ok. Coming from the US makes expectations different. It says it’s rated a 2.5 Star hotel overall but then you see 4.5 star rating by people so that makes you think ‘ok wow this will be awesome’. No fridge so don’t bring food. The breakfast was good. Tv was small but there is nothing to watch anyway. Room was tiny but we weren’t in there much. There was no top sheet (something between you and comforter) and no wash clothes. ,3,2018,05,23
231,"Excellent Hotel, highly recommended!","My Mother and Father stayed in this hotel and HIGHLY recommend it! Prior to visiting, the hotel staff were made aware that it was my Mothers birthday. When my parents arrived into their room, chocolates and a lovely card awaited them - a lovely personal touch, for which they were very grateful.

Breakfast was fantastic and the staff very helpful. The hotel is also close to nightlife and the Dublin shopping area, which is perfect for an overnight stay.

Overall, we highly recommend this hotel - thank you on behalf of both my parents for a wonderful stay!",5,2018,05,22
231,Short Break,"Hotel was fine but cost was over the top (Rolling Stones were in town).
Location nice and central and staff were courteous and helpful.
Would recommend to others at a better price > £400 for two nights bed and breakfast was over the top.

231,Environmentally Conscious Hotel,"We were greeted warmly by the the staff; questions were answered; reservations for taxi to airport were made. Room was clean and up to date.Beds were comfortable. This hotel  encourages sound sustainable practices. Excellent restaurant in the premises. We walked from the GoBus stop in just a few minutes in the daytime, and used taxi service to Heuston Station for early morning Railtour to Dingle one day and taxied to the airport. Very good experience.",4,2018,05,21
231,Great location,"Great, friendly staff. Great location. Only downside was no on-site carparking but they will direct to one close.
The breakfast was very good. The bar staff was very knowledgeable and answered all my questions...",4,2018,05,21
231,Wonderful Staff,"Stayed here for a few days last week for the Stones concert. Perfect location for middle between Temple Bar area and Croke Park - walk to both. Cant say enough about the staff at the hotel - very helpful and accommodating. Great breakfast was included in my package. I would have given it 5 stars but the bathroom just needs to be tweeked a bit...caulking had a bit of mold but honestly, worth the price for the convenience and the friendly staff. ",4,2018,05,21
231,Average nobody went above and beyond,"Hotel was 3 star quality! Customer service was average. Location hotel was good. Overall stay was average! Only two beds for 3 people. Good choice at breakfast however bacon was cheap bacon and my friend didn’t enjoy it, so ended up eating very little. Places close by for breakfast might of been a better option! Was a lot extra to add breakfast. Paying over £600 you would think breakfast would be included and would think three beds would be Available. House keeping should be aware that the room is for three so they can accommodate. No mini bar in the room, which would do liked! ",3,2018,05,21
231,Great Stay,"Great time at this hotel.  Entire staff was helpful.  One little weird thing, and I guess it was us, not them....  The key has to be used to activate lights in the room??  We had never encountered this on any travels, wish they had told us at check in.  Initially thought it was a problem with the rooms electric. Housekeeping staff was wonderful and showed me what to do.  Who knew, lol!",5,2018,05,18
231,Great Stay!,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell St.  It all started when I was able to check in early.  After an early morning flight, I greatly appreciated that I was able to get comfortable immediately.  The hotel is at a fantastic location.  It's close to so many shops and eateries.  There's even a Tesco across the street.  Hop-on/hop-off buses are located around the corner which was very convenient.  I also must compliment this hotel on the Gilchrist & Soames toiletries and the super comfortable bed.  Would highly recommend this hotel to my family and friends if they ever visit Dublin.",5,2018,05,18
231,So happy we chose this hotel,Dublin is an expensive city for lodging.  Jurys Inn Parnell Street is centrally located close to all transportation hubs and of good value.  We had the Executive Room and we’re very happy with our choice.  The breakfasts were very good and well worth the price.  ,5,2018,05,17

231,Great location for walking & exploring Dublin,"Really good place to stay - we spent five nights there while enjoying Dublin.  Great helpful & attentive staff - good security - wonderful reasonably priced breakfast buffet (incredible variety of dishes - if you can't find something to enjoy, it really is your fault).  Easy walking distance to central Dublin - or you can catch the LUAS if you are tired - there is a market right  around the corner.  Walls are a bit thin - but not a problem.  Room was clean & comfortable.",5,2018,05,15

231,A very good home to stay in an exciting city,"You feel very secure, all personnel is very friendly and helpful, especially when you are in trouble.
Breakfast is extraordinary variegated, the room was very quiet. The site is central, so that you can reach every place you want very easy.",5,2018,05,14
231,A modern but not a perfect hotel in Dublin,"This hotel is ranked to be one of the better in Dublin. It’s modern with nice rooms. However, the room was not soundproofed so we could hear what the people in the adjacent room were talking about. Internet 25 Mbit down and 23 up. Breakfast very good.",4,2018,05,14
231,Dublin visit,"An excellent hotel , with a wonderful and professional service. Thanks a lot for the lovely travel in Dublin. The breakfast was prefect and delicious. In addition, the location of the hotel is just perfect for a small walk in Dublin. I really enjoy the few days spent in your Hotel with my wife. ",4,2018,05,13
231,Excellent Hotel for a City Break,"Great location 10 minutes walk up O'Connell street from the heart of the city
We went with 18 others for a long weekend to celebrate my sisters 40th birthday.
Checkin was great we got our room at 10am although others waited until 2ish.
Breakfast was very nice. Bar was great - good range of drinks and quite reasonable.
Dinner was very nice - we had a dinner for 20 and the chef devised a special set menu for us which was delicious. Staff were very helpful - they even put up helium baloons, and took delivery of the birthday cake from the bakers, put the candles in and brought it out lit after dessert.
No hesitation recommending this hotel - it's not a cheap hotel - upper midrange i'd say but worth it for the location and service provided. Staff even took my online checkin documents from me by email, printed and delivered to my room.",5,2018,05,12
231,Breakfast food and service.,We usually stay at one of the Jury hotels when in Ireland and we were once again very happy with the service of the employees. “Liz” our service attendant was especially nice and attentive during the fabulous morning breakfast. Will definitely stay again.,5,2018,05,12
231,"Nice hotel, great location","We stayed here for a 4-day trip to Dublin.  The hotel is nice and the staff are very friendly and helpful.  Our room was clean, had everything we needed and was always returned to pristine condition when we returned to it after a day's sightseeing.  Location is great as you're on a main bus / tram route and just round the corner from O'Connell Street.  The buffet breakfast is good value and has a wide range of food and drinks.  The only downside - the free WiFi is rubbish.",4,2018,05,11
231,Good location,"My wife and I booked this hotel for a 4 night stay in Dublin.
Easy transfer on the Airport bus to close by.
Hotel is clean and functional.
Slightly corporate than quirky but room was spacious and staff friendly.
Only had breakfast one morning but it was decent and good value
Location is good for exploring what Dublin has to offer",4,2018,05,10
231,A Gem of a hotel in Dublin,"Myself and my friend stayed at Jury's Inn, Parnell Street for 1 night last week.  It was fabulous from check-in to check-out.  All staff very friendly and helpful especially Liz - lovely lady! The rooms was very clean and comfortable. A great breakfast in the morning too with plenty of choice. Only a short walk to main attractions.  Will definitely be back. Thank You.",5,2018,05,10
231,Great stay in perfect location,"A great few days here. We’ve been to Dublin a few times and stayed in other hotels however this has been the best all round experience.
We arrived to be greeted by Petra on reception. She was smiley and extremely helpful throughout. This was a really good first impression. On checkout, a smooth and efficient service yet again.
All staff throughout were really friendly and helpful, including Louisa and Simon in the hotel bar.
Hotel is modern and clean. Room was immaculate.
We will definitely be back there!",5,2018,05,09
231,Good location and comfortable beds,"Great location. On one night there was a large group of females next to us who were very loud which wasnt ideal as we were there as a family but i was so tired from travelling I managed to sleep ok despite them but can't fault the hotel. Lovely staff. Clean and also mini gym which we used before we left. 
Good location as it's right next to city centre.",4,2018,05,09

231,A fine hotel in Dublin,"Everything was to our satisfaction. We celebrated my husbands 80th birthday with our best friends and my brother and his girlfriend. It was a very good hotel with very service minded people in the breakfast area, the frontdesk as well as in the bar. However, the keys didnt always work my way!",4,2018,05,09

231,Bit of a let down,"We've been here previously and had a pleasant stay. Unfortunately this time wasn't up to the previous standard. The hotel bar staff were excellent but unfortunately other guests arrived in a very drunken state - the kind of state that would likely have seen them refused entry to other bars in town. They began harassing others, so we made a hasty exit. Another earlier customer had a verbal disagreement with the barman too, so there was just generally an unsavoury atmosphere. We had arranged a late check out for 2pm but the cleaners arrived at 12 asking why we hadn't checked out. We also had a phone call from reception at 130 asking the same question. ",3,2018,05,08
231,Centrally located,"We stayed 5 days here in an executive room.  The room was very comfortable and kept clean.  It is right in the middle Dublin, we could get anywhere we wanted to go very easily by bus,, tram or walking.  The breakfast was very nice and certainly the atmosphere was lovely.  We enjoyed dinner in there restaurant and also enjoyed drinks in the lovely bar/lounge.  All the staff was very friendly and accommodating. ",5,2018,05,08
231,J Hughes,"Very nice stay here , excellent service throughout the stay by all members of the team, one lady especially who worked in the resteraunt at breakfast time named Liz couldnt do enough for us, was chatty and friendly. The rooms were great, the breakfast was amazing and the sevice top notch.. ticked all the boxes.",5,2018,05,08
231,Good hotel,The room was clean and cozy. I loved that they had plenty of coffee and extras. Usa is skimpy on those amenities. The bed was a little to firm for my liking but that's just me. Housekeeping was wonderful . The restaurant food was good. Aosife ( hope I spelled it correctly) was wonderful. Very friendly and helpful.,4,2018,05,06
231,Debbie’s review,"When we arrived it was late and we were greeted by staff in a very friendly manner with quick service. The room was fresh, clean and very quiet. Our bed was very comfortable. The location was so convenient to shops and transport. The hop on hop off bus was just around the corner which we planned to use. The Jury’s Inn helped make our visit to Dublin, a very pleasant one.",5,2018,05,05
231,What I expected,"Clean, well organized, great breakfast, excellent staff, centrally located. Other amenities were available but we didn’t have time to take advantage of them. Transportation, good shopping and restaurants nearby. 

We would return. If any negative, perhaps a little pricey.",4,2018,05,04
231,Good hotel for a short trip to Dublin,My wife was on a course in Dublin so we decided to make a small trip out of it and head down early the day before. We arrived Jury's checked in and headed to our room. the room was clean and perfect for what we needed.  Would use again.,4,2018,05,04
231,Excellent,My stay was very pleasant and the staff was great amd very helpful. I would recommend this hotel for anyone staying in dublin city centre or surrounding areas. The rooms were very clean and the beds were very comfortable.,5,2018,05,04
231,Good downtown location,"Quiet stay in a safe, drab property which is located in the heart of the north part of the city. Restaurant and bar were satisfactory. On the whole the experience of a six-night stay in this property was good, but not inexpensive.",4,2018,05,04
231,Great value in the heart of town,"Very comfortable beds with full fibre pillows. The room 316 that I had was mostly quiet even though on the road side, due to good windows. 

Bathroom is a reasonable size with good water pressure.

What makes it stand out is for 3 star you get a 4 star breakfast! In a large dining room on the second floor, there’s plenty of room and huge choice.

Including gluten free options such as GF bread and cereal with a separate toaster!

",4,2018,05,04
231,Jury’s Inn,Beautiful rooms superbly located. Breakfast is delightful and the bar is elegant. I would definitely return. The hotel even provided us with a free upgrade and drinks at the bar. Service was very friendly.,5,2018,05,03
231,Our Stay at Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street,The restaurant at the hotel great. Our waitress Aorife is the best. LOVE HER!!! The staff were very helpful and made our stay there a wonderful  experience. We were treated like V.I.Ps and we felt very safe and  secure  there.,5,2018,05,03
231,Great hotel,"An excellent location: walking distance to everywhere I wanted to go - hoho bus stop; Temple Bar; Ha'penny Bridge; trams, particularly to get to the Guiness Storehouse.

The room is a good sized room.

Breakfast is a good, enjoyable buffet offering eggs, meats, cereals, bread, juices and tea/coffee. A filling breakfast.

The service by the staff was second to none.

The hotel is only a 5 walk from the Number 747 bus stop, which runs to/from Dublin Airport.

I would highly recommend staying at Jurys Inn Parnell Street.",5,2018,05,02
231,The matresses are terrible,"The room was ok and the breakfast was nice, but the mattresses were terrible. Not firm at all and I hurt my back. The location is superb none the less. There is no fridge in the room so there is no way to keep your water cold (although there is an ice machine near the lift). It´s very uncomfortable that the hotel doesn´t have it´s own parking but they validate your parking ticket at Q parking nearby so that the maximum per day is 10 Euros. We had a booking made months ago for a room with a view but they didn´t have one available when we arrived and they didn´t quite know why. The hinges in the bathroom door where terribly dirty. The bath-tub had great water preassure but the shower surprisingly did not.",2,2018,05,02
231,Very pleasantly surprised in fact BRILLIANT," After reading all the reviews we chose this hotel over the other Jury’s in the city. I wasn’t expecting the earth but have to say we couldn’t fault a thing overall. Everything was brilliant the staff, the location, the rooms, the bar everything with the slight exception (and it is only a little niggle)  of needing key cards to access the lifts and loos (once outside your rooms) I fully understand why this has to be but was sometimes a little annoying when they wouldn’t swipe... This however was always sorted quickly and professionally, so over all couldn’t fault a thing. Will definitely be staying here again and hopefully sooner rather than later...",5,2018,05,02
231,the jury inn,"great location but not value for money 1st night member of staff was arguing outside our bedroom door second night children running through the hallways and 3rd morning being woken up by next doors hairdryer in the early hours , paying what we paid i excepted a bit more than what we got ",3,2018,05,01
231,recent visit to Dublin for special birthday,"Our recent visit to this hotel was quite enjoyable, however it was slightly spoilt.  We had been treated by my Daughter for this trip to celebrate my 60th birthday and had pre arranged as a surprise for me to have flowers, card and bottle of wine but upon arrival this had sadly been forgotten. My partner had to speak with my Daughter, who in turn spoke to the receptionist. They kindly arranged for a small gift of a mini bottle of prosecco to be obtained from the bar ( This should have been a bottle of wine in my room) I did get a small gift chocolate box along with a card from management. As they had made the error, my Daughter would have been a lot more satisfied and happier had I been given what had been pre-arranged. 
Our room was very clean and comfortable and the location of hotel perfect, as was away from the hustle and bustle but not too far from everything. The only gripe I had was when we asked several times where various locations of pubs/churches and places of interest were, the staff had to consult google! We could do this ourselves and didnt bother again. It would be beneficial if all staff at the hotel had some form of knowledge of the local area. 
I would have given 4 stars had my experience been what my Daughter had anticipated. ",3,2018,05,01
231,Excellent hotel,"A lovely hotel.  Very comfortable, clean and welcoming and the staff were most helpful.  Absolutely fantastic location too. I can certainly recommend this hotel and would happily stay here again next time I'm in Dublin. ",5,2018,05,01
231,Great hotel,"Myself & my family stayed here for a long weekend. Our room was clean & very comfortable as was our bed. 

The breakfast is delicious, the staff are very friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble. One member of staff was so lovely but unfortunately I didn't get her name. ( mature lady tall large build greying hair) she was fantastic, hope the hotel know who I mean! 
The kids loved their stay there. I'll be back soon.",5,2018,04,30
231,G FITZ,The hotel was in a great location and was easy to get to from the Airport. It was very clean and tidy and the staff were excellent and nothing was to much trouble for them. The breakfast was great and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.,5,2018,04,30
231,"Overall good, but ...","Excellent location in the centre of Dublin and so close to all the sightseeing stuff which was ideal for me, a first time visitor. The rooms were clean and comfortable as one would expect from this chain. However, there was a 'flip' side. The biggest problem was the timing of the breakfast, which started at 7.00. We had to leave before 7.00 in order to catch a re-scheduled Irish Ferry back to Holyhead. There is no room service breakfast and, on explaining to staff that we would have to check out at 6.45, and so miss breakfast, no alternative (coffee and croissants in our rooms would have been nice) was offered.Consequently, we had no breakfast for which we had paid.We cannot have been the only people needing to leave early in the tourist season in order to catch ferries and flights, and the hotel should look at this as a matter of urgency.
Our car park ticket was validated at reception (but not, as in other hotels, such as the Marriott chain) paid for. However, obviously the validation (by a supervised trainee) hadn't worked as we had to ask for assistance when we got to the pay station in the car park. A new ticket was issued promptly, but this built in a delay and additional stress when time was of the essence.
While the rooms were comfortable, it was a bit alarming to have booked a double room and to find only one chair - and to be allocated a disabled person's room when one wasn't requested. However, the wet room worked well but having toiletries in dispensers and no bottled water in the room was disappointing, given the price paid.
The breakfast was adequate, although staff were slow replacing items. The lack of sufficient soft fruit to accompany the cereals (a small amount at the bottom of a kilner jar was hardly adequate) and there were none left when I arrived at the appropriate counter. The lack of range of items on offer was disappointing.
So, the hotel wins on location, but looses on the touches that would have made our stay truly enjoyable.",3,2018,04,30
231,Review,"Everything was good except the birds issue living on the roof or in the walls of our suite. Could not figure out where they were living, but heard them at various times of the day. Location was between the bathroom ad living room wall.",4,2018,04,30
231,Great place to stay in Dubln,"Jurys Inn was an excellent place to stay in Dublin,
The staff were very attentive and made you feel very welcome.
The rooms are spacious and well appointed and for people who are very fussy about the beds we found the Jury Inn beds extremely comfortable.
Also the position is perfect being next to the main shopping mall with trams and buses outside the front door.
Stay here you'll love it.",5,2018,04,30
231,Great place to stay,"Lovely Hotel, Friendly staff and very clean. This hotel is very central so handy to see all the sites. Breakfast was excellent, and there is a really nice bar to have that last drink at night.  I would recommend this hotel.",5,2018,04,30
231,Happy we stayed at this hotel....,"Overall, a positive stay. Great location from Temple Bar, Trinity College areas and to pick up the green or red Hop On, Hop Off bus tours. Dinner room service was quick, affordable, reasonable and large portion sizes. The negatives were: the mattress, needs replacing; our room was overlooking the back alley way/parking lot/hotel's trash compactor--it was quite noisy.  ",4,2018,04,29
231,Cozy hotel and very caring staff members,"A very obvious fact, its a perfect location to stay, in the center of the city, with easy access to temple bar and all the great attractions and good restaurants. Staff members are amazing, helpful and very caring, readily available to help you out with any information you need. Special mention to Andrada.  Here check in was really fast. Suggest you make sure to book the breakfast buffet when you book your stay here.",5,2018,04,27
231,Best hotel in central dublin,"Have stayed here a few times with my family & cannot fault it in any way, i find hotels never leave enough towels, pillows or cups in a family room but these have plenty of each, in other words the children are never forgotten about! Rooms are plenty big & very clean, great central location, thank you for a lovely stay yet again ",5,2018,04,27
231,Amazing staff - especially Petra!,I stayed at Jury's Inn over the Christmas holiday and had such a wonderful experience.  The rooms were spacious and the beds were very comfortable.  The tub was great for soaking in hot water after a long day of walking around Dublin.  But I really want to highlight the staff.  The front desk staff was incredibly helpful and kind when I figured out I'd lost my wallet 3.5 hours away from Dublin.  Petra was especially helpful in contacting the place I left it and following up with me.  She never made me feel like I was bothering her and was so kind when I was very upset.  And when I told her I had gotten my wallet back she was genuinely happy for me!  I was traveling alone during the holidays and it was so nice to have a friendly person to talk to when I was having trouble.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will absolutely stay here again when I'm back in Dublin.,5,2018,04,27
231,Perfekt location ,"Its has a perfect location near shopping and only 5 min walk to temple bar. Check in was really fast, the staff in reception was so helpfull. Make sure to book the breakfastbuffet when you book your stay here. The breakfastbuffet is really good. Near the busstop to the airport.",4,2018,04,26
231,Great location,Hotel good in every way especially location .Staff polite and efficient. Shopping centres just 5 minutes away. We loved the atmosphere in the pubs close by.Just round the corner is the coach direct to the airport.,4,2018,04,25
231,Nice stay,"Good Location, Ok price, rooms are fine, probably need updating.

Staff Lovely.

If you have a car and need to park they have a car park within 5 mins walk which you get a discounted price so do ask at reception as it is 10EUROS for 24 hours instead of 30EUROS",4,2018,04,25
231,JURYS INN DUBLIN,"I want to felicitate the restaurant and the hotel Jurrys INN Parnell Street . Andrew and the crew are very good . If you go to Dublin , you can choose this hotel . Marc Sabates qui remercie du coeur tout le personnel et je reviendrais très vite chez vous .",5,2018,04,24
231,Great trip to Dublin,"I arrived and checked in without hassle. My room was on the same floor as the restaurant and if I remember correctly the number was 240. The room was clean and well presented with adequate facilities, the hotel is in quite a central location on Parnell Street with easy access for buses to the airport and it is about 15 minutes walk from Connolly Train Station. The restaurant had a good menu though the prices were a little high, the breakfast was also very good too. I would definitely recommend.",4,2018,04,24
231,Good location - comfortable stay,"Nice hotel in good location - 10 mins walk to Temple Bar but further enough away not to be too noisy, surrounding back streets a little shabby and prob not advisable to walk alone late at night however only 2 min walk to main street.  Speedy check in with friendly and informative reception staff.  Nice room, comfy bed and decent bathroom, ice machines in corridor which was a nice touch, tea/coffee in our room (330) but no safe or fridge. Bar and breakfast area look recently re-furbished, pleasant areas to eat and drink.  Breakfast wasn’t too bad - reasonable choice and quality.",4,2018,04,24
231,Great stay.,"This was a very pleasant hotel. It was clean, well located, spacious, quiet, and had comfortable beds. It did not have a minibar or refrigerator which we missed. Coffee was provided in the room, but only instant. ",5,2018,04,24
231,Perfect location,"Stayed here for 3 nights for my mums birthday, location of the hotel is excellent as it is 10 minute walk to temple bar and about 2 minute walk to the shops. Hotel was clean and well presented and staff friendly. I would stay here again :)",4,2018,04,24
231,Lovely,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying in Jury's Inn as a belated birthday present and to see a concert. On arrival we were greeted by a lovely receptionist called Petra. She asked was this stay an occasion and when told she gave us a voucher for 2 complementary drinks from the bar.  Our room was very comfortable looking out on a busy Parnell Street.   The bar and restaurant are both on 2nd floor and you have the same menu in both so can eat in whichever you fancy.  Nice friendly young barman.  We were surprised tho that there not a more stylish 'uniform', the bar and restaurant staff were wearing tshirt and jeans and an apron on top.   Breakfast was pretty good but as we like tomato juice there was none. When asked was there any the waitress said it would be impossible.  Also no mushrooms either which is unusual really with having a cooked breakfast. Not the end of the world tho. O'Connell street is only a couple of minutes away so very handy. Temple Bar I reckon is about 10 mins away. Very touristy place and very busy. Great atmosphere and so many different accents.  On leaving the receptionist called a taxi for us to Connolly Station and it arrived immediately . All in all we had a lovely pleasant stay. ",5,2018,04,24
231,Fantastic Stay,"The hotel is in an excellent location, easy walking distance to all the main sites. The staff were all friendly and very helpful. The room was a really good size and quiet considering you are in the middle of a big city. The bar and restaurant were also very nice. We also enjoyed Murray's Pub which is just round the corner for drink's and food. ",5,2018,04,24
231,Not up to par,Though I had been quoted one price when my wife checked in she was charged more money.  Then when it was corrected she was charged extra 'in case' we spent more.  Strange policy - why should you hold my money???,1,2018,04,23
231,Perfect location but no car park,Lovely hotel with friendly staff. We had a 5th floor inside room with a beautiful view of the hotel courtyard. It doesn't have it's own carpark but they have a good deal with a nearby carpark so it wasn't a major factor. ,5,2018,04,23
231,Nice hotel with reasonable quietness,"Stayed here for 3 nights recently. No problems with drunks singing all night or yelling which happens quite often in Dublin. Good breakfast buffet with the usual items. Close enough to walk to Temple Barr or shopping but far enough away to be somewhat quiet. Staff was pleasant, rooms reasonable and clean. Only downside is parking which is offsite and costs 28EU for 24hrs, or you can book online and save 8EU but you must book at least 24hrs in advance.",4,2018,04,22
231,"Nice hotel, overall good stay within a good location of Dublin City.","Me and my partner stayed here early April time for two nights for a nice city break to Dublin. Overall it was a nice hotel, standard room, bathroom, breakfast buffet and bar.

We checked in fine, we couldn't get our room until 2pm so we left our luggage with staff and returned later. When we got into our room it was pretty standard, with a kettle, hair dryer and TV. The bar had a good atmosphere, was a nice place to chill out for a short time. 

As I am gluten-free, I made staff aware via email about my stay and also informed them when checking in. The breakfast buffet was your typical layout with the usual foods, there was a small GF section including bread (with a toaster) one choice of cereal, fruit, yogurt however I spoke to a waitress and she was very helpful. She kindly asked the chef to cook my eggs and bacon separately to avoid cross-contamination. Four mins later she popped back out with my hot breakfast. Sausage was also available but took 10-15mins so I passed on that.

Rooms & bathroom were cleaned daily if you wanted. Not the best view from our room but it is the city centre.

Checking out was made more difficult by staff unfortunately, we simply asked the staff member to book us a taxi. The next morning, one day before we left - we thought we'd double check it went through ok... it didn't and the member of staff didn't book! So on the afternoon of us leaving, we asked once more just in case and again, no taxi!! Luckily another taxi came five mins later! I told the manager about this, not sure if she was too bothered.

Overall, I'd recommend this hotel for a short stay, standard hotel overall. We had picked this hotel for it's location.",4,2018,04,22
231,Good choice,"Stayed here for three nights and found it to be very good. Staff were very pleasant and very helpful. The menu for dinner was a little limited but it was cooked very well and we enjoyed it. 
The hotel's location is excellent for a base north of the river, just round the corner from O'Connell Street.
Would stay there again.",4,2018,04,20
231,Great location and welcoming hotel,"This hotel is in an excellent location to walk to all the sights of Dublin and/or shopping ! Whilst it is an older style hotel it is spotlessly clean.  Excellent bed linen and comfy beds.  The breakfast buffet is one of the best we have had - with hot breakfast and/or the usual fruit, fruit salad, yoghurt, meats, cheese, variety of breads and pastries - great coffee and tea.  It was included in our room rate or otherwise E11.  Little touches on our floor included newspapers and fresh apples to grab from a bowl.  Good bar on second floor to relax and standard food from the bar and restaurant but well cooked.   For pricey Dublin this is a terrific hotel to stay in, great value,  and clearly from the number of fellow guests booked in others think so too.",4,2018,04,19
231,Jury's Inn parnell st,"Lovely hotel with some really friendly staff.The breakfast was the nicest I've had in awhile, with a great selection.Drinks at the bar were a bit pricey but maybe that's everywhere in Dublin.Fantastic location .Would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,04,18
231,very nice stay,the stay was very relaxing and close to everything we wanted to see very friendly staff and very nice hotel i will definitely be booking this hotel again and will recommend it to all my friends and family,5,2018,04,18
231,Excellent,"Jury’s in staff went above and beyond with my trip. It was my partners birthdsy, they gave us 2 commitmentry drinks of anything we wanted. And the day of her birthday they left balloons card and chocolates in our room! All the staff were friendly and helpful. Excellent location, Tesco/aldi/McDonald’s/shopping centre all around the corner. And a 10 minute walk to temple bar and the main bars. Excellent location. Highly recommend. We stayed for 3 nights for a birthday drinking weekend and loved every minute of it ",5,2018,04,17
231,Breakfast,"We had an appointment in the Rotunda and my wife was exhausted after being in the hospital so early and we had our 6wks son with us.
We when to Jury's for something to eat
The hotel was still doing breakfast for guests.  We explained we were not staying there.
There was a very nice young man looking after the tables.  
He explained there was no problem, showed us to a lovely table which suited a pram.
The breakfast was 11 euros each and gave us access to buffet.  It was a great breakfast.
I asked about a changing area for our son.  The young man gave us a card to access the toilet but only after checking for us that it had a baby changing area.
I can't recommend this hotel enough and lucky you if you stayed here.
To the management who might read this,  this young man is worth his weight in gold as he made a great impression and seem to treat all customers with this type of great attitude.  I didn't see his name badge but was looking after tables on Tuesday 17th of June.
Top class hotel.  We might just stay there ourselfs even though we live in Dublin.",5,2018,04,17
231,4 day stay.Well done Jurys,4 day stay.Hotel was in good location and spotlessly clean and excellent service.The breakfast was really good value but it was the same products every day so a change of products would be a good idea.Staff were very pleasant,5,2018,04,17
231,Jan from Gloucestershire,"A very enjoyable stay. Location excellent to lots of amenities. Breakfast very good choices and was served at good time just in case you needed a little lie in after late night. Bed very comfortable. Room clean. So  convenient to O'Connell street where we caught the express coach to and from airport without any problems. 
No complaints.",4,2018,04,17
231,Jury’s Inn Parnell Street,"Excellent location, around the corner from O’Connell Street. Tour buses and airport bus pick-up and drop off right there! 10 min easy stroll to Temple bar and all other sites. Easy check in process. They will hold your bags if you arrive on early morning flight. Excellent breakfast that can come with your room rate. Very friendly and professional staff. Comfortable and quite room. This is our second stay and will come back again!",5,2018,04,17
231,Ideal,"Ideal location to get around Dublin coming out of hotel turn left then left again walk down the road takes you into a great shopping area. Close also to temple bar but far enough away not to be disturbed by the party animals, The dubliners are the most polite, happy people I've had the pleasure to meet.
Great hotel, great breakfast, great sleep, great hotel ",5,2018,04,17
231,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel right in the city centre. Close to all amenities. If book in advance, you get good price for family. Good choice for breakfast. Room was too small for family of 4 and sofa bed wasn’t comfortable. Remote control wasn’t working. ",4,2018,04,17
231,"Good location, good service.","The staff was very nice. If you are a good on foot you don't need to use taxi. Everything we where looking for is in 10 km. radius from the hotel. Interesting things to look at, shops and restaurant's ",5,2018,04,17
231,Dublin in three days,"My sister and I, just have this short journey in Dublin and we stayed in Juris Inn Hotel, which is very good and the position is near O' Connell street which is the main street. We are very satisfied about the service and the position of the Hotel.",5,2018,04,17
231,"Brilliant Stay, Excellent Location","Room was a standard double room, nothing fancy, but spotless........you only sleep there really.  Excellent location to the city centre.  Staff very helpful, breakfast good.  Bar prices a touch high, but you don't expect anything else from a hotel with a central location.",5,2018,04,15
231,Comfortable base to explore Dublin,"Although just a short trip we'd certainly choose this hotel again for a Dublin City Centre stay. It is very conveniently located just off North end of O'Connell Street and a few minutes' walk to the O'Connell bridge over the Liffey. Nearest 747 Airlink Bus Stop in Cathal Brugha Street. We booked a flight + hotel combination so don't know the exact hotel cost, but the package was very good value. We were greeted pleasantly on arrival, and although we were offered a room upgrade for reasonable charge, we didn't bother. The standard room was fine. Quite spacious, clean and with a good bath/shower; bed comfortable too though I found it a bit soft. The hotel was busy but we were not disturbed by noise. Excellent breakfast buffet with gluten free, vegetarian and lactose intolerant choices. All in all we were very satisfied with this stay.",4,2018,04,15
231,Family weekend base,Visited other family living nearby; this was central for everything we needed. O'Connell Street 200 metres away so excellent location as a base. Rooms are small but this is central Dublin; knew would pay more if wanted more facilities. ,4,2018,04,15
231,Great hotel in the heart of Dublin city centre,"This was our 2nd visit to Jury's Parnell Square and we can't fault it at all. Friendly, welcoming staff and fresh rooms with everything you need and an ideal location for exploring all that Dublin has to offer.

We were able to store our luggage securely on arrival and departure days which allowed us more time to explore this fabulous city. We also added breakfast at the hotel which is offered in a friendly and relaxing atmosphere. Liz in particular was very helpful and lovely to talk to. 

Highly recommend this hotel and we will definitely be back again! The staff really went out of their way to ensure our stay was a happy one!",5,2018,04,14
231,Great base,"Lovely central location, great staff knowledgeable about the local area. Ordering taxis no problem extra pillows not a problem. Fantastic breakfast, caters for everyone and nothing is too much trouble. ",4,2018,04,13
231,Perfect birthday break,Stayed at this Jury's Inn for 2 nights to celebrate my partners birthday. Our room was kindly upgraded before arrival and was ready before the normal check in time. We had a note in the room thanking us for booking on this ape I am occasion and offering us a free drink in the bar. There were also a birthday card and chocolates for my partner. A very special touch indeed. The room was very clean and modern. The view from room 410 was great. The road was noisy when the window was open but when closed you couldn't really hear anything which was a good sign. The bed was very comfortable. We ate in the restaurant one night and the food and service were to a high standard. We will be returning! ,5,2018,04,13
231,"Great value for money, convenient location.","Great little place, 3 star but with nice little touches that made it feel more like a 4 star property. Great breakfast, convenient location near Lucas and Airlink stops and 10 mins from Temple Bar. Definitely recommend.",5,2018,04,12
231,Easter in Dublin,The 6th time me and my wife we are in this hotel. We consider this hotel quite our 2nd house. We feel home. We found it in the web. The location is in a good place in the capitol for everything we need. ,4,2018,04,12
231,"Very Clean, Comfortable Hotel","Jurys Inn on Parnell Street is conveniently located 2-3 blocks off the O'Connell Street stop of the Air Coach (from Dublin Airport). We walked from our stop to the hotel in literally just a few minutes. Other than the lobby temperature feeling like a sauna, we found this hotel to be very clean and comfortable as well as aesthetically pleasing (modern décor). They had a nice bar and a separate restaurant, both with reasonable food prices, but the hotel is also close to shopping, many restaurants, bars, and the Irish Whiskey museum (Viking Tour about a 2k walk), so there's no need to stay in unless the weather is unfriendly. 
We had excellent service at the front desk, where they helped us with our airline check-in and printing out boarding passes and also excellent service in the bar and restaurant. I believe breakfast was included in our stay, but since we had to leave by 4 a.m. to catch our flight, didn't get a chance to sample it, so can't include it in the review. I would stay here again.",5,2018,04,10
231,Good but not Great,This place was highly recommended and we were looking forward to trying it.  Although some of the appetizers were excellent the entrees were disappointing.  One of the dishes had minimal flavor and the other was over salted.  May have been an off-night because of the weather (Hurricane Ophelia) so I might give it another try.,3,2018,04,10
231,Disappointed,"Good located, but poorly soundproofed and noise like on a bowling alley every midnight. Missing toilet brush and amenities in the bathroom. The gaps between the tiles and the walls where dirty and blotchy.",3,2018,04,09
231,Great location comfy clean room,"We had an executive room which was nice, room overlooking road could have been noisy but it was fine you do hear the tram bell ring but again not a problem.  Staff were good, hotel bar was pleasant.  We would stay again as it worked well for us.",4,2018,04,08
231,Beautiful,"This hotel is right in the city centre and is very convenient, you can access the bus stops easily, there are also a few restaurants and pubs nearby, but breakfast is included. The staff was also quite friendly.",5,2018,04,07
231,Ok,"Visited with my husband who was 
working in Dublin. Close to shops which was a positive and a good location. There was a small car park just down a side street.
The hotel room was small but adequate. Shame there was no mini bar. Ice available from a machine in the corridor though. Reception staff were friendly and I liked the idea that your key card was needed to operate the lift. Security staff a bit heavy handed when returning to the hotel on an evening demanding your room number when you can’t actually go anywhere except reception without a keycard anyway and it’s a pity they didn’t ask people not to smoke directly outside the hotel doors as it was distasteful having to walk through it and there was always the smell of smoke in the foyer.",3,2018,04,07
231,Great Hotel and worth the price! ,"My family and I stayed here over the Easter Holiday. We had a Superior room. We arrived to the hotel at 5:00 am and Ivan was beyond great! He had our room ready AND gave us complimentary drinks and a dessert because we didn’t have bottled water in our room. The most wonderful part is how my seven year old was treated. When we came back from sightseeing on Easter, a huge Easter basket with a note from the Easter bunny was in our room. I could not thank the hotel enough for making our experience so wonderful. The location is great and walking distance to everything. We utilized the my taxi app to get around and the taxis were there in less than 2 minutes. The breakfast was fine for a city hotel as well as the size of the room (small for three BUT this is a city hotel). We did not care that our room was small as we were only there to sleep. We had a room on the second floor and it was perfect! Thank you to the management and staff for such a pleasant stay. We will be staying at a Jurys Inn again! ",5,2018,04,07
231,Dissapointing hotel,"Do not upgrade executive room, really not worth it! Breakfast good although, don’t know how much we paid for it as we weren’t told! Noisy rooms overlooking the main road from the trams waking us at 6.45 with their  bells dinging! Location good",3,2018,04,06
231,"Great hotel, good location.","We stayed 4 nights at Jury’s over Easter and had a great stay. Staff are helpful and friendly, food was decent and the rooms were clean and modern. The location is also great, just 10 minutes walk to Temple Bar with plenty of cafes and shops around. Would definitely recommend. ",4,2018,04,06
231,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is about a 10 minute walk to temple bar area. Hotel rooms were nicely decorated and beds were very comfy. This is a very highly secured place which made me feel very safe. You can’t go anywhere in the hotel without using your room key. Not annoying at all when you are looking at it as a safety measure. Nicely located pretty close to bus stops for traveling, lots of food places and grocery stores. ",5,2018,04,05
231,Highly recommended ,"Great hotel, really enjoyed our stay. Staff are very friendly and welcoming. Food was good. And a huge thank you to hotel duty manager colm daly for  making our stay all then more enjoyable and his team who are all a compliments to the hotel.  ",5,2018,04,05
231,Sightseeing trip to Dublin,"Great hotel, good location around corner from o’connell Street. Family room was ideal for the 4 of us (14 and 11 year olds) breakfast fabulous. Staff lovely, breakfast service very efficient at ensuring tables cleared and things replenished and check in/out friendly and quick. Car park Q park around the corner easy enough to get to and hotel validate you ticket so 24 hours £10. ",5,2018,04,05
231,Excellent Hotel,Great central location to enjoy the sites and shops of Dublin. Great variety available for breakfast.  Staff are very welcoming and friendly especially the duty manager (Colm) who was very helpful on our arrival and throughout our stay. Rooms were nice sizes and beds were comfy. Would highly recommend to everybody. ,5,2018,04,04
231,Easter @Jurys Inn,The hotel was nice and staff was so friendly. The location was excellent and I really liked the small gym. Some noice of other guests was disturbing when trying to sleep.. A very good basic hotel I would say :),4,2018,04,04
231,Reasonable Corporate City Centre Hotel - warm and welcoming staff,Comfortable corporate hotel in good city centre location. Good sized functional rooms.  Interior design uninspiring. Wall in bedroom scuffed and needing roc (attention to detail).  Staff very welcoming and helpful.  Breakfast offered a good fresh range.,4,2018,04,03
231,Great hotel.,I would highly recommend this hotel.  Excellent city centre location. 15 mins walk from rail station.  Spotlessly clean very friendly helpful staff. Very tasty breakfast. Comfortable beds. Bathroom had bath not just shower. Great nights sleep very quiet for such a central location.,5,2018,04,03
231,Great hotel,Stayed in this hotel for one night because we were going to a concert ..staff were very friendly and helpful ...the hotel was lovely and central to everything....beds are very comfortable and nice size rooms ,5,2018,04,03
231,Worth staying!,"A very good option to stay at a hotel in the centre of Dublin, very near the check point for the most popular excursions as well as the famous Spire. Very friendly staff, pleasant atmosphere, excellent breakfast and spacious rooms.",4,2018,04,01
231,Excellent location,The hotel is in a great location right in the city centre. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The staff were very friendly and willing to help in any way they could! Would definitely stay again,5,2018,04,01
231,Great hotel in central location,"Had a pleasant stay - nice room & great breakfast. Helpful staff, especially at breakfast. Plus central location, just to North of the river, with everything within walking distance. I would certainly recommend this hotel",4,2018,03,31
231,"Good, no-frills hotel; cigarette smell in the lobby and hallways","This hotel is in central Dublin and was a solid hotel.  We upgraded to an ""executive"" room, that wasn't really that executive, but I think it gave us a little more room.  The hotel lobby has sliding doors that open to a busy street, and people smoke right next to the doors and the smell of cigarettes permeates the lobby, which is a poor reflection on the hotel.  We noticed cigarette smell in the 4th floor hallway too--I'm not sure if it came in from the elevators in the cigarette-smelly lobby or whether someone was smoking on the 4th floor.  But the cigarette smell is a big turn off, especially for American visitors who won't be accustomed to that.",3,2018,03,31
231,Weekend break,"Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street was a great location for us as it wasn’t too into the main town but also walking distance, we where looked after from the moment we checked in to checking out, staff where very helpful and provided us with good recommendations of places to visit during the day and night. ",4,2018,03,31
231,Green Valley High School Band ,"Jury's Inn handled our group of 66, mostly high school students, without a problem. Check in was ready and waiting for us and the hotel breakfast was delicious and Irish!
This hotel sits in the heart of Dublin close to major attractions. Steady stream of taxis and busses right out front and convenience store across the street for essentials. 
Wi-fi is fast- click on Netflix and there is no lag time. Three main lobby elevators and multiple stairwells handled our group well. Staff was patient and friendly  with our noisy bunch. 
If we ever return to Dublin, we will hope for room at Jury's Inn.",5,2018,03,31
231,Surprisingly good,"Was very happy with our stay, room was a bit on small side for family but friendly staff, location, cleanliness and super breakfast made us happy we booked here, will definitely stay again, value for money!",5,2018,03,29
231,City break ,"Stayed here for two nights, location is very good, we stayed in a executive room which was clean and spacious, staff were very friendly and helpful especially the young barman, we also had breakfast which I can only say was excellent with a good choice ",5,2018,03,28
231,Good Central Hotel ,Stayed for one night. Rooms were clean and tidy with enough room. Staff pleasant and helpful. Good buffet breakfast. Close to major attractions. Would recommend to travellers wanting a good hotel in Dublin.,4,2018,03,28
231,Good hotel in good location,"Very good location. Lots of supermarkets around. A pedestrian shopping street is 5 min walk away, so are two large department stores and a cinema. The town  centre is around 10-15 min away. 
The hotel was clean and the beds were comfy. However, the bathroom was not very well ventilated and only had a fixed shower head - inconvenient if you want to have a quick shower without washing your hair. 
I liked the cosy and nicely decorated bar on 2nd floor. We had a couple of drinks there. 
The breakfast was okay. Nothing special but the usuals (cereal, eggs, cheese etc) were there. 
There was a room mix up when we arrived. We ordered one double bed and one single bed but got two single beds. The staff handled it well and we got moved the next day. As an apology they paid for our taxi to the airport when we were leaving which was sweet.
",4,2018,03,27
231,Great hotel for the price,"We stayed here for a recent city break. We upgraded to an executive room, which had a large, comfortable bed and was extremely quiet. The staff were all excellent, very friendly and helpful and had good local knowledge. Nothing was too much trouble, we were very well looked after. It's a ten minute walk to all the main attractions but is far away enough from the centre that it's never too noisy. We'd happily recommend it.",5,2018,03,27
231,Perfect,"We recently stayed here celebrating my birthday, as usual we were very happy with our stay at Jurys. From it's central location, to friendly helpful staff, to the perfect room everything here is perfect. This was our fifth visit here and will be back again. We tried other hotels nearby and there is no comparison to this hotel in the same area. ",5,2018,03,26
231,St. Patrick's weekend,very good everything good location nothing much else to say hotel could have the same rate every night it is not like airfares up and down by the day. security was very good and staff was friendly and knowledgable,5,2018,03,26
231,Recommended,"Hotel is in a good location, the staff are really helpful and attentive, good quality breakfast with plenty of choice. Security and safety are to a high standard and overall this hotel stay was excellent.",4,2018,03,26
231,Great Location,"The hotel is in a great location, just off O'Connell street and about a 15 minute walk down to the Temple Bar area. We had an early flight so wasn't expecting to be able to check in when we arrived about 9am but our room was ready which was great!
The room was a good size and it was very clean. I think it would be good to have a few more plug sockets as it was a twin room with only one plug socket near the bed. You have to use your room keys to use the lift, which I understand why you have to order the lift but having to use it in the lift also was an annoyance as it didn't always work! 
Breakfast was great, we didn't pay for this when we booked but we were able to pay on the day and for 11 euros you get lots of options as it is a buffet and it was all good quality. 
Overall a great stay and would recommend to others.",4,2018,03,26
231,Excellent,"I was on a short stay with my sister , I found the staff very helpful and friendly in all areas of the hotel, it was great to have the facility to leave our luggage in the holding room on the day of our departure un till our time to leave Dublin that evening. ",5,2018,03,26
231,Amazing hotel,We stayed here from the Friday to the Sunday as it was our engagement anniversary. The hotel knew this and offered us free prosseco  which was lovely. Within walking distance of the Jervis shopping centre and about 15 minutes to Temple Bar (5 mins in a taxi-€11). There is a Tesco opposite for any necessities you need. Bed was super comfy and room was just enough for the two of us. Thank you Jury's inn  ,5,2018,03,26
231,St Patrick’s weekend,Lovely weekend over st Patrick’s weekend! Perfect location as just off O’Connell street which meant very close to all amenities. Would highly recommend and would definitely return! All staff were very friendly and helpful! ,5,2018,03,25
231,Great Hotel,This is the perfect place to stay while on Dublin. It is in the centre of the city and we easily walked all over Dublin. It is also close to all the pickup spots for tours as well as lots of attractions. Great people work there and are very friendly and helpful. St. Patrick's Day in Dublin💚💚,5,2018,03,24
231,Great Location ,"We stayed for 3 nights and found the location to be fantastic. It is near great pubs, theaters and hop-on-hop-off bus line and walking distance to shopping centers and some other unique attractions. Rooms, service and breakfast are not the greatest but nothing wrong and did the job for a city hotel. ",4,2018,03,23
231,perfect,I love above all the breakfast and its healty selection of food. the location is perfect because you can reach everiything on foot and near by there are lots of restaurants and pubs. I had an amazing stay here,5,2018,03,23
231,Great stay for St. Patricks Day,"We had a great stay at Jurys Inn Parnell street.  Location was an easy walk to the Liffey and other tourist locations.  Also convenient to tour bus pick up locations and bus/tram stops.  Staff was very good.  Breakfast was also good and plentiful.  Hotel was secure, but use caution in walking back at night.  As in any city there are those that are looking to rob tourists unfamiliar with the area.  We heard about a robbery and witnessed one on our walk back at night.  ",5,2018,03,22
231,"Good hotel, great staff","hotel staff were very nice.  There is a lot of street noise and within the hotel noise.  Staff could have responded to guests more quickly when the fire alarm went off at 3:00 a.m.  A lot of people were scared, but finally told that it was a false alarm.  Overall, it was a fine hotel and I would stay again.",4,2018,03,20
231,Good hotel in Dublin city,"great location, lovely breakfast, good sleep, friendly staff who were v accommodating especially so since they were under a lot of pressure given that it was after st. Patrick’s day and the hotel was very busy.",5,2018,03,20
231,The hotel to stay at if you intend on getting not a drop of sleep,"Fire alarm went off at 3am - while I had a one night stay, someone in the same hallway as myself informed me she had been staying there all week and this was the 3rd alarm during her stay. Loud large group began partying in the room next to mine at 4am. I put in a noise complaint at 4:30am but security never came and loud party continued until just before 6am. Would not recommend this hotel and am highly disappointed. ",2,2018,03,20
231,Great Hotel,Stayed here for St. Patrick’s Day and it was a very nice place. I would definitely stay here again. Service was great and the location was very convenient to everything. Nice hotel but was a little expensive because of the holiday. ,5,2018,03,19
231,Exactly what we needed,"Stayed for 2 nights whilst over for the 6 nations. Checked in quite late but night staff were helpful and welcoming, even upgrading us to a better room. 
The room was clean, spacious and the bed was super comfy, good shower too. Breakfast was busy but well stocked.
Overall a very pleasant stay - a bit pricey but to be expected over the rugby weekends!",4,2018,03,19
231,It exceded my expectations,The staff were helpful and friendly.  I asked for a quiet room and that is what I got for a great nights sleep in a very comfortable room.  It was great value for money - I will return on my next trip. Looking forward to it. ,5,2018,03,15
231,Great location with Good Rooms and Quality of Food,"The location is perfect, very close to many different shopping malls / shopping street as well as just a short 10 min walk to many pubs and bars. The rooms are relatively clean and the bathrooms big enough. Most of the staff are very helpful and friendly and their great breakfast ist huge bonus. We felt very safe in the Jurys Inn and we will probably return when on our future visit to Dublin. ",3,2018,03,15
231,Love love love! ,I have stayed in this hotel on several occasions on my trips to Dublin and it never fails to deliver! Staff are fantastic and are more than willing to help. Rooms are very comfortable and are a good size. Hotel is warm and inviting. If I stay anywhere in Europe I always try to find a jury’s inn because you get what you pay for and more! I can’t comment on the food as I am coeliac and prefer to stick to what I know is safe. There is a Tesco across the road if you need any items and you minutes away from O’Connell street! Great location. I cannot praise this place enough!!!!!,5,2018,03,14
231,I love Jurys inn,"I ejoyed my stay here.  Very central location, lovely food, lovely people.  Yes I wiuld stay here again and i wold recommend it to other people.  Very handy for me because i was going to Rickie Lee Jones at Vicar st just down the road.",5,2018,03,14
231,Poor Example of a Jurys Inn,I would think twice about booking this hotel - Positive - location Negative - everything else - Expensive and very tired and run down and to top it all the staff need to smile - I appreciate it was a busy weekend but perhaps more staff would have made it easier ,2,2018,03,14
231,Snowed in for two days at Jury's,"We were snowed in for two days in Dublin, with inappropriate clothing having just flown in from Australia, so we had all meals in the hotel and did not venture out. Under these circumstances the identical, rather short, bar and restaurant menus were rather limited. The buffet breakfast was varied but the cooked food was rather cold and the very watery orange juice was terrible The standard double room was on the small side but had all the amenities for a comfortable and warm stay. The ensuite bathroom smelled badly of drains, but the shower was good.  The free WiFi was nice to have but very slow. The best thing about this hotel was the friendly and helpful staff who created a very cheerful atmosphere.",3,2018,03,13
231,"Jurys Inn, Parnell Street","Staff were all very pleasant and helpful, from the time of check-in to the time of departure.  Room was comfortable and quiet. Breakfast was generous and suited to a wide range of tastes/ dietary requirements.",5,2018,03,13
231,Jury's Inn excellent,"We stayed her from Friday to Monday as we were down in Dublin for the C2C concerts in the 3 Arena.  We were pleasantly surprised by the location of the hotel as it was so convenient to shops, restaurants etc. The staff were absolutely lovely and very helpful - even every cleaner we met on the corridors said good morning to us or good evening.  The breakfasts were delicious with a great selection which would suit anyone - the rooms were spacious and clean and we would have no hesitation in staying here again.",5,2018,03,13
231,Good hotel ,"Hotel is very central. Rooms and hotel was very clean, staff were friendly. There is lifts to all floors, meals are on 2nd floor, entrance area quit busy. We could never here any noise. Good.experience.",5,2018,03,12
231,Really good service,"there's nothing really special about this Jurys Inn, its clean, everything works, food was fine (I only had breakfast) rooms were comfortable, and everything looked modern and fairly well looked after.  Service was very good, reception staff very friendly, helpful, organised.  Hotel is on a busy street in the centre of Dublin so it can be noisy outside but minor issue really.  Overall, good hotel, good location (I was working nearby - so didn't join in the partying!)   Would stay again.",4,2018,03,11
231,Most enjoyable stay,"Myself and my husband booked a one night midweek stay and from the time of booking the room and checking out, the staff and Manager (Colm) were so accommodating and helpful. The superior room was very comfortable. Breakfast was exactly what you would want. Will definitely return ",5,2018,03,09
231,Very good stay,"Stayed overnight for business trip to Dublin - very good value - comfortable stay, room was quiet compared to usual corridor noise from this type of hotel. All staff very professional and attentive. Breakfast offering was excellent with very broad range and all good quality, I was very impressed with it. Only suggestion for improvement would be to offer bottles of water in the rooms, rather than water/ice machine on each floor - that only works if you know in advance and have brought a water bottle with you!
If I return to Dublin I see no reason to stay anywhere else",5,2018,03,08
231,Not good,"We stayed at this hotel recently for one night as we had an early flight from Dublin airport the following morning. Firstly, I have to say that the customer service was very good. The lady at reception who checked us in was very helpful & pleasant. She even provided us with a free drink coupon as it was my boyfriend’s birthday.

I found the price of the room to be very expensive. We stayed in an ‘executive’ suite & there was nothing very executive about it... It was a standard, average hotel room with maybe a bigger bed than normal.

The bed: Never have I had such a terrible nights sleep. The pillows were like bricks. I tossed & turned all night long & ended up having to wrap the chair-cushion in a pillowcase and use that instead. For an executive room it was horribly uncomfortable, in my opinion.

Next, the meal: We ate at the restaurant that evening. Firstly, we stood around waiting for about 5 minutes to be seated as there was no one around. We had to go to the bar area just to get the staff’s attention. The waitress who finally took our order was also very pleasant. Unfortunately that’s the only positive note I had about the meal.

I’m non-confrontational... if something is wrong with my order I will normally just make do & not even mention it because I don’t want to make a fuss. The meal I had at this hotel was so BAD that I had to voice my displeasure to the waitress when she came to check on us. The burger I ordered was pink inside & had blood within the meat patty. The cous-cous was horrible. A reheated, congealed slab of mush that tasted of nothing. The ‘chilli con carne’ was not chilli con carne at all, but random chunks of inedible meat in a watery sauce.

Anyway, the waitress was very apologetic and offered to replace my meal with anything from the menu and gave me a free drink, which I appreciated but by that time my appetite had disappeared & I just wanted to go back to our room.

Finally, when checking in the receptionist had taken our parking ticket from the Marlborough St. Q-park multi-storey to validate it in order to give us the guest discounted €10 for overnight parking. When we got to the car park early the next morning and went to pay, we found the discount hadn’t been processed at all, so we had to pay €22 in total for parking.

A very disappointing experience. We’ll definitely stay elsewhere when we next visit Dublin.",2,2018,03,08
231,Great location & great price,"Lovely hotel and an excellent location. Only 5 mins walk to main shopping street of Dublin, its literally around the corner. Great place to say if you want to be central to everything and buses located 5 min walk to go to anywhere else in the city eg. the zoo. Only downfall no parking at the hotel, then again it is city centre. However they do a great deal with the local Q park car park 5 mins walk from the hotel €10 per night. Restaurant and shops right across the road. No noise pollution even tho you are located in the heart of Dublin city. ",5,2018,03,07
231,One night stay ,"Everything was fairly standard here nothing over average. Nice hotel, room, bar. Little overpriced. Location is good if your from Dublin. I wouldn’t recommend here to tourists as it can be a little daunting if your not local. Food in restaurant took forever to come out almost an hour and it was not busy. Fine for one night stay ",3,2018,03,07
231,Another Rugby weekend,Another great stay in Jurys. Great location just off to the right at the top of O'Connell Street easy access to all areas of the city and ferry port. Taxi to ferry port 14 euros. Great rooms and bar and again very good buffet breakfast can pay on the day 11euros well worth it. Will stay here again highly recommended.,5,2018,03,07
231,Poor Customer Service but Nice hotel,"Location: Perfect walking distance to O Connell Street, Temple Bar & a quick taxi ride to the Guinness store house for the tour.

Check-In: Room wasn't ready when arrived at 2-3PM. Been a Tier 2 customers of Jurys Rewards. Slow check-in and staff & Duty Manager weren't very helpful.

Bar / Restaurant: Very clean and comfortable - Little busy due to weather we experience during our 5 day stay. The Bar & Restaurant staff were excellent particularly Louise she was just outstanding and very outgoing. 

Rooms: Stayed in Executive Room and was very tide and spacious with a safe and Big TV and comfortable bed and bathroom was very clean.

Staff: Majority had been fine but had a isolated incident the same duty manager that was involved with check-in. during my stay, she questioned my friend who was also staying at the hotel.
(My friend was waiting in lobby approx 5min while I was getting ready. We had arranged to meet in lobby, when I arrived the female duty manager approached us and was very aggressive by promptly asking his name / room number after he showed her his keycard to room she approached a staff member at check-in area and asked to look him up to ensure he was staying in room without actually advising us why she was questioning him. So i asked as he is a quiet guy and the answer she gave was not a genuine reason.
Therefore this experience put a negative experience on our trip as we felt like we had been watched for the remainder of our stay.

Would I recommend Jurys Inn Still after my experience? Yes but I suggest alternative Site in Dublin.",3,2018,03,06
231,Good centrally located hotel,This is my second time staying at this Jurys when in Dublin. It is centrally located near many things and very convenient. The beds were very soft. Will stay again if I need to be near the city center. ,4,2018,03,05
231,Fab,"Perfect positioned hotel to explore Dublin, I have stayed the other side of the river before and never knew this hidden gem was there, great location to shops bars and eating places. Lovely hotel no disruption or noise, we recieved chocolates and a birthday card with complimentary prosecco at the bar!. Definately recommend and will return..",5,2018,03,05
231,Port in a storm,"Stuck in Dublin due to weather.   Good clean, friendly, convenient.   Did a wonderful job when food deliveries disrupted.   Please put warning about scalding hot water.   Also need to put soap/gel whereit can be reached when sitting in bath.   Definitely would stay again and recommend even though a bit pricey.  Thank you.",5,2018,03,05
231,Early check in ,"We arrived at 9am and check in wasn’t until 2pm but they got us a room straight away! Excellent customer service and spotless hotel! Very pleased, we were worried that we would be wandering the streets with our luggage until we could check in so it made our day! ",5,2018,03,04
231,I just did not like it,"Its a very busy hotel at a very god location but thats about it. The service level is not good, actually they made us feel very bad one night while we were getting into the lift. We had the keys but they stopped us at gate and started interrogating and checked their list. It was off the limit for us. ",2,2018,03,04
231,Ms Robyn Jennings,"Very convenient location for the old post office and shops. Also good for the writers museums. A good Tesco opposite. Not as plush downstairs as the Christchurch one over the river but a good standard. The bar area is really welcoming. The breakfast is buffet style but superb. Cooked options were varied and choice of fruit, breads and pastries was excellent. The room itself was really comfy with pristine white linen and soft pillows.",4,2018,03,03
231,Overpriced and unethical?,"I stayed in a disabled room with Jurys Inn for one night. It was large and comfortable 
I was able to check in early which was great. The food was hot and delicious, and the breakfast, although looking overall a bit sad, was good enough for €10. 
My flight was delayed a further two nights, however, when I called to enquire about extending my stay, this was going to be charged at an additional €200 per night. 
I understand that it is a weekend rate in a capital city, however we are talking about a Jury’s Inn. Not a 5* hotel. I don’t know who drove this pricing strategy, but I believe this to be extremely unethical when facing thousands of stranded passengers, not all of whom are able to claim back the expense on the airline/work. 
The staff were very pleasant and courteous, but this was atrocious value for money. ",2,2018,03,02
231,"Fab hotel, great location","This hotel was absolutely fab - everything we needed in a long weekend break. It's in a great location to the centre of Dublin (close enough but far enough out that quiet), and there is a Tesco just over the road for some supplies. Check-in was quick and easy, room was clean and spacious with all the amenities needed. Breakfast at the hotel was 10 Euros if pre-booked (11 Euros in the morning), and had all the usual hot food and pastries (pancakes/waffles were 5 Euros extra). We dined in the restaurant one night too and the pizza was the best pizza I think I've ever eaten!

The only minor issue I had with the hotel was that we were really cold in our room even with the heating/air con at 25C (we think there was a draft coming in from the window). Even with this, we weren't put off by the hotel and absolutely loved it! Can't recommend highly enough!",5,2018,03,01
231,Another great city break,"Hotel is a great base for a city break in Dublin, really easy access to anywhere you want to go.
Staff are always very friendly and the rooms are always kept spotless.
This was the third time we have stayed here when visiting Dublin and will certainly be back again.",5,2018,02,28
231,Great hotel,"Stayed for two nights, just perfect, very well located, we walked everywhere, apart from catching a tram to the Guinness factory. But excellently located, lots of places around, a short distance from Grafton street and all other main streets. Lovely staff, very helpful, highly recommend and will be staying again.",4,2018,02,28
231,Best hotel in Dublin.,"My mum and I are just home from a two night stay, I am a wheelchair user, on arrival we were give 324 which was fabulous! The room was very spacious, clean, cosy & bright and most of all fully accessible. Walk in shower with fold down seat, toilet bars and 2 very comfortable beds. Our room had 3 large windows overlooking Parnell Street. Free WiFi. Ice machine in 3rd floor corridor.  Bar area is very cosy and great Guinness. We have stayed in many hotels in Dublin City centre and this hotel is by far the best. Highly recommend and we look forward to booking our next trip soon.",5,2018,02,27
231,Great customer service,"I was impressed with the clarity and customer care offered to me here.  There were no questions left for me to answer.  Inside the entrance there was the security man who had a kindly word which makes all the difference.  My room was fine; spotlessly clean; comfortable; the pillows were exceptionally comfortable; the duvet was super warm on a super cold night.  I did ask for a quiet room which was referred by staff upon my check in and that was so until I heard late night groans from the adjacent room which was not helpful.

 Outside the lifts are an ice maker; equally there is a lovely bowl of fruit to dip into and in the early morning newspapers with the hotel's compliments.  This is a busy city centre hotel which is it's main selling point as you are so near all venues in the centre of Dublin.  The staff members were efficient and held the gift of courtesy in a gracious manner.",4,2018,02,27
231,Nice hotel ,Nice hotel close to all the sights. Avoid  a room at the rear of hotel can be noisy with the kitchen and loading docks. Walls not 100% soundproof. Only other issue was the hot water was not very hot no matter how high you turned it up. Has a nice bar which serves drinks and food. Had a decent breakfast buffet. ,4,2018,02,25
231,Paper thin walls!,"Paper. Thin. Walls. This was a real problem that took a lot away from our stay. Also, the temperature control was tricky, too hot, too cold... great location, friendly staff, but I didn't love it. I would rate the stay as fair because of the level of comfort. Also, no hair dryer, so I think you have to bring your own... ",3,2018,02,25
231,Very Nice Experience,"Stayed here for 2 nights on a B&B basis. We were checked in by very pleasant and helpful staff at reception. Room on 5th floor was clean, comfortable and nice and quiet. No safety deposit box in room but I believe they are available at reception. Tea & coffee making facility in room. The breakfast each morning had very good choice and was good quality. Excellent coffee. I stayed here a number of years ago and the rooms and breakfast have improved a lot. The premises is very centrally located and has a nice bar on the second floor. Will certainly stay here again.",4,2018,02,24
231,"Late night bar, nearly soundproof walls, comfortable","After doing a bunch of research on various hotels in Dublin, I am happy with this choice. I really enjoyed the spacious room, the nearly soundproof walls, the nice staff and the late night bar on level two. They even have 24 hour room service (the menu becomes more limited after about 9pm, but nonetheless, it is available) and there is a nominal surcharge of about 5 euros per order. If you have the Leap Card and take the express bus to and from the airport, the stop is about a 5-7 minute walk away.",5,2018,02,23
231,Good value and central location.,"Within 5 to 10 minutes walking distance to shopping streets, pubs/restaurants and public transport. Friendly and professional staff. Clean rooms and simple, but good breakfast. Room service available all night. I am not giving this hotel 5 stars because the bathroom was not well cleaned and the shower was not well-functioning. Other than that, the hotel was a very good value for a good price.",4,2018,02,23
231,Great location ,"The hotel is situated in the middle of everything. Short 15 minute walk to Temple bar, just off one of the main high streets for shopping and has a lot of shops on the street itself. Really comfy beds and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. ",4,2018,02,22
231,Great hotel,"Great location for a few days away. The hotel was very clean and very safe - key card needed to even get in the lift from reception. Clean, tidy and the staff were more than helpful. Would definitely recommend! ",5,2018,02,21
231,Great Stay,"Large clean room. Good location. 2 minutes from shops, 10 minutes walk from temple bar. Breakfast great, lots of choice.
Will come back next time in Dublin. 
Tip if looking for a great place to eat whilst in Dublin visit the Old Mill restaurant . Food was amazing.",5,2018,02,21
231,Quick stop over ,I stayed here the night before I flew out for my holiday. Check in was delayed as rooms were not ready. However Petra really looked after me upgrading my room and giving me a drink voucher for the bar to apologise. Top notch customer service. My room was cosy and had a great view of Dublin's roof tops. Shower was a little small but fine. I always consider this place a good option when planning a trip to the capital. It's location is perfect for exploring! ,4,2018,02,21
231,Dublin break,Just returned from an overnight trip to Dublin. This hotel is well located to explore the city and surrounding area. The staff were friendly and helpful. Self service breakfast was excellent plenty of variety and good quality. We found the room warm and comfortable but looking quite tired with stains on the carpet .Although there were three of us in the room we were only provided with two coffee mugs and two glasses.,4,2018,02,20
231,Fantastic hotel ,"I would highly recommend this hotel, it’s central to everything, your able to walk to everywhere, O’Connell street is just around the corner.

The rooms were very clean, bathroom was lovely, staff were all very friendly, breakfast was a very reasonable priced

Would definitely stay at this hotel again ",5,2018,02,20
231,50th Birthday weekend ,"Just returned from another fabulous weekend away with girl friends for a friends 50th birthday. Was 11 in total and they accommodated us with all the rooms together...always good. 

On arrival check in was pretty slow but wasn’t too much of a problem as we weren’t in any hurry. We were located on the 5th floor which wasn’t the best as the lifts were temperamental. 

Hotel was very comfortable and very clean. And good location to shops and bars. 
Breakfast was good with a large selection of cooked and continental choices to suit everyone. 

Would definitely recommend this hotel and return. ",5,2018,02,19
231,"Restful, quiet, well located hotel","We visited Dublin for the weekend.  Found this hotel to be within walking distance to many of the city's historic sites, attractions and nightlife.  The property is well maintained, quiet and secure enabling us to have a restful stay.  We would stay here again.",4,2018,02,18
231,Great location ,"Beautiful part of the city, opposite a church and in a nice quiet location but only a 10 minute walk to the hustle and bustle of temple bar. 

Great hotel with fun and friendly staff 

Room was clean and comfortable 
",4,2018,02,18
231,Weekend visit ,Spent a 2 night stay at Jury's Inn.  Early check-in was a bonus. Easy access from bus stop on O Connell Street.  Room.  Clean and quiet. The  breakfast selection was excellent.  Couldn't fault anything about the stay. ,4,2018,02,17
231,Clean & enjoyable,"Lovely foyer, great location. Very clean and comfortable bed. Friendly and helpful reception staff. Couldn’t ask for more. Highly recommended! Walking distance from the main precinct of Dublin, many eateries to choose from nearby.",5,2018,02,17
231,Birthday bash,"A fabulous stay was had for 5 adults and 6 kids. Breakfast was fantastic and rooms perfectly clean and comfortable. 
Parking is close and at a reliable rate if ticket is validated. We’ll be back soon hopefully. ",5,2018,02,16
231,Works Christmas night out,"We travelled to Dublin from Scotland for our Christmas works weekend. The staff were friendly, the hotel was lovely, food was amazing. Ideal location and overall set us up for a good weekend. My family are visiting Dublin in March and are also staying here due to our recommendation. Thank you ",5,2018,02,16
231,Quality Hotel with excellent staff,We stayed here for 2 nights B&B. From arrival at reception to departure the service from the staff was first class. The breakfasts were to a very high standard. We had dinner there on the 2nd night. A nice and quiet restaurant. The 2 staff that waited on our table couldn't do enough for us. The central location to the shopping area of Henry street and easy walking distance to most of Dublin's tour sites like Dublin Castle was a bonus.,5,2018,02,15
231,Brilliant for a short sight-seeing break,"I stayed with my husband and daughter in a family room.  There was a double and full-sized single bed, which my daughter was delighted with, as quite often she has to make do with a camp bed squeezed in.  There was a t.v., hairdryer, plenty of coat hangers in the wardrobe, pleasant soap and shower-gel in the bathroom (and shampoo but I didn't use it so can't comment), the beds were warm and comfy and there were tea/coffee facilities.  The breakfast was fantastic, loads of choice and good quality (kids under 12 eat free).  There is a small gym although we didn't use it.  The location is good, a bit of a walk to some of the more central sites, although this didn't bother us.  Parking is not available at the hotel but you can park in a nearby public carpark (Clery's) for 10 euro a day when your parking ticket is validated in the hotel. 
 There is a Tesco directly opposite and a Lidl around the corner as well as the market stalls on Moore street.  Very reasonably priced at the beginning of the week but I expect it's more expensive at the weekend.  I would definitely stay again.",5,2018,02,14
231,My first Jury's inn...,"I'm not overly brand loyal to Jury's Inn. However over the years i have stayed in their hotels in Belfast, Brighton and Bristol. This was my first stay in a Jury's Inn where the city name did not begin with a B. But reassuringly the same standards seam to apply when the city name begins with a D. The initial impression is of a small lobby but as you go up you find there is plenty of space in the hotel. Breakfast and the bars are all on the 2nd floor, my room was close by on the second floor. it was clean and functional and had everything you would need. There were few nice touches but for a functional overnight in central Dublin this is a good option.",4,2018,02,14
231,No complaints here! ,"Excellent location, two minutes walk from the bus stop on O’connell Street and less than 10 minutes walk to Temple Bar.
We arrived at this hotel at 9:20am and went to ask if we could leave our case with them until check in time. The receptionist said the room was ready and so checked us in straight away! Fantastic! Room was clean and tidy, very comfy bed and we had a couple of great nights sleep here. Breakfast was buffet style with an excellent amount of choice, from fruit, yoghurt and cereal to full Irish to pastries. All the staff were extremely polite and helpful, especially the guy who worked the restaurant at night. He could not have been more helpful and polite, especially considering we rolled into the restaurant at 9:30pm and they stop serving food at 10. Food at this time of night was just as good as in the day and price wise on par with the general restaurants in Dublin. 
An excellent base to explore Dublin and all in an all round fab weekend break! We will definitely return to this hotel. ",5,2018,02,12
231,Good Hotel,"Stayed here on business.
Rooms were nice, very clean and the service was good. 
Staff are friendly and efficient and the breakfast was nice.
Only quibble would be the coffee from the machine at breakfast is not the best but just ask for a cappuccino and the waitress will make you one FOC. :-)
Overall hard to fault it for value. ",4,2018,02,12
231,"Superb location, good value for money- perfect for business travellers","I stayed at the Jury's Inn for four nights- the purpose of my trip was business. The hotel met all of my expectations. The room was clean, modernly furnished and equipped with all of the necessities. My only critique would be that it was small. Yet it was adequate as most of my time was not spent in my room during my stay anyway. The staff were very friendly and accommodating, and happily assisted me with a late check-out on the last day of my trip when I had to stay in Dublin for a few extra hours unexpectedly. Overall I had a good experience and would happily return again.",5,2018,02,12
231,Nice long weekend in February ,"We stayed here for a long weekend in February. It is perfectly situated in Dublin for easy access to all the tourist areas. 
Great bar and good food. The breakfast Is especially good value for money. 
One last thing, all the staff were incredibly pleasant and willing to help. 
Would happily stay here again. ",5,2018,02,12
231,Better off in a travelodge for the money paid,Requested a double room but was given a disabled room with a very strange smell then asked to change and was given a disabled room again. The shower has one temperature - boiling hot - and does not adjust. Was expecting a certain level of decor/comfort/service for the price paid but to be perfectly honest I would’ve had the same experience in a travelodge so wish I’d saved some money and stayed there. The in room heating is a mystery to work out and seem to do their own thing. The general location isn’t great either. ,2,2018,02,12
231,Weekend trip,"We visited this hotel around Christmas. Great location for temple bar (about 5-10 minute walk), hotel was lovely and clean, staff very helpful. Breakfast was lovely and had a lot of choice. Dublin itself is amazing! definitely worth the visit.",5,2018,02,11
231,Fantastic Stay Great Friendly Staff,Wonderful stay great staff and hotel couldn’t recommend enough we came for a mini moon and already looking to come back thank you Jurys Inn for making our first trip to Dublin one to remember we will be returning.,5,2018,02,10
231,Great Stay,"Very central location, room ready at 12 when we went to drop our bags..very pleasant and extremely helpful front desk staff..good sized double room with all the usual amenities. Great price for our one night stay, lovely gesture for a drink at the bar as was my sisters birthday. Lovely upstairs bar with again very pleasant staff. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again.",5,2018,02,10
231,"Friendly staff, great location, massive bed, late checkout, nice brekkie, BUT KEYCARD NEEDED EVERYWHERE","Staff are very friendly, It is in a great location, close to some nice Irish pubs(I recommend Murrays which is a 3min walk form the hotel and has live music and dancing in the eves), opposite  a big Tesco and close to a shopping area with KFC, McDonalds and Mr Doughnut!

The rooms are lovely, and the bed was a Kingsize(I think we had a deal for a premium room) We were also entitled to late checkout until 2pm.

Bus to the airport(700) is just around the corner too. Opposite Murrays pub

The breakfast was very nice, cooked breakfast, croissants, yogurts fresh fruit, anything you could want for.

There's also a tiny room with mirrors and 4 pieces of gym equipment they call a gym if you are interested in that.

The only thing I didn't like was that you needed your keycard for everything, to operate the lift and even to get into the toilets on the 2nd floor where breakfast was served. I wanted to go to the ladies while my partner was checking out the gym, before going to breakfast and I couldn't get in! I had to ask to be let into the toilets! I find that quite bizarre and over the top. I understand the security reason behind lift access...but toilets on the second floor by the breakfast hall!? Lol",4,2018,02,10
231,Service is weak and staff seems inexperienced,"Overall this hotel is expensive for the comfort and service offered. Other Jury's Inns are much better. Walls between rooms are paper-thin. Beds and pillows were too hard (personal taste). With a couple exceptions, the staff seemed inexperienced and a bit ""lost"" and unable to multi-task effectively, as if it were their first day on the job. Does this mean the hotel staff has high turnover? ",2,2018,02,09
231,Excellent value for money,"Stayed at The Jury's Inn late January with my partner and what a lovely hotel.  Close to all amenities.  Our room was a good size,  clean and the bed was lovely and comfortable.  The bar area was really nice and the drinks were actually cheaper than the bars outside.  We would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,02,09
231,Great location,"Central to Dublin Centre, lobby dated and not particularly welcoming, security very good, but breakfast disappointing with Luke warm presentation and very limited choice, pity as the Irish breakfast is famous throughout the world!",4,2018,02,08
231,"Great value, clean and comfortable","A very clean and comfortable option for a short stay in the city centre. Very helpful and friendly staff who treat guests with respect and consideration. My room was surprisingly spacious and was equipped with facilities that are not always provided as standard in this price category (ironing board and iron, etc.). Would definitely recommend this to others.",5,2018,02,08
231,Martin kelly,"Great place to stay,great staff,lovely breakfast and strongly recommend anyone to visit if in the capital.
Housekeeping staff were very helpful with spare towels as we didn't need room tidied on 2 night stay,all was positive.the bar is comfortable and staff very good service..",5,2018,02,07
231,Fab location. Super pleasant stay,"This hotel is such good value in comparison to many others in the area. Really was so happy with our stay.

Hotel amenities were spot on, Breakfast was such high standard and so close to everything you would need whilst on a short stay to Dublin. You migjt be on the North side of the river Liffy but bit of walking and you are in the thick of it all. 

As a couple celebrating our wedding anniversary we really had such a great weekend and I would recommend this hotel to all. The complimentary room upgrade and Prosecco on arrival was a wonderful touch.

We ate out every night so can't comment on the dinner but the bar area was buzzy and all staff are polite and helpful.   

You won't be disappointed staying here. Have a fun time, Dublin is just such a fantastic city to visit. ",5,2018,02,07
231,Dublin trip,Stayed in jury’s inn Parnell street. Asked for early check in which was done. Rooms where great value for a city. Staff very helpful. Great location. Beds comfy. Maybe better shower would be only slight criticism.overall very good experience ,5,2018,02,06
231,"Great hote, great staff, great location","A fabulous city break which was enhanced by staying at jury’s, 
Service really good, staff went over and above to attend to us and were so helpful in retrieving some lost property. 
Rooms spacious clean and modern, 
Breakfast was declicious. Loved the sausages,
Such a handy location for all the sights.
Thank you so much,",5,2018,02,05
231,Not as good as previous visits,"Having stayed at Jury's on many occasions, this time we had to book indirectly as the direct prices even to a Rewards Partner were far too expensive.  We were a little disappointed - the room could have been more comfortable but was very quiet.  However, the quality of breakfast was very average and the WIFI signal dropped out more than it was available.  With the prices continually on the increase I didn't feel this was a very good experience.",3,2018,02,05
231,Excelent,"Excelent hotel. 
With excelent location, services and good costs
Rooms and beds are so confortable and breakfast is very good
It is in good location with easy access to  public transportation or to walk around the city",5,2018,02,04
231,Lovely hotel ,"This hotel is lovely and clean, great staff and central location. The breakfast is buffet style but has a great selection of hot and cold food. Reception booked taxis for us and printed our boarding passes. Taxi from Dublin airport was 30 euro ",5,2018,02,04
231,Family birthday in dublin,Great hotel in brilliant location will stay again when next in dublin. Mr fox restaurant literally 2 min walk away. Hop on hop off bus stop just round the corner. Tesco opposite hotel. You can’t go wrong with this hotel 10 min walk to temple bar area. ,5,2018,02,04
231,Perfect City hotel,"It was all Great!!! The Room, The bed and a Perfect City Hotel !!!
The breakfast was also good english and international food
For a City Trip a very good Hotel. The Service was also very good an all very Friendly :-)",5,2018,02,04
231,Good hotel,Not a bad hotel. Comfy rooms although the pillows were too hard for me but all in nice. I was given an access room which es ok but it was a long way from the lift which defeats the object for the disabled guest. Food in restaurant was good and the artisan pizza is recommended ,4,2018,02,01
231,Enjoyed the stay,"I really liked staying here. It was a spacious room, large bathroom (with a tub/shower), and the bed was super comfortable. I didn't hear my neighbors, so either I was next to super courteous people, or the walls are just that effective. There's no on-site parking, but they partner with a parking garage a couple blocks away, so parking was only 10 euros a night. I ate in the restaurant one night, and the staff were friendly, and the pesto pasta was tasty. The hotel values safety and security— after a certain time at night, you have to be buzzed in by the front desk, and every time you want to ride the elevator, you have to swipe your room key. If all Jurys are like this, they've made me fan.",5,2018,02,01
231,Dublin present,"The hotel has no rooms on the first floor, they start on the second floor, reception was very helpfull and allowed us in our room an hour early as we had an early flight. The room was spacious and quiet as it was on the inside, tea and coffee facilities, flat screen tv, good size bathroom and all very clean.
One problem we found over night was the matress was sagging badly and when we took the duvet off you could actually see it went down in the middle!! Reception were great and offered us a room change immediately to a room on the front of the hotel with floor to ceiling windows and a small sitting area as well as the double bed, it was lovely.
Breakfast was selfservice and was excellent!!! Loads to choose from and really hot. 
Overall very good hotel, great customer service and would recommend.",4,2018,02,01
231,Make sure you get what you pay for,"Room given not the one booked.
Booked a family room given a 'small standard double'
Booked through Booking.com who have since given us a $25 refund but nothing offered by Hotel.
Reception staff were told at the time of Booking in but didn't want to be bothered.
Menu in Restaurant for dinner limited. Breakfast menu excellent.",2,2018,02,01
231,Great Hotel,Pleased to have stayed in this well located hotel in the centre of Dublin. Very clean and comfortable with helpful and attentive staff.  Would have no hesitation in staying there again or in recommending it to other people.,5,2018,01,31
231,Great value for money,"Don't hesitate to book this hotel - truly a great experience.
Service was friendly and personalized, room was spacious and had all necessary amenities, bed was soft and comfortable.
Breakfast had all we could ask for - maybe not so many things for the sweet-tooth ones but we enjoyed it.",5,2018,01,30
231,Lovely Place in a Good Location,Went here from Thursday to Saturday on a deal to celebrate a mate’s 60th Birthday. It is just off O’Connell Street and say a 15/20 minute walk to most furthest away areas. Hotel was spotless and the room very comfortable. We didn’t eat here as the was a better place across the road. We did have a drink in the bar and the prices were cheaper than the bars nearby. I would definitely stay here again.,5,2018,01,30
231,Amazing bed!,"I have never slept in such a comfy bed! On arrival staff are friendly and helpful, we were asked if we wanted to upgrade from standard to executive for €20 a night, only staying 2 nights so we did and glad we did, large king size bed with big fat pillows, we were asked if we wanted a view or quiet courtyard room, we chose courtyard, we slept like logs! Coffee machine in room as well as the usual kettle etc. Hairdryer and iron. And a lovely surprise of a much needed Diet Coke and kitkat in the fridge for the morning after! Definitely stay here again! Handy luggage store too 🙂",5,2018,01,30
231,"Lovely, clean and friendly hotel.","We came to Jurys Inn for my husbands 30th. I had a booking for 9 people plus a few others stayed in the hotel in our party but booked separately. Could not fault it, the hotel was very clean and tidy, all staff friendly and helpful. Would certainly return. 
Thank you for an amazing stay.",5,2018,01,30
231,Bustling part of town,"Superbly appointed and immaculately clean, well stocked lounge bar and top class restaurant. 

Tram line just outside but completely inaudible means easy access to the heart of this beautiful city at a great nightly rate. 

Plenty of places to eat and the excellent shopping mall make this a great location. ",5,2018,01,29
231,"Fantastic Hotel, Excellent Location","Our stay was perfect from start to finish. I asked for some balloons in the room as we were celebrating a birthday, and they left balloons, card, chocolates and a complimentary drink at the bar. Such a lovely gesture. The hotel is in a fantastic location if you want to be close to Temple Bar area and there is so many shops in close proximity. Tesco is across the street and a lovely chip shop which served the best fish & chips. The hotel was spotless, staff are so friendly and the food was amazing. We went for the kitchen combo and couldn’t fault it. The alcoholic drinks are actually cheaper than most pubs and the bar staff are fab. We will most certainly be back. Can’t wait to book again. Thank you for such an enjoyable stay. ",5,2018,01,28
231,Good base but hard base of bed,"We had a warm welcome and an upgrade. 
We had some lovely chocolates and supplies in the executive suite. 
We had a view of the courtyard which was quiet. 
The bed was hard and both of us had trouble sleeping. 
The shower was luke warm - its a mixer shower. 
Breakfast is eat as much as you like and average. 
Good service all round.",4,2018,01,28
231,Comfortable stay,"Very comfortable hotel within handy reach of most attractions and plenty of buses near by too.
Good and clean and the breakfast was lovely with a lot of choice. 
Some very good restaurants near by try The Church, highly recommended. ",5,2018,01,28
231,Great hotel and base ,"Great hotel nice and cheap really clean and tidy good bar, right on top on O’Connell street. Loads to do in the local area. The rooms were big enough and very clean, staff were friendly and did whatever they could to help us out. Will be using again. ",5,2018,01,27
231,One of the loveliest hotels we’ve stayed in ,We visited this hotel for a weekend getaway. From the moment we walked in the staff were lovely. With special mention to Petra who constantly looked after us and made sure she could help with any questions we asked. She also gave us some good recommendations. The hotel was lovely and the room accommodated for three people with no issues. We also had complimentary chocolates and prosecco which was a lovely a touch considering we were only their for two nights. If we were to visit the area again we would definitely stay here. The breakfast was also lovely and accommodating for all needs! ,5,2018,01,27
231,Behind closed doors...,"Lovely decor in the lobby, restaurant and bar area.  Check in staff and welcome arrival were very polite and helpful. Lift service works well and is very secure. Rooms are in some need up updating/modernising to be at the same standard as the lobby. When arriving you think the rooms are going to be quite plush, but they aren’t. They are evidently old and there have stains/marks on the walls and carpets and the bathroom has a very aged look. The colours are dull and the window we had looked out onto a roof. We were woken up early hours of the morning (3am) by a large group of girls (i’m Young myself but have respect when staying in a hotel) who were running up and down the corridor, playing their music, screaming and shouting. When I informed on check out the ladies response was, well we’ve not had any other complaints as though I was lying? The bar is lovely and relaxed and had been modernised nicely and we had a free glass of prosecco as it was my partners birthday. Some parts of this hotel are really right, others need some real work on. ",3,2018,01,27
231,Wonderful hotel,"Fantastic location.  Wonderful staff who are so kind and helpful.  Great, comfortable beds and quiet room. Nothing was too much trouble. Good selection of food at breakfast. Highly recommend this hotel to anybody travelling to Dublin! ",5,2018,01,26

Well Done to all the staff that we had serving us during our stay ,
Will definitely stay at this hotel again when in Dublin ",5,2018,01,25
231,Visit,Wonderful hotel in a great location. The location is central to all amenities - the shops only 3 minute walk from it.It is beside all public transport. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. Would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2018,01,25
231,Short city break,Very central hotel. I was disappointed that when i studied my on line booking information I realised that I could not cancel my booking without having to pay for the first night even though it was four days notice.,4,2018,01,25
231,Really nice Place to Stay,"Nice hotel, Clean, good staff, good options on the Restaurant and Bar, really close to the Dublin's action center.
I usually travel for business every week and the Jurys inn in Parnell Street is my option to stay in Dublin.",4,2018,01,25
231,Weekend away ,"We have stayed in this hotel before hence why we went back. Can't fault it , we had a problem with our room safe and so they immediately changed our room. We stayed in an executive room , beds are very comfortable and a few extra freebies thrown in which was nice. Breakfast was help yourself and was to a high standard. Would I stay here again? Yes I would it's in an ideal location, stones throw away from O Connoll Street, which is the heart of Dublin. ",5,2018,01,24
231,3 Night Dublin stay,"Our first visit to Dublin to celebrate a 50th and 21st Birthday.
The hotel was out first point of call and as first impressions go we were very pleased.
On arrival Mia (Reception) ) checked us in swiftly and our room was available several hours early which helped greatly as we had an early flight arrival.
All levels of service were good ,  food and drinks also.
Excellent location , will return again.",5,2018,01,24
231,Jurys Hotel,"I stayed in Rm 460, terrible noisy from machinery and items being dumped into large skips, from very early in the morning.shame as the hotel itself was perfect in every other way,
would definitely recommend,
",4,2018,01,24
231,Great hotel,"I can't recommend highly enough and would definitely stay again . Staff were helpful, knowledgeable . Rooms were very clean and comfortable.
I hadn't originally booked breakfast for our stay but glad I changed my mind on arrival as the breakfast was extensive, plenty of choice and filling - again, the staff in the restaurant were very helpful and friendly.",5,2018,01,23
231,Very friendly hotel,"The room was very clean, the bed and pillows very comphy. The hotel is right in middle of the city but you don’t hear the noice. I couldn’t praise all the staff highly enough as they were all friendly and helpful. There is also a bunch of supermarkets, places to eat and tons of shops down the road on the right hand side of the hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,01,23
231,Great location,"Great place to stay, comfortable and within walking distance of everything. Breakfast is excellent value and good quality. Rooms are very comfortable and clean, lifts to all floors and a friendly bar.",5,2018,01,22
231,Dublin Weekend,"Very nice hotel in a central location. Rooms had everything you needed for a weekend away and were very clean and well equipped. Breakfast was plentiful, good quality with plenty of choice. Overall I would book again.",5,2018,01,22
231,Convenient location,"Stayed here in a triple room just for the night and it was ok.  Don't know if I could have stayed here for longer as  we were on the ground floor facing the courtyard but it was still very noisy.  There was a constant knocking sound like a washing machine coming from outside.  The shops were around the corner and there was a supermarket across the road.  

Breakfast had a good choice for the buffet.  Staff friendly.",3,2018,01,22
231,Nice Room WITH Air Conditioning!,"We enjoyed a large and very clean room in a good location.  The air conditioning was a little noisy, but we were grateful for the AC.  Buffet breakfast was very good, but a little frantic as there was a crowd.  It was tough for the staff to keep everything replenished, but they tried hard to please.  Would stay here again when in Dublin.",4,2018,01,21
231,Lovely hotel and great value for money,"The hotel is located in the center of the city and in walking distance of the river and all the major sights. It is quiet at night and the rooms are fine. The bed was a little to soft. The breakfast is very good with lots to choose from. The only thing we would like to point out, is that it would be nice and seem more welcoming, if the staff at the reception looked up and greeted the guests when they arrived and left.",4,2018,01,21
231,Couldn't sleep,"At 3 AM and alarm was going off for around 20 minutes, I thought this was the fire alarm so got dressed and evacuated my room only to later learn that this was the lift alarm, somebody was stuck in the lift for an hour. I couldn't get back to sleep.",2,2018,01,21
231,So nice! ,"We really liked our stay at Jury’s Inn! Parking was less of an issue than i thought it would be. You have to park a 5 minutes walk away, but you get a discount which is nice! Our room was really great and the staff is so friendly! ",5,2018,01,21
231,Great location.,"This hotel is well placed for the many bars, restaurants and attractions Dublin has to offer. The hotel is clean and well looked after. The bar is a great way to relax and unwind but also you can work there too as the WiFi is good.
The room I had was clean and tidy. I would recommend this hotel and I shall stay again.",4,2018,01,21
231,Terrific hotel,"We enjoyed our stay in this hotel. It is perfectly located for a city break and staff are pleasant and helpful. It was very reasonably priced and great value for money. We had a very comfortable sleep and we're not at all disturbed by noises from the street, unlike many other hotels in the vacinity. ",5,2018,01,20
231,"Good location, nice rooms","Having stayed earlier in our trip on the south side of the city, we picked this place for its location on the north side. Nice and handy to the shops and close to the LUAS, we found it a great spot. Everyone was friendly, the rooms were lovely- the only negatives were having to pass through hoards of people standing outside at all hours of the day smoking, and the lack of space to be picked up/dropped off- when we were dropped off here a large group had parked their van completely blocking the small area set aside for this, which made it awkward finding a place to stop and get our luggage out safely.",4,2018,01,18
231,Super hotel,The hotel was very good value for money and in a great location. Close to the main shopping areas and tourist sites. It was clean and comfortable and the staff were all very friendly and professional.,5,2018,01,18
231,3 night stay ,"We arrived here at 8am after getting an early flight. The staff were very helpful & our room was ready to check in at 11am. The room was spotless & very nice. Lovely comfy big bed & fridge, safe & tea & coffee making facilities. Breakfast was nice, lots of choice. Not always that hot but understandable when they are catering for so many. The food in the restaurant was delicious also. The bar & restaurant staff were always very helpful. The only thing I think this hotel could do with is a smoking area inside the hotel grounds for residents only to save having to go all the way out to the front at night. A very pleasant stay and would stay again.",4,2018,01,17
231,Perfect,"Good hotel in the city center, nice staff, the receptionists were very helpful. they gave recommendation for dinner and for what to see in the city.
The breakfast had a lot of vegetarian options. 
The bed was comfy.
",5,2018,01,17
231,Great value,"Stayed here with a friend in the beginning of Jan 2018. This is a great location to explore the city. Shops and restaurants nearby.Took us about 25 mins walk to the Guinness factory - the other Jury Inn is closer if that's important. 

Room price was around 75 euro for the night, excluding breakfast which is 10 euro and worth it. We had a double bed and a single, which worked well for us. Room was at the 4th floor on the back. Lower rooms at the back might have some noise from garbage pick-up. 

Transfer to/from Dublin Airport was easy and cheap at 7 euro with the Airlink bus stopping on O'Donnell, just around the corner. 

All in all a nice stay and good value for money.",5,2018,01,17
231,Weekend Stay in Dublin,"Me and my partner have just returned from a weekend anyway in Dublin. After staying in Jurys Inn within England we decided to book in at Jury’s Inn Parnell Street. Firstly the location is excellent. The hotel is located just off O’Connell Street (Main High Street) roughly a 10/15 minutes walk to the Temple Bar area. There are a number of surrounding bars, shops and transport links available. This includes the AirCoach service we used to get to and from the airport. The many hop on/hop off busses and also tram and city bus links. The Hotel itself was excellent. All hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Any queries or questions we had, all staff were more than happy to help. The bar area was very nice and had a good selection of drinks available, as well as a good food menu. The rooms were also very spacious and clean. We were offered an executive suite however unless you wanted to upgrade the standard suite was more than good enough. Overall we had an excellent stay and couldn’t recommend enough. We will certainly be heading back in the future. Thank you Jurys Inn! ",5,2018,01,16
231,Great hotel,"We went with friends to see the best bits of Dublin and this hotel was in the perfect spot for all. Very clean, friendly and comfortable. The breakfast was excellent. The staff were all really friendly and helpful.",5,2018,01,16
231,2 day stay ,"The hotel and the room was lovely! The staff were helpful and polite, the room was clean, spacious and nice. We were able to leave luggage at no extra cost when we arrived before the room was ready and when we checked out but still had to wait for our flight. 
We also paid for late check out whilst we were there.
Unfortunately the only part that left the hotel Down was the restaurant, the food was nice, however the steak that was ordered was over cooked, and when we told the waiter about it, the reply we had was ‘well you went to the toilet when your food was ready, so it went on cooking under the hot plate!’ After working in customer service for most of my life I don’t really think it’s an acceptable answer, and nothing more was done about it!

But overall I’d recommend the hotel! ",4,2018,01,16
231,Great low-priced hotel in good location,"This hotel has low prices and a good location just around the corner from busy O’Connell street. The breakfast is cheap (for Dublin standards ) and very good. The coffee was not good. The rest of the food was good. The room was big and clean - they could have provided more towels though. The staff was friendly. Free complimentary instant coffee and tee in the room, no free water. In the hallsways, they provided free apples, which was nice. ",4,2018,01,16
231,Where to stay in Dublin,"The Jurys Inn Parnell St is a very nice, comfy, reasonably priced hotel to stay at.  Handy to Connolly St Station & a 5 min walk to the Connolly St bus stops for Airport transfers, easy walk to shops 2",5,2018,01,15
231,Fab hotel!,"Fantastic location second walk from bars restaurants and transport links. Toursist information to book trips round the corner. Easy to get to from the airport, just pay outside the arrivals terminal, air coach, €12 return and get off at O’Connell’s street, literally 1 minute walk from the coach stop. Friendly staff and superb clean hotel!! ",5,2018,01,15
231,A hotel in need of better management,"Our booking for this hotel was for a twin bedded room with non allergic bedding, having booked in, we were given a room on the 2nd floor, looking towards the market street. What did we get - a family room with feather duvets & pillows and one chair!

Our first job was to get the bedding changed; consequently the staff arrived with a miss match of bedding! In addition the single bed was not of the quality expected, we did get a second chair - as we were staying for 4 nights, however this arrangement made the bedroom ""tight"" to say the least!. It was whilst the bedding was being changed, we & the staff recognised that the heating was not working (the vent in any case was in the ceiling - not the best of places). So a well used electric oil filled heater was found. The heating issue was made good the following day.

Breakfast was taken on the second floor, only a small jug of milk was put on the table, all food & cutlery had to be fetched some distant, unless - you were lucky enough to get a table near the hot plates etc. We did manage to get a member of staff to bring us a large pot of tea - most useful.. Scrambled eggs for example,  was as in many hotels  pre- cooked in the kitchen - so we stuck to a continental breakfast - but choices were very limited. Yogurt was was in small jars - milk churn in shape - you could not get your spoon in - so most of it was wasted!, Fruit salad was in such small bits, it was tasteless - gave that a miss, other options included sliced cheese, porridge, bananas, melon, sliced ham & bread. Generally disappointing.. 

Staff pleasant - no problem until the last day. when we realised that our Air Lingus tickets did not give us the information ref. which terminal - so we asked a reception member of staff if they could please check which terminal we had to go to. Answer was Terminal 1 - having arrived at the Terminal by the very good air port bus service, we found ourselves in the wrong terminal & had to walk back to Terminal Two! What more can we say!",2,2018,01,15
231,One night stay,"My partner and myself stayed overnight early November 2017. 
We were greeted warmly by a lovely receptionist named Petra that informed us our room was not ready (we were looking for a very early check in so we expected it) and offered to take our luggage in so we could explore Dublin without having to carry it around. We were delighted with the offer and took off.
The hotel location is really ideal as it is right in the city centre, so we went out for lunch  and snooped around a few shops, our room was ready when we returned - Petra actually recognised us despite a big group checking in before we returned, working in the industry I know it isn't always easy! We went in to rest a bit and the room ticked all the boxes - we were just looking for a place so spend a good night sleep and we got a very comfortable room for this. Value for money is unbeatable in Dublin. My only regret might be the bath that wasn't very deep - I love taking baths when I travel around - although to be honest it is probably very handy for elderly people as you don't have to lift your leg much to step in.
We took off very early the next morning to catch our flight, the gentleman at reception that wished us a safe journey was just as nice as the lady that checked us in.
But the service quality was yet on another level when I emailed two days letter in relation to a lost property, I have stayed in a couple of hotels in a short period of time and when I got home I realised I was missing something, so I emailed each place. The Jurys Inn Parnell Street rang me the very same afternoon and informed me that they did not have my belongings, their fast answer was greatly appreciated.
Meanwhile I am still waiting for the other place to get back to me, but this is another story altogether.

I strongly recommend to stay in Jurys Inn Parnell Street, you will be looked after if you need anything. I am looking forward to returning myself and will hopefully be back in March!",5,2018,01,13
231,Dublin break,I booked the Jury's Inn Parnell street due to its location which is excellent. The hotel was lovely and all the staff were very friendly.  The foid was good and the bed was super comfy. The only issue was that the bath was very low and only held about half the capacity of a regular bath. When lying down in the full bath most ofy body was not submerged. I'm 5ft 4 and a size 10 so anyone bigger would definitely not be able to take a bath. Luckily my husband prefers a shower so he was ok. It's not a deal breaker and I would stay here again.,5,2018,01,12
231,A Christmas Holiday.,"This is an excellent location close to all areas of the city and within walking distance of all the main attractions.  The hotel staff are very nice and the hotel is very secure with key access to the lifts and the various floors.  The room and the bathroom were clean. However this hotel is not set up for:
1) International travelers - could do with an update. The decor is tired and dated and could do with a good clean in the main areas. The room was very hot and when I left the window open when I went out, I returned to find it closed by Housekeeping.  I also detected a smell of smoke which I think must have come through the heating vents.  The toilet seat was broken when I arrived and was not fixed in the 10 days that I was there.  
or
 2) Single travelers.So -  the craic came back to the hotel at 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning on 5 of my 10 nights stay.  I was woken up by drunks shouting and slamming doors.  The dining room was not ready to receive the volume of guests over the festive period for either breakfast or dinner. Twice my breakfast was cleared away while I went back to the buffet breakfast to get a refill of coffee. Best to walk around the corner into Henry Street for breakfast. Christmas dinner was badly organized and the food cold and terrible.  I was put at a table in the corner and forgotten about. 

The staff and manager were very apologetic. They were keen to make amends but the problems remained.  I feel that 'Lessons learned' is not really good enough for what turned out to be a very expensive stay.",2,2018,01,12
231,Consistently Good,I am a regular in this hotel and I cannot praise the team enough.  Very professional and friendly staff from Security to reception to bar and restaurant to management.  Love staying there.  Close to everything and now the new Luas stops right beside it. So handy!!,5,2018,01,11
231,Great place,"Easy, good, Central, perfect . Loved the location , ease of access , pleasant staff. Great breakfast , good variety, good coffee .
Room very quiet, lived paper outside the door , enjoyed room service n one 3vening ",5,2018,01,11
231,Great location,"Been here lots of times now, and looking forward to my next trip. Hotel is lovely, staff are lovely and the location is brilliant.i also bring my children who love staying there. The breakfast is fabulous with everything you can think of on offer. Highly recommend this hotel ",5,2018,01,10
231,A middle age couple from Surrey,Could not fault this hotel at all. Perfect location and all the staff were very nice. It is a very clean hotel. The bedroom was beautiful. We was upgraded on arrival which we didn't expect. Would definitely return again ,5,2018,01,10
231,"A bed and a shower, simply put","We stayed one night before we flew back to the states. The hotel offered us a shower and a bed, but there are no fancy amenities. The staff was friendly and the rooms were sufficiently clean, but I would not stay there again. If you're on a budget and don't need much in the room, this would meet your needs. ",3,2018,01,10
231,Excellant location and friendly staff,"My wife and I stayed at Jurys Inn on Parnell street just after Christmas. The location of the hotel is great for exploring Dublin on foot. We arrived early just wanting to drop our bags off, but the very friendly and helpful staff informed us that there was a room ready if we wanted to check in, which we did. 

The room was spacious, clean and the quality of furnishing good. The water pressure in the shower was great. 

We had two minor issues. 

1 - due to the weather being cold, the heating needed to be kept on and this really dried out the air in the room leaving us both with dry eyes and mouth. 

2 - the goat's cheese salad in the bar was a little salty and we could not finish it. 

Overall, a great hotel at a great price.",4,2018,01,09
231,Excellent,"Wife and I visited Dublin and spent two nights at the jury's inn Parnell street. Hotel location is excellent, everything is walkable from there. Front desk we're first class, especially Mia who sorted us a room at 8am on our arrival when check-in wasn't formally until 2. Clean, spacious room and all in all very impressed with this hotel. 

Thanks ",5,2018,01,09
231,Good location,"The hotel was fantastic and very good value for money. We were given a disabled room so it was very spacious. The decor was very up to date and it was very clean. The bed was also one of the comfiest hotel beds I've ever slept in! 

In terms of location it was extremely close to the main shopping street and there were various pubs nearby too with live music and fantastic food. There was also a shop a few paces from the hotel doing an inexpensive 6 piece Irish breakfast. 

We are heavy sleepers so it wasn't really an issue for us, but below the hotel there was some building work going on. I believe they were putting in a Lidl. The building work started at 7am. My parents were staying on the floor below and were affected by it. This was of course not the hotels fault and it would not stop us from staying at the hotel again. 

We had a great stay in a fab hotel!",5,2018,01,09
231,"Clean, well located hotel","Room was clean, bed was comfortable.  Location is good if you want to be near centre.  Rooms at the back side of the hotel were quiet.  Bar on 2 nd floor pleasant.  Just note that hotel gives you a deal at the Q park, not at the others (Moore street) which we did not know beforehand which was a bit annoying.  Also very hard to unload luggage in front of hotel as all parking spaces were taken.  Luckily Moore street is very close and a secure parking garage - don't know how far Q park was from hotel.",4,2018,01,09
231,Fantastic ,"Great hotel in a great location.  Nice big rooms and comfy beds. Lovely buffett breakfast. Few minutes walk from the center so ideal location for sightseeing.   Would recommend this hotel to anyone.  Staff very friendly, we arrived early and we were able to leave our cases in a safe room until we checked in and the same on checkout.",5,2018,01,08
231,Excellemt location for shopping,"We stayed here last week as a family, 2 adults and 2 children. We were in a family room, one double and one single, toddler in travel cot which hotel provided. This had a comfy mattress and lovely little duvet and pillow which you don't often see just to note. The room was clean and cosy (it was a very cold night!) and staff at reception very friendly and helpful. We have stayed here before but this was our first time to include breakfast which was very good with lots of variety. The hotel is in an excellent location for shopping on Henry street and also plenty of places to eat nearby.",4,2018,01,08
231,fantastic stay at Jurys hotel,"excellent hotel, friendly staff, great location, stayed for a family wedding and the location was near all locations and staff very helpful about ordering taxi and directions to car park. If in Dublin again will  keep this hotel in mind.",5,2018,01,08
231,Good value and decent location,"We arrived early and were allowed to check in straight away.  We received a lovely welcome at reception were given lots of information about Dublin and received vouchers for one days breakfast.

Our room was lovely, bathroom could have been a bit cleaner and the view over the council rubbish dump wasn't the best!  

Breakfast was good but we could have been anywhere in the world and it didn't feel especially Irish or special.  We were overcharged at the hotel bar and the food was mediocre.

They allowed us a late check out at 10 euros an hour which we took advantage of and stayed until 4pm.  I would absolutely stay here again but would eat and drink elsewhere.",3,2018,01,07
231,Birthday city break,"This was the first time in seven years that my husband and I have managed to go away for more than one night without our two young children, so to say we were looking forward to this was an understatement. We were very impressed with the hotel on arrival - it was spotlessly clean and the foyer smelt beautiful. The Christmas decorations were still up and very elegant which added to the magic of this getaway. 
The desk staff were all so friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome immediately. The young gentleman on the desk was very polite and gave us complimentary drinks as it was my birthday as well as two free breakfasts - a lovely gesture.
When entering our room we were greeted with a cute display of balloons, chocolates, a birthday card and an invitation to the bar for complimentary Prosecco - what a marvellous start to a fantastic three days. 
We could not fault the hotel at all and on the second evening we visited the bar for our complimentary beverages where we were greeted by Louise - a fabulous bar tender and genuinely lovely person. Nothing was too much for her, she had wonderful knowledge of what to do and where to go in Dublin as well as making cracking cocktails! Louise recommended The Church for our evening meal and we were not disappointed. 
We would definitely recommend The Jury's Inn to anyone and everyone - a perfect location for a city break and a wonderful place to rest and relax. Thank you to all of the staff.",5,2018,01,07
231,Great value,"We flew into dublin for christmas so stayed here for one night before heading home to cork. 
Was amazed at the cheap price of a room for one night (considering dublin prices and its central location) 
All staff that we met were friendly and efficient from check in to check out! 
The rooms are spotless and even though our room faced directly on to parnell street we slept great. 
100% would return and recommend

231,Wonderful Xmas break,Brought my boyfriend to Dublin for a night as his Xmas present and chose this jury's inn through a friends recommendation. Absolutely perfect! Short walk for the air coach stop when we arrived from the airport and our room was ready (10am in the morning!). Staff were so helpful and couldn't do enough for us. The room was big and the bed was comfy! Just what you need after a night out round temple bar and a few too many guiness'! great location too! Will stay here again on our next trip to Dublin. xx,5,2018,01,05
231,Great Stay Great Staff ,"The location of this hotel is really good. Everywhere was maintained well and the rooms were comfortable and clean. The bar and restaurant areas were very comfortable too. Staff were very friendly and helpful at booking, check in and throughout our stay. Would we return? A big yes, it’s already booked! ",4,2018,01,05
231,Friendly hotel,"Very friendly. Clean hotel central to all your needs for a whistle stop visit to Dublin. Bus available almost outside the hotel, staff will see to any travel needs and give good advise ..staff gave us a detailed street map and highlighted favourite tourist destinations. The hotel was easy to book and very reasonable rates!! Easy check in and check out we arrived ahead of check in time and our room was available ! Large spacious room with a double and single bed hair dryer iron and plenty of hanging space.. room was light and airy. Very clean ..nice Lille touches like fruit on each floor and flavoured water also iced water available. Good experience would recommend this hotel !!!",5,2018,01,05
231,Great hotel,Had a fantastic time in Dublin. The hotel is in a great location and the staff are super helpful and friendly. Breakfast is great lots of choice. Room clean and comfy and super quiet for a city hotel. ,5,2018,01,05
231,Amazing location,Great hotel and location for anyone visiting the city nice and quiet to stay here not as good as other jury's in terms of service and communication between departments but would definitely recommend this hotel ,5,2018,01,04
231,Superb customer service,"Every single member of staff we encountered from check-in to check-out were brilliant. The service received in the bar was most notable where staff would approach your table to take orders so you don't have to keep getting up! Louise C, Robert and Kieran all made us feel very comfortable took care of us excellently. The food was lovely, through breakfast to evening meals. 
The room was immaculate and the bed was incredibly comfortable. I couldn't hear anything from the streets below with the two windows closed. Very safe as you need key card to make the lift move or to access stair cases, security was present on evenings in the lobby too.
The location of the hotel was very central with only a minute walk to bus services, the tram, the coach to the airport, a shopping center, many restaurants (mcdonalds,kfc, chain restaurants) and a tesco supermarket just opposite too. 
Nothing was a problem for the staff and they always stayed professional, friendly and approachable.
 I am very pleased with the whole experience and would choose this hotel again if I return to Dublin.",5,2018,01,04
231,Christmas in Dublin,Beautiful hotel and excellent position in the centre of Dublin.near many shops and restaurants.Hotel always offered free apples snd mincepies and wonderfalhot Christmas drink.Would recommend Jury’s inn to everyone ,5,2018,01,04
231,Excellent location,"Lovely welcoming, cosy hotel.  We stayed one night during a trip to Dublin to see the Christmas Panto.  The location was brilliant, everything in walking distance.  Staff were friendly and efficient, room was spotless, warm and had everything we needed.  Excellent breakfast.",5,2018,01,03
231,My new favourite,"I stayed in various hotels in Dublin, which differ in standard and quality. I tend to look for easy access for the airlink and good price. The Jurys Inn at Parnell Square offered the best price over NewYear so I booked there. I did not choose breakfast as I am vegetarian and usualky do not eat 11 Euro worth of breakfast. But the hotel surprised us. Not spectacular from the outside, it turned out to he quite luxurious. It is spacious in all public areas, floors and even bedrooms. It boasts a gym, bar, restaurant, room service and the friendliest staff you could wish for. We had a room looking on to the spire, which was nice. The windows have secondary double glazing which was perfect for keeping our orange juice and nibbles cool as there is no fridge in the room. It would have been great to have a second chair in the room, as one of us always had to sit on the bed. What really surprised us was that the hotel is so quiet. We never heard a banging door or conversations from the next room. It was the quietest hotel of all the ones we stayed in so far. Another very pleasant surprise were the safety features, you need your room card to call the lift or choose a floor or open some doors on the floors. When we returned to the hotel after NewYears celebrations we were greeted by the night porter who checked our names against the room lists. Apparently this was done to make sure all guests returned back safely, but I suspect they also want to ensure that no strangers are being taken back to the rooms, which I liked.
This is now my favourite Dublin hotel. There are 3 supermarkets and the ilac shopping arcade right around the hotel and seversl pubs. The airport coaches leave from Parnell Square or O'Connell Street, just 3 minutes to walk to.The new Luas stops just around the corner and takes you to the Liffey in minutes. I stayed in the Jurys Inn at Christchurch a few times, but this one is superiour. If they have a good price deal on again, it will definitely be my next choice again!",5,2018,01,03
231,"Comfortable, Clean and Well Positioned for Central Dublin","Staff on reception were friendly and well informed. Room was a good size, well equipped and scrupulously clean. Very comfortable bed made for a good nights sleep. Bar and restaurant looked inviting but we did not use either as we were there for a celebration in another hotel. Breakfast was varied and accommodated our needs, very tasty.
A very effective and functional hotel in an excellent location.",4,2018,01,03
231,Lovely hotel - on work trip and shame about the party noise!!,"I visited the Dublin Parnell street hotel for work and stated a work trip on my booking through booking.com. 
I had been travelling since 3am in the morning on the day I arrived - when I went to bed that night all I could hear was doors slamming shut, people talking and walking about the corridors and what sounded like furniture being dragged about on the floor above. 
I had to be up again at 4am the following morning and didn't get to sleep until gone 2am.

I specifically stated a work trip on my booking and would have expected to have been placed separately from what I was told the next morning was a Christmas party taking place in the hotel. 
Either way - I wouldn't expect to pay £170 on a hotel for 1 night to be disturbed to the extent I was. 
Extremely disappointed and tired the next day. 

Quality of room and hotel was lovely - only thing that let it down was the party stopping me from sleeping.. the one thing I needed! ",3,2018,01,03
231,A few days in dublin,"Excellent hotel for a short break, only a few minutes walk to the city centre. Breakfast was fantastic and the rooms were clean and spacious. Staff were all very friendly and nothing was too much trouble ",5,2018,01,03

231,Value for Money and a very nice breakfast :-),"Jurys Inn is a perfect place, if you are in Dublin as turist. It is located in the center of Dublin and you are able to walk to almost all turist attractions.
The staff is very nice and helpfull and Jurys Inn serves and very nice breakfast.
Value for Money....",4,2018,01,02
231,Aanrader voor city-trip! ,"Excellent hotel. Great location, you can do everything on foot - no need for public transport. Nearby a lot of shopping malls, supermarkets etc, so very lively neighborhood.  We were welcomed by a very friendly staff. Breakfast was great, traditional things (bacon, blackpudding, etc., ) but also a lot of healtier alternatives (granola, seeds, fresh fruit, yoghourt, glute-free things) Only the orange juice was not good at all! The rooms were cosy and very clean. A separate handshower would be nice next to the rain shower. A very nice hotel that I would recommend to everyone! 
",4,2018,01,02
231,Great location and Stay,"The room was clean and the staff was helpful and friendly. The bar was fun in the evenings to relax in after a long day of sight seeing. The breakfast was a good selection of UK style breakfast foods (so if your an American and not happy, get over yourself, and enjoy the experience)",5,2018,01,02
231,Best!,"The location of the hotel is close to everything. The staff - from front desk (Rosalind), housekeeping and restaurant (breakfast crew) were all topnotch. Very attentive, friendly, thoughtful and courteous. You have to experience this place to understand. They rank 5 stars to us. A wonderful, memorable experience. ",5,2018,01,02
231,Well located hotel with no bad surprises,"A functional well-located hotel which provides a good base to explore the city. Decor is a bit dated and double beds a bit on the small side, but it was clean and comfortable. Get to breakfast early as we had to wait over 20 minutes to be seated for our breakfast and not all food items were available at that stage. Staff were helpful and friendly.",4,2018,01,02
231,Dublin Business Trip,"Over all, Its nice and long stay in the hotel. Its very close to city center. easy to commute to airport and all other locations. lots of shopping options. Very few TV channels are available for entertainment. we can have more channels to watch in TV.",4,2018,01,02
231,Great hotel in city centre.,"Lovely hotel with a good location in city centre. Nice bar with good food. Staff were very pleasant and helpful, especially the check in staff. We got a very reasonable price for a good sized family room.",5,2018,01,01
231,"Very nice hotel, good location","Perfect location: pubs and stores within walking distance while our room was very quiet. Staff was very friendly, we checked in earlier but our room was already available. Breakfast choices are huge. We also had Christmas dinner here, which was a bit disappointing but overall I would definitely book here again. ",4,2018,01,01

231,"Jury's out and the verdict is ""perfection""","Stayed at Jury's Inn Parnell Street over Christmas 2017.  Six of us.  Staff were faultless as were the food, facilities and decor.  Our room was smaller than we might have desired but clean, comfortable and well decorated.  Bed large and comfortable.  Independent heating/cooling controls. Ideally situated for the many venues, which Dublin has on offer, including pubs, eateries, shops, museums and cinema.  Plenty of buses and a tram.  Taxis not expensive.  Would love to return.",5,2017,12,28
231,Very good stay for Christmas shopping,Very good stay for Christmas shopping only downside is the distance from the hotel to the assoicated parking which is an additional €10 per day. Very good breakfast with a lot of variety. Excellent room service & helpfull staff. We have stayed here every year for Christmas shopping for the last 4 years. ,4,2017,12,28

The bar was a bit pricey ",5,2017,12,27
231,"Friendly staff , Christmassy feeling."," Staff were really friendly and excellent, no faults apart from the advertisement of a Gym which isn't really a gym. I stayed here with my misses and two young girls. As soon as you walk in there is a perfumed essence which makes you immediately like the place.",4,2017,12,27

231,Home Away From Home,"A BIG shout out to Rosilda and the rest of the hotel staff for making our ten days stay over the Christmas holiday a peaceful and restful one.  Rosilda for checking us in with such consideration for our ten day stay.  We stayed in a room that was quiet and comfortable.  To the rest of her team at the front desk...your smiles where so welcome along with answers to any questions we had.  To the maid service, Wow...everyday our rooms were cleaned and well cared for.  A great shout out to the night security guards who had that extra eye in the lobby.  Also, thank you for making the hotel so cheerful during the Christmas holiday.  The location of the hotel is central to all things Dublin.  Loved it!",5,2017,12,25
231,Short stay quick easy and friendly,Had a short stay with no time for breakfast due to an early hospital appointment and had no problem gettting a late check out when wwe were delayed returnin to the hotel. as always good value for money and we booked the hotel at the last minute,5,2017,12,23
231,Mikko,Very nice stay with handy walking to the city and main attractions. Great location for shopping and touring around the city. Pleasant stay and friendly atmosphere during the whole stay make it comfortable and welcoming. ,4,2017,12,22
231,A Very Good Hotel,"First impact in any hotel is the response of the Desk personnel. Although we arrived late due to a Ryanair problem we were made very welcome and given a choice of location of our room as I had requested a quiet but accessible one. When I mentioned that it was our wedding anniversary, the delightful Catherzine (Sp?) wrote us an invitation for two complimentary glasses of wine in the bar. A nice touch.

Reception later proved excellent at getting me taxis at fairly short notice. Thanks.

Our good sized room was fine although it was made a little cramped by having a double bed plus a single bed that resulted in the space from bedside to wall of bathroom being just 15"". Tea and coffee making in the room very helpful although I long for the day when the use of UHT milk in quality hotels becomes a thing of the past.

My only other gripe concerned the fixed dispensers of soap, shampoo and body wash in the en-suite. Use from a basin is OK but the dispensers fixed to a wall by the shower could not be accessed from the bath with convenience. I'm sure this system is efficient but not convenient. Those little bottles are much more convenient.

Breakfast on a Sunday morning, when most guests have decided to have a lie-in, inevitably resulted in queuing for a table but all was dealt with calmly and efficiently by the duty manageress and we were soon seated. All the restaurant staff were very  pleasant and helpful.

The only surprising aspect about the restaurant was that tables were devoid of cutlery, serviettes and indeed any crockery - all of which was self-service for the guests as was the buffet breakfast - which was excellent but I think the hotel needs to acknowledge the difference between efficiency and convenience. With waitresses only needing to clear and wipe tables and guests having to do everything else including serving themselves from a central coffee unit. This is obviously very efficient but to my mind not very convenient for guests. In a Little Chef this would be normal but not with a hotel of this standard.

On the second day of our 3 night stay  we had a staff member delivering us a card acknowledging our anniversary [50+ years] and an invitation to 2 glasses of prosecco in the bar. A very nice touch. All these little things gave me the feeling that Jurys Inn cares for its guests.

Whilst I have a few gripes as above, I would unhesitatingly recommend this hotel and will return one day. Jury's Inn is a good hotel and, with just a little more commitment to gusts's convenience, it could be a truly great hotel.",4,2017,12,21
231,Great location and food," I would highly recommend this hotel it was in central Dublin extremely accessible to all local amenities. The staff were friendly and checking out was extremely swift.
 The breakfast selection is tremendous I would highly recommend this property ",5,2017,12,21
231,Excellent!,"Everything was more then perfect. The staff was extremely friendly. We went there with our 2 year old son and he got things for painting every morning. The room was clean and the breakfast was awesome! 
There is absolutely nothing to complain about! Also the location is perfect. The bus station to and from the airport is 300 meters away and the biggest shopping street around 200 meters. I would recommend that hotel.",5,2017,12,20
231,Christmas trip!," This hotel was in a great location, easy to find. The staff were very courteous and friendly and rooms comfortable.  The carpets throughout the hallways were a bit dated but not untidy.  There was free fruit bowls throughout the hotel to help yourself to. The breakfast was the best breakfast I have come across in a bed and breakfast accommodation, literally... something for everyone.  Would definitely recommend this hotel, we stayed on 5th floor and slept very well. ",5,2017,12,19
231,Shopping,"We recently stayed in Jurys Inn to finish our christmas shopping and were bery happy woth it's central location. The hotel os also located near good bars and restaurants such as murrays on o'connell street, if you want nice food and live music. The hotel was excellent with an extremely spacious double room. What stood out for us compared to other hotels was how friendly the staff were, especially on reception, they could not have been more helpful. We will be back to stay again, this hotel in my opinion is far superior to many of its local competitors. ",5,2017,12,19
231,Birthday weekend,"I booked this for my partners birthday pack in the summer and couldn’t decide on hotels for ages. So glad I went for this - was very impressed. Like most of Dublin the staff were very friendly and helpful, no complaints. Room was perfect ( bath could of done with being deeper ) but everything else that you could need the room provided. We spent most of our time out anyway, but what we needed from a hotel it ticked all our boxes and very good for what we paid . ",5,2017,12,18
231,Leisure Break,Myself and my wife had a very enjoyable night in this very central Jurys Inn hotel in Parnell Square in Dublin. It is very disappointing to see the significant increase in the number of human beings sleeping on some of the major streets of Dublin.  ,5,2017,12,18
231,Shortbreak,"Lovely stay in Dublin close to all amenities and great location for shopping,very nice spacious clean rooms, nice choice for breakfast,staff throughout the hotel were exceptional and very pleasant, would recommend for anybody visiting Dublin",5,2017,12,18
231,"Great location, poor customer service","We paid extra for an upgrade to an Executive Room, and it was no bigger than a standard double room. There was supposed to be a stocked fridge but it was empty. The bed was comfy, but the pillows were awful and extremely uncomfortable. The bathroom was very small and the door didn’t close properly. We had a late checkout but we were locked out of our room early for no particular reason. The reception staff were not very friendly and we weren’t even asked how our stay was when we checked out. They were not very flexible with the parking and seemed to make an issue about it.",2,2017,12,18
231,Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street - Excellent location and hotel,"Great location, very central. Staff were great and very friendly. Facilities were good. Bathroom was a little dated but clean. Standard bedroom was fairly snug but comfortable.
Hotel overall was clean and well presented. 
",5,2017,12,18
231,Christmas break," Bathroom amenities were terrible. Room badly needed updating. I was very disappointed as I have stayed at Jurys numerous times before and never encountered this problem. I was really up-happy with the dated room and will not be staying there again.",1,2017,12,18
231,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Stayed here for one night, travelled to Dublin for the Olympia Theatre panto (that’s another story). This hotel is located right in the heart of Dublin, literally 1 minute walk from the end of O’Connell Street. On arrival the reception staff were very professional and courteous. They provided us with local information and advice that if we wanted to order a taxi to do it early because of the time of year. We were given the choice of a room overlooking the street, or overlooking the central courtyard in the centre of the building, we opted for the latter and were very happy with the room. There was no street noises at all. If you are booking this hotel, ask for this at the time of reserving your room. The room was quite big enough and had everything you would expect. The bathroom was quite big as well and features a bath, which appeals to a lot of people. The beds are large and probably the most comfortable hotel beds I have slept on. 
For breakfast, there is quite a spread laid on, everything is in plentiful supple and is very nice. If I were to have a complaint about this hotel it would be about the “fry up”, they never seemed to have all the ingredients there at the same time. I went to get mine, there was everything except fried eggs, so I went to sit down to wait. I went up a few minutes later, there were fried eggs, but the sausages had run out. I know it’s busy at breakfast time, but this is something that a professional team should be on top of. 
Other than that, no complaints. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is planning a trip to Dublin. ",4,2017,12,17
231,Xmas trip,Very pleasant trip with my daughter made special by the professional service of staff and comfort of our room. We were well looked after in the bar after a long day shopping. Perhaps organising a taxi could be more efficient.,5,2017,12,17
231,A perfect stay,"Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street is a 3 star hotel placed close to the city center. Our room was very confortable and all the staff was very kind to us. We enjoyed an amazing stay at this hotel, and we totally recommend it. ",5,2017,12,17
231,Noise problem,"Good check-in and check-out, good breakfast. But some bedrooms can be very noisy. It's bedrooms in the corner of the building (at least) which have a door with the next bedroom (which seem to be a bedroom of a suite which can be separated). The door betweed both bedrooms isreally very bad at muffling sounds",2,2017,12,16
231,Birthday weekend away,Excellent experience averall. Staff couldn’t be any more friendly. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Will definitely come back here. Food was excellent rooms were spotless.  I can’t find anything to fault about this hotel.,5,2017,12,16
231,Highly recommended !!,"Just had an excellent stay here ..very nice and worth it breakfast, high level of hygiene,security, service and also location is perfect . It also promotes environment-awareness providing opportunity to recycle and advise on how to make your stay there more environmentally friendly which is awesome !! Keep up your good work in favor of the environment !!",5,2017,12,15
231,Perfect for B&B; well priced.,"Visited Dublin as a couple to take in the Christmas sights and do some traditional shopping.  This was a first stay at Jurys in Dublin.  Reception was efficient and friendly.  Travelling by car, I parked in Q-Park on Brugha Street (foot access from Marlborough Street)  have your ticked authorised at reception when you leave and €10 per day instead of €18.
Access to the hotel rooms from reception is via room card only.  The hotel is well positioned at the Parnell Street end of O’Connell Street.  The nearest cross-town Luas stop is just a short walk away.  However, if you prefer to walk to the Grafton Street/St Stephen’s Green area, it is 20 minutes away (and back).  It is close to Henry Street 3 – a 3-minute walk.
The room was on the 3rd floor and was well appointed.  Everything was fresh, in good working order and a good size.  The bed was comfortable as were the pillows.  Heating and air conditioning worked well.  There was open hanging space, a couple of drawers and a couple of open shelves.  One drawer contained a standard, good hair dryer.  There is no safe in the room.  Safety deposit is available at reception, but this omission in the room is notable.
The shower was the over-bath type, but was very good.  I was immediately suspicious of the shower curtain – a pet hate – but on first use I discovered that the curtain rail was curved out from the shower which prevented the static pull that bedevilled all previous curtains that I have seen – brilliant and simple!
Breakfast was entirely self-service, was more than adequate and very tasty!",4,2017,12,15
231,Nice Hotel close to centre and the action,"Just like a hotel should be. Good food, service and accommodation. We stayed for two nights and the overall experience was pleasant. Staff was friendly and helpful and the position of the hotel was terrific close to the main shopping street and other main attractions of the city but still a little outside the most busy part.",5,2017,12,14
231,Fantastic hotel ,"Stayed with 5 friends. The hotel is spotlessly clean with large, comfy beds. The breakfast is excellent, drinks in the bar are no more expensive than anywhere else in Dublin. Hotel is situated within easy walking access to the centre. Used 747 bus from airport but hotel booked us a taxi back which worked out cheaper than the bus. 
",5,2017,12,14
231,Excellent,"Great location. Close to everything first time visitors to Dublin looking for. Short walk to city centre, pubs, food entertainment, temple bar and grafton St. Staff welcoming and helpful. Rooms clean & roomy. Great breakfast buffet. Would certainly recommend.",5,2017,12,14
231,Very Good,"I've stayed here several times and its always perfect. Not as expensive as the Christchurch location and just as good a location, even closer to shops etc and short walk from Temple Bar. Good clean rooms and excellent service as expected from Jurys.",4,2017,12,13

231,Great visit! ,"Stayed here with my partner for his birthday and couldn’t fault it really. 

The hotel is in the perfect location. Near all local amenities and a short taxi ride to things like the storehouse and goal. 

Had a warm welcome when checking in and had rung ahead to ask for a bottle of prosecco in the room which was all sorted when we arrived. 

Rooms were clean and spacious, although bed could have been a little comfier. 

Breakfast was great - all you can eat buffet which set us up for the day! 

Staff were all extremely pleasant & helpful throughout our stay. 

Would definitely stay here again and recommend to family & friends. ",5,2017,12,12
231,weekend trip,"great location, short walk to Trinity, Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green. Breakfast buffet was great, and well worth the price, 11 euros. The staff was extremely friendly and courteous. Great value for Dublin. ",5,2017,12,12

231,"Top located hotel, friendy Stuff","we expected a little bit more comfort for the price (only one chair for 2 persons, no minibar, no toiletbrush, windows dirty), quiet rooms in the back, breakfast was good and more than enough, the staff very friendly and helpfully. perfect to visit the city, everything ist nearby",3,2017,12,11
231,simply excellent,"All simply very good, staff very helpful, rooms good, bed excellent, good service at restaurant, bar and lobby, location very good. Shopping just around the corner. Quiet area and still all that is needed within short walking distance ",5,2017,12,11
231,December CHill,"Despite many good features, this hotel fails to reach the top bracket for pre-emotive maintenance which ensures that the room temperature at this critical time of year is adequate.  I was cold in my room when not under the duvet!
Guests on business trips should not be obliged to spend time calling for maintenance which should be dealt with before guests occupy their rooms.
For this reason, despite the excellent location and other positive features, this hotel does not get full endorsement. From me",4,2017,12,11
231,Perfect location,"Myself and my partner stayed here for his birthday in Feb 17. I had booked it as a surprise for him. Our flight was early in the day and luckily when we arrived at the hotel our room was ready for us to check in. They had also put some balloons and chocolates in the room for his birthday which was a lovely touch. The location was perfect to walk into the center for a days adventures and meals. Couldn't recommend the hotel enough, if you looking for an affordable hotel for a couple of nights. When we left, we were allowed to leave our bags there until we needed them to go back to the airport, which was very handy. The staff were very accommodating",4,2017,12,11

231,A good hotel,"Clean, comfortable hotel. Ask for a room at the end of the hallway, which will be quieter.   The hotel needs to upgrade its soundproofing.  The breakfast was included in our room rate, and was a good value for our family.",4,2017,12,04

231,Lovely Hotel and Staff,"Had a three night break at this hotel, as a birthday treat. On arrival at 1030 pm check in couldn't have been easier. the only thing we weren't told were that you had to use your key card in the lifts to get to upper floors. On thinking about it its a good security feature. Although we didn't have dinner in the Hotel we had breakfast which was really good also the bar and bar staff were good and the bar prices were better than some of the local bars.Our room was on forth floor it was clean and bed was extremely comfortable. would not hesitate to stay again.",5,2017,12,03
231,Dublin stop,"If you have a car, find a hotel that has onsite parking or valet parking. Finding the car park was very difficult since we arrived after dark.  The hotel is fine, the location is great - staff was friendly.",4,2017,12,02

Didn’t have a safe but there was an iron and board, tea and coffee and UK 3 pin plug sockets. Restaurant was a bit pricey but food was fairly good. Great breakfast with loads of choice. Staff were very helpful and pleasant. 
The hotel is in a good location for getting to most of the sights in Dublin. I would definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,11,29
231,Superb stay; no complaints,"A faultless stay at this Jurys Inn. Got it at a very good rate through Booking.com and was very happy with our stay.

Located on Parnell St, just to the top of O'Connell St, this hotel was great for getting around the city whether it was by foot or bus. From the airport, we hopped on the 747 which dropped us on O'Connell St. Look into the Leap Card as that may prove worth it if you're likely to use city transport as well as getting to and from the airport during your visit to the city.

Checking in was a doddle and made even better when told our room was ready despite it being a couple of hours before check in time of 2pm. The room was just what we needed; a very comfortable bed and a clean bathroom with a powerful shower. The whole place was nicely looked after and clean.

Would happily stay here again if visiting Dublin.",5,2017,11,29
231,Noisiest hotel I’ve ever stayed in,"A modern block type hotel. Rooms fine, but gosh how much noise from below. I have a view of the council refuse depot and the loading bay of the hotel. Lorries reversing into loading bay, engines left running, noise of vehicle being emptied and it happens throughout the night. The refuse depot seems to work all night. Not to mention the drunks in the alley way. 

If you have an inside room you have a view of walls, bit like a prison. 

It may be a reasonable price for Dublin, but good value, I’m not so sure, especially if you actually want to sleep!!",1,2017,11,29
231,Excellent,"Excellent hotel, especially for people who is focus on sightseeing. 
Convenient location to Liffey River, Temple bar, TCD, Grafton street, Henry street and Tesco. It is easy to take Laus, Hop in and Hop off tourist bus. 
Nice breaskfast and friendly staff.",5,2017,11,29
231,Worth the price ,"Me and my husband booked a trip package, I looked at hundreds of hotels and this was one of the offered hotels. It was a very clean and minimalist but had a fabulous breakfast and was an easy walk to all the sites. (I had a broken foot and was in a walking boot so I wasn't moving that well but could make it everywhere). The shower was really small however so if you are a bigger person be warned.",5,2017,11,28
231,"Exceptional staff. Beautiful decor , perfect city location.",Couldn't ask for more.   The staff have obviously been trained to a very high standard and were able to anticipate our every need. Decor was beautiful. Location so convenient to everything. Food was perfect ,5,2017,11,28

231,"1 Night stay in Jurrys Inn, Parnell Square, Dublin","Lovely place to stay, Very friendly staff, Room was warm and very comfortable, Breakfast was lovely and very filling , I like the idea that only residents can get to the floors where the rooms are and I Love the selection of Apple's when you come off the lift.",5,2017,11,27
231,"Friendly, comfortable hotel","From the moment we checked into this hotel everything felt good.  Friendly, efficient receptionist.  Smooth check-in and quiet comfortable rooms.  I have to have a gluten free breakfast and the ladies in the restaurant were so helpful and accommodating.  The only criticism I have is that if you supply a toaster for gluten free bread then it is imperative no one uses it for “normal” bread so maybe a little notice wouldn’t go amiss.",4,2017,11,26
231,Great Location,"Great location, a short  walk to both the Temple Area and the 3 Arena. Staff really friendly and helpful. Rooms comfortable enough for a short city break.

Bar on second floor which is a welcome escape

The bar area is well laid out and a nice space to enjoy a few drinks and the bar food is excellent. ,5,2017,11,24
231,Highly recommended,"This was our first visit to Dublin and we arrived at the hotel at 9am knowing our room wouldn't be available, but the receptionist (think she was called Mia) could not do enough for us. We were able to complete the paperwork and leave our luggage and when we were asked if we were visiting for a special occasion (it was my birthday treat!)the receptionist returned with a voucher for 2 free drinks in the bar, a lovely gesture and a great start to our weekend. She also had great advice regarding public transport and gave us a map to highlight points of interest.
The hotel is in a great location just a 5 minute walk away from the centre. 
Our room had a very comfy double bed, sofa and armchair so was very spacious and clean.
We ate in the hotel bar the first night and found the staff so friendly and welcoming, the food was really good too. On visiting the bar the second night to claim our free drinks, we found the barman (Kieron) to be very knowledgeable and helpful. As a whole we commented that all the staff were lovely.
Breakfast was fantastic with so much choice, we said it was the best hotel breakfast we had eaten.
Would definitely recommend this hotel without a doubt!

",5,2017,11,23

Overal expected better room for price paid",3,2017,11,21
231,First Time Visit,"Visited over the weekend in November to celebrate a 40th birthday.  The hotel was very well located, the rooms were comfortable, and the staff friendly and helpful.

The hotel is in an ideal location too as it’s centre to everything. Thanks to all, will definitely be visiting again!😊",5,2017,11,21
231,Couldn’t go past it for a shopping trip in Dublin,"Great hotel, excellent customer service. Good location. Value for money. Petra on reception was particularly friendly and helpful. We upgraded our room so that we had a fridge etc. Would def stay here again due to the value for money aspect ",5,2017,11,21
231,"Good hotel, well situated, with a good restaurant but no parking","The hotel is well situated, clean and comfortable. We had a nice stay with our young children.
The restaurant is very pleasant and good. They have (of course) good beers too. A nice place for dinner.
The staff is friendly and rather efficient.
The fact that they have no parking is a no-go if you come by car, as they will send you to a public parking, not far away, but the traffic in this area of Dublin can make you waste quite some time.",3,2017,11,21
231,Good Hotel,"The hotel is really nice. The rooms are clean and modern.
Good beds. Near some fine restaurants, bars, shoppingstreet/centre and bus stop from the airlink. 
Just a 15 minute walk to busy temple bar district.
",4,2017,11,21
231,"Good location, good hotel, good breakfast","My husband and I stayed here in January with our 10 week old son.  The hotel room was great and spacious and had a travel cot put in for us.  The breakfast was awesome, great selection of food and lots of seating.  The location is great as well, only a 5-10 minute was from the temple bar.  A tesco is right across the street which was handy for picking up formula, nappies, etc.  The only negative, is that the area seemed to attract some dodgy people on the streets which would have made me feel a bit uneasy if I had to walk alone at night.  All in all though, it was a great hotel, I would stay again and I would recommend.",4,2017,11,20
231,Concert stay with friends,"Beautiful hotel. Very well located. Parking available at q prk for 10e overnight . And was  Within walking distance . luas abbey street stop was across the road  .

231,Breakfast very poor,"Location excellent & rooms very clean! But very poor & disappointing breakfast, stayed three nights, breakfast was so bad the first morning we chose to have the breakfast somewhere else instead. Hot breakfast wasn’t even warm. I don’t think we will even stay here again, having been staying here every year when we come to Dublin.. it’s very disappointing! ",3,2017,11,19
231,Fantastic hotel ,"Absolutely fantastic from start to
End, hotel staff can’t do enough for you room
Lovely and clean and location perfect for seeing Dublin, loved it and would
Definitely return to this hotel. Thank you for making our visit to
Dublin one to remember ",5,2017,11,19
231,What a great place to stay,"So many things to do. Shopping, bars etc and the quality of the room and all the staff encountered was second to none. Looking forward to coming back . Ideally located for all the key shopping outlets and only a 22 minute walk to the the point arena or 10 minute walk to the tram and a ten minute ride. I would consider using this for a family fun  visit as well as for business ",5,2017,11,18
231,Just right,"Entrance to the hotel is lovely. The x mas decorations were just being put up. The bedroom was large and spacious. The bed really comfortable. Breakfast was excellent value for money. The location was perfect for shops, bars, buses . Taxis or walking. Loved it.",5,2017,11,18
231,Jury’s inn Dublin,This one stay has put me off jurys inn. every time I’ve stayed I would give a positive response but the cleanliness of the towels put me off completely. I know not all jury’s inn are the same but I would keep thinking of the disgusting towel in the bathroom,1,2017,11,17
231,Great value,Good location. Close to airport shuttle stop. Clean and comfortable rooms. The staff was friendly and helpful. Enjoyed the breakfast. Breakfast offered a wide variety. Second visit to this hotel. Would stay again. ,5,2017,11,16
231,Would stay again without question,"A very pleasant stay.  Spotlessly clean lovely rooms (we had 4) friendly and pleasant staff.  Would stay here again without question.  A great location for all Dublin sight seeing, shopping and guinness! ",5,2017,11,16
231,Adequate hotel,"Its hard to say anything negative about Jurys Inn on Parnell street. Everything works and is nice and clean.

But at the same time, the hotel is just a basic hotel, nothing fancy and nothing exceeding expectations, so only three stars from me.",3,2017,11,16
231,Friendly helpful staff,"The gentleman on reception was very friendly, efficient and gave an excellent service. Room was clean bright and had everything including an espresso coffee machine. Check out was seamless.  This hotel is in the centre of Dublin near Moore Street and a 10 minute walk from Grafton street.  The new luas tram line passes outside the door.  Plenty of taxis nearby as well as local busses.  5min walk to get the Aircoach to the airport",5,2017,11,15
231,Concert stay,"Great hotel for location and the staff are really friendly and go above and beyond. Very easy check in, the rooms are spotlessly clean and we had a free upgrade to an exec room. Great little extras like a nespresso machine, full size bottles of waters and even a box of choccies. ",5,2017,11,15
231,Cameron Dublin Nov 2017,If you are going to Dublin this is the hotel for you the staff are friendly warm and welcoming. The hotel is clean and central. I have stayed there twice and I would not stay anywhere else it is one of the best hotel I have stayed in exception service all round. Well done Jury's Inn. ,5,2017,11,15
231,Prefect location,"First time staying there, I found the hotel to be spotless and the staff were mannerly and very well trained. The over all location was very good, bus station was very near by and all the major shopping centers were within walking distance. Plus also on arrival at reception I found the receptionist Colm (graduate manager) to be very welcoming and very professional at his job. For me it was very enjoyable stay, ten out of ten.",5,2017,11,14
231,"Great accommodation, disappointing restaurant supervising staff","Great reception staff and room! 
Arrived to flowers and balloons in the room for my friends birthday, her smile was priceless!! Thank you so much!
We had a meal in the restaurant, it was obvious that there was a gentleman training (well we hope he was) and made a few mistakes... including ordering the wrong steak for my friend who was then made to pay the extra, once we told another waitress she said the best she could do was take 10% off the price of the steak? To be very honest, my friend shouldn’t have been charged the extra for a staff members mistake (that we over heard him admitting to).
Along with waiting for drinks... because they were forgotten about!? 
The food when it arrived was absolutely amazing! We would definitely stay again, but most likely eat out next time! 
",4,2017,11,14
231,Good hotel in great location! ,"Good reasonably priced hotel in great location just off O’Connell Street, near to airport coach stops and walking distance into central Dublin area. Clean room with standard facilities. Would definitely use again.",5,2017,11,14
231,Find somewhere else,Room was not up to scratch. Blankets available were limited to one kind being allergic to feather blankets you need to find another hotel if you eant better hekp from staff. Overalk a bad experience..,2,2017,11,14
231,Excellent Service,"I recently had an issue using a third party booking company whilst booking a trip to Ireland. I booked the wrong date for the room and whilst the third party company were unwilling to do anything about it, the hotel manager, Ciara went above and beyond to resolve this for me. 

After having such a negative experience with the agency, I was so grateful for the good will displayed by hotel management and the team. 

BEWARE OF THIRD PARTY AGENCIES. Book direct where possible and you won't have an issue with this hotel.

Thanks again.",5,2017,11,14
231,Excellence,We could not fault any part of our stay.  It was outstanding. The location in central Dublin means that all venues and activities are easily accessible. The standard of service is excellent and staff are very accommodating. ,5,2017,11,14
231,Another great stay,"Friendly, well trained staff in a comfortable, clean and well appointed hotel. This is our second stay at this hotel and once again it didn't disappoint. In the middle of shops and restaurants with the buses a short stroll away, you could wish for nothing more.",5,2017,11,13
231,Great place for a stop over,"Lovely hotel. Staff very friendly. Our room had all we needed and was cosy, comfortable and very clean. Bed and bedding were very snug. Plenty of space for what we needed on a 2 night stop over. Breakfast was really good. €10 pp but the choice and variety was so good it filled us up till dinner in the evening.
Late check out at 12noon was a big plus too. Only minor criticism is would of loved a couple of extra milk pots in our room but I’m sure if I asked they would of given me some I just made use of what I had and had extra teas with the unlimited breakfast. 
Thanks for a great stay. Ps your housekeeping team work very hard so well done to them. ",4,2017,11,13
231,A good city center choice,"Stayed as a couple for 2 nights recently and we were quite happy with the stay. The hotel is in a very good location just off O'Connell Street and you can walk from here to most attractions, although the Three Arena or the Bord Gais Theatre are quite a bit away. Check In was quick and friendly, and we were alerted on checking in that there might be some noise from work going on next door. The rooms were clean and a reasonable size. The bed was a little small, and the mattress harder than some might like, but it suited me fine. The bathroom is small, but there is a bath along with a shower. The shower was good and easy to get the right temperature of water. I would bring your own toiletries as I am not a fan of the ""all in one"" types provided here. The soap dispenser over the sink was quite high, which was odd. The bar is a pleasant place to have a drink, with a decent selection of beers and wines. The food was of good quality but a little expensive for what it was. Breakfast was very good, lots of choice and hot. As usual in Irish Hotels the coffee is poor enough. There is no onsite parking but lots of choice in the area. All in all a good choice - I suspect I will be staying again!",4,2017,11,13
231,Dublin joy,"All our family (9 inc a 2 year old) stayed at Jury's over a weekend in Dublin.  It's the first time we've done something like this.  We thoroughly enjoyed Dublin, the city is so charming and wonderful and this was equalled with our stay at Jury's at Parnell Street.  The hotel was clean and well positioned in the city and the staff were friendly and charming.  What more could you ask for?  We enjoyed it so much we're going to have a family city weekend break every year!!  ",5,2017,11,13
231,Good standard hotel stay for tourists,"Jurys Parnell Street is in an interesting and convenient location, within walking distance of many businesses, restaurants, and sites of interest.  (Unfortunately, there appear to be no rooms with interesting views.)  Despite the busy area, the neighborhood seems very safe and is quite quiet at night; the beds were clean and comfortable.  The breakfast and other available foods were of good quality but of a somewhat limited, unchanging variety.

Our room prices were reasonable. though they can vary considerably depending on when and how one books them.  The staff were friendly and helpful, although some who were not local weren't quite up to speed in giving requested information/advice.

The main drawbacks here are outdated ideas of what travelers generally now expect of a hotel.  There were no clocks in the rooms, and in-room safes and mini-fridges only in higher priced (and otherwise undistinguished) ""executive"" rooms.  The selection of cable TV channels seemed to be different in every room, and nowhere included international channels such as CNN.  As in many UK hotels, washcloths ('flannels') were not included in the linens.  There was no business center where a guest could check e-mail, print boarding passes, etc.

One gets the feeling that with imagination and relatively small investments, the quality of vacation stays at this hotel could be considerably improved.  If it were possible I would increase my rating to 3½ out of 5, but a 4 would be exaggerating.  If I return to Dublin, I wouldn't rule out staying here again, but would take a careful look at the competition first.",3,2017,11,10
231,Nice place in nice part of town,"Great location with a very good breakfast that while a buffet, has everything you want on a traditional Irish breakfast and much much more including gluten free bread and options. We stayed here for two nights and loved the location, which is a short, 15 min walk to Temple Bar and a 20 min walk to the Jameson distillery. While parking isn't included, they have a deal with a parking garage about 4 blocks away to charge 10 euros per day. Pulling up to the hotel was pretty difficult as there is no place that allows you even to drop off your luggage. Staff was very very friendly and helpful all the way around.",4,2017,11,10
231,Overall very enjoyable.,Overally very enjoyable. Good location which was walking distance to many things. Staff was courteous and helpful though not particular personable. Rooms were clean though beds were a bit uncomfortable. ,4,2017,11,09
231,Very very good,"The hotel is located in a very good position close enough to temple bar and shopping areas. It was very clean, staff are very professional and happy to help. We booked breakfast and there was plenty of choice, something for everyone. Check in and check out was really quick and easy, key cards to use the lifts made you feel more secure. If you are late back in the evening the front doors are locked and you need to ring a bell, the doors are opened immediately so there’s no waiting about and there is also security on the door checking that you are real guests. 
All in all a great hotel which I would definitely recommend ",5,2017,11,08
231,A very nice hotel  :),"We are a middle-age couple and we were on our first visit to Ireland and Dublin. We stayed in Jurys Inn Parnel Street hotel for five nights and we were very satisfied with our stay. Everything worked fine, the location was excellent, no bothering noise from the traffic but still near to everything. You can easily walk to the other side of the river just in 10 minutes.  The hotel has really friendly and helpful staff and the breakfast was also ok. The king size bed was quite high so when I sat on it my feet did not get to the floor, but it did not matter :) We did sleep well anyhow, though we heard some noise from other visitors some time in the night when they came back from partying, but nothing to really complain about. ",5,2017,11,08
231,Nice stay,Hotel is nice. Location is close to the main shopping area. Easy to walk from hotel to many great spots. There is a Tesco right across the street. Bus to airport is a few steps away. Easy to get to from and to the airport.,4,2017,11,08
231," .","Very pleasant very clean premises. Staff were very welcoming and accommodating. On evening that our group visited while restaurant was busy it was not overly so. The dozen of us had varied dishes and there was not any complaints or any leftovers. We were from 19 to 86, so catered for all. While I wasn't staying at hotel some of the group were and they have been returning at least once a year for many years so that is recommendation in any language. ",5,2017,11,08
231,wonderful hotel,Friendly and helpful staff was just overall a wonderful stay thanks. Petra at reception was the women I was dealing with and she was just so helpful and very friendly couldn't do enough for me so thanks so much Petra. Will certainly be returning to jury inn for another stay.,5,2017,11,08
231,Dublin week-end,"The room is small, the general ventilation and heating system noisy and not effective. The airflow in bathroom insufficient and the ventilation poor. The whole system to access the public spaces and rooms cumbersome. ",2,2017,11,08
231,Good value!,"We had a good experience. The staff were very pleasant.
Reservation was easy and clear.
Theonly thing I would advise is to make lowering the room temperature possible.
Perhaps also have firmer mattresses.",5,2017,11,08
231,Nice hotel in Good location.,Stayed here for one night with family on our last night in Ireland.  The hotel is very nice and newly renovated/modern.  Rooms are very clean and spacious.  Washrooms also newly renovated and very clean.  In a very nice central area of Dublin.  My only complaint would be that the parking is several blocks away and difficult to find.  Otherwise we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again.,4,2017,11,08
231,Central Location for Dublin,"
We stayed here for a couple of days to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Hotel was spotless, staff wonderful, breakfast amazing! So much choice you were spoilt! Wi-Fi was excellent throughout the hotel... Our room was pleasant enough only downside was the bath! We had a room that was disabled friendly which meant the bath was so shallow, I tried a bath after a day of walking for 6 hours but it just wasn't deep enough to bath in. Other than that we had a great stay! ",5,2017,11,07
231,great central spot,"I stayed in Jury's on 5th November 2017, The room was situated on the 5th floor and was very clean tidy and good value for money.  Each room comes with tea/coffee making facilities and has it's own iron and ironing board. The hotel itself is situated just off O'Connell street and is central to all Dublin attractions and night life.",5,2017,11,07
231,Nice stay,"Jurys Inn Parnell Street have a great location. Within walking distance of most Everything in Dublin. The reception and restaurant were really nice. The rooms are fairly standand. I did not like the bed as it was fairly small and could have been more confortable. 
Staff at the hotel was absolutely brilliant. Always smiling and being really helpful. ",4,2017,11,06
231,Warm and cozy,"Upon arrival the staff was over and beyond accommodating.  They helped me with my luggage trolley to my room, even brought them into my room. The room was clean and nice, warm and cozy as well. The bed and pillows were like sleeping on a cloud.  Wi-Fi was excellent, food was good, and if in Dublin again I will choose this hotel ",5,2017,11,05
231,First jury's inn,This was our first hotel stay in a stretch of 3 weeks in Ireland and Scotland. We stayed at 3 different Jury's Inn on our trip. This one was in good location. Rooms are fairly large compared to other hotels and are kept very clean. Bed was ok but when staying in other Jury's Inn they had improved bedding with a very fluffy mattress pad which would have been an improvement. Bathrooms were of decent size and shower was nice and hot (something we had trouble with at other establishments). We did not eat at the hotel so can't speak to that. Overall reminds me of a chain American type hotel but is actually a positive when comparing it to other boutique style hotels. I would definitely stay again or recommend it to others.,4,2017,11,05
231,"Cool,Calm and Collected.......I was not, Jury's were","I rocked up to reception tired, confused and late after a long days work. I had gotten my reservation dates wrong. The staff members looking after me (Roslinda+Ciara) just took charge of the situation with great efficiency and professionalism rectified my mistake made contact with my booking agent and had me in a beautiful room in 10min and with her help my original mistake did not cost me financially. Thank you. The rooms are fresh and comfortable with great beds secure parking with in 3 minutes walk and located right in the heart of the city. You've good a fan in me.",4,2017,11,05
231,A courtesy long weekend ,"4 days with my family passed in a very nice hotel, in a large family room, clean and cozy, with the assistance of very kind and smiling personnel, whom assisted me to find a little bag lost by my doughter in a taxi, as if it was of them. Plentiful breakfast,  refilled very often, while I found dinner service slow, but maybe due to an unlucky event inside the kitchen, for which the waiter did apologize.",4,2017,11,04
231,Jury's in...at Jurys Inn,"Stayed here with my four sisters for a couple of days. Have to say, we were very impressed with the whole package. From check-in staff, to check-out staff and everything in between, it was a great stay. The staff were fabulous...friendly, professional,helpful....particularly Simon, the young barman in the hotel bar...an asset to any establishment. 
The bedroom was spotless and the bed was very comfortable.The hotel in general was spotless. Breakfast was excellent..plenty of choice and the hot food was as it's supposed to be...hot! We  also had dinner on one night and again, we could find no fault with any of it.
We were particularly impressed with the security aspect of the hotel..key access to the lifts/doors, toilets on the 2nd floor, so people can't just wander in from the street.
Location is excellent, right in the heart of the city., I can't comment on the parking situation, as we all chose to travel by train. 
Overall, we had a fabulous stay in Jurys. There was nothing we could find fault with. Well done to the management and staff. Can't wait to go back.",5,2017,11,04
231,Hotel great but no Parking nearby,"Parking is not near which is a problem when you arrive late at night, but everything else is walking distance which is great. Rich variety of breakfast and very friendly staff. Quiet rooms to inner court yard.",4,2017,11,03
231,"Nice location, High Price","190€ per BB night IS TOO MUCH in Standard 3 * Hotel. Not enough breakfast service in quality and number of Staff. Renovated furniture in room, otherwise too basic. Bath old, simple and Over build in paviment. That’s it.",3,2017,11,03
231,Dublin,"Lovely stay in this hotel, helpful reception staff, lovely room double bed plus bed settee, bed was very comfortable, very nice bathroom. Just a couple of minutes walk and you are on O'Connels st,great location. Would stay here again.",5,2017,11,02
231,"Great staff, and experience","Great greeting from staff on arrival, in particular Patrick the manager and a young man in training. Special mention to Macsimas in the bar aswell. Overall experience was over and beyond my expectation. Great choices for food both in bar and also for breakfast",5,2017,10,31
231,Great hotel,"The location is perfect, and the staff great. Clean, and they go above and beyond. Yes I across the street and very close to O’Connell and we walked all over town. Would stay here again. Definitely great",5,2017,10,31
231,Great location and hotel,Lovely hotel and room was nice and clean however the bath is tiny in these rooms and the cold water was a trickle compared to the hot water. Breakfast was great with a good selection of items available. ,4,2017,10,31
231,"nice, clean central hotel","Good central location.  Clean and fresh looking. Bit expensive for the room. Beds are orthopaedic so very firm.  Good selection of foods for breakfast, cooked full Irish as well as plenty of fresh fruit. ",4,2017,10,30
231,Marathon weekend stay....,Location perfect for reaching start line. I know couch bed is suited for children but feeling the springs coming up through sheets isn’t good enough for anyone. Went to restaurant for dinner after race and no joking it took 3 hours for us to complete our meal. We asked for kids ice cream and was told it would be an hour ... bang on an hour later it arrived.... not good enough...for €450 for weekend stay(b&b)very disappointing ...,3,2017,10,30
231,Great location for the sights!,"We had a great time in Dublin at the Jury's Inn. The staff were friendly and helpful from start to finish and the hotel room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was reasonably priced by Dublin standards but we found a nice bakery for breakfast round the corner. The stay had the shine taken off it slightly by some maintanance noises, drilling and hammering, although it seemed to start after 7am and end well before 9pm.
Overall a top hotel.",4,2017,10,30
231,Great hotel,"Great hotel that is located in the heart of the city centre and the staff are very friendly and welcoming, the restaurant is very good with a great choice of food, the staff are very friendly and welcoming and bend over backwards to help ",5,2017,10,30
231,Will stay again,"Good value for money, a great location and very helpful staff. I travelled on business and the hotel was a 10 minute walk to my office while being near shops and other facilities. It is also a few minutes walk to the bus stop for the airport bus.",5,2017,10,30
231,Good and tranquille place,Nice and basic. The hotel is in a good location in the former most poor part of Dublin. Now lively in a good way with many restaurants and pubs. Hotel in quiet location and sleep comfort very good. Breakfast is okay. ,4,2017,10,30
231,Good Hotel for a weekend break,"Stayed here with family for a long weekend holiday in Dublin. The location is fairly central, about 10-15 minutes walk from Temple Bar. You can get buses and the various hop on hop off tourist buses (which I would recommend) from O'Connell Street which is only a few minutes walk from the hotel.
The rooms at the Hotel were excellent, we had a family room with two double beds (0ne for our children) there were the usual facilities in the room and there was free Wi-Fi.
The Hotel Breakfast buffet was really good, great hot breakfast and a wide selection of cereals etc.
Hotel Bar actually had one of the cheaper pints of Guinness to be had in central Dublin and was fairly comfortable.
The staff were friendly and courteous and were happy to store our luggage as we arrived in the morning, before we could check in to our room.",4,2017,10,29
231,Great Hotel & Location,"Stayed from 25/27 Oct Room on 5th floor very spacious and clean, vending machine against lift also a comlimentary bowl of fruit. Breakfast self service and caters for all tastes. Staff excellent nothing to much trouble. Ideal location for O'Connell street & 10 min walk to temple bar.",5,2017,10,29
231,Great location,"This hotel is well located and less than 10 minutes walk from the main shopping area, the bars and main attractions. The hotel bar serves good food and if you're a business traveller it is fine for informal dinner and some work too. The hotel rooms are spacious and quite basic, again offering everything you'd need for a business trip.",4,2017,10,28
231,Nice hote and so close to the city centre,"We stayed in a triple room ( 3 adults) in 5th floor. The room was enough spacious, very clean and it seemed lately renovated. There is no fridge into the room but there is a vendor machine in the corridor of each floor. The staff was friendly. Unfortunately in our price wasn't included the breakfast so i have no opinion about it. But there are so many restaurants and pubs in the neighborhood so i really enjoyed the fact that i could taste different breakfasts each day. The hotel is only 5 minutes walk from the river, the temple bar and the trinity college.... everything is so close! Perfect choice for being in the heart of Dublin",4,2017,10,27
231,Quality Hotel,"Stayed at the Jury's Inn hotel for a long weekend (Thursday - Monday). The Hotel is in a great location, very handy for O' Connell Street and a 7 min walk to Temple Bar. The staff, both front of house and ancillary where extremely pleasant. Nothing was too much effort and you always got greeted, no matter what time of day it was. Room was spotless and well appointed. Colour TV, tea nad coffee making facilitys and the option of having food from the kitched delivered to your room. Only one tiny niggel and that was no room safe. There is however a safety deposit box in the lobby with a very secure system for access. Free wifi through out the hotel was the cherry on the cake. Across the road is a TESCO convenience store for all your last miniute needs. Breakfast was a help yourself type set up, with all the usual goodies on offer. Would I stay there again ? Absolutly with out question. Gfeat vale, great location, great staff and you where made to feel very welcome.",5,2017,10,25
231,Very enjoyable stay,Hotel was very clean and comfortable with very little noise from outside. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location was perfect for the centre of Dublin with shopping restaurants and tour buses.,5,2017,10,25
231,Great Hotel,"3 night break with family, stayed in this hotel, really helpful and friendly staff.. Room was very nice, big and spotlessly clean. Not our 1st time staying here would highly recommend it.. Great location... Food was lovely too..",5,2017,10,25
231,Fab Hotel,"Great hotel and a good location. Friendly and efficient staff on reception. There was no problem leaving suitcases until our room was ready as we arrived mid-morning. Our room was clean and modern with everything you need for a weekend stay. There was a hairdryer and an iron in the room and soap and body wash in the bathroom (which smelt gorgeous!). Breakfast was plentiful with us not having anything else to eat until well into the afternoon.  We found 8.30am a good time to go as started getting busier around 9am.  We had to move room on our last night as there was a leak of some a few doors up but we just had to move around the corner so wasn't much of a hassle and we were given vouchers for some free drinks for our trouble. As we were already out with our friends in the city when I got the phonecall asking us to move rooms, we didn't get them used as we wanted to re-join them as quickly as we could but as a G&T cost €9.60 in the hotel bar they wouldve gone in handy had we had the time to use them - we were leaving the following morning. All in all a fab hotel and I would definitely recommend a stay here. ",5,2017,10,25
231,Brilliant location - a wee gem!,"Stayed for my daughters 18th birthday treat.  I was apprehensive booking a budget hotel but it was real value for money in a central location which felt really safe to walk around in the evening time. Just 7 minutes walk down o,connell street to bus station and temple bar area. Parnells next door is good for food, drinks and live music with very friendly service and reasonable too! Jurys inn staff are professional, friendly and make a large budget hotel feel homely. Breakfast well presented in lovely setting with plenty of choice on offer. Tesco and lidl across the road for bits and pieces and vending machines in hotel lobby for snacks and drinks. Better than expected and would definitely book again.",4,2017,10,23
231,Satisfied stay,Excellent location and friendly staff with great service. Great value for money. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. Secure at all times. Nice touch having residents bar secure. Bar had good atmosphere.,5,2017,10,23
231,Truly enjoyable experience,"It's not often that I visit a hotel and am excited to go back to the room.  Usually, I am more excited to enjoy the surrounding areas than the hotel itself.  But this hotel was truly something I looked forward to returning to.  From the delicious iced tea in the lobby to the comfortable room and fantastic amenities, I cannot wait to return.  I work as a travel agent part time, and cannot wait to start sending clients here asap!",5,2017,10,23
231,all good - great location,"clean - breakfast is excellent - room service is expensive and best to avoid. Bar is good too. location is good, access to buses and light rail. ice available 24/7 and the restrooms are super nice and clean",5,2017,10,23
231,Perfect City travel experience,"Thanks to a very friendly service team we immediately received additional towels for our son. We booked a three person room. Daily room service was in time and in quality. Excellent breakfast and very friendly staff member at reception desk. Perfect stay with around the corner distance to city centre.
",5,2017,10,23
231,"Good location, shame about the work next door.","Stayed Friday 20th October on the 2nd floor. The hotel is convenient for shopping and within a 20 minute walk of the station and temple bar area.
The hotel itself is very nice, on check in the receptionist made us aware that there would be some building work and this would be until 6pm and start again at 10am, we would be out all day/night anyway. Unfortunately we were woke up at 8am! The builders were drilling and shouting ''wakey wakey!''. The hotel did apologise they did have an agreement to start at 10am. I don't feel it was the fault of the hotel but disappointing as we paid a considerable amount for 1 night. ",3,2017,10,23
231,Well done,"Central Hotel for a visit of Dublin. Good Service, nice rooms, good breakfast. Everything was fine. Only a few minutes for a walk to the main shopping places, Temple bar or other importent places. We have had a nice time there.",5,2017,10,19
231,"Enjoyable, but one or two details lets it down.","We picked this Hotel because of the location for a quick visit. Problem one, Ophelia decided to visit as well. All of Ireland closed down, not just Dublin. The menu was severely curtailed & nowhere else was open, eating became a problem. The Monday was a write off. Breakfast on the Tuesday was fine, apart from what meant to be hot, wasn't. that might have been a one-off as Tuesday's was hot. The room was excellent. I don't know if all rooms were equipped for those with mobility problems but bars to help with getting in and out of the bath and toilet were something we have not come across before, ditto the red light which i assumed would light if there was a fire alarm, giving a signal to those guests with hearing problems.
 I have to thank Petra on the front desk, she was immense help on arrival. Many thanks.
I suppose the acid test would be, would we go back? Certainly, the location is great.",4,2017,10,18
231,Verdict: Proven excellent,"Stayed here for 6 nights. 
Great hotel. 
We booked a 'superior' room which had a very comfy king bed. 
Breakfast is excellent.
Situated on the edge of the main Dublin shops, and only minutes walk to major stores and dining. There are a couple of supermarkets within metres of the hotel.
Staff more than helpful and accommodating.
Clean, quiet, professional.. cannot be faulted.",5,2017,10,18
231,Wallis Europe Trip,"A great location with staff that care. Beds were great, and very clean. Awesome. Loved the fresh fruit that you could help yourself to and the hotel layout was great to so we didn't get that corridor or rooms above noise...Thanks",5,2017,10,18
231,Great value for money,"Easy to find in a good location for all local attractions. 
Nice clean spacious rooms with very comfortable beds.
Well presented buffet breakfast and although the restaurant is quite large and was very busy it was easy to get anything you wanted. There was a very good choice.",4,2017,10,17
231,"Excellent location, modern and clean hotel. On the expensive side.","Stayed at the hotel for a trip to Dublin with my wife. Settled on the Jurys inn due to being close to town, but far enough away to be quiet. 
Check-in process was quick and easy and the room was very spacious. The hotel was very clean and modern and staff were very friendly.

Cost of hotel was on the expensive side, but seemed around standard price for Dublin.

I would not hesitate to stay here again.",4,2017,10,17
231,A great place to stay!,"Everyone at this hotel was service minded, friendly and helpful.  We returned for our second year, and look forward to returning next year.  You cannot go wrong staying here - rooms were quiet, breakfast was excellent!!!
And location is everything - walking distance to all the attractions.",5,2017,10,17
231,Dublin,"Amazing city, I 'll surely come back again. Dubliners are very friendly and I'm going to go  throughout Ireland because I want to discover Irish Landscape. You can visit Dublin even walking around. Really a lovely city!",5,2017,10,16
231,Great hotel in the center of everything!,"Stayed here overnight recently prior to a business function where we were meeting around the corner at the Gresham Hotel.  That hotel didn't have availability and found Jury's Inn was around the corner from where I needed to be.  It was a nice hotel and the staff was very friendly.  The room was pretty small & think it was the smallest shower I'd ever been in.  It was fine for 1 night but don't think I would've liked to stay here more than a few days tops.  It was definitely in a very central location and loved that the shops, bars and tourist attractions were easy to reach from here out the door.  I arrived early after an overnight flight from the US and while they didn't have a room available for me at the time, they were able to pre-check me in and keep my luggage while I went out to tour.  Good value for the $.",5,2017,10,16
231,Great spot,"Jury's Inn Parnell street was a very clean,comfortable  pleasant staff and a good location to walk to spots when touring. A full tasty breakfast was provided as well as a grab and go bag for some early morning side trips we went on. ",5,2017,10,16
231,Very friendly staff and comfortable beds,We stayed here with our daughters aged 1 and 4. The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. The room is clean and the beds were incredibly comfortable. We'll definitely come back here next time we're in Dublin. ,5,2017,10,16
231,Good in all aspects ,Stayed here for 2 nights as part of the organized tour. Everything seems good. It’s quite a modern building. Location is central with only 1 minute’s walk to O’Connell Street and the shopping street. Room is small but clean and tidy. Well it’s probably not small compared to those in Hong Kong. Service is pleasant. Restaurant offers a good variety of breakfast menu. Overall I’m quite happy with it.,5,2017,10,16
231,Great Location & Great Staff,We had a very pleasant stay at Jurys.  The hotel was very clean .  The staff was very nice and very patient in answering our questions.  Jurys' location is great and everything in Dublin is within walking distance from the hotel.  ,5,2017,10,16
231,Great choice in Dublin,Great choice in Dublin. Within walking distance of everything and public transit. Very clean and quiet rooms. Restaurants and grocery stores on the same block. Breakfast buffet has a great selection..,5,2017,10,16
231,Great 5 Night Stay,"Great hotel if you're a tourist.  Right around the corner from the AirLink bus from the airport.  Walking distance to ALL major tourist must sees.  Grocery store right across the street. 
Very well maintained hotel.  Coffee maker and hair dryer in the room. Easy check in and check out.  using the key card in the elevator was somewhat of nuisance, but did provide an extra sense of security.  Great maid service.  Clean and tidy room.  We purchased breakfast the night before and saved 1 euro each.  ($10.oo euro when purchased the day before)  Nice amount of variety on the buffet to get well fed and off for the day.  Located around the corner is a coffee shop...Esquire...great place for a scone and coffee if looking for something lighter.
I would totally recommend this hotel for a budget minded traveler.  Great location. Would absolutely stay again if I were to return to Dublin",5,2017,10,16
231,Noreen Keane,"We had a nurse reunion  after 40.years and stayed in jury's inn Parnell Street.
Bed and breakfast and evening meal excellent. Staff in all areas very friendly & helpful and made our stay enjoyable by been so helpful to our group of 22 ladies. October 14 th 2017 .Would highly recommend this venue so central to every place in the city.

231,Central Dublin accomodation,"Group of eight in four rooms. Check-in, bar, restaurant and checkout experiences all very good. Despite air-con, didn't manage to sleep too well, and it wasn't the Guinness. Quite happy to stay here again.",4,2017,10,16
231,"Clean, comfortable & convenient.","Spent a single night in this hotel as part of a short visit to Dublin.  The hotel is modern, clean and the rooms were very comfortable and quiet and have all the usual facilities.  Staff we helpful and efficient and the breakfast was fine.  Only a twenty minute walk from the main train station and convenient to the Temple Bar area, Vicar St. theatre and Grafton Street and with many bars & restaurants nearby by - suited our needs perfectly. ",4,2017,10,16
231,Jury's Inn Dublin,"E. Steele- My husband  and I have stayed here in Dublin, Cork and Belfast, and have always found the hotels to be clean, and comfortable, but your staff are outstanding - courteous, welcoming, helpful, and efficient.",4,2017,10,13
231,Nice for a city hotel.,"This is a nice,  basic hotel. Nothing fancy. The room was clean and the shower was hot. I would also say the room is larger than your standard city room,  came with an ironing board and hair dryer. The staff were friendly and when we arrived early (before check-in) and asked if we could leave our bags with them,  they told us we could check in early if we wanted to. It was fantastic. 

The location has some pros and cons. Pros being: Its next to a pedestrian shopping area (Mary St.) and shopping mall. There are Vodafone and Three mobile stores there if you need a sim for your mobile phone. There is a market across the street for things you forgot and snacks, etc. Another pro is that it is a short walk from the Airlink Bus stop (the express bus from the airport) to the hotel(About 5 minutes). The cons are: Its adjacent to O'Connell St. Which is pretty seedy at night. My wife and walked back to our hotel up O'Connell one night after hitting the pubs on the south side of the river and there were a lot of scary characters around. After that we either took an Uber back to the hotel or walked a few blocks to the west from O'Connell. The other slight downside to the location is that it is north of the river with means you have a 10-15 minute walk to get to were most of the sites/ pubs/ restaurants are. Not too long of a walk but, if its pouring, it can be. An Uber back from Saint Stephens Green is about 15 euro.

We did not eat breakfast at the hotel and instead went out to one of the local cafes. There are many cafes in the area of the mall but be advised that they have weird hours. Most of them do not open until after 9AM. There is one that opens at 8 however. I have never seen Cafes that open so late before.

In General,  this hotel is a great value. If you can afford another 40 bucks a night,  I would probably look at a place south of the river. Jury's Inn has a propery over there too and it looks to be in a pretty good spot.",4,2017,10,12
231,Value for money,"Great location north of the river next to the mall. The hotel was very clean and modern. The staff were very helpful and friendly with complementary maps of the city and reccomendations for food, transport and tours. We had a double room with a queen bed and single bed. Room had a tv, aircon/heating, bath and safe. The bar was open until 1:30am everynight. We didnt have breakfast included but it would have been an extra $9 euros per person. There was also extra security on the door past midnight which meant we had to give our names on entry when staying out late. Would stay here again. ",5,2017,10,11
231,Great spot to stay in Dublin!,Overall great location and very friendly staff. Breakfast buffet was the best we have seen in a long time...Huge selection and very tasty food! Front desk staff went above and beyond to help make our stay a great one. We are very happy with Jurys Inn and would surely stay there again!,5,2017,10,11
231,Well located.,"Not a fancy hotel, but well located. Sad colors inside, rather obsolete. Breakfast choice is not very extensive for light appetite. Hot food (beans, fried ham, fried eggs) is not what I'm looking for in the morning.",3,2017,10,11
231,North side of Liffey,A little off the beaten path as far as sights but was very close to the lovely City museum of Dublin - The Hugh Lane.  Greatly enjoyed that and we could walk.  Hotel did a good job providing services.  They are very busy but seem to move the process along in a good fashion and you don't feel like you are standing in line at all.  We did take a taxi though to the Irish Museum of Contemporary Art.  The grounds alone are worth visiting.  The exhibitions were ...modern!  We ate Irish food and Spanish tapas.  both were good.,4,2017,10,10
231,Jurys Inn  - Great Hotel in a Great Location,"This is a great hotel in an ideal location at the top of O'connell Street.  Great location for easy transport links for airport buses and the hop on and hop off buses.  Close to shops and all necessary amenities.  We checked in early and left baggage and felt they were secure and checked in and out.
Coming in (very) late at night we were met at the door and our IDs verified before being allowed entry.  This was done in a very friendly way and made you feel valued and that security was paramount.",5,2017,10,10
231,"Good location, nice rooms",Very central location. Just 1 Minute to ILAC Shopping Center and around 10 to O'Connell Bridge by foot. Clean bed- and bathrooms. Size of the room for a city hotel is perfect. Nice staff. Nice breakfast set up as buffet. Perfect for a city trip. ,5,2017,10,10
231,Highly recommend,"This hotel is excellent value for the Euro. Service from the front desk arrival thru to check out is superb. Meals in the restaurant are tasty and very nicely presented. We recommend sharing as the portions are generous. Breakfast is full Irish and more, getting one fuelled for the day. Rooms are newly updated, clean and very well appointed. All in all one of our best hotel experiences abroad.",5,2017,10,09
231,Grainne,"I stay in this hotel every time I visit Dublin and requested a disabled room that I stayed in before but was given one miles away from the lift to which I struggled with , the room itself was lovely just too far a walk for me. I asked to be moved but the hotel was full , the duty manager gave me a free breakfast voucher ! That was lovely ... if I had stayed longer I deffo would have had to change to the room I requested in the first place 324..... ",3,2017,10,09
231,Dublin Trip,"First visit to Ireland and loved it. Our hotel was in a very good location for us to get around.Hope on and off bus great experience. Did a lot of walking and had comfortable shoes.  Our Guiness Tour was great and tasted our first one and will have again.  Went into 2 pubs and a very different experience and one with a lively musician .   Enjoyed 2 shopping centres, one at end of Grafton Street and the other on Henry Street.",5,2017,10,09
231,Nice hotel but whatch out for room 243.,"The hotel was friendly and in a good location for all the hop on hop off busses. Unfortunately, I have no idea why they would put a bedroom over a  supermarket loading bay? The noise started at midnight till nearly one in the morning and then again at four forty five and again at five thirty, not what you expect from Jurys Inn. Our room was 243 and the noise was reported to the front desk who did offer to move us but I cannot believe no one else has ever complained.",4,2017,10,09
231,Concert weekend,"Great weekend away at Jurys,the staff were very good as always and the food was beautiful.great location to local amenities and public transport.we always stay here when we come to Dublin  as it ticks all the boxes for us ",5,2017,10,09

231,Fabulous experience,"We originally booked into the Beresford Hotel but we had such a terrible experience there we just left and managed to book into the Jury's Inn, we had stayed here a long time ago and liked it. It was worth paying more, much better location, staff who do their job well and make you feel very welcome and good rooms and bar.",5,2017,10,09
231,"Lovely hotel, perfectly located, excellent breakfast","Comfortable well appointed room. Plentiful and delicious breakfast. Location is great- just steps from transportation, shopping and sights. Friendly reception, easy check in/check out. Would highly recommend.",5,2017,10,08
231,Spent three nights; lovely hotel; friendly staff,"We spent three (3) nights here, after the Jurys Inn Christchurch (where we had booked) had no rooms available for us. The hotel is comfortable and clean; hotel staff were friendly & very helpful. The breakfast was average; lots of choices, but when busy they would run out of items and were a little slow at replenishing. The dinner we had on our first night (free due to the room issue) was excellent. Would I stay here again ? No, but only because I won't book another stay at a Jurys Inn property. I can recommend the restaurant right across the street, Kingfisher. Some of the best fish & chips I've had.",4,2017,10,08
231,Happy days,"I had a very-very good overall experience at Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street this September (2017) and I recommend it to all who want to visit Dublin. A bit too expensive... Nevertheless, the least expensive among the hotels located at the heart of Dublin...",4,2017,10,07
231,Gem in the City,"Last minute booked into this hotel on a whim because it was available and not overly expensive. Turned out to be a real gem! 
Perfect location to just about everything and taxis right outside the door that can take you everywhere. I got to the airport in a taxi for 15 euro. Super friendly staff, which must be the Jury's Inn way....I got lost and went to the wrong location and they were so sweet in guiding me to the proper location and even called to ensure my reservation went through. 
Room was well equipped and comfy. I go to Dublin all the time and will stay again!

P.S. Try Mr. Donut next door to the hotel...wonderful people working in there with donuts you'd never imagine!",5,2017,10,07
231,Great hotel lovely staff,"Great hotel in prime location the service was outstanding nothing was too much to trouble and the beds are so comfy great night sleep, lovely bar area for a few drinks, very secure need access card for lifts sorta leading to our room as well as bedroom door felt very safe and secure recommend to anyone ",5,2017,10,07
231,Great location.,"Newly refurbished hotel that could not be more centrally located, just a few minutes walk from O'Connel street.
A reasonable sized room, double glazing made for a very quiet night. Air conditioning but no safe or fridge, but ice machines located on each floor. A supermarket across the road, and a large bar/restaurant area on the 2nd floor. The hotel has a gym.",4,2017,10,07
231,"Decent hotel, close to everything","Hotel was clean, room was nice. We only stayed here one night but it was close to everything. There was a Tesco and a Centra right near by which is always nice for snacks. It was a short walk to Temple Bar.
Breakfast served at the hotel was delicious. Lots of selection. In addition to traditional Irish breakfast foods there was also a lot of fruit and they also had mini smoothies.
I also used the gym facilities which were decent. They offer an exercise bike, a treadmill, and elliptical machine. They also had some weights.",4,2017,10,06
231,Comfortable but noisy rooms,"Great Hotel, amazing location but our rooms were overlooking a council depot that was working at night and a loading bay for a local supermarket that were having deliveries at night, Refuse room 243 unless you sleep very soundly.",4,2017,10,06
231,Nice central hotel with friendly staff,"Stayed here whilst I was on a training course in the city. The hotel is a short 15 minute walk from the river and the Temple Bar area. There are lots of restaurants, transport links, and shops in the surrounding area. Sad to say that there were a fair few homeless around too, but that’s a sign of the times.

The hotel itself is comfortable, but lacks amenities like a gym, etc. The WiFi was very good and the bar was one of the nicer hotel bars I’ve seen. The food was reasonable for bar fare too. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was varied, but nothing special.

I’d stay again.",4,2017,10,05
231,Nice comfortable hotel,"We arrived early 5:30am from an overnight flight from the US.  The hotel was booked due to a championship football game between Dublin and Mayo county so we had to wait around for a room. We knew check in was later in the day but we were exhausted from being up all night.  We took a short walk and rested in the lobby.  The receptionist told us we'd get the first room that was cleaned and offered us a complimentary breakfast in the restaurant, which we gladly accepted. We were given a room  couple of hours later.  The staff was exceptionally friendly during the entire stay.  The location was excellent and in walking distance to most everything we wanted to see.  Breakfast was included in our rate and the full Irish breakfast was good and the restaurant was nicely maintained. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",4,2017,10,04

[Our travel agent at Burati Travel in Springfield, MA gets the credit]. We only had about 24 hours to see Dublin, and with Jury's Inn, we maximized every minute.",5,2017,10,03
231,Nice Stay,Good find in the city of Dublin. Well situated. Within walking distance to the main areas for sightseeing. Friendly staff. Clean rooms. Bar area was relaxing. I would recommend this as a place to stay for your trip. ,4,2017,10,03
231,Location was perfect,"Everything was excellent from booking in. Secure area to leave cases with tab control.
Room was a good size, clean. Had a great night sleep. Staff very helpful and professional.

Kingfisher a cross the road serves the best full Irish  breakfast at a reasonable price.",5,2017,10,03
231,Best breakfast in town,"Really conveniently placed, comfortable, friendly - and serving truly excellent breakfast : what more could you ask of a hotel to stay in while visiting this fascinating and welcoming city ? The room was not overlarge, but very well provided. Good shower (but very shallow bath !) ; friendly bar service, with very wide range of Irish whiskeys. We'l be back when we have a chance !",5,2017,10,03
231,Great Eight Day Stay,"From check in to check out eight days later we had a very nice time at this hotel.  The room was a quiet interior room, the breakfast was the best we had in two weeks in Ireland and the room was fine.  What more can you say, central Dublin and a quiet room.  Thanks to all the other reviewers who recommended the stay and gave advice on the best rooms, it worked for us.  And more important thanks to the front desk, the cleaning staff and the new chef, the breakfast was great.",5,2017,10,02
231,Jury's Dublin,"Great hotel location, clean rooms and excellent breakfast buffet. Staff was helpful with tourist map and taxi service. The bar area was nice, drinks were expensive. Key cards were required to get to any area of the hotel which made for a safe feeling during my stay.
",4,2017,10,02
231,Nice hotel,"We didn't use the hotel for anything other than just sleeping .. it was clean, comfortable and all staff including reception and house keeping was polite and helpful. The hotel is a short walk from the bus stop (747 to O'Connell St. €12 return from airport). The hotel is close to lots of shops and a reasonable walk to river. The hotel it self was quite (apart from noise of people coming and going). Key cards are needed for the lifts and toilets.",4,2017,10,02
231,Perfect Location,"The location on Parnell Street was perfect for all the key places to visit as well as easy access to shops and places to eat.  Worth skipping Temple Bar for a night to have a meal in The Church,  the food and the atmosphere was great.",5,2017,10,02
231,Great Hotel!!!,"Room:  Clean/comfy beds/Quiet/good hair dryer
Staff:  VERY friendly/helpful
Breakfast:  Good
Location:  Great/walking distance of pretty much everything!!
One thing I especially liked....We had to use our room key to enter the lift & used them once again inside to get to our room level.  I felt very safe staying there.
WE WOULD CHOOSE THIS HOTEL AGAIN!!!",5,2017,10,02
231,Great hotel,"The Jurys Inn is located in the city center, very close to all the interresting places in Dublin. Staff is friendly, helpful. Breakfast was just tasty, room lovely and clean, bathroom was not really in best shape, but clean. We liked it.",4,2017,10,01
231,Perfect ,"I stayed for one night on business. It was perfect. Fast and friendly check in with a free upgrade. Delicious meal and wine, very comfortable room and all spotless. Location perfect for city centre. Will definitely stay again. Thank you.",5,2017,09,30
231,Less then stellar,"This facility was extremely generic, the carpets in the hallways made rolling luggage challenging, there was no designated concierge service so if one needed tourist advice you had to wait on the check-in line - only to discover that the front desk staff  could only give the more basic of information.

While the bedroom size was sufficient, the bathroom was awkward. Whatever soaps were offered were in a holder attached to the wall, there was no bathrobe or slippers, the tub/shower was ill fitted to its space - so that every time one moved you could here the floor creaking below you. Additionally there is no in room safe. If you wish to store items like passports or jewelry in a secure location you are required to trudge down to the lobby with said items - on display - and house them in a collective lobby safe.  I found this practice to be an inconvenient and a time wasting situation. 

While the room was tidied on a regular basis, it was a hit or miss situation as to whether or not coffee items were replaced, or if dirty dishes were taken away, and those dishes that were meant to stay in the room seem only to have been given a rinse in the bathroom sink. 

The breakfast was pretty much the standard issue ""Irish"" affair - scrambled or poached eggs, tomatoe, sausage, puddings, breads, and cereals......all of which was kept vaguely warm, but suffered from being dried out and unappetizing in presentation.

Everything about my stay was simply functional -  there were no discounts, free upgrades, free amenities, or any other benefits that would in anyway indicate to me that I was being treated exceptionally. Rather I booked a room and I paid for a room......and that was all I received - a room.

 It would appear to me that the only benefit to being a rewards member is that I am now on their mailing list, but it is fair to also say that being treated better while staying at the hotel would be a better benefit then realizing benefits that simply do not exist. And if in someway what I experienced was being treated better, then I pity the poor soul that walks in to this hotel and isn't one of their  members.",2,2017,09,30
231,Dublin city centre,"A good central hotel for Dublin, the entrance is nice and so is the bar and restaurant, Accommodation prices are some of the dearest I have paid anywhere and American visitors will be disappointed unless they can get a good deal. Bar prices are comparable with other outlets. The rooms and corridors and in need of a face lift and the bathrooms are very dated. Beds are comfortable but the TV coverage was very poor, very limited channels. Tea and coffee supplied in the room. My room was particularly cold and the thermostat seemed to have a mind of its own.  ",3,2017,09,29
231,Visit to Dublin,"High standards throughout the hotel. Comfortable accommodation in pleasant surroundings. Friendly, welcoming staff in Reception area and helpful staff in restaurant. Good location for exploring Dublin.",5,2017,09,27
231,So convenient to the centre of Dublin,"We stayed as a party of three and the room was clean, comfortable and modern. The breakfast was delicious, especially the fried roesmary potatoes - an unusual choice but very welcome!  The bar was fairly priced with a galss of house wine only 5 euros.  The evening meal was a bit pricey but very nice and tasty.  This hotel is very close to all that Dublin has to offer and has a Tesco directly opposite if you need supplies.  Staff very friendly and accomodating to guests.  ",5,2017,09,27
231,Fun back in Ireland 1st Dublin,"Everything worked out Great for US !!!!! all facets of Jury's Inn  was fabulous!!!! you name it staff was great and helpful !!!! room was terrific, Location right by O'Connell Street Perfect!!! Breakfast excellent nice variety!!!!",5,2017,09,26
231,Incredible beds.,"I had a very positive experience staying in this particular Jury's Inn. The staff were friendly & the hotel had a lovely, warm atmosphere. It's located in the heart of Dublin, a ten minute walk to Temple Bar & a five minute walk to O'Connell Street. The beds are ridiculously comfortable & for that reason I will definitely be back & recommending this hotel to family & friends.",5,2017,09,26
231,Business,A very good hotel in centrum with a very nice and friendly staff. There were very helpfull the whole stay and I felt very good of staying in Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street Hotel. I have only good things to say.,5,2017,09,25
231,Clean hotel with easy access to Henry street.,"Lovely clean hotel,we ate in restaurant as we were late booking our room and the food was A1.we went out and returned at 10ish where browsing menu on table,the chap behind bar informed us that kitchen was closed but we saw people ordering pizzas etc after we had sat down,he obviously didn't realise we were residents and was to brusque in his manner.There was a waiter there called Kieran and he never stopped all night and hope this establishment realise how hard he works .we did not eat breakfast as it was very noisy ,but just round corner we discovered a lovely little cafe called Anne's and the breakfast was delicious.We recommend this hotel as what it lacks in one way it more then makes up in others.😄",4,2017,09,24
231,Where is the Car Park,"When I checked into the hotel,I asked the receptionist where there discounted car park was situated,he wasn't sure but gave me an address in Marlborough Street.The GPS took me through an entrance to Marlborough Street which was not accessible for cars.I then telephoned the hotel and was told that the entrance to the hotel was in Cathal  Brugha Street,this involved another 10 minute drive around Dublins one way system to enter the car park.
After a long tiring drive the last thing you want is conflicting directions in a busy city centre.
Why don't the hotel make sure there reception staff know the directions to the car park and that the entrance is not in the street they tell you.
Very poor and frustrating.
Phillip Ford",2,2017,09,23
231,Super friendly staff and a great location to catch Airlink Bus!,"When we arrived at Jury's Inn, Parnell Street, we were kindly greeted by the reception staff, who was very friendly and made us fell very welcome. The receptionist kindly upgraded us to a executive suite which was very much appreciated!! The room was very clean and the hotel is in a great location to catch the Airport bus (747), which was around the corner. The room we had faced Parnell St (which we didn't mind), you could barely hear the noise outside - the windows must be soundproof!? Very happy with our stay and would recommend to anyone to stay there. :-) 

If management read this then please tell the receptionist thank you from the Irish and Aussie couple that were travelling to Croatia early the next morning...she was very friendly, professional and very accommodating! :-)",5,2017,09,23
231,The perfect place to stay,"Beautiful Hotel - Perfect Location - Beautiful food - Really nice and friendly Bar - Spotless Clean every where - Lovely Staff.
And the price is absolutely fine too - 
p.s lovely there was soap. shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom (for me it was a bit strong- it could be a more natural brand perhaps) ",5,2017,09,22
231,Great location,"This hotel is just a couple blocks from river and close to the center of town, which was an easy walk. Staff is very friendly, though very busy. There wasn't a dedicated concierge to answer tourism questions though staff at front desk, when available, were very helpful.  Rooms very clean and of good size. A wonderful breakfast was available for 11 euros. There was also a nice bar and dinner available. A grocery store is directly across the street. We had a street front room with great view of street. I would certainly stay there again.",5,2017,09,22
231,Very Central modern hotel,"The hotel is conveniently situated in Dublin to visit all the tourist attractions which are all within walking distance.
Hotel has a modern feel rooms are very nice. the staff at reception are very helpful.
Breakfast was excellent and was a good start to the day.
Only downside, if you arrive by car parking is a problem. We found parking close by for 15 euros/day.",4,2017,09,21
231,Very Good!,"Although we could not check in until 2PM the staff gladly took our bags so we could start touring about the city. After we checked in we found the room to be clean, modern and very well equipped.After we freshened up we went back out on the town for dinner and drinks. Came back to the Jurrys and had a nightcap at the 2nd floor bar. Nice and quiet. Breakfast the next morning was very fresh and plentiful. Highly recommend this hotel, just around the corner from O'Connell St where most bus and tram services are available.",5,2017,09,21
231,A good stay,"Good location, 10 min walk to Temple Bar area. Also a supermarket, Tesco, is just across the street. 

The room is clean but they don't have any USB plugs. If you are traveling form a 2 pins plugs country you'll have to bring your own adapters, the hotel doesn't supply them. 

Breakfast it's ok as long as you are not into fried eggs, witch are extinct from plates.",4,2017,09,21
231,Great time in the heart of Dublin,"There is a saying that not the place makes a person special but the person makes the place special. Therefore I BIG thanks to all the staff. You made our days (every day) really awesome since the early morning :)! So friendly, caring and helpful! A small talk every morning makes a day special :) And special thanks to Liz :) She is great, amazing person with a lovely smile and useful tips for the day (where to go, what to see, etc.). Thanks ALL the personnel of the hotel for a wonderful time there! We look forward to seeing you soon again :)",5,2017,09,21
231,Just an average hotel,"While there wasn't anything particularly wrong with the property, it was average - not outstanding, not poor.  Breakfast was very good with plenty of options; the room was decently clean.  For the price, it just seemed not to be the greatest value.",3,2017,09,19
231,we have a wedding in mullingar and travel around in the countryside,"This hotel is a very comfortable hotel in a central location, confortable room, nice people, the breakfast was fantastic.
The attendants Natalie, Erika, Sasha, Aiofe, Liz anda karolina vere very nice.",5,2017,09,19
231,Great hotel,"Well situated close to the centre, nice accomodation, friendly staff, good food. The only inconvenient was the lack of own parking space. The hotel is very clean and has a nice feel to it. I would definitely go back there. ",5,2017,09,19
231,Performance.,"Overall the hotel was clean and the people were excellent - let me point out Clive, Avadoa and Mia.  There service at the from desk was excellent from the time we visit until the time we left.  If we choose to come back this will the hotel we stay at.  ",5,2017,09,19
231,Spot on!,"Great location , everything was just as expected. We stayed 4 nights here and i found the location excellent as it was my first time to Dublin so i wanted somewhere in the thick of it, with Temple bar a 15 min walk away and all the endless bars and eateries close by you can't help but indulge!
The staff were very friendly and helpful , i really nice polite atmosphere.Our room was very tidy and comfortable, Breakfast everything you'd expect with no faults, the hotel bar we found great too!

If you're a first timer to Dublin like i was this hotel ticks all the boxes , great location , with very easy access to the main attractions - the Guinness storehouse is a 30 min walk but so easy in a taxi as was the Zoo which i both recommend! 
I can't wait to return to Dublin and i won't think twice about coming back to this Jury inn.",5,2017,09,18
231,Wonderful stay!,We stayed here for three nights as part of a long weekend treat to ourselves. Check in was very easy and the member of staff polite and friendly. We made our way to room 209 and found this to be spacious and well maintained. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and the bathroom spacious. There was a good running shower. Breakfast was my favourite part of our stay. You could have virtually anything you wanted! The porridge was some of the best I have had. Drinks prices in the bar were also reasonable. Loved the touch of an ice machine on each level too! Would definitely stay again.,5,2017,09,18
231,Great Hotel in Central Location,We stayed two nights initially then another night on our return. This hotel is a very comfortable hotel in a central location. All the staff were extremely helpful and efficient. The breakfast was fantastic.,5,2017,09,15
231,Consistently good standard,"Everything you would expect from a Jurys Inn in a city centre. The staff are always welcoming and efficient, we were slightly disappointed our room looked out onto a brick wall which as we were there for three nights and had booked some months in advance we thought they could have avoided but I guess that's life in the city for you.",4,2017,09,13
231,In our opinion a great spot,"Two rooms, two nights. Very good location not to far from Temple Bar and close to eateries, bus tourers. The staff we met at reception and at breakfast were super great and fun 11 out of 10 . Reasonable rates for the location. Breakfast, normal Jury's good. Room and bed clean tidy and comfortable. Lovely staff lovely stay thank you.",5,2017,09,13

231,Superb,"Very clean. Great central location absolutely no noise, huge comfortable bed with x2 comfy pillows all meant a fab nights sleep. Didn't have to touch public transport we walked everywhere. Transfer from airport approx 10 mins, 24 euros in a taxi or 6euros on the bus (aircoach direct- picked up on o Connell st). Clean bathroom- provided with miniature toiletries replaced each day, clean towels provided every day, hair dryer provided. We did not have breakfast in the hotel as we felt it was pricey, but that's just because of our budget. Overall a fantastic hotel for a couples city break! ",5,2017,09,11
231,Enjoyable short break in Dublin,We had a very pleasant stay at the Parnell Street Dublin Jurys Inn. Close to shopping centre and most buses yet quiet area. Hotel was very comfortable and clean. Buffet breakfast was good though short on sweets such as cakes.,4,2017,09,11
231,Very Good Hotel - Close to City Center - Quiet & Comfortable,"I stayed here for 4 nights beginning July 11, 2017.  From the Dublin airport I took a bus/shuttle to the center of Dublin.  My iphone GPS lead me wrong, but I finally found the hotel and it is in a great location.  It's close to the city center, yet right around a corner so that you don't get all the noise.  Across the street is a market, so it's easy to get any pharmacy supplies, snacks, water or soda that you might need.  I was warmly greeted by the staff and was given a room on the 2nd floor.  The bar and restaurant were just down the hall, but I could not hear a thing from my room, which overlooked the street and market across the street.  The bed was comfortable and I felt very safe and secure.  

I tried the bar and it was nice.  Not too pricey.  I had breakfast at the hotel a couple of times and it was very good.  A buffet which has all the normal items you want while traveling in Europe.  

Overall, my stay was very satisfactory.  Upon returning to Dublin, I will definitely stay here again!",4,2017,09,11
231,Central Location,"A nice hotel in a great central location.

Our room was located on the third floor of the hotel, once in the room it was quiet to both the outside world and other people on our corridor.  It had built in air conditioning which came in useful when the weather got a little bit warm.  The room itself had a spacious bathroom, TV, iron and tea/coffee facilities, the beds were comfy and the room was very clean.

The hotel is located thirty seconds from O'Connell Street (Upper) and a ten minute walk from the River Liffey which can lead you to Temple Bar across the bridges or along to the dockland.

The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and our room was cleaned daily with a newspaper delivered each morning.

Well worth a stay!",5,2017,09,10
231,Good location and service,"The hotel is located in a quiet but central location in Dublin.
The room is clean and equipped very well. The bed is ok and the only negative thing I have to say is the system of the elevators that you need to use your room key, many of the times it was confusing and frustrating.",4,2017,09,10
231,Vacation in Ireland:),"Jury's in has a perfect central location and our room overlooked Christ Church:) We were more than happy with jury's inn, and very happy with the extremely helpful front desk staff!!! No matter what we asked (directions, perfect pub for Irish music, best Italian restaurant, even where to buy a stamp) all the staff answered smiling and gave us great advice!  We will return!!!
",5,2017,09,09
231,"Good Location, needs to plan a bit better.","We stayed just two nights in Dublin at the Jury's Inn and we picked it because of the location.  It is RIGHT on the Hop On, Hop Off bus line, which is perfect.  It's a short walk to most major attractions.

We let them know WEEKS in advance that we were arriving VERY early in the morning.  Apparently this isn't a new thing, as I was told by a flight attendant that many international flights arrive early morning.  We had asked that they try to 1) Have our two rooms close together and 2) have 1 room ready as soon as possible as we have 3 kids who would be exhausted.  It would have been a plus to have a room ready but they said probably by 10am.  That's a bit of touring and breakfast from our arrival.

Come noon...  my kids were asleep in the lobby still waiting for a room.

Again... it was a request, we know they couldn't guarantee it.  Still, it would have been nice.

The rooms are clean, quiet and simple.  Beds were comfortable enough.

Breakfast was pretty good...  busy.  Nothing special, but priced well.

It was a good stay...  the location is great, the people were nice and the rooms were clean.",4,2017,09,08
231,Central Location,"We booked the hotel at short notice as we were attending a family event, but wanted to extend our stay. The hotel is close to O'Connell Street, and the main shopping centre in Dublin but it is in a less than 4-star location. Dublin itself is a fairly small city, so most tourist spots are in walking distance. We walked to the Guinness Storehouse and Kilmainham Gaol. Buses are frequent and cheap if walking is not your thing. In fact, if you are visiting Dublin, don't bother to hire a car.

The hotel is modern, in a residential rather than tourist area, but the site is significant in Ireland's history. The view from the rear overlooks the surrender site from the 1916 rebellion, unfortunately the downside to the hotel is that the rooms to the rear overlook the civic rubbish amenity, which is located behind those facades of history.

The hotel staff were pleasant and helpful. We arrived before 11am, so put our baggage in storage and found a pub, returning several hours later to check in to our room. The room was the quietest we've experienced, the beds soft but comfortable, breakfast was a buffet which was well stocked. You should not have a problem getting seated if you arrive before 9am. We stayed five nights and ate dinner in the restaurant twice, and visited the bar for a night cap every night before retiring. Food is available after the restaurant is closed, either as room service or from the bar which is open until 1.30am.

Check-out was a relaxed 12pm.

As previously mentioned, the location is a little 'rough', not a problem however and unless you are a guest of the hotel, you cannot access any area of the hotel other than reception and the 2nd floor (bar area). Make note that the room card operates the lift. Room safe is not necessary for this reason.

Dublin is undergoing a major regeneration programme, which includes installing new tram lines, so there is a lot of building going on. Don't let it put you off, it's business as usual! The craic is alive and kicking.",4,2017,09,07
231,Location perfect,"We enjoyed our stay in the Jurys Inn Hotel very much, because the staff was very friendly and the Location is just perfect. In a few minutes you can reach a lot of hot spots. Jameson is about a 10 minutes walk away from the Hotel.
",5,2017,09,07
231,Warm and friendly,I stayed here with my two daughters for a short break and I had a wonderful time. The hotel was comfortable with a great restaurant and I cannot praise the breakfast highly enough. We found the staff extremely helpful and the hotel is very well placed for being near to all bus stops---we used the Hop On service which was great as well! Will certainly return to do the things we couldn't fit in.,5,2017,09,07
231,"Dublin, Jurys Inn","The rooms were small but very clean and tidy, the staff were friendly, the location is great for getting around the local area and easy for taxis or buses for any tours you need to do.

Hop on Hop off bus tours can be booked at the hotel and the bus will stop close by for pick up and drop off.

I would stay there again.",4,2017,09,06
231,Loved the Jury's Inn Parnell,I was very pleased with this hotel. Staff are friendly and helpful. Was able to check in upon arrival around noon. Grocery store across the street was handy. Bus stop for Airline around the corner. Breakfast was included in our reservation and was a buffet. I will stay here again on my next visit to this wonderful city.,5,2017,09,05
231,No issues,"We stayed for 2 nights in Dublin @ the Parnell St. Before hand we were concerned about getting into Dublin before 2pm (check in time). I emailed them via Trip Advisor and they responded very quickly, w/ in hours saying that they would let us store our bags until we could check in, which is what we did. It is a card access storage room in the lobby- I had no concern. They also allowed us to store our bags after we checked out for a few hours, which was helpful, as we were not done seeing the city. Two things that we were not aware of from booking through Trip Advisor, was that Jury's Inn would have moved our check in time to 12 noon for an extra 20 euros. If you are traveling and getting into the city early and would like to take a quick nap or shower before heading out to see the sites, that could be money well spent. The second thing is breakfast was included- a pleasant surprise, as it was a fairly decent buffet, and offered some a la carte items for a relatively small fee. 
The location was perfect for us to walk to most of the things we wanted to see and do. We did have a car, we parked about 4 blocks away at Clery's Q-Park. They have an agreement and the hotel will validate the parking ticket so you pay 10 euro for 24 hours. I felt that was well worth it. If we make it back to Dublin in the future, I would stay at Jury's Inn Parnell St w/o hesitating.",4,2017,09,05
231,Holiday in Dublin,"We had 4 nights in Jurys Inn Parnell. The staff was very helpful (especialy the reception) with suggestions to good restaurants, which we followed!
We needed some ""fresh air"" after bathing. And some more place for clothes.",5,2017,09,05
231,Great choice,"Car park in walking distance. GPO is only footsteps away.  Lovely, modern hotel. Beds are very comfortable. Only 15 pounds for taxi ride to Guinness Storehouse or ""K"" jail.  Short walk to pubs and Liffey River.",5,2017,09,04
231,A very relaxed stay,"Excellent position,10 min walking to the city centre and Temple Bar, just in front one of the best 100 restaurant in Dublin, very close to the shopping center and pubs. Good breakfast for every taste, very clean room and toilet and kind and helpfull reception. Missing a fridge but doesnt matter as i putted the water outside de window and it was like in the fridge. Well, thank you very much to all the staff! I couldnt ask more! ",5,2017,09,04
231,Excellent Location for a City Trip,The Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street is a good starting point for a City trip. It is in an appropriate walking distance from most attractions and there is also a starting point for the hop-on-hop-off bus. Rooms are nice and breakfast is also good.,4,2017,09,04
231,Jury's in Parnell Street,"Lovely hotel but would stay a little closer to the centre next time .. all staff very friendly apart from one who never smiled (think she is in 
the wrong job, customer services 
not very good at all) .. rooms & bathroom clean and breakfast lovely ",5,2017,09,04
231,"Overall , a good stay !","We toured the whole of Ireland in late July and overall, Dublin was the most expensive city in Ireland.
Jurys inn on Parnell Street is usually cheaper than its chain inn opposite Christchurch,
We liked the location--near many eateries but not so near bars which could be very noisy.
There are buses and airport coaches that stop nearby, and it's about 10-15 minutes' walk to Temple Bar area. Tesco is just across the street so you can get other drinks if you cannot take so much guinness!
 If you are driving, there's a parking lot about 10-15 minutes' walk from the hotel and you can have a reduced rate (10 euros/day) by getting a stamp from the hotel reception. But we thought it was too far so we parked at a nearby parking area for 15 euros overnight.
We stayed in family rooms which are actually double rooms with an extra single bed, making the room a bit squashed for 3 adults. The double room is reasonably spacious if occupied by 2 adults. Overall, the room and bathroom are very clean and well kept, even though the decor is a bit dated. Bed linens are fresh and mattresses are medium firm.
Our room faced the inner courtyard, and with double glazed windows, it was nice and quiet for a good night's sleep.
No comment on the breakfast because we left early the next day,
Checking out was fast and easy and the reception staffs always had a smile for the guests.
We were satisfied with our stay and I have already recommended to my friend who will be staying here in September!",4,2017,09,02
231,Wonderful stay.,"Had a great three day stay. Staff were wonderful, room was very clean and great night sleep. Only downer was that we paid for breakfast, had my Autistic child with me and when we arrived in the morning, there were no tables and a long wait. I mentioned to the member of staff and she showed complete indifference to me. ",4,2017,09,02
231,Very good,"Great room, very comfortable, cleanliness could be a little bit better, but overall it was good. Staff very friendly. Very good breakfast. Great location, near everything. Would definitely go back again. ",5,2017,09,02
231,Great location ,This hotel is in a great location. The Airlink (airport transportation bus) was right around the corner. It's also within walking distance from everything. The breakfast was also great. There is a great restaurant called Maury's which serves authentic Irish cuisine and it's only one block away. ,4,2017,09,01
231,Really nice place,"This is a really good place to base a visit to Dublin - shame the actual part of Dublin that it is in is a bit dreadful. Hotel staff were attentive and knowledgeable, didn't need to bother them much. Room was really lovely, nice and comfortable, but view was rubbish. Beds comfy, breakfasts - more than you could possibly want, and they cook to order if your particular eggs aren't on display! Nice bar in the evening which seems to serve food until late. 
Area though was rather shabby - Dublin seems to be undergoing a bit of a renovation at the moment and buildings are closed / quite run down in places. Lots are being pulled down, roads and pavements are being dug up. Area seemed quite deprived. 5 minutes down the road and around the corner it was completely different and utterly brilliant. Walked everywhere. 
Point to note: When booking this hotel it stated that car parking was chargeable - it didn't say that that parking is a 5 minute walk up the road and in the opposite direction to the one you are facing. When we stayed there lots of roads were one way or closed due to roadworks which made navigating a bit difficult - just something to bear in mind. The Guinness makes up for it though :-)",5,2017,08,30
231,The best hotel in Dublin,"The hotel is perfect, comfortable and clean. Rooms are excellents with comfortable beds. You will sleep as a child. The staff is really nice and helpful.
The hotel is well located.  High quality in general.
I will come back.",5,2017,08,30
231,Nice clean hotel but needs a few improvements.,"Just came back from a few days in Dublin.
We stayed in this hotel as we knew it was right in the city centre. 
The hotel itself is very clean and the rooms are nice, with your basic facilities such as coffee/tea making facilities, an iron and a hair dryer. 
The only real complaint we had was that the walls in the rooms are so thin that we were kept awake all night with the people in the next room talking. Its the first hotel we have stayed in that you could hear the people next door as if they are in the same room. 
The hotel isnt very cheap to stay in but if your looking for something close to the city centre i would recommend this hotel. ",3,2017,08,30
231,Family,"Very small rooms. Room was not ready for the children. No adapters. Waiting for the breakfast table. Children not allowed at the bar (we wanted to play cards there). No citymaps, instead the tip to go to the tourist information. Parking place is outsourced. ",2,2017,08,30
231,Weekend ,"This hotel is well situated in heart of Dublin. The beds were very comfortable and room nice and clean. Nice bar good lifts .on the whole we were very satisfied.we also found the staff friendly,can recommend.would come again.",4,2017,08,30
231,Family Vacation,"Had a great time on our two family vacation.  stayed 2-3 nights in Dublin (one family left a day early).  was a little pricey compared to other hotels.  Would stay again if could get cheaper.  Mia at front desk did great job.  Alex at front/valet went above and beyond. Hotel is very centrally located, breakfast was good.  Bar was great - hit it up everyday before we went out. Very centrally located and close to McConnel Street transport area. room keys were very touchy and had to be reset a lot.  Room keys were needed to go anywhere in the elevator and even to the bathroom where restaurant and bar were. I Guess it was a safety issue but I would think you could get into the bathroom without one if you were on that second floor.",4,2017,08,29
231,Nice Hotel,"Nice, clean hotel within walking distance of shopping, restaurants and many points of interest. Hop On Hop Off buses also within a short walk. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. Enjoyed our stay. ",4,2017,08,29
231,Our home away from home,"This is our second tome staying at this hotel. We had a wonderful room, very clean, bright and  decorated beautifully. I think it was called an executive room. Everything you need is there, including a coffee maker, selection of teas, bottled water, refrigerator with pop and chocolate bars. Inside. They also have tasty packaged cookies, daily fresh milk etc. Beds are great it's lovely bedding. Both the restaurant and bar are very comfortable and the staff is fabulous. You're also close to shopping, tourist sites etc.",5,2017,08,29
231,Looking for a good stay? You just found it!,"If you're looking for a good hotel, just book at the Jurys Inn on Parnell Street, where Anna, Chrissie and colleagues including security staff are giving you are warm welcome.
This is my regular stay for over 8 years and my 2nd home and always be welcomed back and recognised as guest.

If for whatever you experience a situation, go immediately to the front desk and the staff is more than willing to solve any kind of problems.

Just enjoy your stay as I do for so many years now and hopefully more in future.

Business trip or holiday, you should always enjoy your stay.

Just book at Jurys Inn!

",4,2017,08,29
231,Don't bother staying here,Compared to other Jurys Inns this was very basic and poor value for money. No help offered with luggage and staff misdirected us to parking and argued about it afterwards when we told them they had sent us to the wrong place. Overall very poor.,1,2017,08,29
231,Perfect location in the heart if Dublin,"Very nice hotel within walking distance of the main attractions, the shopping area and nightlife. 
Nice spacious rooms and quiet despite central area.
Only thing: if you are considering having breakfast there (which was good and worth having) make sure you pre-order/pay the night before as they irritatingly charge 1 euro extra if you pay in the morning.",4,2017,08,29
231,Nice experience,"Great location and nice staff. Rooms are confortable but noisy. Breakfast, really good. However, 180 euro for a single room is a bit overprized for the overall room standard . The varr best: the beds and if you get a room in the 5 floor towars the gate you get a nice view over Dublin.",4,2017,08,28
231,Lovely stay!!!,"Couldn't recommend this hotel enough!! Lovely, friendly and helpful staff! Very clean hotel! Food was lovely! Bed was comfy as well! Central for everything and had easy access for the hop on hop off bus! Made you feel at home! Definitely stay here again in a heartbeat!!!!! ",5,2017,08,24
231,Jury's Inn Dublin,"The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The room was spacious and clean. The bed wa comfortable. They offered to hold our luggage if our room was not ready.
The only negative about the hotel is the parking. The parking garage is a few blocks away. We were lucky when we arrived, after getting lost, that there was a parking spot in front so we could drop off our luggage, find the garage and walk back to the hotel. Not easy to do after a very long night and day!  
Overall, I would recommend this hotel as long as you are a good walker!",4,2017,08,23
231,Fleeting visit,"Stayed only 1 night at Jurys Inn in June when we literally flew in and out for Aerosmith concert in June.
Arrived very early for check in, but Reception checked us in swiftly with paper work, relieved us of luggage,so we were off to enjoy the 24 hours we had in Dublin, so we only  had to pick up keycards later in day. 
Hotel room and bathroom was good size, and all very clean.
All of our  party agreed next morning the buffet breakfast was the best we had ever had. Irish hospitality at its best!
Excellent stay, we return again for longer next time.",4,2017,08,23
231,Perfect,"Fantastic central location.  Great rooms, very spacious and clean.  Staff were all very helpful! Very comfortable all round.  All rooms very well equipped with hairdryer, iron & ironing board etc.  Beds were very comfortable. ",5,2017,08,22
231,Jurys Inn breakfast voucher little problem.,"As usual we had an excellent stay in Jurys Inn Dublin. The staff were very friendly,efficient and most helpful especially in the bar area. However we had a little problem at our checkout. The receptionist was quite adamant that we still had to pay for four breakfasts when in fact we had given in four breakfast vouchers as part of the Jurys Reward scheme. After an embarrassing delay we finally sorted this problem. I must finish by saying that I will certainly return to this excellent hotel.",4,2017,08,22
231,Excellent Location,"The first room we were put in was overlooking some sort of factory and was a little noisy, so we asked if there was a different room available and we got moved no problem.
The staff were very friendly",4,2017,08,22
231,Good choice,Booked this hotel for a one night stay before leaving for the airport. It was centrally located in town and close to a lot of shopping and food services. Staff were friendly and supportive and the room was clean and comfortable. ,5,2017,08,21
231,Great Location,We stayed here one night and enjoyed our stay.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The location was perfect.  It was easy to get to everything in the city and close to lots of great bars and restaurants.,5,2017,08,20
231,Great hotel! ,"Stayed in this hotel over the weekend, was extremely clean and the bed was massive. When we went to check in we were given free coffee vouchers and 10% off the bar/restaurant. 
There was very high security as you were not allowed up to the rooms if you didn't have a room card. The staff at reception were very friendly and willing to help. The floors had vending machines, apples and ice dispensers which you were able to use and the paper was delivered to your room in the morning. 
However the only let down was the breakfast as the food was cold and there wasn't a great variety of cooked breakfast. Despite the breakfast I would stay again! ",4,2017,08,20
231,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed here and all I can say is wow! The staff were amazing, so friendly and nothing was too much trouble, all done with a smile. Where the hotel is situated you are in walking distance of everything! The bar was lovely. Great atmosphere! The bedroom was gorgeous, the bed was the best bed ever. I have never slept so well!!! Finally the breakfast... All I can say is WOW! I have stayed in Dublin numerous times and I have never seen a spread like this, the quality, quantity, diversity was unbelievable! This will be the only hotel for me in Dublin now! Would never stay anywhere else!",5,2017,08,18
231,Excellent value,"Good management shines through in this place - from the helpful checkin person to the efficient cleaning. The location is outstanding. Breakfast was just ok, and we didn't try the bar or restaurant because there are excellent choices nearby. But the bed was divine, the shower was terrific and the view was good. I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend. ",4,2017,08,18
231,Ok but premier inn do it better for less!,Comfortable stay but requests for triple room ignored and not enough towels etc for number of people. Characterless hotel which is such a shame in the centre of a vibrant city like Dublin! Great location and great bar staff but otherwise a bit disappointing for the cost. ,3,2017,08,17
231,Great central location for a city break,"Great location - got the bus from the airport and the hotel was a 2 minute walk from the bus stop.
Walking distance to Temple Bar and other tourist attractions.
Had a family room for 4 and there was adequate room with 2 double beds.
Breakfast was excellent- lots of choice.",5,2017,08,16
231,A well located base for exploring Dublin. (Wait until the new tramlines are completed).,"The bad piece first is that there is no parking at the hotel. You have to drive to a public parking facility. This was worse than normal as there are roadworks underway on every street at the moment and traffic was dreadful. Accomodations were fine, staff were friendly and helpful lounge bar was very nice spot to relax. Breakfast at restaurant across the street was a good bargain.",4,2017,08,16
231,Great hotel,"Had a fantastic stay at Jury's Inn on Parnell Street. Staff were lovely nothing was to much trouble and very polite and helpful. Location also great for Dublin sightseeing, restaurants  theaters and bars. Thanks Patrick for a fantastic stay we would both highly recommend your hotel without hesitation. x",5,2017,08,16
231,Family trip,"Average rooms, clean, not spacious but nice area to hang clothes with ironing board and iron. The phone was kind of gross(just older) but other than that clean. Bar and restaurant very nice, staff very friendly. My sister did not have a good experience with her family room, it was on 2nd floor where the staff enter/exit a work area, very loud and the toilet VERY loud, shouldn't be used as a guest room. They did not have another family room for them to switch during our stay. ",4,2017,08,16
231,"Jury's Inn, Parnell Street, Dublin","Hotel was clean, modern, quiet and accessible to sites, such as Temple Bar, Trinity College, and Nassau Street. A Tesco shopping market is just across the street. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. It was also within walking distance to a pickup point of a tour to Northern Ireland we took. For 10 euros, an excellent buffet breakfast is available. The one downside was that there was no safe in our room.",5,2017,08,15
231,Great spot,"If you're looking for a handy , easy access location , you found it ! Walking distance to Temple Bar , O'Connell street is just around the corner ... hotel clean , fresh fruits 🍉 everywhere, loved the bar area.. clean and quiet.. reception staff very helpful .",4,2017,08,14
231,Central Dublin Hotel,Our family found hotel noisy with building work starting at 7.15 am.  Breakfast was so busy I had to wait around for eggs and bacon. Could not get coffee machine to work. But maybe this was because height of season and very crowded for breakfast time. But hotel staff were very nice and helpful and hotel is very central.,2,2017,08,14
231,Pleasure trip,"First time visit for me in Dublin stayed at Jurys inn met all our needs front desk staff could not be faulted our room was clean and plenty of towels available the bed was amazingly comfortable especially after the sight seeing and bar crawling we did! Breakfast was self service and plenty to choose from.
My partner and I would certainly stay there again.",5,2017,08,14
231,"Not bad, but probably would not stay here again","First the positives:
+ Great Front Desk staff.  I had a problem with a leaky toliet and they took care of it promptly.  
+ The room was a good size as was the bathroom which included a large shower.  Also the a/c worked well.  
+ And although it is on the North side of the river and not considered the best area, I always felt safe and secure. 

The negative:
- We were on the 2nd floor and they were doing construction on the floors above us and started drilling at around 7:30 am -- I woke up dreaming that I was in a dentist chair getting my teeth drilled on :(",3,2017,08,13
231,Jurys Inn Dublin,Location Good.  Room met all of our needs.  Able to leave bags safely to enjoy last day in Dublin.  Room as expected for a large hotel.  Carpet could do with a thorough clean as very stained but we were not in room long enough for it to bother us.  Tea and coffee making facilities - perhaps more milk as only enough for 2 drinks.  Shower fine.  Staff helpful in every way needed.,4,2017,08,13
231,Great Hotel,"Lovely clean hotel, Great location. Plenty of bars/restaurants nearby. Only a 5 minute walk to Temple bar. Stops for the hop on/off buses close by. Didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on the restaurant. ",5,2017,08,12
231,Weekend in Dublin ,The location of the hotel is really good. Lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance. The hotel is really clean and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The breakfast is good too. Our double room was very clean and we enjoyed our stay. We did the Guinness tour and the Green hop on hop off bus tour. Both were very good. The live commentary bus is best. Had a great weekend. ,4,2017,08,11
231,Nice place and staff but parking is awful ,"We stayed here 2 nights on our trip.  The hotel is quite a distance from many of the attractions and the parking is a 5 minute walk and then to get back to pick up luggage with all the crazy traffic is awful.  I would have rather stayed somewhere closer to Trinity Area so you can at least see some places without get on the crazy bus.  The hotel is clean and the staff is nice the breakfast is good but I'd pay a little more and stay closer to the sites next time.  
",3,2017,08,11
231,Great place to stay,"Just went to this hotel recently and it was superb. Reasonably priced (€30/day to upgrade), polite staff and accommodating. The location is ideal for Graffton street and general shopping. Guinness storehouse a decent walk but on a lovely day, fabulous - taking in the views. There are 2 Jurys inn that we know so this is Parnell street. Breakfast amazing and they said they would accommodate for caeliac (asked for my daughter). Could not fault this hotel.",5,2017,08,10
231,Fantastic Hotel,"We were a party of 3. The room was large enough to fit 3 people comfortably. The beds were extremely comfortable. Very clean hotel room. The breakfast was great with plenty of choices. The staff are exceptional people. Extremely pleasant, nice, personable, friendly and helpful. The lobby is very nice. If you need to leave hotel before 7 am, if you tell someone at the front desk the night before, a sandwich, drink and cookie will be given to you on that morning that you need to leave early. Connell St is 1 block away and Henry St is only a few blocks away. You can take a tram on Abbey St. to get to the Jameson and Guiness Breweries. Temple Bar area is about a 20 minute walk, but suggest taking a taxi back to the hotel. There is a taxi stand in the Temple Bar area. Grifton St is also about a 20 minute walk. We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and recommend it highly.",5,2017,08,09
231,Wonderful experience!,"What a wonderful hotel this is, as a young couple we were impressed on all levels! The breakfast was lovely - all you can eat! The beds were soo cosy and spacious! Thus, the location was central! Will 100% be back in the near future. ",5,2017,08,09
231,"Very central, clean and safe","The rooms are a good size, clean and quiet.  Very close to the hop on, hop off busses.  The hotel has a nice restaurant and there are cafes and pubs close by.  The shopping district is a short walk away.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.   There are no fridges in the room nor safes, but safety deposit boxes are available at reception.  Vending machines are on each floor as well as ice dispensers.  The beds are very comfortable.  A great place to stay.",4,2017,08,09
231,Exceeded expectations,"A great place to stay.  Upgraded to one of the executive rooms on the 4th floor which overlooked Parnell Street.
Ideal location for walking to all the sights of interest.
Friendly staff.  
Breakfast somewhat over priced at €11 but a good selection available.  
A little disappointed with the dinner menu as my first choice was not available. But, the food was of good quality.  
Overall a really nice hotel, I would visit again.",4,2017,08,09
231,ok stay,"The first night we stayed we had room on the top floor and I was a returning customer (4th stay) I thought great no noise.  Boy was I disappointed, we were placed at a corner and the elevator was on the otherside.  We heard a constant mechanic turn everytime lift started and stopped and it was constant the whole night.  Thankfully next morning the staff moved us no problems.  Most of the staff were very friendly especaily the bar staff :D Tho each day we were there  the same 4 reception staff we had dealings with all 4, 3 were friendly, polite and helpful and the other, well, there is a difference between been professional and polite than being snooby and arrogant.

Rooms were reasonably clean.  Size not so good.  When I stayed before you had a room with double bed and sofa (or made up sofa bed if needed) which made the room seem big.  This time there was a double and single bed, totally unnecesary and made the room feel tiny.

I was a little unsecure about the location this time as there always seemed to be trouble on Upper O'Connell St when you were walking home in the evening.",3,2017,08,08
231,Great hotel in city centre,"Really enjoyed the stay and breakfast was super, close to the hustle and bustle of Moore street and lovely fish and chip restaurant just across the street, as well as a Tesco supermarket. Cinema just around the corner!",5,2017,08,08
231,3 nights in Dublin,We stayed at Jury Inn for 3 nights with friends. Great location with very helpful and effecient staff. Our room was clean and comfortable and amazingly quiet. Breakfast was varied and worked well. The room key system ensured security extended to lifts and toilets. Free ice and newspapers was welcome too. ,4,2017,08,07
231,Weekend with friends,Enjoyed our stay. Lovely breakfast.plenty of choice ....room had everything you need and very comfortable. Couldnt hear any noise either from other guests or from outside. Would stay here again. And definately recommend it to friends. ,4,2017,08,07
231,Dublin stay,"Extremely freindly staff and very welcoming hotel was lovely clean and in a pretty central location 
Breakfast was absolutely lovely something for everyone. 
Staff extremely helpful.
We got a taxi from airport cost about €22 also on a bus route 
Easy to find there are great bars and restaurants across the main road Murrays bar and restaurant is a must 
",5,2017,08,07
231,FRIENDLY AND EFFICIENT,"Superb stay, all the guys in the bar so friendly and chatty, would have rated 5 stars but for the noise from adjoining room, highly recommended for business travellers and close to all amenities. will be back.",4,2017,08,07
231,"Wonderful hotel, great location, room size totally inadequate, get down early for breakfast","We stayed one night, which I appreciate was a Saturday during a busy period.  The hotel is beautiful, clean and welcoming and in a fantastic location  The staff were courteous and helpful.  However, the 'superior' family room we booked was overpriced and a totally inadequate size.  For 2 adults and 2 children, we had one double bed and one sofa bed, one armchair and absolutely no other space in the room.  Also, be warned that breakfast is cleared away very fast.  We arrived at 10:20 (breakfast ends at 10:30).  There was a limited supply of some items and no bread for toasting, despite being requested. I took cereal, fruit and coffee, then went to get some hot items but they had already been cleared away.  Had I realised how fast the clearing up would be done, I would have taken hot food and let it go cold as I ate my cereal.  I would use the hotel again but would request a much larger room to accommodate a family.",3,2017,08,07
231,Short break!,Fantastic stay in the jury's Inn.  Definitely recommend for family's service was excellent.  Staff are always pleasent and more than happy to help with inquiry's.  Can't wait to come back. Hotel was spotless and rooms are great value for money. ,5,2017,08,07
231,Irish Hospitality at affordable prices,"Jury's Inn is located within short distance to O'Connell Street and Parnell Square. It's close to many shopping venues including an open air farmers' market, several grocery stores, numerous restaurants and several theaters and casinos. The hotel is also with walking distance to several bus routes including the 747 route to the Dublin airport. 
The hotel itself is clean and has all the amenities one would need. The staff is pleasant and super eager to please. Service was superb.
Drawbacks include a for pay breakfast buffet which was only fair.
The coffee maker did not work and the scrambled eggs were lukewarm.
Secondly the front of the hotel needs to be more welcoming.",4,2017,08,07
231,Exceeded expectations!,"My friend and I took this trip to celebrate 18th & 21st birthdays with our daughters on 28/07/17 .None of us had been to Dublin before but hope to return! The hotel was in a great location and breakfast was a fantastic start to the day , fuelling our sightseeing perfectly!",5,2017,08,07
231,Poor quality and very expensive,"Tired decor, charmless hotel with few redeeming features. Tiny rooms with no view and horrible atmosphere. Felt like an airport. Price was really too much for what you get. Would never return and cannot recommend this to anyone. ",1,2017,08,07
231,Good location,"Lovely hotel off the Main Street yet only a 10 minute walk to the Temple Bar area. There is everything you need in your room, a kettle with mugs and a good supply of tea and coffee, hairdryer and even an iron and ironing board. The rooms are very spacious with nice comfy beds . We didn't have the breakfast as for someone who only has a slice of toast I thought 11 euros was a bit much, there are plenty of places to get a good breakfast  within walking distance from 6 euros . Was very impressed with the security as you had to swipe your room card to get in and out of the lift and corridors. All in all an excellent location to explore Dublin.",5,2017,08,05
231,Great location ,"Great location in Dublin city center. The room itself is an average 3 stars, a bit outdated but clean. Breakfast was great and staff was friendly. Considering the price and location, it's a very good deal if you are visiting Dublin. ",4,2017,08,05
231,would book again,"see title, no complaints whatsoever. Temple Bar is in walking distance and just around the corner are Bus Stops for those who prefer them to walking. Only downside: can be quite loud at night due to being at a busy street.",5,2017,08,04
231,"Good location, comfy bed, no parking even though it's advertised, wouldn't stay again","Good location, beds very comfy, only a kettle in room, tv had 2 working channels, advertises with parking no parking attached or near hotel 10 min drive to car park and longer walk back €10 for 24hr. Misleading info!!!! Extra bed in our room took up most space, very over priced!!!",3,2017,08,04
231,"Better than expected, should be 4 star","After travelling around Europe we expected a city hotel to have small rooms especially when this is rated 3 stars. What a shock, this hotel is terrific value for money. The room we had was large and clean, the staff are fantastic and helpful, the restaurant/breakfast is great. Wifi worked well. Great location. Hop on hop off bus just around corner.",5,2017,08,04
231,We visited Dublin,"We only slept one night and every things were perfect. We visited Guinness factory where we tasted very good dark beer, Trinity College with a very beautiful and enormous library,  St. Patrick's Cathedral and we walked by Dublin.",5,2017,08,03
231,Great hotel and location,"My wife and I stayed here on bus tour at start of trip. This hotel was a great choice. Location is outstanding, just off of O'Connell Street, lots of shopping, pubs, eateries, all easy to walk to. 

Rooms were very good, excellent air con, wifi and very clean. Beds and pillows very comfortable. The breakfast in hotel was included in our room, was one of the best we've had in all of Europe. They have an excellent bar as well, good choices on tap. 

We'd stay here again, great choice when touring Dublin!!!!",5,2017,08,03
231,Very comfortable hotel with friendly service! ,"Petra helped us at the front desk when we arrived. She was super pleasant, professional and friendly. We chatted as she checked us in and after she gave us a map. She explained the lay out of the city and gave us many helpful recommendations. Our room was clean, quiet and very comfortable. I really appreciate a strong A/C unit and this hotel has got it. They also have an ice machine... yeah you read that correctly... an ice machine for guests.... in Europe! We also enjoyed the complimentary fruit bowl by the elevator. Another added bonus: the cleaning staff hung a large bag of fresh towels on our door because we left our do not disturb sign on all day. This place is a class act! Superb location as well! ",5,2017,08,02
231,"Pleasant staff, beware of noise ","The hotel is conveniently located near the shops and bars or within a short walking distance, the staff were very pleasant and helpful. The main reasoning for the 4 star rating is the construction noise on the adjacent shopping centre which woke myself and my friends each morning when there was a loud drilling noise, we were moved to the 5th floor but this still continued however a member of staff gave us complimentary breakfasts on our last day. The rooms themselves are comfortable and the staff when realising it was my friends 30th Birthday gave us a complimentary tray of snacks which was a nice touch. ",4,2017,08,02
231,Seen better days,"First on the location, which I didn't think was best for business and the area is not the best of Dublin in my view. It felt quite rough.

Service was good but not extraordinary.

Room was of good size and had an iron, which is always good when heading to a meeting the next day. The room had seen better days and was bit run down but no major complaints.

We didn't eat at the hotel but their bar was a good place to stop before heading back to the room.",3,2017,08,02
231,"Nice, neat place to stay","Friendly reception, nice neat room for 2 adults and 2 children. Very helpful front desk. The breakfast was excellent. Our Dinner experience was exceptionally excellent - the menu had plenty of choices, tasty food and moderately priced. Restaurant was quiet and a cozy place to sit and talk over dinner ",5,2017,08,01
231,Excellent place to stay in Dublin,"In a very central location, not far from O'Connell Street. You can walk to the GPO Museum and the Hop on - Hop off buses depart just opposite it. The airbus from the airport also has a stop nearby. Easy to walk to the river and bars. Good size rooms, décor just as you would expect from Jurys. What made this an exceptional stay was the breakfast. An excellent choice on the buffet and the hot food was kept fresh - it was as good a breakfast as I've had in many more expensive hotels. At the moment there are serious road works going on in Dublin and there are some just outside the hotel. There is only a small pull in / drop off area outside. I left the car in a nearby shopping centre until I found the hotel and checked in. They will give you directions to a nearby car park and validate your ticket for a discount.",5,2017,08,01
231,Family pre Christmas getaway!,"Dublin is a beautiful place but even more so during the Christmas holidays. We have stayed at jury's inn Parnell street the year before and was impressed by the friendliness of the staff and the warm homely atmosphere so we decided to return but with breakfast included this time. 
Breakfast was amazing. Plenty of choice for fussy eaters just like my youngest son. 
Will be coming back again for Christmas 2017",5,2017,08,01
231,Jurys Parnell St Dublin--family visit,"Staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel clean and well maintained. Excellent central location in Dublin. Only issue we had was around parking. We had booked stay on-line, it indicated parking available but when we arrived this not so, we could disembark at the hotel as it had traffic pulled in. We ended up going further down road to large city centre car park. When we enquired around parking facilities at the hotel they informed us that they had a discounted deal with nearby car park--Cleary's Q Park. We then had to move car to it albeit we had to pay other car park fees for time spent within it. It would have been very useful to have known this prior to arrival.",5,2017,07,31
231,"1st Time, But not the Last !!","We Booked 3 rooms here, total 10 quests for 2 nights, first time in a jurys inn, rooms very clean, everywhere was very clean, Breakfast was the best yet, staff very friendly, would highly recommend.  We got a bus from the airport, drop off was 5 min walk from Hotel.",5,2017,07,30
231,"Nice location, good hotel","Located in the center of town, this hotelis ideal for a visit to Dublin. We stayed for three nights in an up-to-date room on the 5th floor.
The staff was friendly and very helpful. The man in the lobby went up and down the street to help us catch a cab, when we were in a hurry. At the frontdesk they helped us printing copies of tickets.
Great breakfast with lots of choises. 
We will stay there another time.

231,helpful staff,"We weren't even staying at the Jurys Inn, but the staff very graciously helped us to cancel a dinner reservation.  They were very professional, nice and welcoming!  I imagine this would be a great place to stay.",5,2017,07,30
231,Dependable place to stay in Dublin,"Jury's Inn had the essentials: free wifi, a huge breakfast selection, a decent bar, and fruit-infused water in the lobby. The room was somewhat small; our room's window looked out into a residential apartment building, so it was common to see the residents on their deck for a smoke. Parnell St. was also under major construction when we were there, but that didn't make too big an impact on our stay. Everything we wanted to do was in walking distance as well. It might have nicer to stay a bit closer to the river, but Jury's Inn was worth the spend.",4,2017,07,29
231,"Clean, easy and right in city centre!","Pleasantly surprised! Many accommodations in Dublin were sold out that weekend because of the U2 concert so we booked this hotel because it was one of the few left with occupancy. It looked like a typical chain, so expectations were not very high, but it did look to be close to it all. Arriving in Dublin for the 1st time, we found the hotel to be perfectly suited for our stay and touring of the city! We could walk to almost everything, including Croke Park for the concert, down to St Stephen's Green and even over to Guiness and Phoenix park. It was very close to Temple Bar which was great for a night out.We felt safe walking at night too and on our last night we got back to the hotel after midnight and there was an attendant who verified we were patrons before letting us in. Other than the inflated price for a basic room, (due to the concert), we would recommend hotel as central spot to get to everything.",5,2017,07,29
231,"Jurys Inn - Dublin, Parnell Street","The Jurys brand is known to offer a consistent and reliable offering to guests whether on business or leisure. The Dublin - Parnell Street hotel is conveniently located, situated around 400 metres off O'Connell Street and within a 10 / 15 minute walk of Temple Bar. The hotel is 'fine' in all aspects and shouldn't disappoint short-term holiday and leisure guests visiting Dublin.",4,2017,07,28
231,Excellent,"The hotel location perfect. Near to all shopping and transport facilities
The hotel personnel very kind and helpful. The hotels cleanliness excellent.
I really loved the bed. Breakfast had all we needed. Nice bar as well ",4,2017,07,27
231,In Dublin for the football ... and the Guinness,"First ... the obvious disclaimer. It's been years since I stayed in a Jury's Inn, so the below only reflects my experience between July 11th and 15th.

Location:
Couldn't be bettered; the AirCoach service from the airport stops on O'Connell St, which is five minutes away, and if you were taking a taxi, there are stacks of dropping points.

First impressions:
OK. Unusually deep (slightly dark) reception area, so do stride in confidently as if you know where you're going. Five staff on duty when I arrived at 3pm midweek, so 'served' immediately. The duty manager (Polish, maybe Czech) was excellent; pithy, precise and clear diction. 
My only small-ish difficulty came when I headed for the lifts. Smart card access usually means that you insert a card, wait until a green light shows, then press the button/turn the handle. Tried that 4/5 times - nothing happened.
Baffled, I turned round, saw another guest who tried it too. 2/3 times - no light.
At this point, I'd have expected one of the five staff to see us struggling (as the desk is only 10 metres away) and offer guidance.
Eventually, a third guest arrived, said the card had to be removed before the green light showed ... as was explained inside the lift, when it's rather too late.
A small point, but all it needed was a little bit of nous by the staff to inform us.

Room:
First impressions, decent refurb of an old-ish hotel. Plenty of space, air-con worked efficiently, bathroom was just big enough for Brits, although small for US visitors.
Pleased to see sufficient coffee/tea/sugar/milk, and a 'bonus' of a bottle of still mineral water and a packet of oat biscuits. Sadly (and oddly) they didn't appear again during my stay.
Really comfy bed and pillows, so great sleeps - possibly deepened by the consumption of Guinness. Sheet changes seemed random. Not changed on my second day or the fourth. Maybe it's a 'green/water-saving' policy, but little surprised, nonetheless.
I was on the side of the hotel, opposite what looked like flats or social accommodation. If you are, and you sleep au naturel, don't get up and fling the curtains back ... as you'll be looking to someone's kitchen or front-room. 

Restaurant/Bar.
Didn't try the latter, but the former was fine. Modern, open-plan, nothing flashy, but then it's the food/drink which matters.
Very comprehensive choice of hot/cold food, from scrambled eggs, white pudding and sausages to pumpkin seeds, smoothies and crudities. Decent coffee too.
My only thought (particularly as a journalist) was the size/style/content of the breakfast menu. I barely saw anyone reading theirs, but discovered that there were other options to the visible ones; including maple syrup, pancakes, French toast (perfect for Americans) and boiled eggs and 'soldiers' for Brits.
Unfortunately, the very old-school layout meant the 'specials' were hidden in the middle of a huge 'document'. For me: a) the menu should be re-designed to highlight those specials, and b) the menus should be in the bedrooms. 
I took a B&B option, but it was clear that others didn't, but if they'd been able to study the menu at their leisure in their room, they might well have been tempted to 'sign-up' for breakfast. 

Check-out:
Quick/efficient and the offer to look after the luggage was appreciated. I didn't take it up, but excellent policy, as lugging bags through the centre of a crowded and muggy city centre would have been agony for tourists not travelling light, as I was.  

Repeat visit:
Absolutely ... anywhere decent in Dublin is expensive, and I thought my package was very good value. Location, as always is critical, and Parnell Street is the right side of the Liffey to avoid the Temple Bar mob-scene at night.",5,2017,07,27
231,"excellent location, friendly staff, room big enough, priced well.","I have stayed here before and location wise it's great for exploring Dublin. About a 12 minute walk will get you to O'Connell bridge (depends walking speed, this was a steady pace, not speed walking!). Staff were really friendly and room was same for any Jury's Inn. We weren't in the hotel much at all, didn't eat there as Dublin has so many restaurants, cafes, pubs etc that I wouldn't have chosen to eat there. This doesn't mean the food isn't good as I didn't try it, it's just personal choice. Check in was easy, my room wasn't ready so left my bag there and collected later. Room was on 4th floor round the back so was quiet. If you want a room in Dublin at a reasonable rate that's close to the centre, then I'd recommend. Sure, you can pay much more for a better star rating hotel, but I'd rather save the 100 quid thanks as there's nothing all wrong with this one. Thanks to the staff, they were great. ",5,2017,07,27
231,Great Location for exploring Dublin,This is not a budget hotel ... but neither is it exorbitant. What it gives to the visitor is quick access to the attractions at the City Centre of Dublin and quick access to transport to outlying attractions. It is very close the the main thoroughfare (O'Connell Street).,5,2017,07,27
231,Vacationing in Dublin,"Hotel is well-situated. From hotel, we mostly walked to most attractions. The hotel is clean and staffs were amazing. I will definitely stay at this hotel whenever I am in Dublin. Airport bus stop is 2 blocks away from hotel. Tours bus are only 10 min walk.",5,2017,07,26
231,Jury's Inn Dublin ,This hotel was our second preference to the Gresham but met our needs. It's close to the city centre and has shops located close by that are open til late. The hotel was lovely and clean and it's staff were all professional and friendly. I would stay there again! Thanks!,5,2017,07,26
231,Central location,"My husband and I stayed two nigths during our İreland trip and enjoyed. Very central location,  Most atractions are walking distance. We arrived noon. 
Very  friendly staff, easy check ln, clean and comfortable rooms and delicious breakfast. Recomended.",4,2017,07,26
231,Dublin City Break,Booked the hotel as part of a city break to Dublin. The hotel is centrally located a minutes walk from Upper O'Connell Street and a leisurely 10 minutes stroll from the river Liffey. A warm welcome at reception was a good start. Access to rooms is secure with the elevators operated using your room keycard. Rooms have typically standard décor and are very clean and comfortable. Bar and restaurant are on the second floor. Breakfast was a typical buffet style with a good choice of hot and cold food. Good value for a centrally located hotel. Close to transport. We would be happy to return.,4,2017,07,25
231,Location is great walking distance,"Great place great location great team of people customer service was great I would recommend this hotel to all.
Parnell St within walking distance to temple bar area 5 minutes walk 
food was also great in hotel  ",5,2017,07,25
231,Great location but expensive due to demand,The hotel was in an excellent location and the rooms were clean and tidy although the bathroom was looking a bit dated. The check in staff were very friendly. The annoying thing was that like most hotels when they know the demand will be high due to concerts/events they charge extortionate room rates.,4,2017,07,25
231,Kudos to Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street,"Very accommodating and friendly staff. Hotel and room was pleasant, comfortable and  clean.  Even the breakfast was amazing. Great location - near all. We were able to walk to all the sites from the hotel. The tour bus pickup location was a one minute walk away. The price of the room was very reasonable.  I highly recommend Jurys Inn at Parnell Street.",5,2017,07,24
231,Weekend stay Dublin,"Stayed for weekend to attend U2 concert at Croke Park. Spotless hotel with amazing aircon system( priority!). Some noise issues, however mindful U2 were in town and that's acceptable. Would highly recommend this hotel and will return. ",5,2017,07,24
231,A pleasant city centre Irish hotel,"City hotel in the centre of Dublin, which means you shouldn't expect a view from the room.

Reception: pleasant and helpful, especially since my suitcase didn't arrive with me on the flight to Ireland.

The lift works when you use your room card, which provides extra security.

The room is furnished with a comfortable bed, but minimalist room in terms of storage. There are two drawers, open hanging space, chair, armchair, a little table as well as a desk. There is no fridge, no minibar and no safe.  The hotel, however, does provide coffee/tea facilities in the room.

The WiFi is terrible – very erratic. I was told in reception that they had installed a new system the day before my arrival. It either had teething pains or was a bad system.
Breakfast:  A good variety of food to suit all tastes, including fresh vegetables, which are not found in many hotels. The dining room staff are polite. There is even a free newspaper, be it the Irish Independent.

On the whole, a good choice, very close to tourist sites such as the General Post Office, the Dublin Spire, a short walk to the Liffey River, as well as shopping on Henry Street and in the Ilac and Jervis Shopping Centres.",4,2017,07,24
231,Jury's inn,"The value for money isn't that good we paid almost €400 euros for our stay which i wouldnt do again.The breakfast which is extra is average and always a fight for seeting when busy. The comfort of sleep isn't that good and the cleanliness wasn't good. 
",3,2017,07,24
231,Clean and convenient,"Suitably priced, clean and comfortable.  
Staff were friendly and helpful.  Hotel is ideally situated close to airport bus transfers, city tour stops, Grafton street shopping and Temple Bar.
We pre-booked the full Irish breakfast for our stay and this proved to be excellent value - good variety, available for extended time in the morning and a great way to start the day.
Bedroom was well fitted out and the beds were very comfortable however I would have preferred a choice of pillows.
Would definitely come back and stay again.",4,2017,07,23
231,"Nice Location, Good Option, but initially VERY hard to find on the GPS","We were satisfied once we found the place! Strangely, there's a Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street in LIMERICK, which we were driving from to Dublin, and it was very tricky to convince my iPhone GPS there was another hotel actually in Dublin by the same name.
Eventually we figured out the problem and we arrived. 

Rooms were good, though we wish we could have had a  King bed instead of a double and a single. Shower was easy to use, and had a clean rubber mat and hand grip for security.  View was nothing special. Cabs are quite easy to get in this neighborhood.",5,2017,07,23
231,Great hotel in Dublin,"In summary:  comfortable hotel for a family stay in Dublin.

In detail:  my family had two rooms at Jurys Inn on Parnell street for two nights at the end of July.  We really enjoyed staying here.

Check in was friendly and efficient and our
bags were quickly bought to our rooms.  We had a room at the front of the hotel overlooking the street and one at the back of the hotel.  The rooms were not huge but were a good size.  The high ceilings gave a real sense of space.

The beds were comfortable and temperature of the rooms themselves were just right and could be adjusted if necessary.

The only thing I didn't like was that the bathrooms had a shower over the bath.
 Inevitably it means they are neither a great shower or a great bath and are hassle
to get into and out of.  Initially the shower was a bit fiddly to work out but was fine once we understood the controls.  Water pressure was good.

Breakfast was included with our room and it was both quality and quantity.  There was a full cooked breakfast as well as continental options.  It really set us up for the day.

I also have to mention the bar.    The bar was spacious and comfortable.  The bar tender was funny and helpful.  She put us on to Green Spot Irish whiskey which has become my new favourite.

Otherwise, Jurys is in a good location.  There are a lot of shops and supermarkets nearby and it's less than a kilometre to walk to the river and Temple Bar.

There is also a decent family restaurant across the road.  It had an extensive
menu and everything we ordered was great.

Highly recommended",4,2017,07,22
231,"Fab service, fab price, fab location, fab staff, rude security guard","Currently staying in the hotel and loving it, reception staff are amazing and will always go one step further. Security guard overly rude at the door, spoke the way no staff should speak to paying guests. Practically barked at us to ask our names before we were let into hotel (fair enough) but could and should have done so much more politely and then proceeded to bark at me and tell me to put my shoes (heels) on (equally fair enough) but told me to do so very rudely instead of asking politely - could've ruined a really lovely evening out for my boyfriends 21st birthday but we didn't let it - hotel overall really great beds super comfy, all other staff amazing and will go above on beyond and location was fab! Would recommend 100% but beware of rude security guard. ",4,2017,07,21
231,"Great Location, Good Sized Rooms & Helpful Staff",This hotel is in a fantastic location for exploring all that Dublin has to offer.  The room sizes are generous and have everything that a city break traveller could want.  Staff are helpful and the only downside is the lack of parking.,4,2017,07,20
231,Great hotel with friendly staff,"Enjoyed the room and breakfast. 2nd year in a row to stay here. I enjoyed this location near the city center. All of the staff are helpful, welcoming, and ready to answer any questions about the city, or where ever you may be headed.",5,2017,07,20
231,Central Location,"Great place to stay - full service, nice rooms, helpful staff. The bed was very comfortable, but a fan in each room would definitely help for those who need white noise to fall asleep. Common areas are ultra perfume-y and will give you sneezing fits. ",4,2017,07,19
231,Disappointed in staff,"The hotel is in a perfect location, room was good for what we needed. However I found the reception staff quite rude. On the 16th July me and my partner enjoyed some supper on the river side, in which we were violently attacked by 6 thugs, smacked with bottles at the back of our heads, punched, hair ripped out. Had to to run to the main round and beg people for help. Eventually a taxi pulled over and took us to the hotel, my partner asked the receptionist to call the police, who then took statements off us. The hotel staff have not once asked to check up how we are, nothing. I'm disappointed that we have been left like this. Will never return again.",3,2017,07,18
231,Loved our stay!,"My partner and I have just returned from a two night stay. We really enjoyed our stay- a really comfortable hotel. We paid for an Executive room and it was worth it. In the fridge was provided Diet Coke and Kit Kats. Complimentary water was a good size. Beds were extremely comfy and a good size. Bathroom wasn't a bad size either. We ate in the restaurant one of the nights and the food was delicious. Very generous portion sizes! I had the Mexican pizza and my partner had a fish finger sandwich. Staff were very friendly, everyone we came into contact with. Rooms cleaned to a good standard. One thing that may improve things is nets or some form of muslin curtain at the windows. The rooms that look out on the courtyard don't have nets only curtains so you need to draw the curtains if you want privacy. I doubt people could see fully in but it did make us a bit conscious. The location is good, only a ten minute or so walk to Temple Bar. The Aircoach from the airport stops at a stop on O'Connell Street that was a short walk away from the hotel. There is a decent sized Tesco across the road which is handy for in room supplies. Would stay here again. ",5,2017,07,18
231,Super Convenient,"This was a nice hotel. Safe and quiet, right in the center of Dublin. This hotel is not cheap, but it was within walking distance of all we wanted to do. Rooms are small, can only fit in a double bed and a single bed. This meant we had to get TWO rooms for the four of us. We were able to get adjoining rooms.  Nice bathroom. ",5,2017,07,18
231,Nice for the area.,"We stayed a night. Partnering Parking building is a bit far and out of the way but doable. It's within walking distance to the city but a little out of the way. The room was for a family of four and had two twin beds in place of a second queen, in relation to an American set up. Overall, clean and doable. Bathroom shower curtain is a bit short so I had to remind the kiddos to keep it in so the floor wouldn't easily flood. It's not a charming Irish place but a chain with uninteresting corridors. Safety wise the hotel key card has to be used for everything such as bathrooms and elevators. That was a little hard with kids and only two keys given, one of which was in use in the room with anyone left behind. Breakfast should be included as it was excellent and a ton of choices for everyone. Best part of the stay. ",4,2017,07,18
231,"Disappointing ambianc inside, good location but without any charm","From the moment I walked in, I felt as if I were in a Holiday Inn - the lobby had the unwelcoming atmosphere of a 3 star hotel.  We had passed the Jurys Inn Christchurch which looked to be in a livelier area but, as both hotels were full, there couldn't be an exchange.  The decor was bland & the bathroom (with only a shower IN the bathtub - try hoisting yourself over a 3 foot side) was spacious except:  there was barely any space to put your toiletries, no tissues provided, only one hook to hang your night clothes (a bit difficult for TWO of us.  No washcloths, no Qtips, no bars of soap (you had to stretch to use the push bottle hanging on the wall in the bathtub.  No magnifying mirror.  No safe in the room (you had to rent a safety box in the lobby).  There were very few outlets to charge whatever devices you brought with you & we had to borrow an adapter to even get the cables into the wall. Why, oh why, does every European hotel hide the hair dryer in the room itself as that's the only available outlet strong enough to plug it in ?? How much more convenient would it be to install an outlet IN THE BATHROOM itself so you don't have to carry supplies from one room to another ??

One thing that disconcerted me when we checked in.  There were NO, & I mean NOT ONE, staff member born in Ireland.  Every single person, from the receptionist to the manager, was from eastern Europe, e.g., Poland, Rumania, the Czech Republic.  Are native born Irish people SO expensive to hire that the hotel had to dredge Europe to fill staff positions ?? Warm, polite welcome but not what we expected.

On the plus side:  the bed was super comfortable with all white linens & a wonderful lightweight down comforter, the buffet breakfast selection was palatial (at 10-11 Euros, it ought to be) with everything you could possibly want to eat & the Dining Room was moderately priced with very good food (in the event you're too tired to search for a neighborhood restaurant).  And, directly across the street, there's a small coffee shop owned by a Rumanian woman who served EXCELLENT coffee.",3,2017,07,18
231,Excellent stay,"The service was excellent nothing was to much through out are stay bedroom cleanliness was spot on 
Location good not to far from temple bar overall we had a brilliant stay would recommend this hotel to friends ",5,2017,07,17
231,Birthday surprise,"stayed for two nights which was not cheap but the hotel is central, nice public bar, good breakfast but very busy. Poor sleep due to cleaners on corridor early people slamming doors late at night, noisy children which isn't the hotels fault. Took a while to check in as staff could not find booking. Luggage store good to leave bags before and after check in and check out.",4,2017,07,17
231,70TH BIRTHDAY SURPRISE,"Stayed for 3 nights as a birthday surprise for one of our party.  Card, balloons and chocolates in room together with free drinks voucher.  Staff very helpful and welcoming.  Short walk to centre.  Would recommend",5,2017,07,17
231,"All correct, good service for money (at current crazy rates of Dublin center)","The hotel is very correct and very well located just off to O'connel Street. The quality of the hotel is very decent with all facilities for a business trip without hassle. 
Possibly the best (or one of the bests) value for money in Dublin city center for business. ",5,2017,07,17
231,Good hotel in a great location!,"Good hotel right on Parnell Street, 1min from O'Connel Street, 5min from Henry Street and ca. 10min. from Temple Bar District. The room was big enough for 3 people, but not many possibilities to put stuff, so that we had to leave everything in our suitcases. Although we were three people in the room, there were only 2 towels, so we had to ask reception for a third set. Which was absolutely no problem and sent to our room at once. But the next day they exchanged everything (although we didn't put the towels on the floor as suggested) and we again had only 2 sets, which was super annoying. Also, the bathroom had very little space to put things and no toilet brush. 

We didn't book breakfast in the hotel, as 10 euro per person is quite a lot and you can have great breakfast just around the corner, there are so many little cafés where you can have your scone & tea for around 5 euros.",4,2017,07,17
231,Perfect for a city break!,"Stayed here for a night this weekend. We had a double room with a view into the courtyard. Room was spacious and very comfortable. The duvet was amazing! Staff at reception were friendly and helpful. 

The bathroom was nice but the bath was shallow so not ideal for a long soak!

Location is perfect and the ilac centre is close by. There is an atm across the street and a tesco for anything you have forgotten! ",5,2017,07,16
231,The Staff Rocks!,"Central location, AMAZING STAFF who were friendly and helpful beyond the beyonds, comfortable & clean rooms, delicious & affordable buffet breakfast with so many choices. We felt welcome, safe, and supported throughout our stay.",5,2017,07,16
231,Good hotel in poor location.,"Parnell Street in Dublin is a mess of roadworks and shabby shops. Hotel is well run by helpful and friendly staff. Breakfast is good value, but annoying to have to sign in every morning. Dinner menu is poor.",4,2017,07,16
231,Good Weekend Stay,"We stayed 2 nights here, rooms were clean, beds very comfortable, shower ok the downside was poor wifi - it would go on and off all the time.  It is well located near plenty bars and restaurants and about a 20 min walk to St Stephens Green/Grafton St.  I would stay here again.",4,2017,07,16
231,One night stay,"We had an excellent check in experience efficient and friendly.The room and bathroom was clean, bed comfortable. Air conditioning was very good during warm weather. Breakfast was tasty with good range of choice. All staff we dealt with very friendly and efficient . The hotel is adjacent to city centre tourist attractions.",5,2017,07,16
231,Wonderful overnight stay - excellent Hotel!,"I stayed here for one night on 10th July. I was a bit apprehensive travelling as a woman alone but having key card lift access to floors with the bar and restaurant being on the second floor made this a totally relaxing experience for me. The Hotel itself was clean and comfortable and the staff were so friendly and accommodating. There is a wide choice available at the breakfast buffet,I opted for the full Irish breakfast which was amazing. If you eat here in the evening I can definitely recommend the 'sticky toffee pudding ' it was heavenly with out a doubt the best I have ever tasted! I would definitely recommend this excellent hotel it will be my number one choice when I have to stay in Dublin again",5,2017,07,15
231,Excellent in so many ways,"Loved this hotel!  Friendly, super clean and best beds we have ever had in a hotel.  We arrived late but the restaurant was more than happy to accommodate our group of 10 and the food was delicious.  Would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it.",5,2017,07,14
231,Top hotel 10/10,Jury's Dublin was great from start to finish the staff are great and the bar staff are great craic. Thank you for a great wee break. p.s I thought the ice making machine on every floor way a class touch lol,5,2017,07,14
231,Very good clean hotel,"Visited here for 2 nights august 2016 with my partner,Check in was quick and easy hotel clean comfortable and breakfast was AMAZING! Couldnt fault it! Only negative would be One of the female managers was rude and abrupt on a couple of occasions,She was of eastern european origin and wasnt courteous or friendly which i found dissapointing however the female irish manageress in breakfast room was fantastic!",4,2017,07,14
231,Election experience,The hotel it sleft was amazing and it was so near everything and all the staff there was so friendly and so helpful. The bed where so comeful and the bathroom was so well clean. And I would recommend it to anyone is looking for some where to say.,5,2017,07,13
231,Clean hotel with friendly staff in a good location!,The hotel was very well-kept.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating as we arrived before our room was ready. They held our bags so we could begin to explore Dublin.  This is a great hotel in a good location without spending a fortune for a hotel stay.   ,5,2017,07,13
231,Good hotel,"Apart from the room type being different to that booked on trip advisor/booking.com (booked a room with 2 double beds was offered 2 single beds because ""that is what is on our system"" - settled for a double bed which is all I wanted), the hotel and staff are nice. Guys behind the bar very good, smiling and helpful.",4,2017,07,12
231,Fair city,"This long weekend was a birthday gift and as I've never been to Dublin I just couldn't wait, the Jury Inn was well laid out but very small, we stayed in an upgrade room and found it quite tight for space so I hate to think what the standard rooms were like, breakfast was well laid out and at 10€ per head very reasonable unlike the bar which we found very expensive as is the city in Dublin, we would not return to this hotel as we felt it didn't meet our needs",3,2017,07,12
231,Great Hotel,"Booked a triple room for girls weekend. Central for tourists but on a quiet enough street for sleep without too much street noise. The restaurant is good for grabbing a bite to eat. Staff are very friendly. Reasonably priced for location, would recommend.",4,2017,07,11
231,Business Stay - Good Choice,I stayed in Jurys Inn Parnell Sq Dublin for 2 night for a Conference in Dublin Castle.  This hotel offered good value and a great location.  The staff were excellent and the accommodation was of a good standard.  The breakfast choice was extensive and the dining area was well set out.  Would definitely stay again,4,2017,07,11
231,Wonderful place to stay; right next to O'Connell Street,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights two weeks ago. We loved our room, beds were quite comfortable and staff kept the room very clean each day we were there. Breakfast buffet in the morning was incredible! Anything you could possibly want for a full Irish. They will also make waffles and pancakes on request. (Breakfast wasn't included in our room rate, but their breakfast vouchers were only €10 each and it was WELL worth each Euro!)
Location was awesome, mere steps away from O'Connell Street, only about maybe a 15 min walk from Temple Bar and about 5 mins walk to Henry and Mary Streets for any shopping.
Would definitely recommend staying here to anyone!",5,2017,07,11
231,Great hotel in Dublin,We stayed at the Jury's Parnell St. while traveling on holiday in Europe.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I would particularly like to give a special thanks to the reception desk staff.  If you are looking for a clean hotel in a safe location the Jurys is for you.  Good value for the price,4,2017,07,10
231,An exceptional location for a birthday break,"the hotel was ideally situated near O'Connell Street and then only a short walk to Temple Bar and the other central areas. Staff were exceptionally helpful in making reservations, advising on restaurants and attractions, checking in on line with the airline, switching us to a room with a view. The room itself (we had an executive room) was large clean and comfortable with a fridge that we could actually use, aircon,and a huge and very comfortable bed. All in all, a great hotel for a birthday treat!",5,2017,07,10
231,Good stay. Helpful staff.,"This hotel is large and close to O'Connell street and a good shopping strip.
The staff were very friendly and helpful.  They contacted us quickly to let us know we left our passports and the maintenance man helped to change the flat tyre on our car which was way above and beyond his job.  We were very grateful.
We had an executive room . It was clean and quite spacious.  The breakfast was good but got very busy after 9am.  There was a small gym with a treadmill,  cross trainer, bike and weights.
Only down side was a lot of construction work going on in the road outside the hotel but that is not the fault of the hotel.",5,2017,07,10
231,Good Location But Understaffed,"Our room was as booked, clean, with a good shower, and the breakfast selection was very good.  However, sometimes they ran out of eggs and didn't bring any more out until it was time for us to leave.

The night staff was very inadequate for the number of people who needed assistance. They had 3 people working buy only the night manager was able to help adequately. The other staff members couldn't book a airport taxi for the morning, open the safe for me to remove my passports, or complete my checkout since we were leaving at 6:30 am for the airport. It took me a precious 1 1/2 hours to complete my business when I would rather have been sleeping!",3,2017,07,10
231,Poor customer service,"Jury's in seem to expect trouble at night time, given their bizarre and unprofessional night time door policy (rudely asking for names and ticking them off a list before allowing entrance to paying customers!)",1,2017,07,10
231,Jurys inn need to shape up,"Breakfast was not fresh. Fried eggs had been laying there a while. Tasted like plastic. Salami tasted old and unfresh.

Gym was small and cramped.

Security guard in the evening was very unpleasant and not service minded. Felt unwelcome

Room was small and cramped although we go a family room ",3,2017,07,10
231,Great stay,Great stay but decor is basic. Bed very comfortable and location is great. Staff very friendly check in was easy. Had our room ready when we arrived at 10 in the morning. The room is basic which was fine as we weren't in there for long,5,2017,07,10
231,"Good location, clean and tidy","No complaints for a one night stay. Staff were all really helpful, booked us a taxi for 5 30 in morning so we didn't have to worry about getting back to airport. Room clean and tidy, nothing spectacular but perfectly adequate. Communal areas such as reception and bar looked inviting and enjoyed a few drinks. Secure at night weren't able to just walk in off the street, needed key card to enter lifts and get into room areas. Great location, would definitely stay again.",4,2017,07,09
231,"Clean, Quiet, Comfortable Place","We stayed here for just one night in between getting into Dublin on a Friday evening and leaving Saturday morning on a tour, but found our room to be clean and very comfortable. It was also very quiet, so I couldn't ask for much more. The staff were also very friendly and helpful. I'd definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,07,09
231,9 Month stay,"Excellent Staff, good service, excellent location.
I was given the same room every week (at my request) and I got to know the staff very well.  The room had all the amenities (hair-dryer, iron and ironing board, kettle, tea and coffee).",5,2017,07,07
231,Very good,"Jurys Inn Parnell Lane is a pretty good hotel with a decent location. It's walking distance to most Dublin attractions, and walking distance to bus/tram stops to take you further. The room was small, but the bed was comfortable, shower was good, and service was excellent. Breakfast was good as well, particularly the coffee.",4,2017,07,06
231,Great place to stay,"Very friendly and accommodating staff. With our need to leave before breakfast for a tour they provided a packed breakfast, which was a bonus. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The only down-side was that our room had an adjoining door to the next one and for the first two nights of our stay we had a loud family in there. It seemed they allowed the child to knock on the door and their noisy exchanges went on until after midnight. We perhaps should have asked for a change, but thankfully they moved out before our stay had ended. Overall this is a good central location that is serviced by local transport and it's a short walk from the airport bus stop.",5,2017,07,06
231,Comfort,"After 7 days on the road it was great to be back in Dublin.  The hotel is great, the staff more than helpful (especially after I thought I had lost my credit card) and everything was in walking distance",5,2017,07,06
231,Not bad but I wouldn't necessarily stay here again,"I booked a Double Standard room for a 3 night stay -  honestly the room seemed rather 'basic'.
There was a comfortable bed, although the duvet felt much too thick (I would have prefered something a quarter of the thickness), and the pillows seemed rather flat once I laid my head on them.
At night the air con was very noisy and I had to turn it off to be able to sleep, but without it I was burning up under that duvet (in the end I left the air con off and slept with the duvet pushed to the other side of the bed)

The rest of the room seemed clean, a desk with a comfortable desk chair, an armchair and a small table. With only one double bed there seemed like a lot of empty space (likely because this same room could fit two single beds) but you'd think given the extra space the table and armchair wouldn't both be tucked away in the corners of the room.
Not a problem really but poor planning.
One oddity was the lack of a door on the wardrobe, and no evidence there ever was one.

The TV was a decent size with a decent selection of chanels, I would prefer it though if the guide worked - it would have saved time skipping through the chanels and, sods law, half of them were adverts.

The tea and coffee facilities in the room were nice, a proper kettle I'm happy to report with plenty of sugar and milk for a good cuppa in the morning.

A main disappointment was the lack of a safe, I was told the executive rooms had a safe, but for the rest there were only safety deposit boxes down in the foyer (free of charge for the whole stay, unless you lose the key which is fair) and you got to keep the key so you know no one else has access to your valuables.
It did make it awkward however if you needed to get something out to use briefly and stow away again, especially as you needed someone at reception to unlock the section of boxes before you could unlock your own box.
I felt like a burden on reception, especially on my first day as I was in and out of the foyer a lot trying to arrange what I needed and what I wanted locked away, then going there each morning I had to dip in to get tickets or extra cash.
There also seemed a lack of organisation regarding the security boxes; some staff made me sign and date a form to show I'd opened the box and waited while I did to retrieve thier key, others however simply unlocked the boxes and walked away.

The view from my room was less that stellar I have to say (5th floor so higher than any of the nearby buildings), a nice view of a back alley and rooftops with the Dublin Spire rising above them. Much of my time however was spent in the city so the view wasn't that important, and being a city I didn't expect much nicer.

For the bathroom again we go back to 'basic'.
The soap, shampoo and shower gel were in dispenser bottles on the wall - I would prefer a proper bar of soap.
And despite a good number of towels there was no flannel to wash my face (luckily I thought to bring my own)
The shower was good despite being a single shower head above you (a detachable handheld shower head would have made some parts easier to reach) and the bath was low making it easy to climb in and out of, and had a decent width to stand in. 

The hotel itself was clean and looked nice, and it felt very secure as you needed to swipe your room key to call a lift from the foyer, then swipe it again inside the lift to select a floor.

The bar in the evening served good drinks and had a couple of TV's for sports (I can't say about the food as I didn't order anything)

Breakfast was ok. At first glance there was a good selection, unfortunately the hot food was not all hot.
There was plenty of choice for bread/toast and a lot of different jams, pastries however were only small croissants and pain aux chocolate (the croissant were nice but I'm not a fan of pain aux chocolate) I would have liked a danish of some description.

The breakfast on the first and second day wasn't bad, the sausages were always warm but everything else differed from day to day. And I always went early so I got out early.
The last day however the 'hot' food left a strange taste in my mouth a little like onions. I didn't eat much of it.
Not nice, but luckily it was gone after a couple of croisants with jam.

The seating at breakfast was a little awkward, ""you can sit anywhere.""
On my first breakfast I chose a table and got up to get a coffee, but when I came back my table had been taken by another group.
There were other vacant tables so I sat down at the nearest one and left my coffee while I went to get some food (that was enough to hold the table, the next couple of days I made sure to get my coffee first.)
Assigned tables would have been more preferable.

The hotel is definitely well situated, it's within easy walking distance of the shops and the main sights.
The transfer from the airport is rather simple as the Aircoach 700 bus takes you to the Gresham Hotel (second stop) less than 5 minutes walk around the corner, and the bus back leaves from just across the road. 
Only a few doors further down the road is stop 1 for the hop on hop off bus.

In the end I would say the Jurys Inn Is good for a short stay, for sightseeing or a business trip, but if you're looking for a great hotel to go with it, I might try elsewhere.",3,2017,07,05
231,Night Away,"Unexpected trip.staff was very helpful and friendly .perfect location for shopping trip. Will definitely return again. Rooms were lovely.  Cant wait to return again. Will definitely join loyalty program  

",5,2017,07,04
231,Great location - friendly staff,Spent two nights with my family of 5 in June 2017.  The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful.  Hotel is located within easy walking distance to shopping and the Temple Bar restaurant / pub district.  It is also VERY close to the pick up point for many bus and coach tours.  I would definitely stay there again.,5,2017,07,04
231,Smart Choice,"Great desk staff. Clean & quiet. Comfortable beds and blackout curtains. Good location near O'Connell Street, as well as pedestrian-friendly  Henry Street. Close to many city bus routes, Hop-On-Hop-Off & taxi services, along with newer street rail line. Would highly recommend!",5,2017,07,04
231,"Nice hotel, close to everything and air-coach drop-off","Very nice hotel, close to everything. very close to the drop off and pick up for the air coach service for Dublin airport. The room was great didn't have the breakfast. staff are friendly and knowledgeable. easy hotel to find in the city centre.",5,2017,07,04
231,Didn't want to leave hotel,"Booked with this hotel Sat-Mon as we were going to 3Arena on the Sunday. Was expecting a fairly standard hotel. 
Check in was super fast! lobby is lovely. We were in our room in no time at all and could not believe how comfortable the beds were for a standard room! Absolutely dreamy! 23 years old and felt twice my age cause I took down the name and brand that was on the mattress. Literally struggled to get out of bed every morning so comfort is absolutely on point in this hotel. A decent hairdryer also provided and a great shower. View isn't great but wasn't expecting much for the area anyway.  ice machines and vending machines around every corner of each floor which was great! 
Very good location close to Henry st and a quick walk over the liffey to reach temple bar area! Would definitely stay here again!",4,2017,07,03
231,Shorttrip to Dublin,"A great stay for a long weekend! Great location, which is very close to everything. It is quite silent. The rooms for 3 persons are not to big but OK. The double bed for two persons is wuite narrow but as the pillow is very big it is OK.",5,2017,07,03
231,Jurys Inn - Worth the visit,Hotel was clean and efficient. Staff was friendly and helpful. Parking was an issue but there was a celebration in town that day and led to that situation. Our room was ready and clean and comfortable. The dinner at the restaurant was excellent. We had a great time staying there.,4,2017,07,03
231,Great hotel.,Stayed for a night with my brother as he was going to a concert nearby. Bar was lovely very clean. Room was nice but didn't like the view as it was just of the other rooms but that's due to my own self. Great location. Would definitely be back.,4,2017,07,03
231,Great Stay,"My mom and I stayed here while exploring Dublin for a few days. From the Dublin airport, we took the aircoach bus, Route 700, to O'Connell Street. It was just a short walk rolling our bags to the hotel. It costs 12 euros each round trip. The location of the hotel is great and everything we saw was within walking distance: Dublin Castle, Temple Bar, St.Patrick's Cathedral, Christ Church Cathedral, The Brazen Head, and tons of restaurants/pubs. To see the Guinness Storehouse you may want to take a cab for around 11 euros maybe, and the hotel can call one for you. The book of Kells is also close by at Trinity College. The room itself was clean and comfortable. We asked for a quiet room, so ours faced a little courtyard. The room was quiet, except for a rattle in the HVAC, but it didn't keep us up at night. The room has a thermostat, so it's comfortable to your liking. The beds were nice, the shower worked (I had no drain or hot water issues). The staff was very friendly and helpful. We didn't eat breakfast there, so I can't comment on that.",4,2017,07,03
231,3 Ladies Traveling,"The Jury Inn on Parnell St was excellent, three of us traveled and never felt not safe, the elevators are very secure with card access to get to the floors with rooms. The hotel is very clean, the breakfast was wonderful and the staff was also great. A short walk to down town. Great restaurant across the street, pubs nearby, Lidl is just around the corner...would recommend.",5,2017,06,30
231,A big 'NO',"For a hotel in that price range (>140 €) , we expected more.
The (non-Irish) reception staff was businesslike-friendly, but it was easy to sense the she did not have one of her strongest days.
The room was clean, but it had an exceptionally terrible view onto filthy backyards and a city cleaning depot in which the noisy work started before 5 o'clock in the morning.
The bed was definitely not good. It was unsteady; it moved far too easy, both of us slept badly. 
Bad: There is no hotel parking space available. The receptionist recommended a car park building the hotel works together with... not exactly around the corner, and unfortunately we never made it there. Dublin presented itself as a noisy, fifthly Moloch with a persistent gridlock, bursting at the seams from all perspectives. The fact that presently the O’Connell street and some other streets around it is one big construction site with an aggravated getting through for vehicles and pedestrians, heavily intensifies the traffic chaos.",3,2017,06,29
231,Great place!,"We booked this hotel mostly because June is crazy and everything is booking at a premium. This place already had good reviews and looked like a decent spot. We didn't really know what we'd be doing in Dublin so we kind of blind-booked and hoped for the best! 

Turns out this hotel was great! I only gave it 4 stars because the air conditioning was locked to not be able to go cooler than 16 C. Normally that probably isn't an issue. However we wound up getting a freak heat wave and the a/c just couldn't get it cool enough to get comfortable. Location was pretty quiet, far enough from the party crowd, but close enough to get to it when you want to. We didn't have a spectacular view from our specific room, but we weren't looking out the windows anyway since the sun was beating through the windows like crazy! It was our 18-yr old son, plus my husband and myself. We would definitely recommend this hotel for a good value for money!",4,2017,06,28
231,Really nice hotel in great downtown location,"The Jurys Inn on Parnell St in Dublin is modern, clean and comfortable in a great location. Full buffet breakfast was outstanding. Had dinner in the restaurant which was as good as any we had during our 9 days all over Ireland. Lounge was large and comfortable. ",5,2017,06,28
231,Excellent location and staff,"Recently stayed for two nights excellent from start to finish check in was quick and efficient as was the check out used the q carpark for the duration of our stay close to the hotel and only 20 Euro great value. Breakfast was 10 Euro each person again great value healthy option cereals and fry options fresh fruit definately something for everyone and lovely helpful staff. The bar situated on the second floor beside the restaurant was nice and quiet after all the hubbub of the city.Dublin is fantastic and jurys inn is perfectly located for temple bar the gpo and right on the edge of grafton street. Do not miss a visit to Fitzsimons bar temple bar excellent staff and the entertainment was first class. A lot of roadworks going on around the hotel and its a bit tricky to get to the carpark because of this, I would advise googling the route to the hotel and carpark.",5,2017,06,27
231,Evaluation of stay,"

I enjoyed the stay at this hotel, I recommend your services since I was welcomed with nothing negative to register. There is only one record of the problem we had with the room card as it easily demagnetized and the room temperature was very hot.",5,2017,06,27
231,Average hotel,"Large hotel in a busy neighborhood. It was clean, housekeeping staff very friendly. A bit farther to attractions than we would have liked. Would have been nice to have had a small fridge in the room. Overall good hotel. ",3,2017,06,26
231,Ok for a 1 night stay,"Overall accommodation in Dublin seemed expensive, and this place was in the more affordable end of the list. 
We only stayed for one night and didn't dine in the hotel, but it was clean and tidy and generally had a nice atmosphere. 
Negatives: Individual room safes would be better. 
Also our room had windows onto the smokers terrace, and as we had no net curtains or blinds for privacy we had to keep the curtains shut the whole time which made the room extremely dark. 
We were on the 2nd floor, same as the bar which led to noise late at night. 
Otherwise it was fine and the luggage storage is useful. 
I would recommend this place for a short stay, but request a higher floor. ",4,2017,06,26
231,Central to the area of the Spire but lost of construction going on around.,A great hotel near many of the attractions like the Spire and National Post Office. Just a short walk and you are at the Liffey River and near the Temple Bar district. A traditional Irish breakfast is offered and with a fully stomach you are ready for a day of sight seeing.,4,2017,06,25
231,Very Handy location,Very handy location in Dublin for an overnight or weekend break. Exactly what you expect of a Jury's Inn.  Great for shopping and near lots of restaurants and transport. Opposite a Tesco which is great,4,2017,06,23
231,"Good hotel, excellent service","Very good breakfast. Room comfortable, well equipped, clean. We requested a second chair in room and it was promptly delivered. Location is not exciting but convenient, and will be even more convenient when new tram line opens. ",4,2017,06,23
231,"Good Modern Hotel,Convenient Location","Everything you would expect of an International class hotel. Good location - away from noisy bar areas. If you want to economise on food Tescos is just across the road as is a very good bookshop.
Restaurant / bar is good though closes for food a little early (9:30pm).
Convenient for O'Connell Street and airport bus stops. Check bus times on a board at the stop.
",5,2017,06,22
231,Perfect for a break in Dublin,The welcome was spot-on. We had arrived HOURS before the official check-in time but had a room allocated very quickly after depositing our luggage with reception and going for a brief wander down O'Connell Street. This hotel did everything right. We shall return!,5,2017,06,22
231,"Good value, great staff","This is a very nice place to stay...clean, well located (if you don't mind a little walking) and very friendly staff. Parnell Street and this location is about a 20 minute walk to The Temple Bar Area which is ""the happening spot"". But, its an easy cab ride if that works better. The City Tour company is right around the corner and I highly recommend doing that. Great way to see the city and it's a hop on/off tour and you get to use the ticket for 24 hours. Rooms are sort of small and only a single chair to sit in. Biggest drawback is that there is nowhere to stop to offload luggage/check in. there is a no parking area across the street which we used...I checked in while wife watched the car. Also, parking is several blocks away but again...an easy walk.",4,2017,06,21
231,Very friendly staff,"Great hotel, very friendly and approachable staff.  All were willing to help with any request.  Every staff member greeted us when we were walking around the hotel, all of them were very genuine.  Clean and tidy hotel.  Breakfast was a bit on the pricey side, but everything else was great. ",4,2017,06,21
231,Would Stay Again!,"My best friend and I were planning a short 3 night trip to Ireland on the end of my business trip in London. We went through tons of reviews trying to figure out which hotel in Dublin to pick. As the date drew closer, we realized that places had been booked up which limited our choices, and we quickly decided on Jurys Inn at Parnell St.  since the Christ Church location was booked.  Thankfully we were not disappointed. The rooms are big and clean and the bathroom is enormous, coming from the small room and tiny bathroom I had in London. We chose not to have our room cleaned and put a sign on the door, the maid just left us a bag on the door knob filled with clean towels, as opposed to the other hotel in London that would come in even with the Do Not Disturb sign on.  So THANK YOU so much for not disturbing us...for that alone, we will be back on our next trip to Ireland. 

The location of this hotel is right around the corner from O'Connell street and a lot of day tours pick you up from there, so that was convenient for us, a 2 minute walk, especially at 6:50am pick up was helpful!

All in all, we had a great stay and I will definitely be back, since I fell in love with Ireland and I'm already planning my next visit!!  ",5,2017,06,21
231,Only ok,"Hotel was complete overpriced for what it had to offer. We stayed in one of the superior rooms and found it very small. 
The bar food was excellent but I was very surprised at how breakfast was ran. Tables were not set with cutlery or milk, and the hotel even ran out of folks at one stage. Had to ask for milk for cereal as the jug was empty. And when I went to make tea at the counter(no pots of tea or coffee served at the table)they had ran out of teaspoons and I had to use a folk!! I would happily do this at home but not in a hotel!
I would advice that bathroom bins would not be left under a glass shelf as it is very easy for a guest to bang their head, I know, and don't think it is very safe. 
Overall great location but not worth the price they are charging",3,2017,06,20
231,Great location good hotel,We went for a Friday night. The hotel is clean and modern and staff are excellent. Parking just 8 min away and €10 for 24 hours with ticket stamped at hotel. Good atmosphere in the bar. Breakfast excellent choice and fresh/well presented. ,5,2017,06,20
231,Good hotel to work in Dublin,"The hotel is very good, with an excellent breakfast and good bedrooms. The staff is very commited with guests and try to help you always. The location is near pubs, restaurant and downtown. Walk distance to the best touristic points of Dublin centre.",5,2017,06,20
231,"Location,efficiency and friendliness","Great central hotel, nice bar food and really friendly local bar staff. Buffet breakfast a bit chaotic but food selection was fine. Long queue for toast. Room is modern but a bit jaded and carpet was badly stained.  Expensive like all Dublin hotels.  Overall it is a good hotel and I will definitely use it again.",4,2017,06,20
231,Very friendly and very nice location,"It is very close to airport bus station and 10' walk to temple bar and all the points of interest... The executive room was very comfortable and clean (but it needs cable douch in the bathroom).  The staff very friendly.  Very good and quick service...
But we pay for this almost a salary.  More than 200e per day.  I cannot believe that Doublin is more expensive than New York , Paris or London....
",4,2017,06,19
231,Over priced,Was charged extortion price due to Robbie Williams concert and didn't get breakfast either. Very noisy neighbours meant I didn't get much sleep. Walls very thin and they came in at 3am shouting for a good hour. Hotel however is good and location excellent for O'Connell street . I probably would stay again but not at the price they charged. It was. Complete rip off ,2,2017,06,19
231,Great stay at Jury's Inn Parnell Street,"Had a great weekend in Dublin. Jury's staff were very helpful & accommodating. Room was clean and the beds were very comfy! We only had breakfast one day, there was plenty & good selection. Location was perfect right next to O'Connell Street for buses. ",5,2017,06,19
231,Cathryn-Ireland,Felt our 1 night stay was over priced. Staff were friendly. Our room was clean but very basic and the breakfast selection was very disappointing especially regarding fresh fruit and bread available...  ,3,2017,06,19
231,Excellent place to stay,"Receptionist very friendly and courteous
Rooms very comfortable and clean
All staff excellent
Perfect position in centre of town
Breakfast can be very busy at certain times as they keep running out of foods",4,2017,06,18
231,Short break in Dublin,"Recently stayed at this hotel for three nights during a short break in Dublin.

The location is very close to where the buses pick up and drop off if you are using the Airlink 747 to get to/from the airport. It is also within easy walking distance of most of the main tourist attractions. Dublin was far more walkable and compact than I was expecting it to be.  

Checking in to the hotel was pleasant and easy and I was able to prepay for breakfast at the same time.

My room was on the third floor overlooking the main street where, as others have mentioned, there was roadworks but this didn't seem to cause me any inconvenience and didn't even notice any noise.

The room was clean and spacious and was cleaned daily.

I had breakfast in the hotel each morning. There was a huge variety of foods available, and staff were quick to replenish to ensure there was always plenty available. I went to breakfast between 7am - 8am and didn't have to wait for a table.

The bar food served in the evenings was also very good and the bar staff were friendly and helpful.

I would certainly return to this hotel if I was ever in Dublin again, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent hotel.",5,2017,06,18
231,The air conditioner was broken,"The air conditioner was broken, its was unable to get warm and unable to stop. The room was terrible cold. At 00h45 someone ask us to wait 40 min to see if the air conditioner stop. When you go to an hotel the minimum that you expect its a warm room... that was not delivered.",2,2017,06,16
231,Great choice for a long weekend in Dublin,"My partner and I spent two nights in Jury's- wish we could have stayed longer. The hotel is spotless and all of the staff are warm and friendly. Breakfast was spot on, after a night out, and the Nespresso coffee in the room didn't hurt either! We had an Executive room, which I would highly recommend, the extra touches made our short stay even more enjoyable. With Dublin on the doorstep outside, it's the perfect base to explore the city and a short crawl to sleep off the beer in a comfortable bed!",5,2017,06,16
231,"Nice hotel, though expensive:","I wanted a safe, clean, reliable place in Dublin, and Jury's provided that. The room was clean and the staff were accommodating. The breakfast was fine, though most mornings I went out, since it wasn't included. There were a few details that could be improved upon: the only available soap was in dispensers bolted to the wall, and none could be reached from the bathtub. There was no in-room safe. The bed was a little hard. If I had it to do over again, I'd look for a better price.",4,2017,06,16
231,"Perfect location, value for money",A perfect location to stay at especially if you are on business. Close to attractions as well and absolute value for money with great service! Lots of stores and eat out options around for convenience if travelling with family.,4,2017,06,16
231,"Nice location, good value","Stayed here after a long overnight flights. Good location, in walking distance to Guinness store house and temple bar district but just a hair out of the way so the traffics is easier. Parking is a little complicated but the hotel tries to help by tell you which lot to go to and getting a reduced rate. ",4,2017,06,16
231,"Excellent Hotel, Great Location ","I have been to Dublin 3 times and I always, always stay in this hotel. It is my first choice due to the location, local amenities and area. The hotel itself is pleasant, although my last visit they did not have a room ready for us for a very long time but they offered us a free drink to apologise and it was all sorted. The rooms are comfortable, the beds are comfortable. The breakfast is lovely! Lots of choice. It is located just around the corner from the main street in Dublin where all the buses for anywhere you want to go congregate. The tour buses all set off from there. The bus from the airport stops about 3-4 minute walk away. If you stay at this hotel, I absolutely must recommend you visit Murray's pub at the top of the street and across the main road. Their pie is the best I have ever and will ever have! Tescos is over the road for convenience. There is a Lidl about 5 minutes walk away. So its a really convenient place. Highly recommended.",4,2017,06,15
231,Over priced but excellent staff,Massively overpriced for what you get however the staff should be commended for being helpful polite and attentive to a fault. I would suggest trying other better priced hotels where you will probably receive more for your money including a better shower.,3,2017,06,14
231,Peace and quiet amid the noise,"If you have been to Dublin recently, you have , no doubt, witnessed an amazing amount of infrastructure repair and upgrading in progress.  Parnell Street, in front of Jury's Inn is no exception.  Jack hammers, compressors and little bulldozers create quite a din.  Made us wonder how we were going to spend a quiet night on our last day in Dublin.  As we stepped inside we were surrounded by peace, quiet and a very attentive staff.  The charming young lady who checked us in made sure that we had a room away from the street. Our spacious and comfortable room overlooked the courtyard from which no noise emanated.  Had a great restful night followed by a full blown Irish breakfast in the morning.  We made taxi arrangements the night before our departure because of construction going on in front of the hotel.  The front desk let us know that our punctual cabbie was waiting for us at a convenient location near the front door.  I surely will book a room at Jury's for our next visit to this great city.",5,2017,06,14
231,A great location and pleasant stay,"Our experience from the friendly staff at the front desk tho this Inn being right around the corner from the bus stop where we took aerocoach 700 from the airport to our clean and comfortable room couldn't have been better. There wasn't however very much room in the bathroom if your a woman to place all of your necessities so you will jus have to work around that. Other than that the room was perfect and the hotel is within easy walking distance to all of downtown Dublin.  
 ",4,2017,06,13
231,Good experience,"We was some friends for a weekend in Dublin. We enjoy this trip very much. The Jurys Inn is very good located, you can reach the most places by feet, the hotel is clean and the poeple from the Reception very helpful and friendly.",5,2017,06,13
231,Dublin,"What a great hotel in a central location.
Very clean 
Very secure as you need a pass to enter the lifts to your room but also need a pass for the main door at night

We booked breakfast and it was very nice

A great city hotel ,perfect for exploring Dublin (what a great city)",4,2017,06,11
231,"Good hotel, right in the center of the action","We stayed at Jury's Inn for three nights. A great hotel, clean, and the staff is excellent. I am always concerned about if the beds are comfortable and this bed was great! The breakfast buffet was fabulous, with a lot of selection. It's also super close to the Hop On/ Hop Off buses, as well as city buses. There is a grocery store right across the street, as well as many restaurants and pubs close by. Two things: 1) There is no parking at the hotel. You will need to park your car at a car lot. Jury's Inn has a ten euro a day deal with a local car park but getting to the park is...interesting with all of the construction. 2) We were facing the street, which makes for interesting people watching but also makes for a large amount of noise, as they are in the middle of putting in a rail system. It got quite loud at times.",4,2017,06,10
231,Great location & family vacation,"I would rate this hotel 5 as this hotel is basically around the corner from Dublin's main street, O' Connell Street. All employee were friendly and pleasant.The family room was smaller than expected. Apart from a mix-up with room service meal order, we enjoyed our stay there. The hotel does not have parking but secure parking is available a short walk away at a reduced rate through the hotel. The bar and restaurant are located towards the rear of the hotel which also means you would not know these works are going on. This would be a good central location for sight-seeing in Dublin. There are lots of restaurants and bars close by. Overall it was good.",5,2017,06,10
231,Recommend this hotel,"Great location, facilities are well maintained and clean, staff is extremely helpful.  I have no hesitation recommending this hotel.  I do recommend though that you don't book a room overlooking the strret due to the overnight construction of the new tram rails.  Grt a room that overlooks the inner courtyard which is quiet.",5,2017,06,09
231,Great Location,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of our 10 day trip in Ireland. The hotel room was clean and quiet but we did overhear a few people complaining about the smell in their rooms. The staff was pleasant and accommodating. I was using the hairdryer they provided in the room and it broke on me. When I called for a new one a gentleman showed up quickly to replace it. Unfortunately, this one also broke and again I had to call for another one. The same gentleman showed up to replace it and brought me a brand new one which was great.  For the price we did expect the hotel to be a bit nicer but you really can't beat the location. It is right at the end of O'Connell St and a short walk to many of the cool spots in Dublin. The hotel does validate parking for a discount but the garage that is around the corner takes about 20 minutes to navigate to from the hotel because of the one way streets.",3,2017,06,09
231,An Excellent Experience,"My wife and I stayed here for three days on our Ireland vacation trip. I have to tell you that the staff here are excellent and bend over backwards to serve your every need.

Rebecca was our counter representative both for check-in and for checkout.  She is an excellent listener and a knowledgeable professional. 

Mark, Jessica (Nurse Jessica for me), and Rachel were our incredible servers and attenders. Mark served us our every bar need. Jessica not only waitressed on us, she took care of me with hot water mixed with honey, cloves, and lemon when I came down with a flu. And Rachel was there attending to us at each breakfast.

I heartily recommend Jurys Inn if you plan on staying in Cork.",5,2017,06,09
231,"Centrally located, very convenient","We took the AirLink from the airport to O'Connell Street (12 euros round trip per person), then a short 10 minute walk to the hotel. Very friendly reception staff, always willing to answer questions and offer suggestions. Free daily newspaper at the front desk. Coffee available in the lobby for purchase. We arrived early so stored our luggage with reception until our room became available. We opted for a standard room on the 4th floor with a double bed and a twin bed (not something we're used to, but seems common in Europe). We were in Dublin to celebrate our birthdays - which the hotel unexpectedly acknowledged by leaving balloons, chocolates, and a card in our room. A nice touch, thank you!
There is an option to upgrade to an Executive Suite for 30 euros a night extra, with better views, better wifi, and a king bed. There are 5 floors in the hotel, we didn't feel the need to be one floor higher, but a better view would have been nice. We were over looking the central courtyard, basically just facing 3 brick walls/windows. 
We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room. 2 beds, chair, small table, 25"" TV, coffee and tea making facilities, desk area, hairdryer, iron and ironing board, basic toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash and hand soap). The only amenity we found to be missing was an in-room safe. It did surprise us, we've never stayed at a hotel without an in-room safe. Ample towels were provided (no washcloth). There is a Tesco supermarket across the street to stock up with forgotten items.
The only complaint we have with the room is the lack of a sheer net curtain. The blackout curtains are great for sleeping but not for during the day if you require privacy. But this is minor and certainly doesn't change our opinion of the hotel!
Breakfast is from 7am - 10.30am; offers all the usual European buffet options plus soy (soya) and almond milk and also offer a gluten-free area. Tip: if you are going on a day tour, skip the boxed breakfast, it's terrible, go to Tesco in advance instead.
The gym is located on the same floor as the dining room. We used it a couple of times. It is small but has 3 machines and some free weights. No pool.
We didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening but we did sit in the bar area, very nice, good Irish coffees.
Great location, no issues, very friendly staff, can highly recommend. Feel free to contact me with any questions.",4,2017,06,07
231,"Parking inconvenient, otherwise lovely hotel!","I rate the hotel itself 5 stars - its very quiet (unlike our first hotel visit in Dublin) and comfortable. The breakfast buffet that is included was exceptional, with many tasty options to choose from! Our room, while nothing fancy, is spacious and offers everything needed for a very comfortable stay. My only critique is the lack of onsite parking - you have to park at a lot that is a 7 minute walk from the hotel. Usually that's not an issue, but with luggage and all the construction going on around the area, it made for a harried experience. If traffic allows, drop off your luggage at the front desk then go park your car. That wasn't an option for us, but it would have made a difference had we been able to do so. ",4,2017,06,07
231,Visit to Dublin,"This is a new hotel of good quality. The staff were all pleasant and helpful, We stayed there twice, first in an Executive room and then in a standard. The rooms were the same size but the Executive one was better furnished. The standard room had no safe, and in both cases the beds were comfortable but the pillows like bricks. 
For those wishing to visit the tourist sites it would be better to stay south of the river, although most places are within walking distance.",4,2017,06,06
231,Good city centre hotel,"Stayed here for a couple of nights with family. Decent hotel, small rooms specially for family. Lovely bar and self service breakfast. Convenient for city tours.  Road work to the front of the hotel made it very congested for Taxi's  while stopping or boarding. ",4,2017,06,06
231,Very excellent hotel,I enjoyed my short stay very much. The hotel is very clean. The room was situated in a silent position although there are many sites actually in Dublin. So sleeping was very relaxing. The breakfast was yery good. The staff members are very friendly. The restaurant is pretty looking. The bar is modern and also very pretty. ,5,2017,06,06
231,"Central location, but quiet enough to sleep","Spent 3 nights with my wife in late May. Dublin is a highly walkable city, and this hotel is in a great location to explore pretty much all of downtown without public transportation. Plenty of shops & restaurants nearby, but not as hectic/noisy as Temple Bar. We booked well in advance for a nightly rate of around $200, which did not include breakfast (Anne's Bakery & 2 large markets are within 2 minutes walk). We requested a high floor with a view. We overlooked the ""spire"" and much of downtown. Lower floors look out at brick walls. Wifi was free and adequate. If you're coming from the airport take bus 700 or 747 to O'Connell St. 
We had a standard double room that was rather spacious by European standards. It was clean and well appointed with all of the essentials (soaps, tea, coffee, etc.). All of the staff were friendly and helpful. The lobby has lots of places to sit and watch people. 

2 minor gripes. We arrived at 1pm after a long flight, but were told that our room won't be ready till 3pm (official check-in time). Magically, everyone's room was simultaneously available at 3pm, which resulted in waiting in another queue. Second, kind of our fault -- there is a door sign for privacy on one side and make up room now on the other side. We left the room at 9am and didn't leave out the sign to make up the room. We returned at 5pm and found that our room was not yet done. We were told that they clean till 6:30pm.",4,2017,06,05
231,"Central to all amenities, but overly priced for an average room","Central to all tourist attractions, with friendly helpful staff, the breakfast menu has plenty to choose from but be early, the room which are only average are too overpriced, which are hiked up for sporting or music events. ",3,2017,06,05
231,Very central hotel,"Stayed with 3 friends from 31st May - 2nd June.  Staff very kind, friendly and efficient.  Food tasty and plentiful. A bit busy and confusing at breakfast but plenty of choice, both hot and cold items. A problem with dinner reservation was pleasantly resolved. have stayed before and hopefully will stay again.  Very central position.  Much ongoing road works outside hotel  (which were there when I stayed in 2015!) and show no signs of being completed any time soon.  However you don't come to Dublin to stay in your hotel and this one fits the bill perfectly for sightseeing.  ",4,2017,06,05
231,Excellent,"Nice, modern hotel for a weekend stay. Rooms were spacious and comfortable. The main sell is the location right by Temple Bar. The staff were friendly and helpful. Would happily stay here again in future.",5,2017,06,05
231,"Convenient location, expensive for the quality","This is a basic and regular hotel conveniently located, within walking distance from most part of Dublin visiting targets and a 10 minutes walk from the vibrant Temple Bar. As Dublin City center is rather small, this is valid for most of the hotels though. Basic is also the breakfast served and, somehow, it lacked the attention of the personnel, from the waiting time when you enter the breakfast area and there is nobody at the counter to the annoying malfunction of all the coffee machines (2 days we had only the option of soluble coffee which was horrible), approximate cleaning of the room and bathroom. Most annoying of all however was the bathroom with the strange cold-hot water system at the shower/tub making a decent shower impossible (fixing the water was a real challenge due to their system which keep somehow separately the flow of cold and hot water until it pours on your skin), minuscule tub and lavatory (that was for sure designed for dwarfs and it was a real challenge as well to use them even though we are not very tall), lack of wc brush, fix and bad location of the liquid soap, etc. It was then the lack of any phonic isolation of the room from the other rooms and corridor (you can hear absolutely everything your neighbors are doing and talking and when closing or opening doors is just like they are in your room/corridor noise is similar), no fridge in the room, etc. For the pros, I would mention the front desk personnel, very fast and professional. All in all, we felt a rather low quality for the 250 Euro a night. It is true in the same time that hotels seem quite expensive in Dublin. ",3,2017,06,05
231,"Lovely, straightforward hotel in excellent location","Busy hotel on Parnell Street.  Room was surprisingly quiet, very comfortable and with two beds.  Plenty of space in the room.  Bathroom decor was a bit basic but spotlessly clean and plenty of complimentary toiletries.  Wifi excellent (very fast).  Staff all very friendly, helpful and polite. Breakfasts plenty of choice and nice basic food.  An excellent mid range base for a city break.",5,2017,06,04
231,Lovely location,"We stayed at jury's inn from the 31st may 2017 till the 3rd June.The location is so good that you are on o colonel street which is the heart of Dublin within a minute walk.The temple bar area is also not more than 10 minutes walk where you can enjoy the exciting night life with so many pubs and amazing restaurants.
About the hotel the staffs are very very helpful and the rooms are quite spacious and clean.Good room service.Altogether jury's inn pernell street is a very good choice for people on a holiday to Dublin ",5,2017,06,04
231,Great hotel. Only about 15 minutes from central Dublin.  ,"Our adult son was traveling with us, so we asked for a triple room, which can be hard to find, but they had one available.  Great room, modern hotel with business type amenities, which was fine with us since we weren't in the room that much.  There's plenty around this location, including a Tesco and many shops.  In 15 minutes you can be at Trinity college, and in 25 minutes, St. Stephens Green.  We don't mind walking and the weather was good.  Also helped that by being North of the Liffey, our cab ride to the airport was cheaper.   ",4,2017,06,03
231,Clean and comfortable stay in Dublin,The hotel was a surprise as some reviews have stated it was looking tired.   Although the decor hasn't been updated for a while it didn't detract from a terrific time we had a the hotel.  The room was clean with a very comfortable bed and wonderful pillows.   The restaurant was a highlight with quality food at a very reasonable price.  The staff in both the restaurant and reception were very friend and responsive.  ,5,2017,06,03
231,Great place where to stay in Dublin city center,"Friendly environment, great wi fi connection, ideal to get Dublin city center and walk distance to business places.
Suits fine also for leisure trips being close to most popular places and restaurants in Dublin!",5,2017,06,03
231,The Jury's decision is Inn!,"Super friendly staff, clean and quite rooms, great location. What more can you ask for? We got in late our first night there and as most of the nearby restaurants  were closed, we were told of our room service option for late night food and saved the day. :)",5,2017,06,02
231,Fantastic staff,"We traveled as a couple, and had a wonderful stay. Every member of staff that we were in contact with was absolutely fantastic. Very clean and nice hotel. Walking distance to most things we wanted to see. The staff were able to reccommend us a dinner and riverdance experience, which made our stay even better.",5,2017,06,02
231,Not value for money,"expensive hotel, but no fridge in the room, no handle shower in the bathroom, only overhead
good breakfast
location - at the end of city center, but walkable distance
close to bus stop to the airport, to stops of many local busses and to stops of trips organized by travel agencies",3,2017,05,31
231,Excellent Location ,"Hotel is in an excellent position for sightseeing in Dublin. Close to trams, buses and within walking distance of most of the must see places in the city. 

Staff are friendly and helpful, especially at Reception.

We had a standard room. The bed was smaller than in most hotels so not so comfortable, but the accommodation was of a reasonable standard and very clean.

Food at breakfast was wholesome but the buffet was not adequately maintained so that there was always something missing e.g. wait for eggs or fruit or other foods to be replenished. Tables were not cleared quickly and on one day it was so busy with groups of tours that service could at best be described as chaotic. Had we not paid for breakfast at the start of our stay, after the first experience, we would have used local bars and cafes instead of the hotel.

Will use this hotel again but get breakfast elsewhere.",4,2017,05,31
231,My family's vacation stay.,"We had two rooms, one for us and the other for our teen children. The housekeeping staff who made up our rooms each day were excellent at their job!
The location of the hotel in Dublin was perfect. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,05,30
231,Great hotel.,"Came to the hotel for a family trip for my husbands 30th. 

Hotel was very easy to find right around the corner from the bus stop from the hotel. 

Check in was quick and easy and staff were very friendly. The room was great. Very spacious and clean and easily fitted all 4 of us. The bathroom was great and the bath was low to the floor which was great for the kids. Bed were very comfortable and we all had a greats night sleep. It was nice they had an ice machine just by the lift so we could keep our drinks in the room closed. 

It's was a really nice touch that the hotel lefts a birthday card, balloons and chocolate to wish my husband happy birthday. Very thoughtful. 

There are plenty of shops and Restaurant within walking distance. The Tesco right across the road was great for getting snacks and drinks. 

There is a restaurant right opposites called the Kingfisher and this place was a little gem. Fantastic food and very reasonably priced. We are here a few times it was so good. 

The overall location of this hotel was fantastic and within walking distance of the town and local shopping centres. 

The only slight downside was there were a lot of homeless people around the hotel and a few times they came into the lobby walking around asking us for money. 

Overall however this hotel was great and we would most definitely stay here again. 
",5,2017,05,30
231,My Experience at the Jur's Inn,Overall I had a positive experience. Staff were professional and accommodating. Hotel was clean and presentable. The hotel offers a nutritious breakfast with a variety of options. I would stay at this hotel again and recommend it to others. ,4,2017,05,30

231,"excellent hotel for location, staff, confortable room and breakfast","Very clean, confortable hotel, ideally located for shopping and for walking around the city. Quick internet access throughout the hotel. Friendly staff, extremely courteous and attentive to the needs of customers. Clean, perfectly soundproofed room with good functional facilities (coffee, tea, safe-deposit box). Breakfast abundant, varied and very good.",5,2017,05,30
231,Good stay,"Stayed here for a recent trip to Dublin with my partner. Hotel was great in a good location only a 10 min walk to temple bar. Lots of shops, bars and places to eat in the area. Only downside was the price of the hotel at there pound conversion rate was around 0.9 so worked out abit more than advertised but all in all it was great. Room offered lovely views and we came across no issues during our 3 day stop. ",4,2017,05,29
231,All great,"Hotel is well located, in the centre, some 3 minute walk from the airport bus, some 3 minutes from shopping street and within walking distance to all major tourist sites. Staff was really helpful, and hotel nice, clean and surprisingly quiet, considering its centric location. Bar has a good selection of wines nice nibbles for the not-so-hungry, and great meals for the hungry. ",5,2017,05,29
231,Good Dublin hotel,"Room and bathroom were spacious and clean.  Great location for pubs and restaurants. The buses, including the hop on hop off, were just around the corner.  I would stay here again.   We did not have breakfast or dinner at the hotel so I can't rate those. ",5,2017,05,28
231,Great location,"The hotel is in a great location.  We took the airport bus & it dropped us off 1 block away.  The hotel, our room, the dining room were all very clean.  Bed was very comfortable & room was quiet.  Front desk staff were very friendly & helpful.   We would not hesitate to stay there again in ever in Dublin.",5,2017,05,25
231,vacation stay at jurys inn parnell street,"hotel located in very good location, center of city, less than 5 min walk to 2 shopping malls, farmer market around corner, main street with airport bus ,hop on hop off bus and a lot of other buses block away
 restaurant  KINGFISHER across street, good quality food and not expensive.
TESCO supermarket across street, and LIDL supermarket around corner
Hotel very good, comfortable executive rooms, with fridge and safe, comfortable beds
breakfast good with a lot of food choices, 
Will recommend this hotel for vacation stay in DUBLIN
",5,2017,05,24
231,Final day at Jurys Inn,"Hotel generally very good.
Some problems at breakfast, toaster gives just warm bread, too many people fiddling with controls?
Plates constantly not available, only saw three floor staff with one constantly dealing with new people and tour groups, one clearing tables the other stocking items on bar.
Food quality was generally good.",4,2017,05,24
231,Nice stay,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights in April for a 1st time trip to Ireland.  The hotel was a little outside city center but Temple Bar is an easy 15 minute walk. The area was fine and close to the water.  The one downside is the hotel is hard to locate if you are on public transportation with a great deal of construction going on near the hotel.  The upside is it's right near O' Connell Street which is great to wander along and easy access to all bus stops.  

The hotel itself was nice.  The beds were comfortable and the room had plenty of space.  We didn't have much of a view and there was no make-up mirror.  Make up mirrors are like hairdryers- everyone should carry one.  No breakfast but decent price for the hotel.

Good experience overall and would recommend if you are considering this part of town.

",4,2017,05,23
231,Good location ,"Centrally located, can walk to O'Connell street with tons of shops and places to eat. About 15-20 min walk to temple bar area. Hotel was modern, clean. Good breakfast, staff friendly. Would recommend.",4,2017,05,23
231,Comfortable Inn,"We stayed here for a week and were very comfortable.  The first night we were too warm in our room, but learned how to adjust to be comfortable for sleeping.  We were not in our rooms much as we were out on tours everyday.  However, our room was always clean and ready for us if we returned in the afternoon for a quick rest.  We had the breakfast included in our stay and that was good.  They had a buffet with a nice selection to choose from.  We also had dinner in the restaurant one evening and that was also good.  The food was reasonable and also delicious.  Be warned though, some tours leave early, so we missed breakfast once or twice. The only negative I can think of was there was a lot of road construction going on at the time we were there, so it was a bit noisy and chaotic outside the hotel.",4,2017,05,23
231,Five days in Dublin....,We can recommend the hotel... It's well situated in Dublin with a very nice inside... Good personell and a good Irish breakfast... Just walk around the corner and You're on the manin street... Quite and clean rooms,4,2017,05,23
231,Pleasant stay,"Another pleasant stay in this hotel. Its in a great location and much cheaper than the Christchurch hotel. Very friendly staff and an easy check in/out process. Rooms are always clean, tidy and well maintained.",4,2017,05,23
231,Lovely Hotel !!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"I Would highly recommend to stay here with family and kids
We met our family here and visited Dublin for 2 days, rooms was nice and clean plenty of space lovely little child cot for my daughter.

Nice and quiet not to much noise ,

Definitely will be my first stop to Dublin again!!

Overall excellent hotel and superb trained and friendly staff ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,2017,05,23
231,Nice stay but...,"Nice enjoyable stay but value for money was an issue this time around. We paid €299 for a 1 night stay in a standard room with breakfast. Our was nice had a double bed, TV, dresser and chair, lockers etc. However at the small table there was no arm chair where normally there would have been one in pervious rooms. 
The only issue we had (along with the price) was the fact that our window was a very narrow window which looked directly out onto a wall. There was nothing to look out of and little light. 
This along with the price of the room was very poor value for money.",4,2017,05,23
231,The best one in Dublin,"The hotel was really good with a super-friendly staff and services. I've stayed there for a long time and it was like a home-feeling! Highly recommended for the stay in Dublin, and they also help in suggesting the best city-tours.They also have huge breakfast menu available :)",5,2017,05,23
231,Review of Two Hotels in Ireland.,"Was on a guided tour and stayed at the Juris Hotel in Dublin and Galway.  Both hotels were very nice and comfortable.  Everyone was accommodating and anxious to see that we were happy with our stay. The hotels were in the towns and convenient to places of interest as well as restaurants, if you choose to go out for a meal.  Food at both hotels was quickly served and was delicious.  I would recommend both hotels to everyone.",5,2017,05,22
231,Excellent hotel,Very pleased with the whole experience. Staff friendly and helpful. Hotel very clean and the buffet breakfast was more than adequate. Good location for buses and shopping. Can recommend without any hesitation. Will certainly use Jurys Inn again.,5,2017,05,22
231,Pleasant Stay,"We stayed here for 2 nights recently.
Everything was fine. The room was clean and toiletries supplied. 
Excellent free WiFi. 
Excellent breakfast apart from the fried eggs which were congealed both mornings but plenty of other choices to be had. 
Dinner menu was pretty basic but the food was very good and the wine was reasonably priced which made a nice change from the excessive mark ups in other hotels. 
Close to lots of bars/restaurants and plenty to do and see in the vicinity. 
Temple bar is a 10/15 minute stroll away. 
Roadworks outside the hotel were annoying but the hotel can't be blamed for that. 

",4,2017,05,22
231,Great central location in Dublin City,"Hotel is ideally located for viewing the city centre on foot. Great all you can eat buffet breakfast.
Clean and tastefully decorated. Reasonably priced too.
Car parking close by in Q Park (hotel will validate parking ticket for cheap overnight rate).",5,2017,05,22
231,Lovely Stay and Great location ,"Our second time to Dublin and highly recommend the Jury's Inn Parnell. Everything you need nearby, hundreds of shops and lovely pubs at your doorstep but didn't have any issues with noise at all. Hoho bus just around the corner and our 7am day trip bus to Belfast picked up 5 mins away from Jury's Inn. Walking distance to Temple Bar and St Stephens green. Didn't eat at hotel as the nearby cafés offered a new place to eat every morning with the lovely and friendly people of Dublin.",5,2017,05,22
231,Weekend break,"Excellent location and although a busy hotel the rooms were very quiet 
Accommodation clean I would certainly go back. 
Perfectly situated just off the Main Street walking distance to everything.  Bus from airport stops just around the corner",5,2017,05,22
231,Honeymoom,"Stayed at this hotel because it's ease of access to all locations and the price.  We didn't need any extravagant as we would spend almost all day everyday going around the city.  Great place to stay, very clean, and friendly staff.",5,2017,05,21
231,Had  lovely stay,Check in was very fast and the reception staff were very helpful.  We were allocated a nice quiet room. The room was very clean and very comfortable.  Liquid hand soap and bath gel and shampoo were provided in the bathroom.  An iron and ironing board are available in each room which was very useful.  We ate in the restaurant and although the menu was not huge there was enough choice and the food was very good.  Top marks for presentation.  Starters were particularly nice. Breakfast was buffet style and there was plenty of choice.  Food was of good quality.  Staff in the bar were very attentive as were all the staff and we would certainly stay here next time we are in Dublin.  The hotel is well situated and transport links are very good.  The new tram system is creating some works outside the hotel but this does not affect your stay.,4,2017,05,20
231,"Jurys Parnell square, great location and very clean hotel","Central location with a very secure feel to the Hotel within central city centre location, food excellant in hotel and friendly staff, Very clean Hotel, Dublin in General has it fair share of trouble with unfortunate people who find themselves homeless, and the Hotel deals and supports this very adequetly. which can only be commended. I througherly enjoyed my stay and would recommend this hotel",4,2017,05,20
231,Trip to Dublin,"Just stayed at the Jury's Inn, Parnell Street. Absolutely brilliant. Reception staff, restaurant staff, domestic staff all so friendly and helpful. Ideally located to explore Dublin. Rooms large, clean and tastefully decorated. Would definitely stay again. Mandy Shaw.",5,2017,05,20
231,lovely couple of days here,"staff are friendly and welcoming, the room was nice and clean, bring your own toiletries they have the basics which is probably all you need. food was nice and varied for breakfast and located in the centre so close to cafes, pubs and shops.",5,2017,05,19
231,Short stay,"We stayed here recently for two nights on a short break. 
The reception staff were efficient and check in was fast and smooth. 
Our room was adequate for our stay. It was very quiet which was good. It was very clean. Comfy beds. Good toiletries and towels in the bathroom. 
Excellent breakfast was supplied and the restaurant staff were very friendly and efficient.
The restaurant menu is basic but reasonably priced and the food was very good. The wine was also decently priced which was a bonus as some hotels charge a very high mark up.
The free wifi was excellent which was also a bonus.
It's just a few minutes walk to O'Connell St and about 10-15 minutes walk to Temple Bar. 
There are roadworks outside the hotel and it was annoying having to navigate your way through them, but that's not the hotels fault. 
We would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,05,19
231,Jurys Inns are great!,Stayed for a week at Jurys Inn Parnell Street. The hotel is a great location central to everywhere in Dublin. There are some traffic works out the front but it is not affecting the hotel!!! Great staff who really are there to look after you.,4,2017,05,19
231,Good but noisy,"The hotel is surrounded by tram construction on Parnell and O'Connell Streets not mentioned on website.  Had 2nd floor (244) room next to staff corridor and above trash bins with no view.  Very noisy at night like being above bowling alley.  Room basic as noted by others but with stained, older carpet.  Bathroom fine.  Reception very professional.  Near Ha'penny Bridge, Temple Bar, etc.  Loved staff in bar after long day especially Louise.  Would stay again but request higher floor with middle room.",3,2017,05,19
231,Great location,"Great hotel! Great location. When we arrived we were greeted by very friendly receptionist. All staff in the hotel were helpful, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Rooms comfy and very clean. 
Car park is not on site...about a 10 minute walk from hotel.",5,2017,05,18
231,Good location.  Nice hotel.,"In truth, the construction outside taints the impression a bit, but overall a very nice experience.  Lobby is small, but adequate.  We arrived early from the airport and there was no issue holding our bags for us until room was ready.  Convenient to Temple Bar and shopping with a short walk into town.  Room was a standard double; no frills.  Breakfast was outstanding with a terrific selection of food choices; service was exemplary.",4,2017,05,18
231,Return visit not as good as our first stay...,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel as we were visiting family in Dublin and also flying out the next day.
The Jury's Inn Parnell St is really well located for O'Connell St as it is just around the corner from it. It is also conveniently located a few minutes away from all the airport bus stops (air coach and airline) and the Abbey St stop for the Luas. 
We stayed for one night and were allocated a room on the top floor of the hotel (room 526). Our room was small but well appointed and the hotel had made smart use of the space to be fair. That particular room might not be the greatest though for people with a lot of luggage as the space would be tight then. It comprised all one might have expected: a nice fluffy bed, a nice-size bathroom (our room only had a shower), flat screen TV, a desk as well as small table and a small cupboard for storage, as well as tea and coffee making facilities.
Just around the corner in the corridor, one could also find a vending machine and an ice dispenser, which could have been handy!
We had an ok night stay but that particular room didn't boast the greatest wifi connection as it kept breaking in and out of range. It also seemed that the sound-proofing wasn't the best as we could hear all that was going on in the corridors...
I wouldn't usually comment on this for hotel stays but having stayed at the Jury's Inn Parnell St twice before this was the first time I even noticed this issue; I would therefore think that it is down to this particular room...
We opted for their all day bar food menu for a quick bite after check-in. The bar staff was lovely but as we weren't very hungry, we picked from their sandwich menu and that was a little bit disappointing and on the pricey side for sandwiches with no sides... That said we have had food there before and their 'grill' menu was really good and reasonable.
We also had breakfast at the hotel and their offering was really complete with both Irish breakfast and all sorts of continental choices at the buffet.
Overall we were a little bit disappointed with our stay this time as it didn't compare to our previous experiences.
We will return though as their staff is great and the location is amazing but we would hope for what we have been accustomed to next time.",3,2017,05,18
231,Exceeding our expectations!,"Our recent two night stay at Jury's, Parnell St . for Bob Dylan's excellent concert made my birthday celebrations complete. From our initial welcome at reception to the efficient  competency of housekeeping, catering and managerial staff, this hotel, in my limited experience, exceeds in quality it's 3 star rating (or perhaps others do not meet theirs!) My wife and I left without a single complaint and have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others. (Issues with parking, traffic congestion, construction works etc. are outside the hotel's control)",5,2017,05,18
231,A CITY CENTRE HOTEL  WITH PROFESSIONAL ATITUDE,"I have been visiting Dublin for many years and it is my first time of staying in the Jurys Inn and I am not disappointed with my experience. On arrival the Hotel receptionists were very professional and  also efficient  as I was given my room  in no time at all. This Hotel is served by three very cleaned and maintained lifts/elevators , so there little or no queue waiting for the lifts.
The floors and wall are very clean and well carpeted with no unpleasant odour also with ice machines on each floor..

The air conditioned rooms are very spacious with very comfortable bed, good multiple channel colour HD TV, coffee table, relaxing chairs and writing desk . Hair dryers ironing board and iron is provided. The windows are double glazed and therefore very low noise. There is a free Wi-Fi
The bath is a combination of a very good easy to use shower and a lower bath basin  for those that wants to have a bath. The bath basin is also very low enough for those with disabilities. Most of the toiletries are provided. 

The dinning room  is big with clean furniture and a buffet breakfast and the staff are very professional especially Kieran who always want to assist you and make sure that you are ok without being asked. 

This city centre hotel is not far from the business districts and majors attractions and it served by public transportation. There are also conference facilities and it is a place for both business and pleasure.",4,2017,05,16
231,Great hotel,"Stay here most times we are in Dublin, clean and comfortable. Great location. Beds are amazingly comfy, good breakfast and high level of professionalism from staff. Have never had a bad room whilst staying here, be back ",5,2017,05,16
231,Great Service and Convenient Location,"While not centered in the midst of the tourist sites, Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street is within easy walking distance of the majority of the central Dublin tourist destinations. It lies quite close to O'Connell Street and the hotels, stores and dining it provides.  Some might characterize the location in the city as a bit rough, but my family and I never felt threatened. The rooms are clean and reasonably well appointed. Rooms are slightly small by American standards but large when compared to most accommodations on the European continent. 

But the biggest asset this hotel possesses is the front desk staff.  Everyone I encountered in this position was very helpful and friendly, answering every question I had and gladly assisting in any way possible.  While all the men and women working the front desk delivered fantastic customer service, Hrvoje was particularly helpful and patient.

Traveling to and from the airport is easy.  We took the Aircoach motorcoach which stops on O'Connell Street only 1 to 1 1/2 blocks from the hotel.  Aircoach makes only one stop between the airport and O'Connell Street and is relatively inexpensive. The only negative is the stop is uncovered which might be a problem in inclement weather.",5,2017,05,15
231,Dublin stay for Iron Maiden,Hotel well located for a night out in Dublin. Very clean and tidy. Staff very friendly and attentive. Only hassle was paying. Card machine not working in reception so had to go up to bar to pay bill. Food quality and service in bar excellent. Great breakfast. ,5,2017,05,15
231,Lovely Hotel,Lovely hotel nice staff great service wonderful location for the city easy access to luas bus and train service. highly recommend this hotel for tourists or people going to the o2 Croke park or the aviva or just a trip to Dublin ,5,2017,05,15
231,Perfect location and very good value!,"My husband and I were extremely pleased with our accommodations! The location was in the center of town which made it easy to visit the sites of Dublin and the staff, especially Mia, was most helpful during our stay. The breakfast was delicious and plentiful. I would highly recommend this hotel! ",4,2017,05,15
231,Great Value,This is a very comfortable hotel which is definitely worth the value. The staff very very friendly especially Sandro on reception. The breakfast was good as you had a wide range of food to choose from for breakfast. ,4,2017,05,15
231,Not value for money,"My family of 4 stayed in a room with a double bed and sofa bed.
The staff, foyer, restaurant and bar area are all nice in this hotel and the location is great.

Unfortunately when you enter the hallways and rooms of this hotel it feels like dorm rooms. Our bathroom was very basic, a cheap shower curtain, chipped basin and paint peeling. The room is small and is on the same level as a courtyard area. Unfortunately they don't have that 2nd privacy curtain so it was either open the curtain and let everyone see everything or keep them closed and live in a dungeon.

If we hadn't paid a premium to stay here I wouldn't have cared but the room and the rate did not match.",3,2017,05,14
231,Holiday,"Above standard right in the middle of Dubiln  close to everything 
exceptional hygiene spick and span very impressive 
Restaurant was exceptional food terrific 
Staff were excellent and friendly always went out of their way great stay highly recommend ",5,2017,05,14
231,Birthday Suprise,"This was our first visit to Dublin and was a surprise for my partner for his 50th birthday. We arrived at Jurys Inn on Parnell Street before we were able to check in as our flight was an early one. Upon arrival we were not disappointed at all, the staff were very welcoming and the lady who checked us in was very helpful as I didn't have chance to arrange a birthday cake prior to us leaving home and I asked if it would be possible at such short notice for a birthday cake to be arranged. The lady said to leave it with her and she would try her best to arrange this for me. We were able to leave our luggage at the hotel in a locked room and collect from 2pm onwards as this was the time our room would be ready. Our room was ready just before 2pm and when we opened our door the staff had arranged for balloons, a birthday card, chocolate bar for us each along with a can of pop each and a beautiful birthday cake. I was over the moon with our room, I booked an executive room and it was lovely. Complimentary tea, coffee, sugar, milk, hot chocolate, mineral water, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and a daily newspaper.  It was a struggle to get out of bed each morning as it was so comfortable and all bedding was changed daily when the maid came in and all tea, coffee etc were replenished. When I booked our holiday I also included breakfast and so pleased that I did as it was delicious, vast amount to choose from and as it was a buffet breakfast you were able to help yourself to as much or as little as you wanted. On our last day our flight was late evening and we weren't being collected from the hotel until 6:30pm therefore I asked the day before if it was at all possible to hold onto our room for a little while longer as normal check out is 12 noon.  The gentleman who I spoke with said we may keep our room until 3pm at no extra cost, and after 3pm again lock our luggage away until we were picked up from the hotel. All in all we had a fantastic time and the hotel was just perfect in every way possible and the staff went above and beyond and were simply amazing, thank you so much guys 👍. We will certainly be returning to Dublin and I will defiantly stay with you again 👍",5,2017,05,12
231,Great Location,"This is a great place to stay.  The location is central and near everything important for your stay in Dublin.  The room was quiet, clean and comfortable.  All of the staff throughout the Inn were exceptional and able to respond to questions about Dublin.  I would highly recommend Jury's Inn on Parnell.",5,2017,05,12
231,Good experience,"Overall, we had a good experience at your hotel. Very friendly. Good food. Had delicious dinner. Breakfast good. Comfortable, clean room. Good location for us. Nice and relaxing in bar and restaurant.",5,2017,05,12
231,"If you like confortable beed, Jurys Inn Parnell Street is the best option!","Best mattress ever. Close to the city center. Very nice stuff. Do not doubt It, make a booking right now! 
Although I Lost a booked night because the hotel didn't want to change my booked date, but apart from this, the hotel os really good! ",4,2017,05,11
231,Good stay,"We had a really good time while staying in Jurys Inn.  Very well located, we could walk around and enjoy the city center.
The service in the hotel was great.  Staff very professional, helped us all the time.",5,2017,05,11
231,Great business stay!,"Really enjoyed my stay at Jurys Inn. This location was perfect for my business trip--walkable to my office and many restaurants, shopping, etc. I didn't do any tourist activities on this trip, but was able to get around with very little effort. The hotel was comfortable, clean, and spacious. The shower had awesome water pressure and was very clean. Breakfast was not the best European buffet I've ever seen, but was a very well rounded option. It had a pretty good selection and lots of hot dishes to choose from. I enjoyed my stay here and would use this hotel again for my next trip to Dublin.",5,2017,05,10
231,Convenient and close to the centre,This hotel is on the North side of the river but still in walking distance of the centre.  The hotel itself is a little different. The bathroom was like a lower cost chain hotel but the room itself was quite sophisticated and more elegant. The glazing prevented a lot of noise as there is building work all over Dublin just now and the aircon  kept the  temperature nice. Breakfast was all self service and better than average with black and white pudding and fresh eggs on the hot plates and a good continental selection.  It was cost effective in this area of Dublin and close to the station and transfer to the airport. This is the second Jurys Inn I have stayed at and would stay again. ,4,2017,05,09
231,Dublin Golf Tour with friends,"Easy to go to downtown by walk. Good place to go to courses and back. Noise level from other rooms is not good. Friendly staff behind the desk and in restaurants. Lot of construction works is on going on the street, You need to be carefull when walking around.",4,2017,05,09
231,Fabulous hotel,"Easy walking distance to centre. Rooms very clean and tidy.  Beds very comfortable.  Breakfast just what you need after a night out in Dublin!! Staff so very helpful and friendly and the fragrance when you walked into the foyer was gorgeous.  Really couldn't ask for anything more, except another weeks stay.....although my liver might disagree!  Thanks again for a great stay, would highly recommend to others.",5,2017,05,09
231,Chris,Excellent hotel in a central location. All the staff are friendly and most helpful.  The bar food was first class and good value for money.  My only grumble was that the breakfast buffet was not very warm.,5,2017,05,09
231,The Best..,"Excellent location, lovely staff and rooms clean and very comfortable we enjoyed our stay so much we stayed at Jury's Inn in Galway as well....the service and staff there were wonderful, excellent location overlooking the bay and in the heart of Galway... loved our stay here too...",5,2017,05,08
231,Short break,"Great hotel friendly staff .highly recommend  the open top city tour which is a great way to see the city and you can hop on and off as you like 
The staff at the hotel are friendly and  helpful which only improves your stay ",5,2017,05,08
231,Modern clean central hotel,"We stayed for 1 night in two triple rooms. Hotel very central and just around the corner from the airlink bus stop to the airport. All the staff were very polite and always helpful. Room clean and had everything we needed. Breakfast was buffet style and had lots of choice. Hotel was very close to Henry Street where we like to shop. Will definitely return.

",5,2017,05,08
231,RELAXING STAY,Staff friendly and professional. Very comfortable beds and clean rooms. En suite had shower and bath but my only gripe was that there was no soap at bath level it was only at shower level.  Breakfast was lovely with lots of variety. Evening meal was also excellent. Location was good for shopping and sight seeing.,5,2017,05,07
231,A friends weekend away,"A lovely hotel to spend with friends, I was with my partner and friends.  We had breakfast included which was splendid, very close to the hop on, hop off buses and walk-able to Temple Bar and the river Liffey.  There were lots of Hen and Stag parties, but I couldn't hear them from our room, which faced the main road, also not able to hear the traffic or noise.",5,2017,05,06
231,Exceptional !,"Everything was sooo good about our stay.
Staff friendly,and helpful.
Extra details e.g security, cleanliness,  beds  pillows comfortable, struck me. This is not always the case that every detail is A1 when staying away from home.
The breakfast could not have been better. Such a range, catering for all ! Dinner was so perfect too. Staff  obliging and thoughtful. I definitely recommend this hotel, when on a visit to Dublin.",5,2017,05,05
231,Basic - not value for money,Good location - in heart of city - building work being carried our on footpath in front of hotel at present - but noise not noticed in bedrooms - friendly staff - only fault I would find with this hotel is that the bathrooms could be doing with a revamp - for the price paid I would have expected higher standard but this is City centre so this supposedly justifies the price ! Also key cards required to access main bar area which not great if meeting for business/or friends - average/nothing special on offer  ,3,2017,05,05
231,Good Location,"Excellent stay. Comfortable beds. good location (apart from all the work thats going on but can't be avoided)
Maybe miss breakfast. absolute chaos in the restaurant. noone showing you to vacant tables so at busy time a lot of people wandering around restaurant trying to find a vacant table. Very slow to replenish food/drink on the buffet so a lot of hangining round. hence holding on to your table for longer than was actually neccessary.",4,2017,05,05
231,Good experience,"Located very close to Dublin city center offers great service in everything and everything. The staff were very friendly, helpful and friendly. Highly recommended if you want to visit the city of Dublin on a weekend. ",5,2017,05,05
231,Regular stay,"Hotel is good, standard is typical of this price range, parts of the hotel could do with a spot of maintenance and decorating but doesn't stop me staying here frequently. Breakfast is up there with the best of them and that's partly why I return so often. Good bar and apparently a good restaurant, although I cannot comment on that personally.",4,2017,05,04
231,Anniversary,"Myself & my boyfriend stayed here for our anniversary, we just spent one night in town. The hotel itself is very welcoming from the team on reception. The room was clean & comfortable. We had a drink in the bar which was really relaxing & modern. We didnt eat in the hotel itself but the restaurant seemed busy both evening & for beeakfast. Would stay again.",5,2017,05,03
231,The price is right and the location is good!,"If you want to be on the north side of Dublin and you're looking for a budget hotel, this is a great place. It's clean, relatively quiet and a great bargain. The breakfast buffet is huge and packed -- get there early or you'll be eating breakfast with tons of families and noisy kids. The hotel is super easy to get to from the Dublin airport - just take the AirCoach #700 (get the roundtrip ticket to save some €), get off at the Gresham Hotel stop, then walk~ 5 minutes and you're there. The room was clean, small, and a little bit dated but everything worked and it was quiet. The daily service was good. The staff at the front desk and breakfast buffet were pleasant and helpful. Overall a good budget accommodation in you're in Dublin.",4,2017,05,03
231,Dublin,"Room was spacious and clean , WiFi fast and reliable. Beds are comfortable enough with nice sheets. Bathroom and shower is very good.
 Staff are lacking experience,Food below par for a place like that . Starter was salty to my taste when tried to ask for a main dish I was told off because I asked for less salt in my food. That was a put off.
Laundry staff was rude and shouted at us to hurry up because he wanted to use the lift we are in, This was shocking.
Nice place, shame though to have such experience.",3,2017,05,03
231,Birthday Weekend,"Good hotel in a central location, nice big room. Very clean. Breakfast extra at 10 euros each but good selection. Helpful staff, couldn't do enough for us.
Close to bus stops, shops, bars etc. Would stay there again.",4,2017,05,03
231,Lovely Hotel,Nice hotel but lots of roadwork's outside so taxi had to stop down the road - no big deal just worth mentioning.  Inside of hotel fine and no problems with room or service.  Only had breakfast but no complaints.,5,2017,05,03
231,Good place to stay in Dublin,All hotels are expensive in Dublin but for 90 pounds a night it was good quality. Just round the corner from the airport bus stop both arriving and departing and also the green Dublin Hop on Hop off bus. So that was good. The whole of Dublin is subject to road works due to tram lines going in and it was right outside our hotel however we asked for a room around the courtyard and heard no disruption from the front at all. Breakfast was worth the 10 euros fresh and plenty of it and the Bar was nice and reasonably priced. ,4,2017,05,02
231,Nice quality hotel,"The breakfast was wonderful with nice friendly staff. The hotel was comfortable and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. The location was great for city sightseeing. We stayed two days but would have liked to stay longer. Very impressed with food,staff and quality.",5,2017,05,02
231,Weekend get away,"Stayed here for bank holiday weekend as attending a concert in 3 arena. This hotel is just off O'Connell street so very handy to shopping area. When we arrived we walked to the hotel from Connolly train station which is about a 10 minute walk if you cross the road and go straight down Talbot street which brings you straight out onto O'Connell street opposite the GPO, turn right then turn left at the bottom of the road, the hotel is just up about 100 yards on your left.  The hotel was clean and tidy and very friendly, good value for money, breakfast is buffet style. We used the luas to get about. The closest stop is abbey street which is back up O'Connell street really easy to find. Buy tickets at the machine. From abbey street to the 3 arena which it at the point stop it cost 2.40 euro one way for adult takes about 15 mins to get there. We also visited kilmainham goal and was same price to get to this stop and takes about 25 mins. There is a walk if about 10 mins to the jail but worth it. All in all excellent location very central. Oh once the luas is finished there will be a even better connections and closer stop To this hotel. ",5,2017,05,01
231,A great Hotel,"The hotel staff were very helpful, polite & friendly. The rooms were very clean & the beds were extremely comfortable. They catered well with gluten free food & the restaurant staff were brilliant. Our stay was good & would highly recommend staying here. Also in a good location to walk to all the shops & sightseeing places. Thank you for a great weekend.",5,2017,05,01
231,Short Stay,"Stayed for one night whilst attending a concert in the 3Arena. Hotel was perfect - comfortable, clean with very friendly staff. The 3Arena is a distance away and cost €15 in a taxi. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious. Very secure - key cards need to be used to gain access.  Only a 15 minute walk to Bus Aras. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,04,30
231,Dublin visit,"A fantastic hotel located just off the main thoroughfare down through Dublin. Very clean with friendly, helpful staff. Breakfast was very good with advice being given as to the quiet time to eat. The one bar meal we had was wonderful and very good value for money. We would definitely stay here again",5,2017,04,30
231,Luke review,"very pleasant stay. staff very kind and welcoming, great location. the bedroom was perfect and the staff cleaned it up very well. i most definitely stay again. i will also tell my friends and family to ",5,2017,04,28
231,Fabulous breakfast.,"So, here we are in Dublin and our view is of a garbage truck parking area. I like having the drapes open in my room - gives me a feeling of more space but the view is depressing.  If there were sheers on the window at least I could close those and still have the light.  There seems to be perfume piped throughout the building.  This is unfortunate as I happen to have an allergy to perfume.  The room is very nice.  Very clean and spacious.  There is a large desk with a very comfortable chair and a small table in one corner. My husband asked for a second chair and they brought it right up.  The bathroom has a shower and tub.  All in all the room is very comfortable.  The free wi-fi works fine during the daytime when most are out taking in the sights.  In the evening and at night it is impossibly slow.  You can pay for premium (I did not so I can't say if it it worth it).  There is a breakfast available that is excellent.  All very fresh and plentiful.  The eggs come sunny side up and scrambled and there is many kinds of meats, cheese, bread, fruit, and beans!   Lovely, lovely meal.  The staff have been very helpful when we checked in making suggestions as to what to see and how to get places.  Honestly, if not for the garbage trucks view, the perfume being piped through air ducts, and slow as molasses wi-fi  this would be an excellent place to stay.",3,2017,04,28
231,Dublin Stay,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights as we planned a short visit to Dublin. I would recommend staying in this hotel as it is perfectly located to most of the major landmarks Dublin has to offer. It's convenient to get transport to and from the airport and has plenty of bars/restaurants all with walking distance.
Although we arrived early as check in isn't till 2pm they were happy to keep our bags until the room was available whilst we went exploring. Check in was easy and the staff very attentive.
The rooms are clean, tidy and comfortable.
Dublin seems to be undergoing a lot of building work currently and there was builders right outside the hotel but the noise didn't affect our stay.
All in all a nice hotel to use during our visit and we would definitely return if back in Dublin.",5,2017,04,27
231,Lovely hotel!,Me and my husband were in Dublin for our anniversary trip and spent 3 nights at this hotel. Great location for tourists! Close to most of the biggest tourist attractions! Clean and neat! Very helpful staff! Great breakfast! ,5,2017,04,27
231,Fantastic midterm sent in the capital!,"We took our son on his first proper city break to Dublin,  initially we were worried that he'd still be a little young.  We had the most amazing time our son had a list of thinGS he wanted to do we spent our first day at the zoo and we were so lucky it was a warm sunny day and therefore could enjoy all that was on offer.We checked into our hotel that evening  and had our evening meal there. We had planned to enjoy the open bus tour to help us plan what sights we wanted to visit and I must say the bus trip was one of our sons highligts the staff we're great with him and highfiving  him and asking about his adventures, we used the original hop on hop off tour and we learnt a little something extra on each trip. Our top sights included Dublinia, Guiness store house, Trinity and Kilmainham jail .",5,2017,04,27
231,A Special Place for Us,"This will be my 1000 review on Trip Advisor,my wife and I travel a lot especially since we reached our golden years.This review has been put off because of the circumstances but deserves the 5 stars and a lot more.We were staying at the Jurys Inn on the last night of a 3 week vacation thru out Ireland.As we walked back to the hotel we got an urgent message of a family tragedy back home in the states.The management and staff, one young lady in particular whose name I do not know,helped and stayed with me and my wife to early the next morning,she worked non stop to get us an earlier flight back to N.Y. and got a member of the clergy to come by and stay with us at at our time of need. We left quickly and in our state of mind never got a chance to thank them,but it would be impossible for any hotel in the world to provide any better service!The people who stepped up and assisted my wife and I know who they are and may God bless them.Thank You!",5,2017,04,26
231,Good stay 👏🏻,"Stayed here for 2 nights while having a weekend in Dublin 🇮🇪

We got a taxi 🚕 from the airport, for around €25, there are probably cheaper means of travel 🚌🚆 however we just opted for a taxi.

Room was not ready as we arrived early, (not sure of you could ring prior and ask if it could be ready earlier or not) but we left our luggage in the very secure luggage room 🔐👜

When we did get to our rooms they were clean, tidy and to a high standard. Bed was comfy and had a good nights sleep 😴👌🏻. TV, desk, ironing board and hair dryer all included 👍🏻

Bathroom was of a good size and again was cleaned well 🛁🚿💫 there were complimentary shower gel / shampoo ect to use 👏🏻 and plenty of fresh towels.

The hotel is well located, 5 mins walk from a street full of shops/food/cafes, and 15mins to the Temple Bar area across the bridge.

We had a few drinks in the bar one night, the staff were friendly and there was ample room to sit down 🍺🍸.

I liked how safe this hotel felt 👮🏼‍♀️🛂. You had to use your room card to access the lifts, and at night when returning there was a security guard on the door who would confirm your name and room number, excellent safety measures 👏🏻.

Reception helped when we asked typical 'touristy' questions 🗺 and you can also change currency here (although probably not the best rate, but it's an option if you need to). 

Hassle free check out 👌🏻

Would stay here again 👍🏻",4,2017,04,26
231,Anniversary stay,"Roadworks all day and all night , nearly £300 for 2 nights in executive room with constant noise, nice hotel but while roadworks are on I would not go back until finished as could not have window open due to the smell of the tar, the constant work vehicles beeping , not a nice relaxing time as hoped for",1,2017,04,26
231,super,We had a very good week service and breakfast nothing wrong I advise this hotel to spent a nice time in the city of Dublin Hotel very well located close to the city center Hôtel très bien situé proche du centre ville très propre personnel a notre écoute la gentillesse petit déjeuner très copieux en bref rien a reprocher    ,5,2017,04,26
231,a very plaisant stay,"all was perfect, thank you !
we spend a very good time, the staff was really friendly and the bedroom very nice. The bed was perfect, just a problem with our Neighbors who shouting a lot and that we heard at midnight every day (but the problem is this kind of people who are not corrects)",5,2017,04,25
231,A nice weekend with my husband,"The hotel is located very central of Dublin. It take less then 15 minutes to reach most of the tourist attractions
The breakfast buffet had more to offer then I expected from an Irish breakfast
The hotel staff were very helpful when we wanted  to book tickets to an event and also to give tips of places to visit during our stay.
",5,2017,04,25
231,Perfect location for families,"From the booking to check-in to breakfast, everything was efficient and done with a smile. The staff here were faultless. The bedroom was spacious even with 2 adult and 2 kids, and wasn't too hot or cold. The hotel in centrally located and only a short walk from the suggested public carpark, and only a 10 minute walk from Temple Bar area. We will definitely use this hotel again",5,2017,04,24
231,Noise,"Did not get any sleep with the noise coming from heating system ,which was located in the corridor ,everything else was ok ,staff were excellent, stayed in this hotel before and didn't have any problems.so disappointed ",2,2017,04,24
231,Fantastic Hotel and Location,"The rooms are extremely spacious and comfortable.  The location in the shopping district is close enough to walk to most locations but is quiet at night.  The staff is always extremely helpful, friendly and goes above and beyond.  I highly recommend paying for the breakfast at the hotel, it is well worth the cost.",4,2017,04,24
231,2 Night Trip to celebrate daughter's 18th Birthday,"Our party had two rooms which were spacious and clean . I advised the hotel that we were celebrating a special occasion and my daughter was delighted to receive balloons , card and cake on arrival . We had breakfast both days which was reasonably priced and a huge selection . Location is 15 mins walk from Temple Bar (if that is where you want to go !?!) . Staff throughout the hotel were excellent . Would definitely stay again",5,2017,04,24
231,Great hotal and loacation.,"Our experience was very good, excellent rooms and service.  It was a great location for catching public transportation and tour buses.  Also near shopping and pubs.  The staff was helpful and friendly.  We came back from an event very late, 1 AM and we were happy to see security checking guests back into the hotel.",5,2017,04,24
231,Nice but terrible experience,"The staff who were attending the restaurant was nice and very observant. BUT! The Kitchen was a terrible mess, it was on God Friday and we think the cook was drunk or worse. We waited three hours, and we didn't´t get anything more than a small starter to eat! Worst experience ever!!!",5,2017,04,24
231,Inadequate service,"The location is ok, not in the noisiest parts but close to some brilliant bars and restaurants and only €10 in a taxi to temple bar (if you want to visit). Sadly we were there when the entire city was having roadworks done but this can't be helped. 

We booked three rooms for 8 of us. The staff who I spoke to on the phone during the days leading up to check in were so helpful and they gave us rooms next to each other which was great. 

The rooms weren't amazing. So few plug sockets for a room with three people. Also only two towels provided, had to ask for an extra and then they took them the next day and once again gave us only two. It's not difficult.... 
Also the card keys kept failing. Constantly we would get back and not be able to get in and have to go back down. Was bordering on ridiculous by the end of it. 

Also, with Dublin (for I've never experienced this in any other seat), after 11pm they lock the doors and you have to give your name to the doorman. This we were made aware of and it wouldn't have been a problem had he been more efficient. We had 8 guests and some of them would go back earlier than others and yet those who were returning later constantly found themselves having to provide ID (room keys weren't enough) because he couldn't tick off the right people. Four times I had to give him my room number and then show him my ID because he couldn't understand. Luckily I was the group leader so knew all of the guests names and room numbers but one of the girls had to call me to come down because he wouldn't let her in. I just don't see why it has to be so difficult. I get the reasons for it but it isn't managed well enough. ",3,2017,04,24
231,Excellent!,Great place to stay for location right at the top of O' Connell St. The staff were so helpful and couldn't do enough to make sure out stay was enjoyable. I overate on both mornings because the breakfast had such good variety! The room was airy and clean and the bathroom facilities matched the quality of the bedrooms. Can't praise the staff enough. I gave 'value for money' four stars only because Dublin as a whole is expensive but we actually bought a package so I don't know how much actually went to Jury's Inn. ,5,2017,04,24
231,Jury for family,Over all our visit was fine although I was dissapointed that our request for ajoining rooms with our young family was ignored even although we had been assured it was noted and would happen. Also the family room was cramped and only suitable for 2 adults and 1 child as it had a sofa bed not 2 singles. Also the road works outside the hotel were quite off putting (Not the hotels fault) however the cost of our stay was expensive and compared to other hotels could have at least included a breakfast.,3,2017,04,24
231,perfect stay,"We felt very comfortable in the Hotel, the breakfast was very good und had a big choice of different offers. Your whole staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms and public rooms were very clean. The situation of the hotel is ideal for all excursions in and beyond the town. ",5,2017,04,24
231,Great for business,"consistently good service and great location, breakfast buffet is good and so are the options and portions for dinner. There is a gym which could do with some TLC but outside of that I am usually satisfied with my stay",4,2017,04,24
231,Best stay in Dublin's heart,"Stay right in the heart of Dublin in an exceptional hotel. We got a spacious room, the beds were royal and smelled of honey and milk (this is a metaphor). Had a wonderful sleep. The bathroom was roomy and very comfy. The staff was very helpful and friendly.",5,2017,04,24
231,A experience to repit,"Very well good location, very friendly staff, spacious and clean rooms, good breakfast. I will strongly recomend it to friends and  family. The stay was really confortable and we hope to come back in a short future",5,2017,04,24
231,Girls weekend ,This hotel is a perfect location for a city break. Close to all the amenities but tucked nicely away from the mayhem.  Rooms were clean and extremely comfortable and the staff were amazing and really helpful.  Booking again for later in the year ,5,2017,04,23
231,"Great Hotel, Great Location","My wife and I have just returned from a short break to Dublin staying in the Jurys Inn Parnell Street.
The hotel is ideally situated in Parnell Street at the top of O'Connell Street and about a 5 minute walk from the ""Spike"".
The hotel staff are very friendly and welcoming and the rooms are very clean and well appointed as well as being very quiet.
If you are staying on a room only basis the Buffet Breakfast costs only 10 Euro per person. For this you get a full hot and cold Breakfast selection which really sets you up for the day and is of superb quality.
If you are flying into Dublin take the Airlink transfer bus as dropping off and picking up stops are only a couple of hundred yards from the Hotel.
We would certainly stay at Jurys Inn Parnell Street again and would recommend it to anyone.
John Simpson",5,2017,04,22
231,Visiting Dublin and sorroundings,"We like a lot the hotel. We think it´s a good option in this area to reserve and stay. Very central, well conditioned, modern, people friendly, etc. 
If we return to Dublin, we would probably stay at the same hotel. ",5,2017,04,21
231,Welcoming and comfortable,"Upgraded on arrival - so that was a good start :-)  Reception welcoming, and room very nice and comfortable; everything that I needed.

Breakfast wasn't very well organised - tables not set for breakfast, so you have to go up and forage for cutlery, napkins etc before you even start.  But other than that there was a good range of food available.",4,2017,04,21
231,Good Job.,"My wife and I recently stayed in this hotel during a short trip to Dublin. The hotel and rooms are clean and tidy and surprisingly noise free for a city centre location. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Although there is no on site car parking, the hotel has a special arrangement with one of the multi storey car parks which is only 5 minutes walk. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and will likely stay in it in the future.",5,2017,04,21
231,Great Location,"We had a 3 night stay here in March this year and couldn't have picked a better place to stay in our eyes. As mentioned by other review writers the rooms are spacious enough with a decent sized bathroom. We didn't have the best view from our room but really who goes away just to gaze out their hotel window. The staff are fantastic and great with recommendations on attractions and restaurants. Cost of the accommodation is very reasonable as well. All the way from Australia, we think and hope to be back again one day.",5,2017,04,20
231,"Great location, excellent value","Great location in the center of the city right next to O'Connell Street, and perfect for catching the airlink bus to the airport! would highly recommend. There was some road works going on right in front of the hotel, but that didnt affect our sleep as it was only during the day and we could not hear it from the room. ",4,2017,04,20
231,Friendly and comfortable in the city,"Ideal city location with everything only just around the corner, very welcoming and friendly staff, breakfast top class with something to suit everyone's needs and rooms very comfortable and very clean",5,2017,04,20
231,Lovely place to stay,I loved my stay in this hotel I have already booked to stay here with a friend to do some Christmas shopping in November great shopping around and a great hotel with friendly staff and lovely  rooms would definitely recommend ,5,2017,04,20
231,Excellent!,"Very central location, a great place to stay. More detailed information about the location of the car park prior to our visit would have been helpful but other than that everything was great.  Would recommend.",4,2017,04,20
231,great place in good location,Had a lovely stay at the Jury's Inn. The rooms were clean and cosy.Nothing was ever too much trouble for any of the staff and felt very secure with the key card feature need to get to any floor. The restaurant and bar staff were very attentive. reception were very helpful and would always help with any enquiry. Safe deposit boxes in the lobby were a great idea and free to use for guests. It was a great location to visit places and hop on buses stopped just around the corner. Shopping centre was also close by.,5,2017,04,19
231,A bit better than expected ,"Room was reasonably spacious.  Double bed and room for a double sofa, coffee table and single chair. We stayed at the back side of the hotel which was quiet, with double glazing and another sliding glass sheet to keep out any noise.  Noise can be heard from the hallway through the door, but adjacent rooms seemed quiet. Good sized ensuite with bath and powerful shower. Everything clean. Even had a decent view over the back streets of dublin! Staff were very good, helpful and pleasant. Especially a lady at reception who helped us out with a few things. 2nd floor bar was nice if you wanted to stay in. We didn't stay for drinks or food tho, but we did get breakfast, which was excellent.  Large buffet with all the fried options, including black and white pudding. Loads of cereals, fruit, even smoothies and fruit yoghurt mixes. Location was great, really central,  just off O'Connell street. Couldn't fault it. I would stay there again.  ",4,2017,04,19
231,Family trip,"I was very disappointed with my visit to this hotel the room was like a cupboard hiddden away on its own with no view and the room was very basic . The location of this hotel is quite good though. I wanted to treat my daughter to a nice hotel for her birthday as we spent the day shopping and thought we were going back to a nice room but unfortunately it wasn't .dont think I would stay in this hotel again😕
",2,2017,04,18
231,Fantastic Easter Break,"This is a very very good Jury Inn. Great location, very clean wth great food. There was an issue with under staffing in the restaurant on Good Friday (no pubs open in Dublin). This was a management issue but the ground floor staff did more than their best to cope. I would recommend this hotel.",5,2017,04,18
231,Nice hotel on the edge of the city center,"Decent sized room with a double and single bed that slept 3.  Bathroom was large but didn't have much shelf space.  The hotel is located at what I would consider the northern edge of the city center.  There are plenty of shops nearby, there's a Tesco directly across the street and a convenience store on the corner.  There is an indoor mall on the next block and a pedestrian shopping street about a block away.  It is located on the north side of the Liffey, about a block or so away from the GPO on O'Connell Street, which is the main north/south thoroughfare through the city center. Many of the tour buses leave from O'Connell street which is a short walk from the hotel.  It's about 10-20 minute walk to get to most of the tourist spots on the south side of the Liffey, such as Temple Bar, Trinity College, Grafton Street, etc.",4,2017,04,18
231,Perfect city hotel,"Perfect location and extremely comfortable and clean rooms. The beds were so comfortable.
The staff were very friendly and helpful
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in Dublin. ",5,2017,04,18
231,Good clean and spacious rooms in the perfect location.,"Everything was perfect but we didn't book for dinner on a busy night and were turned away.  So be warned - make sure you have a table booked in advance.
Otherwise, the service was outstanding and it was the utmost pleasure to stay here.",5,2017,04,18
231,A visit to Dublin,"Our stay at the Jurys Inn Parnell Street was excellent. The staff are sympathetic and always attentive to our needs. 
The hotel is very clean and the central location, makes it easy to visit the most important parts of the city
If I return to Dublin this is where I will stay.
",5,2017,04,18
231,Hotel was fantastic,We stayed in the hotel on Wednesday and Thursday if last week for the ed sheeran concert. The hotel was absolutely great. Very clean and very trendy. And the fact the bar is on the second floor I felt was great as the public have no way to enter so it's exclusive to the hotel guests. The rooms were great and staff brilliant. Also the location is brilliant as we were able to walk to everywhere. Thanks,5,2017,04,18
231,Amazing,"I'd stay again in this hotel. It's very close to a lot of interesting things. 
The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and the personal of the hotel very friendly!!!!
A big yes if you want something good",5,2017,04,18
231,superb,"Jurys Inn was a well run friendly hotel. We wouldn't normally stay in a chain hotel but this one was right in the centre of Dublin so perfect for a short visit. The staff were excellent and could not have been more attentive. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.
",5,2017,04,18
231,"Good Location, nice stay","Nice hotel, was clean and the staff were helpful when asked to move rooms (only moved due to road works outside our bedroom window). Beds were very comfy and had a decent bar. We didn't eat in the hotel, as there are so many restaurants nearby. For me the hotel was in a perfect location, close to everywhere but quiet enough to get a good night's sleep.",4,2017,04,18
231,"Great location, brilliant breakfast ","Stayed here last week, parked in Q park which was 10€ for 24hrs. Great location off the street from O'Connell st.  Street under construction, so while unsightly it did not effect hotel. Rooms soundproof. Rooms small when sofa set up for family accommodation but beds very comfortable. Really enjoyed breakfast, lots of tasty option, love to go back. Only down side distance from car park 
",4,2017,04,17
231,Recent Stay,Hotel was very good.    Picked this location because we scheduled a tour that left at 6:30 a.m.  Was in a very convenient location to meet the tour bus.  When we went to Temple Bar area was a short taxi ride and always easy to get a taxi.  The only complaint is there is no parking garage for your car.,4,2017,04,17
231,Great location ,"Hotel is very central, very welcoming staff and good value for money. Can't fault this hotel at all everything perfect 10/10 all round. Didn't eat in the hotel but if the food is anything like the rest I'm sure it can only be good.",5,2017,04,17
231,"Great Location, Great Breakfast","We stayed here on a bus tour of Ireland.  It was a nice room, clean, large with good internet.  The breakfast was a ""Full English Breakfast"" and it was really great.  It was an easy walk to Trinity College, the Old Town, and the Guinness Storefront.  They were nice enough to store our luggage after checkout so we could explore the city.  We were two adults and two children and our room was just the right size for all of us.",4,2017,04,16
231,Lovely Hotel,"Stopped here while daughter attended World Irish Dancing Champs. Really nice room, really helpful friendly staff, great breakfast choice of everything hot, cold juice smoothies, great location, nice bar, would recommend it to anyone.

231,Central location,"Located just off O'Connell street, central Dublin. Easy access to all city points of interest, on foot or via city 'hop on hop off' buses.
Staff are friendly and helpful, wether on reception or any other area of the hotel. 
Bar and restaurant food was very tasty and reasonably priced for the quality.
Security was top notch, made us feel very safe for a central city area. 
The room had normal hotel room facilities, the beds in the family room were very comfortable. I would recommend staying in this reasonably priced hotel.
The only negative was a wait for the room on arrival.",4,2017,04,15
231,Hen party,We stayed in this hotel while at my granddaughter hen party we would all highly recommend this hotel it's in the right place for walking to all the restaurants and bars.

231,Fantastic location & friendly staff!,"Great location and spotlessly clean, comfortable hotel. Staff were friendly & helpful. Check in and check out was simple.

231,Ian Banks,Good hotel well positioned near Moore st mall and Temple Bar. Friendly service.excellent lifts and very comfy bed which is very important. The bar was pleasant and the room not bad. I've had better bathrooms as no bench room. Only real complaint was the tv reception on movie channel. ,4,2017,04,14
231,Best hotel in Dublin,Ideal location staff so friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble couldn't fault this hotel at all food was excellent will definitely be going back and highly recommending to everyone that I know ,5,2017,04,14
231,Great customer service,"Phenomenal breakfast and wonderful customer service! Location is grand also, right in the midst of everything. The hotel bar is nice too and the hotel takes great security measures to keep guests safe.",5,2017,04,13
231,"Central, clean, welcoming hotel",The hotel is right in the centre of Dublin in walking distance from many of the interesting attractions of the town including both cultural venues and shopping.  Booking was easy and the room was clean and attractive.,4,2017,04,13
231,What a weekend at the Jury's Inn,Very warm welcome awaits you at the Jury's Inn to our wonderful weekend. Very friendly & helpful Staff all round. Superb breakfast. Brilliant Location. What a Birthday weekend for my wife in Dublin and what a great City. It was full on but very enjoyable from start to finish.,5,2017,04,13

231,Jurys inn,"Good over all experience. The couple next door had loud sex, so it wasn't't just me that had a good time.

Nice place to stay, nice food, clean and good Guinness. The card system is a bit of a pain and the elevators sometimes go the opposite direction of where you want to go.",5,2017,04,11
231,Great stay in Dublin,as usual very clean friendly and helpful staff in the heart of the city so great for getting around the local area. close to many attractions and great transport links to the surrounding area and access to the Phoenix park for quiet time,5,2017,04,11
231,Dublin weekend,Hotel is well situated and easy reach of the main bus lines 2 minute walk away . Helpful staff and very clean hotel . The coach back to the airport again was around the corner and coaches came every 15 mins . ,5,2017,04,11
231,GREAT VALUE CITY CENTRE HOTEL,"Jury's inn Dublin Parnell Street nice city centre hotel perfect for visit to Dublin.  Minutes from O'Connell Street and so easy for coaches to and from airport. Plenty of choice at breakfast. Only 10 minutes easy walk to Temple Bar, shops and attractions.",5,2017,04,10
231,Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell street,"It was my first experience with this hotel group. Overall, everything was Ok. Location is pretty central, easy walking distance to anywhere, 3 minutes walk from no 16 bus stop from/to the airport. No need to take a taxi or airlink. Reception desk people are nice and helpful. Beds are very comfy. Breakfast is average, you can order poached eggs free of charge. If you order something, be prepared to wait. Room rates seem too high, compared to Edinburgh for instance. In my opionin, the hotel lacks charm and personal touch.  Rooms need a facelift. Overall, it was the best offer we could get in Dublin. ",4,2017,04,10
231,Another enjoyable stay in Dublin,Stayed at Jury's on Parnell Street in Dublin which I believe to a great location if staying in Dublin.  Rates are quite high if you don't get an offer and I feel breakfast should be included or offered at a more reasonable rate but can't complain about the comfort and cleanliness of the room or the hotel.  Roadworks were noisy quite early but I don't blame the hotel for this.,4,2017,04,10
231,Unexpected Stay,"Due to change of meeting site I had an unexpected overnight in Dublin.  It was easy to book this hotel.  Jury's staff were most helpful with information on car-parking and with managing a late arrival.  I had a very quiet, restful and peaceful night.  I was checking out early, before breakfast, and was given a breakfast bag and had my parking ticket attended to.  The staff were knowledgeable, very friendly and helpful throughout.",5,2017,04,10
231,3 night stay,Stayed 3 nights bed and breakfast. Room very clean and tidy. Breakfast - good choice - staff friendly and helpful. Bar staff very friendly and open to chatting if sat at the bar .

231,Great location ,"This was a lovely hotel, great location, comfortable beds and lovely staff from reception to the bar. I didn't eat in the hotel but the bar area was lovely. The staff where very helpful in telling us where everything was in Dublin giving us a map of the area and outlining the places we wanted to visit.

231,Good hotel.,"Nice clean hotel,great location for shopping,cinema,theatre etc.good room with little if any noise,which ensured a good nights sleep.a nice lounge to have a drink and unwind in the evening,and a most pleasant and hard working barman named Ben.",4,2017,04,06
231,Decent value in an expensive city!,"Spent five nights at the Jurys Inn and barring a few very small niggles it was a good stay. 

The twin room was huge, plenty of floor space with good facilities and a decent enough bathroom which could have been decorated a little more precisely. And someone could have at least put the toilet seat on straight, which might have stopped it from coming down almost every time I tried to lift it.

Had to go down to reception three times to get a new room card because they kept getting de-magnetised. The last two the card was not in the same pocket as my phone so no idea why they were so sensitive.

But apart from that, and they are only small things, it's better value than plenty of places in Dublin. Close to the top end of O'Connell Street, where public transport connections are plentiful. Easy walking, good shopping nearby, and plenty of different options for food, in the hotel and nearby. The bar is, quite surprisingly, competitive compared to local pubs and their Guinness was actually a little cheaper. Breakfast, as others have said, is plentiful and very good. Worth adding the option if you can.

Would definitely stay again. And will only get better when the major roadworks outside are completed, bringing the Luas (trams) past the front door. There is noise but my third floor room was on the internal courtyard and I couldn't hear a thing even with the window open.",5,2017,04,05
231,Excellent service and value for money,The staff were very courteous and helpful at checking and during our stay. They assisted with directions and booking of day tours.  A problem with the room was resolved within a few minutes. It was the only problem experienced during my 5 night stay. The location was ideal for day trips. There were many good restaurants nearby and most tourist attractions were within walking distance. ,5,2017,04,05
231,"Clean, excellent northside location, hotel has maintenance issues","The room I was allocated had old, large stains on the carpet.  Very off putting when I walked in for the first time.  Apart from the nasty looking carpet the room was clean and very quiet.  The staff are friendly, attentive and professional.",3,2017,04,05
231,Great value!,Stayed here in Dublin for one night - hotel was clean and very well located within walking distance of shopping areas and Temple Bar. Tesco right across the street. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and the doorman stood in the street to catch a cab for us. Would definitely stay again.,5,2017,04,04
231,A one night stay in Jurys Inn (Parnell),"Our 2nd visit, I think our last was 3 years ago.  The hotel is in an excellent location and it may have been refurbished/tidied up since our last visit.  The bedroom was grand, clean & for 1 night it had what we needed.  The bathroom was a bit grubby but only in the corners of the floor and the door so nothing concerning really!!",4,2017,04,04
231,Good stay at a good price,We were a big group...9 families with children. All the staff was very patient and kind with us. We just had a problem with the restaurant. If you travel with a group I advise you to book it in advance.,4,2017,04,03
231,Excellent location,A bit pricy but for the location you can't complain - rooms are decent sizes - nice and clean everywhere and the buffet breakfast is amazing.  Would definitely stay there again next time I'm in Dublin! ,4,2017,04,03

231,Lovely hotel,"Me and 21 my hen party stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in March. The rooms were lovely and clean, there was 3 of us in one room and it was spacious enough. The beds were really comfy and it was quiet through the night. The location is perfect and you are near to everything you need. Theres is a tescos accross the road which was useful. The bar was a nice area and big enough for us all plus more. We all would definitely want to stay here again.",5,2017,04,02
231,The grill restaurant ,"Very cosy restaurant in an otherwise not so nice part of city centre. Restaurant is fairly priced. The starters were average at best(order 4 different to share). The mains were ok, slow cooked shin beef very tasty but mashed potatoes were barely warm. Roast lamb cutlets delicious so was the rib eye steak but not the garlic sauce.A side of Garlic Ciabata bread was as hard as a rock therefore didn't eat.  Desserts: apple crumble and cheesecake delicious so was the ice cream. 
Overall: room for improvement but certainly not a bad restaurant. 
Would i come back- maybe.
",3,2017,04,01
231,Good stay at Jury's Inn,"We had a good stay at the Jury's Inn on Parnell Street.

Plenty of choice for breakfast spacious dining area. Nice bar. Staff on reception at all times which makes you feel safe when coming in late at night. Would definately come back 
",5,2017,04,01
231,Great Time / Great Location,"My wife and I stayed here for 4 days this past week. The location is pretty hard to beat. You are literally a 15-20 minute walk to virtually every major attraction in Dublin (EPIC / Dublin Castle / St. Patricks Cathedral / Trinity College / Dublinia / Christ Church / Jameson Distillery / Temple Bar area / Grafton St. / Genral Post Office). O'Connelll St. (which is the main North/South thoroughfare) is a 2 minute walk west from the hotel. Our package included breakfast which is a buffet style and has a nice selection. We didn't eat dinner or lunch there. They also have a nice bar area that always seemed busy. The room was clean and nice. I think my only ""complaint"" was that the lighting wasn't that great which made the room seem dark. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend to any as well. Also they have an area where you can store your luggage should you arrive before check-in time",5,2017,03,31
231,fantastic location in city centre,"We stayed here for 3 nights, perfect location for sightseeing. 3 minutes walk to henry street and 5 minute walk to the river liffey.
The room was spotless and also very spacious, 
We didn't male use of the restaurant facillites or gym so cant comment.
Although we did have a coffee in the bar area which was very relaxing.
All staff very friendly happy and very helpful.
Definetly would stay again and recommend to others.",4,2017,03,31
231,A good hotel convenient for central Dublin,We chose this hotel as part of a British Airways holiday package because it was very convenient for the historic centre of Dublin - Easter Rising and other historic events occurred nearby. Our only problem was road works going on outside the hotel which went on late into the night. If staying there in  the next few weeks I would recommend requesting a quiet room not facing onto Parnell Street.,4,2017,03,31
231,TRUE REVIEW OF JURYS PARNELL STREET,"Recently stayed at this hotel.Its a good base from which to explore the City Centre.
Its a decent location for most things in the City.

The rooms are clean and staff are friendly.The bar and restaurant are also very good.

Having been to Dublin a number of times this is one of the better hotels I have stayed at.

The only issue at present is the major roadworks going on all around the hotel and surrounding area.It really is quite noisy/dusty and goes on most of the day.",4,2017,03,31

Room facilities were good with giant double bed, decent shower, tea and coffee and a good tv although choice of channels is limited. Nice breakfast too. I would highly recommend",4,2017,03,29
231,Ideal location,Great location for a weekend in Dublin. Obviously our weekend consisted of a lot of drinking and visiting the friendly alcohol serving scene therefore was brilliant to have so many bars around the hotel. Close enough for us to pop back in the afternoon for a very much required power nap but far enough away for us to get a decent night sleep without hearing the nightlife. Slight mix up with the booking when we got there by the hotel but got resolved. Nice comfortable rooms. Would defo stay there in future,4,2017,03,28
231,Dublin with friends,Very nice stay the hotel and room was great but the staff over all exceptional especially the front desk gent made our stay. The hotel was just off the main road and central for all transport. I would recommend this hotel for couples and families ,5,2017,03,28
231,Great hotel,"Stayed as part of a group of 6 ladies for 3 nights. The hotel is well positioned within walking distance of all the city centre sights and close to the bus stops both from and back to the airport and the hop on hop off sightseeing bus. All 3 rooms were lovely, clean and well equipped and an extra pillow was supplied when requested. The breakfast was amazing, something for everyone, self service so personal choice is easy. All staff we encountered were courteous, helpful and polite. Wouldn't hesitate to stay again.",5,2017,03,28

231,Spring break in Dublin!,"Came with friends for a week and stayed at Jurys Inn. Very friendly staff upon check in. Hotel was clean. Wish the beds were a little bigger, but that seems to be bed size in most hotels. Would definitely book a room again if I get a chance to visit!",5,2017,03,27
231,Amazing stay!,"Just back from a beautiful stay at the Jury's Inn! It was me and my friend's first time in Dublin and we couldn't have picked a better hotel, right in the centre and a walkable distance from everywhere we wanted to go. The staff were all lovely and so friendly! Would definitely stay again and recommend it to friends",4,2017,03,27
231,Nice stay location,"In the heart of Dublin centre, close to shopping area (Henry St), walking distance to Temple bar, Trinity University, the Green Park. Breakfast is very good, but if you would like to go out for it, there are some nice cafe locations around. The restaurant for dinner was great, the first day we arrived, we were tired and decided to have dinner there, we were surprised by the food quality and how friendly staff they have. We enjoyed staying there.",4,2017,03,27
231,3 nights in Dublin,"My wife and myself stayed 3 nights in this hotel in Dublin. The room was of a decent size, comfortable bed, good shower & very quiet (inside room). Check in & check out was very efficient & staff very helpful! ",4,2017,03,27
231,Nice stay location,"This hotel is perfectly located, close to a shopping area, hop in hop out bus services and walking distance to Temple Bar, Trinity University and park.
Staff was very friendly, breakfast was a traditional Irish buffet style, but if you need something different, you can walk and get some Cafe locations as well. We had dinner at the restaurant and it was very good, so if you would like to stay in for dinner instead of going out, I will recommend it. All staff are very friendly and they made us feel like being at home.",4,2017,03,27
231,Stay in Jury's,"Excellent hotel. Great location , very friendly staff. Good variety for breakfast.Q Car Park great value for the 1 night stay. Overall a very good experience. Plan to stay there again on future visits.

Room was a little small but modern and clean. We booked via internet and every thing went very well. We had a pleasant view of the street and of the city being on the 5th. floor. Nice little bar on the second floor. Good security on the lifts and also at night.",5,2017,03,26
231,Fab location ,"I have just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel. The hotel is in a perfect location, close to the airport link and tour buses etc. We arrived about 11ish and one of our rooms were ready but the other wasn't, but that was to be expected due to the time. The rooms are a decent size, we had a twin room which had one double bed and one single bed. Bathroom was a decent size too. Can't comment on the resturant as we never ate here but we did have a few drinks in the bar which was really nice. All staff we spoke to were very pleasant. One of our party is in a wheelchair and upon check in we were asked if we would like to swap one of the twin rooms for a disabled room, which wasn't required but was nice of them to ask. All in all I would 100% recommend and if I return to Dublin (which I probably will) I will definitely stay here again.  ",5,2017,03,26
231,"Pleasant stay, friendly staff and perfect rooms","Stayed here for the football weekend. Managed to secure an earlier check in. Staff at reception were friendly and welcoming.

231,Lovely stay in a modern hotel with friendly staff,"Quick and efficient check in. Excellent, comfortable room with all modern amenities. Excellent choice at breakfast.

Only strange thing was that you need a key card to access the toilets in the bar which caused a lot of confusion...",4,2017,03,25

231,Close to everything,"PROS :
- Next to 2 grocery stores and 2 restaurants (like right next door, 10 steps)
- Staff was incredibly nice, on check in a really friendly guy (I can't remember his name but he was Polish), gave us tips on where to eat, what to see, etc...answered all questions patiently. 
- Less than a block to O'Connel and all the buses/taxis
- Walking distance to any Viator tour pick up area. 
- Very clean, good beds, good blow dryer and coffee supplies in the room. 

CONS:
- There were 3 of us in the room, we only ever got 2 towels. We asked on the first of 6 nights we were there, for another towel and never got it.

The staff at reception were very helpful as they use a car park the other side of O'Connell street and the rate was reasonable at €10 per day.    The breakfast was good and there was plenty to choose from, there were notices about for you to let staff know if there was anything that was not there that you would like.   The location was great right in the heart of the city.",4,2017,03,21

But the reviews on Tripadvisor were very good, and now I agree.  To start, we arrived at 5 AM but the hotel found rooms for us.  And they honored my request for a quiet room.  My room was small - my wife and I found ourselves bumping a lot as we moved around.  But the room was clean and quiet and the hot water was good.

Our room was hot, and the thermostat did not work; when I found a front desk person who spoke English it was fixed quickly.  So, I was a happy vacationer.",3,2017,03,18

The hotel is in a fab location. Staff were friendly.  We were in Dublin for a concert so didnt spend much time in the Hotel. There was only one slight problem with the room..the bathroom smelt like vomit. Because we were in a rush..wr didnt report it. On the next day I advised the receptionist. She was lovely. Offered us to speak to the Manager. I said I wasnt complaining..more just advising. Can I just say also that the room was tiny but for 75euros for two adults...what could you expect. An absolute bargain!! I will return again. ",4,2017,03,14

The hotel is not new but is well looked after and the fittings are all to a high standard. The staff were all friendly and helpful with a little sparkle in the eye. Prices to eat and drink in the hotel were on a par with the cheaper bars and eateries, meaning that there was no penalty for staying in the hotel if you wanted to, to avoid the heaving masses in Temple Bar and Grafton Street. In all, a decent hotel staffed by lovely people..",5,2017,03,13
231,No hesitation in recommending it.,"Brilliant location, just off O’Connell St [and the buses from the airport] and an easy stroll to Temple Bar. Staff were friendly and helpful.

The only problem was a loud drilling noise coming from within the building early in the morning, couldn't work out what it was, but the Guinness helped me sleep through it.",4,2017,03,13
231,Perfect place,"Excellent hotel, enjoyed my stay although it was only for one night. But no doubt will be my first choice when I travel again to Dublin. I will recommend the hotel to all friends I work with or I do know.",5,2017,03,13
231,hotel,"clean and just a walk to the city center. we had some problems while ordering dinner because the lack of stuff, we want to think, but all the staff are very friendly and helpful. Another thing I missed is that we wanted lactose free milk and they did not have it but soja milk.",4,2017,03,13
231,City break in Dublin,Great location for a site seeing weekend break. 10/15 mins walk from Temple bar. 45 mins walk to Dublin zoo. Extremely clean& tidy hotel. Staff are always happy to help. Would return for another stay!,4,2017,03,13
231,Jury's Inn Parnell Street Dublin ,Just had 3 nights at this hotel. The room we were in was intended for invalids which I found  surprising but that said it was clean and tidy. The bed could have been better and I was surprised there wasn't a  fridge or safe. We booked through a travel agent so these options may have been  available in other rooms. I did find it strange it was on the top floor and as far from the  lift you could get given it was fitted out for an invalid person with a wheelchair. However I would  happily  stay again the staff were very helpful.,3,2017,03,12
231,Standard hotel. Extortionate prices,"I've stayed here twice, mainly for the location within the city centre. The hotel is standard with decent size rooms. The upkeep and cleanliness is to a high standard. Best of all the bed is exceptionally comfortable. However, for the price paid (€189 per night) it's definitely not value for money. The hotel could also do with more front of house staff: ringing reception entailed a long wait before calls were answered. In summary: a good hotel but way overpriced. ",3,2017,03,12
231,best place to stay in dublin,"Stayed here while visiting my son who attends University Dublin College for the semester. Can not beat the location. The rooms were immaculate and very comfortable. The staff was very helpful and felt the area was safe to explore from.
Overall great experience will recommend this to all my family that is planning visits in the next few months",5,2017,03,12
231,Perfect location,"Right in the heart of Dublin, it's perfectly positioned next to O'Connell street.

The staff were helpful, especially a nice man called Przmek who couldn't do enough for us.

Would definitely stay there again.",5,2017,03,12
231,Everything is Great - Except the Bed,"Last year I stayed at the Jurys Inn Christchurch, and wasn't a big fan so tried the Parnell Jurys and liked the hotel much better - it's a lot more modern, quieter and generally seems less busy and hectic than Christchurch.  

Room was spacious, clean, good size bathroom with room to put toiletries (unlike Christchurch), and had a central heating/cooling system (again, unlike Christchurch) and despite construction on Parnell was very quiet.  I asked for and received a top floor room facing the interior courtyard and that was a very quiet location with zero street noise. Ate dinner at the restaurant and it was fabulous and affordably priced.  

The one area things fell down was the bed which, while comfortable, was nothing more than a cheap roll-in bed on wheels that moved around and felt like I was staying in a spare bedroom at a relative's house. I'm really surprised Jurys would have such cheap quality bed when they obviously have put a lot of effort into the rest of the room.  I don't know if I just was unlucky or if this is common in the hotel, but I hope Jurys can rectify this and get a ""real"" hotel bed in all of their rooms.  

Still, the experience was better than the Jurys Christchurch and I'd pick Parnell next time - as long as the bed issue could be sorted out.",4,2017,03,10
231,R & R,Very good all round. Hotel is in a good position handy for the city centre and the shops. Staff are friendly helpful and efficient. The room was clean and pleasant with a good size bath room good shower and soft towers. Food was good and reasonably priced,5,2017,03,10
231,really great hotel but expensive,"Stayed for three nights over the weekend (cost €394) Hotel very clean, reception staff helpful and friendly, our room was excellent, a good size with tea and coffee maker. Bath clean and spacious with good toiletries.  We ate at the bar twice and meals were tasty and well presented.Breakfast offered a variety of choice. Hotel in a great location , would recommend this hotel",5,2017,03,08
231,Really enjoyed our stay at Jurys Inn,"Have just returned home after a 2 night stay at Dublin. I stayed in a room with my mum and sister. Beds were lovely and comfy and rooms were spacious enough and quiet. I found all the staff helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Sam was especially helpful to us, which we all really appreciated. The breakfast was really lovely, with so much choice. Also you could ask for anything extra if you needed it, which really with all that choice I would not think anyone would need to. We did not eat dinner at the hotel, so can't comment on that but if anything like the breakfast, I am sure it is lovely. The hotel is in a great location. It is close to all the shops and also only a short walk to all the bars. Opposite there is a Tesco, which is really handy for purchasing anything you have forgotten from home and also for a few cheaper drinks before you go out. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will most certainly be returning in the near future as I really enjoy my stay at this hotel and loved Dublin and found everyone really friendly. Thank you all at Jurys Inn :) x",5,2017,03,08
231,Fantastic base for the older stag doooo!!,"Stag doooo based here for 12 forty somethings who still like to have a good night out! Nice comfortable hotel, nice enough to be given a wide berth by some of the younger and rowdier parties! Beds comfortable, room clean and not shoe box like, Bathroom small but clean and a great shower. Breakfast available for extra 9 euros per day if booked the day before or 11 euros if you paid for it on the day. Needless to say we paid for it (breakfast!) most days as we didn't know how we'd be feeling!  Great cooked fayre on offer, the usual you'd expect from any decent hotel, as well as the customary cold meats, waffles, cereals etc. We paid £177 for 3 nights here and we were all very happy with that. It's really in a great location. Out of the hotel door and right is Parnells pub (and food) a good start to the night to lines one's stomach. That said we ate in here twice. Once was good, one not so good. Personally I had pasta twice and it was fine. Out the door here and right again is O'Connell Street, which a swift 15 minute walk down and cross the bridge will have you into Temple bar in no time. Straight outside the hotel is a Tesco for the essentials you'll forget or hangover cures! Out of the hotel and to the left is shops and some pubs (Australian bar the Woolshed (fantastic for all sport) is a 15 min walk away. If you get the chance sample 2 pubs on Grafton Street, McDaids a proper drinkers pub and Bruxelles in which it seemed too be bouncing every night (Thurs, Fri & Sat but Fri was best). Also at the very top of O'Connell street is the usual hop on hop off bus too. Would recommend that also. we got a day pass but should probably have invested in a 2 day pass to try and keep us out of the bars during the afternoon! All in all I'd recommend this pub to anyone who asked my opinion. Reasonably priced, very comfortable, great location and a final mention to the staff. very friendly and bubbly. Nothing was a bother for them.",4,2017,03,07
231,Nice stay in the center of Dublin,"Nice stay in the center of Dublin - rooms are clean, stuff ist very nice. Breakfast tastes very good.
We can recommend the hotel to everyone who stays in Dublin for vacances also with children and bigger groups.",5,2017,03,07
231,.,"Great hotel, friendly staff and location was brilliant. Very good value for money and would stay here again. Rooms spacious and clean. Secure doors that require room keys to enter the room areas made us feel secure. ",4,2017,03,07
231,Rainy days in Dublin,"A short taxi ride costing approx 25 euros each way from the airport for a party of two, 
This is an ideal location for restaurants and pubs outside the main tourist area but well within walking distance if required.
The juries inn is a very well maintained building, clean, friendly staff throughout and very accommodating with any requests.
It has a large bar, selling a variety of well presented and very tasty food.
The Restaurant is a great place to eat before going for a night out locally or in the town.
Our room was on the third floor facing Parnell st which at the moment is under major roadwork transformation making it hard to ignore the noise, it is fair to say that there is  major road works throughout Dublin centre so missing this will be difficult.
We were there for 4 days which rained throughout, Wet,Wet,Wet, but this did not dampen the stay at we found plenty to see and do.",4,2017,03,07
231,A little bit on the pricey side,"We stayed here for a 2 nights in a 3 person room the charge for the room was over €300 euros and did not include breakfast which in my opinion at that price they should include breakfast, the room was of a reasonable size, beds very comfortable and there was tea, coffee making facilities. Breakfast cost €9 if pre booked or €11 on the day it was a breakfast buffet consisting of cereals, porridge, yoghurts, fruit eggs, bacon, sausages, red & white pudding, bread, rolls & bagels eat as much or little as you want, the dining area does get rather busy and you may have to carry your food tray through to the bar area where seating is available.

when our room was cleaned on the following morning it seemed like the duvet cover was just pulled up, upon inspection the bed sheet was as we left it not really acceptable, would I stay here again probably not.

There was",3,2017,03,07
231,Good,"Nice hotel friendly staff,food was great rooms were clean.bed was comfortable. Food was excellent overall great service would stay there again. No fault to the hotel roadwork was crazy took awhile to find parking.",5,2017,03,06
231,"Best place to stay in city center as its close to everything ,","10/10 .... Perfect for shopping trip/ weekend away . Its central to everything with Henry street  and O Connell Street just around the corner .Loads of places to eat out  nearby and plenty of pubs on every  corner so spoiled for choice .

231,Good central hotel,"Room was available at 11am the morning we arrived which meant we could check in drop off bags freshen up and head out to explore.

Room was on 2nd floor near bar and restaurant but was very quiet, no noise heard whilst in room. Room was fresh, new carpet, clean bright bathroom, comfy beds and decent space. On the negative we had no view - a view overlooking the council rubbish depot, lorries and machines coming and going during the evening. Walls between rooms were ok although could here neighbours on occasions.

Breakfast was a good buffet, plenty of choice, only downside was the hot drinks machines only did coffee, the hot chocolate contained in a ""hot"" jug was stone cold both mornings. Highlighted this to waiting staff who said she would make us both a fresh hot chocolate and inform chef about the temp. Still waiting and the next day was the same. 

5 mins walk from airport bus stop on O'Connell street. Tesco, lidl, aldi and poundshop all on doorstop if looking for a quick snack.

Overall i would stay again if the minor issues were sorted.",4,2017,03,06
231,Weekend Break ,"Booked a two night stay here- 
The hotel staff very accommodating, and friendly.
The room wasn't ready for us when we arrived ,however we  asked for a quiet room high up.
We were delighted to be placed on the top floor .
The room was spacious , clean and warm ( eventually-we couldn't work the heating) 
Hotel reception had it sorted in no time and  couldn't fault their response.

Definitely recommend and wouldn't hesitate to re visit.",4,2017,03,06
231,"Ideal area, clean and average value for money.","Overall good trip, stayed as a couple at Jury's inn. Close to airport stop which was good. Plenty of places to eat near by also. Hotel was very clean, however the bathroom and bedrooms could be doing with a decor update. This didn't affect the quality of our stay but in comparison to the modern reception, it does stand out. ",4,2017,03,06
231,Never again,This is more of a £50 a night place full off large groups. Continual noise until 4am by guest. Very poor cooked breakfast. We have stayed here in the passed and it's been a lot better but this time was something I would not want to repeat so if you want a decent sleep and breakfast (not to much to ask). Go elsewhere!!!!,1,2017,03,06
231,First visit to Dublin,"Just returned from weekend stay and was very happy to choose Jurys Inn. Good location for exploring Dublin and shortish walk to Temple Bar. Hotel, staff, rooms and breakfast all very good. Our room was at the back of the hotel so particularly quiet. All in all a good choice for our weekend in Dublin",5,2017,03,06
231,Good quality hotel in a reasonably good location,"The hotel had a reasonably good location close to the Gate Theatre and just around the corner from the top of O'Connell Street with some good shopping centres and pedestrianized areas nearby. it is also within easy walking distance of the Temple Bar area. 

With our Superior room got one free coffee per person each day at the bar via vouchers and 10% off food at the hotel. The room's bathroom had a shallow full length bath, good shower, wall mounted toiletries and tissues. Our room had a double bed and narrow single bed, tea making facilities, water, biscuits, good lighting, lots of mirrors, clothes rail, hair dryer, ironing board and iron, TV etc. basically all the usual things you'd expect and a free newspaper each day. There was no fridge or safe in the room, but i read that safe deposit boxes are available at reception.

The hotel floor we were on had some internal noise at night with people talking in corridors, room doors banging and the man in the next room having a loud conversation on his mobile. The walls, as in most modern hotels these days are not particularly thick. If you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs (or just drink enough Guinness so you don't care).

When we booked the hotel's breakfast seemed overpriced but we noticed lower prices advertised in the lifts. However we still went out to the many surrounding cafes, shops and bars for breakfast. I would recommend Ann's Bakery, Superfoods and The Kingfisher - just over the road.

The staff on reception were all friendly. Smokers grouped around the front of the hotel are unavoidable and while we had no trouble some may feel uncomfortable with the amount of homeless on the streets near the hotel. However, I think this is endemic of Dublin as opposed to just this area. The hotel is super secure - you need your room key to get access to the lifts, stairs and toilets near the bar and restaurant  on the second floor. Everywhere is very clean and tidy.",5,2017,03,06
231,Very nice stay,"My wife and I had a warmth welcome, from a friedly and most helpful staff. Excellent location, near almost everything. We've been to Dublin's city centre and Temple Bar in a few minutes walk. All the warmth and helpful welcome from the staff we thank to Mr. Przmeck, who, in this review stands for the rest of the nice people working at this hotel who made our stay in Dublin a very pleasant one.",5,2017,03,04
231,Exactly as required,"We stayed for 2 nights and this hotel was everything we needed. Clean and well kept, friendly staff, comfortable room.
Breakfast for 9euros is very good value.
But most importantly, its position is absolutely spot on.
Would definitely use again.
",5,2017,03,04
231,"Excellent location, clean, quiet room & helpful, friendly staff.","Location is good for business and pleasure. Staff were polite, professional and helpful. Nothing bad to say about our stay. We ate breakfast in the hotel which was good, but we ate at (fabulous) nearby cafes & restaurants so cannot give opinion on the hotel's own bar & restaurant.",5,2017,03,03
231,Brilliant,"This hotel was far better then I expected for the price and a fantastic location perfect for everything. Arrived at 10 am so dropped the bags off in the luggage room filled out paper work and went out for the day. When we came back, the room was ready. It was spacious, modern, spotless and light. Hotel very secure, friendly staff and worth every penny + more. Breakfast was great and brilliant value for money at 9 euros. There is a restaurant directly opposite which we went the morning before which is simply Devine. So if your there a couple of nights try there too. The bar is very reasonable with a pint of Guinness 5.30 euros. ",5,2017,03,02
231,Anthony ,"Great hotel and friendly staff, Very clean and ideally located in the City centre, close to all the main attractions and very reasonable prices, parking across the street at Q park, My first choice hotel whenever in Dublin..",5,2017,03,02
231,close to town and tidy,"quite a small hotel I think, but plenty of communal space in the restaurant and the foyer. good idea with card protected lifts from a security point of  view. 
room was tidy and perfect for a couple. 
no particularly good views but its very close to the main drag in town and short walk over the river to the temple bar area.
staff were friendly and helpful on all the occasions we visited reception. 
only down side, my iPhone couldn't connect to the 'free wifi' which was pity but local cafes and restaurants had no problem so not totally disconnected! 

very good all in all - would recommend.",4,2017,03,02
231,"Great location, lovely staff, tram works bearable","Stayed here for a weekend. Hotel was easy to reach by taxi although tram works make the route a little circular. Hotel rooms quiet, hotel clean and staff friendly and very helpful. Breathe location for shops, bars and city life. Beautiful city, people so helpful and funny. Would stay again. Only gripe was the room service at night. One of our party is coeliac and the selection was non existent and the food we ordered for everyone was quite poor. Not sure if this was because it was so late at night.",5,2017,02,28
231,Birthday Break!,"It was my Boyfriend's birthday and we had always wanted to go to Ireland so I booked this City Break as a surprise and this hotel was absolutely perfect!

We booked a taxi transfer on Rideways due to me being a bit of a panicker, I would prefer to know that someone will be there for me and confirmed times etc. instead of relying on public transport. I think this was about £35, the taxi drivers were lovely, full of chat and advising us on places to go and things to do.

We arrived late AM and Check In wasn't until 2pm so we just left our bags in the locked baggage room and received a little ticket with a number on and a label with the same number was attached to our case. Very assuring to see that everything was secure. The lifts would only work if you put your key card in the machine, which again, sense of security was great! 

The room was lovely, better than I expected! Everything was clean and tidy and well presented, there was an iron and an ironing board which came in handy! The view wasn't great, we just looked onto some old buildings but that wasn't a problem as we weren't there to sit in the room and look out of the window! 

We found that the location was great. Both of us had no idea where we were going and did very little research - only where the shops were, which was a 30 second walk! We did not eat in the hotel as we were out and about most of the time but we did come across Gino's Gelato on the first day and ended up there every night on our way back to the hotel! Their Crepes and Ice Creams are to die for!!! 

It did rain for a day or so but we expected that with the time of year we went but there are plenty of things to do if the weather is not so good. We went to the Cinema one night which is right at the end of Parnell Street, go left out of the hotel and carry on until you see a huge building opposite Primark - You won't miss it! They have a bar and everything in there! You could get the usual cinema food - nachos, hotdogs, popcorn but they were not as over-priced as they are here in England, we found it to be quite cheap! Whilst waiting for the film to start we went next door to an Arcade where they have pool tables for 1 Euro a game so that kept us occupied as we are both very competitive! 

We also went on a bus tour which you will find along the main road (just follow the Spire of Dublin - that's what we did every time we got lost). I think it was around 30 Euros for the two of us which was reasonable, considering we spent 3 hours going around Dublin, you could get off at any stop and it stopped at the main sights e.g Guinness Storehouse then you can get picked back up at any point on any bus. The ticket was valid for 24 hours so you could use it however much you wanted. 

We did venture over to Temple Bar a couple of times and found ourselves in Fitzsimons along the quayside which was great, very welcoming and a young lad was singing and playing a guitar so everybody was singing along - there was a great atmosphere in there! We did go to Temple bar during the day too and found that as lovely as it was, we had chosen the best side of Dublin for us. 

We had a lovely break away and we would definitely return to this hotel!",5,2017,02,28
231,Dublin visit,This hotel is well placed for all Dublin's attractions.  Easy transfer on coach dropped us just around the corner from the hotel.  Hotel offered us everything we needed for a short break and we thoroughly enjoyed our first trip to Ireland.,4,2017,02,27
231,Dublin trip ,"Stayed for 3 nights, ideally located just off o'connell Street. Got the airport bus which took about 30 mins and drops off just round the corner. Room was spacious, bed was really comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful. Would recommend this hotel
",4,2017,02,26
231,Fab location. Would deffo stay again!,"Book it! Tesco express right opposite. Parnell heritage pub just down the street about 30 seconds walk which is fab, try the chicken wings! They are insanely yummy! Temple bar only about 20 mins walk from the hotel and s taxi there from right outside the hotel door is only 7EURO ",5,2017,02,24
231,Family trip,Had a fantastic stay in Jury's Inn Parnell Street. Friendly staff. Room and bathroom excellent. Food lovely and bar so cosy. Bar staff couldn't have been any more helpful and friendly. Excellent location. ,5,2017,02,23
231,Family City Break,"What can I say, location was great, next to O'Connell Street and just a walk away from the sights. Staff where amazing and catered for our every whim. Breakfast was awesome one of the best buffets we have had. ",5,2017,02,23
231,Pleasant comfortable city centre hotel.,"Title says it all really, Jurys is a pleasant and comfortable city centre hotel. 

Just off O'Connell Street and ideally located for the city. 

I had a nice large spotlessly clean room. No complaints at all.

Great breakfast for €9.00.

Recommended 👍",4,2017,02,23
231,Dublin trip,"Very pleasant and comfortable hotel, within easy walking distance to Temple Bar. Situated just off O Connell Street and within easy distance of most of the sight seeing attractions. Close to the tour bus routes and the Airport link buses",5,2017,02,23
231,Lovely hotel for a weekend visit to Dublin,"The location of the hotel is perfect. It's a bit north of the city center, about a 10 minute walk from the Temple Bar area. Staff is very polite and do their utmost best to help you have a pleasant stay.
During our stay we had a room on looking out on the inner premises so we heard nothing from the extensive roadworks going on at the moment.
Breakfast was maybe a little simple, but really tasty!",5,2017,02,22
231,Lovely Staff- shame about the refurb,Came to Dublin for a 3 day break with my partner over valentines day. We arrived at the hotel around 10:30am to drop our bags off and maybe see if our room was ready- it wasn't so we just dropped bags and paid for our stay. We was told to come back at 2pm to check in- fair enough. We arrived back at the hotel at around 2pm and proceeded to check in. We was informed that we could have a room but it was a family room so the room would have a double and a single bed in there- this was fine as we had booked a double. The room we was given was on the 3rd floor so after going to the room we then discovered they had actually assigned us a twin room so we had to go all the way back down to reception to get our room changed. The 2nd room we was assigned was on the 4th floor as we arrived on the 4th floor we was met with plastic covering the floor and a strong smell of paint as they was refurbishing that floor. That was the only downside to our stay as it was very dangerous as there was equipment left by the decorators and workman that we had to physically step over next to the lift which I found very unprofessional for the money we had paid. The staff at the hotel were lovely though and was very helpful - we even had an error put on our bill and they amended it straight away. We left our bags with the hotel on our last day and then collected them when we headed to the airport. The location of the hotel was perfect as we was in the middle of the city and had easy access to everything. I would defiantly stay at the Jurys Inn again just not on a floor they was refurbishing.,4,2017,02,22
231,First time visit but will be back,"We booked the jurys inn on a friends recommendation over the half term holiday, we weren't disappointed. The staff are fantastic nothing is too much trouble for them,our room was clean and well presented,the breakfast was buffet style and excellent both irish breakfast and continental breakfast items we're quickly replenished so there was no waiting the staff were very well organised and this was apparent throughout our 4day stay. We even had an evening meal too,we would be happy to stay at the jurys inn again and would recommend it to our friends too.",5,2017,02,21
231,Excellent place to stay and enjoy Dublin!,"The hotel was amazing and especially the food! Breakfast had a large amount of different foods and the restaurant served really good food! I can totally recommend this hotel for anyone who wants a little bit of luxury for a reasonable price. And if you are ever in need of good food, go to the hotel restaurant, so good food and excellent service!",5,2017,02,21
231,Nice ,Lovely hotel. ..top of o Connell st. So pretty good for everything. ..clean. .breakfast lovely. .would stay again. .staff very friendly and helpful.not much more I can add really but won't let me submit till reached 200 letters 😆😆,5,2017,02,21
231,Average,"My friends and I went to Dublin to celebrate 3 of the girls birthdays. We decided to stay in the Jury's Inn as it was a good price and a good location. I booked separately onto the trip and through lastminute.com. When we checked in, they couldn't find my booking. I proved that I had booked as I had my original email. They eventually found my booking and luckily had a spare room for me!! The service around all of that wasn't great and they couldn't explain how this happened, no apology was given. 
The room was of a good standard, decent size and had everything we needed. When we arrived the room felt very cool so we put the heating on. We found out later during the night that the window didn't shut properly which is why the room was so cold. I did complain about this to reception who sent a man up to 'close' the window, which he didn't do but just put the heating on full blast instead. I also realised that the door didn't slam when I left the room and when I pushed on the door it opened - watch out for this and make sure you pull the door tightly shut when you leave!!!
The breakfast is lovely and the bar was reasonably priced too. If you do have the breakfast and book it in advance, ensure you have the email with this on as they told all of us we didn't include it but once we showed our email they said it was fine! 
Although not the best experience, I would stay here again due to the location and the other members of the party didnt have so many issues with their rooms!

231,GUINNESS ON TOUR,"Myself and my wife together with our son and daughter in law have just returned from jurys inn parnell having stayed two nights.Rooms were clean warm and spacious with a comfy bed. If you have booked room only you can purchase a full breakfast for 9 euros if you book it on arrival it was well worth it.The bar in the hotel was comfortable with a good choice of food and drinks at very 
reasonable prices.This was our second visit to the jurys and we would definately stay again",4,2017,02,20
231,Happy with our stay,Nice hotel and staff. Great location and very handy for anybody visiting the city. We walked everywhere from the hotel including out to the 3 Arena. Very central. Bar good but no smoking area so would have to go to the ground floor if a smoker. We didn't eat but the menu offers a good selection of snacks and food. We will probably stay here again if visiting Dublin. ,5,2017,02,20
231,"Nice hotel, staff were great but the room was noisy","The hotel is lovely, staff were great, friendly and helpful but the room was noisy which kept me awake till after 2am, partially due to my room being near to the bar but mostly due to it being at the front of the hotel and on the second floor, once the street quiet ended down I slept fine",4,2017,02,20
231,Great location and friendly staff,"I stayed one night so I could sit an exam. I had asked for a quiet room so I could get a good night’s sleep. The lovely woman who checked me in allocated me a very quiet inward facing room on the 4th floor which was perfect. She also wished me good luck which was a nice touch. The room was clean, comfortable and very quiet. The desk was good to work at.
The location is perfect in that you can walk everywhere but you are not in the noisy bar area. The Tesco Metro directly opposite is useful for picking up supplies.
The breakfast buffet had a good range of choices and the food was hot and refreshed frequently.
All the staff I encountered during may stay where friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,02,20
231,really convenient and close hotel!,"stayed here for 3 nights on the 5th floor, cannot fault this hotel it has a lot of road works outworks outside but the rooms are a really good size nice and clean too.

there is a tesco and lots of fast food restaurants in front of the hotel as well as the main shopping street behind the hotel.

we decided to buy breakfast for 9E each and it was a good choice had a lot of food and constantly refreshed.",5,2017,02,20
231,Quality city centre hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights with family. Our rooms were on the 2nd floor and were clean,comfortable, modern and very quiet. Bathroom had nice toiletries and bedroom had an ironing board and iron as well as usual hairdryer and kettle. Perfect location if you want to be away from Temple Bar still close enough to walk everywhere. Bus from airport and hop on hop off bus stop around the corner. Nice bar and restaurant on 2nd floor with reasonably priced meals and drinks, service a little slow but staff very friendly and helpful. Good breakfast with hot and cold choices open till 10.30am, sometimes a short wait for a table at busy times but not an issue. Check out staff very courteous and stored our bags for the day efficiently with no fuss.",5,2017,02,19
231,Bad customer service!,"Having arrived and been checked into a room on the 4th floor we were happy until we got out of the lift. We then proceeded down the corridor (building site) turns out every room was having and refurbishment and paint job, Lots of workman and a high smell of fresh paint. No one ever informed us of this on check in and no email was sent to us before arrival. Room was ok, dated bathroom and is it too much to expect a bottle of water in room when paying £140+ a night? I won't be returning anytime soon. ",2,2017,02,19
231,Perfect location ,"We stayed at the Jury's Inn for two nights and it is in the perfect location. 30 minute air coach ride from the airport, 10 minute walk to the National Leprechaun Museum, 15 Minute walk to the Temple Bar and a 30 minute walk to the Guinness Storehouse. There are pubs on every corner and they are literally EVERYWHERE which is perfect!! The River Bar is a great place to go, food and drinks are delicious (and it shows football if you are looking for that). There is a Tesco Metro across the road from the hotel which is handy. The breakfast buffet at the hotel is nice with lots to choose from. Room was clean with hair dryer and iron. Beds were very comfortable and their are plenty of mirrors! A few marks on the doors and walls but nothing major. The staff are very helpful and welcoming which is always nice and random people can't get around the hotel as you have to use your room keycard to use the lifts etc - we felt safe. They also allow you to store your luggage if your room isn't ready.  Overall, we had an amazing experience in Dublin and when we come back we will be using the Jury's Inn again!",4,2017,02,18
231,Great place for a city break,"Stayed here for a three day city break to Dublin.  Central location with quick access to public transport. Very friendly, competent and efficient staff. Excellent breakfast buffet. Hotel room was clean and comfortable and surprisingly quiet, absence of noisy traffic. Price was very reasonable. Thank you. ",4,2017,02,18
231,Short stay,"Stayed one night during our stay in Dublin.
Friendly staff, a warm welcome.
Room was adequate, Premier Inn standard, though the bed less comfy.
The room was freezing cold and the air conditioning / heating took a good few hours to get going.
There was no source of heating in the bathroom. No heated towel rail - nothing! It never warmed up and was very unpleasant!
We dined in the restaurant and had a very pleasant meal at reasonable price.
Noisy hotel as our room liked onto Parnell Street which is currently being dug up, like most of Dublin.
Breakfast was a disappointment. Cheap sausages, cold eggs and fatty bacon. Poor choice of jams and bread. As if they couldn't be bothered.
Overall, more expensive than a Premier Inn and more like a Travel Lodge.
",3,2017,02,18
231,Ideal Location,"We arrived at the Jury's Inn at 9am and was pleasantly surprised to be checked in on arrival, this was an ideal start to our break. The reception staff were particularly helpful, supplying us with map of the city and showing us the places to visit. The room was comfortable and all the staff very friendly. We would use the hotel again as it's a short walk to all the sites.",4,2017,02,18
231,"Convenient , comfortable city centre location.","This hotel is basically around the corner from Dublin's main street, O' Connell Street. All  staff we encountered were friendly and pleasant.The superior family room was smaller than anticipated but comfortable. It was ample for us and our two small kids. Apart from a mix-up with room service meal order, we enjoyed our stay there. The hotel does not have parking but secure parking is available a short walk away at a reduced rate through the hotel. Dublin is undergoing major roadworks at the moment (February 2017) but it did not affect our stay. The bar and restaurant are located towards the rear of the hotel which also means you would not know these works are going on. This would be a good central location for sight-seeing in Dublin. There are lots of restaurants and bars close by.",4,2017,02,17
231,Very good,Would highly recommend this hotel clean comfortable  very good value for money. Friendly atmosphere. Rooms are great size as was the bathroom everything you would want in a hotel only there one night could have stayed longer ,5,2017,02,17
231,"Great welcome, service, and stay","Not really one for writing reviews but after my stay here I feel obliged to share my experience in this fabulous hotel. Was a quick stop off business trip in Dublin after attending the tech summit was my reason for staying here and very pleased that I chose this hotel. After a few stays in different hotels in the city for various reasons, I must say that this stay was much more than I have ever experienced in Dublin and definitely up there with the very best I have ever encountered worldwide. 

On arrival, I found myself greeted by the manager Patrick who was as friendly and hands on as ever I have come across. Very impressed by him and all the staff, and then met him the next morning serving breakfast at 7am which you don't come across too often! Where again I was greeted with a smile and great service once again. Great selection in the breakfast buffet I found myself spoiled for choice. Later that evening, I decided to eat inhouse for this trip and again the young man on duty (not 100% sure of his name, had training on his badge) was very welcoming and friendly and service once again was top class. The steak comes highly recommended. 

Overall, an absolutely ideal location for any of your needs in Dublin. Staff and service was absolutely 100% (as was the room) and I will definitely be returning again. Highly, highly recommended.",5,2017,02,17
231,A Series Of Unfortunate Events - Staff Brilliant Though,"I have stayed here a few times as it is very reasonably priced and right in the middle of the city centre, close to everything.

When I arrived I was early I admit but they still were willing to check me in.  The bad thing and I felt sorry for the staff was that they had a hoard of rowdy teenagers in reception that I can only describe as disgraceful, they had 6 adults with them but seemed to either not care or be unable to keep control of them, the reception staff were clearly upset and asked for them to calm down and they were very professional.  The abuse that they took from the 'adults' in the group was uncalled for.

When I went to go to my room the lift was being used by some of these teenagers that seemed to think this was a fairground ride!  As when I got into the lift to go to floor 4 it stopped at floor 2 and then it went back down to reception! (this happened 3 times!) as the lovely young people thought it was fun to just go up and down in the lift and disrupt everyone else!

Finally got to my floor to find that it was under renovation - thankfully no where near me.  I then had to change my room as i asked for a double and it was 2 singles!  I finally after an hour got to my room and i asked for a non smoking room, which it was but there was a faint smell of stale smoke, obviously the people before me had been smoking in the room,  I didn't want to have to change rooms again so I put up with it.  Then that morning I was woken to loud banging of doors and the loud annoying people that were leaving there room that decided to shout loud conversation at 6.30am!!!!

Overall my stay was good and the room was perfect and the breakfast in the morning was excellent and the staff all amazing.  I did feel sorry for them.  I would recommend this hotel and will be staying again however it is a shame that other guests wreck it for you.",3,2017,02,17
231,Great location!,"Have stayed here three times now when going to gigs in Dublin.  The location is fab really central to the city centre and walking distance to the shops.

Bar is a nice area for a pint, the room is your typical Jurys room, clean and comfortable.

Will defiantly use again for a central stay in Dublin. ",5,2017,02,16
231,Under renovation,Good average stay but avoid floor 4! Plastic along the corridors and workmen everywhere who work a long day so a bit of banging and thumping at odd times. Overall our stay was fine but if we'd been staying longer than 2 nights I would have asked to be moved. Breakfast was good except they seemed to run out of things really quickly. Bar and dinner were great.,3,2017,02,16
231,Brilliant staff,"Stayed here for 2 nights over valentines week and have to say it was great. The check in was quick and easy and could go straight to our room. The room was fantastic comfortable bed and sofa. Great amount of storage. Was very happy to see an ironing board and iron as my clothes were creased from traveling so that was perfect. The staff were all very polite always greeted you when you saw them about the hotel, they were also very helpful with directions and other queries. We also got to leave our bags there even after we had checked out so we didn't have to carry them around all day which was really helpful. ",5,2017,02,16
231,Decent Hotel - not a good night's sleep though,"I stayed for two nights.  The Hotel is clean and check in was faultless.  Very happy with the standard of the room for the price.

Unfortunately the walls are paper thin so you can hear everything that's happening in adjoining rooms, and maybe further afield.  

I was woken at 1am on the first night and 2am on the second by noisy revellers returning from a night out and having long, loud animated conversations.

Of course I understand people want to go out and have good time, but I was there to work and so need some decent sleep.

It's  not really the hotel's fault, but I can't recommend this for a business trip unless you are a very heavy sleeper.",3,2017,02,15
231,Breda's 50th,"Great place to stay. Fairly central for all thing fun in Dublin.
Stayed there for a friends 50th birthday party and it was a fairly last minute booking so was lucky to get in. Really friendly and very clean. Little expensive to drink at the bar but isn't that the same for all hotels.
Generally, a very nice place to stay.",5,2017,02,15
231,Great location ,"We really enjoyed our stay here, the hotel is in an excellent location where a temple bar is walking distance and it is close to public transport.

The staff were very friendly and the hotel was well presented. Our room was very clean and cleaned daily. The room came with a hairdryer and an iron which were handy. I noticed the walls were a little thin as you could hear next door speaking but that didn't bother me too much. There seemed to be a refuse place behind the hotel which could have been quite noisy but the windows did a great job of blocking out sound. 

We would definitely stay here again! ",5,2017,02,14
231,Great location,"Great location in Dublin  friendly helpful staff felt very safe as room card is needed to  operate lifts,security check who is entering hotel at night.
Excellent breakfast 
Will definitely return and recommend.",5,2017,02,14
231,Mike and the mechanics,"Had a good stay at jury's very friendly staff, had a few little problems checking in but they did their best to resolve it ,did not stay for dinner although if breakfast was anything to go by I wish we had booked for dinner food was very good and plentiful , would stay again maybe longer next time( thankyou)",4,2017,02,14
231,Costumer service,On arrival we approached the check in desk where the lady who was sorting or details was rude and lacked costumer service. We had a excellent day and with in 5 minutes she completely changed the atmosphere and attitudes. On the plus side the hotel was very clean and the rest of the staff where friendly and it is also located in a decent area. The only down fall was the service we record from one individual.,3,2017,02,14
231,Dublin 2017,"good hotel would use again, staff and food good, good position for city centre.
my only moan was no safe for passports etc and money so it meant having to carry for 3 days which i don't like too.
i visit Dublin regular for business and this was my first here.",4,2017,02,14
231,Birthday Dublin Treat,"This trip was organised by my boys for my birthday, the hotel was of a high standard beautifully clean staff were very welcoming and helpful. Breakfast was delicious would recommend this hotel Located nicely for shops.",5,2017,02,14
231,"Simple, clean and comfortable accomodation","Simple, clean, affordable and basic.

It is in a great spot in Dublin and everything was within walking distance. 

The room were clean and basic. I would recommend bringing your own toiletries however such as shampoo, conditioner, soap etc. you definitely get what you pay for and it's a place that provides the basics at its best within the economic expectations.",4,2017,02,14
231,The McGuckins,Excellent hotel in a fantastic location run by fabulous friendly staff. Great value for money. Will definitely stay here again and highly recommend to any thinking of booking this hotel for their trip.,5,2017,02,14
231,Smart hotel,"A lovely place to stay. Rooms excellent, service excellent.  Very good position  for sightseeing in Dublin.

The reception staff are so helpful and there is a very smart bar and gym.
The Reception is extremely efficient and staff there very helpful. Would not hesitate to stay again and recommend to friends.",5,2017,02,13

231,Upmarket ,"A really nice hotel with a high standard in all rooms and reception areas. Breakfast at 11 Euro is good value and front of house staff are friendly and helpful.
My trip was with a group of friends but I would recommend this for anyone single or couple it's really nice. Only one slight negative is the ongoing roadworks outside but they aren't going to be there forever. So give it a go you won't regret it.",5,2017,02,13
231,Great stay and warm welcome,"Nice to be positively recieved at a hotel with a genuine warm welcome , the team at reception couldn't do enough and had a great sense of humour. Breakfast was excellent choice and plenty full , 10 out of 10 guys.",5,2017,02,13
231,Simply amazing,"The hotel was spotless and the staff were just amazing! So friendly and helpful, it was a real pleasure! Explained everything without being boring and went above and beyond by allowing me to print my boarding pass for my return flight home ",5,2017,02,13
231,Ok but not great,Jurys inn parnell street had a lovely reception area but the rooms lacked the nice decor that the reception had and was a bit dated. The room was ok it did have a broken socket and some of the wallpaper was ripped. It was clean though and very comfortable. The bathroom was nice and clean however no bath and the shower cubical was tiny with rubbish water pressure and temperature. The room was quite cold too during our stay. The staff are really nice and friendly and we're happy to assist us with anything.  Although it wasn't an over expensive room I expected a little more and I would rather try another hotel than return to this one. ,3,2017,02,12
231,Very poor service in bar & restaurant,"Room adequate & clean but 8 people ordered lunch in bar & had to wait an hour for the last order to come. Apparently the printer ran out of paper!
Later In restaurant we told staff we'd 80mins before a show to eat. We again waited 40 mins for starter & main course ranover our time limit. We missed the taxi & had such a dash to get to show. Appalling & very slow service.",2,2017,02,12
231,Lovely Visit,"I have stopped in many Jury's Inn previously as they are reasonably priced. Finding a deal for this one again the price and location was my main reason for booking - with not extremely high expectations.

It started off disappointing as I'd emailed them in advance for further information but did not get a reply, however I cannot hold this against them as we arrived after an early flight just to drop our bags off but they had a room ready for us - I was impressed! The gentleman was very friendly and helpful even giving us a map and circling key areas to go to.

The room was spotlessly clean had everything you would need (except an in room safe) and more then comfortably had enough room for the two of us. The location was also very good just round the corner from a shuttle bus stop for the airport, lots of shops & can be in Temple Bar area in a few minutes.

We were told about there breakfast that you could get a better price if booked the night before. On our last day we decided to do this as we had a early flight back and for €9 it was well worth it, really good selection of food.

Overall we had a great visit and would not hesitate to stop here again. ",4,2017,02,11
231,noise room,"to noise.
i say to reception to leve me in nice view apartment and no noise but i think she no understand .
so i have a bad sleep
no good.

231,First time in Dublin!,"Stayed here for pleasure, location great, room good size and clean. Quiet so able to sleep!
I would say i think the room rates were steep and should have included breakfast! 
Earlier check in was a bonus! Lovely staff! 
Would stay again if rooms were more reasonable or included breakfast! 
",4,2017,02,09
231,Xmas present,"Great hotel good location staff very friendly, rooms clean, bed comfy and warm no complaints will book again if we come back to Dublin. Bus stop just around the corner and a good 10mins walk down to the main bars.",4,2017,02,08
231,Long weekend,"Stayed here for 4 nights to sample the delights of Dublin. It is in a great location for shopping, eating and drinking. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was spacious and a very comfortable bed. It might be an idea to put a couple of coat hooks up so you can dry your coat off when getting caught in the wet and windy weather. Breakfast was varied, hot, tasty and well organised. The hotel bar is very reasonably priced and the lady bar tender was a font of knowledge!
A great hotel to stay in.",5,2017,02,07
231,Pleasant hotel near all the stores,"Went there with my wife for couple of days for shopping. The hotel is well placed near two shopping centers and a lot of shops and stores are in walking distance. We took the aircoach bus from the airport and it stopped near the hotel so there wasn't a long walk to the hotel. The hotel is great, got the superior package and free wifi with my Jurys reward card. My wife is pregnant and we got a room on the other side of the hotel so we had to walk a long distance from the elevator which was not good but manageable. The bed was comfortable and we slept well. The breakfast table has a lot to offer and the food there was good. Overall a pleasant stay.",4,2017,02,07
231,Quit nice,The room was nice and had a comfy bed .I had a very nice sleep. The only thing was kids were only allowed in the bar after 9oclockThe only reason I was allowed in for the countdown was because of my mom. Although it was very convenient to go to the town.,3,2017,02,06
231,Fantastic hotel,"Have stayed in many Dublin Hoyels this jury's was by far the best, clean, comfortable and staff 100% friendly and obliging , I had to check out at 6 am owing to home crises, they made sure I was up , arranged a taxi and gave me a breakfast bag for my journey ",5,2017,02,06

231,Great location for a shopping trip!,"This hotel is in a great location for a shopping trip around Henry street, O'Connell street, and is only a 15 minute walk max to Grafton street too. You could easily walk to here from the aircoach stop. There are a few nice places to eat close by. The hotel itself is good, very clean, the room we stayed in was a decent size and very bright. The staff were very friendly too. This is a great value hotel for the quality and location that you get!",5,2017,02,06
231,Central location and great service,I was in this Hotel for a night. The room was great and the location is convenient too. The staff was friendly and cordial. I did not dine there but their bar was good and relaxing. I will definitely recommend this hotel for a short stay in Dublin.,4,2017,02,04
231,Good and Bad,"Good location.  Breakfast buffet was reasonable and plenty of it. Our room was comfortable. Bathroom basic,  toiletries bring your own.  Staff friendly. Lift up to room or restaurant requires you to use your room key.  Fine when it works. My sister was unable to get the lift to move when hers failed, fortunately someone got in the lift and their key worked. ",4,2017,02,04
231,Very good location,Very good location just a short walk from the GPO and an easy walk to bars and restaurants. They offer reduced price parking but currently the car park is a bit tricky to access because of roadworks. Staff were generally pleasant and very helpful and the hotel is modern and clean. The room was very comfortable and we had a good night's sleep in central Dublin. ,4,2017,02,03
231,Perfect All Round,"As this was our first visit to Dublin we wanted to stay in a hotel that was ideally situated for exploring the city and Jury's fitted the bill perfectly. Friendly staff, great room, super breakfast and evening meal. Will use again for future visits.",5,2017,02,02
231,SMELLY BATHROOM/TOILET AND POOR SOUND PROOFING BETWEEN BEDROOMS,"OK for 2 nights, but would not have wanted to stay longer.
Due to major r9oad scheme in N Dublin took 2 hours to get to hotel from city outskirts and needed to kidnap hall porter to assist in locating car park. Tad stressful and not best start to 70tth birthday weekend celebrations. Only having post code of D1 not very good for nat sav guidance.",3,2017,02,02
231,Monday 23rd Jan,"Had a great stay in Jurys, ideal location, breakfast was fab, dinner was delish and at a great price. Only annoyance was the parking but it was only 5 mins walk away, which is great for Dublin but not great if you have loads of bags. :)",5,2017,02,01
231,Girlie weekend,"Great hotel, excellent location ..... just round the corner from the main high street and approx 15 minute walk down to temple bar area.

231,Great Stay! Will be returning.,"We stayed here as part of a group party for a 30th.  The location was ideal for us with it being a 15 minute stroll to the Temple Bar area but also plenty of other bars and pubs right on our doorstep.  The hotel staff were helpful and friendly. Rooms were spacious with lovely bathroom, beds very comfortable. The hotel is great value for money especially for the location. Will definitely be returning and would recommend to others.",5,2017,01,31
231,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent hotel, great value and a great location!
Staff couldn't be more helpful and the deal set up with nearby carpark is very handy. I know the prices can jump around a bit on the Jurys website but I found the B+B option for two adults and one child great value compared to other hotels nearby.
Would have no hesitation returning and recommend to anyone!",5,2017,01,31
231,Location was good cand clean hotel,"Location was good 10 mins walk to temple area plenty of fast food around nearby.
Trip by bus from airport took  30 mins drops you 5-10 mins away from the hotel.
Taxi stop right outside cost 8.50 euro to the Guinness store house.

we had triple room 1 double and single no problems with the room tea and coffee in the room breakfast was very good lots of choice",4,2017,01,31
231,Great value if you are not too light a sleeper,"The pros:

+ Close to the center / place where the action is, without noisy folks exiting pubs;
+ Close to bus stops (both city bus and airport shuttle);
+ Friendly staff;
+ Very decent bar and bar-food;
+ Reasonably priced;
+ Clean rooms;

The cons:

- The heating/airco and other pipes and systems were a bit noisy (though we just slept right through);
- No small fridge (we don't care for a mini-bar, but a small fridge is actually nice e.g. for some yoghurts, etc);

Note that there was a TV but we haven't tried it (it was positioned quite awkwardly too). Also note that we were at the 5th floor, so we had no noise from the street level, but we can't say anything about the lower floors.",4,2017,01,31
231,Good value 3-star hotel with fab customer service!,"Couldn't be more pleased with our recent stay at Jurys Inn on Parnell Street. The team there did a fantastic job accommodating our every single request, from the day prior to arrival (checking on the possibility of an earlier check-in) until a few days after departure (having a lost&found item posted back to us).

In addition to this, the location is great - north of the river but very convenient, the rooms were decent in size and well maintained, and the hotel breakfast buffet with quite a few options. 

On a less positive side, the Internet happened to play up a bit and the bathrooms were not offering as many toiletries as other 3* hotels we've stayed at. Also there is no mini-fridge in the room or a safe box, but the room rates were quite convenient.

However thanks to the lovely staff attitude (Magda, Ross, Ann & FD team) my husband and I had an enjoyable stay & would gladly revisit this Jury's Inn again.",5,2017,01,31

In fact, we tried to book a room again for another night but there were no standard doubles available. We will definitely stay here gain, highly recommended.",5,2017,01,30
231,Great location,"Had a great trip to Dublin. Jury's Inn beds were comfy and bedroom well decorated. Windows won't open on some floors, although the staff will find a room with windows that do open if this is important to you, make sure you ask before you go or at check in. The bathroom was clean although in need of a bit of a refresh.

231,Great location,1st time the company used this hotel and everyone thought it was great. loved the rooms and breakfast staff very helpful carpark a short walk but you expect that in Dublin as parking is a premium we have asked the company to use this hotel when we return.,5,2017,01,29
231,Dublin,"Great hotel great location lovely friendly staff who kept our visit important to them.
I would definitely visit this hotel again both as a couple n with my family.
After visiting the hotel it has given me a hunger to visit more jury inns .",4,2017,01,29
231,Good comfortable stay,"Stayed for two nights, room only, costing £80 a night equivalent, had booked through booking.com.

Spacious room, well maintained. Hotel is literally 2-3 minutes walk from the top of O'Connell Street, so easy walking to most of the city.

Checked in early and our room was ready, so top marks there.

There's also a Tesco just across the road so nice and handy for snacks etc.

We didn't book the breakfast option, just because there are so many places nearby to have breakfast.

No view from our room, it looked onto a square in the middle of the building, but that was fine for us.",4,2017,01,29
231,Superb hotel ,I stayed here this weekend past with a group of 7 friends. Hotel superb from start to finish. Reception and bar staff especially professional and accommodating.

Very highly recommend. ,5,2017,01,29
231,Nice Central Location,"We picked this hotel for its central location and moderate cost.  Spent 5 nights there during the holidays.  Overall, a great stay.  Room was clean & neat.  It was nice to have central heating again!  Good breakfast and decent food in the bar too.  Mostly we loved the location - very easy to shopping and walking into the Temple Bar area.  Right across the street is a grocery store to pickup snacks and a bookstore.  It is in a pretty busy area  and they are doing construction but the hotel itself was quiet.  Not sure where you would park - we dropped off our rental car before checking-in.",4,2017,01,27
231,stay in Dublin,"i recommend the hotel in particular for the very central position and the cleanness of the hotel overall, average room, breakfast and service in general. we have been very satisfied in  particular by the being very near o'connel street.",3,2017,01,26
231,AdX Dublin Visit,"The hotel was well maintained and the staff was very friendly, It was a good experience to stay in the hotel. The breakfast was tasty and healthy. I would recommend this hotel for any new tourists in Dublin.",4,2017,01,26
231,Can't fault it,"Central location, polite and friendly staff, hot chocolate in reception, ice machine on every floor, clean room, quiet (roadworks outside at the minute but still ok) good nights sleep.  I really can't fault this hotel",4,2017,01,26
231,Very Good Value.,"I would highly recommend Jury's - very pleasant staff, comfortable/clean room, and excellent Irish breakfast - did not have to go looking for anything, good choice, food was hot and very tasty. Overall, a hassle free excellent breakfast experience. This was the highlight of our stay!",4,2017,01,25
231,Couldn't fault it.,"I have stayed at this hotel a few times, good value, service is good. Place is very clean and has everything needed. Only a short walk to the main and street and shops which is handy. Would recommend and stay again. ",4,2017,01,25
231,Great Hotel,"This hotel is ideally located for all the surrounding areas, hop on / hop off bus, airport transfers and shopping.  There are ice machines located outside of the lifts on each floor although you do have to use either your mugs / glasses to carry the ice back to your room!
Would certainly recommend that people use this - great pub just a couple of doors away - 'Parnells'.  Great place to eat is Flanagans which is just down on O'Connell St.
Overall, a great experience!",4,2017,01,25
231,Recommended,"This is comfortable, reasonably priced hotel in a good location. Excellent breakfast, great service and decent beds. Went with friends for a weekend and we all enjoyed it. Would definitely stay here again for our next Dublin trip.",5,2017,01,25
231,Very pleased,"Recently stayed in the Parnell street Jury's as I had stayed there during the Dublin City Marathon and was well looked after. No complaints other than the wifi was off & on which was annoying and unfortunately was the one time I needed it. The staff tried to rectify it and can't fault their helpfulness. Room was clean, staff were great & the food was great to. Room was a tad pricey at 155e for 2 for one night . I guess that's Dublin prices but had stayed in a London hotel of the same standard a week before for 2 nights for less money . Other than that everything was top class. Well done guys",4,2017,01,25
231,Cameron's from Leeds,"It was our first trip to Dublin and it was fantastic, the hotel was clean and well above our expectations. The staff were friendly and helpful and we will definitely be using the hotel again for our next trip in November. ",5,2017,01,25
231,Great trip,"Great location with 2 minutes to O'Connell street and less than 10 minutes to temple bar. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. 
Went to leave our bags around 10am as couldn't check in until 2pm but reception had a room ready and let us check in early at no extra cost ",4,2017,01,25
231,Walkable,"Was staying overnight and booked the night before, great location , close to all the shops .Clean and very comfortable rooms , cute lil bar had a nightcap there. The buffet breakfast was great value.Easy check in and out.",5,2017,01,25
231,Mediocre at best,"Hotel lobby is nice, and so was the check-in/concierge. Hotel rooms are just a bit blah. Nothing special, rooms were mediocre. Location is near Ilac shopping center and about 10-15 minute walk to Temple Bar which is nice. ",4,2017,01,24
231,Relaxing break.,"This was my second time staying in this Jurys. It's a great hotel, friendly staff, clan and comfortable. The location is really good and the hotel recommended car park is only a five minute walk and costs €10 only.",5,2017,01,24
231,Best Place to Stay in Dublin!,"This was the perfect spot to stay in Dublin. Not only was it about a three minute walk from the exact city center point, it was easy to walk all around Dublin to pubs, shows, Trinity College--you name it! Plus, as travelers who wanted to spend time sightseeing other areas of Ireland, it was perfect for catching tours out into the countryside. All the tours we went on met right by our hotel. It rained a lot of our trip, and we were so close to everything, we never minded walking, even when it was pouring. 

Aside from a great location, the staff was insanely helpful and kind. For everything we booked, they would print us out tickets and give us directions to make everything easier on us. The room was neat and always cleaned and restocked. My fiance loved breakfast at Jurys Inn so much, we would wake up early to enjoy the buffet before we set out for the day. The bar was also nice and welcoming for when he wanted to grab a drink before the night began. I highly recommend staying here if you'll be vising Dublin. Completely worth the price!",5,2017,01,24
231,Great Stay,"Speedy & friendly check-in.

Nice room with comfortable bed & extra pillows. Plenty of hanging & storage space. Tea/coffee making facilities. Good air-con. Iron & ironing board. Good Wi-Fi. No in-room safe. 
We were on the 5th floor overlooking Parnell St & it was nice & quiet.

Soap, shampoo & body-wash dispensers supplied in the bathroom. Decent shower pressure.

We booked directly with Jurys so breakfast was included in the price. Ample tasty selection of the usual breakfast buffet fare.

All staff, including breakfast, bar & reception, were very friendly.

Exit hotel right to O’Connell Street.
Exit hotel left & left onto Moore St for Henry St & lots of shopping.

There a number of convenience stores around the hotel to purchase snacks.

Connolly Train Station is 20 mins walk away.
Taxi to 3Arena is €12 or 35/40 mins walk.

Recommended & we will certainly stay here again when in Dublin.",4,2017,01,24
231,Nice clean hotel,"Stayed here for one night and found it to be a very clean, comfortable hotel. Bar was also very good, breakfast excellent and very good value, all staff friendly, would stay again next time in Dublin. ",5,2017,01,23
231,"Jury's, Parnell Street","Lovely hotel with friendly staff and very clean and modern. We didn't eat at the hotel. Great central location. The only one slight issue was the room temperature during the early hours, being too warm - even with the heating off. Other than this a great hotel and would definitely stay there again.

",5,2017,01,23
231,great hotel,"clean friendly and well situated to local amenities and close to connolly station, parking is very close by, 1 minute walk, drinks in the bar were surprisingly cheap, very quiet hotel and the ladies at the check in were very helpful and friendly",5,2017,01,23
231,Highly recommend ,"Just arrived back home after spending the full weekend in this hotel. Not a thing I can fault with it! Very clean, safe and welcoming with huge rooms and within walking distance of the main street and temple bar. If I visit Dublin again this is definitely the place I will be booking to stay!",5,2017,01,22
231,Average hotel at good cost,"The hotel was average. Check-in was quick and efficient. Rooms adequate, with large bathroom. I had no issue with wifi but did not attempt to stream anything. 

Located a short walk to the bars and restaurants. Had no issue with noise, either from inside or outside the hotel. 

The hotel does not have parking but validates for a car park a few blocks a way (10 Euros for 24 hours). The drive to the car park can be a pain, if the traffic is bad. All in all, not a bad place to stay in Dublin. ",3,2017,01,22
231,Awful service ,Arrived with another family having prepaid for two family rooms. On arrival advised there was an incident in the hotel and we were advised to go to the bar and wait at 11pm. One hour later we attempted to check in (we had 4 young children with us). At reception they were deadly with a drunken man who had fallen out with the people in his room. They then proceeded to give him our prepaid room! Ended up going to another Jury's Inn in Dublin at 2am.,1,2017,01,21
231,Good Value in Dublin,"Okay location in the north part of Dublin, not best for business travelers, not much facilities for business meetings.  Very unstable internet services.  It is really suitable for family and vacationers, it is good value and good services.",4,2017,01,21
231,"excellent hotel with good service, friendly staff and good situated.","my ratings will reflect how I think about the hotel. When you visit Dublin, Visit the Jurys Inn in Parnell street. Easy to reach with the aircoach from the airport and 10 mins walk to the Temple bar area",5,2017,01,18
231,Great Location with very friendly staff and early check in given,"Stayed as a group of 12 in January, Good central location. We were allowed to check in early by very friendly helpfull staff and didn't have to leave the rooms till 12pm. Rooms were clean and comfortable and would recommend and stay again. Thank you.

231,"Nice hotel, very central","The staff were very friendly on check-in, rooms clean, I didn't sample the bar as I had children with me but it looked nice and comfortable. The breakfast was fantastic, and a really good choice of food to cater for everyone. I will stay here again the room rate was good and worth it for central Dublin on a Friday Night I'm sure next time I will most definitely sample the bar.............................,................................................................................................................................................................................,,,,,,,......,,,,,.................................,.....,,.....;",5,2017,01,17
231,Fab weekend for my mothers 50th birthday,"Had an amazing weekend staying here, from check in throughout to checkout, staff are friendly and helpful, room was nice and warm, very clean, bathroom was fantastically clean aswell, and well equipped, iron and ironing board in every room aswell as handwash shower gel and shampoo, hand and bath towels available aswell, now on to breakfast, breakfast is out of this world amazing, they have everything available from cereals, to a help yourself cooked breakfast, fresh fruit, yoghurt, croissants, toast, tea, coffee, fresh juice, and many more would 100% recommend this hotel and stay there again you wont be disappointed.",5,2017,01,16
231,poor new years stay,"After booking well in advance and reading other reviews we were excited to spend new year in Dublin at the jury's inn, however lots of little problems built up to make our stay less than average. At first check in our room wasn't ready for check in time, we were offered a free coffee upstairs in the bar however we couldn't get up to the bar without having a key card so that gesture was pointless. When we eventually got to our room, it was actually a family room spilt in two by a door - this meant that we could hear everything the people in the next room and vice versa meaning our trip was not very private and put us off talking too loud in the room. Room service is offered all night, on our last night we came back and fancied a pizza so ordered room service at reception, he said we couldn't pay cash downstairs so to pay in the bar upstairs and to tell the staff our room number - when we got upstairs staff said we couldn't order room service as they had ran out of pizza dough (wouldn't have been such a problem if we were told this at the reception bar instead of a wild goose Chase round the hotel). If I was to come back I wouldn't pay the price of this hotel as the same service could have been offered in a b&b. ",2,2017,01,16
231,Mini break,"Fab hotel Spotlessly clean, wonderful staff and so close to Jervis and Illac Centre. Central to everything really. McDonald's round the corner, kids thrilled with that.. 99 Euro for the 4 of us will definitely be back! ",5,2017,01,16
231,Fab weekend ,"Spent the weekend from 7 - 9 January for our daughters 16 th birthday.  Put a couple of requests in for surprises for our daughter which were met to more than our expectation.   We had a surprise upgrade to a superior room which was fab.  Room facilities were brill,  the usual iron,  ironing board,  hairdryer,  tea coffee making facilities etc,  but we got a complimentary bottle of prosecco on check in.  This was gratefully received.  The desk staff were more than helpful and the bar and maintenance staff were wonderful.  There is also a gym on site which our daughter made use of.  

Location was fantastic,  more than enough shops and bars locally.

Will definitely be staying here again",5,2017,01,13
231,An ideal place to stay.,"This is a comfortable, relaxed hotel in an ideal location with professional and friendly staff, from reception, the ladies who cleaned the rooms to the bar staff. The food in the bar was reasonable and tasty and we were made to feel very welcome by the staff working there. Breakfast was delicious and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.",5,2017,01,13
231,Very good Hotel right in the centre of Dublin,"Stopped here quite a few times, will  be using it again God willing. Choice at breakfast time is fantastic, the only complaint there is the tempertaure of the food, eggs lukewarm not so pleasant. Rooms and everywhere very clean, staff very pleasant too, no problems at all. We highly recommend this hotel.",4,2017,01,13
231,Christmas Treat,"We stayed here overnight, with friends, during the festive break.  We paid for a superior room and were sadly disappointed. The room was just an average hotel room. It wasn't bigger or better than most average rooms in any other chain hotel.  With the superior room we had the option of a late checkout - we accepted this offer but the next day were asked to confirm the late check out (which we did) but then the keys wouldn't work. We had to spend valuable 'short break time' travelling up and down in the lifts - which needed a keycard to operate. Eventually the receptionist came up to open the rooms. The bath was amazingly tiny and low - which meant we struggled to use it, so weren't able to. Nothing about this hotel felt superior. Dublin, however, was very pleasant.",3,2017,01,12
231,quiet break,"This hotel is easily found close to all amenities and attractions, the tram is easily accessible as is the bus station..  Staff were friendly very helpful, and the bar was comfortable.  Food, not for the picky eater, menu is limited....  fresh grapefruit water in the foyer is always available.  The room was comfortable, and the air conditioning/heat was easily adjusted.",5,2017,01,12
231,Lovely hotel,We stayed for 3 nights over new year. Lovely clean hotel in the centre of town. Bar staff very helpful.  Reception staff were nice but not overly friendly. Would definitely recommend and would stay again. Quite pricey but it was new year.,4,2017,01,11
231,Very pleasant stay at this hotel.,"Look no further, I have stayed in many hotels in Asia and Europe, jury's inn I felt I'm secured and value for money. You will feel there genuine service and hospitality, especially in Dublin a lot of nice hotel but for me jury's inn is one I can recommend.

",5,2017,01,11
231,Short Dublin break,"A well located hotel in Dublin centre. Clean and neat. Well maintained with professional staff. Exactly what you need for a short break. Good price value if booked online. Many options for shopping, entertainment and bus tours. Everything in a range of less than 10 minutes. Taxis directly in front of the hotel, less than 5 minutes for all kind of public transports, excellent for airport buses.",5,2017,01,11
231,Long weekend stay to visit family.,"Our third stay at this hotel and it was as good as the first.  Comfortable room with good amenities, friendly staff and a good location close to the main attractions of Dublin. If intending to sightsee I recommend getting a ' Leap Visitor ' card for travel on bus, tram and Dart railway.",5,2017,01,11
231,New Year Family Stay,"The hotel was lovely very convenient, just let down by the service.  Check-in was a problem and our dinner experience not great.

Our check-in time stated 2pm, which we had made plans around, on arrival we were informed the rooms would be 40 minutes which we accepted and went to have a drink in the bar.  One hour later no availability and informed they would be no more than 5 minutes and the keys would be brought up to us in the bar.  Again after half and hour I went to reception where I was given 1 key but the other room still not ready.  I then went down to reception to wait on the other room key as I felt my presence was a reminder I was waiting.  Very disappointed, if told initially it would be 2 hours we would have gone to the St Stephens Green concert as planned and came back later rather than miss out on it! 

Dinner:
We were the only table of 13 booked I believe but I think this was to our determent as the people who then came in with no booking were all served and we were forgotten about, waited 1 hour between starter and main course then not given deserts and drinks until these were chased up.  Staff would suggest things were on their way when in fact they had no idea what was happening with our order.  We did make this known during our stay and apologies were accepted but this was not really acceptable as we also had a number of children who were actually very understanding.  I understand it was the holiday period but as a family from the industry we are very familiar with how important hospitality is.

Otherwise if using the hotel as a base it was very central and clean.  The staff just needed a little festive cheer.",3,2017,01,11
231,Great hotel,"In a great location, helpful staff, great breakfast. I am already booked to stay again this July.  10 minute walk from temple bar area, has own bar facilities that a warm and friendly. Beds are so comfy, slept really well ",5,2017,01,10
231,Great hotel,Stayed for a short break. Hotel is very good. Couldn't fault the staff as they were very very polite and helpful throughout. Restaurant  was also very good quality and the breakfast good too. Great location for almost everything.,5,2017,01,10
231,"Jury's Inn Parnell Street, Dublin.","Booked this hotel for a shopping spree in Dublin. Excellent value and in a central location near all the shops. Hotel was clean bright and airey,staff were very welcoming and helpful. Rooms lovely and comfortable. We had dinner in the bar and the food was excellent. A thoroughly enjoyable stay and will definitely be staying again.",5,2017,01,10
231,Very bad experience,Very bad and unforgettable experience. I will never stay again though this was my second stay. I will give negative rating and never recommend to anyone else. The duty manager are rude and very irritating. They have no courtesy to the guest. I will definitely sue them for mental harassment. The toilets seat are passing off. No proper heating.,1,2017,01,09
231,Brothers 30th birthday Jennifer duty manager was brilliant!!,"My family and I stayed here the 6th-8th of January to celebrate my brothers 30th birthday before arriving I emailed and asked if they could put something in the room if I paid like balloons or banner etc a girl names Miheala emailed me and said that would be fine she was then on holiday so asked Jennifer to sort it out for me. As I emailed Jenifer she sorted not only the room with balloons but complimentary prosecco & two chocolates she also phoned me a couple of days before confirming it all and sorted out an issue as my brothers booking hadn't been booked through Expedia although he has a confirmation email so if she hasn't had phoned I would have not known and my brother wouldn't have had a room. Overall she was brilliant her customer service is second to none unfortunately she was off duty so I didn't see her.
Rooms are nice just basic & beds comfy.
Location is very good for temple bar just w 10 min walk and a Tesco just opposite. Shops and restaurants near too. 
My dad said the Irish coffee was lovely also. 
Would definitely stay again!

Special thanks to Jennifer! ",4,2017,01,09
231,Lovely weekend break with friends.,"Overall a very nice experience. Staff generally were very friendly and helpful. Food was very good.
Perhaps the breakfast service could improve with staff providing tea/toast so that food doesn't get cold. Also, top up tea,etc in bedrooms daily.",4,2017,01,09
231,Love Dublino ay Jurys Inn,"I was there with my family at the end of December until 4 of Jenuary.
I spend my week there and i find this hotel very warm for people & for services .
Is very closed to the center and I found it very  comfortable.
I recommend it to all people.",5,2017,01,09
231,Brillant,"Home from home.where you could eat your dinner in the toilet.everywhere so clean,staff are supreme,they talk and crack jokes with you.a credit to management,and their selves.......The hotel is in the heart of Dublin and so central,your shopping is taken and cared for you in their luggage room,the staff treats you as one of their own and are abel to guide you where ever you want to go,if in Dublin stay here,you wont regret it and i will be staying there every time i go to Dublin",5,2017,01,09
231,Good stay,"Stayed here last weekend and all I can say is I would stay again when I visit dublin. It's about a 10-15 min walk from temple bar, a 5 minute walk to all the airport shuttle bus stations and it's clean and tidy.
It's nothing special don't get me wrong but for the price the location I think it's at really good value. What more do you need",4,2017,01,09
231,Awful!,"I do not understand the great reviews on this place! It looks absolutely nothing like the photos. My partner and I had just spent 2 weeks road tripping around the uk in a camper van. We were dying for a clean shower and comfy bed. We arrived at 7ish on the 6th of Jan. Firstly the reception staff gave us the number to an already occupied room. We tried putting our card in and it wasn't working then a lady opened the door and was quite surprised. Once we actually got our right room we were appalled! The room was dank and smelled awful. The sheets were rough and dirty. The bathroom was disgusting, the shower was covered in hair and mould. There was pee stains on the floor and it's extremely outdated. We showered in caravan site shower blocks better than that! We decided to stay that night as we were exhausted. I woke up that morning covered in dust mite bites! We left the next day, we had paid for 3 days but had no choice but to leave. We then booked a room at the holiday inn just down the road, which was absolutely lovely!",1,2017,01,08
231,Good on all counts,"Welcoming hotel. Friendly and helpful staff. Very convenient situation for visiting the city. Our room overlooked Parnell Street but was absolutely quiet, despite the road works outside. Excellent breakfast with ingredients that tasted of what they are supposed to taste of. And a heating system in our room with a control that worked as well. Good Wi-Fi.",5,2017,01,08
231,best stay ever,"room was ready on arrival.  All staff were very helpful, courteous and friendly. Dinner was amazing would visit hotel again for the food alone! .  Hotel is perfectly situated.  . Highly recommend.  Looking forward to our next stay.",5,2017,01,07
231,"Pricey, but you get a decent standard of accommodation.",Expensive but not for Dublin as we checked out of first hotel that had been booked for us and it was over a weekend. Room clean and fresh with the usual chain facilities. Didn't stay in hotel much so cannot comment on food or bar.,4,2017,01,07
231,"Would stay again,,,,,😁"," Hotel is very central,  Close to all amenities and city centre,,, and clean, 
 Staff are very helpful and friendly,, 
 We didn't have dinner in the hotel,

Would stay again,,,,,
 Car parking was a small  issue, 
 But you can get €10 overnight carpark in a short  distance away,,,,,",5,2017,01,06
231,Great Location,"My son and I stayed there and it was great. Having a full service bar and restaurant in the hotel was great. Room service late, probably had the best dinner on our trip in the restaurant. All of the staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is great near all but not in the busy part.",5,2017,01,05
231,Return visit for concert ,"Returned to Jury's inn Parnell street having stayed here in April!! 
Another great stay! 
Rooms clean, fresh & quiet. 
Staff friendly and helpful. 
Great location! 
Short taxi ride to the Olympia. 
Very short walk to O'Connell Street. 

There is parking at the closest Q Park 
Which is a short walk to the hotel 

24 hours is 25€ but if the hotel stamp your ticket it's only 10€ 
We were able to get it stamped while leaving the hotel, go shopping and then get the car & it didn't affect the price. 
",5,2017,01,05
231,very good location,"My husband and I stayed overnight in Jurys Inn in December last.   The location of the hotel is very central and ideal for shopping or the 3 Arena which can be reached by the Luas at Abbey St. which is  a  short walk from the hotel (through O'Connell St.).  The bedroom though immaculately clean was quite basic and it was disappointing not to have a fridge in the room.   The bed was very comfortable.   The breakfast experience was not great and in our estimation did not reflect the standards one usually expects from a four star hotel.    The problem seems to be that the diningroom is quite small for the number of people staying in the hotel and on the morning we were there there was a queue for tables.    The diningroom staff were very hardworking and courteous and did their best to accommodate everyone but I think the tables should at least be ready with cutlery, ware etc. already in situ. The breakfast was self-service and the food was good and plentiful but I think some work needs to be done with regard to the whole breakfast experience.",3,2017,01,04
231,New Year Stay in Dublin,"Nice hotel in a good location in Dublin, near the centre and all the shops. short walk to Temple Bar area,
The hotel is pretty standard, clean, decent sized rooms. 
The breakfast was good. Didn't have any meals but the menu looked good and very reasonably priced compared to a lot of places. I would say the menu choice was better than a lot of eating places in Dublin.",4,2017,01,03
231,Review,Everything about my stay was perfect. I am from Dublin city so it was nice to stay over in my home town. The room and service was great. I have no issues at all. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room although a little small was very cosy. The security within the hotel at the front door was excellent also.,5,2017,01,03
231,Great location value food  Staff very  nice Resonable prices in bar easy access to all facilities  you fell welcome and,Over our stay on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day we had great time for very good value Location of hotel is just great for city break - close to shops and main attractions Also hotel has good deal for carpark Would recomend to everyone ,5,2017,01,02
231,Stayed 19th Dec for 2 nights. 3 adults 1 baby. interconnecting rooms,"Overall stay was pleasant. Check in was swift and informative the second time we approached to check in. The first time we approached to get directions to the car park and were sent on a wild goose chase. The young gentleman on reception gave us the wrong name of the car park! driving around dublin city almost an hour! 

Rooms spotless and good size. Bathroom spotless and good size bath (my 1 and 1/2 year old loves the bath) . 

Breakfast was mixed experience. Food selection and quality was lovely but the staff! They are extremely unpleasant and its really offputting. They made me feel bad for asking for a high chair. No smile, no good morning, no offerings of tea or coffee or asking did we want anything from the menus on the table? i understand its a self service buffet but dont put menus on the table if there isn't extras you can ask for? One member of staff on breakfast was delightful and i wish i caught her name. she was welcoming guests (thank god it wasnt any of the other waitresses!) 

Other than the almost rude staff at breakfast our stay was most enjoyable. The hotel is in an excellent spot for shopping! We will definitely return.",4,2017,01,02
231,Great Location ,Clean rooms in a fabulous location. I liked the fact you had to use your room card in the lift to get to your floor; extra security is always a plus. Rooms are a little dated with the bathrooms needed quite a bit doing to them. Pillows are very uncomfortable but that is subjective and when we asked for new ones this was sorted immediately. ,4,2017,01,01
231,3 NIGHT STAY AT NEW YEAR,Excellent place to stay centrally  located rooms were clean and warm staff were friendly and helpful there was free Wifi in the room the range of foods available for buffet breakfast was excellent this is our 3rd time to stay at this hotel in the last 2 yrs excellent on each occasion.Vin-Ger,5,2017,01,01
231,Excellent place to stay!,Good hotel in good location. Excellent food good service would recommend this hotel to everyone. Families especially. Helpful staff on reception even had mince pies and hot chocolate in foyer to help ourselves to! ,5,2016,12,31
231,Nice Hotel,"Large, clean room. Comfortable and warm beds with nice hot shower. 

Really enjoyed breakfast, there was a lot of variety although steer clear of the coffee! 

Staff were all very friendly and helpful.

Location was good, close to O'Connell Street and then a 20-25 minute walk down to the Guinness Factory.

Parking was offsite (approx a 4-5 minute walk from hotel) rates were good.

Only cons from the stay - Wifi did not work in our room. Reported the issue twice but it was not fixed.
Also went to collect laundry from the front desk only to be told that they had forgotten to do it. However, they did refund the laundry charge immediately and offered a free breakfast voucher for the inconvenience.

Overall, a pleasant stay. ",4,2016,12,31
231,Expensive but excellent,"We stayed here in July as part of a city trip in Dublin.
The rooms were excellent, very clean, no noise and the hotel is centrally located. There are lots of supermarkets and shopping around it. 
The city centre is within walking distance.",5,2016,12,30
231,Christmas break ,"Arrived for a few days in Dunlin to have a wee break over the holidays and do some sight seeing. We both slept like a log and really enjoyed our breakfast! The rooms are not  big but a good enough size for a short stay. Everything clean with all the facilities you need. A good location for everything. In walking distance to all attractions and the train station.

231,Good location for our first trip to Dublin.,"We travelled to Dublin in April 2016, for a short three night stay.

It was our first visit to Dublin, and having had positive experiences with Jurys Inn in other locations, we decided to use this hotel in Dublin. 

Overall, we found the hotel to be clean, the room was spacious and staff were friendly and helpful. 

The hotel is in a good location to explore Dublin, and I would not hesitate to use it again.

",5,2016,12,26
231,Good hotel! really worth considering,All in all our visit was good. We booked 3 rooms for family. Situated at the end of O'Connell St there is a short walk to the shopping areas and just a hope over the river to the very popular Temple Bar area. We stopped 3 nights and because of our flight times we decided to have breakfast out so I cannot comment. Lots of alternatives so its up to you.,4,2016,12,26
231,Great,"I never looked for any other hotels. My only preference is jurysinn all the time...
Great place to stay. I feel comfort for location also it is worth staying and value for money. If you put comb, paste brush and shaver, it will be more helpfull...",5,2016,12,26

231,Really lovely hotel ,"Lovely hotel, very new and modern feeling. Staff were very helpful

Room was spacious, clean & had a great view of Dublin. There's several ice machines on each floor too. 

Location wise it's perfect for the airlink bus which is a 5min walk away on o'connell street. You've got a tesco across the road, a lidl 2mins away along with several fast food places and also some bars & restaurants. Plenty of other shops, markets, department stores &a shopping centre within a 5min walk away. You're about a 15min walk to temple bar. 

Murrays bar at the crossroads with o'connell street has the best food ever! ",5,2016,12,22
231,Brilliant Hotel ,The hotel is lovely - lots of nice little touches. The rooms are very spacious and the bathroom is also a great size!!The staff go the extra mile and there is also facilities to store luggage before and after check in! Will definitely return to this hotel. ,5,2016,12,22
231,Winter Break,"Stayed here with my Girlfriend for 4 nights in December and overall had a very good stay! The room was immaculate and cleaned well every day! Although we never dined there, the food looked very appealing and bar prices were competitive with other bars in the area. Its located only 10 minutes on foot from the famous Temple Bar district with a convenient Tescos and McDonalds near by. Only had a one slight issue on our last night with noise from an adjacent room in the early hours. However, the front desk were very quick to react and resolve the issue once they were informed. All staff were very welcoming and we certainly stay here again!",4,2016,12,21
231,Great location and clean hotel!,"Got taken here for my 27th birthday, weekend away in Dublin and it was great to walk into this Jury's Inn. Always quite a grand entrance and the gentleman behind reception when we checked in was very friendly. He gave us tips on what typically Irish places to go to (of course the Brazen Head pub was one) and we took the map and went round to each of the places he suggested.
The room was clean and big enough for even 3! and the bed is super comfy. The only thing was the bathroom could have done with an update as cracks in the floors and walls etc.. also the thermostat kept restarting and didn't stick to what we set it on. Other than that, the location is great - right off O'Connell Street, main shopping and although its a bit dodgy at night, it was convenient for walking around all day and to just relax back at the hotel. 
We didn't eat breakfasts at the hotel as had to pay extra which was a bit expensive but there is a wonderful breakfast place on the corner outside which we went for cheap food to begin our days!",4,2016,12,21
231,Family stay,"Excellenty presented hotel & staff. 
Rooms snug, clean & very spacious. Plenty of extra towels & the porter couldn't be more helpful with prompt delivery of a baby cot & bedding once requested :) Parking is however a major issue which needs to be addressed. Esp as wouldn't be walking in the dark to or from with a young family, or old for that matter . ",5,2016,12,20
231,"Good hotel, well placed, friendly staff.","Just round the corner from O'Connell street. Worked out at £90 a night, but I suppose the prime location is what makes it that. Never had to use the staff, but when they were needed they were spot on. Will most likely stay there again.",5,2016,12,20
231,Great staff,A very clean and well run hotel. Staff are always friendly and helpful rooms are of a good standard.Not far to work to Temple bar and shopping centres. Breakfast is good but a bit pricey but worth it if you don`t fancy venturing out first thing,4,2016,12,20
231,Review,"Really enjoyed the stay. Very near O'Connell street and Henry Street so it's the perfect place to stay if you're going shopping. Hotel is very clean and staff are ultra friendly. Only downfall is the beds are hard to sleep on. But, I would recommend staying here as you get great value for money ",4,2016,12,20

231,Excellent if not a little pricey,"Good location although Christchurch one is probably bit better for closeness to Temple Bar, etc, still everything is within walking distance and if you like shopping, this location is best.
Check-in staff super nice and friendly.  Special request for room was listened to and checked by Supervisor before I arrived - much appreciated and couldn't be more helpful.  Rooms clean, beds comfy and black-out curtains were much appreciated.
Negatives - pricey during Fri/Sat for what you get, good value otherwise.  No atmosphere in bar or restaurant. 
Tip for Hotel - mixed shampoo / conditioner never works for ladies with long hair - please get rid of it and get separate ones!",4,2016,12,15
231,Family time at jury's hotel dublin,Great hotel very clean great staff and food would definitely return very homely great location very helpful staff  went out of there way to help held our bags next day while we did more shopping would highly recommend this hotel ,5,2016,12,15
231,Lovely hot,"Jurys Inn is located very close to city center. Staff was friendly and serviceminded, the room was clean and good size. Bed was comfortable and with excellent black out curtains I had a very good nights sleep. Bathroom with bathtub. Water pressure in the shower was slightly weak for my taste. 
Air conditioned room, which worked perfectly once I'd figured out how it worked. Price value would've been higher if breakfast had been included. ",5,2016,12,15
231,Jurys Parnell Square,Very good location with reduced rate city centre parking. Friendly efficient staff & a very good breakfast. Nice bar with good barman. Very happy with my choice of hotel & the service provided. Booking & checking in was painless. Overall a nice experience in a good city centre hotel. Pity there is a lot of road works going on in the area but this did not impact on the service provided or sleep quality.,4,2016,12,15
231,Excellent stay at the Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street,"This is a lovely hotel in a very central location in Dublin.

231,"Front of house fantastic, great rate. ","Visited last minute for Am overnight stay with my hubby and little girl. The reception staff were so nice, we checked in late in the evening and they gave us a voucher for a drink. They took our bags to our room while we parked the car, theycouldn't have been any more helpful. Only downside was I ordered a babybowl for my little one and it was really bad mash potato and gravy. She wouldn't eat it. But can't really complain about that! ",4,2016,12,12
231,Average 2 Night Stay in a 'Superior' Double Room. ,"Location was the best thing about this hotel for us. Check in was good, the gentleman was very friendly and professional. 

Room was average, especially due to the fact that we were supposed to have a 'Superior Room' but what we were given certainly didn't match the photos we saw of this room when booking online.. 

As part of our package also, our checkout was meant to be 2 o clock but as soon as it was 12, our keys wouldn't work to our room and this was quite the inconvenience to us. 

In relation to the room, we found it cold at times. I found that the quilt of the bed was a very rough material, but the bed itself was fine. The TV had lots of channels, which was good. The bathroom was fine and clean, but the bath was tiny and nothing to what was portrayed in photos again.. 

We had a 2 course meal in the restaurant and really enjoyed it. The soup was gorgeous, and our mains were delicious. Very high standard quality and service was prompt, we really admired the restaurant itself. Breakfast here was also delightful, with everything one could need. Loved the hot chocolate! 

Room service on the other hand, could be improved. Layout on the tray wasn't great, sachets just thrown there etc. And we were given the tray to carry in ourselves! Odd.

Overall, the locations great, dining experience was excellent and the hotel itself inside is lovely - the only fault really would be the room. We would more than likely return though. ",3,2016,12,12
231,Convenient location and friendly staff but Overpriced for quality of hotel,"This hotel is conveniently for central Dublin.  Car park is a bit of a walk away but the hotel will hold your bags while you park the car. Very accommodating and helpful staff. The bedroom was basic, quite dusty and very small and squashed for a family of four. The children's sofa bed wasn't comfortable and up against the wall. The windows open outwards with no safety latches. Overall a basic hotel and overpriced for the standard of accommodation.  Breakfast offers good choice.",4,2016,12,12
231,Christmas shopping stay over. ,"Stayed here with my husband. 
Very warm and friendly atmosphere, comfortable beds, clean and modern room and every member of staff from reception, dining, hygiene and maintenance were so friendly. 
The hotel is very central right beside the Ilac center and Henry shopping street and a short Scenic walk to Grafton street.   We will most definitely return. Thank you. ",5,2016,12,12
231,Great Hotel,"This is a lovely clean hotel, in an excellent location for first time visitors to Dublin. It's close to great restaurants, bars, and plenty of shops!!

231,Experience in Dublin,The Hotel overall was really nice but they could do with better faster internet because I could not watch any of my movies on the net. But the staff were very friendly people and my room was always done up when I came back from work🤗,4,2016,12,12
231,Perfect location for first time visitors to Dunlin,"This is the first time I've stayed at a Jury's Inn and I was slightly apprehensive. However our room was available before check in, check in was smooth and the staff were helpful. 

Our room was clean and modern. For the price I could not find a fault (even though some of the neighbours were noisy at times). We had fresh towels provided each day, the room was well lit with lots of mirrors and the bed was comfortable. 

The location was perfect, so central with lots of amenities close by.

I would recommend and definitely stay here again. ",5,2016,12,11

231,Good Dublin Location,"We stayed here for two nights on our first trip to Dublin because of the location.  Just around the corner from O'Connell Street, there was easy access to the many tour buses that lined up there.  It was a nice walk to the Liffey and to Temple Bar area also.  For the price, the room was basic, but clean. We didn't eat at the restaurant or bar, but the reception staff was very helpful in ordering an early morning taxi for us upon departure.   We were pleasantly surprised with the nice view from our room!",3,2016,12,09
231,great hotel,Great  HOTEL STAFF AND LOCATION.  Good value for money. The breakfast was excellent with lots of choice. The bar was also really nice.  Right near to Henry Street. The hotel was very good on security and the bedrooms were well equipeed.,5,2016,12,09
231,City break,"A wonderful stay at Jury's. Fantastic from check in to departure. Very central, but quiet....everything you need for a city break in Dublin. Breakfast was very good. The Parnell Inn close by offered good food. The Hop On Hop Off bus is well worth the money, and the Guiness Storehouse and Teelings Whisky Distillery well worth a visit.",5,2016,12,09
231,Weekend break at Jury's inn,"Very clean hotel brilliant location close to the centre of Dublin near the bars and restraunts  and shopping precincts  Staff are very helpful. We would definitely go there again. Brilliant breakfast and nice bar area.

Placed well for sightseeing,shopping etc.

231,Still good.,"Visited here each year for the last 3 years taking my parents for a pre-Christmas trip. Jury's Parnell st is in a great location for all of central Dublin.  There are two things that make it particularly good for me,  It provides good value for money.  It is reasonably priced for a good standard of hotel.  The other thing that  makes it my first choice in Dublin are the staff.  Excellent attitude and customer service.  It felt like coming home.",5,2016,12,06
231,Very good hotel,"Nice Hotel, second time i stay here and evrythings was still perfekt. Near by shopping Streets and Temple Bar area. Wery good Breakfast, and the start was very helpful and friendly. I Will very Most recomended this Hotel.

231,Great Hotel,This Hotel is in an excellent location at the top of O'Connell Street. Room was lovely. Bed was very comfortable. Staff were all very nice and friendly. Only downside was the food in the bar. Food was nice but they were very small portions. I didn't have the breakfast. Would definately stay again!,4,2016,12,06
231,"Good location, needs some maintenance","We stayed in two different rooms over two weeks.  Initial stay (one week) was for my husband's business trip.  The room faced the inner courtyard, and was pretty quiet, no major issues.  After a few days in Cork, we returned to the Jury's Inn for another 4 nights, and this time received a room on the street side of the building.  Not as quiet, but not bad.  The carpet was stained, but the bigger issue was a horrible groaning noise from the water pipes each time the toilet was flushed.  I had seen a comment about this issue from a previous reviewer, but assumed it would have been fixed - I was wrong.  We also heard the groaning noise from adjacent rooms, so this is apparently an on-going issue.  (We did not want to repack and change rooms, so just avoided flushing during sleeping hours.)  I mentioned it to the front desk staff when we checked out, but they seemed unconcerned.  

As a matter of personal preference, they provide only liquid soap and body wash, in a fixed mounted location in the shower.  I found the dispenser quite awkward to access, and would greatly prefer a bar of soap (which I shall bring with me from now on).

Lighting level was generally quite dim and low, other than the bed reading lamp.",3,2016,12,05
231,Recommended,This is such a great hotel to visit. It is in a central location for visitors. I have stayed here numerous times over the years and wouldn't go anywhere else. From check in to check out it is always a great experience. The staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms have air conditioning the beds are really comfy and the room is always clean. Self service breakfast is really nice with plenty of attentive staff on hand to help. Bar food is also tasty and reasonably priced. Worth a visit!,4,2016,12,05
231,Perfect 100% recommended,"Stayed here for 2 nights.. from the minute we walked in the staff were extremely welcoming, friendly  and helpful.. tastefully decorated.. very clean.

231,first class,from the minute we walked in the staff were friendly and helpful rooms were very comfy and clean food was lovely hotel is around corner from o connell street so everything is close by and close to pubs,5,2016,12,02
231,Nice and Easy,"We stayed here while in Dublin with our kids.  When we checked in, our first room had a strong smell of cleaner, like a bottle had spilled, with a wet spot on the rug by the desk.  We tried to air out the room but that didn't work.  I called to the front desk and Jennifer sent up a custodial supervisor to see what he could do, but when it because apparent more would need to be done, she made arrangements for us to change rooms and upgraded us to a bigger room.  She was very friendly and apologetic about the problem, and we were more than satisfied with the staff's efforts to make us comfortable.  The hotel is clean, and has a nice restaurant and lounge on the second floor, making it easy to grab a nightcap.  Breakfast was good and there were lots of choices.  The hotel is a quick walk to everything, including Jervis Street shopping, O'Connell Street, the Ha'Penny Bridge, Temple Bar, Museums, Guinness, and everything else.  It is also a quieter and more family friendly option that some smaller hotels in the bar districts.  We were able to walk everywhere.  Would stay here again.",4,2016,12,02
231,Fantastic break !,"Lovely break in Dublin.. hotel clean , comfortable. Very friendly kind staff and a excellent atmosphere,  Breakfast was perfect very relaxed.  Location of hotel perfect for evening and nights out ! Temple Bar 5-10 mins walk. Located right by city centre !

231,Positive Experience,"I was well impressed with the security in this hotel and also with the friendliness of the staff along with the size of my room.
The location was very central and the bus from the airport stopped very close by.
I have stayed in Jurys in Dublin before and was always pleased.  Nice and clean the only downside was waking in the night to check on the U.S. election and seeing Trump win but I can t blame the hotel for that ha ha.
",4,2016,11,30
231,Perfect!,"After the night from hell in an airbnb I moved to Jurys Inn. Best thing I ever did.

231,Ok for the prize being paid,"Hotel is OK in general terms. Staff is very friendly and always available tovtake requests and location is very good if you want to be close to downtown Dublin.

The room was a bit small for two people but as we were only staying the night we didn't have much luggage so it was okay.

Great for a weekend stay in Dublin. ,4,2016,11,26

The bath was a bit shallow but filled in 25 seconds flat!
Wending machines on all floors and a free-for-all icemachine too.
Loved it.",5,2016,11,23
231,Cant really fault the location,We had booked up for two nights and had paid 443.49Euros for two nights in a double superior room. We both felt this was a bit expensive but the hotel had been recommended to us by family. Anyway we also when we arrived paid another 40Euro's so that we could both have breakfast on each of the two mornings. As you can see that gave us a total hotel bill of over 480Euros. We can say that we really enjoyed our stay. We can also say that we felt it was not worth that amount of money and for that reason I would look elsewhere when we next come back to Dublin. What I will say is the staff were excellent and the breakfast in the morning was delicious and plentiful. We never used the hotel for any other meals or drinks as we assumed it would cost an arm and a leg. It is in a brilliant location in Parnell Street which is one minute walk from O'Connell Street and the centre of Dublin. Security is good and we felt very safe. We did have a very rowdy crowd who came back to the hotel on Saturday night late evening who made quite a noise and this did wake us up. This could happen in any hotel in any location and never spoilt our stay as the noise soon settled down. Transfers to the hotel from the airport could not have been easier. We had booked Air Coach on-line and paid a total of 22Euros return for the two of us which we thought was great value. You have a safety deposit box in the front entrance but none in your room which is a shame. We never used this so I do not no what we would have been charged?,4,2016,11,23
231,"Great location, comfortable stay.","Stayed here for my partners Birthday. Arrived in our room to see balloons, chocolates and a little card saying if we went to the bar there would be complimentary prosecco. Lovely little touch. 
The hotel is in a great location. Walking distance from everything. 
The room was small, but comfortable. 
Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because it could have been cleaner. Lots of dust on top of things like the toilet roll holder, shower rail etc. Also on the morning we were due to check out a cleaner walked into our room at 9am! Bearing in mind check out isn't until 12, we were rather shocked and felt like we were being rushed out of the room.",4,2016,11,23
231,Simple.,"Nice place to stay. Very clean and basic. Very close the the city centre and all the shops and restaurants. 

Good wifi and tea/coffee/kettle etc all provided in your room. 

Would definitely recommend if you're visiting lovely Dublin. ",4,2016,11,22
231,Wonderful !!!!,"Came to Dublin with my fiancé for a few days break.
Had a wonderful three days at the hotel .... our room was immaculate and lovely and warm.
Hotel Staff were friendly and articulate in their work.
Would definitely recommend and stay again.
Thankyou
",5,2016,11,22
231,"An overall excellent Stay, a definite reccomend! Center ville","Nothing was bad, the service was good, the food was better and the bar above that :)
Everything clean, everything tidy and all the people nice. 
Both bath and shower in the room, that bath a bit shallow but filled up with hot water in about 30 seconds, which was crazy good. The air conditioning was almost too good :) easily adjustable or turned off if not wanted.

Love this hotel. A few minutes walk from everything and the bus tours stopped almost outside the hotel :)",5,2016,11,22
231,Great stay,"Just come home from a three night stay here. Simply its a really good hotel in a great city. 
The rooms were spotless and the beds comfortable. The standard room has a double bed as well as a proper single bed - not some fold out fragile kiddie bed. And that meant three adults could stay in one room and be quite comfortable.
I found all the staff - not just the front desk - very friendly, welcoming, helpful and cheerful which can be rare in city centre hotels these days. Nothing seemed too much trouble for them. They really are the most valuable asset of this hotel.
The breakfast was excellent. There was a wide range of choice - everything from fruit, cereals  and yogurts to the full Irish breakfast all served buffet style. A great start to the day!
The location is excellent just off O'Connell Street in the heart of the city. The city centre is fairly compact so most places are within a 15 to 20 minute dawdle, though there are plenty of trams and buses to get you where you are going.
Getting to and from the airport by bus is easy. We took the aircoach which runs every 15 mins during the day and picks up directly outside the exit doors to Terminal 1. It takes 25 minutes to the city and drops off directly outside the Gresham Hotel - two minutes round the corner from Jury's Inn. For us the location could not have been better.
We will be back for sure.",4,2016,11,22
231,OK but nothing special,"Stayed here whilst in dublin for my birthday. Mentioned at check in that it was my birthday, we go away every year for my birthday and always have a bottle of wine or an upgrade on our room but nothing offered. Room was OK and thankfully we asked for a room over looking the courtyard meaning it was quieter as there was a lot of noise from the roadside due to road works. Room could do with being brightened up a little as it was very drab. Had breakfast and asked for poached eggs, they were forgotten about so I asked again 30 minutes later. Eggs arrived and we're covered in a vinegar dressing and tasked sour. No vegetarian options and people were using the same tongs for every thing so overall I ate no breakfast. Wasn't too bad of a location but still quite a walk to temple bar. Overall hotel was OK but expensive for what it was and I wouldn't return.",3,2016,11,21
231,Nice stay,"Room and bathroom somewhat average but very good breakfast if you like the full irish breakfast, porridge, and so on. Coffee is okay.
Central location with short walking time to the river/templebar/center.",4,2016,11,21
231,Pre xmas treat,"Myself and my  two sisters were in Dublin for a rod Stewart concert.  I found it a bit expensive for the 2  nights, over 400 euros and that's without breakfast. We would maybe visit more often if prices were not so high.",3,2016,11,21
231,Great Central Hotel!!,"Lovely hotel, very modern and spotlessly clean. It's also very central so makes a good base for any Dublin stay! It's good value for money too! Breakfast was an all you can eat style and was delicious!",5,2016,11,21
231,Great nights sleep Great Hotel,"I had every intention of using the hotel as a base and going out for the night but the weather was so bad that I stayed in and had a very good experience eating in the restaurant.  I don't normally like hotel food but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the attendance of the waiter.

Excellent value for money.  I recently stayed in a hotel in Hereford for the same amount and it was dreadful",4,2016,11,21
231,"Great location, nice hotel","Went to Dublin with friends and thus hotel was in a good location. Rooms were very clean and spacious. Staff very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was excellent. Restaurant on 2nd floor and bar were very comfortable.
Lots of tram works going on in Dublin so a lot of disruption on the roads.
I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,11,20

231,Exellent,"Just stayed here for one night and couldn't fault at all.  Checked in early and left bags until room available.  Location excellent and no noise to be heard from busy road outside.  We had asked for a room with a good view and kids loved the high floor overlooking the city.  Breakfast was great.  We were even brought a card and birthday cake for my sons birthday.  The staff, without exception, were so attentive, polite and helpful and a credit to the hotel.  Will definitely stay here on our next visit.  Thank you",5,2016,11,20
231,Good Hotel,"Good Hotel, Excellent Location!

231,Gem of a hotel with diamond Staff !,"I stayed here in November as I was attending an event in the city centre

The hotel  has a great location and is superbly clean and fresh- we had a great night sleep , it felt like the rooms were so clean were noise proofed as we could hear no outside hustle and bustle of the city centre.

The staff were amazing from booking to departure-    the duty manager lizi  gave us an exceptional welcome  and arranged taxis for us so that we would not be late for our event. Anna the food and beverage manager was a great host and we thoroughly enjoyed  the great breakfast  on offer in the restaurant - it catered for all types. The bar was really relaxing and had a great atmosphere in there also

I cannot praise this hotel enough it really is a gem of a hotel with diamond staff to go with it",5,2016,11,19
231,Great,"9 0f us visited for a friends Birthday. Our flight got in early and we turned up at the hotel hoping to store our bags but luckily one of our rooms where ready so we were able to use it to freshen up immediately.
Hotel is in a good location - near to a lot of the shops and not too far from Temple Bar Area. 
Rooms were ok- beds comfy , tea coffee, Ito etc in the room. No safes in the room but available free of charge in reception.
Breakfast was delicious, great choice, definately no complaints.
Ate dinner in the hotel one evening, a couple of minute issues - table not ready when we arrived , but these were more than generously rectified.
Staff lovely - nothing too much trouble.
Would definately stay here again if I was in the area.",4,2016,11,19
231,Excellent hotel.,"The hotel is central located close to everything you may need, Room was nice and we couldn't find a better place for our holiday. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Many thanks to Alex for his professional approach (we enjoyed the tour you recommended).  We were pleased with our stay and we will come back for sure.",5,2016,11,18
231,Warm Shortbread Upon Arrival,"Excellent Service, Staff and room. Warm shortbread in reception when I arrived! I was working at night and so slept during the day yet I was not woken by the sounds of people going about their daily lives, which was excellent.",5,2016,11,18
231,Juys Inn Parnell Street,A very good hotel with excelent staff very helpful and friendly. super city centre hotel for any stay. The quaality of the bar food was good and delivered by friendly staff. we will be very happy to stay again when staying overnight in Dublin ,5,2016,11,17
231,"Great location, nice breakfast buffet, decent rooms","I stayed at Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street in November 2016 for 4 nights on a business trip and was quite satisfied.  My colleagues and I very much enjoyed the breakfast buffet.  It included a rich assortment of hot breakfast standards, a yogurt and fruit section, oatmeal with an assortment of fixings, and various buns and muffins.  The location was excellent for exploring Dublin in the evening.  Very close to the Henry Street pedestrian mall and a 15 minute walk to the Temple Bar district.  The rooms are fine with my only complain being the sofa and lounge chair design -- they chose style at the expense of comfort.  (I think you can have both.)  The exercise room is very modest albeit adequate, with one elliptical, one treadmill, and some weights.  (Would be nice to have a bench or even a chair to help with the weights.)  The staff was  pleasant and helpful.  I would certainly stay here again.",4,2016,11,17
231,One of the best hotels we have stayed in,Great hotel. My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary weekend. The reception staff were very friendly and professional. The room was clean and tidy with plenty of space. Breakfast was superb and the bar/Restaurant extremely comfortable. Great location for all attractions. I would definitely stay here again.,5,2016,11,17
231,Over night stay in Dublin on buisness,"I would recommend the Jury's Inn Hotel for anyone wanting a competitively priced Hotel which is well managed by welcoming staff, is clean and offers a good selection of reasonably priced food and drink and well located for the centre of Dublin. I was visiting on Dublin on business and the Hotel met all my needs really well. ",5,2016,11,17
231,Great hotel and location,"Second visit to this hotel.  Great location just off O'Connell Street, easy to reach by airport bus.  We'd picked a family room ( double and  single) for more room.  First room had an issue with heating- nothing after an hour.  The duty manager came up, offered to move us right away- ideal as this was to a warm cosy room.  Staff are really helpful, bar open most of the time, restaurant food looked good but we ate out. They're happy to store your bags once you check out, helpful with places to visit.  Only minus is that there's no safe deposit box in the room - they have the facility in reception but not the same. £ for £ I've not found a bettet quality location - look forward to returning. ",5,2016,11,16
231,A Real Lifesaver...,"We booked a business visit to Dublin to meet clients and prospects. Meetings booked, Hotel booked, Restaurant booked, however on arrival at the airport it transpired that the hotel that was booked (part of a chain) was outside of Dublin... In the taxi into town we tried to book our usual hotel but there was a two day conference and all the hotels in town were fully booked except a couple of rooms available at the Jury's Inn. Not normally a first choice of hotel but it was clean, staff very friendly, good size room and excellent breakfast. Although it's not in the nicest part of town, the hotel itself offers very good value and saved us from having to stay outside of town on this visit.",4,2016,11,16
231,Good location but sub-par service,"This hotel has potential but small things are overlooked. Had to ask for another room because the toilet was noisy. New room had heat issues (eventually resolved). TV didn't work properly until the batteries on the remote were changed (and even then it was poor reception/quality). Wifi was intermittent. Did not get a requested wake-up call. Despite this, the staff were generally helpful and responded to issues promptly.",3,2016,11,16
231,Overnight stay,"Very warm welcome . Large clean bedrooms.  Much nicer on the inside than you would think from the outside. Very good wifi. Didn't eat here so can't advise on those facilities. 

Tried walking to the hotel from train station, which should have took about 10 min, in the end gave up and took a taxi!",5,2016,11,16
231,Short break in Dublin,"After a stressful journey, we arrived and felt immediately welcome. The whole experience from check in, through evening meal and bar right through to check out were great. The hotel relaxed us and set us up for our tour round Dublin, for which it was ideally situated",5,2016,11,16
231,Dublin visit is a must,"A very good hotel in an excellent location, you can do everything by feet!

231,Good hotel ,"Well situated , hotel was clean with good amenities . Staff knowledgeable and helpful .

We were extremely happy with our stay. Andrew & Tracey from Australia.",5,2016,11,12
231,Great hotel ,"We stayed on a Thursday night in November and paid about £75 which was the right price. The hotel is conveniently located, a bit back from the main streets which means it's a bit quieter. We were on the 4th floor and didn't experience any street noise at all. The room was spacious and clean if a little overheated. We paid €20 extra for breakfast and though it's a bit dearer than other places in Dublin, the food selection was ample and we stuffed ourselves. The hot milk dispenser was a nice addition we haven't seen in many hotels. Would stay again. ",5,2016,11,12
231,Excellent stay,"Second visit to this hotel and it will not be the last.  We visited this hotel for my fiance's 40th and our recent engagement. A special thank you to Jennifer who made the whole visit seemless.  Balloons and a card in the room, a drink at the bar, early check in and the offer of a late check out. Fantastic service.  The restaurant was also worth a visit. Good portion sizes and reasonably priced. Would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2016,11,12

Taxi was arranged for us when we were ready to go to the Irish ferries Port just a few miles away. Dublin Airport is a 20€ taxi ride that the front desk arranged for us when we were ready. Easy walk to Trinity College Temple Bar District Liffey River and hop-on hop-off bus , new city tram construction a minor inconvenience, right around the corner just steps from the front door is a wonderful breakfast restaurant called Ann's Bakery and €5.00 scrumptious breakfast don't miss it plus 2 Doors over is the entry to the huge modern Mall",5,2016,11,11

231,Great Location and room.,"This hotel is well located. Although its on the north side of the Liffeny River, you can still walk to almost anywhere in Dublin.

231,Couldn't have wished for better,We stayed as a family of 5 and the hotel was ideal in every way. Everything was very clean with lovely large rooms.

Will definitely come back to Jurys Inn. ,5,2016,11,10

231,50th Birthday Weekend Break,We booked 2 nights for 4 of us using a flash sale so they were £39 per room per night - amazing value for money.  We didn't book food and ate at the very good In Cahoots café across the road and had bar food on the Saturday night which was excellent. All the staff were very helpful and friendly and the room very clean and comfortable.,5,2016,11,09
231,Good hotel in a great location,"The location was great for shopping, close to tourist attractions and restaurants. The staff were friendly and efficient.

231,Quick night away in Dublin,"I quite like this hotel for its ease of access.

231,Short and sweet,"Excellent stay at the Jury's inn, staff were extremely friendly, polite and helpful. The breakfast we received was also of good quality and a wide range of choices.

231,Birthday treat,"Stayed at the Jury's Inn Parnell street for a couple of nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. Hotel was easy to find and staff friendly and helpful. Breakfast was great and set us up for the day. Only a short walk to the city centre. Parnell Heritage bar and grill on the corner well worth a visit, variety of food on offer and plenty of Guinness! Very enjoyable stay.",5,2016,11,08
231,Has all the basics but?,"Difficult one this because it does have all the basics but rooms are on the small side, parking is a bit of a walk from the inn unless you use the one around the corner at full rate. While the room was clean it gave to feeling of a motel rather than an inn or hotel.  Public areas looked great.  Expected more from Jury's so a bit let down.  It is very central and priced well for its location which is probably the best I can say about it.",3,2016,11,07
231,"Nice Hotel, great stay","A nice hotel, with friendly helpfull staff. in great location.

Room and bathroom were a decent size. Very clean and well equipped.
Only negatives was that there wasn't a safe and I didn't like the door interconnecting the room next door. 
Didn't try the breakfast but used the ice machine located on the corridor. There's also vending machines on each floor.
Would recommend. Location good, just around the corner from O'Connell Street. ",4,2016,11,07
231,BEST HOTEL IN DUBLIN,"Staff soo KIND and friendly. Room soo clean and fresh. Had 6.00am breakfast before DUBLIN city marathon. Breakfast was soo nice.

Already booked for next year. 5 stars all round ",5,2016,11,07
231,A great stay at a reasonable price,"A great stay at a reasonable price. Beds are comfortable, breakfast is great. But best of all is the staff who were always friendly and helpful.

231,Great Location,"A decent priced hotel with location right around corner from main road and airport bus.  We had booked this for a group from work and were very happy with all the facilities.

Hotel rooms clean, breakfast was a good selection of hot and cold. Staff friendly. Cant fault!",5,2016,11,07

231,Great experience,"We travelled down during the Halloween weekend, a Bank Holiday and the Dublin Marathon all at the same time!
Hotel and service was very good despite being very, very  busy. A special thank you to Alex who looked after us like long lost friends. His attitude and helpfulness was brilliant. The hotel is just around the corner from Henry St. a major shopping area which went down a treat with the females in our group. A ten minute walk to Grafton St. and less to Temple Bar. When the chaos of the work being carried out on the Luas is completed it will be a wonderful area to stay in.",4,2016,11,05
231,One night stay ,"Very helpful staff ,, great location ,, we had a great nights sleep lovely bed and nice and quiet , for a city hotel ,, breakfast was just ok hot breakfast was cold ,, bar lovely with nice snacks ,,girl on reception very nice and professional ,, nice to be able to leave our bags on checkout for a few hours , as we waited on the bus 
",4,2016,11,04
231,First trip to Ireland,"This was our first trip to Dublin and we found the hotel is in a great location to the heart of Dublin.   Within walking distance to almost everything.  We booked through a tour guide and found the staff to be very helpful, the rooms were clean, and the breakfast (which is included) was first class.  Room for 3 people was a bit small.  We stayed two nights and then 10 days later stayed another night to fly out of Dublin.  We saw two different rooms and they were pretty much the same.",5,2016,11,04
231,Marathon effort,I stayed in Jury's as I was doing the marathon on Sunday morning. The hotel were excellent after the race and permitted my wife and I to use a pre cleaned room for showering afterwards even though we'd already checked out -  a great touch. We had as long as we needed and lots of fresh towels. The hotel had retained a member of their morning staff to facilitate cleaning afterwards. There was also an extra early breakfast to enable runners more time and a great buzz in the hotel. Would definitely use again! Many thanks,5,2016,11,02
231,Small room with dirty stained towels and not heard back about my iphone charger 2 weeks on!!!,The room was expensive than last year. The room was small and it took a long walk to get to it. TV reception was poor and nothing great about tv channels. Breakfast was fine but coffee was ordinary and not wonderful. Orange juice was very sweet. I wouldn't go back. The restaurant closes early. There are much better hotels in the city.,2,2016,11,01
231,Comfortable with very supportive personnel,Hotel is conveniently located for exploring the city center and offers comfort and  silence for exhausted travelers. Architecture and modern facilities in the hotel reflect Dublin's style and city's versatility. Fully operational amenities and very supportive personnel will satisfy business travelers' expectations. Worth coming even for a single night stay.,5,2016,11,01
231,Halloween in Dublin,This a great hotel both for location and standard of accommodation. The rooms are very spacious and spotless. Bed is very comfortable and not much noise from outside. The breakfast was superb. Would certainly recommend this hotel and we will be back.,5,2016,11,01
231,Good hotel in fantastic location,"In the centre of the city, on Parnell street is this gem of a hotel. It is priced fairly for Dublin  and is exceptionally clean. 
The reception staff are super friendly and helped with directions.
Food was hotel standard. Rooms were lovely, and surprisingly quiet",4,2016,11,01
231,October Dublin stay,This is a fantastic hotel and is ideal for exploring Dublin. The room and bathroom was excellent. The receptionist staff are so helpful and caring. Breakfast was really good. I would recommend staying at this hotel. ,5,2016,10,31
231,Great location and great hotel ,"Booked this hotel purely for its central location but I was extremely impressed with everything else this hotel had to offer. Extremely lovely staff and nice, modern rooms. I will happily stay in this hotel again. ",5,2016,10,31
231,A very good hotel at a fair price,"Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street is a very nice hotel for a fair price. The staff is very friendly, it's clean and tdy, the breaktfast is very good, all in all, this hotel can be recommended ! The only thing which they should take care of is the keycard system which sometimes didn't work as it should in the elevators, but this was just a minor incident.",4,2016,10,31
231,Good as the Gresham,"Good, clean hotel. Up to US standards. Pricey by our experience but you get what you pay for. Staff was pleasant and helpful. I would stay here again unless I was convinced something less expensive with similar amenities was available.",5,2016,10,31
231,"Good location, ok breakfast","Very standard, run of the mill hotel, not very charming but nothing wrong at all. The rooms are relatively small, the wifi is quite slow, the breakfast room was noisy and crowded towards the end of breakfast.",3,2016,10,31
231,Great hotel with great staff and good breakfast,"We very much enjoyed our 5-night stay at this hotel. The staff were absolutely great, always helpful and with good suggestions for restaurants. The hotel was well situated - slightly out of the bustling city centre, but close enough to it - only about a 10-15-minute walk away. The bus stop for buses to/from the airport was about 5 minutes from the hotel on foot - just around the corner on O'Connell Street. The tram (luas) stop - Abbey Street - was about 10 minutes away. The hotel was also next to Chinatown and there were several great restaurants to choose from here. Breakfast was always very good, with plenty of hot and cold choices. The hotel bar was also a nice place to cap off a busy day of sightseeing. I would happily stay at this hotel again.",5,2016,10,31
231,Excellent Location.,"This Hotel is located in a good walking area of Dublin. The hop on hop off bus is also located just around the corner from this Hotel, being stop No. 1. There is also a good shopping centre nearby and able to walk to all other areas of Dublin.  Clean, comfortable and helpful friendly staff. Would stay here again.",5,2016,10,30
231,Excellent Hotel,"The hotel is in a good position for shopping, museums etc. A ten to fifteen minute walk to the River.  Nice big rooms, comfy beds and a very good buffet breakfast.  There are secure rooms for storing your luggage on arrival and departure.",5,2016,10,30
231,Well located hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Getting to the hotel from the airport was easy: by cab it was around EUR 30. On our way back to the airport we took the aircoach which has a stop around the corner on O'connel street, another convenient option.

The location of the hotel is excellent: very close to O'connel street which is one he main streets of Dublin. The center of Dublin is compact so most attractions are within easy walking distance: we were happy to be so close to almost everything. 

Check in went fast. We found the hotels in Dublin quite expensive and think the Jury's Inn - although still expensive -  is good value for money compared to a lot of other hotels in Dublin. The entrance and corridors look very standard. The room (a triple) was clean, well maintained and comfortable but relatively basic.We didn't mind because we were out of the room most of the time.

Breakfast had a good variety of items and was ok at EUR 11 per person.

Overall we think this hotel is a good option for visiting Dublin because the hotel is in an excellent location for sightseeing and it is good value for money compared to a lot of other Dublin hotels.",4,2016,10,30
231,Very nice!,"Located in a decent area for walking. You'll have to walk a few miles if you want to get to Temple Bar area and Trinity College places like that, but there are plenty of taxis if you don't want to walk. Security is a nice feature here. Must have key card to use the elevator and I'm pretty sure I saw a security guard in the lobby last weekend. Hotel staff is friendly and hot, good breakfast. ",5,2016,10,29
231,Perfect,Given the shortage of hotel rooms in Dublin Jury's inn don't overcharge. Always clean comfortable and quiet . The staff are friendly and helpful. The location is central so it's usually the first hotel in the city I try for a room in.,4,2016,10,29
231,BRILLIANT!!!!!!,"Stayed at the Jury's Inn for 2 nights for a friends birthday and it was one of the best hotels i have stayed in. The room was spotlessly clean with a range of facilities including an iron/ironing board, kettle, tea, coffee, ice machine, tv and lots of storage space! Rooms were cleaned daily with bedding and fresh towels provided upon request. At an additional small cost breakfast was provided and tasted excellent with all fresh foods and drinks. All of the staff that i encountered were very polite and helpful and were happy to give advise about the best places to go in the city. Jurys Inn is located in central Dublin close the all of the main transport systems (buses, coaches and taxi ranks) bars, theatre, shops and amusement arcades. I will be returning and if your thinking about visiting Dublin, i do recommend this hotel for a happy and stress free stay.",5,2016,10,28
231,Definitely not excellent,"Average about sums it up. Had picked this place because it offered ¨parking¨ on it´s website but it took about 15 minutes to drive to the garage (a few blocks away, but a maze of one-way-streets to get there). Breakfast buffet was nice, but other than that, an unremarkable place and the neighborhood is somewhat sleazy, at least on one side. And it was certainly not cheap.",3,2016,10,28
231,Nice stay,"Excellent Hotel... Excellent Staff... Clean and Quiet Rooms and without a doubt the most comfy hotel bed we have ever slept in...
Was tempted to try and smuggle it home... 
Very good breakfast to suit all diets  and a nice bar in the evenings. 
Third time at this hotel and hope to return next yeat",5,2016,10,27
231,Visiting family,Staff were frendly and  accommodating - would  recommend this hotel for a visit to Dublin.  The breakfast was  plentiful - but I would have liked for the staff to escort me to my table - otherwise it seemed like a free for all which I did not feel comfortable with. Apart from that it was perfect. ,5,2016,10,27
231,Long weekend break.,Jurys inn Parnell street is a great location for Dublin. All public areas are clean and presentable. Bar facilities are excellent and the bar staff are very friendly and helpful. We ate in the hotel one night and the service was very good and the food was brought out piping hot. Some specials are added to the standard list if you require it. Breakfast could do with a bit more choice but will be adequate for most people. Breakfast is a buffet service so you can go up as much as you want to. You can even have a scone if you like. The rooms are of a good size but the room we had could have done with a new mattress as it was making a squeaking noise every time you moved. The bathroom is quite large but the tiling on the floor are looking a bit tired. I would still recommend this hotel and will look at this hotel for my next stay in Dublin especially for its location and access to the tram and busses. ,4,2016,10,26
231,A to Z happy days hotel,"Great place for shopping great breakfast ,good restaurant fun caring staff,ideal for family to just having a night out.id firmly recommend this hotel nice cozy bar for having a few before you go out or just staying in,good room service if you got kids Eastport choice.",5,2016,10,26
231,Lovely stay,"We stayed for 2 nights over the weekend and it is a lovely hotel. Don't let the work on the team line put you off as it cant be heard inside. 
The breakfast was lovely and worth the 11 euros as there is a great choice.
The food was good in the bar too. ",5,2016,10,26
231,Brilliant ,"Travelled here with a group of friends from manchester. Only stayed the one night. Hotel was lovely, easy check in, lovely rooms and great bar. Very clean. Staff friendly and helpful. We stayed on floor 4, the bar was on floor 2. You could ride in the lift to the secong floor but any further you needed to insert your room key into slot in the lift. Excellent location and easy enough to get a taxi outside. Would definately stay here again.",5,2016,10,26
231,First time in dublin,First time in dublin and really enjoyed it transfer from airport via number 747 bus was easy and only cost 20 euros return. Loved temple bar but thought beer was a tad overpriced probably due to greedy taxation by government??,5,2016,10,26
231,Gets less welcoming on every visit,"I've stayed here several times this year, and on each occasion it seems to be less welcoming than the last.
Positives....the breakfast is excellent, the rooms are clean with the luxury of a bath instead of just a shower, comfortable beds and a fairly easy check in and out. Convenient for town and the Luas is a 15 minute walk. Within a stones throw are supermarkets, pubs, restaurants, the Aircoach, and a taxi rank is right outside the door.
My main complaint is that I work regularly every second week in Dublin, and my days are quite busy. During the summer, this hotel opened up its inner courtyard which had tables, chairs, large umbrellas and was perfect for us smokers to relax, work and wind down at the end of the day, without upsetting anyone.
This area is now closed off and we smokers ( and there are many that stay here ) have to now stand at the front of the hotel. This isn't at all ideal. Apart from the discomfort, the foyer now smells of smoke, which isn't acceptable to the non smokers and it makes stays here now very irritating. 
I would like to be able to eat here in the evenings and retire outside for a coffee and a cigarette, but I go out to the local restaurants who cater very nicely for us by providing outside eating areas which are heated, pleasant and allows everyone to enjoy their dinner.
Also, the staff at Jury's can occasionally be brusque and unhelpful.....it needs to be remembered that those of us who work away would appreciate a friendly face at times, especially when a problem needs to be reported.",3,2016,10,26
231,Fantastic hotel!,"Excellent hotel! We visited to celebrate my partner's 30th birthday and had a wonderful time! Friendly and helpful staff and check-in was quick and hassle free. The team had arranged that balloons, a card and chocolates were placed in the room prior to our arrival which was a lovely touch! We were also treated to a glass of prosecco in the bar! The breakfast was amazing, so much choice. Far better than most hotels we've stayed at. The warm pain au chocolat were delicious. Situated in a good location only a short walk away from shops and the temple bar area. We wish we would have booked to stay for longer. Highly recommended and will definitely return to this hotel.",5,2016,10,26
231,"Pretty good, but some basic errors let it down","We had a 2 night stay in October 2016 with a couple of friends and overall the hotel was good but a few things let it down. 

Firstly, the tea and coffee facilities were not replenished for our second night in our room, and our fellow travellers didn't get the complimentary biscuits on either night of the stay. Secondly, there was no brown sauce at breakfast (an overdue delivery apparently). Thirdly, for vegetarians there was a lack of mushrooms served on the breakfast buffet.

Although these were finally minor niggles, for the price we paid, we expected more. Staff were friendly enough and the rooms were a good size, clean and fairly modern. Location wise, it's at the top end of Dublin, so a fair walk from the main attractions (Temple Bar, Guinness Factory, Teeling Distillery etc.), but walkable. ",4,2016,10,25
231,Enjoyable short trip,"Location perfect for city exploration. Great transport links. Hotel clean with friendly and helpful staff, but rooms could have been quieter as bathroom fan could not be switched off.
No biscuits, safe fridge and a wee bit mean with tea bags etc otherwise a fine hotel.
Go see Epic Ireland!",4,2016,10,25
231,Good hotel at reasonable price,"Clean, basic, nice and  adequate room (except no safe or fridge which is not ideal). Good breakfast, helpful staff, well located in heart of the city, easy check in and check out, overall good value for money option",4,2016,10,25
231,"Stay at Jurys Inn, Parnell street","Overall the hotel was good. Prize / quality ratio could be better though... Breakfast was quit expensive. Hotel was very large, good for business trips. Staff was friendly. Cleanliness was OK. Next time around I would opt for Gresham, or the Central...",3,2016,10,25
231,Great hotel in Dublin city centre,"With a pleasant staff, perfectly located, a pleasant bar and great food at the restaurant this hotel is perfect for both a business trip as well as a city break. There are lots of shops in the vicinity. The Airlink bus connection to the airport is easy and inexpensive.",5,2016,10,25
231,Great location and friendly staff!,"We stayed at this hotel in October 2016. It is very well located near the top of O'Çonnell Street and close to the sights of central Dublin. The room was spacious and clean. The staff were friendly and efficient. A stand-out was Alex, the concierge, who was friendly, efficient and very helpful. Check-in and check-out processes were quick (even given the number of guests arriving all at once!) I would recommend this hotel without reservation!",5,2016,10,25
231,"Well located, clean, comfortable hotel in Dublin","We had a wonderful stay at Jury's Inn Parnell Street.  It is very conveniently located to restaurants, shopping and sites.  Friendly staff.  We opted for the breakfast and it was very good.  The walls are thin if you get loud neighbors.",5,2016,10,24
231,Fab,"Had a fab weekend, hotel was close to the pubs, bars and restaurants. Fabulous food. Friendly staff, especially in the bar. Very clean everywhere.security very good. Expensive but you pay for what you get. Could of done with a better pillow but really just my preference.",5,2016,10,24
231,City Centre Easy Access,The staff here are so friendly and helpful. They know loads of knowledge about the city and recommend restaurants and bars to visit too. The rooms are quite a decent size and really nice. For Dublin prices it was really good value. It's located in a central spot and easy walking access to Dublin. This is my all time favourite city with so much to see and do. Highly recommend this as a great place to stay if you're on a city break!,4,2016,10,24
231,Great hotel,"Just returned from two night stay at Jurys inn....excellent location, excellent breakfast ...and spotlessly clean. On arrival at airport realised I'd left my phone at hotel...excellent customer services from Velina arranging for phone to be returned..would highly recommend and will definitely return.",5,2016,10,24
231,Jury's Inn Dublin ,"Just arrived looks great watch this space 
Excellent weekend base friendly welcoming staff. Bar matches local prices. Very good breakfast. Clean and well maintained room housekeeping staff cater for requests within minutes",4,2016,10,24
231,"Janet,Geoff parkinson from bury Lancashire","This is the second time we have stayed in this hotel first time was 9 years ago lovely and clean breakfast was excellent it's so near everything we went to Parnells bar very friendly if you want more going on its temple's bar 
It's Quite expensive the longer you stay out the more expensive it gets 
As for the trips we went on the hop,on bus red one then the Guinness factory if you go this go early we got the 9 o'clock one just over the road from the hotel it's  cheaper getting your tickets when you get on take a warm coat hat,gloves if you're a cold person like me but overall it's a great place",5,2016,10,24
231,Location and service,"Good visit for two nights with a family. Location and service first class. Dublin hotels quite pricey in general, here good 3 star value. Dublin lacks attractions for kids, no amusement parks. Zoo was good as weather was exceptionally dry.",4,2016,10,23
231,Close to the centre on north side of the city,"The room was large and we were up on the 5th floor. Reception clean and open, workersat desk very helpful and polite.
Room had air conditioning and NON SMOKING.  No safe in the room but valuables could be left at the reception in their safe. No fridge in room . Iron and board in room and hairdryer (which was bolted into the drawer of the dresser!). Laundry service available  ($). Tea /coffee in the room with a kettle. Ice machines on each floor as well as vending machines. Free wifi. 
Car parking available  ($) and gym on 2nd floor.
Breakfast buffet good for full breakfast (hot) as well as cold choices.",5,2016,10,22
231,Great hotel and central location ,"This hotel was everything reviews claim.  The breakfast is also very advanced to most hotels. 

The location is great for access to the river, Trinity University, transportation and many places to see. 

The tram lines are only a 10 minute walk.  There are bus terminals all over.  Again the location is very nice.  

There are also a couple of markets in vicinity which is very convenient.  

Enjoyed the room and bathroom with a nice shower.  Feel confident staying here. ",5,2016,10,22
231,Very nice,"Clean rooms, helpful and friendly staff, the size and condition of the rooms were great. The hotel is just around the corner of the Jervis shopping centre and not too far from anything, excellent! Only thing I was missing was personal touch in the room, it looked like any hotel room at anywhere in the world. Breakfast was very basic but filled the stomach well. Overall, I enjoyed my stay!",4,2016,10,21
231,Wonderful Experience,"This was my first time staying at a Jurys hotel.  What a great experience.  We stayed 5 nights and enjoyed every one of them.  Staff was excellent.  Friendly, professional and helpful in every way possible.  Breakfast was first rate.  Loads of hot and cold choices.  All were properly made and fresh and tasty.  Room was super quiet and very large for a major city.  The location was perfect.  10 minutes to the city center, and just steps away from public transport.",5,2016,10,21
231,"Functional, clean and cheap","Nice bar, restaurant not bad. Breakfast choice good. Good location. At the time of travel there were tram line works going on outside. In a way this was good as it reduced the amount of road traffic (the hotel is on a main route into town (single carriageway). Shopping, bars and restaurants  are very close as are most Dublin sites of interest. Excellent for a short stay (5 days or so).",4,2016,10,21
231,Good experience!,"I do recommend: Good service, near center, good rooms, good breakfast, all staff members were kind and helpful.
All of the common areas in the hotel were organized, clean and taken care! The room was very good... An experience to be repeated!",4,2016,10,20
231,Good hotel for staying in Belfast,"Stayed for 2 nights in the hotel. Quite recent rooms with coffeemakers, bath/shower and air conditioning. Friendly personnel. Good breakfast. Everything that you would expect from a hotel. I heard from my Irish colleagues, that the district is considered as not safe, so beware. During the day it looks nice, though.",4,2016,10,20
231,Nice Hotel in Good Location,"1 night stay here - arriving late leaving early.
Everything ran smoothly, good room. Overall feel to the hotel was good.
Note when I arrived lots of building work on the tram system going on outside which made it busy, did not hear any noise in the room.
If you are sight seeing the hotel is very well placed",4,2016,10,20
231,Great stay in good location.,"We stayed for four nights. From the moment we arrived to the end of our stay the staff were friendly, efficient and attentive.  The room was comfortable and clean.  The bathroom too was clean with good toiletries. The room was cleaned daily to a very high standard. 

Breakfast was plentiful, fresh and varied. If what you wanted was not on display then all you had to do was ask and it was produced and delivered with a friendly smile.  The bar is clean and has a good ambience. A reasonable choice of drinks, but again friendly and efficient service.  We didn't eat in the evening in the restaurant so can't comment on that, but there are numerous good eateries in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. We would recommend the 'Church' where we had a great meal.

The hotel is in a great location. Yes there are tram works next to the front door and there are some noises at the back as people go about their work. What do you expect from a City centre hotel?  We have thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we will be back.  We look forward to the next time.",5,2016,10,20
231,Modern and clean ,"Stayed here for 2 nights for a hen night, I don't  like lifts so was pleased that I was changed to the 2nd floor which also was were the restaraunt and bar are located. 

I like that to get onto different floors there is security measures to enter the floor. 

Room was average we had 2 double beds in the room which did make it a tight squeeze. 

Breakfast was plentiful but busy ! ",4,2016,10,20
231,Third visit here,Have stayed here twice before . Great location just off O'Connell St /Short walk from Temple Bar  Henry /St &Ilac Centre . Throughout Dublin there is extensive tramline work going on and this includes Parnell St outside the hotel however this did not distract from our stay and we did not experience any noise .Very comfortable room with everything you would need for a short stay in the city . Good variety of hot /cold dishes on the buffet breakfast  and unlike previous visit dining room was not overcrowded with queues for tables . Didn't eat in the hotel in the evening so cannot comment on restaurant at that time . Bar service in the evening was good . Plenty of restaurants /bars nearby and a branch of a well known supermarket directly across the road .Aircoach stars closeby on O'Connell  St .  Would definitely stay here again  .,4,2016,10,19
231,Plain and bland hotel,There are no frills at this hotel.  We spent three nights and the first night was a nightmare. The city is working on a new tram system and they work at night--right outside our room!!  We got them to move us the next two nights but they made no offer of any type of refund except to offer a free night in the future.  I live in the US-a free night here is not much good as I do not plan on ever staying at this place again,1,2016,10,18
231,Underwhelming,"My normal reviews run with the business traveller's check boxes - Wifi, iron in room, breakfast. Here wifi is poor and patchy, the iron is in the room and the breakfast is - for 11 euros - about the right price.

The rooms have old fashioned aluminium window frames which introduce noise and - at this time of year - the cool night air. Bathrooms are a good size and equipped well. The bar is a nice place to sit. Then there is the restaurant which has very bad service and an ok menu. I won't stay here again and will explore different options next time in Dublin.",3,2016,10,18
231,Jurys Inn,Traveled to Dublin with friends. This was a great hotel. I had no problems. Friendly staff and great service. I was very happy with the location as well. I would definitely stay at Jury's Inn again if I ever have the chance.,5,2016,10,18
231,Perfect ,"Perfect stay at this friendly hotel 
Very clean, bedroom was a perfect size hairdryer was powerful which was great for a change Breakfast was amazing nothing you couldn't have to eat, location was perfect too highly recommend staying at this hotel ",5,2016,10,18
231,Business trip (2 nights),"Average hotel with poor breakfast and inconvenient restaurant / breakfast opening / closing times.
No breakfast before 7.00 AM and packed breakfast poor. Cooked breakfast food quality poor. Vegetarian take away breakfast included meat sandwiches.",3,2016,10,18
231,"Clean, quiet, good location.","Pros: Very helpful staff, clean rooms, good location. Had to have keycard to get past second floor so it was quiet. 

Cons: No on site parking. Can park behind hotel for 18 euros per night or down further for 10 euro. No wash cloths. 

Neighborhood was a typical city neighborhood. I didn't feel unsafe at any given time. We roamed the streets at all hours.",5,2016,10,17
231,DUBLIN CITY HOTEL,"Easy to get to on an airport shuttle bus, and just a short walk from the bus stop. Lovely city hotel, with good security. The security card swipe system ensured restricted access to the Hotel areas to residents only. Free drink on arrival, beer,wine or spirits. Good wholesome breakfast. Pleasant efficient staff.",5,2016,10,17
231,Perfect Stay,"We had a very good spacious standard room with an Iron,Ironing board and hairdryer. On the third floor overlooking shops and flats and the road leading to the airport. All the staff were friendly, there is a small fitness room which we didn't use. Bar was fine, again friendly staff serving. Never had breakfast but price of it (11 euros) is pretty much comparable with O'Connell street which is 5 minutes walk away where you can  have a set (low standard) breakfast. So hotel is in a great location and great value for money. The Manager should be rightly proud of this hotel. Top job!",5,2016,10,17
231,Great spot for downtown Dublin.,Great place to stay if you want to visit the downtown area and close to everything. I would recommend the buffet breakfast but not the bag lunches. The staff were very friendly to all of us and our friends said the same thing about our whole experience. 👍👍👍👍👍👍,4,2016,10,17
231,Home from Home,"I really enjoyed my stay in Jurys Inn as normal I was treated as a very valuable guest, compliments to Jimmy and his team. I would highly recommend this hotel to any business traveller.  The room was lovely and comfortable, the food of very high quality and the customer service second to none.  ",5,2016,10,17
231,"Great location, Fantastic room and great nights sleep.","Stayed here for one night. Staff very helpful and were happy to offer any help they could.

Hotel is very modern, open spaced and clean.

Our room was very clean, spacious and very nicely decorated. Furniture and amenities in the room insured a very comfortable stay. We have stayed in quite a few hotels in Dublin recently but this was by far the most quiet outside both in mornings and evenings.
Comfortable bed and lots of lighting.

Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice weekend away in the city centre.",5,2016,10,17
231,"Beautiful Decor, Modern & Classy","Cool, modern hotel within walking distance of main attractions, delicious breakfast buffet. The rooms are a good size and very comfortable. We were able to walk to shopping areas and museums. Room service was lackluster, but otherwise we would recommend staying here.",4,2016,10,17
231,Excellent hotel,"Very helpful staff especially the chap on the door at the main entrance, breakfast was really good too and the location.  Cannot fault it in any way, i would recommend to anybody wanting a nice trip to ireland",5,2016,10,17
231,"Good hotel, great location","We stayed at the Jury's Inn Parnell Street for 3 nights at the end of 10 day vacation in Ireland.  We arrived at the hotel by using the 747 Airlink from the airport and it was very easy to find and get to the hotel from the bus drop off.  Hotel was clean and comfortable but other wise unremarkable.  The hotel is well located.  There is plenty of shopping just around the corner, many restaurants within easy walking distance and O'Connell Street is right around the corner.  We used a hop on hop off bus to tour Dublin and it was an easy 10 minute walk to the bus starting point.  The hotel has a large storage room for luggage if you arrive early or want to tour around after check-out.  We would have like to have vault in the hotel room rather than the lockers in the lobby, but this was not a deal breaker.  The free wifi was very good.  This hotel appears to be very secure and we felt safe in the surrounding area.  I was a little disappointed that the in-room coffee was instant, but made do.  You can easily walk from the hotel location to the Temple Bar area and many of Dublin's popular attractions.  We would stay here again if we travel back to Dublin.",4,2016,10,16
231,Nice hotel,"We spent two nights at this hotel while attending the American football game at the Aviva Stadium.

The hotel is located just off O'Connell Street, about 20 minutes walk from Temple Bar.

We arrived very early, long before the check-in time, but the rooms were ready, so the receptionist kindly checked us in.

The room was a nice size, as was the bathroom. The bed was comfortable.

The breakfast was included in our rate, and was excellent. Tradition cooked breakfast, Continental breakfast, cereals, fruit, juices. Anything you could want to suit any diet, and well-stocked at all times, despite how busy it was.

The hotel was quite expensive, but it was certainly not over-priced for what you get. It's not the sort of hotel I generally go for, because of the price, but because of the football game, options were limited. I enjoyed my stay.",4,2016,10,16
231,Hen do,"Great place for a weekend stay in Dublin, good location, good value and nice modern hotel. Location of hotel is central for shops, coffee bars and local bars, 15 min walk or 5 mins in a taxi to the famous Temple Bar nightlife. I would go back!!",5,2016,10,15
231,Weekend away,"Early flight out of the UK meant we arrived at the hotel at about 9.00am. Check in time wasnt until 2.00pm  but the reception staff were very helpful getting us to fill in all the paperwork so that we would only have to come back to the desk later in the day and give  our name to get our room key and also letting us leave our cases so we didn't  have to drag them around with us all day. Our room was clean and comfortable  even if the view wasn't  exactly picturesque! (We looked down on the local street cleaning yard, but fhe triple glazing kept the noise at bay). We did not use the restaurant or bar so cannot comment on these facilities. All  the staff we  encountered were very friendly and helpful and a credit to the hotel.",4,2016,10,14
231,Dublin,"A keenly anticipated weekend spoiled at the outset by mistakes at reception where our checked room was given to someone else and reception had to scramble to find another room. Whilst the reception team did eventually resolve the issue it was an unnecessary distraction when all we wanted to do, having had a very early start, was to crash out for an hour or so. Instead we had to wait while the alternative room was found. No offer of any upgrade.",2,2016,10,14
231,Great location,"Great location, round the corner from O'Connell Street. Clean rooms & public areas, very friendly staff. Breakfast was fantastic. 
Some noise from other guests during the night, but hotel cannot help that!",5,2016,10,13
231,50th Birthday Vacation,"The hotel was wonderful and in walking distance to plenty to do in Dublin.  The only downside to the location is that there is no parking on the premises.  The city is under much construction now so getting around to a parking garage was very inconvenient.  Also had to walk the streets rolling our luggage around.  I totally understand this is Dublin, though, they don't have room for parking at the hotel so I don't hold this against the hotel at all.  Our stay there was very nice and they even put a birthday card and little box of candy in our room for my husband's birthday.  I would recommend.",5,2016,10,13
231,Great location ,"Stayed here for 2 nights in January for my birthday. Staff was great, we arrived early and had a speedy check in. Room was large and modern. Tea and coffee facilities. No noise at all. Very local to walk to business stops and shops etc. Definitely would recommend for a few nights stay. ",4,2016,10,13
231,Fantastic experience,"Perfect in every way, went the extra mile to help us celebrate my husbands birthday - Great location and very friendly staff, also fab breakfast, couldn't ask for more and would gladly stay again thank you",5,2016,10,12
231,"Very nice hotel, friendly staff and quality for the value",I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is traveling to Dublin.  Nice location with easy access to everything.  the only thing to remember is to bring a power converter if you are from the US and use the 115 volt power as the only one that is in the room is in the bathroom. ,5,2016,10,12
231,Business or Pleasure,"Always love a few days in Dublin. The Jury's Inn at Parnell St was clean, staff were welcoming and the location was central. It's a pity parking is 5 mins walk away, especially with the current roadworks all over Dublin meant a 15 min detour to get into the car park. Room was very good, facilities at the hotel were on par with what you'd expect. All in all, I'd recommend it as a good place to stay.",4,2016,10,12
231,Our stay at Jurys Inn Dublin,"The hotel is in a very good location and is very clean.
The rooms are really nice and very clean.
The staff is Very friendly and very helpful.
We Very much enjoyed our stay and recommend this hotel to anyone, who plans to stay in Dublin.",5,2016,10,12
231,Good Location for O'Connell St,VERY helpful and friendly staff.  Close to common pickup spot for day tours.  Just down the street from a bar that features American football on Sundays--excellent!  Our room had plenty of space.  Would definitely stay here again.,5,2016,10,12
231,Perfect For Dublin,"If you're staying in Dublin, Jurys Inn Parnell Street is perfect if you want to be close to all of the major sights and sounds but far enough away for a perfect night's sleep. Located just a ten-minute walk away from the Temple Bar area and the nearest Luas (tram) line stop, and less than a five-minute walk from the nearest airport shuttle-bus stop. The Aviva Stadium and Croke Park are also not too far away.

Good room size, excellent food in the bar and friendly staff - top job all round!",5,2016,10,12
231,Solo traveller,"I thought this hotel was excellent, the staff were friendly and efficient, room was very clean and the bed very comfortable. The buffet breakfast offered a wide selection and the meals and service I had in the restaurant and bar were of a high standard. The super food salad is delicious! The only problem I encountered was the key card required reprogramming several times, however the reception staff attended to this immediately. ",5,2016,10,11
231,Was ok,"We would have liked to been a little closer to everything. It's right off O'Connell St but was a bit of a walk to temple Barr and other places. We wanted a/c and not many had, which we did need.  The hop on hop off bus was around the corner as well. The bathroom wasn't as clean as would like. The manager did speak to us and apologized and then bought 2 rounds of drinks as the bathroom was recleaned.",4,2016,10,11
231,jurys inn,the hotel is very dear to what was on offer as there was always await for breakfast and sometimes the food was not very hot the pillows in room where hard and the room was to hot really you are just like premier inn to alot dearer and not as good,4,2016,10,11
231,Nice and great service!,"I was in Dublin for holidays and I couldn't enjoy it better. The hotel is really central and Ross who did my check in was beyond my expectation over cordiality and attention. The room was really good, clean and quiet. I really recommend the hotel.",5,2016,10,10
231,great customer service,"Nice hotel and location, booked at short notice.  The receptionist and Fortune were very nice and welcoming.

Will surely stay again.",5,2016,10,10
231,Comfortable stay,"Stayed for 2 nights over a weekend, this was my sons stag do!
This was a good choice. You don't get a lot of frills, but it was clean and the staff were friendly. This hotel was secure although there wasn't a safe in the room.
Breakfast was a little strange, they didn't bother setting the tables, you helped yourself to cutlery and napkins. They were quick at clearing the tables. The food was both hot and plentiful. Great location. Best you specify a quiet room away from the front of the hotel, Parnell Street was noisy, not from the traffic but from revellers.
I was pleased with my choice of hotel.",4,2016,10,10
231,Great Location & Service,"Stayed here for three nights in a twin room on a girly weekend. Check in was quick and the room was very clean and spacious. When booking this hotel some of the reviews mentioned that people a little worse for wear hang around this hotel and to be a little weary.  I must say that although this is the case, the doorman at the hotel was very attentive and always near the entrance when returning home from a night out.  We had a late flight home so was able to store our luggage in another room which was very useful.  Staff were always friendly and eager to help.  Would recomend this hotel.",5,2016,10,10
231,"Amazing staff, great location","Hotel is has a great location, a block from Connell Street and very central to all tourist spots.  Bed was comfortable and room had more than enough space for my friend and I.  Bathroom was clean and also spacious.  Staff was very friendly, especially Ross who checked as Inez. Directed as to a nice place to eat and listen to live music and was very knowledgeable of the surrounding areas.  Overall it was a great stay, will use more Jury Inns in the future.  ",5,2016,10,10
231,Jurys Inn Ireland Review,Rooms here were clean and adequate but a little dated.  Staff was very friendly and service was very good and location was very convenient to many amenities.  Breakfast was good with lots of selections to suit anyone's taste and overall dinner experience was good as well. We would likely stay here if visiting Dublin again.  ,4,2016,10,10
231,Nice and clean with good location,"I was in Dublin for business and booked Jurys Inn, which turned out to be a very nice hotel with clean rooms and very friendly staff. The location is quite central allowing easy access to the old town even by foot.",5,2016,10,10
231,Clean & Secure,"We had a good experience. Centrally located. Reasonably clean and comfortable, Staff was pleasant and helpful. We felt secure with their security systems in place. The staff was able to recommend several good restaurants within a short walk.",4,2016,10,09
231,Convenient location and friendly staff.,Convenient location for sightseeing and shopping. Close to local transportation. Staff was friendly and helpful. My room was large and the bed was comfortable. I liked the option of a bath or shower. The bar and restaurant and bar on the second floor was pleasant.,5,2016,10,08

The location is perfect for the sights of Connell Street and all of the bars and restaurants.

I would have no issues staying here again.",4,2016,10,08
231,Very central location,"We stayed here with our friends and enjoyed 3 nights here. The food was fine the   breakfast was well organised and plentiful and  we had a lovely meal in the restaurant.  The location was very central and we were able to visit the GPO exhibition . I would highly recommend this exhibition as the highlight of our stay. We enjoyed the hop on hop off buses and a poignant visit to Kilmainhaim Goal. 
Would definitely return to this hotel",4,2016,10,08
231,Great hotel location at a reasonable downtown price,"Great location. Can walk to so many shops, restaurants and bars including Temple Bar area and also Trinity College. Great value for a downtown hotel. Rooms were clean, staff friendly and helpful. Included a nice buffet breakfast. ",4,2016,10,08
231,good stay,Very satisfactory.  Beds and linen were very impressive and comfortable  Unimpressed with front lobby.  Breakfast was  at best OK and the taste of the scrambled eggs was rather bland.  The location was especially good.  ,4,2016,10,08
231,Central and functional,"Typically characterless but functional chain hotel in good city centre, but slightly scruffy/rough, location. All facilities, including reasonable dining value. Good basic facilities but no frills or chracter.. Ccoukd have been anywhere in the world.",4,2016,10,07
231,Golden Wedding Anniversary,We had a fab time at this hotel ..all the staff were amazing...the rooms were beautiful ...free wifi all around the hotel...temple bar area was about a 20 minute walk away.. would recommend this hotel ...thanks for a fab time..,5,2016,10,06
231,"Great location, friendly staff, but no room service?","Hotel was lovely, could not fault the room or facilities for our one night stay. There was a fan in the corridor or in next door's room all night though that was quite annoying and disrupted sleep a little bit. We probably should have asked a member of staff what it was and if it could be turned off. The staff were so nice that I'm sure they would not have minded! There was also no room service available at 7.30pm on a Sunday. When we phoned down we were told we would have to order at reception or the bar. Having not requested room service before we a bit confused by this and decided not to bother.",5,2016,10,06
231,Disappointed,Our room and view were lovely. The room was clean and average. We were disappointed due to the very poor wifi service. We had to go from our room on the third floor to the lobby in order to maintain connection. We told various staff members about this but they were unable to assist. The telephone in the room did not work consistently. We did not find the beds to be very comfortable.,2,2016,10,06
231,Brill ,"Great hotel, clean, secure, polite staff. Nice room. Daily room clean. Helpful on reception. Breakfast good with various options available. Ten minute walk to temple bar. Would definitely stay again. Hairdryer, towels, body wash and shampoo supplied. ",4,2016,10,05
231,Great Location and very helpful,"Landed at Dublin Airport to discover that my case was still at Heathrow but was promised it would be delivered to the Hotel that night. The Hotel said they would take care of it as I was out with clients that night and when I returned to my Room - the case was placed in my Room on the luggage stand all ready for me. It's these little things that matter !!!
Great location, nice fresh rooms and reasonable breakfast. Definitely stay again",4,2016,10,05
231,I recommend you to stay here.,"Location is a little bit far from main stations, but still within walking distance. Room is very comfortable and clean. Its shower room has a really good water condition. You never feel less water supply.",5,2016,10,05
231,Fanastic hotel great location,"Fantastic 3 night stay at Jurys inn Parnell street which is ideally situated a stones throw from O'Connell Street and has all the amities you will need, room was clean and easily accessible and the staff where extremely curious and friendly 

Highly Recommend this hotel while in Dublin",5,2016,10,05
231,"Great hotel, well situated","Just about perfect.  It's a Jury's Inn, safe bet.

Situated just of O Connell street so you aren't on the main road or loader bar districts of Dublin.  The walk from temple bar is about 10 minutes there (30 minutes back with 12 pints of Guiness in you!).  

You can get everything you need on O Connell street - bus tour tickets, Irish gifts, bureau de changes, etc.  Opposite the Jury's Inn is a mini tesco, ideally for buying your shampoo, toothpaste, etc, don't use up your suitcase weights messing around with taking this sort of stuff from home!!!

Decent bar within, there's a gym also, Restuarant slightly over priced but breakfast vast and good quality.  English/Irish, American and Continetal options.  

Secure room in reception to lock up suitcases.

Hotel reception helpful and will book taxis for you/give advise where to go.",4,2016,10,04
231,Great hotel and  very central for shopping and buses with lots of restaurants nearby.  Easy walk to the river Liffey.,"the hotel has a very high standard.  The breakfast was a full buffet with a good variety of food.
My only disappointment was dinner in the evening p. The service was slow and we felt almost forgotten. Our rooms were very spacious and clean.  The beds were really comfortable. 
There were a few problems with the lifts  as the key cards didn't always work. 
",4,2016,10,04
231,"bad sound insulation, and bad breakfast","- : room-to-room sound insulation was quite poor. hard to sleep if you have a neighbor.
breakfast was bad quality in general : lids for the hot food (sausages, black pudding, potatoes, etc...) were not high enough, laying on the food (touching it), black pudding was totally dried out, ham and orange juice were really not good. 
also the TV in my room was rather small.

+ : comfortable bed, clean room, pleasant staff",2,2016,10,04
231,Solid hotel for a weekender,"Good city centre location, in easy walking distance of central Dublin. 
Solid breakfast which is mostly self service, plates noticeably small to reduce people getting amounts on the plates.
 Hotel very clean, and friendly and helpful front of house. Bar facilities good. Would consider staying again if the maid service was a little more prompt. Out most of the Saturday day, got back after 3pm, room still not cleaned. Eventually maid arrived but as we were now in the room, just asked for the bathroom to be cleaned.",4,2016,10,04
231,Good,"Easy to get to from airport on normal bus. Well situated with regard to hop-on-hop off bus for sights (sights are spread out, so no perfect location for them all). Walkable distance to a whole lot of sights. Close to ATM's, grocery stores for self caterers, and restaurants for others. Secure room. Floor access by room key only. 
Staff were friendly and efficient. (More helpful than the official tourist info center nearby). 
Room was quiet (from street noise, sadly not from the 2am arrivals from revelry or 5am early starters- which the hotel have no control over). Room comfortable and clean. 
Breakfast was great. TripAdvisor commenters on queueing probably didn't see the posters in the elevators advising of busy and quiet periods. No queue in the quiet periods. ",4,2016,10,04
231,Very good place to stay.,This Hotel is very central to all the key sites as well as very handy to all the main transport and popular eating places. We really enjoyed our stay. We would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a central location in Dublin.,4,2016,10,04
231,Loved this place,"We stayed as a group of 6 girls the place was so clean and friendly clean towels everyday .. Sorry for the fake tan on some towels 
Well we are from Essex !! 
Central to all amenities and a walk to every thing at hand 
We had bed and breakfast the full English was very nice 
Highly recommend this place 
",5,2016,10,03
231,Holiday with friends,"An excellent location for 3 friends enjoying a 3 night break, to explore Dublin on foot as well as convenient for City Tour Bus. Hotel quiet and peaceful and having 3 beds in the room made for excellent sleep quality. Would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",5,2016,10,03
231,Great hotel,"Had a good stay, nice and close to penneys for the girls, brilliant buffet breakfast and comfy beds and staff are really nice, really central location in the heart of the city, we had a great family stay, have stayed in other at twice the price and were not as nice as our stay in Jurys",5,2016,10,03
231,Vacation ,"The hotel was clean and quiet.  The front desk staff were always courteous and friendly.  Breakfast was substantial with a lot of choices available, including fresh fruit .  We would definitely stay again.",5,2016,09,30
231,The Look of the Irish...,"Another terrible review title!!!!

I've stayed in a few Jury's Inn places and this is probably medium to high on the quality scale. It's a little dated, decor and furniture wise, but clean and comfy nevertheless. Access should be good but there's currently a massive amount of work going on building the tram system, so the pavements are messy and there's barriers everywhere; crossing the road needs a project plan almost.

There's loads of fun to be had lolly and you're literally a stones throw from O'Connell St and the route into Dublin's heart. Temple Bar is a 15-20 minute stroll away across the Liffey.

The hotel has good resources, restaurant is good and will make meals outside the menu if you ask nice, the staff could give angels lessons in being nice and, because of a noise issue, I was moved to a different room without any fuss whatsoever. Rooms are spacious with the usual fittings. Good amount of storage, hairdryer, tea and coffee. Good sized bathroom and toilet that was always clean, like the rest of the place. A good A/C system kept the room at the right temperature without being obtrusive, and it has a humidifier setting so you don't wake up with a mouth like the bottom of a budgie's cage.

The bed was comfy with lovely, soft pillows and sleep quality was good. Better than a Premier Inn, which takes some doing. The duvet didn't pin me to the bed either, which, for me, is a big plus point (I hate massive duvets).

So why not five stars?

Room 465 was very noisy as it faced the outside of the building. It had secondary double glazing that was ineffective. I was swapped into an inner facing room that had no such problem.

The towels were a bit thin for a hotel of this standard but ok. It was the bath!

Baths are a rarity in any hotel these days, so I always take maximum advantage when I find on. The baths in this place though, shallow. Too shallow for a soak unless you're very thin. Very, very thin. with a deeper bath I'd have been happy to give a five star to this pace.

All other things considered, it's a good place to stay.",4,2016,09,30
231,Excellent hotel,"Loved this hotel, room very spacious and clean. Hotel situated around the corner from O'Connell Street, about 1 minute walk. Breakfast, lots to choose from and very tasty. Would definitely use this place again.",5,2016,09,29
231,Special Birthday,"Great location , comfortable clean rooms , excellent breakfast one of our party was gluten free and nothing was too much trouble even toast at breakfast , friendly helpful staff . Excellent value for money . Everything within walking distance. ",5,2016,09,29
231,Two GREAT weels at Jurys in Dublin,We were very happy to stay in the heart of Dublin at an excellent inn.  Our needs were met every day.  The place is clean and quiet!!  The staff were more than willing to provide whatever service we wished.  We will recommend this hotel to all.,5,2016,09,28
231,Excellent hotel,"Very modern, extremely clean with a great location in the centre of Dublin! 10 mins walk from temple bar and a few mins walk to the shops.

Top tip: Go to supermax for food, only 4mins walk from hotel! :) 

",5,2016,09,28
231,A pleasant experience,"Overall our stay at Jury's Inn was very comfortable. It was very clean, inviting and the staff were attentive and friendly. The restaurant served lovely meals and breakfast, where there was lots of choice (even for an extremely fussy eater). The hotel was situated in a busy part of the city with easy access to lots of the local attractions. The only thing that wasn't within easy access was the car park that they used for guests - it was only about 10 minutes walk away, but when you are dragging 20 kilo suitcases on uneven streets it seems like a lot further! However there was a public car park right next to the hotel, which the hotel doesn't associate with but you could use (so when we discovered this, we used that one instead). Our room was clean and quiet, even though the hotel is on quite a busy road, you could never hear any outside noise. Jury's Inn was a lovely place with a friendly atmosphere that made our stay a brilliant one. ",5,2016,09,28
231,Basic Hotel,"This is a basic hotel it was clean and the staff was friendly and courteous. The key card usage in hotel elevator and restrooms on 2nd floor is annoying and not that reliable. The bathrooms also clean and roomy but only basics such as body soap,shampoo and conditioner not even a wash cloth.",3,2016,09,28
231,Dublin stay,We enjoyed our stay with you and would probably stay there again.  The hotel was very nice the rooms were very clean.  The location was good for what we wanted to do.  The staff were very friendly and accommodating to our needs.,5,2016,09,28
231,Great visit to Dublin ,We booked through bookings.com for this hotel and got it for a very reasonable price for 2 nights / 3 days . The hotel was ideally located for O'Connell street which is where we got off the bus from the airport . They allowed us to leave our bags there as well which was great as we arrived at 9am on Sunday morning . We had mentioned prior to the stay that we were celebrating our engagement so they offered us a free glass of prosecco each in the bar which was a lovely added touch . The beds are super comfortable with various pillows you can chose from. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food. Had a fantastic time and will definitely consider this hotel again in the future . ,5,2016,09,28
231,Good hotel in city center,"This is a good, clean, comfortable hotel in the city center.  The staff was most helpful in obtaining tickets for the Kilmainham jail.  Breakfast was great and there was a huge selection of hot and cold foods.  We appreciated the air conditioning, although it wasn't very hot when we were there.",5,2016,09,27
231,Great location,"Within walking distance of everything  the hotel was clean, the staff as very nice. The hotel as locate right off of O'Connell St, hitch made it easy to walk everywhere. I have stayed at a Jury's Inn before and was happy with my experience.  ",4,2016,09,27
231,Convienent to O'Connell St and shopping,"The Jurys Inn Parnell St is adjacent to Parnell Square, one block from O'Connell St, Dublin's 'main street' and very close to the pedestrian shopping area of Henry St.  A short walk further to the Ha'penny Bridge and the Temple Bar area.  
Rooms are adequate, typical Jury's Inn with coffee and tea maker, and excellent restaurant and bar on the second floor, and plenty of restaurants and bars in the immediate (walkable) area.  One thing to remember, Dublin is in the process of bringing back its trolley system and as of this date (Sept 16) the streets around the hotel are pretty well a mess.  Allow extra time if booking a taxi as getting to the hotel is not that easy for them.
Well worth the money.",4,2016,09,27
231,Would highly recommend.,"The room was well appointed, with three of us in the room there was still plenty of space. Breakfast and dinners were most enjoyable with plenty of choices and reasonable prices. We made use of the bar on a number of occasions, there was a lovely environment and we met many other residents of different nationalities. Wouldn't hesitate to book again.",5,2016,09,27
231,Very good,"Great hotel for its location, friendly staff, very clean, we will use it again when next in Dublin.
Only wish we could take our dog with us.otherwise we have to look for dog friendly accommodation 
Which is usually out of towns",4,2016,09,26
231,Great location,"We came to Dublin for 2 nights to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary and chose the Jury's inn as it was a central location.  We arrived very early after a 6am flight.  Obviously we knew the room would not be ready but the hotel kindly took our cases and stored them until it was ready at noon.  After having  a wander round the streets of Dublin, the famous o,Connol street is just round the corner, we ventured back to freshen up.  We were on the 5th floor, there are lifts.  The room was at the back of the hotel, which we were grateful for as they are putting a new tram line in and it can be very busy with traffic and noisy at the front.  The room had a double bed, setee, flat screen TV, iron and ironing board, hairdryer.  It was air conditioned/heater system which is a must for me.  Tea,coffee facilities available.  Walls are thin as we did hear people coming in the room near to us in the middle of the night talking in her phone. But Overall a good room. The shower room was reasonable, towels were nice and changed daily if needed.  The room was cleaned daily too.  The cleaner was very friendly - always nice to say hello and show your appreciation.  The hotel is in a central area.  There is a taxi rank on O'Connol street but taxis do stay outside the hotel too.  Taxis are manned by both Irish people and other nationalities.  Pleasant that everyone is, I have to say I certainly preferred to be in a Irish taxi as they were very knowledgeable of the area. In fact the Irish people are just so lovely and friendly and you are made to feel very welcome.  Kinda helps that I adore the Irish accent too.  I would definitely stay here again if I came to Dublin.  We did not use the restaurant/bar so cannot comment on this.  Finally you have to swipe your key in the lift before you can use it, i liked this idea but it's no good if you forget your key!!  Good location, good hotel.",4,2016,09,26
231,A good mid price option,Friendly staff and a nice bar and dining area. A pretty good buffet style breakfast. Reasonably central. Clean rooms and reasonably comfortable. Could be improved with a pillow menu and complimentary water in the rooms.,4,2016,09,26
231,Great Location,Stayed three nights at this hotel during September and wasn't disappointed. The hotel is only 2 minutes walk from O' Connell Street which is at the centre of the Dublin bus network. Not the cheapest hotel in Dublin but friendly staff and excellent accommodation were well worth the price. Plenty of retail outlets close to hotel and numerous bars and restaurants within 5 minutes walking distance. Rooms to the front have a street view. Breakfast costs 10 euros but was still excellent value.,4,2016,09,25
231,Short trip to Dublin,"I found my stay at the Jury Inn, Parnell Street, ideal for my needs at that time. The staff team were excellent, friendly and nothing was too much. My room, perfect, No 402 and very quite. Location so central, it was very easy for me to find my way around and get to where I needed to be. I intend to stay again next September.",5,2016,09,25
231,Restaurant and Bar,"I have been to Jurys Parnell Street several times and have always been impressed by their knowledge of food and drink service.  In addition, they are friendly and attentive to the needs of all guests. In particular, i would like to acknowledge Louise, Ianos, Robert, Ben, Maximus and Serena. I plan on returning to Dublin in December and staying at Jurys Parnell.",5,2016,09,23
231,Perfect for exploring Dublin ,"What a fantastic hotel, staff and location. We stayed 3 nights and honestly would of happily done another 3. Take comfy shoes as very easy to access all tourist attractions from this hotel on foot. Temple bar near as is many lovely restaurants. Highly recommend jury's in Parnell ",5,2016,09,23
231,Dublin and Jury's Inn were perfect,"My mother and me had a perfect stay in Dublin and in Jury's Inn Parnell Streets. It's in the center of the city. We really enjoyed the stay in our hotel, the bedroom was very good and clean. The staff was always very kind. At breakfast we're asked about our well-being every day. In general they were very nice. I would come back every time.",5,2016,09,23
231,Good location for O'Connell Street etc.,"Located a block away from O'Connell Street this modern hotel offers a perfect location for exploring the centre of Dublin.  The rooms are clean, comfortable and pretty standard.  Our room looked out into a courtyard.  The public areas of the hotel are nicely decorated and comfortable.  The breakfast buffet is extensive and the restaurant modern and comfortable.  The bar offers food that includes many of the items on the restaurant menu.  The charcuterie platter for €11 is very good.
We got a great deal for three nights bed and breakfast Monday to Thursday for €350.
Only issues were that the beds were on castors that did not seem to have a lock so the bed rolls around a bit and makes it hard to sit up to watch TV.  Also, the towels could do with a bit of an upgrade as they are a tad thin and rough.",4,2016,09,23
231,Great location with friendly staff,"Stayed for a couple of nights.  The location to the centre is extremely good, the staff in the hotel were very friendly.  Comfortable rooms and a very enjoyable breakfast.  The bar offers a good selection of drinks with reasonably priced snacks for central Dublin.  ",3,2016,09,23
231,Expensive and a bit grim,"€200 for a room that was sparsely furnished and not well enough lit was a rip off. Breakfast was included and was good. 

No mini bar or water in the room, with bottles on sale at reception at €1 each.

The hotel was 100% full and I got the last room. Make sure you let them know if you're likely to arrive late so they don't give your room to someone else.",3,2016,09,23
231,Ask for Sandro!,"Sandro and Jury's rock!  Close to great restaurants and stores, friendly staff, clean accommodations.
Staff was extremely helpful with questions that we had, and they showed a genuine desire to "" go the  extra mile"" to make sure that customer satisfaction was achieved. ",5,2016,09,22
231,Dublin City Center,"This is a very nice hotel. It has dining, internet, clean rooms and friendly staff. When I got there I was early so they stowed my luggage and I explored the city for a bit. It's close to everything so it makes everything convenient. I would recommend this hotel to solo travelers and families.",4,2016,09,22
231,"Great Hotel, Brilliant location","Stopped in this hotel for a weekend visit, the location was perfect for all bus tours and sites. 
Staff were friendly and helpful 
Room was clean. 
Would defiantly recommend this hotel for a trip to visit dublin",5,2016,09,22
231,Friendly & efficient,"Nice hotel, nice location.  The staff are very friendly.  Check-ins is fast and no fuss.
Location OK as the shopping malls are just nearby.  Hope the construction in front of the hotel be completed soon as it is quite problematic for taxis to drop-off and pick-up.  ",3,2016,09,22
231,"Location is good, but not if you're traveling by car!","The Jury's Inn Hotel enforced the No Change rule and charged for a missed night due to airline issues.  In spite of our immediate notification (inside of their 24 hr rule) and staying in Jurys Inn hotels for the next three nights.  So beware.
Also, there is inadequate street access via car/rental so avoid unless traveling by bus/taxi.  ",2,2016,09,21
231,Very nice hotel and staff,"Pillows were not very comfortable, soap for washing hands in the bathroom didn't work, we had to put a note for the cleaning staff to fix it, shower is fixed on the wall and they don't have shower caps (difficult to take a bath without wetting your hair, luckily I had brought my shower cap).
Still, is a very nice hotel for sleeping, clean, nice staff, close to city centre, very good breakfast. Has an iron and ironing board in the room! The hairdryer, although hidden in a drawer, was very good! Would stay in Jury's Inn again.
",4,2016,09,21
231,"Nice little place, central","Nice rooms, really friendly staff.
We flew in on the reedy from East Miss so we were there at the crack of dawn but if you email them well before you should be ok for an early check in.
We also got a complimentary breakfast which was much appreciated!
Really helpful when asking about bus links and attractions etc.",4,2016,09,21
231,Fabulous ,"Excellent location as a first visit to Dublin! The staff were fantastic in every area visited. Check in/out was smooth and we were greeted warmly and with good knowledge of where to go! Breakfast was delicious and the bar staff were great. 

Room was decorated with balloons as we had called ahead and advised we were celebrating a birthday. Really super stay! Thanks Jurys Inn! ",5,2016,09,21
231,Central Hotel,"Very central hotel, we ate in both in the bar and for breakfast and both were perfect.  Nothing fancy but everything you'd need, comfortable bed, clean room and bathroom, good food and friendly staff.  Check in was quick and check out just as quick, location is perfect for a city centre break easily withing walking distance of everything.",5,2016,09,21
231,Great sty in Dublin,"This is a very good hotel with friendly staff, great breakfast at a reasonable price and very comfortable rooms.  The location right at the top of O'Connell Street is great for shopping and restaurants.  Taxi service to train stations and other Dublin locations is resonable.",5,2016,09,21
231,Girls break,Stayed here with 2 friends...can't fault the hotel or the staff and thought the key lift was a brilliant added security would definitely recommend and would stay again.  Helped to make our break very enjoyable. ,5,2016,09,21
231,Great Hotel Jury's Inn,"We would totally go back to Jury's Inn, great restaurant, clean large rooms, friendly staff and in the centre of everything.  Request a room near the back of hotel as there is a lively pub across from the front doors.",5,2016,09,21
231,Jury's Inn,Over priced for the standard of the rooms..  Rooms are uninspiring in their decor and a there is a lot of noise transfer between rooms.  No water in the rooms.  Water pressure in the shower is low.  The bathroom soaps and creams were not particularly nice.,3,2016,09,21
231,Overnight stay at Jurys Parnell Street,"Arrived early and allowed to do the check in process and store my luggage. Very friendly reception staff. A coach party were checking out as we arrived and it was a bit chaotic but it did not seem to bother the reception staff they were pleasant and friendly. Arrived back mid afternoon and was in our room straight away. Rooms pleasant and clean. did not use the bar or restaurant except for Breakfast the next day which was very busy but again this did not affect the service. I even saw one member of staff helping an elderly infirm lady select her breakfast and carried it back to her table then went to get her a cup of coffee.  overall I would recommend the hotel, it is very near to the bus stops for the airport link bus and only a few minutes walk down to the river.",5,2016,09,21
231,"Overall, a good experience","The hotel bedroom was clean. The bed comfortable. There was only one chair, however, for potentially three people who could have slept in the room. The bathroom seemed outdated in comparison to the bedroom. Wifi was complimentary which was a bonus. The location was excellent in being just off Upper O'Connell Street. Staff were friendly and helpful with enquiries. ",4,2016,09,21
231,Stay in Dublin,"Had an excellent time.  Good service in the hotel.  Great location for walking around Dublin.  Needed an extra glass, room service responded immediately and cheerfully. Would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2016,09,20
231,Great location,"This hotel has just about everything you would need for a city break.Smack in the middle of the city.
Great staff who will make you feel very welcome and nothing is a problem for them. They are customer focussed.
I have no problem recommending this hotel",4,2016,09,20
231,Irish Hospitality,"Loved our stay at the Jury's Inn Parnell St Dublin, close to all the shops and Irish Pubs, excellent staff, accommodation excellent. Highly recommended. This was our second time we have stayed at Jury Inn Parnell Street, once with out Trafalgar Tour and this time by ourselves. Would return again if ever in Dublin again.

",5,2016,09,19
231,Jury's Inn Parnell Street,"This is in a fabulous location right by a hop on hop off bus stop, a quick walk to temple bar and very near the lovely flannagans restaurant. The hotel had wonderful staff who can't do enough for you. They store your luggage both before and after you check in which we found very handy and not everywhere offers. I would highly recommend this hotel very good value for money. Also only 30min from airport ",5,2016,09,19
231,2 nights in Dublin,"Stayed at this hotel as part of our tour of Ireland. It was a good location - only a short walk to the River Liffey and Temple Bar, restaurants and pubs, and shopping. The room was larger than we expected, but not huge. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom a little cramped, not much space to put our toiletries. The people working the desk were friendly and helpful.",5,2016,09,17
231,Ok for a few nights,"This hotel is fine for three nights. It mainly caters for large coach groups which means the buffet breakfast could be a little hectic at times. We had a quiet room on the fourth floor overlooking the Main Street. Unfortunately the tramlines were being upgraded whilst we were there but we got used to it. The Jurys Inn at Christchurch is in prettier area and nearer Temple Bar but we like the fact that this was out the way. The rooms are small and so are the bathrooms but they were clean. it's not fancy but depending on your budget, it certainly is good value for money.",3,2016,09,17
231,Great location clean needs some tweaking to improve,"Great spot allowing easy walking to all local sights.  Reception staff were so friendly and helpful.  Good security with the room key activating the lift stops riff raff coming in off the busy Parnell Road.  Bar area and breakfast dining area was modern clean and inviting.  Breakfast was plentiful hot and tasty.  Ours was included in our package.  My only niit pick would be there was no bathroom extras like shower cap flannel hand soap and creams in the bathroom.  Just basic shower gel shampoo attached to the shower wall.  I found that to be poor.  Overall would recommend for its location, though massive road works in the whole surrounding area making it a nightmare with traffic outside at the moment.  But looks like it's all improvements which is good.",4,2016,09,17
231,Great hotel,"This is my 3rd visit. Well run, friendly and clean hotel just minutes from Temple Bar. Breakfast is lovely and well worth the money.  My visits have all been for business but also suits for leisure in the heart of the city ",5,2016,09,16
231,Average hotel,The hotel is situated on Parnell Street at the opposite end of O'Connell Street to the River Liffey and the Temple Bar area.  The rooms are not a generous size; ours looked into a central courtyard area and although quiet it was overlooked by the rooms opposite and without net curtains we needed to keep the curtains closed to give us some privacy. At least it was clean and the beds was comfy. Breakfast wasn't included but we found plenty of places nearby that were cheaper than eating at the hotel. ,3,2016,09,15
231,Very Clean and Comfortable and good value,"I had booked 2 rooms for a family trip to Dublin for the weekend. Both rooms were very clean and comfortable, very light and airy with good views of the City.
The staff were all very friendly and helpful and always willing to give advice and answer any questions. I will definitely be going back to This Hotel again.",4,2016,09,15
231,nice stay for sight seeing,"central location near temple bar and a lot of restaurants, room a little bit too small, but calm, breakfast very ok, staff friendly, checking procedures easy, cleaning up of the room reliable, no tips awarded ",4,2016,09,14
231,Two Excellent Business Stays,"The hotel is central and easy to find. Although it was very busy on some nights the staff were always friendly, attentive and helpful. The rooms are clean and quiet. The breakfast is good and again although sometimes very busy. There were always plenty of staff ensuring nothing ran out and tables were cleared quickly. Would definitely recommend and will stay again.",5,2016,09,14
231,Excellent Hotel,"Hotel Location is great about a ten minute walk to temple bar.  Breakfast was great, all round a nice hotel.  Check out some of the bars next to the river very friendly service from everyone we encountered.  ",5,2016,09,13
231,Good location for city visit,Enjoyed our stay here during a short city break. Staff very helpful from reception to restaurant. Excellent breakfast. Good wifi. Reasonable distance to walk to Christchurch where we had an interesting visit. Other places strongly recommended are Dublin Castle and the Chester Beattie book exhibition. All within reasonable walking distance.,5,2016,09,13
231,Very nice stay,"We stayed in this hotel just fir one night as we were going to see the show at Board Gais Theatre. Great location, close to shops and restaurants, O Connell street 2 mins walk. Rooms are very clean, good choice fir breakfast and you can leave your luggage at the desk.",5,2016,09,13
231,Fabulous hotel!,"We really enjoyed our stay at this spotlessly clean hotel with good facilities.  There was plenty of choice at the buffet breakfast and was very well presented.  The staff were helpful and courteous.  The hotel is on the ""north"" side of the river so we had a bit of a trek over to the livelier side of town.  Saying that, it would not stop us from staying here again as we both enjoy walking but for some it may be a little too far away from the main shopping and entertainment areas and visitor attractions.",5,2016,09,11
231,Wonderful,"I went to Dublin recently and stayed at Jurys Inn. I spent my birthday and I was suprised with ballons in my room by the staff. I asked for a restaurant sugestion to go on my birthday, and the staff from the reception was amazing, since they suggested ""The Church"". Thank You so much for your kindness and williness in providing tips in how to visit the city. I will definitely recomend this hotel to my friends and most certain this a reference hotel to stay when being in Dublin. Very well located.",5,2016,09,09
231,"Great stay, great location","Hotel has a great location and the staff were very welcoming...we arrived a few hours early and were going to ask if the hotel could keep our bags for us until check-in but our rooms were ready so we got to check in early which was fab, the beds were very comfortable and there was plenty of space in the room for us (3 ladies over for the weekend).  The lifts were a bit tricky to work as we had never came across this system before but we got there in the end and I think it is a great security feature. We booked room only so we were not tied to breakfast times but had breakfast at the hotel on the Sunday and I must admit is was worth the money we paid.  On the whole we would not fault anything.",5,2016,09,09
231,Vacation in Dublin,"Our room was well appointed and clean. The breakfast service was prompt and food was plentiful and of very good quality. Location was ideal for visits to sites of the 1916 Easter Uprising, such as the GPO and Moore Street.",5,2016,09,09
231,Amazing hotel,"Can not fault this hotel. Every query I had before my arrival they responded to my email within a few hours. Room was lovely. Staff were very helpful, polite, friendly and knowledgeable. Location of the hotel is great. Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2016,09,08
231,Lovely hotel but room service ???!,"Lovely hotel, clean, tidy and mostly very helpful ! Until it came to ordering room service, after travelling all day we were so tired we decided to order room service to be told we would have to come down and pay it there and then at front desk ,we asked could we pay in morning before we left but told this was not possible ! I know it was no big deal having to go down to desk to pay it but to be honest we couldn't be bothered moving from top of the bed we were so tired so we didn't bother getting room service ! Apart from that everything else great, location etc etc ",4,2016,09,07
231,Great location for a Dublin visit.,"Comfortable  hotel room with ensuite bathroom and airconditioned room.  Staff friendly, we visited the restaurant for breakfast which was very good (hot foord selections  & continental) and we had dinner there one night, which was satisfactory without being great.  No parking on-site, parking is subsidised at €10 per 24 hrs at a nearby parking station (5 min walk) which was ok.  Location is excellent for the hop-on city sight seeing buses, shopping mall and 10 min walking distance to Temple St (night life) & Trinity College.",4,2016,09,07
231,Enjoyed our stay,"Our 2nd trip to Dublin.1st time Jurys Inn.
Room was spotless.
Bathroom nice size and clean.
Breakfast was not to busy lots of choices,hot and fresh
Plenty for every taste.
Spent a bit of time in bar and very efficient and prices according.
Lots of construction out front but all over city .
Walk to everything easily. The Church is a must and not to far away a quick 5min walk
Enjoyable weekend no complaint",5,2016,09,05
231,"EXCELLENT location, comfortable rooms","This hotel is clean, comfortable, and affordable. It puts you right in the middle of everything you might want to see in Dublin City Center, plus a ton of great restaurants. Walking distance (10-15 min) to Trinity College, Temple Bar, and a little further to Christchurch and Jameson. The bus lines are right on O'Connell on the corner as are the hop on hop off tour buses. Plenty of good shopping as well, and several convenience stores for last minute needs. All around we were VERY pleased with our stay here, and will probably return next year.",5,2016,09,04
231,Fab visit,"Fantastic location, clean functional hotel, breakfast is a brilliant start to the day, all staff encountered were pleasant and friendly, room was ready hours before specified check in time, will definitely be back! ",5,2016,09,04
231,Great hotel,"Jurys Inn is a great, clean hotel. The staff was friendly. The room wasn't very spacious but got the job done. The hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk to almost everything that a visit to Dublin is worth doing.",5,2016,09,04
231,"Good hotel, friendly staff, great breakfast.","Not too far located from the city center and only a few meters from the airport bus. Room was very good, great bath, good beds and good isolated, had a good night sleep. The staff was very friendly. Checking in quick and professional. The breakfast is really great (very important to me!)",5,2016,09,04
231,Lovely hotel,"A lovely clean hotel, parking is a bit of a nusience for this hotel though especially if you have lots of luggage. The restaurant was lovely and plenty of space. We used the open top bus tours for getting around and the stop nearest to the hotel is about a 5 min walk which we found very convenient and much easier then going to get our car and drive around",5,2016,09,03
231,A great city centre choice,"Had 2 nights here and everything was great. Coming straight from the airport and getting off in O' Connell Street was easy and only a few minutes walk from the Gresham Hotel bus stop. Arrived too early for check in but were able to store our luggage while we went into the city. My first concern was with the noise on the street  the room would be noisy but fortunately we had a room to the side and with the windows closed the room was nice and quiet and the excellent, quiet air conditioning kept the room cool.
Comfortable beds, clean rooms, good shower, great breakfast, decent WiFi and helpful staff all made for an enjoyable stay. An in room safe would have been nice but there is one available in reception.",5,2016,09,03
231,City Break in Dublin,"Great location, away from hustle and bustle of Temple Bar, but only 10 mins walk to reach the centre. Friendly staff, rooms were clean and tidy, good breakfast variety and very good value for money. Would definitely recommend this hotel and go back for future stays!",5,2016,09,03
231,Just a fair hotel,"This hotel is clean.
The carpet of corridors are a little too soft to carry suitcases.
There was no tab in the bath but the quantity of water is OK.
The room was small for the price.
All foods at breakfast were not ready at 7AM.",4,2016,09,03
231,Imressed,Very good hotel in a great location. We could walk to almost everything we did. Staff unbelievably helpful. Breakfast was well above average. Room was clean. All rooms are queen bed with a single. Good water pressure. We'd stay again and it got my wife's seal of approval. ,5,2016,09,02
231,Great experience,"Friendly staff, great breakfast for all tastes, all spaces very clean, free wireless available, great location near O'Connel Street in the city centre, near the main shoping centers at Henry Street, near Temple Bar area.",5,2016,09,02
231,Fantastic stay in a central location,"Having just returned from a three night stay at the Jury's Parnell Street I can only give the hotel high praises. The room was bright and clean with a great air conditioning system, the bed was very comfortable so a good nights sleep was never a problem. 
Breakfast was plentiful with a wide selection of hot and cold options that were always fresh and of a high quality. 
All in all the stay was perfect and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced Dublin hotel which is within easy reach of all the important areas. ",5,2016,09,02
231,No frills but excellent value and service,"We stayed for two nights and were very impressed with the friendly service we received throughout our stay. The room was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. There are road works right outside the hotel at the moment but they didn't affect our stay. Although we were facing onto the main road we heard no noise at all. Our room was also near the lifts but again it was quiet. The hotel breakfast was very decent and the atmosphere in the dining room was very relaxed. Go early though as it gets very busy around 9am! The hotel is ideally situated and is within walking distance of all of Dublin's many amenities.  A visit to the Guinness Store is a must! The weather was superb while we were there and we enjoyed a picnic lunch sitting in the sunshine in St Stephen's Green. You are spoiled for choice when eating out in Dublin but we had a delicious meal in the Parnell Pub which is right next to the hotel. Aircoach is an easy, low cost way to transfer to and from the airport. It was booked and paid for online so there was no need to have any cash for the coach. It cost 11 euros each for a return ticket. The coaches leave every 15 minutes and the coach driver told us when to get got off. We got off at the O'Connell Street stop and had a very short distance to walk to the hotel, about 2 minutes!  Ideal when you are arriving at night. We checked out at noon and weren't going home till late but the hotel kept our luggage which was great.  A very comfortable hotel and one I would certainly use again.",5,2016,09,02
231,Great convient location,Just around the corner to everything. Staff couldn't be more helpful. Even packed us breakfast as we had to leave earlier then breakfast started for the airport Great convient location  nice clean rooms  beautiful full Irish breakfast  porridge to die for,5,2016,09,02
231,Great stay,Short stay with friends for a 40th birthday weekend. Hotel is located in a relatively good area. Near shops! Very handy. The rooms are lovely very clean and very modern. Beds comfy too. The breakfast was delightful....especially the sausages! Great stay,5,2016,09,01
231,"OK - Very basic though - no frills, no fridge, no safe, no mini-bar, no fan.....","Bit disappointed really - very BASIC room - no fridge, safe or mini-bar and a rubbish view..Toilet made a dreadful noise when flushed - told reception about this but it was not resolved!  Good location if you want to catch a bus at nearby O'Connell Street!",3,2016,09,01
231,Not value for money,I would only give the room a 3 star . We did not know they had a bar until we went for an excellent breakfast. The staff could have given us more information at check in .  However it is a nice hotel and a price you have to pay for Dublin.  Go to Killarney instead it is wonderful and cheaper.,4,2016,09,01
231,Dublin break.,"Just got back from a great weekend in Dublin staying at the Jury's Inn Parnell St,on arriving I was a bit dubious as there's a lot of roadworks going on and it all looked a bit untidy but as soon as you enter the hotel it's spotless,we got there at 8.30 am although we couldn't get in our rooms they checked us in straight away and kept our bags until later,the rooms are really clean,great shower,tea/coffee and tv the beds were very comfy although a little soft for me,the breakfast is great we didn't actually eat in the restaurant in the evening but I'm pretty sure it would be fine,there's a nice comfy well stocked bar and all the staff were great and nothing was too much trouble,the hotel has a tesco straight across the road and a Lidl around the corner,it's in a great spot just off OConnell st and about a 10 mins walk to the railway station where you can get the Dart train down the coast we went to Dun Laoghrie for About 7 euros return,there's a great pub Parnells which is as you come out the entrance turn right about 200 yards and had a great meal in there and the staff were great,if you go on the open top bus get the yellow one City Scape it's 10 euros which is half the price of the red one and you get a Euro discount at the storehouse and half a Guinness free at the vat house with your ticket.

",4,2016,09,01
231,Break in Dublin,"Great hotel, clean room, friendly staff - central for tourist activities - definitely stay there again - a great deal for us.have stayed in many Jury's and all of them have been brilliant would definitely reccomend to others.",5,2016,09,01
231,Perfect Location,"Jury's Inn is steps away from O'Connell Street with easy access to restaurants, shopping, and buses.  The hotel is clean and rooms spacious for a European hotel.  The breakfast buffet is nice; food not wonderful but filling.  Front desk folks are very helpful.",4,2016,08,31
231,"Great Location, Standard Hotel","This hotel is situation in a great location close to shopping, cafes and bars. 
Nice walk away from the main bars if you want to get away from the noise. 
Pretty standard hotel room, comfortable and clean. 
Would recommend as the hotel has a nice bar which doesnt charge ridiuloua amounts, especially for Guiness.",3,2016,08,31
231,Enjoyable Dublin,"Good location close to shops,buses & entertainment. Clean well designed room. Food in bar & breakfast area was lovely and the staff where friendly & helpful. Enjoyed the many sights while on the hop on off bus especially around trinity college & parlament.",5,2016,08,31
231,Very average ,"We booked a family room for 2 adults a 4 year old and 1 year old.

The room was small and with the sofa bed made up and a travel cot, there was very little space to move around.  

We arrived with a sleeping baby in the evening (past his bedtime) and got to the room to find no travel cot, we had requested one on the booking.  Though one was quickly brought to the room, they could only provide a sheet and no blanket, I've never experienced this before and we travel a lot throughout Europe.  They suggested we use the king size blanket provided in every room, this was extremely heavy and completely unsuitable to use in a travel cot.  

Breakfast was average lots of choice but not high quality.  It gets very busy.  I didn't like that you even had to collect your own cutlery, this made it feel like a canteen.  There were no drinks brought to table either.  This just makes it really hard work especially with 2 young children.  

I'm not sure I'd stay again.  I'm sure there must be a better offering given the amount we paid.  ",3,2016,08,30
231,Great location,Hotel in great location 5 mins from shops hotel clean staff friendly had small issue with room night duty manger Jennifer Sweeney sorted it instantly breakfast great that's my 4th time staying there  definitely stay again,5,2016,08,29
231,Ideal place,"Just got back from Dublin, we had no complaints at all and would definitely return. Great location, very close to all amenities, O'Connoll street, busses, restaurants, pubs and only a 15 minute walk to temple bar. Excellent choices for breakfast, lovely and clean throughout, staff friendly and very helpful. Altogether a really nice place to stay in Dublin. ",5,2016,08,29
231,Disappointed,"The service from the people who work there was very good, but the hotel is located in the middle of massive construction (loud), parking not included-- $10/day and a long walk away through sketchy neighborhoods-especially when you arrive at night,  breakfast not included in the high price of the room, extra charges for everything (don't know unless you ask), no late checkout or you pay more. The bright side is they store your luggage for you for free once you checkout and want to explore the city.",2,2016,08,29
231,Fantastic hotel,"Had a lovely weekend here, the hotel is clean and the staff were helpful and friendly, there was a good variety at breakfast. The hotel is within walking distance to all the bars. would definitely 
recommend this hotel. 😃 ",5,2016,08,29
231,good location but mind the prices and the parking,"location ok, cleaness ok, but a little overpriced, kids have to pay for breakfast (in others juris inn kids under 12 y old have breakfast for free).
Public Parking  with agreement not so close and very difficult to find due to works in the city",3,2016,08,29
231,Center in town-walking dit,"This was a great place to stay, it included Breakfast buffet (good food), Wi-Fi to all guest, coffee in the room, and bathtubs!  My husband is handicap and had a rough 14 hour flight from the US to Dublin. Upon arrival to the hotel, our rooms were not ready. My husband was feeling sick and needed to lay down.   The hotel clerks, Roseline and Christian understood our concern and we were able to check us in earlier, helped us with out luggage and gave us a great room.  Throughout the three days at the hotel, all staff went out of their way to assist us and make us feel at home.  The location of this hotel is close to a bank, restaurants, tour buses, and walking distance to all the sights.",5,2016,08,27
231,Excellent,Stayed here recently. All aspects from check in to check out and in between were brilliant. Breakfast was excellent. What really stood out though was the care for the customer. This is a very busy hotel but the attention to detail was second to none. I had an issue and the manager Patrick Linnane resolved it in a discreet and timely manner. Outstanding!! Thank you,5,2016,08,27
231,A good experience,In general it was a good experience. The staff of the hotel was really good and our room was OK. I think it was a good decision to book a room in this hotel. In summary it is a good place to stay in Dublin.,4,2016,08,27
231,"Wonderful hotel & staff, fab location ",We had a room overlooking the courtyard. Very quiet. The curtains overlapped to keep out all light. There were light switches by the bed. The shower was strong and hot. The coffee cups were large. The staff was friendly and did a good job. Very nice quiet accommodation in a busy part of the city. Easy access to bus to airport.,5,2016,08,26
231,Great location to explore Dublin,"The hotel is centrally located with clean and comfortable rooms. The staff at the reception are very friendly and attentive (Sandro and Ross gave us good recommendations for restaurants in the area). The breakfast is varied and in particular Thomas was looking after us really well. We would definitely recommend this hotel for a stay in central Dublin,",5,2016,08,26
231,Dublin hotel,Very nice hotel with excellent location.  Walkable distance to all main sites. Excellent breakfast. Our room was large and actually quiet at night.  We even were able to open the window for some fresh air.  Very kind and helpful staff. ,5,2016,08,25
231,Excellent location,"Well placed for transport, shopping, sightseeing & nightlife. Enjoyed our stay immensely and would recommend highly. Breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice to suit all tastes. Room decor modern & comfortable ",5,2016,08,25
231,Standard,"I usually stay at Jury's Inn Hotels when I can, as i am a Reward Member, so collecting the points is a great way of earning a free night away occasionally. This was a very last minute, change of plan booking as well. However, the restaurant closed quite early, 21:10hrs, so I only just made it in. The service was very good, so not complaining here, however I found my next course arriving within a minute of finishing the current one. Check in was good as always, although I wasn't given the WiFi password with my usual vouchers, so had to return to ask for it. The room was a tad on the small side, my fault here, as the hotel was pretty full, so took what was available. I also struggled with my card in the lifts. A comfortable and pleasant enough stay though, which Jury's Inn do give you.",3,2016,08,25
231,Comfortable ,"I stayed at this hotel while I was attending a conference at UCD. It was a pleasant stay. The room was comfortable and clean. The people were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was very good, but staff could learn how to clean tables discretely and thoroughly. The location was ok, but I would probably try somewhere different if I return to Dublin. So- a very good hotel.",4,2016,08,24
231,An enjoyable long weekend in Dublin,"The hotel is nicely located within Dublin, close to O’Connell Street which is ideal for shopping and bus links for onwards travel, and with a 10/15 minute stroll to Temple Bar. We arrived early, hotel staff were nice enough to securely store our bags for a few hours prior to us being able to check in at 2pm. Hotel itself is quite modern, with all staff that we encountered being extremely friendly. Our room was extremely clean, and even had a fridge as we’d requested on booking - Floor also had a Water and Ice machine, which was a nice touch.

We were staying on a room only basis, so can’t comment on the Food and drink available. Though the breakfast staff we kind enough to provide us with some Ketchup one morning upon request.

Overall, if we were staying in Dublin again, we would have no complaints in staying at the hotel again.",4,2016,08,24
231,Jury's Inn Parnell Street Dublin,"Great location for shopping and transport. Efficient staff. We had to leave before breakfast but were offered a breakfast on the go option; ham and cheese sandwich, fruit, juice and cookies. Food was handed to us on checkout and was very fresh look.  A great option.",4,2016,08,23
231,We'll be back,"We were treated like royalty. The staff was very friendly.  Thanks a lot to the whole team! The hotel is very central. Very close to all the big shops, cinema, Croke park, restaurants....We'll be back.",5,2016,08,23
231,Susanne fisher and friends,"Very close to shopping ,eateries . very nice to have a bath and shower in your room.would have been nice if it didn't rain as much but can't be helprd.transport was excellent  and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to any one, will Certainly let travel agent know when we get home",5,2016,08,23
231,Anne Curwen,It was okay the bathroom wasn't very good. We didn't have any dinner or breakfast. The staff were okay and the bar was good. It was difficult for me because of mobility.  If i had to choose again maybe it be okay.  The floor it was on was okay. ,3,2016,08,23
231,Very good middle class hotel,"I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel, the room was spacious and the breakfast was very good. The value is overall good. The hotel is located in a calm area and yet it doesn't even take 10 minutes to cross the river and get to Temple Bar.",4,2016,08,23
231,Decent,"Overall my stay here was good. Nice, clean hotel, friendly staff. Lots of choice for breakfast. The location was ideal, 15 minute walk away from Temple Bar. My only fault was the odd noises that could be heard from my room, 243. I'm not sure what was above but there was things being moved about at various hours and there were also noises within the walls which I find hard to describe!",4,2016,08,23
231,Short break,"Our room was great, just as you would expect from a Jurys Inn.  Great location, easy walking distance to all the attractions.  St Patrick's Cathedral, the Guinness Storehouse and Temple Bar among others.
We had breakfast and the food was lovely and fresh, there was a great choice, my only negative was we had to to wait 2 out of 3 mornings for a table as it was so busy. We stayed Monday to Thursday so I can imagine the weekends are even busier.
I would go back to this hotel.",4,2016,08,23
231,Wow ,"1st time to Dublin - came to celebrate my partners Big birthday - 2 night stay @ this lovely hotel and what can I say apart from it met all our expectations and service we received was beyond + over of what we expected. Clean, tidy + spacious room - hotel location is great.  Touches the hotel made for my partners birthday was sooo lovely. Thank you ",5,2016,08,23
231,Location is the main benefit.,"This is NOT a four star hotel. I have no idea how a 4 star rating was recieved. I booked a family room, which was probably the smallest hotel room I've ever had to stay in.  The bathroom was so tiny, the toilet was tucked behind the door and the door literally skimmed the bath as you opened it, you had to literally stand in the bath to open the door and then climb out to get to the toilet once the door was closed....I am a size 10 (uk) so it's not as if I'm a large person. It was very cold and quite a tired old bathroom. 
The beds were the most uncomfortable beds I've slept on since sleeping on a grass mat in Fiji during a cyclone. My back was killing me for the duration of our stay. They were also so light that they kept moving. Given that it was a family room, there was really no room for anyone to walk around. If one person was walking around, the other two really needed to be sat on the bed! So if you're booking a family room please take that into account. It's not a bigger room, they've just squashed more into it! 
We kept getting random phone calls from housekeeping and room service about things we had ""requested"" when he hadn't made any requests, so there was clearly an element of disorganisation and chaos behind the scenes. 
Our room was only serviced once, at about 4.30pm on the second day of our three day trip but they forgot to empty the bin and never returned. The towels are thin, rough and the toiletries are nailed to the wall, so if you're in the bath you need to get up and reach up as if you were showering, to get any shower gel (and I don't believe the contents of the bottles are as advertised). Don't use the shampoo, it's like washing up liquid. There are no robes, slippers, vanity kits. In essence, bring all of your own toiletries and bath robe.
The walls are very thin, so you can hear other people in the hotel at all hours, and we had a street facing room so we heard a lot of drunken late night noise (screaming, shouting, swearing etc..) from outside In the early hours of Saturday morning and again on Sunday morning which is not good if you've got little ones with you. 

on the positive side, the hotel is in a very convenient location. Breakfast was quite good (it was included in our room rate) but I heard people being charged €20 each and it definitely wasn't worth that.
There is free ""basic"" wifi which is good enough to check emails and social media but if you wanted to use Skype/FaceTime or stream movies/tv you need to upgrade to a ""pay per GB"" package....
The bar was clean and the staff were very friendly and the prices were reasonable and the had a good selection of drinks.. 
There is no business centre, so if you need to print anything out (boarding passes etc.) you need to email them to reception and they will print them out. The reception staff are very friendly and helpful and efficient. 
All in all, I probably wouldn't stay here again if I had the choice (especially with children) but it wasn't an epic failure, just a very, very basic means of accommodation.",2,2016,08,23
231,Irish Hospitality at its very best,"The team of staff here are the best one can find. Comprising many nationalities, all of the staff blend well together to pleasantly provide the customer with the best possible service. The sumptuous buffet breakfast is extremely satisfying, with all tastes catered for. Every imaginable item is included in the selection of breakfast items and it is all served and presented most tastefully. This hotel and in particular the Irish breakfast are undoubtedly the best that can be found in Dublin. ",5,2016,08,23
231,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Stayed at the Jury inn On Parnell Street for 2 nights as part of my 30th birthday trip to Dublin. The hotel was experience was excellent from start to finish. Rooms are clean, high standard. Fresh towels, kind staff. Cannot recommend highly enough. Worth every penny.",5,2016,08,22
231,Little room for a family - one of the two bed not made,"As I've booked a family room, I was expecting to have a bigger room.
Once the two bed deployed, we didn't have a lot of space.
Anyway, it was correct and the price not too expensive.
But we had the pleasure to discover at 11pm that one of the bad hasn't been made. Someone came to do it few minutes after I went down to the reception.
The room was clean and the services seems to be correct (we wera there for one night only)",2,2016,08,22
231,Amazing amazing amazing !,"Recently stayed at the Jury Inn Hotel Parnell Dublin with a friend who was visiting from England. I have stayed here many times previously and have always had great experiences. The hotel is very central and a great place to stay if you want to discover Dublin City centre, hope on the city bus tour just around the corner, shop on neighbouring Henry street even Grafton street and temple bar is only walking distance! What more could you want!? I wanted to show off Dublin and Ireland to my visiting friend and I am so glad I choose this hotel, the hospitality and welcome we received from all staff members was above and beyond! They couldn't do enough. We enjoyed a coffee in their vibrant bar area, dinner in their stunning restaurant and breakfast the next day all for a VERY reasonable price! Special mention to duty manager Anna and all staff for making it such a relaxing pleasurable stay, I for one will be back! Would advise anyone to stay here weather it be for business or pleasure whilst city hopping 🍀",5,2016,08,22
231,Pure Luxury,"Stayed here over the weekend . Have to say it's just fabulous , spotless clean , excellent service and the bar food is 2nd to none. Thoroughly recommend this hotel. If you are thinking of booking go right ahead , you won't be disappointed . Great location just beside all the bars . restaurants, shops and yet I had a great night sleep , I didn't hear any noise at all. ",5,2016,08,22
231,Good City Hotel,"Very good location.you can ger to the principal monuments in 10 min walking.Very silent and comfortable Room.You can rest Very good after a Long day visiting tris nice City.
The hotel is clean and good located.",5,2016,08,22
231,Great location and service.,Stayed here twice in August. Great value for the money  and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Dublin. Location was good as it was just around the corner from O'Connell street and a short walk to Henry Street and Temple Bar area.,5,2016,08,22
231,Gute Lage aber der Rest ist unterer Durchschnitt und somit zu teuer!,"Booked and payed long befor our stay but also got only a small room with only 1 (small) doudle bed and 1 singel bed and not as asked 3 singel beds for 3 adults. Most of all disappointing was the ""very bright view"" at the Dublin City Garbage Disposal from our room!",3,2016,08,22
231,Excellent,"I have used Jurys Inn on Parnell Street Dublin on several occasions over the past few years. my visits were mostly for short breaks to the city as I travel down from the north of Ireland and do know Dublin city very well, located in the heart of the city, it is close to all tourist attractions and a stones throw to a main shopping area with lots of variety of theatres,cafes or fast food etc. the hotel it self if of a very high standard, cleanliness is excellent, the staff were more than helpful, breakfast was superb with good rates. when I travel I do prefer to stay in a better type of hotel and would recommend Jurys highly.
Regards Anna Kennedy",5,2016,08,21
231,Hen weekend,Great stay at the jury's inn recently.rooms are four star standard in my opinion. We were made feel very welcome during our weekend stay. Reception staff very friendly. Breakfast excellent. Location very convenient to o'connell street and Henry st shopping,5,2016,08,21
231,Eastern European Accents in a great location,"Stayed here for 3 nights in August 2016.

Some other reviews on here have mentioned thin walls - sadly we had this too and noisy Italian neighbours after 10PM were a nuisance on 2 of the 3 nights. No fault of the hotel.

In fairness the room was fine otherwise, very clean though the double bed was not a full size which for a couple meant a few kicks and rolling into one another. Double bed nowhere near as good as say Premier Inn in the UK I would say.

One MAJOR disappointment - the level of English at reception is very Eastern European. Ok, it's comprehensible but manners, smile, use of expression is simply not Irish at all. Train your staff to say PLEASE and THANK YOU and stop using the dreadfully informal 'guys' every 5th word. If you want class, style and 5 star TripAdvisor reviews try 'sir' and 'madam' instead. A nice pleasant Irish smile at reception would really make the difference here - why did I feel like I landed in Poland?

Quick breakfast moneysaving tip: Tesco directly opposite and Centra next door does a delightful sausage bap for 3 Euro if you want to scrimp on breakfast.",4,2016,08,20
231,Comfortable start for family trip to Ireland,"My family had an enjoyable stay at Jury’s Inn Parnell for three nights as part of our road trip around Ireland. Check-in was easy as was check-out and the staff members were very pleasant. The location was pretty good; although it is a bit of a walk to any of the big attractions. A better location may be on the other side of the river. Also, once it was 6 p.m. or so we couldn’t find much open. Maybe it’s because I live in a 24-hour city, but things seemed to close early. We were chilly one night and went in search of a coffee and couldn’t find an open coffee shop anywhere and ended up at McDonalds – yikes! 

The room was clean and spacious enough for the three of us. The mattress was fairly comfortable, but a bit soft for my liking. It was also quiet during our stay. We got the bed & breakfast package so had our breakfast there each morning. It was a typical Irish breakfast and was perfectly adequate – nothing outstanding but got us off on a good start each morning. 

All in all, a good stay and would recommend.",4,2016,08,20
231,Great stay,"Stayed for 3 nights great stay and service . Lots of little extras which were very thoughtful - chocolate , water, biscuits , newspaper . Very quiet location but 2 mins to O Connell st . 
Lovely breakfast and chilled out atmosphere . 
Only ever come to this hotel when in Dublin . 
Thanks for a fab stay x",5,2016,08,19
231,Family visit,"A good hotel that generally performs well and delivers as expected.  Many of the staff were very good and one felt efforts were being made to interact personally, which let's face it we all prefer.  The hotel has a good feel about it and we've stayed several times.

When things go wrong, however - such as very slow service jeopardising theatre seats meaning a meal had to abandoned - no-one was willing to step up and resolve matters without persistence on our part; thank you to the helpful Receptionist!",4,2016,08,19
231,Central,"We stayed for 2 nights, the hotel was central to all attractions. The rooms were adequate, the bathroom was small. Breakfast was good, plenty on offer. Staff were friendly.  Taxis were waiting outside of the hotel when it was departure time making it quick and easy to get to where we needed to go. Would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be in the heart of tge city. Would stay again if we re visit Dublin.",4,2016,08,18
231,Wedding Anniversary  (Silver).,"A great hotel with very welcoming staff who are really friendly and extremely helpful. we were in Dublin to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary. We arrived on a Monday evening. Immediately on arriving at the reception desk the duty manager was called which was a bit odd. He informed us that they had had a glitch in their booking system and that the hotel was full, not to worry though they had already sorted out the problem. We were put in a taxi and sent to a 5 star hotel for the night at their expense, WOW!! We arrived back at Jury's Inn the following morning and booked in, as we were doing so we were presented with a voucher for 2 free drinks at the bar. We had a room on the 4th floor. The room was clean and tidy and we'll presented. We of course wanted to book a restaurant to celebrate our anniversary, I went to reception to ask if they could recommend anywhere, two of the staff in unison said ""The Church"" which was a 5 minute walk from the hotel. I had also explained that it was a our wedding anniversary. No sooner had I returned to our room there was a knock at the door, I opened the door to a member of staff who handed me an envelope for which I thanked them. I opened the envelope to find a voucher for complimentary Prosecco for both myself and my wife. I can not begin to tell you how well we were looked after, all staff are obviously passionate about customer service and are a credit to their employers and their industry. Thank you to all. Highly recommend. ",5,2016,08,18
231,"Great location, clean, quiet, across from a large supermarket","We had a great stay at this modern, clean, and quiet hotel. The location is great and near the main sights in Dublin. Very quiet, nice bathtub, good number of electrical outlets. We will definitely return to this site on our next visit.",5,2016,08,17
231,car park catch,the nearest carpark to the hotel cost 36 euro overnight. the carpark that the hotel refers to on their website for 15 euro per night is over 10 minuets walk away. not suitable for disabled visitors with luggage,3,2016,08,17
231,"Great hotel, good value, excellent breakfast!","Friendly and efficient staff. Great location (close to airportbus and city centre). Clean room, good beds. Nice bar. Breakfast was really great, fabulous and I really would like to come back. Good value!",4,2016,08,16

231,Excellent hotel,"Stayed here last night on business. Hotel has clearly been renovated recently. Had a very nice, quiet room which was absolutely spotless. Breakfast really good value. There is a really nice selection on the hot and cold buffet. Lots of breads and pastries to choose from also. Overall this hotel was an excellent choice. Will return ",5,2016,08,16
231,Great location in Dublin!,"Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street is in the perfect location for a family trip to Dublin. Close enough to walk to the attractions but quiet enough for when you just want to relax.
The hotel staff were great from the front desk to cleaning staff all were friendly and helpful.
Good Job Jurys Inn!!",5,2016,08,16
231,Dublin vacation,"So glad we chose this hotel. The location was superb and the staff was exceptionally good, every one of them.  The hotel was clean.  It is not a 5 star but it had everything you would really need a small gym, the best location and a super best staff",5,2016,08,16
231,Loved it.,We stayed in this hotel while my boyfriend had an exam in dublin. We went for the deluxe room and it was absolutely perfect. Showers for me have to be unreal for me to be happy and i was please with the facilities. Staff were very very friendly we would definately go back. Plus they dont charge a whole lot extra for late check out which is veru uncommon but very reasonable at the same time.,5,2016,08,16
231,clean room,The room is rather clean but we got a room facing the backyard of a factory which has garbage trucks driving around. The hotel is opposite a supermarket but it's 10 mins walk before  you see anything interesting.,2,2016,08,16
231,My experience in Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street,"Nice hotel, nice place, fantastic city. I´m sure I´ll come back (again). Service and cleanliness were excellent and we have really enjoyed our trip in Dublin city. Hotel location in also of importance for me.",5,2016,08,16
231,Excelent hotel and quiet,"Good hotel for visit Dublin, quiet , good attention , easy for arrive and depart , near to AIRPORT BUS , near to peatonal street and the shops and perfect for visit DUBLIN walking.
Recomended for couples and families, good services , ",4,2016,08,16
231,A great team,"Really well looked after by a friendly efficient team. Very refreshing. Thank you! 
Location access marred a little by major roadworks - but no impact once inside hotel. 
Great base for a family short break. ",5,2016,08,15
231,Perfect location,The staff their was awesome. They went above and beyond. Shoutout to Fortune the bellhop who went out of his way to get me an adaptor paying from his own pocket wouldn't hear of me giving him the money!,5,2016,08,15
231,Excellent Hotel!,"Used the hotel as a base for a weekend to meet up with friends from the USA. The staff were all lovely and friendly and made us feel very welcome. The room was spotless and provided hairdryer, tea & coffee tray, bottled water, iron and ironing board. The breakfast provided in the resurant was buffet style and had an  excellent amount of choice, it filled us up well into the afternoon. The location was ideal for shops, bars, restaurants and a short walk to the Temple Bar area for nightlife. We Also found the security excellent at the hotel, doors locked in main lobby late at night and you could only use the lifts with a hotel key card. The bar and restaurant were on the 2nd floor meaning no unwanted revellers late at night. All in all a relaxing and enjoyable stay. ",5,2016,08,15
231,"Very disappointed, never again!","We paid (Aug 2016) $160usd per night for this room so expected a decent economy hotel. What we got was a tired, dated somewhat dirty room in a dodgy area (with no safe or fridge in the rooms).  We were only there for two nights had it been longer we certainly would have checked out and found somewhere else.  We did complain to management who were helpful and offered to change our room and remedy issues. However, the standard is no way near to that particular price point. It's a large hotel that once past the updated lobby feels like an old peoples home in the corridors, very dreary as was the cheap standard of the rooms.   Much as I appreciate the hotel trying to help us once we pointed out the issues it certainly wasn't what we expect for this price point.",2,2016,08,15
231,Beautiful Hotel in the center,"The hotel is all 15-minute walk. Instead the hotel is excellent, the staff were very pleasant, the hotel is beautiful and very tasty breakfast.
We had only accommodation with breakfast and it was very diverse, ranging from muesli, croasanty to eggs, baked potatoes, delicious sausages.",5,2016,08,15
231,Excellent place where to stay in Dublin,"The hotel is very near to O'Connel Street, only 5 minutes walk. The stop of the Airport shuttle is 3 minutes walk from the hotel. Everything was OK, except the price of the breakfast : 10 euros for a buffet and nothing homemade.",4,2016,08,15
231,Poor,"Very disappointed. We booked a family room which turned out to be a double room with a camp bed - double - put up next to it. It left no walking space at all. Price was very high for this. Room was shabby, in need of updating, I'll avoid Jury Hotels in future as a result. Only positive thing is the receptionist who checked us in - Ross - was really pleasant, helpful and welcoming. He certainly has his work cut out. ",2,2016,08,14
231,Great location & lovely hotel,"This was the second time staying in The Jurys Inn Dublin and It was another great visit. Check in was quick and easy and reception staff were nice and friendly. 

The room was nice and cleaned daily and we had no complaints with it. 

We like this Jurys Inn as it is a 2 minute walk to O'Connell Street and another 20 minute walk to Temple Bar. 

I would recommend staying here. Always an enjoyable stay.",4,2016,08,13
231,Lovely ,"Clean, friendly and close enough to walk into the town but far enough for it not to be noisy

Great food served- I suggest trying the soda bread! 
Room service is limited, so be prepared to bring stuff in- tesco across the road.. 

Rooms spacious and we'll set out, had all amenities and beds comfy.

Staff are so very friendly and accommodating 

So good we going back! ",5,2016,08,12
231,Ok location,"I went with friends for a hen weekend.  Rooms were fine although we were over the recycling so bins were going most of the night. Fortunately good sound proofing and good aircon so we did not need windows open. 
Great selection and quality for breakfast.  Bar prices were more reasonable than some of the pubs/clubs. The airport bus stops really close to the hotel, most places are walkable. Temple bar is about 20 min walk or 6 euro in a taxi. 
Great weekend and I would stay there again ",4,2016,08,12
231,Great location and a good nights sleep,"Just returned from a three night stay. Choose this hotel for it's location and was not disappointed. Trams Buses and shopping just around the corner. Temple bar only a 10 minute walk. Dublin a little disappointing due to the road works for the new tramline and the very expensive eating and drinking out. Rooms great and very quite. Pillows a little hard for us but we all had a good nights sleep. Loved the free water and ice machines on each floor, went great with my night cap!. Would highly  recommend if you are going to Dublin.",5,2016,08,12
231,Lovely hotel,Stayed here on my hen party lovely modern hotel we didn't want to leave. It's a short walk from bars so not too noisy where hotel is. All staff amazing so helpful nothing too much for them would definitely stay here again. The rooms are lovely and modern with everything you need from a iron and ironing board to kettle and there so big the rooms lots of space.,5,2016,08,12
231,Great Hotel,Great location. Great hotel. Only problem outside is the tram works going on.  Key card system a bit crazy. Had to visit reception 4 times over 3 days to reset the card. Breakfast was ok some more veggie options would be good on the hot breakfast selection.,5,2016,08,11
231,Great hotel and within easy reach of all sites,"My wife and I booked this hotel after reading the reviews and we can honestly say we weren't disappointed. We've used Jury's Inns before and this one maintained the standard.

It is on Parnell St which is a 10 min walk from the Temple Bar area and most shopping areas. The hop on and hop off buses made the whole of Dublin accessible. 

We didn't book any food in the hotel, but the menu in the restaurant looked very good. The bar on the second floor was great and the staff there couldn't do enough to help. The prices were also reasonable and on a par with Dublin as a whole. We would recommend without hesitation  ",5,2016,08,11
231,First stay in A Jury's Inn Hotel,"It took me a long time to decide where to book for our stay in Dublin and after lots of research I felt the Jury's Inn on Parnell Strret would suit us. Whilst it's not in the heart of the action it was just a short stroll to the city centre (if you turn left out of the hotel and turn left after Penny's it's a lot quicker). The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, nothing was too much effort for them. We arrived too early for check in but were able to drop off our bags so we could explore the city and make full use of the day. The room was a standard size, plenty big enough for the two of us. The decor was nice and the cleanliness was great. The bathroom was fab, very clean and maintained to a great standard. We did find the tea and coffee provided was a bit on the mean side but the reception staff gave us as much free as we required so not a problem. This is a very secure hotel with access to rooms via keycard only - no fear of unwanted visitors here. We didn't eat in the hotel as I felt when booking the cost of breakfast seemed steep however since going around the city we found eating out to prove very expensive so it probably pays to go B&B. In general I'd recommend the hotel but only if you're happy to stroll the 10 minutes it takes to get to where all the action is. ",5,2016,08,10
231,Best Customer Service Ever,"The staff at this hotel went way out of their way to accommodate us on our very early arrival. Customer service was outstanding for our entire stay. The food served for breakfast is very good. This hotel is very conveniently located just a short walk to the River Liffey and the Temple Bar area. It is also very close to the Hop On, Hop Off bus line. The hotel was well maintained and well appointed. Highly recommend.",5,2016,08,10
231,"Great hotel, great location, great staff... What more do you want?","Had a great stay at this hotel, staff were amazing, very approachable and very knowledgeable. Offered to book is tables at restaurants and taxi's. Hotel was very clean, rooms were really spacious, couldn't fault it. Would recommend to anyone! ",5,2016,08,09
231,Family visit for football match in the Aviva stadium,"The hotel is located just off the Main Street in Dublin (O'Connell street). It is only a few minutes (~3min) walk away from the luas stop on abbey st. 
The rooms are clean & modern looking. 
The restaurant serves lovely food & after returning from the match in the Aviva, they were very accommodating getting us a table for dinner for the 4 of us at 9.25pm just before service was being called at 9.30.",4,2016,08,09
231,Dublin R&R run,"The hotel was lovely, very clean & the staff were all very pleasant & welcoming. The breakfast was very nice & the choice was amazing. The only negative thing is that we think we payed a lot of money for the room as there was sonething on they put the price up. ",4,2016,08,09
231,Enjoyable Stay,The service at this hotel was excellent. The rooms were very comfortable and clean. We only had breakfast at the hotel but we were impressed with the choice of food Excellent value for money. The Staff were helpful and friendly.  Would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2016,08,09
231,Excellent hotel and location. ,"We stayed here for the Dublin half marathon weekend and it was excellent. Location was perfect, right in the heart of the City. Breakfast was ample with plenty of choice. We dined in the restaurant on the Sunday evening and enjoyed a fabulous and very tasty 3 course meal for €21 each (adults). Our waitress Karolina was lovely and very sweet with our two children. I would definitely stay here again if returning in the future. The only minor problem we had was that every time we left the hotel out room keys seemed to time out which was annoying to have to have reset each day but it was always done with a smile and an apology. We usually stay in premier inns but wanted to be closer this time and we definitely made the right choice. ",5,2016,08,09
231,Always again!,"We've stayed at this Hotel for one night in December 2015 and we can only recommend this Hotel to everyone. The check in was very quick, easy and very friendly. The room was spacious, clean and had a view to the spire. It comes with a flat Screen, coffee & tea Station and a few more extras. Breakfast on second floor (I believe) was good. Only negative Point: the orange Juice wasn't good. Other then that: I'd always stay there again!

In fact I will for my honeymoon next year :)",5,2016,08,08
231,"Lovely and clean hotel, friendly staff and central.","My husband and I went to Dublin to celebrate our anniversary and the Jury's Inn was perfect for the occasion.  The staff couldn't do enough to help, the breakfast was delicious and the hotel was lovely.  It is in a very central location with only a short walk aroud the corner to get to all the shops and a further 5 muinutes to get to Temple Bar.  The hotel was very expensive but I think that was because of the weekend that we had chosen to go.",5,2016,08,08
231,Car parking,"The designated car parking is so far from hotel. To reach that car parking from hotel is so difficult and so complexed. In case of us, It took about over 30 mintutes due to traffic jam. It is very inconvinient. We found another car parking next to hotel. Why we cannot use it??",4,2016,08,08
231,Trip to Dublin,"We stayed here 1-5th Aug, nice rooms, clean and spacious. Tesco store opposite and fast food places a short walk. We had room only but ate breakfast on our last morning which was very nice, €10 kids eat free. Our friends ate in the restaurant and said the food was very nice. Children not allowed in the bar after 9.30pm which wasn't a problem but on the first night we went in with them and had to sit in the restaurant area. Reception staff very helpful when we asked them about places we wanted to visit etc, they printed off details of train times etc. Easy walking distance to Temple Bar.",4,2016,08,07
231,Very clean friendly hotel,We stayed here for my partners birthday last week. After finding out it was her birthday there was a bottle of prosecco waiting for us in the bar and a nice happy birthday message in our room. A short 5 minute walk from temple bar and just around the corner from all the bus stops you will need. Very friendly staff with comfy beds. Breakfast was busy but well stocked with everything. Would stay again. Thank you. ,5,2016,08,07
231,Great hotel stay,The stay at this hotel met with all my requirements and was most enjoyable. Would recommend to everyone to use them. Very pleasant stay and the location was perfect for my needs. Good value for money.,5,2016,08,06

231,Shopping trip,"From when I arrive to I left the hotel, they couldn't have done enough. Lovely staff, always a smile on their faces, couldn't have done enough for me. Dinner and breakfast was lovely. Very centre to all the shopping",5,2016,08,06
231,Good base for city exploring,"We recently stayed here and it was perfect for seeing the city, the trams were not in use due to upgrading the network so it was perfect centre to explore Dublin on foot. Rooms clean & comfortable. 
The rates are what you would expect for city hotels but we ate locally as restaurant a little pricy, plenty of local bakery's for breakfast and plenty of bars within walking distance ",4,2016,08,05
231,Top Notch Hotel,"The Jury's Inn was everything we could have wanted. Clean, attractive, efficient, good breakfast, and good location. We had no problems at all. The room was not large, but met all our needs. The staff got us a cab to get to the airport, and the driver was right on time. We chose this hotel through European Destinations and wasn't sure of what we would get. It was a good choice.",5,2016,08,05
231,Short break to Dublin,"We arrived on the way August 2016 for 3 nights. The hotel was fantastic from start to finish. It was very clean, well decorated and modern. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The food was brilliant the breakfast was amaxing and reasonably priced. Jurys Parnell Street is in a fantastic location. It's a 15 minute walk from Connolly Station. It is also a few minutes away from the shops at Henry Street, O'Connell Street and Grafton Street. We never used the bus once whilst there. It is close enough to Most of the tourist attractions too. Will definitley be back 😊",5,2016,08,05
231,Rebranded,"Booked as Jurys Inn  but rebranded as a Hilton Garden a few months before our visit.  About 15 mins walk to all the sights of Dublin, Hop on Hop off bus stops right outside hotel.  Didn't eat at hotel but food looked very good.  The airport link bus stops right outside.  Not sure quite up to Hilton standards yet but really enjoyed our stay.  Staff on reception were really helpful, nothing too much trouble.",4,2016,08,05
231,Family short stay,"Great location and good value. Booked via Trivago for 1 adult and 2 children, last minute so did little research but was pleasantly surprised. All staff pleasant and helpful. Restaurant in hotel has children menu with good food, not just the usual nuggets. Will definitely stay again. ",5,2016,08,05
231,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel in the heart of Dublin just a few steps from o Connell street, very helpful and friendly staff, very close to shops and the sights we attended, room and hotel was magnificent anything u needed help with someone was there to help",5,2016,08,05
231,Great stay 10/10,On arrival the staff were very polite and explained everything about the hotel. The location was brilliant for all attractions . Will definitely be back hopefully September for a family birthday . 👍👍👍,5,2016,08,04
231,Do not stay here - Go to Jurys Inn Christchurch Instead,"We booked this room at the last minute because we wanted to spend our last night back in Dublin rather than an airport hotel.  We could not get a room at the Jury's Inn Christchurch so we figured - same chain hotel so it must be like Christchurch -WRONG!!! 
Everything about the hotel was cold in appearance, smells old and moldy. I actually stripped the beds down to make sure the sheets and beds were clean. No view.  Location was nothing to brag about in anyway.  
*The only thing I can truly Sinead in the restaurant is so amazing, friendly and helpful! If more of the hotel staff was like her - it would have made the stay so much better!",1,2016,08,04
231,"Good stay, quite noisy",Stayed in Jurys Inn for 3 nights (Thu-Sun). The hotel was lovely and clean. Staff were pleasant and helpful. The only downfall was the noise from outside. We stayed in room 538 and across the road seemed to be Garbage trucks dumping their loads from 5-8am.in there morning. The noise of crashing bottles each morning was very pleasant. If possible avoid this room and any other on this side of the hotel. ,4,2016,08,04
231,Flynn Family Irish getaway,"Staying on Parnell at Jury's Inn was central in the city. Convenient walks of 20 minutes and less to tour much of the city.   The complimentary included breakfast was impressive and extensive. The staff working the dining area was eager to help and accommodating. Above the others, the ""Bellman"", named Fortune, was awesome and friendly.  The hotel is working towards being even more eco friendly, feel good bonus. While in town, a must do, is the hop on hop off bus tour",5,2016,08,04
231,Passing through Dublin quickly,Overnight stay in Dublin-quick catchup with friends. Hotel is perfectly fine-good walking access to sights. Unfortunately the area is a little tired-lots of road works-took away from Dublin. Good size room-good breakfast.,4,2016,08,04
231,Standard hotel.  No complaints.,"This isn't a hotel rich on atmosphere or luxury, but it gets the job done and is mostly quiet and comfortable and in a good location.  The staff is professional and the rooms are clean.  I loved that the maids left clean towels outside your door if the ""Do not disturb"" sign was up.  Breakfast was decent.  The location is a strong selling point as it's near shopping, several sights, and a LUAS stop.",4,2016,08,03
231,Fantastic hotel,Stayed here for 3 nights and it was fantastic all the staff are very welcoming and helpful. Very friendly and willing to help with anything. Hotel was emaculate and in the perfect location not to close to everything but not to far away. Would recommend to anyone and will definitely be returning. Loved it!,5,2016,08,03
231,Can't Go Wrong ,"Last minute booking for a business trip and the staff were excellent in helping arrange everything . Especially at short notice . 

I've been to Dublin a few times and this was the first visit here . I'd  most definitely consider it again when looking to visit . Thanks ",4,2016,08,03
231,Holiday,"Lovely place close to everything
Rooms are clean there is hand wash and shampoo is available but no soap 
The hop on hop off bus is right out the front door 
Car parking is around the corner from the hotel
Breakfast is good 
There is a bar for drinks
Smoking is not permitted in the hotel but you can smoke just out side to the left of the building
",4,2016,08,03
231,Excellent hotel,"2nd stay here and would come back again. Staff were lovely especially Catalunia on reception, she was amazing and great with the kids. Would always come back here if staying in Dublin. The room was clean and had everything ypu needed. 
Breakfast was lovely and so was the evening meal for me but my husband didnt rate his, so maybe down to preference. Kids got a free dessert which was win win! All in all a great hotel and we'll definitely be back again.",5,2016,08,02
231,Perfect hotel in a great location,"We stayed here for four nights towards the end of July. The whole experience was excellent. The hotel is a three minute walk from O'Connell street, the Main Street for bus connections including the AirCoach service to and from Dublin Airport, every 15 mins during the summer season. €12 return for an adult and €4 for a child. 

Located opposite the Jury's Inn is a Tesco Express which has everything you need at a reasonable price. Also as you exit the hotel to the left there are many other shops and fast food restaurants including KFC and Burger King. 

Check in is from 15:00 at this hotel. If you arrive early they have two rooms where you can leave your luggage and this is applicable before you leave. Check out is at 12. 

To operate the lift, you first have to insert your room key. This basically gives power to the lift. This is a huge bonus as it stops non residents using the facilities. 

The room was of a high standard. The electricity is also controlled by your room key. The bathroom is extremely modern with tea and coffee making facilities available in every room. 

There is free wifi throughout the hotel. The wifi is of a high speed too. YouTube videos can be played with no delay. 

Overall the stay was faultless. Nothing was too much for the staff especially at breakfast. On that note, breakfast is a full Irish breakfast with continental options available. 

",4,2016,08,02
231,Good all round hotel,"Stayed here for 4 nights. Hotel is in a good location just off O'Connell street, close to bus stops and local shops/bars, Tesco directly opposite. Couldn't fault the hotel, everything you need, rooms clean and comfortable. Free wifi which was pretty good. Rooms cleaned daily and include iron/ironing board and hairdryer. Breakfast was included which was very good, plenty of choice. Staff very friendly throughout the stay. Would certainly recommend this hotel for a stay in Dubkin and would return without hesitation.",5,2016,08,02
231,Great hotel in great city,"Had a wonderful long weekend in Dublin. Stayed in Jurys Inn Parnell Street. Central location and easy walk to main streets and Temple Bar etc
Lovely breakfast as buffet service and excellent dining restaurant. ",5,2016,08,02
231,Reviews of Parnell st Jury's inn,"Over priced breakfast whole booking experience confusing no cancellation fees were explained. Much prefer Christchurch for location as nearer all local landmarks, had a good stay none the less comfy basic rooms should be able to sleep four people in a room to make it cheaper but maybe jury's inn could look into this as we were a hen party love Dublin and to be honest didn't spend much time in the hotel ...",3,2016,08,02
231,Good location. Comfortable too!,"One night stay before heading north. Ideal for our needs. Loads of sightseeing within walking distance, or on the open-top bus. Overnight parking was in a Multi-storey 5 minutes walk away. 10 euros for 24 hours. Friends had recommended the Jury's at Christchurch but it was full. However this was a good substitute.",5,2016,08,02
231,Nice Place in Great Location,Our room was clean and comfortable and included everything we needed and was made up every day. The location is excellent and we walked to every place we visited from the hotel. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel so we can't comment on that. We found many places to eat within walking distance of the hotel.,4,2016,08,01
231,Comfortable stay,Stayed here 3 nights in July. Room was clean and beds comfortable. Had a meal in restaurant one night which was  delicious and reasonable price. Staff are very friendly and helpful. i would certainly stay at this hotel again.,5,2016,07,31
231,Good location.,"Hotel with good location, easy to arrive from the airport (near bus stop), close to temple bar. Good breakfast which is cost worth. Nice room. Kind staff. Internet is good, and it works fine in the room.",4,2016,07,31
231,too expensive for the hotel condition,"The room rate was too high compared to the other hotels we stayed in this Euro trip.  I expected more because in the picture it looked great.  When we came, the sink has a crack, we needed to call to have the sofa bed made.  I booked for a family room with 2 kids 2 adults and we were made to stay in a double bed and sofa bed. Limited electrical outlets, no fridge, no safe box. ",3,2016,07,31
231,Mr. Kresimir Raguz,"
Stay in Hotel was satisfactory and the only thing that was missing was a fridge in the room, but this problem was solved with a machine for ice on each floor of the hotel, everything else was great. I like the position of the hotel because it is near the center and to any landmarks distance is small but with all that there is no noise in rooms. All the restaurant personnel was very friendly and attentive especially I would like to state the Marka, Magdu and Karolina Strutynska, they went out several times to meet so they are greatly facilitated my stay in Dublin as they unreservedly answered on all my questions with smile.",5,2016,07,30
231,Pleasant stay,"Stayed for a conference at the CDC. Easy to walk or get bus from hotel. Staff were helpful and room well appointed and clean. Buffett breakfast was reasonable, but could get a little busy at peak times. Lots or bars and eateries nearby, with O'Connell street on the doorstep. Also the airport bus stopped a few minutes walk away.",4,2016,07,29
231,Dublin Parnell Street,"Excellent location to discover Dublin. Very well presented hotel and rooms generous size clean and comfortable. Excellent double glazing despite being on a busy road with severe road work disruption. Did not disturb us at all. 
Bar prices inline with Dublin! 
Took breakfast out of the hotel to experience Dublin. ",5,2016,07,29
231,Really good!!,"Overall, great experience in this hotel. Good location, friendly staff, clean and comfortable. 
Breakfast was very complete, even though i always eat the same. Gluten free options were given.
Check out at 12 is definitly a Plus!!",5,2016,07,29
231,Decent Hotel area a little rough,Stayed here a few times when on business  in Dublin. The staff are extremely friendly polite and professional. The room is always clean and comfortable. The breakfast is a decent buffet. Sadly the area usually has a lot of alcoholics passed out on the street or drunk in the road. Its not the kind of place I'd want my family to stay. It is walking distance from the town centre and temple bar fleet street and shopping areas etc. The views from the windows at the rear are not pleasant sadly. Good for a businesses stay but not ideal for young families. ,3,2016,07,29
231,Ok dinner spot,"quite nice pub food - enjoyable .. Liked the burger very much ! Good atmosphere , good service ! We thought the chips were nice but possibly oil a bit stale. Good value meal. Was close to where we we staying so very convenient location. Nice rooftop bar after dinner
",3,2016,07,29
231,Relaxing,"We were visiting  Dublin on a couple of days Break. It's a very central hotel. We basically walked every where that we wanted to go but if you would prefer to use public transport, this is all very accessible as you are only a stones throw from O Connell street. The hotel is nice and quiet and the rooms were tidied daily and were clean. ",5,2016,07,28
231,We are not disabled!!,"Being So Slow at book in we didn't get a good feel about the place.  Room was clean and bed very comfortable.  Bathroom a bit dated and ""Holding Bars"" etc., for disabled.
  
In the morning, heard a cough and jumped out of bed (6.25am) thinking someone was in the room.  My pillow was about 3 feet away from a door stuck in the middle of our room, locked, leading to a next door room???  Heard every word of a telephone call.

In the afternoon, (3pm) the new residents arrived just as we were going to have an afternoon nap... were young... giggled...well she did....for an hour.  I'll stop there!!

Private....Maybe they thought THEY were.  Room Number +++.

Stay Again?  No Way!!  Fire Proof Doors are fine....what about Sound Proof??",3,2016,07,28
231,Pleasant Stay,This was our first experience with this hotel chain and we were very pleased with out stay.  Our room was larger than expected with plenty of plugs for recharging our devices.  It was clean and the bed was very comfortable.  The hotel location is very central for sight seeing and the staff were very helpful with directions.  Staff also printed tickets for us since the hotel has no business center.  Breakfast was a buffet with a large selection of hot and cold foods.  We'll look for opportunities to stay with this chain again.,5,2016,07,28
231,Central,"We were first timers to Dublin. The hotel turned out to be central, close to the Main Street and an easy walk to temple bar area. The staff were lovely. We were checked in early. The room was clean. We went to murrays bar which is just up the road by the statue at the start of the main road. It was busy with a good vibe and the pub food was fine. There is a garden bar but you have to put up with smokers. We got a taxi which was quite a bit dearer than the estimates you see on line. I think 30 euros from memory but that may well be because of the disruptions caused by the work on tram lines.",4,2016,07,27
231,JUst the basics,"I think this hotel is fine if you don't require a nice bar or hotel lobby.  Having seen the Jury Inn at Christ Church, I think this one was on a lower scale.  The staff was very nice and the rooms were very clean. I changed hotels as I wanted a more upscale hotel but if you just want a clean room this hotel is fine. A good location as well.  ",3,2016,07,27
231,Jurys Inn,We stayed for 3 nights hotel staff were friendly and helpfull.  The hotel was close to everything and lots of places to eat nearby.  I  would recommend this hotel for everyone. The hotel was easy to get to using the shuttle bus from airport ,5,2016,07,27
231,Poor Bathroom experience,Unfortunately bin in bathroom not changed and not a good experience which sort of ruined our stay as I could not stop thinking about it .....  I would have thought that the hotel would have tried to make up for this as this was a big issue for us during our stay......,3,2016,07,27
231,Good location but not value for money,We stayed here for three days on arrival to Ireland . Compared to other places we stayed this was not value for money . It was well located however the rooms were not of the standard I would have expected. They need a refresh and to be updated,3,2016,07,26
231,Enjoyable stay,"The hotel is very central and within 5 mins walk of Dublin city centre , close to Luas stop. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Room was very clean and comfortable. Even though it's on s busy street it was still quiet and relaxing ",4,2016,07,26
231,Conveniently placed hotel.,Hotel was well situated for exploring the city. The hop on hop off buses were close by as was the Air coach connection.  Apart from disappointing breakfast the hotel was fine for a two night stay at the start of our tour of Ireland.,4,2016,07,26
231,Clean and friendly,Everyone was so nice breakfast was good and very clean the bar and restaurant where nice and if I ever go back I would stay here again the rooms where very comfortable and just a over all good experience ,5,2016,07,26
231,"Jurys, Parnell Street Dublin","An excellent Hotel just off the top of O'Connell Street. Good city centre location with Car Parking nearby. However, Tram line construction work in the city centre is causing major traffic problems so, if possible, avoid driving in the city.",4,2016,07,26
231,Visit to Dublin,"We stayed at the hotel during a short break to Dublin, the hotel was central to all the main attractions (just round the corner from most tourist buses) we can't fault the hotel of staff, the staff were very friendly and helpful with any query we had & we always got an answer. Would definately recommend to others & stay there again ",5,2016,07,25
231,Quick visit in dublin,"This hotel was really ok. Perfect location, nice staff, quite room and very nice breakfast.
Bus stop to/ from airport very near. Fantastic breakfast. Room was ok and all services near by. This is just my kind of hotel.",4,2016,07,25
231,"Nice enough, but pretty basic","It is a simple hotel, everything worked well- clean, spacious room, great location, quiet, decent gym. Can't complain, didnt really have the charm or anything amazing to write home about but i can't fault it either. If you want an experience from a hotel, this isnt for you, but if you want somewhere clean and nice where you dont have to worry about anything, this will cover your bases.",3,2016,07,24
231,A short break away,"This hotel has it all,  and only a short stroll from the restaurants, bars, shops and all that Dublin has to offer. The service was excellent and the hotel was spotlessly clean and very well maintained. We can't speak too highly of this hotel and all its staff, and we look forward to our return visit.",5,2016,07,24
231,A couple of days away,"Just on our way home after a couple of days away. Really enjoyed our stay great location, very clean, friendly and helpful staff. Compliments to Louise lovely person makes you feel at home. No complaints at all will definitely go back",4,2016,07,23
231,Great place to stay,"The service was wonderful and the people were very friendly. The location was great for walking to restaurants, pubs, shopping, and sight seeing. Our room was very clean and comfortable, and the entrance, checkin area and restaurant area were also very clean. They provided a wonderful breakfast with a big variety. They also held our luggage after checkout so we could continue exploring Dublin and called a cab for us when we needed to get to the airport. ",4,2016,07,23
231,Short trip to Dublin,"After delay in getting into room due to the numbers of large groups leaving and arriving our stay was very enjoyable. Staff friendly and the room was kept very clean. Easy access to city centre, airport bus and tourist buses.",3,2016,07,22
231,"Great location, exceptionally helpful staff","We had a problem with a medical device (cochlear implant) during our stay. The concierge, mr fortune, was exceptionally helpful in locating a deaf services agency who was able to assist with fixing the issue. He is a real asset to your hotel.",5,2016,07,22
231,Too expensive for the provided service.,"There was no salmon at the breakfast, in that price range what Jurys Inn represent it is not satisfactory. It would be a great hotel, but either for a lower price or with better breakfast service (in my opinion).",2,2016,07,22
231,One day in Dublin,"Central position, temple bar onky at 5 minutes walk. Airlink 747 Bus from the airport stop near by. friendly staff, clean. Possibility to leave our luggage at the hotel after check out. High attention to security. Very good choice for breakfast.",5,2016,07,22
231,Great for families,"Right in the centre, the hotel was a good base for us and our two children to go sightseeing. We used the baggage storage as we arrived early, and also used it on departure as we left late. Room & facilities were clean, and the breakfasts were relaxed with lots of choice. All staff from housekeeping, to waiting on, the porter and front desk were friendly, approachable & helpful. We would definitely recommend it.",4,2016,07,21
231,"Great location, even better staff.","The staff of this hotel are capable, friendly and dedicated. They made my new husband and I feel very special during our short stay. Meticulous attention to detail and care shown by all who we dealt with left us with a really positive impression of the hotel,and we heartily recommend it to anyone. ",5,2016,07,21
231,good hotel,"Clean, frendly, finest breakfast...
the stuff are wery frendly end help us every time... with a taxi is no problem to come to this hotel... great hotel with a  beautyful entrence... four stars for this hotel",4,2016,07,21
231,Pretty dang good ,"My only complaint about the hotel was the lack of service efficiency at the front desk, but that might be just a cultural difference. The rooms were clean with a good view and the hotel itself was in a convenient location. The staff was more than happy to give you directions and their luggage storage service is really handy. ",4,2016,07,20
231,July 2016,"The hotel is very well situated to transport, pubs/restaurants, grocery/markets & other retail shopping. It is also in easy walking distance to various Dublin sites.

For our fellow American travelers...there are ice/water machines conveniently located on room floors. IF you want a container for ice, ask at the bar for an ice bucket. It is easy to fill water bottles at the ice/water machines. The hotel does not provide lotion; however, you may buy inexpensive lotion at the Tesco across the street. WIne/Beer are also available at Tesco and Lydl which are both near the hotel.",4,2016,07,20
231,SUPER HOTEL,"This hotel was perfect. The location was very good just a minute from O'Connell Street and shopping and only a few more minutes to Temple Bar. The bedroom was lovely and modern with a walk in shower (which we requested on arrival). Buffet breakfast was exceptional with everything you could want from cereals, pastries, bacon,sausage,eggs etc, yoghurts, juices and much more. All the staff were extremely professional and friendly. If you decide to use the safety deposit box be warned - it is a free service, but if you loose the key, it will cost you 250 Euros ! We shall definitely return here and would give the hotel top marks.",5,2016,07,20
231,Staying in Dublin's City Centre,"Jury's in Parnell Street is wonderful and is commended to any who want a top quality hotel in the most convenient location possible. The airport bus in both directions has a stop nearby, we walked to the theatres in the evening, there was city bus tour available just as close as was a river trip, the bus services to and from the suburbs work really well with good directions provided by the drivers, the stops are nearby also. We will be going back there as soon as we can",5,2016,07,19
231,One night couple experience,"Staff were extremely helpful and considerate. The hotel is in quite a good location, just off O'Connell street in Dublin City centre and close to the Luas (tram) line as well as high street shops. The room was very clean and comfortable. It may not have exceptional facilities but this hotel makes the best of what they've got and the service was truly excellent, could not fault the staff on anything. I'd recommend booking a room on the second floor as this is where the hotel bar and restaurant is, and thus where the breakfast is served. ",4,2016,07,18
231,Conveniently located and clean,This hotel was perfect for our family trip to Dublin. We stayed there for 3 days over the course of our trip. The hotel was extremely convenient to all of the downtown locations. Only a 10 minute walk to Temple Bar and the fun south parts of Dublin. There was breakfast included and good wifi for the other American travelers out there. I would absolutely recommend it. We had 5 people in my party so we had an extra bed in the room. The added bed was very comfortable! For more of my travels check out my page and my blog!,4,2016,07,18
231,Quality of food variable ,"Over night stay in Jury's. Staff were very helpful and friendly, with nothing too much trouble. 
Room was nicely presented.
We were very disappointed with the evening meal and did mention this to the staff who had asked how it was. A complimentary drink was given.
Breakfast was very good. ",3,2016,07,18
231,"Excellent, central, inner cirt hotel","Cannot fault one second of the stay, from checkin to checkout and all points in between, the stay was excellent. Room clean, staff super helpful, food excellent and well prices, bar prices good as well.",5,2016,07,18
231,Dublin holiday,Couldn't fault anything in the hotel very clean rooms very comfortable.Enjoyed our stay. Food and bar lovely staff very friendly and always willing to help. Would recommend to anyone staying in Dublin city centre location. ,5,2016,07,18
231,Jury Inn,Check in was easy.  Our room was not ready when we got there because we traveled on an overnight flight but they stored our bags for us and directed us to a bathroom where we could change and freshen us.  Also gave us a recommendation for a local place (Murrays) to grab breakfast before heading out to explore the city of Dublin. ,5,2016,07,18
231,Excellent arrival hotel,"My husband and I sometimes have difficulty selecting a good hotel for arriving (in the morning) from the US. This trip we had a selection as part of a travel packages and we're so glad we chose Jury's Inn. Our chief requirements - room darkening shades or curtain, hard and soft pillows and a good bed. We weren't disappointed. The room also had no street noise. The breakfast buffet was wonderful. In all - a great arrival hotel.",4,2016,07,18
231,Good hotel,"Good hotel on North side of Dublin. Tram lines being laid in road outside hotel so not very attractive for the area. 
Excellent breakfast. Tea and coffee provided in room. Provide more if you require. Helpful, polite staff.

5 - 10 minutes walk from Temple Bar.",4,2016,07,17
231,Shopping Trip ,"Stayed here on a shopping trip to Dublin, rooms were spotless, lovely staff and great atmosphere was great, the breakfast is absolutely fab and great selection, will always stay here on out yearly shopping trip, great location and convenient for getting off the bus, near the bus station for going home",4,2016,07,17
231,Well located but expensive,This was a well placed hotel close to all the key Dublin sites. The drink and food was expensive and the hotel was very busy. I would stay here again but wait for the deals. The staff were not as friendly as expected and is normal to the capital,3,2016,07,17
231,good place to stay,"very nice personal, clean rooms, good location, very good price.
i have booked the room few weeks before with few notices about the floor and room size. everything was OK! i was very glad with that holiday, highly recommend this hotel!
in room we had everything that I need even the iron that didn't writen in room depends! ",5,2016,07,16
231,Great Location But Not Cheap,"I did a lot of research and booked about 4 hotels in Dublin before I settled on Jury's Inn. I was visiting with my teenage sons, so hotels in Dublin/Europe charge you per person. Because of that, the rooms become pricey for a family of 4. This one turned out to be almost €500/night for two rooms. This hotel was great in so many ways: loved the location so close to Parnell Square where we met up for Waling Tours and Gray Line Day trip tours, and only a 10"" walk to Temple Bar. yet, it was very quiet, despite the ripping up of the streets of Dublin for a new tramway, and constant traffic and bottlenecks. The hotel was very clean, and the beds super comfortable. Customer service was also excellent. There was no safe in the room, but you can lock up your personal belongings in the lobby. Breakfast was not included in our meal, but you can have a traditional Irish breakfast for 10 euros at the hotel or plenty of nearby cafes. The wifi was fine/adequate but worked better in the lobby than the rooms. The only issues I can recall was that the towels were rough and not soft to the skin. However, I did think it was expensive, but it wasn't that different from other places in Dublin. I think the hotels closer to town center were more expensive and noisier.",4,2016,07,15
231,Good location and comfortable stay,"This was our last stop before we headed back home from our 10 day vacation in Europe. The hotel was conveniently located for our one night stay.  We took a shuttle bus from the airport and we only walked about 6 minutes from the bus stop.  It's a modern hotel and based on the size, it clearly catered to short stays or to business travelers. Good reception and had the courtyard room we reserved as the street is very busy especially with all the construction going on in the city.  It was comfortable and had all the amenities of a modern hotel including A/C.  Impressed with the energy conservation features. 

The bedding were clean. However the bed is hard if you prefer not to have soft beds. For one night, it was not an issue. It was quite but may be because we were exhausted from all the walking. Dublin acts like a very big city. It is very crowded and noisy with a lot of traffic.
 
As far as breakfast is concerned, I would pay attention to the breakfast schedule warnings in the elevator. It felt like a high school cafeteria. Don't expect a quite morning breakfast. This is a big size hotel and the staff does its best to keep up. Given the limited choice of good hotels in the city centre, I will surely consider this hotel again if we ever return to Dublin. Catching the shuttle back to to the airport was also a fairly easy walk.",3,2016,07,15
231,VERY GOOD HOTEL IN A VERY GOOD LOCATION,"A VERY GOOD HOTEL. EXCELLENT BREAKFAST AND NICE ROOMS. VERY WELL LOCATED.
Although it was in a noisy street, the room was quiet and silent  to sleep in. The breakfast has all you can imagine...The location is at one block from the main street, so you are near of every place in Dublin.",4,2016,07,15
231,First Stop In Europe Hoilday,"This was our first stop in a eight week Europe holiday, arrived late at night & was warmly greeted at the reception, the rooms are average size, but very comfortable, breakfast was good, staff were excellent.
Good location, easy walking to main shopping areas & 5 min walk to the Big Red Bus Stop,",5,2016,07,14
231,Weekend in Dublin,"Great hotel, 15 minutes from the airport , does the job perfectly.
Good location nice rooms great breakfast very clean good helpful staff would definitely stay there again and recommend to others.
Bar and gym also good clean and tidy. Use the red hop on and off bus great informative drivers .",4,2016,07,14
231,"Friendly, professional and great location","Jury's Inn on Parnell Street is a perfect place for those who do not want the B&B experience. The location is perfect, Temple Bar, Connelly Street and the River are within walking distance and public transportation is close. The roadworks are inconvenient, but that is a temporary situation. There are a number of nearby pubs and restaurants, as well as a Tesco's and convenience stores in the immediate vicinity. The premises are immaculate, the rooms are comfortable and pristine. The staff are attentive but unobtrusive. The bar is a pleasant place to have a drink or watch a match, snacks are available and tasty. The check-in and check-out process is smooth and efficient. A very good value.",5,2016,07,14
231,Clean,"Happy with our stay, hotel was clean and comfortable. Complaints are - Air con made a noise, didn't provide slippers in the room. Creature comforts make all the difference! Would recommend to others visiting Ireland.",4,2016,07,13
231,Short break in Dublin,Hotel is just off O'Connel street and near bars and restaurants.  It is about  a 10 minute walk from Temple Bar.  Hotel staff were very efficient and friendly.   Buffet breakfast is very good with a great selection of food. ,4,2016,07,13
231,Would stay again,"Stayed at the Jury's inn for 3 nights on business. I had heard some bad reviews before I visited but I enjoyed my stay. The rooms are standard, what you'd expect from a chain, but clean & I had no issues. Great location for me for work, but a little bit far away from the main bars etc if that's what you're looking for. Easy enough to get from the airport. There's a large tesco across the road, and there are lots of restaurants nearby. ",4,2016,07,13
231,60th birthday trip,"great hotel perfectly situated with great staff
Dublin is a bubbling city that is amust to vist there is a vast veriaty of things to do and the people are 
very helpful the jamerson distillery is a must as is the guinniss brewery",5,2016,07,12
231,Early check in. Great service. Well located,We arrived early but the check in clerk kindly found us a room. Very attentive and very professional. I have stayed many times in Jury's so what I got was what I was expecting. Well done Jury's Parnell St.,5,2016,07,12
231,Amazing,Such a fantastic hotel. Staff are very friendly and welcoming. We arrived early and asked to leave our bags as we wanted to walk around the city and the staff allowed us to check in early to leave our bags in our room. Outstanding service. The bar was lovely with nice staff to. I would definitely come back again :),5,2016,07,12
231,Hen do!,"15 of us stayed here for my soon to be daughter in law's hen do. We found the location to be ideal for us. Reception staff were efficient and the security man was extremely helpful giving directions and taxi advice etc. During our 3 day stay it was my daughter's birthday, staff in the dining room were exceptional organising candles on birthday cake and arranging tables for us all to sit together.",4,2016,07,12
231,Booking problem,Ordered a twin room in April came in July to be told only a double bed (for 2 large fully grown males) I was told this was because they where busy although I booked the room months ago? Eventually told room sorted found it was one double bed and a sofa bed so first night very uncomfortable but they did manage to move us next day thanks to a very helpful lady who hadn't been on the first night,3,2016,07,12
231,Excellent,"Only stayed one night, but the staff were excellent and very helpful, we needed to leave our bags before and after, the service was great and secure as was the rest of the hotel. The breakfast was great with a good selection of food. We will be back. ",5,2016,07,12
231,Great Central location with friendly staff,"Arrived at hotel early and was given room straight away. Receptionist was very friendly and welcoming. Lunch was lovely and good value. Service was quick too. Room was clean and fresh, had a great nights sleep. Great Central location ",5,2016,07,12
231,Mary in Dublin,"Fabulos place, very secure, felt very safe, good value for money, very central to all tours and out of city trips. Staff were friendly. Even the maintenace staff changing light globes stepped down from their ladders to let me pass. Great parking deal with Clearys Carpark, easy access to hotel",5,2016,07,11
231,Beyonce bound,"Overall was very happy with our stay here, staff lovely, hotel spotless, and location was just perfect. Food & service in restaurant was also spot on and breakfast had plenty of everything The room was spotless with air con thank god as was hot day/night so we slept well ",5,2016,07,11
231,Great experience in Dublin!,"We had a great stay at the Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street.  We arrived too early for our check-in time, but the front desk staff were very gracious and offered to let us leave our luggage there while we explored the city.  The room was clean and comfortable, and very quiet.  Everyone was extremely polite, professional, and friendly; this comes with the highest recommendation possible- stay here!",5,2016,07,11
231,Great location - good value,Really happy with a quiet room on the fourth floor at an affordable rate - small but totally adequate . Excellent staff and great breakfasts served. Easy walking to the busy centre of Dubln - highly recommended for value for money,4,2016,07,10
231,Nice 3 stars hotel,Good located hotel in centre of the city. Nice breakfast with a lot of choice. Breakfast only starts at 7am which may be a bit late for business people. Basic rooms. Internet is good but premium Internet is not free. Bed is on wheels which gives a strange feeling.,4,2016,07,10
231,Another tale of two rooms!,"Overall a very good hotel that I would recommend to friends and family. Try and get a room that looks out at the cathedral, or over the green space to the right of the hotel. The interior rooms tend to look out at concrete faced rooms opposite. Not the end of the world, but every little thing makes a difference to your stay (see photos attached).
I would also recommend the breakfast. There is something for everyone. I had a little of everything and didn't need to eat a lunch LOL",4,2016,07,10
231,Awesome.. ,Had an amazing time away for my birthday at this hotel.. Perfect location and in easy distance for temple bar etc.. Dublin a beautiful place in general anyway.. Loved the Australian bar/restaurant on the same street for food and drinks.. Perfect place to watch sports too.. Would have no hesitation in booking this hotel again.. Loved it.. All you can eat breakfast hit the spot too 👌👌👌,5,2016,07,09
231,High recommend and will be back! ,"Stayed here for one night in July '16 before travelling to Australia the next evening from Dublin airport. Absolutely fabulous service and great hotel. Ideal location, 2mins off O'Connell street. Breakfast was included in the price of the room which was a bonus. Rooms were spot on! Highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2016,07,08
231,Hotel was good but nightmare parking,"Hotel was pretty standard large chain. Rooms comfortable and clean. Breakfast is standard buffet and occasionally really busy when a coach party sweeps in. 

Stopping outside to unload baggage is a complete nightmare. There is no room due to buses and everywhere is yellow lines. Managed to double park for 2 minutes, then had to move the car before we got ticketed. Would probably not stay here again, nothing really to differentiate from the competition",3,2016,07,08
231,Dublin digs,"Hotel was a clean comfortable stay. Neighborhood could be a bit nicer but overall, the hotel and staff are very good. We enjoyed our stay very much and would definitely stay here again. Centrally located, this hotel is a great place from which to see the town

",4,2016,07,07
231,Lovely stay..,"I recommend this hotel very convenient location, excellent friendly staff , great breakfast,very comfortable room no complaints at all very happy with my stay I recommend. Also car parking available less than 5 mins walk  from hotel discounted with hotel .",5,2016,07,05
231,Nice hotel. Toilet was disgusting.,"The Jurys Inn on Parnell street had a great atmosphere and was a very modern hotel. We stayed on the top floor and the views were really nice - especially during the sunset. However, once we woke up in the morning, the toilet smelled so bad! It smelt like a really dirty public toilet. So bad infarct that we were unable to take a shower in the morning!! I went down to the reception and told them about this and they sent a maintenance guy to look at it. He said he had never smelt anything as bad as that in his life!! He said there must be something wrong with the pipes so he put some strong chemicals in the drains and said it would be fine in a few mins. Which it was not! When i went down to check out they just appologised and did not offer any refund for our stay, which i thought was poor. It ruined our day as we were not able to shower. I'm sure this was a rare occurrence but if it happened in our room, it might happen in some others.

However, the hotel was in a great location, the breakfast was fantastic and the staff were warm and friendly.",2,2016,07,05
231,Jury's Inn parnell st,Good hotel in great location in dublin city centre no problems in hotel staff and services were top notch no problems with dietary requirements  the weather wasn't great but you can't have everything  it's ireland after all,4,2016,07,05
231,In center city...no parking,"Hotel was nice and restaurant was very good. However, no parking at hotel. Had to park car in a lot a couple blocks away and it was expensive and not reimbursed.Rooms were nice but view was lousy. Overlooking trash facility with garbage.",3,2016,07,04
231,Great hotel!,"Fab hotel for short city break, great location just off O'Connell street in close proximity to shops and buses and short walking distance to Temple bar area. Staff were very friendly and helpful, request for a fridge in room due to special dietary requirements was met. Rooms nice, clean with enough space and tea & coffee facilities, nice bathrooms also. Great stay!",5,2016,07,04
231,I loved Jurys Inn in Dublin!,"The staff at Jurys Inn in Dublin were extremely supportive during my research trip to Rotunda Hospital in Dublin.  The breakfasts featured excellent food in a light, airy environment that was conducive to work with colleagues.  The bar was a great place to unwind and discuss plans with friends.  The view was good, especially looking toward Parnell Street. I plan to return to this hotel in the future.  Thanks!!!!",5,2016,07,04
231,Great central Hotel,"Spent two days in Dublin. This hotel  is located very well if you want to have most things in walking distance. The staff are all very welcoming, friendly and very helpful. We had dinner in the bar which was very good. Rooms are clean and the beds  are comfortable. Plenty of information on things to do while in Dublin.",5,2016,07,02
231,Nice and comfortable,"Clean, comfortable, breakfast was really nice!!! Nice location, short walk to the main shopping area. I had a meal in the evening but it wasn't very outstanding. Really nice experience for my first trip in Dublin. The staff were friendly. It's good for business trips and quick stops.",5,2016,07,02
231,Perfect hotel.,"The hotel is in the perfect location for all the touristy things in Dublin - shops, bars, restaurants, historical buildings etc. without the need for any other transport.

The hotel is very clean, spacious and the staff are well trained and friendly. 

We would stay here again without looking for alternative accommodation. There's no need because it's just what we wanted. I would recommend this hotel to any of my friends or family who are travelling to Dublin. 

It costs about €30 from the airport in a taxi.",5,2016,07,02
231,Good Hotel in the City,"Stayed overnight on a business visit to Dublin with the hotel chosen and booked by the client.  Jury's Inn just about ticks all the boxes - friendly reception, clean and tidy public areas without being memorable, a decent room with all amenities - iron, hairdryer, tea and coffee and wifi - and a very comfortable bed.  The list goes on: - no noise at all (an inside room not facing the street), modern bathroom with lashings of hot water.  The only down side; a poorly kept courtyard full of beer kegs and scruffy containers and a view of nothing but windows and walls.

Staying on business, the excellent buffet breakfast was almost spoiled by the large number of children who were staying here.  Not the hotel's fault at all, but feral and untamed brats with adoring parents watching them run around the buffet isn't really my style - particularly when they are obviously American.  Excellent food though and a reasonably pleasant place to eat it.

Very friendly staff and I left my suitcase for the day's business and picked it up later from Reception.

Thanks to all concerned - sorry I can't get more enthusiastic, but as a one night hotel at a reasonable price in the middle of Dublin, this does the job perfectly!",4,2016,07,02
231,Very bad experience with payment of my stay in hotel.,"I had very bad experience with payment regarding my stay in hotel. When I checked out hotel staff did not settled amount from my pre-authorization, instead of that they took money again from my card. that means I paid money twice for my stay. After 5 days I didn't received my pre-authorization money. this is terrible, can't expected this kind of experience. Please take care of this in future.",2,2016,07,01
231,Wonderful experience în the beatiful Dublin,"After our first experience in Dublin two years ago when we have spent the winter holiday and New Eve Party and enjoyed very much the places and the people in Ireland, we decided to come back. This time we had the chance to discover other beautiful places in this amazing country. In the end of our holiday we returned to Dublin for five nights and stayed in Juris Inn Parnell hotel. It is a very good location for tourists with friendly staff, especially the two Romanian ladies in the reception. We will recommend this hotel to our friends who would like to travel to Ireland. Maybe it is better to have the name of the hotel more visible from outside of it.oana and Adrian ",4,2016,06,30
231,Nice,We didn't have high hopes for this place at first. It was easy to find from the parking garage they recommended. ( make sure to get ticket validated). The staff was very cheerful and friendly on arrival. The rooms were clean and spacious. It was nice that they had extra pillows in room. We enjoyed the breakfast which was included in our stay. We visited the bar and had a few beers and ate.  I don't recommend eating at the bar or restaurant.  The hotel is located in a great spot. Just a short walk around the block and you are in the shopping district. ,4,2016,06,30
231,A bit of an oasis amidst chaos,"Situated very close to the main drag of O'Connell Street, this large hotel is built amongst a busy tourist/shopping area and amidst massive roadworks as Dublin continues to improve and upgrade its city tram system.

Through the street doors you enter the relative quiet of a large reception area where plenty of staff were on hand to make sure you were looked after. We were located on the 3rd and as if to emphasise the size of the hotel, the journey from lift to room seemed to take an age. Thankfully, the room was comfortable and adequately appointed. We had an inward facing room overlooking a central courtyard and all was quiet. We didn't dine here or indeed have breakfast so are unable to comment on the food. We managed to find sufficient variety around the city to cater for our food needs.

We had an enjoyable stay and we wouldn't want to detract from what is on offer but, I am aware that Jury's has a second hotel in the City and although slightly further away from the centre is more quietly located. Other than that, I think Parnell Street is fully satisfactory.",3,2016,06,30
231,Great stay midweek.,"Despite our short stay, we were welcomed perfectly. The people at the reception, restaurant, bar and maintenance were all very friendly. Blissful breakfast with attention for special needs. Ideal for people who have a certain food allergie or being a vegetarian. The hotel and the rooms were very clean. No problems with noise.",5,2016,06,29
231,Very good hotel,Checked in right away the staff was better than the belfast staff I would come again the rooms were very good the dinner was good and the bar life omg it was the best the staff and customers would take to u even if they never seen u before come again,5,2016,06,29
231,Great location,Location was great staff was friendly and helpful. People were loud on the street at 2am would suggest an interior room to avoid noise. Rooms were clean and bathrooms were clean. Breakfast was good with lots of choices.,4,2016,06,28
231,Dublin trip,"Lovely hotel close in centre, most attractions within walking distance staff friendly and helpful rooms clean and beds comfortable breakfast had plenty of choice and didn't have to wait to sit down even at busy time",5,2016,06,28
231,weekend in Dublin,"Despite arriving and being told they had overbooked, they did accommodate us in the sister hotel for 1 night and arranged  for taxis to and from the hotel, we then spent the 2nd night at the original hotel, we still had a good experience in the Jurys Inn. The breakfast was lovely and had plenty of choice. The hotel was very clean and the staff very helpful. ",4,2016,06,28
231,Brilliant weekend in Jurys Dublin,We stayed in jury's for my mother's 70th birthday and it was a fantastic experience.  The hotel is so central. The hotel is very clean and staff very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was delicious.  We will definitely be returning. Thanks for a great weekend. ,5,2016,06,28
231,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed in this hotel for one night in June as we went to an event at the 3 Arena. Arrived before check in and there was a room to put our cases in until we was able to check in a few hours later. The room was immaculate. We had a twin room and the beds were bigger than a single and so comfy (the pillows were amazing) I would recommend booking the breakfast!! Had the option of a full breakfast, continental breakfast, porridge, cereals, omelettes, waffles, fruit and yoghurt. Overall a good stay and I will be returning. Thank you",5,2016,06,27
231,Summerweekend," A very nice hotel with nice professional staff, nice rooms, clean and they were tidied up every day 
Good breakfast buff'e and you don't have to decide until morning if you want to eat breakfast-just tell and pay ( or put in on the bill)to the staff 
You can leave your luggage safe if you arrive early or leave after checking out time A nice  gentleman helps you to put in a safe room.
The hotel is very quiet- we didn't hear any notice from outside or from in the hotel
They also have a very nice bar where you can have drinks of course but also some food 
We tried most of the menu and all we ate was very good,tasty ",5,2016,06,27
231,Cost of room - way too high,"The room was adequate, clean and comfortable.  But the cost was almost $900 Canadian for two nights, plus breakfast.  The room rates have not been near that, either just before or after the dates of June 15 and 16.  Too high, apparently once the availability is low, the prices are jacked up.",2,2016,06,27
231,Vacation,"Loved the flavored water and cookies in the lobby. Loved the free water and chocolate in the room,  as well as the air conditioning. Wished family room was bigger. Breakfast buffet was very good. Good experience overall.
",4,2016,06,26
231,Very good located hotel,"It is fantastically located in the middle of Dublin. Its stuff is very nice and helpful. It is good quality-price. It is clean, maybe the only downside is that the bathroom is a bit outdated it would be great it is renewed.",4,2016,06,26
231,Function over form,"Chose this spot for a business trip to Dublin for its central location and proximity to my one must see site in Dublin - the GPO.  The room was perfectly fine with no bells and whistles. I'd asked for a quiet room and had one overlooking the central courtyard, a rather bleak outlook but I have to say, it was quiet. Didn't use any of the facilities apart from one drink in the bar which again was fine.  The area round was a bit more scruffy than I'd expected given its central location, and all the people I met with from Dublin were a bit dubious about the location, but we had no issues. I'm sure it will look a lot better once the tram line is laid down and the mess that's generating is cleaned up. I'd probably not chose this spot again but it was serviceable, convenient and reasonably priced in high season Dublin. ",4,2016,06,25
231,Great value!,"We chose this hotel to extend our time in Dublin after a 16 day tour of Scotland and Ireland.  The location was much better than  the hotel we were in when we ended the tour.  We did not regret our decision.  The location was great for sight seeing and catching the hop on - hop off bus.  We were also pleased with cleanliness, bedding and service.",3,2016,06,25
231,"Clean hotel, large room. location ok, staff great","Wonderful staff, very helpful with anything you needed; recommendations, getting taxis etc. The rooms were large and clean. Hotel was quiet and not in a central hub, but just off of O'Connell street. So easy to walk down and across the river to get to Temple Bar area.",4,2016,06,25
231,Ireland via Jury's,"This was the second Jury's hotel we visited. Well placed in the city center, within easy walking distance of shops and restaurants. As usual drinks were a lot higher priced than I usually pay but not unexpected for Dublin. Menus identical to last one visited but basics were all there. Staff very pleasant and helpful in all areas.",5,2016,06,25
231,40th birthday trip to Dublin ,"Fast, freindly and helpful reception on arrival. Room was immaculately clean. 
Good location for exploring Dublin. 
Had a couple of drinks in the hotel bar which was clean and fairly priced.
Hadn't pre booked a breakfast due to bad experiences at other hotels but ended up paying the 10 euros on the day and having the buffet breakfast and can say that it was a truly excellent choice of well cooked food and was very good value for money.
Thank you for a lovely stay would recommend to others for sure as you get all you need from this hotel.",5,2016,06,25
231,First Vacation to Irland,"We enjoyed staying at the Jury.
The bed was comfortable, and the room was large enough we didn't feel tight.
They even had an early breakfast for our group on our departure day When we left at 6:00 AM.",4,2016,06,24
231,"Clean, good location, does the job.","Stayed here for 5 days, while partner was working in Dublin.
Spent quite a few hours here as I managed to catch cold on long haul to flight.
It's pretty central, clean, staff were very pleasant and courteous. No problems there. WiFi was ok but had to log in every day. 
Room faced central courtyard. Nothing fancy, bathroom abit tight.
Not top notch but no real complaints either. Especially after factoring in price.
",4,2016,06,24
231,Unbeatable Service!,"This is my second trip to Dublin, and this hotel was my first choice was Jury's Inn Parnell St. The manager, Christopher Morley, went above and beyond, helping me clear up a mix-up with my travel agent about the availability of a triple occupancy room. The travel agent told me there was no choice but to book a room at another hotel to accommodate the friends accompanying me. When I talked to the manager, he found a room, gave us a tutorial on the Dublin bus system, and personally escorted us to breakfast so that we received free breakfast even though we weren't yet assigned a room. The result: We checked out of the other hotel and stayed the rest of our trip at Jury's Inn. Will I stay here again? Absolutely!",5,2016,06,24
231,Jury's hotel - Parnell Street,"Nice rooms, very comfortable, nice decor & very clean!  Great location, close to everything, & transport to other locations.  Is a little pricey, but would definitely stay here again, if we got a better rate.",4,2016,06,23
231,Love this hotel!!,"Hotel great in the middle of city !! Good shopping area ! breakfast good as well me and my daughter stay here when we go to concerts! Staff very friendly and  pillows are very  nice !! 
Will be back soon",5,2016,06,23
231,great location,Best part is where it is situated. A block from the shopping area on Henry St and about one minute from O'Connell. A short walk of 10-15 minutes to Grafton. The hotel is clean and rooms are average size and appointed. No safe or fridge. We were facing the courtyard which was great because it was quiet. Overall it was pleasant and I would stay there again,4,2016,06,23
231,Anniversary stay in dublin,"My husband and I booked the hotel for our with anniversary. Staff were fantastic nothin too much trouble. Location was good. At the time of bookin we asked for a room with a nice view instead we got a disabled room overlooking flats. Breakfast was not the best we have ever had. Not impressed with having to carry hot tea and coffee through a restaurant. As I am a health and safety rep I was unimpressed especially with young children in the restaurant. It is the staff that make the hotel a big well done for excellent customer service and efficiency 
",3,2016,06,22
231,Great location for our stay,"I stayed in Jury's Inn with a friend as we were going to 3Arena for a concert. Location was great, just off O'Connell Street so close to transport links (we travelled by bus from Belfast), and had a lovely breakfast included in our room rate. Lovely clean hotel with nice reception, bar and breakfast area. Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2016,06,22
231,Wow,"Met friends in Dublin for some Christmas shopping. This is hotel is placed fantastically to walk around the city. 
Rooms were a great size, plenty of space for a family of four. 
Staff were very helpful throughout the trip. We only snacked on the restaurant but the food did look good. 
Better than your average jury's inn. ",5,2016,06,22
231,Good value for good price,"Having booked just a bit ahead I did get a nice and quiet room for a real good price. The locatioon of the hotel is great: close to center, close to airportcoach, very close to a nice shopping area. The hotel itself is comfortably inviting, clean, friendly, just very nice to stay! I would return there anytime!",5,2016,06,21
231,Dublin - Ireland,"Centrally located with easy access to everything, CBD, restaurants, public transport, hop on / off buses, airport bus transfer, shops, pubs & supermarkets. Hotel is ideally situated away from the main bustling O'Connell Street. Staff were very courteous & friendly. Excellent breakfast.",5,2016,06,20
231,Excellent customer service,"We had a fantastic stay, Great staff & customer service. They helped make my partners birthday very special and nothing was too much trouble. The location is very central with easy access to buses/trams & shops.",5,2016,06,20
231,Perfectly fine for quick city stopover ,"Nice friendly service at check in, well located in the centre just next to airport coach bus stop. Room was as expected aesthetics-wise but smelt of stale smoke despite being a non smoking room. Otherwise clean and comfortable. Perfectly fine if you're out and about in the city for most of your trip. ",4,2016,06,20
231,Ideal work stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights while attending a work conference at Croke Park.  The hotel and rooms are spotless, very comfortable, and surprisingly spacious for a city centre hotel.  Staff are very welcoming, and check-in and check-out was seamless.  Nearby parking is available at QPark Clerys for €10 a night, which is reasonable.  Breakfast was hot and plentiful, and the serving area was kept very clean.  I would highly recommend for anyone staying on business or on a weekend trip.  O'Connell St is around the corner and Grafton St can be reached on foot in 15 minutes - no transport required to access any part of the city centre.",5,2016,06,20
231,Ditmar,"The location is very convenient and central to the city centre, and surprisingly quiet.
Dinner in Dublin's restaurant was good and friendly served by the waiters.
We found prices in Dublin are meanwhile unacceptable high , while Cork was still ok.",4,2016,06,20
231,Nice Hotel,"Nice rooms, very friendly staff and nice breakfast. Close to Temple Bar area and the river Liffey.  Lots of great places to eat and drink close by.  The only downside is no parking at the hotel and had to park in a parking garage.  At the time of our visit there was quite a bit of road construction.",4,2016,06,18
231,Concert trip,Went to Dublin for a concrete the staff were very helpful a great hotel great serves great location I just thought 200 euro for 200 euro for a Wednesday night was a bit expensive we will be staying again later this year,5,2016,06,18
231,Good Hotel.,"Pros:
*Nice buffet style breakfast
*Clean room 
*Close walking distance to some things (mainly shopping), but this isn't a great area of Dublin. I would recommend the Jury's Inn by St. Patrick's Cathedral as a better location. 
*Comfortable bedding
*The rooms have A/C, which is rare in Ireland. 

Cons
*some areas of the hotel appear outdated and dirty
*VERY busy area
*Hotel is surrounded by construction
*Loud construction happening at the mall next store. The front desk clerk couldn't even speak, until there was a free moment from some sort of drilling and/or cutting that was happening. 
*Hotel parking is far away from the hotel. 
*loading and unloading upon arrival or at departure is very hard.",4,2016,06,17
231,Great hotel,"We have just returned home after 4 nights at this great hotel, which we booked through British Airways with our flight. The hotel is in a really good central location within walking distance of all the sites. Service at the hotel was really good, and the breakfast was great. We would use this hotel if we visit Dublin again. ",5,2016,06,17
231,Fantastic Location,"Recently stayed in this hotel as part of a large group and could not fault a thing.  The rooms were comfortable, all staff friendly and the buffet breakfast was great.  

The location of the hotel was great, round the corner from O'Connell Street and a 5-10 minute walk to Temple Bar.

Would definitely stay here again if I returned to Dublin.",5,2016,06,17
231,Top marks. Outstanding 3 star hotel.,"For a 3 star hotel, they do things here with a 4 star attitude. There was something I wasn't happy about but as soon as I spoke to one of the managers (Christopher) it was sorted. We stayed twice for 2 nights and were very comfortable.

I'll review the bar and restaurant seperately but in a nutshell they were both excellent too.  Really a very good choice.",4,2016,06,17
231,Great location,"I love staying here whenever I stop in Dublin. The location is excellent, not too far from the shops nor the nightlife. The only downside to this hotel is that it can be quiet expensive however given the fact this is a hotel in the centre of a major city this is to be expected.

The staff are friendly and approachable and the rooms are clean and spacious. The breakfast is of decent quality but if you don't fancy breakfast at the hotel there is a wonderful cafe literally across the road that does lovely food.

I look forward to stopping again",5,2016,06,16
231,Fantastic Location,"I have stayed in this hotel a few times and can honestly say I never had anything bad to say about it. It is the fantastic location that keeps bringing us back. Just around the corner from O Connell street. Always very clean, Staff always very professional. Usually the price of hotels can be expensive in Dublin, but on a few occasions we have got great offers on this hotel, which makes it even better. Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2016,06,16
231,Nice hotel but noisy room - waste recycling centre at the back,"Upon entering the hotel the lobby and reception looked nice and modern, the staff were very quick and efficient during check in. The room was fitted out with everything that you would expect, nothing amazing but all ok. We headed down to the bar on the second floor, great selection of drinks on tap and a good variety of seating areas. Again staff were all very helpful and friendly. 

Went to bed around Mid-night, and re-woke around 2am to a lot of noise coming from outside, only then I realized that all the council/city waste disposal centre was running a full 24hr operation. Dumper trucks, road sweepers, small pavement sweepers would all turn up and dump their waste into a large container. The noise that was keeping us awake was the reversing horn/siren from the vehicles...beep beep beep very loudly. Went back to sleep and again a lot of noise around 3am, 5am. Not impressed at all. 

Whilst having a shower in the morning there was a power cut to the room, called a friend on the same floor and their room was ok. Reported it to Reception on my way out and it was fixed when I returned.

Nice hotel fittings and fixtures, location is good for getting to shopping/tourist districts however don't go for a room on the rear of the hotel. The view out of the window is not nice at all accompanied by the noise from the waste depo.",3,2016,06,16
231,Great hotel and in a wonderful location,"I was there with my parents last year and liked it very much. The hotel is very centric, very confortable hast excellent services and good English breakfast. Highly recommendable if you go to Dublin for any age.",4,2016,06,16
231,Good modern hotel,Very nice but basically soulless modern hotel. Appears to be almost brand new. Room was spacious with good reading lights both sides of bed   Bathroom clean and modern and in-room wifi was robust. Air conditioning worked great and was quiet and there are ice machines on each floor! Location on upper O'Connell street not the best if you want to see sights or spend time at Trinity College and street level area a bit honky tonk but excellent value for the price. If looking for Dublin charm this isn't it but it's a great Marriott alternative.,4,2016,06,15
231,Fantastic Location,This is a nice hotel. It is within walking distance of most everything you will need to see in Dublin.  We walked to Trinity College to see the Book of Kells. There are many restaurants near the hotel to eat. We ate at a really good nearby called Murray's.,4,2016,06,15
231,Brilliant hotel,"Great hotel and great location!! 

The staff were all very friendly and everyone you passed said hello with a smile. The rooms are very spacious with a a double and a single bed in there. Fresh towels daily. 
The bar is reasonably priced with a good selection of drinks
We paid for breakfast each morning and it was fantastic value. Buffet style with everything you could wish for. 
We also ate in the restaurant one evening and had 2 courses for around €18 absolute bargain and the quality of food was good. 
They happily looked after our bags on check out as we had a late flight home. 
Highly recommend this hotel if staying in Dublin it is just around the corner from o'connel street. 
Definitely stay here again when we next visit Dublin.  ",5,2016,06,14
231,FANTASTIC STAY,"Perfect hotel for getting around the area, within walking distance to every where, close to buses , Pubs ,Restaurants, Museums & Shops. The room was Perfect, booked for three adults sharing plenty of space bigger than expected. The breakfast was amazing couldn't beat it. Will definatley stay here again if in Dublin.",5,2016,06,14
231,Below average for the price,Paid €240 for an average room with no fridge/no bottled water. Hotel is big and well maintained but the room was not spot clean. There were some few hairs in the bathroom... And a bathroom curtain.... Reception service was careless. Not impressed for the price.,2,2016,06,13
231,Dublin stay,"It's a nice hotel. Safe, clean and quiet. Walkable to O'Connell street. The breakfast was delicious and the staff was very friendly. I would stay here again. Hope the light rail construction gets done quickly.",4,2016,06,13
231,Great Spot,"Stayed here for three nights.  Rooms had all you need and the one we stayed was nice and quite.

Other reviews say it is a little dated which it is in some parts but hey if they want everything brand new they should stay at a more expensive newer hotel, we thought it was fine.  Is around corner from main street where hop on hop off buses are as well as Information Centre.

Had breakfast each day and this was pretty good with plenty to choose from. Did not have drink in bar but had a look and it seemed a good set up with large selection, is open until 1.30 am nightly. Has lock boxes in reception for your valuables, you have one key and the staff can only open the row your box is in and your keys opens the door, staff cannot open it by themselves.

Would stay here again as has everything you need, is close to main street .

At moment there is street works going on outside the front, ask for a back or side room.",4,2016,06,13
231,A very good three nights stay in Dublin!,"I and my family stayed in the hotel for three nights. The hotel has a very good location. The staff were very friendly. The only thing that would like to mention is the beds moved easily, not sure if the wheels can be locked. ",4,2016,06,13
231,Dublin break,"Great location , average hotel , price a bit to expensive, breakfast was ok but we had to wait for them to fill up the hot plate this was at 10am so a bit ennoyed this should never happen at any hotel you have paid up front and staff didn't seem that concerned apart from that the stay was ok but would shop about next time for a cheaper hotel as I felt it was a bit expensive for what we paid ",3,2016,06,13
231,Really good central hotel,"This hotel is recommended  to those who want to be central to the city and have to catch the ferry over to England.The staff at this hotel are very friendly and are only to willing to give advice when asked.The breakfast is of good quality and the omelets are first class. Rooms are well appointed and everything needed is there. Check it when visiting Dublin.
",5,2016,06,12
231,Good hotel at good value,"I have stayed in a good number of hotels and this is one of the best. Usually, what makes a hotel memorable is its staff and this hotel is no exception. On top of it, rooms are spacious, air-conditioned and comfortable. Location is right in the centre of town. All these came at an affordable price. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2016,06,11
231,Enjoyable stay,"Stayed for 3 nights on business and I enjoyed it.  Great food, brilliant staff and cozy rooms.  Location was spot on.  Hotel had a relaxing vibe about it which was great.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends & family.  Hope to get back again soon.",5,2016,06,10
231,Great hotel in Dublin.,"Great location for visiting Dublin.Only 10 min walk.Very comfy bed,clean room and very helpful staff,especially Szymek(Przemyslaw).Thank you :)
Only downside was that there was no safe and no fridge in the room but apart from that very good!! ",4,2016,06,10
231,Great stay in central Dublin,"Had an overnight stay here with my wife  flying from Glasgow.
We arrived early and asked if we would take a wet shower room as it was  available,good start we thought.
It got better we where both offered a complimentary drink from the bar,an offer you can't refuse.
room was ok as was the wet shower room,plenty teas n coffees in the room with proper mugs.
breakfast at 9 euro was excellent.
had a small hiccup regarding late night pizza,but was sorted out the next day with offers of free pizza which we declined,but then got offered once again a complimentary drink so all in all a nice stay.",5,2016,06,09
231,Fantastic stay as per usual.,Myself and my friend stayed here for two nights last weekend. It was my third time staying in this hotel and I will definitely return. The hotel is so central especially for keen shoppers. The staff were all very helpful and allowed us to check out late for no additional cost. Would really recommend this hotel! ,5,2016,06,09
231,Comfort,"We stayed in the Jurys hotel overnight this week. Our stay was both comfortable and affordable. our rooms very clean and plenty of hot water when needed.
The hotel is central to all amenities and shops.
I look forward to returning to Jurys next time we are in Dublin.",5,2016,06,09
231,Loved it!,"This is the first hotel I always look for when staying in Dublin. I think the location is great, the staff are always friendly and the rooms have always been clean. My friends and boyfriend also love staying here for its convenience and the staffs kindness.",5,2016,06,09
231,"Great location, excellent service, well priced","Stayed here on business recently. Had struggled to find somewhere with a good location at a decent price - Jurys on Parnell St didnt disappoint. Airport shuttlebuses stop 5 mins walk away, Temple Bar 10 mins walk. The room I had was new - very comfortable bed, efficient and quiet AC. Good breakfast. Staff outstanding - very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommended.",5,2016,06,09
231,Great city centre hotel,"Simple elegant hotel, located very close to the city centre. Quiet, clean rooms with great staff. Cheap water available at reception. Wifi. Breakfast was great. I would recommend and reuse this hotel.",5,2016,06,09
231,Great location and friendly helpful staff,"My family had a wonderful time in Dublin with this hotel as our home base. Great location!
Staff were all friendly and very helpful. If we needed anything they never hesitated to ensure we received it. We had breakfast included and it was wonderful great start to our days exploring Dublin.",4,2016,06,08
231,Great location and good value ,"We have stayed in various hotels in May and June in Dublin and we found this to be of great value. The location was excellent and very close to city centre. 

Rooms were comfortable and we would definitely go back again.

The staff were very helpful and even though it was a short stay we loved every minute. ",4,2016,06,08
231,A reasonably priced stay in a very comfortable and clean room,"I like this hotel so much I've stayed here three times for a fun trip with the girls. The rooms can sleep three or four so if more than two share it brings the price down. One thing I like is the ice machines placed throughout the corridors for guest use. It meant we had cold drinks in our room before going out. There is a Tesco opposite which is handy and some good places nearby to have breakfast like Murrays if you don't want to eat in the hotel.  It is reasonably priced and located in an accessible position to reach all the attractions. It is a short walk to city centre shops and Temple Bar. Just round the corner you can Catch one of the open topped buses. The staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms of an excellent standard. Would recommend it.",5,2016,06,07
231,Good Central Hotel,"Great hotel, good security, big rooms, decent shower. Clean & modern. Great breakfast choice €10 pp, which we thought was really good value. Close to shops & only a 15 minute walk to Temple Bar area. Nice bar area, no complaints, would return when next in Dublin. Free internet.",4,2016,06,07
231,travel in Dublin,"very nice stay for a couple of days in Dublin. Very close location to the center, the personal was friendly and help us for a quickly check out early in the morning.
unfortunatly the parkink proposed is not easy to find.  ",4,2016,06,07
231,A nice hotel,"This hotel is not super special, it's not unique, it's not a one of a kind gem.

But it's simply a good hotel! There is nothing amazing about it but that doesn't say it's bad! Rooms are light, well cleaned and with a comfy bed.

They have a breakfast buffet that is enough to get you started, bread, fruit and eggs. 

The bar is specious and serves a good selection of beers and lagers.

If you want a hotel that is a normal good hotel, you can't go wrong.

One thing... Yes there is a gym, but it's so small that you don't want to be in there with more then one person. ",4,2016,06,07
231,FRONT DESK,"Locatıon  is excellent  just in the  middle of the city , check in a bit slow   ,no arrengment for tours an attractions . Room was big bad no view ,  Breakfast was okey but very crowded 
 J uices were not fresh",4,2016,06,07
231,Good location in the heart of city ,"The hotel is nicely located but does not offer free parking space. The house keeping is very good. They changed our towels everyday. We found rooms bit smaller but then this should be expected from hotels located in the city centre. 

The buffet breakfast offered only European menu while there were guests from different nationalities. So, they can think of expanding their menu.

Staff is friendly. The hotel Can be recommended if your aim is to see the Dublin City. Hop on hop off bus is a very good way to see the Dublin city. We took two days ticket in 20 euros and it was value for money. Green bus was good.

",3,2016,06,07
231,Great hotel for all types of stays,"I regularly stay here on business, girly weekends and couples weekends. The staff are very friendly and the rooms are decorated lovely. The rewards system is a great treat for returning customers. Breakfast buffet is really worth getting It's everything you could want hot or cold you won't go hungry. You are slap bag in the city centre with plenty to see and not far to go for a good night out. ",5,2016,06,06
231,great location,"The hotel is off o'donnell street, just a few miles from downtown.The property is kept clean, the front staff is very helpful and polite.There is good free internet, a good restaurant on the premises. Across the street is a grocery store. Buses for hop on hop off are near by, as are the public transportation buses to the airport.",4,2016,06,06
231,Great location and staff!,"We stayed there right when we got into Dublin and on the way out. Great location to everything - walking and tour companies.  The staff was very helpful and friendly - it was clean and comfortable 

It was a bankers weekend so made the cost a lot more then we liked but we chose to stay there anyway and it was worth it!",5,2016,06,05
231,Jury's Inn - Dublin,"We stayed at Jury's Inn, twice when we were in Ireland.  Right from the moment we stepped into the foyer, the staff went out of their way to do everything they could to make our stay  memorable and pleasant. Its the little things that go a long way.
Our room was spotless and made up every day, we could not fault it. The bathroom was spotless and the shower was hot, which we really enjoyed after our last hotel stay. The dining room was fantastic for breakfast but at dinner even though I loved my meal, my friend couldn't finish hers as it was burnt and not very tasty. So we only tried the dining room once and went out for the rest of the time we were there. 
When we did our tour for 4 days, the hotel kept our large bags in store for us, which we thought was a lovely thing to do.
The guest relations manager   was especially welcoming and every time he saw us went out of his way to make sure we were enjoying our stay.  . Overall a great stay.",4,2016,06,05
231,3 night stay 2 nights in superior room 1 night in basic same thing.,"Don't pay extra for superior room. Same as basic room except more money. Also, construction is going on right outside hotel. Jackhammers, street barricades, etc. Otherwise, nice rooms in a great location. ",4,2016,06,04
231,Dublin trip,Lifts a nightmare but apart from that great location perfect for what we wanted would stay there again. Breakfast plenty of choice although day 1 was very busy we were lucky enough to get a table.  Overall ideal for our family break in Dublin ,4,2016,06,04
231,Great hotel and great location,"My wife and I stayed at the Jurys Inn on Parnell Street at the beginning and end of a Brendan/Trafalgar tour and then two extra nights after the tour ended.  The accommodations were excellent, and the breakfast that was included was first class.  The staff was most attentive.  The dining room was crowded for breakfast, but the wait staff really worked hard to ensure that everyone's needs were being met.  I would most definitely stay at the Jurys Inn Parnell Street on my next visit to Dublin, especially if I wanted a location north of the Liffey and close to O'Connell Street.",4,2016,06,04
231,"Nice room, somewhat overpriced, disappointing breakfast","The room was very nice but possibly a tiny bit expensive at £135 for a basic room for one night. But they did let us check in early for free and all the staff were very friendly. 

No hash browns available on a full buffet breakfast which I thought was odd but still an all round good hotel with great staff. ",4,2016,06,03
231,Over night stay for concert,Great location. Really handy into city. Parking near hotel 10 euro for 24hour stay. Very clean hotel. Friendly staff and helpful. Would recommend and will definitely stay there again when visiting Dublin. ,5,2016,06,02
231,"Great hotel, great location ","Went to Dublin for a few days to celebrate my birthday, booked the jury's inn last minute and got a fair price (considering it was the week of the Easter rising celebrations) the location is great, a minutes walk and your on o'connell street, 10 minute walk to temple bar. The room was very clean and comfortable, good shower! Staff were friendly. I have stayed in a few hotels in Dublin over the years but would def book the jury's inn again ",5,2016,06,02
231,Nice Stay,"After a week touring around the North we ended up in Dublin (4 of us) to spend a week sightseeing and visiting with family.  The hotel was perfectly located, close to all the buses, taxis plus many of the places we wanted to see were walking distance.  The hotel itself was comfortable, rooms clean and the staff very helpful.  I would consider this hotel first in my future visits. ",4,2016,06,02
231,"Nice stay, great location","stayed here for a couple of nights at the end of may as we were attending the Bruce Springsteen concert in Croke park, We arrived a little later than planned on the Thursday but the welcome was just waht we needed, friendly faces and happy to help staff, very friendly and went that little extra mile further than they needed too (Niamh especially offered us a couple complimentary drinks which was most welcome after our travelling)

Perfectly located within easy walking distance of almost everything you could want in dubline would thouroughly reccomend a stay here if heading to dublin (we will be going back theer anyway)

Only critism is not really one but it was a little pricey for the two nights, but i understand thats business and when you have Concerts and Ireland playing at home any company will try and capatalise on it, and trust me they were not the most expensive either (some other hotels were nearly 800/900 for two nights)",5,2016,06,02
231,Convenient location,We stayed here for five nights. The location is very convenient to public transport and within easy walking distance to the major sights. We booked here under a pricing special so the rate for the room was very good and included breakfast which was good. The problem with the room was that the heat and air could not be controlled so it was either freezing or a sauna. The room fronted an inner courtyard and was quiet even with the window open in order to dissipate some of the heat from room (didn't work though). There is also no refrigerator or safe in the room. The staff was very nice and efficient.,4,2016,06,02
231,"Adequate, way overpriced","This hotel was nothing spectacular, although the prices were the astronomical the weekend of the Bruce Springsteen concert. The best thing about the hotel is its central location near the spire and the GPO. The rooms are small, would benefit from a new coat of paint, and the pillows the most uncomfortable I've ever used in a hotel. The buffet breakfast was excellent and there was no wait for a table. The staff were pleasant and professional. Definitely not good value for money. I'd only stay again in a pinch.",3,2016,06,02
231,Great Location - friendly staff,I stayed with friends for 3 nights last weekend. The location is excellent - around the corner from Henry Street and a 15 minute walk from Croke Park. The staff were all really friendly and helpful. Our room was really quiet - it was difficult to believe we were in the middle of the city! The rooms are spacious and nicely furnished. I hadn't stayed in the Hotel for many years and I was really impressed and plan on staying there in future.,5,2016,06,02
231,VERY GOOD PRICE FOR A CENTRAL HOTEL,"Travelled from Leeds/ Bradford quick 50 min flight, then a speedy 20 min, taxi to the hotel which cost 20 euros.Check in was efficient quick and friendly. We requested a quiet room when booking( I booked direct with the company) this overlooked a small court yard and was indeed nice and quiet. The room was modern, extremely clean, iron and ironing board, tea/coffee, hairdryer all provided. Standard double bed but really comfortable. Shower was over the low sided bath, so easy access for the not so abled. We didn't include breakfast in our stay (lots of cafes around) but the bar was excellent, had a late night pizza and quite a few drinks in there! Dublin is a brilliant friendly place to visit for all ages and this central hotel is in walking distance of all the areas of interest. Hope to return very soon!",5,2016,06,01
231,Great location,At around £120 per room per night it seemed a bit expensive but it turned out to be reasonable value for money. Staff at reception were friendly and helpful. Room was clean and well equipped. Breakfast was buffet style with good choice of quality food. Hotel is only 10 minutes from central attractions. Would certainly consider going back.,4,2016,06,01
231,Great location,"Stayed here for two nights, very well located, close to the hop on hop off tour bus stop, and plenty of shops and restaurants. We found our room clean, comfortable and quiet. Breakfast was tasty, and plentiful. All the staff were most helpful. Good value for money in an expensive city.",4,2016,05,31
231,Would probably not recommend,"My stay at Jurys Inn Parnell Street was pretty well except for two things. One, they are environment ""friendly"" meaning in order to use electricity in your room, you have to insert your room key card in a slot near the door. Which I was not aware of, so went without for a while! Also my bathroom had not been cleaned from the previous occupant because there was black hair in the shower, and it also smelled like outhouse. Staff was very friendly and always willing to help and assist you in any way. Pretty good location, only about a 15-20 minute walk from the city centre. ",4,2016,05,31
231,50th birthday celebration,"Five of us ladies stayed at this hotel for the weekend. We loved everything about it. The breakfast was plenty to choose from ie full Irish to fruit yogurt, toast and cereal, breads cheeses & pastries. Hotel deco very modern. No complaints at all would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,05,30
231,Above and beyond expectations!,"This hotel really went above and beyond what we were expecting. We were a Canadian couple, who stayed two nights.

I thought it was expensive for the room that we got, but it seemed to be the going rate in Dublin city center. I did extensive research and the pricing for this hotel compared well to others in the downtown core. 

Right from the beginning we were impressed. We flew overnight, arriving in Dublin at 7:15 a.m. and went to the hotel to check in. I was expecting to have to leave our luggage since check in wasn't until later that afternoon but they had a room available and gave it to us for no extra charge - very nice. 

Breakfast was good, lots of selection. In Canada we have pancakes and waffles with maple syrup at most breakfast buffets so I missed that, but you can't fault the hotel as I'm aware those items are not part of a standard Europe breakfast.

We flew with Westjet and one of our luggage was delayed. We requested that they send it to the hotel and expected to pick it up from the front desk. The front desk received the luggage and even brought it up to our room without being asked.

The rooms were small, plain and simple but the beds were comfortable.

The location was great - about a 10 minute walk from Temple Bar area. It's also a block away from all the major bus stops (hop on, hop off bus, airport express, etc.)

For those worried about security, I felt very safe. They locked the front door to the hotel at night and have someone stationed there to let guests in and you needed to swipe your room key to operate the elevator. 

If I were to go back to Dublin, I would most definitely stay at another Jury's Inn.",5,2016,05,30
231,One night family trip,"We picked Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street because my partner's company usually uses it for corporate trips. After being in Cork for two nights for work related reasons, we decided to spend a night in Dublin. Unfortunately, it was very hard to find a room in Dublin for Saturday night, and this was the only hotel in a central area which had a free room. 
Although the service was good, the crazy price for an average and quite small double bedroom was not justified. 
The overall stay was nice, nothing to complain about, but by paying a crazy price I would have expected something better than the just average room we found. ",3,2016,05,30
231,Marvellous,"Catch up with friends - we usually stay in B&B's but as Dublin is dominated by the big hotels we went for this one as it's slightly away from the noisy areas. We had a family room for 3, very clean & comfortable, we had a courtyard side room which is obviously quieter than street side. Breakfast was plentiful with a wide range to suit all our tastes, 5 minute walk to the Liffey which was great for us. ",5,2016,05,30
231,Efficient,"Today this hotel stands amidst several properties all over Dublin effected by the expansion of the Luas.  When we arrived it was chaotic - BUT we were the only ones effected.  Dubliners are a most patient people they just go on with whatever it is their doing.  The hotel itself was most efficient.  The front desk staff efficient, not necessarily warm and friendly but professional.  Some greeted you with a smile most with a simple acknowledgement.  Many different accents in play, including my own.  The room on the fourth floor (467) was clean and super quiet.  The view was of the rooftop of the inner courtyard.  The furnishes and bath were dated but in good shape.  My bed needed a new mattress. We did not eat at the hotel so I won't be able to comment on anything but the price of breakfast.  Pre-ordered it was 9 Euro, 10 Euro if you walk in.  That the equal amount you would spend outside so it's not a rip-off.  The inns bar was again efficient.  No sing songs, just a few TV's playing sports.  Prices were most reasonable.  The hotel is well situated - the streets surrounding are a bit dirty with litter.  Perhaps due to all the construction.  There are many homeless in the area of O'Connell St - but they only begged they did not confront passerbys other than the rare ""can you spare some change"" requests.
The city itself seemed very crowded for May.  But restaurants waits weren't bad and we could squeeze into any pub we visited.  Dublin is a great city - you can't get lost - you can walk to most anything - if you get turned around there is always someone friendly enough to point you in the right direction.  Again due to street construction projects expect to find strangling traffic congestion - so put on your best walking shoes and enjoy.",4,2016,05,29
231,Nice centrally located hotel,"Jurys Inn Parnell is a centrally located hotel in the heart of Dublin. It is comfortable and the front desk staff are very nice and helpful. Our room was well laid out and very quiet even though we faced the main street. The room was made up promptly each day. You could walk to most popular areas very easily. There was no room safe but there were free safe deposit boxes near the front desk but you always had to have a clerk help with the keying in. The breakfasts were ample and included cheeses, different types of egg dishes and pastries. It was a good hotel for short stays.",3,2016,05,28
231,Great Place To Stay,"The hotel staff was very friendly and gave attention to the guests.  The accommodations were great with comfortable beds, spacious rooms and the hotel was conveniently located close to convenient stores, eateries, and near the tour bus sites.",5,2016,05,27
231,Good,Had a great stay at the hotel. Rooms were Tidy and very comfortable. The food was excellent and over all I had a nice stay. Would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin. Keep up the good work.,4,2016,05,27
231,Fantastic hotel,"The hotel is fantastic, clean, comfortable, right where you need to be in the city. A short walk to Temple Bar and the bus from the airport stops right across from the hotel. The breakfast has plenty of food options and they will cook things to order like veggie sausages and poached eggs at your request, just ask. Friendly staff and the cleaners do a marvellous job keeping the room well stocked, with clean towels provided everyday. This was my second visit to the hotel, having stayed in others previously. I won't be booking elsewhere now.",5,2016,05,27
231,Nice hotel - good location,"We went for St Patrick's Day weekend. The hotel was quite expensive for what it offered but we knew the price was obviously higher with it being Paddy's day. 

Clean, large room, breakfast was good with lots of options. The location is a short walk form all the bars etc. but it was nice to come away from the madness and the walk back along the river was lovely.",4,2016,05,27
231,"Great location, hen weekend success","Stayed at the hotel as part of a group of 5, aged in our 30s/40s for a hen weekend. On arrival, after an early flight, we were greeted by a friendly and helpful member of staff who allowed us to leave our luggage securely in the hotel until we could check in at 2pm. The hotel is close to everything. It is 5 minutes to a shopping arcade and an easy 10/15 minute stroll to Temple Bar. 
After checking in, we found the rooms to be spotless, quite roomy and we opened the curtains to find we looked out onto the outside terrace and seating area, although access to this was from the bar/restaurant. Plenty of staff throughout the hotel, all very welcoming and approachable. The hotel was also quiet considering there seemed to be a lot of groups staying at the same time as us. I would definitely stay here again. I am hoping to take a trip back to Dublin with my daughter and wouldn't hesitate to book this hotel again.",4,2016,05,26
231,Comfortable and welcoming,"Hotel spotless and a warm welcome to all comers. Reception staff very smart and professional and most of all, friendly. Room large and well equipped. We would certainly recommend this hotel. 
Breakfast was very well presented and delicious. Good value too.
Couldn't really recommend the dining room for evening meals because not much variety on the menu but the staff are welcoming, friendly and polite.
A great place to stay!",5,2016,05,25
231,Central Hotel,"Stayed here on business and was pleasantly surprised with my first visit to this hotel as I usually stay in one of the Hiltons. Decent room overlooking the main street, comfy bed. Breakfast was varied and excellent quality. Would recommend",4,2016,05,24
231,Disappointing,The small rooms in this hotel were very tired and outdated.  The bed mattress was rather old and lumpy causing it difficilt to sleep.  I felt it was not good value for the money. The breakfast was very nice though. ,2,2016,05,24
231,50th birthday,Would recommend this hotel to anyone great location all levels good in hotel staff excellent breakfast lots of choice to suit all. Centre of Dublin close to bars and shops and cafes. Would visit this hotel again ,5,2016,05,24
231,Comfortable.,"This was our home base for 5 nights.  The room was a nice large size, beds were comfortable and it was quiet so we could sleep.  Staff was terrific.
The only negative point was there was no in room safe.",4,2016,05,23
231,"Last Minute Booking, Satisfied Stay","We booked this room on the morning of check-in and got a great price for a downtown Dublin hotel.  The hotel was clean and updated.  Though there wasn't on-site parking, there's an unloading zone to drop off luggage and reasonable parking in a ramp nearby.  The hotel is located in walking distance from The Temple Bar, but far enough away that it's not loud all hours of the night.  I'd choose a Jurys Inn again in another city.",5,2016,05,23
231,ok but only just,the location is in a fairly dodgy part of town with some unsavoury characters roaming the local area. the room was clean but basic and the shower cubicle was far too small and the room small. Overall not good value for money,3,2016,05,23
231,great location,The hotel was in a great location but a little far to walk for dinner on the south side of the river. There is also a lot of building going on and it was a little noise from trucks beeping early in the morning. The hop on hop off bus was easy to get to. ,4,2016,05,23
231,Mrs Christine Egan ,Great place to stay in central location helpful courteous staff. Spotlessly clean. We got taxi from airport and caught Airbus around the corner when we were leaving. Not sure on parking and car access. Variety of food venues close by. Breakfasts was excellent. Highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2016,05,22
231,Recommend Jury Inn - Parnell St - Dublin,"Ive stayed at Jury Inn in Parnell St before when visiting Dublin, very central to centre of Dublin, turn right outside jury inn doors the famous O' Connell St just around the corner, also turn left from jury inn doors the famous Moore St ( as used in Mrs Brown's Boys D Movie )
Jury Inn Parnell St is very friendly staff , the rooms is clean, comfortable beds , if you have breakfast there they cater for everyone from cereal to top fried breakfast , only thing they dont do alot for Gulten free breakfast as my friend has to eat gulten free & Sometimes there prices are high but if you look about you sometimes get a good deal here 
Overall enjoyable stay & i always return to this hotel 
RECOMMEND TO VISITORS TO DUBLIN",5,2016,05,22
231,Dublin visit,"My 2nd time in Dublin but 1st in this hotel. As mentioned by other reviewers, the hotel is what you expect. Clean rooms and public areas. I missed having a shower hat as I don't want to wash my hair every time I shower. Shower head fixed to the wall so no real flexibility. Comfy beds. Quiet Room 322 at the front of the hotel facing tesco. No face flannel. Couldn't work out the heating control. It felt cold in our room and cold draught coming in the big window despite closing the vent at the top. Choice of breakfast items adequate no mushrooms though. They did cater for my daughter with some gluten free toast both mornings. Good location. 5 mins from stop no 1 for hope on hop off bus and airport bus. We ate out both nights on the southern side of the city. A decent hotel to consider for your dublin stay.",4,2016,05,22
231,No top sheet,"We stayed here at the beginning and end of our Irish Highlights Trafalgar coach trip. The room was comfortable, and I have no complaints at all. But the surprise of the entire trip was that there are no top sheets on the beds in Ireland! Be prepared to be hot because all you get is a duvet cover and a bottom sheet. There was a blanket on the shelf. Also no wash cloth or hand soap, just liquid soap dispensor. Showering was a challenge until we figured out that the tub faucet and the shower faucet work independently, no need to turn on the tub faucets. I have traveled in several countries but these two things, missing top sheet and shower fixtures were unique to Ireland.",3,2016,05,21
231,Awesome location and delivers what it promises,"We stayed at the Jurys Inn at Parnell Street for 3 days. The place has so many positives. Its close to Upper O Connell street which is the main street at the city center. Here is where all the hop on hop off city tour buses leave. Its a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Its also the stop where the airport buses make a stop. Right across the street on the other side is where the airport buses that take you  to the airport make a stop. 
O Connell street has a lot going ... Theaters, McDonalds, lots of stores, the very grand post office which is a must see for any visitor and a high street which is about 5 minutes away again from the hotel.
Right across the street from Jurys is Tesco's for any essentials.
About the hotel itself, it was very clean and neat. The check in and out was swift, the room was neat and with a double and single beds since there were 3 of us, me, my wife and our 7 year old daughter, it still had plenty of room around. The room had a much needed kettle and the coffees and teas were well stocked. If you get one of the rooms facing the inner courtyard, like we did, then there isn't much of a view. 
The staff at the hotel were very courteous and helped with things such as directions when we needed them. 
The breakfast had a decent spread of hot food and there is plenty of sitting places which helps when one is in a rush in the morning. 
The hotel gives you everything it promises and the location is certainly a bonus.
",5,2016,05,21
231,Enjoyed our stay here.,This motel was nice. There was some construction work due to renovations whilst we were there but apart from that it was fine. The restaurant downstairs was nice too. Staff were extremely friendly. At the time as I said there were renovations going on and there was only one male toilet for the restaurant but this should be resolved now.,4,2016,05,20
231,Pleasant stay.,"Good location, very central and was quiet at night. Room very nice. Had dinner in the bar which was lovely. Staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. Would definitely stay here again and have already recommended it to colleagues.",4,2016,05,20
231,Great location ,"The location is right off a bus line and walking distance from downtown. Staff was attentive, helpful. Beds were comfortable, rooms were clean and the breakfast buffet had enough variety. My only complaint was that the hostess on the weekend was somewhat rude. Otherwise, I would come back again!",4,2016,05,19
231,My 30th birthday,Stayed here for my 30th birthday it was a beautiful hotel close to everything didn't need to get a taxi any were we could just walk.. about 10 minutes from the airport.. the room are very up to date and nice and clean.. Definitely stay again..,4,2016,05,19
231,Short break Dublin,"An excellent stay staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast excellent value for money.
The bar prices were reasonable cheaper than some of the bars in Dublin. The bar meals also excellent value for money.
Had a brilliant break all amenities were near shops bars and cafes. 
Staff helpful with ordering taxis and places to visit.",4,2016,05,19
231,"Fantastic location, exceptional staff.","I had booked at the very last minute because I needed to be in Ireland for a family funeral. I traveled by myself which was particularly difficult being Disabled. This trip did somewhat restore my faith in human nature as I found that complete strangers were exceptionally kind, helping with my luggage and so-on. To an extent, the public were far more generous with help than Rai!way and Airport staff whose job it was to assist me, but perhaps that is always true?
Jurys Inn is not beautiful. It is far from characterfull. However, it is clean, well designed and incredibly well located, being only a few yards ideally from O'Connell Street and many shops, pubs, eateries and all the history of Dublin. In my opinion, one of the best factors, apart from its proximity to the city centre is the security of this hotel. In order to operate the lift or get into the lavatories it is necessary to use your room key card. This of course means that there are essentially no people wandering around who are not staff or residents of the Hotel. This did make me feel more secure, especially as I was travelling alone.
The rooms are large and airy. There was a double and a single bed in my ensuite room. Free Wi-Fi was very handy, as were the drink making facilities. Room service is readily available and I found all the staff to be very kind and helpful. 
I would recommend the bar, which is very well stocked, with knowledgeable and very helpful staff. I did order food one evening which I wouldn't recommend though. Perhaps it was my choice of nacho's? It appeared to be topped with mozzarella which had been transformed into inedible rubber by microwaving. Talk about chewing every mouthful fifty times! Not pleasant. My pudding was utterly delicious though, so perhaps the food is a little bit and miss.mi didn't eat in their restaurant, except that I'd opted to pay extra for the buffet breakfast. 
My first morning I alone transferring one item at a time to my table as I need to use crutches nto walk. I did not ask for any help. On my last morning, I asked the young man on the desk for help, but before he could get to me a very kind young girl called Sascha offered her services. She was incredibly sweet and deserves particular mention.
Someone on another table said that she might take her demonstrably rock hard bagel out with her in case there was need of a weapon!  I must admit, the croissants which I attempted on my first morning were equally solid. The cooked breakfast options did look very good but I never eat that sort of thing so I cannot say how they tasted.  To me, tea always tastes fantastic in Dublin. May be something about the quality of the water perhaps? I know that I can never drink enough tea when I go there.
Over my first night the majority of my fellow guests appeared to be a coach party of older German tourists who were clearly doing a tour of Ireland. Later in the stay, my companions were mostly American and Australian tourists, and a few English and Irish visitors. Being five stories tall Jurys Inn is quite a large hotel, which I would thoroughly recommend to anyone wanting a central place from which to explore the wonderful city of Dublin.",4,2016,05,18
231,weekend stay,"Fantastic central location , superb accommodation and amazing selection and choice at breakfast ! Staff were extremely helpful at reception and we lived the ice dispensers on each floor , very handy !!!Overall a very impressive hotel stay !",5,2016,05,18
231,A pleasant stay.,"We booked this after researching online for a central, mid priced hotel. Check in was swift and simple and our room was pleasant with a view to the street facing Tesco. 

The hotel is in a good location with plenty of shops and pubs/restaurants nearby and is just around the corner from O'Connell Street where there are plenty of hop on hop off tour buses. A walk further up O'Connell street takes you across the Liffey to the Temple Bar area. 

Our stay included breakfast and we found the food very good and provided excellent choice. We also enjoyed drinks in the hotel bar which is very pleasant and found prices comparable to the other places in Dublin. 

Overall a good stay my only negative being the cost per night is on the expensive side I've stayed in equally good and same quality Premier Inns for less than half the price.",4,2016,05,17
231,Great location,"A good hotel in great location, we stopped  for three nights bed and breakfast. I had no complaints at all during our stay.you are only a stones through away from occonnell street which runs down to the river which makes it easy to navigate around Dublin.",5,2016,05,17
231,Wonderful Location and Great Staff,The location of this hotel can't be beat.  We were literally able to walk to everything that we wanted to do.  We did the Hop on/Hop off bus and the pick up was right around the corner as well as the tour to the countryside.  The staff was awesome.  We came in early and they were able to get us a room well before check in time.  They assisted us in picking a tour and then helped us arrange it.  There is shopping right around the corner (grocery store and malls as well as a farmers market).  There were many wonderful restaurants close by.  The only time we used a cab was to and from the airport.  I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2016,05,17
231,"Nice hotel, very central","I stayed here for a course in the hotel, the room was very comfortable and the staff were very friendly, almost seemed like we had the hotel to ourselves. During the course the staff brought tea and coffee at regular intervals and the little biscuits were very welcome. Not a great location at night, seems a very rough area but overall a great hotel. ",4,2016,05,16
231,Great Hotel staff,"My fiancé and I stayed at Jurys inn on Parnell st. Dublin Ireland. Staff service is outstanding, rooms are clean, tidy, and the breakfast package is a must. Our room faced the rear of the building where garbage trucks start working at 5-6 am this woke us up every morning and the bed wasnt very comfortable. Overall the price and location cant be beat.",4,2016,05,16
231,Great hotel in Central Dublin,"Stayed at the Jurys inn Parnell St. during a 1-day layover in Dublin. This is a great location in Central Dublin, right next to the central shopping district and only a moderate walk to the Temple Bar and St Stephen's Green areas. It's outside of the bar area so it's quiet at night. The Inn itself was very clean, the staff was very polite and accommodating. One caution, there was a tour bus departing in the morning, so the breakfast cafe had about 40 people waiting to eat when they opened at 7:00. Needless to say, there were very long lines at the hostess table and for the food buffet. Travelers with early flights had problems. Guests should plan for this delay until JI fixes this. But overall I had a great stay. JI will be my new go-to hotel for my future Dublin stays.

BTW, this was a last minute booking. Usually I book through the hotel websites, but the trip advisor gave me a better rate. ",5,2016,05,16
231,Convenient Location,"The hotel is easy to locate, and is in a good locations with plenty of shops, cafes, supermarkets etc. It is a well-kept hotel. The room was comfortable, reception desk was welcoming, and the bathroom stocked with amenities. The hair-dryer is a god-send. I rate cleanliness a 4/5 only because there was a layer of dusk on the desk in the room. The other stuff like bedsheets, towels etc were all clean. The reception desk was also helpful with making reservations for dinners, special tours and shows.
All in, a good experience.
We found the room rate to be a tad pricey though, but it could have been a matter of how hotel rooms are being priced all across Dublin.",4,2016,05,16
231,Good location but not very clean rooms.,Good location but not worth the extra money. I was expecting a clean hotel but found one that needed to clean the carpets and a fresh coat of paint would go along way. I wouldn't stay here again......,2,2016,05,16
231,OK stay,"Just stayed 2 nights at this hotel.  Booked because of the great reviews on trip advisor but I was surprised that the reviews were so good after staying there - it was just ok to me.

Pros:  location was great - near o'connell street and a 10 min walk to temple bar, many restaurants/shops nearby, grocery store across street.  Airport bus stop is 5 min from hotel.  Helpful staff.  Clean rooms.

Cons:  room felt very dated even though I read it was recently renovated.  Beds and pillows were hard.  No safe in room - there are boxes in the lobby but are very inconvenient (requires staff help, which can take a while if there is a line at the front desk, $250 Euro fee if you lose the key).",3,2016,05,15
231,Ideal location,"The hotel was situated in a prime spot for the weekend in Dublin.  The room was small but had everything that we needed in it, was quite difficult to get the temperature right from the air con but that was the only issue really. Bed was comfortable Breakfast was lovely and a good selection.  The evening meal in the grill was great and excellent value for money.",4,2016,05,15
231,Staff shouldn't make assumptions ,"So I approached reception and showed them my phone that has the poking reference number and said I had a double room booked. Immediately the girl at the desk asked was it room with 2 beds I required? There is a noticeable age difference between myself and my husband and we felt quite offended at being judged. Although having experienced this type of reaction before I passed it off although my husband was more disgruntled. I work in hotels and in a situation such as this would have allowed the guest go to the room and call reception if they needed 2 beds as opposed to 1. 
Second assumption was breakfast. We were asked our room number as we entered the restaurant the following morning but given no instruction as to how breakfast service operated. So quite quickly we could see it was self service but self service to the extreme. Nothing in the tables except milk and sugar. We were up and down to the table seeking cutlery, napkins, toast, tea and coffee. It would be nice to have a certain amount of table service, after all that's what waiting staff are for, waiting on tables. The orange juice was really warm, the self service toaster had the usual problems, once wasn't enough and twice was going to set the fire alarms off.
Great location but lacking in customer service and assumptions about our marital status and knowledge of breakfast shouldn't be assumed. ",3,2016,05,14
231,Short break in dublin,Great location n although lots of roadworks all over Dublin in our room 215 very peaceful and felt we had hotel to ourselves. Complimentary biscuits with tea and coffee facilities would have made it perfect. Would return if in Dublin.,4,2016,05,13

231,Comfortable,"Nice staff,pleasant surroundings,a bit noisy early morning,plus road works all day,central for the shops,paid extra for a superior room to make it that little bit special,felt disapointed,as the room seemed basic,compared to previous hotels we have stayed in the past.",3,2016,05,12
231,"Fantastic Hotel ""Amazing Staff""  High quality of service ...","On my recent stay at jury's I found it to be a very welcoming experience,  the hotel gives  a very good first impresson from the minute you enter your greeted by helpful reception staff along with the management are very helpful. . I found my room to meet all my requirements  clean tidy and very relaxing. . Great staff the bar friendly and welcoming but I have to say what really stood out to me was my experience in the restaurant , I was greeted by José in the restrauant reception with a beautiful smile wich instantly left me refreshed and relaxed... I can't praise this man highly enough for his excellent customer care .. I was fortunate to have him waiting on my tabe I found him to have great knowelege of the menu and wine list he guided me to make excellent dining choices. . José left a very big impression, with his capable serving skills and his natural courtesy and charming apperance I have to say is outstanding  . I'm sure I'm not alone in saying that he is a fantastic member of the jurys team .  On a final note I would highly recommended  jurys inn.. much apprication and thanks to José for the high quality of professional service and the time he dedicates to all the guest  ....",5,2016,05,11

231,Dublin Trip,"Stayed here for two nights. Ideal location for all Dublin attractions and great value for money city centre hotel. Airport bus drop off/collect just a few minutes walk away on O,Connell Street. Plenty of places to eat nearby and a supermarket opposite. The staff were very friendly from the moment you arrived you felt welcome, which was a nice touch. The room was quite large as city centre hotel rooms tend to be on the small side , but most importantly was clean and comfy. The only gripe really was you could clearly hear people talking in the next room ..very thin walls !!!!  Overall nice stay.",4,2016,05,11
231,Nice but basic for price,"Great location, clean and modern. Bathtub was on the small side, spilled over right away. No ice-bucket either, had to bring it in a plastic bag! Room had all the things you would expect and was comfortable. Iron and ironing board was handy to have.",4,2016,05,11
231,Great hotel in Dublin,"I stayed in this hotel a few days ago and I found it very comfortable and in a very central position, so you can go and visit the centre without taking bus.
 Staff is very kind and friendly.
Rooms are enough spacious and very clean and the bed is so comfortable.
It has been a very amazing stay!",5,2016,05,10
231,Visit Dublin,"Perfect location in the city center, close to the Temple Bar district. Very  friendly and helpful stuff.

Cleanliness was excellent throughout the whole hotel.
Very good value for money. 
Perfect location.
Breakfast was to die for ! :)
I recommend this hotel and will be re booking on my next stay in Dublin.",5,2016,05,09
231,weekend break,Good rooms and is base to explore the city from. The food was of a good standard too although there  are plenty of excellent restaurants bars close by. The only drawback was parking was a bit of a hike away and the traffic at present is chaotic due to the one way system while the tram lines are being built.,4,2016,05,08
231,Great location,"My husband and myself spent 2 nights at this hotel. The hotel staff were very welcoming on arrival and check in was quick. Our room on the 4th floor over looked the main street but there was no noise at all even though they are fitting tram lines outside. The room was modern and clean and the bed was really comfortable. We ate breakfast one morning which had everything you could possibly want for breakfast, and it was delicious. My husband is coeliac and on arrival they made sure that he was given gluten free toast/bread. The location for shopping is ideal the nearest shopping centre is about 150 metres and about 5 minute walk to the main shopping street. If your looking to visit the bars and restaurants of temple bar it's around a 10 minute walk. All in all great hotel in a great location. We would definitely stay here again",4,2016,05,05
231,Comfortable stay!,"We stayed one night. It was a comfortable room - supplied with the usual amenities of shower gel, shampoo- conditioner mixed, hair dryer and tea- coffee making facilities. Free wifi was available in the room. Breakfast at hotel was buffet style - enjoyed the supply of fruits and hot entrees. 
We liked the location - there were a number of groceries or supermarkets just across or along the Parnell street. Just one street down there was a number of shops and food choices. We got our mobile SIM card from three for 20 euros - unlimited data plan.
Take note of the shopping hours on different days - Sundays had shorter hours from 12 to 6pm.",4,2016,05,04
231,"Nice hotel, great location","Nice hotel situated just off O'Connell st and only a 5min walk from the GPO. If coming from the airport the express bus drops you off minutes from the hotel and it's easy getting about the city as the hop on hop off buses, taxis & city buses are all within walking distance from the hotel. Its also only a 15min walk to the popular Temple bar area across the river Liffey. The bar/restaurant area on the 2nd floor is nice too. If I was to go back to Dublin I would consider staying here again.",4,2016,05,04
231,Jurys Inn Parnell Street - Dublin,"Came away for a friends stag weekend, this hotel was super clean, super breakfasts (we ate out for evening meals) friendly staff great quality alcoholic beverages and we tried most of the beers and lagers on tap. I have marked the Value as average as there was two of us sharing a room and we paid 190 Euro each for two nights stay - and I am used to Premier Inn prices, and this was better quality accommodation, PLUS top class breakfasts (buffet style).",5,2016,05,04
231,AMAZING STAFF! ,"Today I attended a course at this hotel, and we were provided with food during our lunch. (Which was amazing I might add!) I would like to let you know that one of your staff, I believe her name was Derbhla, was one of the most kind, helpful people I have ever come across. I am vegetarian myself and had some queries about the food, and Derbhla was straight to her feet to find out of the food was suitable. Then she offered me different vegetarian options for my lunch, and wouldn't leave until she knew I was fully taken care of. The best customer service I have come across. Thank her from me please! ",5,2016,05,04
231,friendly and efficient,"Great location and helpful staff.  It was a long walk to our room, but not a big issue.  My son really liked the fruity drink available in the lobby.  That was unique.  We were able to store our luggage in the lobby after check out for a few hours.  That was helpful and very secure",5,2016,05,04
231,Great location,"Very good location. Parked up the car for €10 per day and we were able to walk to anywhere we wanted to go to around the city centre. The hotel was very clean with tea/coffee facilities, ironing facilities and a hairdryer. Bathroom was spotless. Nice shower and complimentary toiletries.",5,2016,05,04
231,Best Value Hotel,Lovely Little Gem of a Hotel . Situated on Parnell Street.   Friendly staff.  Only downfall ...  only 2 staff on Reception which resulted standing a queue for over 20 minutes to check in...  High recommend hotel restaurant.   Well worth the money...,5,2016,05,03
231,Good location but over priced,"Location great, staff (mostly) nice and friendly. Check in quick and efficient. Room (superior) really small and bed really uncomfortable. Breakfast really really good, great selection and good value. Overall propbadly would only stay here again if other hotelside were booked. ",3,2016,05,03
231,Couple stay for 1 night,"Lovely hotel, very clean, good location. We ordered room service was reasonable price and was amazing food. Staff were really helpful on where's best to go and very friendly. Would 100% stay her again and recommend to friends and family! ",5,2016,05,03
231,"Friendly staff, clean room, good breakfast","Does the job for a business trip - the bedroom was comfortable, good facilities within the room and a a clean bathroom. Check in and out was easy and everything that you could want from a breakfast. No complaints other than perhaps the price.",4,2016,05,03
231,Jurys Inn saved the day!,"We arrived in Dublin around 11pm and got to our pre-booked B&B to find out they had double-booked and tried to put us on airbeds! We rang up Jurys Inn and they managed to sort us a room even though we didn't arrive until just after midnight. The staff were fantastic, the hotel was clean & modern and the beds super comfy. The location was fantastic, just 10 minutes walk to Temple Bar. This hotel saved our weekend!",5,2016,05,03
231,Very pleasant stay,"We spent a very pleasant stay in this hotel.
The rooms are big enough but we had not a nice view at all. It is the only bad point. They are many good points : the wifi which is really good, a very good place. We were able to visit all Dublin by foot because the hotel is situated in the center, very close from the airport shuttle. We appreciated free coffee and tea in the room.
I recommand it. I will return in it for my next stay in Dublin.",4,2016,05,03
231,I definitely recommend this hotel!,"My friend and I stayed for 4 nights in this hotel. Location is top, the staff was very friendly and helpful, the room (standard twin room) was also a nice and clean, and it was the same for the bathroom which was big, compared to some other hotels in other cities about the same price category, and clean. 
Breakfast is also very good and definitely worth its money.

However there are also some negative points. 
The half negative point: my friend couldn't sleep that well because we had a room that faces the main street (if you have a light sleep, I suggest to bring some earplugs). 

I have to say that I slept very well, except, and now I come to the really negative point, when some other guests came back to the hotel at around 2 to 3 am at night. Just to explain, this is not really the hotel's fault and it wouldn't have been a problem if those people would have been less noisy... They were talking very loudly in the corridor for at least 20 minutes to each other... Normally, when I sleep, nothing can wake me up that easily, but even I woke up from their noise...

I don't want to end this review on a negative note. Overall, I was very satisfied and I still recommend this hotel to everyone, as the rest is really very very good.",4,2016,05,03
231,Great hotel and very helpful staff.,"We stayed in this hotel for a week. It is situated a few minutes walk north of the river Liffey. The neighbourhood does look a bit worn, but the hotel is just about perfect. Most sights in Dublin are within easy walking distance.

The staff is friendly and extremely helpful. The food in the restaurant is good, but we found the menu in the bar more interesting. We actually ate in the bar more often than we did in the restaurant.

Two shopping centers within a couple of minutes walking distance and a supermarket just across the street all came in handy. So too did a nice sportsbar (reviewed elsewhere) further down the same street.",5,2016,05,01
231,Third visit,"Enjoyed my third visit here this April, I've previously stayed in the same hotel in 2013 and 2015. We arrived several hours early for our three-night stay and we were given access to one of our rooms, which was brilliant as we could drop off our bags and freshen up before going out for the day. From experience if you can't have early access to your room, you can check your bags in at reception.  

This hotel is in a GREAT location for a tourist visit to Dublin, from Dublin Airport get a number 16 bus and it will drop you at O'Connell Street just across the road from the hotel, likewise when you're returning to the airport the bus stop back is just 2 mins away around the corner (bus fare is currently Euro 3.30 each way - have correct change!). Close by is also the GPO and Garden of Remembrance, walk to the end of O'Connell Street turn right and then cross the Ha'Penny Bridge and you'll arrive at Temple Bar. Running alongside the hotel is Moore Street (an historic street in terms of the Easter Rising and also a market street selling fresh fruit/veg), walk along this and you'll reach a shopping centre and shopping area with lots of high street shops. Below the hotel is also a Lidl and opposite a Tesco - great if you need to stock up on snacks. The Guinness Brewery and Jameson's distillery are a fair way away, we've always walked it to both of them (they're in different areas) but tourists may want to get on one of those hop-on-hop-off sightseeing buses if you're not that mobile. If you're going up to Glasnevin you can also get a bus on O'Connell Street or Parnell Street which will drop you opposite the cemetery. 

The hotel rooms are clean and to a good standard, we stayed on the 2nd floor this time and previously we've stayed on the 3rd. Flat screen tv. kettle, good supply of tea/coffee, iron, hairdryer and free WiFi - what more do you need? We ate in the hotel on the second night and service and food was great, my dad really enjoyed the Steak and Guinness pie and steamed kale. 

On our third night it was the Irish Census and we received a letter from the hotel providing all necessary information on it - I guess there is now an historic record of our stay! Will definitely be visiting Jury's Inn (Parnell Street) again for our next Dublin trip.",4,2016,05,01
231,Good location,"Stayed here for three nights with my husband,the staff were helpful ,breakfast was good,hotel clean tje only thing that let it down for  was the  hard pillows which we both found very uncomfortable.It was handy to catch the airport express as it stops just a few minutes walk away in oconnell street.",4,2016,05,01
231,Great location,"Hotel is in great location and easy to find. 

We flew to Dublin and got the bus to the centre, from there it was walkable. 

Rooms were clean, modern and comfy. 

Didn't eat or drink here so can't comment on that. 

For price and location we would definitely go back when we revisit Dublin. ",4,2016,04,30
231,"Nice Hotel, good located, friendly staff!","The Hotel is only 2 Minutes from Henry Street with lots of Shops, 10 Minutes to the Temple Bar with Bars and Restaurants, about 15 Minutes to the old jameson distillery and it was also very easy to geht there with the Airlink (Airport Bus)!",4,2016,04,29
231,Such a welcoming atmosphere,"Really enjoyed my stay, originally one of the cards was faulty but staff happily amended the problem in no time at all. They even provided us with extra towels and pillows for an unexpected guest. The only downside was that our kettle was fault but room service was available so we did not go without a morning cuppa!",5,2016,04,28
231,Fantastic hotel in a great location,"Stayed here for 2 nights with my other half. Everything was fantastic. Great bar, good nights sleep and lovely breakfast. Good central location. We arrived early but were able to check straight into room. ",5,2016,04,28
231,value for money,"overall very satisfactory, except the fact that the room was ready one hour later than proposed and was not cleaned before 3:30pm on the second day of our stay (maybe some cleaning staff absent or missing??)",4,2016,04,28
231,Parking tricky!,Staying here en route from Portrush to County Clare. Car parking is a nightmare to find (not helped by major roadworks right outside the hotel) and quite a walk from the hotel. Room comfortable and staff friendly enough but we'd recommend going out to eat!,3,2016,04,28
231,Great value for the $,"We recently traveled to Ireland and stayed in Dublin for a few days before heading to see our family.  We stayed at Jurys Inn Parnell Street.  We found the location great as it was close to shopping and many attractions.  Both our bedroom and bathroom were clean.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The buffet breakfast is good and has the typical breakfast foods you's expect (cereals, fruit, eggs, sausage, bacon, etc..).  We did have dinner in the hotel's restaurant a couple of nights the food was good; however, coming to Ireland I would expect to find more Irish fare on the menu (where was the shepard's pie or bangers and mash).  It would also be nice to have some sandwiches available as after a day of sight seeing and shopping a heavy meal is just too much.  ",5,2016,04,27
231,Great Hotel,"My wife and I were on vacation to Ireland from the States and we went to the wrong Jury's Inn upon arrival to Dublin.  The reception staff was very helpful in directing us to the correct one.  The Jurys Inn on Parnell was very nice; rooms very clean, bathrooms as well.  The free WiFi was good although a tad slow but not a big deal.  Would certainly recommend to anyone looking for a hotel close to everything in Dublin.  Make reservations for the Jameson distillery tour if you want to do it!",5,2016,04,27
231,Good Hotel,"Visited for business recently and stayed one night. The staff were polite although not particularly welcoming or friendly. The bedroom was of a good quality and was clean and tidy. There was no problem with noise and I slept very well. 

I didn't have breakfast or dinner so can't comment on the food. The location is very good for Dublin's bars and nightlife",4,2016,04,26
231,1st stop in ireland,Arriving in Ireland for the first time a nervous mess - the staff were welcoming and helpful with my bags for storage and put me in for a early check in. The staff in the whole hotel in all areas were pleasant and friendly! The room was beautiful. Clean nice linen. Location is perfect and I found it easy to navigate around the city from Parnell street! Would definitely stay again. ,5,2016,04,26
231,Excellent great access to city,"Jury inn we stayed in before it is clean comfortable , the Dublin jury's was very friendly you felt proud to be Irish that we are friendly the thing was that silly guest that wakened all floor 3 I surpose what can you do about that ",4,2016,04,26
231,Decent accommodation in good location,"Stayed here on 22nd & 23rd April 2016 with my husband.  Check in & check out were very efficient.  There is no hotel car park but there is a special rate of €10.00 for overnight parking at the nearby Q Park on Cathal Brugha Street (Clery's Car Park). There is a small area in front of the hotel to pull into to drop off luggage, if needed.  Breakfast was chaotic to say the least and I know that when a hotel is busy this is likely to be the case but the fact that tables weren't allocated to you, on arrival (on Saturday morning) meant that some clients ended up eating in the Bar.  Thankfully, this didn't happen on Sunday morning!  The selection of food was reasonable but the hot buffet was lukewarm at best.  Also, the coffee machine was very slow dispensing which led to massive queues at an already busy time.   We found the bed to be very firm and the pillows were very uncomfortable - even the 'softer option' that was in the wardrobe.  Clean rooms, modern hotel, friendly staff, good location.  We would stay here again but it would depend on the price.",4,2016,04,26
231,Great,"No complaints at all. Check in was fast and friendly, all rooms were spacious and clean. Had everything you needed. Great location to Temple Bar and other areas. Bar was nice. Breakfast was plenty and good variety and all staff friendly and courteous. Will definitely recommend.",5,2016,04,26
231,An excellent experience,"We stay in Jurys Parnell St, Dublin roughly eight to ten times a year for two to three nights at the time.  We always look forward to these trips and find the whole experience most enjoyable   The location is just great - access to all city centre locations  We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone as the staff are excellent, rooms clean and comfortable.  We always feel safe in this hotel.",5,2016,04,26
231,Hotel ,"This hotel was very good with good food. 
Was looking forward to a fish n chip meal at the restaurant opposite but unfortunately,  it had a major fire in March so was still closed.
If you buy tickets to visit the Jameson Distillery from the local touring office,  don't expect to be allowed in on the same day. It was fully booked so had to return the next morning for the 45 min tour. ",4,2016,04,25
231,Brilliant hotel in a great location,Booked early. Good rates. Very comfortable room. Delicious breakfast with amazing variety of food. Hotel just off main thoroughfare near friendly pubs with great music over the weekend. Shopping in Dublin is excellent. Baggage storage after checking out which is a really good service.,5,2016,04,25
231,lovely hotel with excellent service and staff,This hotel is round the corner from O'Connell street and is very handy for all buses and shopping.  It is beautifully decorated and is spotlessly clean. The staff were very attentive and pleasant.  We will not hesitate to make our booking there on our next trip to Dublin.,5,2016,04,25
231,"Nice clean hotel, good location","Very clean hotel, staff really friendly just 1 lady on breakfast was a bit rude!! 
Booked it online to pay on arrival, price has gone up when we arrived by £25 pp per night!! 
Stayed at the front of the hotel lovely room but work was being done on the installation of the tram lines.... Don't expect a lie in was woken at around 8am by the very noisy workmen!! So not the best place to stay after a night around temple bar. 
Great location!! Just a bit on the expensive side for what it is.",3,2016,04,25
231,Lovely hotel ,"Great location 2 minute walk to o'connell street and about 15 minute walk to temple bar. Lovely helpful staff, rooms were clean with a comfortable bed and good t.v. Would defiantly recommend and we will be returning on our next visit to Dublin! ",5,2016,04,25
231,First time in dublin😀,"Travelled to Ireland and stayed at Jury's Inn, Parnell st. Comfortable, clean hotel in a great location. Very central to O'Connell street. Used the 24 hour sightseeing tour bus to get around Dublin which was great. Also took local bus from airport to hotel which saved me a vast amount of money as it was obviously much cheaper than a taxi. Going to the Guinness storehouse is a must!!! Spent the whole day there and had a fab time. Can't recommend it enough.

All in all a great 3 day break from London. Would recommend the hotel and city",4,2016,04,25
231,"Clean, Tidy and close to O'connell Street","The hotel is more or less what you would expect from a city centre Jury's.
It's not five star, but it is VERY nice.
It's Clean, with well apportioned and appointed rooms with En-suites etc. 
The self-service buffet breakfast is good value and with (again) everything you expect - with the bonus of White Pudding! 
The biggest plus for this hotel, is that it is two minutes to the top of O'Connell Street, and a short walk therefore to Grafton Street, or the Taxi ranks are pretty much as you turn the corner.
The buses from the airport stop in on O'Connell Street so again its no hassle to just jump on one of the buses/coaches at the Airport and your there in less than half an hour.
Staff were very helpful.
There is the option of leaving luggage on departure day to collect later.

My only negative came from an encounter with the night time security guard.
I get his job is never going to be the most pleasant, and he probably has to deal with a lot of issues through the night. 
However his surly and growly nature was a bit too much aggression for my liking - and that was at the start of the night, I wouldn't have like to bump into him later on in that mood.",4,2016,04,25
231,Week stay,Really nice hotel . The staff are ready nice and the please is very clean . The food was well cooked and quick . The bar is nice and not as expensive as some pubs around the area . The only small complaint is the pints are not good especially the Guinness . There is to much detergent used when cleaning the glasses . A good pint will have some rings left all the way down the glass . This would be a 10 out of 10 if some pride was taken in the quality of pints ,4,2016,04,25
231,Working in central Dublin,"Ideal site if you're working in central Dublin, everything is close by and the Luas, Bus and trains are all easily accessible. It is a little expensive but the rooms are comfortable enough and the facilities are fine.
Staff are always excellent and friendly.",4,2016,04,25
231,Another wonderful stay,"This was our second visit to this hotel and we were not disappointed.  It is in an ideal location for exploring Dublin and getting to and from the airport.  One of its great selling points is the warmth and friendliness of all the staff, without exception.  We asked for a room close to where we were last year and got it.  It was even better value for money as the deal included breakfast.  We had dinner a couple of times at the hotel and the food was excellent.  The room was comfortable, clean and very quiet.  Thank you all once again.",5,2016,04,25
231,Dublin city centre,"Jury's inn Parnell street is a large hotel, with nice bar and restaurant. Our room was dark, and the window faced an inner courtyard. No sheer curtains so it felt overlooked when the blackout curtains were open.  The location was central but a very rough part of the city. Each time we left the hotel we had to avoid people much the worse for wear. Not just a few people getting merry on a stag do. But people with some serious problems. I won't be staying in this part of dublin again.",2,2016,04,25
231,"Great location, great value","Great hotel, very well located by Parnell square, close to Air Bus stop. Excellent value for money. Good breakfast, lively well priced bar. Within walking distance of all sights. Spacious well presented rooms, ideal for families. Recommended.",4,2016,04,24
231,Good location and very helpful staff,"We stayed here for a couple of nights. The hotel is an easy walk to Temple Bar, Guiness Storehouse etc. Self service cooked breakfast was fine. Ask for a room facing the courtyard if you want quiet. My wife was ill overnight on our second night ( bad crab at the Church restaurant) and the staff were very helpful the next day.",4,2016,04,23
231,Good base,"This hotel is well located to get to the centre of things in Dublin and is just off O'Connell Street.
Usual Jurys standard with decent sized rooms though bedroom a little tired and disappointingly only one chair between two, probably due to the additional bed in the room. Bath was also one of those weird shallow hotel ones which is like bathing in a shower tray-no possibility of a long leisurely soak.
Ate in restaurant and perhaps through not choosing well had a very disappointing meal though on complaint the issues were addressed and dealt with immediately.",3,2016,04,23
231,Top Location Hotel,"Stopped here for a weekend for 2 nights. Short walk from the 747 airport link bus stop. Lovely reception staff who gave us maps of how to access all the local site seeing places. Room was clean however the bed and pillows were very uncomfortable and we found it very hard to get a proper nights sleep. However there was no noise from the room we stopped in. 
Great location to almost everything about 2/3 minutes walk to oconnell street and about 10 minutes to Temple Bar. We didn't eat breakfast so can't comment on this but there was plenty of places to eat down the road the hotel was on.
Would use this hotel if we came to Dublin again mainly for the its great location.",4,2016,04,23
231,Great value - perfect location ,My girlfriend and I stayed for three night in march. The no thrills hotel was within 10 minutes walk of temple bar and a perfect location. Clean and tidy. Staff were great. We didn't eat so I cannot comment on the catering. We arrived early in Dublin so put our bags in the hotels secure store before heading out to explore- later we came back and checked in without any problems. Great value for the price we paid! ,5,2016,04,23
231,Perfect location,"The accommodation was excellent and the hotel was situated in a perfect city centre location. The staff were courteous and helpful, especially in the restaurant. Superb breakfast selection. I would highly recommend Jurys Inn Parnell Street.",5,2016,04,22
231,family of four two night stay,Had a decent experience here. The location is close to most everything but it feels like it's not the best part of dublin. Course all of Dublin felt that way. The hotel is very nice overall. Breakfast is very good and worth the extra money. The beds were not very comfortable though for two days it worked. Finally parking is off site a short walk but difficult to drive to from the hotel. Be sure to have the hotel punch your ticket. Parking reduces from 35 euro to just 10.,4,2016,04,21
231,Average Hotel,We chose to stay here because Jury's is a reputable hotel but we were disappointed with what we got for the price. The room was tiny and little room to move a family of 4 around! The staff were very friendly and the place was clean. It was right in the town so very handy to walk everywhere,3,2016,04,21
231,Good weekend,"Stayed here for 4 nights, hotel short walk from 747 airport link bus stops. Nice reception area and staff welcoming. Our room was on the 3rd floor and faced onto the side street, room was clean, comfortable, tv & wifi in room worked well. Breakfast is buffet with lots of choices (cooked breakfast, cereal, fruit, toast etc), we had a night cap in the bar which a bit more expensive than in a local bar. There are no safes in the rooms but there are safety deposit boxes in the reception area which we used. Occupants in the next room on our first night which was a Saturday were a bit noisy when they came back after their night out  but we had no issues any other night.  Hotel ideally situated a few pubs & restaurants nearby. 2 minute walk onto O'Connell St and about 10 minute walk to Temple Bar, Dublin Castle etc. We had a good stay here and would come back if we visit Dublin again. Only one small negative point to this hotel is the residents smoking at the front entrance.",4,2016,04,21
231,what a terrible hotel,"Dinner on night one was cold.   The mushy peas were dried out and crusty.
Breakfast day 1 - all the cooked food was cold
Breakfast day 2 - ditto
Complimentary dinner offered to compensate after my complain.  Even that was dried out and cold.  All food was char grilled, no alternative.  Restaurant and bar serving the same meals at the same prices.
Room had no chairs, no clock meaning I had to get up during the night in the dark and go into the bathroom where I could put on the light without disturbing my husband to check on my small watch whether it was time to get up.  The shower was at ceiling height and over the bath and inflexible.  I am 70 years of age and had to climb over a knee height bath side to get into the shower.  The air conditioning was not operating properly and the bedroom and hotel in general were very cold.  There is no car parking and they have an arrangement with another venue 15 minutes walk away and at an extra ten euros per day charge",1,2016,04,21
231,Very Nice Hotel,"Friendly staff. Nice, clean and comfortable room. 
Very good location, off of O'Connell Street and a stones throw from Temple Bar.
Breakfast was nice, buffet fair, and not a bad way to start the day. 
Hop on bus tour, which i would recommend, stops very close to here. So easy access to all your touristy wants!",5,2016,04,21
231,Stayed here on a Hen!!,"We stayed here the 1st weekend in April on a hen & would definitely recommend.

The hotel was lovely, rooms were very clean & hotel staff were so friendly & helpful, nothing was too much bother, that includes all staff thought out the different areas of the hotel. 

The hotel is very central with many places of interest within walking distance & temple bar was approx €10 in a taxi. 

We all enjoyed our stay!! ",5,2016,04,21
231,Poor service and poor value for money,Paid a lot of money for the two night stay.   Poor servicing in rooms and bar.  Staff seemed exhausted and demotivated.   No minibar.   Bar food was terrible and staff didn't seem bothered.   Good central location in Dublin and reception staff were very helpful ,2,2016,04,20
231,Perfect base to see Dublin,"Great hotel, friendly staff and a great base for seeing Dublin. Hotel situation is within walking distance of all the sights of Dublin. Rooms very good and breakfast fills you up for the day. As we left before breakfast they provided a packed meal.",5,2016,04,20
231,Weekend Break,"Great location, only 10 minutes walk to the more lively Temple Bar, friendly staff and well maintained rooms, excellent breakfast facilities, only negative was that you could hear conversation from adjoining room.",4,2016,04,20
231,Weekend break,"Great location in centre of Dublin.  The complimentary breakfast was good and served to 11 at weekends.the rooms were quiet so got a good nights sleep.  Only negative point was that the residents bar closed at 1:30.  As there were a group of us, a nightcap in the bar would have been good.    ",4,2016,04,20
231,Good hotel and base for a family trip,"We stayed at this hotel as a family for 3 nights in April. 

The room was clean and comfortable, ours overlooked Parnell Street. The rooms were reasonably sound proof, there was little noise from the hotel corridor or other rooms and we only heard some external noise one night.

The breakfast is self service and had a good selection of hot and cold options and drinks. We also had an evening meal in the pub which was reasonably priced and tasty.

All of the staff we came across were polite and helpful.

We would certainly stay here agin.",5,2016,04,19
231,Pleasant stay in convenient location,"When I told my wife where I was staying, her first reply was "" Isn't that area a bit dodgy?"". So, the surroundings aren't the most salubrious, but this is a very comfortable hotel, with aimiable enough staff. So, probably not the best part of Dublin for wandering through, of an evening, but convenient to O Connell St & all that jazz. I wasn't there as a tourist - at a conference in Convention Centre - but can see the convenience. Nice 25 minute walk, every morning, by the way, to conference centre.
The room was perfectly comfortable. Because I booked at last minute, got a 'superior' room which was nice. It came with 10% off meals etc. as well as free coffee each day. But, boy, had I difficulty getting the staff to understand this!! You need to explain to your staff what these mean, folks! I got embarassed and gave up, to be honest! Not a game changer, just irksome.
Had food in bar & was perfectly tasty. Staff there were helpful enough. Heard some idiot complain abour his fillet steak last night, but in truth, this is bar food, for God sake. Don't go for your fancy steak!
Breakfast was perfectly good. All you could want and more. Bit busy, but go earlier. 
Overall, a happy, painfree stay. Well done!",4,2016,04,19
231,Perfection,"Stayed 3 nights  great location to explore Dublin hotel was lovely even supply shampoo ect , nice breakfast ,The Parnell pub just down from hotel does lovely food as does the murrey bar and grill just across o,connell st with entertainment all night not to far for 2 ladies on own did temple bar in the afternoon good experience and entertainment hop on buses a must to get around and the Dublin pass is a good saver did Guinness the zoo jamesons and air coach with pass .",5,2016,04,18
231,Nice hotel good location,"Good hotel for a short stay in Dublin , staff were friendly and helpful, room was very clean, bar area was small but nice enough, good location just off o'connoll st not far from temple bar and Grafton st, would definitely stay here again",4,2016,04,18
231,Family trip,Great place to stay.  Had two teenage girls with me location was great for them.  Food in bar was great any flood we ordered was very well presented and piping hot.  Evening got sandwiches made up which were not on menu,4,2016,04,18
231,Single stay,"Parking is a very big problem. If we were not driving, everything was great! Not recommended for driving customers. Location was great except for the parking. All jury's inn in Ireland are on a vary good location for what I experienced.",4,2016,04,18
231,"An excellent inexpensive hotel suitably placed for Sightseeing , Shopping and Night Entertainment !","Stayed for 2 nights in April 2016  ( Friday + Saturday ) 
Service was excellent !
Breakfast was Brilliant !
Room was very clean and well equipped !
All in All ; we couldn't have asked for more ( Especially at the price we paid ) 
Would recommend it to anybody

The only problem I had  ( and I am being Ultra Fussy ) , was the Coffee Machines in the Restaurant ( only 2 of them ) were slow to load up and pour. But the quality of coffee was really good ; so a very small price to pay",5,2016,04,18

231,"Good hotel, decent location, service can be hit and miss","I stayed for 1 night in the Jurys Inn, Parnell street during December last. 

Being from Dublin I’ll give you an idea of location. Parnell street can be a bit of a lively spot, I wouldn’t recommend walking around there alone at night time but ordinarily I’d say you shouldn’t have any trouble. The street runs parallel with Henry street, one of the main shopping thoroughfares. If you duck down Moore street or go through the Ilac shopping centre only a 2 minute walk you’re there. From there the Liffey is only another 3 or 4 minutes’ walk away. So the location isn’t a bad one. I selected it as my wife was in the Rotunda Maternity hospital, so anyone with family attending the Rotunda should consider this a good hotel location too.

On arrival, I was met by 2 friendly staff members at reception who were very welcoming and were quick to check me in. There’s additional security by the fact that you need a key to use the lifts to get to you room, which is always a good idea, especially in a city hotel. My room was of average size, was spotlessly clean and what I would expect in a business class hotel. If you have this in mind, which I did, it would be difficult to fault. 

I had room service that evening and breakfast in the morning. Overall the food quality was fine. One problem I did encounter was during the day I went to the bar for a late lunch/early dinner. The area was full and from what I could see there was only 1 person working. She was behind the bar, walking around taking food orders and then leaving to collect food to glove to the diners. I waited for about 20 minutes, trying to get her attention but decided to leave if I wanted to eat. Clearly not the girls fault but the area was understaffed to the point myself and a few other guests left. Such a shame that the hotel would allow this to occur. 

To give an final overall impression, I feel the hotels location is good but certainly not great. You will be paying 4 star rates for what I feel is a 3 start business class hotel. The service for me was a little hit and miss. However all in all it is a good hotel.",3,2016,04,17
231,central location for good money,Hotel is very close to the Airlink bus. Easy access to the airport. Nice location in the centre. Walking distance to famous museums like the Trinity College and the Book of Kells library. Nice restaurants close to the Hotel.,4,2016,04,17
231,Great hotel with a central location & easy access to main trourist and shopping areas in Dublin,Hotel is very centrally located on Parnell Street with easy access to O'connel Street & Henry Street (for shopping). Breakfast was excellent with a variety of choices from the large buffet set out. Staff are smiley and friendly and always willing to help. We had a fairly large room with a Double bed and a sofa bed for the kids and the room was ready for us when we arrived early. There are lots of supermarkets and cafes around the area along with loads of restaurants and fast food chains to keep one going. Excellent service and a great hotel overall!,5,2016,04,17
231,"Fab place to stay, close to the centre","We travelled as 3 adults and 3 children 10,7 & 4 and stayed for 3 nights. Hotel is in a perfect location away from the Temple Bar end but still walkable. Literally round the corner from O'Connell Street. We used the Aircoach from the airport and the drop off is less than a 5 minute walk to the hotel. The staff are really helpful and friendly. The rooms are a reasonable size and are kept spotless, we had our room tidied everyday. The bathroom is clean, quite modern and provides shampoo & shower gel. The breakfast was fab with every choice you could want. The hotel gets much busier at the weekend but during the week was relatively quiet. We ate in the hotel restaurant the first night and whilst the menu is small the food was really nice. Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2016,04,17

231,Great value for a city centre hotel,"Checked out today and had a really good nights sleep. I'm not hard to please normally, but even so, the room was very clean, comfortable and warm. Amenities - tea/coffee, hairdryer etc. were spot on. Bathroom was large and the shower was excellent.

Breakfast is as good as you'll get anywhere. Great choice and lots of it. To be honest, if you can't get something you like here, you're gonna suffer and go hungry in so many other places.

The location is fabulous. We drove to it and found it very easily (using the GPS details from their website). Less than 5 minute walk and you're on O'Connell Street right in the city centre.

If I had a negative, there is no onsite parking so we used one nearby. Like most city carparks it was extremely expensive. Went 28 minutes over the 24 hours and paid €33.00 instead of the quoted €18.00 Now that was a rip off, but no fault of the hotel. My fault for being late, but still....!!",5,2016,04,16
231,"Great stay at Parnell St, Jury's Inn","Lovely hotel with friendly, helpful staff and ideally situated. The staff brought us extra pillows and provided us with more milk when we asked. The rooms were clean and the beds were really comfortable. There were 3 adults sharing a room and there was more than enough room for us all. We did open the window over night and this sufficient to keep us cool. The bathroom has everything we needed, although we could have used a shower cap, but we managed. The breakfast was a big hit with us all and the buffet was nice and hot. Again, the staff were friendly and helpful right up to check out and beyond, putting our bags in to a safe room whilst we went out for the day. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone. Thank you for making our stay in Dublin so enjoyable.",5,2016,04,16
231,"Good value for money, ticked most boxes","I stayed on the second floor where the bar and restaurant was and I found it difficult at first to find the direction to the rooms as there was no clear sign.
The rooms were cold and didn't warm up very much -even though I put the room temperature to its highest (25 degrees). Would have been nice to have provided room slippers as the room was so cold.
My room was next to the door to exit to the foyer/lifts, I did not get a good nights sleep as you can constantly hear the door closing and opening and it was very loud.
My room overlooked out to the main road, but had no problem with noise as it was quiet.
The choice of breakfast was lovely, however it wasn't very hot, just warm enough.
However, in an excellent location - less than 5 mins walk to the city centre. I really liked how informative the receptionist was as soon as I checked in. The security of the lifts, doors and lights in the rooms operated by your room key and the layout and service menus available in the room.",4,2016,04,15
231,1916 tour,"This hotel is so well located in the city centre,there is no car park however there is great rates in the local  shopping centres. This hotel has fantastic and friendly staff which made our stay .Every thing we wanted to do was in walking distance . ",5,2016,04,15
231,Lovely hotel but....,"A well situated hotel in the centre of Dublin. I'm here at the moment on my second sleepless night! The hotel itself is lovely but the beds.....!!! They are so uncomfortable and the pillows like slabs of rock ( jury's inn could do with talking to premiere inn about there mattresses.)
The breakfast has plenty of choice and well cooked. The rooms are spacious with good facilities ( hairdryer and iron in each room). The rooms coffee is not so good.... Cheap sachets of coffee!!! Might want to bring your own! 
Whilst having a brilliant time in Dublin slightly spoilt by the hotel. Just need to change the mattresses to allow for a good nights sleep ready for the next busy day in Dublin. ",3,2016,04,15
231,Great base for dublin stay,"Nice Hotel, clean,  reception staff very friendly and accommodating, nice bar area, again staff very nice. would stay again. close enough to all attractions Dublin offers. overall a great weekend with good accommodation.",4,2016,04,14
231,Good choice for central Dublin,"On a busy street and pavement, the hotel looks bland on the outside, but once through the doors you're in another world. While the lobby is plain and functional it is spacious, but the restaurant and bar on the second floor are comfortable and well-laid out.
For a quiet night choose a room facing the inner courtyard, as the rooms facing the street inevitably have some street noise, though the double-glazing greatly reduces it. I found the top floor best for a good night's sleep.",4,2016,04,14
231,Reasonable hotel,"I stayed her with a group of friends last weekend.  The hotel was perfectly comfortable and acceptable without being pretentious.  The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was a good sized.  I particularly like the breakfast - well presented and a very good selection.  Overall, the hotel met the requirement without being outstanding.  It is close to town and a short walk to the main tourist sites.",4,2016,04,14
231,Great location,"
This hotel is in a great location for seeing Dublin on foot. Abundance of bars, restaurants and the main shopping streets are all in easy reach. Bus tours are available around the corner and the hotel is close to cultural buildings.

231,Dublin!,Jurys Inn was a great location in Dublin.  A lovely restaurant next door with authentic food (mushy peas!) and Guinness ambiance to boot!  Very central to most shopping and a nice walk to the Temple Bar area.  Booked a couple of Paddywagon Tours that were also within walking distance to pick up.  A lovely stay in a lovely city!,4,2016,04,13
231,Birthday Celebrations,"This hotel is ideally placed for your stay in Dublin.
Temple Bar has all the places you need to eat and drink.
Well worth a visit are Dublin Castle, Trinity College, Christ Church Cathedral along with lots of other tourist musts.
The hotel offers good food and well equipped rooms - breakfast has something for everyone.",5,2016,04,13
231,Great hotel,"This hotel is smack bang in the middle of the city centre, negating the need for taxis and busses (money saved immediately!). On arrival the reception area is very modern and the staff are helpful. Now I will say that the room was that bit small, I walked in and felt a little claustrophobic at first. There was air control in the room which would have helped but it was January so there was no need for it. The only thing I will say is that there is no parking provided and that's why ive knocked the property to 3 stars. Big drawback having to pay extra for parking. Overall though perfect hotel, quiet and right in the centr of the city!",3,2016,04,13
231,Great experience,"As always Jurys have outdone themselves again, great credit to Jimmy and team, highly reccrmend for corporate customers as they really look after you and make you feel special with little treats like coffee and water in the room. I try and stay in a Jurys hotel when I am away on business. It is like home from home.

Breda",5,2016,04,12
231,Good location and staff,"Location is good, it is in a very ""touristy"" area near O'Connell street. Most of the better bars are South of the river, but after all most people who stay at hotels are tourists and it is not exactly a long walk over the river (10 minutes).

The staff are friendly and helpful. However I think the hotel just needs a little TLC. Our room was on the fifth floor so far above the noisy street level, but we were woken up several times on both nights we stayed as our room was right by the lift and was basically not sound-proofed. Anybody who went past at any time of the night who spoke we could here. And we weren't exactly in bed early or sleeping in late, we probably went to bed at around 2am and were up at 8 both days. In a city that enjoys a good drink the rooms probably need a little more sound-proofing.

The lift system is also weird and needs to be explained on check-in: most people were confused by it. And the rooms need a little bit of TLC and a spruce up.

The breakfast is good, can't beat Irish bacon really.

Overall a decent hotel and good value for the money in a fairly pricey city, but some small changes such as re-decorating the rooms, sound-proofing rooms by the lift and other little changes would improve the overall feel.",3,2016,04,12
231,Overnight stop,"Great central location and value for money. All areas clean and bedrooms very comfortable. Staff helpful and friendly. Plenty of choice at breakfast. Would recommend this hotel and will stay again.
Very handy for the airport bus service, the Easter Rising exhibition eat the GPO  and easy walking distance for the Jameson Distillery tour.

231,Recommend Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street for family,"great stay at the hotel, should be a 4*. People are geniusly kindly and helpfull. Room and facilities super clean. Great buffet. Very nice bar. Good location, very central but still quiet, bus tram and train very close by feet, 20 min from the airport by bus (aircoach type) or taxi",5,2016,04,12
231,Family break in the city,"Unfortunately our adjoining rooms we requested did not happen. 
My pull out bed or cot as they call it was cold and uncomfortable with no extra blankets provided. 
Bar area where we ate was cold. 
Staff were all friendly. My poor experience is no reflection on staff. ",2,2016,04,11
231,Clean rooms and new furniture,"I stayed in a double room for a night. The room was clean and comfortable. The staff really kind. Everything is good. I did not any problem.

231,Stay here a lot.,Stay here a lot and usually it's very comfortable but this time I didn't sleep well at all due to the bed & pillows being very uncomfortable. I can say however that this was the first time out of 5 stays this has happened and usually I really enjoy it.. breakfast was also very poor on this occasion. The hotel is very central and has a nice bar. ,4,2016,04,11

231,So near for all,"Stayed here a few times and this hotel is in such a centrally god location for all the main sights in Dublin.

231,Did everything we needed it to do!,"I came here with my boyfriend on a weekend away. I thought the location was great, literally in the city centre but wasn't noisy or anything and was extremely convenient! The staff were extremely friendly and helpful also :-) The room itself was compact, but very cosy. It was really really clean also which was good! Breakfast was really good too and was thoroughly enjoyed by both of us. Especially loved the tea!! Only complaints I have are the fact that the drainage system in the shower mustn't have been great as the shower tray filled up really fast and risked overflowing onto the actual bathroom floor. Also the temperature settings on the shower were limited, and I felt that the shower gel provided was watered down. We also felt the breakfast juices were watered down. But apart from these minor things it was a great stay!",4,2016,04,10
231,Great stay,"All the staff at this hotel are very polite, friendly and helpful. 
The hotel is well-situated for sight-seeing in Dublin, being just around the corner from the main street - O'Connell. There is a good selection of food at breakfast. We also ate our evening meal there on a couple of occasions - and again, there was a good choice on the menu, and portion sizes were good.
The hotel is very clean, and our room was very comfortable.
We were here to celebrate a special anniversary, and we were glad we had chosen such a good hotel.",5,2016,04,10
231,Nice modern hotel in central location,"My husband and I have stayed in this hotel a number of times. The location is great, within walking distance of shops, restaurants and bars. There is a Tesco supermarket located across the street as well as a really nice cinema. Standard rooms are clean, a decent size with modern decor and have free wi-fi. Staff are friendly and helpful and we have been allowed to check in early a couple of times. If the room isn't ready, they will hold your bags until you can check in. Breakfast (full Irish buffet) is very tasty. It is a pity that there's not pool or gym but its still a great hotel. I would definitely recommended this hotel - it remains my hotel of choice in Dublin!",4,2016,04,10

231,Factfinding on the Easter Rising,"This hotel is ideally situated to explore the city, its history and cultural aspects.  Allow at least three days to do it.  The shops and art galleries of the North side of Dublin are close to the hotel and the South side, including Trinity College and St Stephen's Green are about 20 minutes away on foot. Dublin is tourist-friendly.",5,2016,04,07
231,Lovely hotel and staff,Staff were excellent and would go out of their way to be helpful. Breakfast and restaurant staff were particularly efficient and welcoming and the quality of the food was lovely. We had a lovely meal in the restaurant and would gladly go again. Only complaint would be the cost. All hotels we looked at for the dates were particularly expensive but may have been due to Easter? Location was also perfect for us.

231,Fantastic customer service,"I booked this hotel as a gift to my parents. They were very impressed with the location of the hotel and also the cleanliness. 

During their stay another resident entered my parents room in the early hours causing them alarm. My parents did not want to cause a fuss but reported it to reception and turned down the chance of seeing the manager. I decided though that I wanted to get this investigated as I had made the booking. 

I emailed the hotel and within a couple of hours the manager asked to call me to discuss. It turns out my parents hadn't closed their door property. I just want to say a big thank you to Patrick the manager for fantastic customer service. He explained everything in detail including door readings and cctv footage.  This to me proved that this hotel takes security and its reputation seriously. 

It's not often that big companies go above and beyond but Patrick and the jury's inn Parnell St really did. 

The next time we are in Dublin this hotel will be my first choice. ",4,2016,04,06

The staff were always topping up things as they ran out and very helpful too. The room was spacious and totally suitable for what we needed & it was in a quiet part of the hotel too. The hotel bar was no more expensive that drinks in Temple Bar. The hotel were happy to look after luggage so you didn't have to take it everywhere with you - Definitely recommend to anyone travelling to Dublin.",5,2016,04,06
231,Good deal for great location,"Perfect hotel for restaurants (lots of places nearby for lunch/dinner), shopping (right next to Henry street shopping area) and sightseeing.

Lobby is small and pretty nondescript.  The room was a decent size.  The bathroom was tiny!  If you have a lot of toiletries, you'll need to leave them outside.  There is one mini shelf and that's about it.  The room was clean and looked to be well maintained.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Free WiFi worked well.  The free breakfast was pretty decent.

231,"Very nice, comfortable and well positioned hotel","We stayed at Jurys Parnell Street for two days and nights over Easter.  The hotel is modern and bright and the staff are friendly and helpful.  Our bedroom was a good size with a double and single bed (though not all have two beds)  It was bright and clean with all the usual facilities (tea, iron, tv etc). Breakfast is not included in the price and a buffet breakfast can be bought for €10 in the restaurant.  The breakfast was very good with all the usual food available.  The hot food was very hot and very good. The beds were very comfortable and ours was king size.  It is situated just off O'Connell street and a few minutes walk from the GPO, and Henry Street and Moore Street.  The restaurant and bar are on the first floor, but there are 3 lifts available.  They are bright and modern but the bar staff were not very pleasant or helpful.  There were 7 of for dinner and at least 4 of the 7 said their food was cold or just luke warm - including the soup.  Two meals had to be sent back, though mine was hot and very tasty (salmon with garlic baby potatoes).  Not a good sign for a city centre hotel - although it was Easter and they were rushed.",5,2016,04,04
231,Location first class,"Stayed here for a couple of days last June. 

Check in took a while, as there were 60 of us checking in. But a cracking excuse to have a couple in the bar. Bar was of decent size, and has a courtyard outside. 

Rooms were of decent size, and clean along with a modern bathroom. 

Location is handy just off oconnell street which is the gateway to the attractions. 

Breakfast was of a good standard for a buffet. 

All in all an enjoyable stay. ",5,2016,04,04
231,Pleasant stay.,"Stayed here for 3 days during the week. It was a little pricey, but when compared to other hotels in the area it was quite cheap. Good location, with a selection of eateries and restaurants within a close reach. Fairly close to a few shopping centres too. I've included breakfast in my stay and that is the only thing I would complain about. Food was ok, standard hotel breakfast. However, there wasn't enough staff, it wasn't getting refilled in time. Never any cutlery or clean tables. Juices are diluted to the point that you're drinking coloured water ! Overall however, a pleasant stay.",4,2016,04,04
231,a grand day out,"i would recommend this hotel very highly
great location, great coffee shops, delicious Irish breakfast and in the prime location for all tours and airport bus. a great welcome and to have the bags stored early was a real bonus to allow the family to roam the city luggage free, we had arrived.",5,2016,04,04
231,Super stay in Dublin,The staff are friendly and aim to please.  The doormen are especially pleasant and go out of their way to be welcoming.  It was an extremely busy weekend but we had no issues with Jurys except breakfast time which was extremely busy and we had to sit in the bar/lounge which was further away from the buffet etc. We had 2 adults and 2 children (teenagers) and the room was a bit small for us but was well equipped and clean.  Great location being just around the corner from O'Connell Street or a short walk to Henry Street shops.  ,4,2016,04,04
231,An adequate no frills hotel in central Dublin.,The general decor of this hotel is a bit dull and tired. Our room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was also clean and the shower was powerful. The towels were clean but very well worn,3,2016,04,04
231,Friendly staff but too expensive for a 3 star hotel,"Hotel was very good located and so it was a great Point to start Sightseeing, Shopping, etc. Staff of the Hotel (especially Concierge at the entrance and receptionist Eve!) were very very helpful and more than friendly - Hotel itself needs a renovation, especially the matresses and the bathrooms new a renewal.",3,2016,04,04
231,Mad max experience,"Hotel lovely.staff helpful and friendly..But step outside and its crazy.roadworks,litter,impatient drivers ,hoardes of smokers to name but a few of the hazards.Pavements and pedestrians are a health hazard. While hotel is very convenient for sightseeing ,it could be scary experience for those not used to dublin.I know these issues are out of control of hotel but it is nice hotel in prime location and shame to get such negative view on exiting hotel",3,2016,04,03
231,Great place to stay.,Great hotel. Plenty of common space to hang out. Bar was large enough to accommodate many parties. Hotel was clean. Staff at both the front desk and housekeeping were friendly and helpful. Location is very convenient to O'Connell St.,5,2016,04,03
231,Disorganised chaos,"Stayed for 7 nights over Easter during Rising celebrations, hotel was full (another guest said they'd got the last room) so I suppose they were under pressure, but a hotel chain of this size should have been able to cope.  Room was fine but bathroom not as spotlessly clean as I would have liked and expected in a hotel such as this.  Communal stairwells also grubby looking, carpets not hoovered for the week we were there etc.  Breakfast was extremely good and good choices, but unfortunately it was chaotic in finding somewhere to sit, more often than not had to sit at a table covered with dirty plates or had to go and sit in the bar.  They should have had many more staff clearing tables (they knew when the busy times were!) with one person directing them and the guests.  Ate there 2 nights, food - cannot fault it, excellent.  Service first time absolutely fine, terrible second time, again seemed to be a lack of staff and the staff who were there seemed unsure what to do and unsupported by someone more senior.  Had to ask for table water, bread and second place setting and then had to wait 50 mins for starter, the excuse was the bar food orders were busy although the restaurant was virtually empty.  We then waited another length of time for main course.  I got the impression that they were short staffed, this on the busiest weekend in Ireland in 2016!  Maybe someone rang in sick but I was disappointed that a big company like Jury's Inn which is not cheap did not have some sort of contingency.  On a plus side the location of this hotel is excellent, central location and short walking distance to virtually everything in Dublin city.  Check in and out was also quick and painless.",3,2016,04,03
231,Family vacances at Dublin,Every was fine except pillows and prices. It is too expensive the hotels at Dublin. The room and the beds were ok but the pillows were too small and soft. I missed too and fridge at the room too keep things.,5,2016,04,02
231,City centre perfect,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Booked a superior room and wasnt disappointed. Room lovely only thing kept catching my leg on the side of the bed where the catch was as not a lot of space between the bed and the bathroom wall. Otherwise perfect room.
Very near O'Connell street would stay here again when back in Dublin.",4,2016,04,02
231,Family trip,"Did not get what I booked, food good , staff friendly,  beds not comfortable, good location , Should  make it more clear which car park the hotel recommend and the direction to same ,  paid E33 for parking",1,2016,04,01
231,Family Easter Break,"Fantastic location, so close to shopping and attractions. Good sized bedroom and perfectly quiet so we slept really well. We didn't eat at the hotel as there was such a large choice of eateries in the immediate vicinity. Subsidised parking meant we stayed in Clery's car park for 14 euros (48 hrs). I'd definitely stay here again.",5,2016,04,01
231,Easter Week,Not a single problem. The employees were exceptional. The room was spotless. The restaurant was wonderful. The location was in the hart of all the action for the Easter Rising of 1916. When I return to Dublin it will be my first choice of hotel..,5,2016,04,01
231,Excellent location and first rate customer service. All staff extremely helpful.,This hotel is in an excellent location. All the staff were extremely helpful and approachable. I stayed with my young son and I felt very secure within the hotel. Staff were always willing to offer advice about getting around Dublin and the best way to do it. ,4,2016,04,01
231,My Easter Stay In Dublin,"from when we arrived on Easter Saturday evening we were met with kindness and professionalism. The reception area , the bedroom and the restaurant were what you come to expect from Jury's Inns.
The hotel is in easy 'walking distance' for all historic locations and the superb amenities from anywhere in O'Connell Street.",5,2016,04,01
231,Great Location,Hotel very well situated for shopping and sightseeing. Excellent breakfast (lots of choice )!! Rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Definitely an enjoyable stay. I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2016,03,31
231,good,"Very central, just 1 minute walk to O'Connell Street and 5 mins to Temple Bar and Grafton Street.   Room practical, comfortable and cosy, not big, but enough for a day or two.   Only problem was the shower which had a blocked drain, I did clear it myself.   Tea/coffee, shower gel etc available.   Will probably book again.",4,2016,03,31
231,"Price is right, good location, excellent staff, very clean","I spent nine nights here so I feel that I can give a fair review.  I arrived in the morning and there was a room ready for me immediately which I appreciated greatly.  My room faced the courtyard so I had natural light from the large window.  The room was not large, but more than sufficient and very comfortable.  The bed was comfortable.  The cleaning staff did an excellent job--my room was always immaculate.  I enjoyed having the electric kettle and real (not disposable) mugs.  The staff always replenished the teabags which made me very happy.    The location was good--across the street is a supermarket--super handy.  An unexpected delight was the big bookstore, Chapters, across the street.  Taxis were always ready at the front.  The location is close to buses.  The breakfast buffet was generous and the food was always good.  Like another reviewer, a bit more variety might have been nice.  I liked the large metal teapots unlike the tiny ones that you usually find here in the USA.  The rolls and Irish butter were delicious.  The doorman and the reception people were very helpful and polite--compliments to all the staff at Jury's Inn.  I sometimes ate at the ""Snack Bar"" which really is a lounge that serves drinks and food.  I enjoyed everything that I had there and the young people who work there were lovely.  If there could be some improvement, it would be to have a safe in the room.  There were safes available in the hotel and I did take advantage of that one time--however, if you lose your key, you must pay over 200 euros.  (I think that's right...it was a lot of money.)  Thank goodness, I didn't lose the key.  But, after that, I just kept everything in the room because I felt that the hotel was secure and the employees extremely decent and honest.  The hotel is not ""fancy""--however, comfortable, clean and priced quite reasonably.  Worth every penny.",4,2016,03,31
231,"Jurys Inn parnell Street Pricey no frills, bar shuts early","Not the cheapest hotel in Dublin by a long shot, expected a bit more, was average to good, staff are friendly and helpful, we stayed over the final day of the 6 nations was a good atomosphere in the bar at night, full of scottish fans who were a great crack but they shut the bar at 01:30 and all were dissapointed.",3,2016,03,31
231,Jury Inn stay,Close to everything. Lovely hotel. Within walking distance to most attractions and amenities in Dunlin city centte. Would return to this hotel again and recommend it to anyone who visits Dublins Fair City. ,4,2016,03,31
231,Easter weekend,We stayed at this hotel for the easter weekend and had an excellent time. The location was excellent. All the staff were very helpful and the service provided was to a vey high standard. The hotel itself was very clean and modern and we will ertainly be returning again in the near future,5,2016,03,31
231,excellent staff,"I have just returned from one of the most delightful trips to dublin I have had in a long time thanks to jurys inn parnell street and their excellent team of staff. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough for friendliness, professionalism and service...definitely on a par with the four and five star hotels I have stayed in while in dublin. Not only will I be back I have highly recommended jurys Parnell Street to all my friends and family.",5,2016,03,30
231,Great place for location and good breakfast,I would recommend this hotel as it is centrally located and the breakfast is very good lots on offer. The staff constanly replenished the hot food on offer. The rooms are comfortable and warm. Location is just 2mins from o'connell street. ,4,2016,03,30
231,Great location,"Lovely hotel, staff very helpful and friendly,  location couldn't be better for all attractions. Taxi rank outside hotel, all bus stops one minute walk, in the centre of all shops, breakfast consisted of anything you could possibly want. Rooms very clean, would definitely sta here again .",5,2016,03,30
231,Great Easter Rising,A great Hotel over the 3 night stay had no problem with the hotel breakfast and would stay again. Booking in was easy and able to drop off the bags early and even book in before the correct time. Room was very clean no noise for the outside  ,5,2016,03,30
231,Watch you change,"Stayed for four nights 24 to 28 March for the easter rising commemoration  week end
Great location good rooms very nice staff except for one barman who tried to rob me of 20 euro on our first night
After giving him 50 euro for an 8 euro 85  cent call i was given 20 euro 15 cent change
When i brought this to his attention he turned away from me walked to the end of the bar turned around came back and gave me 20euro
When i asked him why he did not check the till (which he didnt ) he said he got the 20 euro from the tip jar 
Guilty or not 
I would still recommend this hotel as everything else was perfect and i dont think that this unsavoury character will last long in this hotel",5,2016,03,30
231,Disappointed,"I had booked this trip nearly a year in advance for my family & friends…. On arrival the first impression of the Hotel and Rooms are clean and very modern. Reception staff seemed quite helpful and friendly…. We stayed in rooms 456 & 458 no issue with the rooms , however for the next 3 days we returned after full days out enjoying the celebrations to find our rooms had not been made up or we had fresh towels, first day you can accept however 2 & 3 days was just not acceptable. Spoke with reception staff and asked to speak with Manager, I was informed someone would be in contact shortly…..STILL WAITING!!!!! We dined in the restaurant once, food was cold so they microwaved it for me ??  Food was served on small plates not even dinner plates , was informed by restaurant manager that you receive the same sized portion where it is on a small plate or a dinner plate ??? Not enough staff , they all seemed to be running about with no guidance… This weekend and the Celebrations have been in the planning for months just a pity there was NO Management at this Hotel to plan it better… Really Disappointed as it is Situated in a Fantastic Location with easy access to Dublin City Centre…..",2,2016,03,30
231,An Irish holiday,"We enjoyed our stay at the Jury's Inn Parnell very much.  It is close to all the city center sights, and the staff at the front desk are very helpful and courteous. Our rooms were comfortable and clean and the beds were comfortable.  The decor in the rooms is good, not the most luxurious I've stayed at, but far better than other hotels in that price range.  Overall, I'd say it was a great choice for the price and location",5,2016,03,29
231,Good location,"We were given a choice of rooms when we checked in. Ours was spacous, clean and newly decorated.There were tea and coffee making facilities in the room and the wifi worked well.  The staff on reception were friendly  and helpful. There's an excellent  breakfast and the staff were pretty good at replenishing the buffet when it was busy and some items had all gone. Finally, the hotel is in a good location for central Dublin.",4,2016,03,29
231,Great hotel,"Had a very nice stay in this hotel with my mum and two kids. Hotel was in a great location and from entering was spotless. 
The room and toilet were cleaned to a very high standard and the bar and food was great. The bar menu was very reasonable and very tasty.
 Very friendly and helpful staff. 
Fantastic breakfast but very busy at peak times so I would advise going early.
The only fault was the car park expensive and hard to find but I think the hotel can give you a discount I forgot to ask.
I will definitely be staying in this hotel again can't wait.",5,2016,03,29
231,Not prepared for the busy Easter rising weekend! ,"I booked to stay in this hotel a year in advance.. considering it was the centenary weekend of the Easter rising. We where not impressed at all our room hadn't been cleaned properly when we arrived, with rubbish left on the floor and sweets sticking to the carpet. Food in the hotel bar is very poor, members of our family where sick after eating in the bar.The Guinness ( which  my husband, brother & father) where looking forward to was awful actually it was rotten, nobody could drink it. The hotel was not prepared at all for the busy weekend, the breakfast was a shambles people where constantly complaining to staff that there was no food, knives, forks, tea bags.  The location is the only thing that jurys inn Parnell street as to offer! Myself and my family where disappointed in the hotel and its service. Will never stay here again",3,2016,03,29
231,Margaret,"Brilliant. Location  ,value for money ,very helpful staff.  Only fault room and bathroom  too small
Lovely bar, would stay again when in Dublin 
 I would highly recommend it , no shower cap provided in bathroom 
",4,2016,03,28
231,A good hotel in a very good location,"An easy hotel to find just meters off the top of O’Connell street. A very spacious lobby which was good as, checking in was slow due to there being more people checking in than the number of reception staff on duty. Once I got to the front of the queue it only took a few minutes before I was in one of the 3 room card activated lifts & on the way up to my room. 
My room which overlooked the courtyard was, as expected, a decent size, clean & comfortable. A comfortable double bed, single bed, clothes rail, work desk, luggage rack, full length mirror, small table & chair, smoke alarm, tv, hairdryer, tea & coffee, air con. I didn’t notice a safe or iron in the room. Wifi was free but was quite slow. Room temperature was nice & I had no issues with noise from outside or inside the hotel & sleep quality was good. Natural light in the room was poor even though there was a decent size window in the room.
The bathroom was small but clean with fully tiled walls & floor, bath, fixed head shower with good pressure & plenty of hot water, shower gel, shampoo, liquid soap, enough towels, shaving socket & wall vent.
I went down for breakfast at 09.45 & even though it was reasonably busy, I got seated straight away. Breakfast was good, buffet style, with a good choice available – toast, cereals, yoghurts, cheese, croissants, fruit slices, full fry, fruit juices, teas & coffee.
There were ice making machines & vending machines with snacks & soft drinks located at the lifts. Complimentary national newspapers were available. I had time to kill before catching my bus home & left my luggage in the secure left luggage room for a couple of hours.
The hotel is in a very good location for visiting the shops or sights of the city. Busaras is approx. 15 minutes walk with wheeled luggage. Henry street & the Jervis Shopping Centre are 3 to 4 minutes walk away , Leprechaun Museum a 5 to 6 minutes walk & Jameson Distillery about a 15 minute walk away.",4,2016,03,28
231,St.Patricks day weekend,"Very central hotel with good value for money. Great bar + restaurant , but a bit dear as nearly everything in dublin. The rooms are perfectly sized and have comfy beds as well as clean bathrooms. Good service but the view is a bit poor. ",4,2016,03,28
231,Overpriced,"A very overpriced hotel with very friendly staff but rooms basic with a long walk to lifts, if you try and take stairs you can t access anywhere, Very good breakfast if you can tolerate constant irish pipe music,£500 not worth the money, I,d expect £48 per night for that standard whatever the event, recycling plant to rear of hotel, woken at 6am while they are moving containers lovely view, not. Location not great, wrong side of river for temple bar etc.",3,2016,03,28
231,Great value and location,"My family and I stayed here during a recent visit to Dublin.  This hotel is very well located, inexpensive, and clean.  The staff is very friendly, professional and accommodating.  The lobby is well appointed and large enough for large crowds to gather.  Breakfast buffet was excellent.  Beds were comfortable.  Porters were outstanding.  The rooms have tea and coffee making equipment.  The hair dryer is located in the desk, something my grandchild found puzzling.  The Wi-Fi was surprisingly fast, an unexpected positive.  If I returned to Dublin would I stay here again, absolutely.",4,2016,03,27
231,The staff is the best part,"The hotel is just ok, but not great.  The staff however, are great.  They are very friendly, and helpful in every way.  I was with a group so no real choice of where I could stay.  The location was convenient.  It was within walking distance of town and the HoHo bus line.  There was a decent breakfast with nice wait staff also.    Perhaps I am just spoiled with US hotels, but the room was small, bed not very comfortable,  no vanity in the bathroom, just two small glass shelves that were in the way for the laboratory,  and the hair dryer had to be used in the bedroom where the lighting was poor and a mirror too high for a short person.  I would not choose to stay here if given a choice.",4,2016,03,27
231,Great location,"Have recently come back from a 2 night stay here. The hotel is a great location and for that I would recommend it. The staff were lovely and very helpful, however, I was disappointed with our room for the price we paid. The room was small and the shower door and bathroom door was hanging off and the window seals were broken. I have stayed in other Jury's Inn and the rooms were lovely so I was a little disappointed and I think if you shop around you could possibly find better value.
Dublin overall- I would highly recommend the hop on hop off buses they are a great easy way to see Dublin, we also did the Liddy's walking tour as well which I would recommend. The storehouse Guinness factory was also really enjoyable and a good experience. There are a few pubs/ cafes around the hotel, Parnells did lovely food which is very near the hotel. We also had breakfast in murrays which was lovely and cost 20 Euros for 2 of us, however, on O'Connel street there is a restaurant called Flanigan's and they also do breakfast which was really nice and cost 10 Euros for 2 of us so would definitely recommend there.
Temple Bar is a must and such an amazing experience, the atmosphere is brilliant and there is music from 1pm-2am.",3,2016,03,26
231,Return visit -just as good as last year,"Stayed here same time last year. When I knew we were returning to Dublin didn't consider any other hotel as we were so happy with the previous visit. Our flight from Cardiff arrived at Dublin at 0745 we collected our Citypasses at the airport and got the airport transfer coach to the city. It dropped us off the other side of O'Connell Street but a walk of about 5 minutes saw us at the hotel. 

As we were too early for our room we were checked in and advised to come back after 1600, but the hotel has a luggage storage room which we used so we could get on with our sightseeing. Eva at reception completed our check-in paperwork to avoid delays when we got back in the afternoon. Fantastic customer service.

We were allocated room 464 which had a double and single bed. The room was very comfortable and sufficiently sized for three sharing a room. The view wasn't that great (overlooking the rear lane area) but it was fine, no noise disturbances during the stay). We were on a breakfast inclusive room rate which I would advise is worth it as there was a good selection of items each morning. Didn't use the restaurant at night as we ate out in the city.

Room has tea and coffee making facilities which is great and was refilled each morning. Also for those who require a hair dryer there's one in the drawer of the writing desk in the room.

To the management of the hotel: Please can you pass on my gratitude to Eva for her help at check-in and especially Velina at reception who was so polite, happy and helpful when I asked if she could assist us with our online airline check-in as we were unable to print the boarding passes. My only negative comment to the management is that far too often queues would build up at reception due to there being just one member of staff having to do everything from check-in new guests to answering constant phone queries. I understand that this may be a corporate staffing decision but it is something that needs addressing. I am very patient and don't mind waiting a short while, but sometimes through no fault of the frontline staff the wait was too long.

Thanks again for another great stay, next time I'm over in Dublin I will be staying at Jurys Inn Parnell Street",4,2016,03,26
231,Location Is Awesome. It Is Close To EVERYTHING. Great Value!,"If you are looking for a place that is close to everything, easy to find, great value and friendly staff, this is the place to stay. I stayed at Jurys Inn during Christmas and I couldn’t ask for a better deal.

For the record, it’s not a four or five star hotels where you arrive with a luxurious lobby, concierge service and a big room. This is not a hotel for you to have your honeymoon. But it’s a hotel where it’s centrally located, inexpensive and it’s easy to find. You can easily get to this hotel by taking the airport buses.

I’ve traveled all over the world and to me, fancy lobbies and concierge services are overrated if you travel a lot. Having said that, if you are like me who travel a lot and only want a hotel that’s clean and It’s well-located, Jury Inns is the hotel for you.",4,2016,03,25
231,Clean and comfortable,"Spacious, spotless room and helpful staff. Got a great deal booking through trip advisor for a three night stay. Hotel was also happy to hold our suitcases in their luggage room on our check-in and check-out days so we didn't have to cart them round the city! Less than two minutes walk from O'Connell Street and main transport links, about ten-fifteen minutes to the River Liffey and Temple Bar area. And right next door to The Parnell Heritage Pub!",4,2016,03,25
231,Fab weekend in Dublin,"Lovely hotel, great staff - very friendly and helpful. Good location for shops and bars. Would definitely recommend Jury's for a stay in Dublin, my friends and I couldn't fault it and would love to go back again",5,2016,03,25
231,Everything you want at this hotel,"We stayed two nights in March 2016 to celebrate my wife's ""special birthday"".  Had breakfast included.  Found the hotel staff excellent, very helpful and polite.  Hotel very clean; beds ""extra comfortable"".  Fully recommend this hotel.  (It is in a brilliant position for all the amenities that are on offer in Dublin.)",5,2016,03,24
231,Easter week,"Center if town
Great access to everything
A little confusing locatio
No parking for your car
Had to drag our luggage for 4 blocks
The conciere was bery informative
Would recommend another jurys inn
Thanks
",4,2016,03,24
231,Cold noisy room,"We were allocated a wheelchair friendly room because the hotel was fully booked, a bit ridiculous considering that I booked a family room 13 days in advance of our arrival. The room looked out onto a busy noisy street and had two huge Windows which meant a really bad nights sleep. The air conditioning unit was not working properly our room was freezing, to be fair to one of the girls on housekeeping she did offer me an electric heater but she said the air conditioning unit takes a while to heat up, so we went out for an hour and when we came back the room was still freezing but it was time for bed at that stage and too late to bother looking for electric heaters! The bracket holding the shower head was also broken meaning not a very pleasant shower. This was room 211 ",2,2016,03,24
231,Great location for a stay in Dublin,"Parnell St is an excellent, quiet location to tour the city on foot. Public transport is just across the street but you won't need it. Facilities are excellent and the staff are really friendly (but then everyone is in Dublin) and efficient. Planning to return to Dublin and stay here again.",4,2016,03,24
231,Great short stay,"We chose this hotel as it is very well located, easy to find and close to the main attractions. The airport bus dropped us just round the corner, and we were checked in and back to the middle of O'Connell St for the free Dublin walking tour 25 mins later (That is an excellent tour, check it out!). Reception staff were very efficient and friendly. We used the left baggage service on check in and check out and were issued luggage tickets and the bags secured in a locked room. Security is good, the lobby and 2nd floor bar/restaurant are open to the public, anywhere else requires key card access for lift/stairs. 
I had forgotten to print bus tickets and reception printed them without charge.

The room itself was clean and modern, had a kettle with tea/coffee. Bed was very comfortable, my only gripe was the wall was very close to one side of the bed, and I bashed my toe getting up. Room faced onto the main road outside, but no issues with noise, and a great view (top floor).

Breakfast has all the expected buffet options, and a card on the table suggests ask for anything else e.g. poached eggs. The staff were super efficient at clearing tables and kept on top of service. The hotel was very full and a sign in the lifts suggested breakfast may be busy at certain times - 7-8 green, 8-9 amber, 9-10 red. The hot buffet opened another side at busier times and queues were ok even then (3-4 people). Hot breakfast could have been warmer, it was a bit lukewarm, and at times items ran out. To be fair it was very busy.

Overall I would class this as an excellent stay. The hotel is popular with large tour groups, who use the lobby to congregate/organise themselves, but it is a large space and they seem to cope fine and be geared up for it.",5,2016,03,23
231,Good value for family trip,"Visited early December 2015. Family wedding trip. Hotel was friendly, busy and nice small bar area. Breakfast was all you could eat,self service. Was very busy at times, but food was of a good standard and set you up for the day.",4,2016,03,23
231,Nice hotel,City centre located and a very affordable price for a hotel in Dublin city centre. Close to all the main shopping streets and sights.Clean rooms and Friendly staff. Perfect for spending a weekend in Dublin.,4,2016,03,23
231,Dublin 2016,"Jurys on Parnell was booked because of its location. We were here during St.Patricks Day
was extremely close to parade, walking distance to Temple Bar area, Trinity College, shopping district, museums. Basic hotel rooms, shower/bath, amenities, no frills. Would have been nice to have refrigerators.",4,2016,03,23
231,If only the Internet was stable they had gotten a four ,"Stayed one night on a business trip.

Spacious rooms in a appealing design.

Restaurant is okay. Nothing special.

Internet not fast and stable enough to work from the hotel. Offered me an Internet up grade when checking out, please it can't be true that with the room rates they charge it can't be true.

Would recommend the hotel because of its location and spacious rooms.",2,2016,03,23
231,Impressed,"Lovely spacious room, great breakfast with plenty of choice, friendly staff and nice location! I had a great sleep and found the room and bathroom very comfortable. Not far to walk into the city and ideal location close to some shops to buy things.",5,2016,03,23
231,Good stay,"The hotel is very clean, and modern, we was checked in by a polite gentleman and felt dry welcome to the hotel.
Got to our room, and was very pleased, the only thing I'd say is the bathrooms definitely need updating there's very dated and a bit grubby, Also iv never been to a hotel that doesn't have a small safe in the rooms, but this one does not.
How ever was pleasant and was rather a good price for the room and breakfast so not too disheartened.
Another that needs to be addressed is the Wi Fi although free it was extremely slow and very weak, they wanted to charge you for a better quality Wi Fi but I think in this day and age they should be providing a good quality connection free and not see it as an opportunity to make money.
Overall good stay",4,2016,03,23
231,Great short break...,"The hotel is in a great position, literally around the corner from Dublin's shopping district and well within walking distance of the Temple Bar.  Rooms are very clean and well equipped.  Staff friendly and informative.  Overall, good value for money.  Would recommend.",5,2016,03,23
231,short trip to Dublin,Clean and comfortable.  Excellent breakfast choices.  Close to all shops and amenities. I have stayed at this hotel on a few occasions.  I find it clean and comfortable and close enough to the city centre not to need a taxi. There is a good selection of food available in the  bar at a reasonable price.  ,5,2016,03,22
231,Great place to stay....,"Check in was a breeze, breakfast buffet was very good. We enjoyed our stay at Jury's Inn. Wish we could have stayed at a Jury's Inn at the other locations we traveled to. Overall wonderful experience...",4,2016,03,22
231,Quality stay,"An excellent place to stay with very friendly staff that go out of their way to make your stay pleasant, comfortable and enjoyable. A great central location that enables you to see the heart of Dublin.",5,2016,03,22
231,Jury's Inn,"Staff very helpful and very  pleasant.
Nice clean hotel.
Very central for everything in the city centre..
Breakfast was standard Buffett style .
We also had a bar meal which was good and the bar staff were very helpful..",5,2016,03,22
231,Central but not a well kept hotel!,"It is great of you just want a central hotel! 
The rooms are outdated and the hotel itself wasn't very clean!
Bar in the hotel very expensive 
Gym facilities were not even worth being there : tiny room with one cross trainer , one treadmill and a couple of weights . It was like training in a cupboard ! 
Beds were very comfty! 

",3,2016,03,22
231,St Patrick's day,"I can't recommend the staff at the Jury's Inn enough! Had a lovely stay. The hotel was clean and comfortable. Would highly recommend. I enjoyed the buffet style breakfast, which had something for everyone.",5,2016,03,22
231,all good,"staff were very nice, rooms were very clean and nice, great location ,to see all 2016 , need to put toilets down stairs after a long drive toilets need ,,, but it was very good will be back again by the end of the year ",4,2016,03,22
231,A VERY ENJOYABLE STAY,"We stayed for three nights and it was a very comfortable and enjoyable stay.  The hotel is in an excellent location, just off O'Connell Street and a 10/15 minute walk to the Temple Bar area.  We did not think our room was too small, and it was certainly comfortable.  We found the staff to be courteous and helpful, and if we did ever visit Dublin again we would have no hesitation in choosing this hotel again.",4,2016,03,22
231,Very good hotel in the middle of all the Dublin action,"I stopped here for 2 nights in February 2016. On arrival we were greeted by very pleasant and helpful front desk staff. The room was spacious and very clean. The food in the restaurant was very good, although at breakfast it did get very busy. The staff gave us the option of getting food and taking it to the bar area or waiting for a table, and were found a table within 5 mins. 
The hotel bar was well stocked and well ran. One member of staff (a young gentleman named Tom I think) was very helpful and informative about the area and places to visit.
This hotel is in an ideal location for the sights and only a casual 10 minute walk to Temple Bar area and Jamesons, 20-30 minutes to The Guinness Factory.
I would stay here again for certain when visiting Dublin without a doubt.
Thank you to all the staff and management for making us feel so welcome.",4,2016,03,21
231,holiday and Saint Patrick's Day," I come from France with my family, to see the Saint Patrick's Day . We stay 4 days.  It is a wonderful inn , in the city center. Our room , for 3 persons, is very large , very beautiful!    All is very well  !",5,2016,03,21
231,Disappointed parking,Great hotel but our experience was tarnished by the No car parking at the hotel.  When we asked reception staff about parking they gave us a map to follow to a multi story car park across the city.....it took us an hour to get to it as we were unfamiliar with the roads (North Right Turns!) and a lot of diversions due to road works! Very stressful after a 3 hour journey!!,3,2016,03,21
231,Great central hotel!,I stayed in this hotel recently for one night and thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  The staff were friendly and the room itself was perfect.  The buffet breakfast was great and a wide selection was available (including non-dairy milk) which was perfect.  I would stay here again when I next visit Dublin.,5,2016,03,21
231,Enjoyable Stay,"We stayed for 2 nights and had an enjoyable time. We got there about 9 am after an early flight, as expected the rooms weren't ready but we were able to leave our bags in a luggage room and our passports/tickets in a safety deposit box. The room was ok our friends had a disabled room as requested and they were very happy with it. The breakfast was great, the drinks at the bar weren't expensive, we ate in the restaurant one night which was ok. The staff were helpful and polite, our return flight was an evening one but we were able to leave our belongings there until our taxi arrived. The hotel is in good position but we didn't hear any noise from outside.",3,2016,03,20
231,"Very small rooms, weird layout","Did not enjoy staying here. Rooms are tiny, layout is a maze so it takes forever to get to your room. Fire alarm went off in the middle of the night, all the fire doors closed, scary not knowing what was going on. Had to go to lobby at 2am to get an answer, someone was smoking in their room. The location is good, easy to get to main attractions. Atmosphere is very stale, no character. Wouldn't recommend for a tourist wanting Irish culture.",2,2016,03,19
231,Best stay for a city trip,The Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street is a nice hotel with a very good location for shopping and sightseeing. The staff is very friendly and the rooms are  clean and spacious. Can highly recommend the hotel!,5,2016,03,18

231,Good hotel,Stayed here for 5 nights for a work course. Room service left the room immaculate with bed linen changed daily. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Can't think of a negative. Second time I've stayed here and have already recommended to friends.,4,2016,03,17
231,"Worth booking, Central placed","Not so interested entre, very shy face out but well inside you meet a nice lounge area and a big book reception. Very service minded Staff with a warm welcome. Nice cleaned room mine have also a sofa and a char. Silent room but the view could be better instead of a parking place on the third floor :-) Breakfast typical English one, I missed the vegetables. The staff was very friendly and service minded",4,2016,03,17
231,Short stay.,"Just back yesterday from a short but enjoyable trip to Dublin, stayed at the Jurys Inn on Parnell Street and would definately stay there again, room 349 overlooking the courtyard was spacious, clean, quiet and well presented. Plenty of tea/cofee etc in room and shower gel/shampoo/handwash in bathroom, good powerful shower. Bar area is lovely and although drinks are expensive so is everywhere in Dublin, breakfast was really good, fresh tasty food and lots of it. Staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. On the last day there is a safe room to store your luggage until you are leaving. No safe in rooms so had to carry passports around with us, window opened in our room but rooms overlooking Parnell Street don't have windows that open. Roadworks right outside the hotel but as we overlooked the courtyard no trouble for us.
Good location for bus stops, we got the 747 airport express to and from the airport and used the hop on hop off buses.
Great stay and will be back.",5,2016,03,17
231,Great location for Dublin stay,"Stayed a couple of nights for a friend's 50th. A very smart hotel, with a pleasant bar lounge.  The rooms are really clean and comfortable.  Its a great location, a short walk along O'connell st to the Temple Bar area but the advantage of being free of noise. The breakfasts were excellent and the staff friendly and helpful.",4,2016,03,16
231,jury's inn parnell street,Family break two night break in the central of Dublin great location.  Everything you need is outside the hotel. Great security in the hotel as you needed your card key to get into the lift and to use the lift to your room .,4,2016,03,16
231,Great hotel in good location,"2nd stay at this hotel. Great location as near enough to walk to Temple Bar but far enough away to miss the noise. Hotel nice and clean, room also. Comfy beds and choice of pillows. We had the breakfast option and the only complaint that I could make was the dining room was very busy but it was a Sunday morning and only to be expected. ",5,2016,03,16
231,Over night visit,Stayed here for over night visit great location to city centre lovely bedroom bright and spotlessly clean very comfortable bed had a lovely breakfast great choice lovely coffee very friendly staff would stay here again.,5,2016,03,15
231,Very good central hotel,"Parnell Street is just a stone's throw from O'Connell Street so very good for getting about. The city sightseeing bus in good value as a hop on hop off way to get around Dublin and see the sights and you can pick this up very close by. The hotel is clean and modern and the rooms and bathrooms were of a good size and the shower worked very well. Our room overlooked the street where there were roadworks so was a bit noisy on occasion, but obviously  this is not a fault of the hotel.The staff we dealt with were all professional but friendly and didn't mind all my questions about transport issues !. We enjoyed our stay. ",4,2016,03,15
231,2- Night break,"In the quiet area of Dublin - so perfect if you want to walk down to temple bar but have a peaceful nights sleep as well.  
Very welcoming staff, room and bed very comfortable and the breakfast good selection and freshly made - would stop here again.  ;-)",4,2016,03,15
231,Okay.,"Hotel was clean and the breakfast was good.

Some draw backs included a whole heap of work outside the door which started early morning which could be heard through the window. The website has no mention about this and I felt this was a little unfair.",4,2016,03,15
231,Fab hotel and briliant Location,"Stayed here for 3 nights in March, had an early morning flight and arrived at the hotel at 9:30am had the room straight away which was nice as we could freshen up. Had a late flight coming home but could leave luggage in the luggage room at hotel which was great. Room was lovely,big and clean and had everything there we wanted. We had breakfast but didnt have an evening meal here. lots of choice for breakfast,  cereal,yogurts,fruit,toast,full english and lots of choice for drinks. what i loved the most about this hotel was you needed your room key to use the lift and use the bar toilets, felt very safe. 
the location is fab,tesco opposite hotel and lots of shops.  just around the corner from O'connell Street where the Hop On Hop Off bus was which i highly recommend, can get around Dublin. would recommend The Old Jameson Distillery (if you like whiskey) , Guinness StoreHouse and  Dublin Zoo. we also wanted to do the Whiskey Museum but didnt have time. Temple Bar is about 10mins walk from the hotel. lots of places to drink and eat. the Old storehouse pub was amazing, good food and entertainment also the River Bar just at the end of the O'connell street across the bridge. Drink prices - Budweiser 5.50euros,guinness 5 euros and vodka and coke about 8euros, glass of Rose approx 6euros thats what we found the cheapest other places can be more expensive.  
the hotel bar was similar prices. Next time I'm in Dublin i will be staying at the Jurys Inn, lovely staff, brilliant location. Highly Recommend.",5,2016,03,15
231,Weekend Break,Had a great weekend in Dublin with a group of friends.. Hotel was very central and clean.. Breakfast was fabulous far better than some 5 star hotels I have stayed at.. The staff were very helpful from check in to check out.. Had very good knowledge of Dublin and were able to assist us  with all questions asked..I would not hesitate to book the hotel again... ,5,2016,03,14
231,Enjoyable stay in a nice hotel in a great location.,I often stay in this hotel when I visit Dublin and always find it a very pleasant stay.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The rooms are comfortable and clean. The restaurant is good value.  It's in a great location - very central.  I would definitely recommend it.,5,2016,03,14
231,Need more choice of food for evening meals,"The hotel was great and the staff were very friendly. My room was spot on and very comfortable. The food was great but there needs to be more choice, after spending two weeks I was getting a bit bored of the little choice but like I said the food was great but defiantly needs a bit more choice. ",5,2016,03,14
231,It's always a great stay at Jury's Inn Parnell Street,"I stayed on an overnight at Jury's Inn Parnell Street on a recent business trip to Dublin. I availed of a member's non-refundable rate of €84.15 room only which is excellent value given this hotel's location.
In recent years, this hotel has been refurbished and my room was cosy and very comfortable and had everything I needed for a relaxed night's stay.
My special requests regarding my room were all met and the receptionist was warm, welcoming and professional.
I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel - and will stay again undoubtedly.",5,2016,03,14
231,Great location!,"Friendly staff, very clean hotel, rooms a good size, good bar and great location for the main areas of Dublin. I would definitely stay here again.  Particular shout out to the consierge who was very friendly, helped us out each day with maps, directions and general queries. All round a good experience ",5,2016,03,14
231,Clumsy staff,"Check in and out fine, rooms were basic bathrooms very outdated I haven't seen a bath like that for years! We visited Dublin for a friends birthday, which I stated on the special request form, they put the birthday card in the wrong room with a plate of fruit? Also I asked the staff at breakfast to bring over a birthday cake as a discrete surprise, instead the staff came over and asked my friend when she would like her cake. We complained and the staff just didn't seem to grasp the issue. Rooms also didn't get cleaned over the weekend, hence no clean towels.",1,2016,03,14
231,"Great service, nice room, and food!","I stayed here overnight for a flying visit for Dublin for work. Due to travel arrangements I ended up arriving in Dublin very early in the morning having not slept for about 24 hours. The staff were very helpful in organising an early check in for me so I was able to get some sleep way before I should have even been checking in.

I later had a lovely meal in the bar of the hotel. The room was comfortable, clean and well-equipped. Shame I was only staying for the one night.",5,2016,03,13
231,"Friendly staff, great location ","We stayed here for 2 nights in February half term. The location was great - a 2 min walk from the airport bus stop at Parnell Square. We'd walk down to Temple Bar on an evening which doesn't take long at all. We found it close enough to the action but far enough away from any noise! 
The staff were so friendly and helpful and there was a great choice for breakfast.  The rooms were clean and a good size. We'd definitely stay again. ",5,2016,03,13
231,Excellent hotel,Stayed here in March 2016. Very helpful reception staff. Very clean. Lovely hotel food and breakfasts. Situated just off O'connell street (Main Street of Dublin). Highly recommend this hotel. And best of all a store to keep your luggage until you need to leave for the airport even after you have checked out! ,5,2016,03,13
231,8:00 is the end of the rest in this hotel,"Every day, employes entering door next to our room woke us up. Every day it startem at 8;00 and about 100times opened and closed door very loudly!

WiFi OK, breakfast OK, room (small) OK.

Hotel has very good position and you Čan reach all places by walk in few minutes.",1,2016,03,13
231,excellent location,"we stayed on the second floor near the restaurant and bar. the hotel is in a great location for walking to pubs both local and touristy Temple Bar area, shopping, tour pick up sites and historic locations.  bus and tram service nearby, easy to get to the train station from here as well.  staff were friendly and professional.  although we only had breakfast at the hotel we are certain that it would be just as good if not better.  the bar in the hotel was very good with the bartender making conversation with you.  friendly staff, made the Irish are friendly slogan true. we would definitely come back and stay at this hotel.",5,2016,03,12
231,Dublin trip.,"Took in a play at The Gate, just around the corner and the Hugh Lane Museum; never miss this, just up the road.
Good location for shops. Good value two course dinner booked on line. Left my luggage so convenient.",5,2016,03,12
231,Great hotel in central DUblin,Arrived early morning room wasn't ready but we could leave our luggage in a secure room while we went to explore. Hotel just off Oconnell street where u can catch the red bus and have a tour of the city 10 mins walk to temple bar and Henry street shopping. Check in no problem room big 1double bed and 1 single room overlooked front of hotel and there is a telco across the road.Bathroom and shower very clean.

231,"Enjoyable, well located","Stayed 4 nights here in Feb 2016 as a solo traveller. 

Pro's:
Hotel was clean and well presented.
Staff were happy to help and were able to print my boarding pass for me for free - which i was grateful for. 
Hotel has arrangements with parking stations nearby, and was able to park at Q-Park, Clerys a few streets away. Was a bit of hard work with two suitcases and a bag on my back, but i managed. Sadly this is one of the drawbacks from staying somewhere so central.
Location was excellent, was right where i wanted to be. Close by to shops and fast food for a quick bite if you are just wanting to eat light or quick!. 
There is a laundromat service not far away in Gardiner street i found this a good option for getting my clothes washed whilst i go sight seeing and i returned the following day to collect. 

Cons: 
Distance from parking station to Hotel. (hotel might need to provide clear options on their website as i had to phone up to enquire about this!). 
Wi-fi is very slow. Found that i had to pay for a BETTER internet connection.",4,2016,03,12
231,Return visit,Stayed here a few years ago and our return visit was great . Friendly welcoming staff who provide very good customer service. This time we had a corner room on the second floor  which was in excellent condition and provided everything you need -including an iron /ironing board /tea &coffee making . Free wifi throughout hotel . Great choice of breakfast was included in our room rate . Only negative I would say is dining room gets very busy at peak times for breakfast and can be difficult to find a table -they do however say you can take food to the bar area when this happens .  Great location just off the top  of O'Connell St  where airport bus stops . Plenty of restaurants /bars closely . Supermarket across the road . Would definitely stay here again,4,2016,03,11
231,Jury's Inn Parnell Street Dublin,"My first time staying here in the Jury's Inn Parnell Street Dublin. The overall standard of the Hotel and the exceptional service from the staff was second to none. The room was in immaculate clean condition. Always greeted with a smile. If anyone would like to know where a great hotel to stay would be, I would certainly with a whole heart recommend their stay to Jury's Inn Parnell Street Dublin.",5,2016,03,11
231,Dublin again.......but a different hotel,"A 3 day break to celebrate 40th wedding anniversary in our favourite city, Dublin.
As always, it's a great place for a short break, but we went for a city centre hotel as we were not attempting to travel afar.
This hotel hits the spot, about a near as you need to the centre of the city, quiet, excellant and helpful staff and very clean and comfortable.
Our eating was restricted to breakfast which was excellant, overall, plenty of choice which is the most important
",4,2016,03,11
231,Checking in,On checking in with the lovely EVA it was found that i was booked into a different Jurys hotel in Dublin (incorrect booking by the company not the hotel) ... Eva handled the situation both professionally and efficiently ... the hassle was taken away from us as it was dealt with by herself. With staff like Eva the guests will always remember their stay for the right reasons. ,5,2016,03,11
231,Brilliant hotel and central,"Everything is exceptional at this hotel. The staff, the rooms, the breakfast.  If you're stopping in Dublin and what somewhere to stay. You don't do better than Jury's Inn.

The only let down is, We got a cheaper rate booking through an agent, which causes issues if you have questions as you are dealing with a third or fourth party!

Be nice if Jury's offered 'direct' what we got through the agent. ",5,2016,03,11
231,On the whole - None-To-Shabby,Booked the hotel because of the breakfast reviews. I wouldn't exactly rave about it - but it was adequate. Best thing was the friendliness of the staff. Room was nice - but only what you'd expect for a chain.,4,2016,03,11
231,Very good staff,"Stayed here for a few days break
With  my husband. 
It was really good  all the staff very accomodating & helpful nothing too much trouble 
(We even got our room early )
Breakfast  was amazing & poached eggs perfect....
A very good latte too ! 
",5,2016,03,11
231,Thank you Eva,"I have stayed in jury's inns all over Ireland and the UK recently for work. However, it was a member of the reception staff, Eva , in Parnell st. that really stood out as exceptional.
She was so efficient, friendly, and really helpful in getting myself and my team sorted. Well done Jury's, she's definitely an asset. We'll be back again soon.",5,2016,03,10
231,Jury's inn Parnell street Dublin,"Fantastic hotel. Great standards & location. Would highly recommend. The breakfast was really good, excellent staff nothing too much trouble. Best hotel I have stayed in for awhile on a city break. Great value for money ",5,2016,03,10

231,"10/10 - great, highly recommended hotel","We stayed as a couple in Dec 2015 and everything from start to finish was spot on. We were given a choice of rooms on arrival - the one we chose wasn't quite ready so we were advised to go to the bar for a free drink, which we did. 
We had our drinks in the excellent bar and half an hour later, the receptionist came up with our keys. 
Our room was excellently furnished - as good as any 4star hotels we've stayed in
Food in the restaurant and bar was very good too - in fact on our next visit to Leeds we changed our hotel from a Hilton to a Jury's and had a similarly good experience. 
We'll definitely be back.",5,2016,03,10
231,Dublin stay,"Great location, staff helpful and so nice at every encounter! Great place to stay !! Room was comfortable, lived the water downstairs and bar and breakfast were both top notch! We would stay here again and recommend to anyone that wants to be near the action in Dublin. Quick, easy walk to Temple Bar",5,2016,03,09
231,Very good hotel and stay in Dublin,"Stayed here for two nights Friday 4th & Saturday 5th March. The hotel is spotlessly clean, rooms modern, spacious and warm, staff very friendly and helpful, breakfast delicious and plenty of choice. We liked the card security for the entrance, lifts & rooms. If we came back again to Dublin we would definately stay here. The only critism we had was the roadworks noise started outside before 8am on a Saturday morning and they had knocked off by dinner time, but this isn't the fault of the hotel. We stayed in room 412 at the front of the hotel.",4,2016,03,09
231,Average,"In a rougher area of Dublin but convenient to get most places on foot. Past reviews state the breakfast was good, we didn't think so. Cheep sausages , oily fried potatoes and dried out bacon and black pud. The fresh orange juice separated in the glass where it had been watered down with water floating to the top of the glass. Room was big and the staff are friendly it's ok for a weekend visit but there is another Jury's inn nearer to the temple bar area which might be more suited to tourists / couples , this one seemed more of a stop for business meetings. ",3,2016,03,09
231,Nice hotel,"Good value, clean large rooms, good breakfast. Taxis always available. A 10 minute walk to trinity college, temple bar. Would stay again.Friendly staff that were very helpful.

231,Jurys inn parnell st,"Very nice hotel, modern rooms, with decent air conditioning, that actually warms the room.
 Food in the bar was pretty good also, decent pint of guinness served also. Friendly and polite staff at reception and in the bar.
 Lots of food places nearby, mc donalds, kfc, burger king, tesco. ",4,2016,03,09
231,Wonderful long weekend in Dublin,"This hotel is central to all major extractions, near great shops, and supermarkets so you can have a great weekend on a budget. 
We went to the Church restaurant for dinner Satruday night a real treat fantastic venue and atmosphere, for young and old.
Travelled to the coast Bray by train on Mothers Day and did a short coastal walk really great.
The grave diggers tour really funny, the guide or actors made it informative not sure how much was based on truth but it was a great evening with a drink at a local pub really enjoyed this tour as well as the Hop on Hop off bus tour.
Pauline Scarborough great guide for the walking tour of Dublin and would recommend her as she was very balanced in her views on difficult topics with wonderful knowledge of the city thanks",4,2016,03,08
231,Great location,"Very good location, we went everywhere on foot. Great staff, always very helpful and very friendly. Awful pillow and lousy mattress, woke me up many times during the night. It's a pity because the room was spectacular!

231,Good value hotel,"The hotel is well located and the value is excellent if you consider the size of the rooms and the friendliness of the staff (and also the breakfast which is very good). We had a lovely time there !
Be careful to go to breakfast early because there are many people and sometimes no tables are left.",4,2016,03,08
231,Short Business Trip,"Lovely hotel in an ideal location just off O'Connell Street. Room was fine, bathroom was fine. Clean hotel. Nice little bar. Breakfast was fine the following morning. Reasonable price. Taxis available outside the main door. I would return and stay here again.",4,2016,03,07

The staff at the hotel were helpful and friendly, particularly the concierge. He assisted with all of queries from getting about the city to tourist attractions. The rooms were a descent size given the city centre location and breakfast was varied and of good quality.

231,Great Stay,"We stayed in a double room for 2 nights, in which we paid £132 which was a bargain. Check in was quick and we had a room on 3rd floor which was perfect. The bedroom was spacious with a sofa and a very comfy double bed. When staying here it was my birthday and i had a well presented plate of fruit and a letter wishing me a Happy Birthday, which was a really nice touch. The Hotel is close to everything in Dublin and a only a 10 minute walk away from Temple Bar. WiFi was free throughout the hotel, but was slow in some cases, but you could pay for an upgrade for better WiFi if you wanted to do so. We really enjoyed our trip to Dublin and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. Thank you.",5,2016,03,01
231,2 night stay,"Stayed for two nights.Only complaint was single bed not comfortable. Daughter slept in double bed and had no complaints.Breakfast was as it should be, nothing special but no complaints. Would stay again as location ideal for shopping but car park suggested by hotel is a fair trek away.
",4,2016,03,01
231,Dublin break,"Excellent service and rooms , breakfast times was a bit overcrowded (could do with expanding eating area ) 
Construction noise was a bit excessive but that was no fault of Jury's Inn

231,Great hotel for business trip,"I stayed here on a business trip, and it was perfect. The room was nice with a good, soft bed. There was no excess noise. The free wifi worked fine for email and most things and when I needed to upgrade for a web conference, that worked well too. My room rate included breakfast in the morning which was good and well managed by the staff who were always friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a good location right around the corner from O'Connell street and within walking distance of interesting parts of Dublin. There's a Tesco right across the street for necessaries and a great shopping area within a block. The front desk staff gave excellent directions to where I could pick up my bus to get back to the airport on my way out. Couldn't ask for more.  ",5,2016,02,29
231,Great weekend,"Poor selection of Whiskeys, you could with a good selection of Scotch and Irish, Especially when people a siting in to watch Rugby.Security in corridors was good and keys worked well.

I have already mentioned no Toilet Bruse",4,2016,02,29
231,Smashing Hotel,"We stayed for three nights bed and breakfast and only had a couple of minor niggles that prevent a five star rating from us.

The staff were all fantastic, very friendly, helpful and cheerful. We never met one member of staff who didn't say hello as they passed us and always a smile.

The room was clean, warm and comfortable. The shower good with lots of hot water but the shower head is fixed and this is one of my minor niggles.

To use the lifts you have to insert your key card and then your floor....sometimes it worked first time but others it didn't and resulted in us...and many other guests......going to floors we didn't want to be on or going down instead of up....was a pain to be honest and we started using the stairs even though we were on the fifth floor...kept us fit anyway.

We ate breakfast everyday which was lovely. However the hotel is a very busy one and breakfast time a manic time for the restaurant and they struggle to keep up with the demand especially for eggs. We were also unable to sit in the actual restaurant with our breakfast as all tables were always full so we had to sit in the bar area. This isn't a complaint about breakfast time....it's so busy that delays and lack of tables couldn't be avoided and it is run very efficiently in my opinion.

We had one meal in the evening in the restaurant and it was first class, cooked to perfection and the staff attentive but not intrusive. Absolutely five stars for this meal.

The bar was lively a lot of the time and also cheaper than the pubs nearby...an unusual situation but not unwelcome as Dublin is an expensive city to visit.

I doubt we'll return to Dublin as we've been a few times now but if we did I would definitely want to stay in this hotel again. The location is also perfect.",4,2016,02,29
231,Great Service,"On arrival we were met by a very friendly member of staff who wished us a pleasent stay, Check in very efficient our room was lovely, warm clean ,fresh and our bed was very comfortable tea and coffee making services were available ,Cost of stay per night just right,Breakfast fantastic ,Check out friendly and again very efficient,Would stay here again",5,2016,02,29
231,close the centre and all public transport.,"lovely hotel, prime location, nice decor, friendly staff. Great breakfast. Easy to get from and to the airport. We took the local bus back to airport and it just went up the road, did only take about 10 minutes more then the airport bus.",5,2016,02,29
231,Excellent value for money,"My 4 friends and I stayed here in 2 rooms for a saturday night stay.  We were very pleasantly surprised by this hotel.  The rooms were roomy and also very clean and comfortable.  They were equipped with an iron and board, hairdryer , tea and coffee and also provided showergel and shampoo.  The staff were all pleasant and helpful and in particular when it became apparent our pre booked airport transfer failed to collect us at the end of our stay.  They sorted another taxi for us with no problem.  We had breakfast included with our room price and this was an excellent breakfast.  A mix of continental and cooked which we all thoroughly enjoyed!! There is also a very nice bar area.  The location is perfect just around the corner from O'Connell street and only a 10/15 minute walk to temple bar.  We would all highly recommend this hotel and we would all definately book here again without hesitation.  Excellent value for money.",5,2016,02,29
231,Great hotel in dublin,"Ideal location, can hop on & off buses easily & can transfer to & from airport easily . Beautiful hotel . All staff friendly but expect the stag & hen parties to keep you up at night, twice we had to ring for porter as it sounded like they were having party outside our door. Hotel food was excellent & reasonably priced drinks. Would go back ",5,2016,02,29
231,Perfect long weekend in Dublin.,"Travelled with family and friends. Great hotel ideally situated.. Rooms clean and tidy with all amenities provided. Staff were superb, very friendly and helpful. Food in restaurant was great and good value for money, likewise the service and drinks in the bar. Would highly recommend and will definitely stay here again.",5,2016,02,29
231,Great Hotel,"The missus, daughter and I stayed here for a couple of nights during our weekend break to Dublin. We found the hotel excellent in every way.
The hotel is just round the corner from O'Connell Street where the Aircoach stops and also where many bus stops are. The main shops are a 5 minute walk away as is the tram which can take visitors to Phoenix Park (zoo), Heuston station, the Guinness Storehouse and the 3 Arena. Temple Bar is a 10 to 15 minute walk and Croke Park is within walking distance too.
Our room was modern and the beds were comfortable and despite the additional bed, there was still enough room to move around the room with ease. The bathroom was functional, if a little 'tired'. Our room overlooked the courtyard in the centre of the hotel so it had a quiet outlook, however we were disturbed by other guests returning from their Saturday nights out on our first night. Little blame can be attributed to the hotel for this, but it was simply blatant disregard for those sleeping (or trying to) when they returned worse for wear! On the second night we found the room too warm to sleep so had to open the window for ten minutes to cool the room down.
The buffet breakfasts were excellent with a large choice of foods, both continental and full Irish, although mushrooms and hash browns were conspicuous by their absence. On the Sunday morning peak breakfast time seemed to be around 9am when there was an insufficient number of free tables. On the Monday many guests had left so there was no repeat.
The bar area was very pleasant and, with Guinness only €5.30 a pint, in our experience it was only slightly more expensive than the city centre pubs. It also had Sky Sports showing.
Wi-Fi was free throughout though you have to register using an e-mail address to use it.
All-in-all, we had an excellent short break in Dublin and the hotel proved to be an excellent all round base.",5,2016,02,29
231,2 night stay,booked this hotel for a weekend break great central location. when we arrived got a bit concerned over the amount of stag and hen party revelers but had no need to worry with the staff and the concierge being in full control. rooms were well equipped and clean. buffet breakfast was great -set you up for the day had a meal in the hotel restaurant which was good value and delicious. all in all great weekend,5,2016,02,27
231,Nice hotel,"We had a very pleasant stay in this hotel. 
The location of this hotel is very central with public transver nearby. The staff is very fiendly. The basic rooms are gooed with coffee and tea. I would book it again. ",4,2016,02,26
231,Lovely,"Spent a lovely few days here. Good, central location close to many restaurants, pubs, bars, shops and shopping malls. Murray's bar just around the corner with lovely Irish music and dancing every night. Nice, comfortable room with lovely, friendly and helpful staff. No complaints!",4,2016,02,26
231,Great value,"Brilliant hotel, great value for money and good location. I stayed with two friends and the room as a good size. Staff were friendly and everything was within walking distance with the main bus services outside the hotel for any tourist attractions that are further afield. ",5,2016,02,26
231,Brilliant,"On arriving at Dublin and being dropped off with air coach,quite a distance from the hotel,I was a bit worried at the surrounding area of the hotel.Check in was done quickly,friendly reception staff.Stayed at quite a few on the jury's inn in the uk and this was exactly the same,our room was very clean,nice comfy beds.We are not big drinkers but did have  a few drinks in the hotel bar the first night,nice atmosphere,which you don't always get in a hotel.Breakfast was great,selection was very good,always being topped up with fresh items,always hot! Coffee was bit to strong for us but it's probably that way to cure all hangovers from a night in Dublin.All staff were great,especially the chap taking cases etc.would definitely recommend this hotel",5,2016,02,26
231,Weekend trip to dublin,Location of hotel is great - central. Rooms really clean. Staff very friendly and welcoming.  Perfect for weekend away as really good value for money.  Loads of pubs in surrounding area and places to eat just minutes away.,5,2016,02,25
231,Good value,"Good value hotel. Ideal location as just off O'Connell street where the buses run and lots of shops and restaurants. 
We had breakfast included in our room rate, the selection of continental and cooked breakfast was great for us. 
Rooms are good size, comfy beds, clean and provide amenities.
Friendly, helpful staff. 
Would recommend.",5,2016,02,25
231,Helpful Staff,"Stayed with friends for two nights in February and I was really impressed with the how helpful all members of staff were especially when checking in and out of the hotel! The hotel was clean, rooms were a good size and the beds were very comfortable. The hotel is a short walk away from the Temple Bar area just down the main road and across the bridge and cost half the price some of the hotels the other side of the bridge were charging! I will be considering this hotel again on my next visit. ",5,2016,02,25
231,Good hotel and decent location.,"Situated about 5 mins walk from the center, this hotel is greatly situated. The room was comfortable, although we did have a bit of a problem with the air-conditioned as it was cold in the room, we managed to fix it so that it was warm

The room was clean to some extent it may sound picky but on the hinges of the bathroom  door there was dust accumulated which was thick. Also the bathroom door lock was not working. We had breakfast which was lovely but I would suggest maybe having English breakfast tea.

I would definitely go back and stay here It's a great place and very relaxing with a great atmosphere!",4,2016,02,25
231,Enjoyed our stay....,"Hotel was clean, efficient and staff were welcoming. Rooms were fine. No noise, lifts all working fine and an excellent breakfast. This was our 4th trip to Dublin and first to Parnell Street, there are a few unsavoury characters in the area around the hotel so not sure we'd stay again but once inside the hotel no problems at all. ",4,2016,02,24
231,Decent enough but customer service needs work,"8 of us stayed in this hotel 3 nights in February 2016, or rather we should have stayed 3 nights but it ended up being 2 nights and a night in another jury's Inn across town. When we arrived around midnight They told us that a water pipe had burst flooding all 4 of our rooms.  Dubious or what?  They organised a taxi to take us to their sister hotel and they gave us a free round of drinks and some crisps while we waited. In the morning they booked us a taxi to get back to the first hotel but it was over an hour late so they had to pay for 2 private cabs for us instead. 

They charged us the wrong amount for our rooms which meant we then had to pay more when we left. Not ideal. They did give us all a free dinner and 2 bottles of wine. A manager  called jenny said we could have drinks with our meal but then came later and told us that the 2 bottles of wine were the drinks and we'd have to pay for the other drinks we'd ordered!  

A lot of mix ups and misunderstandings if you ask me. 2 different taxi drivers told us that it is standard practice for this hotel to double book late arrivals and if both sets of guests turn up they'll ship you to the other hotel. Not the end of the world but it's not what you need at the end of a long day. 

The hotel itself is actually very nice. Comfy bed, well furnished, excellent wifi, a small gym and a good location.  Breakfast was mediocre but you can eat as much as you like so that suits me fine!  Dinner was really good but I wouldn't have eaten it if it wasn't free as the prices are sky high.  Drink prices in the bar are laughable too. I wasn't impressed by a barmaid telling me that I can't be in the restaurant for breakfast without shoes. Had I not already finished eating I would have made more of an issue of this. She is there to serve drinks, not to lay down the law. 

Overall it was a decent hotel but their customer service needs a good overhaul so because of that it's only 3 out of 5 I'm afraid. ",3,2016,02,23
231,Great stay,"Stayed with a group of girlfriends to celebrate a friends birthday.
rooms were clean ( no safe)and tidy however we were bit disappointed that we were all spread throughout  the hotel on different floors although we had requested to all be together. Bar area was lovely and staff very accommodating.
Breakfast was very busy but choice was good and plenty to choose from close to all  amenities and nightlife walkable or short taxi ride to temple bar ",4,2016,02,23
231,Excellent Hotel and near to shops,"Double room was clear and tidy. No problems with heating etc. Bedding good. Room looked onto the centre of the hotel so no view, but not a problem. Carpeted halls so minimal noise at night. Close to shopping main street and 10 min walk to river. Breakfast was very good, plenty of choice. All staff excellent and helpful. Front desk especially. No safe in room but free in reception. Long weekend break, just right. Longer I would have hired a car, but be aware no parking at hotel itself. I would return to this hotel.",5,2016,02,23
231,Nice Hotel,We had 2 nights here recently and cannot fault either the hotel or the friendly staff. Although we did not have dinner here the breakfast was very good with plenty of choise and thick cut bacon!! Not in the best area of town but there is a handy Tescos right opposite as well as some cafes and pubs to eat in.,4,2016,02,23
231,one huge mistake,"Generally like I said at the title ONE HUGE MISTAKE!!!  
Double booked rooms so no rooms for us when we came late at night (but they knew we will check in at night)bad resolutions bad organisation everything went wrong ",1,2016,02,23
231,"great location, great service, great hotel","stayed here for 3 nights for my boyfriend's 21st birthday and in the room we were welcomed with a happy birthday note and a lovely plate of fruit!
the hotel was in a great location, only about a 10 minute walk across the bridge to temple bar.

hotel and staff contributed to making it a very enjoyable stay and we would be certain to stay here again if we returned to Dublin.",5,2016,02,23
231,Overnight for rugby international,Hotel is perfectly located just off the top of Dublin's main street O Connell street. Check in was perfect. Our room was as requested twin bed. Good size. Great shower and most important spotlessly clean.,4,2016,02,23
231,Overall 10/10,Few hiccups but after them unbelievable service so friendly staff very apologetic and even had a free mini gym there treadmill exercise bike weights and a stepper very happy food amazing not expensive  ,5,2016,02,23
231,Short stay in Dublin,We only had a day and a half in Dublin and just needed a place to crash at night.  The hotel is centrally located to most attractions.  Family of 4 had a family room and it was a bit cramped but made due.  Clean hotel and friendly staff.  Fit the bill.,4,2016,02,23
231,Perfect stay,"We stayed here for two nights and it was excellent.hotel was close to shops and short walk to temple bar and good restaurants.staff helpful and check in was quick.Room was nice,clean and very comfortable.slept really well.breakfast was good and had a wide choice.would stay here again and recommend.10/10",5,2016,02,22
231,Perfect city centre location.,"I stayed here on business for a few nights. Great location off Dublin's main street.
The bed was really comfy. The staff were extremely friendly & helpful. I ate there two evenings & the food was very good.
Would definitely recommend.",5,2016,02,22
231,50th Birthday trip,"Excellent location, great facilities and superb staff. Bar area and general facilities within the hotel were beyond our expectations , coupled with a real value for money by booking            9 months in advance.
We couldn't fault the hotel in any way.",5,2016,02,22
231,Good quality for a reasonable price,"Modern decor in all public areas such as reception, bar, restaurant as where the rooms themselves. Hallways and bathrooms a little dated however but overall a nice hotel with all you need in short walking distance",4,2016,02,22
231,Jury's inn Parnell st Dublin,"Very happy with out stay, no faults. Have 6 month old baby and a travel cor and fridge were provided without fuss. Room clean and all staff were very helpful especially when we lost our teddy!
Have stayed before and would have no hesitation staying again.",5,2016,02,22
231,A lovely stay in Dublin,The hotel is very conveniently located for all the city attractions as well as getting to and from the airport with ease. The hotel was always clean and tidy and the staff were always helpful and attentive. Breakfast was great too! ,4,2016,02,22
231,Great hotel and location ,"We arrived on Friday morning as a hen group, we had 3 rooms and all were clean and spacious, just what we needed. Their was a room to store our bags till we could check in. All staff were very friendly and helpful and breakfast was very nice, although very busy. The only down side was the restaurant. We decided to eat in on the Friday night and for saying their was only one other table the food took ages, 2 of our group had actually finished there meals before the last 1 came out and most was either over cooked or very bland, we cancelled our desserts as we didn't want to wait any longer. We did complain as it isn't cheap and we expected better, the manager was very nice and took off a bottle of wine from our bill and asked us to the bar the Saturday night were we all got a free drink. I would definitely stay at the jury's inn again but would certainly avoid the restaurant. ",4,2016,02,22
231,Nice family break,"We stayed for 3 nights in the middle of February. We were able to book 2 connecting rooms, which was super (my wife and 2 daughters in one room and myself and my son in the other). Everything in the hotel was fine. Tea/coffee facilities as expected. Could have done with a channel guide for the TV, as the electronic guide on the TV itself did not mention any of the UK channels, but they were available. Strange! Good location just at the end of O'Connell St, very close to lots of shopping, etc.",4,2016,02,22
231,Good hotel downtown Dublin,"I stayed for three days at the hotel. The front desk staff was checking us in even while it was around 13.00 Lt. The room was not to big, but no complains about that. Unfortunally, a safe was lacking at the room. Wi-Fi connection through the entire hotel. Breakfast was oke. Nothing special but the coffee was above the standard!",3,2016,02,22
231,Dublin Visit,"Good value for money overall. Good central Dublin location. Access to Public Traffic services. Close to historical and cultural sites. Good welcome and service from staff,
Clean and restful bedrooms 
This section os far too long.
",4,2016,02,22
231,All was great to be honest,"We had a great time a nice few days in Dublin, just me and my friend, the staff where great and the food was too. The check in was easy as was the check out.
I think my only hick up would be confusion with drink order and food order but then that would be more language problem but other than that it was great :-)",4,2016,02,22
231,weekend away,"2nd time staying at hotel, great location for all attractions, comfortable rooms/beds, on suite bathroom/shower. Lovely breakfast with lots of choice and staff helpful and friendly. Checkout time 12pm which is good. Hotel has facility to leave luggage in secure room; they also have a system in place to ensure your luggage is safe.
Ice machines and vending machines located throughout hotel.",5,2016,02,21
231,Valentine's weekend ,Stayed here on the 12th February hotel is lovely and staff where very friendly breakfast is also very nice. The rooms are a good size very clean and comfortable only problem we had was the room wasvery hot causing us a lack off sleep we tried to turn down on the heating dial but we couldn't find any instructions. You have to leave the room at 10 am out flight wasn't until 9:54pm we was very tired after a bad nights sleep other than that it is a lovely hotel. And would definitely recommend for anyone wanted a fun trip to Dublin and a good distance to the temple bar.,4,2016,02,21
231,One night stop,"Hotel was just what we needed. Close to everything that was going on but quiet and really comfortable. Breakfast was fine, but they did keep running out of things at peak times. Staff were really helpful, sorting out bags before and after our stay.",5,2016,02,21
231,Fine if you survive wlecome at Reception desk !!,"Initial room in a very poor condition...for persons with reduced mobility..we have been proposed easily a replacement room, but not in a nice manner..we have also attended a strange show of a rude reception desk member being absolutely rude with a chinese lady, having some difficulty to speak English...",2,2016,02,21
231,Friendly hotel and very security concious,We were given a room for disabled people which we did not ask for as neither of us is. Don't quite know why. We wanted a security box but they only had them in reception open for anyone to see what we had.  I lost my purse I think it got left in reception after I used the security box.  It was never handed in which was most upsetting and put a dampening on the whole week. As for the hotel it is fairly quiet and you do not hear people in the next rooms which is very good.  The breakfast was very good. The staff friendly.  Nice modern hotel.,4,2016,02,21
231,Brilliant,We stayed here for two nights and loved it. We arrived on Valentine's Day at around 11am and despite the fact we were the  had arrived too early to check in the staff were very apologetic. We left our bags in the luggage room and returned much later on. We had a basic double room which was lovely and very clean. Bathroom small but big enough for two. All staff were very friendly and made you feel welcome. Bar prices were similar to other bars in Dublin. Ideal location for many local amenities and everything was in walking distance for us.it was our first time in Dublin and at a Jury's inn but we would definitely return!,5,2016,02,20
231,"nice hotel, restaurant is a let down, though.","Room was lovely and clean, but the restaurant was lacking everything, you'd expect from a restaurant. Staff was incompetent, we waited over an hour for our food, even though the place was not busy, we got no apology and the food was cold and bland.
Might stay here again but would definitely skip eating here.",3,2016,02,20
231,VERY GOOD HOTEL - BUT NOT A RELIABLE TAXI SERVICE?,"Six of us stayed here for three nights in February. The hotel is ideally & centrally located north of the River Liffey, close to O'Connell Street and the Henry Street shopping area. A somewhat ugly grey exterior gives way to a modern and smart interior with a large reception desk, comfortable furniture, three lifts, free drinks and a vending machine.
 
The receptionists seemed efficient and welcoming: we were issued plastic cards that helped to operate the lifts and gain access to bedrooms. We took advantage of the ability to leave luggage securely in two special rooms.

 All three of the rooms allocated to us were spacious, clean, functional and quite comfortable - though all of us had issues with the hard pillows and I had little real sleep. Despite the central location, the rooms were quiet and temperatures were easy to control. The rooms were cleaned and tidied well.

We enjoyed our stay and would heartily recommend this hotel - but not the taxi firm it insists on using. With flights to catch most guests need a reliable taxi firm if they are to catch their flights...we had booked a taxi for 6 people with luggage through the hotel reception the night before we left. We confirmed our booking the next morning and the time we wanted it (6pm). No one in reception seemed at all concerned that at 6:15 no taxi had appeared and eventually the duty manager appeared with apologies, saying that the taxi was on its way but couldn't guarantee to get us to the airport on time.

We were forced to split up and catch two separate taxis. The hotel should do much better and take more responsibility.",4,2016,02,20
231,Excellent location! ,"Not a bad word to say about this hotel. Excellent location, we were able to walk to all the main sights and there were plenty of places to eat near by. Checking in and out was quick and easy with friendly staff who are more than happy for you to leave your luggage if your room isn't ready. Rooms were clean and tidy and the beds were very comfortable. The free Wifi was good and accessible anywhere in the hotel. To top it all off it was very reasonably priced for a 3 night stay. Would definitely recommend! ",5,2016,02,20
231,Great Location but lacks good restaurants around,"The location is perfect for us. It's the second stop from the airport coach bus and the hotel is 2 minutes walk. There aren't a lot of good restaurants around. The burger and fish&chip place across the street is pretty good. There is also a Tesco across the street so you can get all your grocery.

The hotel itself is not bad at the cost. The only thing I hate is the elevator and the long corridor to get to your room. The elevator is slow and if you are on the the last room of the 2nd floor, it is going to take you 5 minutes from the lobby to your room. It's quite annoying especially after a long day of walking. ",4,2016,02,19
231,Hard to get to Clerys car park with road closures due to Luas upgrades,"Perfectly located hotel on foot. A bit tricky to get to with all the road works. We couldn't find the clerys car park for €10 a night and instead had to pay €18 a night for the car park behind the hotel. Apart from that, the hotel itself was very good. Breakfast was lovely,plenty on offer and staff were very friendly and attentive. Probably wouldn't return due to car parking charges but a grand hotel for walking distance to city centre attractions.",3,2016,02,19
231,Great stay,"Stayed here February booked as a gift from my daughter & son in law it's a great location for all the buses airport and tour bus, plenty of places to visit and eat around the area. The hotel is very clean and inviting. Easy check in at reception. Bedrooms clean to a high standard and  comfortable beds. Breakfast was great loads of chose from. Highly recommended this hotel.",5,2016,02,19
231,Excellent Location,"We stayed in Jurys Inn for a day,  on our way back to England, in July 2015.The hotel has an excellent location and we could cover all the main areas of the city on foot. The staff was friendly and efficient. The room was excellent and we had good , undisturbed nights sleep after a tiring day",5,2016,02,19

231,Brilliant stay,"Hen party trip to Dublin..
We stayed here and had such a great time would recommend it not to just hen party's but anyone as there were all types of customers there. 
The breakfast was exceptional! The staff were a great laugh and the rooms were lovely 
100% ",5,2016,02,17
231,Perfect location to see the city,We stayed here at the beginning of December with our 3 year old son. It is a perfect location to see the sights of Dublin although most sights in Dublin seemed to revolve around drinking so probably more of a group destination than family. The hotel was comfortable and clean and the breakfast was nice so would recommend.,4,2016,02,17
231,Excellent Value,"Stayed here for three nights over the Valentines weekend. Would definitely stay here again. the hotel is contemporary, clean, well run, peaceful and well situated. The breakfast offered is great value and a good start to the day. the bus stop for the airport is just around the corner as is a taxi rank. I was worried about stag and hen parties, for which Dublin is well known, but I needn't have worried. There was no noise issues and I have faith that any issues would be dealt with swiftly. 
   People don't often get the credit they deserve because I think most people are more likely to review when they have a bad experience, myself included, but the staff here should feel proud of themselves. Well done Jurys Inn Parnell Street.",5,2016,02,17
231,Holiday,"My husband and I spent three nights bed and breakfast in Parnell street. Location was central for everywhere. Breakfast was excellent, staff were friendly and helpful. Lovely atmosphere. Would recommend staying here.",5,2016,02,17

Our evening meal was lovely and the waitress was very friendly. Very central. Would definitely stay again.",5,2016,02,15
231,Good Hotel in a great central location.,"We had a pleasant two night, three day stay. Room was decent size and spotlessly clean. We arrived at 10:30 a.m but our rooms were available which we greatly appreciated. Good, substantial breakfast. Had some fun and games working out the lifts but overall would recommend the hotel.",4,2016,02,15

231,City Break for a 30th - Great stay,"I stayed at the Jurys Inn Parnell Street for a friends 30th recently. The staff at the hotel were really friendly and helpful, especially Przemeu! He was great, every day asked how we were, checking we were having a good time, offering advice for the area and travel and was a super happy face to see every day. The location of the hotel is good with easy transport links and there are lots of food places nearby and a Tesco's across the street. The hotel was well decorated, had clean facilities and the beds comfy. Breakfast was a good selection or hot and cold and wasn't stale/dry like you find at most hotel buffets. I found the hotel a little pricey for me (‎€480 for 2 nights between 3 people) but if I were to go back to Dublin I would likely come back to this hotel.
P.s There is a cool pub/bar just along from the hotel called The Parnell Heritage Bar & Grill, they played 50s/60's music both times we were in there, staff friendly, food was good (cajun chicken burger), lots fo tv's for sports and a decent smoking roof terrace.",4,2016,02,15
231,Great hotel ,"Stayed here for 2 nights and no complaints at all. Great location, around corner from bus links to airport. 10 minute walk to temple bar and pass loads of good pubs on the way. Clean room and a decent size. Shower was surprisingly good also. This was my second visit and will definitely be back.",5,2016,02,14
231,Great value and location,"Convenient to O'Connell St., very nice staff, comfortable, clean room, quiet.  Love the street view.  So many other things I love about it:  across from a great bookstore--Chapters; near a great shopping district, great pub nearby Parnell Pub & Grill, wonderful local restaurant across the street--Kingfisher; short walk to the Writer's Museum, convenient to airport buses. Great security with card key for elevator, and security guard at door at night and buzzing you in.  Can walk to Temple Bar and other spots easily.  Few quirky things about room: very shallow, but long bathtub, no soap or washcloth , or body lotion. Two soap dispensers bolted to wall convenient for shower or sink, but out of reach when in tub. Luckily Lush around corner, and many stores nearby to buy soap. Housekeepers great, and quick and efficient.  Never tried breakfast, so many great local places in neighborhood, healthier choices, not up for all the meat and fat in traditional breakfast. If you're on a budget, want to feel safe and be near the locals, place to be.",5,2016,02,14
231,Great stay!,"Friendly staff, clean facilities and overall calm relaxed stay with no problems , any requests I had were dealt with by staff quickly and efficiently I would definitely recommended this hotel to family and friends if they ever are in Dublin and will be sure to pay another visit when I'm next in the area ",4,2016,02,14
231,City Break,"Great transport links, airport bus stops just around the corner from the hotel, tesco just opposite the hotel, although advised to get public transport or taxis by hotel staff, you can walk everywhere, the jail is around a 45 min walk, Guinness factory a little less but close to the Jail, Temple bar is a short walk away, George's street I think it's called which is full of resturants and bars is around a 30 min walk, grafton street great for shopping is also within walking distance. As for the hotel itself, room was clean and as advertised, shampoo/shower gel, iron, hairdryer, extra pillows, towels all provided, there was no safe though, which I didn't see as an issue but just to make people aware. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful when asking for recommended resturants, places to go. Breakfast is fairly standard continental breakfast, you can ask for things that may not be displayed at breakfast we asked for poached eggs and they cooked them for us, no problem. All in all, good clean comfortable hotel, helpful staff, close to all sites and good amenities. ",4,2016,02,13
231,Excellent,"Excellent hotel, great central location. Staff were very friendly, helpful and efficient. Everything was above par here, the bar, restaurant and bedroom were all good. Would definitely stay here again",5,2016,02,13

231,"Honest room service, brill hotel","Very central hotel, clean, tidy, spacious and modern. About five min walk from temple bar. About 20 min walk to 'The Guinness storehouse' which was easy to find. Lots of shops and bars around hotel. Staff were brilliant including room service who were very honest. I'd had an expensive watch bought for me for Xmas and took this watch with me to the hotel..on leaving I must have dropped it on the floor behind my case and left without knowing. On arrival home I realised I didn't have my watch so rung hotel and they confirmed room service had handed it in n they would post it to me free of charge. It arrived today (took approx two days from first call) and im soooo pleased.  Honestly, I had no faith that it would be handed in but I must say they did and it made my year. Can't thank them enough. Lovely bar in hotel and great food. The staff couldn't do enough for us. Would deffo visit again. ",5,2016,02,13
231,Perfect location,"The location of this hotel was really good central to everything, it was handy that the tram station on Abbey Street was only 5 minutes away which we used to do all our touristy stuff. The rooms was nice, only downfall was i was expecting a complimentary toothbrush and toothpaste as you usually get in a hotels like this, but everything else i could not fault. The breakfast was really nice, worth paying extra to have it which had a lot of choices. I would return if i stay in Dublin again. ",4,2016,02,13
231,Very good price/value.,"This is a very good, well priced hotel in the middle of Dublin. Just a minute away from O'Connel street with a Tesco across the road. The room was very clean, great housekeeping and a stunning, proper breakfast. This was a very pleasant surprise. Great staff, just a good, stand up hotel.",5,2016,02,12

231,LOVELY HOTEL,"Lovely hotel in a great location - got the airport bus which stopped a short walk from hotel.
Staff were very friendly and always helpful. Room was lovely - bed comfy, tea/coffee facility/shower gel and shampoo - great housekeeping daily.
Breakfast was superb - we didn't use the restaurant in evening but had a drink in the bar - very reasonable price.
We did alot a walking from the hotel to shops as they were so nearby.
Thank you all at the Jurys Inn for making our stay so good :)",5,2016,02,12
231,Average,"No issues with the stay, it just wasn't the room that was described to us when we booked online. Everything was fine but the bath was very small (a bit like sitting in a large puddle). Might stay here again, but wouldn't be our first choice and would not pay full price. ",3,2016,02,12
231,WALES V IRELAND SIX NATIONS WEEKEND,"Staff very friendly and helpful. The standard and cleanliness of the rooms was excellent.

231,Excellent,"Spent a couple if days as first time visitors to Dublin and this hotel ticked all the boxes.
The position was superb just off OConnell  St and within 10/15 min walking distance of the busier Temple Bar area and the rail station 
We flew Ryan Air and bought the 10euro return air coach tickets on the plane which were slightly cheaper ,avoided queues and which took us from Airport entrance to 200 yards fromhotel .
Hotel was fine clean and tidy staff helpful and breakfast good although at peak times quality slightly dipped.. Nothing major though..
Were able to leave luggage at hotel when checked out and picked up later that evening.
Tesco opposite provided all you would need for your stay with a pub 100 yards away serving good beer and ok food too.
Might not suit youngsters who want to party hard but for us just right .
Will return again .,",5,2016,02,12
231,"Friendly, clean and good location for city centre","Rooms good size (we had a twin and it had both a double bed and a single). Tea and coffee making facilities. Friendly and helpful staff.

231,Weekend away with the girls ,"I've stayed at this hotel on many many occasions maybe 3/4 times per year with friends,and every time our stay was fantastic,not so much this time round. I had requested an early check in as we had all travelled a great distance to the hotel and was informed to come back 4hours later! So we stored our bags and off we went on our return our room was ready and we headed straight up, room had a very poor dirty view of where the rubbish and deliveries to be taken out and made....not want you want on a weekend away. The breakfast was very very poor it was cold to say the least on the first morning we were told we had to have it in the bar, although there were tables free we were informed that they were reserved for other patrons!!! I've never heard of that before,there was at least 6 empty tables and all were reserved??? So we ate in the bar and our food was cold we waited a long time
Before breakfast was replenished. Staff were friendly and the room and hotel is spotless but for the cost of the stay and the service we received it was extremely below par, as I've stated I've long been a loyal customer of this hotel but my opinion has some what changed over the course of this stay!! ",2,2016,02,11
231,Breakfast madness,"I stayed the weekend to celebrate a friends significant birthday, hotel was nice however the morning breakfast experience was mayhem, not enough seating so the thought of having a pleasant breakfast as a group was out of the question.
The ""breakfast line"" was like waiting for school dinners and the staff showed annoyance when you asked for cutlery let alone bog standard breakfast items to be available. (Milk )
Plus ended up carrying tray of food through to the bar area so i could eat my breakfast. Therefore breakfast not a good experience. 
Jurys you need to sort!! I will be looking for alternate accommodation when i return to Dublin in March!! ",1,2016,02,10
231,"Brilliant, friendly, clean and ideal location","Stayed at this hotel a few times now and always impressed with the service and cleanliness of it. Staff throughout the hotel from reception to bar to restaurant are so friendly and helpful and they like a little joke with you to get you laughing. It was ireland v wales rugby weekend and very very busy and the staff in the breakfast room were amazing and coped brilliantly.  The variety of food was excellent and plentiful. Good rooms and as carpet in hallways you don't hear the suitcases so good night sleep. Room had iron, hairdryer, tea and coffee. 
Location is great as just around the corner to the shopping streets and 10 minutes walk to the river liffey and over to Temple Bar, but enough to be done right on the doorstep.  Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin as this hotel is 10 out of 10.",5,2016,02,10

231,Fab central hotel,"Very central hotel, fab staff, breakfast time you can order anything not on the extremely extensive buffet menu. Maids are brilliant and so are bar staff. Cheaper than most of the pubs for food and drink too.",5,2016,02,09

231,Handy for city centre,"Good location although it is 5 minutes walk from the Q car park on Marlborough street. 
There are a lot of roadworks at the moment so some taxi's were not coming around the front but still managed to hail one fairly quickly in the evening. Rooms were just what you'd except, clean and tidy and had all mod con's. Free Wifi was a bit on the slow side unless you upgrade but it was useable. Staff came and brought extra towels to the room as soon as we checked in because we were in family room. Breakfast was a good spread of hot and cold selections.",4,2016,02,09
231,Marvellous hotel,"Everything I wanted at this hotel, would stay there again.

231,Beautiful Hotel But Breakfast time dusaster,"I stayed in the Jurys Inn Parnell St. Dublin from friday 27th January until Sunday 29th January, 2016.

It was a beautiful Hotel insdie, really ultra modern. It looks dreadful from the outside, in fact , I would call it Grotty!!!

I couldnt find the hotel at first, it was very badly light up. The Juarys Inn lighting was very bad light up. only ssome of the bulbs were working l
There was plenty of space and setting inside. The Receptionist was very welcoming and efficient. The bedroom was big and and bright.. The Security was very tight. It was a abit like Fort KNocks. Mind you, I am not complaining and was very happy with that.

The only complaint I have was at Breakfast Time. It was chaotic. There were not enough Staff on to cover the amount of people coming in. The tables were full of dirty dishes. The poor Staff were run off their feet. It was not very nice to have to sit among dirty dishes eating my breakfast. 

Okay they did have a sign up stating when it was busy and when it was not. Still that is no excuse for having dirty dishes lying around on the tables.

You as a Hotel should know that you are a City Hotel and athat there are loats of people staying in your Hotel. You should employ more Staff for the Breakfast Shift. Do remember Health and Safety.

Having said that, despite the dirty dishes beside me the breakfast was delicious. Why dont you do mushrooms? To me breakfast is not breakfast unless you have a few mushrooms available to eat.

I also ate in the Hotel Grill on the Friday evening. I opted for the 2 course Dinner. It was delicious. The Sweet Potato Soup was to die for. The Beef Burger was super and it was a bargain at 18.50 Euros.

231,Always a pleasure,"Itsalways a pleasure to stay in Jurus Inn Parnell Street

231,Ok,"Location grrreat

Free wifi in the rooms and the rooms our room was big spacious and the bed very comfortable.there is also free secure safe boxes in reception.   The hotel is well situated for bars restaurants shops and buses with lots of information in reception on trips and the staff helped us to book a great trip.

231,Business trip 2nd / 3rd Feb 2016,"Overall really happy, I was well looked after and thought the room rate was excellent value.

231,One night stay,"We chose this hotel due to location, good reviews and we also got a good deal. 
This hotel exceeded expectations. The service provided by reception was 5 star.
The hotel itself is nicely kept and inviting and the room was clean and modern. 
We were given free breakfast vouchers as there'd been a mix up through booking.com about whether or not this was included but I have to say the breakfast was very disorganised. Restaurant staff were nowhere near as pleasant as reception. Had to ask twice for a cup. Cutlery hadn't been topped up, there was 1 tea bag left and the fry seemed to be coming out in dribs and drabs but everything tasted good! overall I'd recommend ",4,2016,02,05
231,Ideally situated,Just returned from this hotel was a bit apprehensive at first as the star rating was low we were met with the manager who quickly passed us on to the reception booking in was quick and smooth the room was ideal with plenty of room as was the bathroom we stayed on a b&b basis the breakfast was self service with an excellent choice we also tried the restaurant one evening which again was excellent no matter where you went in the hotel it was spotless clean i personally would rate this hotel a definite 5 star so don't let the star rating put you off would i return to this hotel most definitely keep up your very high standards ,5,2016,02,05

231,"Lovely hotel, excellent location","Really recommend this hotel. It is modern, clean, spacious and friendly. Has a bar, gym, restaurant if you need it.  It's in a great location (although road works going on all over and just outside hotel for new tram system which didn't impede us at all), 10/12 minute walk to Temple Bar for evening entertainment, (loads of cinemas and theatres everywhere in Dublin, close to some of those too) Five minute walk to the tour buses No. 1 Stop and buses from airport.  Lovely shopping centre just two minutes around the corner.  Walk to Jameson Distillery for instance from hotel takes about 15 minutes.",5,2016,01,29

231,Excellent value for money. Great food,"Our stay in Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street started of with a lovely welcome from the receptionist who was able to upgrade our room without us even asking. She was very helpful and guided us to the off site parking and explained how we could save on the parking fee. Nothing was too much trouble for her.

The breakfast was excellent plenty of good fresh food, we were spoilt for choice.",5,2016,01,27
231,Good value for money however...,Stayed here for a break January 24th - 28th would advise if your not going to spend any time in the hotel (literally only sleep) Hotel was 10 minutes away from temple bar which I would highly recommend!! €10 taxi also somewhere to visit for the day !! I would recommend for couples & also family's! 40 minute walk from Guinness Factory again recommended or you can catch the 123 bus €4.20 for 2 people we did choose this route the way home. Hotel restaurant you can't fault and is a good value for money also the hotel bar is great for if you are just looking for a few drinks before you go out. Shopping centre not far about a 5 minute walk. Disappointments  - when we checked in we were not made aware we had to pre authorise a card if we wished to have room service so when we called they advised us that they would not come to our room unless we went to reception and left a card this did cause an inconvenience as it was 10pm and we had been out all day and had now got back to the room very tired ready to chill out with some food as we were all changed ready for bed this caused me to go downstairs in my pj's at this point I asked for a manager due to other reasons listed below I am 20 years old but am a manager for quite a large company myself and do like to try push all my staff give my customers an excellent customer service when I explained this to the duty manager to try explain my disappointments I did feel as though he looked at me as if I wasn't been truthful about my profession this made me feel rather uncomfortable. Card to gain access to room deactivated at least once a day during our time here what also caused an inconvenience as we were on 4th floor we had to be back and fourth to reception. ,3,2016,01,26
231,Dublin trip,"Just stayed 2 nights at this hotel last weekend,
The rooms are very clean and a good size.
Breakfast is worth having as there is a good selection of hot and cold food.
The hotel is situated about 10/15 minute walk to temple bar and grafton street but the walk is worth the money you will save by not staying closer.",4,2016,01,26
231,Stayed overnight for a gig!,"The stay was great, wish I had of tried the food it looked very nice. Staff were really friendly and happy to help! The location is great too! Very close to most things as it's right just off the top of o Connell street. ",5,2016,01,26
231,Shopping stay,"Great hotel location for city centre location especially Henry and graften street for shopping, good value for money for one night stay with breakfast included, very clean hotel with warm atmosphere...comfortable and enjoyable stay",5,2016,01,26
231,Break with kiddies,Usually stay Christchurch. Was sold out. Parnell st experience was just as positive. The bar and restaurant are on the second floor so it feels a bit more exclusive. Bar prices reasonable. Bar food great. Breakfast had lots of choice and a poster with a traffic light system of busy times helped us to avoid busier times. The restaurant has a small menu but again was quite nice. The room was clean. Well maintained. Bathroom was spotless. Would recommend. ,5,2016,01,26
231,Scottish couple,"Friendly staff, secure hotel as you need your room card to use the lifts.  Food was great. Breakfast was self service with plenty of choice.  Room was nice, comfortable and clean. The shower was fine as plenty of hot water. ",5,2016,01,26
231,My wife's birthday weekend,"My wife and I stayed for 2 nights on 22/23 January 2016. This was a birthday treat so I wanted it to be just right, stress free enjoyment without paying the earth - I wasn't disappointed in any way.
We arrived late on the Friday evening (after 10:00 pm because of a delayed flight ) and we're greeted by one of the best and most efficient receptionists I have ever met. Nothing was too much trouble, the check-in was really smooth and there was real concern that we might have miss eating because it was late and the restaurant was closed - we had already eaten but it was a nice touch to be considered like that.
Our room was just right for our 2 night stay - not cramped, room to sit and watch TV, a good desk area and all the usual facilities - kettle etc, hair dryer, iron and wifi that really worked.
Breakfast was good - the usual buffet type scramble but the hot food was hot, the cereals and fruit plentiful and the drinks were varied and on-tap. We went for breakfast at 9:30 and it was really busy, but we found a table with very little wait.
The bar area was very comfortable and again the staff seemed to take real pleasure in dealing with guests. Prices for drinks were on a par with outside bars. Check Out on Sunday was again problem free - we had a late flight and were offfered ""left luggage"" facilities which we great fully accepted.
The hotel is very clean, fresh and secure - this should be a given but is not always the case in city centres - the guests were lively but it wasn't noisy. 
All in all and for the cost and for the experience I was impressed - I would certainly stay again and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel for a weekend break with family or friends.",4,2016,01,25
231,weekend guest,"Lovely Hotel very central and within walking distance of major tourist attractions. Very helpful and friendly staff . Clean, welcoming room,lots of towels in bathroom , great choice at breakfast, something to suit everyone.Thank you for a great experience.",5,2016,01,25
231,Dublin trip with friends,"Fantastic hotel with friendly, welcoming staff who were extremely professional and helpful throughout our stay.
We were a party of 6 girls all carrying small cases. The staff let us check our bags into a secure room allowing us to head into Dublin and make the most of  the day before we headed back to check into our bedrooms at  6 pm ( we could have checked in at 2 ) but the fact we didn't have cases to worry about meant we could do the bus tour etc
The concierge guy who looked after our bags was a joy and was really helpful. The rooms ( all 3 of them) were perfect with a massive double bed, single bed and large bathroom. We were delighted with the room and all got a great sleep.
Will definitely return to this hotel as it was spot on.",5,2016,01,25
231,Nice stay,"Friendly hotel, concierge EXCELLENT nothing too much trouble
Didn't eat at jury's inn drinks reasonably priced nice friendly atmosphere
We ate at Murray's bar not far from jury's inn food was excellent",4,2016,01,25

231,Quick weekend away.,"Great location. Staff helpful and friendly. Hotel and rooms very clean. Breakfast had plenty of food to choice from. We didn't use the bar but had a meal in the restaurant, couldn't find fault with anything.  ",4,2016,01,25
231,Nice clean hotel. Great location.,"My parents and I stayed here for two nights in January 2016. We got adjoining rooms and asked that they be away from the elevator. The hotel was very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. The location was perfect for everything we had planned on doing in Dublin and it was great to be able to returned to the hotel when our shopping bags got heavy. My mother had stayed at this hotel previously with her sisters and she recommended it. The only negative we had with the hotel was their breakfast setup - the staff seemed very disorganized and both mornings there was no bread for toast, the glasses for juice were at the opposite side of the counter from where the juice was and a number of people waited about 10 minutes one morning for a staff member to bring out warm milk for cereal.",4,2016,01,24
231,Birthday weekend ,"My mum and I decided to come to Dublin for a weekend of shopping.  This hotel is right in the centre and walking distance from EVERYTHING... including all the shops and all the sites. Its true, this hotel will win no modern fashion awards, however: Our twin room on the 5th floor was very quiet despite the hotel being full for the weekend. It was clean and there was also air conditioning (the rooms were warm so this was essential). The buffet breakfast was hot and tasty, and excellent value at €10 each. The car park was a very short 2 min walk away and also cheap at €10 per night. 
Only thing, I wish I had brought my own shampoo and conditioner... but we will definitely stay here again!!",5,2016,01,24
231,Amazing 2 night stay !,"I booked this on Wednesday 20th for two nights randomly, arrived to very friendly staff, very impressed from the moment I walked in! Rooms are big and lovely, this hotel is so central to everything in Dublin, I done the whole tourist thing which was fantastic . The location is fabulous ! Will def be back! Thank you ",5,2016,01,23
231,"Good hotel, bad smell.","Lovely hotel located very central in Dublin, however I was rather disappointed by the smell of cigarette smoke throughout the place.

I was humoured by the offer of a room with a view, as looking out the front of the building reveals roadworks, the maternity hospital, and the local community of junkies. ",3,2016,01,23
231,just ok,"we stayed for 4 nights over christmas. I found the hotel overprices as it is quite dated. The beds were not comforting and housekeeping would get the 2 glasses used the previous night, rinse them and place them again as cleaned without having take the actual obvious dry 'stain' one of the glass left on the desk area next to the kettle etc. not great and a lot of revamp is due. the area is very centric and we did have a great time in ireland overall.
wifi is not free in this hotel, and nowadays, wanting to charge 10 or 15€ (don't remember the rate!) for 24 hours of wifi its just not thoughtful and greedy as tourists do not spend much time in the hotel, its usual to use whatsapp and skype etc. at no cost specially in 3 stars hotels.",3,2016,01,22
231,Great location but always some niggling problem,"I recently returned here after almost a two year absence. The reason for the absence was a bad experience with noisy guests and lack of management intervention. But I decided to give it another shot. However, this time I didn't have hot water in the shower. I phoned reception twice and the problem was resolved but I lost 20 minutes of time which is vital when heading out to a meeting. I must say the location is excellent - just at the top of  O'Connell Street and right next to the Ilac Shopping centre. Also a cinema across the road",3,2016,01,22
231,Return visit,We stay here regularly. It is always good value and there is a very good breakfast. The staff are always friendly. The rooms always clean. It is situated very close to the city centre. There is a taxi outside he door ,4,2016,01,22

231,close to centre,"Hotel is rather like a slightly upmarket travel lodge.  Would recommend if one is looking for a place close to the city centre.  Buffet breakfast is quite nice though not enough staff to ensure that tables were cleaned regularly.  However, notwithstanding these comments would stay here again if visited Dublin.",3,2016,01,21
231,Weekend break,"Fantastic weekend in Dublin, which was unfortunately spoiled by the fact that we had 2 terrible nights sleep due to the mattress being very uncomfortable.  Other than this, we enjoyed our stay at Jury's Inn",3,2016,01,21

231,Pleasant Experience,"This is a very convenient hotel, with everything within a handy distance - bus stops, shops, bars etc The hotel is modern and bright; our breakfast experience was very good and our room, at the back of the hotel, was very pleasant. Our only small criticism was that check-in took rather a long compared to other hotels and more staff could help at peak times.",4,2016,01,21
231,Happy,"Excellent hotel,staff polite & helpful,The hotel is convenient to entertainment & shops, would recommend to a friend,looking forward to my next stay.always a buzz about Jurys Parnell Sq

231,Spotless,"Ideal location, spotless rooms. What more could you ask for. Didn't have much contact with staff as we didn't need anything really. Tesco across the road for anything you need. Just around the corner from O'Connell street. Only real criticism is that the bath is tiny! Really narrow and shallow. Stick to the shower. But apart from that no issues at all. Tea and coffee supplies in the room, TV, shower gel. Ice machine and vending machine by the lifts on all floors. Very secure, security guard on at night and need key card to access lifts ",4,2016,01,21
231,Good weekend,Very nice hotel with friendly staff and near to bars and restaurants. Would defiantly stay there again. Dublin is a very friendly city with lots to do. We went for the horse and dog racing it was good,4,2016,01,21
231,Lovely stay,"friendly helpful staff, everything straight forward, well maintained and clean hotel. Set in a great location, walking distance to temple bar and bus stops to get around. Only negative that as a veggie I found breakfast a bit limited. ",4,2016,01,21
231,Good price function ratio,"You will not miss much if you are on a business trip, nothing is superb but you get what you need. No amenities at all  and a extremely  basic breakfast maybe the weakest points. If location suits you is OK for a short stay. Rooms are sufficient and comfortable WiFi free but slow 
",3,2016,01,21
231,Excellent,"We stayed for two nights for a birthday. We thought that the stay was enjoyable. The staff were pleasant and very helpful. Chris the manager was incredible he couldn't do enough for us as we had an incident that unfortunately occured during our stay. The hotel its self is lovely and very clean. The rooms were nice, and a good size. The breakfast was lovely and of good variety. We would definitely come back and stay again, it was worth while. 

Thank you for everything.",5,2016,01,20

231,visiting friends,"we stayed her for 2 night before travelling to donegal, check in was prompt and our room was very clean and off the main street, we were dissapointed with breakfast as on both mornings plates and food were cold  other than that everything was good, we did find that the hotel bar is cheaper to have a drink in than the local pubs lol",5,2016,01,20
231,Very friendly staff.,"Hotel couldn't keep up with the number of guests at the breakfast.did have to move to the bar for a very poor breakfast.
To set up the heating is a big problem ,even for the staff.
Lots of security staff around in this area ,still didn't feel very save .",3,2016,01,19

The hotel staff were welcoming and friendly nothing was to much trouble. 
The rooms were clean and comfortable with tea and coffee, hair dryer and even an iron and iron board. We also had free wifi in our room.
The hotel also has a nice bar area and offer a good selection choice for diners.

Would consider staying here if ever return to Dublin.",4,2016,01,17

231,"Excellent and great value, wifi not bad either","I took my partner to this hotel, having seen its ""official"" rating was lower but it had great reviews. and it proved to be exactly that.

The breakfast we included, was excellent. Although the layout a little odd? For example, milk being as far away from the cereal as possible. Picky, but that's how good this hotel was.

The only other negative was the loud toilet after flushing, pipe noise perhaps? but very loud for a minute or so.

However the room was lovely, breakfast was lovely, as were staff - very helpful. Offered on the day of check-out to hold our luggage if our flight was hours after check out, wish i'd thought about that in advance now.

The bed was soft, and spare pillows already in room - which were firm, whilst the ones already on the bed were soft. We are also offered a variety of rooms on available, bath, shower, view, seeing as it was quiet. All without asking. Excellent.",5,2016,01,15

231,Value for money!!,"Stayed at Customs House Jurys Inn 2 years ago so had an idea what to expect, sadly it isn't quite upto those standards but still a good hotel.

231,Excellent hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Excellent in a vibrant city... Very very close to all the mains attractions, the Jurys hotel provide a great customer service. the room was big and very clean, bath as well. 
We tried also the bar and the restaurant. Prizes ok, with a great quality of the meal.
Go for it... ;)",5,2016,01,14
231,Excellent option,"This was my second time to Dublin City. The Jurys Inn Parnell was an excellent option for me and my friend; the room was clean, comfortable, and just as described. The single bed was perfect for me as a diminutive person, and the double bed was perfect for my friend who is much taller than I. Breakfast was more than sufficient, with warm options, healthy choices, and the inevitable delicious mini-croissants. The location worked well for us --- close to shopping and easy to walk everywhere, but also a quick walk to catch a bus on O'Connell street if necessary. Staff were friendly and helpful across the board. Would definitely stay again!",5,2016,01,14
231,Very reasonable,"Clean and well managed, no frills. Wi-fi is free, although slow unless you upgrade to a premium product. Handy for access to Dublin City, so recommend for business or pleasure.

return for a drink at the end of the evening which is always nice.",5,2016,01,12
231,Great hotel! Great central location,"The hotel was in great location, close to all the sights to see in Dublin.
Rooms were excellent. The breakfast was great, all fresh and very enjoyable. 
The whole experience of staying there  was great. 
Would recommend and stay again",5,2016,01,12
231,Good craic,"This hotel provides everything you need for a city break in Dublin! Clean rooms, comfy bed, nice bathroom, good breakfast and central location. The staff were very helpful and even arranged our taxi back to the airport to ensure we got the best price. ",5,2016,01,12
231,Long weekend in Dublin,"We were In Dublin for a long weekend. This is a Fab hotel in a fab location just round the corner from O'Connell Street. Excellent value for money . Lovely rooms, nice and clean. Regular maid service. Staff are nice and friendly and excellent breakfast. Highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2016,01,12
231,Generally good but...,"Firstly, great location - close to airport bus, supermarket, pubs, walk to most attractions.

Secondly, good modern facilities, clean, friendly staff during our stay. We didn't eat breakfast here as we either self-catered or ate cooked breakfasts at a cafe around the corner for half the price - a few good options nearby.

But

Some staff need to think a little before acting. Prior to our stay and in order to arrange Christmas dinner bookings, twice I received phone calls in the middle of the night my time. The staff member must have seen an international number - it would have made sense to check where they were calling to before dialling. 

Also,
We stayed here twice - first time in their best room (larger corner room with big windows) second time in the worst room (window faced inwards to other inwards facing windows and had disabled access bathroom). 

The bathroom was great in the first and awful in the second. The reception said they were fully booked so I understand that someone had to have that room but hopefully they avoid booking it out otherwise. There was a normal shower curtain but a much longer shower curtain rail, quite too high off the floor to really help so water went everywhere. Being a disabled access toilet there was no lid which is off putting on a romantic getaway!  Luckily we only had one night in this room.

Our first stay with the other room was great - we just obviously drew the short straw with our second stay.

Would I stay here again? Probably. I would make sure I made a room request with my booking.",4,2016,01,11
231,Fantastic weekend away,Had a two nights stay here which was fantastic. We stayed in a clean and comfortable room in a great location. The staff were helpful and always ready to help with a smile. We stayed bed and breakfast and was amazed by the range of choices and the food was served to a very high standard. The sausage was the best I've eaten in a long time. Great value for money and would definitely recommend to a friend.,5,2016,01,11
231,A fantastic break in the heart of the city,Myself and my daughter decided to do some post Christmas shopping and stayed at jury's Parnell St. We had such a fabulous time we will definitely be returning. The staff were very helpful and polite ☺,5,2016,01,11
231,Great location for shopping or sightseeing,"Just returned from our second visit to Jury's inn Hotel. Upon check Inn the receptionist kindly stored our bags as we had arrived early. There was a fresh complementary orange drink for guests, lovely touch. We returned at 2 pm for a swift check in. Our bedrooms were fresh, bright, airy and very clean. We had adjoining rooms which was wonderful. The television had a lot of great channels and it was very quiet at night, even on the weekends. It was lovely and warm and there was a temperature control switch in each room to adjust the room temperature.

We had breakfast in the hotel  as part of our package. There was great variety of fried breakfast, cereals, bread and fruit. On Sunday morning it was very busy and I saw a lot of guests piling used plates, glasses and cups from previous guests to one side so they could sit down. Wiping down the tables with napkins. The man taking people's room numbers at the breakfast entrance was juggling between clearing tables and racing back to tick people off the list. More staff needed during busy periods. 

The hotel is located in a great location next to a shopping center and walking distance to abbey street Luas line. The staff were helpful and hadworking.

On Saturday evening we ordered a Feta cheese and Beetroot salad and two toasted ciabatta's with cheese and tomato from the menu. It took over one hour to arrive. My salad was a bowl of spinach and lettuce. No dressing, with only crumbs of feta and no walnuts or pomegranate as advertised. My friends Ciabattas were on dry bread with no pesto or other sauce and one slice of cheese and two tomatoes. I can honesty say it was the blandest food we have ever eaten. I would strongly recommend that more time and energy is placed into your dinner food preparation. You would have received 5 stars if It wasn't for this experience.",4,2016,01,11
231,Trip to Dublin,"I stayed at the jury inn for 2 nights, we arrived 4 hours early for check in but they still let us check as soon as we got there! The breakfast is really nice and the beds are comfy. Friendly staff too",5,2016,01,11

231,Prime location! Perfect for weekend stay!,"Jury's inn was amazing! Situated adjacent to O'connell's street and a mere 10-15 minute walk to temple bar and other great pubs!

The breakfast was brilliant with a wide variety!

Wifi worked well in our room, reception and bar area!

Staff were friendly and helped where we had questions about the area or any recommendations.

The rooms were spacious with excellent bathroom facilities!

Overall a great hotel for our first stay in Dublin!",5,2016,01,11
231,Nice hotel,First time at a Jurys. Very nice lobby. Complimentary fruit water. Check in easy.  Three lifts. Plush carpets in hallways. Nice room. No one hammering on your door at stupid o'clock to clean the room. Comfy bar with helpful staff. Knowledgeable receptionists. Happy to store bags on last day. Would recommend,5,2016,01,11
231,Perfect peace in Parnell Street,"Quiet, clean, friendly hotel in an excellently convenient location. The breakfast was delicious, the bar experience very relaxed and the reception staff all very polite and friendly. I would return to stay here again in Dublin. ",5,2016,01,11
231,Xmas in Dublin,great location for shopping in dublin.  Christmas market was a bit disappointing.  Exit thr hotel and turn right  accross the street is a great bar that does great food.  Pork belly to die for.  Hotel food is OK.  Breakfast is good but very busy.  Be prepared to wait.  All the mjor sites are within easy walking distance.,5,2016,01,10
231,dublin new year,"jurys inn located off oconnell street two minute walk.Hotel modern decor very attentive and polite staff  .Rooms very clean and modern
.Food and drink at the hotel reasonably price.Breakfast very good choice of full cooked breakfast or continental.A very enjoyable new year.",4,2016,01,10
231,Not coming back,"The price is above average for a hotel!on the arrival the check in was early, very much aprechiated,into an occupied room, so what is my surprise that there is a gentleman in there, in underware!off to the reception we go, and the lady couldnt apoligize more, but not even an apology note from the manager, nothing!this morning the tinny restaurant couldnt acommodate all the people, so it looks like a fancy restaurant on a saturday night.there was to waiters, cleaning the food wastes to the floor!
The breakfast is very poor, so if you dont like english breakfast, you are stuck.
Situated in a very central place, 5min from the main attractions, the airport bus stops 2 streets away and its very handy and cheap in comparison to the city prices.
Is a no no for me, although everyone is very nice and the rooms are clean and the hotel very tidy!",3,2016,01,10
231,New Year's Eve was a hit!,"We went here on New Year's Eve and although it was a little pricey it was still the cheapest in town for a decent hotel. We are at the bar on the second floor and the food was dire & completely bland but the staff could not be more welcoming throughout. 

Overall a great, modern hotel with no actual downsides besides the bar food (watery green curry and tasteless chicken burger).",5,2016,01,08
231,great location for dublin,"Hotel is just off O'Connell street upper with a Tesco opposite and Aldi's around the corner so everything is to hand including your Hop on Hop off buses and of course Temple Bar is a mere 10 minutes walk. Had a wonderful time bringing in the New Year, the place is jumping, will go back. Hotel was good, very clean and rooms cleaned daily, Bathroom was adequate with a very effective shower.  Breakfast was also very good, everything that my wife and I needed and the bar was a popular destination. Agree with Stephen, hotel is better than 3 star.
One minor point that annoyed her indoors was the Doorman who was very discourteous looking at his mobile constantly and not actually being a doorman.
But I need to finish on a possitive note, it was a great stay and we will be back to this hotel.",5,2016,01,08
231,Quality.,"In general this hotel is grand. The breakfast great. I did not see the whole hotel during my visit, but it was lovely. The staff Friendly and professional. The internet could be improved. Very good for a variety of travelling types.",4,2016,01,08
231,Great Experience,"I have stayed in Jury's Inn Parnell Street Dublin on many occasions and have not ever had a bad experience, the staff are extremely helpful and friendly and the food is excellent both in the bar and restaurant.  ",5,2016,01,08
231,Excellent stay ,Great hotel. Brilliant location. Fantastic breakfast. Staff very friendly. Would recommend the superior room as we had a late check out until 2pm. Also we arrived at 12 checked straight away. Airport bus stop 10 minute walk away which is easier with baggage. ,5,2016,01,08
231,Great staff !,Really happy with our trip an all staff and thank you for sending my watch. Was a great trip and really was a place to stay not far from the city light! The hotel provided most things and made our new year great! Much appreciated and thankyou Parnell street!,5,2016,01,08
231,Good value city hotel. ,"Enjoyed a two night stay at the jury's inn, nice spacious room with comfy bed, bathroom could benefit from a touch up but fine. Friendly staff and a good breakfast would stay again. Good location if you don't want to be in the thick of the city but still within walking distance. ",4,2016,01,07
231,Week away for New Year,"Wasn't sure what to expect with it being a 3 star hotel but I need not have worried - it was better than many 4 star hotels I've stayed in.  The superior room was comfortable and had a sofa and chair and was large enough to spend time in relaxing with a bottle of wine.

The bed was only a standard double but comfortable enough and we slept well.  The bathroom again was basic but had everything needed and the shower was excellent.  The toiletries were nice and the room and bathroom were spotlessly clean.  Well decorated and the room had a warmth which is often missing from hotels - somebody had obviously thought about the décor.

The restaurant was very comfortable and quiet, the food was excellent and the menu was extensive enough for a short stay.  The steak was exceptionally well cooked and overall the food and ambience in the restaurant was much, much better than many hotels, very nice indeed.  Even the wines were very pleasant.  Again the décor had been thought about and the restaurant and bar were both very comfortable and relaxing places to be.

Standard free wifi was OK for basic e-mail and facebook etc but the optional faster wifi is very good - suitable for streamig Netflix.

Location is great - plenty of bars and restaurants in the local area and it's directly opposite a Tesco mini store if you need snacks or toiletries.  Much nicer than Temple Bar which is now a bit of a tourist trap.  The Post office (1916 uprising) is just round the corner, literally, and the Abbey Theatre is just a few minutes walk away.

Overall a very enjoyable stay, nothing to annoy us, nothing we felt wasn't right and food, drink, hospitality and environment were all very good.  We will be going back next spring and will stay in the same hotel.",5,2016,01,07
231,Smashing stay,Stayed for a night during a quick trip to Dublin. Hotel ideally located with spacious modern rooms. The staff were helpful and friendly and the breakfast was very enjoyable. The bar at the hotel is very modern and well priced. I would definitely stay here again ,5,2016,01,07
231,Good hotel close to the city center,Our room was very good and wide enough. It has a thermostat that controls the temperature you want and we slept quite well. It's close to the city center (10min walking). The breakfast is complete and the hotel looks like new and very clean. We enjoyed our stay in it.,4,2016,01,07
231,Clean and Close to city Center,"Easy to find, clean and close to city center everything you are looking for during a city trip this hotel can give you. great breakfast enoug supply even just before 10.00, nice bar with bar food and a great Bar tender Simon. At the reception they will give you great information on the city and places to eat or go for a drink outside the places mentioned in all city guides. We really enjoyed our stay. Only thing the Christmas dinner we got served because the city was closed was to expensive for what we got.",4,2016,01,07
231,Outstanding !,"Jurys Hotel, Parnell Street, Dublin. Outstanding hotel. Staff very efficient and friendly, food and service excellent, location excellent and super value for money ! looking forward to my next stay already !",5,2016,01,06
231,Great hotel,Jurys Inn Parnell Street is a great hotel and pretty central to eventing so brilliant location. All the staff were always more than happy to help. I would defiantly stay here again if I visited Dublin again. ,5,2016,01,06
231,Jury's Inn,Make sure you get a decent room.  One room we saw was poor compared to the usual Jury's Inn standars.  Nice friendly staff.  Clean.  Convenient location.  Okay value for money.  Handy for airport shuttle bus.,3,2016,01,06
231,"Staff very good, room not so good","Basically what I said above, room very small and far to hot. Thermostat wouldn't work and for the price the room was so small, possibly just needs upgraded as I have stayed in other Jurys in Dublin and found the other rooms far superior. Staff very obliging!",3,2016,01,06
231,Best holiday,Really enjoyed staying at this hotel as it was not too far from o'connell street and all the main shopping areas. The staff is very kind and helpfull. We had a great time and the breakfast is really good. Many options. Would definately recommend it to everyone. ,5,2016,01,06
231,Very enjoyable,"Great hotel,excellent central location. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Room very clean and comfortable. Bar staff pleasant and helpful,and bar food was excellent. Breakfast excellent and a wide choice of items. ",5,2016,01,06
231,New Year trip,"No complaints whatsoever.  Clean, comfortable, welcoming and excellent choice of food for breakfast. Ideally located for short walk to river and Temple Bar etc. Bus stops just around the corner.  Would definitely use Jurys Inn again",5,2016,01,06
231,Excellent! ,"Myself and a group of five others stayed for two nights in this hotel over the Christmas period as we had tickets to see a show.
All the group found the service excellence,  the staff were pleasant and attentive. 
We ate in the bar both nights,  with all meals very delicious. 
We had a particularly good barman called Simon that served us both nights. Again, he was attentive, friendly and great fun.
Would definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning. ",5,2016,01,06
231,Superior Room worth the money!,"Enjoyed a lovely stay in this hotel over New Year weekend! The superior room was definitely worth the money, especially on New Years Day morning when there was free water and coffee in the room! Will definitely be returning!",5,2016,01,05
231,"Clean, good location, nice staff","Stayed here for the entirety of my time in Dublin.  As the group did not want to be near the touristy Temple Bar area, this hotel was perfect.  It is close to everything, but in a quieter part of town (still plenty of fun bars around, of course).  The desk was able to accommodate our 6AM check-in, which was amazing after an overnight flight with little sleep.  The rooms are large, clean, and well-equipped.  We took advantage of the breakfast as well, which was a nice buffet with a lot of options.  The internet was not great, but otherwise, I would stay here again!",5,2016,01,05
231,Nice hotel but a little noisey out theback,"Arrived early and we were given an early check in at no extra charge which was lovely. We got a room on the top floor a the back with views over towards the GPO and Liffey. The hotels itself was very clean and all the staff were very nice. Breakfast was excellent although we found a few irish favourites to be missing from the buffet, but thats just our version. The only issue was not to do with the hotel or staff but the works unit out the back i think it was for street cleaning, noisey all night especially first thing in the morning.

but really, we dont have much to complain about. Have stayed beforeand will stay again.",4,2016,01,05
231,Very good! Recommended!,"Me and my partner stayed at Jurys on Parnell Strett for 5 nights in relation to New Year's Eve and my birthday.

We had a room towards the courtyard so it was very quiet. The room was clean and nice. The bathroom could use a fix since the the wallpaper (?) started to fall off. But, who stays in Dublin to use their time in their hotel bathroom?  On New Year's Eve it was quite noisy from the neighbours (party) but what can one expect?

The hotel is close to Henry Street, the main street. The centre is compact so you don't have to walk far for anything from the hotel.

The staff was very helpful and service-minded everywhere at the hotel. They know absolutely everything and don't be afraid to ask them for anyting.

We used the fitness-room which contained a tread mill, weights, cycling machine and a cross-trainer and a TV. The air-conditioning there was not all that and the floor has carpet. A bench could be useful.

The breakfast was OK, with warm food like black pudding, sausages, fried eggs, potatoes, and the like. The variety for cold food was OK with different cheeses and ham and marmelades. Highly recommendend not to eat breakfast close to 10 o'clock as it may be hard to find/ wait for seating, cutlery, glasses and the like. But it's no problem to eat in the bar and my partner was allowed to bring breakfast to our room. 

We had a great stay here and recommend this hotel.",4,2016,01,05
231,Left a lot to be desired,"Stayed her 15-16 December 2015 as part of a college group. The concierge (not sure his name) floating in reception on the 15th when we arrived was out standing. He called us a taxi straight away when we asked then he told us about what we could do around the Guinness Storehouse (our destination). The restaurant staff were very pleasant. The food served in the restaurant was delicious and very reasonably priced. Very nicely decorated. Very modern. 

Now, the negatives. The room i stayed in had an awful smell when I first arrived, I had to leave the window open throughout my stay to get rid of it. It smelt like dirty drain water or something. 
When I went for breakfast the following morning, I was informed that breakfast was not included in my room rate. I had asked the waitress to double check for me and then she called the reception. (I hadn't booked the room myself so was unsure of what was included.) when the waitress called reception I could here the receptionist talking quite rudely about my group which was not pleasant. 
Also note it was poor quality tea and coffee in the bedrooms and no biscuits were provided. 
The toiletries in the room are refillable bottles screwed to the wall.. Cheap and nasty and there was scum round the bottle.
Check in was poor as receptionists could not find our pre made key cards.   

In summary; provided there was no smell in the room, the room would have been adequate for one nights stay. The restaurant was great value. I think the hotel was OK value but for £60 per night, and the hotel not being near any major tourist attractions, and very little amenities it left a lot to be desired frankly. 

I really think this hotel only deserved 2 stars but the few fantastic staff in the property made it get 3 stars.

PS: Don't stay for more than one or two nights.

231,Dublin new year 2016,"Excellent 3day break to see in the new year. Staying at the Jurys inn Parnell street. Hotel very central in an excellent position, extras is bar and food prices reasonable. Rooms modern and very clean and excellent free wifi. All in all great hotel which made a great base for an excellent trip to Dublin.",5,2016,01,04
231,Good location,"This hotel is very well located for shopping and restaurants.We had a very large room that was equipped for disabled people it was clean with a large bed ,dressing table with mirror with electric sockets idea for all us ladies hairdryer provided was very good. The bathroom was clean and the shower was very powerful downside no toilet brush.Housekeeping very good. The walls are a little thin so I could hear people talking which was a little annoying. We had no problem with the wi fi connection very fast 😃Breakfast very good buffet style good selection make sure it is included in your stay as it will cost 12 euro per person . Staff helpful but not very knowledgable about ongoing events on news year eve which is a little strange !!!! Local tourist info offices very good for tourist attractions who pointed us in the right direction and found a very good place called The Church 👍I would recommend this hotel but I would say it's not 4 star good value for money& good night time security can't use the lifts or stairs without ur room key",3,2016,01,03
231,Christmas market. Night out. ,"This hotel is beautiful.
We visited Monday 21st Dec.

231,Adequate. ,"Not 4 star but a decent location and clean.  North of the river but a close enough walk to pubs. 
Walls are pretty thin though.  Breakfast is not included. 
Dublin is an overrated city though - Galway is better. 
Not sure why you have to leave 200 characters in the Twitter world .........",4,2016,01,03
231,Comfy bed,"Very well located hotel with a great view over Dublin.

Room:
Not the largest, but well sound isolated and clean. 

Bed:
Very large and comfortable, wish i had the same back home.

Staff:
Thanks, very friendly and commited people with the sweet irish edge.

WiFi:
They claimed one gets premium wifi for free if you book online. It didn't work for me, and nobody seemed to know how to solve it - except upgrading it against charge (yeah right). The regular connection was about enough to download an e-mail, but thats about how far it gets.

---

A personal remark, maybe not an issue to anyone else, but jurys inn doesn't offer a toilet brush... meaning you either need to call the staff after every business or wait until the next housekeeping round to have it cleaned again. If you're not alone in a room it might be a bit odd to have the porcelaine painted all times... I'll bring my own next time:)",4,2016,01,02
231,Centrally  located,"Jurys Inn is well located in the heart of the city and arrived by taxi from the airport via the scenic route for 31 euros and departed  direct to the airport for 23 euros. Room was available at late morning arrival which was clean and slight defect in the air con vent which was loose. Breakfast was excellent  and the staff were very helpful and must mention that Liz, Alice and Karolina were superb in catering for our requests.
The reception staff were very helpful and I would recommend this hotel and we have
been in two other 4 star hotels where the service was lacking in the Dublin City area.
Truly good value for money.  Lydia &  Martin",5,2016,01,02
231,Very Good.,"Me and my partner stayed at this hotel with my mum and elderly gran, who requires occasional use of a wheelchair.

It was very important I found a wheelchair friendly hotel and spent a lot of time researching and finally decided on here.

I emailed ahead to request we were placed near facilities and in rooms nearby, having already requested a disabled friendly room.

Check in was not too great, the young chap advised us our allocated rooms 212/211 were not ready and it was unknown when they would be, he also noted there was a note on the account saying 'do not move'. However, he proceeded to allocate us another disabled room with second room nearby. Best intentions im sure, but when we arrived at the rooms, they were on the third floor,at the back of the hotel, around many long corridors, and the disabled room did not have a walk in shower.

I located our initially allocated rooms which were on the 2nd floor, a very short stroll from the breakfast and bar area. I went back to the young chap and explained the rooms were not suitable and we were happy to wait for our initially allocated rooms. After a bit reluctance, and my heel digging, he agreed to swap us back. We eventually checked in at 5.30pm. Those rooms were perfect and had an internal door between both rooms - very handy!

Bar is very pleasant and very resonably priced. Breakfast was very good too, those sausages were beautiful!

Location is excellent - shops, bars, restaurants and cinema right on the door step. Im a bit confused as to how some people describe the area as 'run down' or 'unsafe' - the location is exellent and typical of any city centre.

I will definately stay here again, no doubt. And will consider other Jury Inns in the future.

On a seperate note, if anybody requires wheelchair or scooter hire, visit 'Mobility Direct Ireland' website. Excellent price, delivered and collected from the hotel. Reception staff very accomodating with storing.

Taxi from the airport is approx €22.

Thanks again and will hopefully see you again soon!

",5,2016,01,01
231,Good value for money,"Good location, and great value with bed and breakfast! We arrived from our flight at 9:30 and our rooms were ready to check in which was brilliant. Our final day we left our bags after we checked out and picked them up around 17:00 to go for our bus.

The rooms were spacious; breakfast was plentiful although it was very busy, and there was a queue for tables which was slightly frustrating. 

The hotel is within walking distance of most attractions, and very close to bus stops etc. We got a return ticket on the 747 express bus from Dublin airport to O'Connell Street for €10 (half hr trip) - very close to the hotel.",4,2016,01,01

231,Central Location,"We enjoyed our stay here, a few glitches on arrival. Good service and facilities, room slightly better than a budget travel lodge.

231,Great Hotel,All the staff at the hotel were very friendly and polite. The breakfast had a wide variety and all of it was good. The rooms were nice and the location was not too bad. Overall it was one of the best hotels we've been in. ,5,2015,12,28
231,Fair and nice location,"Very nice location, walking distance to the Temple Bar District where the best pubs are. Also very close to the best Shopping streets. Breakfast should be more International and less British/Irish like with more healthy options. In general is a fair hotel. Special thanks to the nice staff.",3,2015,12,27
231,Exploring Dublin,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in central Dublin.  Not only do the facilities look exactly as it does on their website but they also serve a mean breakfast, to help you start your day!  Everything even Temple bar district is less then 1km from the hotel.",5,2015,12,27
231,chtistmas dinner was poor,"1st time we stay in Dublin hotel with my partner.
ROOM WAS ALL RIGHT ,PRETTY GOOD
breakfast was better then expected.

 BUT BUT  Family Christmas Dinner was very poor, location we sit is very bad, very noisy, not peaceful , food quality, taste and quantity wise worst then bad 
service was poor, even i ask to manager to change the location but she dined us and offering the sofa seat someone else feel very bad and embarrassing.
its very insulting, then both of decide never come back again any jury inn hotel",3,2015,12,27
231,central location,"Ideal location for any city centre event, excellent shopping adjacent  to Henry St, Ilac Centre shopping. also close to Hospitals also taxis outside front door resturant across street ideal for snacks ect. aenjoyed our stay will be back",4,2015,12,25
231,Dublin City Break,Ideally located. Very good value for money. Rooms are very spacious and well serviced. Restaurant and bar serve excellent meals. The staff are very friendly and always helpful. Fully recommended establishment.,5,2015,12,25
231,Couldn't have been better!,"Great location, great price, great stay! We couldn't have asked for a smoother trip, our room was ready early and check wasn't until 12. The location was perfect for eating and drinking in the evening - could not recommend more highly! ",5,2015,12,24
231,"Lovely hotel, excellent location.","We spent 2 nights here on a seasonal visit to the city. Hotel was comfortable, rooms clean and modern with everything you would expect - teamaking, hairdryer, iron and board etc. Staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was one of the best I have ever had in a hotel. Can't wait to return!",5,2015,12,23
231,Easy access to centre,"This hotel is a short stroll from the Temple bar area. Well served by bus links. The room we had 426 was spacious, with a bathroom. The bathroom let the room down, it was tired and needs a refurb. The staff were friendly. We arrived at 9am in the morning and were allowed straight up to our room ( no early check in fee so big tick). We had breakfast included which was ok but a bit of a rugby scrum, the staff did struggle to keep the hot plates topped up and they ran out of knives. Personally I wouldn't bother if I stayed again as there are loads of places locally to eat. There was a bag storage area for your bags whe you check out. The checkout time is midday. There are no room safes although I think you can leave valuables at reception.",4,2015,12,23
231,Excellent value for money,"This hotel is in great location, fantastically clean and well decorated. Staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms were lovely, very comfy beds. Only complaint I'd have is the heating, it was too hot everywhere lol but that could be due to the mild tempature we were having in December",5,2015,12,23
231,Great location,"Spent a couple of nights here in December.   Great location - after worrying that the hotel may be a bit out of the way I couldn't have been more wrong.  Plenty of pubs, shops and eateries on the doorstep.   Turn left out the hotel, then left again and your in the middle of a busy shopping area with high street shops and some market stalls.  A 15 minute stroll from the hotel to the River Liffey bridges that take you into the Temple Bar area.   Wouldn't hesitate to return.",4,2015,12,23
231,family stay,very clean tidy hotel have stayed before staff very friendly close to all that we wanted to see and do dinner was excellent no trouble for the kitchen staff when my two kids picked from a different menu,4,2015,12,22

Staff go above and beyond 
Rooms great food great
Location brilliant and Dublin fantastic 
Be booking to go again very soon",5,2015,12,22
231,A golden wedding anniversary to remember.,"The four-day visit to Dublin was a present from our sons for our 50th anniversary.  It lived up to every expectation.  The general standard of the hotel was excellent in every way; a breakfast choice to suit anyone, a very good restaurant with good value for money, and above all a most pleasant and helpful staff. It all added up to a most memorable stay.",5,2015,12,22
231,Excellent service,"Staff went out of their way to assist, very helpful. Could adjust heating in room, thankfully, as so far on our trip we have been stuck with overheated rooms making it difficult to sleep. Excellent location to get to Trinity College, Book of Kells exhibition & city night life. Loved Dublin!",5,2015,12,22
231,Excellent Location,It was a very comfortable stay. The staff was very helpful in fact they were the ones who suggested us to go visit The Church which was an excellent pub. The place was located centrally and very close to high street as well as temple bar area. All the places were at walking distance from this property.,4,2015,12,22
231,Great central hotel in Dublin,"Jurys Inn Parnell is a really great central hotel in Dublin.  You can reach all the sites and restaurants on foot, passing through nice decorated shops and interesting areas.  The hotel is super clean and the room are quite big in size.  The breakfast is delicious and always fresh.  Staff is great and ready to help you out with your requests.  Will definitely use Jurys Inn in the future. ",4,2015,12,22
231,Would recommend this hotel to others,Very good location only a few minutes away from Dublin's bustling bar and shopping scene. Buffet breakfast included which was a nice start to our mornings. Have stayed here before and would stay again. ,4,2015,12,21
231,Great hotel,We stayed with our 2 children in a family room. The hotel was lovely and in a perfect location for a Dublin break everywhere was within walking distance. The staff were all helpful and polite. We would definitely book this hotel for our next trip over. ,5,2015,12,21

231,GREAT CITY CENTRE LOCATION,"So handy - just around the corner from O'Connell Street. 
Nice room and decor. Bed very comfortable and it was all very clean.
There was a good bathroom - spotless and with a good shower and plenty of towels.
The breakfast was excellent. Everything you could ask for.
This was our second stay in Jurys. It's a very busy hotel but good to stay in if you want to do a bit of shopping or see the sights or go to the theatre. A good hotel to use as a base in Dublin.we
It's about ten to fifteen minutes walk from Connolly Train Station (at a leisurely pace). So it is really handy.
Also there is free Wifi.",5,2015,12,21
231,Christmas Visit,"Jurys Inn  Parnell Street , excellently situated just off O`Connell Street. Arrived on an early morning flight and greeted by friendly efficient staff. We were allowed to leave our bags in a secure area until our room was available (2pm) Our room was on the 5th floor overlooking Parnell Street, it was of an adequate size equipped with tea and coffee making facilities, rooms are cleaned daily, only down side traffic noise can be heard in the room even with windows fully closed also sound insulation between rooms could do with improving. Breakfast was great consisting of cooked full Irish, choice of ( bacon, sausage, white & black pudding, fried, scrambled & boiled eggs, tomatoes, fried sliced potatoes & beans) cereals, fresh fruit, cold meats were also available and were all constantly being replenished. Tip get down for breakfast before 9.15am as a rush seems to happen around this time. Can not fault any of the staff who could not do enough for us during our 3 day stay.",4,2015,12,20
231,Perfect location,"Across the street is a Tesco market and a great restaurant.  You are less than a minute walk from a bank and the main tourist road.  The rooms were on the small side and the breakfast was nothing to be exciting about.  The place was clean.  The WiFi was inconsistent and not reliable.  Stay away from the low number rooms (301, 302, etc...).  They are next to the elevators, and when the drunks come in at 3 in the morning, they will wake you up.",4,2015,12,19
231,Holiday,"Very good location , restaurant and reception staff very helpfull , excellent breakfast , very clean room and hotel. I recomend this hotel . Very close to all attractions especially Temple area. The hotel have a modern Pub that makes you feel relaxing.",5,2015,12,19
231,Great hotel,Very reasonably priced. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Very clean and well maintained. Would definitely stay again. Had my children with me and found the hotel to be very child friendly. We had bar good which was reasonably priced and the kids got little puzzle and coloring packs to keep them busy. ,5,2015,12,19
231,Friendly staff,"Stayed here for three days recently and in many ways it is your average hotel, nothing special but comfortable and convenient. However what stood out was the friendliness of the staff, particularly Jenny who checked me in. She was warm, welcoming and a mine of information. Thanks for such a good first impression of Dublin.",4,2015,12,18
231,Pat orourke,"Pleasant hotel in central Dublin  just off oconell st 
The rooms  are pleasant check in was quick and pleasant  the food is good and the bar is nice I received comp 10/% discount at check in for food and drink as well as a comp costa coffee  I stayed before it has improve d ",4,2015,12,18
231,wicked 50th weekend,"Great hotel very clean and very friendly staff, and a nice breakfast in the morning, this hotel is ideally suited for temple bar area which is just a 5 minute walk away. Also the tram is only a short walk away too and this will take you to the Guinness factory",4,2015,12,17
231,Decent hotel. ,"Stayed here with my wife during our 2 night stay in Dublin. 
A nice clean and friendly hotel. 
Definitely recommend staying and we would chose to stay here again on our return. 
Good spacious lobby and very friendly receptionist who gave us lots of information and recommended a nice place to eat in the city centre. 
A nice bar on the second floor which was reasonably priced, maybe a bit more than I normally pay but not extortionate. 
Our room was spacious and clean, although the heating didn't seem to work too well, either cold or baking hot. Couldn't find the middle ground. 
Central to the tram and the city centre with just a few minutes walk to most things. 
A great stay and worth a visit to Jurys Inn Parnell St ",5,2015,12,16
231,"Excellent staff, excellent room and superb location","After coming to this hotel for several years it is only getting better. Great experience, great location and superb staff. No on site car park but several very local to the hotel. Always recommend this hotel to friends/family.",4,2015,12,15
231,Shopping trip,Perfect for a city break. Staff friendly. Had a triple room which was very spacious. Within walking distance of the shops and offered discount car parking nearby. Reasonably priced. Quiet at nighttime as corridors seem to have doors at the end so cuts down on noise from bar etc.,5,2015,12,15
231,Super stay,"A 3 night stay was made enjoyable with a stay at the Jurys .
Staff on reception were very friendly and helpful and the housekeeping always had a good morning and a smile .
Just 1 thing more towels please ",4,2015,12,15
231,Jurys Inns need to up the game,"I stayed at the Jurys Inn, Parnell Street during one of my business trips to Dublin. Both the Conrad and the Doubletree by Hilton (my standard preferences) were not available and I had to book in this property for the night. 

I do not fully understand the business model of this chain of hotels - the rooms are average, there are no basic toiletries (things come in dispensers - which definitely gives a cheap feel to the whole experience), quality of beds is average and everything is 'extra'. The surprising part is that these hotels are also comparable in price to the much better properties that the Hilton group offers in the city centre while providing only a fraction of the quality. 

The breakfast buffet is nothing to write home about and leaves much to be desired. The overall quality of check-in and check-out was also not great. Probably the key thing to recommend the hotel is its location and not much else. There are other hotels available in the city at better prices OR better hotels at the same prices.",3,2015,12,15
231,Great Dublin get away,"Just returned back from a long weekend in the beautiful Dublin staying at the jury's inn . Great location , easy friendly check in on arrival. Room adequate very clean and comfortable  tidied everyday . Breakfast lovely plenty of choice got very busy the later you arrived for breakfast would recommend you got there by 9 o,clock to elevate waiting time for a table . Will certainly be returning next year .....",4,2015,12,15
231,Perfect location,"Stayed here for a few days with the love of my life. Brilliant location for the shops and O'connell street. Only a short walk to the river Liffey and obviously Temple bar with lovely pubs and restaurants. The room was comfortable and the breakfast was good, buffet style so eat as much as you like to set you up for the day. We would recommend this hotel. ",5,2015,12,15
231,Judged to be pretty good!,"Chosen as a base for a few days on returning to Dublin, to see things we didn't manage to get to last time! Very clean and well decorated both in the public rooms and bedrooms and Staff very helpful and courteous. Bed very comfortable, bedroom warm and ""soundproof"", needed as the hotel is on a main road. Bathroom very clean with clean towels each day, although the hotel is keen on ""reuse"" policy. One slight problem, only one chair in a room that could sleep three people? Breakfast very good, with plenty of choice of both continental and full English, but was a bit hectic at around 9.00 am! We did eat at the hotel on the first night but we were very disappointed. Fair to say there was a large party eating at the same time as us, but service was slow, food was not hot, and sin of sins - my starter of smoked mackerel was full of bones, and not good to eat. We did complain and the staff were most apologetic but we decided not to chance it again. All in all a good place to stay, near to Henry Street shopping area, tour buses on O'Connoll Street which are a must and a cozy place to get your head down.",4,2015,12,15
231,Excellent staff and hotel.,"Loved our 3 days at this fantastic hotel.
Never felt so welcomed or had such wonderful staff who helped constantly anywhere else. Amazing! We will be returning there next year for another fantastic trip. Definitely recommend it. ",5,2015,12,15
231,"Good value, good location and great staff.","We had a lovely stay with two young kids. Would definitely recommend as a good location if visiting Dublin. Clean, good food and friendly staff. Don't be put off by the area. Will definitely stay again.",4,2015,12,15
231,Dublin for the festive!!,"Durys was a real find. Centrally located close to O'Connel St. Great value, exceptionally clean and well serviced rooms with a hotel team that were exceptional. Could not recommend this hotel highly enough!!",5,2015,12,15
231,Surprisingly great stay!,"I stayed here for one night, and didn't really expect much. However, I was pleasantly surprised! The hotel was very modern, very clean and the staff were excellent - everyone from receptionists, waiting staff and cleaners were extremely friendly and helpful! Breakfast was great too. Good value for money, especially for the city centre location. I would definitely stay here again!",5,2015,12,15
231,Great hotel for everyone,"Handy hotel for shopping and shows, very close to train station for those travelling on the Enterprise. Clean hotel with spacious rooms. No noise from next room. Great price for overnight stay. We had to leave before breakfast so reception staff organised a breakfast bag to be provided for us. Handy on the train home. Would stay again.",5,2015,12,15
231,Perfectly adequate for the price,"Came here to celebrate the wife's birthday and booked online through Booking.com. Having had a poor experience of the Jurys Inn in Newcastle on previous birthday breaks I was not expecting great things.

However I was pleasantly surprised by the overall first impression gained on arrival at reception. The receptionist was friendly and efficient. The room we had booked was correct (a twin bedded) and everything we needed to know was explained.

The room itself was clean and in good decorative order. The room was on the inside of the 5th Floor and looked out over a quadrangle courtyard on the 2nd floor, no Street noise so relatively quiet ( see later for the reality of this).

Bathroom was fitted out to a good standard and it was nice to see that soap, shower and shampoo dispensers were fitted and full. There was also a facial tissue dispenser, again with tissues! Clearly, 3 * ratings have been more than met.

Breakfast was buffet style in the main restaurant and to a very good standard. The ergonomics were nearly perfect, save for the cold milk and the cereal selection being separated by some distance at the rear of the servery. This had not been an issue on our first morning, as the cereal selection had been set on the back wall adjacent to the cold milk dispenser.  For some reason this layout was not repeated during the week.

All the cooked food was nicely kept hot in the servery and was kept topped up regularly. I had no issues with the quality unlike some of your 1* reviews, so either they are extremely fussy or the hotel has taken notice and implemented appropriate changes.

The bar on the 2nd floor served food and drink and evening meals were taken there. All the dishes ordered were to a good standard, tasty and correctly served by friendly and helpful bar staff.

OK that's all the good stuff. Now for the less impressive experience. Like many modern city centre hotels, rooms are built to a standard which generally means thin walls between rooms, doors that can slam shut noisily and, due to market competition, offer deals that attract perhaps less 'sophisticated' clientele whose sole aim is to have a good time, as noisily as possible, late into the night, without care or consideration for other guests. 

Jurys Inns are no exception in this respect and so if you are looking for a quiet relaxing break, then this and other similar hotels are not for you. The advent of stag and hen weekends away in a convenient city that can be reached in a couple of hours flying, has changed the very nature of tourism as we know it. 

However, we have only ourselves to blame on the basis that we have booked cheap flights and hotel deals. Jurys in common with many other hotel chains, are catering for the demands of the market and following the money.

On this basis, only 3* review even though it was a 4* stay.",3,2015,12,14
231,Jurys Dublin Experience,"The staff were amazing. Extremely efficient and friendly - nothing was too much bother. They made you feel you were right at home.
The location in Parnell St. was just perfect and so central to whatever you wished to do.      ",5,2015,12,14
231,Dublin city break,"This hotel was an excellent choice for a city break. Clean and well kept with kind and courteous staff. Excellent breakfasts, well worth the money. Just off the main street, far enough away from the noise of the Temple Bar but close enough to get there with a short stroll.Close to the main shopping areas, just around the corner from the hop on hop off city bus tours. Murray's Bar just around the corner with live music and Irish dancing and great food every night. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,12,14
231,Great Hotel & Location,"We enjoyed our stay & loved the location, we walked to everything.  The rooms are updated, comfortable & clean. The breakfast which was included with our stay was very good with a nice selection of hot & cold items. We would definitely choose this hotel chain again if available when we travel. If traveling by air the buses that go to Dublin Airport are about a 5 minutes walk away.",4,2015,12,13
231,A great stay.,"Was visiting Dublin for a few days for my mum's birthday. I let the hotel know and they left a card and fruit in her room, a great touch. Hotel is ideally placed with clean, modern comfy rooms. Couldn't have asked for more.",5,2015,12,13
231,Good central hotel,"My family and I stayed at this hotel on two occasions during November on a trip to Ireland. The hotel is well placed for transport links and within walking distance to all the sights to see throughout the city.

Check in on both occasions was quick and easy. Hotel staff were always helpful and always had a smile. Family rooms consist of a double bed and a fold out sofa - which was sufficient for two adults and two young children, but I found the room a little cramped.  The bedding was very comfortable. The room was well decorated and the bathrooms were clean and fresh.

The buffet breakfast was well stocked, tasty and was value for money, although the orange juice was on the watery side. The common areas were clean. Each floor had a vending machine and an ice machine.  The baggage storage area is secure and well run.

I would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel on future trips to Dublin, or recommending it to others who want a central hotel and a good price.",5,2015,12,13
231,Nice stay but could be improbed,"My partner and I stayed here for 2 nights. 
Lovely stay. The bedroom was clean and a pleasure to stay in. The staff were friendly and the receptionists were very helpful. However, the breakfast sadly let down the standard of the hotel. I understand when you go for breakfast at 10am, it will be busy but the hall for food I found far too small. We had to wait a good while for a table and constantly wait about for the new food to be brought out. The bacon was undercooked and the toast machines were ancient and took forever. Considering this hotel is quite expensive I would have expected a better breakfast. Nevertheless, I would return to this hotel, as the rooms were lovely and the location was brilliant. ",3,2015,12,13
231,Average,"I found this hotel average at all levels. Rooms were nothing special, but they were clean. Staff were nice enough. The food was ok but I could have went somewhere with better food in Dublin for the same price. All in all I just found this hotel OK I will not return as I could stay somewhere nicer for the same price.",3,2015,12,13
231,Great Staff very helpful,Great location in city centre within walking distance to main shopping area. Rooms were spotless and beds very comfortable. Staff were very friendly and helpful.Food in bar was delicious. Taxis available outside the main entrance.,5,2015,12,12
231,Very small room,We stayed here for one night. The staff on reception were very polite and friendly however the room was tiny. It had a double bed (the most uncomfortable I've ever slept in) and sofa bed. I honestly felt smothered in d room and the bathroom. The sink and the bath in the bathroom itself were clean but had cracks in it would stay here again purely for the location the prices they charge are not worth the amenities and services that is provided ,3,2015,12,11
231,Restful and welcoming hotel in the heart of Dublin,"On arrival to the hotel we were greeted warmly by the staff. William made every effort
To ensure all we needed was provided.  Arranged for us to have our meal during the lunch as we were out that evening at a show. Hotel was spotless and the. Rooms big and bright . Beds very comfy",5,2015,12,11
231,40th celebrations,"Stayed here for 2 nights in November and it was great for our group of 23! There's a place across the road that does a great breakfast if you don't want to eat at the hotel and a great pub 2 minutes away that was very welcoming, great food and Guinness!!!!! A short walk to everything - highly recommended.",5,2015,12,11
231,"Beyond expectations, fabulous hotel.","Fab hotel, clean, quiet, comfortable rooms, there are all the comforts. Breakfast at last for us Italians we love the cappuccino with sweets, abbandante above forecasts. Its location is unique, walk around the corner you are in the center. I highly recommend it, that is all you pay.",5,2015,12,10
231,City break,We really enjoyed staying here. The hotel is very central to shops restaurants etc. We requested a quiet room and our request was given very much apreciated. We paid for our breakfast as we only booked bed only but it was worth it. ,5,2015,12,09
231,Nice hitel,"Centrally located.  Nice hotel.  Good breakfast with lots of choice.  Very busy breakfast area had to ask for bowls knives but this was not the fault of hotel it was very busy.   Would definitely stay again.  Good value.  Rooms had everything you would need, iron, drinks, hairdryer.  ",4,2015,12,09
231,Dublin in early December,"We stayed in Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street in early December 2015. Our stay was one of the best we ever had in this hotel. This was partly due to the generosity of Jurys reward scheme but to the kindness, help and professionalism of a very dedicated staff. We would certainly recommend this ideally located city centre hotel  to anyone interested in having a great holiday in Dublin.",5,2015,12,09
231,"clean, close to everything","stayed here last christmas while visiting Dublin. Great location, very very clean, and also very secure. I would gladly stay here again and plan on doing so in the spring. really close to everything, as Dublin is fairly small, but not in a super loud area which is nice.",5,2015,12,09
231,Small and Corporate,"Even though we booked a family room, the rooms are small and there was very little room to move about. The carpet was stained and the beds had not been moved or cleaned as the underneath was dusty and had a condom wrapper underneath the bed. Room service was done daily but at weird times. 1st morning rooms were done while we were at breakfast the next day they were done later so we were using the same towels for our showers.When making a query about the room just before we traveled I informed reservations that it was my wife's birthday, was told that they would do something special in room, but never did. Disappointed",3,2015,12,09
231,"Good quick stay, helpful staff","We stayed just the one night before heading off to see the rest of Ireland, and enjoyed the visit. We arrived at the hotel thoroughly jet-lagged just before check-in time, and it was a great relief that one of our two rooms was already available. The staff was friendly and answered all of our questions about the area. Loved the location, not just the proximity to shopping but also conveniences like the grocery across the street, perfect for finding snacks for the kids.",4,2015,12,08
231,Christmas friends weekend,"An excellent venue for a group to meet up for a Christmas gathering. Easy access to all parts of the city and the airport.  Staff very welcoming and a clean hotel.

231,A great weekend!,"Stayed at this hotel as part of a group of 13 pensioners for the weekend 4 - 7 December 2015. All staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful. 

Breakfasts were just great plenty of choice and well prepared.

Rooms and beds superbly comfortable. Good quality sleep to be had. Extra pillows provided in the rooms if required. Free wifi throughout was a bonus.

There was only one minor complaint that some of the hot food was served on cold plates which took the edge of what was otherwise and excellent meal.",5,2015,12,08

Well done all round.",4,2015,12,07
231,Anne &Tom,"We have stayed in this hotel many times over the last few years during our annual visit to Dublin. It's in an ideal location for shops, pubs, theatres and a short taxi ride away from the National concert hall where we enjoy many of the Christmas shows. The breakfast choice is large and varied and the food in the bar excellent and reasonably priced. The staff are pleasant and friendly.

231,Brilliant friendly hotel,"From checking to exit this was a first class experience. Staff were very friendly,professional and helpful though out our stay. Nice front view room very clean and well kept. Excellent value restaurant for dinner. Breakfast was a bit disorganised flow of the lay out was poor making people crisis cross all over the place. Some periods it was hard for staff to keep the buffet stocked up.",5,2015,12,06
231,Marina and the Diamonds/Hubbys birthday,"What a great hotel. We checked in on Wednesday and was greeted by reception staff -anca - she was a fit of knowledge, issued us with a map and pointed out all places of interest. She even gave us a great place to eat for our tea called ""the church"" which I must say topped the day off well. The hotel staff overall were friendly, helpful and on hand. Our room was clean had plenty of space and a good view over the Main Street. We went In the bar on our level number 2 which was very relaxed. We didn't eat at the hotel but there was a restaurant. The hotel is in an ideal place, close to shops, pubs and places to eat. A fab stay and a place where I would stay again. ",5,2015,12,06
231,Excellent visit!! ,"Stayed here for 2 nights while visiting Dublin for the first time. The hotel is very central and in a prime location for shopping and site seeing. 

The staff are extremely friendly especially one man who took our luggage into a room for us he couldn't do enough to help us. We were on a b&b basis and the breakfast was lovely, the food was piping hot and a really good selection. 

The room was very clean and nicely laid out, the furniture was to good standard the bed however was on wheels so it moved if you moved. The bathroom was very nice, the bed was comfy and pillows were huggable. The only niggle I have is that the wifi is only free for 24hrs so we had to purchase a premium upgrade so we could have it for longer. 

Perfect stay for a short city break!! Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit Dublin! ",5,2015,12,05
231,Great location ,"We stayed here for 3 nights at the start of December. The hotel is situated in a great location. We had planned to use the bus or luas to make our way around the city but in the end we walked everywhere including Trinity College, St Stephens Green, Guinness Storehouse and Jamesons amongst others. 

Working in the hospitality industry I can find myself to be quite critical. The cleanliness of the hotel in both public areas and bedrooms was great and all the staff were very attentive and willing to help when asked either for booking taxis or recommendations for places to go and restaurants to visit.

We are already planning to return to Dublin and stay here with our little boy! ",4,2015,12,05
231,4 Day break,"An excellent hotel in a great location for shopping and all attractions .Staff extremely helpful and courteous at all times .Cleanliness of rooms perfect .Overall would be hard to find such high quality accomodation for reasonable price .

231,negative!!!!!!! staff are brutal!,"Double check your booking even if your have confirmed details because it was over booked when I arrived, the staff told us we would have an upgraded room for a second night and it was all lies. We went back and they send it wasn't a superior room but a superior package. It was a horrific experience for anyone traveling on business your hotel is supposed to be your escape from the madness however it was our most stressed situation.

231,Very Good Hotel!,"My family and I stayed at Jurys Inn over the US Thanksgiving Holiday.  We were all very happy with the hotel.  The rooms were very nice and had everything you need, plus a very good value.  And they were clean! The hotel is very close to everything in the city.  From the hotel to Trinity College or Temple Bar area was only 10 minutes.
The hotel employees at the front desk were always very helpful, and the breakfast was great - lots of everything.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,12,03

231,Excellent hotel,"My recent stay was an excellent experience.The front hall manager and staff on duty when I arrived were very welcoming.
My room was confortable and well furnished and on a high floor just as I requested.
It was also very clean and well maintained.
Breakfast was good with a selection of warm and cold buffet choices.
The Xmas decorations in the hotel were lovely and made things seem warm and festive.
Each and every one of the staff I encountered made my stay a pleasant one.
Internet was free and worked perfectly.
My stay was reasonably priced and good value for money.

The only slightly negative point was due to the fact that my room looked on to the re-cycling plant.On my last morning I was woken at 7am by vehicles depositing waste there.It was not pleasant looking out onto the plant where different types of waste were being sorted.",4,2015,12,03
231,wonderful Jury's experience,"Jury's Parnell St was a lovely hotel to stay in. The Staff were so friendly and helpful  and the hotel was spotlessly clean. We will gladly return.

Breakfast was very good, and a good choice and tasty, and plentiful. Staff are friendly and professional, also the dinner experience is good, nice menus and dinner was great. Wi fi is fast - I had superior experience though, which upgrades the wi fi. Only downside was my room was at the back - ask for a front room, otherwise its a hike to your room!
I would stay here again, and recommend to friends as well. ",5,2015,12,03
231,Brithday Adventure,"I stayed here with my fiance for my birthday this year in summer. The hotel was very clean, in a great location and the breaksfast which was included in the stay was very impressive. Usually hotel breakfasts can be hit and miss but this was consistently good for our 5 night stay. The location is literally seconds walk away from O'Connell Street and for the price it is definitely worth it. They staff were very lovely in dealing with our slighlty early arrival, taking our bags until our room was ready so we could go and explore until we could check in. The room was cleaned and fresh towels were provided daily. They could be left outside the room if you were still sleeping which is great because you don't have to go anywhere if you need them. Wi-fi was included and to say that it was free meant it was particulary quick, but much better than a potentially huge phone bill. This would be good for any kind of traveller, single for business, family, couples or friends - it is a good package of what you need. I would look to stay here again in the future.",5,2015,12,03
231,Great place to stay in central city,"Great reduction at qpark for parking, and kept bags for us after and before check in. terrific service. Shopping centre close by witrh lost of bars and restaurents to choose from. Easy access to transport

I would definately recommend this hotel clean friendly and quiet rooms. 

      
      ",5,2015,12,02
231,Good city hotel,"Rooms good size, food was good, overall nice central place to stay. Only complaint was the hotel administration, 1st of all they could not find my booking and had us waiting for 20 minutes in reception and then on our 1st morning we found they had only booked us as room only. Had to go back to get that sorted out to include breakfast. I expect better from this Hotel, I would go back there if in Dublin but I would phone the day before to check my booking.",4,2015,12,02
231,"Clean hotel, lovely breakfast, good all round.","Me and my partner stayed here for 2 nights on 21st November. The hotel was really easy to find, we got on the express shuttle coach from Dublin airport for €7 each which dropped us off right on O'Connell street. It took us a few minutes to walk to the hotel on Parnell street. Really nice lobby area, very modern. On checking in, we were told that they did not have our reservation (even though I had an email in front of me which confirmed I paid for the room months ago!) after 30 minutes or so, the problem was resolved and we could finally go up to our room to un-pack.
The rooms are spacious and clean with tea and coffee making facilities. Little disappointed they didn't offer a safe in the room and the bathroom was a little on the small side but other than that it was more than adequate for our 2 night stay.
The breakfast was absolutely lovely, a buffet serving pretty much anything and it was all roasting hot fresh food. Really nice.
We had a drink in the bar area too which was really nice and modern.
The hotel itself is a short walk away from the shops and about a 10 minute walk from all the main Irish bars and restaurants so a good location all round. 
There is a lovely restaurant/bar on the main high street called 'The Church' which was amazing. They had live bands on and the food is amazing.
Wouldn't recomend a trip to the Guinness factory to be honest, 5 story building on how they make Guinness which after 5 minutes is slightly boring haha. 
The only other thing to point out about the hotel was the use of your room key. You had to use it when entering the lifts, toilets, just about any room in the hotel which was slightly annoying if you were just running back to your room for something! But I can understand it's to stop other people entering the hotel which is a good point I suppose. 
All in all, we had a really pleasant stay and I would recommend it to anyone. Just bare in mind Dublin is an expensive place, food and drinks are dear but we had a great weekend. Loved the craic!",4,2015,12,02

231,Nice Hotel,"Overall we had a nice stay at this hotel, rooms were nice and clean and staff friendly.  We did have a problem with our heating in the room as it was freezing but staff were quick enough to bring a heater and within 10 minutes heated it up quite quickly.  We were in room 227, same floor as bar and restaurant but was nice and quiet.  Breakfast though was very hectic and was hard to find a table and the ones that were empty still had empty plates on even though the staff were working very hard.  Just a shame as the breakfast service area could be bigger as well as the seating area. We were near to the shopping areas and a 15 minute walk to Temple Bar. ",4,2015,12,01

231,Great location,"The location of the hotel is really good. We got the airlink bus from the airport and got off not far from the hotel and it was easy to get another one back to the airport. We walked to all touristy and shopping places and there is a tesco opossite the hotel which is open till 11pm. Our room was large facing the street. 

The only 2 things which let this hotel down were the level of cleaning in the room; our mugs were not changed, water was not left and bins were not emptied every day. The other issue was the breakfast which I believe was not to the standard I have seen in other Jury's Inns. 

Magda at the front desk was great and stood out from the other staff. A big thanks to her for making the stay more pleasant.",4,2015,11,30
231,Great Hotel,"Great hotel in the centre of Dublin. 2 mins from O'Connell street and 10 mins walk from the Temple Bar area. Friendly staff, great accommodation and good breakfast.

231,"Jury's hotel, Parnell st, Dublin","This hotel was ideally situated just off O'Connell st, which is the main & well known street in Dublin. Not a large looking hotel frontage but when you enter the lobby it is well lit with modern decor. The receptionists were so polite & friendly & very helpful. Because we arrived so early & unable to book in until after 2pm, they took our luggage & held them in a safe room until we were able to take them to our room.
Our room was very clean & more than adequate for our short stay of 3 days.
Only gripe was the mattress was a bit hard for me but its hard to please everybody I guess but there was a choice of firmer or soft pillows.
The breakfast was self serve & absolutely delicious with a varied choice of cereals, teas, juices, coffee & full English which you could pick your choices.
There are 5 floors with ours being on the 4th but there is a lift thankfully.
This is a hotel we would definitely stay at again.",5,2015,11,28

Lovely reception .Family  room could be a little bigger. Very clean 
I thought the breakfast was expensive was little expensive. 
We went to Anna bakery for breakfast. It was lovely it was deceiving from out side. It a huge place.

I certainly would recommend it to anyone wishing to stay in the city centre, particularly if attending a performance at  the Gate theatre as it is a 2 minute walk. The room was warm, spacious & comfortable with tea making facilities. In addition, the food choice & quality in the bar & restaurant were excellent. All the staff were friendly & very helpful , I mention Jose in the restaurant in particular & Eva at reception. The personal touch to their work was genuine & appreciated. It was interesting to find the breakfast plates were hot!!! A large number of hotels fall down on this basic detail. I am delighted to have discovered this hotel & definitely intend to re visit.

The room was warm , clean and very comfortable, very comfortable bed. The staff everywhere were very pleasant and helpful. The only complaint we would have would be the temperature of the breakfast buffet, despite being into the restaurant at just after 7am when they opened for business, we found the porridge Luke warm, the fried eggs, just warm, the scrambled eggs warm, NOTHING WAS HOT. The choice at breakfast was fantastic, couldn't have been better, the only draw back was the temperature of the food.   I did report it to the staff in the restaurant, also to the reservation staff who said they would pass on my complaint. We did enjoy a good meal in the evening for one night. The other 2 nights we enjoyed two local restaurants close by, Nando's and just across the way from the hotel you'll find THE KINGFISHER, it's top class for fish and chips, well worth a visit.",4,2015,11,26
231,Think of Dublin & Stay at Jurys,"A hotel positioned in the perfect location for access to the best shopping and bars, cafes and restaurants not to mention to coach links to the airport and most city buses seem to pass close by.  The Hotel is quiet and the staff very friendly and accommodating.  Having stayed here many times before surely there is no better testimonial!",5,2015,11,24
231,Escape to Dublin for 2 days,"Those looking for a short, not too expensive city break this isn't bad!
From the airport take the shuttle Airbus (cost €12 return pp) - this drops you off at O'Connell street which is just round the corner from the Jury's. 
OK - so we arrived on a Saturday, so our concern was noisy stag & hen parties. There were a few parties on our floor which filled us with dread - but in all honesty we didn't hear a thing! Maybe a few Guinness' at the Hotel bar helped :-)
Breakfast was quite busy the next morning - 9.30am is rush hour - but there is plenty of space and the food is continually replenished and top quality. 
The room itself - we had a small problem with a headboard - which was rectified within minutes of our arrival - but other than that, it suited our needs perfectly - the room was spacious, the bed was a king, there was a coffee maker, flat screen tv etc
Location of the hotel is great - O'Connell Street is where all the tour buses depart (the yellow bus at €10 per day is best value - takes you everywhere you need to go); there is the main shopping street within walking distance - and also not too far away, cross the Liffy into Temple Bar where there is more pubs than you can imagine!
So in conclusion, we felt this was a well run hotel, with extremely helpful management, and situated in a great location.",4,2015,11,24
231,Will stay again.,"Check in a bit slow, the rooms were a nice size, all maids did was make the bed through time stayed, bathroom needed a good cleaning.

231,Comfortable & friendly.,"Great value for money inc breakfast for such a short stay. Recommend it to anyone. Cleanliness, warmth, no intrusions, customer service excellent and helpful, very close for the business we had to do.

231,Warm welcome. Comfortable room. 5 minutes from centre of city.,"Stayed here with my sister for 2 nights and were both impressed with the warm welcome we received from staff from the beginning.  The twin bedded room was very clean and comfortable with all amenities we needed; easy to control heating/air con., comfortable beds, plenty of room.  We ate in the bar and the restaurant and found the food good and reasonably priced. Would happily stay here again.",4,2015,11,19
231,Great stay,"We had a great time in this perfect location with great friendly staff.  The breakfast was 1 of the best we have ever had especially the Irish sausages which were delicious. The room was spotless with water, tea & coffee facilities & nice biscuits

231,Very nice stay,"Lovely hotel rooms. Loads to choose from at breakfast and very lovely food! Michael was a huge help, nothing was too much for him! He was lovely and so cheerful. Couldn't fault the staff at all! One thing I would say is it is SO hot here. Which is lovely if you like the heat but I did find it slightly uncomfortable at times and wouldn't like to pay the heating bills!",5,2015,11,18
231,great hotel,"Had a fantastic  time  in Dublin  the hotel was great location would stay again. Good security,  staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfasts very nice. We had interconnected room's plenty of tea and coffee. Easy to get  around.

231,Weekend break,"Super friendly staff and great location. We had a really nice stay and breakfast was good too. 
The room we booked at short notice was listed as a family room but had a pull out couch for the kids. It worked out fine but not ideal. 
      ",5,2015,11,17
231,Central location,"Very friendly staff.Hotel very central.Really enjoyed our stay.Always try to stay in jurys parnell st at it has everything on its doorstep.We went as a family with luas so near we traveled all over city.
      
      ",5,2015,11,17
231,Decent hotel close to Temple Bar area,"The hotel is nice inside - the public areas. The room itself was spacious enough for two with two large suitcases. The room worked out well for our needs and we loved that there was room service available; the brownies were great! Just a note if you order nachos - the 'salsa' is sweet and all you get is the salsa, chips and sour cream; no cheese, nothing like real nachos. The location of the hotel is not bad and close to temple bar (about a 6 minute cab ride). There is a Tesco supermarket on the other side of the street. Going back to the room - the bathroom was like a Motel 6. It wasn't really dirty but was worn down. I would stay here again given the price, room size, and location.",3,2015,11,17
231,A night in Dublin,"From our arrival through to departure not a fault could be found.Security was second to none which for lone or family visitors would have to be a bonus , all members of staff we encountered were courteous and competent .Location is perfect for shopping and touring/sightseeing  trips , all in all a very pleasant stop-off on our weekend break  
      
      
      ",4,2015,11,17
231,"Great, clearn, hip, inexpensive hotel","I enjoyed my one night's stay here and found the employees helpful and friendly and the space very hip and clean.  The one downside is that the rooms do not have security boxes.  Instead, you have to get a box in the lobby where everyone (employees and others in the lobby) can see what you put into the box and what you take out.  Depending on what you put in the box - for instance, if it's something expensive - you could be leaving yourself open to theft.  The lack of a security box in my room was a big negative to me.  If you don't use a security box when you travel, then staying here shouldn't be an issue for you.",4,2015,11,16
231,Great!,Stayed here with my husband and two children. The hotel is in a great location with the Airbus dropping us off just round the corner. Most places were walkable and if not the bus and tram service were great.  The food in the hotel was good and my kids loved the ice machine!  Would recommend to anyone who is visiting Dublin. ,5,2015,11,16
231,Jurys Inn Dublin,"Very good hotel at a good location. Nice to have a kettle in a room for my own tea, but why no fridge? For Europeans, used to have mixed water taps, finding separate hot and cold water taps in the bath is neither user friendly nor comfortable - this is really oldfashioned!

231,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Very nice hotel in a good location close to shopping and eating.  Only thing that is a annoying is have to use your key to access everything including the elevators and ""public"" restroom in the lobby.  Staff is helpful and breakfast bar is amazing.

231,"Great value, great location","Spent 2 nights here on B&B basis as part of a deal through Broadway Travel. The hotel was great, good size clean room and bathroom. Friendly staff and very good breakfast. Can get busy at popular time about 9.99 am but we went earlier and had no problem and good hot food. The location is excellent, very central and ideal for a city break visit. Highly recommended, we will be back!",5,2015,11,14
231,3 days in October,"Great location just off O'Connell Street.Rooms as requested were Quiet and acceptable with coffee making facilities.The hotel bar was adequate.
Our disappointment was tne breakfast which had the worst orange juice we have ever tasted and the coffee machines,of which,only one was working and the other was often not available for many minutes while it was being refreshed.We were also disappointed when entering the breakfast area to be informed that we had to lay up our own tables.We have never had to do this in any hotel in the world.Our next visit to Dublin will not be at Jury's Inn.",3,2015,11,14
231,First trip to Dublin,"We stayed in at Jurys Inn on Parnell Street in Dublin from 11/8-11/12.  It has the perfect location.  You can walk pretty much anywhere you need to be, or a cab ride is reasonably priced for the places that you can't.  Great shopping, bars and restaurants nearby.  The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable.  You really couldn't ask for more.  I will definitely stay there again.",5,2015,11,14
231,A pleasant surprise,"Had to stay one night in Dublin unexpectedly and ended in this hotel. But it was a pleasant surprise. It don't look or feel like 3* hotel. Great location, friendly staff, nice modern rooms. It is very center of the city. Shopping nearby, restaurants, historic places, etc. Tghey offer free wifi.",5,2015,11,13

231,Perfectly situated within the city for easy access to all major facilities,"Easy access to all Dublin has to offer. Breakfast on the second morning was not as hot or well cooked as the first!!

There was a small issue in the bathroom where the wall by the toilet showed signs of damp!!

231,First timer in Dublin and Jury's Hotel,"This was our first trip to Dublin and our first time in a Jury's hotel. We picked Jury's after reading a review in the Sunday Express Magazine about their hotel in Brighton. We were impressed with the price, cleanliness and friendliness of the hotel staff. Well situated for sightseeing in Dublin. Looking forward to using them again.",4,2015,11,12
231,Budget-friendly hotel in a great location,"This hotel is perfect for people looking for hotels located in a convenient area that won't break the bank. It is located right off of O'Connell Street, which puts it within easy walking distance of a lot of the main tourist attractions in Dublin. It was very clean, with a competent and friendly staff. The buffet breakfast was delicious and it was nice that they had a coffee machine in the lobby as well!",4,2015,11,11
231,Great,"The Jurys Inn Parnell St is really well located, so close to everything. The lobby is nice and big with lovely welcome treats waiting for you. The staff are really pleasant, really making you feel welcomed. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. A very enjoyable stay.",5,2015,11,11
231,Great experience,"Great location, clean, good bar. Just what was needed. 

Bar provided a good meeting place for the group to enjoy a Guinness or a Swithwicks, there was Parnell Bar & Grill a couple of doors down for a nice bit of food and Murrays Bar & Grill a few doors down from that which provided all sorts of entertainment. Tesco (and a cash point) bang over the road, and it was an inexpensive taxi ride (or manageable walk) from Temple Bar.
      
Hotel was very comfortable, and for a group of 15 (split 3x 3ppl, 3x 2ppl rooms) we paid around £40 a night, which I consider great value for all of this.",5,2015,11,10
231,An okay hotel in Dublin,"Good location in Dublin. Very clean hotel. Everything else about this hotel was fairly average - nothing to complain about, but nothing to write home about either. Possibly a bit pricey, although our stay was during a very busy week in Dublin (Web Summit) so may not be representative. Every one in our party agreed the beds were not very comfortable.",3,2015,11,10
231,Dublin Weekend Away,"Fab hotel just off O'Connell Street. I'd noted we were arriving around 10/11, room was ready early for us - clean, well stocked, comfortable, helpful staff. Only comment is that the bed was a bit soft for me.
The location is great - central for everything from sightseeing tours, food, drink. Excellent value for money.
      ",5,2015,11,10
231,"Clean, good location, late night food","We had a good experience at the Jury's Inn Parnell Street in October of 2015. It is centrally located within Dublin making it walking distance from just about everywhere, but it's on the North side of the River Liffey, which is quieter than the busy Temple Bar area. The rooms were clean and affordable and they had everything we needed.

The views weren't great and the hotel doesn't have much ""character,"" but our goal was not to spend time in a hotel room during our vacation, so that didn't matter to us.

The staff was also very friendly. They offer 24-hour room service, which was awesome for a late night when we were hungry at 1:00am and nowhere else was open. Their spicy sausage pizza was delicious.",5,2015,11,09
231,Top Hotel with a great central location!,"Came with friends to celebrate my 30th.

Location was excellent and the rooms were clean, modern and spacious.

My partner had called ahead and a cake and balloons had been added to help make it more special.

On our first night we were rushed for time so all decided to eat in the restaurant - great decision as the food was excellent.

I would highly recommend for a Dublin stay!!",5,2015,11,09
231,Great Location,"The Location for Jurys inn is Sublime, It's only a short walk away to O'Connell Street, Henry Street and Grafton Street, as well as Temple bar. 

The Hotel itself offered free breakfast, served untill 10am, which is convenient for me.

My only minor complaint is that the walls were a little thin, and I could hear everyone's alarms going off early in the morning, which was a little annoying!

The Hotel staff could not have been more helpful and friendly! I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Dublin!",5,2015,11,09
231,Excellent Hotel (Brilliant 50th Birthday Treat),"Our first time in Dublin, I booked the Jurys Inn for 2 nights as a surprise for my husbands 50th Birthday. 

We had a wonderful stay, all the staff were very kind and helpful especially Petra on reception wishing my husband happy birthday on arrival and making sure the right room was ready for us. (I booked the superior getaway package with wine, Costa coffee, late check out etc and added breakfast each day for us).

Thank you Jurys Inn for the birthday card and the lovely fresh fruit in our room on arrival, it was a lovely surprise and very kind of you xx .

Louise C (name on bar receipt) made us very welcome in the bar and looked after us well, we didn't realise that you have to let Guinness stand for a few minuets and then top it up again! lol but we went on to learn about that at the Guinness storehouse. 

On the Saturday evening we enjoyed a delicious meal in the hotel restaurant , my husband had the rib-eye steak and I had the surf & turf skewers all washed down with a bottle of lovely wine.

We had a room on a high floor with views over the city and it was  very comfortable with plenty tea, coffee & biscuits on the refreshment tray.  Lovely to return to and relax after walking the streets of Dublin.  Breakfast was very nice and a great start to our day.
 
We managed to fit in lots of sightseeing and enjoyed Dublin's pubs, cafe's, markets, museum's and shops and the hotels in a great central location.
 
We are already thinking about planning our next visit to Dublin in the summer as we had a great time and enjoyed our stay very much thank you :)",5,2015,11,09
231,Nice Clean Hotel in a great location for walking in Dublin,"We just returned from our first trip to Ireland and stayed at the Jury's Inn Parnell St. for the week. We settled in and found that this was an ideal location for walking around Dublin. We loved that there was a Tesco's store right across the street for picking up snacks and water etc. The breakfast buffet was decent (although overun with guests at peak times). The room was clean and comfortable and we found the hotel staff we very friendly and helpful.
I would stay here again.",4,2015,11,08
231,"Helpful, friendly staff","I stayed for a weekend with my husband at the end of October. The hotel is located at the top of O'Connell Street which means it's easy to access a lot of locations of foot and the transport links (such as tourist buses) are very convenient.
The hotel itself was relatively basic but the bed was comfortable and the room was a fair size. (We did note that there wasn't a safe in our room which was a little annoying as I had to carry passports around.)
Breakfast was included in our package and this was quite high quality although both mornings it was quite busy and popular items (such as orange juice) ran out and took a little while to be replaced.
One minor issue was that when we arrived, we spotted a Malteaser under the bed. It did make us wonder what else might be lurking.....",4,2015,11,07
231,Most helpful staff I have found so far,"I loved this location, everything was closed by. I tried their restaurant and the food was superb. The staff was so polite and helpful and patient. If you plan to go to Dublin I certainly recommend this place",5,2015,11,06
231,"Good hotel, Ideal location ","My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights on our trip to Dublin, hotel was in an ideal location, close by for shopping and 10 mins walk from Temple Bar.  Rooms were clean, modern and comfortable. Drinks in hotel bar were very reasonably priced cheaper than most bars for spirits. Breakfast was nice, plenty to choose from. Definitely would stay again  on our next visit to Dublin. ",5,2015,11,06
231,Basic hotel,"Basic hotel ... ok for a couple of days have stayed in much better hotels in Dublin.  I was there during a very busy conference so average hotels were charging above average prices.  On the upside the bar area was quite nice and the location of the hotel is good for the main town

Everything about this hotel was average or below.",3,2015,11,06
231,Great all round hotel experience,"Ideally situated 1 min from O'Connel St / Aircoach stop. Airy clean modern hotel. Good sized rooms.
Good buffet breakfast and all at a very decent rate. Very good restaurant opposite and only 10 min walk to Temple Bar where excellent food and music can be found in both Gogart's and the Temple Bar pub itself.

231,Excellent Location!!,"I stayed in Jurys inn Parnell street for 2 nights. Traveled in August.
Location wise hotel is perfect for travellers, tourist and anybody in business. 
close proximity to food,shopping places.
5-10 min walking to river liffy.

Rooms are clean and quite.
Washroom had good amenities. Was clean. very good hot and cold water.
Breakfast was also good. However, at that rate they can improve their breakfast options.",5,2015,11,05
231,Dublin,"Overall good, would stay again and very pleased with staff care and standards to the customers wellbeing. Cleanliness was excellent and the rooms aswell. Bar area wasn't a good experience, waited to long to be served. 
      
      ",4,2015,11,05
231,Surprisingly happy with stay,"Very happy with staffs, friendly, hotel room, decor etc excellent. High standard. A little nervous re location of the hotel but it wasn't a problem. Book directly with hotel website and price is slightly higher than what I would normally go for but considering the location and the standard when I was inside, the price was very reasonable. Picked the hotel cause I had to attend a meeting very early in the city. Convenient just at the edge of O'Connell St and 2 mins walk to Henry St.",5,2015,11,04
231,"Excellent location, great breakfast and great staff!","This hotel was booked for us as a part of a tour package by Tenon tours.  Our flight from Chicago arrived in Dublin at the awful hour of 5:30 a.m. and we had been told by a Tenon agent that we would probably have to wait until at least 10 or 11 a.m. to get a room to rest our jet-lagged bodies. However, Adrian, the late night desk manager managed to put us in a room immediately when we arrived so we could go straight to bed and get some rest which we REALLY appreciated!!  Unfortunately, United Airlines or Aer Lingus managed to lose our luggage in transit so we did not have our stuff when we checked in.  However, the kind morning shift ladies at the front desk (Petra and Ana) kept pestering the baggage people at Aer Lingus and we managed to get our luggage the following day!  The staff at this hotel were fantastic and extremely helpful.  We also enjoyed the morning breakfast buffet every day.  One other nicety was the fact that the hotel provided us with a sack breakfast on the two days we had to leave early for a tour and then to catch our flight to Birmingham.  This was contrary to what our travel agent for Tenon Tours told us which was that the hotel wouldn't afford us this consideration.  All in all, a very pleasant experience with this hotel.  We would highly recommend it!",5,2015,11,03
231,Great Location,"Very central location to explore Dublin.  It is a very buy hotel and there was affair bit of noise to be hear from the room next to ours.  The staff were pleasant and the breakfast was quite good.  There was entertainment pack, of colouring inn, jigsaw ad snap; for the children when we had a hot chocolate in the bar in the evening which was a nice touch.  Functional and pleasant hotel and I have recommended it to others.",3,2015,11,03
231,Well positioned hotel,"Spent three nights here recently and have no major complaints. Walls are pretty thin and the free Wi-Fi is rubbish but all good apart from that. Ate in the bar and had a good steak. House-keeping staff were very friendly and accommodating. Hotel felt clean and safe despite being such a central location.
Not sure I would pay the premium to stay in a Jury's Inn over a Premier Inn but that is just personal choice.",4,2015,11,03
231,Poor Customer Service spoiled a good night,Having had an enjoyable stay in this hotel before I chose to stay here again with a large party of family members as I knew it was central to the main sites in Dublin. Check in was fine and the room large and clean. Breakfast was also very good. The only downside was with the customer service provided by the bar staff and manager in charge. One of our party is a Jury's loyalty card holder and was given a 10% off food and drink voucher on check in. However once we tried to use it on the Saturday night to buy a round of drinks it was refused. Why offer these things and then not honour them. It would have cost the hotel around 7 euro and we would have spent a lot more throughout the night. However due to this we ended up leaving the bar and spending our money in Murrays bar round the corner. Put a bit of a dampener on the evening.,2,2015,11,02
231,Weekend away,"Right in the centre of everything with a 2 minute walk to o'connel street. 
The hotel was very nice and clean there was only three of us and we had two double beds and a single. We were very pleased with how spacious it was and for what we paid. We did pay extra for breakfast but again that was great help yourself service.
Could do with being topped up more regular though. As soem of the food looked it had been under the heat lamps for a while.
Would recomend coming to this hotel staff are very helpful and polite",5,2015,11,02
231,"Excellent comfortable hotel, fantastic staff","Hotel well appointed and comfortable, in central Dublin (very convenient for sights) with fantastic staff. Rooms spacious and spotless, with added touches like iron and ironing board, large umbrella, hairdryer, extra pillows, complimentary soap and shampoo etc etc. Staff were brilliant, especially Anna and her team including lovely Liz in the restaurant - coped with courtesy and efficiency with dozens of guests pouring in at breakfast time - all seeming to choose that last 9am -10am hour at the same moment! Bar and reception staff equally welcoming and helpful. Hotel convenient for city centre, and has two supermarkets (next door and opposite) if you need extras you've forgotten such as toothpaste etc.  Slight downside were the hardish pillows - even the soft extra ones provided, but still slept well ...",5,2015,11,02
231,Great Weekend Stay,Chose this hotel for a central location and was not disappointed well within walking distance of all shops and temple bar area. Staff were brilliant and easy to get taxis if required. Would definitely recommend and use this hotel again. ,5,2015,11,01
231,Very pleasant,"Good location, in walking distance of major attractions in Dublin, very good breakfast. The room was clean and spacious. The only bad thing about this hotel is there is no parking onsite and you have to walk a couple of blocks and pay 10 Euro a day.",4,2015,10,31
231,Jury's Inn Parnell Street Dublin,"Hotel overall very good! As a family hotel needs more seating outside bar area as children must be out of the bar by 21:30. Voices and TV can clearly heard from next bedroom, not great at 02:00 hrs...
      
      
      ",4,2015,10,31
231,Dublin experience,"We arrived at the hotel at 12:00 and had to wait until after 2:00 to have our rooms. I had asked for rooms next to each other and for a cot for my grandson in my daughter's room. We were given rooms which weren't together and l had to ask for a cot, which they were going to put in our room! The rooms are quite basic and need updating and more staff are needed to get the rooms ready as many guests were waiting in reception.
We ate in the bar twice and in the restaurant and the food was very nice and good value. Breakfast was very busy as you had to serve yourself with everything. The quality and choices were good, but there weren't enough staff to clear the dirty plates.
The hotel in Parnell Street was very central and close to the tour buses.
      ",3,2015,10,30
231,Perfect City location,"Jury's Parnell St is in a great location just a few minutes walk from the city's shops.  Lovely pubs serving good food also close by.  The hotel is very clean  v quiet & comfortable. Free wifi is v slow.     
      
      
      ",5,2015,10,30
231,Jury's Inn - Parnell Street - quick and convenient,"Convenient location overall, though not an ideal hotel if you have a car, as the parking is a 10 minute walk and leaving luggage (and collecting it at check out) at the front is a bit of a hassle.  But other than that, it is very conveniently located and a comfortable walking distance from the centre of town, Temple Bar, Grafton Street, etc...  ",4,2015,10,30
231,Great stay,"Very friendly and helpful staff, set the scene for a great stay in Dublin. Very happy and looking to help. Room was great and breakfast offered a good selection of food and beverages. Central location meant that we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Secure place to leave baggage once checked out was very helpful in letting us explore further on the final day.",5,2015,10,30
231,Decent hotel; nice staff; close to shopping,"Hotel is close to O’Connell Street and the spire, although near a few areas that made me nervous.  Hotel rooms are adequate.  Breakfast was not included in my rate.  For 10 euro, I paid one day for an excellent full breakfast.  Staff were friendly.  Cleaning ladies were very respectful and kind.  A modest hotel.",3,2015,10,29
231,City Break,"Excellent value for money, and near to all attractions. The staff were friendly and the service was great, food was ok tho we didn't have dinner. The location is ok , near to all the bars and just a short walk to Temple bar.

Asked for room near lift. Got it. Was somewhat noisy. Beds good. Cleaning staff very thorough. Cosy bar with super friendly staff. Will definitely be back in the futuristische. ",5,2015,10,29
231,ok,"Ok hotel.  Nothing special here other than within walking distance of good stuff. I just wish they acted like they cared if I was there or not.  Slow check in.  Room was ok, but just ok.  They were very good at letting me keep my luggage there while I toured the city after checkout.  Just don't expect anything other than a small room and a truck stop breakfast.

      
      
      ",3,2015,10,28
231,Excellent hotel,I can't rate this hotel highly enough! The staff were extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The bedrooms were spotless. The hotel was busy but the service didn't slip. We arrived very early in the morning and were able to leave our bags until the room was ready. At the end of the stay we were again able to leave our bags until we left for the airport! The hotel was in a good location and within easy walking distance of the centre and bus stops.,5,2015,10,28
231,Kiwi's visiting our Irish family,"Location is superb, you can walk to just about everything. Staff are fantastic. Second stay for us and we will go back, room was smaller this time but bed is very compfy, pillows great everything you need. People are lovely and the breakfast is the best. Supermarket across the road for everything if you want to stay in. A short walk to O'connell street and 2 minutes further to Temple Bar. 2 minutes from there to the best shopping. Really good stay at Jury's, great value for money.",5,2015,10,28
231,Dublin Marathon overnight stay,"Overall we found this hotel to be very good. Rooms were clean and the hotel is very central for the city center. The staff were also very helpful and the breakfast set me up perfectly for the marathon !
The only downside was that as this is a city center hotel the view from our window wasn't great as we stayed at the back of the hotel. So if you would like to stay at this hotel you may want to request a room at the front of the hotel so that you may get a better view and therefore a better customer experience.",4,2015,10,28
231,Close to everything,Parking wasn't easy for our rental car and rather expensive. Walked to temple bar area in about ten minutes. Took longer to walk to our car. If you stay on Parnell to o'connell neighborhood is safe. Ms Sweeney at the front desk gave us excellent directions every time we asked. She deserves a bonus. The room was nice. They happily held our luggage for us on day of departure. Would return here ,4,2015,10,27

Stayed there for Dublin City marathon , we stayed the night before after check out the looked after our bags till the marathon , and also let us take showers before heading home. Great to see a hotel put guests before profit.",5,2015,10,27
231,Marathon visit ,"Just stayed at Jury's in Parnell street. The check in staff were excellent & so friendly & helpful. The room was clean & very comfortable to as always is in Jury's . Unfortunately when we went for dinner it took a while as the girl behind the bar was more interested in giving out to a young work colleague than doing her job & then after I interrupted to get served forgot some of the order. These things should be done behind closed doors and didn't look good. The food was good although slow coming but no complaints. The front office staff were excellent again when I finished the marathon & allowed me to shower in a room. Such a nice thing to do & was so grateful . We then decided to stay but although the hotel was not full obviously as we were using a room they would only offer us a room rate of 180e breakfast extra !  & was 129 the night before . We went somewhere else & just thought this was crazy business , they say in successful hotels , sell the room not the rate . They basically lost atleast 200e plus not using common sense. A huge loss over a year . Anyway overall was delighted with jury's and will definitely stay again & hope the staff arguments stay behind closed door.",3,2015,10,27

Don't bother with a bus from the airport, if there's 4 of you its just as cheap in a taxi, 24 - 28 euro,s

231,"Good location, efficient staff.",The hotel is v well located and the staff are v nice. But the rooms need to be modernized and bigger if you book a family one. Very small room and bathroom for a family of 4. But we were out most of the time so for a city break it was ok.,4,2015,10,26
231,"Not worth of room rate, but not the end of the world","Lack of friendliness and lack of consistent handling of guest requests. Will make you suffer with a bad Wi-Fi in the hope you sign for a premium and expensive Wi-Fi fee. Room service and bar prices also above what you get, but this is true in most hotels, so the other issues are the decision factors.

231,not the best location,"We stayed in Dublin at the Jury's Inn. the Staff were very good but they did not really tell us about anything around the Hotel so we just found out on our own. The Location was lower end, with a lot of riff raff during the day and at nite, we had a street foom and it was really noisy and annoying with all the questionable activity. Parking was dismal, cost us 20 euros a nite in a dingy hole in the wall next to the Hotel. The Hotel suggested another garage about 2 block away but the atmosphere was not to our liking. Rooms were standard not too impressed but were clean. Tons of Tour Companies use this Hotel and the buses were in front all day long. I would not recommend this Hotel to anyone, there are better Hotels in a much more deserible area..",3,2015,10,26
231,Lovely hotel excellent location,"We had a one night stay here. The hotel is clean and modern and the rooms are a great size. Check in was quick.My room key did not work initially when I came back down they were most apologetic. Very positive vibe from the manager. We did not drink at the bar or eat in the hotel, but the location is excellent and not far from Grafton st and all it's great bars and restaurants. Car parking is a five min Walk back to the hotel for an extra 10 euro, however this was unlimited and we stayed there until 5pm the evening of check out. Makes it worth while if wanting to go shopping or sight seeing. Will stay again ",5,2015,10,25
231,Wonderful!,"Jury's Inn are a chain I've used several times, and usually they are what you expect. This one was different, the staff were pleasant and everyone was there to help. Even the room cleaners were a delight and always greeted you with a smile and a hello as you walked through the corridors. The staff even took the time to surprise me with balloons and a card in my room as they had heard it was my birthday! Definitely recommend it to any tourists visiting Dublin, not to forget the location is perfect. Only around the corner from oconnell street where the main transport routes go through, Temple Bar and Granton Street for some shopping.",5,2015,10,24
231,Dublin's right-smack -n-the-city-center hotel,"Great location, just right at the corner of the main road, O'Connell St. where all the connections such as hop on hop offs and coastal tours buses are.

The hotel itself is clean, has good amenities and definitely friendly staff.

Glad we chose this hotel",5,2015,10,23
231,A most enjoyable stay in a 1st Class hotel.,"My only single concern was the security system into our room which was 404.
I totally applaud and understand the reason for security which was excellent. But, I had some difficulty gaining access into our room on several occassions and I had to return to reception to seek help and advice. I don't know if it was my own stupidity using the electronic swipe card or a fault in that particular room security. Perhaps, if the Reception staff gave more advice on using the card when booking in initially. We weren't informed that keeping the Jury's Swipe Card next to other cards, may affect its use by it being de-magnetized. Is this true ? If so, perhaps again this should be pointed out. One other minor complaint was that I'd booked a room initially for a two night stay with breakfasts, but decided to stay a third night. The replacement of toilet rolls didn't happen nor change of bath towels. But all in all, I'd still give Jury's Hotel in Parnell Street a 9.75 out of ten. Thank you, and we plan to stay at Jury's on our next visit up to Dublin. The choice of breakfast was fantastic and unrestricted.

231,Average stay,"Located slightly out of town in probably not the best area for some but still only a short walk into the city centre. There are a couple of multi story car parks close by, one of which Jury's will subsidise the price on. I was given a disabled room which made it quite spacious however the bathroom wasn't the best. If you took a shower, this automatically soaked most of the bathroom floor. Bar/reception staff were great.",3,2015,10,21
231,Excellent stay once again!,"2nd time staying in jurys inn Parnell street and did not disappoint. We arrived to the hotel earlier than the check in time and there was a room ready was brilliant, dropped our bags into our room and around the corner from hotel main shopping street in Dublin so close. There was a lovely man can't remember his name that was in reception area twice we met him and he just took his time out to have a conversation with us. Breakfast following morning was lovely very well organised. Upon checkout then we got out of the lift and the place was manic was a group of 50 men all checking in we thought we would be forever checking out but we were brought straight up and able to check out, and got car ticket stamped for car park €10 for 24 hours parking in the city centre brilliant overall once again a brilliant stay. 

Only thing would have to complain about is the lights in the room not very bright.",5,2015,10,21

231,My review,"I was given a family room with bathroom for disabled person. This is what I did not expect.

231,good stay,"We liked it here. Just out of the center of the city but easy walking to sites to see. Hotel clean, good breakfast. Coffee was weak but thank goodness we found Gilbert! Great expresso. ( the sign said ask if you need something. :) ) ",4,2015,10,18
231,"Clean, Simple, Convenient Location and Helpful Staff.","Stayed here on first night of a last minute trip to Dublin where we arrived without a hotel reservation and kind of clueless as to what part of the city we should stay in. This hotel offered a good last minute rate and seemed centrally located enough so we booked it while waiting in line at the car rental place... Unfortunately this hotel doesn't have parking (we later realized this is the norm for many hotels in the city though!) but they get a discounted rate from the Car Park about 5 min. walk away. It was 10 euros for 24/hr. - very reasonable for city parking!
The hotel is across the street from a Tesco (I thought this was a bonus having just arrived from a long overnight flight and in need of forgotten toiletries, and drinks/snacks), it’s otherwise unremarkable from the outside but upon entering, we found a modern, spacious and welcoming lobby. Desk staff was friendly, efficient and helpful with questions about the area. I thought the room was a good size. The bed was sort of small but it was comfortable and there was an additional seating area with sofa and chair by the window.  Décor was minimal, clean and modern. I was happy with the room. Our rate included a breakfast buffet for 2 that offered a selection of hot and cold items... All pretty good. I wouldn’t go there *for* the breakfast but having it included was nice and we enjoyed it. The restaurant also had a decent ambiance as far as hotel breakfast areas go.  Overall we were pleasantly surprised with our last minute pick! It’s near O’Connell Street and was less than 15 minute walk down to the river and some of the bars/restaurants we were interested in trying.",4,2015,10,18
231,Great value for money,"I stayed at the Jurys Inn for 3 nights with 3 friends (in 2 rooms), booked through British Airways. It was a flights plus accommodation package and fantastic value. The hotel itself is quite swish, the rooms had one double and one single and ours was really spacious. It was a disabled room and the bathroom floor was pretty scratched and the shower water tended to seep where it shouldn't. That was the only downside. Great breakfast, excellent service. Parnell Street is not the most salubrious part of town but very close to the centre. Would definitely go there again.",4,2015,10,18
231,Brilliant stay thank you,Arriving early we asked if we could leave our bags in left luggage for reception to go above and beyond and allow us to check in and go.out to enjoy the city. Breakfast was great with a huge choice and good quality. Will definitely be back ,4,2015,10,18
231,If arriving late.. Do not book this hotel!  They overbook the rooms.,"This hotel is lucky to be getting 2 stars from me after the experience we had during a 1am check in at this hotel.  We booked a three night stay for a short break to Dublin, but only had our room for two of those nights.

Check in:
First off, we informed the hotel we would be arriving late (between midnight and 2am to allow for delays) when we booked through Expedia (three weeks in advance) to ensure we had no problems like the ones we experienced.  After a delayed flight, we arrived at 1am (not outside what we had informed them) to be told due to ""a problem with Expedia's booking system"" we did not have a room for the night and they would find us ""alternative"" accommodation.  However, the Jurys Inn, despite all the problems with the system, had all of my booking details including my length of stay, payment details etc., so I will allow you to draw your own conclusion on whether this was genuinely the reason for the overbooking.....   We were told to check back at 2pm the next day to check in (to which I told them, as I am currently paying for a room they couldn't provide, I would be returning at 10am to a ready room - which was accommodated).

""Alternative"" accommodation:
Our emergency accommodation really was emergency and was approximately 2 miles from the hotel.  We had a tiny room (the double bed was against the window!!), leak through the ceiling and no working hair dryer.  The hotel did accompany us to the property and ensured it was paid up.  The state of the room was not the fault of the hotel providing the accommodation - I'm sure they only use this room on emergency.  We were simply grateful to have any bed at all.

Second/Third Night & Room quality:
We arrived back at the hotel by taxi (paid for by Jurys Inn) and checked in at 10am as I requested.  We noticed we had been upgraded to a superior room, but that is only bottled water, newspaper and biscuits in addition to the regular facilities provided.  The beds were average, and the room was clean and pleasant as expected for a budget hotel.  Bottled water, newspaper and biscuits do not constitute compensation for being transferred in the middle of the night to an emergency room.

Location:  
Great location!  Very near to the main road where all the buses leave from (including airport) so all attractions are easily accessible.

We cannot comment on any other services (e.g. breakfast) as we did not use them, reluctant to pay any further fees to this hotel.

All in all, it's a budget hotel, but fairly comfortable.  However, if you are arriving late, don't expect to have the room you booked or any reasonable compensation or sympathy from the staff.",2,2015,10,18
231,Absolutely shocking,It started with finding out there was no parking & we had to park over 2 blocks away. The waitress smashed a glass on the table covering us in shards of glass. We waited over an hour for our meals. Our room overlooked a recycling yard. Never again,1,2015,10,17

231,"Staff wonderful, Hotel itself found lacking","Lovely friendly people. The Hotel itself is quite lacking in atmosphere. It's functional, central and that's essentially it. Somewhat sad to report really. I should say I know Dublin extremely well and have stayed in every top and reasonable class location over decades, but this is not one, after so many years when the whole City could really have been renewed, refreshed and given some really good 'pizazz'. So much money has poured into Dublin over the years, surely it can't all have gone into greedy people's pockets, but the facts suggest it hasn't gone into the infrastructure.",3,2015,10,16

Staff took the time to chat if you told them what your plans were they would ask (when they saw you again) how you meal, show etc went.  The hotel's location was great. Plenty shops, restaurants and bars close by. Temple Bar 10/15 min walk. Nice walk down O'connell St. Food ... enjoyed fish n chips across from hotel.

231,Feedback Jurys Inn,This was a great hotel in a most convenient location. Around the corner from O'Connell St and within walking distance of the city. Service was very good and the rooms were spacious and comfortable. Parnells Pub (2 mins away) was also brilliant for food and atmosphere.,4,2015,10,12
231,"Clean, convenient, great base for a Dublin trip","The hotel is just a few steps from O'Connell Street, has bucket loads of shopping possibilities and great eateries nearby, and is very close to bus stops that serve all areas of the city. It's at the top end of O'Connell street so some might prefer to be closer to the pubs and nightlife of Temple Bar or to Grafton Street but Dublin is a relatively small city and you're only 10-15 minutes walk from all of that.
Our room was very spacious, clean and comfortable. A choice of pillows (fluffy/firm) was available, there was plenty of room to put luggage without tripping over it all the time, and the room was equipped with a hairdryer, iron and ironing board. The bathroom was also roomy and nice and bright with large mirrors, but the bath tub was a bit grimy up round the taps (hidden by the shower curtain when it was closed).
Staff were all super friendly and accommodating. 
Breakfast was standard fare and could be improved upon. The cooked breakfast was luke-warm; the bacon was like shoe leather. The only nod to the delicious tradition of Irish breads was a bit of very dry wheaten.  The cheese was limited to a few sweaty triangles of something tasteless and orange and the alternative to the cheese was a plate of similarly damp triangles of ham. Both breakfast items and cutlery were slow to be replenished when they ran out and there was no one on hand to clear away used plates from the tables. In other words, the buffet is ok if it's included but you're better off having breakfast in one of the hundreds of cafes and restaurants round about if it's not part of your package.
The only real complaint is the obvious lack of soundproofing in the rooms. The walls seem to be paper thin and we could follow the conversation of the guests in the room next door when they came in at 2am.
Take ear plugs with you if you're a light sleeper. Otherwise the hotel makes a great base for discovering Dublin.",4,2015,10,11

231,"Thin walls, awful coffee at breakfast.","Very thin walls, so you could hear conversation and noises from room next door, which woke me up early.
Awful coffee at breakfast. These days it's not that difficult to serve good coffee. I couldn't even manage to drink one cup, so I had to get a coffee from a nearby café. Cooked breakfast looked unappetizing so I decided not to try it. Fruit salad was tasteless. Orange juice and apple juice was also tasteless. I think it had been watered down. Lighting was poor in the restaurant so it was dark and dingy in places. On my second morning I wasn't looking forward to coming down for breakfast which isn't the best way to start the day.
Standard wi-fi was very slow and I couldn't even browse the internet properly, so It wasn't fit for purpose.

When we arrived in our room they had put balloons and a birthday card in there for him too. 

Great selection at breakfast, cooked breakfast went cold fast but tasted good. All self service including tea and toast which I mush prefer rather than waiting on other people. We loved our visit to Dublin it’s a wonderful place and would definitely go back to this hotel!! ",5,2015,10,08
231,Excellent Accomodation,We stayed for two nights prior to an early departure from Dublin Airport. The hotel is located within walking distance to Trinity College and other areas of interest. The staff was very friendly and helpful and our room was clean and comfortable. The price was competitive for Dublin.,4,2015,10,07
231,Wonderful Location,"We spent 7 nights at Jury`s Parnell and had a terrific time. The hotel is a business hotel,excellent staff, very clean rooms, more than adequate breakfast and a fantastic location.The only negative report  from my point of view was the view from our window which showed some disposal of trash.You can walk to a lot of points of interest from Parnell St and have the choice of many restaurants in the area.

231,Moved rooms,"Had to move rooms at 4am due to the air conditioning not working properly and making a high pitch noise, but once in the new room slept fine. The manager on duty when checking out gave us complimentary lunch to make up for the inconvenience

231,Couldnt have asked for better,"we stayed here for one evening. we got parked in a car park just of the street at the side of jury's inn, it cost 18 euros for 24 hours.  When we arrived at the hotel we discovered in the lift that the hotels runs with a car park that only charges 10 euros for your over night stay so worth giving them a ring to find out where that is first.  our room was lovely very central for everything we wanted to do with o'Connell street just round the corner. the bar at the corner just going onto O'Connell street is brilliant crack and the staff were so lovely not too expensive either.  i would strongly recommend this hotel for all the touristy type things. couldn't have asked for better.  the breakfast was beautiful and with so much to offer we definitely didn't leave for the journey home hungry, we also ate diner in the hotel and i have to say it was beautiful as well. will definitely be back.

231,"booked at very short notice, did the job","Booked a family room after missing the ferry which was not my fault if my wife reads this. Check in was great, parking close by though unpacking out the front of the hotel was a pain. Very busy with coaches and taxis. Family room was cramped but fine. Usually I'd only give this 3 stars but given the short notice, the GAA semi final in Dublin and the chippy over the road that does set Menu's called 'The Sinead O Connor' and'Phil Lynot' it gets 4 stars. Nice big bar, 10 minutes from Temple Bar, close to the Theatre and a big old Tesco (or similar) over the road if you want to buy biscuits. Or other stuff.",4,2015,10,05
231,Very nice hotel!,"Very nice hotel! Was well located and could not really ask more from their staff. Always eager to help!

The breakfast was good value and quite good variety of options.

The room was decent size and well equipped.",4,2015,10,04
231,A good spot in Dublin!,"This is a grand hotel to stay in in Dublin.  It's in a good location, has friendly staff and nice rooms.  Big comfy beds, extra pillows, good free wifi, and it had clean rooms!
Only a few minor things stopped it from getting a 5 rating - we couldn't open the windows (there was air con, but it's not the same), the beds moved about so you couldn't rest back on them without them moving away from the walls, and they could have done with a few more staff at breakfast.  The breakfast staff were really good, but run off their feet so things weren't replenished enough (basic things like milk, not anything which needed to be cooked).  
Another thing was that the residents bar was only open until 1.30, which was a surprise in the land of Guinness :)
Overall though a nice hotel and we'd definitely stay there again!",4,2015,10,03
231,Jury's inn Dublin. Well worth staying in.,"This hotel was a pleasure to stay in, nothing was to much trouble for any staff members. The rooms were a nice size, beautifully clean, you were not able to hear the traffic that was quiet busy during the day outside the front door. We were there for breakfast for three days, the food was beautifully cooked and there was a good spread, it covered all diets. It is just round the corner from o Connell street, which was great for transport needs. 
The only down side to me was there was no room safe, but there was a block of safes in the reception area, which were different sizes for people who needed larger safes. Which we there for use but it was not as convenient to keep going down to reception when I needed to get something out of it. I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Dublin.

231,Lovely staff and restaurants,"This is a lovely clean hotel in a good location that has lovely staff. Food is nice, staff are attentive and nothing is too much trouble. Unfortunately although we were put in a quiet room as requested we were woken up each night on our stay (3 nights) by slamming doors that made the walls shake. The first night we put down to it being a Saturday and hoped sunday and Monday would be better. They weren't. We put the do not disturb sign on our door but it made no difference. I'm not sure dis courteous guests or cleaners read them. We complained and the operations manager came to see us. Lovely chap but not a lot he could do. I feel it's not the hotels fault, just the selfishness of people nowadays.",4,2015,09,29

The hotel is well located, walking distance from shopping in Henry and Grafton street as well as the Temple bar area. I've stayed in 5 star hotels in Dublin before and I felt they where overpriced.

I felt it lacked some identify although that's hard to pinpoint exactly so a personal view. Large hotel, good breakfast choices and comfortable rooms. Due to the size the walk to your room could be substantial although access is good throughout. If you are staying Friday, Saturday ask for a room away from the bar which can be very loud in the wee hours. Good location for Dublin attractions.",3,2015,09,27

We were advised that a room was available and we could check in straight away :-).  The room was clean,  comfortable and there was free WiFi. My only gripe was the noise was made by other guests coming back in the early hours, noisy and slamming doors.

The breakfast was good,  plenty to choose from.  Bacon, eggs, toast, fruit, cereal etc..Gluten free toast was available upon request and took 5 minutes to arrive at our table.

The staff were always polite and helpful.

231,Ideal base station,We had a group of 10 and arrived pretty early. The hotel were very accommodating and took our bags so we could explore. With a large tesco over the road and the main shopping street one Street away the only draw back was it was further away from the river than we would have liked (high heel wearers) if you have comfy shoes it's ideal to explore the amazing city from. Rooms were clean and sufficient. Food in the restraunt  was good and reasonably priced same with the bar snacks. What more do u need from a hotel!!,4,2015,09,25

Location was particularly great in our opinion, not to close (so that you're kept awake all night) and not too far away (so I could still walk home wearing my heels!) Breakfast was well worth paying the additional amount for - it set us up for the day and had lots of healthy choices. All staff members were fantastic and very helpful.

Every question was answered, information easily avaliable, rooms attractive and clean, food excellent. What more can I say? Oh yes, latest checkout at 12;00, but you can leave your Luggage with them in safety till whenever and the Taxi I booked through the Reception was super prompt and a fixed price to Airport.
We did the same in 2013, start and finish in Dublin with 2 Hotels, and of the 4 hotels total in Dublin Jurys Inn is the winner!!",5,2015,09,21

It is a 5 minute walk from the Temple Bar area and Grafton St.  The staff were absolutely outstanding with their advice of where to park- and where NOT to park- while staying at this facility.  They had good recommendations and good advice that we used to our advantage.",3,2015,09,18
231,"Nice, clean and well-located hotel","We booked the Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street for a four-day city trip, and found it to be very satisfactory. The hotel's location is ideal for exploring the city, with plenty of shops, restaurants, pubs and public transport nearby. 

The hotel itself was clean and well-maintained. Our fourth-floor room was nice and tidy, with a good mattress, good pillows, a decent-sized desk with a swivel chair so comfortable I wanted to sneak it into our luggage to take home. The bathroom was small but very functional, with excellent water pressure in the shower. 

The breakfast buffet was fine, with a nice variety of cooked and 'continental' options. The breakfast room doubles as a restaurant in the evening, which we tried one night, much to our satisfaction (the ribeye steak was perfectly grilled, as were the lamb chops).  

From check-in to check-out, all the staff we encountered were very welcoming and pleasant. 

All in all a very positive experience. ",4,2015,09,18

231,Great place to stay,"Just returned from a long weekend in Dublin staying at this Hotel. My husband and I were both pleasantly surprised. Upon checking in we were told we had booked a superior room and were given some discount vouchers, and free coffee coupons to use in the hotel restaurant and bar which came in very handy, as we were told that Dublin could be a very expensive to eat and drink. 
The hotel itself is centrally located, and only a 15 minute walk into Temple Bar, and even less to the main shopping area. It's also handy for the Hop on Hop off bus tours, which start their journey at the top of the street opposite the hotel. ",4,2015,09,15
231,Very Central and Comfortable Hotel,"We stayed for 2 nights about a week apart at this very central and modern hotel. The first room was looking out on Parnell Street and was very bright and comfortable. The second room was at the back of the hotel and overlooked a waste transfer station. This room had an extra window installed to block out the noise but unfortunately you could not open the window. Try to avoid these rooms.
Breakfasts (included with our package) were excellent with lots of variety and freshly cooked.
Staff was accommodating and efficient. The hotel was a short walk away from central Dublin with lots of restaurants close. We found the restaurant in the hotel to be expensive.
Overall I would highly recommend this hotel as long as you do not get a room overlooking the transfer station.",4,2015,09,15
231,Excellent Hotel and Location. ,Stayed for three night's from 7th September. Lovely location for attractions and nightlife. Few minutes walk from the Air coach drop off pick up points.  Rooms were spacious and clean comfortable bed. Breakfast was 9 Euro if you paid in advance. Plenty of selection which represents great value for the price. If there is a downside we were at the rear of the hotel. There is a depot that road sweeper machines work out of and they work nights so can be noisy at times. Plus it attracts sea gulls at day break which is also noisy. But overall I would strongly recommend this hotel. ,4,2015,09,15

231,Great Location,"i Use Jurys a lot when i am on business and booked this hotel because the standards are pretty high in the hotels in the UK. I wasn't disappointed the location is pretty good at the top of the main street in Dublin, near enough to the nightlife but far enough away not to be noisy. The hotel is fairly modern and well kept and the room though not massive was big enough to accommodate four. We had breakfast in the hotel which is buffet style and kids eat free so we all had a good breakfast for 20 euro. As with all Jurys inns the thing that makes them stand above the competition is the staff they always make you feel welcome and cant do enough for you.",5,2015,09,15
231,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed twice, before our organised tour and after.  Very clean and crisp. All the staff were helpful and professional.  Nothing was too much trouble.  Rooms were of a good size and had everything you'd need.  Very close to the main street/shopping precincts and central enough to walk to many of the attractions Dublin has to offer.

231,In need of some improvements,"Checking in was fast, no hassle. Checking out was just as fast, great.

Location is alright. I felt it was on the edge of everything central. We found most places of interest to be within walking distance - i.e. 10-15 minutes.

Our room faced away from the street and therefore very quite. The beds were comfortable enough but not extraordinaly so. The shower was good.

I was travelling with two friends and therefore booked a triple room. I believed there would be three single beds, there was in fact a queen (or king) size bed and a single. It might have been my mistake but I am pretty sure it wasn't.

The elevator are slow and altough there are three of them, I felt we always have to wait for them too long.

The breakfast was a bit boring. This is the part that easily can improve. Jurys Inn, one kind of sliced cheese is just not good enough. You can easily add more variations on cereal. Why not add a flair and have someone make your pancakes? 

There is a slow wifi, you can get better speed if you pay for it, rather unnecessary to charge for wifi nowadays.

Overall it was OK for a weekend but I wouldn't be happy during a longer stay.",3,2015,09,13

231,"Excellent Location, Accommodation, and Staff","Jury's Inn was a superb experience that had an excellent staff, excellent location, and excellent food. It was modern and affords you precisely what you need- whether you are a tourist or businessmen. ",5,2015,09,11
231,Central Dublin accomodation,"We chose the Jurys Inn hotel because of its proximity to the city centre and location for the city bus tour.

On arrival we found it very difficult to get our suitcases from the hired car to the hotel because there is no drop off area. The area outside is occupied by either tourist buses or taxis. There is apparently an arrangement with a nearby parking area (Cathedral Lane) for 10 Euros/day, however this did not eventuate when discussing with the operator of the car park. It did cost 16.50 Euros for car left after 5 and picked up before 12 the next day which I found quite reasonable.

The reception of Jurys Inn were very helpful and checked in very smartly. 

The rooms were fabulous. Very clean, roomy and despite being close to heavy traffic it must have been double glazed since we could not hear any traffic. It had a television, was air conditioned and had free WIFI. The location was superb and close to the main shopping mall, restaurants and the Dublin hop on hop off bus tours. There is a small Gymnasium, and the dining area was very comfortable.

The rooms were reasonably priced for three people at 238 Euros when compared to similar around the world. The beds did seem to be cheap however, and we could feel the springs. This did not in any way prevent a very comfortable sleep. The bathroom was well appointed roomy and very clean. See photos. There was free WIFI available.

Breakfast was supplied as a buffet in the comfortable dining room. Whilst the food was great, there was some chaos in maintaining the supply. We had to ask for bread to toast , orange juice and glasses since these had all run out and no seemed to have a handle on management of the area.

All the same we would definitely stay there if in Dublin again",5,2015,09,11
231,good location,"Booked for long weekend with friends, 3 nights in total. Pleasant welcome by reception staff, all very friendly and helpful. Room spotless, couldn't fault it. Breakfast was plentiful, self service, plenty to choose from apart from Monday morning on our departure. Local to O'Donnell street and about 20min walk to temple bar area. Only complaint was our room wasn't cleaned on Sunday, maid knocked on our door at 5.50pm when we was getting ready to go out to ask if we wanted our room done, which was a bit too late so we did it ourselves. Would definitely recommend. Tips include Murrys bar great food and atmosphere, green sightseeing bus tour.",4,2015,09,11
231,Brilliant hotel close to Temple Bar,I visited this hotel with my partner in November last year and would definitely rebook if I visited Dublin again! The hotel was very very clean and the staff were really friendly! The location of the hotel is great as it is within walking distance to Temple Bar however far enough away that you're not in the thick of the hustle & bustle.,5,2015,09,10
231,Jury's inn Parnell street dublin,"What a great hotel room really nice included free wifi. Room cleaned everyday. 
Staff very helpful and very polite. We paid for breakfast and 2 course evening meal. Breakfast was lovely and the 2 course meal was excellent very large portions. Would stay here again ",5,2015,09,10
231,Lovely clean hotel,"I was in Dublin near Christmas. We needed to book a room last minute due to weather been so bad we couldn't drive home. We booked this hotel. They were very accommodating. The staff were amazing. Polite.

Our room was small but it was clean and we had fresh towels. 
The only fault I found was the noise after you flush the toilet it seem to go on for ever. Also their is no parking. It was frustrating as all car parks were closed so I had to get up at 6am to pay for on street parking. Every 2hours it was costly. So prepare for that. 

It is very central. When you come out there's a centra outside and a Tesco across the road if u needed last minute items which we did. It wasn't planned to stay. 

The food was delicious . Breakfast was gorgeous. All food was fresh . Other than that it was clean. Staff were help I would stay here again. ",4,2015,09,09
231,Great hotel within walking distance of Temple Bar!,"We stayed at the Jury's Inn for 2 nights In July 2015 for our 17th anniversary.   We were just using it as a base really as we wanted to eat out and wander round the city for a couple of days.  The staff were very friendly, the hotel was well presented and the rooms were clean an tidy, all we wanted really!  The location of the hotel is great.  Only a 5 minute walk to the shops and less than 10 minutes to Temple Bar.  There is a Tesco Express, Aldi and a Primark over the road/round the corner!  We would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2015,09,09
231,Good quality,The room we stayed in was nice. No fridge. Tv with a few channels. The beds are good / ok to sleep on but i've slept on better. The door of our room somehow slammed shut if we didn't very carefully watch it. We stayed for a week and were satisfied. Location to get into Dublin is good. A spar supermarket nearby offers the possibility to do some groceries. ,3,2015,09,08
231,Lovely stay,"Stayed for weekend with my husband. Hotel in very good location, rooms comfortable and everywhere very clean. All staff very friendly. Reasonable prices in the bar. My only negative would be that due to a huge football game happening in Dublin whilst we were there, the restaurant staff couldn't cope with the rush. Queues to get in followed by lack of crockery and then waiting for food on the buffet. Would still recommend though ",5,2015,09,08
231,Good straightforward no frills hotel,"Stayed here last Saturday night after the match in Croke park.
A bit pricey but so was everywhere else!
Parking was discounted to €10 overnight at Cleary's Q park-5 minutes away.
Breakfast was adequate, kitchen had a job keeping up with demand...
Rooms were clean and functional, no safe though...
This was a pleasant stay, nothing fancy, it is a Jurys inn after all, so if you are looking for that special night way then you may want to try elsewhere.
Would stay here again for its location...",4,2015,09,08
231,"Awesome hotel, awesome staff","I stay here often, Eva helped out no end when I checked in again, great room and awesome directions, saved my life. Sarah helped out brilliantly too tonight, needed a print out and it was done. Thank you, saved my life again! Love staying here, all the staff are awesome!",5,2015,09,07
231,Excellent,"Have to say all was excellent at Jury's and will definately stay there again and also will recommend it to all my friends and family. Staff were brilliant and sorted us out. They were friendly and polite.

231,Great Location,"This hotel was in a great location just off O'Connor Street.

The hotel was clean and the bed very comfortable.

There is bar on the second level which is open from about 10am to 1am. Nachos are great :-)

Great staff and service. Reception very welcoming and everything was explained to us about the stay.

The gym could be bigger.",5,2015,09,07
231,Ideal city center location,We stayed here when we went to watch the rugby. Great city center location. Hotel was clean and food was good. If its simply a base to explore the city then this does the trick.The family room could have been a bit bigger but all in all it did the trick.,4,2015,09,07
231,Great location and good room,"I have a friend visiting from Canada and she picked this for us to stay a couple of nights. Location is great, car parking is 5 min walk and is €10 per 24 hours if the hotel validates your ticket.  Staff seem friendly though I didn't have much cause to be in contact with them myself.  The room was clean and had what we needed but walls were thin and we had a noisy neighbour. Beds were comfy. We didn't try the restaurant or bar on site.  ",4,2015,09,06
231,Special birthday,Spent two nights in this hotel.it was modern clean with helpful staff.the breakfast was of a basic standard They could have done with more staff at breakfast.it was on a bus route but there was also taxis outside.,5,2015,09,06
231,good city location,"Had a fantastic stay.  Check in was easy and staff very friendly.  Room was large, clean and comfy.  The beds we comfortable and there was free wifi and coffee and tea in the room.  Parking was available at a discount of €9 per night.  Walking to all the attractions in the Temple bar was only 10 minutes.  We walked to Guinness and Kilmainham gaol in about 40 minutes but we love to walk everywhere so we can eat whatever we want along the way guilt free.",4,2015,09,05
231,Dublin city centre hotel,"The hotel was in a good location, just off O'Connell Street. All the staff were very helpful in all respects. Food was good. It was not too noisy for a city centre hotel, if you remember to turn the air conditioning off at night.
      ",4,2015,09,03
231,Wonderful,"The hotel was excellently located and the facilities are all in good condition, very good value for money, will definitely return for holiday in same hotel. The check in and out was excellent, no time wasting and location is superb for both transport and sight seeing.
      
      ",4,2015,09,03
231,one night get away,"Me my husband and my parents stayed here last week for 1 night. The hotel itself is in a very handy location, just round the corner from O'connell street where you can get the hop-on hop-off buses to take you round Dublin. Our room was very comfortable the only downside (apart from the food) for us was that the view from our room looked straight across the road to a Tesco Express which for us was not good as we both work for Tesco and were on holiday for a week so that was the last thing we wanted to be looking at!!! LOL.
We didnt have a great exsperiance in the restaurant. Firstly we had to ask if our meals would be long as we were going on the Dublin By Night bus tour. It took about 45 mins for the meals to arrive and it certainly wasnt worth the wait! And So not worth the 15.95 euro each. The food on the menu sounded posh but it was really below average ( i serve up better food at home! ) we ended up getting 10% off the bill and a free drink each when we got back from our trip which was fair enough.
What was handy was there is a luggage room so we were able to leave our bags there while went round Dublin before getting the coach back home.
We would stay there again as its in a good location and only about 10-15mins walk from the main bus/train station but we would definately eat elsewhere",3,2015,09,03
231,Great location at affordable price.,"Booked 2 Superior Double Rooms for our 2 day stay in Dublin. Handy location to the main shopping strips, city centre and hop on/hop off buses. Hard to find a quality but affordable hotel in downtown Dublin but this was one of them. Nothing extraordinary but no complaints either. Breakfast and bar facilities were good.  If you get a chance across the road there is the Kingfisher Restaurant which serves great breakfasts.",4,2015,09,03
231,Good location but price does not reflect the Standard,"Hotel was in a great location - everything within walking distance 
Staff was very friendly and helpful
Food was good in bar and breakfast  was ok 
The let down of the visit was the standard of the room for a cost of over €250 per night (stayed for 4 nights) -  was expecting 4 star standards - room was between 2 to 3 star standard - stayed in other hotels in Dublin in the last 12 months that was 25% cheaper but had a higher standard of room",3,2015,09,03
231,Worst Jurys Inn I have stayed at!,"They didn't have a room when we arrived as they had sold out (arrived around 11pm) even though we had booked it 3 months earlier. We were offered a transfer to another hotel. However 20mins later found us a room in the hotel. Went to to the room to find that that it smelt of smoke! 
Breakfast was awful. Barely warm, badly stocked buffet, no allergen signs, cheap sausages, cardboard bacon and powdered orange juice. Watched as a staff used the tongues to decant black pudding and sausages then use the same on the potatoes. Feel sorry for any vegetarians here. Wished we had taken the option to leave!
Was offered complimentary evening meal, which we didn't take, but they did leave bottle of wine left in the room as an apology.",2,2015,09,03
231,Review of Jurys Inn,"Excellent location, service and accommodation.  I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone.  Although in the city centre it was very quite & also happy that there was air conditioning in the room.

231,Excellent Hotel,"Location, service, hospitality and food were excellent. Definitely will be back again. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Hotel. The staff were most helpful and courteous. The rooms were lovely, clean and very comfortable.

231,Holiday,"Great location. Close to Museums; Francis Bacon studio is a must. At Trinity Collegue, I enjoyed everything, but the library is just the most amazing place; Restaurants and shops.

      ",4,2015,09,02
231,Great stay,"Staff were extremely friendly! Bedrooms were large enough and very clean. Breakfast was good, but at times quite busy. The hotel is located close to the bus stop of the airport bus on O'Connell Street. There's a large shopping street just around the corner. Areas on the south side of the river, like Temple Bar, were only a 5-minute walk. We were happy we could leave our luggage at the hotel after we had checked out. I would definitely recommend this hotel!
      ",5,2015,09,02
231,short stay,"great location on the end of o connell st,  good pubs nearby , always a taxi waiting outside very very friendly staff  , arrived mid day saturday  and our room was ready , check in was very swift , bags into room then out in the city within minutes .",5,2015,09,02
231,Excellent location,"The hotel is in an excellent location. It's very clean, staff very efficient and friendly. The bar on the corner offers lovely food at a reasonable price. The red bus hop on hop off tour is an ideal way to see the city. ",4,2015,09,01
231,Bad experience in jury's,"There was a mistake with rooms which then meant it took ages to check in. When we got back to the hotel later that night the porter couldn't find our name on the room list. He was extremely rude to the third guest in our room, he refused to believe that the third person in the room was male, then he proceeded to ring the room and woke up the two sleeping guests to question them. The issue was finally resolved but it took about half an hour. Disgraceful. 
      
      
      
      ",1,2015,09,01
231,The best service,"We just got back from Dublin and had the best time ever. It helped that we had reservations at the Jutys Inn Parnell. The location was ideal and the hotel itself was amazing. From the front desk, the concierge (Przemu), the food and beverage manager (Anna), the bar and restaurant staff, the cleaning staff, well it was the best! We were made to feel at home and we're always greeted with smiles and suggestions on sights to see and great places to eat. Just a short walk gets you to Henry Street (great shopping area), Temple Bar (tourist area filled with great shops, pubs,restaurants, fabulous buskers and the Ha'penny Bridge. And it's close to tourist shops for booking tours. We loved it!",5,2015,09,01
231,anniversary trip,"once we found this hotel it was great place to stay just around the corner from the main street of business and stores and bus stops, it was nice and clean and the beds were comfortable we only stayed one night but well worth the stay and the price was really good not to expensive, we booked in early our room wasn't ready but they locked up our luggage for us which was a great peace of mind.  Dublin Is a great place to see and take a tour on the double decker bus, it stops at all the main attractions and there is someone on the bus explaining about all the great sites, the needle that is in the middle of Dublin is just an amazing site to see, great shopping too",5,2015,09,01
231,Breakfast still cold and served up without much care,"I reviewed this hotel in April and finished by stating I wouldn't stay again unless stuck. Well, in June I was just that! Also, my boss was in Ireland too so it was with some trepidation that I booked this hotel again. All the comments from my previous review still hold true. Breakfast is served without much care - a full on buffet affair with lots of bowls and trays empty as the kitchen could not keep up - yet still manage to serve it cold. It's always a disappointment when things just seem to stay the same - it shows Dublin is on the up again and hotels are not struggling to find guests.",2,2015,09,01
231,Nice hotel spoilt by breakfast experience,"The hotel is in a great location for Temple Bar and day trips. It was within easy walking distance of lots of bars, restaurants and shops. We liked the modern decor of the hotel. The room was very clean and was a good size. We were a bit disappointed with the lack of Irish charm throughout the hotel, it would have been nice to of been greeted by a friendly Irish receptionist, having said that though all the receptionists we came across were very attentive.
Unfortunately, there was confusion with our booking as to whether breakfast was included or not. On arrival at breakfast on our first morning we were informed it wasn't included even though we had an email confiriming it was, and had shown this to Liz who was in charge of seating people at breakfast on this morning. She continued to display poor customer service throughout the resolution of this issue, and continued to make out that we were in the wrong even though we had produced confirmation. This included her interrupting our breakfast experience to inform us we needed to pay and was quite abrupt with her comments which were in front of other guests which we found quite embarrassing. 
Following breakfast we spoke again with Liz and even on seeing the email confirmation she still wasn't prepared to accept the fact that breakfast was included in our booking and wondered off to her line manager where we were then told, again quite abruptly, to go to reception. At reception the issue was resolved quickly. We wanted to express our disappointment with the way we had been treated by Liz but she was the only one without a name badge so we ended up describing her appearance to the receptionist! 
Shame that such a trivial matter could not be resolved efficiently and quickly like it should have been and that we have felt the need to make these comments on here. Apart from that the stay was a pleasant one and we had great fun in Dublin. We hope to visit again.",4,2015,09,01
231,Bad smell,"Hotel in a very good location, staff very friendly, good breakfast but very slow to clear tables when busy. Room had a bad smell all the time and had to ventilate which created a noise problem. Second time I have stayed in a jury's inn and both times not impressed",3,2015,09,01

231,Just OK,"Good location on the North side of the river. Decent breakfast for the price. The exercise room is terrible. Small with minimal equipment. Elliptical machine is broken, missing straps a on the bike pedals, no bench, mat, or weight machine. Room is clean and staff friendly. Wash cloths would be nice. Fairly bare bones but the price was good from Booking.com.",3,2015,08,31
231,Covenient location - recommended for first time visitors to Dublin,"Convenient location but then if you book a hotel in Dublin city centre, most places are within walking distance.  This particular hotel has a LIDL and street market stalls selling fruits just round the corner, Tesco Express opposite, shopping complexes and high street chains, etc, less than 5 min walk away.  Most importantly, the Airlink Express stops (to and from Airport) and Hop On and Hop Off Dublin sightseeing stops are all also about 5 min walk round the corner in O'Connell street.  Many restaurants in the vicinity.  Recommended by receptionist to dine in The Church Gallery Restaurant (also a cafe, bar, nightclub) nearby on our first night and the food was excellent (reservation recommended during peak hours)!  It is within easy walking distance across the river to Temple Bar.  

Not a luxurious hotel but clean and comfortable.  We had buffet breakfast included in our package.  Wide selection but nothing to shout about.

Very good for first time visitors to Dublin for the convenience.",4,2015,08,30
231,Great location ,"Stayed here with a friend for 2 nights. 
Hotel is in a great location- just off O'Connell street. There is a tesco over the road which is handy and a little cafe that does a lovely breakfast.
The room was spotless and the beds very comfy. Staff were friendly and check in was quick. 
We ate in the restaurant one night and the food was gorgeous with brilliant service. 
We also had drinks in the bar- again brilliant service. I expected to be really expensive but found both food & drinks were reasonably priced.
Couldn't fault the hotel at all and will definitely book to stay here if I ever return to Dublin. ",5,2015,08,30
231,Not pleasant...DIY breakfast ,"After a long days traveling my husband and I along with our son arrived at the hotel after asking for directions from a receptionist who hadn't a clue and when we got checked in finally we made our way to the restaurant for a meal ...it was there that we met the receptionist again who now was the food and beverage manager ..she replied after we requested a table that ""maybe the bar would be better for you "" being the owner of a bar and restaurant I found this statement extremely rude and bad for business ..luckily we met a lovely Dublin girl working in the bar and she looked after Us Fantastically ...the conceirge was a gentleman and very pleasant too ....the rooms were spotless and the bar lovely ..unfortunately for breakfast I spent the most part of it running after a waiter as there was no butter or no tea spoons even though he tried to pan me off with low low spread and dessert spoons ! (Really for stirring a cuppa tea ) ???dont think we'll be back there ....hard to bet the Arlington ",3,2015,08,28
231,"Good Location, average hotel","The hotel was in a good location for the airlink airport bus, and the hop on hop off bus. Both locations are just around the corner on O'Connell street.  Other than that it was just an average hotel, nothing special. Eat breakfast across the street, don't eat the buffet. 
So...if you are on a budget, not a bad place to lay your head....i would go back.",3,2015,08,27
231,Recommended ,"Staff were friendly and helpful. We arrived before check in time and were checked in straight away. The location was great, close to temple bar and a lot of other attractions.

Food not bad.",4,2015,08,23
231,Well placed hotel - BUT disinterested staff and a favourite of  large tour groups,"The best point about staying at this particular Jury's Inn is the location. However, we found most things were quite close in Dublin anyway. The rooms here at Parnell Street were clean and about the average comfort level for this type of establishment.  The place itself is really a hotel for large tour groups with lots of coaches arriving and departing all day long.  We arrived just as two large tour groups did which added to the time it took us to check inn.  We were particularly upset with the staff who could not direct us to adequate parking.  We had been travelling throughout Ireland and arrived in our modest size car which had a roof box.  After driving for 4 hours to get to Dublin, including large delays driving into the centre of Dublin owing to two sporting events taking place, we could not find a place to park.  We tried parking in the car park that is suggested by the hotel but there is a height restriction of 2.0m.  The hotel staff were useless, I explained our situation and the check inn clerk told me that NO ONE had ever stayed there who had a roof box on their car and he could not suggest anywhere in Dublin to park. There is no on street parking locally. I ask what he thought we could do, he just shrugged his shoulders! Another staff member advised that we could try to find a meter, but this would need to be 'fed' every 2 hours until 11pm and resumed about 7am throughout our stay at a cost of something like 2 euros every 2 hours!!  Another member of staff then became involved in our conversation and said that 'last week a German couple had come with a roof box, and their solution was to take the box off the car and store the box in a luggage store room within the hotel""  (!!)  Just craziness.  After another hour of driving around we came back to the hotel and found that the car park immediately behind the hotel will fit a car with a roof box.  (When we had gone 'round the first time this car park had been full and had  indicated 2.0 restriction as well) Desperation had forced us to drive in! This car park was great and far closer than the suggested car park (the one the hotel recommends suggests a very very modest price reduction for Jury's Inn visitors)  The staff even suggested the car park we were in was not safe.  This was just not true there was a person insitu 7-11 and cctv 24/7.

Breakfast here was a disappointment, the orange juice was watered down and owing to the large tour groups we found at times the kitchen hadn't caught up with the amount of food that was being devoured. 

This is not a place I would return to.  Happily there is a Holiday Inn Express being built a stone's throw away, whom I think I would prefer to try if I am ever in Dublin again.  We also stayed at the Jury's Inn Customs House not far away which I think was far superior to this one.  Car park accommodated our car with roof box with no problems and had superior rooms and no large tour groups.",3,2015,08,23
231,Good hotel,"Good hotel, accommodation spotless and up to date, staff friendly and efficient, we had a problem in the room but it was sorted out within minutes.  Great location for the tourist sites and restaurants, shopping etc  Good value. Happy to recommend!",5,2015,08,23
231,Surprise 30th trip for my Boyfriend,"I cannot say anything but fantastic things about the Jury's Inn.  From booking the room to check in they were very helpful, and all the staff we met during our stay were exceptional.  We had breakfast both mornings and were seated straight away.  As in any busy hotel there were points at which you were stood waiting with a couple of people but nothing beyond a minute or two.  The selection of breakfast foods was again brilliant and set us up for the days exploring Dublin.  As the hotel is so close to the centre we walked everywhere.
The room was a good size and there was more than enough wardrobe space for us two. The bathroom was clean and stocked with shower gels & soap etc and it was a refreshing change to have a bath to soak in after a long day!
We ate in the restaurant on the second evening and again staff were more than helpful & food was very good and in my opinion reasonably priced for a hotel. The bar was well stocked and had a pleasant atmosphere. 
 We will definitely stay here again when we return to Dublin.",5,2015,08,22
231,my exemplary say,"Can not complain about my stay at Jurys inn my family had a great time the staff were friendly and helpful the facilitys were excellent and is situated in a great place 

stay was excellent and my family had a great time 😊 
      
      ",5,2015,08,21
231,Dublin Stay,"This is the second time we've stayed here.The food in the bar is really good in my opinion but its a little on the costly side. We didn't eat in the restaurant as its pretty much the same price as the bar food but the food is so different and way too 'fancy' for me there is nothing in the menu that I would eat. We ate in the room one night but we had to go down to order, then again to collect the food and again to bring the empty plates back which was a little annoying especially with a young child. The rooms were really clean and we had enough space for a four year old to run around and play which was great. My son got a toy which needed batteries and a staff member went and got a screwdriver for us. The staff were very friendly for the most part. Everything is in walking distance. There is free wifi in the room but if you want to stream or skype etc be prepared to pay 10 euro for 48 hours. Overall this is one of the best hotels we've stayed in and we will be returning again.",5,2015,08,21
231,Superb...,"Attended a conference near the airport and wanted to spend the last day in Dublin (Temple Bar) so had this hotel booked. I can honestly say from entrance to exit (with slight exception of breakfast ) it was superb. Service was brilliant, efficent and friendly.  The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. Breakfast was tasty, just a little bit busy, but there is a sign in the lift suggesting best times to go though.
Definitely a jewel in a great rich city and would most certainly recommend.",5,2015,08,21
231,Worth going to Jury's Inn in Parnell Street just to see Gilber in the restaurant,"We had a great stay at the Jury's Inn in Parnell Street, Dublin.

Gilber who was working in the restaurant during breakfast service was excellent, polite, cheerful and very helpful.  A complete joy and a real asset to the hotel.",4,2015,08,21
231,Sightsee Dublin,"We went on 2 family sightseeing trip to Dublin . There were 4 adults and 3 Children .Stayed at Jury's inn Parnell Street ,v happy with location. Rooms were clean and comfortable . Our view was out back so not nice but this didn't bother us as we spent v little time in room . Would recommend this hotel and will return hopefully !",4,2015,08,21
231,Excellent Location,"Stayed at the Jurys Inn, Parnell Street on a recent visit to Dublin. All-in-all a pretty good experience. The hotel is far enough away from the Temple area to be quiet and yet close enough to the main drag to be convenient for everything including the airport bus service. Room was of a good size and bed was comfy but not quite sure about the view which was basically a derelict area at the back of the hotel, or the reason they gave me a disabled room. By far the highlight were the staff, from the moment you walked in to the last Guinness you ordered at the bar on the 2nd floor, these guys are top-notch and would therefore consider staying there again.",4,2015,08,21
231,Great hotel near everything ,"Stayed here for 2 nights with my partner. Not far from airport. Only 20 euros. Hotel was clean and tidy and could leave bags when checking out so didn't have to carry them around with us. Shops and shopping centres nearby and just a short walk to Temple Bars, which were expensive but worth going especially at night when it was lively. Lots of gift shops around and places to eat. Would definatley stay here again as it was central to everything. ",5,2015,08,20
231,Long weekend,"Had a great time, hotel very close to city centre. Dublin is a great city with great music in the pubs. Rugby was on and the hurling semi final. The bar staff were so quick and there was not 1 time we had to wait for a drink. 
      
      ",5,2015,08,20
231,Dublin visit," To be honest the hotel itself is ok but the overall experience was poor.
We got off to a bad start as reception did not recognise the booking reference & handed back the voucher to me & asked me to confirm with whom we had booked the room. Eventually the booking was sorted. Lunch from the bar on the 2nd floor was just ok. The room was fine, clean and tidy, comfortable bed.
Breakfast buffet was ok.  In my opinion this is not a very welcoming hotel. Very few staff about  the place &  from what I observed very little interaction between staff & hotel guests. Apparently the hotel was full but very few guests in the bar & restaurant. Reception did make a dinner reservation for us - I requested this during check-in. Overall, I paid top dollar for the one night B&B 4 star price but not 4 star service. This seems like a hotel on automatic pilot. 
 
      ",3,2015,08,20
231,Lucky,"We lucked in to this hotel and it was great. We arrived from the States so we were a bit tired. It was an easy 5 min walk from the airport shuttle stop. Then we got lucky our room was available so we were able to check in early and shower before hitting Dublin. Breakfast was good. We wanted to have dinner but they close at 9:30 like most places. The staff was fantastic and friendly. Great location to shops, bus stops and cinema. Would absolutely stay there again. We were on the second floor. It was extremely convenient to breakfast and quiet.",5,2015,08,20
231,loved Ireland,"Went to Ireland to research family history.  Stayed at Jury's Inn,  Parnell Street, Dublin. The hotel was great, room was clean, staff were very friendly, especially Przemek who always met us with a smile and always went out of his way to accomodate any of our needs.  He always greeted us with ""hi guys"", which we found so endearing.  Would absolutely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again as it was close to everything.  The hotel and Przemek made our stay a great one.  Thank you Ireland.",5,2015,08,19
231,"Good location, great accomodations, good value.","About a 5-10 minute walk into the temple bar area, market right around the corner. Several good pubs with good food and traditional irish music nearby. Shuttle bus to Galway, 10 minute walk with carry-on size luggage. 3 minute walk from where Aircoach bus drops you off if your coming from the Dublin airport(city centre stop).

Room was comfortable. No mini-fridge but all else was nicely appointed. Service in the hotel was excellent/friendly.I would stay here again.",4,2015,08,19
231,Great Location. Great Price ,Booked back in March and stayed in August 2015. Fabulous hotel. Lovely greeting. We arrived at 9am and went to the hotel to see about leaving our bags - not an issue. Bags stored and we were given tickets to ensure we claimed the right bag by a lovely young gentleman who really made our welcome fantastic. Arrived back at around 3pm to check in and were incredibly impressed by our room. Clean. Spacious. Tolietries included and a hairdryer which was well used as we only had hand luggage on our flight to Dublin. Towels changed everyday and a quick walk to the centre of Dublin. Worth a stay! ,5,2015,08,19
231,Good location for a couple of nights,"Parking was a 5 minute walk away, but was difficult with suitecases. Good customer service and nice hotel - needs a bit of an upgrade in the corridors and would have liked a small bar fridge in the room. Location was good and would stay here again for 1-2 nights at the max.",3,2015,08,18
231,Jury's Inn,"Expensive for what is provided at 177euros per night with breakfast.
The rooms are small and rather basic but breakfast is really good.
It is close to everything that a tourist wants to see and therefore is convenient.
The bar prices are also expensive so you need to go to one of the many bars in the street if you want value for money",3,2015,08,18
231,"Convenient location, good place to stay","Walking distance from shopping steets and Temple Bar district. No noise from bars. Nice simple rooms, nothing wrong with it, but beds are too hard for us. 
Try to avoid rooms at the back side of the hotel because of the noise of trucks (LIDL, garbage)
      ",3,2015,08,17
231,Large but solid lodging option in Parnell Square,"We were in Dublin one Saturday night before taking a flight home the next morning, and we had tickets to the Abbey Theater, so we decided to stay in the Parnell Square area.  Jury's Inn was easy to find and, while not as charming as a boutique hotel, we were greeted warmly at check-in and were quite comfortable during our stay.  Breakfast was good, although there was a caution sign that the best time to go and get a table right away was between 7 and 8; after that there might be a short wait, which gives an idea of how large the hotel is.  But the room was quiet and comfortable and the location was convenient.",4,2015,08,17
231,"Great staff,great location","We arrived at 10am thinking we couldn't check inn but the lovely staff had our room ready the welcome was lovely really friendly.. The room was great size very clean ,breakfast was great as well ,this hotel in great location right on top of main shopping area about 5-10 min walk to temple bar ,would recommend buying the 3day freedom bus ticket from airport value for money get about the city on the hop on buses .. Guinness factory great would go early tho as queuing gets busy same with the gaoul gets very busy would definitely stay at jury's inn if I return to Dublin again
      
      ",5,2015,08,17
231,Brilliant service,"Jury's inn was fantastic from the customer service to the location of the hotel and general all rounder. Great variety of breakfast, smooth and quick check in upon arrival, extremely friendly team members always willing to help. Prlemek was an excellent team member. No job was too big or too small. Whenever he would see us in the corridor, he would always serve us with a smile and ask how our stay was. He definitely made us feel at home. Thank you :) ",5,2015,08,17
231,Family Trip,"The hotel is in a perfect location for the City Centre. The hotels greatest asset is their staff who could not have been more friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful.  The room was clean and well maintained. The only criticism I have is the day after arriving we had a flood in our room whilst we were out. We were moved to another room and staff were very apologetic.  We were offered a free meal in the restaurant but as we were visiting family, we ate with them.   Would have preferred a discount on our room for the inconvenience,  especially as some of our things had got wet,  including my straighteners and shoes. Overall would still recommend hotel. Barring the flood, couldn't have asked for nicer hotel.",3,2015,08,17
231,Jurys Parnell St. Home from Home,"This is an excellent hotel with exceptional staff. I travel a great deal for business and this is truly a home from home....couldn't recommend it more highly. The rooms are very comfortable, the food delicious and the welcome....we'll see for yourself.
      
      ",5,2015,08,17
231,Can never fault it,"Stayed here at the start of the month. Everything you need in a hotel, prompt check in with no hassle. Arranged for my bags to be brought to my room. Rooms were lovely and clean with a decent tv. You can tell they are one of the leading chains as they are confident in what they sell. Great as always",5,2015,08,17
231,A great location,"We were only here for a 1 night stay but we we're really Impressed during that time. We landed early so assumed we'd have to store our bags & come back later but they checked us in at 9am no problem. Our room overlooked the inner courtyard so it was very quiet and the room itself was very pleasant - a decent size with a nice bathroom. Bed was comfy & the breakfast in the morning gave plenty of variety. 

It's the location you really stay here for though - it's a 5 minute walk from O'Connell street - the one where all the tour buses depart & with that strange 120metre Spire ( which apparently cost several million euros!?!). Anyway, all the main attractions of Dublin centre are pretty close by & seen as we were visiting for 2 days that was our main aim. 

On our departure day the hotel stored our bags, thanks to the ever so cheerful & helpful Mr Szafran - he epitomised the friendly staff here. We had a great stay here & would highly recommend it.",4,2015,08,16
231,Great Location,"Did exactly what we needed it to do. Great first stop on our trip to Ireland. Really close to pubs, restaurants, shops etc. Comfy beds, clean rooms and friendly staff. Only issue is that lack of parking, but as the hotel is so central we understand. Staff helped us locate parking a couple of blocks away. Many thanks!",4,2015,08,15
231,"Great location, good clean room","Easy access by air coach from Dublin airport, comfortable bed and a quiet location. Easy flat walking all over Dublin. Guinness brewery a comfortable 40 min walk. Breakfast was very good value and a good selection was offered. staff were pleasant and helpful with all enquiries",4,2015,08,15
231,Irish Welcome,"We arrived very early in the morning so our rooms weren't ready. They quickly offered to store our luggage and asked us to check back in a few hours. The lady (I forgot her name) was very well spoken and friendly. When our rooms were ready, The Manger on Duty helped us gather our luggage and offered assistance to the room. He was very professional and had a great smile. The rooms were smaller than we are use to. But they were clean and comfortable. Breakfast, a classic Irish buffet breakfast, was fantastic. The lounge was also a great evening spot. Overall the hotel & staff did a wonderful job. I would definitely stay again.",4,2015,08,14
231,"Excellent hotel, great location","Fantastic hotel and it was within' walking distance of lots of great restaurants, pubs, shopping and coffee shops. The only issue was parking; the hotel didn't have its own parking lot or garage. They recommended a public parking garage about 2 blocks away that was really nice, but it was an added cost to our trip.",4,2015,08,14
231,Ideal Location To Experience Central Dublin,"Great location, close to shopping and just around corner from O'Connell St for airport coach and sightseeing.  Comfortable beds and adequate breakfast.  Reception area was a little sterile and lacking in welcome.  ",4,2015,08,13
231,Stay at jurys inn Parnell street if you want good service.,"Love this hotel. Stay There for Five night last wèek. Clean rooms.  Very good  breakfast. Helpfull staf always smiling. In this hotel there  are No problems only solutions. The hotel is sentral and you can walk to most of the attraktions in Dublin.
Recomend this hotel for a Nice  stay in a lovely city. 
",5,2015,08,13
231,Excellent location and value for money!,"I recently travelled to Dublin for the first time as part of a group of 6 girls. All of the staff were helpful, even if at times they didn't always appear to know what was going on. The rooms were clean and the beds comfy. We stayed for 3 nights and the room was refreshed everyday and kept clean and tidy for us. We used the restaurant for breakfast on two mornings and it was good value for money, however I would have liked non-watered down orange juice! We also used the bar for an evening meal when we were rushing, the food was quickly prepared and delicious! They catered for one of our party members who has allergies to nuts and eggs.  The location of the hotel is brilliant! It is right in the centre and you have easy access to the Main Street with all of the bus stops on and are only. A short walk from the shops and Temple Bar. Across the road is a Tesco and opposite this is a Lidl, so if you want anything they are near by. We were very pleased with our hotel choice and it did everything we wanted.",4,2015,08,13
231,Dont bother staying here,"We got the Superior package, no superior in this package. Bread at breakfast was mouldy. Reported  to staff and they were horrified. Had to put up with pushing of tour group at breakfast. Room was noisy, bed so close to the wall it was hard to get in and out of.",1,2015,08,13
231,Better than most hotels in Dublin,"I have stayed in quite a few hotels in Dublin but I have to say, this was my favourite. Cheapest, cleanest, more modern and perfect location about. I stayed in a local not far called the Gresham (overrated). This was a million times better. The rooms were more spacious. The breakfast was great and you are right on the corner from the main shopping streets. This is where I will be sticking to if I'm going to Dublin!! Highly recommended.",5,2015,08,12
231,Great Location - Some Security Issues,"The hotel was lovely, clean, quiet and overall very nice.  The location is very good, near O'Connell Street, shopping centers, grocery stores, coffee shops, pubs, etc.  There was one major concern, however, that two days in a row the housekeeping staff failed to properly secure (lock) our room after cleaning.  We came back from sightseeing in the early evening to find our door unlocked (it opened without inserting our keycard).  We reported this on the first day.  The same thing happened on Day 2.  We reported it again.  No effort was made by the hotel to offer any accommodation for this lapse in security.  I've never had this happen before at any hotel.  The doors did have to be pulled very hard to close completely, but I learned this the first time I exited the room.  I find it hard to understand why the housekeeping staff was not more careful.",4,2015,08,12
231,Above average Hotel close  to Dublin City Center,"We stayed here 4 nights with six people and three rooms.  The beds were excellent with plenty of pillows.  The front desk personnel were helpful and allowed us to use the lock-up to store our luggage.  Food was average, but plenty of it.  We were supposed to have a full breakfast the first day of our tour, but early arrivals were refused it and served only continental, but later arrivals were given the full breakfast??? Rooms were very small with no view. except backs of buildings as expected in the city.  Very loud noises below our daughters room had them up at 6AM their only day to sleep in.  Pricey, but excellent location for sightseeing.  Not many restaurants very close, but more as you walked toward the Temple Bar area. There was WIFI but it was spotty and seemed to mess our phones up?? You must have a room card for the electricity in your room to stay on, so ask for three keys if you usually get two.  You must have a specific one to go from floor to floor which was very annoying when they put my daughter on another floor.  Anytime you leave the room you MUST have a card to get back to it....",4,2015,08,11
231,Ok place ,"The room was lovely and spacious when I stayed here overnight. Unfortunately though I was unhappy with the room location. I paid quite a lot for the room for the night and we were situated behind the hotel where the county council handle rubbish, the entire night all we could hear was loud machinery at work. Also the air conditioning in the room wasn't working so it was overly hot, anytime you switched it on it blew out more hot air. The staff were wonderful and the amenities were great but I wish I had received a better placed room for what money I was paying.  ",3,2015,08,11
231,Jurys Inn Parnell Street,"Good service, good location and convenient to shopping and public venues.
 It is my hotel of preference when in Dublin.  I will stay there again and I recommend it to other business colleagues when they go to Dublin.                                             

      ",4,2015,08,11
231,Good location,"The Jurys Inn is well located in Dublin. The only negative opinion has to do with the free wifi service, which was rather poor. If you will improve the service, you should pay for it. Breakfast is ok. 
      
      ",3,2015,08,10
231,A very convenient member of the Jury's Group,"Parnell St. Jury's Inn was new to me after returning to the Custom House many times as well as Belfast and Galway Jury's.  It wasn't exactly where I had in mind, but was in the heart of the historical area of 1916, and only a 15 minute walk to the Trinity College zone.  Restaurants and pubs nearby were familiar from previous trips.  The hotel is clean and fresh feeling.  The staff is friendly and very professional, trying to make the guests as comfortable as possible.",4,2015,08,10
231,Pleasant stay,"I stayed for two nights with my 7 year old daughter and we had a great stay. The breakfast was good, although the restaurant was quite busy. However, they gave us trays and told us we could sit in the bar. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and we got a better room than the one we had originally booked. Very happy!
      ",4,2015,08,10
231,Very nice,Excellent hotel with excellent customer service. Cannot find fault with this establishment. Hotel is situated very central to everything. My only complaint would be the wifi connection was not very stable. Lovely staff the girl Lisa that checked us in was very helpful with information and suggestions on what to do on our stay.,5,2015,08,10
231,Nice stay,"Two night stay part of a 52 person bused tourist group.  First night stay was at the beginning of the tour, while the last night was at the end of the tour.  Average size bedrooms with some storage, a writing desk with a chair, and a small round table.  Shortcomings are no safe, or extra sitting chair for a second person.  Hotel has good location to the city centre for shopping and Pubs.  The continental breakfast was good and supported multiple tour group breakfasts.  I would return.",4,2015,08,09
231,GREAT LOCATION|Would stay here again!!,"Stayed in this hotel as a couple. 
The hotel was amazing. 
We arrived at the hotel around 10am to ask if we could leave our bags whilst we spent our day in Dublin, the hotel receptionist advised we could check in straight away which was really useful. 
The hotel was very clean and modern. Rooms were lovely and equipped with hairdryer, shampoo, shower gel & flat screen tv. 
There was a double bed & 1 single in our room. 
Room was cleaned and towels were changed every day. 
(One thing I would recommend is using the 'do not disturb' sign when you are in your room at all times, as on a few occasions staff just walked in our room without knocking and one time being 8am.)
I could not fault anything about the hotel as staff were also very friendly and were happy to sit and tell you everywhere to go and how to get there. We asked a receptionist how to get to Dundrum to play mini golf and she even called the place for us to find the best way for us to travel. 
Breakfast was great, good choice of foods. 
WOULD DEFINITELY STAY HERE AGAIN!!!

Useful information

231,Excellent hotel!! Excellent value for money!,"This hotel is lovely and the perfect location to be able to explore the city. It is near to the amazing shops on O'Connell street and to the Dublin tour bus hop on hop off stop. Also the same place to board the ghostbus!! It is also a short walk down O'Connell street and over O'Connell Bridge and your soon on Dame street in the Temple Bar district! literally took only 10-15 mins walk and that was in heels!!
The hotel staff are friendly and offer excellent customer service. the bar area is lovely spacious design and great choice of drinks available. We actually didn't eat in the hotel as we spent all our days out and about exploring this amazing city and eating in restaurants!! but the menu looked lovely and lots of choice available!  The rooms were clean, bright and spacious with air conditioning and also a good sized shower bathroom. The beds were very comfortable which is needed after a tiring day exploring the city and the evenings enjoying the nightlife. Fantastic place to stay!!",5,2015,08,08
231,Ideally located for sightseeing,Excellent hotel with excellent customer service.  Cannot find fault with this establishment - from check-in and reception staff to concierge to plentiful breakfast. Rooms were clean and large enough to accommodate the family. Stayed 4 nights here and would certainly stay again on return to Dublin - no hesitation. O'Connell Street a 2 min walk from hotel and transport good and frequent.,5,2015,08,08
231,won't be going back .,"Won't be going back,not worth the money and not a very pleasant overnight stay. The breakfast was a joke,ordered poached eggs and all we could taste was vinegar...yuk, The bar staff needs to speak and understand the international english language and also be taught which glasses to use for which drink and how to make at least 5 cocktail drinks. It is not every body who drinks Beer as it seems that was all that they knew how to serve.
      
      ",1,2015,08,07
231,Value for money,They call themselves a 3 star hotel but their rooms are no less than a 4 star hotel. Excellent service. Excellent location. You're basically in the heart of the city centre or downtown. Breakfast is too warm and good. Staff is friendly. 10/10.,4,2015,08,06
231,Northern edge of Dublin centre,"The hotel itself if fine, bar was ok, staff were friendly.  But scoring 3/5 because the hotel location is not great, not truly terrible, but walking out onto the rather run down area slightly spoils the start to each day.  If it was further south it probably would cost more, that trade off needs to be considered.  I think the rooms are laid out in a square with rooms each side of the corridor.  I do not think the views from any room could be good, ours were over a very run down area.  The internal rooms must be looking at some sort of internal space.",3,2015,08,06
231,Such friendly and helpful Staff,We went to this hotel for a hen do - none of us had ever been to Dublin and the staff were so helpful in telling us where there good places to go and how to get there!! The rooms were lovely and clean/modern. Definitely will recommend this hotel to everyone I know as it made our visit so much better!!! ,5,2015,08,05
231,A truly wonderful place to stay!!,"Wow to sum up this hotel in 200 words is quite a challenge but the location is superb!! It's right in the centre where you need to be to experience Dublin and all the wonders of the 'Emerald Isle'!! The fabulous Temple bar district is only a short walk away (10-15 mins) and the hotel is situated close to the shopping streets too. There is also some excellent bars, cafes and restaurants!! It is central for you to go exploring the city too either by bus, tour bus or by the tram but also you can enjoy walking around too. Its all close by the hotel perfect hotel choice! The hotel itself is modern clean with large spacious rooms and the staff are all wonderful and offer excellent customer service!! ",5,2015,08,05
231,Aug 2015,"The hotel was good back in Aug of 2011 during a previous visit, but has been modified to an even nicer place.  The staff was very helpful and accommodating when we had to change plans due to our flight being cancelled.  The breakfast (buffet style) was good, complete with sausages, puddings, bacon, eggs (various styles), fruit, and pastries/breads.",5,2015,08,04
231,Highly Recommended,"The Jury's Inn is a perfect hotel for great value. The hotel is centrally located in Dublin City and a short walk to many options for shopping and eating. The hotel itself is comfortable with a clean room and amenities. The breakfast has good variety and the staff is also very friendly which is always welcoming.

Only downside is a bath shower, which one has to be careful not to slip in.",4,2015,08,03
231,Brilliant location for this hotel.,"My friend and I stayed here Thursday to Monday. We had a lovely room 371 with a double and single bed very comfortable. We had bed and breakfast,  and the food in the bar and restaurant was lovely. All staff were friendly but we really like Anna (manager) ""7"" you know what we mean...Ha Ha!!! and Laura waitress in the restaurant. We went to see the Body Guard at the theatre and it was fantastic. We had an action packed few days. There is a pub/restaurant to the right of the hotel called the Parnell which had Irish music and food was the best!! The bar owner was really friendly and we had good  few nights in there.  We did hop on hop off bus was great. Recommend the gaol and leprechaun museum. All in all Dublin was amazing so happy we went. Easy walking distance to shops bars and temple bars I promise only 5 mins away and main shops turn left out of hotel then left again and all shops are in front.We also booked afternoon tea near Grafton Street in 5* hotel it was well worth it and nice experience. Thanks Jury's Inn Parnell Street. Have already recommended our friends..",5,2015,08,03
231,"Great Location, friendly staff","Arrival at Jury's Inn was welcoming from the greeting outside on the sidewalk to the desk clerk.  Our room was ready early and we were able to immediately check in.  The lobby was large and inviting, and we were told there had been recent upgrades to the hotel.
The room was on the small side, but very comfortable.  The wifi worked great.
Shammy the Guest relations manager, was extremely helpful directing us to local pubs and shopping.  He arranged taxi's and on our day of departure, arranged a bagged breakfast for us.  Super hotel and we will back!",4,2015,08,02
231,Quiet and Comfortable,"Conveniently located, pleasantly kind staff, and well cared for rooms, all the staples of a great hotel. Right off Parnell, its a short walk to quite literally anywhere downdown.
The breakfast in the morning never was short of supply, and the variety made me feel as if I had finally moved home again.",5,2015,08,02
231,Good basic hotel,This is a good basic hotel. Convenient location. Shopping area is a 3-minute walk. Walking distance from Temple Bar. Hotel room is generally clean. Room size is average but it's not cramped. Hotel staff are polite. This is definitely good value for money.,3,2015,08,02
231,Rest and recuperation,"Warm friendly staff, clean rooms and high standard fittings etc. Staff were helpful with sightseeing and information about how to get there and how long etc it would take. We would stay at a Jury's Inn elsewhere and recommend it to others.
      
      ",5,2015,08,01
231,Great hotel & fantastic location  ,"Stayed her recently with my family, it's a marvellous hotel.  Brilliant location as O'Connell St is a few minutes walk away.  The room had a very comfy double bed and comfy sofa bed.  The room and bathroom was clean and housekeeping brought more towels and pillows on request.
The staff were helpful and friendly. Will definitely stay here again. ",4,2015,07,31
231,Not bad for the price,"Relatively cheap by Dublin standards and it's pretty central too. The room was clean, temperature was perfectly controllable and the entire stay was quiet. The breakfast is all buffet style and was plenty suitable despite being a bit pricey.

Staff were very friendly and check in and out was very smooth.",4,2015,07,31
231,customer care and going the extra mile,This is a very clean friendly well run hotel.rooms are spacious beds comfortable and location great. But the best part is that the young manager Jessica and her team are not only on top of operations but quickly warmly and appropriately responded to all our special needs. We are a family who keep the jewish sabbath and this necessitated us asking for some special attention . Jessica unobtrusively strove to understand our needs and mailed the staff to pull them onto the same page making our stay easy and most comfortable.I also want to single out Louise in the dining room who took every opportunity to make our lives easy and was warm friendly professional and a real joy to have connected with. I think the hotel can now be considered orthodox jewish friendly and would highly recommend this hotel and team. Elana Godley South africa,5,2015,07,30
231,Over priced,"Where to start- room basic- bed rolled away from wall while we slept. 
Paid 209 for one night stay WITHOUT breakfast. I really don't no how they can get away with charging ridiculous prices just because a concert is on. The only good thing about this hotel is the location",3,2015,07,30
231,Family Visit,"An excellent hotel with very friendly staff & the breakfast for 9 Euro was so enjoyable & good value.
The hotel at breakfast time was mobbed but the staff handled the situation extremely well, even the head housekeeper mucked in & had time to ask about our stay. 
Our flight was not until later that day & they stowed our luggage until we were due to leave for the airport. 
If we return to Dublin we will book this hotel again.",5,2015,07,30
231,Good location,"The location of this hotel is good. About 10-15 minutes walk to the Temple Bar Area. We didn't pay for the breakfast here but I think for the price of the hotel they could offer the breakfast in with the price.

I think if we came to Dublin again we would rather stay a bit closer to the Temple Bar Area so it feels a bit safer walking back late at night.",4,2015,07,29
231,Perfect stay in perfect hotel,"a group of 6 of us headed down to Dublin for the ed sheeran concert and ofcourse when we got there we realised I had booked the Saturday night instead of the Friday night!!! However Jurys parnell was totally accommodating from start to finish. I got a full refund for th 3 re Saturday and got 3 rooms for the Friday with bfast thrown in. That's customer service!! even though it was my fault!. great service, service with a smile. My second time staying here so central to everything in Dublin I had to make a review. Thanks again
      ",5,2015,07,29
231,Great Service,"Stayed in Jury's on Friday night prior to the Ed Sheeran concert. Service was excellent from the second we arrived. I can only say good things about the maintenance man David. I had got separated from my group and struggled with several bags. David seen I was distressed and offered his help. After politely directing me to my room he went out of his way to make sure I was reunited with my friends in the restaurant. A real gentleman and just an example of the customer service I received while at the hotel. Thank you Jury's and thank you David, I had a very enjoyable stay",5,2015,07,29
231,Excellent location nice hotel,"Myself and my husband stayed here for two nights we arrived at 11am and we got the keys to our room there and then so we were able to drop our bags off and get settled the room is small but clean and practical the bar is on the second floor and it lacks atmosphere but it's ok for a quick pint before heading out, the breakfast was included in our 2 night stay but if I had to pay extra I wouldn't have eaten here, the breakfast was horrible in my opinion food was cold and the breakfast staff were a disaster there were no clean cups for tea/coffee and there were 3 staff members chatting with the trolley of clean cups while a que formed but this didn't stop them chatting the coffee machine on both mornings needed to be topped up with coffee and it showed up empty filter think all these little things were down to the staff they showed little interest in anything other than chatting amongst themselves I couldn't flaw the bar staff or the staff on reception all in all would defiantly return here but would avoid breakfast ",5,2015,07,29
231,Great Location and Great Staff,"We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights as we were there to see Ed Sheeran at Croke Park. The location is great as it is near lots of bars, pubs, places to eat and all the main shops. You are about a 10min walk from O'Connell Street from there you can walk to Grafton Street, St Stephens Green and you are about a 25min walk from Croke Park.
Our room on the third floor was fine for us, nice and clean and all the staff were very nice, would recommend and stay again when next in Dublin.",4,2015,07,29
231,A Good place to stay,"We stayed 4 nights at this hotel. The rooms are clean. Location is good as it is within walking distance to most sight seeing places such as Trinity College, Dublin Castle, Temple Bar, St.Stephen's Green; and the pick up stations for day tours (eg. for a day trip to Cliffs of Moher or Gaint's Causeway, Belfast).   Henry Street, one of the two principal shopping streets of Dublin, is located almost right next to it. Henry Street is a very nice place for shopping with Arnotts, Debenhams, Dunnes, Pennys and lots more.There is ""Ginos"" for creps, waffles and ice-cream as well.",4,2015,07,29
231,Excellent hotel in the centre of Dublin,"Hotel was very clean and well furnished, breakfast was excellent and more important the staff were excellent, would recommend it to anyone looking for a hotel in the city centre. We arrived early from the airport around 11 am and the check in staff we able to find us a room ready prepared so no waiting until the official check time.",5,2015,07,28
231,Good family room - great staff and good restaurant and bar,"Easy check in and friendly staff. We had a family room which was functional with a full bathroom with the highlight being ""this room features an electric kettle"" (although only two teabags although the staff quickly added to our provisions! Room was located at the back of the hotel so there was some noise at night from trucks delivering but thankfully we were so jetlagged it didn't infringe too much. Good location within walking distance from the Liffey and Temple Bar area as well as the shops but a bit of a hike to Grafton Street. Good breakfast and terrace was very nice. Reasonable price including breakfast.",4,2015,07,27
231,To sleep & shower ,"Busy 3 star hotel, lots of groups of people, large commercial hotel centrally located. No personal service. Basically a place to sleep & shower. Filled w tourists on large group economic tours. Clean. No room service. Bring your own bar soap. ",3,2015,07,27
231,Jury's in dublin,Great weekend had at Jury's in Dublin. Staff were very kind and very helpful. Cleen room was maintained and breakfast was good. A little disappointed that their are no toilets on the reception floor and you have to go back up lift to second floor but overall good.,5,2015,07,27
231,Such a good location,"this hotel is such a great find. Central Dublin is obviously expensive but this hotel was priced well considering it's just off O'Connell St . We found the staff very helpful . The rooms were lovely although we did have an awful view of the recycling dump out the back . We weren't there for the views so it didn't matter. It was so quiet despite being so central.
The breakfast buffet was a great start to the day - fuelling up before walking miles all over the city . 
We would return next time in Dublin .",5,2015,07,27
231,"Lovely hotel, great location",Ideal base to explore the city. Very central and within easy walking distance of main attractions. Good location. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Hotel was clean and comfortable. would stay here again when back.,5,2015,07,27
231,Fast efficient check in,"Clean comfortable room, courtyard room was nice and quiet. Shower and water pressure very good. Angela checked us in and was efficient and friendly. We arrived at 9 a.m. And they gave us a room straight away. Great location to walk to everything. Th e16 bus at the top of o'connell street takes you across the river to Dame St.  The only thing I did not like was the breakfast. Flabby undercooked bacon. Strange tasting watery scrambled eggs. Undercooked tomatoes, soggy mushrooms. Coffee had no taste at all.",3,2015,07,26
231,Our stay in Dublin,"The overall experience at your hotel was great.   As you will find in the comments there was a bit of a problem when we checked in.  The person at the front desk gave us poor directions to the off site parking area.  This led to us getting lost in Dublin late at night.  We were helped by a friendly cab driver who assisted us in finding the garage and then brought us back to the hotel.  We were advised by several people, that the neighborhood was not a good place to be walking about late at night.  It would be helpful to provide a better visual map for guests to find off site parking and if the area is indeed unsafe ,  a cab escort.",4,2015,07,26
231,Terrible,"Arrived at 3 o'clock, check in was 2. Told by a very rude member of staff that our rooms weren't ready yet. After trying to check in for nearly an hour and being sighed at as we were a large group our rooms still weren't ready and we were told they wouldn't be until 4.15. 3 people staying in a room and when we got to the room found there was only 2 towels, rang reception and asked for more. None were sent so had to make another call. Also when arrived back to hotel that night the only boy in the group was told he wasn't a part of our group. Only good thing about hotel was the location.     ",1,2015,07,26
231,Amazing stay.,From check-in to check-out our whole experience of staying at Jury's Inn Pernell Street was amazing. The facility was first class in every way. The kids loved the ice machines! Great location for a family city break. We will be back!,5,2015,07,25
231,Very handy and great base,"This was the 3rd time my daughter and I have stayed at this hotel. The check in was seamless and we got a room close to the lifts which is the way to go as it is quite a large hotel. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The room was tidy and comfortable - also free wi-fi. As others have noted the breakfast was very good. We normally went down on the latish side to avoid tour groups who usually have quite early breakfasts.

The great advantage of this hotel is the location just a minute or so walk to O'Connell  St which is considered the city centre. The aircoach bus stop is also just around the corner. It is the best way to get to and from the airport (E11 return as at July 2015). Also in O'Connell St is the Dublin Bus central office.

Public transport fares in Dublin have been somewhat of a mission in previous years. There are 3 key providers, Dublin Bus, the LUAS (electric tram) and the DART which is suburban rail. However up to now there was no one ticket to cover all three.

Enter the LEAP card. It is a card which can be loaded with any set amount and used for travel on any of the 3 providers. There is a E5 deposit which is refundable. You should register the card so it can be cancelled and reissued if lost or stolen.These tag/tag off cards are now commonplace in Europe. For may travellers, the great benefit is the capping of fares. Fares in a 7 day period on any combination of providers is capped at E40 for an adult, E15 for a child (yes kids actually pay less than half unlike many other countries). 

Once the total fare value reaches E40, you pay nothing more. The net effect is that by loading E40 on your leap card, you get unlimited travel for a week. The daily cap is E10 (E3.50 child). If you intend to do quite a bit of travelling around and are likely to be in Dublin for 4 days or more you should use the weekly capping figure.

But NOTE:

The 7 day capping runs from Monday to Sunday only. So if you get a LEAP card on Weds and load E40, you will only get unlimited travel until Sunday night. However the capping system will still ensure that you pay no more than E10 a day.

The bus service will get you to most locations but it will be quicker if where you want to go is serviced by a LUAS or DART station. For others like the ZOO, the 46a bus goes from Parnell Square west (just past the Sinn Fein shop - couple of mins away) direct to Phoenix park and a 5 min walk to the zoo.

For the shoppers getting to the biggest mall of all - blanchardstown - is a little trickier. Catch the 46a (going other way) to the O'Connell Bridge, cross the Liffey, turn right and walk about 5 mins along Essex Quay to stop 1443. Catch the 39a to Blanchardstown.

There are many things to see in Dublin, far more than can be described here. The Zoo is well worth a visit as is Malahide Castle, Trinity College, Liffey Valley shopping centre, Dundrum Mall (Green LUAS line) and St Stephens Square.

In terms of eats, there is an excellent, reasonably priced restaurant straight across the road from the hotel, called the Kingfisher. Great menu and service. Just along the road at O'Connell St is a nice pub called Murrays - good food here

Finally we found the Irish very friendly and helpful. Dublin is a favourite of ours. A thought also is to take a day trip to Galway or Limerick by the modernised Irish Rail",4,2015,07,24
231,Jurys Inn at Parnell street,Nice hotel with very pleasant dining room. The bathrooms nicely up to date and very clean. For people who like to sleep with open window some rooms may be somewhat noisy from the street side. Overall nice place to stay.,4,2015,07,24
231,Wi-Fi Connection Setup Poor,"Process forces you to login each time when connecting to Wi-Fi, which proves to be both frustrating and annoying. The free connection option also has limited bandwidth unless you pay to upgrade. This is certainly not an ideal setup when checking email or surfing the net every couple of hours.",3,2015,07,23
231,"Great value, good location, fabulous breakfast!","Although a little difficult to find, Jurys Inn is well located in the heart of the city.  Room is clean and comfortable.  Breakfast is fabulous.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  We unfortunately had bad neighbour's for the first 2 nights but the next night was great.
      
      ",5,2015,07,23
231,Great location,"I can't say if this was value for money because we booked through points, but it was very comfortable and modern. Tea and coffee facilities were included.  We didn't have breakfast but it was on offer.  There are coffee shops next door virtually and a Lidl around the corner. I have only awarded 4 stars because we had a room on the back overlooking the refuse bin depot which wasn't very scenic!  But the hotel is probably worth 5 stars.",4,2015,07,23
231,Experience Dublin,"I can highly recommended Jurys Inn Parnell Street! There is very good connection to airport by public transport (16), all types of shops are close and city center is not far and it is possible just walk to all sights.
      
      ",5,2015,07,22
231,Great Location,"Stayed 2 nights in this Jury's Inn and found it to be clean and welcoming. 
Less than 5 minutes walk to main street in Dublin (O'Connell Street) where you can get tour bus or number of other bus services. 
Didn't eat in hotel so can't comment on food.",5,2015,07,21
231,"A wonderful, helpful place to stay","Stayed at the Jurys Inn in March 2015. as it was cheaper to fly to Dublin and hire a car to Cork, than fly there direct. We stayed the night at Dublin before flying back to UK. Unfortunately on our trip to Cork my Wife suffered a herniated Disc and was in a great deal of pain. And our night in Dublin was confined mainly to the room. Once on of the staff (unfortunately I cant remember her name) found out my Wifes condition, she reported it the Accomodation Manager. Dana Tunde Illes was absolutely wonderful. She found a wheelchair, when the front desk couldnt, she booked us into a Medical Centre just up Parnell St. She even got us a free extension to our room, so my Wife was more comfortable whilst waiting for the time to leave. So a really big thankyou to Her and Her Staff. Foodwise we only got a Takeaway Fish and Chips from the Kinfisher opposite the Hotel, which was really fresh and delicious. The Hotel is really well placed in Dublin, and was very clean and comfortable. There is a large Shopping Centre just down the road and a small Tesco opposite. Would definately return to this Hotel. This Hotel also has a little gym that is included.",5,2015,07,21
231,"Good location, poor cleanliness","I expected a clean bathroom in a 4 star hotel but to my disappointment not only was it dirty when we first arrived, but it wasn't cleaned during our stay. They only changed the towels and did the bed (although the sheets were tangled underneath!) Not good value for money...",2,2015,07,21
231,Irish Delight!,"A hotel to the point, all amenities in place; no need to remind of additional services but there are already there available. Truly a hotel with no fanfare but has a lot to offer.Highly recommendable!
      ",5,2015,07,20
231,Great dinner at The Grill!,"I have stayed at this hotel 1-2 times each year for about a decade. Tonight I presented my server, Jose, and Chef Alan with a tough new food plan from my doctor - no dairy, gluten or other grains - as well as my personal likes/dislikes. My server listened carefully, asked a lot of details and accurately relayed the messages to the kitchen. They put together a great meal, very savory and satisfying. I was very pleased with the service (thanks, Jose and Velina), the food (thanks, Alan) and the personal attention to every detail.",5,2015,07,19
231,Great stay,"We stayed here for 1 night room for 3 of us , reception staff really helpful , bar area & restaurant lovely high standards each member of staff we came across were helpful and went that extra mile . Central location great place to stay would definitely return .",5,2015,07,19
231,Great location,"Lovely hotel , friendly staff , clean and comfortable room in a great part of Dublin . Stayed here for St Patrick's and going back in November. Great value for money , loads to choose from at breakfast time too .",4,2015,07,18
231,What a hotel,Just spent 2 nite's here with my mother and 20 month old son. Be in dublin annually but this was our first stay at jurys and we were not disappointed. Will definitely be making this where we stay any more. The staff were amazing especially Przemeu the door man. He always had a smile and a word for my son. It's so central but really q5uirt at nite which you don't normally get in dublin. Room was clean and spacious. We ordered food from restaurant and they phoned us when it was ready and we took it up to room (room service with the expense) can't recommend this hotel enough. Will definitely be back before Christmas,5,2015,07,18
231,pre and post tour accommodation,"A comfortable well located hotel . Convenient access to bus to/from airport. Well located for access to hop on bus for tourist sight seeing and central city. The staff are friendly, helpful and welcoming.

231,"""It's a Great location""",Stayed here a while back! It's in a great location in Dublin seconds from Dublin's O'Connell St. The price is great for the quality of the room! It has very friendly and helpful staff! The bar is small and cozy! Room was very clean and warm! All round it's a great place to stay!,4,2015,07,16
231,Great Hotel in the centre of the city,"I go to Dublin quite regularly but this was my first time to Jurys in Parnell Street. Stayed here for 2 nights in a twin room. The hotel was very modern and the rooms were very comfortable. The only thing I will say is a chair (not the desk chair) would have been nice in the room... There was a table but no chair. I know that's a silly thing to comment on I know but it was literally the only thing missing.
The hotel has a good sized restaurant and bar with an outdoor courtyard, the car park was only a 3 or 4 min walk across O'Connell Street and the hotel itself was located perfectly- around the corner from O'Connell Street and Henry Street on the other side.
Would definitely go back! The staff here were also excellent- always saying hello in the corridors and in the lobby, makes it very welcoming.",5,2015,07,16
231,"Great location, comfortable, awesome breakfast","Stayed here for 2 nights at the start of our honeymoon. Travel agent recommended it. Location was great, short walk to main oconnell st. Staff were lovely. Buffet breakfast was really good!! Great place to stay. Happy to go back there next time in dublin.",4,2015,07,15
231,near perfect all round hotel!,"Pleasant, clean, friendly hotel in a great part of Dublin within easy reach of the center.

Great food with a large menu choice.  Rooms were very clean and well presented with large tv and wifi.. The shower in the room was one of the best I have ever used.",5,2015,07,14
231,Nothing to complain about.,"Our group had 3 rooms for aStag Do in July 2015
Staff were helpful, our rooms were modern clean and well equipped. Better than others in a similar price band.
Initially the location seemed a little far out from the centre of Dublin but once we found our bearings it was only a 10 minute stroll to Temple Bar , Grafton street etc.
It is very handy for high street shopping (2 minutes walk)
We didn't eat at the hotel but saw food being brought out and it looked pretty good.
Wifi wasn't very speedy and there were no PC terminals to print our boarding passes although reception did offer to print if we forwarded an email.",4,2015,07,13
231,small room for a high price,"The hotel was oke; staff was friendly, the hotel was clean and on a good location (walking distance from most attractions), however in my opinion the prices are too high for such a small room with an old dated bathroom.",3,2015,07,13
231,Great stay,"We stayed here for 3 nights in October 2014. First time visitors to Dublin and found it a perfect hotel for a base to check out the city. Friendly staff who were very helpful. Clean rooms. They let you leave luggage in store room if flight comes in early in the day / leaves late. 

About a nice 10 minute walk to Temple Bar/main shops. 

If you want to check out Croke Park stadium tour which is well worth the money - That is about a 20 minute walk away.",5,2015,07,13
231,Watch out for tour groups,"Got booked into this hotel by mistake, the hotel is fine, room was good and the restaurant/bar service was excellent.  Parking is a pain because it's two streets over.  Watch out for tour groups they tend to cause slow breakfast service.",4,2015,07,12
231,Great location,"Stayed here for St Patrick's Day this year. Great location, right around the corner from the parade. We were drunk for the entire time, cleaning team had fun and left a surprise for us! Eat dinner at the restaurant in the day and it wasn't great but it's hotel food. Great for visiting Dublin",5,2015,07,12
231,Lovely hotel,"I stayed in this hotel with my boyfriend in February for a birthday weekend break. It is in a good location - only a 5 minute walk to O'Connell street, 15 minutes to Temple Bar and about 35 minutes to the Guinness Storehouse. Everything we wanted to see really!

Rooms were very modern, clean and comfortable. Nice big shower room and comfy bed. Didn't go to the bar or restaurant so can't comment there. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful when we arrived, explaining everything to us.

There was a lot of building work/roadworks going on outside our room (we were on 4th floor) but you couldn't hear any noise.

I highly recommend Jury's Inn and I'd definetly come back.",5,2015,07,12
231,Price rip off,"Basic hotel who raised its average price from 100€ to 299 € for one night , hotel is centrally located staff are nice but price structure is a joke and a return to rip off Ireland have stayed in much better hotels around the world for half the price",1,2015,07,12

Will definitely return.  ",4,2015,07,08
231,Great Hotel & Location,"A nice modern hotel in a great central location to O'Connell Street and a 10 minute walk to the Temple Bar area. The room was very clean and comfortable (the quadrangle facing rooms are quieter than the street facing ones) and had all the usual accessories (TV, Hairdryer, Good free WiFi etc). The staff were very pleasant and friendly - the hotel manager was a common site in the lobby meeting and greeting guests!
The only small bugbear was the lifts, to use these you have to insert your room key before selecting the floor you want, both up and down, but if you are staying more than a couple of nights I am sure it would become second nature.",5,2015,07,08
231,Quality on a budget,"Stayed here for a few days last week.Very friendly staff , good food available at the bar , and fantastic value for money .

Room was spotless, lovely fluffy white towels, plus tea and coffee facilities.
Pleasant friendly staff, couldn't find a grumpy one in the building!
Didn't use all the facilities, due to short stay, but the bar looked very inviting.
Lots of road works outside, but no disturbance inside hotel.
Literally around the corner was O'Connell Street.
Walking distance to train station and bus stops.",5,2015,07,07
231,Fabulous,Amazing location. Really nice staff and the breakfast has plenty of options. We have been able to walk to all the sites from this hotel with the convience of local shops around you. The hotel room is very clean and fresh looking but pleasant and comfortable. The surrounding areas are safe and quiet enough to walk around at night.

231,Thumbs up from a fussy two and a half year old,"On a recent trip to Dublin, we first spent a night at the Etap attached to Birmingham airport. Well, our daughter was not at all impressed, ""I don't like it"" and ""Go home now"" were all she repeated before eventually falling asleep in the middle of and already not quite big enough bed.

The reaction at Jury's Inn couldn't have been more different. She loved her folded out sofa bed, ""Oh, this is nice"" and ""nice time"" we her comments in between bouncing on it.

The hotel was a nice 10-15 mins walk along O'Connell Street into town (assuming Milly was in her pushchair, otherwise allow a day or two) and very conveniently near the stop on the entertaining open top bus tour.

I slept well, although #305 being a room adjoining the lift lobby my wife was disturbed by some rather loudly talking youngsters in the middle of the night.

Friends staying elsewhere joined us the next morning for breakfast which too was really nice. A nice selection of cereals and fruits, pastries and a well topped up Irish breakfast with good coffee, a selection teas and juices. Milly like her egg so much she proceeded to eat mine too.

Nearby parking was available making this a relaxing and enjoyable stay. Will definitely revisit.",5,2015,07,06
231,the Jury's Inn Dublin,"Very nice hotel,  quiet, nice room, very good breakfast. Very well situated just a quarter by walk from temple bar and five minutes more to trinity collège.  2  negative point,  the price and the difficulty to find a parking  ( very expensive ) .  But it's a great adress to spend 2  or 3 nights ",4,2015,07,06
231,Good location and nice hotel,"We stayed here a couple of nights and it was very comfortable. Only a 15 minute or so walk from a lot of the main attractions. The only complaint I would have about the room was that their was almost no shelf space in the bathroom and had to keep swapping things in and out. They don't serve dinner here but there are plenty of nice little pubs close by, even one right over the street.  Breakfast in the morning was nothing fancy but there were choices from Irish breakfast to cereal and fruits and yoghurt.",4,2015,07,05

231,trip of a lifetime,"Jurysinn in a very accommodating,  we were part of a travel group.  The porter was great at telling us what to go see and how to get there.  The only thing that we disliked were the views.  The tubs were deep and high, so we had some elder visitors with us that had difficulty getting in the shower.",4,2015,07,05
231,Short Break,"Our 2nd visit to this hotel. Friendly staff. Good buffet breakfast, not included in price of our room. Room was clean and considering the location, very little noise. Well situated just off O'Connell Street. Two minute walk to airport bus. Will visit again.",4,2015,07,05
231,Short break Dublin,Very nice hotel.   Staff very pleasant and helpful.   Excellent room though sadly not the view! We were at the back and it was only for one night so not too bothered.   Breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice and good quality food.   Would stay again.,4,2015,07,04
231,Great Christmas break ,Stayed at Christmas 2014 for a long weekend and the price we paid was excellent for the service and hotel that it was. The hotel was situated close to the centre with lots to do around it. We stayed b&b and the food was lovely. We would definitely return ,5,2015,07,04
231,good for a quick stop over,"Stayed here with my wife for a night in the city centre, its a nice hotel comfortable rooms, but its not a hotel you would relax in the lobby or bar, its really just a hotel to go out enjoy Dublin eat and drink other places put your head down and go home home next day, wasn't impressed.",4,2015,07,04
231,Beautiful and good value,"The hotel was lovely, the room was clean and air conditioned. The food was a great quality and the room was comfortable. The city centre location made this a great choice for a hotel in the heart of Dublin.",4,2015,07,03

All in all a nice place to stay.",4,2015,07,03
231,"Central Location, Quiet, Clean Room","We took a few days to visit Dublin, Ireland, in January also to celebrate our 25th anniversary.  The Jurys Inn was exactly where we wanted to be. It was a short walk from the airport shuttle, close to pubs and prime sights.  The hotel was clean, efficient and convenient.",4,2015,07,02
231,I highly recommend this hotel for women travelling alone,"I had a wonderful experience at this hotel. I stayed 5 nights. I was in Dublin for a business conference and took a couple extra days for sightseeing. This was my first trip to Europe on my own, and I checked several hotels on Trip Advisor. My first choice was booked up, so I stayed at Jury's, and I highly recommend it. I booked through Expedia.com and was a little nervous about what to expect. 
The lobby was nicely appointed, very modern and clean, with plenty of places to sit, a coffee /espresso machine, and a vending machine for cold drinks. Bottled water was available at the front desk for just 1 euro.The hotel staff was extremely courteous, the room was very clean and more spacious than other hotel rooms I've had in Europe, and the bar and restaurant served excellent fare at reasonable prices. My flight arrived in the morning, and check-in was at 2:00 PM (an hour earlier than most US hotels) and the staff offered to store my suitcases at no charge until check-in. 
As a woman travelling alone, safety and theft were major concerns of mine, but security was excellent throughout the hotel. I even forgot my laptop in the bar once, and they called my cell phone to alert me, storing it at the front desk until I returned from my tour to retrieve it. 
The location is a very short walk to bus tours, museums, shopping, and restaurants. I even walked back from dinner alone after dark several times and felt completely safe. 
I met a friend for the first day and my room had a double and a twin bed. It was the perfect combination for two single people. 
The housekeeping staff was very courteous and completely changed the bed linens and duvets, plus completely changed out the towels every day! Most hotels in the U.S. won't do that anymore unless one specifically requests it. The toiletries provided were liquid body wash and shampoo/conditioner in large pump bottles mounted in the shower. If you want bar soap, bring your own. It didn't bother me, but my companion was a little disappointed that there was no bar soap and that the shampoo and conditioner were combined.  A hair dryer, ironing board, and iron were provided. 
The only negative was the view from the room, but I wasn't paying for a view. I imagine that's why the room was on Expedia.",5,2015,07,02
231,"Great location,very helpful staff.",Room nice and clean but no bath mat Mum 84 so had to put towel in to shower. Mattress very hard. Food very good breakfast staff at reception were great knowledgeable about the local area cheerful and kind.,4,2015,07,02
231,"Very Central, good room, very good value","I stayed here recently, as the person with me went to their meeting I went shopping very close to Henry Street, O'Connell Street and just across the river from the Templebar area, It was a lovely sunny day so more conducive to sightseeing by walking rather than shopping...Hotel was easy to drop back to anytime within a short distance of dropping off accumulated shopping bags....Staff courteous and friendly.  Excellent stay",4,2015,07,02
231,Great location,"Lovely spacious room in great location, within walking distance to all sights.  Close to supermarkets.  Hotel was quiet and we requested a quiet room, which was at the back of the hotel overlooking a courtyard.  Highly recommended.",5,2015,07,02
231,Great service and location,"Stayed for a week at this magnificient hotel.  The staff were great, especially Jose, anything we needed he was willing to help.  He was always smiling and gave us some tips.  Thank you Jose for the great week we spent in Dublin, hope to see you very soon.

The location of the hotel was great as well.  45 minute walking distance from most of the big attractions (Guinness, Jameson).  Don't forget to experience the night life in the Temple Bar area and take the pedal tok-tok home, man do they know how to get around in the busy traffic of the Dublin city center streets.

231,Comfortable and Close to the City Centre,We stayed here two days and it was a nice hotel with a breakfast.  We used the hop on hop off as transportation for our site seeing which was only a couple blocks away.  The breakfast was ok in a buffet style.  They had discounted parking a couple of blocks away.  Wifi was free and adequate.  There are no safes in the room but you can use one on the main floor.,4,2015,07,02
231,A very comfortable hotel in a good location,"This is a very nice hotel.   Dublin hotels are not cheap but restassure it was good value.  This weekend the European soccer qualifier game between the Irish and Scottish teams was taking place so there were a of lads in skirts in town.  They party and drink hard and we felt the hotel was well prepared and ensured that no guests were disturbed.   it was a great weekend all round.  The breakfast was very good and the staff helpful and attentive.  The room was spacious and very comfortable, although we would have liked tea and coffee facilities, a bar fridge and safe in the room.  It's located a 10 minute walk to Temple Bar.",4,2015,06,30
231,City centre hotel,Close to city centre but in a quiet side street. Staff were helpful. Plenty of choice at breakfast. Found the room was rather warm at night. Ideal location for shopping and public transport access. A pleasant stay on the whole,4,2015,06,30
231,Just a short walk away from Henry street,"The hotel was located on Parnell Street, just a short walk away from Henry Street with all the shopping you might want. The breakfastbuffet was really good, with everything needed for a traditional irish breakfast. The only complaint I would have is that the staff seemed more ""superior"" than actually friendly. Overall the visit was very enjoyable and I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin. ",4,2015,06,29
231,Good Location,"This was our first visit to Dublin. The hotel is very convenient if using the 747 Airlink coach from the airport as it stops just around the corner and is only a 5 minute (if that) walk to the hotel. Check-in was quick and efficient and the staff were very welcoming. Security is good as you have to use your room key-card to call the lift and also to select the floor that you want. The carpet throughout was a little bit drab (grey), but the room was a good size and was kept very clean & tidy. Breakfast is help-yourself and can be anything from cereals to a full Irish breakfast. Gluten-free bread is available on request for coeliacs. Walking down O'Connell Street to the River Liffey is about 10 minutes (if you do not stop) and another 5-10 minutes gets you to the Temple Bar area. No shortage of places to eat & drink within a reasonable distance. One quibble - the hair shampoo and wash gels are in bottles that are firmly secured to the wall in the bathroom about three feet above the floor level, which is fine if having a shower, but if having a bath one cannot reach the gels.",4,2015,06,29
231,great location,"very central location ,lovely hotel,very friendly and helpful staff.great breakfast.would definitely stay here again and also recommend it . best was location,no negative comments.left luggage before check in as room was not ready and also left luggage on check out as we did some sight seeing.

231,Excellent location,Hotel well placed for Dublin sights. Just off the top of O Connell Street short walk from bus stops for 757 express bus from Dublin Airport and the open top sightseeing buses. Tesco Metro over the road shops and cinema couple of minutes walk away. Room excellent everything you needed.,4,2015,06,28
231,Good Location,"Once we got our bearings, we found that this was a pretty good location for getting around Dublin. We could walk to some places or the bus was just a couple of blocks away. Staff were pleasant and helpful, room was clean and beds were pretty comfy.",4,2015,06,27
231,City break,"Love this hotel, can't fault anything. Rooms are lovely and modern, always clean with towels changed daily. Excellent location for exploring the local city, stumbling distance from temple row! Breakfast is best hotel breakfast we have ever had by far. Been here twice and will be back.",5,2015,06,27
231,"Nice hotel, but could get the same, cheaper elsewhere","Stayed here for one night as we were going to see a play at Abbey theatre whilst in Dublin. It was clean, staff were nice, but i wouldn't say it was anything special! (Had stayed for two nights in premier inn before hand, only changed hotel to be in city centre, would stay in the premier inn for whole time next time) breakfast had a lot of choices, but for being a hotel in one of the busiest cities in ireland, the chef should learn to cook black and white pudding properly!",4,2015,06,27
231,One shade of grey,"My over-riding impression of this Jury's hotel is one of gloom. The reception desk is set in near darkness at the end of the gloomy lobby, the corridors present a tone of uniform dullness and the restaurant presents a monotone in grey. Despite being on the second floor, the architect has contrived to make it seem subterranean. Breakfast is adequate but dull, and is the ultimate in self-service. The staff clear tables, nothing else. No welcoming cup of coffee or tea - you have to find it for yourself and when it came to de caffeinated  coffee, I thought it was hide-and-seek. I ended up having tea - I couldn't find it. The bedrooms are plain - and yes, mine had grey curtains. This is all soulless stuff. With a bit of imagination someone could add colour and vibrancy to the decor. Get some flamboyant art works. Anyway, if you are thinking of staying at this average hotel, ask for a room away from the front aspect (odd numbered rooms) then you'll avoid the interrupted sleep I suffered from the noisy Dublin street life below.",3,2015,06,26
231,"Great Location, Great Hotel","Just returned from 3 night stay in Dublin staying at this hotel. Great hotel, modern, clean, lovely staff , great breakfast, comfy beds. Arrived too early for check in, but no problem to leave our bags which are safely locked away whilst you go off and enjoy the day  and its the same at checkout which is  already a great time of 12 noon. Tea making facilities, and an iron  were a bonus. No book of "" house rules "" in the room which seemed odd . Dublin is a great vibrant city with lovely people. All in all a fab stay.",5,2015,06,26

I couldn't have been happier.

231,First time out of the UK,"I visited Ireland to see The Script play their home city, as I was late booking that, Jury's Inn was about the only hotel I could find near to Croke Park (about 15 minutes, if you don't get lost) 
I'd stayed in a Jury's Inn in England previous to this and the standards are just as high. Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff, arriving early they let us check out bags in to storage and buy breakfast as nowhere else was open. 
We were told they may have a room for us at 10am but if not then it'll be 12pm, which was fine. We had breakfast and went to walk around the area. We came back at 10am to be told our room was not ready, but they could transfer us to another one.
I also had made two sepearate reservations so they allowed us into the same room for both days, I just had to re-check in the following morning. Upon re-check we were asked if we'd like our room serviced. As we were hardly in the previous day we'd said no, it'll be fine until we've left. Yet, they still cleaned the room anyway which was a nice touch :)
Upon leaving we used the quick checkout option, by leaving the key in the box if you've prepaid. The man who was greeting guests into the hotel was very helpful and always cheery, he also allowed us to store our cases after checkout time until we had to head back to travel home.

I will definitely return again, and would recommend this to anyone visiting Ireland. It's central to most of the attractions in Ireland, and if you're unsure where to go the staff are very knowledgeable in how to get to places :)

If you're also wishing to eat out but don't want the expense of Dublin there's a fish and chip restaurant across the road which do nice meals (including roast dinner, pies, soups- not just fish and chips) which are around 8 euros",5,2015,06,23

Shocking and rude rude staff!!,3,2015,06,22
231,The Staff are amazing!,"From start to finish we had a brilliant stay in Jurys Inn! The staff go above and beyond for all customers and this is what made our stay here so enjoyable, they were amazing!!! the location is less then 3 mins away from Henry Street, so prefect for shopping. its roughly 10 mins from Croke Park.",5,2015,06,22
231,Best place to stop near Dublin city centre,"I've stopped in numerous Hotels and B&B's in Dublin and Jury's Inn on Parnell Street is definitely the best for me. For what you get in the price is a bargain; the rooms are kept impeccable by the maids, all the staff are amazingly friendly, the breakfast buffet is the best about as there's too much food to chose from and if you like your coffee ask for José as he makes the best Cappuccino in the world!!!",5,2015,06,21
231,Great hotel breakfast terrible,Just returned from a visit to Jurys inn. The location is exellent clean comfortable rooms as for the breakfast forget it! The cooked food was freezing cold I felt that the least the staff could do was set the tables for breakfast. Had to get your cutlery cups tea and toast this is not good enough service for the cost of bed & breakfast. You would expect this in a hostel but not in a 3 star hotel. I would think about returning to jurys on a room only basis!,3,2015,06,19
231,Great Location,"The hotel is in a good central location, just off the top of O'Connell St in Dublin City center, close to the main shopping areas and not too far from Temple Bar. 

There is no parking at the hotel, however we were able to park at Cleary's Q-Park for €10 for 24 hours which is about a 5-10 minute walk away. (However just to note this car park may no longer be available as the Cleary's store has since closed I believe). 

We checked in and out very smoothly, the receptionist staff were very nice and polite, even thought it was a bank-holiday weekend and they were very busy. 

We stayed in a triple room for one night. The room was nice, the beds were very comfortable and the shower was good. The room was clean and well kept. The bathroom could have been a bit cleaner, then end of the bath was quiet dusty but nothing to worry about. 

There was no room service available when we asked (However perhaps we were just late asking and it maybe available earlier - we asked around 12am after returning from an event). Breakfast was available for €10 per person I believe, however we did not eat in the hotel. 

Overall the hotel is a good choice; nothing spectacular but we had no complaints either, it was everything you would expect from a hotel. The hotel is in a great location, and the price was good for the bank holiday weekend. We would stay there again and would recommend this hotel to others.",4,2015,06,19
231,following England away,"We stayed here last weekend for the football. We arrived on the Saturday night and left on the Monday morning. I want to firstly express my thanks to the staff who were attentive, polite and helpful and always seemed to have a smile on their face ( which is more than we had, after that match!
The rooms are modern and cleaned well. The hotel is an ideal base to get into Dublin City Centre. The breakfast was good , but could be better with the addition of better toasters ( that really is the only reason i havent given an excellent review). The bar was also a plus on the Sunday night because it was reasonably priced compared to the rest of the city and we could at least get a drink after 10.30 pm.
This is definately the only hotel i would stay at in Dublin....one last mention is directly oppposite is a tesco that you can get any essentials you need.
Thanks for the hospitality",4,2015,06,19

231,Not one to complain....BUT....,"I stayed at this property for 1 night. On arrival, it was pretty late, around 11:30, as I waited to be checked in, the guy at the desk didn't acknowledge me, and when he did look up, he sort of nodded for me to step forward. Being a receptionist myself I found it a bit off putting to say the least, but I did try to empathize. He rarely made any eye contact, which I know is important in this line of work, but again, I am not making it a big deal. 
The room itself was very comfortable, especially the bed. No complaints there. 
In the morning however, when I phoned down to reception, it was the same guy who checked me in. He did not greet me, as in, ""Good morning, how may I be of assistance.."" etc. I wanted to ask for the cost for an additional night, but he interrupted me giving information I did not ask for. When I finally got a chance to ask my question, he said he would check. He did not place me on hold, because I heard him speaking to other colleagues so I could basically hear his full conversations before he came back on the line.
Another issue I had was the hot water in the room, the water in the sink was pretty hot but in the shower in was very lukewarm. 

All in all, as a professional in the hospitality industry, I feel that guy at reception just needed that much more training in interacting with guests and work on his customer service skills.

This hotel is in a great location and the value for the room was worth it. I wouldn't stay here anytime soon, but I would recommend it in the future.",3,2015,06,17
231,Trustworthy,"I've stayed here on a couple of my previous trips to Dublin so when returning again this was the obvious choice for booking. 

The hotel is located centrally at the top of O'Connell Street; a short walk from the river and the famous Temple Bar. It's away from most of the hussle-bussle of the city so noise isn't an issue.

I had emailed in advance of arrival to make payment so check in took nothing more than a few seconds before I was in the lift to my room; the staff were very pleasant.

The hotel accommodated a small package that was left behind reception for me earlier in the day which was much appreciated and gave it to me when checking in.

I had booked a twin room; the room was huge, as was the bathroom, very pleasing. The bed was very comfortable and the room maintained well throughout my three night stay.

231,Good for tourism,"This hotel is well located, newly constructed and clean. I was there for a three night business trip. My sense was that it is most suitable for tourist groups (that were there in large numbers). It is fine for a quick, inexpensive business visit but a bit ""Spartan"" and does not compare with the typical international business hotel chains. The wi-fi was good but a bit slow with data uploads. The location is great and close to the heart of Dublin action.

231,Business travel to Dublin,"Jury's Inn Parnell Street is located in Dublin city centre very close to O'Connell Street and at walking distance from all the city centre point of interests.
Rooms are large and clean. The restaurant is good and offer a rich menu. I should say that the restaurant improved a lot over the past years in terms of quality and choices.
Breakfast is also very good however there's a missing choice that is the ""espresso"". You can get black coffee or tea as part of the breakfast, but the espresso is not available unless you go to the bar and pay an extra for it. 
Jury's Inn Parnell street is a good choice if you need a place to stay in Dublin city centre.",5,2015,06,15
231,Nice option for Dublin,"My family of three stayed at the Jury's Inn on Parnell for 2 nights. We paid for a ""Superior Suite"" which gave us early check-in (noon) on arrival and late check-out (2 pm) on the departure day. It also included several bottles of water and a couple packets of biscuits each day.

We arrived at the hotel around 12:30. The room that had been pre-selected for us hadn't been cleaned yet, so the very friendly and gracious desk agent immediately switched us to another room that was available so we didn't have to wait in the lobby. A member of the staff brought the water and treats to us a short time after we got to the room.

Overall, we were very happy with the room and the hotel. The room was small, but still large enough to move around the one double and one twin bed. The beds, linens, and pillows were very comfortable. The shower had good water pressure and there was plenty of hot water. (Note: Soap and shampoo were provided, but via large dispensers, not individual bottles, so be sure to bring your own toiletries if you don't like to share :-) The wifi was sufficient for checking e-mails and Facebook; it was not strong enough for a good connection to Skype.

Our room was located on the 4th floor overlooking the ""courtyard"" - even with the window open, we heard virtually no street noise, which was amazing considering how busy Parnell and O'Connell Street are at all times of the day.

Every member of the staff that we met was very friendly and accomodating. The gentleman we dealt with on the morning of our departure was especially nice and was helpful in getting our luggage stowed in a secure storage room. They held on to it throughout the day so we didn't have to lug it around town with us. (FYI: They put numbered tags on each piece of luggage that is stored and verify that you are the owner when you come back to claim it.)

We had a nice stay at the Jury Inn on Parnell. We would definitely consider staying there again and would recommend it to family and friends.

Here are a couple things that potential hotel guests might want to consider before booking a room:

The hotel is within easy walking distance of the main tourist areas on the south side of the Liffey. It takes about 10-15 minutes to reach Temple Bar and Trinity. It takes about the same amount of time to walk to the main bus station.

The area around the hotel is not the greatest. My family and I didn't feel unsafe or threatened, but there were a lot of homeless people in the area sitting on the sidewalks and panhandling. Whenever we went in and out of the hotel, we noticed that there was a ""bouncer"" standing guard in the lobby. (Note: In order to get to your floor, you have to insert your door key in the slot to activate the elevator, so this minimizes the potential of non-guests getting into areas they are not supposed to be in.)

There is a Tesco right across the street from the hotel. It was very convenient for grabbing water and snacks. (We did not eat at either the hotel's restaurant or the bar, so I can not vouch for the quality of the food or the service.)  

The AirCoach and AirLink bus stops are just around the corner from the hotel, so it was very easy to get to/from the airport. There are also dozens of busses running up and down O'Connell and the Luas train is just a couple blocks south of the hotel, so it is easy to get to all of the main tourist sites too.",4,2015,06,14
231,5 nights at Jury's on Parnell,"Clean, friendly and economical for 
Dublin. We always stay there as the location is central to everything. Rooms a little tired but comfy beds and staff at beck and call. Food in the bar area always good. Grocery stores, pharmacy and mall across the street. Always helpful when traveling with children. The kids loved it

231,Value for money ,"Stayed here for 2 nights for our wedding anniversary. Arrived at 10 am after an early flight, receptionist extremely helpful & was able to check in early. Had a superior room, very spacious, comfy but small double, tea/coffee/biscuits & water delivered to room. Breakfast was good, a little confusing as very spread out, but value for money. Good central hotel, close to shops & around 10 min walk to Temple Bar area. Aircoach bus stop literally 5 mins around the corner. Would def recommend. ",4,2015,06,13
231,Excellent stay,"We have just returned from Dublin staying at the Durys Inn Parnell St. The staff are very helpful and friendly, the hotel is very clean. Its in a good location and you can get the bus to airport in the street around the corner on O'Connell St.",5,2015,06,13
231,Goodnight,"This is a good hotel in a good location,airport bus stops nearby in O'Connell street,the breakfast will keep the average human being going most of the day,tea&kettle in the room with free wifi.The staff are very friendly and helpful,good rates as well.",4,2015,06,12
231,Disappointing,"Bad neighborhood, cheap, charge 2:10 Euros for nuts, bar doesn't make mixed drinks but has bottles showing, a surly person off the street got up to 4th floor unchallenged and threatened to kill me when I didn't know where she wanted to go. No food offered in evening. Would never stay here again",1,2015,06,12
231,Great Hotel,"We spent two  nights in Jury's the first and the last.  This hotel is secure, modern , in a good locations. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable, especially Sherry the hostess in the restaurant the cute little blond with the braces ,I think that is her name , She is a very pleasant person and a great asset to your hotel. She made staying there a lot better. Thank You.",5,2015,06,12
231,Weekend break,"Arrived early in the morning and deposited our luggage at hotel reception which was fairly busy but we were quickly attended to. This enabled us to explore the city without the hindrence of a weekend bag. Returning to the hotel and checking into the room some six hours later, having made the most of our day despite the wet weather. The room was very clean tidy and new looking as expected with the facilities as described see our ratings. We ate in the pub next door the first evening choosing traditional Irish fare. The food within the hotel was sampled the next day where we found the breakfast most enjoyable self service with plenty of choice, dinner that evening was good value and the service staff helpful and attentive, so much so that the tip was well earned. We ate in the restaurant, but food was also available within the Bar, not used by us on this occasion. I would definitely recommend to my friends.",4,2015,06,11
231,Very Good Hotel,"Very good comfortable hotel with friendly staff. Rooms very clean and an excellent selection at breakfast. Handy hotel on Parnell Street for a visit to Dublin City Centre. Highly recommended for a visit to Ireland
      ",4,2015,06,11
231,Good stay,"Jury's have always had a good reputation and after my first stay in one I can only agree with the positive feedback I have had from friends. This is a busy hotel it's 2 mins from O'Connell st but the check in was smooth, the staff were superb. The rooms were a very good standard and a huge bathroom. Bar and restaurant were great I had a very nice steak and the breakfast was very good lots of choice I did love the sausages, again the staff were superb. All in all a great stay and I personally would recommend this hotel to anyone.",4,2015,06,11
231,Good location,"We spent our last two nights in Ireland here before flying home. The hotel was very modern. The staff were very helpful. Upon arrival, we were given bottles of water, cookies and coupons for free Costa coffee, free drinks in the bar and a discount on food. Christchurch was directly across the street and Dublinia also. St. Patrick Cathedral was round the corner. Walking distance to the Temple Bar area, Dublin Castle and several parks. They had a cab waiting for us in the morning to take us to the airport.",5,2015,06,10
231,Super jury's,I just love staying in Jury's hotels they are all friendly and clean and great value for money. I've stayed in this one on a few occasions and I'm always happy with the service you get. I would advise any of my friends to use jury's whenever possible,5,2015,06,10
231,Location excellent,"I love this hotel, I love fancy hotels and glam suites when I go away but this hotel is situated in such a great location that it makes us come back,the ilac center is next door, restraunts everywhere and oconnell street is beside you, it's also very clean and has everything you need, the staff, the food, everything is great... Can't wait to go again with the kids",5,2015,06,10
231,It's all about the location,"First off, though I only gave it 3 stars, I would stay at this hotel again. I was with my husband and 2 kids and the room was extremely small. The bed was uncomfortable, but not nearly as bad as the pull out sofa the kids slept on. It was clean, but rundown. 

The location, however, was amazing. Only a block from O'Connell Street and Henry Street. 10 minutes walk from the Temple Bar area. Lots to see and do within walking distance. 

The staff was very friendly and helpful. I didn't have the breakfast. 

The hotel was a great value for its location. I only wish the beds had been more comfortable and the rooms had been bigger.",3,2015,06,09
231,Another great stay in Dublin.,"A good base near to all the tourist attractions.  
Very comfortable bed.  Good breakfast to set you up for the day - plenty of choice both hot and cold. 
Ate in the bar four nights out of five - food good and drinks not over priced for a hotel.",4,2015,06,09
231,Fantastic weekend & gorgeous hotel,"We stayed at the Jury's Inn Hotel during a weekend away, great location about 10 minutes (walk) away from Temple bar, taxis on a night were good value! Would definitely recommend, this will be our choice of hotel each year now 
Fantastic weekend!",5,2015,06,09
231,Excellent,"We spent 3 nights there. It was very nice stay. Rooms are clean and comfy, nicely decorated. Hotel is almost in the city center, so you can walk everywhere. Hotel staff is very friendly and proffessional.
      
      
      ",5,2015,06,08
231,Great location for sure,"Staying in Dublin for 2 days whilst on business trip. I suppose its all about location - close to all amenities. Nothing amazing, but then I suppose you can't really find any faults either. Rooms are modern and comfortable, staff helpful. but as I said - its about the location.",5,2015,06,08
231,Not bad but not amazing for the price,"Stayed four nights was a nice place but the room wasn't much better than a travel lodge if I'm honest, the breakfast was one of the best things and obviously the location is great, the staff were very helpful throughout our stay, the prices were pretty high seeing there wasn't much included in this, ",3,2015,06,08
231,Too costly for the room,"We booked a room here after our tour of Italy for one night. The room was clean and pretty.  Negatives were: no air conditioning (desk fan and window were the only air), bathroom door was HEAVY...don't know how weak people open it, no view from our window except of garbage, and could hear neighbors, and breakfast was not included (10 euros per extra)....we paid over 200 $$ for one night!",2,2015,06,08
231,"Good location, clean hotel ","Stayed here with friends for the weekend. The hotel is in a good location just off O'Connell street, about 10-15 mins walk to temple bar. Hotel is clean & quiet. Only had 2 issues with the hotel 1. The shower curtain smelt 2. And this is personal preference, the pillows were really hard. It would have been great to have the option of a hard & a soft on offer. I would stay again. 
",4,2015,06,08
231,440 is the go,We arrived well into the afternoon pretty tired and the room we were given was not what we had expected (facing into the courtyard and below our expectations). We approached the reception staff and some tooing and frowing  got us room 440.It had 3 large windows on the south side high up with views. It was fine.One problem is with this hotel being so large it is a long walk from room 440 to the lift. There is no parking at the hotel if you have a car as well. But they do have an arrangement with a parking station about 5 minutes walk away for 10 euros($15) a night.Staff were helpful and breakfast was good.,4,2015,06,05
231,"Good location, clean and modern","2 night stay for 3 people. Room clean and fine for space.
Price Ok for location.
Nothing extra special about the hotel but a good base for sightseeing.
First time in a Jurys Inn. Stayed night before in a premier inn for a third of the cost and didn't feel there was much difference in room standard but you are paying for location.",4,2015,06,04
231,Holidays,Stayed 2 nights in Dublin. Very nice motel very good location. Staff always helpful and good breakfast and evening meals. If you coming to Dublin this motel will suit you. And even though we were on the side of the main road you don't hear a thing as the windows are triple glazed. Just great. ,4,2015,06,04
231,Enjoyable stay,"We had  an excellent stay at Jury's. The staff are excellent and friendly. The concierge is exceptional, very welcoming and genuinely wants to make a difference.
The rooms facilities were very good, we had very comfortable beds and the room faced into the internal courtyard ensuring an excellent and quiet sleep, the only minor negative was at the buffet breakfast when staff couldn't replenish food and cutlery quick enough at busy times. The buffet breakfast although pricey at 10 Euros is good value as there is plenty of variety and fills you for the day. Being close to O'Connell street makes the hotel very handy the airport bus stops and for catching the  local bus or tram across the city to the tourist spots.",5,2015,06,02
231,Excellent city centre location ideal for all kinds of travellers,"Nice chain hotel near to all amenities could get a bit noisy at night outside but ideal for nightlife , shops and sightseeing. The room was immaculate and the beds comfy. Didnt have breakfast so cant comment. Staff very helpful.",4,2015,06,02
231,Good stay in Dublin,"Started and ended our trip to Ireland at this hotel.  Good location, 
staff very helpful, restaurant above average and rooms very clean and quite.  We got there before 2pm on arrival to Dublin from US and not long before we arrived they made our room available",4,2015,06,01
231,excellent hotel in an excellent location,"we stayed for 4 nights on a short family break. couldnt fault the hotel for value for money, service or accommodation. great location for all tourist attractions, buses and city centre shopping. staff were friendly, hotel was very clean and in good decorative order. buffet style breakfast was excellent and good value for money.",5,2015,06,01
231,Short Break,"Very clean and modern hotel, friendly staff.  Location is close to main amenities and lively Temple Bar.  Room was a bit noisy during night with revellers banging doors etc.  Room was at rear of hotel and also suffered from noise of bins being emptied at an adjacent property.
      ",3,2015,06,01
231,Decent family hotel,"Nice clean hotel, just outside the hustle and bustle of the heart of Dublin but within easy walking distance of all the attractions.
Suitable for families who don't want to be in the midst of the city centre.  ",4,2015,06,01
231,Very nice corporate type hotel,"Everything clean and efficient, staff nice and breakfast terrific.  What you would want and expect from this type of hotel.  The location in Dublin is very convenient.  Subsidised parking in a reasonably close multi-storey.
      
      ",4,2015,06,01
231,Close to town for the price,"Stayed here for Foo Fighters concert in April 2015. We booked 3 rooms, all were of varying sizes. Rooms not very well insulated, could hear people talking in adjoining rooms and in the hallway all through the night. The bar prices are quite expensive (€2.95 for a small coke, €5.10 for a beer). The kingfisher restaurant across the road has nice breakfast till 12 for decent prices. 
In a nutshell....Not the flashest of hotels, but close to town for the price.",3,2015,06,01
231,Pleasant Enough,"Spent a pleasant stay here on business.Nice bar located on the 1st floor. Room was clean, spacious and quiet. Friendly staff with free basic wifi, so all you need really.

We were given a very clean room with a comfortable bed from a very friendly staff who were very accommodating.
Walking distance to all the main attraction Dublin's city center has to offer.
We stayed here on a recommendation from a friend and will now be definitely recommending it to others. ",4,2015,05,29
231,Dublin Stay,"Nice place to stay, the internet is great quality if you are in IT and love that sort of thing.  The room is nice and warm and clean as well as quiet.  The staff helpful.  It is weird that you need to put your key card in twice to get up the elevator.",4,2015,05,29
231,Great location in Dublin,"Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights pre and one post a tour of Ireland. What a great location close to shopping, attractions and just around the corner from the Airlink Airport bus stop.

Would definitely recommend this hotel and will return again if I ever get the chance.",5,2015,05,29

231,A good hotel in a great location,"Nice clean room with a double and a single bed.  No real view from the window, but the room was comfortable and the area felt lively and close everything you'd want but safe.  There is a lovely bar (which we didn't try, because there are so many other great options nearby) and a small gym (which we didn't try - too much else to see and do!) but a good place to stay.  There wasn't much atmosphere, there was some noise from the corridor and other rooms at times and it seemed a shade expensive for what it was, but the staff were helpful and very friendly, which is always nice.  We'd stay again.",4,2015,05,27
231,A good nights sleep,"This hotel is clean and modern with great beds and good controls for room temperature.  Great location for walking around Central Dublin. It does not have a lot of Irish flavor - but most larger hotels don't.  Good value.

231,A visit we are definitely going to repeat again.,"2nd visit,each time sharing our joy at being in Dublin with different friends,already got another couple who want to come in 2016. The location is so good to visit O'Connell Street and various bars and restaurants,buying a two or three day hop on bus ticket allows a tour to see whats around and numerous trips to your visiting choice. Maddigans Bar a MUST.
      ",5,2015,05,27
231,Very central hotel in Dublin,"Jurys Inn Parnell street is in the middle of everywhere! The location is perfect and the staff  were lovely and welcoming.  You can walk to the Dublin Writers Museum,  National Gallery, Temple  Bar area, Henry Street, Trinity College (just to name a few local attractions) as well as use the €3.30 bus to and from the airport.
The hotel offers good value for money and although we arrived early,  we were greeted and checked in with a smile. E had a room on the 4th floor and WiFi worked well in the rooms. The fitness centre is adequate, albeit a bit small and the equipment is rather dated. 
Food in Dublin city centre is expensive and everything is offered with chips. I was most amused when told, at the Chinese restaurant,  that they only offered chips, not noodles! And if you love to shop,  there are plenty of malls around Jurys Inn.
Put on  your walking shoes and enjoy this interesting city! I loved it",4,2015,05,27
231,Very enjoyable stay.,Our stay was very enjoyable and the room was designed very well. The room was very spacious and very comfortable with a lovely view looking onto Parnell Street. The bed was very comfortable and we throughly enjoyed our stay and there is nothing we'd like changed,5,2015,05,27
231,"Reasonable hotel, OK location","Stayed in Jury's Inn for a few days in May 2015.  The hotel is a bit basic for the price, but it was very clean and the staff were all friendly and helpful.  The room was comfortable and quiet.  Breakfast is a buffet, with a reasonable range of choice, but the cooked food was not great.  We ate in the restaurant a couple of times and it was great one night (salmon) and not so good the other (lamb chop).  In terms of location, it's close to some of the main shopping and to the tour bus stops and a ten minute walk to the Liffey, but the area itself isn't the best area in Dublin.  On balance I would probably look elsewhere for next time, mostly because of the area.",4,2015,05,27
231,Convenient location and friendly staff,"Nice clean room with double and single bed on top floor Window facing the Inner courtyard.very quite hotel, no street noice.helpful staff especially housekeeping and the consierge were helpful.nice location near High street shopping and short walk to the Liffey and temple bar.Breakfast good standard.",5,2015,05,26
231,"Good Staff, friendly and helpful","The first room I had was enormous but had a connecting door so that I could hear the people easily.  also the bed was in need of change. I told reception but the hotel was full that night so she said come back next morning.  I did so, and at the third attempt a new room was found.  It was on the 5th floor, had a walk in shower and a wonderfully comfortable bed.  On this floor the rooms are smaller but fine. The shower was a drench one. Soap, shampoo and shower gel are in dispensers. Recommend you bring your own. Towels are a decent size.  Breakfast was buffet style but fairly extensive. Good quality ingredients. Drinks and restaurant food was quite expensive. Pleasant bar to sit in on second floor. Staff always willing to be of help.",4,2015,05,26
231,Honeymoon ,"Nice, clean hotel. Room a tad small for a weeks stay but location is perfect! Staff were so helpful with parking and services. Well worth a visit. Park in the 24hr parking 10minutes walk, low on $$. The porridge was very nice. Not too pricey for Dublin. ",3,2015,05,26
231,Very good.,"Stayed in this hotel for two nights. The hotel is nice and peaceful. There is a gym available in the premises.The breakfast was average,couldve been better. Hotel room nice and cosy, the bed was unbelieveably comfortable and had a good nights sleep. The staff are also very well mannered and friendly. The only dissapointing this is it couldve been abit cheaper. Other than that highly recommend.",3,2015,05,26
231,Good central hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights during the bank holiday weekend. 

The hotel was clean, modern and had everything you needed for a small city break. The hotel felt very secure with several card access doors and the same security even applied to the lift.

The breakfasts were reasonably priced and had everything you would expect from a buffet

The hotel is in a very central location. Only a few minutes walk from the Temple Bar area or main shopping street. The Jameson's experience is around 15minutes walk and the Guinness experience approx 45minutes, or around €10-15 in a taxi.

Would return",4,2015,05,26
231,"Great hotel, close to everything","I stay here every time I come to Dublin. It's situated a few minutes away from O'Connell street. Close to places to eat, the Ilac shopping centre, Moore street and supermarkets.

They have an ice machine on every floor, which I love. You don't have to be drinking warm drinks all the time.

The bar is quite small but nice. They don't have a huge selection of food. It would be great for some people, but there isn't a dish I like on the menu. It's pro eye like any other bar menu.

The rooms are simple. You can get a lucky dip each time you stay. My last stay, 3 of the channels had no sound and one was frozen. But they fixed the ones with no sound. The lock on the bathroom door didn't work. We told them about it and they fixed it within minutes.

All the staff are nice and polite.",4,2015,05,26

      ",4,2015,05,25
231,Great Place; Traffic and Parking Not Great,"We enjoyed the location of this hotel for our ability to walk to pubs, Guinness and Jameson.  There was also good shopping nearby, including a daily fruit market right by the hotel.  The Liffey River was only 3 blocks away.  We felt safe walking anywhere near the hotel.  We enjoyed our Romanian bartender both nights we were there.  The facility was spiffy and clean.  The men's room by the bar and restaurant was by far the best-smelling restroom I have ever experienced (admittedly a weird comment, but I couldn't ignore it).  Parking is an issue, as the parking ramp affiliated with the hotel is 5 blocks away. The walk was okay, but not terribly convenient.  Do NOT park in the crappy little ramp behind the hotel.  It is amazingly small and quite difficult to drive out of.  Traffic in the area was challenging due to construction.  Despite the traffic and parking issues, we loved this hotel.  The facility was wonderful and the staff was extremely friendly and welcoming.",5,2015,05,25
231,Breakfast!Not a great start to the day!,"This is a very good hotel with friendly and helpful staff, however! The breakfast service was not the best way to start the day. I would prefer not to eat my breakfast at the equivalent of a breakfast bar but as all the tables were full it was the only seating option. The restocking of the buffet was extremely slow which meant having to go back as sausages, bacon etc. we're restocked at different, times. To be fair to the staff this was not helped by greedy residents who overfilled their plates and then left uneaten food on their plates. I really can not believe the selfishness of some people!!this was the only negative point, it is a good hotel and I would definitely stay again.",4,2015,05,24
231,Great 2 day stay,"Stayed here for the first two nights of a ten day Ireland trip. Perfect location, close enough to walk to the hop on hop off bus but enough off the main street to be quiet at night. Comfortable and clean rooms, front desk people were absolutely fantastic as we arrived at 7:30 AM and they tagged and locked up our luggage for us so we could explore the city until our room was available. Not a single complaint with this hotel or the staff.",5,2015,05,24
231,Great New Year In Dublin,"We went to Dublin for 4 Nights including New Years Eve 
turned out to be a very nice hotel the food was suburb and was so close to the major attractions,
Definitely worth staying here and having the breakfast (all you can eat)
Great for New Year",5,2015,05,24
231,Good stay,"We enjoyed a very pleasant 2 night stay. Very efficient helpful reception staff, nice room, no issues with it. The breakfasts were typical chain hotel buffets, I've had much worse but also had better.  
Good location, just off O' Connell street, and they kept our luggage all day on checkout day at no cost and securely.
A good stay and I would certainly consider staying again when returning to Dublin.",4,2015,05,22
231,Perfect for a few nights in Dublin,"The hotel was perfect for my short stay. Not a single complaint. The location was excellent - just off O'Connell Street and very near the AirCoach stop (3 minute walk) which was handy for getting to the airport. I arrived around 11am expecting to leave my bags with them before check-in, but the receptionist said my room was available which was great. I don't expect they can do this with everyone and I probably got lucky, but a positive nonetheless. The room was spotlessly clean, well furnished and the bed was really comfy. Lots of towels, shampoo and soap, as well as tea and coffee making facilities. A very very minor complaint was the view out of the back of the hotel - specifically the back of shops, buildings etc. was a little unpleasant but it didn't bother me. The restaurant was lovely and I had a great, reasonably priced evening meal. I had a great night's sleep - no noise issue etc. although I am a heavy sleeper! The buffet breakfast was delicious and offered a vast selection and I was surprised it was included in my stay - very good value. All the staff I encountered were pleasant and smiley. Overall, I'd highly recommend the hotel as a good base for central Dublin if you're visiting for a few days. Incredible value for money - will definitely be back! ",5,2015,05,22
231,"Great service, great value!","Stayed over the new year, service was fantastic in house restraunt was a bit pricey but the included breakfast was good. Centrally located, clean and comfortable the staff where friendly and welcoming especially given they where working New Years holidays. Would go again and recommend to friends.",5,2015,05,21
231,Good Hotel in a Great Location,"We chose this hotel based on it's location, being near the corner of Parnell Street and O'Connell Street. Our room on the 4th floor was spacious, comfortable and quiet. Had a bar meal one night which was very nice and reasonably priced, and a drink in the bar on a couple of nights. The staff were friendly and helpful. Location is good with a number of sights in reasonable walking distance, and very convenient for the Hop On Hop Off buses which we used extensively (48 hour pass is the best options). Would happily stay here again if we ever come back to Dublin, and would recommend it to others to stay here.",4,2015,05,21
231,Hotel Stay,"Very good and relaxing stay, bedrooms very clean.  Food was very nice and the Bar staff that was on was very friendly.  Would recommend the hotel..   The city center location of the hotel was excellent , not much traveling as it is just of O'Connell's Street.

231,Super location and a very nice hotel,"We spent six nights at the hotel in mid May 2015 and can recommend the hotel. The hotel har a super location close to everything in the center of Dublin. Our room was spacious and comfortable and did have very good beds. And very quiet. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We were suprised, however, that the breakfast was not any better at this fine hotel and we had lovely breakfasts in the pubs close to the hotel. And I also missed international news canals on TV. But all in all the hotel is a perfect place to stay for visit to Dublin.",4,2015,05,21
231,Excellent for Price Point,"We stayed at this hotel four nights total during our trip to Ireland.  Secured an amazing price via an internet site.  The staff were very friendly and helpful - front desk, lobby, restaurant, housekeeping.  We arrived very early in the morning after a long flight from the US and were permitted to check in immediately (bless them, we went right to bed!!).  The room was clean, modern, small yet cozy and there was ample space for all our bags, toiletries, clothing, etc..  Breakfast buffet was divine; nice variety, everything was always fresh and replenished.  Great Irish soda bread, scones and multi grain bread.   Liked the location of the hotel; plenty of conveniences close by plus only a short walk  (for us at least) to the Temple Bar area and other sites.  Felt very safe and secure in this hotel due to their key card access elevators.  Overall, only two negative features.  No washcloths.  I was prepared for this so I brought a few cheap ones from home then just threw them out when I was done as to not have to travel with wet toweling.  Not having washcloths is especially annoying in a hotel that provides only liquid soap, as this one did.  With bar soap, one may be able to manage.... but liquid??  And, although there was an electric kettle and coffee/tea service set up in the room, the coffee offered was instant SANKA which  #1 - I  haven't seen in years (didn't even know they produced it!) and #2 - smells disgusting.  I do not drink coffee but hubby made in every morning  (choking it  down)  and the smell was nauseating.  We ran into instant coffee again  in our room at a B&B in Galway and it wasn't SANKA; hubby reports it tasted a little better but at least I was spared the smell that time!  But I will not focus on these small negatives.  I would  definitely recommend Jurys Inn Parnell Street to anyone traveling to Dublin.",4,2015,05,21
231,Staff fantastic!,"Nothing terribly noteworthy about the property (I would give it three stars) but the staff was so fantastic that I added a whole star for it. Front desk, bar staff, doormen... Perfection!!! Great location and decent price for a room so central. ",4,2015,05,19
231,Gagren ,Great location. Rooms were larger than we  expected. Good breakfast selection. Felt safe and secure. Staff was very helpful. Close to city and tour bus stop. Plenty of places to eat nearby and close to shopping on Henry Street. ,4,2015,05,19
231,Fantastic hotel in Dublin city centre,We had a lovely quiet room as requested. The room rate was very reasonable. The lady that checked us in was welcoming and professional. Our only regret was that we were there for only one night. We will stay there again as we are generally in Dublin a few times a year.,4,2015,05,19
231,Great Location -- Good Staff,"This is an ideal location for walking to the attractions in Dublin.  It is also located close to a Luas stop, which made getting to the Heuston train station a breeze when we day tripped to Kilkenny!  This staff is friendly and were very helpful with out lost luggage situation.  The room was good size, beds decent, nice bathroom, and clean.  We stayed here with out daughter to celebrate her birthday.  Even with three people it was a comfortable room.  We will definitely stay here on any future Dublin visits.",4,2015,05,19

Very good location. Hotel clean and nice. The staff friendly and helpful. The proximity of the shopping center, restaurants and attractions makes it a very good point for the visitors.  I would recommend

231,Nice hotel close to O'connell Street,"Stayed for two nights here, close to the centre just off of O'Connell St. Nice spacious clean room good view over city.
Rate included breakfast which was very comprehensive, seems one of the better hotels at the price and will definitely be staying here again",5,2015,05,19
231,""" Were friends of the family ""","Nothing was too much trouble at Jurys Inn Parnell Street Dublin. Never come across such friendly and helpful staff. They were all good team players.  The hotel is smartly decorated throughout with pleasant rooms and good food in the restaurant and bar. 
The hotel is very central, with about five minutes walk to drop-off tourist buses and the Aircoach, the latter with only two stops to/ from the Airport.
Everything exceeded expectations.",5,2015,05,18
231,very nice efficient hotel in the center,"Everything worked as it should: fast check in and check out; non-smoking room, very clean room and fast internet. The location is excellent.The front desk helped us to print our bus ticket. We were greeted coming and leaving. Very high level of security.",5,2015,05,16
231,Still needs tweaking,"This pertains not to just Jury's.  I have stayed at the Gresham (fair0, Crowne Plaza (inconvenient), Shelbourne (never again) and many other hotels.  I travel extensively.  As I told Jury's before, EVERYhotel I visit in America has a self service coin operated laundry room.  You would make money and increase occupancy if you installed one and advertised this service to Americans.  Just check the laundry queries re Dublin hotels on the internet. ",4,2015,05,15
231,"Good Location, Walk Everywhere",This is a good budget option in center Dublin with easy access to public transport.  Fair weather walking to most attractions is easy.  Good meeting rooms as well as bar and buffet breakfast makes this a good base to explore from.  Relatively quite for Dublin.,4,2015,05,14
231,Just after St Patrick's day,"We booked a cheap mini break just to get away for a weekend and we were amazed at what our money got us with this hotel!!

We stayed for 2 nights from the 18th March and from checkin to checkout all the staff we encountered where so friendly and helpful.

The room was lovely and decorated in a contemporary but modern manner with everything you really need in a hotel room, most importantly a comfortable bed!

The on site bar had a great atmosphere about it with the bar staff happy and chatty giving us lots of tips about the local area, which gave us some direction as to where we should start our adventure.

We would definitely look to rebook this hotel in the future!

231,Staff excellent but Hotel disappoints,"Stayed 10th to 12th in pleasant reasonably sized room with all the expected facilities.Check in was smooth and efficient and throughout our stay the reception staff could not be faulted for their assistance and advice.Evening meal on our first night was a disaster sadly. The menu was fairly limited but despite that we still managed to choose a main course and a side dish that were ""sold out"".We decided on sea bass and chicken as our main courses with the fish being extremely bland and the chicken so salty we only ate half.Vowed never to eat in the hotel again after this experience but due to early morning flight risked breakfast on our last day.Delighted by the selection and quality of the food and again the staff despite being busy were super helpful.Just a final whinge about the lack of hot water for a shower between 8.00 and10.00 on our final night.Whilst we realise a "" boiler breakdown"" is no ones fault perhaps the offer of a free breakfast or similar might pacify an angry guest?",3,2015,05,13
231,This hotel had everything we needed for a quick jaunt to Dublin!,"We were very happy staying at the Jury's Inn Parnell Street.  We arrived around noon after a VERY long flight to Ireland, and were delighted to discover that they had our room ready for us!  Thank you!  The ladies at the front reception desk were very friendly and helpful.

The hotel is just a stone's throw from O'Connell, which is a busy street in Dublin.  We were close to absolutely everything we wanted, with the added convenience of being able to go back to our room and drop off parcels, relax for a bit, and regroup.

There is a grocery store right across the street from the hotel, which was awesome for purchasing snacks, beverages, etc to enjoy in our hotel room.

We didn't get the breakfast plan with our reservation (and truthfully slept in every day) so I can't comment about their breakfasts, although it appeared to be well attended!

The only thing off-putting was the view from our hotel window - we had no view other than into other people's rooms - however ... if you're in Dublin, why look out the window when you can BE HAVING FUN outside!

All in all, a great hotel for us, and thank you for making this such a pleasant stay!",5,2015,05,13
231,Excellent stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights on my first trip to Dublin. Lovely hotel, helpful staff and full buffet breakfast. Very central location. Not too far from the centre of the city but far enough that it is quiet at night. Will definitely be back. Would highly recommend!!!",5,2015,05,13
231,Short break Dublin ,"Stayed 3nights here 6th may, our flight arrived really early and we got to the hotel around 08.30 am , check in was really smooth and efficient , the girl on reception couldn't be more helpful , said our room wasn't quite ready ! Which was amazing as we didn't expect to be able to get in till the afternoon. As we had paid for breakfast we explained we did not think we would be able to have it on our last morning as flight was really early , so she swapped it so we could have it now ! We then explained the next day we had an early start to catch a coach to the north , our breakfast was swapped to a ""pack up ""to take with us ! Our bags were secured securely and we went for breakfast, were the staff were very friendly and polite, to find when we came down ,our room was ready ! And we were able to go in, Our room was clean , large with tea and water, and as we had a upgrade we got bottled water too, the bar staff were lovely and food was good value,. The location was good just around the corner from o'connell street,and just a steady 10 /15minute walk to the temple bar area. I would definitely use again , their approach to people and the way the hotel runs was so refreshing,, and to be able to get in our room so early meant we effectively gained hours on our short break,without the worry of going back to check in! Thanks , excellent customer service in all areas , much appreciated ",5,2015,05,12
231,Mr oneill,"Nice hotel staff very helpful great location. Have stayed here over 20 times. Handy to get around but most of all very good value 
We use the air coach from Belfast stops outside the Gresham and a short stroll you are in the hotel
Check in very fast and a very helpful young man at the lift to show you to you room and make you feel very welcome
We will be back again soon   ",5,2015,05,12
231,Weekend away,"Great location for Shopping , Bars , restaurants . 
The use of the Room key to access the Lifts & get to your floor & also toilets in the residence bar is obviously a security measure but the lift in particular was extremely tedious , I saw many people try getting to their floor only to end back at reception .. myself included ... that said , its a nice hotel with a good central location .",4,2015,05,12

231,DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!,"I will start this review with the positive, the rooms are very clean and are also of quite a high quality, definitely a comfortable pleasant place to stay. As an additional to this I found the staff extremely pleasant and were definitely capable of providing good customer service, the waiting staff were all lovely! However, the food is worse than I have ever experienced in any hotel if I was asked to use one word to sum up the food here it would be disgusting. The first night I ate here I ordered a spinach tart as a starter but this was not available on the night so the friendly and attentive waitress suggested I try the soup of the day, It  had the consistency of water and tasted like cut grass, I was then given my ""Main course"" which was venison sausages and mash with caramelised red onions, the sausage was rubbery and tasted as though it had been microwaved multiple times, The mash was runny and tasted like instant mash and the onions were extremely unpleasant, there was no gravy or anything else served with it and the presentation was terrible. The second night I ate there was with some work colleagues and me and one colleague ordered two beef burgers, the buns on both were completely stale and my colleague did not even eat hers, I ate mine but only because I was very hungry, This was served with instant chips which were not cooked properly and were soft in texture, they were extremely greasy and essentially inedible. I think had I gone to my local pub and been served this food as pub grub I would be extremely disappointed so I was surprised to be served food of such a poor quality. I have eaten in the jurys in Cork and the food is what I'd consider to be of a high standard. I am by no means a fussy eater may I add, I've often eaten in supermacs and been satisfied... this food however was genuinely disgusting. I'd hope the management take this criticism as constructive as it takes away from what otherwise would be a very nice hotel. I think next time I'm staying somewhere for business I will request that it's not this hotel as it's inconvenient having to source food from surrounding restaurants.",2,2015,05,11
231,"Pleasant stay, excellent location","The room was clean and nice, beds were comfortable. Basic toiletries were provided and the room was a good size. Wifi was free but continuously disconnected which got annoying. The best part was the location though, walking distance to everything, Trinity College, Old Jameson Distillery, Dublin Castle etc. We paid quite a lot for what it was but Dublin is expensive and the location was excellent so can't complain. Would stay there again.",4,2015,05,10
231,Stay.,"The stay was very good . Friendly service and clean rooms . The food was fresh , tasted very good and the portions were adequate. We will recommend your hotel and definitely book our next Ireland vacation definitely go back with you .",4,2015,05,09
231,Not a very good hotel - still a lot to improve!,"Based in a busy hub of Dublin, the hotel offers easy access to many of Dublin’s attractions. Just minutes away is the historic O’Connell Street, which is a pulsing centre of Dublin activity and features Dublin’s General Post office landmark building, as well as a range of monuments and statues relating to Irish Heritage.

The room we used was very clean (aside from the chair in the room completely full of dust probably not cleaned for months). 
The en-suite bathroom was very basic, nothing to fancy – and I personally didn’t like it very much – however in general it was clean. 

Unfortunately the water while you were taking a shower, wasn’t very warm at all. We advised reception, and they were very kind to help but it didn’t solve the problem. 
Wi-Fi as well was really bad – constantly disconnecting. 

I’m really sorry but I’m very disappointed with the hotel and the area as well, so if I ever go back to Dublin I won’t be sleeping here.

231,"Good location, well finished hotel, disappointing breakfast.","I'm really aggrieved to give this place such a low score, but feel it deserves one.....

It's in a good location, and is a beautifully finished place with nice rooms and a cracking bar etc.

Problem is that the buffet style breakfast, despite having a vast choice of food, was far far too cold! The plates were cold, the food was cold and the eggs over done. And despite the place buzzing with staff nobody asked if ""everything is ok"", in fact not even on checking out.

So, makings of a great place and maybe I hit it on a bad day but hey you need to be consistent to get great feedback.",3,2015,05,04
231,Perfect location,"This hotel is ideally situated for Dublin city centre near enough for walking and far enough away not to get disturbed at night. Hotel clean, staff very helpful. Our room overlooked Parnell Street and although busy during the day - we stayed Saturday to Sunday- it was very quiet during the night. Room had all you could need it had both a double and single bed. We had a few drinks before going out and at each lift there is an ice machine so no need to buy any. We also paid extra for the buffet breakfast. Good plentiful food and everything that you could want.

Would definitely stay here again if visiting Dublin.",5,2015,05,04
231,Great location,"Booked this hotel for the location.  The staff team were pleasant and helpful.  Rooms were of a good size, comfortable bed and a choice of pillows.  Would have loved a bath but only had a shower, it did have decent pressure though.  Breakfast was a treat, buffet style with an excellent range of products.  Really set us up for the day.  The bar in the evening was a civilized experience.  It's not the sort of hotel that attracts stag and hen parties so it was a pleasure to sit and relax with a glass of wine. 

If like me walking can be a problem the recommended parking at 10 euros was too far away from the hotel.  In the end we moved the car to a place just down the side of the hotel.  It was 15 euros for 24 hours but suited our needs. 

WiFi - The hotel advertises free wifi.  What it fails to say is that it's free for 24 hours then you're asked to upgrade at a cost.  You need to enter an email address and then you're in.  What I did was use another email address the next day and another the day after.  So yes wifi was free for our whole stay.",4,2015,05,01
231,The Verdict is Inn - Excellent,"We arrived in Dublin and sat down to find a hotel while still in the airport.  We do not make reservations because we fly standby and never know if we will be on a partiular flight.  We scanned the hotels and found that many were full or were to high-priced.  We found the Jurys Inn and it was under 180 euros for two nights.  We thought that was good.  We arrived and were pleasantly surprised at the location (near MaConnell Street-main street), pleased with the decor and happy with the size of our room.  There was a restaurant on the second floor with good food.  The staff was helpful with answering our questions and they told us of a couple of neat pubs for lunch or dinner.",5,2015,05,01

Can't recommend this hotel enough. Well done to all the team.",5,2015,05,01
231,definitely come back,"the hotel is about 10 minutes walk to temple bar, next to all main shopping streets, bus stations...Service very good, nice staff, nice breakfast.

231,Good hotel in ideal location,"Having stayed in quite a few  hotels in Dublin, Jurys Inn, Parnell Street is up there with the best of other 3* hotels. It offers good value for a central city hotel, so convenient to the hustle and bustle of the city. Could not fault check-in, our room and staff. We stayed Easter week and it was very busy. For that excellent breakfast best to go to dining area before 9am. After that time it gets very packed with everybody racing around to the various buffet. Plenty to do and see in the surrounding with transport connections just around the corner. For anybody going to Dublin it is an ideal base.",4,2015,04,30
231,Good central location,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights with a rather large group on business. Efficient check-in, friendly staff and quite nice rooms. Breakfast was crowdy but OK, and we spent som time in the evenings in the bar which was quit and relaxed compared to the noisy Irish pubs.",4,2015,04,30
231,Not as good as we thought or hoped but it is good value,"We stayed here with two other couples (family) for 4 nights and we were all a bit disappointed with the quality of the rooms and service. However, the tariff was very reasonable and included a great buffet breakfast. The rooms were clean but pretty basic and the service from staff was lackluster. The breakfast (as stated above) was brilliant with lots of good choices and good quality food on the buffet. The security system for access to the hotel and rooms was a nightmare. They have key card security system on the front door (after 10 pm), lifts (externally and internally), the fire door on the room floor and the room. Returning home later in the evening after a few bevies often resulted in a very frustrating time just to get to our rooms! The staff were friendly and helpful enough if you approached them but they had to be coaxed to provide the information you wanted, and the ones we spoke too didn't seem to have great knowledge of good local bars or restaurants (within 5 minute walk). Overall we enjoyed our stay but were expecting a bit more from the hotel.",3,2015,04,29
231,"Good Quality Hotel, Good Location","This hotel was a little out of our price range, but compared to the cheaper hotels it looked a million times better in photographs, so we stretched to afford it. I'm very glad we did. It is located very conveniently for the bus from and to the airport and the Dublin tour buses, and there is a Tesco across the road for any 'no toothpaste!' type emergencies. 

The room was very clean and tidy, and more importantly for me, so was the bathroom. Our room had a huge window overlooking the road below, giving us a glimpse of bustling Dublin life. Unfortunately the pillows were very hard and the quilt was heavy, so we didn't sleep particularly well. There were tea and coffee making facilities, a hair dryer, shampoo and shower gel provided.

The staff were all very friendly and engaging, noticing my husband's birthday badge and wishing him happy birthday throughout our stay. Check-out is at 12pm, which is good for a Guinness hangover. The staff were lovely as we left and called us back to ask if we wanted to use the free left luggage facility, which we didn't know about and made good use of. 

I would definitely stay here again!",4,2015,04,29
231,"Clean, good standard, location +/-","Rooms are immaculate and consistently so.
I have stayed a few times.  Price is high because it is so, so central.  Although the area is not going to be to everyone's taste (north inner city, not the most salubrious!!), it is still extremely close to most paces/things.  
Staff are usually quite nice  ...  so overall, it is worth it.  ",3,2015,04,29
231,Just Average,"This hotel is situated in a quiet part of central Dublin with not much noise at night. Check in was smooth and we had a travel cot as requested though it took 3 emails to get them to confirm this.  The room itself was of premier inn standard but the sofa bed was very uncomfortable the mattress barely adequate for a small toddler, so I wouldn't have liked to sleep in it myself.  The other bed was a double, something to be aware of because I'd normally expect a King.  The room was a good size but with the sofa bed made up and travel cot and pushchair there was little space to move about.
Be aware breakfast at peak time is quite literally a bun fight.  Both myself and my husband were shoved by people rather too keen to get to the hot food and it was so busy we didn't feel it was safe to let our toddler go up to the buffet.  You have to serve yourself even the hot drinks and even get your own cutlery and serviettes which I felt let it down a little.  Would normally expect the table to be laid.  The selection was very good and the food of a good standard, so including the breakfast was good value for money, just avoid the peak times which are advertised in the lifts.  
Staff were all professional and friendly.
I would stay again if got a cheap rate but I have stayed at better for less than we paid.",3,2015,04,29
231,Clean and comfy,"Friendly welcome and staff at all times helpful and polite. Room spotless and comfortable. Breakfast delicious and plentiful. Security  good. Very centrally located, easy walk to bus stops for airport and bus tours also for Liffy boat trips and Temple Bar area and shops.

231,Don't be Fooled,"My room was booked through an agency at a good price. When I arrived at check in, the receptionist said I had a room with double bed and sofabed and did I need that; being an easy-going person I said that a double bed was sufficient, as I was on my own. She then asked if I prefered a shower and i said yes. All this was phrased as if she was doing me a favour, but when i got to my room, it was clear that I had been down-graded to a tiny room. Not only was the room small, the bathroom had just about enough room for toilet, sink and shower cubicle; there wasn't even anywhere to put toiletries! 
I was on a tight schedule and only there for one night, so there was no time or point in trying to change rooms. I did try and speak to a manager, just to let them know it was very poor on their part, but one was not immediately available and in the end I had no time to wait. I will not use this hotel again.",1,2015,04,27
231,A very good hotel in Dublin,"Hotel well located in the city center with a friendly and efficient staff. Room clean but a bit small . Full breakfast of good quality.
One negative : no parking and recommended public parking is quite far but interesting price (10 € / day) for hotel guests",4,2015,04,27
231,Good location friendly staff,"We stayed here for 4 nights.
 The staff were very friendly and helpful. Good location to do Dublin by foot.
The rooms are a bit old, but clean and comfortable. With all the facilities needed.
I would definitely come back on my next trip.

231,Value for Money,I was very happy with everything about your hotel except the cost which seems to have doubled in the last year.  I stayed around Christmas and it was only €80.00 for a room and this time it was €150.00.  Wondering why the price hike?   Will probably not be able to afford to stay again.,5,2015,04,27
231,A GOOD OPTION IN A BUSY CITY,"I'll be honest - I only booked here because all my preferred hotels were full. But, despite the slightly less than great surroundings, I was really happy here (five nights). Clean, pleasant room, excellent breakfast buffet, nice staff. Can't really complain.",4,2015,04,26
231,"3rd stay,even better.Great hotel.","Just got back from a 3day break 22-25april,my 3rd stay here great hotel,good staff.Would and will be returning again soon,thank you.All rooms has been refurbished and are very smart.If I had to pick a fault its the sink water tap flow,its very slow running,but you can live with that,,HAPPY DAYS",5,2015,04,26
231,Great location and presentation,"Recently visited the Jury's Inn Parnell Street as a surprise break for my birthday. The hotel is in the perfect location within the shopping part of Dublin, only a quick walk away from all the shops and cafes and bars. We arrived early at 11am and although check in was not supposed to be till 2pm we asked reception and they kindly let us check in which was handy as it was raining and we had our suitcase with us. Access to rooms very secure has you have to use room key card for the lifts. Someone was always available in reception to meet you and answer and questions. The rooms were pretty standard good size and provided tea and coffee facilities alongside iron and ironing board. A hairdryer and toiletries were so available. The only downside to the stay here was the smell from the drainage/sewage system; had to keep bathroom door closed as all times because of this and no the smell was not from me or my other half haha. Overall good hotel with additional extras and great inner city location, would definitely stay again!",4,2015,04,26
231,first class staff,"great welcome late in the evening from security person and reception. maybe I should have know they did not have parking facilities, however the man on security was really helpful and ensured the parking problem was sorted quickly and well.

231,Very Friendly Hotel with excellent facilities,"A very good stay at this hotel. Good location for visiting central Dublin within easy reach of tourist spots, shops, Temple Bar area for food & drink. All  of the staff were very friendly & helpful. Breakfast excellent & for what you get good value. Room large & comfortable & well insulated from the normal noise of a city.",5,2015,04,25
231,Great hotel!,"Well located, clean hotel with modern decor. Quiet rooms. Very friendly and helpful staff. Good breakfast.
Short walk to Henry's Street and Temple Bar area. 
Free WiFi didn't work properly all the time, but we managed.",4,2015,04,25
231,"Excellent hotel, will be back!","Booked two nights here for my first trip to Dublin. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was ready two hours before check in which was a bonus. Our room was spotless and so quiet. Good discount on nearby car park, 10 Euros for 24 hours, great if you don't want to use the car.  Can't fault this hotel. Not in the best street in Dublin but that never bothered us...all the main sights are within walking distance.",5,2015,04,25
231,DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL,"I am meant to be booked in to this hotel tonight, 6 rooms were booked in January via the Internet, the rest of my family members had an earlier flight and checked in at 5pm, at that check in, my name was on the system as having a room for the weekend, unfortunately my flight was delayed so I arrived at the hotel at 01:00 this morning, on arrival at reception, I was advised that there was no rooms available and that I would be moved to another hotel, when I queried why this had happened, my room was booked months in advance, I was told that somebody had already checked in using my name, the night manager Alex went to check who was in my room, he then returned to tell me that there was luggage in there but no people and that it wasn't my room, he then tried to make out that they had double booked. I asked why they would resell a room that had been booked months in advance and advised that this could only have been done after 17:00 today as the rest of my party had checked in and was told at 17:00 that I was on the system. I have now had to move  hotels and have been told to return in the morning to sort it out. The staff at the jurys inn are totally unprofessional, the reception staff obviously doesn't check ID on arrival. This has totally ruined my weekend!!",1,2015,04,24
231,Far from ideal parking,"The car park is a few minutes walk away, the main issue with this is you must walk through the streets with any luggage you have. The area is not great so
I felt unsafe with my belongings in the evening whilst passing by people with addiction issues, not forgetting the fact it is also inconvenient. On the small plus side the parking was fairly cheap compared to other hotels.

The room wasn't that nice, the other jury's in Dublin are nicer. The breakfast wasn't bad at the hotel but the overall reception area is fairly limited and I don't remember seeing a bar. 

One small plus is the hotel is fairly close to bars etc after a 15 min walk. 

I wouldn't stay there again through choice, try the jury's custom house or Christchurch",2,2015,04,24
231,Ideal & Central to everything.,"Perfect unless your in a room next to the local refuse yard where the noise starts before 6am every morning. Bleeping lorries as they reverse was constant from then on. Bare this in mind when you are booking.
              ",4,2015,04,24
231,Good Value Central Location,went for a concert so spent v little time in hotel just dropped bags and went out only used to sleep really.  Very good sleep quality very clean. Only bad thing residents bar closed at 130 very hard to get a late drink,4,2015,04,23
231,Great for a city break,"This is a hotel with a great location, really close to O'Connell St. and Dublin main attractions. If you want to visit Guinness Storehouse or Jameson Old distillery, the tram (or LUAS) station you need is less than 5 minutes away by foot.  
The hotel interior looks really new and the rooms are on perfect condition and very clean.
Breakfast buffet was ok. Staff is helpful but not very friendly.
The only problem was the room view. Its not good at all specially if you get the inside patio view.",4,2015,04,23

231,"great, central location","We booked here after reviewing loads of hotels in Dublin. 
We needdd parking, this is available right behind the hotel,  I'll admit the car park (run by 3rd party) looks like something from the 1970's but our car was fine after 2 days parking.
The shuttle bus to the airport (if you need it) is no more than a 5 minute walk around the block.
The hotel is a 10-15 minutes walk from anything in the city centre. 
It is also a very clean hotel. 
We would visit here again without hesitation ",4,2015,04,22
231,Great value and location,"Had a fabulous trip to Dublin and staying at the jury's inn made it even more enjoyable. Friendly staff, clean and comfortable and in an excellent location. Would definitely return and would also recommend this hotel. ",4,2015,04,21
231,Apalling - I wouldn't go back.,"I made a group booking for 8 rooms to find that they had been split up into separate bookings and everyone charged individually, plus my room was cancelled for no reason the day of my arrival. As the hotel was full, I ended up having to share a room with a colleague.   ",1,2015,04,21
231,We will return,"Very pleased overall, everything clean and comfortable, staff friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend. Bit disappointed though that my husband had to change a ten pound note for euros at the desk, also giving his name and address and showing his passport - all he wanted was a coffee from the machine in the lobby! This was during checking out - we had loads of luggage and stuff (two of us are wheelchair users) so he had to 'stand guard' for an hour. A more 'person centred' approach might have been nice at that point!",4,2015,04,20
231,Conveniently located - but not exactly cheap,"For accessibility and convenience this is a hard hotel to beat in Dublin.  Unfortunately the prices vary greatly with booking situation.  Can be good or poor value.  Avoid the breakfast buffet though - not really worth it.

231,"Functional hotel, good for short business stays","I stayed here for one night for a business trip.  It’s a very functional hotel in a practical location in the middle of the city.  

The rooms are a good size, the facilities are adequate including hairdryer and ironing board.  Toiletries are fixed to the wall and functional – just soap, no shower caps etc. 

The free wifi was good when I first connected, but poor after that - I had no connection at all in the morning, which was frustrating. 

The breakfast was a bit badly laid out – I spent some time going round in circles trying to find things, and the plates for the hot food were cold, but it was tasty - note, if you have a pre-paid room that doesn’t include breakfast take your wallet as you have to pay before you eat.  

I would say it’s a good place to stay for business, but it’s a bit soulless for pleasure, although we did see a number of families at breakfast.",4,2015,04,20
231,girls weekend,"We had 2 nights here room only.Hotel was clean .several of us found the beds uncomfy.Hairdryer and toiletries provided.no fridge or safe in room.no scenic view but this did not bother us.
Staff were pleasant.
The hotel is just a bit outside the main bar areas but this made the hotel quiet at night.Although we had an a connecting room with some noisy people next door.

there are a couple of cafes right opposite where you can get breakfast a lot less than hotel.Also tesco express opposite which is handy.
All in all a pleasant stay .",3,2015,04,20
231,Great Hotel,The hotel was in a good location.  We arrived 10.00am (very early!) and asked about leaving our suitcases.  We were told that there was a room available and so checked in immediately.  The staff were really friendly and our room was spotless.  Breakfast was lovely and plentiful - hot and cold choices.  We would definitely return here. ,5,2015,04,20
231,"Great service, average rooms, average cleans","The rooms are bare with facilities - e.g. no mini bar, no safe in the room, no room service. The clean wasn't up to par, there were a few hairs found in the bathroom upon check-in. However, great customer service. Greeted by manager upon arrival & whenever exiting or entering the building, receptionist staff friendly. Pretty good value for money but would definitely recommend adding more facilities in the rooms.",3,2015,04,17
231,Cold Breakfast,"I sometimes wonder how often managers go through their own hotel experience. This is a very central hotel in which I stayed last night. The location is very good for central Dublin, the wifi is free and high speed, the parking is quite close to the hotel and although I object to paying for parking in hotels with their own car park, this one doesn't so a €10 overnight rate isn't bad in central Dublin for the car park behind the hotel (though there's no recognition in their rate to suggest that they have no car park). However, when it came to breakfast there's no way to dress this up - the ""hot"" breakfast buffet was cold - far too cold. I sometimes wonder when I see an obvious flaw in a hotel's offering why nobody seems to be bothered. I think perhaps it's because people are immune to average service these days - or maybe it's because it's easier to get things improved in the longer term for all rather than for oneself on the day by using Trip Advisor. Anyway, the cold breakfast will ensure I give this one a wide berth in future unless I am really stuck. Very basic and all too common disregard for customers.",3,2015,04,17

231,ok for 1 night,"We stayed for 1 night in this hotel as we were going to a concert in the city. We booked the room last minute and ended up paying over £120 for the night, which we felt was very expensive.The hotel is in a good location, close to all the shops/bars/restaurants. When we arrived at the hotel check in was fine and staff were friendly. The problem we had was with the cleanliness of the room. There were hairs in the shower and there were marks on the bedsheets. The shower was also very slow to drain, meaning that the water was up over your feet after only a few minutes. We didn't complain as we were only staying one night so we were willing to put up with it for one night. Next time we're going to Dublin though, we'll find somewhere else to stay.",3,2015,04,17
231,Lovely weekend away,"Two couples stayed at Jury's Inn, Parnell Street June 2014. The rooms were clean and the staff were lovely.

Rooms were slightly smaller than some other Dublin hotels we have stayed in but this may be directly related to the location of the hotel. The hotel is very central for all of Dublin. Everything was in walking distance!

Even though we were central, there was no noise at night time as could be expected in hotels in the center of a large city. Great beds for a great nights sleep.

Food was good and bar was lovely. Met some other guests in the bar who were having a great time too!

Would recommend this hotel to friends and family if a short Dublin break is being planned.",4,2015,04,17

231,Amazing stay!,"Have just returned home from a two night stay at this hotel and could not have had a better trip!! The hotel is a two minute walk from O'Connell Street - great if you get the Aircoach from the airport! - and just around the corner from the famous Moore Street Market, leading you straight onto Henry Street which is fantastic for shopping. 
The staff at the hotel are so friendly, and honestly couldn't do more for you. Despite arriving at 8.15am, the reception staff offered to store our luggage for the day and even checked to see if there was a room available (though there wasn't, we weren't expecting this and it highlighted the efficiency of the staff). The breakfast is very well stocked and tasty - we went around 8am both mornings and, though the restaurant was busy, we didn't have have to wait for a table. A tip would be to book breakfast on arrival at the hotel. We were offered €9 each per day which was much cheaper than we found online. 
The hotel has a great restaurant menu though we didn't eat there apart from breakfast. The Parnell Heritage Bar and Grill down the street was our chosen venue for evening meals - well worth a visit for the steak and Guinness casserole. 
I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for its central location, fantastic service and overall ease of visit - will definitely be returning on our next visit to Dublin!",5,2015,04,16
231,Great Stay,"Good hotel in a great location.  Accommodation was very comfortable and spotless.  Breakfast was good, plenty of variety.  All staff were courteous and the reception staff were extremely helpful.  Booked well in advance so great value.",5,2015,04,16
231,Central,"I stayed here for a girls weekend in feb and it was fab. Very central to the the shops an temple bar is about a 10min walk away. The hotel was very nice and clean, and they also allowed us to leave our cases on arrival and departure. The only gripe I chad was the lifts as we hadn't a clue how to use them with the cards an there was not much info in there to advise how they worked either!",5,2015,04,16
231,Bless the Jury,"Looking for a triple room, centrally located and with easy access to public transport to the airport.
This hotel seemed the right choice.
Very easy to find right off Parnell square and the bus 16 route (don't forget the 3.30€ coins).
Very nice room considering the price.
All together I would definately recommend this pace for anyone wanting to stay close to central Dublin in the mid-price range.",5,2015,04,16
231,A great stay!,"The thing I like about Jury's Inn is that you get them all the same
way. You know what to expect. Great place to stay if ur in Dublin, it's off the beaten tourist track but extremely central and in walking distance of all attractions. The room was immaculate and the cleaning staff deserve an extra mention, as their daily tidy of our room was excellent. Excellent, relaxing stay. The only gripe, that's worth a mention is the front desk staff. The welcomer was lovely, but sadly
this didn't translate when u went to check in/out. As the staff on when we were there weren't very pleasant. But on the whole, would definetly recommend.",5,2015,04,15

231,Comfortable overnight stay,Stayed here for 1 night while attending a concert in 3 arena. We decided to go for this hotel rather than the one beside the custom house as our bus stopped right beside it and we wanted to go shopping when we arrived and didn't want to have I walk the whole way down to the custom house and back again. We arrived quite early and didn't expect to get checked in but the lady at the desk said she had a room ready and we could have it. This was great as we were just after a 4 hour bus journey. The hotel was great nice location and clean and spacious rooms. We got it quite cheap by booking through their own. We didn't done in the hotel so can't comment in that. Would definitely stay here again. ,4,2015,04,15
231,DO NOT BOOK THROUGH THIER WEBSITE!!!!!,"After much difficulty with the system ( the site would either pre-populate the search with incorrect data (dates, # of People, # of rooms) or would return search results with incorrect info), I was finally able to generate rates for the dates and # of people I desired.
I selected a more expensive rate that can be cancelled. However, the email confirmation stated that they had changed my reservation to a slightly discounted pre paid rate that is non refundable. I immediately emailed the hotel to explain the error with their system and to have my reservation corrected. 
Their response: a terse, rude email from Aisha Ahmed refusing to correct their error.

Bottom line: unless you want to let Jury's select your reservation details, Call instead of using their site.  Or better yet, try ANY other hotel chain.",1,2015,04,13

231,Served its Purpose,"We actually booked at Jury's Christchurch but that's another story.  Since we have stayed at other Jury's and were satisfied, we agreed to move to this location.  As previous posters had written, the location is fair but not terrible.  I liked the shops in the area which we found handy for coffee, last minute needs and a nearby pub called Oval which we stopped into on our way back to the hotel.  The breakfast was adequate, a typical buffet style.  The residents bar was decent and well attended the 3 nights we were there, but I would suggest having a male on duty with the female bartenders since there were a couple of times the patrons were inappropriate - to staff and patrons. Glad they have security in the lobby - definitely needed. The WiFi had some trouble the first day but was happy to know the staff was aware and in the process of addressing it, which they did. The room was clean, fair décor, but the bed felt like a box spring.    Overall not a complete disappointment, it served its purpose, but would not be my first choice.",3,2015,04,12
231,Excellent stay,"very impressed with this recently refurbished hotel. Our room on the third floor wasn't the biggest room I've ever stayed in but it was very smart, immaculate and had everything we needed including a hairdryer near the mirror! Comfortable large bed and quiet at night guaranteeing a great night sleep. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was superb with the normal offerings of a buffet breakfast difference being the staff didn't whip your plate away so repeat visits were allowed! Also the security of the hotel was good including an impressive reception security boxes. Would stay again.",5,2015,04,11

We found this hotel to be excellent value for money with a clean modern feel in an excellent location for exploring Dublin. If you need it, the Airbus stop is just round the corner on O'Connell Street. You're just 5 minutes walk over to Temple Bar and the historic South Side. It's convenient for an event at Croke Park. We attended a concert at the 3 Arena, so the Luas Tram stop just 5 mins walk away was also really useful. As much as you want - Buffet Breakfast was great, filled us up for the whole day at just E10 for adults, and we also had a meal in the Bar too, which was well presented and delicious. For a change of scenery and great food, try the Parnell Heritage Bar, just 20 seconds walk up the street. Overall a great holiday and a brilliant hotel for exploring all of Dublin. We would DEFINATELY go back.

231,Modern hotel near the centre,"Modern hotel in the centre. Friendly people. Modern furniture. Breakfast buffet okay for Ireland. Safe hotel, as you can enter the lift and also the restrooms in the second floor only with your room card.

231,Easter,"Excellent.  I will be back.  Everyone in the Hotel was very helpful, and the location was very central, just a few short steps to the top of O Connell Street. I have often stayed here previously. Security is also gret",5,2015,04,08
231,Pleasantly surprised,"A friend and I stayed here for 2 nights the end of March.  From the moment we first walked into the lobby to entering our room we were most pleasantly surprised. We were expecting a much more 'budget class' hotel and were pleased with the facilities. We stayed in a room with a twin and a double bed. It was spacious enough for us and the fairly modern decor was nice. The bathroom was lacking in counter space, but was decently sized. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. The first room that we were given had an issue with a noisy toilet constantly running. With a quick call to the front desk we were immediately moved to another room. We did not utilize a rate that included breakfast, but that was totally fine with us because the rate we did get was fantastic compared to like hotels in the area.  Our taxi driver on the way to this hotel recommended eating right across the street, The Kingfisher, for the fish and chips. We did eat there, but ended up having a burger, which was one of the best burgers either of us have ever had, and very reasonable prices. He also recommended the Heritage Pub right down the way from the hotel and it was great, we both enjoyed the Guinness casserole. We ate breakfast at a cafe across the street and adjacent to The Kingfisher, I forgot the catchy sounding name of the cafe. It was a wonderful breakfast which included coffee or tea for about $6.50US. My Americano was excellent. The area has been said to not be the best, but it is surrounded by many pubs and shops & is within walking distance to cross the river to Temple Bar, Dublin Castle & TrinityCollege. I highly recommend Jury's Parnell for a comfortable, clean hotel that is surrounded by or easy access to all that you would need, want to do or see while in Dublin. Oh, and the complimentary wifi was a huge plus for us to keep in touch with family and friends.",5,2015,04,07
231,better than I expected,"I stayed in Jury's Inn April first for two nights and it was great. The staff were some of the friendliest and most helpful staff I've met for quite a while. The rooms were clean and of a good size for 3 of us. The food was tasty and the bar staff second to none.

What lets it down slightly is the location. Although very close to all amenities the immediate area  around the hotel is a bit run down. That said it did not affect our stay.

I would recommend this reasonably priced hotel and if I ever return to Dublin I would stay there again.",5,2015,04,06
231,Great hotel,"Great hotel - clean, modern, with everything we needed. Only thing I didn't like was the apparently 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom - not ideal if you have long hair and I'm not the type to bring shampoo or conditioner with me when I travel to a hotel. I thought the location was perfect, it was an easy bus ride from the airport and a 2 minute walk to the hotel from the stop. It was about a 10 minute walk to Temple Bar and the city centre and just a few minutes walk to a big shopping area. It was across the street from Tesco (super convenient!) and there were tons of pubs nearby. It is also near lots of bus routes on O'Connell Street which was convenient for getting to farther away sites like the Guinness Storehouse. The breakfast was also really good, delicious food and lots of selection available. ",5,2015,04,05
231,"Helpful Staff, Great Location","This hotel is in a great location, within walking distance to the Temple bar area and other attractions. We had a booking issue (due to the travel agent) and the staff were very helpful and understanding. The rooms are nice, the buffet breakfast had various options and the wifi worked well, I would recommend staying here to anyone.",4,2015,04,05
231,Great Hotel,"This hotel worked well for us. I travelled to Dublin with my sister for a short break and for what we paid I was happy. 

Check in was fine, straight forward and easy which was good for us as we arrived late at night (for info, we got a cab from the airport which was just over 20 euro). We had a twin room (1 double and 1 single bed) which was cleaned daily. The room was quiet and we slept well. It had an air conditioning unit which was useful, as well as the usual tea/coffee, hairdryer etc. 

We used the hotel bar once on our first night and it was absolutely fine - staff were pleasant and helpful. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel so can't comment there (however, can recommend Flanagan's on O'Connell Street, just round the corner). 

Location wise it was great for us. As others have said it isn't in the nicest area of the city, but within a minute you can walk round to O'Connell Street and a little further on over the river to Temple Bar - maybe 5 minutes walk at most. 

All in all, it was great for what we wanted and did the job!",4,2015,04,03
231,Good Location,Just come back from 2 nights at this hotel. Good location you can easily access everything either by foot or bus. Very nice and spacious room clean and quiet. when you arrive at the airport get the airport link bus its 10 euros return for adults just ask for Parnell street and its a two minute walk from the bus stop .  I would recommend this hotel  and I would stay here again. (plus point free WiFi),4,2015,04,03
231,"Good, centrally located hotel","Staff was very friendly, the hotel is located centrally in Dublin. The room had enough space, was clean and the beds were comfortable. WIFI was excellent (great speed!). Bathroom was clean but old fashioned.",4,2015,04,03
231,"Friendly staff, great location!","My partner and I stayed here on the first night of our 7 week European holiday and after 30 hours of sitting on a plane it was nice to find a place to put our bags, we arrived early in the morning and although our room wasn't ready (check in wasn't until 2pm) we were able to leave our bags in the storeroom while we set out to explore Dublin. The main part of the city is within 10-15 minutes walking distance and there are plenty of bus stops nearby. We arrived later to check in and freshen up before dinner. The room was very clean and comfortable! 
The receptionist was extremely helpful, she printed out our flight tickets for the next morning and advised on which bus to take to guarantee we would arrive on time. It's a shame we were only there for one night! Would visit again! :)",5,2015,04,02

The bedrooms were large, clean and had all the amenities you could want. I would not hesitate to book here again and would recommend it to family and friends.",5,2015,04,02
231,just about ok,"The location of this hotel is ideal if you are on a short shopping trip as it is very central although on the less nice side of town. On our arrival the Receptionist was very friendly however our room wasn't ready so she kindly let us leave our baggage in a room for an hour or so until the room was ready. We had a corner room on the 4th floor which had no great view but was nice and bright and clean with a tiny bathroom with a shower curtain as opposed to a shower door so in need of general updating. There was quite alot of noise during the night from a building site nearby so neither of us slept well. On arrival to the breakfast room the following morning, a very pleasant guy called Jose took our room number and told us we can sit anywhere that was free. I looked around for a table that might be in a nice area but there wasn't one. It was like being in a work Canteen with hoards of people q-ing for food. I stood for about 7 mins to get a slice of bread toasted in the toaster and then it only had toasted on one side. I then went to get coffee only to find, there was no choice of coffee's which i would think is basic these days. I took a mug of coffee which was gray and really light so i asked a girl who was cleaning off tables if she could organize a stronger coffee or an americano, she said with a very serious face she can do that but obviously i'd have to pay for it. it was brought down to me and she then asked me for the money. I said i would pay for it when leaving the hotel as had no cash on me and she said that was not possible and could i go to my room and get the money. In this day and age not to be able to get a good cup of coffee without it being a big issue is ridiculous. The table staff in the dining room were all very unfriendly and looked very unhappy to be there and me with them!",3,2015,04,02
231,Nice Hotel,"Perfectly nice hotel in a good location, the room was spacious and clean and the check in process whilst slow was OK, there is even a Tesco opposite for last minute provisions.  Wifi was slow and kept disconnecting but at least free.",4,2015,04,02

231,"not bad, not good","jurys inn is situated on Parnell street, which is very central but isn't a particularly attractive area of Dublin. So ok location but not great. The hotel is fine, the service was ok tough minimal, the rooms clean and modern, the wifi free and works, the TV's newish and worked. The bar was quiet but nice enough. I got told both mornings that I hadt booked breakfast when I when  I had so that was a bit annoying. The main issue was that around 1 to 3 am the corridors of the hotel on both nights became full of screaming women presumably back from  hen doos. One woman sounded like she was being murdered.  And it went on uninterrupted by staff for a good half an hour. Hopefully she wasn't the bride to be, So yes both nights riday and Saturday we were woken by loud people who didn't seem to care where they were. Not really the hotels fault but still something to be aware f.",3,2015,04,01

231,Not for those who like a good night's sleep,"Toilet ran constantly. Had to switch rooms and that didn't remedy toilet running. No sleep thanks to noisy guests and banging of doors. Terrible.

Check in and out was easy. Breakfast was plentiful and good!  Only comment we would have was the tables were slow to be cleared but then again it was very very busy at 9.15am. Would definitely stay here again. Great value ,5,2015,03,30
231,Amazing value for a central location.,"Stayed here for 3 nights in March 2015. We paid about £70 a night inc breakfast and my goodness what a breakfast. We could not fault it, there was so much choice, all fresh and all cooked beautifully. The coffee was served in decent size mugs and the fresh pastries and bread selection was wonderful. Served from 7-10 you had plenty of time even if you overslept.
We had room 564 and it was a really good sized room, very quiet, one double bed and a single. Clean everywhere and had everything you could need. The lady came every day and changed our towels( I feel this slightly unnecessary, they could ask you to leave them on bathroom floor if you want them changing).
I had an issue with the bathroom. I am slightly disabled, I need sticks to walk any distance. The bath in the room was very low and the shower had no adjustment if you didn't want to get your hair wet. Also the soap dispensers are set at a height that if you are in the bath you cannot reach them, not just me being a mature lady, but anyone would have difficulty. Not a well thought out design!
Location was fantastic, again with my walking problem we found this hotel amazing. We had purchased a Leap Visitor ticket...what fantastic value, we went ALL over Dublin for 72 hours for 19.50 euro, even the Airlink 747 from airport to O'Connell street return! You really cannot fault this card it was brilliant and the hotel is just off of O'Connell Street.",4,2015,03,30
231,"Great location, great staff.","My son and I stayed twice in two weeks. Either end of a trip to Europe. Total of 5 nights. 
Room size was fine for two including two beds, one full and one twin. The location was prefect. On the first stay was the week end before St. Patty's day. It was busy and loud in the Temple Bar area near the other two Jurys Inns .The hotel was quite and close to very thing. Enjoyed being close to supermarkets, restaurants and attractions but away from the crowds and noise.
The staff was very friendly and helpful.
My son left a few days before me and with him went my tech support.
I was unable to get onto the internet. I went down to the front desk for help.
The person at the desk was able to fix the problem with ease. 
We took the Airlink 747 bus from the Airport to O'Connell street (by the Greham Hotel).

Lovely friendly staff, clean comfortable room, couldn't fault it at all.  Within short walking distance of O'Connell Street, a stones throw from surrounding amenities making it easy to get to where you want to go.  Got cheap overnight parking too on a concession from using one of the nearby carparks so was a bonus.  Definitely recommend to stop off here for anyone needing a hotel in this area!",5,2015,03,28
231,Pricey but ok.,"This was an ok hotel. Location is good. About a 10 minute walk to the temple bar district. I was a walk in and I got one of the last available rooms. They originally quoted me 160 euro and after asking the girl at the desk if there was a way to get it cheaper, she was kind enough to knock it down to 140 for me. Still very expensive. Plus parking is in a public car park up the road and it costs you 15 euro for 24 hrs. 
Beds where a bit uncomfortable but the shower was nice and additional pillows are in the room if you prefer them a bit softer. All in all it was a nice place just a bit over priced. ",3,2015,03,28

231,Ideal Location,"We stayed for one night only and found the hotel ideal for a city break.

The room was spotless and the beds comfortable with all facilities from a hotel of this standard. The staff were also very helpful and friendly.

The hotel is situated in an ideal position for the centre of town and also the shuttle bus to and from the airport.

The only faults were the room keys did not work at the first attempt which was resolved by the reception staff and a constant noise from a vent in the bathroom which did not spoil our stay.",4,2015,03,12
231,I'm beginning to really like the Jury's Inn brand and this hotel is a great ambassador.,"We arrived in Dublin at 10:00 and as we went to drop our bags off at the hotel we were informed that our room was ready and were swiftly and effortlessly checked in by the super friendly and efficient receptionist.  The room we were allocated on the 4th floor although quite a walk from the lifts was exceptionally clean and spacious with neutral but well styled décor and a good sized en-suite with both bath and shower.

The hotel corridors and shared areas were spotless and bar area elegant and fairly reasonably priced and while we didn't eat in the hotel bar the food we saw being brought out both looked and smelled good.  Now what about that all important breakfast?  For me this is one of the main considerations when choosing a hotel and I wasn't disappointed with the choice or the quality of the food; the only slight change I would make would be to replace the fried potatoes with hash browns but that's just my personal preference, everything else was great.

I try to score the hotels I visit against the price that I paid for them and because we got a great deal on this hotel I have to give it full marks but even if we had paid more I would still struggle to find fault with the either the hotel, its location or its friendly and efficient staff.  I have no doubt that I will be back to Dublin again and I would actively seek to stay at this hotel again.

Well done Jury's Inn.",5,2015,03,12
231,Ideal Location and Pleasant Stay,"Stayed here for a couple of days and had a really pleasant experience. Hotel is just off the main road O'Connell Street, very warm welcome when we arrived. 

Rooms are very spacious and well kitted out, iron and ironing board, kettle, hairdryer, tv etc. Bathroom with bath and lots of room was good, spotlessly clean. Had floor to ceiling windows in our room which was very modern and trendy.  

Restaurant very comfortable and reasonably priced, good breakfast which filled us up nicely for the day. Easy check in and out and we were able to leave our bags secure in a locked room after we checked out which was nice. 

Would definitely stay at this hotel in the future, amazing value for money! Highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2015,03,12

At breakfast I asked the members of our party what the room type was that they were allocated, it transpires that we all had rooms which had a double and a single bed in despite the description of the room.
I mentioned this at check out and was informed that that was the only room type, I said that I had expected a superior room as I had paid 30 euro more for our room, I was asked if I had a newspaper and water in the room which we did,also wifi which we did not use.
If this is what I paid an extra 30 euro for I am very disappointed,

231,Fantastic hotel in great location,"Just back from a stay in Dublin and had a great stay in this lovely hotel. 

The hotel is located on Parnell Street which is a fantastic location for all the shops and a short pleasant stroll to Temple Bar. Check in was very swift and the girls on reception were lovely and very friendly. The rooms are very nice with modern decor and everything you would need for a comfortable stay even down to an iron and ironing board! Located on every corridor they also had vending machines and ice machines which I felt was a great idea. 

We didn't eat in the dining room in the evening but did go down for breakfast in the morning which I felt was very good value at 10 euros and certainly set us up for the day.

When visiting Dublin I would certainly stay at this hotel again we all had a great stay.",5,2015,03,08

231,Quick Stop over - Ideal,"The Hotel was clean and the room nice but I was only there for a few hours so can't comment fully.  What I can say is check in was quick and easy and when I returned to the hotel after a night out in Temple Bar having had my wallet, phone, cash and credit cards stolen, the staff were great both at the time (dealing with a very grumpy and fairly inebriated customer) and so were the staff on check out.  Made what was a very distressing evening a lot easier to bear, even to the guy on night shift lending me his tablet for internet access.  Wouldn't hesitate to use it again.",4,2015,03,04

231,Fab Location & Customer Service,"My husband and I stayed at the Jury's Inn Parnell Street in Jan 2015 for our second wedding anniversary.

The hotel was in a great central location, the entrance was clean and impressive and the Receptionist staff were friendly and welcoming.  

The room was lovely, spacious and clean and all equipment was working well.  The first night of our stay was lovely and peaceful.  However, the second night was another story altogether.  The guests in the room next door were noisy and playing music very loud.  We wouldn't have minded too much but listening to the same song over and over is not entertaining!!!  I have to say that the hotel dealt with this immediately and the peaceful nights were back.  

Due to the speedy resolution to our noise complaint - which is obviously not the hotel's fault - we were happy, but to top off their excellent customer service, the hotel had given us both a voucher for breakfast as an apology for the disturbance.  This was a nice touch and very much appreciated and not expected at all.

We love Dublin and will be returning with out 3 year old son next year.  We will be booking in at this hotel.

Thanks for a lovely stay.

I would recommend the hotel to",5,2015,03,02

We were checked in by Lizi who couldn't have been more helpful and when I explained that I had lost some money due to making a mistake in the booking (my fault entirely) she said she would speak to the manager.The duty manager Jimmy offered us lunch for 4 which we gratefully accepted. The food seved for lunch was wonderful.
The rooms were spotless and bathrooms had liquid soap, shower gel and body wash in abundance.
We had booked a full Irish breakfast for 2 mornings and at 10 euros each this was fantastic value for money. Will certainly stay here again when visiting Dublin.",5,2015,03,01

231,Great hotel and location,"The hotel is conveniently located on Parnell Street within Dublin City Center, right near the shops and Cineworld. The hotel is very modern looking and very clean/tidy on the inside.

Our room was nice and clean with a modern look. Standard facilities like flat screen TV, sofa bed and bathroom. No issues with price considering the location and quality of the hotel, pretty much the rate of all other options in the area as well.

The bar (located on the 2nd floor) was very nice, nice relaxing atmosphere and the food was lovely.

I also want to say a personal thanks to Anna (Duty Manager) for organizing a birthday cake and balloons for our visit. The cake was delicious, seriously!

Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay right in the heart of Dublin City, where location and quality are important.",5,2015,02,28

Bus stops are just at the end of the road to get you around the city. 
Hotel room was good clean and very spacious. 
We used the hotel bar a few times very reasonably priced for a hotel. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel but can recommend the restaurant opposite breakfasts were lovely. 
We used the pub just down from the hotel the Parnell grill and bar very good food and a good pint of Guinness.
We would definitely stay at the jury's inn if when we come to Dublin again.

We arrived early for check in thinking if the room wasn't ready we could just drop our bags and have a wander, as it turned out the room was ready and we were checked in nice and smoothly.  

Our room was very clean and modern and at a very comfortable temprature, the only niggle I would have if I were being very picky was that the shower could have been a little hotter! There is free WIFI in the hotel with good connection speeds. We had a fantastic night's sleep on the nights we stayed, the blackout drapes are a great touch, and we heard no noise from traffic thanks to extra glazing in the windows.

There is a very pleasant bar and restaurant at this hotel and this is very reasonably priced for a city centre hotel, we had a very nice meal on our first night in Dublin. 

I would visit this hotel again.",5,2015,02,27

I didn't realise until I got there however (at 11am) that check in time wasn't until 2pm. I was laden down with a big bag, and nowhere to put it. I went in to Jury's Inn and explained my situation. They were so lovely, helpful and understanding, and allowed me to store my bag in their luggage room, at no cost, and allowed me to access it whenever i wanted.
Not only that, but they gave me a keycard so i could use the lift and have access to the toilets.

Each and every member of staff was more than pleasant, helpful and kind.

I was bowled over by their kindness and helpfulness, and i wasn't even a customer of theirs.

I will never forget this gesture, and highly recommend them to everyone.",5,2015,02,26

231,Very Good,"Lovely hotel that is very central to anything you'd want in Dublin. Shopping centre 100 yards, temple Bar area less than 5 minutes, O'Connell street right round the corner etc. also bus stop for airport 100 yards away. As for hotel itself, very smart and people on reception very pleasant. Room modern and no problems. Not individual toiletries but dispensers as seems to be the case in a lot of hotels these days. My room was right next to doors which seemed to open and bang shut very regularly which was the only negative. Bar area was very nice and had a lovely Guinness there. Did not have breakfast or any food there so can not comment on that. Free wifi also.
 In summary if you are looking for a hotel that is easy to get to from airport (12 euro return on bus) and very central then you won't go far wrong with this one.",4,2015,02,25
231,excellent hotel in the centre of Dublin,"I recently stayed in Jury's Inn Parnell Street, as I was attending a work course, and when I had first heard I was booked in to Jury's Inn, I was a bit dubious, as I had a pre-concieved notion that Jury's Inn Hotels would all be very bland and basic, but boy was a I wrong.  The hotel is lovely, there is a large reception, and the staff were all very friendly, the rooms are lovely, the beds are really comfortable, I had a double and single bed in my room, and I brought my own pillow (as I am a bit odd about sharing pillows that other people have slept on, plus I usually find they are either too hard or too soft) but I need not have worried, as the pillows seemed to be fine, and there was loads of them, which was handy for watching telly.  The bathroom had all the mod cons, with the shower located inside the bath itself, and there was plenty of towels and shampoo/body wash etc., hot water was never an issue, and the breakfast in the hotel was lovely, plenty of fresh fruit, cereals and a buffet selection for hot food, which included the usual fare, and a coffee machine which produced surprisingly good coffee! what more could you ask for.  What impressed me the most though was the dinner, I had a voucher for €25 to be used each evening for my evening meal, so I literally tried everything on their menu, and I have to say it was a really good menu, which plenty of choice, and lovely food, generally cooked to perfection, and you would imagine that a week of hotel dinners would start to get boring or repetitive, but no, I have to say I thought their food was excellent, well done to the chefs.
All in all a lovely hotel, I had a quiet room, and I didn't have a bother all week whilst I stayed there.  There is a lift to all the floors which is handy, and the only niggle I would have is of course the old chestnut of parking, the hotel itself has no car park, so you have to park in Clery's car park in Cathal Brugha street, which was a few streets away, and the hotel offer a discounted overnight/daily rate of €10 which wouldn't be long clocking up over the course of the week, but it's Dublin and city centre so I guess parking is at a premium.  The hotel is very central, you literally came out the front door, turned left and then took the next immediate left which took you down along Moore street, where the traders sell the fresh fruit and veg and from that street you were literally on Henry St/O'Connell Street so it was very cental, literally five minutes to the city centre.  There is a lovely pub too just up from the hotel, called Parnell's bar and they have a lovely rooftop terrace, which was lovely (even in the winter!).  All in all, I enjoyed my stay, and I would certainly book here again.",5,2015,02,25
231,What a relief,"I had booked accommodations at the Charles Stewart Guest House and left (after seeing the room) so bad. Read that review. So there I was in Dublin wheeling my big suitcase down the street, unfamiliar with the city. Not sure what I was going to do. And then I saw it. The Jurys Inn on Parnell street. Feeling part vagabond, desperate and alone, I walked into the lobby. Not only did they have a room but it was a nice room. 5th floor. View of the city. Comfortable bed. Roomy. clean bathroom. The room was nicely furnished. Everything I wanted. Such a relief!! The breakfast was adequate. I have no complaints. None. Thank you Jurys Inn. You saved me!",4,2015,02,24

The rooms had tea and coffee making facilities, there was a vending and ice machine on our floor.. Very handy after a night out.. To come back and be able to get a cold bottle of water and chocolate was ideal! The staff were great.. We got to the hotel at half 8am, dropped off our cases and got a ticket and receipt and went out for the day, we then went back and they got our cases and we got our door key.

Needed to cut visit a little short  and was refunded the nights could not stay………EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE keep up the good work.  Look forward to staying at Jury' Parnell Square in the future,5,2015,02,24
231,Good Hotel if you get a deal,"We had a good deal through the website and at the price it was fantastic...not sure I'd have been as amazed if I'd paid a lot more but it was excellent value and very good stay generally. Location isn't the best but it's still no hassle and easily walkable to to main tourist parts of Dublin like trinity and temple bar

231,Great location,"Great hotel very central to get around all that Dublin has to offer.  Staff are very friendly, on each floor there is an ice machine which is a great wee perk, there are also vending machines which is handy.",5,2015,02,23
231,Break away,"Stayed in here at the weekend ...
Would I go back ....NO....
Our meal on sat night was bland the breakfast the next morning was being continually reheated ..
Watched as a member of staff took Bacon and other items to be put in a microwave .
We were told they had run out of 1/4 size bottles of wine but could offer us larger ones at 12 euro a go...
Disappointed is an understatement. ..",1,2015,02,23
231,Good base to explore Dublin.,"This hotel is nice and central to many of Dublin's key attractions. We stayed for two nights and managed to walk to all the areas of the city we wanted to visit.
The hotel is very clean and we found it very quiet. Triple glazed windows ensured noise from outside was kept out. 
The bed was a touch hard but everything else was brilliant. The rooms are well equipped and wifi coverage is very good.",4,2015,02,22
231,Lovely stay with fantastic service.,"Arrived at 10am knowing we couldn't check in til 2pm. However, they were very understanding and let us check in early.couldnt fault the service we had during our 3 night stay. Breakfast was fab and so much to choose from. Great location within walking distance of the river and all sights worth seeing. ",5,2015,02,22
231,Definitely be back,Stayed here for 1 night only check in quick and efficient  had tried to book their sister hotel in custom house square as we had stayed there before but fully booked  excellent rooms spotless buffet breakfast plentiful will be back stayed with my sister and daughter they will definitely return as well ,4,2015,02,21
231,Excellent location just off O'Connel street and helpful staff,"We travelled to the centre via the aircoach luxury bus, this dropped us off at O'Connell street and we were pleased with the short walk (about 3 minutes) to the hotel.
Upon arrival the reception staff were friendly and helpful and the reception was clean.
Our room was fine for our short stay, tea and coffee making facilities, iron, hairdryer and a TV.
During the first night's stay we could hear drilling and banging, with a few phone calls to reception the duty manager very courteously and promptly solved the issue. It was from a store near the hotel and not the hotel itself. Further to this we were awoken at 7.30 am by banging and hammering. When we phoned reception to complain once again the duty manager couldn't do enough to help. We were offered a new room and complimentary dinner.
We ate in the hotel's restaurant and we were thoroughly impressed. We both ordered the steak and it was cooked to perfection and tender. Great service as well.
We would happily stay again",5,2015,02,21
231,Ideal base for Dublin,"Stayed here on a Friday to Sunday break for Tradfest. Got a really good price for room only as we were flying home early Sunday morning so didn't see the need to book bed and breakfast for one morning only, and especially as, just across the road is a brilliant restaurant that does very reasonably priced breakfasts which include all you can drink tea and coffee!
The hotel is very well placed for the centre of Dublin, and within easy walking distance of the bus stop for buses from the airport. We had to get a taxi back to the airport as it was so early on Sunday, but it was only a 15 minute drive and cost us 20 euros, which wasn't too bad between 4 of us.
Our rooms weren't ready for us when we arrived, but we were very early, and it was no problem as we were able to store our luggage in a secure room whilst we went for breakfast. Both rooms were available on our return.
Receptionists were all very pleasant and helpful. The rooms were spotless and the bed was comfortable, and although we were in a room on the front of the building, so facing the main road, it was still quiet enough to get a good night's sleep, although because it was so cold outside we didn't have any of the windows open, so that could be a different story in hot weather. We were fortunate too not to be disturbed by any fellow guests, even though the hotel was busy, our only grumble was that our room was right next to a door on the corridor, which some guests did allow to slam during the night. If we'd been staying more than 2 nights we might have asked for a move, but by the second night of Temple Bar fun and refreshments we slept through anything!
We would definitely stay here again",5,2015,02,20
231,Good place to stay - right in the centre of the city.,"We stayed here for our first trip to Dublin and it turned out to be an excellent choice of hotel. It is perfectly placed to give the tourist a good base to explore the city from. It is within walking distance of all the main attractions and you are in the heart of the place.

The staff were all friendly and professional.  The room was quite adequate and quiet. The architect cleverly designed it so that the rooms face an inner quadrangle - so there is no noise from the passing traffic. Our room was quite adequate and comfortable. There was a bath with a shower  with plenty of hot water . The free Wi-Fi wasn't too fast but if you needed a fast connection you could pay extra for it. 

The food in the restaurant was very good and we thought it was well worth buying the breakfast and dinner package. The staff were helpful and friendly, Paulina being exceptionally so.  

It was easy to reach from the airport by public transport as the 747 bus drops you off in O’Connell Street and the hotel is just a short walk round the corner.

We would stay here again!",5,2015,02,19
231,In a handy place,"We arrived very early - 8.00am - to drop our bags but were pleasantly surprised to find our room was ready. Very clean and quiet, friendly and helpful staff and the restaurant was excellent - we had our dinner one night and found it reasonably priced. A little busy at breakfast but a good selection of food.
It's location is ideal - a quick walk round the corner to the hop on/off buses and airport shuttle, couldn't be handier.",5,2015,02,19
231,OK hotel but couldn't sleep,"This hotel is well situated not far from the Spire just off O'Connell Street. At the time we were there there were pretty major roadworks outside which were noisy but our room was at the back of the hotel facing inwards. We were disturbed by frequent slamming doors and groups of noisy young people in the corridors. There was a really strong smell of cigarette smoke in the room which seemed to come through the air conditioning into the bathroom. The room was very hot and you either had to have the aircon on 18+ degrees or not at all. Beds were hard, glasses were neither washed nor changed throughout our 3-night stay and we had to ask (twice) for extra towels as there were three of us in the room and only two towels. Food prices in the hotel restaurant were comparable to those outside, but don't have breakfast in the hotel- there's a nice little ""Centra"" deli supermarket just a minute's walk away which serves hot breakfast items, delicious fresh pastries, juices and fresh coffee for a fraction of the cost and you can sit and eat it in the store. There are several bars and restaurants near the hotel and the Kingfisher across the road does good take-away fish and chips.",3,2015,02,19
231,Central Location,"If you want a central location in Dublin, this will be it. Close by to main shopping/grocery area/district.
Affordable & presentable.
Staff were helpful, and rooms are clean & comfortable, decent size.",4,2015,02,19
231,Two night stay,This hotel is in a good central location. and reasonably priced.. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was clean and pleasant.. Bed was very comfortable.

231,Great experience,"The hotel was really good, the rooms where nice and clean and everything you needed was included. Bathroom was really clean, towels were large, soft and changed everyday. Location was good everything walking distance.",4,2015,02,18
231,Terrible sleep,"Came here based on a good deal from Jury's Inn, can't fault the staff they were lovely, and the room was clean.

However, when it came to sleeping we had a terrible time. Got in to bed adn realised the heating was on way too high - finally worked out the thermostat and it wouldn't allow us to take it lower than 18 degrees. Boiling in the room!

So windows were opened (obviously this did let in some noise) and we thought we would be fine, especially after a full day of travel and sight seeing we were so tired we thought we'd sleep no matter what!

Woke up after an hour or so as the room was just too hot. Bed was really uncomfortable and pillows were rock hard - once awake I struggled to get back to sleep at all, while my boyfriend tossed and turned until eventually fully waking up at 6:45am and not getting back to sleep (no lie in then) 

Because of the heater the air felt dry which was unpleasant, and the bed sheets felt starchy, must be something they wash them with.",2,2015,02,17
231,"Well done, keep it up","The staff were friendly, the atmosphere was good, the bar staff and food was very good. Hope to come back and stay for a longer period. The room was good and large, plenty of room to move around. The beds were clean and comfortable. 
              ",4,2015,02,16
231,Highly Recommened!,"Myself and 17 friends stayed here on Valentine's weekend! A clean hotel each and every room was of the same immaculate standard. The bed was comfortable, There was spare pillows and blankets available. Staff couldn't do enough to help! Outside the entrance was a Tesco and KFC and a cash point ideally situated! 20 minute taxi ride €5 from Dublin airport! Topped off an absolutely fantastic weekend at a must see city!! Would definetly stay at a Jury inn again!",5,2015,02,16
231,Pleasant and smooth stay,"Had a very satisfactory stay at the hotel.  The location is very good and the hotel has a pleasant decor, with staff very nice and friendly.  They had also very kindly changed our no cancellation booking for free some weeks before our stay,  when we gave them a valid reason.  Would have appreciated if there were scales somewhere to weigh our luggage.

231,Excellent hotel ,"Great location, comfy beds, clean rooms, attentive staff, nice bar - what more do you want - lovely hotel.  We arrived early but they kept our cases in a locked room for us. 

If you stay here try the Parnell heritage bar and grill a few doors down from hotel - beautiful food there.",5,2015,02,15
231,Great hotel for a good night's sleep,"Ideal for business or family.  Clean, quiet room with the best black out blinds I've seen.  Bed was comfy.  We didn't eat at the hotel as it is a short walk from the centre and there are other breakfast options nearby.   We'd stay again. 
      
      
      
      ",5,2015,02,12
231,Very pleasant stay,"Very close to all amenities and a clean hotel.

The bar could be so good but the bar staff we met thought when you wanted orange in a Jack Daniels he was going to pour in Orange squash! Also didn't know what a single malt was.

Good reception staff and would go back again.",4,2015,02,12
231,Lovely Stay,First trip to Dublin and I must say The Jury's Inn Parnell St was an excellent choice everything from check in went smoothly. Lovely clean Hotel with excellent decor and staff go above and beyond. Will definitely recommend and will return without a doubt. ,5,2015,02,12
231,A Dublin gem,"This is a good hotel in a handy location in Dublin.  You are within easy walking distance of shopping areas, bars and restaurants.  It's only a 10 to 15 minute stroll to Temple Bar on the other side if the river.  It's an even easier walk to the main tram lines and the main railway station.  We found our rooms to be a decent size and the bathrooms were really clean. A really good feature for us was the excellent buffet breakfast.  A great choice of food and very helpful and obliging staff.  For a budget type hotel this is well worth considering.  Excellent value for money on the deal we had.
 ",5,2015,02,11
231,City break,"I stayed at Jurys Inn Parnell Street with my girlfriend for a weekend. The hotel is centrally located with walking distance to all the amenities including shopping malls, bars and restaurants. Hotel is generally clean and rooms are comfortable. The staff seemed very friendly and helpful. After checking out they still allowed us to leave the luggage for few hours as we wanted to enjoy Dublin before going to the airport. Hotel offers everything you need for reasonable price. Would I stay again? Absolutely! Looking forward to the next stay. ",4,2015,02,11
231,Simply wonderful,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Dublin for his 21st birthday. 3/02/15 - 06/02/15. Not a bad thing to say about this hotel. Perfect location to the airport, Guinness storehouse, Jameson's whiskey distillery, Trinity College, Grafton street - absolutely anything you want to see, this location is perfect. The only transport we had to use was a bus to and from the airport which was 6 euros single way- everything is in walking distance. We arrived at the hotel 1 hour too early before check in but we were allowed to go up asap which was great! We loved our room, not a single complaint. Quiet, cosy and we slept wonderfully which says something as I am a terrible sleeper! Housekeeping staff are friendly and polite. The room is cleaned every day, fresh towels, bins emptied and bed made. Receptionist were always happy to help and friendly. Hand on heart we were so upset to leave.",4,2015,02,10
231,Great value,"Great location. Called to hotel to leave in bags an hour before check in time and were able to check in. Hotel was warm and clean. Good bar. Were able to leave bags there after check out till we were to get train.

231,Great Hotel !,"This hotel was perfect for our stay in Dublin ! 

Great access to everything, town centre a two minute walk & the rooms were lovely. We arrived at 10am when check in was not until 2pm but the receptionist did not hesitate to let us into our room early, amazing service from her (tues 3rd if anyone wants to pass on the feedback). 

The rooms were lovely, no complaints what so ever amazing value for money. Will be recommending to friends & family :)",5,2015,02,10
231,A perfect location for a City Centre Break.,"I am in my early 50s and I stayed with my wife in Jurys Inn for one night on the 07/02/15. I was a little unsure as I had slightly unfavourable reviews. But I can honestly say the room was perfect, spotless clean, bright and airy. The reception staff were curtuous and efficient. The location was very accessible for the luas and parking was (separate €15 overnight charge). I would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2015,02,09
231,our stay in jurys,"perfect location, friendly checkin staff. the room was perfect we did request  interconnecting rooms but didn't get it but our rooms were next to each other which was fine. we have stayed here before and will stay again. ",5,2015,02,09
231,Family trip,Stayed here for a weekend with family all got rooms close together when checking in. Reception staff really friendly and quick. Hotel was clean and our room had a view across the city. We got the airlink bus from the airport and the stop was a 2 min walk round the corner. The hotel was in the perfect place for bars attractions and shopping. Also temple bars were a 10 min walk away. Would defiantly visit dublin again beautiful and friendly place. I'd come back and stay at this jurys inn again. ,5,2015,02,09
231,Great hotel a stones throw from O'Connell Street,"Firstly the hotel is easy to get to from the airport using the AirLink 747 bus service, it's even marked on the bus map. The stop on O'Connell Street is only a couple minutes walk to the hotel.

Our arrival was earlier then expected and was shocked they actually let us book in that early (around 11am) without being charged like other similar brands. The receptionist (Eva) was very friendly, and was accommodating when I cheekily asked for a room with a view. As I have dietary requirements the receptionist informed me of all the potential allergens that could affect me, which was great.

Our room (see the photos) is a little on the small side, though it being a city centre location I wouldn't expect a huge room. The shower though was an issue as it was very tight for me (think rugby player build) so every time I turned I would hit the door thus opening it.

Unlike in other similar hotel chains, this hotel has a phone in the room (you need to give your credit card details for outside access), and when I needed more coffee & milk it was a quick phone call away...

There is an iron & ironing board in each room which was handy, and certainly in my room was a proper iron and not a 'travel' iron.

There are a couple of spare pillows above the wardrobe and the bed was very comfortable, and the doubles are roomy and not cramped.

We stayed 3 nights, and on each of the days the room was cleaned to a good standard and towels replaced.

The bar was welcoming and quiet in the evening, and it was enjoyable to sit in there with a pint of Guinness after an evening out.

The restaurant was to me the only disappointment of the stay, seemed there was only one person working at breakfast. If you're a strict vegetarian or someone with dietary requirements, the buffet breakfast is probably not something you should go for. Normally I would expect the meat and the rest to be separated so not to contaminate, not here, it's all in one area, no order to the serving tongs or spoons so people just use the same tong/spoon across the whole buffet. So I ended up having scrambled egg on toast. Also, you don't get a choice of semi-skimmed and whole milk, only whole milk was provided.

In terms of shops around the hotel, there is a Tesco express opposite the hotel for essentials, but the two main shopping centres are within 5 mins walk.

Other all I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Dublin.",4,2015,02,09
231,Brilliant!,"I needed just one night in a hotel near to the city centre, and chose this one. I was very pleased to have done so. The location was just right; the staff were very friendly; check-in and check-out were very efficient; the breakfast was lovely - lots of choice and a pleasant dining room in which to eat.",5,2015,02,07
231,very good experience,"The room was exactly what I needed, fairly spacious, comfortable, clean and quiet. Bathroom 10/10. Breakfast excellent, both hot and cold options. I noted there was no fridge in the room (but I didn't need one)",5,2015,02,06
231,GOOD Position to move in the city and to the airport.,"Room was very silence and good for sleep.

Cannot comment on dining or bar experience as we ate out.  However, the only disapointing part was the breakfast.  Great selection of food, but it was luke warm, not helped with being served on cold plates.  However, overall excellent stay and would definately recommend it.",5,2015,02,03

231,perfect place to stay,"I stayed at this hotel from 23-25th January 2015.The hotel is decorated in a lovely contemporary style and all areas are spotlessly clean.The staff are friendly and helpful in reception bar and restaurant.We had breakfast in the hotel both mornings and it was fantastic.There was a great choice of fruit,cereals,porridge,cooked food and pastries.(The scones are fantastic).The location is also ideal-2 minutes from where the airport bus drops you off and near everything you could want to see.I would recommend this hotel to everyone and will stay again myself.",5,2015,01,26

Lots to do in the town centre which is all within walking distance from the hotel. Would recommend to anyone and will definitely be going back. ,5,2015,01,25
231,Well located bed in a box,"This hotel is cheap for city centre Dublin and in a good location. Rooms are clean and staff are helpful. That is about as exciting as this review gets I'm afraid: the room we were in was small and very dark, even with all the lights on. Breakfast is ok but not a relaxing experience, with a free for all at the serve yourself counters. We ordered some fiz from the bar for the room which didn't arrive (staff were very apologetic and removed it from the bill). 

If you want a well located bed in Dublin this place is fine. I generally like Jurys Inns but this was not one of the better ones. ",3,2015,01,25
231,"Superb hotel, fantastic city!","Cannot fault the hotel it was superb! first impressions were very good, the front desk staff were approachable and helpful.
No onsite parking, nearest car park was 15e per 24hrs, not the cheapest but It was worth not having to figure out the one way system to the concession car park.
The room was lovely - Courtyard facing which is nice to look at. Very quiet - perfect!
Hotel security is very good we were on the 2nd floor and needed our room key 3 times to get to it.
Night Porters were efficient and friendly.
Hotel is close to many tourist attractions and O'Connell street. Will stay again! Recommended to friends and family whom are visiting the city.",5,2015,01,24
231,A great start to a great weekend,"We arrived in Dublin centre around 9:30 am.  Bit of bad navigation to get to the hotel but eventually we found it (our mistake).  We decided to go to the hotel to drop off our bags (we only took hand luggage on our Ryan Air flight) but as check-in was after 2 pm, we were not sure of how helpful they would be.  To my surprise, the receptionist was super friendly and helpful.  She told us that if the room was available then we could check in.  Over 4 hours early.  We were checked in by around 10am.  She did warn us there was a slight issue with the hot water but they were looking to resolve it ASAP.  When we did return to the hotel, it was working fine.  Dublin itself was very cold and windy but the hotel nice and snug + warm.

The rooms were large, clean and comfortable.  Wifi available throughout the whole stay too.  

Check out was very smooth too.

Hotel was across the road from a nice food place (Kingfisher) where we went for breakfast.  There was a nice pub around the corner.  A Tesco across the road too.  Plus, the coach for the airport around the corner on O'Connell street.  Temple bar area around 15 minute walk past the river.  
Would stay here again if ever in Dublin.",5,2015,01,21
231,meeting with friends,"was okay. I was happy and content with my very brief stay at Juries in Parnell st. Dubliln.  I frequently stay there, it is so close to the city centre.  I did find it a little expensive but after all it was Friday night.  I will stay there again when in Dublin

231,Brilliant location,"The hotel is located a 5 minute walk from all the bars, restaurants and shops as well as many tourist attractions.
The room was of a high standard and had everything we needed for our 3 night stay. We didn't eat at the hotel but the bar was reasonably priced and bar staff were welcoming.
Only negative was the initial welcome where a member of the reception staff was quite snappy and rude when we were checking in. But we didn't see her again and all the other staff were very helpful. Would recommend this hotel ",5,2015,01,18
231,Fantastic!,"This place is absolutely fantastic! Modern, spotless, enormous room, all mod cons. Couldn't find any fault whatsoever. I didn't have the breakfast however, as I prefer to stroll off through Dublin and eat in a cafe instead. The location is also stunning. Right around the corner from O'Connell Street, Moore Street and Henry Street. Also right around the corner is the bus to the airport – either Aircoach or the normal Dublin Bus route, number 16. It is an absolute joy to be able to just walk out the door and be right in the middle of Dublin. Would always stay here in future.",5,2015,01,16

231,Nearly Perfect,"After extensive searching, a British friends chose this hotel for our shared 3-night, 2-day getaway to Dublin.  Her choice could not have been better.

The location is wonderful for playing tourist in the city.  Shopping, landmarks, restaurants, nightlife and major public transportation stops are all within easy walking distance.  

The hotel itself is modern and either quite new or rather recently renovated.  Our rooms were large, clean, comfortable, attractively decorated and usefully furnished.  Mattresses and linens were comfortable but three of the four in our little group commented that the pillows were too plump and firm for their taste.  (I learned long ago to travel with my own bed pillow.)   Baths were large, clean and well appointed.

The common areas were attractive and comfortably furnished.  Excellent use of the color violet in decorating created an especially calm and soothing environment.

The buffet breakfast was good.  You can purchase breakfast vouchers upon check-in for one Euro less than the on-the-spot price.  We only purchased vouchers for one morning as a ""see what it's like"" thing.  The breakfast was highly acceptable so I suggest buying as many vouchers as you intend to use for the duration upon arrival.  

The bar staff was especially friendly.  The bar selection was good and the pricing was actually lower than nearly every pub/bar/restaurant we visited.

We ate one dinner in the hotel.  Our little group of two couples have traveled together for a few years now to a six different countries.  Two are rather picky eaters.  I have never before seen all of our plates completely empty.  It was also the least expensive restaurant we visited for dinner.  Both the food and service were very good.  The menu is not huge, but it is highly varied.  I highly recommend the restaurant for dinner--it is not the sort of hotel restaurant that you merely settle for after a long day touring or working!

Off-season (mid-January) pricing found a nearly too-good-to-be-true value.",5,2015,01,15
231,very central,I enjoyed my stay here the rooms were clean and beds comfortable. the food in the restaurant was beautiful the nicest steak I had in a long time.  The drink was very expensive and as the place was being redecorated there was no atmosphere to encourage us to stay drinking there so we went to our rooms and had a good night.,4,2015,01,15
231,Lovely,"Stayed here few times and I can't say one bad thing... Rooms are lovely and spacious, bar food is delicious, noise is non existent which is shock in city centre... Will continue to stay there. Room was spotless, bathroom was spacious and not cramped, staff at reception are always friendly and helpful.",5,2015,01,13
231,The perfect venue for a short stay in Dublin!,"We were pleased to find the hotel was just a short walk from the recommended airport coach transfer. In fact, the hotel is centrally located for most of Dublin's tourist attractions and landmarks. After an early flight we were surprised and delighted that a room was already available for us, hours before the usual 2pm check in. However there is a room for baggage if needs be. The room was spacious and clean with ample facilities.",5,2015,01,13

Receptionists were very helpful and friendly when it came to recommendations about attractions, directions and taxis etc. 
Great location, right by the aircoach stop on o'connel street from the airport and only about a ten minute walk from temple bar and all the main bars/restaurants. Great shopping street and indoor centre is close by too. 
Very reasonably priced, would definitely recommend adding on breakfast as eating out is fairly pricy and the buffet includes a huge choice of hot items, cereal, fruit and yoghurt etc - great for filling up for a day out!

Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet but central location and will definitely stay here again.",5,2015,01,13
231,"Handy hotel, nice, clean, well presented","Stayed here for 1 night in December 2014. The lobby is very well presented, with helpful staff on the front desk.  Staff helped us to locate various items within the city, including bus stops and eating places. The room itself was bright & clean.  THe bathroom was compact, but totally sufficient (shower over bath).  Shower water pressure was good.  The street outside is quite busy, but there was very little road noise.  Might be an issue if you are very noise sensitive, but I found it fine. Desk area was useful for doing small amounts of work, but would be a bit small if you wanted to do a lot of work from the hotel room.
Breakfast was very good, with a wide selection of foods, including vegetarian/vegan options.",4,2015,01,13

It is very central, being locsted at the top end of O Connell Street.

Very efficient and they were happy to call ahead to the restaurant to make us a booking. The rooms were well appointed. Very clean and spacious.
We ate in the restaurant and were again very impressed. We each tried something different. Everything was fresh and thankfully hadn't been microwave prepared - the children's menu being particularly good value at €5.95 including drink, main and desert. 
Breakfast was also great and quite reasonable at €9 per adult if booked before with children 12 and under eating for free.
The only thing I would recommend they add would be some sort of opaque privacy curtain in the rooms - you can't have the curtains open unless you want everyone to be able to look into your room. 
Great staff, great food, great rooms - there is nothing not to like! ",5,2015,01,12

Recommend in every way",5,2015,01,11
231,Fiancées 30th,"We stayed here from the 9th to 11th January as a last minute break for my fiancees 30th birthday and we were not disappointed.The hotel has a brilliant location a short taxi ride away from the airport and is within walking distance of all the wonderful attractions Dublin has to offer as well as newsagents and the main shopping centre. 

The hotel was lovely,very welcoming staff who couldn't do enough to help,clean rooms with coffee making facilities and comfortable beds and the food was fantastic. I am so pleased that we chose this hotel as our base. it always has taxis outside as well which was perfect for us as the weather was how you would expect for early January!

For anyone thinking of visiting the jury's inn I would highly recommend it and I'd also highly recommend Dublin.There is a lot to see and do. And although I was worried after many people saying how expensive it is there,I didn't find it that bad at all,it's typical to any city you visit and of course depends on the strength of the euro.

Just a few extra bits to do with visiting Dublin...
The taxi ride to the hotel from the airport was about 27 euro,and the cabs are easy to find and signposted as soon as you get into the airport.You can find cheaper taxis back once you get into Dublin.Places we visited included the Guinness factory which is well worth a visit and priced at around 18 euro per adult.Its worth going even if your not a big Guinness drinker because the 7th level of the building has the Gravity Bar where you get your complimentary drink with 360 views overlooking Dublin.We also visited the National Leprechaun Museum which although was originally for novelty value was well worth a visit as the tour guide we had was fantastic and really brought Irish mythology to life. I would also highly recommend the temple bar area and especially the temple bar where there is normally some kind of Irish music on and it's a lovely traditional pub,but beware it gets very busy in there (in fact in all of the 
temple bar area) so head there for early doors if you prefer it a little quieter. Shopping is typically what you would find in any city, with some gift 
shops thrown in and well worth a wonder around.",5,2015,01,11
231,Fantastic visit,"Great quality, great price, great service. Arrived on Saturday earlier then check in time. The receptionist got us a room straight away and had the house keeper bring up extra towels. The house keeper was up instantly with extra bits for us. Room was clean and spacious. Beds were comfortable, I spelt like an angel.

231,Good choice of Hotel,"We arrived much earlier than check-in time and asked to leave our bags, the receptionist checked and told us our room was ready and we could check in straight away. We had not booked breakfast but decided to do so and it was very good, so much choice so we were very pleased we had chosen to eat there.
Room was very comfy and lots of desk space, beds also very comfortable. Nice bathroom with bath and shower.
The only problem was the room key would not work the lift every time we used it but that may have been down to us. When we checked out we left luggage to collect on our way back to the airport.
We would stay here again.",5,2015,01,10
231,Short trip,"Hotel was fantastic and very central easy to get to from the airport. We purchased a return ticket on our flight for 10 euros well worth it.

231,Fab hotel in a great spot,"This was a great hotel within 10/15 minutes walk over the river Liffy to Temple bar & Grafton Street. The check in was simple and the rooms exceptionally clean and spacious and the beds so comfortable you didnt want to get out of them. We had bed & breakfast and breakfast was plentiful and very tasty...from cereal, fruit cold meats & yoghurt to a full Irish but avoid 9-9.30 as it gets busy betwenn these times. We did have a problem with the heating in our room as the room was cold but once reported to reception it was dealt with swiftly and when we returned from our evening meal we returned to a warm cosy room. Bar prices in the hotel no different from the pubs in town about 12 Euros for a pint of Guinness & vodka & coke. The restaurant directly across the road served fab food & if you turn left out of the hotel and walk a few minutes there is a lovely Italian on the corner. Take the train to Bray for a day at the seaside or to  Howth for a trip to the Harbour and wonderful fish restaurants.",5,2015,01,07

231,really recommend,"Stayed here for a three day Two night vacation, on arrival we were very impressed, we arrived early morning, approx 8am, we never expected to be able to check in, but would of liked to have left our luggage, after enquiring at check in we were able to have our room, which was great as it meant we could freshen up before exploring, we had a superior room, which was lovely, we had complimentary bottled water, biscuits, a newspaper left as well as vouchers for a free costa coffee each from the bar, and a 10% discount on meals bought from restaurant.
Breakfast was included in the price we paid and was plentiful and nice.
We also had a late check out with the superior room and were able to leave our bags safe whilst we were waiting to fly back, so i do recommend booking superior. 
The hotel was a short walk from all top attractions, but quiet enough, away from the hustle n bustle. I would definitely use this hotel again.",5,2015,01,05

Hotel staff were friendly and food from the bar was lovely. Breakfast got a little crowded at times and popular items were not always replenished immediately but this is a minor quibble. There are nice pubs, take away restaurants and cinema all within a 5 minute walk of the hotel, as is a pick up point for the recommended   hop-on hop-off city sightseeing bus. Drop off point for the Aircoach shuttle from the airport is also just around the corner",4,2014,12,30

This went on I couldn't settle the kids so I rang reception. The noise levels went on till after 330am slamming doors. Absolutely pointless saying anything at reception as d told me de were sorry dats no good to me or my kids wen u don't get a nights sleep. ,1,2014,12,22
231,Ideal base for exploring Dublin!,"Jurys Inn, Parnell Street was located in a good position within Dublin with easy access to the local transport links. The nearby O'Connell Street was the main drop off and pickup for the city buses (and airport buses) and very busy with taxis at all hours.

The hotel is also only a short walk (10/15mins) from the river and the famous temple bar area.

The hotel and its rooms were a very good standard, and everyone in my party had a comfortable and pleasant stay.",5,2014,12,22
231,Excellent!!,Had a wonderful stay back in October. I wanted to do my review earlier but I forgot. The reception staff were brilliant and moved me to a second floor room instead of a fifth floor room. It was done immediately. Lovely room and very comfortable. Definitely staying here again.,5,2014,12,21
231,Cheap clean modern hotel in excellent location,"Bar and restaurant being done up when there but could not fault it. £45 quid a night on various websites for December and Jan but worthy of double. Officially a 3 star but would up it to 4. Spotless rooms, large and comfy beds. Ironing stuff in room and bathroom great. Highly recommended - only 5 minutes from Temple Bar. Loads of supermarkets nearby and close to main shopping district.",5,2014,12,19
231,Nothing Fancy or over the top,"Good value and clean spacious accommodation, friendly helpful reception. Good choice of breakfast till 10.00am . Well situated for easy walking access to Dublin's fair city, even in the rain!. Mid day check out at 12 noon ideal. You can leave your luggage in the security lock up for those catching an evening flight.",4,2014,12,19
231,Good price and good location,"We stayed here for two nights mainly because the rate was such good value.  Only later did we find out that it's also just around the corner from the Aircoach bus stop to/from the Airport.  The bar renovation mentioned elsewhere is now complete and the bar is really quite comfy and reasonably priced, we had excellent hot chocolate.  The room was a normal size for this type of hotel in Europe with a good shower and comfortable bed.  The only downside for us was breakfast.  It ends at 10am and while perhaps a dozen or more people were still eating all of the food was taken away.  It would have been nice to at least have been asked if we wanted anything else before clearing the breakfast buffet!  The food itself was fine.  Overall though we would stay here again and recommend this hotel to you.  ",4,2014,12,19
231,Good location.,"Stayed here as a group of 12 men and wasn't disappointed. It took approx 25mins from the airport having chosen to take a taxi instead of the local bus. Taking the bus would've taken approx twice as long as it went all over the place !
€20 was the cost and quite frankly, it was worth it due to the rush hour traffic we were caught up in.

The reception was clean and spacious and it didn't take to long before our credit card details were verified and we were given our swipe cards. Remember to take these room cards with you, wherever you go, because you require these to access the lifts to get to your rooms.

The rooms are spacious, clean and have sufficient space to hang your clothes. It's basic in its decor but it does exactly what it says on the tin !
There are complimentary shower gels and shampoo located in the shower, which is situated over the bath. It's ideal for a few nights.
Breakfast was included in our booking at a cost of €10. This was an all you could eat buffet with a good choice should you choose the good old 'full English' or the healthier option !
There is also a bar selling a good variety of drinks especially 'top shelf' and isn't over priced.
The price for this hotel varies, but not by much, depending on who/where you book through and whether breakfast is included or not ?? It was approx £185 for 3 nights, which included breakfast, for two of us in the one room.

The hotel is located approx 20min walk from the Temple Bar area, though it is quite expense in these bars.......tourist rates etc.....
You can also easily walk to the Jamesons distillery, waxwork museum and a little further to the Guiness factory.....all worth a visit.
If you enjoy just going out for a walk and taking it in turns which direction you wish to take, you won't be disappointed ? This way, you can sample what you like, when you like and whether you intend to return to dine later in the evening. The choice is yours.

If like us, you've booked a late flight back home, the hotel will keep your bags in a secure room and you can collect them later. We chose this option and arranged to have the taxi collect us from there to take us back to the airport.

Dublin is quite expensive, shame really, but if you go there with that in mind, you shouldn't be to disappointed. It's like any other touristy area, if you go out and about, you will find cheaper drinks and gifts and it all adds to your experience.

If it helps.......I've booked to go back for another 3 nights soon, taking my wife this time. I know she'll enjoy it and hopefully she'll take her purse !!

Rooms give you enough room to spread out and the bathroom was modern. Views weren't great, but we spent the day out and about so didn't matter. Rooms were extremely quiet and the black out curtains were great for getting a good nights sleep. Only problem we did have was on the last couple of nights an awful smell of sewage seemed to come into our room. Didn't mention to the front desk as it was our last day, but meant our last night of sleep was ruined- not great when you have to get up at 5am! Other than that we had a lovely stay and would return.

231,Everything about this hotel feels cheap,"As the title suggests, this place has a cheap feel to it, down to the unfinished restaurant, cheap ingredients used for breakfast and low quality food served in the bar. Check in not particularly pleasant (rude) though check-out was nice. On the plus side, bathroom was clean, bed comfy and wifi good. ",3,2014,12,03
231,All pretty average,"Jury's Inn Parnell Street is our usual haunt when visiting Dublin. We've always found it to be a good value base for any trip to the Irish capital. The location's great. It's near enough to the centre of town to be convenient for everything, but far enough out of the main hustle and bustle to be relatively quiet. And this visit pretty much ticked the boxes.

The rooms are clean, tidy and of a good size. The air conditioning system still has a mind of its own and comes on at will throughout the day and night. Whilst I'm sure this is a benefit during the long hot summer, in November it's not so welcome. Our room looked out over the central courtyard which worked well to keep traffic and pedestrian noise at bay. Unfortunately it doesn't do much to keep late night revellers at bay in the hotel and as a result Saturday lacked somewhat in the sleep department for me. Sometimes I do think hotels could do more to patrol this sort of disruption for guests.

Our only real gripe with the hotel this time around was in the restaurant. We'd paid for bed and breakfast rate but something hadn't come through on the system and despite my husband showing our confirmation email every single day to show we'd paid for breakfast, every single day staff insisted the email was wrong. As it was breakfast wasn't all that great. The selection was decent enough but the cooked selection was greasy and failed Mrs Muffin81's scrambled eggs test miserably. The breakfast area was busy regardless of time of the morning and much of the time getting to the danish pastries was like getting through the crowds on Grafton Street.

Overall, it hasn't dented my faith in the Jury's Inn brand, and I'd still recommend it for anyone wanting a cheap and cheerful hotel for a quick stop over in the city, but perhaps we'd have a think about a change of scenery next time.",3,2014,12,02
231,Bar drinks typically expensive for a hotel.,"Breakfast was late in arriving, which was a bit of a pain as I had an early-ish flight. Bar was expensive - but then it is a hotel.  Everything else was fine.  Helpful staff that smile and make life easy is always appreciated, and a smile seems to be the Jury badge of office, I like it.

231,Friendly stay at Jurys Parnell Street,"As always - a very friendly and welcoming stay at Jurys. A special word of thanks to the reception and cleaning staff. They could not be more welcoming.
The room had been recently renovated and was spotlessy clean. The shower was very relaxing. 
The soundproofing was excellent and we were not aware of any road / traffic noise. The location is also very central and it was only a short walk to all the restaurants and bars of Temple Bar.
We had not booked breakfast so we ate at the Kingfisher Restaurant - directly across the road. The value her was excellent also.

The hotel - Great Location near top of O'Connoll street easy access to all of Dublin as well as public transport to the Airport.  Others have covered what is in the area so I will not elaborate.  The Room was spotless, looked refurbished and was at the rear of the hotel facing the courtyard so was very quiet. IT was a modern well equipped room.   Staff were very helpful, stored bags on arrival and when leaving.  No complaints whatsoever.

For the first 2 days my room was nicely cleaned but somehow the cleaners always missed taking away my food tray from last night. On the 3rd night I saw that my room was half cleaned with a glass being left in the wash basin. That sight really put me off and hence the low ratings.

Definite recommend",5,2014,11,28
231,Business course,"I was sent on a course in Dublin and this hotel was one of the nearest hotels to the course site. 
So the location was very central for Dublin and ideal for the course. The hotel very clean and comfortable. The food we got was of a good standard and I have no complaints with it at all. Staff where friendly. Breakfast was a buffet. The bar was been done up and so we where confined to a temporary bar set up in the restaurant.   But for a tourist this hotel has a great central location for shopping and other sites as it just of O'Connell street. The only draw back I was at the front of the hotel and the local deliveries start at 6am. So if your light sleeper be aware of this",4,2014,11,28
231,Does the job,"We stayed at the Jury's Inn for two nights as we were looking for a reliable hotel in the City Centre that was not too noisy at night, and we were not disappointed. While the hotel will not win an award for cosiness or amenities, it provides great value for money, very clean rooms and a great location without the noise and the crazyness of other places in the City Centre. It is just a short stroll from O'Connell Street and yet for that location the rooms are quiet at night which allows for a good night sleep. The bed was comfortable and the room comes with the typical toiletries and kettle, which is nice.

Breakfast is decent, although you should try to avoid the rush hour between 9 and 10 am as the room could get crowded.

We had dinner at the Bar one night and were very positively surprised. The quality of the food was really great and the staff was very friendly. 

In general our stay was a pleasant experience and we can definitely recommend the Jury's Inn to those who are looking for an affordable place in the City with no frills.",4,2014,11,27
231,Birthday treat weekend,"I recently visited Dublin with 10 friends and we stayed at the Jury's Inn, Parnell Street.  The welcome we received was amazing from the reception to the concierge.

Jurys Inn, Parnell Street is so close to the shops, Temple Bar and a bus outside the door to where ever you would like to go.",5,2014,11,26
231,GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY,"A really enjoyable experience....we stay there every year and have no plans to change.   We do not use the restaurant and used the bar only once.

231,Great Place on Parnell,"I was in Dublin for some sightseeing - the Jury's Inn was a very pleasant surprise even though the other Trip Advisor reviews were very good - I am happy to agree.  Renovations are still in process, but the workers were very polite and conscious of the guests.  

The Room: simple, comfortable and big enough as I wasn't staying in the room.  Small improvement could be done on the pillow quality - but I slept just fine.  

The staff were all very friendly.  I only ate breakfast at the hotel as I was only in town for 2 nights - breakfast was plentiful - there appears to be a lack of standard work for placement of milk, bread as it changed from Monday to Tuesday to I wandered around a bit more - but no big deal.

A few of the better restaurants/pubs in Dublin are in a short walking distance from the hotel. Tesco and Lidl are just out the door too if you need them.

I would stay hear again next time I came to Dublin center.",5,2014,11,24
231,"Excellent hotel, pity about the food & service","Stayed midweek at this hotel in November 2014 for leisure purposes. Room was very nice, not too small and comfortable bed with good TV channels. Big plus was being able to control the temperature of the room. Water and ice machine in the hall was a great added touch. Major downside was the food. Waited 20 minutes to be approached by a member of staff - who didn't even look at us while he took our order just cleaned down the table next to us. Starters arrived 45 minutes later (over-cooked) which meant we had to rush our main course to leave at our planned time to go to an event. No apology and was looked at disapprovingly when asked what was taking so long. Worst customer service I have ever witnessed at a hotel and put a bad spin on the stay.",4,2014,11,24

The room was of a very good size and was very good value for money based on the location. I was worried it would be noises with it being right in the center but we didn't hear a noise at all the whole stay it was brilliant! 

The hotel is located right in the middle of town with only a 5-10minute walk to temple bar for all the bars and entertainment. There are plenty of shops and restaurants near the hotel so no need to go too far.

231,Dublin Fab - hotel pro's & con's!,"The hotel is in a slightly 'rougher' area than tourists should probably frequent, however its excellent walking distance to EVERYTHING, so cant really complain about that! The hotel was having some maintenance work done when we stayed, so felt a bit scruffy on arrival, the reception area inst particularly appealing either with a real lack of ambiance and welcome... but we weren't in Dublin for that, so if you're not fussy, then this hotel is a very comfortable stay with friendly staff and good location! If you haven't already paid for breakfast, then have it at The Kingfisher which is opposite the hotel, hearty Irish grub! The breakfast restaurant is rather drab, so don't bother paying the extra. Fitzgerald's, O'Donnough's and Palace 21 are all great pubs that are worth a visit, and are located slightly on the borders into the Temple Bar area, which can be a bit tacky but we found some gems, if you make the effort to search for something a little less obvious. All in all, The Jury's Inn was a good base for experience this fab City - Loved it!! x",3,2014,11,21
231,Superb; will be back,"What a great hotel.  Location is excellent, staff are very nice, rooms are spotless, food is fab.  Check in was quick and easy.  Our room was facing in to their courtyard so it was really quiet with no street noise.  The room was small, but really nice.  Hot water is scarce; the shower was just about hot enough (at the hottest setting) at 6pm but no such luck for my morning shower; there was no hot water by 11am.  But it still doesn't detract from the great hotel it is.  We ate in the bar; it was one of the nicest meals I've EVER had!!  I had the Indian vegetable curry; I would highly recommend; delicious.

231,Jury's verdict - guilty of causing weight gain! 😀,"My wife and I spent 3 nights here in November '14.    We were made very welcome.

The hotel was having a quick paint facelift inside which caused us no problems whatsoever and was also a nice colour 😊

Our room was upgraded to Superior which was a nice gesture, this got my paper delivered in the morning, it would also have given me 10% discount on my hotel spending had I so wished - just by leaving my credit card details at reception as I had paid in advance I didn't bother as we only had a few drinks and one meal in the hotel.   But would be a great saving for someone paying after their stay, 10% off accommodation, drinks and meals!

Our room was pleasant with a very comfy bed, nice and clean with the usual tea/coffee facilities.  A soft drinks vending machine and ice machines were on every floor for our convenience.   Another big plus is the free Wifi throughout the hotel.

The staff could not have been nicer!   Very pleasant and helpful throughout our stay.

However my problem is I have gained weight 😄   The breakfast was the culprit!   What a breakfast!   Buffet style with an immense choice and I choose lots!   The breakfast did us for all day till dinner.   Saved us buying a lunch when we were out.

We had dinner in the hotel the first night and it was lovely, I had a steak which was cooked perfectly, or in my case probably uncooked properly would be more like it 😜

231,OK Hotel - but don't rely on wake up calls or pre-booked taxis,"I stayed here twice in two weeks. The first time for just a night the second for 2 nights.

Both rooms were adquate with blankets on the beds vs duvets. The rooms were clean, fresh towels, and bed comfortable. The TV was reasonable size and viewable from teh bed. A SINGE desk level power point. And FREE WIRELESS *YEAH*.

The downside was their inability to get little things like wake up calls, and taxis right. NONE of the wake up calls came. The first night was a disaster as a result - I over slept and was half an hour late to my customer. The second visit I set the alarm on my phone thankfully as theer was no wake up call either day (and i needed to be up and out early on both days). The taxi was booked for 7:30 - but on the first stay, never came, and on the second stay came at 5 past 7. The second day of the second stay no wake up call and no taxi either. Each day, I had to walk out to Parnell street to the rank to get a taxi. 

The breakfast was OK. The coffee was nice too - they had hot milk which was a treat.

Our room was spacious and spotless with a fab power shower though the bath is very shallow if you want a good soak!  Very comfy bed - sleep well.  We were located to the rear of the hotel so no view but very quiet.   Lifts seem to play up quite a bit over the weekend! The public areas are 'well worn' but it looks like a refurb is about to start.  I enjoyed my stay very much and was good value.  I am happy to recommend it.,4,2014,11,17
231,"Central, fantastic breakfast!","Stayed here for three nights on my first visit to Dublin, lovely friendly staff who can't do enough for you, central to shops, pubs and restaurants, spacious clean rooms, breakfast was fantastic, definitely worth the money!",5,2014,11,17
231,Great Location,"We stayed for 3 nights in November whilst we toured Dublin visiting the historical sites and bars and restaurants. The hotel is in a great location for the airport buses on O'Connell Street and is within walking distance of bars and restaurants including Temple Bar. The room was clean, a good size and the bed comfortable. The public areas were clean although they were being decorated but this didn't cause us any inconvenience. If you are touring Dublin we would recommend this hotel especially if you can get a good price which should include breakfast. Incidentally this was very good with a good choice of cooked and continental style food. The staff in the restaurant gave good service however some of the reception staff could be more friendly and welcoming. Our only disappointment was that the bar and restaurant both stopped serving food after 9.30pm.",4,2014,11,16
231,Excellent,One of the best hotels I have stayed in. Helpfull staff and large variety for breakfast. Clean well equipped rooms.e.g irons and boards. Only down side was the road works outside. No noise in rooms but pavement got crowded.,5,2014,11,16
231,"Clean, comfortable and quiet","Jurys Inn is not fancy, but the accommodations are perfect for a good nights sleep. The location is close to all the sights, and transportation.

Room was very clean, and the bed was comfortable. The breakfast was decent, with gluten free options and soy milk",4,2014,11,15
231,Very Poor service,"The hotel is in the middle of being done up, which we understand but we were very unhappy as we weren't told this when we booked the room or checked in! check in was fine, fast and the girl was friendly enough. My room was beautiful,  lovely view and comfy bed!! The whole experience was ruined whenever I went for dinner. The service in the restraunt was ridiculous.  Myself and my business partner had to wait a long time to be served. We got very fed up and we're getting ready to leave whenever the waitress then came over.  We ordered and ate, the food was ok, but when we finally ordered dessert I was told there was no Eton mess left,  I was disappointed as I was not told this when I ordered it. The girl on the bar in the other hand was lovely ! smiley and attentive, she had to be the most friendly person we came across our whole stay. Very disappointed with my stay,  mainly because of the service,  which was a huge let down.  Pick it up Jurys!! ",2,2014,11,14
231,Great location great value for money,"Have just returned after spending two nights here and am very impressed! 
We arrived very early around 9.30am and the reception staff were brilliant and got us into our room. 
I was really pleased with the location of this hotel it really is just a 15 min walk to temple bar and there's good shopping near by and is just off o'connoll street for all the buses.
Room itself was good comfortable bed and cleaned well, with tea and coffee making facilities.
Breakfast was ok nothing to really complain about other than what a few have about having to wait for things to be replaced. 
Overall really good value for money hotel, service was excellent and would stay here again! ",4,2014,11,13
231,Very Good Hotel and Reasonable Price,We stayed at the Jury Inn for four days. The location is great. You are very near O'Connell street and can walk easily to Temple Bar area. We had a twin room and it had one queen bed and one twin bed. The beds were very comfortable. The rooms are clean. The only thing I would say bad is that the walls are pretty thin. We were able to hear a lot of noise from our neighbors.,4,2014,11,13
231,jurrys parnell street,"first time to stay in this jurrys in parnell street.was very handy for all the shops.and for a look around the heart of dublin .the hotel was very nice beds were good .staff were very nice and helpfull,",5,2014,11,13
231,good value for the money and decent location,"good for business purposes, clean room, facility is not in the best shape but they are just running some renovation so i guess it will look much nicer in the near future. breakfast ok but could be improved, every day was exactly the same.",4,2014,11,12
231,So handy!,"Excellent location, just off O Connell street. We stayed for two nights and found it clean, modern and comfortable. We arrived early and, although it hadn't been arranged in advance, were actually able to check in then which was great.
The rooms have black out blinds and even though you're right in the centre little, if any street noise travelled up to us in our room. There is a small gym too which you'll most likely have to yourself - I know I did!",4,2014,11,12
231,Great stay.,"Stayed here from Oct 2/2014 until Oct9/2014.Basically nothing bad to say other than a little noise which came from two sources the first of which was adjoining rooms.I guess the walls are thin still no big deal not that much noise anyway.The second one came from the streets at night,still no big deal but if you are a light sleeper maybe you should look into an area other than the front of the hotel.Other than this no problems I have no reservations in recommending this hotel.The staff were friendly and very helpful.I read a few reviews before we went on our trip and the main thing that kept popping up was the location.Having said this....it was all true.Definately the perfect location within the city of Dublin.",4,2014,11,11
231,Excellent Value,Stayed as a group of friends for the rugby!! What can I say it was excellent... I have never stayed anywhere that the staff are so helpful and genuinely friendly.. The breakfast was spot on! I can't find 1 bad thing to say.. I booked this again to stay in December.. 1 minutes walk from O'Connell Street.. Best place I have ever stayed and I'm well traveled!! 10 out of 10,5,2014,11,11
231,Great location in the heart of Dublin,"We stayed at Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street for 3 nights in October. Location, location, location! This hotel is ideally located in the heart of the city and is within walking distance of all major attractions you are in Dublin to see. If you would rather a tour, this Jurys Inn is just steps away from the famous O'Connell street and the starting point of the hop-on-hop-off bus tour.  The hotel is very modern with well kept, clean quiet rooms. It was also a bonus to have a Tesco directly across the street.

We opted for the breakfast included plan but there was an unfortunate  mixup in the reservation and only one breakfast per day was included but with 3 in the room. This was a little frustrating but was likely because we booked through a third party website.  Although it cost us quite a bit more than we budgeted for, the breakfast was a very good hot buffet with many options to pick from. Staff in the bar was friendly and courteous and the food was very good on the two occasions we ate there.

If I were to go back to Dublin, this is where I would stay for maximum convenience and comfort to see one of the best cities I have ever visited!",5,2014,11,10
231,Terrible experience at Jurys Inn.,"Breakfast was very weak and bland. The heating system was broken so the room was freezing. After a second complaint they sent a non english speaking employee that disn't solve the issue. 
After the 3rd complaint they promissed the room would be heated by night time. 
They left a heater UNPLUGED so it was cold by night time, even though they promissed it wouldn't be. 
The next day, they turned it off during cleaning and opened the window. When I got back the room was freezing!!!!
The bath water had no pressure (at 7am, so not a busy time). The bed sheets were not long enought to cover the top third of my body. 
Overall a really bad experience, so do not come here!!!",1,2014,11,10
231,Cracking hotel & great value for money,"We stayed here for the weekend over marathon weekend at the end of October. The hotel was clean, bright, modern and the bedrooms were a really good size. We had an extra bed in our room and there was still plenty of room. Bathrooms were a good size and spotless.  Breakfast was plentiful and lovely with a good range. We will defo stay here again; would recommend this hotel.  Staff were great.",4,2014,11,09
231,Central and covers all of the essentials,"The hotel is centrally located in a fairly busy part of town, with a number of surburban bus stops (and the airport bus) around the corner. It is about 10-15 minutes walking distance to Temple Bar. The room was functional although on the small side compared to the other hotel we stayed at in Dublin. Late checkout (for a fee) is a good option if you have an evening flight to catch.",4,2014,11,09
231,Good location,"The location of this hotel is perfect. A short walk to temple bar and its just off O'Connell street just round the corner from where the aircoach drops you off. There is a big tesco facing it too which is handy if you need to pick up anything.
The rooms are very clean and the staff are friendly and welcoming.
You need your room key to use the lift which is a bit irrating if you forget it but I understand the concept.
We were only here for the night but would definitely stay again.",4,2014,11,08
231,I'm still coming back,In the middle of my sleep the door opened without a warning..it was the household staff..she apologized. I told what happened during my checkout.. I was told..it's because I did not put the no disturb sign...wow...I didn't expect her to say that!.. Not a very smart answer. Not putting up that sign means household can just open the door without even knocking?,5,2014,11,05
231,Dublin stay,Recently stayed at The Jurys Inn  just off o connell street. Great location friendly staff. Bedrooms very clean and conmfirtable breakfast was very good. Would highly recommend this hotel if staying in Dublin we would definatley return. ,5,2014,11,05
231,Wish every Hotel was like this,"I was so very pleased with my stay here.  Everything I asked was me with a positive ""No Problem"" answer.   I needed to print out Boarding Passes and the reception just had me e-mail them to them and printed them out on the spot.  In fact the lady even filled in the e-mail on my computer whilst I stood at the desk.  The WiFi was excellent, fast and did not have to keep logging on every time I had switched off as is the case with many Hotels.   Clean, friendly with excellant security for thr rooms.",5,2014,11,05
231,Good Base for Dublin,"Stayed here a few times as its handy for the centre of dublin and the rates are very reasonable. Was here most recently the weekend gone with my boyfriend for a spot of shopping. We were parking and this was validated for the clearys carpark with the hotel which was great as it cost us ten euro for 24 hrs. The location is great just off the top of o connell street so easy to wander about the centre of the city from here. The staff are always really friendly and extremely helpful and made the stay for us with help finding the parking  and check in and out easy. The room was clean and with enough space, the only problem we had was getting to sleep as there was some noise in the halls as our room was by the lift.Previously i have gotten a corner room which has more space and is further out of the way so would try to get one of those if possible. But overall great value and we will be back again ",4,2014,11,05
231,Happy and will be back,"We booked directly with Jurys in reply to an email, with a special deal which was great value for money. The hotel is very close to Henry Street shops. Breakfast in the hotel was very good. There is an excellent fish restaurant/cafe opposite the hotel.  The parking was expensive as current road works meant we couldnt access the normal car park recommended by the hotel.",4,2014,11,05
231,Excellent place to stay,"Nice hotel and good security!   It is Central to everything and easier to get transport.  Food quite good, staff friendly!  Near shops, bars and restaurants , buses, taxis.  You can leave luggage in storage room ! 
      
      
      
      
      
      
      ",5,2014,11,05
231,Weekend mini break,"Great place, right in the hub of the city. Can not fault anything about our stay. Have been before and will return. Would recommend to friends and family. If you are needing a taxi to the airport, let the hotel arrange this for you as you get a cheaper deal.
      
      ",4,2014,11,04
231,da roma,"Easy to get to from the airport , downtown , great breakfast , concierge who speaks only English, not friendly. nice clean room
      
      ............................................................................",3,2014,11,04
231,Nothing special.,It's close to O'Connell Street and a short walk to the river and the Temple bar.  The area does get a bit rougher looking at night and we faced the street and were treated to several sirens as the garda responded to calls.  The breakfast was good.  Service in the bar and restaurant was pretty lame.  We had to constantly flag the servers down and then they would get involved in something else and forget about us again.,3,2014,11,04
231,2 night City break.,"Not entirely satisfactory. Plus points were location, price was ok and helpful staff. Three of us, buffet breakfast just didn't work. Distinct lack of trays on both mornings, basically not available. Went for dinner second night had a long wait for main course. One other seemingly important table of twelve were being served at same time. Places reserved for them next morning. Two who didn't have starters were given a free bowl of soup to make up for the wait. If they wanted soup they would have ordered it. A bottle of wine or something similar would have been less mean. Room was alright, bit dull, one light not working. One person's key didn't work and were away from the others at times. Staff were helpful in sorting things out. Have been before and would go again but wouldn't eat there. Nice decent restaurant across the road. For those fond of fast food, MacDonalds and Burger King nearby.

",3,2014,11,04
231,Convenience at great value,"Convenient location to main attractions. A block from shopping street. Across the street from the Emperor's Museum. 15 min. walk from Temple bar. The room was comfortable, a bouble and a single bed, as well as the good sized bathroom. And don't forget the traditional irish breakfast. Also, added security to keep unwanted visitors, much appreciated since I walked back to hotel late in the evening.",5,2014,11,03
231,Weekend Stay,"Our arrival at the hotel was not the best start to our weekend! Due to work commitments we couldn't fly till late that evening! Therefore we didn't arrive at the hotel until just after midnight. We were told we couldn't have the room we had booked as they were now full and we we're put in the last room with 1 standard bed and 1 uncomfortable fold out bed. Both were doubles but this is not what we booked AND I purposely E-MAILED the hotel in advance to let them know we would be arriving late so as to avoid this happening. I was even sent a reply back so the hotel know we were checking in late. We were told we could be moved the next day,but that meant we had to unpack then pack up again the next morning,which was a pain as we were only there a few days. The next day we were moved to a better room, we didn't have to stay and wait around for this as the staff moved out cases for us while we were out.Yes we were trusting. Although this surprised me as previous hotels will not move guests belongings without the guest being present,(to avoid things possibly going missing and accusations being made who has stolen them) A good policy to have one thinks. We were happy with the move and generally the room was a decent size, clean and provided everything we needed.Check out was quick and easy and the hotel had pre booked our taxi for us. The issue with rooms aside the stay was ok and the staff were pleasant and helpful. I probably wouldn't stay again as I would like to try other hotels in Dublin.",3,2014,11,03
231,Great stay,My sister and I stayed here for 3 nights whilst in Dublin. First of all the hotel is in a great location right near O'Connell Street and within walking distance for most sights. It is also in a great location for the buses that run to and from the airport. The breakfast was good value and the food was great. A man on reception was also very helpful when we had to leave for the airport at 3am. ,5,2014,11,02
231,Good central hotel.,This hotel was great and very reasonable for the location and for the height of summer. We were travelling with bikes and the staff were very helpful with their storage. The rooms were functional and I would stay here again if I was in Dublin.,4,2014,11,01
231,mid term,"good hotel, centrally located.  room clean and average.  only quibbble very busy at breakfast and nobody seemed to be assisting guests..perhaps its busier because of mid term but you would expect this amount of people regularly staying in a city centre hotel.!?
      
      ",4,2014,10,31
231,This hotel remains one of my favourite Dublin Hotels,"I often return to Jury's Inn in Parnell Street as I always find it to be great value with friendly staff who provide excellent service. My recent visit was no exception.
I arrived in Dublin early and intended leaving my bags at the hotel whilst heading on to a meeting. However, when I arrived to the check-in desk I was delighted to find that at 10.00am in the morning, they had a room free, which was as I requested quiet, facing the inner courtyard and away from the elevator. 
This gave me a welcome opportunity to freshen up and make a quick cup of tea before heading off for a day's work.
My room was as usual very pleasant and comfortable with everything I needed for my stay including great Wi-Fi.
The following morning I found breakfast to be varied and of a high standard with a nice selection of fresh fruit, cereals and breads with a good range of warm items, which I think would suit most tastes.
My checkout was swift which gave me a good start to my second day in the city.
The great thing about this hotel is its location - it's a 10 minute walk from the LUAS stop and just around the corner from both O'Connell & Henry Street - you will find bus links to all areas of the city along O'Connell Street.
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone for business or pleasure alike. A very warm thank you to the staff team at Jury's!",5,2014,10,31
231,A perfect stay in Dublin City,"This was my third time staying at Jury's Inn Parnell St. There is simply no other hotel I'd rather stay at. The location is excellent, right off of O'Connell street and just about a 10 min walk to everything - Henry Street shopping, Temple Bar, Trinity College, Hop-on-Hop-off bus stops. There is a Tesco Express market right across the street so if you forgot anything (toiletries, etc.) not to worry. This hotel is super clean, modern and has great facilities. A perfect stay in Dublin.",5,2014,10,30
231,Dublin stay,"This hotel was in a good location for the city, I had booked six rooms for myself and friends and everyone said they would definitely use this hotel a again. All the staff were friendly and said hello in passing. We even had use of one of the free safes at reception. ",5,2014,10,30
231,Clean busy bit quiet city hotel,"Hotel reception area was very busy upon check in but was dealt with swiftly and very courteously with receptionist dealing with our needs very well.

Room was quiet,clean and exactly what we expected ..... Overall a great place to stay with no problems at all ... 2 happy visitors all round 😊 ",4,2014,10,30
231,Great location at a budget price,"We spent our first 2 nights in Ireland at this hotel. It was OK – everything we needed - but no frills.   The room was an adequate size but the bathroom was quite cramped.  There was a pedestal sink, which means no counter space, just a very small shelf for all of our bottles and things.  
The location is very good – a short walk from the AirCoach bus stop (airport service) and the Hop On Hop Off City Tour bus stop.  It is within an easy walk of Temple Bar and its restaurants.  It’s also a very short walk to a great pub (Parnell’s Heritage Pub) where we enjoyed a good dinner one night.  Drawbacks to the location are the roadwork going on outside the front of the hotel and the location of our room in the hotel – at the side of the building, looking right into the extremely close apartment building across the street, with nothing else to see.  That was depressing.  
The breakfast buffet was fine, with a good selection. On the second morning when I discovered the yogurt serving bowl was empty, I asked an employee if she could refill it and she did right away, so she made me happy.
While touring the city we saw the other Jury’s Inn near Christ Church Cathedral and though it might have been better because it’s in a more attractive area, with lots of trees around, but we can’t say for sure.  Maybe we’ll try that one if we ever get to Dublin again.  Overall, this one was not a bad choice.  We just wouldn’t want the same room again (#337) with its squishy little bathroom and non-view out the window.",3,2014,10,29
231,Definitely Worth A Stay,"Stayed here over the bank holiday. In a great location very close to all the shopping & eating areas in the heart of city. We stayed on 2nd floor which was nice & close to the restaurant & bar area. Lovely hotel in general,rooms spotlessly clean & bathroom aswell. Immaculate presentation as a whole package. Great breakfast aswell. Loved our stay here & looking forward to staying here soon again. Keep up the good work!!!",5,2014,10,29
231,"A good, central hotel","I enjoyed staying in the hotel for a few nights. A good hotel which is round the corner from O'Connell street and ideal for all the sightseeing trips. The hotel was pleasant and the staff very nice. A good bar menu and our room was a good size, well equipped.

We didn't like the parking situation. Q park was okay but I felt that it was very expensive and although discounted by Jurys, €10 a night is costly. We lost sleep the first night as there was a party going on next door. However, reception were very apologetic and added complimentary breakfast for us.",3,2014,10,28
231,I'll be back !,"A really nice Hotel ! 
I and my Wife  really enjoy it! 
Polite personal! 
Nice Service at The Restaurant , and at the Bar!
And Reception as well!
An Hotel to advise to everyone.
We'll be back for sure!...",5,2014,10,24
231,Nice stay,"Had three nights here very clean tidy , comfortable ,good location ,comfy bed and a great shower.
I did find it strange to have to use your room key to operate the lift. Free wifi is also included which is great.",4,2014,10,20
231,A Good Hotel,"We found the staff to be very helpful and welcoming.  The room was quite comfortable, the bathroom was of a good standard.  The breakfast selection was excellent - something for everyone.  Our only complaint - after a 34 hour journey - there was building works next door and the drilling and hammering sounded as if it was right near our heads - so sleep was pretty impossible.  I realise there was nothing the hotel could do about this situation, but it did not leave us with pleasant memories of our stay there.",4,2014,10,19
231,Good hotel,"BASIC room  pleasant staff  the room is pleasantly warm  the beds very comfortable the bathroom is good bit water drip on to floor when having shower from the shower curtain
The buffet breakfast is very good good variety and pleasant staff
The bar food is good but pricey
The hotel is now wi fi free which is great  the gym is well equipped 
Having allways stay at Christ church I will come back to Parnell street",4,2014,10,18
231,"Wonderful staff, wonderful experience","We arrived on the red eye over here and really just wanted to droop our bags, maybe get a little nap in before we started our day. The staff was warm, welcoming and had our room ready for us early. The room itself is a little small, but if we do this trip right, we should be spending as little time here as possible, right? I did almost start a fire by plugging in my flat iron (I promise I used the european adapter). Apparently, I used the wrong outlet. Only downfalls of the room: the bathtub is on a platform which can be a little deceiving, and you can hear other people in the hotel moving about, but again, we were so tired from experiencing this beautiful city, we hardly noticed. It is also very close to some of the more touristy parts of the city. But it really is just a short walk to some of the more local places. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!",4,2014,10,17
231,"great value location,location","This location is excellent for arrival and departure to airport block from 747 or local bus.
Staff very friendly and knowledgeable, Henry st shopping around corner & Grafton and Nassau, st shops 2-3 bus stops or brisk walk. Kingfisher resturant accross st and Murry's arround corner food and live music",5,2014,10,15
231,Poor Service ,"Visited for lunch due to the location. Waited in an empty bar for a waitress to take my order, waited 32 minutes for sandwich those that came in after me were served first. Loads of staff around once it came to bringing out the food but not around the bar at all. 
Not once in those 32 minutes was I asked was I ok or an apology for the delay, but maybe this is an average time for a sandwich. No cutlery, napkin given for the chips...
What shocked me most was an elderly resident came in & was told by a Barman to help herself to the biscuits that were laid out when she ordered her hot drink but then she was shouted at by a girl saying they were for the meeting room people only in which the woman explained she had been told she could, she repeated this twice to the girl who just kept shouting no your not at the meeting and the lady explained no she was a resident. After the Barman explained to the shouty girl that he had said it was ok. Very bad attitude towards the customer and no realisation that other customers could hear. 
So after waiting so long for my ok lunch I left promptly after waiting to find someone to pay. Truely lacking any customer service... Very disappointing ",2,2014,10,14
231,Brilliant hotel. Affordable!,"We only stayed here for a night but we're very happy with the service we received. I booked the hotel from hotels.com at the very last minute (the day before we're going). Paid 79 euro for a family room which is quite affordable for a family room. We arrived in the hotel quite early the next day an they were nice enough to allow us leave our luggage so that we can go out & stroll around the city. We went to National Aquatic Centre to kill some time. Check in is 2 PM. We came back at around 3 and our room is all ready. We didn't have high expectations, but I must admit, we were impressed the moment we stepped in. We were expecting a double bed and a sofa bed as this was the room's description in Hotels.com but instea, they gave us a double bed and 2 single bed. Our room features a contemporary design (one of my weakness). It's amazingly clean, quiet & has a fairly good size for a family of 4.  Beds has crispy white clean sheets (another weakness :D) & comfortable. I also love the fact that they provide the basic bathroom essentials like liquid hand soap (smells very good), hair conditioner & body wash. Wifi's connection is speedy enough for watching videos on Youtube. Didn't get to try other websites but I think if you want a faster connection, you will have to pay extra like 3 euros an hour.  Their selections of breakfast are quiet good & great value. They offer free breakfast for kids so we only paid 18 euros for 2 adults. Hotel's location is perfect as it's very close to a lot of shops, not to mention it's in the heart of the city. Across the road is Tesco (where you can do a lilttle bit of grocery shopping. Very handy if you forgot to bring some stuff like toothbrush, toothpaste, mouth wash, baby nappies & snacks for the evening. I think there's also an Aldi nearby as well as Centra. There are different kinds of restaurants around the hotel and if you walk a little bit more, it will bring you to O'Connell Street which gives you even more options to dine, shop and even watch a movie (Savoy Cinema). Overall, we're highly satisfied customers of this hotel and we will highly recommend it to families & friends. We will surely go back.",5,2014,10,14
231,Excellent,"There where 9 ladies in our party & from the minute we walked into the hotel we were made to feel very welcome. The rooms are lovely with well stocked tea/coffee facilities & fresh towels daily. The staff we met from reception to cleaners where extremely friendly & helpful. The hotel is central for shops, pubs & buses. Would definitely stay here again if I return to Dublin.",5,2014,10,14
231,Great Location In Dublin,"If you're looking for a hotel in Dublin City Centre, you'll struggle to find a better one than this. Located just off O'Connell Street, it is within a couple of minutes walk from drop-off points for the Airport Express bus and is very easy to find.
Check-in was quick and easy with a helpful receptionist, and I was asked if I required directions for anywhere in the city. I did, and the directions given were spot on.
The room (a double, 5th floor) was perfectly adequate as all I needed in there was a bed to sleep in for a couple of nights and a shower. It fronted the main road, but there was no issue with noise during the night (midweek, can't vouch for a weekend).
The hotel was within easy walking distance of the major attractions such as Temple Bar, Dublin Castle and Cathedrals, with the Aviva Stadium also within walking distance (albeit only for those who don't mind a longer walk).
The city's tram system (Luas red line) is also within easy reach (5 min walk to Jervis stop).
All in all, this hotel is perfect for a stay in Dublin. I wouldn't hesitate to return.",4,2014,10,14

231,Perfect location,"Always try to stay in jury's inn Parnell street when in Dublin never had any problems there,rooms are spotless, staff are friendly and the location is perfect. Have stayed there at least 5or6 times in the last 2 years and have no complaints. Will always be my first choice of hotel in Dublin ",5,2014,10,10
231,good location,"Stayed here this week for 3 nights on first trip to Dublin. Good central location for transport, shops and sightseeing.  Clean and quiet, staff friendly. We did not take meals in the hotel but plenty of places nearby and only 15 minutes to Temple Bar or O'Connell Street round the corner.. Our room was on the top floor, very quiet and clean - lighting poor in the room - but otherwise good value for money.",4,2014,10,09
231,Hmmmm,"Stayed here as we were attending the Ed Sheeran concert on the 3Arena. 

Checked in on Sunday afternoon, first impressions of lobby clear, spacious, warm. Pity the Receptionist let it down, when asked how we would like to settle our bill we informed the lady we would like to pay separately to which she rolled her eyes..! Apart from her attitude she was efficient in that she explained where everything was etc. .

Got to our room on the fourth floor,  corridors really clean and smelled lovely. Room was nice, 1 double bed and 1 single bed, enough amenities for the two of us and nice view overlooking a courtyard. 
So we headed put for the evening and receptionist gave us excellent directions to the red luas line. Came back to the hotel after 3am, straight to bed and had a wonderful sleep until 8.30am when the sound of incessant drilling and hammering filled the room. Tried to ring reception and no answer, I was literally ringing for 10 mins. So thought maybe there was something wrong with the line (in hindsight I'd say they were getting many complaints and did not want to answer). I decided to ring off my mobile and answered after 3 rings. Asked the girl on the phone where the noise was coming from and she transferred me to a manager. Manager explained it was from a nearby shop and that they had called the Guards etc.. nothing they could do. 

I don't appreciate being fobbed off.. We could clearly hear the hammering from the floor above us, there was a bedroom next door so they really insulted our intelligence by lying to us.  I'm not an argumentative person, for me I would just never return nor would I recommend this hotel to others which is ashame because aside from the noise issue it has an excellent location. 

",4,2014,10,08
231,Prime location,"This was our first visit to this hotel. The Jury's is located in a perfect district to match everyone's needs. Such as 5
Mins to the bus stops and only 15 mins walk to Temple Bar. My only negative here is the breakfast. Always cold and the Bacon is undercooked. Customer service is average though. Compared to the Crown Plaza or Holiday Inn this hotel is standard.",4,2014,10,08
231,Amazing ,"We were absolutely amazed at this hotel. Having only expected it to be clean and functional it knocked our socks off. Not only was it clean and functional, it was also very stylish and fairly luxurious. The room was done out in lovely shades of green, all lovely and modern but welcoming too. The curtains were beautiful. There was a 2 seater settee/sofa bed (besides the bed), a comfy armchair as well as a comfy desk chair and a desk. There was a flat screen TV, the usual tea/coffee tray with a modern new kettle. There was a hair drier, plenty of hangers and shelf space, drawer space, an iron and an ironing board, and sockets near the mirror. The bathroom had lovely thick towels and Gilchrist & Soames hand wash, shampoo and shower gel. The tissues were fitted into a neat wall holder, there was a glass shelf in the bathroom for toiletries and plenty of room to hang the towels. There was even air con, and triple glazing. I had a better nights sleep in a city centre hotel than I had the previous 10 nights in the countryside. The food menus looked really good though we didn't get chance to try as we were only there one night, my only sorrow is that we only there for one night. There was also free wifi which most places do nowadays, and they have an arrangement with a nearby 24 hour car park to validate your ticket and only pay €10 per night. 
We arrived here from a 4 star hotel and Jury's has put that hotel to shame. I expected it to be clean and functional and it was so much more. 

",5,2014,10,07
231,Perfect Hotel,"Great Hotel. Very clean and confortable. I spent one night with my boyfriend and was really nice. Nice room and quality/price really good. I Recommend 100%
Its in the middle of city centre !! Is not to expensive and its really elegant /smart",5,2014,10,06
231,Very Nice hotel with a very helpful staff,"Our family stayed at this Hotel Oct 2 to Oct. 5, 2014 the hotel is well maintained. The staff is friendly and extremely helpful. The rooms were very clean and well kept. There is a restaurant and bar on the 2nd floor the food was very good. and again the staff is very helpful. The hotel has a good location, we where able to walk to a lot of things. If your not into walking the hotel is close to all forms of transportation. the Location is very close to shopping being a Block from O'Connell street and in the shopping district City Center. The security was very good you need you room key card to use elevators etc. Again I can't say enough about the staff, i am not giving name because they were all so very helpful. I recommend this hotel to all kinds of travelers and will stay again if in Dublin.",4,2014,10,06
231,Good for a short city break,"Myself and my partner stayed at Jury's Inn Parnell Street in February 2014. We found reception staff to be very efficient in checking us in. The rooms are simple and quite bare, but this is just what is to be expected of a budget city hotel. The hotel is on a main road so there is quite a bit of noise from traffic and people walking by particularly if your room looks out onto the street, but again, this is to be expected when staying within a busy city.  

The hotel's location is perfect if you're looking for a short break within the heart of Dublin. Temple Bar is within walking distance along with shops, bars, restaurants etc. There is a Tesco just across the road from the hotel which is very handy. We cannot comment on breakfast as we did not have it at the hotel.

If you are looking for luxury then this is not the place to stay, however if you're looking for a central, reasonably priced hotel then this place has everything you need for an enjoyable break.",4,2014,10,06
231,First class,"Our stay at the Jury's Inn was First class, the warm welcome on arrival was just what was needed, the girls on reception were friendly and professional, Fortune the security guy was helpful and polite, the room was perfect for the 3 of us, the bar staff, restaurant staff were all lovely,the food was just great and varied, the price was competitive and cheaper than some of the Guesthouses around so worth a  visit. after we checked out  our bags were locked away securely while we continued to explored the city. We would definitely use the Jury's Inn again.  Thank you Jury's you choose your staff well. :):):)",5,2014,10,06
231,Perfect :-),"A friend and myself came to Dublin to celebrate her 60th birthday.... The hotel was absolutely perfect. Very clean spacious rooms with comfortable beds and a great breakfast!!! Jurys Inn is situated exactly right for shops, buses, trams, and not far from Temple bar..We had an amazing time and can't wait to go back there:-)",4,2014,10,05
231,Great hotel,"Stayed here for 2 days. Great accommodation and good location. Really good beds, and nice sizing of the double rooms. Is right in the center of Dublin, and there are short distances to both shopping and sightseeing etc. Nice staff and service also. Gonna book here for any returning trips to Dublin.",5,2014,10,04
231,"Clean, comfortable beds!  Close to downtown Dublin!","This hotel was chosen by our trafalgar tour package.  Room was clean, bed was comfortable!
Breakfast was excellent!  Staff was friendly and courteous!  Very convenient  to downtown
Dublin,  many shops and many restaurants!",4,2014,10,01
231,Great make over.,"I stayed here a while ago and found it left in the 1980's somewhere. I booked again as the location was great for me and was pleasantly surprised to see that level 4 was fully refurbished to a standard above and beyond what I normally expect from Jury's. Bedding, carpets, decor, TV all excellent. Quiet too. ",4,2014,09,30
231,Not so good,"I have stayed at the Jurys Inn at custom house several times and was expecting this hotel to be as good if not better, but was left disappointed.

The reception area is a little drab, the staff were not very friendly on checking inn, we had two rooms at vastly different rates and they had trouble explaining the reason, as the rooms were identical, the room itself was fine, nothing special but standard hotel offering, the only issue it was noisy, outside seems to be a service entrance to the hotel and surrounding shops and unloading started very early in the morning, so did not get a restful night. 

What really lets this hotel down is the restaurant, we had dinner and the service was slow, we had to ask several times for drinks and the waiter just seem to ignore us, the food was OK again nothing special but just OK, breakfast was terrible, we entered the restaurant at 8am it was fairly full but finding a table was nearly impossible, there were several free but were not cleared of the last persons mess, we ended up clearing a table ourselves, only then to find the hot buffet was nearly empty, after waiting 10 minutes for fried eggs the bacon then ran out, the staff were rude and unhelpful, finally gave up on the bacon, after asking twice and been told its on its way !! 

Staff really let this hotel down, while checking out in the middle of dealing with us, another member of staff asked the lady who was dealing with us a question, she just walked away and left us standing there, no apology when she returned, just blanked us.

I would not waste my money on this hotel again.",2,2014,09,29
231,Clean and Quiet,"This hotel was perfect for us. It was quiet and clean. The breakfast that came with our room was excellent. We are vegetarian and there was a lot we could eat. The hotel is very close to the main downtown area and we could walk to anywhere we wanted to go. We found 3 wonderful vegetarian restaurants close by. The outside of the hotel is not pretty but it is super clean and the staff are very helpful and nice. There is no view but we were there only to sleep so it didn't matter. There is a kettle and tea with real milk in the room. A tour company, for day trips, is right around the corner. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,09,27
231,DUBLIN with the kids,"Check in was a horror. We kept leaving and returning to be told yet another hour, this was so that our room would be adjacent to our kids room. After finally getting the okay 3 hours after check-in and very jetlagged, we found our kids room was on the same floor but about 15 doors down. Lots of complaints from guests as they were a little wild at times, but we warned them. Location was great and accommodations were fine.",3,2014,09,26
231,Good stay in the heart of Dublin ,"Stayed for 2 nights during a tour with trafalgar. Hotels on tour were generally 3 stars and did not deliver but this is a great hotel! 4 stars and deserves it too! Large clean room, good sized bathroom and tea coffee facilities. Short walk to many attractions....good choice for a short stay in Dublin. ",4,2014,09,26
231,Good Place to Stay for Touring Dublin,"We booked a few nights in Dublin on our recent trip to Ireland.  It was good fortune that we booked at this hotel.  It is a short walk to all the tour company and on-off-buses on O'Conner Street.  We didn't need a car for this part of our trip.  It is also a good walk to most attractions as well as Temple Bar district and local shopping.

The rooms are quiet and clean. The Irish breakfast buffet is excellent as is the regular restaurant menu and lounge.",5,2014,09,23
231,"Good Location, Average Rooms, Friendly Staff","Before I say anything, we appreciated to easy walk to Henry St,  Grafton Street, Trinity College, Temple Bar, etc. This is a budget hotel, in my opinion. 

We booked two rooms for five nights and had requested adjoining rooms but were told it could not be guaranteed. Our rooms were not adjoined. The beds were okay, but the rooms were not super clean. I could see where the vacuum had been on the main path of the carpet, but the other areas had not been vacuumed. The bathroom had some black mold where the tub met the floor. I did not call the front desk. We did not eat in the hotel because I was concerned about cleanliness. This hotel has not been updated as some of the other Jury's Inns have.  

When you leave the hotel you can turn right for O'Connell St and many of the buses, including one for the airport. BluApple has  nice coffee and breakfast sandwiches - its on the far corner of O'Connell and Parsons. The Tourist Office on O'Connell, at the end of the long block, has the best currency exchange rates and tickets to good day tours.  We did the Celtic tour and loved it. 

If you take a left out of the hotel, then take the first left, it will take you to Henry St., where there is shopping and restaurants. The Church restaurant is a right on Henry, then down on the left. The food we had for lunch at The Church was excellent. 

Would we stay here again? Maybe. The location was very good. ",3,2014,09,21
231,Good hotel,"The Jurys Inn on Parnell St. was one of the better hotels we stayed in Ireland.  The rooms were of reasonable size and clean.  The location is fairly close to O'Connell St., so that's a plus, too.  It's also within walking distance of many of Dublin's tourist attractions.  We didn't have the greatest view from the window, but I would have no problem staying there again or recommending it to anyone planning a visit to Dublin.",4,2014,09,21
231,Central location in Dublin.,We booked this hotel on short notice and stayed here for one night which also was last night of our two week journey in Ireland. The location suited us good because the next morning we had to take our bus to the airport and the bus stations was just a few steps away. Room was fresh and quiet even though the view from the window wasn't very impressive. The receptionist was helpful and hospitable. No complaints about this place!,5,2014,09,19
231,Free WIFI from Stone Age!,"Decent, clean hotel but really annoyed by the intentional slowing down of the internet to dial up speeds....forcing you to pay more to have what is now considered routine internet access in most hotels.",4,2014,09,19
231,Nice hotel in Dublin,"Jury's Inn, Parnell St was in an excellent location for seeing Dublin without having to rent a car. The wheelchair accessible room was really good, and the head over housekeeping came to see me to make sure everything was OK. The staff were excellent. They couldn't do enough for you. We stayed there for one night before going on a bus tour and then stayed another two nights after the tour. We didn't want to drag all our luggage with us on the tour and the Jury's Inn stored what luggage we didn't need. This service was very helpful in making it a great trip to Ireland!",5,2014,09,18
231,Central to city centre,"Stayed three nights in this hotel and to keep it short it was GREAT, staff excellent-buffet breakfast great -spacious bedroom and a brilliant location within walking distance for pubs, shopping etc .next time wer'e back in Dublin we will be staying here. again thanks to all the staff for your warm welcome.",5,2014,09,16
231,Excellent Location Superb Hotel,"Me and my mum stayed here for 2 nights on 13th September and I honestly don't have a bad word to say.
I spent weeks faffing and stressing not knowing where to stay and in the end booked Jurys Inn Parnell Square.
The location is perfect, just off O'Connell Street and all in walking distance to Temple Bar, Henry Street etc.
We used the Dublin Bus Tours Hop on Hop off bus the whole time we were there which was excellent.
The rooms were light and airy with fitted A/C, we stayed on the second floor in room 206 with a view of the street below.
The buffet breakfast was outstanding, from full Irish to continental, excellent choice!
Staff were friendly and helpful and always very polite.
I would highly recommend this hotel for a comfortable stay out of the noise of Temple Bar but accessible at a short 10 min walk.
I look forward to staying here again.",5,2014,09,16
231,One of the better budget hotels,Nice comfortable and quiet room and decent facilities. the bar and restaurant area looks good although we only tried the bar. Typically; there's not much opportunity to sample all the facilities on such a short visit. This was a pleasant place to stay on our whistle-stop visit to Dublin for a business meeting. I would definitely stay here again.,4,2014,09,15
231,Great Hotel,"Excellent hotel for visiting Dublin city centre, brilliant location for shopping, sightseeing etc and also handy for the zoo as you get the bus (46a) across the street, brings you straight to zoo only €2.39 per adult children free. Breckfast is worth the extra money, great selection of everything. Rooms are lovely,really modern . Staff were really helpful with everything. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin. ",5,2014,09,14
231,Long nice weekend  ,"Clean, tidy hotel, decent breakfast with plenty of choice and fair quality. Rooms and bathrooms nice and clean. And got good night sleep each night. Escalators where temperamental at times but otherwise enjoyed our stay and would recommend as ideally situated in the heart of Dublin with good access to transport. ",4,2014,09,13
231,Modern and beautiful hotel.,"Pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Usually hotels in city centres can be a little worn out however this one was absolutely fantastic. So clean, tidy and staff were very friendly welcoming us in and checking us out of the hotel. The room itself was very large and spacious with comfy beds and pillows. WIFI was also a bonus free of charge. We also tried the bar food. After taking a considerable amount of time to come it was worth the wait. Close by to all city centre attractions and short walk to shops and transport. Definitely worth the money and is now my favourite hotel in dublin!",5,2014,09,09
231,A neat hotel,"Stayed here for two nights as part of my Contiki Ireland tour (one night at the beginning and one night at the end).  It's actually a great hotel -- bars are within walking distance, and plenty of commercial activity going on nearby during the day.  The hot breakfast is highly recommended -- quite delicious, actually.  Hotel provided plenty of pillows and the bed was comfortable enough.  Free Internet access was fast enough to check e-mail, Facebook, etc., but not much more.  All in all, would definitely return here on a standalone trip.",5,2014,09,09
231,Where's the lift!,"Nice visit to Dublin and a great location! Very clean room, however I was a single 30 year female put in a handicap room that was so far away from the lifts! Staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was pleasant as well. I would definitely stay here again. ",4,2014,09,07
231,Enjoyable stay in Dublin,"I stayed at the Jury's Inn on Parnell Street for three nights at the end of July/beginning of August. The hotel is well located and within a five minute walk of where the airport bus stops.  I found the room to be clean, well appointed and the bed very comfortable. The buffet breakfast was plentiful with all that you would expect from an Irish breakfast. Across the street is a Tescos--so if you need to buy lunch or snacks, it is very easy to do so.  Overall an enjoyable stay.",4,2014,09,06
231,Nice Hotel,"Decided to stay in Dublin for a couple of days so I gave the Jurys Inn a try.  Turns out, it's a great hotel in a location convenient to downtown Dublin and shopping.  I look forward to staying here again when I return to Ireland",4,2014,09,06
231,Very nice hotel in the heart of Dublin,We stayed in this hotel for two nights.  The hotel was very modern and new and very clean.  The breakfast in the morning (which we bought as part of our package) was well worth it as there quite a good selection for every taste.,4,2014,09,04
231,a lucky find,"When my mom and I arrived in Dublin, our previously arranged accommodations fell through, leaving us stranded with nowhere to stay. Pretty much all the hotels were completely booked, but we did manage to find a room at the Jurys Inn on Parnell Street. What a stroke of luck! The hotel is in a great location (just a few blocks from the River Liffey), the staff was friendly, and the rooms were clean and comfortable. What more could you ask for?",4,2014,09,02
231,Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street,"This was a very convenient hotel to stay in.  I was well withing walking distance to the Temple Bar area and other attractions on the other side of the river  There was a market right across the street and we could pick up snacks and other things. The rooms were clean but the walls were a little thin, we could hear our neighbors very easily.  There were a lot of families at the hotel so no one was up that late.  I would recommend this hotel.",4,2014,09,02
231,Nice modern hotel in good location,"Hotel is modern, secure, and clean. Rooms are large, airconditoned, ensuites large and clean, great facilities, continental and cooked breakfasts delicious and large range of choices. Short-moderate walk to Main Street, shops & Temple bar
No laundry service available.",4,2014,09,02
231,Couldn't fault it! lovely staff,"The hotel staff were cheerful and helpful. I arrived a little early but they let me into a room that was ready so I didn't have to wait around. The staff always greeted you in corriders and helped if you needed it. Breakfast was lovely, with a good range to choose from, was nicely cooked and good quality.
The room was comfortable with spare bedding etc.It was near the centre city but not noisy, just off O'Connell Street
It was close to bus stops for sightseeing and airport transfer.We used the 'Hop on / Hop off' bus service which I would recommend as makes it easy to get around and gived you an overview of the city.",5,2014,09,02
231,Good location,"We stayed here for three nights.  The hotel is clean and within walking distance to most attractions in Dublin.  The breakfast buffet was more than adequate.  The only downside is the fitness center.  It is a closet with an elliptical and a treadmill.  But, if you are walking around Dublin, you will get your exercise.",4,2014,09,01
231,First visit to Dublin,A very clean and tidy hotel with excellent reception staff. The only problem was a very poor bar with uninterested staff. It is a pity Jurys do not try to encourage the patrons to remain in the hotel with better bar/restaurant on offer.,4,2014,09,01
231,Great hotel and location for the price! ,We stayed at the Jury's Inn for four nights to attend an American football game. The rooms are in wonderful condition and are very clean. The staff is pleasant and a full breakfast was included with our room. Highly recommend to anyone traveling to Dublin. ,5,2014,09,01
231,Central Location - Decent Hotel,"Best thing about this hotel is its Location, just near the city centre. Lots of food and shopping options available. All attractions are walking distance. But little costly for the facilities given. Its a busy property, We reached around 10 am but Early checkin wasn't allowed. Also Room was little small and dark. Internet is not free. Not a memorable stay but a decent one for its Great Location.",3,2014,08,29
231,Clean and centrally located choice,"We stayed here during our three day stopover in Dublin. The hotel is located in a central area, close to many historic attractions, pubs, and shops. However, upon arrival we were surprised that there was no bellman to help with luggage. This isn't normally an issue for us but we were traveling with extra luggage and kids this time around and clearly needed help.  The front desk gave us a cart and told us to handle it ourselves. We had to load the heavy luggage onto the cart and wheel it through the hotel to our room ourselves, which was inconvenient since every doorway requires card key access. It should be noted that there are men that are just paid to stand in the lobby by the door, though they aren't doormen because they don't open doors nor do they greet you or offer assistance of any kind. They just stand there and watch you struggle with your luggage. On the plus side, check in was quick. The room was spars but clean. We had no issues with noise. The shower worked well but bring your own toiletries because they don't offer much at all.  One lady at the front desk did help us book a dinner show at the Arlington Hotel on our last night. Overall our stay was satisfactory but in the future I'll choose a place that offers more customer service.",3,2014,08,28
231,Excellent,We stayed here for 4 nights our flight arrived early morning but we were able to leave them at hotel without a problem. Checked into our room later on after exploring dublin . Room was clean an very comfy bed. Breakfast had a good choice an hot an fresh which is unusual for a buffet style. Had a very enjoyable stay staff friendly an welcoming. ,5,2014,08,28
231,Disappointing,I have stayed in many hotels in Dublin and would only go back here as an ultimate last resort. There was noise from around 4am thanks to the market and bin depot being right outside the window. The rooms were also overlooked by the large apartment block next door all of which meant I had a very poor week's sleep. My room was clean however very basic with only a hanging rail in the corner of the room (no wardrobe or drawers etc) the restaurant food was ok however no room service is offered. This hotel is cheap and it is shown in all aspects.,2,2014,08,27
231,Perfect location,"This was our first visit to Dublin. We caught the Aero Bus from the airport costing 7 euro one way.
The hotel was a good choice as it was just off O'Connell Street. Although we only had three days we managed to visit most of the attractions. The breakfast in the hotel was a real treat, plenty of choice, and was always kept hot and replaced regularly. We never ate in the restaurant as there were lots of eateries within walking distance. Our room was ideal, spacious and clean, we had room 343 facing the courtyard which was a long walk to the lift but not a problem. The staff were very polite and efficient. If you love shopping, Grafton and Henry street are good for shopping, St Stevens shopping mall at the top end of Grafton street is well worth a visit.",5,2014,08,27
231,5th visit and probably the last.,"Arrived at 11am (check in by 2pm). People around us given rooms. We were told ours nearly ready. 1pm room ready, then room gone! 1.20pm, room be 10/15 mins. 1.45pm a VERY RUDE ""room not ready"" from the delightfully ignorant and abrupt duty manager. Remember now 2pm in check in. 1.50 pm still no room, people around us having rooms.

I'm not stupid, I speak English as my daily language as well as two other languages, but rude and aggressive is rude and aggressive. We always book Jury's when we visit Ireland. I have sent lots of friends and colleagues to this hotel. In the 2 years since we last visited staff attitudes have changed, not for the better. Was always polite, friendly and kid friendly, not now.

Don't keep your guests dangling, it's either a room before 2pm for everyone or no one.",1,2014,08,26
231,Close to O'Connell Street but beware of criminals,"We arrived at the hotel on 19 August 2014 for a 3 night stay. It was myself, my husband and 2 young children. Our plane was delayed by 2 hours so we arrived about 9.30pm from the Airport. We purchased our Freedom pass online and collected the tickets at the airport. Their services run every 10-15 mins which was perfect and they dropped us about 200 yards from our hotel. The location of the hotel is great as its close to most amenities. What I found useful was the Tesco right opposite the hotel (albeit we found everything much more expensive than the UK Tesco). We purchased our breakfast passes from the front desk as it worked out 9 Euro each person each day. The buffet had a nice selection although we were limited due to only eating items that were halal. It would have been ideal if they have more vegetarian options for other guests as for 9 Euro we didn't feel satisfied with the breakfast. 

Our aim was for my husband to sit a medical exam the following day and then spend the next 3 days as a small family break. On the day we arrived my husband went out to get some food for us and unfortunately was attacked by a person on a bike who stole his iPhone 5s. The area was near the City Centre (Georges Quay). **Please be aware when or if you do go out and about in the dark.** He was left with a very deep cut near the eye with a knife and after the attack he tried to ask the local people for help, all of them ignored him. He managed to get to the police station (called Garda over there) and they were so very helpful. They took my husband to the hospital and bought him back to the hotel at 6am after he had 7 stitches done. The police informed us that they left paperwork at the reception of the hotel but twice when we asked they were very unhelpful. They didn't even bother to ask other members of staff if they had received anything. We were not impressed with their unprofessional mannerism. We don't think we will be visiting Dublin again after this incident as it was too expensive and we felt unsafe to go anywhere especially with young children. If you do go, never go out alone after dark.",3,2014,08,25
231,Ideal location for city centre,"This is ideally located, very close to the main shopping street and the visitor attractions in Dublin.
The staff are friendly and helpful.
Room was clean, comfortable and a good powerful shower.  Bed comfy, but prefer a bigger bed.
Some of the public areas are a little tired, such as restaurant area.
Buffet breakfast good. Lovely porridge!
Would definitely stay here again and would recommend for a good base, when sightseeing in Dublin.
Good value for money too!",4,2014,08,25
231,Embarrassed ,"Arrived at this hotel to be met a an ignorant receptionist who treated us  so badly,like we were trash,no smile no HELLO(shocked)told us we would have to pay €50 per room to ensure we don't damage anything or make noise, it was horrible and upsetting, we were afraid of out lives to make a sound, the next day we complained, we did get an apology and a round of drink for our group, to be honest it wasn't enough, we are all professional women from Galway and did not deserve such treatment, very belittling, ",2,2014,08,24
231,Very central to Dublin - enjoyed our visit.,"We stayed here for 3 nights on a family holiday. Prices were good, location in Dublin was excellent (never needed my car), restaurant was OK but not great. The hotel was very clean and staff were very friendly. The only downside was the lack of TV channels - there were just a few terrestrial channels available, mainly RTE. With kids on board I like to be able to rent a movie in the late evening so they can watch it otherwise they can become restless. Apart from that the hotel was excellent. Please note that the car park used by the hotel is a 5 to 10 minute walk from the hotel and that Dublin is still a nightmare to drive through with its one-way system and heavy traffic - I'd definitely recommend using a sat-vav!",4,2014,08,24
231,Good cheaper option,"Clean modern hotel, helpful staff, central location.
They use the Cleary's car park which is a bit of a pain if you have a family-load of luggage! It's only €10 for 24 hours though, good value in the city centre. Having lived in Dublin years ago I wouldn't stroll around that part of Dublin late at night, but it's not too bad, and safe during the day.
The room was small but clean, good bed and great shower. The kids (twins aged 8 shared the sofa bed). Breakfast was a good buffet, €9 per adult and the kids ate free (two children per paying adult according to the sign). ",4,2014,08,21
231,Fab central clean hotel,We just stayed here for 2 nights.  The rooms were spotless.  Breakfast was plentiful and very tasty.  The bathroom could have done with providing conditioner and body lotion.  As we were checking out before breakfast was served they made us a pack up up which was welcoming.  Would stay again.  ,5,2014,08,19
231,Excellent for city centre stay,"Friendly, clean and good value for me as a solo traveller this time.

One evening I ordered a bar meal and within 5 minutes was brought some free nibbles because the kitchen was having trouble keeping up with the orders.  Before my meal arrived within another 10 minutes free soup and a roll arrived as a further apology.  I thought this represented excellent customer service, especially when I was in no rush whatsoever",5,2014,08,18
231,Good hotel,"I spent a week and had a pleasant stay. Friendly staff, comfortable, good breakfast. The location is perfect to go sightseeing as it is just by O'Connell street. It's also near Croke Park. Also good for shopping.",5,2014,08,17
231,another good stay,"The location of this hotel is just perfect! It faces Christ Church and is very close to almost any attraction in Dublin. (The only thing is that you can hear all the bellringing. Some people don't like it.)
The stuff was quite helpful and friendly. We had a lovely spacious room. It faced the street but we didn't hear much noise.
They don't have ATM but there's one in two minutes walk away.",4,2014,08,16
231,generic hotel,"Stayed 2 nights midweek in August.  Staff was friendly enough but didn't seem too knowledgable regarding area or even some aspect of hotel.  The lobby furniture is well worn & slightly musty.  Our room was tiny, #528 with no view. The TV & tea service was jammed on the desk so that the desk couldn't be used for anything else.  The bathroom was the smallest I've seen in a hotel with a compact shower you could barely turn around in & water damage on the wall.  The walls were paper thin. We could hear the conversation in the other room & they were just talking. A young boy had a nightmare in the middle of the night down the hall & you could hear the entire episode.  Luckily we planned on spending very little time at the hotel.
Pro: close to several tour bus stops on O'Connell St., If Jury orders your cab to the airport it's only 20 euros.",2,2014,08,14
231,Fabulous,"This hotel makes an ideal base for a city break in Dublin. Just off O'Conner Street, it is in easy reach of all the places you would would want to visit in this vibrant city. The rooms are large and spotlessly clean, the beds comfy and although this is a busy hotel in a bustling area, absolutely quiet so that a good sleep is guaranteed. The staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast is great although you have to bear in mind the fact that this is a busy hotel and at peak times the dining room can be a bit frenetic. Since breakfast stretches from 7am till 10am it is easy, nevertheless, to find a quieter time if this is your preference. I would highly recommend dinner here as the food is first class and the waiting staff superb. I had the best sirloin steak in a very long time. Although perhaps lacking the atmosphere of the more traditional Irish dining venue, this is made up for in the quality of food, the service and the value for money. When I make a return visit to Dublin, this will be my hotel of choice.",5,2014,08,14
231,"Very nice hotel, convenient and clean.",Stayed 5 nights and enjoyed the convenience of the hotel. The front desk staff needs to exercise a little more patience when dealing with non-locals. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the area was quiet at night.,5,2014,08,14
231,Good night sleep,"After a terrible experience in a different hotel we booked into this one for the last night in Dublin, room was fantastic, bright, clean. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Food was delicious and plenty to eat in the morning with the buffet breakfast",5,2014,08,12
231,"Great location, reasonable hotel","Stayed 2 nights in August. We had a triple room, which I think was a double with another bed squeezed in. This made the room feel a bit cramped, but it was very clean, quiet and the beds were quite comfortable. The staff was very pleasant and knowledgeable. For some reason Dublin hotels are hard to come by on summer weekends, so reserve early if you can. We were last minute and did not have much choice. Jury's Inn turned out to be a good place in a great part of the city. Lots of restos, shopping and three Starbucks within a 5 minute walk if you need a cappuccino fix in the morning.

The windows blocked out any street noise, so it was quiet. The hotel also has a noise policy of some sort which seemed to prohibit loud noise at night. It must work, as we were not disturbed at all by loud noises.

If you book directly with the hotel they upgrade you to premium wifi. It's free and it's fast.

We did not need our room serviced but returned to find a fresh supply of towels under our do not disturb sign. Lots of choice for English language tv (I think there were about 10 channels).  There is a very small fitness room with a tread mill and ban elyptical. There may have been a bike too. 

We did not eat at the hotel as there are lots of choice to eat in the neighbourhood.

The cost of a taxi from the airport was only 23 euros and only took about 30 minutes.

Although a bit pricy for a three star, in my opinion - I think we paid 209 euro for the second night, Jury's Inn was a very acceptable place to stay in Dublin.",4,2014,08,09
231,lovely short stay,"Great short stay at jury inn. Clean large room with loveley view out of large window, desk staff very helpful, would stay here again when next in Dublin. This hotel is in a great location great for getting the airport coach , handy for all the shops and bars [avoid Temple Bar area as too touristy and Over priced } Grafton Street area much beta and you will see more aurthentic side of Dublin,",4,2014,08,09
231,Dublin,"We enjoyed our stay at jurys inn parnell street, especially because of the location. The hotel is based in the city centre and very close to oconnol street. We liked the modern look of the room and the service at the reception.

231,10 out of 10~Lovely Hotel,"Stayed here on August bank holiday weekend,2 adults and 4 children in two rooms,and we ,hand on heart ,have no complaints,brilliant place to stay,perfect location ,excellent breakfast and children loved it. We will be back .",5,2014,08,07
231,"Wonderful staff , pleasant stay","Stayed here for one night our first night in Ireland. Arrived early morning tired after a long flight and the staff were excellent. They allowed us an early check in and offered a free room upgrade. Room was clean , had air conditioning but no view  (back of the hotel ). The area around hotel is under construction but we heard no noise and never felt that it was unsafe. It is fairly close to O Connell - the Main Street about a 5/10 minute walk. Breakfast was included and was quite good , full buffet eggs bacon sausage croissants , pastries , fruit etc. staff again were very pleasant .
We took a taxi from the airport and it cost about 30 euro. Once there we took the buses and trams to get around and it was very well situated to public transportation.",3,2014,08,06
231,Great location ~ Good Hotel,"We stayed at the Jurys Inn for our last 3 nights in Dublin (July 6-8/2014). The hotel is in a great location.  O'Connell St. (the main street in Dublin) is just around the corner.  Within walking distance are the hop on hop off buses, Henry St., City Center and The Temple Bar area.
The rooms and very clean and cozy.
When we arrived back from the first day of exploring/shopping we discovered that our room was not made up for the day.  I called down to guest services and within 5 minutes we had fresh towels and glass brought to the room.  They offer to make the bed also but that was no big deal.  They apologized for the inconvenience.
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin.  
Great located, Clean hotel and friendly staff.",4,2014,08,05
231,family trip to zoo,"The hotel overall is great, near to shops and train/bus options are a short walk away. Tecos handy for zoo picnic food and ask staff about the dublin wax works if you have kids its a fun afternoon. The walk to oconnell st not far and if ur a Mrs Brown's Boys fan the hotel is just down a bit from where they filmed the market street scenes",5,2014,08,05
231,Great Experience,"Myself and 2 other friends visited Dublin briefly, for the Beyonce concert at the Dublin 02. We found the hotel, very easy to check in, and out of. It was very conveniently centrally located. Was very easy to find once we arrived from Dublin Airport. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit Dublin.",4,2014,08,05
231,fantastic break,"Just back from staying in jury's, and we had a really enjoyable time. We took the train from newry to Dublin and it was very quick and easy. The hotel was literally only a few minutes away from the train station and a few minutes walk away from o'connell street. The hotel itself was very clean and welcoming as were the staff. Breakfast was full Irish or continental whatever your choice and was very enjoyable. Our room was big enough for the two of us and was very clean and presentable and the beds very comfortable, a good night's asleep was had by all! If we were to go back again which we probably will, we would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,08,04
231,Great stay,"Just returned from a great 3 night stay here. I was in a party of 3 people sharing a room. On arrival we were checked in by a trainee who made the experience quick and effortless. He was extremely welcoming in the usual Jurys way. Our room was well appointed on the 3rd floor. Both the room and the bathroom were spotless and very well equipped including iron and ironing board, hairdryer, shampoo, shower gel etc. I found all staff very helpful, really friendly and knowledgeable with all the usual visiting tourist questions. The hotel is in a great location with the hop on hop off stops, the pick up point for the 'green bus' tours, fantastic shops on O'Connell St and Henry St etc. no more than a 2 minute walk away. My only complaint was the breakfast, which I felt was not as good as that offered in other Jurys I have stayed and I did not feel the breakfast offered was worth the 10 euros charged. . Although the selection offered was very good, for the bread to be toasted I had to put it through the toaster twice resulting in other people waiting. Some mornings the toasters were not in use as they had overheated. The other cooked items I did not enjoy as it all tasted the same, from the sausages to the scrambled egg. In my opinion a walk to Kingfishers just across the road for breakfast would be better. Their sign says it is Dublin's best fish and chip shop, and OMG it sure is! Overall a great place to stay, I will stay here again if in the city, but think I'll give breakfast a miss.",4,2014,08,04
231,Conference,I just want to say that I had a good time at Juries. I was in Juries for a conference. The staff were excellent and I would like to mention a waiter called José who was particularly helpful and made our stay more enjoyable.,5,2014,08,03
231,Excellent central location.,"We were a family of 4 staying here. We arrived and were told our room was not ready yet but were given a key to access the bar on the second floor to wait whilst reception held our bags. When we arrived at our room on the 4th floor, it was huge! My 2 children had full size single beds and a double for my husband and I. The location of the hotel is fantastic as O'Connell Street is only round the corner. Breakfast was plentiful and the choice was huge including warm porridge which my children enjoyed. I would recommend staying here for short city breaks.",5,2014,08,03
231,Well located,Stayed at the Jury's Inn for a couple of nights. The rooms were clean and well appointed with the location close to all Hop on Hop off buses etc. staff were helpful and gave good advice on things to do. Breakfast was excellent although watch the times that you go. We found going later eg after 9am did not necessarily mean there were less people there. Recommend to anyone who is going to Dublin and want to be located close to the centre.,4,2014,08,02
231,Excellent Hotel,My friends from work and myself visit Jury's Hotel in Parnell Street twice a year. The staff are so friendly and the rooms are very clean. The hotel is centrally located for our shopping trips and also for going out at night. Breakfast is delicious! Would recommend to anyone.,5,2014,08,02
231,Nice hotel very central,"We had a good time at this hotel. It was literally around the corner from O'Connell Street, the main street in Dublin. The room was nice, quiet, and bed and pillow both were comfortable and it had a good shower and bathroom. The food was ok too and the staff were friendly and helpful.",5,2014,08,02
231,"Handy location, nice clean modern rooms","We stayed here one night after visiting family the preceding days so we could have a day and night in Dublin. Hotel was easy to find and walking distance from a maned private Q car park we used to leave the car, both hotel and car park convenient to the ferry port. 

Staff were helpful, with a shop nearby where you could pay the road tolls which was useful! Hotel is very clean, did nt use the bar but it looked nice, room was the usual Jury's Inn standard - clean, comfy and modern with nice bathroom.

City center shops, pubs and Temple Bar area in easy walking distance.",4,2014,08,02
231,Excellent stay,"I stayed in this hotel for two nights and it has been an excellent stay. The staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful. The room was cosy with a comfortable bed. The hotel is very clean and our room was cleaned on a daily basis with fresh towels provided. The hotel is centrally located with shops, restaurants and public transport nearby. Breakfast was really good.The only thing that let us down was the lack of a fridge in our room to keep our drinks cold. However, I will definitely book this hotel again.",5,2014,08,01
231,Lovely Hotel!!,stayed for two night before Christmas. So centre and clean!!! Breakfast is the best part of your stay just beautiful. Nice friendly bar staff also. Would recommend to anyone who is going shopping or going out in Dublin at night.,4,2014,08,01
231,Excellent family stay,"My husband and I  stayed in Jurys Inn Parnell Street with our 2 children, age 3 and 5. We arrived at 9.30a.m. to leave our luggage as we had come up on a train and did not want to be carrying it around with us all day. We were delighted to be told that there was actually a room ready and that we could check into that room. It was great to get unpacked and chill out in our room before heading off for the day. The guy on reception was excellent, very friendly and gave us directions etc as to the bus we needed to take to Dublin Zoo. The room was spotless, very comfortable and had everything that we needed for our stay. Breakfast in the morning was excellent. There was a great variety of continental and cooked breakfast. Checkout was very efficient and we were able to leave our luggage until evening time which was very convenient. We will definitely be staying here again and would highly recommend it! It is very centrally located less than a 5 minute walk to O'Connell St/Henry Street area. The children were also very impressed!",5,2014,07,31
231,Not too shabby,The room is clean and of good size for two.  Missing a fridge and microwave though although a microwave is not a common item in Ireland.  The hotel is within walking distance for restaurants and the fast food places such as Burger King and McDonalds.  ,4,2014,07,31
231,"A basic hotel, but good service","There were a few things about this hotel that we did not like. We found the rooms to be very noisy, we were easily able to hear people in the adjoining rooms and banging from upstairs. They have a large notice in their foyer saying they don't tolerate noise in their hotel, but the walls are obviously thin and so the noise is unavoidable. Another thing we didn't like was that the window opened onto a court yard where there were many other rooms with windows overlooking the courtyard, but we could not open the curtains as there were no blinds or lace curtains and so everyone could see into our room. (No privacy and no fresh air.) There was no mini bar in the room, which we missed as we usually put our own drinks etc.. in this, and there wasn't any clock or way to tell the time in the room. There was no safe in the room, but they did offer you a safety deposit box in their foyer which although a bit of a nuisance having to go down to the foyer and to ask a staff member to open it every time you wanted to access it, we found it a reasonable size and it seemed more secure than a room safe as you had to sign each time you accessed it. They did say that it would cost a whopping  €250.00 if we lost the safety box key. The staff were all very helpful and pleasant. The location of the hotel is very good, only one block from O'Connell St, and a short walk from Henry St. Overall a basic hotel which didn't cost a lot to stay in, with a few things that would make it better.   ",3,2014,07,31
231,Outstanding service in 2nd floor bar,"Just a line to thank your bar staff for looking after my two kids and their granny so well this afternoon. The young lady member of staff in the bar made my daughter's day by giving her a colouring book and jigsaw and turned tears into a big smile. Remarkable service so well done, you need to hang on to good people!",5,2014,07,30
231,Perfect choice for my family,"I am very happy with my choice. I was in Dublin for a weekend with my husband and my two boys and we did not want to spend a fortune, this being a bonus holiday trip. This hotel was perfect! 

The location is amazing! It has easy access to and from the airport. The Express Bus has a stop less then five minutes walk and the family ticket was 12€. The taxi is around 25€. It is up north the River Liffey and in the neighborhood you have Henry Street which is a popular shopping area. In 10 min you can get to the heart of the city. After crossing one of the bridges you will find yourself in Temple Bar and Grafton Street. Just across the street where the hotel is located there is a Tesco store which we found really useful, having kids. We came back to hotel early in the evening and before going to bed they always ask for a drink or a snack. And most of the time they are not happy with hotel restaurant offer...that's how kids are :) And one more thing. The breakfast was not included. Beacause of that we could afford the luxury to sleep late in the morning. So Tesco was helpful for us as well. For a three stars hotel, it had great facilities: apart from basics we had an iron table in every room  and at every floor we had an ice dispenser (we used it to keep the drinks from Tesco cool) The bar and the restaurant are very good. The food we ordered came fast and tasted delicious. They have some awesome deserts too. 

The hotel is very, very clean and updated. It was very quiet as well.
We really enjoyed staying there I would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,07,30
231,Good hotel,"I had a very good stay at this hotel. The rooms were clean and updated. Also the cost included breakfast which had many options. Beds were comfortable as well. It was about a 10 minute walk to temple bar area and 2 minute walk to many bustling streets (O'Connell street). Staff was friendly and welcoming! Would recommend. 

Ps we took the bus from airport and it let us out about 2 blocks away and it was only 10 euro round trip! Definitely worth it. On the way back to the airport we made a ton of stops but still made it there in under 45 minutes. ",4,2014,07,29
231,Very friendly,This hotel is well situated on the northside and is just round the corner of the city sight seeing tour bus which is well worth the money and have a laugh.The staff in the hotel were all  very friendly and could not do enough for you.Hadan excellent 3 night stay,5,2014,07,27
231,"Compliment to Jury's Inn, Staff, and Anna the Duty Manager","First i would like to compliment the Jury's Inn staff for being very kind and efficient during my stay. Jury's Inn was a perfect location to everything. The room was very quiet, comfortable, and a good size,. During my stay at Jury's Inn I took ill and needed to come back home to California few days early. Anna the duty manager at Jury's Inn was a great help to me in many ways. Anna was very understanding, supportive, professional, efficient, and kind to me. in my opinion the Jury's Inn is very fortunate to have Anna. Visiting Ireland was a wonderful experience. Anna and staff assistant Natalia made it much more so. 
Appreciative traveler,
Donna",5,2014,07,25
231,Decent place to stay,"My wife and I stayed there July 19-22, 2014, booked through our travel agents. Excellent experience overall; extremely friendly, courteous, knowledgeable and willing to help front desk, efficient room cleaning, very friendly staff throughout, nice spacious rooms, comfortable beds, very spacious bathroom, sumptuous breakfast, convenient location to public transportation, shopping and sightseeing.  Great value for your money.  Would definitely stay there again, if we ever visit Dublin and would highly recommend to visitors.",3,2014,07,24
231,Great Stay,Stayed two separate night . We came so early the first time but they kept our luggage til they had a room for us . we had an excellent sleep with the window open  as we had a courtyard room away from the noise .the second time we had  a room next to the street and used the air conditioning .The breakfast was great even the bagged one the second time (as we had to go at 5 in the morning for our flight ) . The  rooms were clean and  comfortable and the staff friendly and helpful.Its close to food markets if you prefer to go get a quick snack and near good restaurants,5,2014,07,22
231,Great location.,"Stayed here for three nights. The staff were excellent, and the hotel was perfectly clean. We arrived very early, but knowing the check in time was a lot later, we hoped to be able to leave our bags somewhere. It turned out that the room was ready so they let us check in. This was a very pleasant surprise.
The location is within easy walking distance of o'connell st, and grafton st for shopping and bars/restaurants etc. Walking a. Bit further took you over the bridge towards temple bar, whee there are many bars with some excellent live Irish music.
The only downsides for me were using the lifts. You need your key card to call the lift then to get to yours or different floors, we found it a bit hit and miss. We saw a number of other people having the same problem too.
Also, we were in room 350. This room is at the back of the hotel where very early in the morning there are council workers making a hell of a racket with waste bins. The smell from them wasn't pleasant either. So, no open windows in those rooms!
Otherwise everything was good.",4,2014,07,22
231,Good comfortable stay!,"I stayed here for 2 nights in July and found the hotel to be clean and up to standards. The staff were very accommodating, especially when asking for extra towels and milk, tea and coffee. The head of house-keeping was a very friendly lady. Introduced herself to us in an lif ride and made us feel very welcome. Breakfast was good & filling. Carpets were lovely and soft to walk a long. Room was a good size. Had to sleep during afternoon and curtains were very good for black outs. Hotel was situated in the middle of dublin. Made it great to get to places within a 10/15 min walk. Would definitely recommend and would definitely stay here again.

The issues we did have were the keycards. One of them didnt work at all and the other issue were the cards in the lift. I understand using the keycard to call the lift on the bottom floor but then to be in the lift and have to use the keycard for the floor number. Was a lot of faf. However. ... minor points on a great stay.",4,2014,07,20
231,Perfectly Fine,"We stayed here 4 nights in July, and we were quite happy with our visit. We had not been to Dublin before and did not know what to expect, but we found the location suitable for what we needed, the staff very helpful when we talked with them, and the accommodations themselves clean and comfortable. One word of caution: If you know how nachos should be made and how they should taste, do NOT eat what is served off the bar menu! :)",4,2014,07,18
231,Great Stay!,"This is my second time staying here, and like the last time it was fantastic. Very clean. Nice TV with both Irish channels and UK channels as well like BBC, Channel 5, 4 UTV/ITV. Breakfast was good, self service (which i prefer.) It is also located beside the Moore Street Market Street, where you can get cheap fruit and veg. 
Room was nice and cool thanks to the A/C which you can adjust to you liking using the control panel on the wall. 
Recommend staying here! Great hotel.",5,2014,07,17
231,great location,"I booked 1 night at this Hotel for my daughter and boyfriend for her 18th, the location for the bars and shops was excellent. They managed to find the Hotel quite easily from the ferry port. 
The staff were all very friendly and were very accommodating on the last day when they had to store their luggage as they were not sailing back until late at night.
They did not eat at the Hotel but said it was all very clean and modern and had good Wi-fi. 
As 18 year olds they said they did not feel intimidated at night time around the Hotel as some people have stated in previous reviews.They felt also the security in the Hotel was very good.",5,2014,07,15
231,A good weekend hotel in Dublin,"A very clean, functional hotel situated in central Dublin. The staff were friendly, the breakfast good and the location fine. If you need a supermarket there is a Lidl around the corner and a large Tesco diagonally opposite the hotel open until 11pm, six days a week. It’s a very easy 15 minute walk into the Temple Bar and Grafton Street areas of Dublin.

On arrival we did notice a large notice board about keeping the noise to a minimum for other guests, however we had no problems with noise during our stay. We had a quiet room, facing an inner courtyard which suited us perfectly. Free safes are available at the reception desk to store your valuables and a brochure stand in the lobby. Staff will provide free maps of the city and advice on tours. 

If you are taking the Airlink bus service from the Airport, then alight at stop 7 (Cathal Brugha Street & O'Connell St. Upper). I recommend using this service which is 10 euro’s return and very reliable. 

A recommended hotel.",4,2014,07,15
231,Good Location,"Stayed here for 3nites after a long drive from Killarney. Lovely hotel, pleasant front desk & housekeeping staff, the rooms were large, clean and had very comfy beds. It's in a great location and there are so many cafes and restaurants within walking distance. The view from the bedroom window wasn't great, but thats ok as long I could get a good nite sleep. 

The drawbacks are firstly the hotel has no parking space so you need to walk approx. 5-8min walk to a multi-storey carpark which means leaving all your luggages at the hotel lobby while you park your car or vice versa carrying your luggages to the htl from the carpark.

Second drawback, taxi drivers tends to hog the hotel double yellow line driveway when you try to park your car infront of the hotel to load/unload your luggages when you check out/check in, so you end up having to park further than the hotel, which is inconvenience for the hotel guest. The hotel security man who walk about the lobby could tell the taxi drivers to move out the driveway if there is no passenger in 5mins instead of looking bored.

I might only return to the hotel if I dont hv many luggages & shopping bags with me.",4,2014,07,13
231,Average,"An average hotel in the heart of Dublin. Good value for money in terms of location. Not a patch on the Gresham, however and I will insist on staying there next time. If you spend less time in the hotel, this could be the one for you because of the location - close to temple bar etc..",3,2014,07,13
231,Accommodating,My son and I stayed here in June of 2014 for five nights. It is easy to find and conveniently located to almost anything you want to do in Dublin. It is within walking distance to an Air Coach drop off from the airport. Our room was clean and perfect for the two of us.  The entire property was well kept and modern.The staff was friendly and very accommodating. We had a slight issue with other unruly guests on one night and they were kind enough to re locate our room and honor the night stay with a refund.,4,2014,07,11
231,Great hotel!,"Stayed here on a weekend break to Dublin. Lovely hotel, very secure, pleasant staff, and the rooms were large and had very comfy beds. 
I didn't eat here so can't comment on food, but it's in a great location and there are so many cafes and restaurants within walking distance. 
The view from the bedroom window wasn't great, but that's a minor inconvenience. 
I'll definitely be back, can recommend it to anyone thinking of staying in our capital city...
",5,2014,07,10
231,A happy week-end in Dublin,"Jurys Inn staff is really outstanding. The hotel offers a cost-effective lodging option in a very convenient part of central Dublin where main attractions are within walking distance. Rooms are impeccably clean, couple beds are of a good size and both the mattress and pillows provided were of quite good quality. The only drawback is the fact that the hotel has not yet invested in an individual safe deposit box inside the room and in case you want to carry your valuable items with you, you will have the trouble of keeping them downstairs next to the front desk.",5,2014,07,09
231,Great place to stay in Dublin,Clean modern hotel with everything you need including an iron.Central location .Staff lovely- friendly and helpful .Breakfast great and bar a good option.Definitely recommend it for singles or families,5,2014,07,08

231,A week sight seeing in Dublin,A pleasant hotel situated in the centre of Dublin. My partner and i stayed there for 5 days in June and were quite impressed with hotel. It is not the cheapest but very busy with pleasant staff. Parnells bar situated nearby provides an excellant eating house with very goos staff.,4,2014,07,08

El personal muy amable, algunos són españoles. Hotel muy comodo y tranquilo. La cama és muy àmplia y Todó estaba muy limpio. Havia plancha y secador de pelo. Y el desayuno self service miycompleto.",4,2024,10,17
231,All in all Very good,"The hotel offers very nice and modern rooms with clean bathroom. Unfortunately, with the windows open it is often a bit loud even at night, as the hotel is located on a busy street. Staff are friendly and helpful. Nevertheless, I can recommend the place!",4,2024,10,15
231,A pleasant stay,"Hotel with very convenient location both for connections to the airport and for walking around the city. I stayed with my children and we easily reached all the destinations of interest on foot. New structure, clean and well maintained. Courteous staff.",5,2024,09,06
231,Central location,"For us very good location because we had booked a few tours that started around the corner mostly around 7.00. 
For this reason, the hotel breakfast was also only interesting on a few days, which we booked punctually the night before. 
The rooms were relatively modern and overall quiet (except when the other guests talked drunk on the hallway for longer).",4,2024,08,08
231,Good choice,"Very pleasant atmosphere,Nice staff, on request such as an additional blanket, a third room key or 2 additional shower towels were fulfilled immediately.
The rooms are quite soundproof.The showers Clean, cleaned and without mold on the silicone mass.

Bit of a pity was that the rooms were so freshly renovated that even the rubber remains of the cables under the can layers.

But all in all top. 
I like to book once",4,2024,08,01
231,OK for one night,"Overall it was OK. We slept well.

However, the whole hotel has an extremely strong smell and the staff are not on the ball.

There is no toilet in the lobby. You are directed to the bar on the first floor. However, you cannot use the elevator without a room card.",3,2024,06,11
231,Where is the focus here,"For a short stay, we had to find two single rooms and we chose this hotel.
As soon as we arrived, I noticed a strong smell in the large reception hall that is not good for people who are allergic to odors. But thank God it was only ""misted"" in the hall.
The staff were nice and helpful, both at reception and at breakfast.
The room - on the 5th floor at the back - was well equipped and would have had enough space for two people's suitcases etc. An iron, kettle, coffee and tea were available.

The mattress was very soft and the blanket, a 160 cm blanket in one piece - too bulky and warm

Unfortunately, the cleanliness does not meet the standard - everything was visible without having to look for long:

- Dirt in the shower fan
- Bathroom door completely smeared on the inside
- Lamp next to the mirror dusty

The breakfast buffet seemed clean, but the sliced cheese already had dry edges at 7.30 a.m. and there was only one type of sausage except on the first morning. The focus here seems to be on visitors who eat bratwurst and fried eggs in the morning

Rooms at the back are also subject to noise at night when the room is closed",3,2024,04,14
231,Central and comfortable,"Excellent hotel for its central location, for the quality of the facilities and especially for the attention from Gema, very attentive and decisive. Highly recommended for those people who want to spend a few days getting to know Dublin",5,2024,01,13
231,Excellent service and a very good hotel.,"The hotel is very nice, very clean and has an excellent location. The room is very spacious, the beds are very large and comfortable. The bathroom is very clean and well equipped. The receptionist, Miss Gema, is very friendly with a great sense of collaboration, she treated us excellently and was very attentive to answering all our questions.",5,2024,01,02
231,very good relation cost quality,"The hotel is very well located, 10 minutes from the city center on foot, one block from Henry Street and very well connected to the airport by bus. Very comfortable beds. I highlight the attention of Mateo Pronzati who has been very kind to us and made everything easier. I will repeat without a doubt!",5,2023,10,12
231,Excellent price-quality ratio,"We stayed at this hotel during our vacation, very well connected to the airport, many bus and metro stops nearby. Just 15 minutes walk from the center.
Special thanks for the help of Mateo Pronzati at the reception, super friendly and attentive.
On our next trip to Dublin we will stay at this hotel again.",5,2023,10,12
231,Very good,"We stayed two nights in this hotel and enjoyed it very much, despite being a three star. Nice room, clean, good breakfast. It is centrally located so we could get around Dublin on foot, without taking any means of transport.",4,2023,09,12
231,Discreet,"Hotel located in a strategic point for getting around the city, good quality/price ratio, very helpful and kind multilingual staff, plentiful but monotonous breakfast, hygiene...Irish: you eat without a tablecloth, not even paper, on tables with a sticky surface due to the products used to ""clean"" them, the rooms have stained carpets. Overall I think that all in all I would recommend it, but I see the 4 stars as ""stretched"".",3,2023,08,19
231,Hotel que no es 4 estrellas,Le pongo 4 porque la atención de los empleados fue excelente; tuvimos que utilizar el servicio contratado de médico al viajero y se encargaron de hablar y de coordinar la ida al hospital. Pero no se puede considerar un hotel 4 estrellas; no hay frigobar y los colchones estaban vencidos. Bastante ruidoso y se escuchaban los ruidos de las habitaciones contiguas. Es de destacar la amplitud de la habitación y del baño.,4,2023,07,19
231,Fantástico ,"Estuvimos alojados solo una noche pero me habría encantado quedarme más, ya que es comodísimo.
📍La ubicación es muy buena, céntrica y cerca de comercios, pubs, zona turística, etc. También es muy accesible en transporte público.
🛏️ La habitación me pareció muy cómoda, amplia y bien equipada. La cama era super cómoda, dormí fantásticamente, varias almohadas y bien mulliditas. Suelo con moqueta, varios enchufes, escritorio y hervidor de agua con te e infusiones de cortesía. 
🚽 Baño limpio, no tan amplio como la habitación, con bañera (no plato de ducha) y sin secador.
🥗 Comida muy rica! Cenamos en grupo y nos dieron tres opciones a elegir entre starter, primero y postre, y estaba todo muy bueno. 🥐 Desayuno tipo buffet muy completo con diferentes tipos de pan, mermeladas, bollería, English breakfast,... 
🤵🏻‍♂️🤵🏻‍♀️ Personal muy amable, tanto en recepción como en el restaurante y cafetería. Incluso Ana, una de las chicas de recepción, era española y nos ayudó mucho con la gestión  del check-in.
📶 Buena conexión Wi-Fi en habitación y zonas comunes. ",5,2023,06,22
231,"Muy buen hotel, precios un tanto elevados","· · ·· Tenéis detallada toda la información del alojamiento así como un completo itinerario para visitar Dublín en mi BLOG, LOS VIAJES DE ALI FOG.
- Habitación amplia y luminosa.
- Nos cambiaron las toallas todos los días.
- Personal muy amable.
- Ubicación al lado de la parada de autobús del Aircoach (el bus que nos trae y nos lleva directos al aeropuerto). No está en la zona con más ambiente o mejor ambiente de Dublín, pero es cierto que llegas caminando en pocos minutos a The Temple Bar (el barrio), que es un poco el epicentro de la ciudad.
- Tiene un supermercado Lidl a pocos metros.

**** No gustó · Nos fastidió tener que pagar 616€ por solo 4 noches, pero todos los hoteles que miramos tenían precios similares. Nuestro guía del free tour, Álvaro de @paseandoporirlanda, nos comentó que por culpa de la guerra de Ucrania los hoteles dublineses han tenido que acoger a muchos refugiados ucranianos por lo que tienen menos habitaciones libres y han tenido que subir el precio de las mismas.",4,2023,05,01
231,Dublino,"Hotel in posizione ok.
Colazione nella norma, tralasciando che le macchinette del caffè erano tutte guaste e non servivano ne espresso e ne cappuccino.
Le camere sinceramente sporche, la moquette macchiata, le stanze venivano rassettate nel pomeriggio alle 18 abbiamo dovuto attendere nella hall perché la stavano incominciando a pulirla.
Non c’era il frigo nella camera.
Arredamento vetusto e scrostato.
Non mi sembra in linea con le quattro stelle.",2,2023,03,28
231,Buena experiencia,"Todo genial. Desayuno abundantes y de buena calidad.  Recepción que habla castellano. 
Las habitaciones espaciosas, lo que no me gustó es que no tiene alcachofa de la ducha que no sea fija. 
La situación genial. Está cercano a bares y lugares de ocio.",4,2023,02,26
231,War gut,"Die Executive Zimmer waren ein bissle klein, vor allem das Wc, aber generell sehr schön. Reinigung und Service super. Es gab Snacks, Tee und Kaffee und die Zeitung aufs Zimmer. Schönes Hotel mit freundlichen Mitarbeitern, guten Frühstück und leckerem Bier in der Bar.",4,2023,02,13
231,Soggiorno,"L'albergo è pulito e centrale, la colazione è ottima e abbondante, il personale è molto disponibile,gentilissimo e paziente. L'unica cosa è che dovrebbero rimodernare le camere . Da consigliare sicuramente",4,2023,02,12
231,Buona base di spostamento ,"È un hotel funzionale, con una posizione semicentrale che permette ottimi spostamenti. Ambiente silenzioso con personale giovane e disponibile. Si potrebbe fare meglio nell'arredo delle camere, soprattutto i bagni. ",3,2023,02,12
231,weekend tra amiche,"abbiamo prenotato una camera tripla, check in rapido ed efficiente, ci assegnano una camera al quarto piano con vista panoramica davvero ampia e molto bella, ma.... bagno per disabili (non richiesto) con tenda doccia, bidet mancante (ahime!) e senza riscaldamento!!!! anche la camera molto fredda senza possibilità di poter modificare temperatura. Abbiamo più volte richiesto sia al personale di piano che alla reception dotazione di asciugamani per 3 persone, ma non li hanno mai messi. Per il resto tutto perfetto. In corridoio si trovano 2 dispenser per acqua e ghiaccio. Colazione non usufruita. Meravigliosa la posizione vicina al centro e alle fermate del bus da/per aeroporto",4,2023,02,06
231,Bueno para unos días ,"Hotel cómodo: buena cama ,buena ducha. Limpio. Desayuno completo pero café de 5.
Las personas de recepción deberían de mejorar su atención.
Sin ruido y cerca del centro para ir paseando. Quizás un poco caro pero es lo que hay en Dublín.",4,2022,10,18
231,PENSAVO MEGLIO,"Camera abbastanza spaziosa ma tutto sommato piccola per 3 persone, senza armadio chiuso (c'erano solo pochi ometti per appendere le giacche all'ingresso). 
Il bagno piccolo, con la vasca (con tanto di tendina) al posto della doccia. 
I letti invece molto comodi.  
La colazione a buffet di tipo continentale è abbondante ma non vengono servite le bevande calde; c'è solo un distributore automatico.
Inoltre (non abbiamo avuto modo di chiedere) non capiamo perché i nostri amici che avevano la camera doppia avessero sconti, acqua, giornali e caffè Nespresso a disposizione compresi nel prezzo mentre noi con la tripla non avevamo nulla. 
Il personale alla reception professionale.",3,2022,08,25
231,Mejorable,"El hotel está bien, un poco descuidadas las habitaciones y los baños. Bien ubicado,  cerca de O'Connell Street, a 10 minutos a pie de Temple Bar. Desayuno bien, pero no remplazan los productos con mucha rapidez y puedes encontrarte con todo prácticamente agotado. Trato bueno, pero se nota que el personal no tiene gran experiencia. Mejorable en general. ",3,2022,08,18
231,Buon punto di partenzaa Dublino,"Tipico hotel internazionale  con gente che arriva a qualsiasi ora . Bello , pulito, efficiente. Camere spaziose. Ottima posizione per visitate la città . Peccato non avere una macchina del caffè in camera Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo",4,2022,08,14
231,Perfetto per visitare la citta’,"A 10’ da Temple Bar, a 15’ dal Trinity College, siamo rimasti 4 notti,2 adulti e 2 bambini di 5 e 10 anni. 
Le camere non sono grandissime, ma come altri htl in zona centrale, e cmq pulite. Personale molto gentile e disponibile, abbiamo solo dormito senza colazione, ma l’htl e’ circondato da diversi Deli e supermercati per cui non e’ difficile comprare a qualsiasi ora. 
Unica pecca, non si possono aprire le finestre (che con la quantita’ di gabbiani affamati forse e’ un bene), per cui il ricircolo dell’aria e’solo interno e condizionato.",4,2022,08,10
231,Hotel bien situado,"Lo primero y remarcable es lo bien situado que está. Cierto es que las calles aledañas no son muy bonitas, pero por ejemplo la Moore Street tiene mucha historia y el Spire está a 5 minutos, lo que viene genial si has reservado algún tour de calle o de bus porque es el punto de encuentro.

Lo segundo importante es la tranquilidad. No se oía a los clientes que estuvieran en habitaciones cercanas, la cama era muy cómoda al igual que las almohadas y había plancha y cafetera. En general, mi habitación era amplia y adecuada.

Sin embargo, del desayuno no puedo decir nada ya que tuve un problema con la reserva, la cual se hizo a través de trip quienes no habían volcado la información al sistema de mi hotel y parece que no constaba como reservado. Por tanto, tuve que buscar un sitio para ello. Cerca pasando la Moore Street hay un pasaje y casi al final a la derecha hay un café buenísimo con productos de buena calidad. El desayuno en el hotel vale 25€ sin ninguna rebaja.

El director se portó muy bien conmigo al ponerse en contacto por teléfono con esa página web en la cual reservé y no había forma de encontrar mi reserva. Gracias por ello.

En realidad no parece un hotel de cuatro estrellas pero hay ciertos aspectos que lo avalan.",3,2022,08,01
231,Buen hotel,"Habitacion muy grande con secador, plancha y cafetera. Muy bien ubicado al lado de un shoppimg con patio de comidas. La zona alrededor es medio fea de noche, El unico hotel de todos los que visite que 2 señoritas hablaban español,   Excelente desayuno.",4,2022,07,26
231,Pésimo,"Para empezar, la habitación fue pésima, casi sin iluminación y aire. Por otro lado, la limpieza fue prácticamente inexistente, se olvidaban de las toallas día a día y además la habitación olía a moqueta. El buffet por otra parte, no poseía nada destacable, poca calidad e insuficiente servicio. Finalmente, en relación a la recepción, resaltamos la escasa atención y en ocasiones, la falta de personal.",2,2022,07,26
231,Wenig für viel,"293 € für ein EZ mit Blick auf den Innenhof. Und das inkl. 10% Rabatt. Das muss was Großartiges sein! War es aber nicht. Es hat gemüffelt auf dem Zimmer und die Mischbatterie kannte nur heiß oder kalt, um nur zwei enttäuschende Details zu nennen. Positiv: gute Lage, Frühstücksbuffet war o k. (14 €), freundliches Personal. Fazit trotzdem: Wucher! ",3,2022,07,24
231,Jugendherbergsfeeling zum Preis eines 4-Sterne-Hotels,"Hotel in guter Lage, aber damit endet auch schon die positive Bewertung. 

Der Check in dauerte mehr als 20 Minuten, weil ständig irgendetwas nicht ging. 
Die Fußböden sind abgewetzt, das Badezimmer ist ""neu"" gemacht, aber der Türknauf zum Badezimmer ist kaputt. Die Badezimmerausstattung ist unvollständig (Toilettenbürste fehlt). 
Der Zimmerservice kommt nur wenn man ihn explizit bestellt (wir reden hier von einem 4-Sterne-Hotel, nicht von einer Jugenherberge), was man angeblich vergessen hatte mir beim Check In zu sagen. Es wird nicht einmal das Bett gemacht oder kurz reingeschaut, ob alles im Zimmer in Ordnung ist. Dies ist angeblich der Pandemie geschuldet, weil das Personal so wenig Kontakt wie möglich zu den Gästen haben soll. Der Zimmerservice war noch nie in meinem Zimmer, solange ich anwesend war, von daher ist das eine faule Ausrede. Ich musste am zweiten Tag bereits 4 mal die Schlüsselkarten neu programmieren lassen, weil sie ständig nicht funktionieren. Das Hotel ist überhaupt nicht zu empfehlen. Das einzige was 4 Sterne verdächtig ist, ist der Preis, alles andere ist eher Jugenherbergsniveau.",1,2022,06,06
231,"Nella media, un buon soggiorno ","Buon hotel di appoggio per visitare Dublino.
La camera tripla è base, un po piccola forse è manca qualche piccolo dettaglio che renderebbe il soggiorno più confortevole, ma tutto sommato ci siamo trovati bene.
Colazione completa e abbastanza fornita, lo consiglio!",4,2022,05,20
231,Consigliato,"Albergo in posizione ottima, vicino al centro, su una strada con molti negozi ma tranquilla di notte e vicino alla fermata dei bus da e per l'aeroporto. La stanza executive era molto spaziosa, luminosa e confortevole. Tutte le mattine ci venivano forniti snack, biscotti, bevande gassate, un quotidiano e nella stanza erano disponibili il bollitore con tè e tisane e una macchina del caffè con le capsule",5,2022,05,16
231,Nice Buisness Hotel,"Guter Standard. Gutes englisches Frühstück. Zimmer zweckmäßig und ruhig. Viele Kissen :-)

231,NON TORNO MANCO GRATIS!!,"Soggiorno di 4 giornI, Non è prevista PULIZIA DELLA CAMERA...noi famiglia di 4 persone in camera piccola spacciata per family room, immaginate il casino. 
Ottima Location, ma un po' di EuroCiviltà sarebbe meglio.

Bango senza scovolino.... sarà usanza Locale????
Dimenticavo 4 giorni 900euro...
NON TORNO MANCO GRATIS!!!

231,Pésimo. Lo peor de lo peor.,"No entiendo como puede haber gente que califica este antro como bueno; supongo que nunca han viajado o que viven en una chabola, porque otra explicación no le encuentro. Esto de cuatro estrellas sólo tiene la basura. Desayuno pésimo y escaso. Habitaciones sucias. Dicen que limpian cada cinco días por razones del covid en un país que no tiene ninguna restricción; en realidad es para ahorrarse sueldos. Tienes que pedir toallas o lo que necesites, y no te ponen ni una mísera botella de agua. La basura, si no quieres tenerla en la habitación, tienes que sacarla tú.",1,2022,04,13
231,Ideal ubicación y trato,"Su ubicación es muy céntrica y cerca de todo.
Muy amable y agradable el trato con los huéspedes.
Las habitaciones confortables.
Posee todos los servicios necesarios para tu estancia.
Altamente recomendable.",4,2022,03,03
231,hoteles jurys,que quiten la bañera y o por lo menos las cortinas ya que me parecen antihigienicas. por lo demas todo bien o excelente. ademas el español es el 3 idioma mas hablado del mundo o el segundo creo recordar y deberia de tener esa formacion.,4,2022,03,01
231,Demasiado caro para el mal servicio ofrecido,"Lo único fue la ubicación al lado de Parnell Street y The Spire.
No puedo entender que un hotel de 4 estrellas con semejante precio ofrezca un servicio tan flojo y lamentable. Y que se use la excusa del Covid para ello cuando, en realidad, se trata de un mero ahorro de costes.

No había servicio de limpieza ""housekkeping"" de habitaciones, tú mismo debías ordenar tu habitación, pedir las toallas limpias en la recepción o dejar tu basura en el pasillo.

Si se ofrece el servicio de un hostel, que se pague como un hostel. 
Lo que no se puede hacer es pagar el precio de un hotel de 4 estrellas por un servicio tan decepcionante y limitado.",1,2022,01,23
231,Giusto compromesso per qualche giorno,Hotel con servizi e qualità sufficienti per alloggiare a Dublino per qualche giorno. Personale gentile e disponile anche nella prenotazione di servizi quali esempio il covid test. Camere spaziose e bagno altrettanto grande. Qualità della colazione assai scadente. Prezzo nella media. Posizione buona per accedere al centro e ai servizi di trasporto pubblico.,4,2022,01,23
231,Best für Dublin Änfänger,"Nette und schnelle Bedienung, gutes Frühstück, sensationelle Lage in Dublin, klasse Betten, ruhige Zimmer…..in der Nähe eines der ältesten pubs , gegenüber das prämierte Fischrestaurant, nebenan ein Tesco Laden für Wasser….
Mit Adam als Barmann ein Juwel des Herzens für Drinks in der Bar….
Was will man mehr?",5,2022,01,17
231,"2 stelle,non 4","Non vale 4 stelle. Moquette e poltrone inguardabili, vetuste e macchiate, la fiera dell’acaro. Bagno poco confortevole. Letto addossato al muro, difficile scendere da un lato. Mancanza frigobar e cassaforte in camera. Stanza pulita all’ingresso e mai più rigovernata (letto non rifatto, manco svuotati i cestini) perché ho soggiornato solo due notti. Receptionist inefficiente. Ho pagato tutto in anticipo, fatto da me check in e check out online. Chiesto solo di prenotarmi un taxi per arrivare per tempo a fermata bus per cork, mi ha prenotato in ritardo e ho perso il bus (il taxi mi lAsciato , tardissimo, a notevole distanza dalla fermata).",2,2021,12,22

Il riscaldamento non è mai funzionato.
Non fanno servizio di riordino camera giornaliero.",2,2021,12,20
231,Buena opción y situación ,"Buen hotel con una buena situación. Es una cadena y hay varios por Irlanda. Con  el Covid-19 estaban restringidos algunos servicios pero si los pedías en recepción, te los hacían. La habitación era espaciosa y limpia, así como el baño. El personal era muy amable, sobretodo una chica de recepción. Nos dejamos unos pendientes, envié un mensaje y los recuperé. ",4,2021,12,10
231,Onesto,"Hotel in un'ottima posizione (proprio nel centro di Dublino). La camere sono abbastanza grandi con un buona pulizia, prezzo più che onesto. Consigliato per chi vuole passare qualche giorni a Dublino..",4,2021,12,10
231,Sabor agridulce,"Lo mejor del hotel es sin duda su ubicación. A pocos minutos a pie tienes todo lo que se puede visitar en Dublín. Además, a un par de minutos andando tienes la parada del bus del aeropuerto y la de los autobuses que hacen excursiones. 
El hotel en sí está bastante bien y al llegar a la habitación estaba limpia.
Pero no nos gustó nada que el check-in fuese a partir de las 16:00 horas, ya que llegamos muy temprano por la mañana y no pudimos hacer uso de la habitación hasta las 4 de la tarde. 
Tampoco nos gustó el personal del hotel, muy frío y seco en el trato, dando muestras de que les importábamos poco. Cuando les pedí si me podían prestar un adaptador para los enchufes, me vendieron uno por 5 euros. 
Lo peor de todo es el tema de la limpieza. Lo había leído en comentarios de clientes pero no me lo creía hasta que lo vi con mis ojos. Atención: No limpian las habitaciones durante la estancia, no cambian las toallas, no hacen la cama, no retiran la basura (la tienes que sacar tú a la puerta por la noche). Es increíble que un hotel de 4 estrellas, ponga como excusa el covid para no hacer las habitaciones.",2,2021,12,07
231,Escapada a Dublín,"(+) Es un hotel muy cercano a O'Connell street, en un barrio con supermercados, algún restaurante y sobre todo tiendas de ropa, regalos, etc. Está a 10 minutos de Temple Bar. El check in es on line. La habitación es cómoda, con hervidor de agua, un excelente cuarto de baño. Limpieza. La wifi funciona razonablemente bien.

(-) Creo que en el siglo en el que estamos la moqueta y la cortina de la ducha pueden pasar al siglo XVII, de donde nunca deberían de haber salido. La ventana no puede abrirse bien, lo que dificulta el correcto aireado de la habitación. No cambian las toallas salvo que las dejes en la puerta, fuera en el pasillo. Algo un tanto raro.",4,2021,11,10
231,Halloween in Dublin,"Hotel liegt super zentral mitten im Zentrum und dennoch ruhig, Klasse Frühstück, das keine Wünsche offen lässt. Hotel- Management und Empfang kümmern sich kompetent und individuell um jedes Anliegen des Gastes",5,2021,11,06
231,Jugendherbergsniveau der 60er Jahre zum Luxuspreis,"Ich weiß nicht, wie die guten Bewertungen, die ich im Vorfeld gelesen habe, zustande gekommen sind, wir reisen seit Jahrzehnten in der Weltgeschichte herum aber so einen Reinfall haben wir noch nie erlebt! 500€ für 3 Nächte bezahlt und einen abgewrackten Raum mit nicht funktionierender Heizung bekommen, verschimmeltes Bad, Zimmer Schlüssel innerhalb von 24 Stunden 4 mal nicht funktioniert! Zimmer Service? Fehlanzeige, Badsäuberung oder Handtuchwechsel sind auch auf Nachfrage nicht möglich! Absolut nicht empfehlenswert!",1,2021,10,23
231,L'apparenza inganna. ,"Imponente hotel e molto chic, ma ahimè l'apparenza inganna. Le camere te le lasciano così come sono, non fanno affatto ingresso nella stanza per pulirla. Asciugamani sporchi, cestino ecc, vanno riposti fuori dalla porta. Per quanto riguarda il personale invece, ci sono giovani receptionist di una cortesia unica, ma c'è il receptionist che solitamente effettua il turno notturno di una antipatia unica. Leggermente fuori mano l'albergo, tipo a 7 minuti a piedi dal Temple Bar. Tutto fumo e niente arrosto. ",2,2021,09,12
231,Me esperaba un poco más,"Hotel con servicio de recepción muy buena, trabajadores que siempre quieren ayudar, la habitación fue casi aceptable, en mi habitación no funcionaba el aire acondicionado y se le pasaba muy mal en la noche ya que hacía mucho calor, baño nun poco antiguo pero aceptable, en el desayuno entregan una bolsa con una bollería dura, una magdalena, un yogurt con granola y una ensalada de frutas en la puerta de la habitación, ya que se puede cenar en el bar del hotel, fuese bueno que organizadamente a base de horas establecidas o a seleccionar la gente pueda desayunar allí mismo",3,2021,09,09
231,Tranquilo,"Hotel bien situado, habitación comoda y sin ruido. Colchón cómodo y espacio.
Baño bien.
No hacen las habitaciones. Estuvimos 3 días y no la hicieron pero casi mejor. Las recepcionistas un poco ariscas, tendrían que ser más amables. Volveremos",4,2021,09,09
231,Pulizia sempre su richiesta,"A quanto pare la pulizia è sempre su richiesta, non ci è stato detto o comunque non ci hanno avvisato subito, l'abbiamo scoperto il giorno dopo leggendo il foglio con varie informazioni lasciato in camera. Non credo ci sta come hotel a 4 stelle, forse l'unica cosa buona è la posizione comoda, camera e letto confortevole e tutto abbastanza pulito, anche se mancavano un po di cose tra cui un minifrigo o altri . Però non è stato proprio un problema sia per il prezzo che abbiamo pagato e sia per il fatto che io e il mio ragazzo eravamo sempre fuori in giro. 
PS: un dettaglio che vorrei aggiungere, il panorama dalla finestra non è stato chissa quale spettacolo (almeno dalla nostra camera)",3,2021,09,08
231,Zu empfehlen!,"Sehr schönes, sauberes Hotel. Kurzer Fußweg in die Stadt. Frühstück wurde früh vor die Zimmertür gestellt (z.B. Joghurt, O-Saft, Gebäck). Abends geht die Tür nicht mehr von alleine auf, man klingelt und ein Mitarbeiter der Rezeption lässt einen rein.",4,2021,08,31
231,No es el más recomendable.,"Hotel  con buen trato en recepción , personal agradable, habitaciones y camas solo aceptables, baño normal, carece  de desayuno en condiciones , entregan una bolsa con un yoghurt y una manzana y poco más en la puerta de la habitación , esperaba más de este hotel.",2,2021,08,30
231,Scadente,"Moquette con macchie. Non c'è niente: frigo, cassaforte, cuffia doccia...niente.
La cosa peggiore la pulizia della camera non è quotidiana. Siamo tornati la sera e abbiamo trovato il letto disfatto, gli asciugamani bagnati per terra. Questo albergo dovrebbe essere 2 stelle al massimo. Una fregatura. ",1,2021,08,01
231,Buon weekend,"Albergo centrale e super comodo per la sua posizione, stanze graziose e tutto più o meno pulito. 
Norme anti covid rispettate e presenti, fin qui tutto bene.
Unica grande pecca credo sia il personale, maleducati e sgarbato e poco onesti, non so per quale ragione abbiano insistito ogni giorno con i pagamenti ( quando è stato tutto completato al momento del check in, con tanto di ricevute).",3,2021,07,30
231,Angenehmer Aufenthalt,"Die Rezeptionisten waren jederzeit überaus freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Zimmer war sauber und ruhig (für blöde Nachbarn kann das Hotel nichts). Das Frühstücksbuffet war dem Preis angemessen und ok. Fehlende Dinge wurden sofort ersetzt. Für uns war die Lage super, da wir alles zu Fuß oder per Bus und Bahn problemlos erreichen konnten. ",5,2020,03,30
231,Ottima assistenza clienti,"Purtroppo non ho potuto soggiornare in questo hotel a causa dell'emergenza sanitaria attuale. Ho cancellato tutta la prenotazione (3 adulti per 3 notti) e avevo già versato la caparre.
Lo staff fin da subito si è dimostrato sensibile e disponibile al dialogo.
Hanno accetto la mia richiesta di rimborso e restituito in tempi brevissimi la caparra.
Grazie ancora.
In questo momento difficile è bello sapere che ci sono strutture sensibili e attenti.
Sicuramente quando la situazione a livello globale ritornerà alla normalità prenoterò la camera in questo hotel.
A presto e buona fortuna a tutti!",5,2020,03,20
231,Buen Hotel,"El hotel está bien situado y el servicio es bueno. Calidad precio bastante bien.
Del centro histórico está a unos 10min, pero está a 1minuto de una de las calles mas comerciales de Dublin. El desayuno es siempre lo mismo y muy normalito",4,2020,02,26
231,Ideal para quienes deciden visitar Dublín por primera vez,"El Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street es ideal para quienes deciden visitar Dublín por primera vez: a escasos cinco minutos de o´Connel Street (donde te deja el autobús que llega desde el Aeropuerto), se encuentra en una calle que, si bien está muy transitada a todas horas (autobuses, tranvías, coches y motos), no escuchábamos ni un sólo ruido. La limpieza era la correcta (sí que había algunas zonas con polvo en el baño, por ejemplo), pero la cama era firme y las almohada esponjosas. Justo lo que necesita alguien que sólo quiere el hotel para dormir, y tal vez desayunar.

A un minuto tienes Tesco y Lidl, por no hablar de una calle comercial con más supermercados.

El personal fue siempre muy correcto y amable. Cuando la agencia Darby O'Gill nos dejó tirados para una excursión, la persona en recepción se apresuró a mostrarnos otras opciones de excursiones y sitios turísticos que visitar para no perder el día.

Los vecinos eran ruidosos, pero eso no es culpa del hotel. Y si bien no indica que tengan en la descripción de la habitación, NO HAY minibar. Es algo a tener en cuenta porque, repito, el hotel no miente al respecto, pero es de esas cosas que los viajeros solemos dar por sentado.",4,2020,02,23
231,"Ottima posizione, 10/15 minuti a piedi da Temple Bar","Molto pulito, ottima colazione e a pochissimi passi dal centro di Dublino e dalla vita di Temple Bar. Li vicino anche i trasporti pubblici, per raggiungere i posti in centro, ma leggermente più distanti",5,2020,02,07

Colazione super abbondante le camere spaziose e tranquille che altro dire ??? Soddisfatto in pieno !!!!! Peccato non avere qualche giorno in più ...;) ",5,2020,02,07
231,Ottimo!,"Albergo centralissimo su Parnell Street: se arrivate dall'aeroporto, il bus vi lascerà a poche decine di metri dall'ingresso.

Cordialissimi i ragazzi della reception: il check in è stato rapido e, per i giorni in cui siamo usciti molto presto per le escursioni, sono stati disponibili nel prepararci una sorta di ""colazione al sacco"" (frutta, tramezzini e succo).

L'ascensore funziona con la chiave della stanza (ottimo per la sicurezza) e sui piani sono presenti macchinette per il ghiaccio e distributori di snack.

Le camere sono ampie e comode, complete di scrivania, comodini e armadio. Il wi fi è perfettamente funzionante. 

Presenti l'asciugacapelli e i dispenser con sapone per le mani e bagnoschiuma.

La sala colazione è al primo piano, le ragazze sono rapide a fare il controllo e indicano a quale tavolo accomodarsi. C'è un'ampia scelta per il salato (pane di vari tipi, uova, bacon, fagioli, salumi e formaggi), forse meno varietà per il dolce ma, tutto sommato, il cibo è buono e fresco e non si hanno difficoltà a trovare prodotti di proprio gradimento.

Le pulizie sono giornaliere.

Rapporto qualità/prezzo buono: consigliato!",4,2020,02,04

La ubicación no es la mejor pero está muy muy bien, a 5-10 minutos andando del río y a 15 del Temple Bar.
La habitación era sencilla pero estaba genial. La cama era grande y cómoda. Disponía de secador de pelo y plancha para ropa. El wifi funcionó a la perfección.
El personal fue muy amable en todo momento.
El desayuno estaba bueno aunque nada del otro mundo. Buen Irish breakfast, variedad de pan, de mantequillas y mermeladas. También variedad de frutas. Tenían opciones sin gluten apartadas del resto y con su propia tostadora. El café y los zumos eran flojos.

Hacian 3 grados en Dublin y no funcionaba el aire acondicionado, asi que en las 3 noches que estuvimos tuvimos que dormir con una estufa en el medio de nuestra habiatcion.

Zu den Speisen kann ich nichts sagen da wir immer unterwegs gegessen haben es roch aber immer sehr lecker :) 
Obwohl wir hier nichts verzehrt haben würde ich es unfair dem Hotel gegenüber finden deshalb einen Punkt abzuziehen und das wäre nicht gerechtfertigt da wir voll und ganz zufrieden waren und sehr gerne beim nächsten mal wieder kommen :)",5,2019,11,16
231,Perfetto,"Albergo situato in centro a Dublino.
Pulito e con stanze spaziose.
Molto comodo sia per la visita ai monumenti ma sopratutto per la vita notturna.

231,Solides Hotel zentral gelegen,"Gutes solides Hotel in guter Lage und sehr guter Verkehrsanbindung. Keine 5 Sterne aber für einen Städtetrip zu empfehlen. 
Ohne essen gebucht also kein Kommentar über Verpflegung. Gegenüber ist ein Tesco dort bekommt man morgens Brötchen und Gebäck. Frühstück ist nicht notwendig. Außerdem bieten viele Bar/ Restaurants Frühstück an. 
Hotel recht leise. Sauber und gute Zimmer. ",4,2019,11,05

231,"Bello, pulito e in ottima posizione","Ho soggiornato 5 notti con un amico, l'hotel si trova in ottima posizione centrale ma fuori dalla confusione di Temple Bar, a pochi passi dalle fermate dei bus per l'aeroporto.

Al nostro arrivo ci è stata assegnata subito la camera nonostante fossimo arrivati con largo anticipo sull'orario del check-in. 
Camera spaziosa, letti molto comodi, ottima la pulizia con cambio asciugamani giornaliero; per essere un 4* ci sono alcune lacune migliorabili, ovvero non è presente la cassaforte, il mini-bar, lo scopino del wc, le ciabattine e anche gli accessori di cortesia per il bagno scarseggiano (es. le cuffie per la doccia che possono essere utili per le donne).

Non abbiamo usufruito della colazione quindi non posso dare un parere in merito.

Ottima la sicurezza, senza tessera della camera gli ascensori non salgono.
Personale molto gentile.

Se dovessi tornare a Dublino tornerei senz'altro in questo hotel, consigliato!",4,2019,11,02
231,Schöne Tage zentral in Dublin,"Sehr freundliches hilfsbereites Personal besonders an der Rezeption und beim Frühstück. Das Hotel ist etwas in die Jahre gekommen, jedoch sehr sauber und gute Matratzen. Die Lage ist zentral aber nicht direkt im Tourismus          ",4,2019,10,27

231,Ottimo hotel!,"Durante la nostra seconda visita di Dublino, quest’anno abbiamo soggiornato per cinque notti in questo fantastico hotel. Si trova a due passi dal celebre Spire, proprio in centro, ma lontano dal caos delle vie più trafficate, il che consente di riposare bene. Si tratta di un hotel molto grande, con moltissime camere, ha anche una piccola palestra e vi è la possibilità di consumare la prima colazione e la cena, ma noi non ne abbiamo usufruito. La camera non è molto grande, ma è molto confortevole e pulita. I letti sono spaziosi e hanno molti cuscini. Il bagno è un po’ datato, l’unica pecca è la tenda nella vasca da bagno, che andrebbe, a nostro avviso, sostituita. Se torneremo a Dublino, soggiorneremo ancora qui!",4,2019,10,11
231,Ottima soluzione per visitare Dublino.,L'hotel si trova in una posizione centrale per visitare dublino. Le stanze sono sufficientemente ampie con letto molto comodo e pulite. Colazione nella norma. Unica nota stonata è che arrivando dopo mezzanotte il sistema ci ha registrati nella data del giorno successivo per cui vari servizi quali a colazione non risultava  la nostra presenza in sala e rientrando in serata abbiamo trovato la camera non rifatta. Va detto però che sono arrivate puntuali le scuse dell'hotel con consumazione gratuita al bar.,4,2019,10,10

231,muy flojo para el precio que pagamos,"buena ubicacion ,habitacion antigua ,carisimo,no merece la pena mirar otros cosas, moqueta vieja en los pasillos no tenia nada a destacar mas que estaba muy centrico pero eso no justifica los 280 euros que me cobraron por una habitacion individual incluido el desayuno en España no llegaria a un tres estrellas la foto que ponen no tiene nada que ver con la realidad",1,2019,10,02
231,Menos de lo que esperaba,"Hotel centrico, de casi 300€ la habitación de uso individual. Calidad por bajo de lo esperado. Aglomeraciones en los ascensores, sin posibilidad de utilizar escaleras. Desayuno buffet de calidad claramente mejorable. Relación precio calidad baja.",2,2019,09,29

231,Ambiente gut doch ausbaufähig,"Die Zimmer sind super sauber doch nicht immer praktisch. So gab es keine Sitzmöglichkeit für zwei Personen, obwohl Doppelzimmer, die Zimmertür ist so schwer zu öffnen, dass ältere Menschen sich sicherlich sehr anstrengen müssen, der Schließer ist zu stark eingestellt, im Bad gibt es zuwenig Ablagemöglichkeiten/haken für Handtücher und keine Toilettenbürste.
Das Personal in der bar sehr unterschiedlich, die jungen Damen sehr höflich und gepflegt, der junge Mann leider sehr streng im Geruch.
Würde sich hier etwas zum Positiven bewegen, würde ich den Sternen zustimmen, so finde ich 4 Sterne doch sehr übertrieben.",3,2019,09,07
231,Buon hotel a due passi da Temple bar,"Hotel pulito e confortevole vicino alla zona di Temple Bar.

231,100% recomendado,"En primer lugar la ubicación del hotel en la ciudad es perfecta, se encuentra muy céntrico y se llega caminando en 10-15 minutos o menos a los sitios más interesantes. 
En segundo lugar, las habitaciones son amplias y las camas cómodas. Ofrecen la posibilidad de preparar té y café con pastas en la habitación sin ningún tipo de coste adicional. Todos los días pasan a limpiar, hacer las camas y cambiar las toallas, y el suelo es de moqueta y no se escuchan pasos ni ningún tipo de ruido; las habitaciones están bien insonorizadas.
Además, los empleados son amables y atentos, dispuestos a ayudarte con lo que sea.
Por último, el desayuno que ofrecen está muy bien, un buffet con un gran variedad que se adecua a todos los gustos.
Si volviera a Dublín, sin duda alguna volvería a alojarme en este hotel.",5,2019,09,01

Der Express Chxk in lief reibungslos und man ist per Email informiert worden das das Zimmer bereits fertig ist (1,5 Stunden vorm Check In). Das Frühstücksbüffet war mehr als ausreichend da es auhh Alternativen zum Irischen/Britischen Frühstück gab war ich sehr begeistert.

Personal war freundlich und wir sind nett empfangen worden! 😉

231,Insomma... ,"L'hotel è situato in centro, ma appena fuori dalla calca più intensa, quindi ci si può spostare tranquillamente a piedi. Le camere sono molto standard, senza personalità e senza particolari pregi. Relativamente ampie, con bagno adeguato, anche se il nostro aveva la vasca con la tenda, scomoda e assai poco igienica. Nel complesso una buona pulizia, anche se gli asciugamani non erano immacolati diciamo. Colazione discreta, ma buffet non particolarmente ricco. In compenso la sala ristorante è ampia e confortevole. Pecca gravissima: se arrivate in macchina sappiate che il parcheggio convenzionato è un po' lontano, scomodo e costa 15€ al giorno. Non ci sono navette che portino dal parcheggio all'hotel e viceversa. Non ottimo il rapporto qualità/prezzo. ",3,2019,08,21
231,Cómodo,"Las camas super cómodas y el desayuno muy completo.
El personal muy atento y siempre que preguntamos o solicitabamos algo, no teniamos ningún problema. Pudimos dejar el equipaje después s del check out bastantes horas y con bastante control ya que nos ponian una etiqueta numerada, me dió bastante seguridad. ",4,2019,08,20

Realität: kleines enges Zimmer ohne die versprochene Ausstattung. Nach Reklamation ganze 35 Euro Reduktion bekommen - und ein anderes Zimmer. Das ist genauso eng (alle Zimmer! sind klein!) und geht zum stinkenden Hinterhof. Fazit: nicht hier buchen und vor allem nicht am Wochenende! Es gibt sicher einige Hotels mit besserem Preis Leistungsverhältnis in Dublin. Wir jedenfalls werden hier nie wieder übernachten. Krisenmanagement war sehr mau.",1,2019,07,06

Bekommen haben wir ein Krankenhauszimmer. Auf mehrfach Reklamation hin wollte man uns dann erst mit einem Gutschein für die Bar abspeisen. Erst als wir drohten Abzureisen und dies hier zu posten erhielten wir die Info das das Hotel Fully Booked wäre und man uns erst morgen ein anderes Zimmer geben könne. Nach einer Nacht im Hospizzimmer bekamen wir dann das gebuchte Zimmer und 50 Euro erstattet.  Vom Management, das wir sprechen wollten hat sich keiner aus der Deckung getraut.

noches 13-14 junio. Llegamos al hotel a las ocho de la tarde, cansados tras una semana de viaje por toda la isla. Al llegar nos dicen que hay un problema con la reserva y no tienen habitación para la primera noche. Tras la indignación inicial les pedimos como alternativa un hotel cercano y para las dos noches. Tras esperar 30 minutos nos piden un taxi para llevarnos al nuevo hotel y descubrimos que está en las afueras, a más de 10 kms del centro. Pedimos al taxista que nos devuelva al hotel donde ya muy enojados exigimos un hotel CÉNTRICO. Tras esperar otros 40 minutos por fin nos ofrecen un hotel en condiciones donde por cierto estuvimos muy a gusto (Hilton Garden Inn). Dos horas perdidas, disgusto, enfado, indignación. Ninguna consideración hacia un cliente que pagó 450 euros 45 días antes.",1,2019,06,16

231,Super Hotel in zentraler Lage,"Wir waren zum wiederholten Male im Juryˋs Inn in der Parnell Street. Die Betten sind sehr bequem, , die Zimmer haben eine angenehme Größe, so dass 2 große Koffer bequem Platz haben, ohne dass Man über sie fällt. Die zentrale Lage ist super, in wenigen Minuten ist man in der City . Das Frühstück ist auch ein Grund, weshalb wir immer wieder kommen. Sehr reichhaltig und lecker, für jeden was dabei und vor Allem das Full Irish Breakfast ist hier hervorragend. Aber auch der Kaffee schmeckt sehr gut, was man nicht von vielen Hotels behaupten kann. Ein kleines Manko habe ich allerdings, die Zimmer sind sehr hellhörig, da hofft man auf ruhige Zimmernachbarn. Wir kommen auf jeden Fall wieder. Klare Empfehlung von mir 👍",5,2019,05,13
231,Hospedaje,"Muy bueno el hospedaje, el hotel muy limpio, todos muy amables y el desayunos muy bueno y contundente, habían muchas opciones y fruta fresca, también distintos tipos de leche y etc. Los Irlandeses un encanto. Volvería una y mil veces. ",4,2019,05,12
231,Preis / Leistung stimmt,"
Sehr gute Lage Nähe dem Stadtzentrum. Die Sauberkeit in den Zimmern wäre zu verbessern, im grossen und ganzen waren wir zufrieden für den Preis.. Für 3 Pers. war das Zimmer klein. Die Mitarbeiter sind sehr freundlich. ",4,2019,05,09
231,Curiosa experiencia,"Nada más llegar nos encontramos a un señor en toalla de ducha con una niña en brazos en la recepción. 

Las habitaciones están limpias y amplias. Wifi gratis y la señal llega sin problemas a la habitación. El hotel tiene parking, aunque tienen convenio con uno que está muy cerca del hotel y te sale un poco mas barato. Puedes preguntarlo sin problemas en la recepción al llegar y ellos te lo explican.

El hotel es muy céntrico y tiene un Tesco enfrente.",4,2019,05,05
231,Nettes Hotel,"Lage des Hotels ist in Ordnung. Nicht ganz im Zentrum, ist aber fußläufig zu erreichen. Zimmer sind in Ordnung, gute Matratzen. Frühstück ist auch OK. Leider wurde der bei der Buchung angegebene Zimmerwunsch nach zwei Einzelbetten nicht berücksichtigt – Doppelbett ist für zwei Männer definitiv zu klein. Das Hotel war auch nicht in der Lage, ein anderes passendes Zimmer anzubieten. Zum Glück konnte ein Schlafsofa ausgeklappt werden – was dazu geführt hat, dass kein Platz mehr im Zimmer war.",4,2019,04,30
231,Non da 4 stelle,"Ho soggiornato 3 notti in questa struttura. Abbiamo pagato 90€ a testa con colazione inclusa per ogni notte, prezzo eccessivo per quello che l’hotel offre. Prima della partenza, ho cercato di contattare l’hotel in ogni modo possibile (sia per mail sia sulla chat di Facebook), senza mai avere risposta. Appena arrivati, abbiamo impiegato 40 minuti per fare il check-in, alla reception sembrava addirittura che si fossero dimenticati della nostra prenotazione. Alle 15 le camere non erano ancora pronte. Appena arrivati in camera, ho notato l’impronta di una mano sullo specchio che non era stata pulita; subito la pulizia mi è sembrata superficiale. La camera non è molto grande, inoltre avevamo prenotato una camera matrimoniale e ci è stata assegnata una camera tripla (con letto matrimoniale e letto singolo). Il letto è abbastanza comodo e c’è la possibilità di scegliere tra 2 cuscini. Non c’è il set di cortesia, cosa che dovrebbe essere quasi obbligatoria in un hotel a 4 stelle. Le uniche cose positive dell’hotel sono la posizione, poiché la struttura si trova a pochi metri della fermata del bus per l’aeroporto, a pochi metri da Parnell Square North da dov’è partita la nostra escursione per le Cliffs of Moher e abbastanza vicino al centro e alla stazione di Tara st., e la colazione, composta da un gran buffet di dolce e salato. Purtroppo, la colazione è disponibile a partire dalle 7, personalmente un po’ tardi, considerando che molte escursioni partono alle 6.30 dalla città. Quindi, per la nostra escursione, visto che partivamo presto e non avevamo la possibilità di fare colazione in hotel, ci hanno offerto un box take-away già pronto, che ho trovato abbastanza pessimo, poiché composto da un tramezzino confezionato difficile da buttar giù, una mela che non sembrava neanche lavata e un succo di frutta. Non ho termini di paragone in quanto sono stata solo una volta a Dublino, ma penso e spero che ci siano hotel migliori in città. ",3,2019,04,30
231,Bellissima scoperta,"Io e mio marito siamo stati in questo albergo dal 25 al 28 aprile e ci siamo trovati molto bene. Camera pulita e sempre in ordine.
Personale disponibile. Colazione varia e gustosa. 
Unico appunto è che al momento del check out, pur consegnando i due voucher, non ci è stata rimborsata la colazione (per due persone) che avevamo già pagato, ma di cui non avevamo potuto usufruire a causa di una gita con partenza nelle primissime ore del mattino.
Posizione centrale. Ottima struttura.
Consigliato!

231,Practico y bastante centrico,"Se trata de un hotel funcional, bastante practico. Muy bien ubicado y excelentemente comunicado por transporte publico (bus, luas, transporte aeropuerto, etc). Habitaciones correctas y limpias. Como siempre, el único handicap, la eterna moqueta de los hoteles británicos.",4,2019,04,24
231,Preis/Leistung ok,"Wir waren für ein verlängertes Wochenende in Dublin. Die zentrale Lage des Hotels hat uns überzeugt. Am ersten Tag erhielten wir ein barrierefreies Zimmer, welches leider ggü. der Eismaschine war. Leider sind die Zimmer sehr schlecht isoliert und die Matratze war von schlechter Qualität. Wir konnten unkompliziert das Zimmer am nächsten Tag wechseln. Das Zimmer war zum Teil modernisiert, einfach eingerichtet und grundsätzlich sauber, in Summe waren wir für das im Vergleich zu findende Hotelangebot im Preis/Leistungsverhältnis zufrieden. ",3,2019,04,23
231,Super!!,"Gemütlich, sauber, freundlich!
Auch eine tolle Bar gibt es dort. Betten sind auch hervorragend gut.

231,Jurado Inn Parnell Street,"Albergo ottimo sia per la pulizia che per la posizione ma, soprattutto per il personale gentilissimo. Una menzione particolare va ad una ragazza che si trova alla reception ovvero Catalina, simpatica , sempre col sorriso, disponibile e che, attraverso i suoi consigli , ci ha fatto passare una vacanza indimenticabile .",5,2019,04,15
231,Indimenticabile ,"Sono stato in questo hotel con la mia famiglia e devo dire che il soggiorno è stato fantastico..Siamo stati accolti da Catalina , una ragazza italiana alla reception che ci ha anche dato dei consigli preziosissimi su cosa visitare ..
La colazione era varia e abbondante 
La posizione dell'hotel perfetta per visitare Dublino 
Personale gentile e sempre disponibile 
Soggiorno perfetto grazie soprattutto a Catalina!!
Dublino è fantastica!!",5,2019,04,15
231,Bereits der zweite Aufenthalt,"Wir waren bereits nach unserem ersten Aufenthalt im Nov. 2018 so begeistert, dass wir sofort wieder gebucht haben. Die Zimmer sind sehr sauber, haben eine angenehme Größe und gute Ausstattung. Etwas hellhörig, wenn im Nachbarzimmer gestritten o.ä. wird😉. Die perfekte Lage um Dublin zu erkunden. Zuvorkommende und sehr hilfsbereite Mitarbeiter. Für Nicht-Fussballfans waren die Leinwand und Fernseher in der Bar etwas störend, da dadurch Platzmangel herrschte. So sind wir in einen Pub ausgewichen. Es war unter Garantie nicht unser letzter Besuch in diesem Hotel.",5,2019,04,08
231,Apuesta segura,"Muy buena ubicacion, cerca de todo lo que quieres ver y comer en Dublin ;)  Las habitaciones son grandes, limpias y comfortables y el personal es muy amable. Lo recomiendo para parejas, familias y viajes de negocios. No te faltara de nada.",4,2019,04,06
231,Pessimo rapporto qualita prezzo,"Vale la pena soggiornarvi solo per la posizione centralissima e i letti comodi e avvolgenti con cuscini superlativi. Per il resto lo sconsiglio !
Vi abbiamo soggiornato in tre famiglie con bambini. 
Il prezzo pagato non vale innanzitutto la pessima pulizia delle stanze e dei bagni.
Bagni vecchi e mal puliti, lavandino piccolissimo e c’e’ solo la vasca. Ma la vasca (vecchia) non ha il braccetto flessibile quindi non e’ possibile sciacquare i residui di sapone o altro. Appena arrivati la sera abbiamo trovato dei capelli nella vasca ed erano ancora li la sera dopo ... 
Al check in ci hanno subito chiesto un supplemento di ben 100€ (su una tripla pagata gia’ 400€) perche’ noi telefonicamente avevamo con onesta comunicato che un bambino aveva appena compiuto 12 anni. Tuttavia per quanto sono stati solerti nel chiedrci altri soldi, nessuno mai in quattro giorni ci ha mai chiesto un documento. MAI !  Viaggio sempre e non mi e’ mai capitato che non chiedessero i documenti! Praticamente in quelle camere poteva esserci chiunque !
Evidenziamo poi la scarsa disponibilita’ ed educazione del personale .
Colazione varia si ma tutto di pessima qualita’.
Insomma un buon motel che pero’ di fa pagare per un inrsistente quattro stelle.

",2,2019,04,06
231,La colazione varia e abbondante,"La colazione varia e abbondante. Letti grandi e comodi. Accogliente l'ambiente, su ogni piano,davanti l'ascensore, c'è un vassoio con delle mele per chi desidera uno snack salutare. Unico neo è il sistema idraulico del bagno: il rubinetto della vasca non miscela l'acqua. Il getto esce a metà bollente e a metà gelido, quindi, anche pericoloso. La doccia è fissa e non è facile lavarsi considerando la mancanza del bidè. Lo scarico della vasca non funziona e ti ritrovi con i piedi o nell'acqua bollente o in quella gelida .",5,2019,04,05
231,Posizione comoda e accessibile a tutti i servizi,L ‘ hotel si trova in una posizione molto comoda e centrale. Il personale è molto attento e disponibile alle esigenze degli ospiti.

231,TRES DIAS EN DUBLIN,"Una estancia muy agradable y muy tranquila. Empleados tanto de recepción y restaurante amables y diligentes.
Desayuno fantástico y abundante. 
Recomendamos este hotel por su buena relación calidad/precio. ",5,2019,03,27
231,Gutes Hotel,"Gutes Hotel in toller Lage. Sehr gutes Frühstück. Zimmer klein, aber mit sehr komfortablen Betten. Badezimmer leider schon etwas abgenutzt, aber sehr sauber. Durchaus empfehlenswert für einen Kurztrip.",4,2019,03,23
231,Ganz ok!,"Wir hatten ein 3 Bett-Zimmer über die Plattform Expedia gebucht. Check in funktionierte nach kurzer Wartezeit, reibungslos. Das Zimmer war ab 15 Uhr verfügbar, da wir aber schon um 13 Uhr im Hotel waren, durften wir unser Gepäck im Hotel lassen. Unser 3 Bett-Zimmer war ehrlich gesagt enttäuschend. Wir waren im 4 Stock untergebracht und unser Zimmer war so klein, dass man sich nicht umdrehen konnte bzw. überhaupt Platz für die Koffer hatte. Das eine Bett war ein etwas größeres Standard-Bett. Viel zu klein für 2 Personen. Ein Schlafen war fast nicht möglich, da ohnehin beide auf der Kante lagen, und beim umdrehen, einer definitv aus dem Bett purzelt. 
Das andere Bett, war nur eine Couch zum ausziehen.Die Sauberkeit war ganz ok, das Bad hatte auch schon bessere Zeiten. Ich weiß ja nicht was auf dem Klodeckel mal passiert ist,(ursprüngliche Farbe weiß) aber der war mit vergilbten Flecken übersäht, dass ich geschockt war, als ich den Deckel gesehen hatte. Nach eigens Reinigung, gingen die Flecken auch nicht weg. Ekliges Gefühl, den jedesmal ansehen zu müssen. Eine Klobürste gab es auch nicht, so wie fast kein Toilettenpapier. Wir mussten an unterschiedlichen Tagen, 2x Toilettenpapier an der Rezeption nachordern. Das wurde aber dann sofort gebracht. Ansonsten waren Toilettenartikel vorhanden, wie auch Badetücher, die auf Wunsch jeden Tag ausgewechselt wurden. Für den Preis den wir für 4 Nächte bezahlt haben, war das Hotel definitiv zu teuer. Wir hatten ohne Frühstück gebucht, da wir es abhängig machen wollten, anhand unserer Planung. Wir waren daher 2 x mal im Hotel Frühstücken. Das kostet übrigens 12,95€ pro Person. Sehr teuer, wenn man die Preise außerhalb vergleicht. Das Frühstücksbuffet war aber reichlich, es wurde immer aufgefüllt, und ließ soweit keine Wünsche offen. Schade war nur, dass es einen Automaten gab, der nur Kaffeebrühe rausließ. Bei dem Preis von 13€ dürfte es wenigstens ein Cappuccino etc... sein. Das hat leider nicht gepasst. Auch hatten wir einmal das Problem, dass alle unsere Zimmerkarten nicht mehr gingen. Leider auch noch dann, als meine Begleitung aufs Zimmer wollte, leider kein Wort Englisch sprach, und warten musste bis wir von unserem Ausflug wieder umkehrten um das Problem an der Rezeption auf Englisch regeln zu können. (Ich setze nicht voraus, dass an der Rezeption Deutsch oder sonst etwas gesprochen wird. Aber Karten die Funktionieren schon. Es gingen übrigens alle 3 Karten nicht mehr) Ansonsten war die Rezeption ganz freundlich. 
Zusammenfassend: Das Hotel ist ganz solide, hat 5 Stockwerke die man nur betreten kann, wenn man eine Zimmerkarte hat. Das Frühtück ist lecker, allerdings für 13€ zu teuer. Ansonsten liegt das Hotel zentral, wovon man alles schnell zufuss erreichen kann. Ich würde es aber nicht mehr Buchen, eben den oben genannten Kritikpunkten.",3,2019,03,20
231,Viel zu teuer,Das Hotel ist ein Mittelklassehotel. Die Zimmer sind ok und zeitlos eingerichtet. Das Bad ist etwas alt. Das Hotel ist viel zu teuer. Das Frühstück war nicht mit inbegriffen. Das war für den Preis für ca. 200 Euro die Nacht eine Zumutung!,2,2019,03,19
231,Excelente hotel,"Para pasar unos dias en Dublin es un excelente hotel. Se encuentra muy centrico, se puede ir andando a todos los sitios importantes. Buen desayuno, personal muy amable. Puedes dejar las maletas si lo necesitas.",5,2019,03,19
231,Toller Urlaub!,"Das beste an dem Hotel, dass es mitten im Zentrum war. 
Was mir auch aufgefallen ist, ein besonderer Geruch am Empfang und wenn man kurz vor dem Eingang auf der Straße war, hat man das Hotel bereits gerochen. Das hatte was besonderes. ",5,2019,03,16
231,Buena eleccion,Buena elección para pasar un fin de semana en dublin. Bastante céntrico y con un buen servicio. Las camas y almohadas especialmente cómodas. Excelente relación calidad-precio. Con dispensadores de agua y frutas frescas en los pasillos. Hotel muy recomendable,5,2019,03,09
231,Muy confortable y en una ubicación excelente,"El hotel se encuentra A pocos metros De la calle O Connell que es la principal del centro de Dublín, las habitaciones son amplias y cómodas, el desayuno es abundante y de muy buena calidad. El personal amable nos consiguió en minutos y eran las cuatro de la madrugada. Lo único a mejorar es que las habitaciones no cuentan con minibar ni caja de seguridad, lo del minibar es una pena ya que alrededor del hotel hay cantidad de supermercados pero si uno compra algo fresco no tiene dónde guardarlo. Por lo demás es un muy buen hotel y volvería a alojarme en él.",4,2019,03,05
231,Un un'ottima location,"L'hotel è situato in una ottima zona della città,a pochi passi sì arriva a Parnell street dove si può trovare di tutto.
Per arrivare nei punti di interesse di Dublino,ci si impiegano al massimo 15/20 minuti a piedi.
Proprio di fronte all'hotel c'è un supermarket aperto fino alle 22 (se non erro),fornito di tutto.
L'hotel è un 4* e le vale tutte, i ragazzi alla reception sono stati gentilissimi e ci hanno dato aiuto per qualsiasi esigenza ci occorresse.C'è la possibilità della colazione,a cifre che inizialmente potrebbero sembrare abbastanza alte,ma se volete fare una Irish breakfast,è la soluzione ideale,anche perché i prezzi in giro non sono più bassi.
Eravamo alloggiati al secondo piano,vicino alla sala da pranzo c'è una piccola stanza che loro definiscono Palestra,un tapis roulant e una panca piana,nulla di più.
Le camere sono molto confortevoli,letti fantastici e cuscini idem...abbiamo dormito divinamente.
Nel corridoio c'è una macchinetta distributrice di acqua e snack...ma se avete necessità,i prezzi del market di fronte,sono senz'altro più bassi.
Se avete un'auto chiedete in reception,hanno un'ottima convenzione con un parcheggio a pochissima distanza.
Intorno all'hotel dimenticatevi i parcheggi free.
Se dovessi tornare in città,senza dubbio sceglierei ancora una volta questo hotel.

231,3 giorni a Dublino,"Siamo stati a Dublino per il compleanno di mio marito, avendo come meta principale la Guinness storehouse (meravigliosa!!) Abbiamo trovato Dublino molto bella e gli irlandesi davvero gentili e ospitali, il soggiorno un hotel davvero confortevole.
Il Jurys Inn di Parnell Street é molto pulito, la camera ordinata è con una vista bellissima dalla finestra. Il letto comodissimo così come i cuscini, ci hanno permesso di riposare molto bene, dato che abbiamo deciso di girare solo a piedi e senza mezzi facendo quasi 60km in meno di 3 giorni pieni. Tornando all'hotel la colazione ottima! Classica dei paesi anglosassoni, con fagioli (terribili ma solo per noi italiani che non siamo abituati a mangiare con il ketchup, nulla che non siano patatine!) ottimo il bacon, la salsicce e vasta varietà di frutta e altri cibi, oltre che yogurt, the e caffè (non il nostro espresso). Abbiamo inoltre mangiato per la prima volta il pudding, e ci è piaciuto molto!! Ultima cosa, dobbiamo ringraziare una ragazza delle reception che si chiama Catalina, parla perfettamente italiano e ci ha aiutato a trovare i luoghi d'interesse della città, essendo anche il compleanno di mio marito il giorno del nostro arrivo, ci ha regalato due consumazioni a nostra scelta al bar dell'hotel! Una piacevole sorpresa. Insomma un ottimo voto va al Jurys Inn Dublin Parnell Street e così anche alla bella Dublino. Spero di tornarci prima o poi! ",5,2019,03,01
231,Laut & klein,"Wir haben eine Nacht hier verbracht nachdem wir die tollsten Hotels auf dem Land besucht hatten. Das Jurys inn glänzt am Eingang mit nettem Personal und auf der Webseite mit tollen Fotos, danach ist Schluss. Bett war als King Bed ausgeschrieben und 1.40cm breit, zwar hatte es noch ein Bettsofa im Raum war aber sehr verstaubt und versperrte mehr den Platz wie was anderes. Der Geräuschpegel im Haus ist sehr hoch und wir konnten den Gesprächen der Zimmernachbarn folgen. Für €140 die Nacht finden wir bestimmt das nächste Mal wo anders was besseres. ",1,2019,02,27

231,Cómodo y bien ubicado,"Habitación confortable. De esta cadena de hoteles hay que destacar que suelen estar muy bien situados en el centro, las vistas como siempre es una lotería en este caso me toco a la parte de atrás sin nada de interés.

También a 1 cuadra hay un centro comercial. Hay justo una parada de tranvia. Nosotros no lo usamos porque el centro de Dublin es relativamente chico y se puede hacer todo caminando. El bus del aeropuerto también tiene parada muy cerca del hotel. Las habitaciones son grandes y muy limpias. Tiene un bar en el utimo piso que esta abierto hasta tarde. En cada piso hay una máquina de hielo y una máquina a monedas para comprar golosinas y bebidas.",4,2019,02,18

La habitación limpia y tranquila con las comodidades para pasar unos días en Dublín. Lo único que se puede considerar un fallo es que pese a que los  huespedes dejan la habitación a las 12:00 pm, a las 15:00 todavia no estaba disponible. Nos fuimos a comer y a las 16:00 tampoco estaba disponible hasta que quedó libre o limpia una doble adaptada para minusvalidos (no fue lo correcto pero aceptamos. Lo importante era alojarnos cuanto antes para empezar a disfrutar y ver la ciudad).
Desde el hotel a TEMPLE BAR tardas unos siete u ocho minutos, al Trinity unos doce o quince.... Lo que te queda un poco más lejos es la cárcel o la guiness storege pero hay taxis y autobuses hasta allí. Por cierto, taxis hay a todas horas en todos los lugares y no son caros. 
En frente del hotel hay un restaurante para comer KINGFISHER que está muy bien, y al lado uno más bonito y bueno THE PARNELL HERITAGE BAR & GRILL.

231,Muy buena situación y atención a los clientes.,"Reservamos este hotel por las opiniones que habíamos leido en Trip Advisor y realmente acertamos plenamente. Los precios en Dublín no son baratos y este hotel ofrece una excelente relación calidad/precio, pese a lo que opine la gente en algunos foros.

En primer lugar, tiene una situación excelente, en una calle amplia y muy comercial. Está a menos de 500 metros del lugar desde donde salen todas las excursiones para toda Irlanda (Galway, Calzada del Gigante, Acantilados, etc,....). Y tiene allí mismo (en el Hotel Gresham) la parada del autobus que llega desde el aeropuerto de Dublin que, por cierto, se llama Aircoach y nos dejó rápidamente y por 12€ la ida y vuelta (desde enfrente de ese mismo hotel de la avenida principal).

Está perfectamente ubicado para ir a pié en 15 minutos a la zona del Temple, del Trinity College y a las calles principales. Incluso si vais a la estaciones de tren principales tampoco están muy distantes. La ubicación es de diez.

Luego tiene la ventaja de disponer de un supermercado Tesco, justo enfrente, y otro Lidl a la vuelta de la esquina, para disponer de cualquier cosa que necesitéis. Además y para rematar la faena, tiene un pequeño restaurante al otro lado de la calle donde se come muy bien (Kingfisher, creo recordar que se llamaba).

En cuanto a lo que es el hotel, llegamos muy pronto y dejamos las maletas sin ningún problema para hacer la primera visita turística, realizando el ""checking"" por la noche cuando volvimos.

La habitación muy amplia y cómoda. El baño también amplio y muy limpio, con bañera y curiosamente con más jabón (con dispensadores de pared) que en la habitación superior que cogimos, porque ampliamos un día más. Además, nos tocó una habitación en el piso 2, donde está el desayuno, lo que se agradecía, ya que saliamos para las excursiones muy pronto (6,30/7 horas). Dicho desayuno estaba bastante completo, con platos calientes, zumos, yogures, etc,.... Solo echabamos en falta algo más de bollería, pero para mí era todo suficiente y bien servido. El café, por cierto, muy bueno.

La atención del personal de recepción fue muy buena y también la del manager, pues nos resolvieron varias dudas y algunas incidencias que surgieron. En algunas ocasiones hay personal de habla hispana, lo que favorece la comunicación de manera evidente y más cuando no dominas el idioma.

Para ser agosto y pagando algo más de 200€ por noche (eso sí, reservándolo con bastante anticipación), me ha parecido una excelente elección.",5,2018,09,05
231,Hotel In ottima posizione e silenzioso,Abbiamo trascorso quattro giorni a Dublino soggiornando in questo hotel. Abbiamo preso la camera con un offerta su Amoma con colazione compresa. L'hotel è molto bello e l'insonorizzazione e perfetta. Abbiamo dormito molto bene e Anche la colazione è molto curata con una scelta molto vasta sia dolce che salato. Molto soddisfatti,4,2018,08,29
231,"Otro Juris Inn, otra decepción","Lo de estos hoteles no tiene nombre.  Las habitaciones son penosas (en este caso, ventanas que no cierran, la bañera ... cruje al pisarla !!!), y como constante, cuando algo se acaba en el buffet del desayuno, se lo dices, y no lo reponen.  Los low costa de los hoteles.",1,2018,08,21
231,Lo mejor la situación,"Un hotel muy bien situado, ya que puedes ir andando a prácticamente cualquier logar céntrico desde aquí. Edificio relativamente moderno, amplio vestibulo y 3 ascensores relativamente rápidos.
Largos pasillos con moqueta en las plantas y habitaciones de tamaño medio sin más (eramos 2 adultos + 2 niños). La nuestra (4 piso) daba hacia Moore St por lo que podíamos ver el mercado cada mañana.
Hay secador de pelo, plancha y una tv muy cutre con unos 8 canales, ninguno internacional, lo cual no se explica en el año 2018 y en un hotel lleno de turistas extranjeros.
Lo peor el baño: bañera con cortina, diseño anticuado, tapa del váter solo anclado por un gancho, un único rollo de papel higiénico, nada de amenities, solo 3 dispensadores de jabón debidamente anclados a pared.
Camas bien, almohadas bien, insonorización bien.
El desayuno (segunda planta) es en una sala amplia y bastante bien iluminada: surtido más que suficiente para no aburrirte.
El pub, en la misma planta, es agradable y acogedor. Precios prácticamente iguales que cualquier pub de la ciudad, lo cual es de agradecer.
Hotel correcto y muy bien situado: restaurante Kingfisher justo delante (de lo mejor de la ciudad), supermercado Tesco justo a la izquierda y al lado una gigantesca librería (parada obligatoria para los amantes de los libros.)",4,2018,08,18
231,Schade eigentlich...,"Sehr gut gelegen, Frühstück klasse, aber: extrem hellhörig (Gruß an den ständig pfeifenden und grölenden Zimmernachbar aus 555 🙄), Zustellbett war durchgelegen. Ausstattung ok, Personal top u. freundlich",3,2018,08,16
231,"Hotel normal de ciudad, no sé si llega a las 3 estrellas.","Se trata de un hotel normal de ciudad.En la habitación falta nevera y caja fuerte.
Estuvimos en una habitación familiar, la 219,  a 220 euros la noche, pequeña. La televisión sin canales internacionales. Las camas incómodas.
Está céntrico, en un radio de 15-20 minutos andando está todo lo que hay que ver en Dublín y puedes coger los tranvías que recorren la ciudad, así como diferentes autobuses que te llevan por toda la ciudad. El servicio del comedor muy bueno y el derecepción bien. El desayuno un 6,5 sobre diez. Alguna opción sin gluten.",2,2018,08,16
231,Gran Hotel,"Se trata de un hotel muy céntrico, situado muy cerca de las principales atracciones de Dublín. Está muy bien equipado, y el personal es muy amable y atento. Las habitaciones son espaciosas y muy confortables. Además, el desayuno buffet está bastante bien. Si necesitas algo específico se lo puedes pedir al personal sin ningún problema. Junto al restaurante hay un patio abierto en el que puedes echar un ""cigarrito"" si fumas.",5,2018,08,15
231,Buena ubicación ,"Reservé una habitación doble superior con dos camas , tenía una cama doble y una individual, eso hace que no quede mucho espacio libre. Los colchones son magníficos, podrás descansar estupendamente. La habitación no dispone ni de caja fuerte ni mini bar. Hay un hervidor, café soluble, diferentes infusiones, galletas y 2 botellas de agua que cada día reponen. La televisión un poco vieja. Hay para planchar y secador de pelo. El baño, en mi caso, con bañera y esta con cortina. No dispone de amenities, solo 2 dosificadores de jabón y 1 de champú con acondicionador por lo que recomiendo llevar todo lo que necesites para tu aseo personal. Tanto la habitación como el baño están muy limpios. Algo muy importante llevar un adaptador de enchufes para poder cargar tus dispositivos móviles, si lo olvidas en la recepción hay unas máquinas de aguas, refrescos, etc que los venden por 4€. También puedes cargarlos en el enchufe de la máquina de afeitar que está en el lavabo y aunque mucho más lento en la entrada usb que hay en el televisor. 
El desayuno está bien, no hay mucha variedad y yo diría que todos los días hay lo mismo, aun así está todo muy bueno. 
El hotel está muy céntrico, puedes ir caminando a prácticamente todos los lugares. Delante del hotel hay un supermercado que cierra muy tarde, por si necesitas cualquier cosa. 
Hay una parada de bus muy cercana que te lleva al aeropuerto y solo hay dos paradas hasta este, el recorrido hasta el aeropuerto es de unos 20 minutos, lo recomiendo porque es cómodo, práctico y barato, ida y vuelta 11€ , puedes comprarlo los billetes por internet o bien en la misma parada del bus en el aeropuerto. En general el hotel está bien, aunque en mi opinión no se corresponde la calidad con precio, es un poco caro para lo que ofrece. ",4,2018,08,14
231,Enormemente caro para lo que dan.,"SITUACIÓN: Buena. En el centro, pero a 15 minutos del centro turístico. Muy cerca de la parada de autobús del aeropuerto.
EDIFICIO: De una 6 o 7 alturas. Funcional y un tanto anodino, como los demás que he visto de la marca.
LOBBY E INSTALACIONES COMUNES: Amplio, funcional y un tanto anodino. 
Colores grisáceos, o topo, un tanto oscuro y triste. Moquetas limpias pero sosas. Incluso parecen viejas por su diseño y colorido. 
PERSONAL: En el ingreso nos recibió una señorita con una sonrisa fría que parecía que nos hiciera un favor al atendernos. Costaba trabajo oírla y no hacia el menor esfuerzo por hacerse entender. Sonrisa de pose, no de agrado por el servicio. Yo creo que no le han explicado quién paga y quien cobra. O que no le gusta su trabajo. Mala profesional. Muy mal.
El personal de servicio en el desayuno es más amable, voluntarioso y eficaz. 
HABITACIÓN 215: De tamaño suficiente, la decoración es funcional y bastante anodina. 
Las camas malas: llenas de bultos.
Las almohadas regulares. 
La insonorización bien.
La tv pequeña y sin canales internacionales: ¿Ha valorado esta cadena qué porcentaje de extranjeros y sus nacionalidades son sus clientes?. ¿Les da igual?.
Wifi: funciona bien.
Baño: Pequeño, simple y feo. Jabones de hipermercado en dispensador. 
DESAYUNO: Lo alimentos habituales. Poca variedad de zumos (3). Poca variedad de repostería (mininapolitanas y minicroasanes). 
Pocas mesas (nos ha costado encontrar mesa para tres). Regular.

CONCLUSIÓN. Hotel con un precio inadmisible para su mediocre calidad: La habitación que estaría bien para un tres estrellas de 80€. Inadmisible para uno de 275€/noche (822 por 3 noches). Una desfachatez.

Buena situación pero no excelente. ",2,2018,08,14

La cafetería estupenda y se come muy bien con platos abundantes y a buen precio! ,3,2018,07,21
231,Buena ubicación,"El hotel tiene una buena ubicación para conocer Dublin, en una calle muy comercial perpendicular a O'connell street. En las calles principales hay buen ambiente, pero en cuanto te metes en una secundaria el ambiente es peor. Muy cerca del servicio de autobuses para el aeropuerto. A pocos metros tienes varios supermercados con amplio horario de apertura.
La habitación es amplia y acogedora, la cama es comoda. El baño completo y limpio, aunque le faltan pequeños detalles.
El desayuno bufet es abubdante y variado, tienes opciones saladas (para el irish breakfast), dulces y fruta. Aunque todos los dias tienen lo mismo.
El personal es muy amable y encantador, todo el mundo estuvo pendiente de que nuestra estancia fuese lo más agradable posible. 
En relación a la oferta hotelera y de apartamentos de Dublin es una buena opción este hotel, aunque el precio me parece excesivo.",4,2018,07,02

231,Una buena opción,"Hemos estado 4 noches en este hotel y todo ha resultado muy agradable.  En recepción son amables y cuando lo hemos necesitado siempre algún empleado hablaba algo de español. Las habitaciones son amplias, el desayuno muy correcto y lo mejor la ubicación, ya que en 10' de paseo se llega al Trinity. También está muy cerca del punto de partida de excursiones y free tours, lo que resulta muy cómodo. Para la noche, si se quiere cenar cerca del hotel hay varios pubs en la calle O Connell que tienen mucho ambiente y música en directo. Buena relación calidad precio.

Le camere sono pulitissime e lo staff molto cordiale, noi pernottavamo al quinto piano ed avevamo un letto a due piazze più un letto ad una piazza per la piccola.
La colazione è servita al secondo piano ed è continentale.
Wi fi free in tutto l’hotel ",4,2018,05,22
231,"Buon Hotel, anche per famiglie con bambini","Abbiamo scelto questo Hotel per la vicinanza con la zona del centro e anche per il prezzo, relativamente più basso rispetto a quelli nella stessa zona. 
Il rapporto qualità/prezzo, infatti, è molto buono; unica pecca la dimensione della stanza, almeno la nostra..., che per due adulti e due bambini era effettivamente un pò sacrificata. 
Tutto sommato, ci siamo trovati molto bene. 
Importante è da sottolineare che nei dintorni dell'albergo ci sono un sacco di posti in cui mangiare, dalla colazione, alla cena, tutti più o meno buoni.",4,2018,05,17
231,Irland Reise ,"Schlimmstes Hotel unserer Reise. Ich verstehe die guten Bewertungen nicht!! Die Dame am Empfang ruppig und unfreundlich, anders als das was man von Iren gewohnt ist. Die Zimmer: Toilette hat geklopft/getropft (die ganze Nacht), Klimaanlage ging nicht, Fernseher hat auch nur sporadisch getan. Klasse ist auch die Parkplatz Situation. Wir mussten nach Anfrage fast nen Kilometer laufen um das Parkhaus zu erreichen das uns dann 24 Stunden noch 10€ extra gekostet hat. Die Dame an der Rezeption kritzelte uns wage auf einer Karte den Weg auf, ohne den genauen Namen des Parkhauses zu nennen. Erst ein anderer Angestellter teilte uns den mit. Die Lage ist ok, zentral mit Blick auf den Hinterhof. Ich bin sicher nicht pingelig, aber es gibt besseres für den Preis!!!",2,2018,05,12
231,Estupendo,"Habitaciones estupendas. Muy grandes y cómodas.  Excelente ubicación en Dublín, casi en O'connell street. Muy cerca de Temple Bar y de las zonas comerciales. El desayuno, genial y muy variado y el personal muy amable.
Justo enfrente hay un pub,  en el que se come divinamente, llamado Kingfisher.
Sin duda repetiré si vuelvo a Dublín!",4,2018,04,30
231,Horror,"Nach zahlreichen Aufenthalten in Dublin war das Jury‘s Inn Dublin bei weitem das schlechteste Hotel. Klar ist, wer in Dublin eine saubere und komfortabele Unterkunft für wenig Geld sucht, der wird es schwer haben. Im Jury‘s Inn stimmte einfach gar nichts und das zu total hirnverbrannten Preisen. Schon beim. Check-In stieg mein Puls auf 180 weil die Frau am Desk überhaupt keine Ahnung hatte und sich die Aufnahmeprozedur über fast 20 Minuten hinzog.
Die Zimmer wären höchstens für ein zweitklassiges Hostel ansprechend. Mobilar etwas in die Jahre gekommen. Unsere Tür zum Badezimmer ließ sich auf einmal von innen nicht mehr öffnen weil die   Türklinke defekt war. Risse im Waschbecken. Matratzen total abgelutscht, Kissen wie aus Beton und Zimmer so hellhörig dass man den Nachbar 5 Zimmer weiter schnarchen hört. 
Liftbetrieb ist eine Katastrophe. Aus Sicherheitsgründen muss man für jeden Blödsinn die Schlüsselkarte einstecken. Alles schön und gut, würde das System funktionnieren. Tut es aber nicht... Dh also Treppenlaufen. 

Zum Personal gibt es wenig zu sagen. 3 mal in Kontakt, 3 mal unfreundlich und nicht unbedingt gastfreundlich. 

Einziger Plus-Punkt ist die Lage. Stadtzentrum ist praktisch und schnell nach einem 5-10 minütigen Walk zu erreichen. Vorteil gegenüber Stadtteilen wie Templebar ist dass weniger nächtliches Treiben herrscht.

Fazit: Nie wieder Jury‘s Inn Parnell Street!

Respecto al desayuno incluido en el precio, correcto aunque un poco escaso de variedad de salados. Eso si, había huevos, bacon y patatas.

Cenamos un par de noches en el hotel y a pesar de la buena calidad de La comida y de que no habían demasiados comensales, el servicio fue realmente muy lento. La atención de los camareros por contra, fue muy atenta y amable.

La recepción y la atención en el check in y check out, sinceramente fue bastante fría y poco amable. Hablamos un poco de inglés pero no se esforzaban demasiado en que les entendieras, más bien al contrario.

A pesar de todo, recomendable.",4,2018,03,29

Se non avete comprato colazione compresa vi conviene pagare anticipatamente alla reception perchè pagare direttamente in sala costa di più. Il personale è molto cortese ed attento, la struttura funziona bene e la colazione è valida ( meno per quanto riguarda i dolci ma comunque più che sufficiente). Non diamo il massimo del punteggio per la poca insonorizzazione delle camere. Un anziano nella stanza vicino tossiva tutte le notti ed era come averlo con noi. Per il resto tutto ok.",4,2018,03,12

231,Top Hotel in einer Top Stadt,"Wir waren hier während unseres Städtetrips einquatiert und sind einfach nur restlos begeistert.

Das fängt schon einmal von der Top Lage am Parnell Square an. Innerhalb weniger Minuten hat man den Fluss überquert und ist mitten im Temple Viertel aber immmer noch ein wenig außerhalb des ganzen Trubels.

Dazu ist der Bus vom Flughafen aus nur ein paar Gehminuten entfernt in der O`Connell Street.

Das Hotel selbst ist ebenfalls sehr modern ausgestattet und glänzt mit einem sehr hilfsbereiten und freundlichen Personal. 

Die Zimmer sind sehr sauber und für britische, irische Verhältnisse sehr groß.

Wir hatten direkt im zweiten Stock unser Zimmer nahe der Bar und des Fitnessraumes den wir leider nicht genutzt haben aber auch hier alles sehr sauber und wirklich gut instand.

Extra erwähenswert ist auch das die Zimmer alles bieten von einem Föhn bis hin zu einem Kaffekocher dazu ist es auch ein sehr baby-kinderfreundliches Hotel.

Waren restlos begeistert vom Hotel und von der Stadt selbst. Würden jederzeit wieder hier herkommen.

Frühstück, Mittagessen und Abendessen wird ebenfalls angeboten auch wenn wir (leider) nichts konsumiert haben haben wir gesehen das hier ebenfalls authentisches Irish Breakfast serviert wird was sehr gut sein soll sowie kann  man zu guten nicht überzogenen Preisen sich Essen direkt ins Zimmer bestellen.",5,2018,02,14

Nonostante sia considerato un hotel fuori mano VI assicuro che è il contrario. Uscendo dalla Hall girando a destra e seguendo il marciapiede vi troverete in una piazza e continuando sempre a destra vi troverete sulla via principale O’Connel Street che se seguirete attentamente vi porterà ai ponti più famosi e da lì al centro di tutto ciò che ha Dublino interessa visitare.

Las camas super comodas,de esas que te metes y parece q te absorven de lo bien que se esta!!
El desayuno muy variado aunque para mi gusto le faltava algo de dulce
Tenian leche de soja y productos y pan sin gluten eso para mi gusto tiene mucho a su favor ya que las personas que no lo toleramos a veces no nos tienen en cuenta
Esta muy cerquita tambien de un hotel donde salen la mayoria de excursiones y es de agradecer cuando hay q madrugar para irte de excursion

Las habitaciones son amplias, al menos para una familia de cuatro como es nuestro caso. La limpieza es adecuada. No tienen cunas aparentemente. La habitación que nos dieron era para minusválidos, por lo que el baño era adaptado... Complicado bañar un bebé en la ducha, que por cierto, su agua caliente nos pareció excesivamente caliente.
El desayuno está bien, aunque echamos en falta más productos frescos y zumos naturales. Tienen opciones sin gluten y en cocina preparan platos específicos para celíacos (es buffet y es fácil que haya contaminaciones cruzadas) . Se puede comer/ cenar aceptablemente.
El trato es correcto, aunque cuando llegamos dos clientes españoles, que estaban delante nuestro  tuvieron problemas con sus reservas.

231,7 giorni in Irlanda con la famiglia,"Albergo grande, elegante. 3 stelle ma potrebbe tranquillamente considerarsi a 4 stelle.camera familiare ( eravamo in 4) con letto matrimoniale forse un po' piccolo.pulizia ottima.posizione strategica, tutto a portata senza usare mezzo pubblici.consiglio Di includere la colazione. Esagerata!!",4,2017,11,04
231,Städtetour zentrale Lage in die Stadt und zu allen Anbindungen,"Sehr höfliches Personal, an die man sich jeder Zeit wenden konnte. Rasche Abwicklung der Formalitäten. Saubere Zimmer und ein großes Frühstücksbuffet, dass immer frisch nachgefüllt wurde. Wasserkocher, Tee und Kaffee auf dem Zimmer. Man konnte leider die Geräusche der Straße bei geschlossenem Fenster gut hören.",4,2017,11,04
231,lo consiglio !,"abbiamo soggiornato per 4 notti in coppia ad ottobre del 2017 pagando circa € 180,00 a notte con colazione con week end di mezzo. specifico che abbiamo prenotato molto sotto data (circa 10giorni prima)
La stanza è abbastanza ampia, il letto molto comodo il bagno è funzionale. 
pulizia ottima, meriterebbe sicuramente la 4 stella per gli standard irlandesi. unica pecca mancanza della cassaforte.
La posizione è furba perché pur mantenendo la vicinanza a tutti i maggiori punti d'interesse raggiungibili a piedi, conserva una tranquillità notturna da schiamazzi musica grida che a dublino non è da sottovalutare. in più è molto vicina sia ad o'connell per i bus aereoporto che alla fermata jervis per metropolitana leggera. oltre ad una delle più importanti vie dello shopping della città:henry street.
la colazione che è stata sempre uguale è ovviamente molto piu salata che dolce. 
il personale gentile sorridente e disponibile. essendo abbastanza grande credo possa offrire anche ottimi prezzi per dublino, lo consiglierei. ",4,2017,11,01
231,Gran hotel compuesto de gran personal,"Fantásticamente situado y muy confortable. Las camas comodísimas y las instalaciones estupendas. Su personal es amable y cercano y en casi todos los turnos hay alguien que habla el castellano. Gracias en especial a Ana, española y trabajdora del hotel, que nos brindó un trato y ayuda excelente en una situación que tuvimos muy comprometida. Muchas gracias.",5,2017,10,23
231,Perfecta ubicación. Perfecto desayuno. Perfecto alojamiento.,"El desayuno era buffet libre (10€ si lo pagabas con antelación y 11€ si lo pagabas justo al entrar al desayuno). Desayunar fuera del hotel es bastante más caro.
La ubicación está perfecta. Hay un Dealz a 1 minuto, paradas de buses a 5 minutos a pie. A 15 minutos andando de Temple Bar. Está en el centro.
Recomiendo este hotel ya vengas solo o en familia.",5,2017,10,17
231,hotel centrico tipo boutique con conserje 24hrs,"Centrico hotel, bueno mas que nada por su ubicacion. El room service no funciona toda la noche como dicen. Solo pizza  y bebidas sin alcohol. El frigobar vacio. El personal que nos recibio a medianoche muy poco eficiente  y parco. La habitacion amplia y limpia, la cama muy comoda, el baño tambien. Se usa la llave electronica de la hab para usar el ascensor por seguridad. El personal de coserjeria no esta atento a las entradas y salidas de la gente,  el hotel cumplio la funcion de estar centricamente ubicado, cerca de todo a pie y para dos o tres noches esta muy bien. Desayuno regular a malo: no andan las cafeteras , el personal muy atento pero no resuelve. No reponen los alimentos sinó despues que toda la gente reclama.",3,2017,10,03
231,Buen y amable servicio,"Hotel agradable. Servicio muy amable, desde la recepción al comedor. Recomendable. 
El personal de limpieza también muy amable aunque me pasó algo que no me ha ocurrido nunca. 9:30 de la mañana un caballero llama a la puerta, yo me estoy aseando y aún así entra a limpiar. 
Por lo demás el hotel está limpio, cálido y correcto. 
La comida rica. El desayuno muy Ingles. Echo en falta la fruta que espero encontrar en el desayuno de un hotel de 4 estrellas.

231,Top Lage für einen Wochenendtrip nach Dublin,"Wir waren im September / Oktober für 4 Tage als Familie in Dublin und haben uns für das Jurys Inn Parnell Street aufgrund der zentralen und verkehrsgünstigen Lage entschieden. Das Hotel liegt wirklich sehr gut in direkter Nähe zur O`Connell Street und somit an der Hauptader in Dublin. Von hier aus kann man so gut wie alle Sehenswürdigkeiten fußläufig erreichen. 
Die Zimmer sind funktional, gut und sauber - der Service sehr freundlich und das Frühstück war landestypisch - aber nach unserem Geschmack auch gut. Wir würden hier wieder buchen wenn wir mal wieder nach Dublin kommen. ",4,2017,10,02
231,MUY BUENO Y CONFORTABLE,"Se encuentra muy bien ubicado, a metros de la calle principal de Dublin. El personal de recepción es de excelencia.
La habitaciones luminosas, amplias, buen baño y todo muy limpio. Posee un amplio y cómodo salón de estar.

Es un hotel para destacar y sobre todo por la relación precio calidad.",4,2017,09,24
231,Ottimo Hotel,"Tutta la struttura nel suo complesso è ottima, lo staff (gentile, sempre disponibile) e la ristorazione. L'hotel è ubicato in una posizione strategica poichè molto prossimo alla stazione dei bus e ad un passo dal centro di Dublino.",4,2017,09,12
231,Sencillo pero cómodo y bien situado,"El mobiliario de las habitaciones y del baño es un poco simple, pero más que suficiente.
Las habitaciones son bastante amplias. Las habitaciones cuádruples consisten en una cama de matrimonio y un sofá cama (al menos las que conocimos nosotros),   aún en este caso el espacio que queda es correcto.
Las camas son muy cómodas, aunque el sofá cama no tanto (es más indicado para niños que tienen menor peso).
Desayuno muy completo. La atención del personal y la limpieza muy buena.
Situación: Está situado en una zona comercial que por la noches está muy vacío y un poco desolado, pero no hay peligro. Por el día hay muchos comercios, supermercados y un mercadillo callejero de fruta a muy buen precio. Hay cerca una parada del autobús que enlaza con el aeropuerto y está a un pequeño paseo del centro turísitico y lugares de interés.
Recomiendo este hotel en general y en especial para familias con niños, por las habitaciones y por la situación.",4,2017,09,07
231,Soggiorno piacevole ,"Un albergo di buon livello. Tra le cose positive metterei sicuramente la posizione ( centro raggiungibile a piedi), la colazione buona e varia, e la gentilezza del personale.

231,Homeless in ascensore !!!??.....,"Appassionati dell' Irlanda e di Dublino, abbiamo scelto lo Juris Inn per la quarta volta. Ore 19.40. Scendendo dal terzo piano, l'ascensore si ferma al secondo ed  entra, con lo stupore di tutti, tra cui mia moglie e mia figlia, un giovane,sporco, homeless con la cerniera dei pantaloni aperta, il ......in mostra e una puzza di urina insopportabile.Scende alla hall e esce dall'albergo sotto il naso della security. Come ha fatto ad entrare ? Come e'arrivato al secondo piano? Cosa ha fatto all'interno dell' albergo ? Immediatamente mi rivolgo alla reception per riferire dell'accaduto ma, siccome nessuno parla in italiano, chiedo di parlare col direttore. Appuntamento il mattino dopo. Mi concede il suo tempo una giovane manager, che, in piedi nella hall , mi ascolta gentilmente nel mio inglese incerto, ma non parla una parola in italiano.Da parte mia non ho ben compreso le sue risposte perche' ho difficolta' nel listering. In parole povere l'albergo, con migliaia di clienti italiani all'anno, non ha nessuno, direttore compreso, che parli una ,una che una !!!, parola in italiano. Quindi quest'anno ho pagato, non poco, per far assistere mia moglie e mia figlia, dentro, inside , l'albergo ad un piccolo spettacolo osceno.E per non capire quanto i responsabili abbiano ben compreso la gravita' dell'accaduto. Peccato, perche' ,per il resto, posso esprimere un giudizio positivo sulla cortesia del personale,sulla colazione, sulla pulizia delle camere, ecc., oggettivamente  migliorate rispetto al passato. ",1,2017,08,16
231,Gran opcion en Dublin.,"Buen hotel situado en la parte norte de la Ciudad, pegado a la calle cormercial y muy cerca de Temple Bar.

231,Cómoda ubicación ,"Hotel confortable con una ubicación muy práctica a unos metros de la parada del Aircoach de O'Connell Street.

Nuovo, elegante, ben posizionato rispetto al centro di Dublino, propone camere ampie, bagni con miscelatori di acqua calda/fredda( particolare non da poco nel nostro tour che ha proposto sempre strutture con bagni vecchiotti e lavabo a due rubinetti separati), colazione variata dolce/salata, frutta fresca e molto altro.
Buona scelta per un soggiorno a Dublino per l'ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo.",4,2017,08,11
231,Muy buena opción,"Hotel muy bien ubicado, centrico en zona con comercios. Tranquilo.. Una muy buena opción para visitar Dublin. Habitaciones amplias, muy comodas. Buen bufet de almuerzo. Personal muy atento y agradable.",5,2017,08,07
231,Hotel da 5 stelle,"Ottimo hotel in centro a Dublino, camere spaziose, luminose, confortevoli, moderne e pulite. Wi-Fi gratuito ovunque. Ricca colazione a buffet. Consigliatissimo.
Merita il massimo del punteggio perchè alla rèception è presente personale gentile e disponibile oltre misura. Non finiremo mai di ringraziare Alex, uno dei ragazzi alla rèception che, come un buon padre di famiglia, ha preso a cuore e ci ha aiutati a risolvere un grosso problema con l'auto presa a noleggio e alla fine ci ha anche coccolati offrendoci da bere. Grazie davvero.",5,2017,07,30
231,Buon Hotel,"Consiglio senza dubbio questo hotel. Ottima la pulizia e la cortesia del personale, stanza ok e letto comodo.

231,Gran hotel en Dublin,"Pasé una sola noche en este hotel, pero fue una grata experiencia. La habitación era muy amplia y cómoda, y el bar muy lindo y con un muy buen servicio. La ubicación es muy buena, en la parte norte de la ciudad.",5,2017,07,16
231,"Posizione centrale, ma in zona troppo trafficata","Ci siamo arrivati in auto, posizione centrale, ma con traffico elevato. Davanti, forse anche a causa di lavori in corso su tutta la via, neppure la possibilità di sostare per scaricare il bagaglio: ci sono tre posti auto, ma sono perennemente occupati e l'hotel è praticamente in un incrocio con semaforo. Non fare l'errore di parcheggiare sul retro nel parking retrostante: mal tenuto, strettissimo, più caro degli altri e su strada stretta a due sensi.  Il giorno che siamo partiti nella strada laterale c'era pure il mercato e per uscire, sia noi sia chi veniva in senso opposto, abbiamo sudato sette camicie...  Camera in compenso pulita, anche se con un arredamento molto maschile, vista su un triste cortile interno. Moquette dappertutto di cui si farebbe a meno. Colazione discreta. 
Nota negativa: entrando nella hall per tutti i due gg che siamo stati a Dublino si avvertiva un forte profumo ma di qualità scadente che dava una cattiva impressione iniziale.",3,2017,07,12
231,Okay...........,"wir hatten ein behindertengerechtes Zimmer...naja.....

Sehr laut da sich wohl eine Mülldeponie nebenan befindet und die Fahrzeuge entleert wurden....nur mit geschlossenem Schallschutzfenster zu ertragen.

Frühstück kann für 10 Euro gebucht werden...okay aber nicht mehr....

Gefallen hat mir die Hotelbar mit recht moderaten Preisen",3,2017,07,05
231,Hotel comodo e confortevole,"L'albergo è comodo perché è vicino al Centro di Dublino. L'abbiamo raggiunto dall'Aeroporto con un autobus che passa ogni 15 minuti. L'aspetto esteriore delle stanze, della hall e della sala colazioni è piacevole.  Il servizio è buono.",5,2017,06,29
231,Tour Irlanda,"Buon Hotel sotto tutti gli aspetti, sito in posizione abbastanza centrale e comunque collegato bene con i mezzi. Colazione discreta, struttura e pulizia camere buona. È consigliabile per visitare la città.

231,cortesia e pulizia,"Ottimo per la sua posizione centrale, camera ampia e luminosa, pulitissimo, personale alla reception cortese e disponibile. Colazioni varie ed abbondanti, con vasta scelta di prodotti. Ottimo il servizio bar, mentre ritengo un po' scarno il menù per la cena. Nel complesso comunque lo definisco un gran buon hotel. Aggiungo che è molto silenzioso, e che potrete usufruire anche della palestra.",5,2017,06,28
231,"CAMAS, COLCHONES Y ALMOHADAS","Buen hotel, habitaciones suficientemente grandes, cuarto de baño aceptable, lo mejor, las camas y las almohadas, buena limpieza en general y personal, todos, sin excepciones, muy amables, simpáticos y atentos, desayunos como en casi todos los que conocemos, no nos influye mucho ya que somos solo de café y tostadas pero tienen un poco de todo, cenamos alguna noche y perfecto, todo bueno y bien presentado, no gran variedad pero bien para una cena de ultima hora.

Muy importante, la zona esta en obras y temiamos el ruido, todo lo contrario, nos dieron las dos habitaciones en pisos 3 y 4 y tanto la nuestra como la de nuestro hijo, que nos acompaño, sin un ruido en todos los sentidos, perfecto para dormir, en todo caso las pensabamos pedir interiores por lo que habíamos leido en otros comentarios.

En resumen, repetiríamos sin dudarlo, en todo caso recordar que es nuestra experiencia del 27/05 al 02/06 de este año.",4,2017,06,24
231,Buon hotel in posizione centrale,"Buona struttura cittadina situata in posizione centrale e comoda per visitare la città. Camere abbastanza spaziose, buona organizzazione e pulizia soddisfacente delle camere . Prezzi un po' alti, ma giustificati data la posizione.",4,2017,06,19
231,Hotel con excelente ubicación y muy buenas instalaciones ,"El hotel es bastante grande, sus habitaciones son amplias. Buen baño, colchón, almohadas y sabanas. Ducha con excelente presión. La recepción es muy amplia, varios ascensores. Enfrente hay un supermercado Tesco y un lugar bien servido para comer. A la vuelta ya queda la calle principal que tiene mucho movimiento. A 3 minutos del río y 5 de Temple Bar. Rápidos para Check in y out. Lo recomiendo ",5,2017,06,16
231,Für Kurztrip ok...,"Wir waren 3 Nächte im Jurys in einem Superior-Zimmer....das Zimmer war zum Innenhof und recht eng. Das Bad recht abgenutzt und schmutzig, die Ecken wurden nicht wirklich geputzt. Außerdem roch es sehr muffig im Zimmer. Lüften war nur mit gekippten Fenster möglich, das Fenster lies sich nicht ganz öffnen. Service und Personal vollkommen in Ordnung, Essen in der Bar sehr lecker und preislich ok. Frühstück war gut. Lage des Hotels ideal. Dennoch würde ich nicht wieder hin fahren, da nicht ausreichend geputzt wurde.",3,2017,06,07
231,Un bel we a Dublino con i nipoti,"Ho prenotato questo hotel per due notti da trascorrere con i miei 10 nipoti. Avevamo 4 camere, tutte pulite e ordinate. Ottima e abbondante la colazione, alla reception abbiamo trovato persone molto gentili. Un ragazzo, Sandro, mi ha aiutato a stampare le carte di imbarco perio volo di rientro, dedicandomi tempo con pazienza e cortesia. La posizione è' buona, dalla parte opposta della Liffey rispetto a Trinity College, raggiungibile comunque velocemente a piedi. Una sera, stanchissimi, abbiamo deciso di cenare in hotel, e anche lì abbiamo trovato qualità e gentilezza. Unica pecca: lo scarico del lavandino del bagno che non funzionava bene ",4,2017,06,06
231,Empfehlenswert,"Das Hotel hält was es verspricht - Service, Zimmer und Personal sind absolut ok - das einzige was uns störte war, dass der Frühstücksservice morgens bei Massenansturm recht chaotisch und unorganisiert agierte! ",3,2017,06,05
231,week and a Dublino,"Ottimo hotel, posizione centralissima e comodo anche da e x l'aereoporto, moderno pulito, personale gentile e cordiale, molto varia l'ottima colazione inclusa nel prezzo wifi in tutto l'hotel da consigliare",5,2017,05,31
231,"buona posizione, ci sta'!","posizionato appena sopra la zona  di maggior richiamo turistico (Temple), 10 minuti a piedi. Stanza luminosa, spartana ma pulita. manca cassaforte e bar in stanza ma è presente al secondo piano e in reception hanno cassaforte. la zona non è proprio delle più belle ma è safe! Considerato che Dublino l'abbiamo girata tutta a piedi, consiglio di vedere la stessa catena situata nei pressi di Patrick, il quartiere è più signorile, siete a 15 min dal casino ma vi sono comunque ottimi pub .
Altra pecca WiFi altalenante perchè la banda veloce è a richiesta e con un costo a parte!!! Altra considerazione, le finistre son sigillate per cui il ricambio d'aria è esclusivamente via condizionatore!!!",3,2017,05,30
231,Absolut OK,"Städte Tour Dublin. Über die Karte die Lage geprüft und du zu diesem Hotel gekommen.
Das Hotel ist ziemlich gross, was man von vorne nicht gleich vermutet. Zimmer zweckmäßig an aber nicht besonders. Dicker Teppich so weit das Auge reicht. Neuen sind gut. Allerdings bei Nutzung von zwei Männern sollte man sich gut kennen. Es ist schon ziemlich eng. Einrichtung in die Jahre gekommen aber OK. Hervorragende Sauberkeit im ganzen Haus. Hotelbar gut sortiert. Zweckmäßig gutes Hotel für eine Städte Tour. Zimmer nach vorne etwas laut. ",3,2017,05,28

231,Rundum passend für Dublinbesuch,"3 Nächte-Aufenthalt an Ostern 2017 (Große Touristendichte)
Lage am Rande des Zentrums, für Fußgänger wie uns perfekt. Busstop für Airport, Belfast, Hopandgo um die Ecke, ruhiges Zimmer (Standard) in Seitengasse (Wichtig, da derzeit Bauarbeiten an der großen Haupstraße vor dem Hotel)
- O' Connel Street ist um die Ecke und führt direkt ins Zentrum Richtung Trinity University (Ca 15 Min)
- Guiness Brewery innert 20-25 Min zu Fuß erreichbar.
- Im Hotel ist das reichhaltige und gute Frühstück (alle Geschmacksrichtungen) sein Geld wirklich wert.
- Zimmer (Standard) ist geräumig und modern eingerichtet (TV, WLAN inkl), Bad beinhaltet Dusche in der Wanne mit Vorhang, was für uns nicht begeistert, aber ok ist, da alles sauber. Betten hätten für uns 1,85 und1,76 Große ein bischen länger sein können, was jedoch durch die Lange Decke kompensiert werden konnte. Service war sehr freundlich und aufmerksam.
Am Check-In wurde ein Parkhaus, ca 5 Gehminuten entfernt,  mit vergünstigter Parkgebühr empfohlen (10 EUR/Nacht), was sehr empfehlenswert ist.
Supermärkte für das ""Kleine"" zwischendurch oder Bars und Restaurants sind in derselben Straße, der Gemüsemarkt um die Ecke in der Seitenstraße.
Kurzum, für uns wars die richtige Wahl und wir können es wärmstens weiterempfehlen.",5,2017,04,27
231,Wurden postiv überrascht,"Wir hatten uns nicht viel erwartet von Hotel wurden aber postiv überrascht.
Das Personal sehr freundlich und hilfsbreit und die Zimmer zu unserer überraschung recht groß

Vom Hotelrestaurant waren wir auch überrascht, lecker und nicht so teuer wie erwartet.",5,2017,04,22
231,Perfecto,"Moderno, comodo, muy buen servicio, en una zona espectacular!!! Habitaciones amplias, camas comodisimas. Estuve en una triple y las 3 personas tuvimos el mismo confort, ( no habia catre, ni cama supletoria) lo recomiendo, para pasar buena estadia, si quieren desyuno es muy bueno como asi tambien el restaurante",5,2017,04,16
231,Enttäuschend,"Wir waren als vierköpfige Familie für eine Woche in dem Hotel und nicht wirklich begeistert.
3 Punkte für die sehr gute Lage, das Frühstück und das freundliche Personal an der Rezeption, zwei Punkte Abzug für die Zimmer und das unaufmerksame Zimmerpersonal.
In den Zimmern gab es keine Toilettenbürste, keine Vorhänge, Ablagen, Schränke oder Steckdosen im Bad. Die Zimmertür ging unglaublich schwer und laut auf. Das Toilettenpapier wurde nicht aufgefüllt, der Shampoospender war defekt. Die Internetvetbindung war langsam, das Bett liess sich nicht arretieren und rollte herum.",3,2017,04,14
231,Moderno y lindo,"Las instalaciones es lo mejor que ofrece el lugar, una estancia cómoda, para descanso total, el servicio de restaurante buenísimo y que decir de la.ubicacion. Muy recomendado, el personal muy amable y el precio vale el servicio. ",4,2017,04,11

231,Una magnífica elección de hotel,"Se trata de un hotel moderno y funcional. Localizado en pleno centro de la ciudad, a minutos caminando de la mayoría de los lugares turísticos, es facilmente accesible desde el aeropuerto (existe una parada de autobús público muy-muy cerca del hotel ... la forma más barata de llegar al centro de la ciudad desde el aeródromo). Los servicios del hotel son magníficos. Nos sentimos muy bien tratados por tod@s l@s trabajadores durante nuestra estancia de varios días. El desayuno es impresionante. Un buffet muy completo y que incluye el desayuno tradicional irlandés!!!",5,2017,03,08
231,nos dejaron tirados,"mi opinión es que os aseguréis la reserva pq a nosotros nos dejaron colgados una habitación y nos mandaron a otro hotel y tuvimos que aceptar sus condiciones, es decir, a las una de la madrugada nos mandaron a otro hotel y al dia siguiente venían a recogernos a las nueve de la mañana",1,2017,03,06
231,Più apparenza che sostanza,"Tipico grande albergo, abbastanza appariscente ma povero nella sostanza. Il dispenser del sapone era rotto, mancava lo spazzolino del WC, il recipiente di acqua fresca aromatizzata al limone presente nella hall faceva scendere un filino d'acqua tanto esiguo da far passare la voglia di bere. La carta magnetica per l'ascensore si è smagnetizzata due volte in 16 ore. Il parcheggio convenzionato ""nelle vicinanze"" si trova a due isolati di distanza ma a causa dei lavori stradali per raggiungerlo si deve fare un giro lunghissimo... Una esperienza negativa",3,2017,03,02
231,Ottimo,"Ci sono stato per lavoro e ho trovato l'hotel molto pulito.

Nos lo aconsejo la agencia y antes de decidir os por un hotel u otro evidentemente lo miramos en TripAdvisor y tiene buena puntuación y buenas críticas, pero al conocer la habitación, nos quedamos sorprendidos porque estaba mucho mejor de lo que nos esperábamos en la gama media que elegimos de tipo de hotel. Nos alojamos cuatro noches y ni un solo ruido, ni nada mal. La habitación nueva, el baño nuevo, la decoración de estilo vanguardista, sencilla pero buena y la localización con respecto al centro de Dublin es estupenda, un agradable paseo de diez minutos por la zona comercial peatonal y estás en el Trinity College. En serio, sorprendida de lo bien que resultó la elección.",5,2017,01,27

Nella struttura non si conosce altra lingua parlata che l'inglese!

Hotel war gut, Betten sehr gut, Zimmer normal groß und sehr sauber. Sehr freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal, Frühstück landestypisch, hat aber Potential in Hinblick der angebotenen Vielfalt nach oben, reichte uns aber durchaus für den Kurzaufenthalt.
Würde (und werde im Juni) hier wieder buchen, allein der perfekten Lage wegen.
Preis ist angemessen.",4,2017,01,09
231,Excelente servicio,"Mi hermana y yo estuvimos en Navidad en este hotel.Nos atendieron estupendamente.Tuve un problema con mi equipaje en el aeropuerto y todos se volcaron ofreciéndome su ayuda.La atención recibida por los empleados del hotel Ana y Ross fue extraordinaria, y la manager Anna demostró ser una persona que se preocupa por  los clientes.

Personale gentile ma non gentilissimo con qualche pecca organizzativa di accoglienza in reception e informazioni fornite. Il bar offre cibo discreto, con un personale altrettanto discreto che non si addice ad un hotel.
Le camere sono pulite, ma piuttosto anonime. 
Per due notti in dicembre in un weekend non sospetto, abbiamo speso circa 277 euro, quando qualche giorno dopo la stessa stanza costava per due notti la metà. E hotel più rinomati costavano poco più.. insomma non c'è rapporto qualità prezzo perché parliamo di un tre stelle..",3,2016,12,20
231,Ottima posizione e buon servizio,"La posizione è ottima. praticamente sua O'Connol , a due passi dal centro ma anche comodo per aeroporto e stazione. 
Buone le stanze e anche la colazione. Cortese il personale al desk e disponibile a fornire ottimo supporto turistico.",4,2016,12,12
231,El mejor hotel para pasar unas buenas vacaciones ,"El hotel es fabuloso, muy limpio, cómodo, caliente, con todo tipo de comodidades y un personal muy atento educado y siempre más de uno en recepción. Además está bien situado con bares y tiendas rodeándolo y a solo 10 minutos andando de Temple Bar. Una opción exquisita 👏🏻",5,2016,12,08
231,Da ritornaci di sicuro ,"Hotel centralissimo, arredamento nuovo, camere dotate di bagno con vasca, servizi funzionali , internet rapido fruibile in tutto l'albergo, personale gentile e attento alle esigenze dei clienti. Unico neo la mancanza di cassaforte in camera e nessun canale italiano in TV.",4,2016,12,08
231,Ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo.,"Si trova abbastanza vicino al centro, su di una strada trafficata ma ben servita dai mezzi pubblici: comunque è silenzioso, pulito ed il personale è cortese.
La colazione non è inclusa ma nei dintorni si trovano locali tipo bar.",4,2016,12,04
231,Ottima posizione il resto ...insomma,"L'hotel si trova in ottima posizione per visitare la città.
Le camere come tutta la struttura dovrebbe essere rimesso a posto.
Per la colazione ho optato per il bar di fronte.
Adiacente c'e' un parcheggio a pagamento dove poter lasciare l'auto.",3,2016,12,02
231,"Correcto, cerca del centro","Califico como muy bueno, porque no hay opción intermedia de bueno, que sería lo real.
Está en una zona un poco decrépita, mejor no adentrarse por esos barrios. Pero sin embargo doblas la esquina y te situas en la comercial y transitada calle O' Connell. En 15 minutos de ameno paseo te situas en la zona del Trinity College, del Temple bar....de todo el cogollito.
Y dispone de autobuses cercanos.
Una buena opción a precio medio.",4,2016,11,24
231,La cosa migliore la posizione ,"Ho soggiornato due notti in questo hotel, molto diverso dalle foto publicate, quantomeno la mia stanza.
Stanze piccole, non molto curate, ma in linea con lo standard di Dublino, però devo dire pulite.
Buona la posizione.
Nel complesso discreto",3,2016,11,22
231,Hotel tradicional muy comodo,"Habitaciones muy grandes y comodas, tambien el baño y una muy buena ducha. Sin frigobar pero nos dejaban cafe y te junto a la jarra electrica. Bien ubicado en zona tranquila pero comercial. No tuvimos inconvenientes, nos toco una habitacion interna, con ventana a un patio interior muy tranquilo pero lejos de los ascensores. La caja de seguridad no esta en la habitacion, esta en la recepcion del hotel.
El wifi es sin cargo y el de nuestra habitacion fue muy bueno.",3,2016,11,09
231,buon albergo in posizione strategica,"E' un buon albergo, sito in posizione non centrale ma con molt mezzi di trasporto a pochi passi. Camere abbastanza pulite, quasi perfettamente insonorizzate. Cena e colazione nella norma (ricordiamoci dove siamo... qwuindi niente olio o condimenti...)",4,2016,11,06
231,Buena ubicación pero con detalles algo decepcionantes,"Hemos hecho una ruta por Irlanda y este era nuestro último alojamiento. Hemos tenido cosas buenas y cosas que nos han decepcionado.  Lo bueno es que esta céntrico, esta al lado de O'Conell Street (cerca de la parada del autobus que va al aeropuerto), enfrente justo hay un Tesco, estamos a 15 minutos andando de Temple Bar, las habitaciones amplías y tranquilas, y según a quien encuentres en recepción es más o menos amable. Cuando llegamos nos atendió un chico muy amable Ross (sino me equivoco), y a pesar de que llegábamos algo antes de la hora de entrada, unos 30 minutos más o menos, se preocupo de buscarnos una habitación que estuviera preparada para que pudiéramos entrar ya, hablaba algo de español lo cual también ayudo, nos dio un mapa nos explico un poco de los alrededores y nos comento que si necesitábamos cualquier cosa no dudáramos en preguntarle, la verdad un profesional de 10!, subimos a la habitación y nos acordamos que no habíamos impreso la entrada de Kilmainham Gaol, por lo que la descargamos pasamos a un pendrive y nos dirigimos a recepción por si la podíamos imprimir, mientras esperábamos un chico de seguridad/conserje muy amable nos pregunto si nos podía ayudar le explicamos y nos comento que si lo enviábamos por mail nos lo imprimirían, cuando le preguntamos a la chica de recepción nos dijo que no podían,  le preguntamos si había algún sitio donde pudiéramos hacerlo y nos dijo por los alrededores, sin especificar nada, estoy seguro de que no somos los primeros que nos encontramos en esta situación y si el otro chico nos aporto esa solución es porque otras veces lo habrían hecho, y ojo no pretendía que nos lo imprimieran gratis. Otro detalle negativo, normalmente cuando tienes puesto el cartel de no molestar no te suelen hacer la habitación, y cuando quieres que te la hagan solo tienes que darle la vuelta al cartel y te la hacen, esto lo habiamos usado alguna vez en otros hoteles si ningún tipo de problema, pero aquí no, te dejan una bolsa con toallas y una nota que si quieres que te hagan la habitación has de llamar. Para acceder a los ascensores y a las habitaciones tienes que hacerlo con la llave/tarjeta, pues el sábado por la noche no muy tarde, serían las 23:30 mas o menos, nos para una persona de seguridad, con cara de pocos amigos preguntándonos a que habitación ivamos, como no se quedo contento también el nombre, y si lo hubiera comprobado en la lista o hubiera sido algo más amable pues aquí no habría pasado nada, pero las formas, y me pregunto, a todo el mundo le hacía les preguntaba o solo a nosotros por no ser de más edad o vestir con traje ???  Teniendo en cuenta que este ha sido el hotel más caro de toda nuestra ruta, y estos detalles que no los he encontrado en otros hoteles, ya no solo en este viaje sino en otros que he estado, me volvería a alojar aquí ??? Bufff, pues no lo se, no creo que fuera mi primera opción, no lo descartaría pero buscaría alternativas.",3,2016,11,04
231,un lugar estupendo para tu estancia en Dulin,"Estuvimos este mes de septiembre alojados tres noches en este hotel, solo puedo decir que tiene una estupenda ubicación, andando se puede ir al centro y esta en una zona comercial muy moderna. Sirven un fantastico desayuno, muy completo. La atención tanto en el restaurante, como en recepción es muy buena. Volveriamos a alojarnos en él.",4,2016,11,03
231,Ottima posizione,"Buon albergo ottima pulizia e posizione perfetta per Dublino .Lo risceglierò ritornando in città .Fermata aeroporto a pochissimi metri , supermercati e caffetteria per la colazione di fronte all'ingresso",4,2016,10,26
231,Excelente hotel,"Excelente ubicacion en el centro de Dublin, muy buen hotel, moderno y confortable, quedamos muy satisfechos de la estancia.Personal muy amable.El desayuno variado y rico. Como unico defecto pondría que no había ningún canal en español en la televisión y en la habitación no había caja fuerte.",5,2016,10,26
231,Buen hotel,"Hotel muy céntrico, para ir andando a todos los sitios. Lleno de tiendas y supermercados alrededor y al lado de un centro comercial que comunica con la principal calle de tiendas. El hotel no es ninguna preciosidad pero esta muy limpio y para dormir es mas que suficiente. El desayuno tipo buffet. Lo recomiendo.",5,2016,10,26
231,Gutes Stadthotel in idealer Lage,"Solides Hotel, ideal gelegen, wenn man die Stadt erkunden möchte. O'connell street ist direkt um die Ecke, dort halten diverse Hop on hop off Busse und auch der Airlink Express. Zu Fuß braucht man nicht mehr als ca. 20 Minuten zu den diversen Sehenswürdigkeiten Dublins oder nach Temple Bar.

Die Zimmer sind klassisch gehalten, sauber und ruhig. Das Personal ist freundlich und zuvorkommend, vom Rezeptionisten, über Barkeeper bis hin zum Zimmermädchen.

Wir haben sehr lange vor dem Reisetermin über ein Hotelbuchungsportal gebucht und dadurch relativ günstige Preise bekommen. Die Preise, die das Hotel nennt, sind u. E. zu hoch angesetzt.

Wer nicht im Hotel frühstücken möchte, findet rund um das Hotel diverse Cafes/Bistros, wo man gut frühstücken kann.",4,2016,10,26
231,Excelente Ubicación,"Muy bien ubicado para hacer turismo por Dublin. Todo esta muy cerca caminando, incluso la parada de los autobuses, el transporte al aeropuerto y la de las agencias de excursiones. Amplia habitación, servicio de café y té, falta un pequeño frigorífico.Trato exquisito. El edredón de una de las camas era pequeño y resultaba un poco incómodo. Buena calidad de sueño. Todos los hoteles en Dubli  son caros y este está en la linea. El wifi en la habitación era un poco deficiente.",4,2016,10,23
231,De puente,"Buen hotel, centrico, limpio y el desayuno buffet es variado. Recomendable. La cama y habitación son cómodas y bien insonorizadas. El precio es un poco alto, pero es lo normal en Dublin. Cerca hay todo tipo de servicios.",5,2016,10,18

231,Sightseeing in Dublin,"Hervorragende Lage für eine Städtereise, gleich um die Ecke liegt die Parnell Street, auch Temple Bar ist problemlos zu Fuß zu erreichen. Ein paar nette Pubs sind ebenfalls in Laufweite. Zimmer sind schön, Bäder sind chic, Service ist sehr gut. Kann man weiter empfehlen. ",5,2016,10,12
231,Non male,"Buona la posizione ed il rapporto qualità prezzo rispetto ad altre strutture di Dublino.ottima colazione,con ampio spazio alla colazione irlandese (meno scelta per chi predilige la colazione dolce).personale abbastanza gentile,magari non solerte nell'esaudire le richieste del cliente:abbiamo chiesto 2 volte la culla per la nostra bambina di 4 mesi(per iscritto al momento della prenotazione e oralmente in reception)senza riuscire ad averla,nonostante ci fosse stato detto che se ne sarebbero occupati subito(non abbiamo insistito oltre arrangiandoci con il ""lettone"").buona la pulizia,camera più che discreta.",3,2016,10,11
231,Für Städtekurztrip ok,"Wir waren Anfang Oktober für 2 Nächte in diesem Hotel. Unser Zimmer war besonders groß,da es für Rollstuhlfahrer ausgerichtet war. Auch das Bad war behindertengerecht. Das Personal war freundlich und zuvorkommend. Wir hatten Frühstück dabei,welches recht durchschnittlich ist. Man bekommt Eier,Speck und Baked Beans sowie Würstchen. Auch eine kleine Müsliecke ist zu finden. Es ist sicherlich kein Luxushotel,biete aber alle Annehmlichkeiten für eine Städtekurztrip.",3,2016,10,09
231,Sehr zentral gelegen und Optimal um die Stadt zu erkunden,"Das Hotel liegt zentral in Dublin und ist gut vom Flughafen zu erreichen.

Die Zimmer sind ordentlich und das gesamte Hotel ist sehr sauber.

Es gibt eine Hotelbar im 2. OG welche lange geöffnet hat mit einem guten Angebot.

Das Frühstück Buffet ist reichhaltig und für jeden was dabei. 
Der Frühstücksraum ist nicht sehr gross und daher sehr gut frequentiert über die ganze Zeit.

Ein guter Ausgangspunkt um die Stadt zu erkunden. Daher beim nächsten Besuch in Dublin erste Wahl.",4,2016,10,05
231,Week end a Dublino,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel nel week end del 1° maggio.

231,Molto ben posizionato e tranquillo," In centro e vicinissimo alla fermata O'Connel Street del bus dall'aeroporto, comodissimo. Colazione molto buona e varia, stanze comode, unica pecca forse il bagno in camera un po vecchio e l'impianto di riscaldamento/raffrescamento un po rumoroso, anche se è possibile programmarlo o spegnerlo direttamente dalla stanza. Personale molto cordiale.",4,2016,09,30
231,BUENO,"El hotel estaba bien situado en zona centrica .A  menos de diez minutos del Trinity College andando por una  avenida muy comercial y animada a tres minutos de la Oficina de Correos que hay que visitar.La habitacion era triple y estaba bien, tenia plancha y tabla para planchar.La ducha era fija y no habia gorro de baño.El desayuno bueno y variado.",4,2016,09,28

231,Visita de turismo ,"Es un excelente hotel ubicado a pocos pasos de los sitios de interés y a 2 minutos del transporte al aeropuerto, y salidas a los alrededores, etc.  Los desayunos tienen diferentes opciones, están bien, tiene un buen precio para ser Dublín. Las habitaciones son cómodas, limpias invitan a descansar, el servicio es amable tanto en recepción como en el restaurante y el botones también.  Muchas gracias, la próxima oportunidad sin duda volvería a este hotel",5,2016,09,27
231,Buena elección,"Ubicacion perfecta. Bien conectado desde el aeropuerto y con el resto de la ciudad mediante el transporte público y, caminando, a un paso de Temple Street.  Perfecto para callejear por la ciudad. Habitación amplia. Buen trato por parte del personal. ",4,2016,09,22
231,"Direkt in der City, europäischer Standard, kein eigener Parkplatz","Das Hotel liegt in unmittelbarer Näher der O`Connel Street. Einen großes Haus mit durchschnittlichem Standard. Bei vielen Gästen haben die Schlüsselkarten nicht gut funktioniert, auch bei uns nicht.

Gutes Frühstück mit viel Auswahl die Zimmer sind groß und waren sauber.

Nachteilig ist, dass es keinen Parkplatz gibt. Ein Parkhaus ist 10 Minuten entfernt und kostet auch nochmal 10 € am Tag. Das Haus liegt an einer stark befahrenen Straße und man kann kaum anhalten und wenigstens sein Gepäck ausladen. 

Sieht man vom Parken ab, kann ich das Haus empfehlen, es kostet allerdings auch nicht wenig.",3,2016,09,17
231,Hotel in zenraler Lage,"Sehr zentrale,  Lage . Nette Begrüßung, flotter check-in, freundliches Personal. Sehr gut ausgestattetes Zimmer mit ausreichend geräumigem Bad . Gepflegt.

231,Gute Lage,"Das Hotel ist zentral gelegen, zu Fuss das meiste in kurzer Zeit erreichbar. Ebenfalls hat es vor dem Haus eine Bushaltestelle.
Das Hotel ist sauber und das Personal freundlich und hilfsbereit. Es gibt ein grosses und gutes Frühstücksbuffet.
Etwas mühsam ist, dass man überall die Karte einstecken muss um die Türen zu öffnen. Beim betreten des Hotels ist dies noch logisch aber selbst wenn man auf Toilette oder zum Gang der Zimmer geht braucht man die Karte obschon beim benutzen des Liftes diese gebraucht wurde.",4,2016,09,12
231,Gutes Hotel an zentraler Lage,"Das Hotel ist sehr zentral gelegen und ideal für einen Städtetripp.
Reichhaltiges Frühstücksbuffet, saubere Zimmer und sehr freundliches Personal tragen zu einem unvergesslichen Aufenthalt in Dublin bei.",4,2016,09,12

231,Ottimo hotel a Dublino ..professionalità e gentilezza,"ottimo hotel  vicino al centro di Dublino: molto facile raggiungere le principali attrazioni e comodo per  spostamenti con bus. Gli adetti alla reception sono efficienti gentili e preparati.Camera molto tranquilla .ottima pulizia.
Non ho usufruito della prima colazione .quindi non posso dare un giudizio.",4,2016,08,30
231,VICINO AL CENTRO..........BUONA POSIZIONE,"Hotel utilizzato alla prima notte del nostro Tour in Irlanda.
Modesto, senza grandi pretese ma accettabile e pulito. Ben posizionato vicino alla O' Connell Street e quindi centrale (in meno di 10 minuti a piedi si arriva proprio in centro vicino a Temple Bar e al Trinity College).
Colazione abbastanza varia, ambiente un po' caotico per la presenza di gruppi ma personale cortese.
Connessione wi-fi piuttosto lenta.
Consigliato per il rapporto qualità-prezzo.",3,2016,08,30
231,L'Irlanda e le sue meraviglie Tour dal 18 al 25 Agosto 2016,"Inizio del ns tour, prima sera in questo albergo, come al solito siamo noi gli sfortunati del ns gruppo, soli al secondo piano, (tutti gli altri erano sullo stesso piano) in fondo ad un corridoio, in una camera piccola dove ho dovuto appoggiare una valigia su di una sedia mentre l'altra sull'asse da stiro che si trovava in camera, lo spazio da una parte del letto era solo di circa 30 cm una fatica per passare, la vista fuori era pessima, mi piacerebbe proprio sapere come vengono assegnate le camere: possibile che capiti sempre a noi??  In compenso buona la colazione",2,2016,08,29
231,Recomendable sin ninguna duda!,"Perfecto para recorrer Dublin a pie, muy céntrico sin estar en el bullicio como los hoteles de Temple Bar. 
El staff muy muy agradable y servicial, ¡sobretodo un chico Canario que nos fue de gran ayuda!
Las habitaciones son correctas, muy limpias y con detalles. El wifi funciona muy bien.",5,2016,08,29
231,Recomendable,"Hotel grande y bien ubicado en una zona con supermecados y cafeterias.Apenas de un minuto de o'conell street donde se encuentran todas las paradas de autobus que te llevan al aeropuerto y además te permite recorrerte caminando todo dublin.

231,Recomiendo,"Hotel muy céntrico se puede llegar andando a toda la zona de bares de Temple Street, la wifi funciona  muy bien, las habitaciones y baño son muy correctos,  desayuno típico Irlandés y las cenas de viaje organizado también muy correctas.
He estado dos veces y lo recomiendo.
",4,2016,08,21
231,Sehr schönes Hotel ,"I'm großen und ganzen ist dieses Hotel sehr zu empfehlen. Sehr sauber, freundliches Personal, zentral gelegen, leicht zu finden, leckeres Frühstück. Es gibt nur ein paar Kleinigkeiten die mich, nicht wirklich gestört, mehr gewundert, haben.  Zum einen ist weder in den Zimmern noch im Frühstücksbereich irgendwo eine Uhr. Man muß immer entweder ein Handy oder eine Armbanduhr dabei haben, vor allem wenn man zu einer bestimmten Uhrzeit irgendwo hin möchte. Das zweite war für mich eher eklig. Es  gibt einfach keine Toilettenbürste in den Zimmern. Ich meine,klar gibt es Putzfrauen, aber es gibt doch auch Spuren die möchte man gerne selber entfernen. Mir geht es zumindest so,vor allem wenn ich nicht alleine Reise. Aber sonst war alles top. Würde mir für den nächsten Besuch in Dublin wieder dieses Hotel aussuchen ",4,2016,08,21
231,Prima tappa in Irlanda ,Hotel molto comodo per posizione. Ottimo collegamento  con areoporto e con il centro. Stanze silenziose anche se la camera familiare in po piccola. Ottima e abbondante  colazione.  Sicuramente  da consigliare. ,5,2016,08,20
231,Sehr gut für einen Städtetrip,"Zentrale Lage nahe der O'Connelstreet mit u.a. einer Haltestelle für die Hop on Hop off Busse! Zimmer waren jetzt nicht ""bombe"" aber angemessen. Positiv ist vor allem das reichhaltige Frühstück aufgefallen. Nervend war allerdings, dass man an wirklich jeder erdenklichen Tür die Zimmerkarte zum Öffnen reinstecken muss (sogar für die Toilette!). Nicht nur aus Brandschutzgründen hier undenkbar.",4,2016,08,19
231,A due passi dal centro: great!,"Hotel in una posizione ottima si raggiunge il centro a dieci min a piedi. La struttura è bella e le stanze sono pulite e dotate di ogni comfort. Ai piani persino distributori di bibite e snacks. La colazione viene servita al secondo piano. La sala a mio avviso è un po' piccola per la capienza di persone  che l'hotel può ospitare... Ma è ben gestita. Buffet abbondante e colazione intercontinentale... Cameriere attente a sparecchiare e ad ogni necessità del cliente... Così come il
Personale della reception. Hotel valido centrale e rapporto qualità prezzo buono!
Lo consiglio",4,2016,08,17
231,Vacanza in Irlanda...quinta e ultima tappa! ,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel dal 4 al 7 agosto, ultima tappa del nostro viaggio. Buon Hotel, molto pulito e personale cortese. Avendo riconsegnato la macchina presso l'aeroporto di Dublino, abbiamo trovato l'ubicazione dell'hotel decisamente comoda per raggiungere il centro a piedi, zona pedonale dietro l'angolo. Ci siamo mossi sempre a piedi,  raggiungendo tranquillamente il Trinity College, Temple Bar e tutto quanto nei dintorni. Consigliato. ",4,2016,08,13
231,Comodo e bello,Comodissimo a O'Connel Street ed al centro con camera vista Spire. Camere pulitissime con gradevoli arredi moderni. Personale alla reception che parla anche italiano. Ottima colazione sia Irish che continentale. È stato il nostro primo albergo per il nostro tour irlandese e diciamo che è stato un ottimo inizio. ,5,2016,08,05
231,Muy bueno,"La única pega que pondría es que a las 5.30 pm la habitación todavia estaba sin hacer pero supongo que estarian a tope. Todo lo demás muy bien, limpieza, atención, comida... El hotel esta super centrico, delante de cristchurch y Dublinia. El bus que te lleva al aeropuerto lo cojes al lado.....",4,2016,08,05
231,Naja,"Zuerst gab man uns ein Zimmer, das nicht der gebuchten Kategorie entspricht. Der Preis mit lt. Aushang 399€/ Person und Nacht ist gelinde gesagt eine Frechheit. Erstaunlicherweise war das Zimmer der höheren Kategorie gleich teuer. Das Doppelbett ist so großzügig bemessen, das EINER bequem drin liegen kann. Vom Frühstück hatten wir nicht viel erwartet. Ich finde, es gibt für die Menge der Gäste zu wenig Personal, so dass bei Andrang nicht rechtzeitig nachgelegt werden konnte. Zudem wird dort nicht eingedeckt, jeder helfe sich selbst (bei den aufgerufenen Preisen ein Unding, glücklicherweise war unsere Reisebürobuchung günstiger, aber immerhin noch stolze 180€, würde ich in D nicht zahlen). Wir nicht wieder. ",2,2016,08,05
231,Excelente ubicación,"Ubicación, buena cama, buena ducha, muy buen desayuno. Todo esta a un nivel de servicios a la altura de lo que esperaba.
Lo recomiendo para que la visita a Dublin sea perfecta. Sobre todo, esta muy cerca de la zona de ocio mas amplia y fabulosa de la ciudad. ",4,2016,08,02
231,Muy recomendable por la ubicación,"El hotel se encuentra en Parnell Street, en el centro, a 15min de la zona del Temple bar a pie. Se trata de una zona muy bien comunicada, no hay que andar más de 5min para encontrar las paradas de bus que llevan al aeropuerto, los buses hop-on hop-off, el tranvía.. además de ser una calle con varios supermercados junto al hotel (un tesco y un lidl), cafeterías, tiendas, centros comerciales, sitios de comida rápida.. Muy bien situado.

En cuanto al servicio, pedimos dos habitaciones, una de ellas con cama individual, pero debido a un fallo en la agencia nos habían asignado dos con camas dobles, por lo que al contarles lo ocurrido nos dieron una habitación más grande a ambos y sin cobrarnos más (estas habitaciones, 1 cama doble y 1 individual, son mas caras, a pesar de haber pagado nosotros las normales). Por tanto, muy agradables.

En cuanto a la habitación, no hubo ruidos, si eso la gente entrando y saliendo de sus habitaciones pero no era muy frecuente, realmente solo íbamos al hotel para dormir. Las camas muy muy cómodas (la doble), tenía plancha, secador y una cafetera. No tenía nevera y el baño era normalito. El servicio de habitaciones no dejó que desear, todo muy bien, las habitaciones quedaban totalmente limpias. 

Nosotros no pagamos el desayuno porque aumentaba el precio en 300 euros y nos pareció muy caro, pero tampoco fue problema ya que a escasos metros del hotel había una cafetería económica y que tenía de todo prácticamente.

La pena del viaje fue que nos encontramos la ciudad en obras, y de vez en cuando encontrábamos borrachos dando voces, pero por lo que vivimos el hotel estupendo, situado en una zona muy bien conectada y muy práctica. Muy recomendable.",4,2016,07,31
231,Buen hotel,"El hotel está ubicado en Parnell Street, donde a distancia andando puedes tomar el bus turistico y otros transportes para conocer Dublin.
Las habitaciones muy amplias, comodas y limpias, con internet gratis, por lo que es una opción muy recomendable.
No contratamos el desayuno ya que algunos dias iriamos de tour, pero justo enfrente del hotel hay un restaurante donde tanto el desayuno como la cena son excelentes y a un precio accesible.",4,2016,07,27
231,Guter Durchschnitt,"Einfacher wäre es ohne Auto anzureiesen. Eine Parkgarage zu finden, bei den Baustellen zur Zeit, ist sehr abenteuerlich. Das Hotel selbst ist guter Durchschnitt, schneller Service und normale Zimmer. Nix Dolles, man kann schlafen. Die Lage des Hotels ist klasse. Mit wenigen Schritten ist man überall, die Wege sind kurz. Das Frühstück für 10 Euro plus dient zur Sättigung, nicht zum Geniesen.",3,2016,07,24
231,Zentral gelegen,"Das Zimmer war schön und sauber. Das Hotel konnte besonders durch seine zentrale Lage überzeugen. Abends konnte man es sich auch noch auf der Innenterrasse nett machen. Das Frühstück bietet zwar reichlich Auswahl, jedoch waren die warmen Speisen höchstens noch lauwarm, der Orangensaft und das Wasser allerdings leider auch.",4,2016,07,20
231,Zentrales Stadthotel,"Jury`s Inn Parnell Street ist ein angenehmes Stadthotel in zentraler Lage. Fast alle Sehenswürdigkeiten Dublins sind bequem per Fuß zu erreichen. Die Zimmer sind mit allem  nötigen ausgestattet. Safe ist in der Lobby. Man sollte ein Zimmer zum Innenhof nehmen, da es nach vorn zur Straße doch laut werden kann. Das Personal war immer freundlich und hilfsbereit. Wlan im ganzen Haus kostenfrei.",3,2016,07,18
231,Mini tour Dublino ,Hotel pulito e confortevole. Il personale educato e molto disponibile anche verso chi non parla molto bene l'inglese. Situato nel centro commerciale di Dublino in una zona comunque tranquilla. Non molto distante (20 minuti a piedi) da Temple Bar e dalla movida. ,4,2016,07,12
231,Muy centrico y agradable,"Situado en la esquina de la calle más populosa de Dublín,pero sin oir el tráfico , las habitaciones amplias y con todos los servicios necesarios, varios enchufes para cargar mobiles, tablets, etc. etc , wifi gratis , tetera para hacer café o infusiones en la habitación, y unas camas enormes y comodísimas, limpio y funcional, con tarjeta para acceder al ascensor, personal amable en recepción, restaurante y cafeteria. Buffet muy completo, en fin, para volver en caso de regreso a Dublín. Estuvimos dos noches no consecutivas, la primera al inicio del tour  por la isla y la segunda al finalizarlo una semana después. Un pequeño inconveniente, el hotel es enorme con largos pasillos y para encontrar la habitación se tiene que hacer un largo recorrido con varios vericuetos, pero es lo unico un poco incómodo",5,2016,07,06
231,ultimi tre giorni a dublino,"non mi è piaciuto il fatto che nel bagno mancava lo spazzolino del wc . che la doccia avesse la cornetta fissa non è molto comoda per lavarsi considerando che da loro non ci sono bidet fare anche una semplice igiene intima  sia per una donna che per un bambino non è pratico . ed i letto non molto comodo.

눇il personale molto gentile e cortese, otiima la pulizia .ottima area colazione con molta scelta. la camera moderna e spaziosa e luminosa.la vicinanza a temple bar ai centri commerciali .posizione ottima. non posso dare altre indicazioni poiche questi tre gg li abbiamo passati chiusi in camera con il bimbo con la febbre alta. :((((",3,2016,07,05
231,Angenehmer Aufenthalt,Gutes Hotel in einer tollen Lage im Herzen von Dublin. Einfacher Check Inn und sehr freundliches Personal haben die Ankunft abgerundet.

231,Posizione centrale e cortesia,Abbiamo passato una sola notte in questo hotel perché l'indomani saremo ripartiti per il rientro a casa... La posizione comunque è centrale ad un passo da negozi e pub.. Camere spaziose e pulite.. Colazione con ampia scelta.. Personale della hall gentilissimo.. Controlli accurati per chi rientra in hotel anche in tarda serata e questo rende più tranquilli noi clienti visto gli ultimi tragici eventi...,4,2016,07,02

231,Posizione ottima ,"La posizione è davvero ottima per visitare a piedi la città, in un attimo sei al centro. Per il resto l'albergo è piuttosto datato, la colazione deludente, il nostro bagno piccolissimo per una sistemazione in tripla. Caos al check in e per l'assegnazione delle camere per il nostro gruppo prenotato dall'agenzia.
Il personale è piuttosto disponibile ma nessuno parlava italiano. A mio avviso troppo caro per il servizio che offre.",3,2016,06,23
231,Amabilidad,"Hotel muy bien situado cerca del centro ,limpieza muy bien y personal  amable sobre todo Rosilda  una brasileña que nos atendió en español .Si vuelvo a Dublin y espero no tardar volveré a este hotel .Desayuno abundante y todo muy rico",4,2016,06,21

231,Che freddo,"Esperienza negativa, la camera aveva l'aria condizionata sempre accesa senza avere nessuna possibilità di controllare la temperatura. Soluzione togliere la tessera che controlla le luci e stare al buio. La risposta del personale...è così che funziona. ",1,2016,06,13
231,Excelente hotel ubicado en pleno centro de Dublin,"Es un muy buen hotel, ubicado a metros de la calle principal de Dublin. Supermarket en frente y a la vuelta.  Habitaciones y baño amplias, muy buena atención del personal, desayuno abundante, wifi gratis y muy veloz. Hotel para recomendar",5,2016,06,13
231,Hotel muy bien ubicado en uno de los puntos céntricos de Dublin,"Muy bien ubicado, el Jurys tiene habitaciones amplias, máquinas con bebidas gaseosas y agua, para comprar con monedas, en cada piso; wi fi libre, y un restaurante con una carta limitada pero que está bien para una noche que no se quiere salir del hotel. La atención del personal es muy, muy buena. El desayuno es satisfactorio, en la modalidad bufet, con frutas naturales, panes, facturas y comidas calientes a la usanza inglesa. No puedo hablar del precio porque fui con un paquete turístico",4,2016,06,11
231,Ottimo soggiorno!,"Albergo grande, pulitissimo, con tutti i confort (phon, asse da stiro, phon, bollitore per farsi un caffè o tea), silenzioso, strategico (vicino alla fermata dell'autobus dell'aereoporto...o' connel Street, al centro con supermercati vicini). Stuff gentilissimo e disponibilissimo per non parlare della ottima colazione!!! se dovessu tornare a Dublino ci ritornerei!",5,2016,06,11
231,In centro,Ottima posizione al centro di Dublino. Albergo datato e bisognoso di un lifting. Tutto efficiente e funzionale. Camere spaziose e pulite. Colazione nella media. Il prezzo dovrebbe essere più basso soprattutto in virtù  della la colazione .,3,2016,06,05
231,Ponte del 2 giugno a Dublino,"Ho trovato difficoltà nel Chek-in , siamo un gruppo di 28 amici e avendomi chiesto la sera prima i nomi per velocizzare il Chek-in da parte dell'hotel , mi sono ritrovato in un caos totale anche perché nessuno capiva l'Italiano e avevano assegnato delle triple inesistenti.La cena al costo di 21 euro a persona era una mozzarella in carrozza , un purè con carne macinata è un bicchiere di riso bianco con un goccia di amarena .... Fate voi i conti",3,2016,06,03

231,"Gute Lage, gutes Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis","Die Lage zu dem Preis ist wirklich sehr gut - war für mich auch die Entscheidungsbasis.

231,Ottimo albergo ottima posizione,"Con un gruppo ci siamo recati in questo albergo! Bello, personale gentile e anche il cibo al ristorante non era male...forse prezzi un po' sopra la media...  Colazione ottima e varia e camere moderne e spaziose. La posizione ottima sia per lo shopping sia per raggiungere i principali monumenti...",4,2016,05,25
231,Cómodo y buena ubicación,"Lamentablemente, tuvimos que cancelar nuestra estancia antes de tiempo por razones ajenas al hotel, a pesar de ello, no hubo ningún problema con la cancelación, facturándonos solo los días que pernoctamos. En general el servicio fue bueno, la localización también (el bus del aeropuerto tiene la parada muy cercana) y el hotel es cómodo. El único ""pero"" es que resulta algo caro, pero teniendo en cuenta el precio de otros hoteles similares, la relación calidad/precio es aceptable.
Si regreso a Dublín, es muy probable que vuelva a alojarme en él.",4,2016,05,16
231,Decisamente deluso,"Quando ho prenotato la struttura ho fatto male i conti andando a spendere 700€ per 3 notti quando invece la tariffa media è la metà per lo stesso numero di notti.
La struttura affaccia sulla strada e l'insonorizzazione delle finestre non è delle migliori: si riesce a dormire ma comunque i clacson ed il traffico si sentono.
La stanza è grande il giusto. Un piccolo angolo guardaroba, il letto, una scrivania, una poltrona ed un divanetto. Forse questi due potevano essere rimossi in favore di un letto più grande.
Non c'è un minibar né una cassaforte. Il primo almeno sarebbe servito per tenere qualcosa in fresco.
Il bagno è minuscolo ed antiquato. La ceramica della vasca e del lavabo mostrano i segni del tempo. Le pareti e la moquette sono macchiate in tutta la stanza.
Oltre alla camera abbiamo aggiunto la colazione in albergo.
La sala della colazione è decisamente grande, spaziosa e luminosa. Il bancone della colazione invece è decisamente ristretto a confronto.
Di cibo ce n'è, ma per 9€ mi sarei aspettato qualcosa in più. Si può trovare un po' di yogurt e qualche ciotola di cereali. Un vassoio con prosciutto ed un paio di salami. Un vassoio con due tipi di cheddar e qualche pezzetto di brie. Qualche ciotola di frutta sciroppata e tre marmellate. Come bevande ci sono caffè espresso, thè e succo di frutta. È presente la irish breakfast ma né il bacon né le uova mi hanno entusiasmato, ancora meno quando stamattina ho notato che le uova (come da foto) erano verdi.
Assolutamente sconsiglio questa struttura, magari gli altri Jurys Inn della città sono migliori.
",1,2016,05,15
231,Ottimo hotel,"Sono stato in questo hotel qualche giorno fa con amici e devo dire che il soggiorno è stato molto piacevole.
L'hotel è davvero molto bello e grande, bar al secondo piano, ristorante, palestra...
Le camere sono abbastanza spaziose e la pulizia è impeccabile.

Unica pecca la connessione Wi-Fi che in alcune stanze è un po' debole, ma per tutto il resto l'hotel è davvero consigliatissimo!",5,2016,05,12

Colazione buona e personale disponibile. Le camere sono essenziali,pulite e spaziose. Noi siamo stati benissimo a parte una notte che è scattato l'allarme antincendio.",4,2016,04,17
231,Buon hotel ma..,"Viaggio in famiglia. Arrivati chiediamo informazioni sul parcheggio e ci viene data una cartina e una via ma neanche con il navigatore ci siamo arrivati perché a Dublino la maggior parte delle strade non ha numero civico e in più con i lavori in corso è stata un'impresa impossibile. In fine abbiamo optato per il parcheggio dietro l'hotel anche se non convenzionato e mi chiedo perché non lo facciano visto che è così comodo. 
L'hotel è bello e anche la colazione ottima ma durante la notte è scattato l'allarme antincendio e ho perso dieci anni di vita quindi mi sarei aspettato almeno delle scuse al check-out visto che non riuscivano a spegnerlo. A parte questo è consigliato e centrale. ",3,2016,04,16

Das Zimmer hatte eine gute größe und war zwar etwas abgewohnt aber sauber. Das Bad war ebenfalls sauber. Die Matratzen waren für unseren Geschmack etwas zu hart. Letztendlich haben wir aber gut geschlafen. 
Das Frühstück war insgesamt durchschnittlich. Der Kaffee lecker dafür die Brötchen leider nur aufgebacken und nicht sehr schmackhaft.
WLAN funktionierte problemlos und ist selbstverständlich kostenlos.
Deutsches Fernsehen leider Fehlanzeige.
Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit.
Insgesamt für 1 oder 2 Nächte gut zu empfehlen.",3,2016,04,06

231,Hotel muy normalito,"Tengo que decir que en relación calidad/precio fue lo mejor que encontramos. Coincidimos con un concierto ese fin de semana y los precios eran sumamente exagerados y éste fue el hotel que mantuvo la relación calidad-precio más adecuada.
La habitación estaba bien, el cuarto de baño un poco anticuado, pero correcto, como la habitación. La almohada muy fina.  El desayuno estaba muy bien, tenía de todo. 
Si volviera problablemente elegiría otro pero en las circunstancias y fechas que fuimos, nada que objetar.
De situación, muy bien. Dublín es pequeño y se llega andando a todas partes. El bus del aeropuerto tenía una parada a 2minutos andando del hotel. Enfrente hay un Tesco y resturantes para comer.",3,2016,03,21

- kurze Wege zu Fuß in die Innenstadt / Temple Bar

231,"Gute Lage, Frühstück mäßig","Geräumige, ruhige Zimmer mit großen Betten, eher schlicht eingerichtet, aber für den Kurzurlaub in Dublin völlig ausreichend. Tolle Lage, das meiste ist von hier zu Fuß zu erreichen.

Das Frühstück war von der Auswahl sicherlich nicht zu beanstanden, ein irish breakfast war im Pub allerdings deutlich leckerer. Das Buffett war eher auf Masse als Klasse ausgerichtet.",4,2016,02,29
231,Ottima struttura,"Hotel in posizione strategica, pulito e con personale disponibile e gentile. Nonostante la posizione è insonorizzato e consente il rapido accesso ai diversi mezzi di trasporto. Non molto distante la stazione ferroviaria.",5,2016,02,25
231,Ottima posizione,"Hotel molto buono, situato immediatamente dietro a O'Connell Street; perciò vicinissimo alle maggiori attrazioni di Dublino, che sono raggiungibili tutte anche a piedi.
Inoltre la fermata dell'autobus che arriva dall'aeroporto dista non più di 500 mt.
Le camere sono pulite e, tenendo conto che noi eravamo 3 adulti, anche abbastanza spaziose. Come unica piccola pecca, non c'è il minibar; però, come in tutti gli hotel anglosassoni, c'è il bollitore e la possibilità di prepararsi gratuitamente un buon tè. In aggiunta, ad ogni piano vi è un distributore di snack e bevande.
La colazione non era compresa e non l'abbiamo provata; però bisogna dire che nei dintorni, senza neanche spostarsi molto, ci sono innumerevoli locali dove poter fare sia una colazione continentale, che una tipica inglese.
Ottima la misura di sicurezza che permette di chiamare gli ascensori ed andare ai piani solo se si è in possesso della chiave elettronica della camera.
La nostra camera poi, era rivolta all'interno ed era molto silenziosa. Ho notato però delle stanze vicino agli ascensori ed a una porta di servizio, che penso fosse stata una centrale termica, dove c'era costantemente un forte rumore di macchinari che, se per sfortuna mi fossero state assegnate, mi avrebbero fatto immediatamente chiedere lo spostamento.
L'unica nota negativa è stata che la reception, dovendo noi andare all'aeroporto alle 4 del mattino, si è dimenticata di prenotarci il taxi per l'ora stabilita, pur essendoci raccomandati. Comunque il ragazzo che faceva il turno di notte ha saputo rimediare abbastanza prontamente.
Rapporto qualità/prezzo/posizione molto buono.",4,2016,02,24

Cerca de 3 supermercados y buenos restaurantes, lo recomiendo.",4,2016,02,12
231,Buon rapporto qualità/prezzo,"Scelto per un breve soggiorno durante il Ponte dell'immacolata.
La posizione è molto comoda, a pochi passi c'è la fermata dell'autobus che in questa città sono un efficientissimo mezzo di trasporto. E' vicino al centro ed ai principali luoghi di attrazione.
Le camere sono spaziose e la pulizia buona. La colazione, se non inclusa nel prezzo della camera è un pò cara.
In camera disponibile anche un servizio bar con bollitore e caffè. 
Consiglio di chiedere una camera piano alto con vista sulla città, evitate quelle con vista interna.",4,2016,02,12
231,Buon rapporto qualità-prezzo in zona a rischio,"Al primo impatto non si capisce perché bisogna usare la chiave per accedere all'ascensore e al corridoio delle camere, sembrerebbe una misura di sicurezza eccessiva ma la zona non è delle più tranquille e Parnell Street può offrire incontri spiacevoli. Ne deriva una sensazione di insicurezza che rovina la qualità del soggiorno. Mi è stata data una chiave di camera che non funzionava ma può succedere e non è un dramma. Nel complesso buono il prezzo, non grandioso l'arredamento e la distanza dal centro non è eccesiva. ",3,2016,02,09
231,qualita a basso prezzo,sono stato gia tre volte in questo albergo e ogni volta che andro a dublino continuero ad alloggiarci poiche la qualita la pulizia e il prezzo sono incredibilmente competitivi. oltretutto ben collegato per tutte le parti che si vogliono visitare,5,2016,01,27

Wasserkocher mit Kaffee und Tee.Tägliche Reinigung des Zimmers.Die Handtücher wurden täglich gewechselt.
Das Frühstücksbüffet war sehr abwechslungsreich,für jeden etwas dabei.Es wurde schnell nachgelegt.Ein Manko gab es.Da morgens das Frühstück von sehr vielen Gästen besucht wurde,musste man in der gegenüber liegenden Bar frühstücken.Das war uns aber egal,denn dort gab es nicht so ein Gewimmel.
Da das Hotel direkt an der Parnell Street liegt,ist es sehr zentral.
Alles ist gut zu Fuß oder per Bus zu erreichen.Der Flughafenbus Air Link,fährt Ca. 5 Minuten vom Hotel ab.

La stanza essenziale ma pulita e confortevole. Abbastanza ampia,anche se eravamo in 4 e lo spazio era un po' limitato, dotata di bagno con vasca.
Letto comodo, materasso matrimoniale e divano letto per le piccole.
Nelle sale comuni, filodiffusione delle canzoni di Natale.
Avevamo la prima colazione inclusa,posso dire solo eccellente!! Di tutto e di più!
Dalla tipica Irish Breakfast al latte e cereali, alla frutta fresca (addirittura i mandarini sbucciati! un sogno!) a... tutto quello che non c'era si poteva chiedere al personale di sala.
Alle 17.00 insieme a una bevanda calda, in reception, si potevano trovare dei dolcetti natalizi, delle tortine ripiene di marmellata.
E la domenica gadget per i più piccini!!
Ah, wi-fi gratuito in tutta la struttura!
La posizione decisamente comoda per tutti gli spostamenti in città, ristoranti e pub a non più di qualche passo.

231,Hotel muy bien situado,"Sin desmerecer ninguna de las buenas características de este hotel, sin duda su situación y buena relación calidad-precio son las mejores de sus características. Las habitaciones están limpias y equipadas con lo necesario: secador, televisión, cafetera para hacerte tus propias infusiones... En la televisión sólo se ven las cadenas locales pero ¿quién va a Dublín a ver la tele en el hotel? El desayuno era un completo desayuno irlandés. Muy recomendable para conocer la capital de Irlanda. Si hay que poner alguna pega, las paredes son de papel y si te tocan vecinos molestos, que no fue el caso, puedes pasar una mala noche",4,2015,12,12

231,Faire Preise und noch zentral gelegen,"Das Hotel liegt nicht direkt in der ""Party-Meile"", was wahrscheinlich in Dublin aber auch nicht verkehrt ist, sollte man sich an Betrunkenen und Feiernden Leuten nachts stören. Das Hotel kann man zu Fuß erreichen und der Flughafenbus hält ebenfalls in fußläufiger Nähe. Das Frühstück ist OK für irische Verhältnisse (eben nicht vergleichbar mit einem deutschen Wochenend-Frühstück) und die Zimmer waren gut. Sauber war es auch und alles hat gut funktioniert. Direkt gegenüber ist ein kleines Fisch-Restaurant/Pub, unbedingt probieren, war relativ günstig im Vergleich und sehr lecker.",4,2015,11,21
231,una garanzia,"per un recente weekend lungo a Dublino ho trovato una buona offerta per questo hotel della catena Jury's Inn. Ne avevo già provati altri, sia a Dublino che a Londra,. quindi sapevo cosa apettarmi - e non sono stata delusa.
Spazi ampi, puliti, ben arredati. Personale sempre molto efficiente e disponibile, servizi efficienti. Colazione abbondante - c'è di tutto di più!.
Camera e bagno molto confortevole.
Se non optate per il B&B, di fronte a questo c'è un Tesco, e a 1 minuto a piedi più di una caffetteria!
Non sono alberghi prettamente economici, vale la pena cercare delle offerte, però garantiscono servizi e qualità",4,2015,11,19

231,"Top Lage, Top Service, Top Hotel","Wir waren für drei Nächte in diesem Hotel und sind begeistert.
Das Jurys Inn ist eine Hotelkette, während unseres Aufenthaltes sind wir noch zwei weiteren begegnet, die Lage ist jedoch in der Parnellstreet am besten. In unmittelbarer Nähe gibt es eine Vielzahl von Testaurants, Supermärkten und Busstationen. Die Lage ist einfach genial, in das Viertel Tempel Bar ist man nur gemütliche 10min zu Fuß entfernt und wer gerne und viel läuft kann in Dublin eh am besten alles zu Fuß erkunden. Gerade auch von hier aus, da es wirklich auch sehr zentral liegt. 
Die Zimmer sind sehr geräumig und äußerst sauber. Im ganzen Hotel ist freies WLan verfügbar. Das ein und auschecken läuft freundlich schnell und unkompliziert. Für einen Aufpreis von 10 Euro pro Tag steht im Hotel Frühstück zur Verfügung, was wir jedoch leider nicht im Anspruch genommen haben, da gegenüber das Restaurant Kingfishers ist, in welchem man überragend frühstücken kann. Ebenfalls gutes Frühstück gibt es aus dem Hotel heraus und links um die Ecke bei Ann's bakery, was den Bäckern in Deutschland ziemlich ähnlich ist. 
Alles in allem haben wir uns hier sehr sehr wohlgefühlt. Das Taxi zum Flughafen kostet ca. 25-30 Euro.

231,Hotel para ejecutivos,"Un hotel agradable, limpio y cerca del centro.
Cuando me alojé allí, estaba lleno de ejecutivos ya que coincidió con varias ferias en la ciudad. Seguramente debido a esto los precios eran altisimos. El precio no se ajusta con la calidad del hotel, aunque esté muy bien, la verdad es que lo encontré demasiado caro.",3,2015,10,19
231,Ottima sistemazione,"Ubicato nell'angolo con O'Connell Street, consente di raggiungere a piedi i punti nevralgici della città senza usufruire dei mezzi pubblici. Camera spaziosa, silenziosa, pulita e dotata di tutti i comfort  (I letti sono comodissimi!!). Ho scelto la soluzione con colazione inclusa ed anch'essa mi ha soddisfatta pienamente...abbondante, variegata e con pronto rifornimento dei cibi in esaurimento. Consigliato!!!",4,2015,10,19
231,Soprattutto la posizione!,"Hotel veramente molto comodo, in una posizione strategica per visitare la città a piedi e raggiungere tutti i luoghi di interesse.
Camere con tutti i comfort anche se non troppo grandi, ma per quello che si deve fare in camera vanno benissimo!
Colazione vasta e ricca.
Però...c'è un però...non ho amato l'impersonalità dell'hotel, cosa che spesso ho trovato in alberghi di grandi catene come questo.Non so neanche se sia un problema così grande, ma personalmente ho sentito la mancanza di cercare di fare sentire a casa i clienti",4,2015,10,16
231,No me gusto,"Estuve una noche en el hotel, y aunque el servicio es bueno, la limpieza es mala, y la ubicación también, se ve un tanto peligroso el área donde esta ubicado. Quizá una percepción mía, pero esta bien feo el área más próxima al hotel. El desayuno estuvo bien. ",2,2015,10,15
231,Me gustó mucho!,"Lo que más disfruté fue la bañera de la habitación: grande y cómoda, excelente para un buen baño de inmersión! Las camas cómodas y desayuno variado y generoso. Buena ubicación, muy cercano a la O´Connell St. Experiencia muy recomendable.",5,2015,10,13
231,La localización es muy buena,"El hotel es confortable y el personal amable pero lo mejor es la localización dentro de los lugares más interesantes para visitar y próximo a las paradas de los autobuses y trenes.+

231,Un buon Hotel,"Buon hotel a poca distanza dal centro di Dublino, circa 10 minuti a piedi.
Tranquillo, pulito, organizzato è sicuramente un hotel 3 stelle degno di nota.
Buona la colazione, anche se vi è ampia scelta soprattutto tra ""i salati"" salcicce, bacon, pancetta, uova ecc... meno invece nei dolci, cornetti ecc... comunque di buona qualità.
Devo dire di essermi trovato bene.",4,2015,10,12

Lage des Hotel ist optimal besser kann es nicht sein.
Kann es nur empfehlen!",4,2015,10,10
231,"Medio, non di più","Albergo molto grande in buona posizione. Il pregio  principale è la vicinanza dal centro e il parcheggio in convenzione. Accoglienza buona. Molto probabilmente l'hotel ha diversi standard di camere, leggendo le precedenti recensioni. Non so se vi incide il fatto che che ho preso la tripla nel pacchetto riservato a Booking, ma la camera era modesta e le rifiniture medie. Letto non comodissimo, cuscini duri e set accessori bagno inesistenti. Vasca con la tenda non proprio apprezzabile. Colazione buona. Buono il wifi. In sintesi caro per lo standard fornito.",3,2015,10,04

Il posto molto strategico, sia per andare in centro sia per raggiungere eventuali fermate per girare tutta la città per intero. Servizio ottimo, colazione abbondante e variegata, anche per me che sono delicata di stomaco. Mio marito ne è rimasto entusiasta. Siamo rimasti anche al pranzo di Natale, e ci hanno trattato come se fossimo noi i padroni. Personale molto gentile e disponibile per tutto.

231,Ottimo compromesso tra comfort e risparmio!,"Abbiamo alloggiato in questo hotel per 4 notti. Le camere sono molto spaziose e pulite, il letto matrimoniale comodo (anche se non larghissimo) e il bagno agevole.

231,In linea con le aspettative,"Abbiamo soggiornato 2gg + 1gg all'inizio e al termine del nostro tour in Irlanda. L'hotel nel suo complesso ha soddisfatto le nostre attese. Posizione comoda per raggiungere a piedi qualsiasi zona della cittá (Guiness Storehouse compresa). Pulizia della stanza e delle zone in comune impeccabile. Entrambe le camere spaziose (la seconda con un letto in più) e con tutta la dotazione dichiarata. Il personale gentile e disponibile (se. Stampa gratuita carta d'imbarco e custodia valigie post check-out gratuita). Insomma un hotel che consiglierei e che utilizzerei nuovamente per un futuro soggiorno a Dublino.
Non diamo il massimo perché non abbiamo usufruito né del bar né del ristorante, ma ci siamo limitati al solo pernottamento e la visuale da entrambe le camere (semplici finestre e non balconi) non era delle migliori.",4,2015,08,24
231,"Bien céntrico, cómodo ","Nosotras hicimos un tour por Gran Bretaña y los del tour son los que eligen los hoteles por eso no se el precio de este en particular. De todas formas es muy cómodo por lo céntrico que es y vas caminando a todos lados. De todas formas Dublín de por si es muy chiquito así que desde cualquier lado de la ciudad estas bien. Para ser un hotel de esta calidad le faltan servicios como maleteros, o cosas de mejor calidad en el baño pero no esta nada mal. Tiene wifi libre y llega a la habitación. El desayuno es muy bueno.",3,2015,08,24
231,Buena ubicación y calidad,"En cuanto a calidad/precio esta muy bien. Estas en pleno centro de Dublin. A 5 minutos andando tienes O'Connell Street que baja al rio y el centro turístico. También la parada de bus al aeropuerto y los buses turísticos tienen parada en esa calle.

231,Due notti a Dublino,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per due notti ad agosto2015 durante il tour.
La posizione dell'hotel è fantastica: con pochi minuti a piedi si attraversa il fiume e sei subito in centro città. Anche la zona dov'è ubicato l'hotel è piena di locali e di vita.
Le camere sono pulite e spaziose, abbastanza tranquille ed il personale è cortese.
Per quanto riguarda il cibo, noi avevamo la cena come da tour e il menù era deciso dal tour operator. Fantastico il buffet della colazione dove c'era veramente di tutto dal dolce al salato.
Se dovessi tornare a Dublino sicuramente soggiornerei ancora qui.",4,2015,08,10

Buona posizione vicina a O'connel Streeet si vede The spire dalla finestra dell'hotel 
Se non cercate un posto romantico, ma semplicemente funzionale ve lo consigliamo ",4,2015,08,08
231,da ricordare,"Ho soggiornato presso l'hotel I primi di Agosto 2014, la camera era pulita, spaziosa e silenziosa grazie anche al fatto che sempre alla reception specifico che voglio una camera che non dia sulla strada. Cmq risulta perfetto per una visita alla città di Dublino perché è praticamente in centro. Ottima qualità- prezzo. Vale la pena appuntare il nome per le prossime prenotazioni (Jurys Inn è una catena)
Unica nota negativa la moquette che oramai è fuori moda e non da il senso della pulizia, ma è un problema di moltissimi hotel.",4,2015,07,31
231,Mala relacion calidad/precio,"Es un hotel muy caro para lo que ofrecen. La ubicación es correcta, se puede ir andando al centro. El cuarto de baño es espantoso, no había bañera ni plato de ducha, directamente al suelo y sin manpara, una triste cortinilla que no tapaba todo. El desayuno, una experiencia terrible: mesas sucias, muy ruidoso, mal atendido",2,2015,07,28
231,Das Beste ist Killerfish  gegenüber,"Zimmer und Badezimmer sind ok, Betten für 2 Personen viel zu schmal, Frotteewäsche zu dünn und badehandtuch zu schmal. Frühstück in Ordnung aber reichlich unorganisiert, in der Bar nur Selfservice und eine Preisgestaltung die an Wegelagerei erinnert.
Der Innenarchitekt hat ein Faible für Farben die man nicht im Hotel einsetzen sollte - allein der Flur erinnert an ein Krankenhaus.
das Beste ist das Fisch und Chips Restaurant auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite - ein echtes Highlight.",3,2015,07,20

231,Absolut zufrieden!,Kurze Wege. Personal ist sehr aufmerksam. Das Frühstück war hervorragend! Sehr gut ist der Kontakt mit dem Personal. Sehr hilfreich war auch die Möglichkeit direkt über die Rezeption interessante Tageausflüge zu buchen.,4,2015,07,09
231,Gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis mit wenigen Schwachpunkten im Service,"Das Hotel ist ganz ansprechend gestaltet. Zimmer sind zwar klein, aber für ein verlängertes Wochenende / Städtetrip ausreichend. Die Lage ist sehr gut mitten im Zentrum, fussläufig zu den wichtigsten Sehenswürdigkeiten und Bus/Bahn-Anschluss. Ein paar Abzüge gibt es beim Service: An einem Tag bestand die Zimmerreinigung lediglich darin, dass Handtücher ausgetauscht und das Bett gemacht waren, Bad war z.B. überhaupt nicht gereinigt. Das Frühstücksbuffet könnte auch regelmäßiger aufgefüllt werden, man musste immer wieder nachfragen. Ein vorbestelltes Taxi war nicht zur vereinbarten Zeit da (kann natürlich auch am Taxiunternehmen liegen).",4,2015,07,08
231,Funcional y céntrico.,"Hotel funcional y centrico. Muy bien situado y con buenos servicios, los tipicos de un hotel de estas caracteristicad. La habitacion para una familia está bien. Ni sobra espacio, ni falta.  El desayuno buffet me pareció mejorable.
Una muy buena opción para pernoctar en Dublín.",4,2015,07,07
231,Fast nichts auszusetzen,"Das Hotel, das Zimmer und das Bad waren, was ich sehr sehr wichtig finde, sauber.
Das Zimmer selber war geräumig mit genügend großen Bett. Das Bad ziemlich modern. Das Frühstück bietet alles, was man sich wünscht, auch irisches Frühstück.
Es ist sehr zentral gelegen, man ist in wenigen Minuten auf der O'Connell Street (viele Geschäfte, von hier beginnt auch die Stadtrundfahrt per Bus/zu Fuß, Bushaltestelle zum/vom Flughafen). 
Das Personal war freundlich und zuvorkommend. 
Der einzige Wermutstropfen war für mich, dass der Frühstücksraum etwas überfüllt war (das Hotel war ausgebucht), sodass wir kaum einen Platz bekommen haben. Etwas mehr Personal würde hier auch nicht schaden, diese sind kaum mit dem Abräumen der Tische nachgekommen.",5,2015,07,07

231,Céntrico y muy bien comunicado,"Hotel muy comodo, la habitación amplia y luminosa ( nos toco una exterior). Muy bien insonorizado porque a pesar de tener obras en la calle no so oía ningún ruido.

Desde el hotel puedes ir andando a todos los puntos turísticos de la ciudad.",4,2015,07,02
231,Ottimo hotel in zona centrale,"La posizione dell'hotel è comoda per visitare a piedi la città (Temple bar, Grafton Street, Trynity college...), vicinissime anche le varie fermate dei bus per la periferia e per l'aeroporto, bar e ristoranti nelle immediate vicinanze. 
Le camere sono spaziose, ben insonorizzate, pulite e confortevoli. In camera c'è il bollitore con piccola varietà di the e caffè solubile, phon, ferro e asse da stiro. 
In bagno avevamo una vasca con tenda non proprio nuovissima,  avrei gradito la cuffietta per la doccia visto che il soffione è fisso in alto. Inoltre, come già detto in altre recensioni, il miscelatore basso non miscela l'acqua calda e fredda, ma i due getti d'acqua escono come se fossero separati (nello stesso tempo ti congeli e ti scotti!!)
Noi eravamo in 3 (comodi matrimoniale e lettino).  
Ottima accoglienza alla reception e massima disponibilità. 
Non c'è minibar in camera, ma distributori di bibite e snak e ghiaccio di fronte gli ascensori.
Buonissima, abbondante e varia la colazione: costo 10€ per la colazione irlandese e 6,50€ per la continentale.
Wi-fi funzionante anche usando skype.",4,2015,06,22

La colazione era sia internazionale con buona scelta che irlandese. 
Manca il minibar, ma c'è un distributore di snack e bevande ad ogni piano e la cassaforte in camera, ma la reception è disponibile per ogni richiesta.

L’hotel si presenta in perfetto ordine e probabilmente restaurato da non molto tempo.
La nostra stanza (camera normale prenotata tramite Booking) era spaziosa come anche il bagno e non da sottovalutare era ben isolata acusticamente.
La pulizia e il cambio degli asciugamani sono stati fatti ogni giorno. 
Non abbiamo usufruito del ristorante o del bar ma siamo andati a vederlo e si presenta molto bene.
Da non trascurare, c’è la possibilità di lasciare in deposito le valigie prima del check in o dopo il check out.

El desayuno es a parte, vale unos 10€ y esta muy completo. 
Justo en frente también hay una parada del bus turístico.",3,2015,05,01
231,Un piccolo sforzo e diventerà un grande albergo,"Voglio partire dalle note senz'altro positive. La posizione dell'albergo è estremamente comoda, all'angolo con O'Connell Street e a 10 minuti di cammino da Temple Bar e Grafton Street. Check-in rapidissimo,se non sbaglio effettuato da Jessica Grimley,  sempre sorridente e disponibile a darci subito indicazioni circa i punti di interesse della città. Macchine distributrici di bibite e cibo su ogni piano situate di fronte all'ascensore (sostituiscono la mancanza del minibar in camera).
Ma passiamo alle note negative. La stanza 360 non è dotata di cassaforte, la linea wi-fi libera ti obbliga comunque ad una registrazione con la propria email e molto spesso la connessione cade (quasi la peggiore di Dublino dove ovunque il wi-fi è free) .Ultimo ma forse primo per importanza è il miscelatore basso della vasca da bagno. In tutto il mondo il miscelatore miscela, qui aprendo sia l'acqua fredda che quella calda scende un getto d'acqua diviso a metà, ghiacciata e bollente e quindi impossibile da utilizzare. Si è costretti ad usare il getto della doccia che però è fisso e quindi poco pratico.",3,2015,04,30
231,"centralissimo, pulito, ottima colazione","mi sento di dare un giudizio più che buono per questo hotel! staff veramente gentile, colazione internazionale completa di tutto (e di più, dal salato quale uova con bacon, affettati vari, al dolce, vedi cornetti, marmellate e saccottini al cioccolato,ecc.)e pulizia. le stanze infatti erano veramente comode, con letti altrettanto comodi e complete di angolo 'tè e caffè' con bollitore. Uniche pecche: in bagno c'era una piccola crepa sul muro e la staffa della carta igienica era un po' pendente e connessione wi fi altalenante. Circa la posizione credo sia perfetta, per il semplice fatto che si trova su una via di O connell street, il vialone principale di Dublino nord dove tra l'altro passano le varie linee del bus e quella per l'aeroporto. La zona è inoltre tranquilla e se vi occorre fare la spesa, nell'angolo adiacente troverete lidl e il mercatino durante il giorno.. la via invece parallela a parnell street è Henry street, dove poter fare shopping (zara,topshop,forever 21,penney's,mango,pull and bear,ecc).
Detto ciò consiglio a tutti vivamente questo hotel ! ah, non dimenticate maglioni, sciarpe,cappotti, ombrello...in questo periodo fa molto freddo!!!",4,2015,04,30

In unmittelbarer Nähe gibt es zahlreiche Geschäfte, in denen man alles zu essen und trinken einkaufen kann, auch Restaurants und Pubs sind in der Nähe. Aber auch zu den zahlreichen Pubs im Bereich der Temple Bar ist der Fußweg mit ca. 15 min nicht weit. Wer mit dem Mietwagen anreist, findet in ca. 5 min Gehwegentfernung das ""Clerys Q-Park Multi"" in der Cathal Brugha Street, das einen preisgünstigen Nacht-Tarif für 6 € von 5 pm bis 10 am anbietet.

231,Eccellente soggiorno con la famiglia!,"Io e la mia famiglia abbiamo avuto l'occasione di soggiornare in questo hotel per 4 notti in B&B, 2 stanze matrimoniali al secondo piano. Che dire?

Di fronte all'hotel c'è un Tesco per le piccole spese e lungo la via farmacie, negozi ecc...
Sala colazione ampia e buffet meraviglioso! Tipica Irish Bkf che varia dal dolce al salato: bacon, uova, ecc.. porridge, dolci, pane, cereali, latte e ampia selezione di tè!
Personale della reception e della sala colazione gentilissimo e sempre disponibile. Ad esempio in camera mia e di mia sorella c'erano problemi con il riscaldamento ed eravamo agli inizi di gennaio, ma nessun problema: ci hanno subito fornito dei termosifoni elettrici che hanno riscaldato subito la stanza! 
Camere pulite, moderne e silenziose che davano sul cortile interno.

Posizione ideale per raggiungere tutte le attrazioni in breve tempo (Temple Bar, Trinity), e le vie dello shopping. Sicurezza alta, soprattutto la sera. Camere pulite quotidianamente dal personale di servizio (gentile, il che non guasta mai). Stanze ampie, compreso il bagno. Receptionist disponibili e cordiali anche se li contatti alle 3 di notte per un cambio lenzuolo (tutto vero). Supermercati nelle vicinanze (20 metri), in caso voleste fare uno spuntino economico.

231,Ottima posizione,"Abbiamo scelto questo Hotel in base alle recensioni su trip advisor e hanno soddisfatto appieno le nostre aspettative.
L'Hotel è in un'ottima posizione per visitare Dublino, perfettamente raggiungibile dell'aeroporto.
La  stanza era poco spaziosa ma in compenso molto pulita, letto leggermente piccolo ma io sono un po fuori misura quindi non faccio testo (per fortuna della mia compagna c'era il terzo letto).
Il personale sempre cortese e disponibile, noi non abbiamo usufruito della colazione, ma nelle immediate vicinanze dell'albergo c'è un'ampia offerta per la colazione.
Unico neo è la connessione Wi-Fi decisamente scadente, lenta e che cadeva continuamente, era difficile persino collegarsi alla mail, connessione che era fondamentale considerato che non c'erano canali italiani selezionati sulla tv.
Per il resto ottimo hotel che consiglio.",4,2014,12,06

Armario por llamarlo así es armario sin puertas. Un poco incordio tener que utilizar la tarjeta de la habitación para usar el ascensor, pero también es una medida de seguridad.

231,"Excelente ubicación, habitación normalita y desayuno algo escaso","La ubicación es perfecta, cerca de las zonas principales y de las lineas de autobuses, turístico y, el del aeropuerto. Las habitaciones son normalitas, con una buena cama y almohada, pero con tres escasas baldas para dejar la ropa, eso sí bastante límpio. El cuarto de baño también es bastante normal. El personal del hotel es agradable. Por ponerle alguna pega, para mi gusto el desayuno bastante escaso (dos tipos de bollería mini-crosissants y mini-napolitanas que no eran recientes ), de salado, salchichas, bacon, huevos y revuelto, cereales, algo de macedonia de fruta y yogures. 
En relación al WIFI indicar que si bien te indica que es gratis, no es cierto, ya que yo no pude nada más que recibir emails y whatshapp la primera noche, porque por la mañana, me daba el teléfono un mensaje que para recibir dichos mensajes, debía obtener el Premium al módico precio de 3.-€ diarios. Pero, igual me paso en Dublin, que en los lugares que disponían de Wifi gratis, no tenía posibilidad de recibir y enviar Whatshapp.
Por tanto si no eres exigente con el desayuno, pero quieres un lugar donde descansar calentito en una buena cama y cerca de los lugares más céntricos de Dublin, éste es tu hotel.",3,2014,12,03
231,No está nada mal. Muy céntrico ,"Debo decir que lo reservé online con mucha antelación y cogí una oferta con desayuno incluido que me salió muy económico. El hotel está muy bien situado en la ciudad, a escasos metros de O'Connell St. la calle más importante junto con Temple Bar de Dublin. Las habitaciones están muy bien, con calentador de agua para café y té que también ponen. No se oye ruido de la calle. De las habitaciones de al lado sí, eso tengo que decirlo. Tienen secador, gel y champú en el baño... El desayuno buffet está muy bien, cierto es que los he visto más completos, pero supongo que para desayunar algo antes de patearse la ciudad no está mal. En definitiva, le doy buena puntuación. ",4,2014,12,02

In conclusione si tratta di una buona soluzione per la visita della città , da migliorare l'accoglienza, per il resto tutto ok!",3,2014,12,02
231,"Hotel INN que no esta mal, hotel de paso","Hotel de paso en Dublin. La calidad es de un Inn así que moqueta, decoración lo justito, gimnasio de 3m x 2m… eso sí tienen WIFI gratis en todo el hotel, no solo en el lobby. El desayuno está bien, no es nada del otro mundo pero es mas que correcto. “Tiene” parking, está a unos 5 minutos caminando (Cathal Brugha Street con Marlborough Street). Hay que sellar el ticket del aparcamiento en el hotel y entonces al pasar por la máquina son 10€/24h (el tiempo es el que marque en el ticket).

Las habitaciones están bien, son cómodas pero el servicio es algo mejorable. Puede ser que fuese porque íbamos a estar dos noches (aunque no debería ser así) pero después de la primera noche solo cambiaron las toallas del baño, dejaron tal y como estaba hasta la cortina de la ducha, papeleras y demás, gesto feo por parte de ellos aunque sea lo que yo había ensuciado previamente…",3,2014,11,30
231,Inmejorable.,"Toda vez tienes claro el precio que pagas, que es de lo más ajustado, pasa por aquí a leer esta opinión.

La situación es inmejorable, al principio de la calle Parnell al ladito de O'Connel Street. Tienes todo a tiro de piedra, incluida la parada de taxis o el Aircoach al Aeropuerto. Paradas de Luas... y la mayoría de cosas que ver, a 15 minutos máximo andando.

Aparte de esto, el hotel es bastante nuevo, con un toque moderno. El personal es de lo más amable, y te echa una mano en todo momento, con las indicaciones que necesites.

Dispones de ascensor a las habitaciones, con máquinas de hielo en el pasillo, etcétera. Las habitaciones aún no siendo las más bonitas del mundo cumplen. Sencillas, con el mobiliario que es necesario y con una cafetera por si te apeteciera un té o un cafelito. Quizá lo que menos me gustó fue la pintura, que bueno, era un color extraño. La cama confortable y el descanso sencillamente fantástico.

A diario, aunque tengas el cartel de no molestar, te dejan toallas nuevas. Si tenéis la oportunidad (por un precio realmente ajustado se hace) incluid el desayuno. Es un buffet completísimo que incluye desde Irish Breakfast a tostadas, scones, cereales... etcétera. 

Detalle que me gustó, es que cuando hicimos el checkout, tienen una sala en la que puedes dejar tu equipaje antes de coger el bus mientras te das una vuelta por la ciudad.

Es, a nivel de relación calidad-precio el mejor hotel en el que he estado.",5,2014,11,26

231,Punto debole: la accoglienza !,"Ho utilizzato questo albergo tre volte in cinque anni :oggettivamente è migliorato nella pulizia delle stanze e nei bagni. La prima colazione è abbondante e, a richiesta, adesso fornisce anche pane glutin free.I camerieri sono disponibili e gentili. Unico neo, non da poco, la accoglienza. I recepsionist parlano solo inglese e a noi è anche successo di essere corretti, con una certa sufficienza, per una pronuncia sbagliata.Un terzo circa dei clienti, in agosto, era di italiani; uno sforzo per imparare le quattro parole essenziali in italiano per le operazioni di check in potevano anche farlo.Se va bene sono freddini, proprio loro, i professionisti del ricevimento! Peccato, perchè in genere gli irlandesi sono cordiali e amichevoli.Loro no!",3,2014,08,23
231,Ottima scelta,"Struttura architettonicamente non bella ma molto pulita e curata, moderna negli arredi. Reception estremamente gentili e disponibili, ci hanno permesso di fare il check-in a mezzogiorno e ad ogni domanda hanno risposto con sorrisi e professionalità. Ottima la colazione, più salata che dolce. Puntuale il servizio lavanderia. Te e caffè disponibili in camera, così come un bell'asciugacapelli potente. Molto silenzioso nei corridoi, nonostante fosse pieno! Non in pieno centro, ma poco fuori, noi abbiamo girato tutto a piedi senza problemi. Lo consiglio senza dubbio.",4,2014,08,18
231,In centro,"Ottima posizione a pochi passi dal centro e vicino alle principali attrazioni. Camere nuove e pulite con wi-fi gratuito in camera. Per cena niente di particolare, conviene andare in qualche pub. colazione buona ci sono anche le brioche.",3,2014,08,18
231,Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo,"Nonostante un prezzo accessibile ( 76€/notte) si é rilevato un ottimo hotel con camere sufficientemente spaziose, pulite e moderne. Solamente la hall lascia un po a desiderare è sembra un po ""fredda"" e spoglia. 
Location ottima, ad 1 min da O'Connell Street ed a 10 min da Temple Bar.",4,2014,08,11
231,Esame Superato,"Nonostante le recensioni abbastanza positive, ero abbastanza scettico sul comfort e sulla pulizia di questo hotel. Devo ammettere che sono rimasto sorpreso, il Jury's inn ha superato brillantemente l'esame Andrew. Le camere sono pulite e confortevoli, gli arredi nuovi e gradevoli. Il bagno piccolino ma perfetto. Avevamo prenotato una matrimoniale ma ci hanno dato una tripla, quindi ancora più spazio. Lo staff è molto cordiale (come tutti gli irlandesi d'altronde) e la posizione è perfetta per girare tutta Dublino a piedi. Inoltre nei dintorni è pieno di pub e posti dove poter mangiare. La colazione non l'ho provata perché costava troppo, ma a due passi dall'hotel (20 metri) c'è un buonissimo bar con tante cose buone da mangiare (dai croissant di ogni tipo alle spremute, alla frutta e alle cose salate). Che dire, lo consiglio pienamente.",4,2014,08,09
231,Para tenerlo presente en ocasiones venideras,"Una muy buena localización al lado de la céntrica avenida O'Connell y la peatonal y comercial Henry Street.
Siendo un hotel de tres estrellas, está más cercano a una cuarta que muchos de cuatro.
Buenas habitaciones amplias, excelente limpieza y con un servicio muy correcto.",4,2014,08,06
231,Buon hotel,"Buon hotel,ottimo punto per il centro della città . tutto facilmente raggiungibile receptionist da migliorare. abbastanza disorganizzazione.pulizia ottima ottima colazione
Personale molto gentile sempre a disposizione e molto affabile e mai infastiditi

231,Very Good!,"L'Irlanda è magica, Dublino lo è ancor di più e se trovi un punto di appoggio che ti permette di vivere la città a 360 gradi non si può chiedere di più. Abbiamo trovato questo hotel per caso, senza prenotazione. L'accoglienza è stata ottima, ci hanno assegnato una camera molto carina e nonostante si affacciasse sulla strada principale non abbiamo sentito alcun rumore. Piccola pecca il bagno poco funzionale ma molto pulito. La colazione è ottima e la posizione è perfetta per raggiungere i luoghi di interesse.",4,2014,07,23
231,Bien comunicado,Hemos estado tres días en Dublín en este hotel. Las habitaciones están bien limpias y con todo lo necesario. El hotel en general está bien. Por poner alguna pega el desayuno es pobre y bastante malucho.,4,2014,07,20
