27,The most brilliant staff and location,"I was nervous about coming to Barcelona by myself. All the stories of theft and petty crime on the streets freaked me out a bit. But I wanted to stay close to the Gothic quarter and be able to walk to most places. After eons of research I booked Bagués. So glad I did. Other than being stylish and lovely(and yes rooms are small - they all are in Europe unless you pay gazzilions of dollars) . But I also felt supported by the front of house staff who ALWAYS went out of their way to advise me, get me a taxi, tell me a good local restaurant that was fine to walk home by me. Truly. The thing that help me out my heckles down was the sheer loveliness and decency of the staff. I didn’t book with breakfast as the wonderful market is a block away way and my preference for coffee and empanada on the morning. I thought o would use the pool and roof top. Too good to swim but it’s lovely place to sit. But I only sat there twice. I did enjoy the inside bar for a wine after a night out walking for dinner (and when I say night - I mean I was home at the unSpanish hour and f 8:30pm). I had a room overlook las ramblas. The occasional noise was worth it to have an eagle eyes view of the action. 

As a solo traveller I was welcomed - and helped all the time. Wonderful staff. Can’t say enough good things about them. Also loved the lolly jars at the front . Other than location, quiet and small size of this place - it’s worth it to have staff who help you manage all the travel things. They are worth their weight in good. Thank you.",5,2024,10,07
27,Barcelona Luxury,A very lovely stay in the midst of La Rambla in Barcelona. Had I the time and energy left to indulge in all the hotel has to offer I’m sure it would have been wonderful.  The trade off was getting to see and experience Barcelona. ,5,2023,02,20
27,Great hotel on Las Ramblas,"Great quiet hotel to escape from the hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas. Attentive staff, close to sights, clean rooms and good breakfast. ",5,2024,09,24
27,Simple and elegant.,"My only regret is that we didn't have more time at this hotel. Service is fantastic, the hotel is impeccable, and the location is perfect for tourists eager to get a lot of sightseeing in. We only had one night because we were only flying in and out of Barcelona but we were able to see many sights despite our limited time.  The shower was possibly the best I've ever had. Putting on the soft robe and slippers was a lovely way to spend one last night before a long flight back to North America. 

Despite being right on Les Rambles, we slept well because the soundproofing was excellent. 

The candy at reception was an added bonus!",5,2024,09,12
27,Hotel and staff are great,"I really enjoyed my time at hotel Bagues. Rooms are nice, beds are comfortable, rooftop had great views and staff are amazing. Especially Yusuf, Daniel and Rafael plus Leon at the rooftop bar. 

I did not have breakfast at the hotel, but some of my group did and said it was great. And the cava is good too. 

I would highly recommend.",5,2024,09,10
27,Stay at Hotel Bagues if you can - Wonderful,"Beautiful quite Hotel right in the tourist area but very quiet.  The staff are amazing, so lovely and professional.  The breakfast is cooked on the spot no buffet just lovely fresh food like omelets, fresh orange juice, selection of cold cuts and pastries.  Great coffee and tea",5,2024,09,07
27,Great stay,"Great hotel, ideal staff to take care of guests from arrival to departure. Hotel in an ideal location, you can walk to most of the attractions. Rooms clean, well equipped, good soundproofing. The staff responded immediately to any request. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to visit Barcelona and stay in comfort. I also recommend using the bar and the rooftop bar by the pool.",5,2024,09,06
27,Great hotel if you don’t mind seeing your partner using the loo,"This hotel has many things going for it. The staff are really friendly and super helpful and the location is great. 
But 2 things could be done better. The first is relatively small- there were very few power points in the room ( we eventually found two, hidden behind the TV ) and no USB points. 

The second is very odd: the door to the bathroom is glass and anyone using the loo is visible in much of the room. Why would anyone design a room like this ?",4,2024,09,03
27,Stunning hotel and customer service!,"A beautiful hotel right in the Gothic Quarter. The staff are extremely helpful and gracious, assisting with anything you need and always being at hand. The facilities are excellent. Despite is being on a constantly busy stretch, it is so peaceful and silent inside the hotel walls. You could be anywhere in the world.
Will definitely be staying there again!",5,2024,08,24
27,Great location and quality service,"Great spot in Central Barcelona - close to the market, great restaurants and the waterfront.  Friendly and helpful staff.  ",5,2024,07,29
27,An oasis in La Ramblas,"We booked Hotel Bagues to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and couldn't have been more delighted. There is absolutely nothing negative we can say about this hotel and we have been to many five star hotels over the years.  It truly is a little oasis in the hustle and bustle of La Ramblas. The staff could not do enough for us, always friendly and attentive, and the service and quality of the hotel and rooms was impeccable.  The rooftop pool and bar was the perfect spot to cool down and unwind after a busy day taking in all of the wondrous sights that Barcelona has to offer.  The view from pool was just amazing and not forgetting a special mention to Leon (the bar tender) who made us some amazing cocktails. We opted for the breakfast and it was well worth it. Everything was cooked fresh and to order.  We cannot recommend this Hotel highly enough and would definitely stay here again.  Ignore the few negatives reviews that have been left.  We nearly did not book this Hotel because of a couple of bad reviews. So glad we listened to the positive feedback of other guests as we would not have otherwise found this amazing Hotel.  It certainly met and exceeded all of our expectations. Can't wait to come again. ",5,2024,07,16
27,Fantastic Hotel,"We only stayed one day and night, but it was fantastic. The service was impeccable, the view on the terrace was stunning and the drinks were really high quality. Topped off by a really nice room. One of the best hotels I've stayed in.",5,2024,07,12
27,Fantastic Find in Barcelona,"This was a fantastic find after reading previous reviews. 5 star all the way from check in to check out. Rooms were very modern with excellent views over Las ramblas street and the city from roof top terrace. Breakfast was superb every morning, chosen from menu and cooked to perfection fresh. Excellent central location. Would definitely stay here again when we visit Barcelona",5,2024,06,29
27,Great hotel and a great location!,Right in the middle of everything - yet very quiet and peaceful.  Couldn't ask for anything more!  We really enjoyed the unique nature of the hotel and will definitely be back again.,5,2024,06,17
27,Great location and surprisingly great value!,Couldn’t believe how nice it was. Great staff.  Great rooftop.  Loved everything. A+!  Would do it again in a heartbeat.,5,2024,06,16
27,Absolutely great!,"Jewel-like hotel on the Rambla with perfect sound-proofing and superb service. Beautiful, warm, hospitable. ",5,2024,05,30
27,Hotel Bagués excellent,"Perfectly located in the very heart of Barcelona on La Rambla, this hotel is a jewel. It’s quite luxury at its very best. Exclusive, peaceful with friendly discreet staff. I was truly impressed with the standard of the service and the hotel’s general environment. I will be back. ",5,2024,05,28
27,Best hotel ever!,The best location best rooms best hygiene and very friendly and helpful staff I really recommend it and off course i will stay there in my next trip to Barcelona ,5,2024,05,11
27,Gem of a Hotel,"Nice Little Jewel in the Las Ramblas neighborhood of Barcelona. The hotel is intimate, comfortable and clean. The service is outstanding! The breakfast was the best scrambled eggs I’ve ever had. They look out for you and take care of you here. Barcelona is the city that does not sleep in April so just remember if you’re annoying sensitive to bring earplugs!",5,2024,04,17
27,Very good place to stay in Barcelona,"I suspect that I will stay here again on a return to Barcelona. The hotel has a fabulous position on La Rambla, and is efficiently run, super-friendly, clean and comfortable. Full marks.

I very much liked the free mini bar in the room, and especially the complimentary large bottle of water. The shower was good, there was a good range of bathroom amenities and the towels and robes were of excellent quality. 

The roof terrace was a great place to relax, and drinks were a phone call away.

Things I didn’t like so much included the absence of hair conditioner in the shower; the shampoo-conditioner combination on offer was not that brilliant. Some of the recess lighting under the shower surround in room 502 was coming off. And there was a lack of bedside sockets to plug in devices; there needs to be at least one easily-accessible socket at table height on each side of the bed. I would also avoid the rooms next to the lifts, which make clunking noises whenever they stop at a floor.",4,2024,04,08
27,"Great staff, great location, beautiful hotel.","We stayed here for 5 nights in March. It was a perfect location.  We walked almost everywhere. The Gothic quarter, Las Rambles, and the market were at our doorstep.  The staff was so nice and helpful.  The decor and atmosphere was nice and calming.  ",5,2024,03,31
27,Wonderful stay,"Wonderful hotel in a great location. Staff was very friendly, rooms were very nice and they came with a pillow menu! 5/5 and would happily stay here again. Breakfast was wonderful and our eggs were perfectly cooked every day.  ",5,2024,03,29
27,Perfect location and wonderful service,"Location of the hotel is perfect to explore the city.
The hotel and the rooms are beautifully designed. Staff and service are exceptionally friendly, pro-actively helpful and professional.
My room had no desk to work on which was the only improvement I recommended in my review. But a lovely chaise longue to relax.
I will book there again when I come back to Barcelona.",5,2024,03,22
27,Barcelona magic,"Top notch hotel located on Las Rambles. Steps from the Gothic Quarter, shopping, restaurants and attractions. Quaint hotel with old world charm and modern conveniences. Smaller rooms, but well appointed. Very comfortable beds, with superior linens, and pillows. The rooftop pool and deck offers excellent views and a great spot to relax and unwind after a busy day of sight seeing. 5 star property in the heart of Barcelona. ",5,2024,03,09
27,Great spot on La Rambla,"The hotel was spotless with a very cool decor. The staff was what really set it apart. Friendly, knowledgable, and very helpful. Location is great and close to everything.
The glass door to the bathroom may be an issue for some couples, but the bathroom itself was really nice. ",5,2024,03,04
27,Perfect location in the most central place of the city!,Thank You for your hospitality. The breakfast and service was excellent. No noice from outside in our room on the fourth floor. Very central location in an historic building. The terrace gives you a beautiful view over the city!,5,2024,02,25
27,A wonderful break in Barcelona,"The location is amazing on the Rambla right next to La Bouqueria Market close to all the sights 
however still quiet and relaxing
The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. 
The hotel was exceptionally clean a small luxury boutique hotel perfect for couples 
Highly recommended for anyone looking for a special place in Barcelona ",5,2024,02,25
27,"Wonderful little boutique hotel smack dab in the middle of everything, we walked everywhere","Front desk staff was exceptional, breakfast was a little lacking ( from an American/ Hyatt ) but still good.  Wish our trip was a little longer.  IT’s location was incredible….. a short walk to ANYTHING",5,2024,02,19
27,Beautiful hotel,Lovely hotel in the heart of the city. Excellent staff in all departments. We had a comfortable bed with our choice of pillows in a lovely and clean well appointed room with a small balcony overlooking La Rambla. Hope to stay here again!,5,2024,02,08
27,The best staff at a lovely hotel,"I've never written a hotel review before, but the staff at the Hotel Bagues was so delightful, I had to take the time. I've never received such lovely, personal, warm service at a hotel before. Top notch! The room was lovely, as well, and the location so convenient. Thanks!",5,2024,01,26
27,The best hotel & staff,"If you’re ever travelling to Barcelona, Hotel Bagues is the place to go. Staff was amazing and likewise was the hotel. It was my first time travelling alone, and i felt very much at home while staying here. I can’t wait to come back to Barcalona and especially Hotel Bagues.",5,2024,01,26
27,Amazing Amazing Amazing !!!,"This was my first trip to Barcelona, and it took me a while to figure out where I should stay. I’m so happy that i chose Hotel Bagues. The service was amazing and the same with my room. I can’t wait to come back!!!❤️",5,2024,01,24
27,The little pearl on the Rambla,"The real five stars on the Rambla.A carefully restored historical building in the center of Barcelona.Attentive and caring staff.A comfortable bed.Very high quality bed linen and towels.The only thing I couldn't figure out was the air conditioning control system.In general, I highly recommend it and plan to stay there in the future",5,2024,01,23
27,8.8,"The best the service, as for the Hotel I only missed a desk in my room, perhaps would be more useful  instead of the sofa. Location is perfect, despite being in a very central area the noise it's perfectly isolated. I would consider the hotel fore a next stay.",4,2024,01,19
27,"Best hotel in Barca, even while it's on the Rambla","The staff (from doormen to management) is friendly, professional, and very helpful; no matter what the request.

Even though it's located on La Rambla, but once inside you don't hear any noise or party people.

It's surprising how this 5-star hotel has these prices, because most hotels are less and on a lesser location.

Finally the location is perfect. You're exactly in the middle of the harbor/beach and city center. If you don't want to go far in the evening, you can stroll on La Rambla and all the nice places around it.",5,2024,01,03
27,The best staff and quaint hotel,Wonderful and friendly staff. Very cute hotel with well accommodated rooms. Loved the rooftop view of the skyline and proximity to the boqueria market where we enjoyed so many local foods. Easy to walk to all the cute shopping areas and the waterfront markets.  ,5,2023,12,30
27,Boutique hotel,Boutique hotel with great location. Attention to detail in all and overall an excellent experience. Location near the market with lots of excellent food. Walking distance to many tourist spots and to the gothic quarter.  ,5,2023,11,29
27,Great location with exceptional staff,Conveniently located this small hotel has exceptional staff who go over and beyond to ensure a great experience. The breakfast buffet offered a large array of items including made to order hot foods. We would definitely recommend this hotel. ,5,2023,11,23
27,"Fantastic boutique hotel in the heart of downtown, bustling Barcelona.  ","This is a wonderfully chic boutique hotel and it's situated in a perfect location... right on La Ramblas across the street from the Gothic Quarter (Old Town), practically next door to La Boqueria market and 1 block from the metro.  Aside from the excellent locale... what stands out at this hotel is it's great and friendly staff.  At the front desk, both Roxanne and Augustina, were absolutely personable, helpful, and attentive to our needs.  They provided advice on places to see and eat.  They were very accommodating with helping us confirming our day trips and restaurant reservations.  The rest of the staff was also very nice and the room was great and well maintained.  Gorgeous place to stay at for a few nights!  ",5,2023,11,19
27,Great location,"Great hotel, probably one of the best location in Barcelona. Nice and friendly staff. The room and the bed are comfortable, interesting and impressive interior design. The breakfast is delicious, but the selection could be improved.  Highly reccomended",5,2023,11,09
27,Oasis in the Maelstrom,"The second we entered the Hotel Bagues… the sounds from Las Ramblas disappeared. Calm was the order of the day!
After explaining the benefits of the hotel our bags were whisked away as our room wasn’t ready yet… it was 1130 am at the time. 
We had time to do a little sightseeing before our room was ready. 
Our room overlooked Las Ramblas but we could barely hear the sounds. Comfortable bed.. pillows galore…nice all around. 
The rooftop bar was really special with great views. 
Hotel Bagues was very convenient for walking to Cayaluna and Metro stops. ",5,2023,11,07
27,"Authentic, warm and welcoming","We stayed here from October 10-14 in room 203, a double deluxe room. We absolutely loved our time here and in Barcelona and wish we had spent more time. 

Upon check-in, we were greeted by a bellhop and 2 front deskmen, all exceptionally welcoming and enthusiastic to welcome us into a special place. We were seated, given a glass of bubbly and given an extensive overview of the city. The staff member helping us had excellent recommendations and was knowledgeable about things that were open or temporarily shut down. For a trainee, he was quite good at his job.

The room. OK, I've read reviews about how the rooms are small. Yes, they are small, but they provide accurate information on their website without sugar-coating it. The room was beautiful with the wood panels, the piece of art enclosed in glass, and the wraparound balcony of Las Ramblas and the Cathedral. The soundproofed glass and blackout curtains came in handy. The distressed leather daybed/sofa was so comfortable while reading a book on it. The bed was on the firm side with the pillows just right. The bathtub was just deep enough. The rose was a nice touch.

The pool and terrace were never busy. We had cocktails served by a very attentive bartender. We took a dip in the pool which was about 5 feet deep or so. It was narrow, but again, the hotel doesn't hide that: just look at the pictures.

I loved this hotel because it felt very authentic to Spain and independent of a chain or brand hotel. It felt like you were in a museum but also home by the way the staff treated you. I hope it feels the same way for you.",5,2023,10,20
27,The staff makes all the difference,"I travel alone often, and this was my favorite place to stay! I felt like family and loved all the beautiful details. The rooms are small but have everything you need and more. Fresh flowers, every product from lotion to slippers. Special thanks to Thor, Augustina, and Soungalo. I will be back in Barcelona!!",5,2023,10,20
27,Honeymoon,The hotel does not communicate the small size of the rooms and their unwillingness to allow a couple in a room. And there was no willingness or compasion to help us find a solution.I would never recommend this hotel.,1,2023,10,12
27,Terrific Experience,"We stayed at the hotel at the end of an almost three week sojourn through Spain.   Upon arrival we found the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful and made us feel very comfortable from the start.   Although the rooms were small, they were well appointed and I did not feel that we were wanting for anything.   The front desk was quick and responsive, whether it came to dinner reservations or delivery of anything to our room.   The roof top bar was nice in the evening (big shout out to the awesome bartender Leon!) and the views were great.   The hotel is in the middle of it all and is convenient to what ever you'd desire.",5,2023,10,04
27,"Great staff, Very nice hotel","Staff is fantastic, I can’t say enough about them. Room is expectedly small for a European hotel in a great location to walk Barcelona. Only couple negatives were the toilet being far too tall for comfort and the pillows too hard. The walls/windows do a great job of keeping out the noise from the busy street below. Full breakfast is included for Hyatt members, which was a nice surprise. Would definitely stay here again ",4,2023,09,28
27,Hotel Bagues is FABULOUS ,"Can’t strongly enough recommend this hotel. Perfect location; fantastic helpful staff; upscale, clean, and very comfortable rooms; delicious breakfast; gorgeous rooftop. Easy to arrive from/to the airport as well as cruise port. ",5,2023,09,27
27,Baguès Hotel 5*,"A truly magnificent 5* Boutique Hotel. My daughter and I shared a room on the third floor with views out onto the main busy street. The hotel is quiet but perfectly located in the Gothic quarter of this vibrant city. The rooftop bar and pool are perfect for a city break. Fabulous bar manager from the uk! All the staff are very friendly and helpful. Comfortable beds, bed linen and White Company products. We shall return and highly recommend to others. ",5,2023,09,14
27,Luxury small hotel,"A beautiful hotel in the heart of the city, where the movement and life. The hotel is small but luxurious and the service is excellent. 
It has a small pool and a bar on the roof with a beautiful view of the city. A hotel worth visiting.

Close to everything, where restaurants and markets are near it.",5,2023,08,24
27,Best Boutique Hotel,"We stayed for two nights that were so wonderful we felt in love with the place. Their staff is the most cordious and friendly as you can get. Congratulations to all the team involved in running that hotel, you made our stay positively memorable !",5,2023,08,11
27,Nice stay in Barcelona,"Excellent location (city center on the Rambla avenue, very close to Plaça de Catalunya) with easy access to restaurants, shops and entertainment. Very pleasant boutique hotel (30 rooms) with nice and caring personnel and efficient room service. The superior room was relatively small, the queen size bed also quite small for tall persons, pillows were too soft/uncomfortable and we really regretted the lack of smart TV. Even if the room was oriented towards the noisy Ramblas, the windows were efficiently protecting from the outside noise. However, the room is not correctly isolated from the inside noise (hallway). The bathroom was nice (no bath).",4,2023,07,21
27,Could have been done better for all matters ,"Advertising the hotel as a 5 stars hotel, thus, my expectation was quite high. Leave the hotel location aside, understand Pros and cons, however, front office staff could put more smiles on their faces. Room decoration could have been done better. The toilet bowl could have been installed lower than it is now. More importantly, the towel should have been checked prior to preparing it in the guest room.  ",3,2023,07,15
27,A botique gem!,What a great find! This botique hotel is a great location where you can walk to anything. The checkin was easy and they stored our bags until our room was ready. The rooms themselves were lovely and clean. The bathroom towels were huge! Rooftop bar with pool was a nice touch…good place to relax for a drink. Everyone was very kind and the service was excellent. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. ,5,2023,07,13
27,Outstanding Hotel,"Bagues Barcelona is an outstanding boutique hotel on the bustling La Rambla in the heart of the old city. The bellman (tall black man, I did not catch his name but he was ever-present and so kind and helpful with my young kids), front desk staff, and breakfast staff were outstanding. The included breakfast was wonderful. The design and the rooms at the hotel are superb and quite despite all the action going on outside. It is perfectly located and was a true treat for our family. The rooftop pool has unrivaled views of the city. We love Hotel Bagues!",5,2023,07,12
27,Far From Five Stars,"Not having been in Barcelona for quite some time and not knowing Hotel Bagues (or other Derby Hotels), we did a lot of homework and read a ton of TripAdvisor and other reviews before choosing the hotel for a 3-day stay in late June 2023.  Sadly, we were sorely disappointed by our decision.

I don't know what it takes to be a 5-star hotel in Barcelona, but, from our experience at Hotel Bagues, the rating system there is meaningless. Virtually everything about this hotel was subpar. For starters, though external noise isn't much of an issue, the noise inside the hotel is an acoustical engineer's (and guest’s) worst nightmare -- all of the surfaces in the hotel are hard, making it incredibly noisy at all hours. Due to the open architecture (however attractive it may be, in concept), there is no escaping the noise of the elevators/hallway/other floors/doors. Although we were in a ""superior"" room, it was as far from that as you can get.  Cramped, poorly maintained by housekeeping and whoever was responsible for refilling the supposedly ""free"" mini-bar offerings (not housekeeping we were told), the experience of the rooms was made even worse by towels and bathrobes that were so worn, scratchy and frayed that it seemed like they'd been in constant use for most of the last 20 years.  

The lackadaisical approach to the hotel's atmosphere and amenities carried over to some of its staff (the bellman who assisted us to our room during check-in was excellent).  Basic requests (e.g., for extra towels/hangers or fresh milk for coffee instead of delivering more pre-packaged cream) were simply ignored.  The hotel’s “assistance” with things outside the hotel was similarly problematic. 

The hotel’s front desk made a dinner reservation for us at a restaurant that has two locations, and told us which location to go to.  Upon arriving at the address provided, we discovered that the hotel had directed us to the wrong location, requiring us to spend another 30 minutes to get to the other location (at a considerably greater distance from the hotel).  When we finally arrived at the correct location, we sent an email to the hotel to let them know what had happened, expecting some kind of acknowledgment about the error.  None came.  When we got back to the hotel, we received a perfunctory greeting wishing us a good evening.  When we mentioned what had happened and the email we had sent, the staff noted that they had seen the email, but acknowledged nothing about their error or the inconvenience it caused us.  

While each of these shortcomings standing alone was relatively minor, the cumulative effect was terrible.  These are just a few examples, but there were sadly several more disappointing moments that overshadowed what the hotel got right. 

This simply wasn’t a five-star experience.  With so many great hotels to choose from in Barcelona, we would not place our trust in Hotel Bagues (or any other Derby hotel) again. 
",1,2023,07,06
27,A well-placed jewellery box,"A small but very cosy, sophisticated hotel with attentive staff, in one of the best parts of town, which is crowded and full of people at night, but the soundproofing in the room is first class, with the windows closed, no noise filters in at all.",5,2023,07,04
27,Great for couples,We went on our honeymoon and the staff was very nice and helpful. The rooms were great and clean. The location is perfect as there are plenty of shops and restaurants around. Go to the rooftop and there is a nice pool with great views.,5,2023,06,29
27,Room without daylight,"In pictures very nice hotel, but the room number 103 does not have a window with daylight. Such a room should not be offered in a 5-star hotel. My dog has a room with a window and daylight. There was no service on the terrace by the pool in the evening time. I will choose another hotel next time.",1,2023,06,25
27,I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE.,"Probably the worst service I have ever experienced and this is supposed to be a five star hotel.
We paid around 250 €/night for a room with a city view. The hotel also sell room facing the backyard and these are cheaper per night.
We arrive at the hotel and get a room with absolutely no city view, and hardly any daylight at all. When calling the reception we get the answer they do not have any other rooms (!?). No excuse what so ever. Why selling expensive rooms with a specific view if they do not exist!? I am so disappointed and I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE.
After a lot of arguing with the staff we got another room with a little bit of daylight (very small window). Apparently they had more rooms after all… The new room did not have a city view and it was definitely NOT the room we have paid for.
The way the staff handle the situation is not the expected service of a five star hotel.
All the staff blamed the manger and said they could not to anything about the situation. Maybe it’s too much to ask that the staff of a five star hotel would be able to handle a, to me, simple situation like this OR at least (!!) come with an excuse. I love Barcelona but next time I will chose another hotel for sure.

When checking out I said I am very unhappy with my stay, but again I got no excuse or compensation.",1,2023,06,13
27,Not what to expect from a five star hotel,"Booked a room with city view. It was very clear on hotels.com (photos and descriptions). Got one dark interior room (=no city view). I made a call to reception, they asked me to send printscreens (!) of the booking. It was not enough… they also wanted me to translate it. After they realised that we had a reservation for a room with city view they sent us to another room (“but you can not expect a city view but some daylight anyway”). They take no responsibility and complains that we booked the same day. 

Okey, more to expect from a five star hotel.",2,2023,06,12
27,Nice hotel in the middle of Barcelona,"Really goodnhotelnin the middle of Barcelona.
Friendly staff and very helpfull.
The only negativ was the missing window in our room (406) - so it was not really comfortable because no fresh air and dark inside",4,2023,05,28
27,Great Location. Great Hotel.,"Can’t recommend this hotel enough. Spent 5 nights there and wished we had stopped longer. Located very close to the market and close to the Gothic Quarter. Staff were fantastic, enthusiastic and welcoming. ",5,2023,04,21
27,Best in Barcelona downtown,"Overall service is excellent, helpful and friendly staff, room is clean and bed is comfortable. Breakfast is really good, stunning view in rooftop! Location is really convenience centre of downtown! Many restaurants and shopping areas nearby! Highly recommend! ",5,2023,04,17
27,Five star service at a diamond of a hotel,"My wife and I went for a very short trip to Barcelona and chose this hotel at random . What a great choice and a good bit of luck!
Firstly it's location was perfect for us - right on Las Ramblas. Very central. We took the Aerobus from the airport which stopped at Plaça de Catalunya a short distance away from Las Ramblas and obviously our hotel
We were welcomed by friendly staff and given a welcome drink.
Our room was comfortable and clean and had free drinks in the mini bar; free coffee nespresso machine, a big bed and lots of pillows!
There was a very good breakfast choice and you were made to feel like royalty by Max the breakfast waiter -  who was always cheerful. 
The desk staff were very helpful with tips about local food, travelling , booking tickets...

Fully a five star service.
We will definitely go again to Barcelona and hopefully be able to stay again at this lovely diamond of a hotel.",5,2023,03,28
27,Impeccable ! Just stay here!,"An impeccable stay! The hotel is situated right in the heart of La Rambla, with easy access to everything!  From the moment we walked in the staff made our stay enjoyable! The rooms are well equipped and big by European standards.  However , the staff is the shining star of this property!  They were so friendly and accommodating ! Especially Nickolas at the front desk, Max the server who made the BEST cappuccino and S the doorman who smiled and made it easy for us to get transport! Can’t wait to come back!",5,2023,03,21
27,Another great stay,Another great stay at hotel bagues.  If you love boutique hotels you will love it here and you cannot beat the location .  Ambiance is great and service was impeccable.  Rooftop was an added bonus to take a break from busy days to relax and have a bottle of wine above la rambla and take in the view.,5,2023,02,28
27,One of the best hotel staff,"We were there for business, amazing staff, very kind, welcoming and helpful, great location, great value for money, very clean, nice breakfast. Will definitely stay here again. Highly recommending the hotel.",5,2023,02,11
27,Overall great place and awesome staff but construction noises hampered our ability to rest,I asked reception to please speak to management to find a fair solution to compensate us for two days of construction that we dealt with in the unit above us which disrupted our stay. She said she would speak to the manager but never got back to me with a resolution. I even waited until we checked out and nothing was ever mentioned. I really loved the hotel and overall kindness of the staff but when you can't sleep for two days due to construction noise above you it makes you wonder what the point of paying extra is for a 5 star hotel. Furthermore in the future just tell the guest it's an ongoing issue instead of saying there was some emergency repairs that imply the issue would be resolved the same day.,3,2023,02,06
27,Beautiful boutique hotel,Had an amazing experience at the hotel. Staff was very friendly and specifically Adrian Bundi from the bar was an amazing host. My colleague and I traveling for business relaxed and ended the day with a drink and some laughs. ,5,2023,02,03
27,Would stay again in a heartbeat,"Excellent property. The location is really fantastic. Central to sights, walking distance to great neighborhoods and close to public transit. The staff were extremely friendly, helpful, and responsive if we had any issues. The rooms were a decent size for European standards. The view from our room was a pretty, baroque church. ",5,2023,01,30
27,A real gem,"Great location mid Ramblas. Gorgeous small hotel with fantastic staff. Really helpful and friendly, good tips for getting around the city or places to eat.
Room was stylish and comfortable; minor issue was that our only full length mirror was in the room entryway with very poor lighting.
Would visit again- in summer, to enjoy the rooftop pool!",5,2023,01,28

27,December in Barca,"The location and the staff made the stay worth the money. 
Very service minded staff who served at any time of the day/night. The environment of the hotel was very calming and original. We recommend Hotel Bagues!",4,2022,12,17
27,"Bedbugs at Hotel Bagues, Barcelona","BEWARE OF THIS HOTEL - IT HA S BEDBUGS IN THIS SUPPOSEDLY 5 STAR HOTEL

 My daughter was badly bitten by bedbugs which were infested in the mattress.  We have pictures of the bloody bites.  Management was totally uncooperative.  Grudgingly changed our room, but denied the charge even after seeing the evidence.",1,2022,12,14
27,Hotel Bagues in Barcelona!!!,"What a great hotel to stay at in the Gothic Quarters.  Felt safe, felt appreciated AND ALL of the staff was kind, helpful and patient, helping my wife and I with anything we were trying to do, even calling and making reservations for us for things in the area to do.  I highly recommend this hotel if you are trying to stay in the Gothic Quarters in Barcelon and we will be back to stay here someday again!",5,2022,12,13
27,Loved this hotel,"Beautiful hotel with incredible staff in central location. Walk to everything. Coffee, bottled water and other drinks were welcome amenities. Breakfast was excellent, though a bit expensive. Staff went out of their way to help at every turn. Loved staying here.",5,2022,12,05
27,Good location and helpful staff .,"I stayed in Hotel Bagues earlier this month, the staff were friendly and helpful, I arrived very early in the morning, they checked me in immediately, of course at an extra fee, but I was grateful nevertheless. I was given a very dark room that doesn’t allow any light at all, at any time, you can’t tell if it is night or day, I asked to change the room and they obliged the next day (I was staying 7 nights).
Location is great, near lot of attractions, Plaça de Catalunya, La Rambla, markets, museums and all. They have good room service, and again staff very nice and helpful. In general I enjoyed my stay there and would go again, but to a much brighter room with more sunlight next time.",3,2022,11,29
27,Wonderful Hotel on the La Rambla,"This is a small luxury hotel directly on the upper end of the Rambla that has excellent rooms, personalized breakfast including all your favorite specialy coffees made to order and fantastic service.  I rate this a 5-star hotel comfortable enough for even spoiled Americans.  We thouroughly enjoyed our 4 day visit!",5,2022,11,15
27,Nice looking place. Left property will not be accounted fo,"Beautiful hotel, right on la rambla. Easy walking distance to many locations. Good food near by along with lots of shopping. Helpful receptionist when it comes to showing locations however, if you leave stuff in the room after checkout you will not see your stuff again. Really disappointed because I left two jackets in the closet and the front desk and housekeeping said they didn’t find anything. Make sure you double check all your belongings before checking out because you’re items will not be returned to you.",3,2022,11,14
27,Great Hotel in Barcelona,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Bagues. The room was spacious enough, with a walk-in entrance way and a very comfortable and updated bathroom. Although we had windows on 2 sides - and looked directly out at La Rambla - we heard no street noise at night. We were just a block from the wonderful La Mercado de Bocaria, and walking distance from almost everything else we did while in Barcelona. I absolutely would stay again.",5,2022,10,31
27,"Perfect location, accommodations, and service","Hotel Bagues in located in La Rambla, the center of where you'd want to stay in Barcelona, and is a boutique hotel that caters to all of its guests. We had the most incredible stay and would recommend Hotel Bagues to those who value cleanliness, location, and top-notch service.",5,2022,10,28
27,Elegant hotel-Amazing stff,"This hotel is stunning from the room to the lobby to the rooftop bar. I need to give special recognition to David & Doun ( can't find the paper he wrote his name on, I'm sorry). We showed up on Oct. 12 frazzled by 8 am. David & Doun literally took over our problems, retrieved our reservation, offered us a cup of coffee, told us to go enjoy the city, they took care of our luggage & called us when the room was available. We were obviously early. Doun(sp?) also came outside with us to assist in hailing a cab. These 2 gentlemen went above & beyond, and we're grateful. All the staff were wonderful, but these 2 stand out. Thank you.",5,2022,10,22
27,Top Boutique Hotel in Central Location,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel Bagues. The staff was warm and helpful from the minute we checked in to when we checked out. We always felt safe and comfortable. The lobby is small but the design is lovely, and the breakfast buffet in the morning was generous. The rooms are typically small but the bed was very comfortable and was surprisingly quiet for being on such a busy thoroughfare. Even the air-conditioning was quiet. The rooftop bar was gorgeous at sunset and a nice place for a drink before heading out in the evening.",5,2022,10,20
27,Most amazing  rooftop hotel in the centre of Barcelona,"Myself and my wife stayed here in the summer for a 4 night break and it was undoubtedly one of the best, if not the best, hotels we have ever stayed in.  

Location wise it was perfect.  Situated right in the centre of La Rambla, minutes from La Boqueria market, we couldn’t have asked for a more conveniently located hotel. 

Design wise the place was stunning, beautiful breathtaking staircase,  amazingly designed bedroom with a balcony overlooking La Rambla, the place oozed class and was worthy of its 5 star rating. 

The staff were amazing. Their attention to detail, friendly manner and total professionalism was exemplary and the owners should be proud of each and everyone of them. 

The highlight for us though was the rooftop bar. The most amazing views and the perfect cocktails. The barman was so skilled in the art of creating cocktails that it was a must have at the end of a busy day in beautiful Barcelona. 

Will we be back.  Most certainly.  Hasta la vista!",5,2022,10,20
27,"Bad service, not a five star or even 4","Upon check in I had a discrepancy with what price I was told over the phone. I was told when I got back I could speak with the manager as the price I was told was about $100 more in total for 4 nights. I even showed them how in booking.com it was $180 less. 
When I got back to the hotel they said the manager is not in and the price is set and nothing can be changed. I was only asking for what I was promised and not even $180 less. They got my money and seemed to care less about our travel dilemma. So far bad service  for a 5 star hotel.",1,2022,10,06
27,Class in the heart of la rambla,An excellent boutique hotel close to literally everything. Very fun modern funky interior. Attentive staff and great accomodations. The bar on the roof is an excellent way to unwind after seeing the city all day and before heading out for dinner. In fact watching the bartender make sangria was an art form. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly whether it was getting a can or handling dinner reservations.  Would absolutely stay here again!,5,2022,10,05
27,"fine boutiquehotel in the center of the old town, right next to the famous market hall - mercat de sant josep -","friendly welcome, excellent, very nice and helpful staff, we immediatly felt most welcome. 
when entering our suite, however, we were a little disappointed, as this had a great terrace with jacuzzi, but was inside much too small to call itself a suite …
someone for whom the size of the room is irrelevant and who is not sensitive to noise, finds here an excellent place in front, which is a real highlight due to the central location and an outdoor pool on the seventh floor next to the rooftopbar. 
",3,2022,10,04
27,5 star in Barcelona,"Great location, beautiful boutique Hotel and the staff were amazing.  Not had such a great sleep for a long time. Will definitely look forward to a return visit.
The rooftop pool and bar is also a great place to just chill ",5,2022,09,25
27,Nice boutique property in prized tourist area,"Good:
- excellent, friendly staff
- smartly decorated room
- everything is just nice and polished
- balcony opens out to La Rambla
- despite balcony on La Rambla, the room was quiet (and our stay included a Friday)
- i loved the candy in the lobby, haha
-great location for gothic quarter and the like

Bad:
- Room is a bit small, but we were at the lowest price point, so not unexpected",5,2022,09,10
27,Great hotel in a great location for sightseeing,"A good location just a few blocks from the final drop-off point for the Aero Bus from the airport.

It is directly on La Rambla, which can be noisy and crowded, but hey, it's a tourist destination in a tourist town. Luckily, our room's windows were very good and sealed out all of the normal noise, with only the occasional 3am drunken yelling-type of noise or thundering trash truck disturbing our sleep. Hallway and elevator noise were also present, in a normal kind of way. 

The staff was great from start to finish and extremely helpful. 

A large bottle of water and a number of other drinks were complimentary and replaced each day (also Nespresso capsules), which was a nice surprise. Air conditioning and hot water were both excellent. Our room had a shower with tub, which functioned very well but needed a grab bar to avoid potential falls. 

The rooftop is a pleasant place to sit and enjoy the great view or soak in the narrow pool, and it is serviced as needed by a bartender or food service. 

My elderly parents also stayed in a room down the hall from ours for a portion of our stay, and they were treated beautifully and had no trouble getting about in the hotel, despite their poor mobility.

I would definitely stay there again.",5,2022,08,25
27,Amazing stay,"Amazing location, right amongst the busy La Rambla. Rooms offer an exclusive and tranquil feel. The staff were all excellent, and offered some fantastic local advice about restaurants and other attractions to visit. A beautifully unique hotel. ",5,2022,08,23
27,A secret worth sharing in central Barcelona ,"Located on Las Rambla this hotel is exceptional with incredibly helpful staff who make the difference. Spotlessly clean well appointed room, great bar, intimate dining room and a roof top bar and pool. Perfect for couples. Great value for money.",5,2022,08,20
27,A 3 stars hotel. Bad service. Small,Good location but it's not a 5 stars hotel. Service at the desk was not nice. We got the rooms too late although we were offered an early check in. The rooms are very small. The balcony is not really a balcony but a window. Gym and pool were the smallest I've ever seen. The location however is great in the center of La Rambla but you can find better hotels around,2,2022,08,16
27,Excellent Hotel in a perfect location,"Perfect location, wonderfully helpful staff.  Room was very clean and surprisingly roomy.  We used the rooftop desk every night we were there.  Though the hotel itself is small (not uncommon in Barcelona), we didn’t find anything lacking.  There’s a small gym in the basement and the staff arranged for massage therapists to come and work out our air travel knots.",5,2022,08,11
27,Sunny Stay,"Great hotel at the heart of Barcelona. Very friendly staff, specifically Noud @ reception. People are being extremely helpful. Overall a fantastic stay.

Small improvements could be made to the wifi and the room access cards.",5,2022,08,04
27,Totally recommend,"The hotel has great location and fantastic customer service.  The hotel is small, so early check in might not be available.  But once inside, the service is excellent!

The roof top patio is nice and intimate.  But I prefer the lobby bar because of the atmosphere!",5,2022,08,01
27,An absolute dream,"My sister and I chose this hotel to stay in as part of my 30th birthday celebrations and we were not disappointed. The interior is incredibly chic, the decor very elegant and the roof terrace was so devine.

The customer service we received here was impeccable, I am saddened that I did not take everyone's names to do a shoutout. First and foremost, Irene is just great vibes. She made us feel welcome from the get go, she is very knowledgeable about the local area and was able to give us some great tips re where to eat/visit/sight see. She also quite literally helped us with every request we had. Richard and the lovely guys in the roof terrace who make the best drinks, made us feel so welcome and of course, the housekeepers were so lovely. 

Hotel Bague, I don't know what your secret is but your staff mix is incredible. I hope to come again in the near future. Thank you all",5,2022,07,02
27,Best staff & hotel,"Such outstanding service my sister and I received here. The hotel is so beautiful, the rooms, the rooftop to the decor details in this place are immaculate! Not to mention the staff are amazing!! 10/10 service. I’ve never in my life encountered such friendly and welcoming staff which made our stay in Barcelona 100x better. Shoutout to Irene for being super warm and welcoming from when we first came in, she was so polite and helped us with travel suggestions for night out experiences and places to eat. Richard was so helpful & lovely  aswell for helping me with my balloons to surprise my sister. The housekeeper was also so professional & lovely. Would recommend this hotel to anyone! Will definitely be back again :)",5,2022,07,01
27,Work Incentive Trip to Barcelona,"8 of us stayed at the Hotel Bagues, friendly staff, very comfortable rooms and a great roof terrace/pool.  Location was excellent, central in La Rambla and it proved to be a very good base for us over the weekend.  ",5,2022,06,20
27,Very poor experience,"The hotel is located in a great area firstly. I had booked for three nights. They took a hold of the first night which is totally acceptable and when I arrived I was asked to pay the full amount on check in not check out which I’ve never had before. They were asking for the full amount not even taking off the first night they had already taken. 

I then had to cancel my stay for two nights due to a cancelled flight and had to get another flight out so could only stay for one. They refused to let me cancel two nights and made me pay in full for two night even though I could only stay for one.  It cost £640 for one night in the end. For all I know they sold the room on the other nights. I think it’s an absolute disgrace and never had an issue like this before - it just showed all they care about is your money and not you as a customer. 

The room was nice to be fair but very small.",2,2022,06,18
27,Perfect Boutique Hotel Experience,"My wife and I stayed here and loved every second of it. The best part is the very friendly and attentive staff. We thoroughly enjoyed their attentiveness and friendly personalities. The rooms are very nice and have beautiful views of the busy street below. While it's a very busy street, when the balcony door is closed, you cannot hear any of the noise. The rooftop pool and bar are a gorgeous reprieve from the city below, you'll love the views. I cannot recommend this place enough, you will not be disappointed!",5,2022,06,09
27,Supremely helpful staff!! ❤️ A wonderful hotel!!,"The nicest, most gracious, helpful, attentive staff!! Hotel Bagués is a wonderful hotel all-around, with comfortable, clean rooms, a fantastic location, great room / bathroom appointments, but it is the staff that deserve the highest praise and our heart-felt appreciation: every single one of them is supremely kind, generous and professional! ❤️😊

We are here for 10 days and hope to come back for 10 more soon! 🥰",5,2022,06,07
27,Great Location; Excellent and Helpful Staff; Very Nice Room,"My wifed and I stayed here for one night prior to a cruise and were happy we did. Located on the busy Los Ramblas, it is a peaceful haven. Close to the La Boqueria Market and other sights. Check-in was quick and efficient and the staff were helpful and had good suggestions and spoke excellent English. Our room rate included a welcome drink in the stylish bar.  Our ""Superior"" room (#506) was comfortable, if not a little dark and away from the elevator. The ensuite bathroom had a combo tub/shower. Good storage in twin closets and the room had a love seat. Never did find a USB port.  Because the airline had delayed my luggage we spent more time hunting up clothing replacements than actually seeing the sights (although we had been there before). Staff was solicitous about our luggage situation. Carrefour down the street for food/wine items. Wish we had had more time for our stay. Would definitely go back.",5,2022,06,07
27,500 euros a night.. I don’t think so,"I have stayed at Bagues before and the location is perfect. The staff really are brilliant and a credit to the company. However due to the high costs of staying in Barcelona that weekend we paid almost 500 euros for a one night stay in room 601. This room is very tired and in desperate need of some tlc. Walls marked and tiles falling off the outside bath tub. The outside loungers in the pool were dirty. Windows filthy. I’m sorry but charging those rates you need to step up your game. Roof top terrace is nice but trying to get a drink is hard work. It’s a shame as this hotel was m excellent. One special mention are the hotel porters who couldn’t do enough. Really we should have complained to management about the room, if he’d like to email me at. chattox@live.com",1,2022,06,07
27,Lovely hotel.,"Reception was extremely helpful with restaurant reservations. All of the staff were just wonderful. It was a nice quiet oasis in the middle of an extremely busy, tourist filled area.  It was a perfect location for easy walking access to so much of the city along with conveniently located subway entrances. ",5,2022,05,25
27,Pretty Hotel,"This hotel was nice and despite being located on the active-at-all-times-of-the-day-and-night street, Las Ramblas, was relatively quiet. I felt safe and secure in this hotel due to the great reception staff. The terrace was nothing to hype about. The terrace bar was never open while we were there and had to call downstairs to get drinks delivered to the rooftop. The rooms were beautiful but the bed was extremely uncomfortable. It was as hard as a rock. The location of this hotel is central to every touristy place you could possible want and near the bus and subway stations. ",4,2022,05,24
27,Fabulous property!!,"Great value, fantastic property!! This hotel had a sleek, W-esque feel to it just a 100 meters from Placa Catalunya. And while the rooftop is cozy, there are great views of the Gothic Quarter. The rooms are small but very clean!",5,2022,05,13
27,A Lovely Property,"This well-located 5 star hotel is perfectly situated to enjoy the best of Barcelona.  Service was impeccable from check-in to check-out: efficient, friendly, and warm.  Rooms are a touch small, but they are designed efficiently with high-end fittings.  La Rambla is a busy area that can be noisy, yet the room was perfectly quiet.  The market is literally next door, and for those in need of covid testing to return to the US, staff can direct you to a testing facility is just a few blocks away for a cost of 35 euro.    Don’t miss the rooftop deck - a wonderful place to watch the sun go down.  I wish I had more time to enjoy the hotel",5,2022,05,07
27,Vacaciones en Barcelona,"Boutique hotel; well located in Las Ramblas, walking distance to Catalunya Square & Cathedral. Excellent service by all the personnel; good breakfast; installations well conserved; room is small; but this is a standard in more of the European rooms hotel. Highly recommend hotel and definitely come back.",5,2022,04,29
27,Perfect place to stay!,"Wonderfully friendly and helpful front desk staff.  They helped us find good restaurants and assisted us with getting our pre-flight Covid tests.  I'd stay here again in a flash.  The hotel is right on la Ramblas, so we really enjoyed walking around to see the sights.",5,2022,04,23
27,Excellent hotel,"Great hotel.  Truly five star service.  Replenished refreshments, helpful staff.  Skip the breakfast as it is pricy and not necessary with many bakeries nearby la ramblas.  The location is very good, though it is just on the edge of some rougher areas.  I never felt unsafe at night but in the morning (7am) while most from Barcelona are sleeping, some seedier characters are about in La ramblas.  

That is no knock on this hotel however.  We stayed in a deluxe (corner) room and enjoyed our balconies looking out over the street.  From here, you can walk to anywhere in the city.

Rooms are of excellent size by European standards.",5,2022,04,09
27,"Great location, beautiful hotel, wonderful service","Beautiful boutique hotel. Central location, delicious breakfast, helpful and friendly staff. Provides turndown services and “free” bar and water. Although the pool on the roof is very small (if that’s your draw), the views of the city up there are amazing.  ",5,2022,04,05
27,Not 5 stars,"Not 5 stars but a good place to stay.  Room was well appointed - nice view, nespresso and a mini bar.  Staff was great.  Bathroom had a bit of an odour, room could have been more soundproof and the towels were getting ratty.  Good location near the metro and attractions",4,2022,03,29
27,INCREDIBLE!! Best place to stay!!,The entire staff was very accommodating. The location of the hotel is perfect! Everything about it was awesome!! Thank you to the wonderful staff! Tor & Irena are excellent at what they do!! Thanks again,5,2022,03,28
27,Great stay at Hotel Bagues,"Hotel Bagues is extraordinary. The location is perfect, the staff was always very polite and helpful. One gentleman even walked us to a restaurant suggestion to make sure we found it. We stayed in a room with a private hot tub, which was amazing after a long day of walking and exploring Barcelona.",5,2022,03,28
27,stay in that hotel was excellent,"nice location  near everywhere. Clean rooms not very large but cozy. Helpful staff always ready to assist with nice restaurants and tips of the city. All what you need for a long weekend stay.
I would visit it again",5,2022,03,08
27,What makes a hotel a true 5 star?,"Is it fabulous design, most comfortable beds, perfect soundproofing (you wouldn’t believe you are right on La Rambla unless you open the window), a fresh rose and complimentary water, luxurious bath products and the slippers you can’t resist taking back home (and your cat takes over them the minute you unpack), delicious breakfast, turn down service with chocolates…? Yes, Bagues is all of that but most importantly, it is the hotel's staff. When you are addressed by your name every time you pass the reception (and certainly for the first time in my life before I even the checked in), when every member of the team is pleased to see you and takes pride in their work, their hotel and their hospitality, when nothing you ask for is a trouble but only an opportunity to help, you know you are in a real 5 star hotel. 

In the city that offers a huge choice of amazing places to stay Bagues still manages to stay on the top. I stayed here years ago and twice recently with my husband and our friend and just love it. We owned and ran a boutique B&B for over 12 years and I can’ only applaud the management for their perfect choice of the staff and they way they are trained - faultless. 

Thank you Lucas, Irene, Eduardo and all of the team members for making us feel so welcome! Special thanks to Adrian at the bar - his cocktails are to die for and his perfectionism, charm and friendliness make the bar a real magnet :-))) Perfect Margaritas, Cosmopolitans that would easily compete with the best New York bars and his famous Sangria that we promise to try next time. He also got me addicted to champagne at breakfast, I am really suffering back home!

The last but not the least: due to the unfortunate financial climate the prices for this luxury are suddenly very affordable, so take advantage if you have a chance to come to Barcelona. We are already looking for a pretext to go back soon. Muchos gracias, hotel Bagues, - we will be back!!!",5,2022,03,07
27,beautiful Barcelona,"We have had excellent weather, right for sightseeing! Hotel is situated at perfect spot at Rambla.

Thank you Lucas, Emmanuel, Souncalo, Jubit Edgar, and Thor for making our stay great.  Your help and service was outstanding.  This hotel was clean quaint and up to date.  We will stay there again when we come back.
Restaurants are nearby including a market and shops.  You will not be disappointed by staying there. Plus the rate of the hotel is reasonable.",5,2022,01,14
27,Beautiful Botique Hotel close to everything!,Absolutely great place to stay in Barcelona!  Hotel location great snd the Bagues staff could not have been accommodating!!  I was in Spain celebrating my 65th birthday and it was so nice of them to  present us with a bottle of Champaign to celebrate the occasion!!  Kudos to the staff for making our time in your beautiful Barcelona special..Thank you!!,5,2022,01,12
27,Gem hidden gem in the busy street,"I stayed for a couple of nights in this hotel . It’s a hidden gem right on the busy street. When I entered I was greeted by the staff , they accommodated me to room 201 which had a balcony with a street view . Since it’s a modern boutique hotel , the rooms were decent sized but all with modern amenities . The bathroom was good designed . I was greeted by Lucas and Very friendly in his approach suggested me very good options for vegetarian food also asked me  to keep my phone and wallet on the inside pocket of the jacket . for safety since the street outside is very busy and in the centre . soungalo was super.  Roxanne helped me to book a lab for Covid test being on a Sunday , called them and made sure it came on time . Edo and Nikolas were very warm and helped me with the luggage with their humble and pleasing attitude . Max served me breakfast in the morning . He’s a lovable guy . Understood my requirement for the breakfast and conveyed to the chef , served me . I always keep my room unclean, he used to clean the room quickly , not only that but helped me close the luggage at that point i was worried I might have to leave few stuff behind . After closing the bag he joked that’s the reason why his wife always asks him to close all their bags when they go out for holidays. .",5,2022,01,10
27,"Cosy, comfortable with super service","Surprisingly good boutique hotel- very comfortable, superb staff, great breakfasts and amazing barman Adriaan. Loved our stay and made us feel v special. Highly recommended. Going back again in February!",5,2022,01,09
27,great hotel and location,"great modern hotel, brilliant location, great staff especially Richard on reception and other duties.  Clean rooms, great shower and walking distance to all the places to see.  Rood top lovely, but its not a pool, more like a big bath on the roof!",5,2021,12,14
27,Great location on Las Rambla,Small boutique hotel that puts you in say walking distance of Sagrada Familia and the Rambla. Booked directly and had great communications with the staff. You can get breakfast included for a fee and it is very good. Bartender at night was enjoyable to chat with. Great drinks. We had room set up with twin beds but normally set up as a king. Close to the main market in Barcelona so you can find anything you want there. Very cordial staff throughout the hotel.,5,2021,12,01
27,"Cool vibe, good location, and attentive staff","Cool vibe, good location, and attentive staff.  Wish the in room mirrors and lighting were more functional. The bed comfort, linens and towels were more like 3 star quality. Need improvement, but would stay again. ",4,2021,11,23
27,Great stay here at Hotel Bagues,Overall my wife and I had a very pleasant stay here. We did not want to leave! The location is absolutely perfect - only a minute walk away from the Mercado de La Boqueria where it is always lively and bustling. Not to mention everything else available on La Rambla. All of the staff in the hotel were extremely pleasant and courteous. Our room was clean and all of the amenities were wonderful (we used the hottub everyday). The gym is a little bit small but it gets the job done and no one is going to this hotel just for the gym anyway. Breakfast was wonderful. They allowed us to leave our luggage there after we checked out since we still had time before heading to the airport which was extremely helpful. I would not hesitate to stay here again if I was back in Barcelona.,5,2021,11,15
27,Excellent hotel,"Stayed here for a second time and again not disappointed. Very helpful staff , nothing too much trouble. The hotel is in an excellent location on La Rambla but is very peaceful. Breakfast was a delight, plenty of choice on the continental side and perfectly cooked hot options, served by very amicable staff.  Room was spotless .",5,2021,11,09
27,"BB. No, not bed and brekfast. Best of Barcelona!","I have been here before. Location: Well, on the Rambla. Hotel: nice litte butique type of hotel, very far from a modern business hotel. Hotel service second to none. Breakfast: outstanding quality and service. Price: All things considered, very reasonable. ( Hope the hotel does not read this.) Will I be back? Hell, yes!",5,2021,11,08
27,Hotel Bagues a Great place to stay,"We stayed in Hotel Bagués for 4 days while in Barcelona and it was totally perfect.  The staff was terrific including exceptional service from Roxanne.  The location could not have been better.  The location was right on La Rambla but the room was incredibly quiet.

Highly recommended",5,2021,10,16
27,Luxury Boutique Hotel On La Rambla,"Small luxurious independent boutique type hotel on the middle of La Rambla. Impossible to get a better position for a sight seeing. Despite our room
facing directly onto La Rambla the room was VERY quiet and peaceful, there was no traffic noise. Friendly helpful service. Lovely rooftop terrace. ",5,2020,02,22
27,Perfect place for Barcelona,"What a fabulous hotel- perfect position on Las Ramblas, beautiful interior and immaculate rooms. The staff are very welcoming, friendly and very attentive- nothing was too much trouble. They also gave us a bottle of champagne for my husband’s birthday, what a lovely gesture. We will definitely be coming back!",5,2020,02,19
27,Perfect Hotel for Long Weekend Trip,"Hotel is clean, stylish and staff are really welcoming. It is really well located at the top of Las Ramblas and only 1 min walk from the famous food market. No issues with noise despite the busy location. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a romantic getaway with their partner.",5,2020,02,13
27,"Great location, very small beds and tired rooms","Location is excellent right on Ramblas. Hotel rooms tiny, our room very smelly from a restaurant chimney. Rooms are tiny, beds very small. 160x200 cm is there “double” bed size. 

I wouldn’t come back. It’s a clone of the other derby hotels in this city all with tiny beds, but this hotel is double the price of their other properties due to its location. 

Rooms are tired and outdated   They really milked the place the past 5 years. We stayed here 5 years ago and it was a world of difference ",3,2020,02,11
27,Brilliant stay in Barcelona,"This was our first trip to Barcelona, the hotel is perfectly placed, smack in the centre of La Rambia. All the staff were amazing, nothing was too much trouble making sure we knew exactly where needed to go and how to get there always going the extra mile. Before we arrived we were tempted to go into the city for breakfast but it was was so good we always ate in the hotel.They all spoke excellent english, so no need for my pigeon Spanish (the only thing worse than my Spanish is my Catalan!)",5,2020,02,07
27,Excellent,Excellent hotel in an ideal location. Staff were incredibly helpful and arranged any tours or booking on request. They also had many recommendations on restaurants all of which exceeded expectations. Would highly recommend Hotel Bagués!,5,2020,02,03
27,Beware !!,Nicely designed room with nice bathroom and friendly staff but having booked an hotel on las Ramblas we expected a bit of a view but be aware this hotel has rooms with no external windows obviously with no views which can feel very claustrophobic and a bit unpleasant in the morning when you wake up and there is no natural light to give you a clue of the time.,2,2020,01,20
27,Mrs,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel the staff where most attentive, the hotel is superb very clean, bed so comfortable after a day of touring would definitely stay there again 10 /10 
This boutique hotel is chic the decor beautiful ",5,2020,01,16
27,Excellent,Very professional and friendly in all circumstances. Perfect . Reception at the top with a special mention to the head receptionist. If one day we’re back we will for sure stay there again. Nice room quiet despite location on La Rambla ,5,2020,01,05
27,Wonderful Stay,Cannot says enough about our stay here. 4 nights over Christmas. The staff were very helpful and attentive. Their recommendations were always on point. The room was an interior facing room and was very quiet. Perfect for getting over jet lag! The food in the restaurant was good. All in all a wonderful stay. Would definitely return. Oh and the location is perfect.,5,2019,12,29
27,Perfect Cosy Hotel 😍❤️,"One of the best boutique hotels ive ever stayed in. The service was so personalised, quick and as requested! The beds are so comfortable and bathrooms are perfect with an amazing Jacuzzi! Would definitely stay there again especially with the great location on La rambla.  ",5,2019,12,28
27,A hidden gem in Las Ramblas,"Everything about this hotel is superb. The rooms are amazing but make sure you upgrade and pay the extra for a suite as it's well worth it, in particular room 601. It's divine and so worth it. The front desk staff helped make our dream come true and booked us to see the Sagrada Familia Cathedral which was fantastic. The breakfast was delightful and albeit held in the lobby area, it was lovely and the selection was decent. We also used the steam room which was quite simply the best steam room I have ever used. ",5,2019,12,27
27,Excellent hotel,"I’m not sure what I can add but I can say that I enjoyed the location and the hotel. I experienced more of a smaller boutique hotel feel which I appreciate. It was convenient, the breakfast was tasty, the rooms were quiet and dark when I put the blackout curtains which was important for me. The WiFi was so-so but it worked. I’ll definitely stay here again the next time I come back. ",5,2019,12,26
27,"Gorgeous, well-located hotel with a fabulous staff","We recently spent a week in Barcelona for my ""big"" birthday and I must admit that I was a bit nervous about staying in La Rambla because it's such a touristy area. As it turns out, Hotel Bagues is within walking distance of many of the places we wanted to visit in the city (museums, historic houses, restaurants, shops, etc.) We had no trouble at all avoiding the tacky chain stores and eateries and getting to the fun places. It's only a short walk from where the Aerobus drops one off on the Placa de Catalunya and also close to public transit. 

The Bagues is located in a historic palace that was also a jewelry workshop at one time and the decor is a lovely mix of antique and modern styles. No cheesy, Ikea-esque furniture here, as one usually finds in hotels! Our room was beautiful and the bathroom even had a tub - a rarity in big-city hotels and something I very much appreciated. 

We've stayed in many hotels over the years and the staff here is the best we've ever dealt with. Professional, friendly, helpful, and fun to chat with. They even stood us a drink or two after my dreadful birthday dinner at a much-lauded restaurant (please see my other reviews for more on that!) If you're heading to Barcelona, stay here.",5,2019,12,12
27,"Great location, nice room and service that was spoiled by a single person","Great experience.  I visited Barcelona and decided to stay at a hotel by the most famous street.  Absolutely great location.  Even though it was my business trip, I fell in love with the beautiful city of Barcelona.  From the hotel, I had access to a tourist guide, a traditional-style market, a Barca Soccer Nike shop, and numerous shops I enjoyed visiting.  The room itself was very beautiful and I enjoyed free drinks.  The staffs were very friendly and professional.  
Until the last moment, I could have given 5 stars for the hotel.  

The problem was that the hotel fee and tax were shady.  I booked through United that showed hotel fee $200 and  tax and other things as $40.  When I checked in, I paid the full price (I thought) and asked for a receipt.  They said, they will give me a receipt when I check out.  There was not really anything that I expected to be added but I did not really care.  

When I tried to check out, I did not find anybody in the lobby.  I waited.  A new concierge that I never met came in.  He looked less experienced than other concierge and spoke English with a strong accent.  He began telling me that I had to pay 5 more Euros and explained something that is hard to understand.  I really did not care but I felt something strange so that I tried to check the reservation.  It was hard to verify this ""city tax"" that suddenly appeared on top of the $40 I need to pay for tax and other things.  Anyway, I did not care so that I said ok to the not-so-respectful concierge.  And, he gave me a receipt only for this 5 euro instead of the whole $480 that I needed.  I told him that I need a receipt for the all expenses and he was supposed to give me one.  Probably he felt that I was pointing out his mistake and he became defensive and told me that it was rude to tell him so.  He gave me the receipt anyway.   When I was leaving, he yelled at me something again.  I don't care but the hotel should be aware of the concierge is not educated enough and behave childishly.  I would never stay here again after I saw him.

Very unprofessional.  

Also, the receipt showed that the hotel fee was $220 and tax $20 instead of $200 and $40.  This is a little bit a problem for me when I need to reimburse from the company.  Moreover, the way they charge and explained the price made me feel this hotel is a scam.",3,2019,12,05
27,Great hotel,"Excellent location on Las Ramblas street,great welcoming staff,very clean.
Staff always ready to help you with recommendations about places to go and where to eat.
Would come back again without hesitation.
Thank you for making our stay very enjoyable.",5,2019,11,29
27,Beautiful - 5 Star Boutique Hotel in excellent location,"Hotel Bagues, is a stunning small boutique hotel in the center of Barcelona right on La Rambla, a perfect location for exploring Barcelona.  All the staff exceeded all my expectations and were delightful, helpful, charming and so very kind, especially Richard at the front desk. The room and decor was trendy, modern and quiet. I stayed 4 nights and loved the hotel. Breakfast was delicious and generous. It has a lovely roof top bar and swimming pool too!  I would go back and would recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona!",5,2019,11,26
27,Paradox!,"Thanks to the good location of the hotel, walks a lot of tourists - it's good! All of them are very loud and at night interfere with sleep - it's bad! Can be insert the second glass unit? Think about it !",5,2019,11,21
27,Amazing,I really loved this hotel.  Very unique in style and the staff was so amazingly nice.  I like they were available 24 hours and was always so nice no matter what.  They stocked my refrigerator and had a great coffee machine.  The breakfast was worth it too.  I will go back with my family.,5,2019,11,12
27,Beautiful boutique hotel in a perfect location,This is a little gem of a hotel right in the centre of Barcelona . It's beautifully decorated and has a lovely calm and peaceful atmosphere. The staff were wonderful and nothing was too much trouble. We stayed in a jewel suite which was delightful . The rooms aren't huge - but are stylish and have everything you need . Would definitely recommend . The location could not be better . We walked everywhere ! We found an amazing cocktail bar in the Gothic area called Dux . Superb cocktails - very imaginative and fun . !,5,2019,11,10
27,Great place to stay in Barcelona,"We spent 5 nights at the Bagues and really loved it. The staff were always helpful with directions, reservations and general suggestions of places to visit. The location was perfect to reach everything easily. Breakfast was delicious. The rooms were very comfortable and quiet. Highly recommend it.",5,2019,11,10
27,Birthday trip,"We had a wonderful stay. The staff is amazing. Helpful and very friendly. Very clean hotel. 
The breakfast was always very good. The rooftop bar is a nice way to  end a busy sightseeing day. 
Fantastic drinks available. ",5,2019,10,29
27,Cozy Suite,We were on a Roadtrip and searching for a room with a private jacuzzi. The Suite in the Hotel Bagués was fulfilling all our desires. The service was really nice and the whole hotel was looking lovely. The room was small but very cozy and the interior stylish. The jacuzzi worked fine and the room was very clean. Roomservice came fast and the food was nice. In general small but very good!,5,2019,10,22
27,"Exceptional property, perfect location","Absolutely beautiful property with nicely decorated rooms, comfortable bed and many rooms have balconies overlooking Las Ramblas. Service was impeccable, breakfast excellent and the rooftop deck and pool are amazing with decent views. This is a really special property right on Las Ramblas in the most central location you could want.",5,2019,10,18
27,"Great location, Awesome staff","Top notch service by a super friendly, helpful staff at this lovely hotel in a great location on La Rambla in Barcelona.
Comfortable rooms in a spot that is easy to visit local highlights in the medieval area of this beautiful city.",5,2019,10,17
27,My Great Experience,"I have stayed at the Bagues hotel in earlier September, It was my first experience visiting Barcelona and the Bagues hotel did not disappoint me. 

The breakfast served was delicious and the rooms are in excellent condition, to compliment this even further the service received from the staff were outstanding. I would like to thank the following staff that really made my stay stand out:

Sungala
Miguel Angel 
Antonella
Edward
Roxanne
Adrian (Who makes the most exceptional cocktails)

Last but not least Richard who is an absolute super star. He made me feel as though Bagues was my home away from home.

If I were to recommend any hotel in Barcelona the Bagues hotel would certainly be my first choice!",5,2019,10,11
27,Superb hotel,We stayed 3 nights at this hotel and could not fault it on any level.  Without exception all the staff we met were impeccable and seemed to be able to pre-empt anything that we needed.  The location is excellent on La Rambla making it a short walk to any of the main areas you want to visit.  The rooms were spotless and well appointment. Definitely recommend a stay here .,5,2019,10,10
27,Well located and stylish,"A couple of nights break in Barcelona with my wife. A lovely little boutique hotel that was very stylish and well located on La Rambla. 
Roof top was very peaceful and staff were very friendly and helpful. They gave us  two great dinner recommendations.",5,2019,10,07
27,Great Experience,"Had a very nice stay. The location, room, and services were all outstanding. Great rooftop bar. Perfect for our vacation. The staff, receptionists, doormen, and barman were all friendly, helpful, and courteous. Highly recommend.",5,2019,09,30
27,Barcelona Weekend,"Wonderful weekend in Barcelona with my daughter. Hotel Bagues is situated closed to the market and in the center of Rambla. 
The hotel employees were very kind and helpful, we got a lot of useful suggestions how to move and what to see in Barcelona
",5,2019,09,28
27,We LOVE The Hotel Bagues in Barcelona!,A stylish hotel in a premier location with outstanding customer service.  The room was small but that was more than compensated for by the friendly staff whose attention to detail and each customer's satisfaction was superior.,5,2019,09,27
27,Truly a Five-Star Hotel,"Hotel Bagues is in the perfect location in Barcelona, at the perfect price, and with excellent service. I am very impressed with this hotel. Also, it offers an assortment of sweets at the entrance. This is THE 5-Star hotel to book with in Barcelona.",5,2019,09,18
27,Excellent boutique hotel,"Our first impression was that we were greeted with warmth and friendliness especially from Richard who dealt with our luggage, patiently used a map to point out the best things to visit in the city. He arranged our entrance to Sagrida Família and our city bus tour and on top of all this, he gave us champagne. I would definitely recommend. Roof bar quaint with small dipping pool and our rooms impeccably clean. Thank you!",5,2019,09,10
27,Second time and it is still our destination,"unbeatable location, service and experience, this is our second time in three years and we walked out feeling that we got our money value for the stay. My wife and I stayed in the hotel in 2017, now we are are back again with our kids for a repeated family vacation and again it was truly worthwhile",5,2019,09,04
27,Short break,"Room was just amazing looking along the rambles, room service was really good the manager was at hand to help out personally with my surprise. As for the location I couldn’t ask for more right in the heart of it all. Nice and warm and the roof top terrace drinks views were great",5,2019,09,03
27,Fantastic staff and luxury accommodations at an affordable price,"We chose The Hotel Bagues mostly based on the location but we surprised at how wonderful it was. The price was not outlandish for a large city during high season (around $330) but the quality of the rooms, the lobby, and the staff were far above much more expensive hotels that we’ve stayed at.  The room was beautifully furnished, the bed was very comfortable with wonderful linens, and the bathroom was like a spa. But probably the best part was how helpful the staff was. The front desk including the bell staff were really welcoming and so helpful with every question we had. Emmanuel at the front desk was amazingly kind, and quickly helped us get set up with a plan for our entire stay.  The rooftop bar is tiny but is a hidden jewel with a bartender who was so friendly and made us some great cocktails. 

Definitely will stay here again when we return to Barcelona!",5,2019,08,26
27,Wonderful little hotel,"Quirky, clever, great service, extremely welcoming. Lovely roof top pool deck, great location right on rambles, beautiful suite with a hot tub, lovely bar. Recommend it highly and would book at any of the properties. ",5,2019,08,20
27,Fabulous Hotel,"Fabulous location. Wonderful staff that were very helpful in every aspect of our stay. Would recommend this Hotel. 10 out 10. Staff went out of their way to ensure you had everything you needed, whether it be information on a place to eat or how to get to a particular place. Fabulous hotel. ",5,2019,08,13
27,Awesome location,Great place.  Modern awesome decor.  Front desk staff very kind.  Especially Richard.  Breakfast add on is worth it for ease and food quality.   We got a more expensive room.  Was impressed with the sound proof ability to block street noise even with 2 balconies.  Was not thrilled about the church bells from church directly next to our room.  Also found that any noise in hallways including someone on our floor simply shutting their door was extremely loud.  So the soundproofing only works for street noise.   Room is kinda small but understandable in a big city awesome location.  The bathroom layout wasn’t great.  Sink allowed zero staff to put any of your personal belongings. ,4,2019,08,07
27,The perfect place to stay!,"Our rooms were small but very attractive and well-appointed.  The best part about this gem was the people!   They made our entire stay more special, from welcoming us to sit in the lobby, always asking what they could get or do for us, recommending a beach away from the maddening crowd (where we felt like natives!.  Kudos to all the staff, but extra thanks to Richard and to Gialuca for making us feel like treasured guests!
 I would recommend this hotel to ANYONE and everyone!",5,2019,07,22
27,A Great Respite In the Middle of the Action!,"Very sleek, modern hotel in the middle of the busy Ramblas.  Two doors down from the Boqueria and surrounded by the historic Gothic Quarter.   We felt quite safe despite being in pickpocket central as the hotel is secure.  Rooms are comfortable enough with great views.    Breakfast is a huge spread with many options.  What really makes the hotel, though, is the staff.  Because the hotel is small, they are cross trained essentially to do it all.  We had a large party of 11, and they were very accommodating.  Big shout out to Nicolo and Marco for going above and beyond for us, the desk managers, and the morning bfast crew.  I see no reason to stay elsewhere in Barcelona!",5,2019,07,18
27,"Great location, cozy hotel","I loved the location of this hotel. And the rooftop bar was really nice. Pool is tiny, but still a cool addition to the rooftop. I even took a dip.
The rooms are super comfy, quiet (disputed the busy street out side and church just next door) and great dark curtains, which I love! Slept like a baby. 
Would definitely go back. 
Loved the market which was super close to the hotel. ",5,2019,07,13
27,Home away from Home,"What an absolutely lovely boutique hotel.  Set in the midst of La Rambla and with a staff that has an incredible attention to detail and a sixth sense of whether you might need some help. On arrival, Richard and Antonella made sure our check in was smooth and the time spent by Richard explaining our location and nearby attractions was fantastic.  They do this with all arriving guests as they serve them a welcome drink.  Customer service in this hotel goes on and beyond. We can't speak highly enough of all the staff, Gianlucca, the lovely and talented barman that services the rooftop bar.  The caring doorman and all the other staff ensured our stay was memorable.  We will definitely be back!",5,2019,07,02
27,Wonderful Hotel,"From the second you arrive in this hotel you are treated like royalty. The staff are a credit to the hotel. From the reception staff and bell boy - Nicolas to the roof terrace pool bar where Andreis will serve the best cocktails in Barcelona. The views at the top of this hotel are unreal. 
The breakfasts are reasonably priced and are of very high quality. You can tell the popularity of a hotel when there’s a mix of nationalities at one time. British, Americans, Italians, Spanish. It’s faultless. Apart from one thing. Room 101 is soooo noisy from about 4:30 until 7:30. It’s above the kitchen and dining area and whilst I appreciate the staff having to get the area ready, it really kept us awake. 
But on the whole it is definitely worth the visit. 
Please please use the roof terrace!!! ",5,2019,07,01
27,Just Perfect!,What a gem in the center of the gothic district. Staff simply amazing and nothing is too much effort! Location is perfect and close to everything. Rooms are great! We arrived very early after a 27 hour flight and they allowed us to have a shower and leave our luggage as check-in was only available later. If we come back to Barcelona this will be our preferred place to stay. A big thank you to all staff members.,5,2019,06,30
27,Loved the crew and location!,"Rooms were great and beautifully designed, and all services involved were very professional - cleaning, laundry (a bit overpriced in my opinion), room service etc.
The best part were the people in the reception and the rest of the crew - excellent, professional and friendly service was found everywhere in the hotel.
We appreciate the flexibility in our departure day and will definitely recommend this place to other people who are interested in top-notch service in a top-notch location.",5,2019,06,23
27,Peaceful oasis on Las Ramblas in Barcelona,"I LOVED this hotel.  It is part of the Derby Hotels Collection and I got a good deal on that site.  It's in the middle of everything on Las Ramblas, very close to the market.  The hotel is beautifully designed with lots of unique artwork.  It's a true 5 star property.  Rooms are big by European standards and there are larger rooms with balconies for those who choose to upgrade.  The staff was phenomenal, helpful and friendly.  It's a smallish hotel in an historical building.  The friendly doorman was exceedingly helpful with directions and tips and hailing of cabs.   Don't miss the rooftop bar and friendly bartender!  I highly recommend Bagues!",5,2019,06,10
27,Barcelona,Staff was really friendly and helpful we liked the location it was central. The windows and room door were not sound proofed enough and we could hear the bells from out side and people walking in the walkway also. But overall was a really good experience. Just don't be late for check out because they get pissed. ,5,2019,06,09
27,A little gem in the heart of Barcelona,"A gorgeous boutique hotel, with attentive and professional staff - quiet and comfortable rooms, although on the smaller side but very well designed respecting that it is a listed building. Highly recommended.",5,2019,06,09
27,Absolutely charming hotel and wonderful staff and location,"Came here for a two night stay after 5 nights at an out town location.
The staff were unbelievable charming and helpful, nothing was too much trouble and they could not do enough to make our stay perfect. My wife had caught a slight cold earlier in the trip and the hotel staff wanted to do all they could to make things comfortable for her.
The location is perfect right in the old city centre just off the busy la Rambla,but as soon as one walked in the hotel door, it was a quiet oasis of calm and luxury.and the crowds outside were instantly forgotten about. The room was compact but roomy enough and the decor luxurious. The AC and wifi were both excellent and bathroom well appointed although we could have done with one more shelf in the bathroom.
The rooftop bar and views were great and the barman there particularly nice and helpful.
Highly recommended. I was using airline points to pay for the room, so I cannot comment on value for money, but for a city centre hotel I cannot believe there is a finer option in Barcelona",5,2019,06,04
27,Simply the best,Hotel was very clean.  staff was friendly and attentive.  location was right in the middle of La Rambla.  Sweets in the lobby were tasty. breakfast was delicious.  Staff recommendations were perfect for Flamenco dance show and restaurants  ,5,2019,06,01
27,"Great hotel, great location","We were expecting this hotel to be fabulous and we were not disappointed.   The staff could not have been more helpful, our room and the ambience hotel itself was beautiful.   Step out the door and we were right in the middle of the awesome Gothic District.    We would love to stay here again.",5,2019,05,30
27,"Marvellous, staff and marvellous location","We had a short four day stay in Bagues hotel. It really is attractive with a period facade but completely modernised inside. Our room was very comfortable and well serviced, but what made our stay so memorable was the helpful attitude of each member of staff, who  strive to make their guests feel welcome and at home. Added to the fact that the hotel is situated on La Rambla, the very best of streets in Barcelona, we have already decided that we must return!",5,2019,05,07
27,"What a friendly, helpful and well located hotel","We really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is very stylish and well located so we could walk to many attractions. What made it such a great break for us was the amazing friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff. In particular Richard gave us a map and spent 15 minutes outlining what to see and how to get there. Breakfast was great and the rooftop bar delightful in the evening.
",5,2019,05,07
27,Lovely Hotel,"Perfect location and a really lovely hotel.

Attentive service and our room was lovely.  Very clean, beds turned down every night and bottled water replaced daily.

Great panoramic views from the top floor over Barcelona. 

Would certainly stay here again.",5,2019,05,04
27,"Beautiful hotel, great staff, perfect location","This hotel offers a quiet calm and luxurious  environment immediately on the Ramblas. We stayed for 2 nights and would highly recommend. Whilst the Ramblas is always busy it is easy to find and return back to after meals and visits, you cant get lost staying here! 

Straight off the busy street we received a wonderful welcome and although we were early were provided with coffee and luggage store. The hotel also stored our luggage on our final day after breakfast, thank you.

The room was immaculate, clean and nicely arranged. Our room was on the front of the building and if you opened the windows you had the busy sound of a bustling city (I quite like the noise of being in a city) but close the windows and the highly effective triple glazing cut out all noise. 

I considered the house keeping here of a high standard and staff were extremely helpful in recommending eating and visiting places. THe break fast was also good value and there was a good choice of of hot and cold dishes. 

I would definately return and recomend this hotel.",5,2019,04,29
27,Worst Night Sleep,"First review I’ve ever written on a hotel because I have never had a worse night sleep than at the Bagues Hotel in Barcelona.  I travel for work and on vacations overseas - stayed in much worse hotels but never had a worse night sleep due to noisey guests and a staff unable/unwilling to do anything about it.  It’s a shame because the hotel is lovely and staff friendly - just totally unwilling and unable to resolve the problem and then a weak offer to make up for it.  I stayed with my wife on Wednesday night and we had an early flight the next morning.  The hotel let a family who had at least 3 of the rooms check in late and then let run around between the 2 rooms next to me and then to the rooms above me, yelling hallway and letting those heavy hotel doors slam shut.  This went on for over 3 hours.  I went down and complained in person twice - but Hotel staff were very meek and apprehensive - I got a “well we already warned them once” response when I went down the second time, even though the father was in the lobby and his young child running around the lobby/bar area at midnight as I spoke.   What they should have done was check the floor a few times after my second complaint, and when they saw a child from the family running around, should have surmised the issue was not resolved, they should not have placed my room sandwiched on all sides and from above by one family, and they should have gotten back when they said they would, and offered at least the 50% refund they indicated they would be offering.  It was clear the hotel did not want to upset this other guest and valued them more than me.  I complained again when checking out and was told we’d be contacted within a day by management.  We weren’t.  We had to email and complain and they offered to waive a 20€ bar bill and 10% of room rate - but My wife and I would have traded that for a few more hours of sleep on what ended up being a very long trip home and in fact had to pay $100 to rent a mini suite at the Atlanta airport to get 3 hours of sleep, which is something I’ve also never had to do before.  You may be rolling the dice if you stay here - could get a lovely stay or could have a terrible night sleep.",1,2019,04,24
27,In the heart of La Rambla but noisy at all hours,"This small boutique hotel has a lot to offer but would not be my pick on a return visit.

It was wonderful to be able to walk straight out of the hotel and be in the thick of the active life and happenings of La Rambla and the local Markets which are just two doors down.  The down side to this is that the activity never stops and at night this can be very noisy.  

Petty crime is a real issue in Barcelona particularly around the La Rambla and the Market area where the hotel is located.  With the right care and attention this can be managed.  Some security features can be improved at the hotel to increase the feeling of safety in the rooms. For example, there are no internal security latches and access between floors are is not secure.

The rooms are small but comfortable.  Loved the inclusion of a Nespresso machine.  Great views of La Rambla and the Terrace on the top floor is a great place to visit for sunset and a late afternoon drink.

27,Amazing Hotel ,"I stayed at hotel Bagues 6th - 7th March with my boyfriend as a little trip away to one of our favourite cities. The main reason I booked the hotel was the decor inside (I LOVE the staircases) and also the location as it is on one of the main roads in Barcelona (La Rambla).

It cost around 30 euros from the airport in a taxi and we arrived earlier than the check in time, the hotel were amazing and our room was ready straight away. I had booked a superior double room and as part of my request I asked if I could have a balcony overlooking La Rambla. The Hotel more than accommodated the request and it was the highlight of my stay...waking up in the morning in Barcelona and walking onto your own balcony in your robe and slippers provided by the hotel and have people waving at you like your the queen or something was boss. 

The room itself had an amazing comfy double bed which at night one of the maids had placed chocolates on your bed. It had a safe a mini bar a tv with English channels. The bathroom had an amazing shower and it has all toiletries provided also. Our hairdryer didn’t seem to work to which I rang reception and a new one was provided within 5 minutes. 

The rooftop bar and swim area looked amazing, we didn’t go for a swim as I forgot to bring a bikini but the view from their was just boss. 

The location of the hotel is just fab as it is on the one of the main roads La Rambla you are like a 5 minute walk from Plaça de Catalunya, from here you can get on a hop on hop off bus tour. Their is also the Hard Rock Cafe, Five Guys etc and then a further walk to one of the poshest streets in Barcelona Passeig de Gràcia which has the likes of Christian Louboutin Gucci Louis Vuitton. 

Another 5 minute walk from the hotel also leads you to the Mirador de colom, you can walk down to the port aquarium and also the world trade centre. 

As I only stayed the one night I didn’t get to experience everything that this hotel had to offer but I would definitely recommend to anyone to come here, I will definitely coming back and staying here in 2026 when the Sagrada Família is finally completed. 

Also the staff were all lovely especially the hotel porter he was an absolute gent and so lovely. 

",5,2019,03,11
27,Weekend Trip,"Great location, super friendly and polite staff , nice ambiance in the hotel , roof top patio a nice feature of the hotel given its location , rooms are compact but very clean and modern , we will return to this hotel ",5,2019,03,07
27,Great Hotel,"A climatic place in John Wick style. Small, but very nice hotel in the heart of Barcelona. Pretty much everything in walking distance. Very helpful staff. Room was great, don't expect a lot of space, but remember, that you are in the very center of the city. We've spent a great time there.",5,2019,03,04
27,Excellence in a small package ,"My husband and I took a 5 day visit for my birthday to Barcelona with the goal of visiting the famous Las Ramblas & Gothic Quarters. I being very particular about living accommodations search and read every review possible to find the perfect hotel and selected the Hotel Bagues. Upon entrance I was pleasantly surprised. It’s spectacular! The hotel is a boutique but luxurious, well appointed and very service oriented. The staff is very friendly and made it their goal to recognize every guest and were very accommodating. A fresh breakfast option came with our purchase and was very delightful. The day of my birthday we were surprised to receive a bottle of champagne, birthday note and chocolates from the staff. Very personalized service. I could go on and on as the service and accommodations were excellent!!!! The location was great within walking distance to everything and the staff went over and beyond in suggesting key places to visit and restaurants. This hotel has a client for life in fact I’ll be back in March for a week. 
",5,2019,02,25
27,Amazing location with outstanding service,"I stayed here for 3 nights last weekend with a friend and this hotel was the perfect choice. All the reception staff were amazing, from the two guys who checked us in to the evening staff who helped us make reservations for dinner plans. Everyone was so lovely and helpful with everything we needed whilst staying. They even accommodated the requests we made before via email and checked us in at 10am even though check in time starts at 3pm. 

It is in the ideal location of La Ramblas but it doesn't feel hectic or noisy in the hotel at all, we realised how good the sound proofing was when we opened our balcony on the Sunday to watch the parade with the marching band and we could barely hear it when the balcony was shut. 

Lots of storage space, with an amazing bathroom (and fluffy bathrobes) and they will happily keep your suitcases after you check out, which was ideal for us as our flight wasn't until the evening!

The only negative I have from the whole experience was that there was barely any plug sockets. We had one by the tv and then one in the bathroom which made it difficult for 2 of us to charge our multiple electrical devices.

I will definitely be staying here again when I go back and would recommend the Bagues Hotel to anyone.",5,2019,02,16
27,outstanding!,"I stayed here for 2 nights over a weekend in Feb with a friend and fell in love. I can't fault a thing. Amazing staff, friendly, helpful and kind. Edgar and Emanuel, two gentlemen who checked us in were especially great! Top notch service. The hotel is in an amazing location and makes it so easy to pop back to freshen up or take 5 before exploring some more. It couldn't be closer to the metro and is the perfect base to get anywhere. The hotel was super clean and truly is a boutique, luxurious 5 star. The rooms are great for blocking out sound, couldn't hear the people on las rambla at all. I used the sauna, which felt more like a steam room, but still good, and would definitely have loved to sit up on the terrace if it was a bit warmer. I would recommend to anyone who appreciates a smaller property and truly values great service! Thank you for a wonderful weekend!",5,2019,02,12
27,Great hotel in a great location ,"The property is in the perfect location and the staff (Richard) is beyond professional and courteous!! we would definitely stay here again. 
It is very modern and clean! 

Beautiful luxurious towels and bath robes. Wonderful shower with very large shower head and great water pressure!  

Great closet space to put clothes- two sides to the closet and shelves in between. 

All of the floors are marble so it is easy to hear doors shutting and elevators opening during the night. We just went and bought a $10 fan down the street and it solved the problem and created perfect white noise. 

Highly recommend this property.",5,2019,01,31
27,Flawed. ,"Came to Bagues over Christmas for four days. The hotel has an incredible location right on the main strip of La Rambla and is easily accessible to the cities attractions and sights. Don’t let this put you off, the sound proof windows are incredible and sleeping is no issue, they’ve clearly invested in this which was great! 

The facilities in the room were okay, however, they didn’t have an iron board or iron which baffles me as I’d expect that from a 3 star hotel. I imagine many customers stay for business, is this not a problem that could be worked around? Instead you have to ask reception and they will bring it up for you and take it back once finished. A minor inconvenience but it doesn’t make sense to me. 

One of the really sad things about this hotel is the lobby. As stated the sound proof windows are brilliant from blocking out the outside hustle and bustle of the city but the interior doors are not. When drunk members of the hotel retire for the night it can be heard extremely clearly as the open plan lobby reaches even the higher floors (I was located on the 4th floor). I understand this is the architecture of the building but it’s still slightly annoying when you’re nodding off and are woken by the echoing slurs of customers coming back to the hotel. 

My biggest moan about the hotel is the payment system. Before I start I will state that I’m from the UK and I am aware that different countries have different rules and regulations, and laws. When I arrived to the hotel I went to check into my room and was told that my room was not paid for. My stay was a gift from my Father who was coming out to stay with me on the latter two days of my trip. Only a deposit was taken but we were under the impression that it had all been paid (my Father rarely checks his bank statements). No worries though right? I’ll just phone him and they can take payment over the phone. No. This wasn’t the case. The manager insisted that they cannot take payment over the phone and the person who reserved the room has to be there in person with the correct card on their system. This is flawed massively. I’m sure we can’t be their only problem with this? Luckily as stated my Father was flying out the last two days of my trip to see me and stay in the hotel also. With this in mind the manager gave me allowance and stated that my father could pay when he arrived. This was very appreciated and I am thankful for that, however, the whole situation didn’t need to occur. It also left me slightly uncomfortable with the situation knowing that I was almost staying on borrowed time. I would suggest that management look into a way they can take payment over the phone. It isn’t too hard to do that. Especially for a 5 star hotel...

...what if my father wasn’t coming to see me though? How would the payment be taken? 

The room I stayed in was visually pleasing. The showers are amazing, if you love a good shower, you’ll love theirs! All round the room was enough space and luxury that you would expect from a five star hotel. 

If you are visiting from a foreign country and your flight is in the evening you have the option to leave your luggage in the morning when you check out so you don’t have to spend your last day trekking your bags around. That was useful and hassle free. 

The staff were brilliant, very professional and welcoming and gave great local knowledge about La Rambla and the surrounding areas. 

All in all Bagues sits in the middle of the 5 star category but with a few managements flaws that could be easily rectified. 

Thanks for accommodating me. 

",3,2019,01,28
27,Exceptional service in great location,Thank you Mar and team for a wonderful five star stay! We loved our stylish room and you guys were great looking after Luna as well. It was really easy to get anywhere from the hotel including all boutiques and restaurants. Highly recommend the hotel! Thank you!,5,2019,01,27
27,Fantastic ,"This was booked for me on a business trip and we were so impressed, from the outside you don't really see how great this place is. We had a very warm welcome from very efficient staff, my room was tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean. The bed was very comfortable, I was also impressed how quiet it was despite the central location. This next point might seem minor but the air conditioning was so quiet I was not sure it was working, I find many good hotels are let down by noisy air conditioning, this was the best I have experienced.

The breakfast was very good indeed, I would say the best I have had in Barcelona.

I highly recommend this hotel. I will be returning. ",5,2019,01,19
27,Fantastic. ,"Just had an amazing 2 days at this hotel with 25 friends for a birthday. This hotel was an amazing find in a fantastic location.

27,European luxury in the heart of Barcelona,"What a find, right on La Rambla in the middle of the Gothic Quarter. This boutique hotel has quite bedrooms, beautiful bathrooms, and terrific service. The front staff are always cheerful (like a cruise ship, we were greeted by name every time we walked through their exquisitely designed and comfortable lobby), expertly helpful (need a car and driver - just ask!) Very comfortable beds, good food out of the on site kitchen - but with dozens of great little eateries less than a couple minutes stroll out the door..... The location is great, spend four nights so everyday you can explore by foot in a different direction!",5,2019,01,15
27,Hotel Bagues,"Staff was awesome, made us feel welcome and attended to our every need. Location was amazing, and we would definitely return to stay. The rooms, although a little smaller in keeping with most European rooms, were well apportioned and cozy",5,2018,12,28

27,Hotel Bagues Barcelona,"First - Uber works very well in Barcelona - better than taxi. 
Hotel location perfect for sightseeing and stuff - right on La Rambla (like Santa Monica Promenade on steroids) and right next to La Boqueria (good size market place, one of the sights to visit) and by the Gothic Quarter. Plaza Real (a big square full of restaurants etc.) is only a few minutes walk. Great location, beautiful clean and modern rooms although somewhat small. Employees speak good English and they could not have been more helpful. Very good experience, great service - highly recommend.",5,2018,12,09
27,love it!,Currently staying here until the 7th December. It’s been the best part of our stay to Barcelona. The staff here are so lovely and honestly make you feel so welcome. The hotel is stunning and so is our room!  Nothing bad to say.. definitely don’t want to leave!,5,2018,12,05
27,FABULOUS,"Visited Barcelona on 30th Nov for a long weekend and we stayed in this hotel. So glad we did. What an absolutely delightful hotel. This boutique hotel is situated on the ever popular La Ramblas and has been finished to an exceptionally high standard throughout giving a very opulent feel. There is a roof top terrace where you can sip a cocktail or 2 and look out over Barcelona. The rooms are equipped with a Nespresso machine and you are given 2 complimentary capsules of coffee. Robes and slippers are provided, hairdryer too and toiletries from The White Company. This high standard is extended to the service provided by the staff. They are all lovely, from the lovely receptionist who checked us in and was there for the duration of our stay (Cannot remember her name) to the waiting staff and concierge and housekeeping - all so friendly and very helpful. At night there is a turn down service too which is a lovely touch too. You absolutely feel very welcomed, relaxed, at home and very pampered in this hotel and by the staff. Will definitely stay at this hotel when back in Barcelona.",5,2018,12,05
27,Great place to stay,"This would be the best of small Hotels I ever visited. Location is superior. Staff is above your imagination of being friendly and caring about you. Room is so clean artistic and unique. Breakfast is very good quality and it has a variety to support your interest for a good week time. 
You have to experience this place yourself. I am sure you will enjoy to meet Emmanuel, Antonella and Soungalo right at the first steps into this amazing place.",5,2018,12,05

27,3 Wonderful nights in Barcelona,"We had a wonderful 3 night stay in Barcelona. From the moment we checked in with Antonella we knew we had made the right hotel choice. We can't thank Soungalo, Richard, Mar, Emanuel, Antonella and of course Frederico, our kindred spirit, enough for making our stay so memorable. Everyone was always so helpful and offered suggestions to enjoy the beautiful city of Barcelona! Loved the decor of the hotel and the intimacy of a boutique hotel. We hope to return in the future.",5,2018,10,27

27,Outstanding Customer Service,"Every single member of staff was very friendly and helpful, with special mention to Richard made us feel so welcome every time we came back to the hotel. In addition to its excellent customer service, this is a beautifully designed boutique hotel highly recommended for the comfort and cleanliness of its rooms too. And most importantly, location could not be more convenient right on Las Ramblas in the thick of it, yet room was so quiet. I would definitely return here if in Barcelona again. Make sure you make the most of it and have a drink or two on the rooftop bar before going out to dine. Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable!",5,2018,10,22
27,Fantastic Customer Service!,"Having been delayed at the airport for 3 hours we arrived at the hotel in the middle of the night and the staff couldn't have been more wonderful, and they continued to be throughout our stay. The hotel is lovely, I would recommend.",5,2018,10,19

27,Great Find,"We asked our travel agent, Sagres Vacations ( who we met at the New York Time Travel show, held every January, for those people interested it travel), or find us small boutique hotels at every stop on out Spain and Portugal itinerary starting with Barcelona. Hotel Bagues met every criterial we asked for. It is located right on Las Ramblas...close to almost everything. The staff was like family...very helpful, and they all spoke beautiful English.

The rooms are small but comfortable. They serve breakfast every morning...buffet and a la carte eggs, etc. roof top bar with great views and a lap pool

Highly recommend this hotel, built in 1850, if you want to avoid the big hi-rise chain hotels",5,2018,10,09

27,Great hotel!,We stayed here in June 2017. The hotel interior is stunning! I have nothing bad to say about this hotel. We stayed in the suite with a private hot tub- it was gorgous! The hotel was very quiet at this time of year! We literally did not see one other guest. Would recommend!!,5,2018,09,28
27,Excellent Stay for our Honeymoon,"After just recently getting married we chose to visit Barcelona for our honeymoon. The trip from the airport to Hotel Bagues was around 30 Euro and the hotel is located centrally on ""La Rambla"". We were right next to the Gothic quarter so walking to the Cathedral and other sites was very easy. We could even reach the beach in about 15 minutes walking. We stayed in the Hotel's ""Jewel Suite"" and it was amazing. We took full advantage of the rooftop lounge, pool, and bar which overlooks La Rambla. The concierge was incredibly professional, helpful (they helped us book tickets to La Sagrada Familia, dinner, and more), and kind. My wife and I truly believe we couldn't have made a better trip to Barcelona and we account it to such an amazing stay at Hotel Bagues. Thank you to Richard (Ricardo?) at the front desk for being so friendly and accommodating to me and my wife.",5,2018,09,26

27,Perfect Location and Services ,"Location I'd perfect! Smack in the middle of Gothic Quarter. Walk to everything from here.
Hotel staff is extremely nice and very helpful. Rooms are super clean with very attentive house keeping. What ever was requested was supplied very fast. Breakfast was served daily and was worth the extra money.
Hotel decor was Beautiful....top notch.

Only issue is the rooms are very small. Overs only 2 twin size beds if need of 2 beds. 
Our room had no natural light or window to outside. Very small gym area. 2 pieces of equipment. But Gym Holmes Place is. 5 miles away. 10 min nice walk. 
If you don't mind those 2 small issues then you can't go wrong here.
Room service 24 hrs also nice to have. 
5 star 🌟 hotel 👍

27,Excellent in every way,Five plus stars. Very unique design hotel.  Loved it. Location perfect. Rooms very very quiet.  Staff was excellent.  Checked in early and a lovely tea and coffee was set up for us while we waited for our room,5,2018,09,16
27,Barca indulgence....,Staff are a credit to the hotel...their greatest asset....it’s a stunning hotel in a fabulous central location on La Rambla....the service is second to none and I will definitely stay again only this time not in a room by the lifts as the noise was so intrusive...as if other guests were physically in your room...also room service was cold on both occasions I ordered....shame as it’s a boutique hotel so guest numbers are small ...thus service should be swift....,5,2018,09,16
27,Noisey,"I would not recommend this hotel if you want a quiet nights sleep. The hotel is designed with a tall central atrium which leads to a roof top bar on the 7th floor. I am on the 3rd flood but can clearly hear an American lady bragging about how little she works and how much she get paid!!!

",1,2018,09,14
27,Great location and amazing service,"We had a Mediterranean cruise booked that started and ended in Barcelona, so we were looking for a hotel to stay at for one night before and after the cruise. Location on La Rambla was perfect and great location for walking around. Staff was exceptional with their service and even helped us with a hotel discount to do the hop on hop off bus. Our first night we stayed in a corner room on the 6th floor with a courtyard view (looking into hotel and not the street), and our second night after the cruise was on the 3rd floor overlooking La Rambla and wasn't a corner room. Both rooms were lovely, clean and spacious. The 6th floor overlooking into the hotel was definitely a lot quieter, so I would recommend requesting a corner room if noise bothers you. We actually didn't hear much noise from La Rambla except for the bell chiming every hour, and it was nice having that view. The noise that we did hear was from the hallway and people walking, talking, and opening/closing their doors. I don't think the doors are very sound proof. Despite this, I would definitely recommend this hotel, and I would also stay there again if we ever went back to Barcelona.",5,2018,09,12
27,Very nice hotel!!!,"We were in our honeymoon and we choosed Hotel Bagues. The location was perfect! So close to everywhere. Everything was so clean. The receptionists were so kind and helpful. The breakfast was awesome. Every food was so fresh and well-served. The only thing, maybe the pool could be bigger. Thanks for everything Hotel Bagues!!!",5,2018,09,10
27,A little Gem in Barcelona ,"We stayed for 2 nights in one of the Jewel Suites which was lovely and we appreciated the outside space with the jacuzzi. 

The hotel staff are really friendly and helpful and were always on hand to help and advise us about all aspects of our visit. 

We would really recommend this hotel and will be back on our next visit. ",5,2018,09,09
27,5* experience,"We had a true 5* experience. 
everything about the hotel is amazing. friendly staff 
location is perfect

my only comment would be the room offered to us was small if we want to compare it with the price we paid.",4,2018,09,09
27,Excellent Hotel in an Excellent Location,"The staff here were very welcoming and attentive. They were very helpful when we asked about the best ways to get places and the best things to do.
The room was very nicely decorated and had everything we needed. It was very quiet when the windows were closed despite being right on La Rambla.
The rooftop pool and bar is a great place to relax in the late afternoon / early evening before going out for dinner, and again the staff couldn't do enough for us.
The hotel is situated on La Rambla with a metro station a 5 minute walk away so it is very easy to get around the city from here, and the Bocqueira market a couple of minutes walk away.
There are plenty of restaurants in the nearby gothic quarter, and it's not veen a very long walk down to the seafront.
All in all it was a brilliant hotel in a birlliant location.",5,2018,09,06
27,Superb Hotel Bagues,"We stayed 3 nights in this little gem. The hotel is in a fantastic location on La Rambla and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Richard was outstanding in the service he gave us, great advice and so helpful, a credit to the hotel as were in fact all the staff. Not the cheapest but then the best never is. ",5,2018,09,06
27,Fantastic Hotel and Service!,"This is a fantastic hotel that is right on La Rambla and a 2-minute walk to the metro. The hotel staff is eager to help, and always did so with a smile. We stayed at many hotels with a jacuzzi terrace in Spain and they were not always very clean - but Bagues had a cover on their jacuzzi to ensure that it stayed clean when not in use. Whenever we return to Barcelona we will be staying at Bagues! ",5,2018,09,05
27,After the  Cruise,My husband and I had just finished a Mediterranean cruise which ended in Barcelona. We stayed at Hotel Bagues. The doorman was an absolute delight going well beyond what one would normally expect. Reception was efficient. Our room was excellent and well planned and beautifully clean. Breakfast was also very nice. We were on La Rambla but the only noise we heard was a fire engine. Absolutely no street noise. This hotel fully deserves its 5 star rating. Central to everything. We loved our time here.,5,2018,09,02
27,Exceptional service,"Wonderful and considerate help from a member of staff when I lost my jacket in the taxi from the airport, he really went out of his way to get it back.  Emailing the company and keeping us informed of his findings.  The staff were all very helpful and friendly.",5,2018,09,02
27,Fantastic location / 5 Star experuence,"We enjoyed our stay at this 5 Star hotel that lived up to its reputation. It is located on La Rambla and walking distance to Catalunya Square  (the market is 3 minutes away).  Although the weather was disappointing (there is a pool), we still managed to take advantage of the rooftop patio and bar—-great views of the city. The staff were very helpful and provided us with some great recos.  The hotel has some unique features including an impressive collection of Egyptian artifacts.  ",5,2018,09,02
27,Wonderful short break,"We had a wonderful short break at hotel bagues and couldn’t recommend it enough
On check in we recieved the warmest welcome they offered us a glass of cava and proceeded to give us a detailed introduction to Barcelona and a thorough show around our room
We also arrived to rose petals on our bed after telling the hotel it was our anniversary which was a lovely surprise
The room was lovely. Shower was massive and good amenities including nespresso coffee machine, water, robes and slipper.
Our room overlooked Las Ramblas so allowed us to have a morning coffee or evening drink overlooking the busy street which was great
The only criticism was one evening before we left for dinner two cleaners came into our room and asked us to open the bed and proceeded to collect towels we were about to leave so they could have just waited. A bit strange but didn’t deflect from the amazing trip we had
The main reason we chose this hotel was for the location and it was great to be in the centre of everything
Also the rooftop bar and pool were great although the bar wasn’t open in the day. 
We look forward to coming back to Hotel Bagues on our next trip to Barcelona",5,2018,09,02
27,Bag yourself a great base with Bagues!,"A lovely boutique hotel, right in the middle of Les Rambles but with excellent sound proofing to the street. Clean and well managed. Check in and check out was painless and efficient. The staff here are first class, so helpful. Rooms a good size, bathrooms very good. Housekeeping staff faultless. Breakfast fresh and good choice. A lovely calming hotel at the centre of the buzz that is Barcelona. The little jewellery museum is interesting and you must have  Mojito on the rooftop.",5,2018,09,01
27,Unbending staff over one hour,"I am now preparing to leave this Hotel. On checkin I confirmed my travel agent’s request for a 2pm checkout as I had meetings 10.30 until 1.15 then needed a quick shower. Told it should be ok but check in morning. I said I’d been travelling for 27 hours and for them to phone me before 9am if not ok. As I walked out at 10am for meetings I was told had to be out at 1pm. I complained that one hour for €355 for using the room for 13 hours is not unreasonable. No said the woman who said have to have room ready at 2pm. Hotel was aware that there was a message from Cruise company that I was to be picked up at 2pm.  I’d been warned off this hotel by friends who told me last month their room wasn’t ready until after 4pm. 
This is the smallest room I have stayed in for €355. Bathroom is all black and gloomy. Toilet bowl is uncomfortable - too high off ground and round which is weird. Fixed shower screen makes leaning into taps, and getting in and out, dangerous. Door is not weighted to stay open.",1,2018,09,01
27,Beautiful!!,Stayed here for two nights before leaving for a 7 day cruise. Hotel is well designed for a European hotel. Rooms are cozy and large. We had a balcony over looking La Rambla which was great. Beautiful view of the road from the rooftop with small pool. We wanted to have wine on the roof but it was pouring so the hotel let us set up in the lobby area with our drinks and snacks. Great way to start our holiday.,5,2018,08,31
27,Disappointed!! ,"Absolutely no 5 star experience. Altough most staff members tried their best, it was not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The room was not very clean, the toilet down stairs next to the reception was just plain nasty. Service during breakfast was poor, the buffet very minimalistic and the quality of the food was mediocre. Never again hotel Bagues for us. ",2,2018,08,23
27,Awesome ,I have just spent 4 nights at this hotel with family. The hotel staff are all very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The location is perfect for exploring the city but be careful of pickpockets. The roof top pool and bar were our favourite part -  my daughter had the best mojito she has ever experienced. A great experience. ,5,2018,08,22
27,Excellent hotel,Excellent location. Very friendly and helpful staff. All common areas and room very clean. Highly reccomend this hotel for families or couples who are looking for a good value for money stay in the centre of Barcelona. ,5,2018,08,18
27,amazing stay,"This lovely hotel exceeded our expectation. The lovely ladies on the front desk surpassed anything I have ever come across. They are so attentive to every detail and making, sure we where happy.They didn't miss a step when it came to comfort and feeling that they wanted you to exprence everything they had to offer",5,2018,08,15
27,Up on the roof!,"I'm so glad I booked this for our break in May half term.
First the location was perfect. It was right near the bus stop (airport and hop on, hop off). All the action was close as was right in the hub of this wonderful city. The hotel is utterly unique. Our room was compact but lovely. The breakfast was scrumptious. The rooftop pool was fabulous. It was teeny but ideal for a dip after a hard day sightseeing. It was gorgeous to go up there every day with a nice glass of Cava (or even a bottle given to me by the hotel for my birthday!)
The views from up there were stunning. I couldn't have asked for more.",5,2018,08,13
27,excellent,"a beautiful boutique hotel , on an ideal part of la rambla. the rooms are very sumptuous , having modern décor. a rain fall shower, chez longues.. bathrobes, slipppers , great wifi.

the staff are very pleasant from frederico (who makes great coffee) to the guys and girls on reception.

all in all with a beautiful roof top terrace its a lovely hotel to stay at. as a base .",5,2018,08,11
27,A gem,"This hotel is very cool, in the heart of the gothic area. The staff goes out of their way to help. There is a bar on top of the hotel with a great view.  And a bar in the lobby.  Also a little dipping pool. Restaurant sounded great but we didn't try it. Don't forget to see the farmers food Market a few doors down from the hotel.",5,2018,08,08
27,Loved this hotel!,"My friend and I stayed at this hotel as part of a girls trip. I selected this hotel based on location and reviews. I love unique, boutique hotels and Hotel Bagués was exactly that. It was a smaller, modern hotel with beautiful design and features throughout. I also liked that it honored the historic building and its previous famous jewelry designer tenant throughout. It was perfectly located on Las Ramblas a block from the Boquiera Market and a couple blocks from the Gothic Quarter.  It featured a small, quiet rooftop pool, bar and terrace where we would meet in the evening before getting ready for the night. We especially appreciated the staff who were very accommodating to us, especially Miguel (?) The bellman/man of many roles.",5,2018,08,06
27,a comfortable hotel in a central  location,do not expect all the services and facilities expected from a hotel.especially the senior reception staff were overly serious and focused on the hotel.they made a rigorous service in room cleaning and preparation,4,2018,08,01
27,Hotel was nice but not a safe place to stay @ Ramblas,"Stayed at the property for 2 nights although we had booked it for 3 nights. Our main reason for leaving the hotel and not staying the 3rd night was because the location of the hotel is not safe. My wife and I witness two people being robbed. One person got their cell phone snatched from their hands at the corner of this hotel. The other person was a 5 year old girl her back pack was taken at the Starbucks location down the street. The hotel is very aware of the situation that has gone out of control and the police do nothing about it. We would not recommend for you to stay anywhere directly on the ramblas street. 

The hotel does not provide an Iron if need to iron your clothes. They say because of a security issue we do not provide Iron but they do provide the service at a cost. We paid 15 Euros for two shirts and 1 short just ironing did not include wash.

We would not recommend this hotel if you are planing to come with your children. We would not bring our children here as we did not feel safe.",2,2018,07,30
27,Jewel Suite,"Gorgeous and big room with a great balcony.  The wall is high, so the view isn't the best, but it is very enjoyable.  The staff was just stellar and it is in a great location near a wonderful and bustling market.  Would stay here again!",5,2018,07,09
27,Hotel staff are amazing!,"Hotel staff made this an exceptional hotel experience, Olga at reception remembered every guest by name and Richard made the stay wonderful with his care and attention to detail.  Hotel is extremely clean, modern and comfy and in a great location to walk everywhere.  A wonderful stay!!",5,2018,07,01
27,"Perfecto location on Las Ramblas, beautiful design & architecture throughout.","There are a lot of wow factor features starting with that elevator! If you're ever going to have a favourite list of elevators, this could make the cut. My suite also had a stunning view over Las Ramblas from the terrace which included a private spa. The decor was luxurious and the ambience was sophisticated, tasteful and personal. The service was also impeccable. The location is perfect for shopping and exploring many of the wonderful monuments, parks, marina and gothic quarter, and I found many great places to eat nearby. Gracias por la recuerdos.",5,2018,07,01
27,"Stunning, peaceful hotel - despite being on Les Ramblas","Very pleasant, luxurious stay; the staff went out of their way to be helpful.
Breakfast was lovely and the rooms were nice and quiet - despite being on the very busy Ramblas. The reception team also organised our trips and tours very efficiently. ",5,2018,06,28
27,In the middle of things,Loved this Hotel...it literally is beautiful inside! It is on la Rambla near to the bus tours and other amenities that visitors need and love. The Staff! Great people....one of the staff members walked me to where i needed to be and help me to avoid the pick-pocket spots the area is known for. Told of where was best for breakfast and a late dinner in the evenings. Great Stuff!,5,2018,06,28
27,"Fantastic service, great location, quiet luxury, architectural interest","When planning our trip to Barcelona, I was interested in finding a great small hotel in a central location. Hotel Bagues seemed to fit the bill, but I was worried about it's location, right on La Rambla. When we arrived Olga, Chris, Soungalo and Isabella greeted us, spent time with us, orientating us to the city and the hotel. We arrived at 9:30am never expecting our room to be ready, but we were told there would only be a short wait. Chris offered us coffee or water while we waited. After only a few minutes we were escorted to our room. The hotel has so many great architectural and comfort features (including soundproof french doors), you get the benefit of (in our case, corner room) two small balconies, but none of the noise of the busy street below. No small detailed has been spared, from service (Olga called once we were settled into the room to make sure we were comfortable) to turn down service, to an ultra modern but quaint room and an awesome rooftop bar with a small pool. The building was constructed in the mid 1800's but the interior appears to have been gutted and is chocked full of interesting architectural details (interior 'courtyard', cool spiral staircase, beautiful lounge/dining area). I cannot say enough great things about this hotel. The Derby Collection appears to understand how to create and manage a great hotel.",5,2018,06,17
27,Oasis in the middle of chaos with fantastic staff!,"This hotel is in the middle of all the action of Las Ramblas.  Its a great location to meet with friends who maybe staying in other hotels because of its central nature to Gothic, Born, and Reval.  Given the amount of noise and foot traffic outside, I was shocked at how quiet my room was.  I faced Las Ramblas but could not hear anything (except for the two protest that happen on Sunday).  What makes this hotel a must is the staff and clean accommodations.  From the moment I booked my hotel, the staff emailed me immediately.  They arranged car service to and from the airport and gave me recommendations for restaurants with real, honest descriptions. Throughout my five night stay, the hotel responded to all my email questions quickly.  It made it so easy since I didn't use a travel agent and booked everything based on reviews from TripAdvisor - including this hotel!   In addition, their response time to any of my request was on the Ritz-type-level!  This was my 40th birthday celebration with friends who live all over the place, and Hotel Bagues was a huge part in making it a memorable and comfortable experience.  They even have a better espresso and breakfast option then some of the cafes.   So if you wanted a pampered hotel experience at a reasonable cost with outstanding/hospital/organized staff and a true concierge-type service - then you want Hotel Bagues!",5,2018,06,05
27,"Great location, nice hotel and fantastic service","Great location for exploring the Barcelona city. Placed at La Rambla where there are some noise, but when windows are closed it is not disturbing. Elegant and very clean hotel with a small but nice rooftop swimming pool to cool off after a long day. Among the best in service by a very friendly and helpful staff. ",5,2018,05,29
27,"Great Hotel, Fabulous Staff and Perfect Location","What a wonderful  luxurious start to our European holiday. This is a beautifully designed small oasis of elegance and calm right on one of the most interesting parts of La Rambla. After more than 30 hours travel from Australia the delightful staff immediately made us feel welcomed and cared for. Nothing was too much trouble fir them and they recommend great restaurants. The room was excellent and despite being right on the street was totally quiet and peaceful.
Fabulous",5,2018,05,21
27,Beautiful hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel right on La Rambla.  We stayed here for a few days while in Barcelona.  Once we stepped through the door, La Rambla seemed miles away.  The rooms are quiet and lovely.  The staff was really helpful, too.",5,2018,05,08
27,What a nice hotel.,"A really excellent hotel. Comfortable accommodation, very good breakfast, splendid location on the Ramblas in the city centre, and, most important,friendly helpful staff  throughout.We can certainly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,05,08
27,Fancy hotel - highly recommended,One the best hotel i have ever expierenced - perfect location - spacious rooms - lovely and helpfull staff - room service well mentained the room and the balcony view were on la rambla road and for sure will give them a visit again.,5,2018,05,02
27,Great Hotel in a Great Location!,"From check-in to check-out I was impressed. 

My room, with a balcony overlooking Las Ramblas, couldn't have been better!  The soundproofing, even along the busy and noisy street, was amazing!!!  

Comfy bed, and the pillow menu was a nice touch too!

Amazing Location! 

Well done, Hotel Bagues, I hope to visit with you again soon!",5,2018,04,30
27,"Great location, beautiful rooms, helpful staff",Loved this hotel. Lots of little extras through out the hotel. Beautifully decorated.Nice beds (firm mattress). The showers were divine. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly and the location is hard to beat.,5,2018,04,26
27,Very friendly hotel staff,We stayed at Hotel Bagues for three nights. The members of staff were very helpful and were always cheerful. I requested a gluten free diet and was delighted when I was shown the packaging of some products to ensure they were gluten free! It was like staying with friends as nothing was too much trouble.,5,2018,04,24
27,Form over function,"This lovely-looking hotel in a fantastic location definitely under-delivered when it came to functionality and value for money.

We were excited to stay at the Hotel Bagues, as we have stayed in some lovely boutique hotels in other European cities and do love the level of service and unique properties that you typically experience when staying in a boutique hotel such as this.  Unfortunately, Hotel Bagues did not live up to our expectations.

We stayed in a Jewel Suite for 3 nights, and while we loved the terrace and outdoor Jacuzzi, the room itself was small, cramped, and poorly laid out.  The couch was BESIDE the TV in a little corner by the bathroom door, so the only thing it could be used for was storing a suitcase.  Our other suitcase had to sit on the floor, and get shuffled about depending on where one wanted to stand or walk.  The bathroom door was glass, offering no privacy whatsoever.  The shower stall was so small I couldn't even raise my arms over my head to wash my hair.  And the large rectangular sink was almost completely flat, so the water/hair/toothpaste didn't drain out, it just sat there!  The pictures of this room on the website and TripAdvisor did not represent the reality of the awkward layout and cramped space well.

And all that for a very hefty price!  Even with the terrace, I believe the room was over-priced for what we got, even with the perfect location and pleasant décor.",5,2018,04,23
27,Wonderful Stay in Barcelona,"Loved the hotel and location. Could get anywhere we wanted to go very easily.  The breakfast was delicious and made to order. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful.  Loved the view from the roof top, but it was a little cold!.  ",5,2018,04,20
27,Great location & hotel,"We stayed in December and found the location of the hotel to be perfect to explore from.  The staff, service and hotel were great and we would stay here again if in the area.  The rooms were clean and modern.",5,2018,04,14
27,Great location and staff,Location was in middle of Las Ramblas and as soon as we stepped into the hotel we felt at home and pampered.  Rooftop deck was great to have a drink and relax.  Staff had great recommendations and were helpful in planning everything we did.  I would recommend to anyone who wants to enjoy Barcelona.  Tapas and drinks at Canete should not be missed.,5,2018,04,01
27,Perfection ,"Hotel Bagues is a beautiful hotel, in a perfect location for exploring the delights of Barcelona. The fantastic food market is a stones throw away, which was perfect for breakfast and all main attractions, including the beach, were a pleasant walk away, we got the metro to Park Güell which very simple to navigate.

Las Ramblas is quite ‘touristy’ but it is well signposted from all over the city which made it easy to find our way back to the hotel. The windows were effective in keeping the noise out. 

The staff were incredibly helpful and the room was very luxurious, with new white company toiletries and a a red rose in the bathroom each day. The shower head was huge and very powerful, there was an espresso machine in the bedroom and you got a chocolate treat by your pillow each night.  The rooftop bar offered stunning views of the city, particularly at sunset. It was an accumulation of all these little things that made for a perfect stay. 

We visited a friend in the ‘Arts Hotel’
by the beach on the last day but hands down preferred the location and character of Hotel Bagues - though the Arts Hotel did have a nice, large pool.

Would definitely stay in this hotel again

",5,2018,04,01
27,A Really Cool Hotel,"I stayed here to start my journey in Spain and once again after exploring Spain I stayed here again before leaving. The staff is very professional and friendly and treat you like family.  The rooms are small but very clean and well organized. The location is right in the heart of the action.  Even though the hotel is in the middle of a busy part of La Rambla the rooms are still fairly quiet and sleep quality was good for me.  Staff member Richard was awesome and went above and beyond to provide assistance with a smile.  Breakfast was delicious.  After returning from Spain, I recommended this hotel for my mother to stay at on her visit to Spain next month, that is how highly I think of it.  Well done Hotel Bagues!",5,2018,03,27
27,In the middle of La Rambla,"Very nice Hotel with nice staff and with a fantastic location!
Stayed for a long weekend in wonderful room, not very big, but whith a view over La Rambla and in th center of everything! 
The reception is very nice and helpful!",5,2018,03,26
27,Hotel Bagues,This is a wonderful little hotel in a great location on Las Rambles.  The front desk helped with reservations and tickets to several sites including Park Guell and the desk was staffed 24 hours a day.  We were especially grateful for their help arranging transportation to the airport for a very early flight.  ,5,2018,03,22
27,Perfect,"This is a really lovely little boutique hotel about 25 mins from the airport. Its situated bang on and in the middle of La Rambla so you can walk to most of the main attractions. The market is just meters away and a treat to visit. There is an underground train station just a few steps away when you need it to go farther afield to look at the cathedral and the castle. We stayed in a jewel suit for 3 nights and it was well presented if a little compact but I think most of the rooms in hotels around would be on the small side as the buildings are mainly period. Housekeeping were great and kept the room perfectly clean and tidy for us.  The overall interior of the hotel has been decorated and furnished to a very high standard so its quality rather than quantity. On the roof there is a bar and very small pool with a good view of the street below. Breakfast at the hotel was small buffet and al a carte order. Limited to turnover and space but perfectly done. Everything I would have wanted was there, eggs bacon and sausage were delicious. You really must try the sausage it was totally delicious. All of the staff without exception were friendly, knowledgeable and fun. A lovely lady on reception has some great non-tourist restaurants to recommend and reasonably priced. I would recommend this hotel and will no doubt be returning for another stay next year.",5,2018,03,18
27,tranquillity on the Ramblas.,what an oasis. the moment you step through the door you are away from the bustle of the Ramblas and in your own haven. perfect reception for any traveller and a pleasure to have in the centre of Barcelona. very helpful and courteous staff who make you stay feel very special.,5,2018,03,10
27,"Really good, but not perfect","Stayed for four nights in early March with my brother in a twin room. The hotel is located ideally on La Ramblas (which BTW is very touristy and not classy) so it is well placed for walking around city. The room was really funky but didn’t like the internal location which made it feel dark and a little bit claustrophobic. The toilet seat was unusually high and strange! The rooftop pool was cool but incredibly small and wouldn’t be any good at all to swim in! Otherwise the rooftop was nice and offered  good views of La Ramblas and the city. All the staff were very friendly and happy to help. Didn’t eat or drink here so can’t comment on that aspect.

Overall it was a great stay and would recommend your try it.",4,2018,03,05
27,What boutique hotels are supposed to be,"The entrance to this small hotel has a low profile but it's in a perfect location for getting around, it is walking distance to many of the good sites and la Rambla is right outside the front door. The room was not huge but it was very comfortable, the bathroom was a good size with a nice sink and walk-in shower. The staff are as good as you'll find anywhere; extremely helpful and always smiling. If you like small and sophisticated hotels, this is one of them.",4,2018,02,17
27,The best,"I enjoy my stay at bagues hotel the location is fantastic everything very close to you shopping,Resturants the sea the Rambla street It was wonderful experience the only thing I didn’t like is the price of the room ,but really it deserves it",5,2018,02,14
27,The Best in Barcelona!,"Hotel Bagues and entire staff is fantastic! Excellent service, gorgeous room with terrace jacuzzi,  perfect and quiet location on La Rambla which is convenient and walkable  to most everything. Can’t wait to return!",5,2018,02,13
27,Hotel Bagues,"We have recently returned from our weekend trip and first visit to Barcelona. We stayed at the '5 star' Boutique Hotel, Bagues, which is part of the Derby Hotel Group. When arriving we were greeted with a warm and friendly welcome. The Hotel has a feeling of being a 'family-run' hotel, as it is so intimate and only has approx 32 rooms in total. 'Check-in' was swift and we were given a complimentary drink on arrival too. One of the concierge staff members we really want to mention is, Richard! Upon our arrival, he took time to show us around the Hotel, which include a visit to the roof top terrace, which does have fantastic views of Barcelona. The Hotel is situated right in the ""middle of everything"" on Las Ramblas and our room had a view overlooking the old/gothic part of the town. Our Room was on the 4th Floor (404) and we stayed in a Deluxe Room. The rooms are not huge, but are fitted with high quality fixtures and fittings, including elaborate wall-panelling and tiles in the bathroom. Our room had everything you would need to ensure a comfortable stay including: dressing-gowns, (free) tea & coffee making facilities, a mini-bar, hair-dryer, flat-screen TV, complimentary bottles of water and a great view over-looking La Ramba. We witnessed several 'colourful/musical parades that went right past our window, another example of the excellent location of this hotel. The breakfast was first class, the rooms are genuinely excellent, the staff can't do enough for you, the decor is highly designed and outstanding and this Hotel, is truly one of the best Hotels we have ever stayed in (and we have stayed in many fine hotels) and therefore, we have made a promise to ourselves to return to Bagues, Barcelona asap!",5,2018,02,13
27,Great small hotel with perfect location,"Lovely small hotel in the perfect spot. Walkable to all of the old town, water, etc. Staff is great. Found a restaurant with the bottle of wine I really wanted. Excellent value for money. Have paid way more for much less other places.",5,2018,02,04
27,Location & Luxury,Hotel Bagues is located on Le Rambla opposite the old ‘Gothic’ centre of Barcelona & just down from Plaça Catalunya so it’s ground zero for tourists! The hotel is modern & although the rooms aren’t large by western standards they are very comfortable & well appointed. The service is of a high standard with the front desk team always on hand to assist. We didn’t eat in the hotel as there are just so many choices within a 5 minute walk outside. I highly recommend Hotel Bagues to anyone visiting Barcelona!,5,2018,02,03
27,Perfect boutique hotel,"From the moment we arrived at this boutique hotel we knew we’d made the right choice. We were greeted by friendly helpful staff who spoke English very well. We were greeted with complimentary champagne and a bottle of wine in our room.

The hotel itself is in an very central location, is beautifully decorated and very clean. The gym is small, but who has time to gym in Barcelona!! There is also a steam room which we didn’t get time to use, although it looked great. The roof top bar was very inviting and despite the cool weather, enjoyed a beverage up there and took in the view.  The photos included are of our bathroom (which was soooooooo impressive), outside our room window, the hotel dining areas and the rooftop. Highly recommended hotel, will definitely go again. ",5,2018,01,23
27,Great Hotel with Wonderful Staff,"This is a beautiful hotel with artful and impeccably clean rooms. The location is right at the Gothic area which is a great walking neighborhood with lots of history, restaurants, etc. . The best part of the stay was the wonderful multilingual staff. They worked very closely with us to make train reservations to other parts of Spain which isn't a easy process if you are not actually at a train station. They saved our trip to Granada by telling us to get reservations for the Alhambra a head of time, which we weren't planning on doing.",5,2018,01,22
27,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Service","This hotel is absolutely stunning, from the design to even the scent (it smells gorgeous!). 

We had a suite, which was on the 6th floor. The room was spacious and beautifully decorated, with ample lighting and blackout curtains. The amenities in the bathroom were from the White Company. The rain shower was lovely to wake up to in the morning. There was a jacuzzi bath on our terrace, which was lovely to wind down to after a long day of walking around in the city. The bed was firm and comfortable, allowing us to properly recharge every night. Since we had a suite, we had water replenished daily and a welcome bottle of wine. 

The staff were very helpful and gave us a great overview of the city when we arrived. We were able to purchase our hop on hop off bus vouchers from the hotel, which enabled us to save €2. On our first night, we did not receive the complimentary water but this was quickly resolved with a call to the front desk. 

The location of the hotel is perfect, as many of the main attractions are within walking distance, but it is also close by to a metro station and bus stops (including a hop-on hop-off bus stop). There are also various restaurants and places to eat nearby, including a Starbucks. 

Overall, there is not much to fault about this hotel. The only minor faults I can think of were that prior to staying, I was in contact with the hotel to arrange something special for my partner's birthday and the hotel said they would do something complimentary, but this was not the case, although this could be due to some confusion in the correspondence. Also, it would be good if there was some lights nearer to the jacuzzi as it is a little bit dark around that spot at night time. Another thing was that there were no plug sockets near to our bed, which was a little bit inconvenient. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this hotel and will certainly be staying here again when I visit Barcelona once more,",5,2018,01,22
27,"Central Location, Great Service, Nice Room","This hotel is centrally located and well designed, although it is a bit dark inside. The rooftop, however, is bright and features great views of the city. My room was beautiful (again, a little dark, but still nicely designed), and the service was excellent throughout the hotel. ",4,2018,01,22
27,The perfect base for a Barcelona break,"This hotel was exactly what we were looking for - luxurious without being overpriced. Staff were welcoming from the very beginning and got us off to an excellent start. Loved the miniature balcony, chic bathroom, excellent location and very comfortable room. The only downsides were that the gym was not really enough to be classed as a gym, breakfast was extraordinarily expensive and not included and the coffee capsules were not replaced. However, these were not really an issue and didn’t affect the quality of the hotel, which was outstanding. Definitely would stay again. ",4,2018,01,20
27,Almost 5*,"Stunning hotel, with almost everything you need except a kettle and tea bags!!
Breakfast was not included and was rather expensive so we did not add it on. 
Perfect location.
Beautiful room and bathroom. 
Lovely staff. 
Shame the bar on the top floor was closed as weather was lovely despite it being January. 
Almost perfect and would definitely recommend for a city break.
Must note we booked as a last minute deal so very good price, however unsure as to price normally. ",4,2018,01,20

The reception guys was LOVELY, every single one was so helpful and smiling.  All in all this was a perfect stay for us.  Thank you Bagues!",5,2018,01,19
27,One of the best hotel stays ever,"This hotel is simply gorgeous.  Unlike some reviews I didn't find the rooms small and we had 8 bags of luggage and only a superior room.  Also the bathroom was very well lit.
The bed and pillows were the best I have ever experienced and I slept wonderfully.
Also you could not fault the staff from the friendly & helpful reception to the fantastic bar man - Adrian. 
I highly recommend this hotel and the location is perfect.  This will be the only place I will stay in Barcelona from now on",5,2018,01,11
27,Nice hotel & friendly staff,Good location & all staff friendly to helping us for our stay. Easy to go everywhere within walking distance. Many restaurants behind our hotel area. Feel well & safe to walk to Main Street even at night. I'm sure I will stay again in my next journey ,5,2017,12,14
27,Bagues on Rambla,"We will return!! Ideal location for walking just about anywhere you would like to walk to in Barcelona.
They serve a really delicious breakfast. We had a very quiet room overlooking a church. the service was instant and complete.",5,2017,11,25
27,Real gem,"Simply amazing hotel. No complaints at all. Jewel suite was great. Very nice reception. Amazingly close to everything literally. La Ramblas was not that busy because of the season and maybe Catalonian political issues, but people there were very friendly and helpful.",5,2017,11,20
27,Excellent Boutique Hotel Right on La Rambla - Immaculate and Perfectly Decorated - Roof Top Terrace,"Highly recommend this premium boutique hotel.  It is very modern, including the bathroom, very nicely decorated, has nice amenities in the rooms, and is immaculately clean and centrally located close to almost everything and steps away from Boqueria Market.  High end stores and restaurants close by, as well as more modest local establishments.  Very easy to get to many tourist sites without the need for a car or taxi.  Public transportation is just steps away if needed.  Would stay here again.  Staff are very welcoming and helpful.",5,2017,11,18
27,GREAT Hotel,"You can't beat the location of this hotel.  But even better, i don't think you will find a friendlier and more helpful staff.  I have been all over the world and i put this hotel on my top 3 list.  Aside from the perfect location and fabulous staff, the rooms were clean,  breakfast was delicious (and the woman with the british accent that serves is fantastic) and rooftop has incredible views. You will not be sorry choosing this hotel.  I will recommend it to all my friends visiting Barcelona.",5,2017,11,16
27,Fantastic Hotel & location,"The hotel rooms were fantastic & the location perfect for our short stay in Barcelona. We would definitely stay in this hotel again.

Everything is walking distance from this hotel & when tired of walking it’s lovely to sit & watch the people go by from the lobby bar. ",5,2017,11,15
27,Characteristics and Charming!,"Hotel Bagues a boutique hotel situated on La Rambla offers a beautiful set up as everything becomes walking distance from it. Surrounded by Cafe’s, shops, restaurants, museums. The narrow cobbled streets bring character to the whole area.
The entire staff from the front desk onwards is most polite, helpful and courteous.
We just had to ask and everything was provided. 
I would recommend this hotel to all my friends and family and come again if the opportunity rose!
",5,2017,11,13
27,One word: Spectacular!!!,"We absolutely loved our stay here! We were greeted with the warmest welcome from the staff who were so attentive and friendly throughout the entire stay. We even had a couple of phone calls to the room to check if we needed anything. Every time we returned to the hotel from being out and about we were greeted so warmly by the doormen and reception staff it was wonderful and made us feel like we were at home. Not to mention the yummy treats by the reception desk that were always tempting. Our hotel room was beautiful and modern, especially the gorgeous bathroom. The beds and pillows were beautiful and comfortable. We were on Floor 5 with a lovely view of La Rambla and amazing soundproof windows to block out the hustle bustle. The location of the hotel was perfect and easy to get to everything. The value for money here was absolutely amazing. Loved it so much here. We were sad to leave and can’t wait to return! Thank you Hotel Bagues!!!",5,2017,11,09
27,Hotel Bagues - great hotel in a fantastic location,"Had a fabulous few days at Hotel Bagues in Barcelona.  The hotel was great - stylish, spotlessly clean and comfortable with a wonderful shower.  My only complaint is that the lighting wasn't good enough for applying make up.  The location of the hotel couldn't be better - right in the heart of Las Ramblas and the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly.",5,2017,11,09
27,A sparkling jewel,"Hotel Bagues is truly a sparkling jewel, this small boutique hotel is not only beautiful but it is everything that you would want for your stay in Barcelona. The location on La Rambla is ideal and so convenient to all the great restaurants and attractions, and every employee so kind and helpful, everyday whenever we returned we felt as if we were returning home as we were greeted with warm welcomes and smiles every time. Our room on the 6th floor was lovely and quiet against the bustling street below.  I loved the bathroom and furnishings as well as the little turndown chocolates we received. We also so enjoyed sitting out and eating lunch from the close by market (La Boqueria)on our private terrace. The rooftop terrace and view is also spectacular. I would definitely recommend Hotel Bagues for a Barcelona stay and I look forward to visiting other hotels in the Derby Collection as well.",5,2017,11,02
27,Love you hotel wonderful staff,"We had a great stay at Bagués. The atmosphere was lovely, the breakfast was very good, the rooftop terrace was beautiful at sunset and a nice escape from the bustle of la Rambla below. The location was perfect for exploring town. What really made this hotel stand out was the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. They were all wonderful and accommodating and a lot of fun. We would recommend Bagués Hotel.",5,2017,11,01
27,A little gem in the heart of Barcelona,"Right on Last Ramblas, this wonderful 5-star hotel is a cool haven of delights. From the roof-top swimming pool down to the simple ground-floor restaurant and reception, this hotel is a must for those who seek elegance and luxury. Although dark for some tastes, it contains valuable works of art throughout. Great showers and some rooms have jacuzzi baths. The only downside was the noise and vibration from the nearby metro.",4,2017,10,29
27,Excellent location with very friendly and helpful staff.,"Great hotel on the main pesdestrian street in Barcelona. Perfect location for tourists. Very friendly and helpful staff. Small room but very modern and clean. The design of the rooms is poor in that the bathroom doors are glass and if one person gets up to use the bathroom or take a shower they are going to wake up anyone else in the room. ""King size"" bed was really two twin beds next to each other. ",5,2017,10,19
27,Nice place in the middle of everything.....with super friendly staff!,"This is a cool little hotel right on Ramblas. The front desk and door people are all very friendly and helpful. We had tours booked but they mapped out our two day stay for us which was was huge for us as first time visitors. 

We had a room overloooking the street but it was very quiet with the windows closed and it allowed us to soak in the atmosphere with them open. 

Very clean and seems recently renovated.",5,2017,10,16
27,Jewel of a Place,"Hotel Bagues has exquisite attention to detail, engaging and caring staff, and wonderful amenities.  I recently stayed for a long weekend on a familiarisation trip.  I received an upgrade when I arrived, and the accommodation was spectacular.  The hotel has a sweet restaurant on the ground floor, with fabulous food and drinks.  Breakfast is not to be missed - fresh local yogurts, cured meats, cheeses, gorgeous fruits, delightful breads, and more - the dry rice porridge with raisins, nuts, and more is tasty indeed.  

The toiletries include sleep spray, and the hotel has a pillow menu.  My room (403) had a lovely work of art in a recessed niche in the wall, as well as two mini balconies from which to watch both La Ramblas and the cross street.  Mar and the rest of the staff couldn't do enough to help me with any and all issues - tickets, reservations, dining and touring suggestions.  

I will be going back to Barcelona in the spring, and will definitely stay at Hotel Bagues - wouldn't have it any other way!!",5,2017,10,16
27,A great hotel near Las Ramblas in Barcelona!,This is a great hotel in the heart of Barcelona.  The rooms were very nice and clean and well appointed.  The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay.  Richard the Concierge/Bellman was absolutely outstanding.,5,2017,10,13
27,Bagues tries really hard to be a 5 star but just misses the mark,It is a lovely hotel in a perfect location and the staff could not be more helpful.  We stayed for 4 nights in a very small room with no window which was very claustrophobic and offered no natural light at all - even with the lights on it was very dark - we asked to be moved but apparently there were no other available rooms.  The bathroom whilst well fitted out offered absolutely no privacy with just a glass door between it and the bedroom.  There is a nespresso coffee machine in the room but as I don't drink coffee I asked for a cup and a teabag so I could make some tea for which I was charged for - makes no sense to me!!  There is no real space to relax at the hotel - the reception area has a very small couch and that is it besides the rooftop area which the weather didn't always allow sitting up there after a long day of walking an sightseeing.  ,3,2017,10,12
27,Between 3 / 4 star ,"The location is very handy walk out the front door and you are in the thick of things .
The staff were very helpful .
We were in 306 room size was very good , it is a corner room with a fridge safe and 2 small balconies .

The bathroom is not at all private with a see through glass door and did not suit our other party in a twin share room with seperate beds .Tha bathrooms have a massive vanity good if you want to bath a baby but leaves no room for you to put your makeup etc .

There is no mirror in the bedroom to use when drying your hair or putting your make up on .

Bed comfort hard but clean .",3,2017,10,09
27,"Good hotel, very nice staff but a little too small for us",Lovely hotel with great staff but as the hotel is so small the common areas for guests are very limited which is fine if you are out all the time but sometimes we found areas to relax within the hotel very limited ,5,2017,10,02
27,Fun in Barcelona,"The hotel is situated on La Rambla right in the middle of everything - shops, theatres etc.  The hotel staff were fabulous and helpful.  I went to the Rolling Stones concert - amazing!
I would go and stay at the hotel again.",5,2017,09,30
27,Honeymoon Couple,"we received amazing service from the staff and hotel bagues, they couldn't of done more for us, we received a complimentary bottle of champagne and truffles to kick off our honeymoon and we enjoyed it by watching everyone go by from our room on las ramblas, we ill definitely be back and would definitely recommend to friends, ",5,2017,09,25
27,Perfect location and gorgeous hotel!,"We stayed for three nights at the end of our cruise.  Right in the heart of La Rambla and the rooftop bar and pool were so perfect at the end of long days walking the city.  The staff was very accommodating and helped us with printing show tickets, flagging down taxis and running drinks and food up to the roof.  Only issue was the bathrooms are awfully dark, gorgeous though!",5,2017,09,24
27,Excellent stay at Bagues in Barcelona,"We had a great stay at the Bagues in Barcelona.  The staff was excellent, very helpful and provided lots of useful information and directions.  The room was very large  and the bed comfortable.  We had an enjoyable stay and will recommend it to friends.",5,2017,09,23
27,Greeted by drunk tourists behind reception desk,"Upon arrival I was greeted by 2 drunk tourists staggering behind the reception desk with the night porter!
Room smelled of cigarettes smoke.
No place for suitcases in room.
No rack or hanging space for towels in bathroom.
No mirror in bedroom.

27,Beautiful Boutique Hotel at La Rambla,"First stop of our Europe trip at the beautiful Barcelona we stayed at this small but beautifully decorated boutique hotel at la rambla. Reception area was small as expected for a boutique hotel but staff were efficient and friendly. Swift check in. Marbled stairs are useful than the 2 lifts one 4-5 persone another 7-8 person one I think.

Breakfast was nice although same items every day. We had cereals with milk, ordered fried eggs, omelette with toast, espresso, variety of cheese etc. 

Rooms were small as expected for a boutique hotel but with a view of La Rambla street. Bathrooms were small but beautiful with shower and bathtub together. Espresso machine with coffee pods were provided.

Location is a big point for this hotel as it is a very good location at La Rambla the main attraction at Barcelona. Eateries are all nearby. Taxis are easily available so it was very convenient.",5,2017,09,13
27,Nice boutique hotel in great location,"Nice hotel in a great location. Not a 5*, more of a 4* in the U.K. Roof Bar and Pool very disappointing. Staff very friendly and helpful. Comfortable, elegant (but smallish) rooms. We didn't use the Restaurant which looked expensive and very quiet.",3,2017,09,12
27,Centrally located hotel,"We were drawn to the boutique style of hotel and booked direct with the Hotel Bagues many months ago. As mentioned by others the hotel is situated on La Rambla, a bustling tourist epicentre of Barcelona. You can easily walk to the beach from the hotel and there is a tube station within a minutes walk of the entrance. The hotel,  although on a very busy street is quiet thanks to some good sound insulating doors to the small balcony.

The room was well appointed and the bathroom very nice, small but boutique small, so nice. There were a couple of things I would mentioned, no iron or board and no kettle for tea. One was promised but it never arrived. Also the storage space hangers, cupboards etc were slightly lacking. The TV was to the side of the bed, so not easy to watch if on the bed. The bed and pillows were very comfy.

Water and a nice turn down service arrived daily and the staff were exemplary. You could not fault much at all.

Along with others I would like to mention the terror attack, I congratulate our Spanish friends for their resilience and I would never let an incident like this change my plans. We are all together as one, for a world free of terror. You will never succeed.

",4,2017,09,11
27,"Boutique , trendy & very friendly","What a fantastic little hotel in the centre of Barcelonas busiest street. Staff were exceptional. The food and bar service also of a high standard. We loved this hotel and would stay here again. I've stayed in hotels all over the globe, Bagues is unique and offered a more personal stay than some of the larger chains.",5,2017,09,11
27,Ideal Barcelona location ,This hotel is high quality and centrally located. The staff are very obliging and go out of their way to assist with directions and other advice. Breakfast is excellent and rooftop bar is very relaxing at the end of the day.,5,2017,09,06
27,Amazing hotel. Excellent and resilient staff!,"I stayed at the hotel between the 14-21.08.2017. Deluxe room. 5th fl. Facing the street. Location is best. The hotel has a relaxing ambiance bubbled from the hectic La Rambla. Boutique. Chique. Top quality. The room is very beautiful with all the necessary amenities provided by a 5 star hotel. Quiet - double glazing windows. The bed comfy. The bathroom is gorgeous and very well organized - incl. bath, shower and bidet. Clean to perfection. The staff of the hotel is top notch: attentive, polite, extremely kind, helpful, professional, perfect English. Of the best I have experienced worldwide. Great restaurant downstairs.That's part 1.

Part 2. On 17.08.17 La Rambla, BCN was attacked by jihadi terrorists - as you all know. The hotel located at the epicenter of the attack. The van rammed into the pedestrians just in front of the hotel, under our windows. Dozens of people fled from the street for safety into the hotel. Even though shocked, the staff were highly resilient and compassionate. Took attentive care of the frightened men, women and children. Provided them with shelter and food, throughout the curfew, that lasted several hours.

Summing up 1 and 2, the hotel is amazing, and my people experience with the staff gets a big WOW. Thank you Bagues.",5,2017,09,02
27,Beautiful hotel....best yet,"Hotel Bagues is simply the best hotel we have stayed in, the attentive staff, the decor and the whole vibe of the place is unsurpassed. 

We visited Hotel Bagues to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday and we were not dissapointed. We were greeted with a bottle of wine and birthday chocolates in our room and the restaurant prepared a beautiful Happy 50th birthday dessert to celebrate. 

We were alarmed to find that we had forgotten our Sagrada de Familia entrance tickets at home. We resigned ourselves to the fact we would have to purchase some more but the hotel reception took time to  contact the attraction on our behalf and confirmed that they had our booking and organised for us to pickup duplicate tickets at the ticket office. This was over and beyond what we expected and we were truly grateful.

Visit this beautiful hotel, you will not be disappointed.",5,2017,09,02
27,honeymoon in barcelona,"My wife and I loved our stay in the hotel, the location was perfect. Right on La Rambla next to the market and close to the beaches and amazing restaurants. The hotel was near public transit making traveling throughout the city and outside of the city very easy. It was the perfect location to enjoy the tourist areas, while also being easy to escape the busy tourist areas and enjoy a more authentic vacation.
The hotel itself was beautiful and with very clean rooms and amenities. Above all the staff was very helpful with everything we needed within the hotel but also with sugguestions on places to go, things to see and most importantly the best restaurants",5,2017,08,25
27,Lovely Boutique hotel,"A beautifully stylish hotel. The rooms and gorgeous and decorated to a very high standard. A good hotel for couples as it had a very romantic feel to it. The location is also great as it is on La Rambla. It is not a cheap to stay there but the service was to a very high standard and everything about the hotel felt luxurious.

If there is one negative is that the roof top terrace is very small with only a few chairs and sun loungers and the pool is very very small. If you are looking for a spacious roof top terrace with a pool to swim in then this is not the best.",5,2017,08,22
27,Personal and perfect,"Took family to Bagues and had a wonderful time. A good hotel is characterised by it's staff and the Bagues is blessed with just that - great staff. I needed three rooms (for parents and teenagers!)so it was a fair bit of money but actually looking back it was well spent. It all comes down to service. Not only remembering names and details but allowing two teenage girls to leave luggage all day after checking out and then have a shower and freshen up before sorting onward transport. They went above and beyond duty and showed a caring side. 
The rooms were good, the beds comfortable, la rambla was quiet and the roof terrace lovely.
I Am already under pressure to return!
Well done Hotel Bagues and thank you!
S",5,2017,08,21
27,Wonderful hotel,"The Hotel Bagues is a wonderful hotel for couples. It is perfectly located in central Barcelona on La Rambla close to the Gothic town and many of the sights.
The interior design of the hotel, fitted inside an historic building, has been very carefully and splendidly considered right down to the last detail although some of it may not be to everyone's taste (black bathrooms anyone?)! 
The rooms are relatively small but are perfectly adequate and comfortable. Being critical I would say that there is insufficient storage space for clothes. We had to leave many of our clothes in our suitcases.
The major strength of the hotel is its staff. They are completely amazing - nothing is too much trouble. We had to leave very early on our last day due to industrial trouble at the airport and because breakfast service hadn't started they brought a 'picnic' to our room without being asked.  And I have to say that the housekeeping staff are the most thorough that I have ever experienced. The rooms are immaculately kept.
The restaurant has an interesting menu and the food is extremely good and not expensive. The wine list is similarly good and the waiter always managed to recommend just the right wine!
There is a bar on the roof with good views across the city and which opens late, quite a pleasant place to spend a summer evening.
I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,08,13
27,Great hotel ,"Spent 3 nights at this hotel early August and have zero regrets . Perfect location , value for money , room size is decent for a hotel in Europe. Staff is very helpful and friendly . The only negative would be late night noise which was weird because most of the time I couldn't here anything from the busy streets below but late at night especially on one of my night was very noisy I could only guess that this was probably hotel guests.  . Despite this I would definitely stay again if I travel to Barcelona ",5,2017,08,07
27,Best brunch in town,"Great place for lunch, awesome price and mimosas and servers are great. I had poached eggs and buffet bar. Best location. Servers are super nice, make sure to tip Eduardo and Nerea. The food is great value for the price and the location has beautiful decoration ",5,2017,08,07
27,Amazing breakfast ,We had an absolutely wonderful brunch here! Nerea and Eduardo were so accommodating and friendly! Service and food are top notch. It's a hidden gem at an unbelievable price. Can't wait to come back! Highly recommend! ,5,2017,08,07
27,Excellent location for a first time visitor,"This was a beautiful hotel, the employees were all very helpful, the breakfast and restaurant was very good.  The location of the hotel was a perfect location, we walked everywhere and when it was too far a bus or taxi was extremely easy to catch.  The night life can get loud so request to not face the street.",5,2017,08,02
27,Simply brilliant ,"We loved this hotel.  The staff super friendly, the location just perfect in the centre of Barcelona.  The room was perfect  -  king size bed, with comfy pillows and crisp linen plus sizeable bathroom. The breakfast menu is both continental and hot menu.  The roof top bar and swimming pool offers great views of the city.   They also offer a shower facility post check out in the downstairs gym.  Great hotel definitely recommend. 
",5,2017,07,31
27,Wonderful experience,"After disembarking from our Oceania cruise, we spent 2 eventful days in Barcelona to cap off our vacation. The Hotel Bagues, located on La Rambla, was a perfect location for walking around. The front desk staff could not have been more helpful, and the restaurant staff was excellent, as was the food. We were supposed to have a car pick us up at the hotel to take us to the airport, and we asked the front desk staff to please confirm it for us. Turns out that our flight was moved up an hour, so, they had to call the driver and ask him to get there earlier. I think everyone at the front desk got involved in this task from finding the number to waiting on hold. They were terrific!
I'm sure I may have missed some names here, but, thanks go to Avelino, Jorge, Anastasia, Fabio, Nicolas, Soungalo, the friendly doorman, and Eder and Marco, the restaurant staff. Heartily recommend this fine establishment.",5,2017,07,27
27,perfect boutique hotel with great staff,"My wife & I went to Barcelona to celebrate our anniversary, and the hotel very kindly upgraded us to a suite! The hotel is so well appointed and the rooftop bar is the perfect place to spend an evening.
The staff were ever so helpful and accommodating, I cannot thank them enough!
It's perfectly located on La Rambla only a few minutes' walk from the amazing La Boqueria market; indeed most of the interesting sights in Barcelona were within walkable distance.

I would give this hotel 6 stars if I could!",5,2017,07,24
27,Loving Barcelona and Bagues has the perfect location and service,"My wife and I always prefer the smaller boutique hotels when we travel and this one did not let us down.  Most important to us is service and the staff here is exceptional.  Though small, they really look after every detail and make sure you are comfortable and secure.  The staff is very helpful from helping book excursions to tips on the best places to eat, shop and when to do what.  I believe there are only 30 rooms at this hotel.  We had a 3rd floor room with a small balcony overlooking La Ramblas. The room was probably entry level, thus very small, but we have been in smaller.  You can hear the Metro below the hotel for the lower floor rooms.  We heard it on the 3rd floor, but it was honestly not a bother and never disturbed our sleep - maybe because we were so exhausted every evening.  The 6th floor rooms are the jacuzzi suites.  The roof top bar is very quiet, as it is primarily hotel guest.  The pool is really just to sit around and soak your feet while having cocktails.  Nice place for a drink before you head out for the evening.

The hotel location is very secure with many police patrolling the area.  You are in the center of La Ramblas and in the heart of the Gothic quarter, so everything is at your finger tips from shops to restaurants to the La Boqueria market, which is almost next door.  You are also a very short walk from the Metro, which proves invaluable for visits to Sagrada Família and Park Güell.

Our recommendation for your visit would be to dig deep into the Gothic quarter for  restaurants and shops, not the ones right on La Ramblas.  They are so much more intimate and really help you enjoy the culture.   Also, if you want to eat close to the hotel, go behind the catholic church just next door and there is a square there with great restaurants and really nice atmosphere.  So close and mostly locals.  We had dinner and drinks at Bar Lobo.  We also really enjoyed the tranquility of Gats after a crazy long walking day.  It was nice to find peace and great eats so close to our hotel.  Both of these places are in this square.

Important tips:

If you have Verizon - the $10/day travel plan is awesome - no data/call/text limits
Call your credit and debit card companies before travelling to avoid purchase stops.
Don't get euros in US - simply use ATM machine at airport in Spain & avoid ALL fees.
Don't forget your electrical converters - bring extras for charging multiple devices.
Barcelona has pickpockets. Women - bags in front, Men - wallets in front pockets",5,2017,07,20
27,Lovely boutique hotel - wouldn't say it's 5 stars ,"This is a boutique hotel, but doesn't quite live up to the 5 star rating. 

The room is nice (entry level rooms are small, which is what we had). There wasn't really anywhere to put your suitcase, let alone 2 of them! 

One of the good things was that the toilet is self enclosed meaning one of us could be in the shower or using the sink which didn't prevent access for the other one to the loo if you like privacy. 

The main disappointment was breakfast. We stayed at other boutique 5 star hotels on the same trip which were streets ahead with breakfast service. The hot food is cooked to order, but to be honest wasn't that nice. The bacon was really fatty and greasy, the eggs also greasier than fried eggs elsewhere. On our first day, the order was delivered wrong. Also, I'm pretty sure the hot mushrooms were from a can.  Fresh fruit was rarely topped up while we were there, so we missed out on some. They only put out 4 small croissants at a time, so often they were all gone too unless you waited around for a bit. 

The location is great. Walking distance from many of the sights, and a metro close by. Good sound proofing in our room which faced the Ramblas. Overall staff were good. 

We'd stay somewhere else next time. ",4,2017,07,17
27,Great outdoor space ,"We upgraded our room and got an outside jacuzzi and patio area that we used every day.  So worth the extra charge!  Fantastic staff!!!!!---I cannot begin to say how awesome they were..making sure our every need was looked after and taken care of..great restaurant recommendations!
Highly recommend!!",5,2017,07,16
27,Best of Barcelona,"Hotel Bagues is an exceptional stopping point for anyone visiting Barcelona. Exceptional service tending to all of your needs and very comfortable. The restaurant, El Regelando, is exceptional for breakfast or dinner and with a creative menu equal to any that my wife and I had experienced during our first trip to Europe that included a 10-day cruise.",5,2017,07,10
27,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff, great location!","This is a beautiful hotel. Perfect location in the heart the Ramblas - there are amazing cafes and restaurants around and you can easily walk to some of the Gothic Quarter's most interesting squares, museums and churches. The Bocheria market was just a short walk away too.
We were celebrating a birthday and an anniversary just before Valentines Day this year and we found the hotel room had been decorated with rose petals for us and we had some bubbles on ice waiting for us when we arrived.
Our superior room was fairly compact but with plenty of room for two, it was spotlessly clean and had good storage, a very comfortable bed, a large bathroom and a balcony overlooking the Ramblas below. The room was very quiet. There was an iPod dock and speaker and a TV.
There is a small gym, a steam room and a roof terrace with a small pool. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant as there were plenty of tapas bars round about.
The hotel is stunning and the staff are super-friendly and very helpful. We didn't want to leave. I would highly recommend staying at Hotel Bagues! We will definitely be back!",5,2017,06,28
27,Magical Boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"After a less than impressive stay at a  contemporary hotel on the beach we were fortunate enough day two to be able to switch to the Hotel Bagues in the centre of town. . This is a world class boutique hotel that could go shoulder to shoulder with the best in the world. Situated in the heart of the city on  ""La Rambla"", Hotel Bagues boasts small but very elegant rooms. wonderful views, a lovely roof top terrace overlooking the gothic quarter ,adorned with a small dipping pool and rooftop bar, and within walking access to pretty well most of the city. Exceptional service is their strong card to be sure. . ""Richard"" the doorman was our first touchpoint and his attention to detail and level of care and service was something any Hotelier would be proud of . The rest of the staff were equally exceptional and thoughtful at every level. I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else next time I visit this dynamic city. I commend our travel agent Franca Cuzzupe from Marlin Travel in Canada for booking us into this unique find.",5,2017,06,26
27,Stylish and very well located,"Overall, I really enjoyed my time here - the roof top bar and tiny pool being a huge asset in the summer heat. The hotel could provide some basic information/recommendations on Barcelona for first time visitors especially.  Some of the reception staff are not well enough experienced in suggesting worthwhile restaurants and in giving clear and precise directions. The breakfast staff: Nerea, Tantita and Paul were so friendly and efficient (as were all the other restaurant and bar staff) which was a happy start to my day.  Room 102 is directly above the kitchen and is subject to some slight disturbance from this room in the morning. An intimate boutique hotel with warmth and charm.",4,2017,06,26
27,Great Hotel,"The hotel staff were great! They recommended a great restaurant for Paella.  Our room was ready before checking time!  The only issue we encountered was that the shower's water temperature was not consistent during a shower, it would slightly fluctuate between cold and hot while taking a shower.",5,2017,06,25
27,Amazing hotel in a great location,"The hotel is great, our room was lovely and overlooked La Rambla, little balcony too for watching the hustle and bustle below. The staff were all very friendly, really attentive and helpful for tourist info/cocktail bar recommendations and booking restaurants/cabs. The breakfast is fantastic! La Bocqueria is a moments walk away. Pool and bar on the rooftop are great for a bit of chill time after a day exploring, stunning views up there too.",5,2017,06,25
27,Hotel Bagues Luxury in the Gothic Quarter,"recently we stayed it the Suite at Hotel Bagues. The room was wonderful, with a private balcony with table and chairs and a Jacuzzi. The suite with balcony was just below the top floor (Top floor is pool with bar-wonderful) It was great to watch the people below walk by on the La Rambla. The Hotel staff was great and accommodating with our numerous requests. They hailed our taxis and tucked us in. 

The great story here is that this Hotel use to be a jewelry shop and workshop. The historic piece are on display on the second floor and are absolutely stunning. 
This is close to everything, we walked everywhere. People are walking and strolling at 3am. Great Hotel, and reasonably priced.",5,2017,06,24
27,Utterly charming and knowledgeable staff,"We appreciated the soundproofed window overlooking La Rambla along with an excellent blackout curtain.  All aspects of our stay were excellent the thing that really made it special for us was the charm and personalities of the concierge staff.  They were cultured, knowledgeable and so much fun.  Shout out to Enrique Paves Jimenez who gave us amazing input on the continuation of our trip to his beloved Andalusia.  ",5,2017,06,20
27,Great location and excellent service,The friendliest and most helpful staff that I encountered in multiple hotels across Spain.  Nicely appointed rooms.  Very quiet due to soundproofing and thick windows.  The location on La Rambla was excellent and close to 2 metro stations.  This is a great jumping off point to see Barcelona while offering luxury at the end of a busy day.  It is also close to La Bouqueria.  Pick up fruit and cheese to enjoy with a bottle of wine in the room!,5,2017,06,19
27,"Fantastic stay, staff very accommodating","Booked this hotel for 3 nights as a surprise for my partners 30th, and would stay again. The hotel is in a perfect location right on Las Ramblas, was surprised how quiet the room was considering we were right on the street. Room was on the small side but very clean and the night time truffles were a nice touch. The hotel also gave us a free bottle of champagne to help with the birthday celebrations.",4,2017,06,19
27,Mr. Pierre Nasr,"Very nice place for couples who wish to renew their love. 
Overall excellent standards, best hotel ever visited. Location in the center of la rambla street, restaurants and all the facilities are nearby.",5,2017,06,12
27,Very nice stay,"Optimal Location at Las Ramblas. Nevertheless quiet rooms thanks to double windows even if you have a room with street view. Very elegant rooms. Friendly staff. Swimming pool at the roof top, but very small.",5,2017,06,06
27,Excellent Customer service,"This room was booked at the last minute due to having to leave our previous hotel early due to unsuitability.

When we arrived the reception staff were very welcoming and smiley. We were shown our room which I have to say is small, but I expected this as it clearly states the size on the description.

However, the room had everything you would need, we were in room 602 and it was furnished really nice with the most amazing shower and patio doors leading onto a rooftop terrace with Jacuzzi and beds.

Just after arriving, the staff had a bottle of wine and chocolate truffles sent up to our room.

The breakfast was really nice with everything you would need.
We ate in the restaurant that evening and choose the taster menu. This was really nice and gave us the chance to try things new.

When we go back to Barcelona we will definitely stay here again and I would just like to say that the W Barcelona could do with sending their staff here as they would learn a thing or two about good customer service. (See my next review)

Well done to all the staff.",5,2017,06,06
27,Luxury Hotel overlooking Las Ramblas,"This is a small luxury hotel overlooking Las Ramblas in the heart of Barcelona. The rooms are small, but exquisitely decorated. Despite the noise and bustle outside, the rooms are very quiet, and we overlooked Las Ramblas. The roof top (with narrow pool) is lovely to sit out on. The staff are excellent. It is very easy to walk out from here almost anywhere, with lots of places to eat and drink nearby. The free ""sweetie"" containers in the entrance, were a nice touch, if rather too tempting even for adults! Highly recommended.",5,2017,06,04
27,Location A+,"Small luxury boutique hotel on a corner of Las Ramblas . great location to walk to all major sights and shopping. 
Rooms are chic and modern but a bit tight for a suite.
Nice breakfast and willing staff.
Lovely lap pool on the roof with great city views and well as views from our patio",4,2017,06,01
27,We thought the Hyatt was fancy.,"My wife and I recently stayed at Hotel Bagues in Barcelona.
My goodness ,this place is incredible! The staff are incredibly helpful,the hotel is absolutely beautiful as far as design goes,tending to be a bit on the quirky side,almost over the top,maybe not to some people's taste,but hey,where in Barcelona!
It is situated on La Rambla,which is crazy busy,and also we are only 50 metres from the main market,and over the road you enter the old gothic area ,where there are numerous small boutiques and artisans.
It is definitely not the cheapest hotel in Barcelona,but it is well worth a stay.
The small rooftop terrace is nice of an evening to have a drink ,watch over the city,and hear the bustling crowd on La Rambla.
There are also many real Cantalan tapas bars in the area ,but ,if you want these,don't go looking on La Rambla,they are only designed for the tourists,and sometimes the quality is quite poor.
",5,2017,06,01
27,Amazing Client Service,"Overall I was extremely impressed with this hotel. To state the obvious, it is a pricey hotel, quite pricey. But my major takeaway from this hotel was the unparalleled client service provided. I made a small notes many months in advance that we were celebrating a wedding anniversary, and a bottle of cava greeted us at check in. English was spoken very well by the staff. One evening, the upstairs rooftop bar (not opened for service yet but great for a pre-dinner drink) had already been closed but a simple ask and they went all the way up to open it for us.

Check in and out was quick and efficient. Amenities at the hotel were top notch, shower was good. The room was small (it's Europe), but very well decorated and had incredible views of Ramblas. If you can afford the price, I strongly recommend this hotel. From our entire trip in Europe and multiple properties, the service I received here was second to none. They will not disappoint.

Some other things: Ramblas is a very very busy area, with lots of noise late into the night. The room was still fairly quiet, but could hear noise from outside. Be prepared for that. Location is just steps from La Boqueria and next to the old gothic district. Cannot beat this location for central Barcelona exploration.",5,2017,05,31
27,First trip to Barcelona,"Stayed here prior to our Mediterranean cruise and absolutely loved it. Lovely boutique hotel right in the heart of La Rambla and a block from La Boqueria market. All of the staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly, especially Richard. On the way back from our cruise our flight was canceled and we stayed there again because we loved it so much. They were just so accommodating. The restaurant in the hotel is fantastic as well, best Sangria ever! I see now why everyone raves about Barcelona. Beautiful city and we will be back......and stay at Hotel Bagues again. ",5,2017,05,28
27,"Perfect location, beautiful hotel, impeccable service","My BF and I stayed at the hotel from May 14-17, and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The hotel itself is beautiful appointed, the rooms are beautiful (although I must say, the bed was too firm for our liking but we have found this all over Spain), and the location simply can't be beat.  The staff went out of their way to welcome us and even helped to procure a rental car for the next leg of our journey.  Thank you so much for making our stay in Barcelona comfortable and very special!",5,2017,05,24
27,Stunning Boutique Hotel in perfect Location,"We Loved our stay at Hotel Bagués In Barcelona.  Beautiful Boutique hotel, excellent service and very friendly and helpful staff in a Perfect Location, on La Rambla and walking distance to Gracia and the beach! Will definitely recommend and stay here again! Thank YOU! ",5,2017,05,22
27,Barcelona May17,"Great location and standard of hotel; just be aware standard rooms are internal with no windows so very, very dark even with lights on! Also glass door to bathroom so no privacy so need to be on very good terms with whoever you travel with!",5,2017,05,22
27,Awsome Stay,"Absolutely delightful boutique hotel....booked randomly and ended up to be a great choice, will never go anywhere else when we visit Barcelona again. Super nice and helpful staff who constantly do the extra length to keep everybody happy.
Amazing location in the heart of town and walking distance to almost everything and all activities. Rooms are slightly small but enough, very adequate and have all of what anybody needs. 
The interior and finishings are a story to talk about, the building was beautifully refurbished and I would give 10/10 to the designers and all teams who did the renovations at the time....super attention to details. 
Absolutly our local hotel for whenever we come to Barcelona again. Very well recommended place without doubt.",5,2017,05,20
27,loved Barcelona,Great location close to shopping and restaurants loved the people and it had a great atmosphere the hotel was very clean and had a french feel about it friendly and helpful staff with good information on tours and restaurants,4,2017,05,19
27,Wonderful stay,This is an extremely friendly hotel with staff very welcoming and helpful. Rooms are lavishly appointed and really quiet  (despite being in the middle of las Ramblas). Amazing views from the rooftop terrace and would love to stay again!,5,2017,05,16
27,Made Barcelona a great experience ,"Staff is excellent. Interior is stunningly beautiful. Excellently located. Our room faced La Rambla with great view but noise was zero. Could have used more drawers in room is only minus.  Adjacent restaurant was also first rate. 
",5,2017,05,13
27,Great service!,Very nice staff a the reception. We had to print our tickets fot the football match Fc Barcelona -Villa Real. We were not a guest at the hotel but asked for an internet cafe on the Ramblas. The staff hesitated not a moment and were very kind to print our tickets. Next time we go to Barcelona we book this hotel. Great location and very nice people!!,5,2017,05,10
27,5* and more,"Went to the Bagues for my husbands 40th and we certainly did not regret choosing this hotel. Local, staff, room were absolutely fantastic. If you are looking at this hotel for your visit, book it, you will not be disappointed.",5,2017,05,02
27,Fantastic stay!  ,"We stayed at Hotel Bagues April 26-30. We arrived early in the day, and the front desk was very helpful and rearranged our room so we could get in right away. This was nice since we both felt like we needed to refresh after a day of travel. We were moved to a room on the front of the hotel, facing La Ramblas. The windows are soundproof, and keep out most of the noise, but we like in Manhattan so we are used to some sounds all night. If you are particularly sensitive to sound, ask for a room on the side or back of the building. 

We had mentioned that it was a trip form our anniversary, and the hotel very kindly provided a complimentary bottle of Cava and chocolates. This was a very pleasant surprise. 

The room is small but there was room for everything.  The rose in the bathroom is a nice touch. The mattress was a bit hard for my liking, and we could not seem to get the temperature of the room low enough for our liking. This is what drops the rating from 5 to 4. ",5,2017,04,29
27,"Location ideal, but value less so","We were initially charmed by the property's unique design features and loved the location, so chose it for a recent stay.  Alas, the realities of the property do not support the pricing - the room, though lovely, did not accommodate two regular sized suitcases well, and left us moving things around constantly.  A thoughtful card that allowed us to order morning coffee delivered was completed, but the staff never collected it over night.  At the price point, a breakfast included would have been nice, but was priced at roughly three times other local establishments.  All in all, a nice hotel, but for the quality of service and amenities provided, not worthy of a repeat visit.",3,2017,04,28
27,So disappointed !,"Location extra , can not be better. Lots of food, market, restaurant within 2 minutes walk. Big negative is that you hear everything happening on the floor, people walking by with heels, talking, etc. We were on floor 6, in a jewel suite. Only 3 others rooms on that floor and noise from corridor was not pleasant. Concierge/butler Robert was AMAZING , but reception staff that day were below average, condescendant almost , didnt seem to care about clients, were laughing between them in spanish thinking that we wouldn't understand that they were saying that room was ready but didnt want to gibe it to us even taught we were supposed to have early check in with that room. First impression is a lot and it fails at that hotel. Also picture of rooms on website where not room we were given. explanation was that there as 2 and we got the other one.. the one where the sofa is NEXT to tv and not in front of so totally useless . There was also no special jewelry piece in the room as mentioned on website, i was told it was because of a turnover ... but even butler had never seen one in this room ... Stayed at The Hotel Do prior to cruise and wold definitely go back there again but never to Bagues . First impression means the  world to a hotel reputation",1,2017,04,27
27,rewarding stay,"we arrived for a two night stay at this boutique hotel on the Ramblas. Situated in the right spot to be able to access the main areas and very near to the must visit Market. The staff are excellent and gave advice as to where to eat and to visit. The rooms were excellent and we slept very well on the comfortable bed. Although situated on the Ramblas there was no noticeable noise. I recommend this hotel for it's location, comfort and wonderful ambiance.",5,2017,04,27
27,Bagues on the Rambla,"Very convenient location; courteous and helpful staff. Despite being directly on the Rambla, room was extremely quiet. Rooftop sitting area nice for evening cocktails. Room could use a bit more lighting. Beautiful modern bathroom",5,2017,04,26
27,Weekend in Barcelona,"Everything was great. The crew was most kind and helpful. The Hotel is located in the best position in La Rambla, Barcelona.
We would like the pool on the roof to be warm, but its really not that important. ",5,2017,04,25
27,Fantastic hotel in a great location,We spent three days at Hotel Bagues and found the everything about the hotel and the service to be absolutely excellent. Every member of staff was friendly and helpful. The location is a perfect as base for exploring the city sights.,5,2017,04,24
27,Most memorable trip,"Bagues hotel is a cute boutique hotel situated in the heart of the historic Gothic area of Barcelona on the most famous street, La Rambla.  
The Hotel is clean, rooms are fair in size. What bothered us most was the lack of lighting in the room and bathroom.  The interior is all in black and the lighting was dim and not sufficient which made it uncomfortable for us to spend any time in the room except to get ready to sleep or get out.  The breakfast buffet was limited but the waiters were efficient and very friendly and our eggs and coffee were done to our liking.",4,2017,04,21
27,Beautiful Hotel in Excellent Location,"Beautiful 5* Hotel decorated in Art Nouveau style,ideally situated in La Rambla.
The rooms are comfortable and spotlessly clean, ours had a lovely balcony and the bathroom was
stunning.
It has a lovely roof terrace with great views and a lap pool.
The staff are exceptionally helpful and kind. 
Highly recommended",5,2017,04,18
27,Trendy with perfect Location,"I had no idea about Barcelona & thanks to tripadvisor reviews I picked this hotel.
Perfect location to everything. I was abit worried they wouldn't be open as our arrival time was 12.45am yet greeted with smiling, friendly & informative service...they give you a little card with all the security warnings too which is great to know.

Location: sooo handy & right on La Rambla which is fun. Come out of hotel, turn right & 50 mtrs is famous fresh food market; turn left & 50mtrs is starbucks; across road is supermarket & souvenirs; short distance to left is metro & hop on/off bus; marina a stroll to the right.

Rooms: I asked for great views & they delivered with balcony overlooking La Rambla..great for people watching that goes all day & most of night. Modern rooms with very comfortable mattress & cloud like pillows. With all reviews about dark room it makes a change from the usual hotel rooms & crisp, white sheets set it off. Large window/door to balcony brings in lots of light during day so not dull at all. We booked superior double which was a touch small if you have your suitcases open. Not much spare room as had 2 small chairs & table to relax by window. Soundproof window so didn't hear much street noise.

Bathroom: Felt like Bruce Wayne's luxurious batcave bathrooom..earthy tiling & trendy. Great huge rainshower head. Toilet alittle high(you'll find out once staying here!) & at times wiffy, nothing a few regular flushes doesn't solve. Huge, white fluffy towels.

Coffee pod expresso machine, yet no tea so bring your own if your travelling hotel to hotel & can still make with machine.

Roof Terrace is a great bonus. As just starting high season most times we had this to ourselves, great to relax with a glass of wine after long day sightseeing. Seeing all the rooftops & steeples lightup at night or watching the sights below on La Rambla.

We didn't add breakfast (even though got cheaper offer at checkin) as planned to eat at market(not open on sundays) & cheap deals up/down La Rambla.

All in all great stay, great hotel, pleasant friendly staff & modern facilities....perfectly located.",5,2017,04,17
27,Absolutely wonderful,"We arrived at the hotel to be greeted by a lovely receptionist who checked us in and explained the map. He asked if we had any plans for that night and if we needed any recommendations. Both gentleman at reception were great and were genuinely friendly. 

We were shown to our suite (Jewel Suite room 602). The room was lovely and our balcony looked over La Rambla. The sound proofing in the room was great. We felt vibrations every so often from the metro, but this couldn't be helped and didn't affect our stay. There was a complimentary bottle of red wine and chocolate truffles which was a lovely welcoming touch. The Jacuzzi on the balcony could be filled up with hot water and was nice, although my boyfriend would have preferred this a bit more powerful. There was a sun lounge area with a table and chairs and some nice plants too. There was a cover that came over the Jacuzzi for privacy from the roof top terrace.

The waterfall shower was lovely. Bathroom came complete with a bath and a large sink with a fresh rose on the side. The room was nice and spacious and came complete with everything that you would need. 2 small suggestions that I would make would be to have either a larger bin in the bathroom or another small bin in the lounge area as one small bin was not enough. Secondly, a full size mirror would have been good. 

The hotel is spotlessly clean all over with a great aroma. 

We didn't opt for breakfast, nor eat at the hotel restaurant although this did look good. The rooftop bar wasn't open but we were assured if we wanted a drink, we could use the phone up there and drinks would be brought up. The rooftop was lovely, we didn't use the pool but used the sun loungers late afternoon. The terrace gets the sun until about 6pm. 

We took a bottle of wine back to the hotel and asked for a corkscrew and a couple of glasses to be brought up and these were with us within a couple of minutes. Nothing is too much trouble for the hotel staff who are all extremely helpful. 

Wifi was free and had a good connection all over the hotel.

Our flight was not until late evening. We asked to keep our room on. They said that they could extend this another hour however no later. They kept our luggage and advised that we could use the gym downstairs, lock the door and have exclusive access to have a shower and change. 

Perfect location. I would recommend 9Nine and Canete to eat which I have reviewed separately. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2017,04,16
27,Second visit,"Excellent location and service again from Hotel Bagues. Rooms are cost but very comfortable. Great showers. The welcome is excellent and approach very helpful. 

My only fault would be the mattresses feel a little spongey and the pillows the same. I would prefer feathers/down. ",5,2017,04,15
27,Wonderful breakaway place in a great location,"Stayed for 4 wonderful nights in a suite on the 6th floor. Small Luxury Hotels of the world? Absolutely!! Personal service in a unique place, great restaurant and roof top terrace are musts when you stay here. Very friendly staff, nothing too much. ",5,2017,04,14
27,Hotel stay before cruise,"This hotel was amazing!  The service was outstanding.  We couldn't have asked for more. The location, right on La Rambla was perfect.  We had a lovely view of a church across the street and the streets of Barcelona. It is conveniently located near a local, fresh market,  a must see.  The breakfast was delicious, and I'd definitely recommend it. After check out, it was a short taxi ride to the port.  If you are looking for a hotel to use before leaving on a cruise, this is the one for you.",5,2017,04,11
27,great location,"lovely boutique hotel  very central to everything small intimate very clean and beautifully appointed rooms even had a red rose in the bathroom.
I cant say enough about the friendly helpful staff especially Richard .De Silva nothing a problem. They made us feel special. The rooftop terrace was a lovely spot to chill out and look out over La Rambla would stay there again",5,2017,04,07
27,Perfectly located ,"This hotel ticks all the boxes for a city break . Totally unpretentious, immaculately clean and very comfortable . Very accommodating well trained staff . Avoid internal room - we did get a change . Luxurious linen , bathrobes etc . 
Breakfast at the famous market  nearby ( a couple of doors down ) is a must !!! Unique experience. Very secure and on the doorstep of good restaurants , sightseeing , shopping . ",5,2017,04,06
27,25th Wedding anniversary,"We had the best time staying at Hotel Bagues, the staff were so friendly and helpful as this was our fist visit to Barcelona.  The hotel room was to a very high standard, the breakfast for cooked fresh when you ordered and was outstanding.  Thank you to all the staff, you are amazing!",5,2017,04,03
27,Fantastic city break,"Excellent room, lovely hotel staff - extremely helpful about where to eat etc. Good atmosphere, and we loved the roof top terrace too, I even managed a swim in March! The sound proofing was brilliant, so you are right in the middle of everything but not bothered by it either. We look forward to coming back - there is too much to enjoy in Barcelona not to make a return trip. ",5,2017,04,02
27,Fantastic hotel,We have just returned home from Hotel Bagues. We stayed for three nights but wish it had been for longer.  I cannot praise the staff enough. They were so helpful and accommodating and nothing was a trouble. They booked tickets for us to visit Sagrada Familiar which saved us from  queing. We had dinner on our Anniversary night which was superb. The room was smaller than I thought it would be but it was so comfortable and immaculately clean. The hotel is so central for sightseeing. 5 minutes from Catalunya square and 30 minute walk straight down to the sea front.  We will definitely return to Barcelona as we really enjoyed ourselves.,5,2017,04,01
27,Perfect Location!,"For our first trip to Barcelona we could not have picked a better location!  So close to walking to everywhere!   The staff was SO KIND and helpful!  One of our favorite things to do was to walk outside the door, turn right and within 2 minutes we were walking through the market!  Great for breakfast and afternoon snacks!  Beds were nice, rooms were comfortable.  Glass bathroom doors don't provide much privacy, but we survived.  Workout room is super tiny, but we didn't choose the hotel for that.  The helpful front desk provided us with a map and directions to everything we were trying to find.  Would definitely return to this hotel!",5,2017,03,31
27,Beautiful Hotel in the Heart of downtown,The Reception Staff took care of us fabulous!  Everything they suggested for us turned out perfect.  We chose to have breakfast with our booking and very happy that we did.  The actual room was beautiful with a rain shower to enjoy and towels large enough to wrap two in.  Loved It so very much!,5,2017,03,31
27,Super Hotel ...,"Our first visit to Barcelona and we were not disappointed with this great little hotel. Situated directly on La Rambla with easy access to all the sights of the city and surrounding areas.

The service here is top end, the guys on the front desk are excellent, happy to help with directions, attraction tickets and dinner recommendations. The rooms are quirky and offer great views of La Rambla.

Only downside is there is no bar area, however this appears to be due to lack of space in this beautiful old building.

Would definitely stay here again if returning to Barcelona and wouldn't hesitate to recommend.",5,2017,03,31
27,Great location for a city break,"Spent 3 nights at this lovely hotel. After an initial hiccup with a room with no window, our adjusted accommodations were just the job. Overlooking La Rambla, with good triple glazing, we enjoyed a peaceful stay. (The metro runs all night and some vibrations were felt in our 2nd floor room but it did not spoil anything). The addition of breakfast at a reduced rate of €16 worked well for us but the kitchen were a little lacking as they served items out of sync and ran out of tea bags! The staff on reception were really good and very helpful with both advice on how to get to various tourist destinations and printing our boarding passes. Overall, this is a great hotel in a wonderful city.",4,2017,03,19
27,Great spot to stay,"Initially we were allocated a room that was very dark and the window looked onto a dark wall. We phoned reception and were quickly taken to another overlooking Las Ramblas, much better. The beds were very comfortable and apart from the metro rumble  from under the hotel the soundproofing was great. We didn't try the rooftop splash pool, not quite warm enough in March.The reception staff were all very cheerful, helpful and knowledgeable.

Our only criticism was in regard to breakfast; the tomatoes I ordered with my eggs arrived after I'd eaten the eggs and the next morning my friends toast arrived late and there were no English Breakfast tea bags available only earl grey or herbal.

The location is great,  close to buses and the metro and perfect to walk to the harbour, the gothic area, markets etc.",4,2017,03,19
27,THE EXCELLENT BAGUES HOTEL,"We would definitely recommend this hotel. The service and attention to detail by all the staff was first class nothing was too much trouble.The room was excellent and comfortable with a view over the la rambles just what we wanted. It was my wife's B/D on our visit and the hotel made a special effort to celebrate the fact, this was much appreciated. A wonderful long weekend break .A big thankyou to all the staff.!!  ",5,2017,03,16
27,Classy boutique hotel in centre of it all,"Hotel is located right in the centre of busy La Rambla street. Steps from all the action and many interesting sites and neighbourhoods. The room sound proofing is very good and the street noises never disturbed us at all. Though the rooms are a bit on the smaller side, the decor and design elements are high quality and aesthetically pleasing. Staff are very attentive. Location, quality and great service make this a very good option to be in easy reach of everything.",5,2017,03,16
27,A Perfect Three Days in Barcelona,"If you are looking for a great location to stay in Barcelona with a helpful staff and comfortable room, look no further.  I can't say enough great things about this hotel.  The staff was extremely helpful weather it came to checking in a few hours early or assistance in finding a dinner spot.  The rooms were comfortable and very quiet.  I did not hear any outside noise.  The location was perfect and most nights we explored the Gothic Quarters of the city. The only negative was the glass bathroom door.  I was traveling with my daughter so we were able to manage but that may be a deal breaker for some folks traveling together.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2017,03,14
27,Highly Recommended,"Hotel ‘Bargues’ was beautiful, really conveniently located, the staff great and the roof terrace with pool a total joy (despite it being a bit chilly for a dip in March) – we were well looked after.  

The beds were soooo comfortable as were the multitude of pillows....I'm really gonna miss them all *sigh*.  

Our party had 4 rooms booked, they were all a little different; ours had a bidet and shower over the bath, another had a wonderful walk in shower, all had inbuilt leather sofa/ loungers and balconies - perfect for smokers.

I was amazed at how sound proof the glazing was, as the hotel is right on Las Ramblas I thought we may suffer but it was great.  I wish the same could be said for the internal hall way noise; fortunately this wasn't a problem for us but you can hear people talking as they walk past so if you get a rowdy group it could be an issue.

We decided against paying for breakfast in the hotel (but my friends said it was great). There's a Starbucks just down the road and we discovered some really cool brunch places within 8 minutes walk.  (also reviewed by flipsidenavigator on Tripadvisor).

I highly recommend Hotel Bagues, this was my 3rd trip to Barcelona and the convenient location, creature comforts and kindness of staff helped to make this my best visit ever.",5,2017,03,13
27,Short Business trip to Barcelona,"Excellent service and treatment received; from the Hotel Management, Maria Rosa, going through Jorge at Reception desk, Room Service (I do not remember well the name of the girl in the afternoon, I think it was Rita - Argentinian) and the new Concierge - an Hindu guy. The room (on the second floor facing the Ramblas) and the views from the terrace at the seventh floor are great. Superb location!",4,2017,03,13
27,Nice stay,Nice and small hotel in top location. Stylish design and friendly service. We had a wonderful stay for 4 nights in one of the suites. All major attractions in walking distance or at leat the metro is very close. The Ramblas are too much low touristic level. But the Barri Gotic and Barcelonette offers so many nice restaurants. Not enough time to give the nice looking restaurant of the hotel a chance. Staff was very nice and helpful but not all of them at the level we would expect in this hotel category. ,4,2017,03,12
27,Perfect weekend escape ,"Everything from check in to the quality of the suite and staff was excellent. One of the best welcomes from reception staff we've ever had and the hotel was peaceful and relaxing.

Roses and champagne like I requested along with a complimentary bottle of red wine were waiting for us and the location on La Rambla was ideal.

We will be back!",5,2017,03,12
27,Very Helpful Staff,"Apart from the central location the most overwhelming points about this hotel are the very very helpful staff, they booked us excursions and restaurants and advised on many things, I wish one of them was my PA. The hotel is not cheap and I would have hoped for a larger room for the money [I hate to shower in the bath] we had a 5th floor corner room on La Rambla [a bit noisy but that's what this part of the city is] The food in the restaurant was a bit Foam & Dots but tasty and the service immaculate, as is custom in parts of Spain lunch is not served until 1.30pm and dinner 8.30pm.",4,2017,03,05
27,Barcelona birthday,"The central location of the hotel is fantastic, the soundproof windows are exceptionally good. We were not disturbed by the hubbub of the busy street below. At check in, the reception staff were very helpful and welcoming. We enjoyed a room upgrade and a complimentary bottle of cava. As we were celebrating my birthday, this was an extra special touch that made our stay even more memorable. This was our first visit to Barcelona and due to the friendly and helpful attitude of all the staff, we would not hesitate to return. ",5,2017,02,26
27,Wonderful!!,"We met friends from England in Barcelona and Hotel Bagues couldn't have been a better choice!  Staff was very helpful with directions and suggestions, location is perfect,  and the rooms are wonderful!  A little small by American standards but the amenities and design more than make up for it!  It took me about 5 minutes to figure out how the shower worked, but it was great once I did.  Thanks to the staff for all there help!  You can be sure we will stay at Hotel Bagues if we ever get back to Barcelona!",5,2017,02,24
27,Jewel on Las Ramblas,"Wonderful location, beautiful small boutique hotel, staff takes great care of you!!!  Continental breakfast is delicious!  Just around the corner from the Boqueria Market and across from the Gothic quarter!  Worth the stay!!  Rooftop bar!!",5,2017,02,22
27,Wonderful hotel in Barcelona,"Fantastic hotel, great location on Las Ramblas in the old quarter. Staff was incredible, very friendly and helpful. The rooms are beautifully appointed, very elegant in a dark, high tech way - a bit on the small side, but not excessively so for Europe. Had a wonderful stay here, and will definitely return the next time I'm in Spain. Lots of nice touches, free water in the room, truffles at the turn down services, and a single perfect red rose. Didn't try the restaurant, as there were too many interesting restaurants & tapas bars in the area. ",5,2017,02,19
27,Boutique hotel,"This boutique hotel is in a great location with helpful, friendly staff who really made us feel special.  Room was small but comfortable. Check out Arume restaurant down the street from the hotel, best meal we had in Barcelona. ",5,2017,02,19
27,Excellent boutique hotel,"I stayed here for four nights with my husband and two teenage daughters. Great location in the middle of la Rambla and sound proofed windows so no noise! Would definitely recommend a room with a view as our daughters had a room overlooking the central atrium of the hotel with no windows which made it a bit claustrophobic.
Breakfast was good with plenty of choice and hot food from the menu.
White company toiletries, sweets and a weather forecast left each night was a nice touch.
Would definitely recommend this hotel!",4,2017,02,19
27,Short city break - perfect hotel and location,"My wife and I stayed here for two nights/three days in February 2017.  We found the hotel via the website Luxury Small Hotels Of The World (recommend you try them - they're very good themselves!).

The hotel's location is perfect for exploring the city of Barcelona, located on La Rambla with restaurants, bars, the market, museums, tourist attractions all within walking distance.  For the other tourist attractions a bit further out, the Metro (tube) is very close by - so the whole city is at your disposal.

The hotel is billed as 4 star - I'd certainly agree with that.  It's very smart, lovely rooms and the customer service is second to none.  Do take a visit up to the top (7th) floor as there's a plunge pool and bar and fantastic views!  When they noticed it was my birthday they very nicely left a complimentary bottle of wine in our room!

We decided not to use their restaurant for breakfast as we prefer finding local cafes and to be fair their breakfast, while providing a huge choice, was we thought rather expensive at €23 each (although if we had if for two or more days, it was reduced to something like €16 each from memory).

Check out by 12 noon was also really helpful and appreciated as this allowed a full morning's exploring and still being able to freshen up before leaving.  The hotel were more than happy to let us use their gym facilities to shower if we wanted to freshen up after 12 noon (and look after our luggage as well).

Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,02,17
27,Best hotel in Barcelona,"The staff at this hotel was the most helpful and informed I have ever experienced. The location of the hotel is right across from the Placa Reial and a few minutes walk from the water. It was February when we visited, and the boardwalks were filled with kiosks to eat, with heaters, very inviting. The hotel staff was so helpful with restaurant recommendations, when we arrived we were treated like royalty, including ordering a taxi to return to the hotel. We could not have been treated better. To date, this is my favorite hotel. ",5,2017,02,16
27,Excellent staff and attention to detail,"This is a great Hotel. Very well situated and excellent staff. Smooth and attentive, would highly recommend. Located in the middle of La Rambla so everything is close to walk, but when you shut the window you would never know!",5,2017,02,15
27,Fabulous hotel in central location!,"This is a fabulous hotel ideally placed in the very centre of Barcelona. The staff were welcoming, professional. and helpful. Our room was reasonably spacious and, while the decor was not to our taste, it was classy and well-maintained. The double glazing and black out curtain ensured no noise from the busy street below disturbed our slumbers. The bed was wide with white linens and plenty of pillows with, thank goodness, no dubious hotel cushions. The bathroom was roomy with a large shower cubicle with both rainfall and standard shower heads and supplied with lovely White Company toiletries which were replenished daily.  An espresso machine and pods were in the room and we requested a kettle and teabags which were cheerfully supplied. Complimentary bottled water  was supplied daily. Altogether a great hotel with lovely staff to which we will return should we revisit Barcelona.",5,2017,02,12
27,Beautiful hotel and lovely friendly staff,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in the jewel suite. The hotel was stunning and in the centre of Barcelona, had stunning views of the city, the hot tub was a very nice to chill in after busy days in the city. From the moment we arrived the staff made us feel welcome and ensured all our needs were met, the hotel was not massive but that was a plus as it made it more personal and the staff knew and called us by name from day one. I have nothing bad to say about this stay and will be defiantly recommending this hotel to family and friends, if I ever return I will also book this hotel again! Thank you for a lovely city break ",5,2017,02,11
27,Great hotel with exceptional staff and position,"This hotel in the centre of Barcelona has a 5 star rating and deserves it, especially for the service it's staff give.  As a city centre hotel it is confined by its size so do not expect massive rooms. They are adequate and well decorated. Expect a comfortable bed, choice of pillows, turn down service and a sweet, free bottle of water, slippers, dressing gown. Breakfast is cooked and Continental - can't comment on evening meal.  Staff cheerful, polite and interested in your wellbeing.  Position wonderful and makes sightseeing easy.  No issues at all and would happily recommend to my family members. ",5,2017,02,11
27,"Great location, great staff, but...","Wonderful location on La Rambla. Staff could not have been nicer and more helpful.  If you don't have a room on the street (soundproof door & window), the rooms are very dark and windowless. The décor is unique and very beautiful, with a spiral staircase up the middle. We were there for 2 nights after a cruise and had large bags.  There was an ample closet, but no drawers whatsoever so we ended up living out of our bags which we had to put on the very nice built-in leather couch, as there was no other place to put them. A chest of drawers instead of the couch would have been helpful. We had 3 rooms and each was a slightly different configuration.",4,2017,02,09
27,Great place in the heart of Barcelona,"Great place in the heart of Barcelona, try to get a room facing the outside/ street with these little balconies. Excellent bath room/ shower. It has a tiny gym/ steam room that feels very private, enjoy!",5,2017,02,08
27,Fantastic Hotel & Staff - Great Location,"Absolutely loved this hotel - not massive rooms but really nice styling. Balcony with lovely view of church and nice bathroom including white company products. Staff incredibly helpful. Great breakfast with cava and other nice touches like sweets in entrance lobby. Superb location with good access to shops, bars, and metro - the market around the corner is amazing for freshly cooked fish",5,2017,02,08
27,"Great hotel, great location, great staff! :) ","We had an excellent weekend at this hotel, the staff are fantastic, the rooms are good with little balconies, bathrooms are well equipped and have white company products in them, try the pillow spray it's gorgeous! Location is amazing too, walking distance to everything, loved the sweets at reception....excellent recommendations for restaurants and bars by reception staff, loved the bellboy who's been on the TV (sorry didn't remember your name!) the only small downside was that I think it needs a relax area as the bar is mainly a restaurant and doubles up but not much chill out zones for a quiet drink after a long day sightseeing but that was the only negative for us. We would definitely book this hotel again for a city break. Thank you for looking after us xx",5,2017,01,27
27,Great Boutique Hotel in a Great Central Location,"My wife and I stayed at Bagues for a weekend city break with some friends and were not disappointed. 

We experienced their tasting menu on our first night which was around 8 delicious courses and thoroughly enjoyed it. €300 for four of us, including two bottles of wine and a few cocktails. Then add the 20% discount we got for being guests at the hotel and it's a great value meal. 

The staff gave us great recommendations for restaurants nearby, told us which ones may not be so good and also booked reservations for us. 
Not one of their recommendations were bad. 

They even booked tickets for us at Sagrada Familia (Gaudi's Cathedral) which saved us queueing and boy was there a queue when we got there. 

Our first visit to Barcelona was a really great experience and this Hotel had a lot to do with it. 

If I had to be greedy. I would like a bit more of an inviting Bar in the lobby area or maybe a bit more of a lounge area. But they are obviously limited by their location and the history of their premises so that's not their fault. ",5,2017,01,26
27,Exceptional service.,"Centrally located hotel where staff take their service very seriously. Rooms are very neat and comfortable. Bath rooms with designer toiletries, nespresso cofee machine in room.
Truly a 5star experience.",5,2017,01,26
27,Excellent staff and excellent hotel,This property has all travelers needs in a small perfectly located hotel on Las Ramblas street. Accessible to all city attractions and offering very comfortable rooms. I surely recommend it. The staff are very attentive and extremely helpful. They would definitely go beyond your exceptations. ,5,2017,01,24
27,New Year Holiday,"This is a lovely hotel, right in the middle of La Rambla which is a fantastic location.  We were disappointed in a few minor things, which for 5* hotel we thought would have been impeccable. These were the fridge was not re-stocked every day, the bottle opener went missing and was not replaced, the noise from the room cleaning staff on a morning (doors banging) was annoying, a dirty cleaning cloth was left in our room and for all there is a Nespresso machine within the room, this comes with only 4 coffee capsules for your whole stay, any additional are charged at 3 euros per capsule. We showed dissatisfaction around this and were left a note to say for the duration of our stay the capsules would be provided for free - but this never happened. 
The door man is a credit to this hotel, he was super friendly and always stopped to say hello and couldn't do enough for us.",4,2017,01,23
27,Outstanding Hotel,"Wonderful stay at Hotel Bagues. 
Not only is the location perfect, the interior stunning and the rooms impeccable, the service from the staff is the best I've received; nothing was too much and it felt like they genuinely wanted you to love every minute of your stay.",5,2017,01,22
27,Great hotel!,"Perfect location on Las Ramblas. So close to all the activity and shopping. Five-minute walk to Placa de Catalina where many tour busses are available. The staff is so very accommodating and eager to assist. Received a bottle of wine and chocolate truffles upon arrival. The rooms are not the largest but certainly large enough for one or two people. A word of caution...the bathroom door is clear glass. Not good if you need privacy. My room overlooked Las Ramblas but with the balcony door closed, it was perfectly quiet. Bed was a king and very comfortable. Decor is very modern. Room was very clean. Highly recommend. ",5,2017,01,20
27,Lovely short break,"Highly recommended hotel in ideal location, the staff were very pleasant and nothing was too much trouble . Would definitely return to here or one of their sister hotels if the level of service is to the standard of Barcelona.
Nice roof top terrace with excellent views of the city.
",5,2017,01,18
27,Barcelona Central,"Ideally situated for tourist activities. Just a short walk to Plaza Catalunya to catch tour buses if you chose but similarly ideal for just walking. The Gothic Quarter is easily reached on foot as are Gaudi's remarkable La Pedrera and Casa Batllo. La Bocqueria Market is a must for anybody interested in good fresh food and produce, no more than 5 minutes from the hotel. I was cautioned that Las Ramblas is just a tourist trap and very busy but I see no problem with being a mere tourist. I've travelled a lot.and find it absurd that some people feel the need to avoid popular destinations in a misguided attempt to appear sophisticated. True Las Ramblas is highly commercial and busy but that was part of the vibe and didn't impinge at all on our enjoyment, in fact it enhanced it. So don't let the location dissuade you from staying at this wonderful boutique hotel with it's super friendly staff, I've stayed in some of the best hotels around the world and it's definitely one of the better ones.",5,2017,01,17
27,"Lovely hotel, staff location. Haunted,maybe?","This hotel is very unique,clean friendly and excellent location. We received welcome chocolates and water. My only complaint is the bathroom door- completely see thru! And I see complaints on here from 2+ years ago about this issue! It wouldn't be difficult at all to make it frosted. Makes it awkward traveling with even the closest of friends. Side note- I think this place may be haunted. It is from 1800's after all. Nothing scary or violent but a lot of weird happenings. I would definitely stay here my next trip to Barcelona. ",5,2017,01,17
27,Barcelona,"The hotel was well situated for transport, shops and restaurants. Very helpful and obliging reception staff. I was warmly welcomed and enjoyed a very pleasant stay at the Hotel Bagues. I highly recommend the Derby Hotels.",5,2017,01,05
27,Incredible,Staff could not do enough for us. We received correspondence prior to our stay enquiringly to arrival time etc to see if early check in could be arranged. We were greeted by concierge as soon as we pulled up outside in a taxi. Room was beautiful and the cleanliness could not be faulted. Would recommend this hotel to everyone!,5,2016,12,31
27,Great hotel,"Very classy hotel in an excellent location - 5 minute walk from the drop off point (Hard Rock Café) of most airport shuttle services, 2 blocks from a supermarket, and 1 block from the Metro station.  It is also next door to the open food market for excellent prices on fresh food items, and directly across the street from a Tapas buffet style restaurant to try local cuisine.  The rooms are beautiful and a comfortable size, and room 503 had two windows, one facing Rambla and the other a  busy side street for interesting city views. The hotel staff was very helpful with directions to local attractions, and even secured online entrance tickets to help avoid long queues.  My partner (who notices nothing) commented on their attention to the little details like fresh single red roses in the bathroom and on the tables in the lobby restaurant, and the excellent truffles (available at the open market)  and nice size bottle of wine delivered to the room with a note.  One really great feature - the TV remote has an original language button that removed Spanish voiceovers on shows originally created in another language.  The breakfast buffet included meats, cheese, fruit, cereal and mimosas and a list of freshly made hot foods  The small hotel size allowed the front staff to always greet you by name as you entered and left the hotel, but you didn't feel slighted on amenities due to the size.  I would definitely stay again.  (Also the chaise lounger in the room is actually comfortable!)",5,2016,12,30
27,Excellent boutique hotel in a great location,"The Hotel Bagues is ideally located near the top end of Las Ramblas close to the wonderful food market, with a metro stop nearby. There are plenty of cafes, bakeries and restaurants nearby. Taxis are plentiful and easy to get.It is a relatively small hotel which is both chic and comfortable.

The staff are very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful and made very good suggestions for non-touristy restaurants nearby.

There is a rooftop bar with a small lap pool and great views. Having traveled there in December we weren't able to take advantage of this other than for photographs.

When we arrived we were given a voucher for glasses of cava in the restaurant which was a nice touch. In addition in our room a 100cl bottle of red wine along with chocolate truffles was also there as a welcome present.

The rooms are not overly large, but are well equipped and modern. The colours are in the darker range but quite modern. Our rooms had balconies overlooking the side street and the church. The balcony doors were thoroughly sound proofed so no noise from the street could be heard when the doors were shut.

In the bathroom the products were from White Company, so good quality. Bathrobes and slippers are also provided.

The bed was very comfortable - firm but giving, so a real advantage for the hotel.

The air-conditioning was quiet.

There is a docking station for an iPod or old style iPhone. However as it is wired through the television the volume is quite limited, well below the tv volume. I brought my own docking station and that was far better.

The television has only three channels in English and they are all news. DVD players are available on request.

There is a nightly turn down service which comes quite early. Not only does she prepare the bedroom but also provides chocolates and the next day's weather forecast.

The showers in our rooms were over the baths. Water pressure was good.

There is a nespresso machine in the room along with a good size mini fridge. There are plenty of power points unlike many hotels.

The door to the bathroom is clear glass which my student children found a bit of a problem due to the lack of privacy.",5,2016,12,30
27,Great location...amazing staff,This place is wonderful if you want to be in the thick of it. The staff clearly genuinely cared for us. The room was cute though a little tight but had a great view. What a wonderful experience! We didn't eat breakfast there but it's so close to coffee shops we didn't need to.,5,2016,12,29
27,Lovely modern hotel in convenient location.,"A lovely hotel with many modern conveniences, a rooftop pool and sitting area, a nice bar and restaurant on the lobby floor.  Well-appointed rooms, in dark, masculine colors and materials.  Excellent and friendly service.  Location was great for walking the city and easy for taxis to find.",5,2016,12,20
27,Good location!,"We stayed in this hotel for two nights,
Staff are too friendly and helpful, hotel is in good location in Rambla st. And just few steps from Catalonia sq. 
Although our room was modern and clean but we didn't like that because it was small & furnished so dark .
Breakfast menu was poor!

",3,2016,12,18
27,"great hotel, great staff","stayed for three nights in a suite on the 6th floor. Room was great, staff were great. Only downside was the rumble you could hear from the metro. Much louder than i thought it would be. However, a great stay and would thoroughly recommend.",4,2016,12,06
27,WIsh it never had to end!,"We loved our time in Barcelona and the Hotel Bagues was key to that.  The hotel is sparkling and the staff were wonderful, providing us with excellent advice on where to eat and shop.  And the location is stellar as well.  ",5,2016,12,02
27,Super Location and very comfortable,The location of the hotel is right in the middle of La Ramblas. Closeby to any and everything. The rooms are a little small but well kept - they do turn down service as well.House keeping does a very good job. The breakfast is very ordinary but its not a complaint. The staff very very friendly  and always ready to assist and help.,4,2016,11,28
27,Checked every necessary box,"Great service, even better bathroom and best blackout curtain. The location was good too.  Everything you need for a good stay in Barcelona to sleep well, get questions answered and get to where you need to go.",5,2016,11,23
27,Short Trip,Excellent hotel in a perfect location. Would highly recommend staying here if you want to be located on La Ramblas. Didn't eat in the hotel so I can't comment on the food. Staff are very polite and courteous. Good size room with a balcony.,5,2016,11,22
27,A Bijou Boutique Hotel in Barcelona,"This is a delightful little hotel - only about 30 rooms, I think - situated in a great location on La Rambla, one of the nicest pedestrianised areas of the city. The yacht harbour and the beach are both within an easy walking distance, the excellent food market is just 100 or so metres away, as is the Lyceum opera/theatre, and the old town is all around. The hotel is modern and elegant and the staff are really helpful and friendly. Good cuisine, too. A definite yes when we return to Barcelona!",5,2016,11,15
27,Birthday Trip,"We have stayed in many five-star hotels in the last 40 years plus. Hotel Bagues is up there with the best. Location on La Ramblas. Attention and service excellent. Clean and sparkling. Only 30 rooms. Not the largest room (503) but well set up and designed more than adequate. Modern lift which worked!!
Converted old building to highest standard",5,2016,11,15
27,Well located excellent boutique hotel.,"I spent 4 nights in this delightful, central hotel and can recommend it. Staff were friendly and professional. The restaurant had a varied and well priced menu. Easy walking to most places in Barcelona. ",5,2016,11,12
27,A gem right on the Ramblas,"You will be right in the centre of the action at the Hotel Bagues. The location is perfect - right on the Ramblas.  The rooms are small but very well appointed and spotless.  The rooftop pool and patio are lovely, and you can order from the lobby bar during the offseason when the pool bar is closed.  The rooms are nice and quiet - a little sanctuary from the hustle of the Ramblas.  Do not hesitate to stay at this lovely hotel.",5,2016,11,12
27,Elegant hotel overlooking La Rambla,A beautifully run boutique hotel in the center of Barcelona.  The rooms are small but well appointed and the staff is top rate.  Excellent breakfast--buffet and/or hot.  We even had a VERY nice dinner in the hotel on a Saturday--surprisingly good and affordable with excellent service.,5,2016,11,07
27,Amazing Barcelona Property,You will not find better service anywhere.  This hotel is an amazing piece of art/history as well as a 5 star hotel.  The service of Claudia and Armand was absolutely some of the best we have ever encountered.  ,5,2016,11,06
27,Birthday break,"Lovely few days , Staff helpful,location excellent 
Chilled Cava in the room on arrival for my birthday nice touch

27,Absolutely fantastic!,"We went for a three night break. Hadn't been to Barcelona before so genuinely guessed the best area to stay. This hotel was absolutely perfect. It's small but perfectly formed! The staff are incredibly friendly, helpful and effiecient really couldn't do enough for us. On arrival, our room wasn't ready (we were early!) so they showed us to a private gym area where we could change and leave our luggage securely, when we returned later that day they were in our room waiting. (The bags not the staff!) 
Fantastic location. We could walk to lots of the main areas for sightseeing. Right in the heart of the lovely gothic area, and right next door to an amazing food market. If you love fresh seafood cooked to demand - look no further. We could even walk (for about 20/25 minutes) down the the port - fantastic! 
The rooms are lovely, great shower!!!! We would definitely stay here again and can't recommend enough! Thank you Hotel Bagues for a lovey amazing stay! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",5,2016,10,31

27,"A funky, modern boutique hotel directly on La Rambla","A very modern, clean design making good use of the minimalist space provided, with a truly great staff. The service was exceptionally good and each member of the staff we encountered was always very helpful. Spotlessly clean but small, bright rooms were totally adequate for a brief stay.",4,2016,10,27
27,An oasis of calm in La Rambla,"This was such a perfect hotel, small, discrete and so central.  We had three nights here and ventured out to explore each day having slept in our beautiful room completely soundproofed from La Rambla outside our window.  The breakfasts were excellent and the staff unfailing in their endeavours to make our stay comfortable.  I cannot think of a single complaint and my partner particularly enjoyed the jars of sweets at the entrance.",5,2016,10,26
27,Everything about this hotel is great!,"Wonderful location right on la rambla but very quiet room- probably the quietest city hotel room I've ever stayed in. This hotel has the modern feel of a W hotel but in a small boutique environment. Service has been excellent. The rooms are a work of art and beautiful design with ebony paneled curved wall, exquisite lighting, and a comfy bed. I really didn't do much research before booking this hotel and feel we totally lucked out. Would absolutely recommend and stay here again. ",5,2016,10,22
27,Very friendly hotel,"A very friendly team who, unusually, really couldnt do enough to help. They tried their hardest to make our stay good.

The hotel is ideally positioned, in the centre. Window sound proofing was also exceptionally good. 

Unfortunately the rooms are quite small, and the balcony, whilst really good to stand on and what the hustle and bustle of La Rambla, it wasnt deep enough for a seat.

The only outdoor space was on the roof terrace, which was lovely, but unstaffed. The 'pool' was only 2 foot wide, so is really a plunge pool / paddling pool.

Overall, if we wanted a short break in the centre, we would consider it again, although we would probably choose to be on the coast next time.",4,2016,10,20
27,Wonderful Hotel!,"My husband and I spent 3 nites at the Hotel Bagues. The rooms are luxurious,with great beds, modern baths that have beautiful products.

It's location made seeing Barcelona a breeze....it is in the center of everything. Can't wait to go back!",5,2016,10,19
27,Bagues is the best location in Barca,"Fabulous location, super clean room. Loved this hotel. Was originally a little hesitant of staying in a smaller boutique hotel but now that I have experienced this nice adventure will look for smaller upscale boutique hotels. The concierge was spectacular and always willing to help.  Bathroom is updated and clean. Bed and pillows are super comfortable and clean. Highly recommend if you can afford.",5,2016,10,18
27,Barcelona impression,This hotel was more than accommodating to our group. The staff was spectacular and helped with every request. The location was perfect and their recommendations for dinners was spot on. It may be small in size but it is a giant in the tourist world.,5,2016,10,16
27,Great service! great location! ,"We stayed for three nights.  The service was great!!  They assisted with all the little things.  Very nice team,  extraordinary service!!

27,Fantastic Venice Hotel,"This is our most favorite Barcelona Hotel. We have stayed here 3 times now. It is a perfect location to see Barcelona from. Walking distance to many of the Gaudi buildings, the Gothic Quarter and incredible shopping! So much activity on Las Rambla. Some rooms have fantastic balconies. The restaurant there is great. The rooftop bar and small pool is great for relaxing, taking in the views of Barcelona and just enjoying. The staff is always friendly, helpful and fun to be around. The hotel is basically traditional with a twist of contemporary. Very nice. A great place at a great price!",5,2016,10,07
27,Great hotel in great site,"Boutique hotel with lovely decor and attention to detail. Staff were very helpful, with a great reception team and superb doorman. Roof pool is small but great for dangling feet in. Beer on roof cheaper than on Las Ramblas! Situated on Ramblas and near most things. Taxi to magic fountains was only €10.85 both ways. Beautiful city. Hotel isn't cheap, but it is worth the extra if you can do it. Barely any noise in room from street, underground audible but only just, not obtrusive. I'd love to go back!",5,2016,10,04
27,Nice stay in this beautiful hotel,"Apart the subway, audible in the whole neighborhood, stay was perfect. Hotel maintained in brand new condition, shining cleanliness. All personal kind and eager to help. Very good location on la Rambla, numéros turistics places nearby.
Suite is enthusiastic with private jacuzzi on terrace.
A world on breakfast whole price appears very high... !",5,2016,10,01
27,Wonderful location and lovely staff,"It's on La Rambla. It's next to the Boquaria Market (foodie heaven). It has staff to whom nothing is too much trouble. So there are three pretty strong plus points. It is a hotel with a lot of charm, and the rooftop bar is a great place to have a pre- lunch gargle before a plate of seafood in the Boquaria Market. A minor niggle is that the comfortable rooms are not huge. But that really is a minor issue, when everything else is so good. Thoroughly recommended.",5,2016,09,30
27,Boutique hotel on Las Ramblas,"Excellent location on Las Ramblas.  Very high quality hotel with well-equipped rooms and modern, clean surroundings.  Friendly staff.   However, everything here is designer chic with functionality being of secondary importance.  The terrace bar and pool is located on the roof.  But this is the only bar and it was closed during our 2-day stay.  Staff cleared a table in the restaurant so that we could have a cool drink when we came in from the heat.  Restaurant was too 'up-market' for dinner (and only opened at 8:30pm) so we ventured out each evening to join the other tourists.",4,2016,09,29
27,Great location!,"As a foodie blogger, I choose Hotel Bagues for its proximity to La Boqueria Mercat along La Rambla and I was not disappointed.  Traveling with my dad who's 86yo and an artist, the location was perfect for his art.  ",4,2016,09,27
27,excellent location,"A good location for walking to the cathedral, port and even the Sagrada familia, which took us about 2 hours. Again we have the same problem with vegetarian food. They have just one main meal, for 4 days. Breakfast is good, with an ala carte menu as an extra.",5,2016,09,27
27,Great Location,A beautiful boutique hotel located right on Las Ramblas.  We had a wonderful stay here and enjoyed Barcelona very much.  The staff was friendly and extremely helpful.  I recommend this hotel and would stay here again.,5,2016,09,25

27,Perfect Location and Excellent start and decor. You simply must stay here if visiting barcelona,"Everything about this hotel is great, I regret the beds being so comfortable that I slept in and missed breakfast :-( The reception staff go that extra mile as do the porters. The location is perfect, right in the middle of The Ramblas. Decor lovely, very clean, I loved it!  I plan to go back next visit.",5,2016,09,23
27,IDEAL PRE OR POST CRUISE STOPOVER IN BARCELONA,"Position ,position,position-this boutique hotel is situated in the middle of Las Ramblas 5 minute walk from the aerobus (airport) stop at Placa Catalunya and 5 minute walk down Las Ramblas to the T3 cruise terminal bus stop-no need for taxis
Beautiful roof bar and pool overlooking Barcelona
Modern decor and friendly staff .
On returning from our cruise they generously stored all our luggage ,thereby allowing us a few extra shopping hours before our connecting flight 
 ",5,2016,09,23
27,Perfect,"Staying at Hotel Bagues is an experience of unique quality.  The rooms are just a bit quirky, decorated with art from its previous life.  I found the interior beautiful.  Our room , although a bit small, was on the 6th floor with a private deck and hot tub.  Lovely for September evenings.  The 7th floor roof top deck had a spectacular view.  The hotel is steps from La Boqueria, the indoor market where we went every day for incredible foods. 
But best of all the front desk staff was the nicest, friendliest, most accommodating ever.  Thank you!
 ",5,2016,09,22
27,"Charming hotel, excellent staff",This is a small charming hotel right on the Ramblas.  The staff goes out of their way to be helpful and is very friendly.  Drinks on the 7th floor terrace during sunset are a perfect way to start your evening.  The only caution is that the hotel is right on the metro line so ask for a high floor.  We were on the second floor and it got quite noisy at times.,5,2016,09,21
27,Love this place!!!,"Excellent location, so much to walk around and see. Staff is always so welcoming and friendly. The rooms are clean, comfortable and roomy for European standards. Our room had a bath tub!!!  The famous farmers market is just down the street to the right. Starbucks is down the street to the left. Try the new coffee shop around the corner called 365. Excellent. Or the cute donut and sweets store right around the corner to the left. Called Chox loved it!  Or a cute restaurant/bar also to the left around the corner called Beer-linale. Try their homemade chips. And of course, the old town is right out the door across the street. Enjoy getting lost in the quaint little alleyways.  Taxi to the airport will cost you about 45 euros with tip. Enjoy!!!",5,2016,09,21
27,Excellent location!,For anyone visiting Barcelona for the first time this Hotel is perfectly located in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. The calibre of this Hotel is of an excellent standard and I would recommend it to everyone! ,5,2016,09,18
27,Great hotel ,"Beautiful decor, lovely staff and fantastic location. Only problem I found was no area to do your hair and make up, not enough plug sockets and no body mirror. definitely wish we stayed here longer! Loved our stay! ",5,2016,09,16
27,Great service,This well located hotel has small but elegant rooms and the best concierges bar none. They took care of everything and had great advice. Loved their amenities. The mattress was so comfortable I asked for details,5,2016,09,14
27,Barcelona Experience,I was in Barcelona for a few days and just wanted to visit certain places due to time. I found that the front desk was very accommodating with their instructions and suggestions on where to go. I liked how they were friendly and welcoming all the time which made my stay even better. The roof top bar was a stand out and was amazing with a lovely view of the cathedral. Below our room was Chok an awesome chocolate store and 50m down was La Boqueria. Great hotel great location! ,5,2016,09,12
27,Muy Bueno,"The staff at this hotel is the epitome of hotel staffing.  Without fail they were all extremely accommodating, helpful, generous, thoughtful, and service oriented.  Of the five hotels we stayed in during our nine day tour of Spain, this was absolutely the best staff.  The location is also fantastic.  The rooms are clean and the bathroom very modern and spacious.  The noise from the popular boulevard out front is very minimal.  Don't miss the pool and bar on the top floor!  The breakfast is very good and a great start to the day filled with lots of sightseeing.  ",5,2016,09,10
27,Fabulous boutique style hotel,"Booked a 3 night break at this superb hotel.  Perfectly located on La Ramblas - a short walk from where the airport bus drops you off in the central square.
Lovely, friendly welcome from staff on reception & excellent service from all staff.
Exceptional cleanliness in bedrooms/bathrooms - Housekeeping staff to be commended,
Sound proofing in room (ours was front facing onto La Rambla) & no noise from road could be heard at all.
Quality of breakfast was excellent and worth paying for.
We would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends and will be looking to visit other Derby Hotels now (chain of hotels).
Many Thanks",5,2016,09,09
27,First Class,"First class in all respects. 

This is a beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona, right on Ramblas, next to the St. Joseph market. The rooftop pool is tiny but lovely and refreshing. The interior architecture is stunning -- a combination of old world and modern. There a gym, treatment room, restaurant and conference room. 

Service is impeccable. The staff takes care of its guests and caters to their every requirement. ",5,2016,09,09
27,"Great Hotel, ideal location","My wife and I chose this hotel after reading Tripadvisor reviews. We were not disappointed,  from registration to check-out all staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. Our room was very clean and comfortable and the maid did a great job. Not a massive room but it is an old building in a city centre so you expect that. Comfortable bedding, large quality towels, robe and slippers, free room safe, mini-bar and in room coffee maker..Great location only 5 minutes walk from the airport transfer bus stop A1 or A2 and you can walk straight onto La Rambla..our coffee machine was broken so staff bought us coffee on request...cold buffet breakfast or hot cooked on demand from menu which was great..Superb sound proofing and black-out curtains meant we heard nothing from the busy street and slept really well. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay..Just be careful of pick pockets when walking round especially in the evening",5,2016,09,08
27,Highly Recommend,This hotel is a hidden gem right on La Rambla. Excellent service and very helpful staff; sound proof rooms; light or American style breakfast prepared as requested; intimate roof top bar with great top shelf choices.,5,2016,09,05
27,Long weekend ,Lovely hotel. Central location. Great staff. Very friendly and helpful. Greeted us on arrival at the taxi and again on return from days out. We had a suite with terrace plunge pool. The room was lovely. Beds really comfortable. Only downside to the room was that it was below the roof top bar so people could see over onto our terrace where our pool was therefore not very private. Secondly the music from the bar was audible when in bed. It did stop at one and was a chill out jazz genre so not too bad to try and go to sleep to. It didn't bother us too much as we was going to bed just before 1 am anyway. However for those who would go to bed earlier it may be an issue. We left on a late evening flight and couldn't keep the room on until later. This meant we couldn't have a chill day on the beach on our last day before showering and heading to the airport about 7pm. We had to check out at 12 and leave our cases at the hotel. It was a lovely hotel all in all however I wouldn't stay again. After seeing Barcelona and realising how little time you spend at the hotel I would probably opt for a cheaper hotel. ,3,2016,09,03
27,Perfect place to stay,"Spent a long time prior to booking my Barcelona Hotel trying to work out which one to go for, with so many to choose from and not knowing the city at all, it was a daunting prospect. In the end I chose this hotel due to its price, facilities and location and I am very pleased I did. I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel, the location is right on La Ramblas so provided an excellent base for seeing the sights. The staff were friendly and helpful, providing help and assistance with local information, giving tips on best things to see and best way to get around.

We stayed in a jewel suite on the top floor. The room was a nice size with a separate seating area and a large bathroom. Outside the terrace was split into two with one side containing a Jacuzzi and the other side a table and chairs as well as lounging mat. If I had a criticism it would be that the outside area was a bit small. My parents, who also had a suite were at the front of the hotel and had a much larger and nicer single terrace, but their room layout was not quite so nice. So I guess its swings and roundabouts on that one.

I did not eat in the hotel, but was assured by those that did that breakfast was excellent. I did try the rooftop bar on a couple of occasions and, although small, if you managed to get a table/chairs it was a really lovely place to sit and unwind. The view across the rooftops of Barcelona is fantastic. There is also a small pool on the roof, but it is very narrow and not really useful for anything other than cooling off in. Again, I did not use it (used the Jacuzzi on my terrace instead).

The room was well equipped with a mini bar, Nespresso coffee machine (4 complimentary capsules per day) and also complimentary bottled water each day. All of which were very welcome. I would have liked the option of more coffee capsules but equally I could have bought some myself as there is a supermarket less than 5 minutes’ walk away.  On our arrival we were also provided with a complimentary bottle of cava, which was nicely chilled and very welcome after our journey, and a voucher for a free drink in the terrace bar. All in all we were made to feel very welcome indeed, and I have no hesitation what so ever in recommending this hotel as a place to stay.",5,2016,08,31
27,Little Oasis,"Just returned from a 5 night stay at this little oasis which is right on the chaotic La Rambla.  Perfect location and perfect little hotel.  I loved the Art Deco feel, the Rennie Mackintosh inlays on the furniture and projections on the bedroom doors, the gorgeous shower, huge towels, bathrobes, slippers, sweets, chocolates on the pillows just perfect.  All of the staff that we had dealings with were super helpful and nothing was too much trouble, booking tickets for Park Guell, car hire, you name it they did it.  I am sorry I can't name any of them but thank you all for a lovely staff.   The rooftop bar is the perfect location to watch the comings and goings down below, service was more than a bit chaotic one night, but nothing to worry about we got there eventually.  Had a lovely stay and would certainly return.  Only downside was my husbands phone was stolen at the airport on the way home, survived Barcelona and then they got us at the airport.  Be careful!",5,2016,08,24
27,Lovely stay in Barcelona,"A pleasant experience in a small luxury place in the heart of the town
Perfect welcome and accurate service 
Mostly appreciated the sweets in the hall
Dog friendly hotel (we always travel with our pet)
",5,2016,08,24
27,A little gem,"This hotel has the very best staff of any hotel I have stayed in, genuine and welcoming, and nothing too much trouble. My only criticism was the room, there was a lack of hanging space and space to store luggage, but apart from that we loved it. Great location on the Ramblas and next to the market.",4,2016,08,24
27,Excellent hotel,"Great location, excellent hotel and good staff.
Right on the Ramblas so rooms are not huge but they are good.
Room 603 has a great balcony view onto the bustling Rambals below.
Breakfast very good.
Roof top cocktails were good, lovely Amareto sour.
They also recommended the restaurant Patron for us and that we very good too.
Thanks to the great guy fronpm Senegal who was on the door and looked after us for taxis.
Bed was very comfortable too.

Recommended by my wife and I.",4,2016,08,21
27,Stay 15 august,"Excellent service and nice staff.
The swimming pool is very small.
The jewel suite was very nice.
Shower is too small. Very quiet room. Perhaps inform your clients they should make a reservation for the restaurant during the weekends.
",5,2016,08,16
27,Great boutique hotel in a fabulous location!,"Its hard to pinpoint what I liked best about this hotel.  The location was surprisingly perfect!  Right on the Ramblas and about a 7 minute walk from the Plaça de Catalunya.  There’s a Carre Four and Starbucks nearly next door as well which makes getting supplies for room very handy.

The hotel is small (17 rooms?) but very trendy and appealing. A cute touch is the candy pick-and-mix as you come in (my husband enjoyed this a bit TOO much!)
We very much enjoyed our stay - the people working at the hotel absolutely made it a delight in particular the bellman who always seemed to be on duty. The staff were very friendly and accommodating.

As for the room – we stayed in the Jewel Suite.  Lots of positives – an outdoor bathtub, trendy décor and White Company toiletries.  Robes and slippers were also provided.  There was a minibar (which you could put your own items in) as well as a Nespresso coffee machine.  Please note the coffee which you are provided on day one is what you get for the stay. 

We didn’t use the restaurant because simply the breakfast was very expensive (24 Euros).  I don't mind paying ~25 euros for big fancy hotel breakfast buffets (think Middle East) but for a small boutique hotel I would expect something more in the region of 15-20 euros.  

We did use the rooftop bar/pool area which was very relaxing with views of the city from the 7th floor.  Note though – if looking over the bannister you CAN see the outdoor bathtub area below on the 6th floor (found this out a bit too late, I’m afraid!)

Whist I have given this hotel top marks, I did have criticism around the room itself:
There was no area to get ready (make-up and hair).  I would usually expect a desk or dressing table in the room - especially a ""suite.""  This coupled with the lack of decent lighting made getting ready (particularly in the evening) very difficult.

Overall though a fantastic stay!  We travel quite a bit and really enjoyed this hotel which is why in good conscious I couldn’t rate it any lower than excellent even though lack of a place to get ready is usually a major bug bear for me.  Definitely recommend!!",5,2016,08,13
27,Perfect stay!,I stayed here just 2 nights this past week and I was more then impressed! The staff were friendly and beyond helpful from start to finish. The room was clean and spacious and had a beautiful view of a local church. Last but not least the location was excellent and ideal for anyone coming to explore the city. I would definitely be staying here in the future!,5,2016,08,13
27,Exceptional Boutique Hotel and Staff,"Only stayed her one night but was very impressed. I was arriving very early from a cruise and had previously asked for an early check in. They had everything ready for us when we arrived. I had a beautiful corner room overlooking the Rambla and the church.

The staff were all very friendly and efficient. They helped me with tourist advice and booking tickets.
Even though we were only there one night they put out a welcoming bottle of exceptional red wine (not the cheap stuff) and truffles.
The room was very well appointed.

Even though it's s noisy location, it's completely quiet in the room. You can only hear a very very faint rumble of the subway trains occasionally. The air conditioning works well.

All in all highly recommended. Ticks all the boxes and a great location to see the city. Much better than staying in a generic corporate hotel. You get a real feel of Barcelona here. 

Make sure to get one of the more expensive rooms so that you get a view and balcony - it's actually not that more expensive than a regular room and well worth the extra cost.",5,2016,08,13
27,A great hotel,"After a week end in this  beautiful hôtel o beautiful jewel, i wanted to write to recommand this place. 
This hôtel has so many détails in its décoration that is a real pleasure to see.
Its location on the Rambla is really good.
Our favorite place is the terrasse on the roof with the pool and a nice view, the cocktails served are very good.
All the staff is very kind and pleasant. The  service is perfect.
À spécial thanks to Mélanie, Nicolas and all the réception team.

Best regards

27,Bad experience,A very weird incidence happened during my stay.  I went downstairs to the gym. And one of the reciptionist followed me a's if he was checking what I am doing. It's so weird and too rude of him to do that. I am a young female with medium body built. I totally do not look suspicious. I wish it's not my hijab that made him suspicious.,2,2016,08,08
27,to be recommended for further recommendation,"I am visiting barcelona since many years from time to time. But it is a pity that I have not discovered this ""pearl"" earlier. In the future my favourite place to stay is clear as daylight : It's the Bagués !",5,2016,08,08
27,rons review,They will need to subscribe to better entertaining cable. Other than that they were wonderful and very helpful. he front desk helped us with places to go and directions. They also helped us with things to do. They also helped us book a cab and were very patient with us. They gave us a converter to charge our phones and We loved every moment of their bar and clean room. I recommend this plac e totally.,5,2016,08,07

The hotel is well located and very easy to walk to many places and obtain public transport. The food at the hotel was amazing. My only fault is that the wifi could be better and we wish breakfast was included which is the case with many luxury hotels these days.",5,2016,08,07
27,Lovely hotel,"We loved staying here for 8 nights. We arrived before 11 am after our overnight flight and our room was ready.
Our 4th floor room overlooked the bustling La Ramblas and had a small balcony.
The door to the balcony was surprisingly noise proof since the street below is busy until the wee hours.
 The hotel has a rooftop patio(7th floor) and small pool, perfect for relaxing after a busy day of sightseeing. 
The staff was very friendly and accommodating. They helped us book a day trip out of the city. We also upgraded to have the buffet breakfast.",5,2016,08,03
27,GREAT HOTEL,"Everything was perfect! The facilities were very clean and comfortable with a chic vibe. The staff was TERRIFIC...greeting us with a very warm welcome! They could not have been more accommodating. Also, the roof top was a lovely venue for an afternoon cocktail at the end of each day! We will definitely stay at Hotel Bagues the next time we visit Barcelona!",5,2016,08,02
27,Excellent,"Am really enjoying the personal touches at a small hotel. You are a person not just a room number. I am glad I chose this wonderful small boutique hotel in the bustling Las Rambla. A very vibrant area. The hotel is small so hence two small lifts. The interior is very unusual dark and gothic. Lovely appointed room comfy bed. Bathroom only down side is its dark   The toilet is very high. Not sure why. And the shower is in the bath. So for older people a word of caution. But lovely fluffy towels with great bathroom amenities. We're on the 4th floor. So a nice view. The pool is on the 7th floor with a lovely view of the city. The hotel is in a busy area close to everything. Metro,bus,taxi,hop on bus and lots oh shopping close by. Fortune of restaurants. And also the market close by. We added breakfast. No problems and it was more than enough. Do recommend. ",5,2016,08,02

Great decor and great atmosphere. lifts are wicked and the rooms are spacious and beds are super comfy. the roof top pool is ideal and the bar opens at 6pm, but can take your own drinks up there before hand.they don't mind. Breakfast is nice, good selection, and is served till 11, which is what you want on holiday. Plus they have free sweets in the reception. would come back",5,2016,07,28
27,A friendly hotel in a great location,"The only negative was our particular room which was small, very dark and had limited storage space. If staying again, which we would be happy to do, we would want a very much better room. Apart from that the staff were friendly and very helpful, the breakfast very good and dinner in the restaurant on the one night we ate in was excellent if a little costly.",5,2016,07,26
27,Fantastic in every way possible. ,"Good points: Rooftop pool, located on La Rambles and finished with the perfect amount of luxury. 

Stayed for 2 nights in this wonderful hotel. The staff were super friendly and couldn't do enough to help. They really did make the experience that extra special.

We stayed in a standard double room overlooking La Rambles and with the windows open you could enjoy the hustle and bustle of the city, but closed you were in a tranquil retreat. The room was clean, modern and laced with those little touches of luxury. 

We ate in the restaurant for breakfast and it was a delicate and a la carte affair. A wonderful breakfast. 

A pool and bar is located on the roof terrace and features fantastic views across the city. 

You're located very centrally, close to the metro, patisseries and numerous restaurants and shops. The market is also close by which is worth a look for an authentic experience. 

Would recommend this hotel in an instant. 
Indulge in Barcelona from a hotel that oozes sophistication, attention to detail and customer care.

The hotel is very fresh and stylish.
Could ask for a better place to stay.
It is located on the busy street La Rambla, but the rooms are so sound proof! Didnt hear a sound when we closed the door to the balkony!
The hotel also has its own rooft bar with a small swimming pool.
Fabulous drinks and views!

You really get the 5-star feeling and treatment at this hotel!",5,2016,07,23
27,Great Central Location,"Excellent service, room comfort & location in the heart of the Rambla.  Rooms were clean & quiet even on the street side.

This was our third time in Barcelona, and we did not want to return to our previous hotels. However, I will be absolutely staying at Bagues next time we are in town. Every single personnel member is friendly, knowledgeable, and always eager to help. They make sure you feel right at home while staying at this property. Rooms are very clean, and the sound proof windows do the trick of blocking out all the noise of La Rambla. My only wish would have been to have a softer pillow, but that's just a personal preference and does not devalue the hotel in my eyes. ",5,2016,07,15

27,Luxury with eccentricity,"On the outside it looked like the other buildings but once inside it was as if I was in Dr Who's Tardis. It had a very artistic feel about it.
The reception staff were professional, polite and very welcoming. My room was on the fourth floor, a corner one. This gave me two windows with different views, on to the busy street below. I had a beautiful double bed to myself. There was a chaise langue next to the bed. So after a shower I lounged on the chaise langue, partaking of the chocolate truffles left for me. There were two beautiful thick bathrobes for my use. Breakfast was very tasty, and varied, again the staff were very helpful. I was only there for one night but would love to go back to indulge myself for longer. This trip was a family treat for me, one which I thoroughly enjoyed.",5,2016,07,11
27,Great choice in La Rambla Ditsrict,"WE stayed two nights while we awaited boarding for a cruise.  The staff was very helpful with maps, baggage and accommodations.  An in room frig. allowed me to store medicine.  Our room overlooked the hustle & bustle of La Rambla Ave. but had very sufficient noise limitations.  There was an in-hotel dining room but it was rather pricey.  You are close enough to the market and restaurants to explore and eat out.  Tapas bars are everywhere but we would recommend heading down the side street toward those on the walk to Catherdal Barcelona.",5,2016,07,10

27,Great Location!,My fiance and I stayed here for 2 nights before our cruise.  Very helpful staff and nice rooms.  Location could not be better.  Walkable to so many of the sights!  Be aware that in booking on-line you could get an inside room with no windows to the outside.  Make sure you specify that you want a room facing Las Ramblas.  All rooms are sound proofed so you don't have to worry about the noise.,4,2016,07,06
27,Unbelievable Hotel and Staff!!!,"Just finished my stay at this beautiful boutique hotel. As someone who travels at least once a month, I have some favorite hotels. None have provided me the service I received this week at Hotel Bagues. 
Due to a British Airways delay, I missed a connection to Barcelona. I was placed on a later flight. As the hotel was sending a car for me, I called and thought there would be a problem. No problem!  A lovely young lady named Melanie took my information and said she'd take care it. 
When I checked in I was greeted by Melanie by name (late and tired). The staff was so attentive and escorted me to my room. The room was pristine and well decorated, overlooking las Ramblas. The bed was very comfortable. 
As I wasn't dressed for the restaurant, I went up to the rooftop bar, overlooking the city (beautiful view). The bartender, Mikel (hope I spelled that correctly) pointed me a much needed drink. I ordered from the restaurant menu and the food was magnificent. 
As if the staff could not do more, I came back to my room one evening with a couple of pieces of cake and a note wishing me happy birthday. I later figured they found out from my passport!
I am sorry I cannot remember everyone's name, but the entire staff is remarkable. I do not think they know the word ""no"". Everything is possible. 
On top of all that the location is right in the middle of las Ramblas. A short walk one way to Placa Cantalunya, the other to the Marina and restaurants and shopping all around. 
I cannot imagine staying somewhere else in  this beautiful city. 
The Hotel is beautiful - the staff makes it ""over the top""",5,2016,07,04
27,Excellent service in a beautiful boutique hotel,"Service was exceptional- staff could not do enough for us. Always a smile and extremely helpful.  Thank you Claudia and Melanie and all the wonderful staff from the doorman to the other concierges - the best service we have ever had . Central location- could walk anywhere. We will definitely return .

27,Perfection,"Me and my girlfriend stayed here for 3 nights mid-June and neither of us have experienced a nicer hotel than here. Aside from the beautiful and modern aesthetics, great location and superb facilities; it was the staff that took it to another level.

From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome, from the cool doorman opening the door for us to the friendly and cheery staff at reception. Claudia behind the desk presented us with a very useful map and even circled her own recommendations for food and nightlife. 

I had asked for an upgrade a couple nights prior to our stay, but understandably they didn't have the rooms available to facilitate. Instead, waiting in our beautiful room was a bottle of red wine, two chocolate truffles and a heartwarming note from the hotel.

Although it is only a small hotel, they had everything you needed. We made full use of the rooftop terrace with the quaint pool and deck chairs for relaxing in the the sun.  They offered bar service which was too good to refuse and had two glasses of wine brought up to us by one of the many friendly staff.

Nothing is too much for the staff and they will do everything in their power to ensure you have the best experience possible.

We will be back!!",5,2016,06,28
27,Excellent,"Stayed at this hotel for our 10th wedding anniversary and was not let down at all.  The staff on front desk were very helpful and very professional throughout our stay,  from glasses of bubbly on arrival to returning from a day out to a bottle of wine on the side in our room with chocolates.  Really made our 10th wedding anniversary  and first trip to Barcelona one to remember.
Thanks to all at Hotel Bagues",5,2016,06,27
27,Excellent hotel in the heart of the city.,"The Bagues in Barcelona is an exceptional hotel to stay in, well located in the happening place of the city, walking distance to the water and shopping.  The staff was superb.  The subway is very close by for easy access.",5,2016,06,24
27,Fabulous outdoor bath tub!,"I loved this hotel. Staff was incredible, and the room was fabulous. I particularly enjoyed the outdoor bath tub. 

The pool has a wonderful view and is a good temperature but the bar was closed when I was there. Drinks and towels are just a quick phone call away though. 

Hotel Bagues is situated in the middle of everything. Great in house restaurant, but there are so many places to walk to just a stones throw away. Check out the market up the street and go hungry!

The only downside is that it's a little noisy on the street at night. We sat out on our patio and watched the gypsies pose as prostitutes and pickpocket numerous people. Also there was a strange knock at our door around 3 am and we had to cal the front desk to handle it. 

Other than those minor things, this is probably one of my favorite hotels ever!",4,2016,06,21
27,seth troxler loves bagues,"i cant say enough about this hotel, the location and staff really make the experience the best in Barcelona every year i come and business trip i have.  Its one of the few hotels in the world that after my first stay there always remember my name and the room i prefer, That says so much about service and care.  ",5,2016,06,21
27,Great stay,"Had a wonderful time, Great staff, Fantastic with plenty of sites with in walking distance of the  location, Clean and accommodating. Room was a little on the smaller side but hey its Europe right? I'd stay again!!!!",5,2016,06,20
27,Sumptuous boutique hotel in the middle of everything,"This boutique hotel is simply dripping in luxury, and with only 31 rooms, you often feel like you're a guest in someone's fancy home, not just a number in a huge hotel. The staff (such as Claudia, Marc, and Sergei, as well as the doorman whose name I forgot) were the most polite and helpful people we have ever had the pleasure to meet in any luxury hotel. From booking us a last minute cava tasting tour (castle experiences, incredible experience) to providing restaurant and entertainment advice, as well as lightning-fast room service, we could not ask for better treatment. 

When this hotel says its rooms are soundproof, they mean it. You can open your windows and see and hear the street sounds, performers etc, or close your windows and hear nothing. The room also had some great extra touches, such as cozy slippers, extremely comfortable bedding, and a sleeptime aromatherapy spray that my wife loved. 

The rooftop pool and bar is beautiful and has views of the historic Gothic Quarter. You can order from the restaurant menu to be delivered to the pool. The location was excellent as well: right on Las Ramblas, the main promenade of shopping and restaurants and very close to the Gothic quarter. Also, several of our tours left from the nearby Plaza Catalunya (Hard Rock restaurant).",5,2016,06,15
27,Staff could give lessons to other boutique hotels,Top notch staff. Very attentive and quick to anticipate our needs. We had problems with our tickets (our fault) and they volunteered to call each attraction and move the times and dates for us even though some tickets were expired. Three different members of the front desk staff recommended restaurants and all of them were excellent. The restaurant staff remembered the breakfast orders for the four people in our group. ,5,2016,06,10
27,Perfect Stay,"We were only at Hotel Bagues for one night before we boarded our cruise ship.  We booked a Jewel Suite which was perfect for us.  It had a nice outdoor area overlooking La Rambla and we never heard any noise at all.  While the hotel was great, it was the people that made our stay memorable.  Everyone from the gentleman at the door to the front desk and restaurant staff were very warm and helpful.  They gave us tips on where to eat, how to get from one place to another and helped get us in our room early after a long flight.  The candy  in the lobby was a nice treat too.  Would definitely stay there again, we loved it!",5,2016,06,06
27,A marvellous long weekend,"First rate comfort and the attention to detail from the very pleasant staff was seriously impressive. The small size and boutique nature of the hotel dictate that facilities like gym and pool are limited but for a short break, this is the perfect venue ",5,2016,05,31
27,A vacation before a vacation,"This boutique hotel is right on La Rambles but you don't hear any on the multitude of people walking around. I t is a SMALL hotel with small rooms and small bathrooms. B U T the quality of the linens and furnishings are 5 star. There is a restaurant on the ground with very good food; but what makes this place really superior is the front desk people. Friendly, pleasant, bend-over-backwards not-too-much-trouble people. Mess up your booked tour? No problem . . .they call and workout options for you. Just good old fashioned customer is the highest priority attitude. Don't stay anywhere else1",5,2016,05,28
27,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"We decided to splash out on a posh hotel right in the heart of Barcelona and we weren't disappointed.
Our room was beautiful facing an old church across the street. The room was well appointed with a stunning bathroom. 
Overall the service in the hotel was top notch, the reception team were very friendly and made us very welcome.
It was badged as a 5 star hotel but I would consider it a 4.5 star, it was great but was just missing the final luxury X factor.
I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,05,24
27,A boutique hotel in excellent location,"The location of this hotel is the first factor for me to select it, located on the famous Las Ramblas street with all shopping area and some major attraction around. 
Recently renovated hotel with good decorated rooms.
Excellent friendly staff / concierge, Highly recommended.
The only negative point is the vibration from the underground metro that take place every 10-15 minutes",4,2016,05,22
27,Barcelona,"place to stay in Barcelona, in the hart of old Barcelona, brilliant spot, not eaten at this place only because of all other places to eat within walking distance.
so many places to see, very handy for F1 ",5,2016,05,19
27,Hotel on La Ramblas,Very nice hotel part of the Small leading hotels of the world. The service is excellent. The location is right on La Rambla witch is an advantage being centered but also can be annoying walking back home in the evening with all the solicitors on the street. The St Joseph open market next to the hotel is very good for breakfast and lunch.,5,2016,05,18
27,No complaints at all! Perfect stay,"The location and service at this hotel is simply outstanding. I suffered a fall a week before my vacation in Barcelona. I contacted the hotel in regards to a wheelchair. The staff made calls and helped me rent one for the 3 night duration, including drop off and pick up. The front desk was always eager to help, and spoke excellent English. The housekeeping was always efficient. The sleep spray with the essential oils was a unique and nice touch. The location is right in the middle of all the activity. You cannot go wrong with this choice of hotel for Barcelona.",5,2016,05,17
27,Best Location in Barcelona,"Outstanding hotel, which in our opinion has the best location in Barcelona on La Ramblas, being close enough to the market to use it for breakfast every day. 
We will definitely be back again next year!",5,2016,05,17
27,Pleasure to have stayed at this hotel with a exceptional location,"Great location and excellent service, would stay here again in future. Not as noisy as I thought it would be. Close to all major attractions. Starbucks, chox and various branded stores aswell as souvenir store across the road.",5,2016,05,11
27,"Excellent location, service minded staff at the reception","God location for a week-end trip, excellent staff at the reception. However, the subway running under the hotel can be disturbing, and the bathroom is a bit dark & over-designed. The last evening, the room was not made-up.",5,2016,05,06
27,Fantastic stay in Barcelona,Excellent hotel right off Las Ramblas and practically next door to the famous market. Rooms were clean and well appointed. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I will definitely stay here again when I'm back in Barcelona. ,5,2016,05,04
27,"Excellent staff, very good location, comfortable accommodations, & good value at Hotel Bagues","We had a most enjoyable 3 days in April at the Hotel Bagues in Barcelona.  The excellent desk staff -- especially Claudia & Nicolas, and also Joan & Tomas -- were most welcoming and helpful; they deserve every plaudit.  On La Rambla & very near the Gothic Quarter, the hotel is in an ideal location to explore old Barcelona and the fascinating area around the medieval Cathedral; it is but a short walk to the Picasso Museum, numerous good restaurants, the Marina and Barceloneta. The Bagues's accommodations are well equipped and comfortable, its windows are double-glazed, the free WiFi worked well, and the hotel is good value for the money.  We would definitely stay there again.",5,2016,05,02
27,Amazing Hotel,This hotel is wonderful! Very interesting architecture- the stair and hallway follow a spiral pattern. Walls and floors are all hard wood-slate-marble- absolutely beautiful. We arrived much to early to check in but they were able to find us a room. They also included breakfast. I am handicapped and had a fall in the tub (my fault). They immediately sent up two lovely young men to help me up. Embarrassing for all involved. They wouldn't accept anything but thanks for their help. They sent a bottle of mineral water and wonderful chocolates at bedtime. The free breakfast is great!  They converted our one bed to two. Staff was friendly- helpful and knowledgable about the area. I highly recommend this hotel!,5,2016,05,01
27,Hotel in Barcelona,"Great hotel, even better staff. Help make over experience wonderful.Staff made our restaurant suggestions and reservations. They even helped give directions to cab drivers if we needed assistance. Outstanding hotel experience.",5,2016,04,30
27,"Friendly, pleasant staff; great location","We booked a classic double room and were on the 6th floor.  While located directly on the main tourist street of La Rambla, we found this boutique hotel to be very quiet just as other reviewers have pointed out and we had a terrace overlooking the street.  The room was nice sized by European standards with a large, well appointed bathroom.  The rooftop terrace is very pleasant though we hit a bit of a cold spell so didn't use it much.  For convenience, we purchased the breakfast which was not included with our room but for which they gave us a discount.  There was a nice buffet of fresh fruit, cold items, and a menu on the tables for ordering hot items such as pancakes, eggs cooked a variety of ways, etc.

We arrived early morning from a cruise ship so our room was not ready.  We left our luggage and went out touring.  When we returned, we were checked in and our luggage was already in the room.

Only 2 minor complaints.  Because we like to tour early, we eat dinner early.  The restaurant at the hotel does not open until 8:30 for dinner so we never tried it.  The bathroom has very modern fixtures including a very large rectangular basin.  It has a flat bottom and there is virtually no way to prevent the water from splashing.

However, these very minor things are completely overcome by the efficient, friendly staff and there are plenty of restaurants in the area.",5,2016,04,29
27,"Wonderful, sleek city hotel",My husband booked a 3 night stay for my 30th birthday earlier this month and I was not disappointed. The hotel is extremely stylish and there are some lovely little touches like pick and mix in the lobby and fresh red roses in the bathroom. We have strayed in several SLH hotels before and this fits the collection. We loved the location right by the mercat de la boqueria. Upon our arrival we we greeted with cava and truffles (in assured it was a reasonable price!) and we were given a room with a beautiful view down la rambla. The staff were very helpful and diligent and we enjoyed drinks being brought up to us in the roof terrace which head fantastic views of the city. If you are considering splashing out a little and booking this place go for it. You won't be disappointed.,5,2016,04,25
27,Excellent stay in wonderful hotel,"Love this hotel! The staff and services were excellent! From the moment we walked in, everyone went out of their way to make our stay in this hotel a memory of a life time. The location was excellent for visiting the city and port areas and an easy walk to the city tour bus area. ",5,2016,04,25
27,Location Location Location,"Another top location for us as we travel around Europe
Right on the La Rambla, it could not have been better
Easy access to most places by walking and the atmosphere was fantastic
Great hotel with good service and staff",4,2016,04,25
27,Five Star Service,Our room was stunning and overlooked La Rambla - it was very well sound proofed as the noisy La Rambla did not disturb us.  It was spotlessly clean and room service attended twice a day to clean and turn down beds - leaving chocolates and slippers.  The small touches such as a lavender sleep spray included in the toiletries were lovely. The service was first class - We arrived late for breakfast one day but the chef and staff still served us a hot breakfast.  Nothing was too much trouble.  The location is fine if you want to be central however La Rambla itself isn't the nicest street but it suited us for getting around.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.  First class.,5,2016,04,20
27,When in Barcelona!,"Very good hotel, extremely helpful and service minded staff. Can't be better. Located at the heart of Barcelona. Walking distance to harbour and shopping. A perfect hotel for a week or weekend stay. Absolutely recommended.",5,2016,04,18
27,Buemo!,"Do yourself a favor and visit Barcelona for at least 4 days to capture highlights, and stay at the Bagues Hotel. The staff there were pleasant and professional. The breakfast  featured dishes beautifully presented and comprised of quality ingredients. Rooftop cocktails before dinner is a must. Tour the Sagrada Familia and Picasso museum to complete your experience. ",5,2016,04,14
27,Boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"Excellent small boutique hotel in La Rambla. The rooms are darkly decorated, and spacious. However the bed was too hard for me, and I didn't sleep well, but this is just depending on your personal preferences. Very nice rooftop terrace. Superb breakfast, but very pricey (hence the five stars). Great location, and next to La Boqueria market hall. Would recommend!",4,2016,04,11
27,"Excellent hotel, great location, great value.",Internet was spotty and week from our room(101). The hotel staff were friendly and very helpful with suggestions and guidance. We were delighted with the food in the restaurant. The location was on the Calle La Rambla. We booked the room 3 months in advance and got an extremely good price.,5,2016,04,05
27,"Overpriced, didn't feel 5 star!","This is a well located hotel situated right on Las Ramblas.

It's a cool designer hotel.

Hotel smells nice & looks nice, but there was something lacking... Staff we're helpful, but felt untrained and slightly unprofessional. Just a lack of attention to service detail & any essence of hospitality, which is expect for a 5 star hotel, more a 4 star in my opinion.

Terrace was nice, never staffed though when I stayed, no cushions on very nice designer chairs.

Restaurant is in the reception, a partition wall separates, but still feels wrong. 

The bar is terrible, low children like seats, very awkward and in enjoyable.

Rooms are very nice, TV is well off centre to bed, strain to see it (don't know why hotels do this). Great rainfall power shower though!

I paid over £230 a night, so it felt as if it was overpriced. Would have been much better if there was any type of service other than a cool looking door guy & a couple of disorganised guys on reception.

",3,2016,04,03
27,Loved it,"Amazingly friendly staff, nice, clean, comfortable rooms.  Great location, walking distance to everything.  Staff great with recommendations for planning your stay.  VERY quiet rooms notwithstanding location on very busy street.  Would certainly stay again.  ",5,2016,03,30
27,Great location and staff! ,"We stayed here for 5 nights. Perfect location and great staff. Rooms are a little small but when you are in Barcelona, you come to your room only to sleep. The city is so buzzing. A lady at the front desk gave us suggestions to go to the restaurants and bars. They also had VIP vouchers to some nightclubs. Overall a good choice! ",5,2016,03,29
27,Amazing staff,Small rooms for those who did not mind. Hotel and excellent staff attitude . Excellent location near the Ramblas Avenue Market . They have a small sweet surprises in the entrance ... quite nice I like,4,2016,03,27
27,Fab location,"This hotel was perfect in every way except the following:
The wifi did not work for the entire 4 days
Also, there is no full length mirror in the rooms meaning it's difficult to know what you look like after getting dressed.
There is only one plug socket that is near enough a mirror to be able to style hair so this was quite time consuming as both myskef & my sister had to take it in turns to get ready.

Apart from that, I can't fault the hotel.
The rooms were spotless, the reception staff were brilliant - so helpful & friendly, they really put us at ease.
The location of the hotel is brilliant.
It's is right in the centre of Las Ramblas so it is easy to get to & from &  there is so much to do in that area.
The roof top terrace is also gorgeous & provides superb views of the city - just a shame the weather wasn't great.
I would defo go back & to stay.
I have recommended the hotel to my mum &  dad who are planning on visiting Barcelona in September.",4,2016,03,23
27,Stay at Bagues hotel,"Will come back for sure
This is my second visit to barca and to this specific hotel
I enjoeyd it very much .
The location of the hotel is excellent!!

The deasign of the hotel rooms was very nice .perfect location every thing is near  you can just walkrecomend you to stay in  either your a couple or group of friends you will enjoy defenetly.,5,2016,03,19
27,Ashley,"Lovely.p, central hotel, staffed by charming and willing people.
The hotel is in a great positio ,all staff are very helpful. Delicious selection of sweets to help yourself to.
Big TVs in the rooms and the top floor pool area was really smart.",5,2016,03,18
27,little GEM in middle of La rambla,Great location on the main strip - La rambla. This is boutique hotel with an eye detail & quality. The service was excellent & the experience great. Given its location it made our holiday even better. The only complaint was that there was no full length mirror. The food and the wine in this city are outstanding. We were in Barcelona for  6 nights. All the meals were great and did not have one glass of bad wine - which is unusual given we were out dining every night and trying 4 or 5 glasses of different wines each night.,5,2016,03,17
27,Great location and concierge,"We stayed here for a short break in March 2016.  An excellent location, particularly for visiting the old town area.  The conceriege staff was excellent, particularly, Claudia.  The only downside was that the overall ambience of the hotel was a little dark and the bathroom and bedroom in our suite were rather small and a bit ""over designed"".  Nowhere to put ""stuff"" in the bathroom.  However, we had a lovely balcony and the general charm of the staff more than made up for this.  Would recommend to couples or singles.",4,2016,03,13
27,Perfect weekend break!,"This hotel is beautiful and in the centre of everything you would want to do and visit as a tourist. Even though it is on such a busy strip when you're in your room you hear nothing from the outside! The rooms are not overly spacious but that didn't bother us in the slightest as they were beautifully decorated. The main thing that made this hotel for us so special was the customer service, this was the main factor that made this hotel live up to its 5 star rating. The young man who greeted us went above and beyond to make sure we had as much information as we needed for our short stay, he recommended some lovely cocktail bars to go to and outlined all the must see places of Barcelona he was super friendly, helpful and made us feel so welcome and comfortable straight away! Overall couldn't of asked for a better hotel to stay in during our trip I will definitely be staying in this hotel if I ever return to Barcelona! Prefect location and even more perfect staff! Thank you Hotel Bagues.",5,2016,03,08
27,"Fantastic hotel, great service and location","I highly recommend this hotel. From arrival to departure everything was excellent. The staff extremely helpful  and friendly. The room very comfortable and well made with great view of La Ramblas. Excellent bed. Breakfast was also good with a very good selection of hot and cold foods. Dinner in the restaurant was also delicious. 

I stay in hotels a lot for work, mostly in the UK and Hotel Bagues offered a superior service to most of them for a similar price. 

If you're looking for a high quality, luxury hotel in the heart of the city look no further. 

I left something behind at the hotel due to rushing to the airport and they have been extremely helpful shipping it home too!",5,2016,03,06
27,Middle of La Rambla,"Great location as it is right where the action is. Shops, restaurant and only few steps away from a lovely market place.
The staff are wonderful and very friendly. The rooms are very clean and comfortable but I would prefer the rooms at top floors as it gets to be less noisy. However, the size is not as what I would expect from a 5 star hotel.",4,2016,03,03
27,Hip New Hotel,Very new hip hotel and centrally located in the Ramblas. The price is great too. We arrived and the guy at the front desk was super friendly and helpful. He gave us many great tips from sightseeing to being aware of pick pocketing activity. He gave us a map and even showed us how to take the Metro.  Upon arriving to our room we had sparkling water and a note welcoming us. The rooms nice and bathrooms as well. The elevators are a bit small one person and luggage can fit only but you can take a walk up as well. I really liked this hotel and highly recommend it. ,5,2016,02,25
27,"Elegant, boutique and luxury","When you stay at Hotel Bagues, you are living on Las Ramblas.

There's no need to mention the great location of the hotel, the view of the Las Ramblas and countless food options within easy walking distance.

What this hotel sets itself apart from the 5* hotels in Barcelona is the touches in rooms, service and style. Every room is unique in this hotel and as a matter of fact, the rooms are on the outside of the building with a circular stair in the middle. The furniture, bedding, bathroom and lighting in room are stylish and ergonomic, possibly inspired by their fellow Catalan Gaudi.

We like the shower facility. The shower room is small but the water pressure is superb! You can feel the strong pressure from streams coming out of the shower head, but you don't feel hurt. The only comparable shower system is the rain forest shower from Park Hyatt. The bathroom amenities are also very pleasant to find. They provide a small bottle of sleeping spray with essential oil, and my wife found it very useful.

We had a room facing Las Ramblas with a small patio. The room is very quiet even at evening prime time. The room service is extremely attentive and the maid brings in a wood basket with sheets and carefully clean your room. You can feel they are serving your room with heart not just doing their jobs.

Breakfast comes with a small selection of cold meats and fruits. You can also order from a small menu. All items are well prepared with good taste. Hotel staff are friendly and helpful. They speak good English. During my stay, they managed to book a Michelin star restaurant for us which is usually hard to book at last minute. 

This hotel is a member of SLH, one of the more selective hotel chains, and it definitely lives up to the standard.

I also considered Le Meridien and W at booking time. I'm happy I chose Hotel Bagues.",5,2016,02,25
27,visit to Mobile World Congress,I stayed in this hotel for one night it seems to have been newly remodeled. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and helpful the rooms were very clean and very comfortable and very modern. Only stayed for one night. But would stay here again anytime I come to Barcelona,5,2016,02,24
27,Great visit,Great staff - very helpful. Room was excellent but heard the metro until late at night and early in the morning. Better to have view over the street rather than an internal room as these overlook the landings and the lifts - can be claustrophobic for some. Location excellent.,4,2016,02,19
27,A wonderful stay,The hotel is in an excellent location. The room we had was comfortable and very well equipped. We enjoyed both breakfast and dinner in the restaurant with a reduction of 30% on the menu costs which was most welcome. The gym equipment and steam room were clean and well set out. The staff were excellent throughout our stay.,5,2016,02,18
27,Small and lovely hotel,"If you want to book a neat, beautiful and lovely hotel, Bagues would be one of your best choices in Barcelona. it is located in downtown with a good access to shopping area, Mediterranean sea and metro network. Rooms with La Rambla street view are better but if you want to have more silent room, ask for rooms with church view. The staff are very nice and friendly.",4,2016,02,18
27,What a jewel,"This renovated jewellery workshop turned out to be the perfect base for our three night stay. 

Small 31 room boutique hotel is very elegantly decorated in rooms and public areas and immaculately kept. Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.  

Main plus was its excellent location right next to amazing Boqueria food market (where you can eat as well as shop) but also whilst Las Ramblas is indeed busy it leads you straight down to the port area or up to main retail area. Best for us though walk directly across Ramblas and you are right into heart of the Gothic quarter with independent shops, tapas, bars and the Cathedral. 

Our Superior room was at the front in the middle of three and enjoyed views up and down the street from Juliet balcony. 

Restaurant was tempting as appeared top quality but a little pricey Eur 49 for Degustation plus Eur 22 wine pairing and being first visit we preferred to explore the city. Discount for guests may be offered. 

Roof top bar is nice feature with city views. Closed off-season but just call room service for drinks on this 7th floor. Don't expect a swimming pool though this is a one person wide more like plunge pool to cool off in summer. 

Can't comment on value for money as came part of a flight+hotel package but in terms of pure enjoyment, comfort and quality this was one of the best city hotels we've stayed at.",5,2016,02,04
27,Fabulous Vacation in Barcelona,"My daughter and I stayed at this Fabulous Hotel in Barcelona. It is a small but lovely hotel, very clean and efficient. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. It is located on Les Rambles and walking distance to everything. Our room was very comfortable and  had a balcony overlooking Les Rambles which we enjoyed. Loved it and would definitely recommend it.
Thinking of going back with my Husband.",5,2016,02,04
27,Great staff and central location,"It's a small hotel, but seems to have all the necessities. We only stayed for 2 nights, but it was perfect for us. Good location and staff couldn't do enough to help us. Would definitely go back, especially during the summer as it would be nice to use the rooftop bar.",4,2016,01,30
27,"Beautiful hotel,Convenient Location","Beautiful traditional exterior with modern interior hotel stand on a busy precinct but sound proof room made it up.Hotel is spotlessly clean. BEdroom and bathrooms are beautifully designed with touch of elegance.Bathroom is decorated with graphite stone and quality fittings.
Bedroom is provided with fridge and tea coffee making facilities. We found room bit warm and stuffy in the night. 
Hotel is pleasantly situated with in close vicinity of tourist attractions,Shopping,and transport facility.One end of the street stretch to the.main town square and anotherend to marina which are all with in walking distance of 10,14 minutes.Street stall offers variety of food with generous portions at a competitive price.There are good quality restaurants around the town square.One of the the popular tourist attractions is a fruit market which is with walking distance of 5 minutes from the hotel.Overall we had a pleasant stay at this hotel and lovely holiday in Barcelona..wish the same for all fellow travellers. .Have a happy holiday🙋🙋🙋🙋",4,2016,01,29
27,Short Weekend in Spain,"Surprised my mom on her 50 years birth day with a short trip around Spain. We arrived to the hotel excatly on her birthday - while receptionist was nice and welcoming, overall the stay in hotel was bellow any expectations. Room was very small, window bearely excisting. No plase to hang or put our things, nor to put a glass of champagne (if television table wasn´t there...). While you in shower, expect your robe and clothes to be on the floor, as there is absolotely no place to put them. No one ever expressed any congratilations to my moms b day, which I found to be pretty sad - as I communicated to the hotel beforehand, when considered ordering champagne on our arrival (but then used the one in mini bar instead). Overall not worth the price. And the roof terace... not worth even mentioning.",3,2016,01,28
27,"Great Hotel, great location",Service was excellent and the room was huge and roomy with a view of La Rambla.  I particularly enjoyed the free candy in the lobby!  The price was reasonable for Europe and the location was very central with close access to the subway and walking distance from many attractions including the famous Market!,5,2016,01,27
27,Birthday surprise,"Just had two nights at this hotel and it was fantastic, perfect location, staff couldn't do enough for you even gave me birthday bottle of wine in the room and the restaurant is amazing!!!! 
Even get 30% of restaurant for residents which was very nice. Will defiantly be going back ",5,2016,01,17
27,Fantastic stay,"Hotel Bagues was a great choice for a hotel.
It's centrally located on Las Ramblas making it ideal for getting out and exploring and never being too far from home.
What really impressed me was the service on reception and other staff, always happy to answer questions and never too much to help out.  We went to watch a Barcelona game and the reception staff helped by booking the ticket online for me and getting a seat with my partner.
They were also excellent at recommending restaurants to try and suggestions for touristy things.
Can't wait to go back.",5,2016,01,11
27,Great location!,"We had a wonderful experience in this hotel. Our room was small but extremely quiet, everything is beautifully designed. The location is great, the Gothic Quarter, the Boquería, and a beautiful old Pastry Shop are around the corner.",5,2016,01,10
27,"Boutique Hotel, with very helpful staffs","This is a boutique hotel, which I don't usually stay with.  However, I don't regret making that choice.  The hotel turned out to be a lot more than I expected.  The hotel was converted from an old building, however, you won't be able to notice that once you are inside the hotel. The view from the hotel was excellent, great view of La Rambla.  The rooftop view is very good too, so don't miss that.

The staffs were very helpful and very cheerful.  The room was a bit small, but that's no big deal. The location is excellent, you are walk to many attractions, or take short taxi rides, and even the metro.",5,2016,01,04
27,Wonderful property in a great location,"We loved this place...La Rambla at your doorstep and so close to many other iconic Barcelona locations. All of our favourite places to visit are within walking distance of the hotel. The property itself is a classic five star boutique experience; the décor, ambience and room furnishings were tastefully done throughout. The terrace has a nice swimming pool and great views of Barcelona itself. And even though it's on La Rambla, the rooms are so well insulated there was minimal noise even though we were facing the street. The gym isn't much - a treadmill and bike. And there are no irons in the room - it's an old, iconic building so the fire codes prevent irons in the room. There is, however, laundry service should you need it. We'll be back!",5,2016,01,02
27,In the heart of Barcelona,"Situated mid of the Ramblas
Small, but nice and cosy rooms!
Very quiet- exellent sound-insulation
Walking distance to the City/ Old town (5- 15 min)
30 % discount for hotel-guests for breakfast and exellent small  restaurant
Rooftop terrace: We enjoyed 20° C end of december!",5,2015,12,31
27,Discovering Barcelona  ,"Location location location that is what Hotel Bagues offers. Our deluxe room 403 was a corner room. Even though the room was on La Rambles the windows were double glazed and the room was very quiet. 50 metres from La Boqueria. We had breakfast there each morning as opposed to the hotel. The terrace bar had good views over the city. Drinks were expensive. Shower was just ok. Pillows were bad, not up to a 5 star standard. I will check out another hotel next time in Barcelona. ",4,2015,12,26
27,Great Location ,"I stayed here for a long weekend and found this boutique hotel to be a right gem. Situated on la Ramblas it's location is perfect as it is within walking distance to everything you should need. The rooms were of a high standard and even tho a little on the small side, for the quality of room and finish I was happy to pay that little bit extra. The staff we're very friendly and their is a lovely roof top bar and swimming pool where you can relax and chill out in the evenings whilst watching the town come alive. If you want a little luxury in a great location you can't go far wrong with this hotel.
",4,2015,12,26
27,Central location,Just spent one night in this hotel. It's very central and ideal for a weekend break/city break. The staff were very friendly and very willing to help. Sweats in lobby were a quirky touch. The room was very well finished with top quality gear (b&g tv). They were tight with space but as with any city centre hotel it generally is. The room had no window to the outside but it really didn't matter. This location is perfect to tour the city from. It's a little Oasis from the huddle outside. The bar is nice with an unusual choice of drinks which was great. I didn't have breakfast no I can't say how that was. Top hotel for a city break. ,4,2015,12,25
27,Simply stunning,"Visited here ar the end of our trip. The hotel was stunning and very centraly located and easy walking distance to 2 metro stations. 

Arrived late and was greated with a happy desk agent who explained the area and attractions and a bit of the local history. Which i loved as we hadnt realy planned to do much

Room was decorated stunningly the only downside was the bathroom door which was clear glass and allowed you to see people showering. Beeing a honeymoon this was no problem for me but others could find it awkward.

All up though this hotel was stunning and will defently be staying there again when in barcelona next. ",5,2015,12,23
27,Return visit,"This boutique hotel is situated on Las Rambles ideally  situated to all the sites, the Gothic quarter, restaurants, museums, shops and the beach. This is our third visit to this Hotel. All the staff are wonderful so helpful and informative, nothing to much trouble. The doorman w ho is always on hand to get a taxi has a great sense of humour and always has a smile for you. The rooms are small but tastefully decorated with a lovely bathroom that is all black with glass and chrome. Good toiletries bathrobes and slippers and kept very clean by housekeeping. I love this hotel, breakfast is very good with a hot choice menu. The biilinis are wonderful especially served with a glass of cold cava.",5,2015,12,19
27,"A Centrally-located, Posh, Hotel w/ Minor Blemishes","The Hotel Bagues is a sleek, modern hotel centrally located in The Ramblas neighborhood of Barcelona. The hotel features many of the amenities associated with a five-star hotel (a rooftop bar, sauna services, the best jet-streamed bath we've had in our vacation). However, the hotel lacked several key elements that really prevented the hotel from a five-star rating.

Let's start with the wifi. The wifi access required a lengthy (potentially 5-10 minutes) process to be logged on to their connection. Premium water bottle service, while great, was only offered two out of our four nights. Basic amenities like an iron and ironing board were not available (michemiche88's review on November 30th is a worthwhile read). Also, do not stay in a room that end in ""01"" (i.e. 201, 301), as you might hear the noises of the elevator the entire night.

Those criticisms aside, we had a pleasant four-night stay at Hotel Bagues in mid December. The windows are super sound proof (we did not hear a thing when we switched our rooms facing Las Ramblas). We were (almost) always centrally located from where we wanted visit. And the staff is super friendly and helpful. Overall, the Hotel Bagues is a solid hotel, especially if you get a great deal.",4,2015,12,15
27,"Excellent Barcelona Hotel: service, food and ambiance","We spent 12/2-12/8 with out group of 18. All of us were extremely impressed. Close to metro walking distance to a many sight seeing options. Breakfast in the morning is wonderful here but many places around offer coffee and croissants to go with in 25 yards. Grocery and pharmacy across street and 1 is 24 hour pharmacy. beds comfortable, ample pillows, supremely hot showers a plus. Design and flavor of hotel is fabulous. Rooftop bar service and view are outstanding. But most importantly, the service was always top notch. We called upon their good graces more than we had anticipated and they never ceased to amaze us with their enthusiasm to help. Ask for a balcony room. you'll appreciate it. Everything is within a few steps away. it really is a fab hotel if it's your first time to Barcelona.",5,2015,12,08
27,Perfect Holiday location,"We stayed at Hotel Bagues for 6 nights in late November.  It is a centrally located boutique hotel with very attentive and friendly staff.  We stayed in a superior king room with views of the Rambla. The rooms are nicely appointed, very clean and the service was excellent including evening turndown with chocolates and wine on the first night. The lesser rooms only had windows into the central stair.  La Rambla was a bit loud at night but it didn't bother us.  ",5,2015,12,02
27,Excellent,"Amazing stay, friendly staff who cannot do enough to assist you. 5* quality finishes and little touches in the room. Perfect location.would recommend and stay again. Enjoyed the views of the ramblas from the room. 
      ",5,2015,12,01
27,Beautiful polish but lacking key standard elements,"As a point of context, I stayed at this hotel when working in the city rather than on vacation. 

First of all, this is a really beautiful hotel, all the designer touches are there and there were lots of thoughtful extras like a bottle of water brought to the room with truffles. Certainly the finishes you'd expect of a high class hotel. 

However, somehow some of the more basic items were overlooked. 

Primarily, there is no iron setup at all in the room. This is critical on a business trip and is standard in even a much lower rated hotel. They did offer to send it to the laundry service, with the guarantee that I would get my clothes by the morning. That timeframe passed, and though I did get my shirts, the jacket I was told was being sent to a dry-cleaner. Naturally I need these articles to actually go to work and meet with customers. I asked that they just iron at low temperature as this is something I commonly accomplished at home on my own. Finally, when I got my clothes, I was shocked to be presented with a bill, which was not insane but I can only imagine what it would've been if i'd allowed them to send my freshly dry-cleaned jacket back to a cleaner. This is company travel, so it is not even the cost that bothers me, but the principle of having to pay for something that is so basic, especially when it was not even mentioned at the outset. 

Wifi, also critical for a business trip, has been spotty and taken up to 30 mins to start working once you've logged in again. 

The other distressing item is the clear glass doors. They have come into the rooms a lot, and even though I am traveling alone it gave me huge concern b/c I had no idea when to expect someone to be coming into my room when I might be in the shower and not hear them knock. 

I also had a room with no window - I can't complain about this as I should have read more closely into my booking, but definitely be aware that is a possibility if that will be a big deal to you. 

The staff has been very kind and helpful but I question some of the managerial decisions being made. ",3,2015,11,30
27,"Beautiful hotel, Amazing Staff & Delicious Food","I spent five unforgettable days staying in Bagues Hotel. The hotel is located right on Las Ramblas with easy access to the metro and Gothic center.  My room had a balcony facing La Rambbut, comfortable and quiet, no noise at all at night. The front desk personnel was very helpful, friendly and always with a smile....felt like home. Nicholas helped me find hidden gems in the city, search for restaurants and coffee places. Restaurant served delicious food with artistic flavored decoration. 
Right around the corner is Chök where you will find amazing doughnuts with all sorts of toppings, the best chocolate and espresso. The famous  Boqueria Market is only couple of minutes walk from the hotel. ",5,2015,11,26
27,Hotel Bagues,"Hotel Bagues is an excellent location on the Las Ramblas. The room was small but elegant and the service was great. The front desk was very helpful . it is a newly remodeled hotel with a Jacuzzi in the room. I received a free ticket to the Musei Egypci.
      
      
      
      ",5,2015,11,24
27,Brilliant ,"We have just returned from a three day stay at this hotel and this has to be the rated as a great hotel. Staff were so frendly and helpful I would find it hard to fault, our room was great beautiful decor and well laid out over looking La Rambla. Breakfast was a feast of meats and cheeses all fresh with a choice of cereals and even a choice of cooked breakfasts which we didn't expect. And to top it all off even a glass of cava to wash it all down with.

We also had a meal there in the evening the quality was without fault. I was a little bit wary of the price but they were offering 30% off the price of the meal. We had three courses each with a good bottle of rijoca for the amazing price of 90 euros.

Once again a thanks to the amazing staff who made our stay such a pleasure",5,2015,11,21
27,Wonderful Hotel Right on Las Ramblas,"We couldn't have found a better location for our recent visit to Barcelona. The Hotel Bagues was a delight from the moment we checked in. The staff was wonderful and explained that even though our room wasn't ready when we arrived so early in the morning from the states, that it would be ready in a few hours and made suggestions on where to go. They happily took our luggage and said it would be in our room when we returned. Two doors away was the La Boqueria, the wonderful open air market full of Spanish delicacies. The hotel is located right on Las Ramblas, the beautiful big boulevard frequented by locals and tourists with lots of stores and restaurants. Although our hotel room was not huge by Western standards, it was plenty roomy and very luxurious. Our room opened onto a balcony above Las Ramblas and with the windows closed, there was no noise.. The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean. There was a wonderful shower and bidet in the bathroom. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2015,11,20
27,"My new benchmark for Style, Design and Class.","Done in a way that would have brought a smile to Antoni Gaudi himself.  Hotel Bagues is pure design, total detail, splendor at every turn.  Better than what one would see in Architectural Digest. Curves, texture, form everywhere you turn.  Unique substances and materials.  Beauty and a work of art all in one package.  So tastefully done.  Then the staff --- helpful, friendly, and personal.  Without question, my best lodging ever.  A new benchmark for me. A new number one.  Thanks for a great stay in a beautiful city filled with beautiful people.",5,2015,11,12
27,The best hotel in Barcelona!,"As my title indicates, this is the best hotel in Barcelona.  The staff is VERY friendly and does everything possible to make your stay as comfortable as possible.  The rooms are spacious (by European standards), well appointed and clean.  The hotel is situated in a perfect place for easy access to everything in Barcelona.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone!",5,2015,11,09
27,Well placed hotel,"Very helpful, friendly and efficient staff at reception throughout our stay in this central hotel. Room clean and comfortable with a nice bathroom and some little touches, such as the weather forecast for tomorrow and a chocolate with bed turndown.  Had the 8 course meal in the restaurant one night and it was very good and excellent value. The only downside is that the bar isn't really a bar after 8pm as it's effectively in the restaurant with just a couple of stools if all the tables are booked. One of our party cannot sit on these and so we were turned away from our own hotel when we returned for a drink. Not what you expect. ",4,2015,10,28
27,A Boutique Hotel at La Rambla,"The Hotel has a good location. But it is really a Boutique Hotel. Rooms were fairly small and some did not even have any windows in them. Service was good. But for the price , the breakfast was very limited. The problem with some Bathroom doors were that they were fairly transparent. Since we had friends sharing the rooms it became fairly awkward.
Though there was free Wi -fi but one had to login everytime one entered the hotel and at times it would not connect properly despite that.",3,2015,10,20
27,Wonderful Hotel,"Wonderful stay at the Bagues Hotel. The room was beautiful and spotless. We had a room overlooking La Rambla and enjoyed watching the people late at night from our window. The location was great, we were within walking distance of restaurants and shopping and sites. It was an easy walk to get the HopOn HopOff trolley and the port. The breakfast was good. The young men at the desk were very friendly and helpful, answering questions and giving advice.  i'm spoiled now in Barcelona, I don't think any other hotel would live up to this one.",5,2015,10,17
27,Perfect Boutique Hotel,"Our first time visiting Barcelona so we wanted a hotel that would be special.

This hotel is perfect. The location is spot on by the La Rambla. We had a lovely view from our room. 

This hotel is close to the shops, bars & restaurants.

The staff were professional and friendly. They couldn't do enough for us. 

We used the sauna daily no problems, and the roof top terrace & pool was very clean & we had amazing views of Barcelona from there. 

Hotel Bagues is a very special boutique hotel. So glad we came here.

Will definitely be back soon.

27,Yes and No,"Wonderfull staff at this hotel.Reception staff were excellent.
The standard of cleanliness was superb,especially room service 
The location is idea and although it's on a busy road there was no noise.We didn't eat breakfast as like other reviewers we 
are not great breakfast eaters.
The only downside was our room was so dark with a window looking into a shaft. We had to have lights on all the time.",4,2015,10,07
27,Great Location and View,"We recently stayed here for 5 nights.  I worry a lot about choosing the right hotel based on amenities, location, and safety.  If you look for these things as well, than this is the place for you.  It is located right near the Liceu metro and about a 5 minute walk from Placa Catalanya which is where the Aerobus drops you off from the airport.  The roof top bar is quaint and offers nice views for relaxing before a night out.  The staff is attentive and in order to get up to your room you have to enter your key card- which offers me the safety I look for.  We didn't purchase the breakfast option as we aren't big breakfast eaters.  There is a 365 (coffee and pastry literally right around the corner).  La Boqueria is right up the street and another good option for a coffee/pastry.  As for the room we had 402.  It is on the side street overlooking the church and it is amazing that when you close the little balcony door (not a balcony you can sit on) you can not hear the noise at all from La Rambla.  The shower is amazing and there is plenty of room with a nice chaise lounge.  I would stay here again if I go back.",4,2015,09,29
27,A gem in the centre of Barcelona,"This was a truly delightful experience for my daughter and myself. A great high quality, centrally located and most friendly and knowledgeable hotel. Facilities are good and style quite modern and fresh in a traditional setting.

27,4 Star Botique Hotel,"4 Star Hotel, nicely appointed with great service. Front desk staff and bellman very helpful. Clean rooms nicely appointed. Staff was very helpful. High quality restaurant off the lobby. Great views from rooftop deck.

27,Beautiful hotel,"Loved staying here,the hotel is so modern and beautiful decoration.  The views of Las Ramblas from the room are stunning.

27,Travel Agent review ,"Great hotel! Small but very big in service and the location is in the middle of the action to say the least!

2 mins walk on the right is the food market and other restaurants for good eats and 3 min walk to the left is the palace d Catalunya! Most rooms have balconies so you can do some people watching and most definitely upgrade to the superior rooms for better views and amazing bathrooms.

Check in staff were amazing and very courteous and pointed out some amazing things to do. Hop on hop off starts at palace Catalunya so you can go there to start your trip. Also take the aerobus from the airport for 5 euros right to the palace Catalunya and you're right there. 

All in all a fantastic stay!",5,2015,09,18
27,Excellent,"This is a great location on Las Ramblas and the hotel is lovely. We were able to walk to many locations nearby or easily catch a cab.

I would certainly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,09,17

27,"Attractive, convenient, quiet","Before arriving we were worried the Ramblas location might mean horrible noise until 4am, but in fact this is peaceful, refined and comfortable. The street outside is (for us) horrendously touristy, but once inside it's a different story. Reception is small, with the almost equally small restaurant just behind a screen, but from then on it gets better and better: smartly decorated rooms, decent bathroom, very effective double-glazing. There's a roof terrace on the 7th floor which was a lovely place to relax at the end of the day (or indeed the middle of the day). Don't get too excited about the ""swimming pool"" - it's a narrow trough for a brief dip rather than an actual swim, but very welcome all the same. Friendly people. superb breakfast, no complaints at all, so we would definitely recommend Bagues.",4,2015,09,14
27,One night stay during honeymoon...,"We stayed here on the last night of our honeymoon, and were blown away by the staff at check in alone.  They were kind and full of recommendations in a very open way.  We felt comfortable asking questions, and someone from the desk even walked us to our room to assure we knew how to use everything.  The rooftop pool is small, but was perfect for a dip while taking in the view. We had a small dinner at the restaurant.  The service was excellent, and the food is all fresh from the next door market.  Breakfast was also excellent too.  The double room as spacious, and the bed very comfortable.",5,2015,09,09
27,Lovely stay!,We stayed for 3 nights in a deluxe room on the fifth floor. The hotel is nice with exceptional reception staff who cannot do enough to help. Wonderful views in the heart of La Rambla. Only disappointment was that the room did not have a dressing table and there was insufficient lighting in the room to do hair/makeup! There was also little room in the bathroom for storage of products. Otherwise super hotel and excellent staff. Would certainly recommend the Bagues Hotel.,4,2015,09,08
27,Nice staff but not 5 star hotel,"Booked to stay here for 3 days whilst on a break for my girlfriends birthday. 
Greeted by friendly helpfull staff on the reception who shown us to our room wich looked nice at first glance until I realised it had no windows. We complained and was moved to another room with half a window that did not open. We complained again they told us they would have another room available for us the following day. So we stayed in the prison cell for a night then in the morning they moved us to a better room with windows and a small balcony. There was no iron in the room or not even one to borrow we had to use the laundry service which cost me about €60 all in all after 3 days. Small pool on the roof is nice however u have to phone down for a drink as they don't have anyone constantly on the bar as sometimes no guest are up there. The staff were always willing to help and always friendly which was good. Oh and the bath robes and towels are 5 star but I'd give this hotel 4 star at very best.",3,2015,09,08
27,Great location and Service,"During my visit to Barcelona I had the opportunity to stay at the HOTEL BAGUÉS.  The assisted in transported from airport and hotel and vice-versa (at a cost).  The reception at the hotel was super as is expected of an SLH hotel and Spaniards.  The food was very good.  The pool view and location--Fantastic!

Overall great stay.",4,2015,09,02

27,"Outstanding Boutique Hotel, with Great Service and Perfect location.","Small very upscale boutique hotel on the Ramblas in Barcelona.  Friendly professional staff went out of their way to assist us in every aspect of our trip (transportation, sightseeing, restaurant selection etc...).  For Europe our double superior room was larger than most.  Very comfortable bed, more than adequate closet and luggage space.  The bathroom was 5 stars with both a separate large bath and walk in shower which is unusual in Europe.  The thick heavy towels and robes are what you would expect at the Plaza in NYC.  Best of all in August was the icy cold air-conditioner.  Our room was easily 70 degrees on a day when the outside temp was 98.  What a great respite from the heat and humidity of Barcelona in the sweltering summer.  Finally, the breakfast which came with our room price was far and away the best breakfast spread I have had in Europe.  Not only did they offer the traditional European continental breakfast of fresh fruit, meats, cheeses and baked goods, but they also offered a hot breakfast.  I had both salmon blini and an omelet to top off my ""continental"" breakfast.  This breakfast in the U.S. if it was available would have cost us $50.  What a great way to start a long day of sightseeing!  When I return to Barcelona there is only one Hotel I will consider, and that of course is the Hotel Bagues!!!",5,2015,08,24

27,perfect from the second we arrived,"We arrived at about 9.30am which was too early for check-in however the staff knew that we had been travelling for 30+ hours and quickly took us downstairs so that we could shower, change clothes and freshen up.  It was a great first impression and the level of service did not drop off the whole 5 days we were there.  The location was perfect for walking the gothic and jewish areas of the city and so close to La Boquaria. Special mention to Inigo on the front desk, he was an absolute delight.  Rooms were clean and comfortable with a heavenly shower and the roof-top pool and bar area was just what was needed at the end of a hot afternoon.  Our room overlooked La Rambla however there was no road noise at all.  We would definitely return to this hotel and have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2015,08,02

27,"A lovely, contemporary hotel in a great location, with fantastic staff...","A same-day, last minute UK based booking meant a 1am arrival at this lovely centrally positioned boutique hotel. The reception was examplary even at such a late hour and the front of house team never failed to disappoint in the level of service offered throughout my stay. The rooms are beautifully appointed, well air-conditioned and offer comfortable beds, which in combination with awesome sound-proofing meant a tranquil retreat from the melee of La Rambla. The roof-top terrace with bar and 'compact' splash pool are an under-utilised (and therefore peaceful) escape from everything, so worth heading up to. You really must treat yourself!",4,2015,07,22
27,Superb boutique hotel,"The staff at this hotel are amazing, superb service - amongst the best in the world !!! Great location if you like to be in the heart of the city. My only small issue was the lack of English channels on the TV - but hey that's a minor
      ",5,2015,07,22
27,Great hotel in a great location!,"We were traveling Europe (Italy & Spain) for our 10 year anniversary and splurged on a nice hotel in Barcelona.  We sure are glad that we did! The hotel was in a great location, with a rooftop pool, excellent help at the front desk, and an overall fantastic stay.  The shower was fantastic!",5,2015,07,19
27,Excellent Barcelona stay,"Great centrally located hotel with attentive staff, comfortable rooms and great facilities. Would definitely recommend this hotel. Constable and stylish - nothing is left out. The staff and management were excellent 
      ",5,2015,07,19
27,great service and location,"the location in Las rambles is great for getting around though it would generally be noisy but the soundproofing in the rooms is incredible , the only noise was in the first room next to the lifts but it wasn't that bad only when I was trying to sleep late .service was incredible nothing was too much trouble , the rooms look great .
if i was to pick faults it would be that the roof pool loungers should have parasols , and that twice i found to difficult to log on to the internet but none of these things are enough to stop me giving Hotel Bagues five stars .",5,2015,07,15
27,It was an amazing hotel in a perfect location,"We stayed at the Bagues in the beginning of July - family of 4. The hotel's location on La Rambla is perfect. It is centrally located just steps away from the Boqueria Market and many other shops and restaurants. The Gothic quarter is 5 min walk. There are two metro lines convenient to the hotel as well. The rooms were modern and had all the amenities. The A/C worked wonderfully during the hot weather. The front desk staff was helpful and accommodating. The breakfast buffet was delicious and had many items to choose from. The restaurant staff was also very attentive. The roof top bar had great views of the city, although the pool is a ""lap pool"" and small. My only comment is that I wish all four of us could have been accommodated in one room. We needed two rooms, but they made sure they were next to each other. We have two adults and two kids (age 9 and 11). We would stay here again if/when we return to Barcelona.",5,2015,07,14
27,Outstanding boutique hotel,"I agree with the other recent reviews.  This boutique hotel is beautifully appointed.  The rooftop bar is a real treat.  But what really makes the hotel shine is the friendly staff and management.  They take a genuine interest in the guests and affirmative reach out with a friendly greeting and touristic advice.  

All in all, my wife's and my reaction was ""staying here was as much of a treat as the rest of Barcelona was!""",5,2015,07,08
27,An awesome hotel with great staff and amazing views!,"Not only was our room absolutely wonderful -overlooking La Rambla but quiet when we shut out windows, but the view from the top of the hotel is fantastic -as is the infinity pool and bar on the roof!  All of the employees were incredibly friendly and helpful and all spoke English and also encouraged my weak Spanish.  We would stay there again -the metro is steps away and it is a beautiful enclave away from the hustle and bustle -yet right in the middle of everything!",5,2015,07,07
27,Relaxing and comfortable venue in a central location,"The entire hotel was very good, but after a day of walking around Barcelona it was especially nice to go up to the roof top terrace and enjoy a quite drink.
The decor of the hotel is striking without being intrusive.

27,Lovely hotel; highly recommend,Just returned from three nights stay at this beautiful boutique hotel in the centre of Barcelona.  Cannot recommend it highly enough; the staff were lovely from the moment we arrived.  Great roof top bar.,5,2015,06,30
27,Great intimate Hotel in perfect location,"Perfect choice for a small hotel located in the middle of the Barcelona action. Everything about this hotel is first class- tasteful furnishings, thoughtful architecture and  sufficient sized rooms. However, the best part is the front desk staff. They are friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. We stayed four nights. After four nights in a hotel you know what is good, what is bad and what is just so so. Everything about this hotel is good.",5,2015,06,28
27,City Break,"Checked out this morning from Hotel Bagues. Lovely hotel with a rooftop pool and the best location in La Rambla. Starbucks to your left, market to your right and gothic area across the road. Hotel rooms are small but lovely decor and bathroom is perfect. Our room had view of la Rambla and no traffic could be heard. Free bottle of rioja on arrival and chocolates each night on turn down. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Will def stay here next time in  December!!!",5,2015,06,24
27,OLA BARCELONA,"I stayed september 2014 and we enjoyed with my family.  Very friendly staff and best location in Barcelona. Rooms little dark but hotel very clean.Breakfast very good.If you stay this hotel,you will never upset.",5,2015,06,22
27,beautiful boutique property,The front desk staff was as pleasant and accommodating as you could hope for-very friendly and professional. The property is a very good value and is maintained beautifully. The fitness room could have been better equipped even with it's small footprint. Great location. I would highly recommend this property. ,5,2015,06,18
27,Fantastic,"Fantastic stay at hotel Bagues. Location is ideal on La Rambla and central- the windows are great and literally you cannot hear how busy the street outside is.

All the staff were fantastic, could not fault the customer service at all.

The sweets in reception are a lovely touch. The roof terrace was another great feature although the pool was FREEZING! 

Breakfast was delish.",5,2015,06,09
27,Bagues Hotel Barcelona,"Excellent service, friendly and helpful staff.  Very clean and good location.  The staff provided a very thorough welcome with a staff member taking us to our room and showing us everything available in the room along with a full explanation of services available during our stay.  There was a lap pool on the roof, along with bar service. A jewellery shop on the 1st floor, and a lolly bar in reception. Breakfast was good with top service yet again.  The staff were able to assist with any enquiries regarding how to get to particular areas of interest and also suggested places to go - we were also given voucher books for the local area and tourist attractions.
Overall this would be the best service I have ever received at a Hotel.
Well done Bagues - very impressed

27,Hotel Bagues Stay,"After a 12 day Mediterranean Cruise, we stayed at this hotel for 2 nights.  The hotel is very clean, comfort and the reception staff is very helpful and polite.  This hotel is conveniently located on Los Rambla.  We would recommend this hotel for a short stay.  ",4,2015,06,08
27,4 th time and still wonderful,"This was the 4th time we have stayed at Hotel Bagues and it is still as good and surprising as the first time we went. Just on La Rambla which is a noisy busy fun street ,one steps into the charm and quiet of the hotel. The staff are brilliant,we arrived at about 11:30 am which is far too early but no trouble! They kept our luggage and we booked in had a quick cup of coffee and felt as if we had returned to an old friend.the room was fun with everything one could possibly want and over looking La Rambla which one could not hear at all. We didn't eat in as we had been invited elsewhere but the breakfast of fresh fruit , croissant and every type of hot dishe imaginable was a perfect way to start the day. Thank you again Bagues lovely stay!",5,2015,06,04
27,Helpful staff!,OMG the staff were helpful!  Location is right on La Rambla and just doors down from La Boqueria and a cash machine.  Our interior room was quiet and immaculate but lighting was too  dim.  I would preview the rooms with this in mind.,5,2015,06,03
27,Just Ok,"Loved the location of this hotel and staff excellent but our room that looked over the main street was so small we could not even have enough space to empty our suitcases and we had to walk sides ways the whole time we was in the room did ask if we could upgrade they said they would let us know still waiting  the roof top terrace was excellent with lovely views
Would stay there again but would make sure that we looked closely at room sizes",3,2015,06,02
27,Great Hotel.,"Great Hotel on las rambles. Close to the market. Wonderful staff and a great restaurant. Rooftop area has a great view of the city skyline. The perfect place to relax after a day of site seeing. Would recommend highly

27,Great property and location,"Booked this hotel for two nights in Barcelona and it was absolutely perfect. From the moment you walk in you're welcomed by friendly staff. The property is in the middle of las rambles, perfectly located in the center where you can walk a different way each day. The rooms are a good size, extremely clean and with great views. I highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2015,05,30
27,Great Stay,"Excellent staff. Service great! Room was very nice. Breakfast was very good. The overall appearance and experience of hotel was great! Located very central in terms of Las Ramblas as well as port! Even though hotel situated on Las Ramblas Ave, soundproof balcony doors provides for restfull sleep! Defnitely worth the stay and hopefully will be returning!
      ",5,2015,05,28
27,What an amazing Honeymoon,"I just wanted to say a huge thank you to the hotel Bagues and its amazing staff for making our Honeymoon the most memorable experience. From the moment we arrived nothing was a problem to the staff. We arrived at 11 am at the hotel and we asked if we could check in.... the room we were allocated was not ready so they just gave us a room that was ready..... We went out to explore and when we arrived back we had a bottle of red wine and choc waiting for us..... We don't drink red wine so i dropped it back off at the reception and they asked why i was giving it back...... 20 minutes later we had a knock on the door and as it was our honeymoon they had brought a bottle of Cava in a bucket of ice ""with compliments""of the hotel..... How amazing!!!. The breakfast is a very high quality.... a full fruit salad a selection of meats and even smoked salmon. I had scrambled eggs and they were lovely each morning the orange juice is freshly squeezed in the kitchen and i even saw Cava for breakfast. Over the three nights we were there we asked for recommendations on where to eat the first night Palo Santo, I'm sure the person at reception must have said something to the restaurant because as soon as we mentioned our hotel reservation we were treated like royalty we had cava on the house and they found us the best seat in the courtyard with a romantic singer on his guitar (it was like something from a hollywood film). The second night he recommended Patagonia Beef and Wine....... THIS IS OF THE SCALE! I can still taste the amazing flavors just thinking about it. I later found out the hotel only recommend places with a internet rating of 4/5 stars. On our last day we mentioned that we are getting picked up at 6.30pm the receptionist could only apologize that we could not keep our room till then but said we could keep it till 2pm free of charge which was great for us as it meant we could freshen up in our room till them. ...... I cannot think of anything negative about this place and I even thanked the general manager on our leaving that her and her team made our Honeymoon perfect.We are definitely thinking of coming back to Barcelona!",5,2015,05,28
27,Wonderful hotel,"This hotel completely surpassed our expectations. We were a large group, with 7 rooms, and they were beyond accommodating. The hotel was able to provide most of our rooms for early check in as soon as they became available, they were extremely helpful and hospitable. The front staff was professional and helpful, and the rooms were perfectly clean, spacious, and everything you would expect for a 5 star hotel. It is right on la ramblas and walking distance to el barrio gotico and a few feet away from the boqueria. Great hotel, I would highly recommend this! ",5,2015,05,27
27,Perfection,"Excellent location.   Excellent staff.  Every recommendation was high quality from Flamenco Dancing, food & wine tour, nightclubs & rental car service which included arrangements made by staff for each event.  Hotel Bagués tops my lost of best hotels.",5,2015,05,27
27,La Bagues...a little gem,"We have just returned from 4 fabulous days in Barcelona. 

We chose the hotel La Bagues after reading reviews on tripadvisor. The reviews were right. The hotel is beautiful and exceptionally clean and well maintained. The rooms are very  modern and have all the markings of a luxury hotel. 

The staff could not do enough for us and were friendly and helpful with arranging and recommending places to visit

We would definately go again and can highly recommend this hotel

Well done to the staff",5,2015,05,27

27,Great small hotel,"Well located on Les Rambles, good rooms and friendly staff. Fast wifi but the real bonus is one of the best restaurants in Barcelona in the lobby. A fabulous hotel for a few days visit to this beautiful city. The design makes the rooms very quiet so being in the middle of the night life is no disadvantage.",5,2015,05,23

27,Brilliant small hotel,"Lived up to the advertising, lovely hotel perfectly placed in this poular and busy district. The sound proofing was perfect in keeping out the noise of the street. Once closed the doors blocked all sound and the air conditioning unit was the quietest ever. Staff wonderful and helpful and the breakfasts are to be recommended. We will defiantly stay again.

27,What an experience! Great hotel. Great staff.,"I planned a surprise holiday for my girlfriends 30th birthday. I wanted a five star hotel on a toplocation and found hotel Bagués at La Rambla. I had some special requests in order to make my girlfriends birthday unforgetable. (Roses on the bed etc).  The communication with the hotel was fast and reliable. We also made a reservation in restaurant El Regulador which is situated in the hotel. The food was absolutely very very good. The staff is helpfull and very friendly. On the first floor is the museum and is worth a visit. Our room was so beautifull you can take a 1000 pictures. The room and the bathroom were very clean. The safe was big enough. I read in earlier posts that some people find the rooms too dark. Well, our room wasn't bright lighted butt surely enough to see normal. It's part of the atmosphere and brings you in the mood for a pleasant stay. The hotel is definitely worth its 5 stars. They even opened up our bed before going to sleep. We will come back to this hotel. No doubt about that!",5,2015,04,27
27,Excellent Hotel Bagues,"A fantastic hotel in a prime location on Las Ramblas. Very personal service as there were only 23 rooms.  All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and could not do enough for us.

Would certainly stay here again.  ",5,2015,04,27
27,Best Boutique style 5 Star on Ralambla,"For quality of Hotel, location, food, and most impressively - a wonderful helpful staff, I cannot imagine that there is a better place to stay in Barcelona in this category of a hotel.  For the best value get the room including breakfast package.",5,2015,04,22
27,Nice and Clean,"Very nice rooms and friendly staff. Love the candy they share at the reception area. 
Stayed 3 nights and rooms are clean and modern but small. 
Good location by the busy street with shopping and lots of people, no problem with sleep at night but abit of ""citylife"" noise you have to accept. 
Got my shirt ironed quick and service was just perfect, fast and polite.
I have nothing to complain about and think It realy suits for a couple of days.",4,2015,04,20
27,A perfect place to enjoy your vacation!!! ,"We stayed in the hotel for 5 nights with the family. We took 3 rooms. My mother asked to change her room ( even though in my opinion the room was good) and the staff respond very quick to her demand in a very nice way. After a short time we received strawberry with bottles of water and it was so kind. Every time we leave the room we come back to find it clean and organized. The best thing about this hotel is its location! In the heart of la ramblas . If you just stand in the balcony you will enjoy your time. You can find everything around the hotel : shops , restaurants , supermarkets , coffeeshops . In addition to that the staff of the hotel make your accommodation so comfortable by their warm welcomes and their help. They are so kind and lovely. ",5,2015,04,12
27,"Great location, modern/luxurious rooms, and friendly staff","We stayed four nights at the hotel. Location is great, so was the friendliness of the staff. The rooms are stylish and of high quality. The design however is a bit ""masculin"", i.e. dark and modern. The standard room is fairly small, rooms of higher category are bigger and some even offer a small balcony. Great rooftop terrasse with nice view.",4,2015,04,07
27,Amazing boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"Situated on Las Rambles in  the heart of the vibrant city of Barcelona.  This hotel is 5 star beautiful decor and service impeccable.The restaurant is also amazing for a hotel restaurant, and keeps with the boutique atmosphere. Rooms are small but elegant. Stayed first time for 3 nights our second visit 4 nights.",5,2015,03,18
27,Fabulous location but not 5 star due to lack of basics,"This hotel is fabulously located in a wonderfully vibrant city.  Sound proofing is a must for such a location and to be fair we were never disturbed by noise outside in what is an extremely busy area.  Although the rooms are on the small side they are very comfortable and decorated in a very contemporary style.  However, our stay did feel a little like mum and dad had gone on their own vacation and left the kids in charge.  The staff were friendly and helpful, but made minor errors along the way.  The lack of fresh bottled water daily and also tea and coffee facilities renders this less than a five star as far as I am concerned.  Such basics shouldn't be considered a luxury.

Also being woken up at 7.30 with breakfast which we hadn't ordered wasn't the greatest start to the day.  However everyone makes errors!",4,2015,03,17
27,Definitely 5 star ,"We stayed for 2 nights 13th - 15th March... Great location, friendly knowledgeable staff, relaxed atmosphere. Nice breakfast. Value for money is anything truly.. For the location and relaxing atmosphere as a treat.. Yes it is well worth the expense...     ",4,2015,03,16
27,Nice design but lacks the basics,"Stayed here in February on a one night flying visit for a friend's birthday. 
Service could not be better. Simply amazing welcome. We arrived early so our room was not ready but reception staff took our luggage and gave us some great recommendations in where to go.
We headed back about 4 and we're shown straight to our room. I'd booked a deluxe double. The room looked nice, not by any means large but beautiful to look at with a dual aspect view of The Ramblas and a side street. Windows blocked out any noise. 
My main issue with the hotel is a total lack of amenities......we asked for an iron, only to be told the hotel only have a laundry service, which was closed! Eventually an English travel iron was brought up which didn't work. We gave up and wore slightly creased clothes. Similarly, our tiny hair dryer was damaged and could only be plugged in to a loose socket by the only mirror, which was in the bathroom. 
If the hotel equip the rooms to would be a little gem, as the service is exceptional.",3,2015,03,16
27,Great hotel - be sure to check out the roof!,"The staff went above and beyond to make our trip comfortable. Free bottled waters, weather forecasts during turn-down service, and thick sound-proofed windows and walls to eliminate street noise.  Check out the roof for an awesome pool and bar during the summer months.",5,2015,03,08
27,Nice Hotel in a good location ,"The Hotel is directly at la Rambla, so a good place to explore the city. Service was very friendly and a great breakfast. The room was a little dark but well equiped. I would recommend a room with an outside window rather to the inside. I like the sweets served at reception.",4,2015,03,04
27,"Excellent from start to finish. Excellent hotel, great location 10/10","We've just returned from an excellent first trip to this hotel and Barcelona. Travelled with friends. Both had great rooms and similar feelings when we left. The rooms are spotless and finished to a really high standard, as is the hotel generally. The staff simply couldn't do enough to help and suggested places to go, restaurants, top things to see etc. Breakfast was really nice we had it each day. A nice place to drink in the evening too. A really top class place. If I was being picky the only thing that grated a little was when we popped back for late drinks (after 10pm) and wanted to sit at a table for 4 and were asked to sit at the bar. I understand the hotel wants to use these tables for food but it was gone 10pm and we were residents? I'm not sure the guy realised we were though? Would definitely go back.",5,2015,03,03
27,Amazing in all regards!,"The location is perfect, walk out the front door and you are on La Rambla.  If you are a walker, you can walk to all attractions.  Turn right out of the hotel, you with in a half a block you are at the famous farmers market with a Dunkin Donut right next door.  Keep walking down La Rambla and you will pass the Opera House, the Christopher Columbus Statue, and run into the water front. One day we packed a picnic, cheese, salami, bread, fruits from the market, etc and took the tram down at the water front up the mountain and had a wonderful time!  Great views. Turn left out of the hotel, and within a half a block you have a Starbucks.  Do not eat on La Rambla, over priced and much better options down side streets.  Loved the Gotic, or Old Town, area.  Be sure to visit the Museum of History with the old under ground Roman city they have found.  Some of our favorite places to eat, Bar Lobo, great for breakfast and dinner, within a block of the hotel.  Also, Club de l'empanada for the best empanada's we have ever had.  They also have tapas, operated by a dad and his daughter, worth a visit.  We were able to walk to all of Gaudi's buildings from the hotel, including the Sagrada Familia.  Buy tickets first at the hotel front desk to avoid the long ticket lines.  If football is in town, spend the extra money and go to a game, a great experience.  The Metro is a half block down on your right and you enter from the middle section of La Rambla.  Very easy to find and to get around on.  We took a trial run earlier that day, bought our tickets at the stadiums ticket window, and then went back that night.  The metro does get crazy crowded after the game. Now back to the hotel - First, the staff is incredible!!  Friendly and helpful from the moment we walked in.  Always made us feel at home. Mercedes is the front desk manager and she and her team will go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need.  Truly amazing! The rooms are very clean and comfortable.  We requested a bathtub and their was no problem getting one.  The bathrobes and slippers are very handy and their personal products are top quality.  They have turn down service every night with a lovely chocolate left on your pillow.  They have a candy bar in the lobby, for free, in case you have a sweet tooth.  A Taxi from the airport will cost you 35 Euros including tip one way.  If you leave during peak traffic they add in an extra surcharge with added about 7 Euros to our bill the last day.  I hope you enjoy this hotel as much as we did.  It is definitely one of our top 3 in all of our travels!  Enjoy!",5,2015,02,27
27,best hotel,"This hotel is on La Rambla which is in the heart of Barcelona but it has fantastic sound proofing so you don't hear the street noise, our room was joined to the lift but again you could not hear the lift at all, check in was very quick and the staff can not do enough for you, our room was ready on arrival even though we were early. we had an amazing room and I don't understand other comments that the rooms are small, they are just perfect. 
It was my birthday while we were there which the staff recognised with a note and fresh strawberries, we also had a complimentary bottle of wine ( our friends in the next room to us unfortunately did not get the wine, so not sure if this was also for my birthday).      
The room was spotlessly clean and we were not disturbed in the mornings by the chamber maid.
 There are no tea and coffee making facilities in the room, but you can order complimentary tea and coffee in the morning using the door tag. We didn't realise this until the last day of our stay.
As we were staying for 3 nights we were given a breakfast deal of 15 euros per day, the breakfast consisted of cereal, pastries, cold meat and cheese, fruit and yogurts, full english, tea , coffee, fruit juice and Cava. the waiter at breakfast (sorry can't remember his name)  was soo attentive and remembered what you like, he is a credit to this hotel, but then I will say all the staff are.
I highly recommend this hotel and we will be going back to Barcelona and this hotel.",5,2015,02,26
27,mid week break,"Everything was great. Cannot fault the staff and service we were given. Preparation for our stay was assisted by the hotel via email too. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting a luxurious trip away.
              
              ",5,2015,02,22
27,One night stay,"Only stayed here for 1 night so my review will be brief. 

I will start by saying that the staff are brilliant, couldn't be more helpful. Couldn't fault them at all. 
We stayed in a superior room, as it was supposed to be bigger than the standard rooms, it may have been bigger but it wasn't large. 
There was a hair dryer in the room but it was quite damaged, the end nozzle couldn't stay on due to the damage. There are no mirrors in the room, other than the 1 in the bathroom, so you have to use the hairdryer there. That wouldn't be too much of an issue expect that the socket was coming away from the wall and therefore the hairdryer kept cutting out-probably not too safe either!  Having 1 mirror is a bit of a pain when 2 people are trying to get ready.  I would say that you don't expect this in a 5 star hotel, the last one I stayed in had GHD hairdryer and straighteners!
There was no iron in the room and when we requested one we were told on this occasion we could have one as their laundry service was not operating. So beware, they will not normally give you an iron, again not something that is standard in 5 star hotels. When the iron came it was a British travel iron that didn't actually work. Very poor. 
We did get a small complimentary bottle of red wine that came with chocolate truffles. The wine and truffles were lovely. 
We didn't have breakfast at the hotel but we did have a drink. The wine was really reasonably priced. 
We had a great stay in Barcelona but the hotel was just ok, as I said not 5 star. 
In my opinion there are better hotels in Barcelona. I won't return to this one. ",2,2015,02,19
27,Stayed here for our WEDDING,"I got married in Barcelona on 12-13-14 and stayed at Hotel Bagues during our trip.  Anyone who is looking for a hotel, please, please, PLEASE go here.  

Hands down the BEST service we were provided the ENTIRE time we traveled Europe.  I mean, these people bent over backwards and then tried to top it all by doing splits.  Perhaps it was because we were a bride and groom, but they sincerely went above and beyond.  So much, that the night before our wedding, they had strawberries, a bottle of champagne and a ""congratulations"" card waiting for me in the suite.  They were always helpful with finding places, giving suggestions, and the doorman even went so far as to walk me (literally WALKED WITH ME) to some store to help me find what I was looking for.  The staff was courteous and always there to lend a helping hand and/or ear.

The rooms (albeit a tad small, but we knew that going into it) were beautiful!  Super clean and modern.  Exactly what we wanted.  We had this really cool balcony that overlooked La Ramblas, and by night time, just glittered with all of the Christmas decorations.  The location is perfect.

If anyone from the hotel ends up reading this message, I want to thank ALL of you, from the bottom of my heart, for helping make our Barcelona and WEDDING experience a fantastic one!!!  We anticipate coming back to your beautiful city in 2025...and we DEFINITELY plan on staying at Hotel Bagues again.",5,2015,02,11
27,Truly outstanding.,"My partner and I visited for a weekend break at the beginning of February.  And were absolutely delighted with every aspect of our stay.

From the welcome at check in, to the explanations offered as to local attractions, to the personal escort to the room and explanation of its features, to the quality of the soundproofing (the room overlooked La Rambla and was on the third floor but there was NO street noise), to the choice and variety at breakfast, to the excellence of the hotel restaurant (separate review to follow), to the convenience of the location, to the views from the rooftop terrace, to the efficiency and courtesy extended at checkout - the staff and facilities offered EVERYTHING you could want from a hotel.

We were absolutely delighted with our stay and would have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending it very highly indeed to other travellers.  It truly is an outstanding hotel.

Thank you to the staff and management for making our stay so memorable.",5,2015,02,11
27,Great location,"Hotel bagues is perfectly located on La Rambla a few steps from the market.
Our room was on the fourth floor it was funky but compact. Plenty of toiletries towels and robes were provided. All the staff seemed to speak at least two languages and were very helpful.
The wifi was annoying as you had to keep logging in.",4,2015,02,07
27,Well located,"Located in the middle of Las Rambla. Excellent hotel. Located near good restaurants and shops. Hotel had a glass door to the bathroom which I was aware of before hand. As my stay was only 3 days I didn't mind, but it would definitely be an issue for a stay of any length. I didn't feel comfortable using the toilet in partial view of my partner. Not romantic at all!",4,2015,02,05
27,Barcelona short break,"We’ve just arrived home after a short visit to Barcelona and the Hotel Bagues was a fantastic base.
From the moment we arrived the staff were fantastic and could not have done more to help make our stay more pleasurable. 
The welcoming bottle of wine in the room was a great delight on arrival!
From the hotels great location on the Rambla, Barcelona is on the doorstep! 
I would recommend a stay at this lovely hotel.
",5,2015,02,03
27,Beautiful little jewel box,"LOVE the room design. Small but high end and innovative. The reception staff was amazingly helpful, providing tips and guidance both unsolicited and asked for. The room was very quiet even though it's on the main ""strip"".

27,Perfect Boutique Hotel,"From check in to check out, my experience at Hotel Bagues was wonderful.  The staff was extremely helpful, the room was clean, comfortable and very quiet (despite overlooking La Rambla), shower was outstanding and the location couldn't have been more perfect.  The hotel is within walking distance of two metro stops, restaurants, shops and attractions.  I took the Aerobus from the airport to Placa Catalunya, which was a five minute walk to the hotel.  All in all a perfect trip, would go back in a minute!",5,2015,01,27
27,Amazing boutique experience in every respect,"When you encounter excellence it's important to shout it from the rooftops. 

For anyone reading this we would want to let you know that everyone at Hotel Bagues really made our weekend stay in Barcelona something really special.

From the moment we arrived everyone at the hotel was amazing and of all the hotels we have ever stayed at the customer service was incredible! The staff even upgraded our room and we had an outdoor spa! 

The attention to detail both in terms of service and the design of the hotel was breath taking. It is a unique boutique experience. The stairwell has to be seen to be believed!

The different textures and materials used throughout the hotel and in our room were breathtakingly beautiful.

In terms of location I can't imagine a better one in this vibrant city. We had an amazing outdoor area which looked down on La Ramblas which was beautiful in the morning and exciting at night. 

Thank you to everyone at this beautiful hotel so much. We can't wait to come back again!",5,2015,01,21
27,"Excellent Hotel, Great Location, Amazing Staff!","We stayed in this hotel in January 2015, on arrival we turned up at around 11am and knew we couldn't check in until 2pm, however the staff at the hotel got a room for us within 5 minutes. Our room was on the second floor overlooking La Ramblas with a balcony, the shower was incredible and the bed comfortable, we could not fault this at all. The hotel is within 200m of the metro which can take you easily to the famous Cathedral and there is always lots happening on La Ramblas with the port at the end of the road. Breakfast in the morning was very high quality and quick service, hot food cooked to order and the restaurant was always very calm and quiet. The hotel also offer 20% discount for evening or lunch time meals. The waiting staff could not do enough for you. There is a rooftop terrace with a bar and pool that you can sit at, they will even bring drinks up to you if you so wish. All the hotel staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, telling us recommended restaurants and massively helped us by lending us cash when the cash points were out of order! When we checked out and went to the airport we realised we had left an ipad in the room, we quickly contacted the hotel and they arranged a courier the next day for it. The staff go above and beyond any other 5* hotel we have stayed in and the hotel itself is perfectly positioned, tranquil and amazing value. This made our stay in Barcelona lovely and we would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2015,01,20

The room was a little small..
The hotel is clean and comfortable
The breakfast was good and there is a small pool on the roof and the view is wonderfull! Nice place ",4,2015,01,10
27,In the heart of Barcelona,"The hotel is situated at La Rambla, which is one of the main streets of Barcelona, the very center of the city. So the location is very convenient. The room was rather small, it was hard for two people to pass each other between the tv and the bed. But otherwise it's a really nice hotel: very clean, beautifully decorated and having the most friendly and helpful staff. Also, the hotel has only about 30 rooms so you get a lot of attention from the staff which is very nice. We got a room with a street view (to La Rambla) but the windows are well sealed and the noise from the street didn't disturb us at all. We liked the street view very much. Our room had a tiny balcony - very cute:) La Rambla was very busy around New Year's. Also, the room had a big TV and the wifi worked well.
We didn't have a chance to try their restaurant so I can't say anything about the food. But overall it was a comfortable stay for me and my husband. We spent there 3 nights Dec/Jan 2015.",4,2015,01,06
27,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed here for three nights in between Christmas and New Year and it was excellent. Our room on the second floor overlooked La Rambla and it was spacious, comfortable and spotlessly clean. It also had a balcony .The hotel staff are extremely friendly and professional. They made our stay more enjoyable, taking time to point out the sights of Barcelona as we checked in and then showing us around our room. The hotel is beautifully run. The rooms have robes and slippers and lots of lovely touches. Being on La Rambla, there are lots of cafes, bars and restaurants within easy walking distance as well as being close to shops and stores. There is also a metro station near by.",5,2015,01,04
27,"A luxurious, comfortable hotel in an excellent location","This was a very reasonable priced 5 star luxury hotel, with an intimate atmosphere in a superbly central location on La Rambla. The welcome from the staff was very friendly. The room was very comfortable and well appointed.

27,Central location and glamorous,"Even though it's situated right on Las Ramblas, this hotel provides tranquil luxury in the heart of Barcelona. The rooms are compact but beautifully finished and very comfortable. We didn't opt for breakfast as there are lots of great cafes nearby. ",4,2014,12,30
27,special place to stay,"The hotel was in a perfect location, right in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of la rambla, without noise being a problem in the room. It is an exquisitely beautiful hotel where attention has been paid to every detail.  The staff are friendly and helpful and nothing is too much trouble, they really made our stay special. The rooms are fairly small but don't feel cramped, they have been designed in a clever way. We would thoroughly recommend this to others - the only downside was having a shower only rather than a bath, but it was an amazing shower so it didn't really matter too much!!",5,2014,12,29
27,Wonderful hotel!,"We've stayed at the hotel from 12/19-12/23 in room no. 501. The hotel is one of the best hotels we ever visited in europe, beautiful hotel, excellent room, wonderful staff, amazing service and great location. Highly recommended!",5,2014,12,24
27,Beautifully appointed boutique hotel,"Great and convenient location (just a minute or two from the Metro, and RIGHT next to La Boqueria!).
Very friendly and helpful staff.
Lovely decor (nice finishing touch of having sweets by the front door).
Rooms are well appointed, large and comfy bed, mini bar, robes and slippers, toiletries.
Mini bar and hair dryers but no tea/coffee facilities.
Stunning views from the rooftop area.
Free wifi in-room.",5,2014,12,23
27,Amazing Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for a romantic weekend the location is perfect infact everything about this hotel is perfect. Checkin was easy and very informative this was a first visit to Barcelona so the receptionist got a map and crossed off all the must dos which was great. The rooms are ok in size this is a boutique hotel remember they are stylishly decorated bed comfortable bathroom good size and a small balcony right overlooking La Rambla which was amazing.

All of the staff were fantastic very attentive and welcoming the restaurant was lovely and everywhere was kept immaculate. Nice touch the sweets in reception and umbrellas for guests to use on a very wet weekend.

This is a fab hotel cannot praise the staff enough made it one special weekend.",5,2014,12,11
27,wonderful experience will return,"me and my husband had a great time
it was a very comfortable break in wonderful surroundings and the staff were magnificent. I have travelled a lot and this hotel has nothing to envy others in London or Rome or New York even.  Best hotel by far we have stayed in a capital

27,Great hotel in the middle of the action,"Very modern hotel right on La Rambla.  Rooms were a bit small but very comfortable and quiet - we were right over the street, but couldn't hear a sound when the window was closed.

27,An essence of Barcelona.,"Barcelona is exotic and vibrant. It's also relaxed and intriguing. Like the 2 facades of the Sagrada Familia the city seems itself to have 2 faces, the light of creation in the sunshine of the beach and the sea. Then the nocturnal darkness of the night with its food, romance and vivaciousness.

This hotel seems to capture it in one. In one sense the dark, sultry rooms are romantic and evoke 'the night', the sensory. Then the roof terrace and the restaurant are inviting, fresh and creative. Add to that the perfect location sitting on La Ramblas next to the richness of La Boqueria and the light space of Placa Catalunya and you get Barcelona personified in a hotel experience.

A wonderful hotel. Perfectly situated for all the delights that this magnificent city offers.",5,2014,12,03
27,very good hotel,"excelent location. right on the ramblas. all the restaurants and walkway are right on the sidewalk
you can walk most of barcelonas main points from the hotel
you save a lot on taxis
rooms are a bit small. try to get a jr suite
do not pay for the breakfast. too expensive
staff is extraordinary. they made the difference",4,2014,11,24
27,Excellent hotel,"This hotel is situated right in the middle of Las Rambla, with easy access to everything. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the room was clean and tidy. I would have wished for a bit better space in the room, but all in all this is good value for money! The bed was really comfortable. ",5,2014,11,14
27,Claustrophobic,"I was very disappointed by my stay at the Bagues, especially considering I was coming right from another Derby Hotel which I loved (the Urban in Madrid). The rooms are nice, but on the small side, even for Europe. Bathrooms offered a bit more familiarity with my friends than I would've liked -- the door is clear glass. Although there is frosting to cover one's torso in the shower stall and toilet stall, it's still very awkward to clearly watch someone drop their pants to take a crap.

Worse than that was the fact our room did not have a window to the outside -- our lone window faced into the stairwell. So our room was very dark and depressing, and the lack of *any* natural light made waking up very difficult. It was really miserable to spend more than a few minutes in the room.

On the bright side, the location is excellent, right on Las Ramblas. (Though having been to Barcelona twice I will likely stay in Eixample next time.) Perfect for exploring the Boqueria, El Raval, El Born and the Gothic Quarter. Just dodge the pickpockets during the day and aggressive street hookers at night and you'll be fine. There is a nice rooftop patio as well, although it's quite small and can get crowded.",2,2014,11,12
27,Definitely not...,"Why give two stars?
Because of the staff that remained nice and listening... despite not providing groundbreaking solutions.

Overall disappointing experience...

Location is good (for tourists who look for a central place surrounded by touristic restaurants and shops that have next to nothing of tradition), but... horribly noisy. No need to be a light sleeper to feel it, it is definitely very, very, very noisy... Staff acknowledged but could basically not do lot...

Decoration is a matter of taste, let's not overreact over it but just to give you an idea, it is a kind of mock-trendy decoration with poor to cheap tastes (bizarrely for a SLH)... obviously it does not give the place a great style.

Rooms (apart from decoration and noise...) are OK but really not very cosy, comfortable, bed is average to say the best, bathroom poorly conceived.

Breakfast is in the lobby (again a kind of weird and poor choice of location, that makes the room unwelcoming). Food has nothing special...

Going to Barcelona from times to times, this option is a definite no go again.",2,2014,11,12

The location is the hotel is fantastic right on Las Ramblas. Although it might get a bit noisy at night.,5,2014,11,07
27,Small five stars,"It is in Rambla street , ""If you are not in Rambla , you are not in Barcelona "", hotel is in excellent location , in Rambla , few minutes walk to Catalonia aquare, rooms are small , lights are dim , double bed is very small , around 250 cm , but is very clean , well furnished , breakfast is more than excellent  delivered to your room ,as no much space down stairs , this will add a problem if you want to have lunch or dinner in the hotel , but a lot of resturants around , staff are very helpful , smiling and very polite",4,2014,11,07
27,small but beautiful hotel,"The hotel has ultra modern interiors but the exterior facade reflects classical lines, reminiscent of the early 1900.
The rooms has exquisite taste, not so big but good enough for typical travelers. The room is well equipped with amenities although it lacks a dressing table.
It is located in the heart of Barcelona, Las ramblas with so many restaurants and shops.
Finally, I like the free candy at the lobby.
The staff are warm and friendly and they all speak good English.",4,2014,11,05
27,Barcelona Bagues Beauty,"A very smart hotel, small but perfectly formed with a good range of 5 star facilities on offer. Staff were courteous and very helpful and our room was comfortably classy. The location was perfect with easy access to all the sights. Our fourth floor balcony overlooked both a beautiful church and Las Ramblas and people watching was a pleasant perk to be had. Though it was central and in a very busy location our room was very quiet, ensuring a great nights sleep. Would recommend and will hopefully return one day!",5,2014,11,02
27,"Lovely, but needs slight improvement","This is a very pretty, centrally located hotel with a stunning rooftop terrace. The prices are fair given the level of luxury offered and the very accommodating, multilingual and kind staff. It was great to receive detailed information about security in the city as Barcelona is notorious for its pickpockets. However, the rooms, though chic and extraordinarily well soundproofed are tiny, with no desk or table, and  have rather dim lighting in the bathroom. The staff are very attentive to the client's comfort but were not as knowledgeable about the city as I would have liked. Also, while I didn't mind the size of the very tiny pool (it is, after all in a hotel the very centre of the historic part of the city and has a stunning view of the cathedral) it really should have been heated. Perhaps the hotel devotes more attention to aesthetics and comfort (a chocolate truffle brought nightly to the room) rather than the basics for visitors--a more extensive list of restaurants and greater knowledge of the cultural activities--hours of museums, general orientation of the city, etc. That being said, I would definitely stay in this hotel again.",4,2014,10,27
27,"A beautiful hotel, great location but no window in room!","We booked this hotel at the last minute, its location on Las ramblas we could not fault.  The hotel staff were very helpful and the whole feel of the place was very luxurious.  If I have one criticism it was for lack of daylight in the room.  The room had a window but this faced onto the stairwell and hence people could see directly into your room.  We had no option other than to draw the curtain at all times.",4,2014,10,20
27,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"We booked a suite at this hotel which comes with a small roof terrace and hot tub.  I would say that the hot tub is a bit overlooked from the roof top bar when it is open.  There is an awning but unless next door have theirs down too then it feels quite overlooked.  The suites are beautiful but they are pretty tight on space.  We had two large cases plus two smaller ones with us as we were embarking on a cruise the next day, There was not a lot of space for our luggage.  The staff were very friendly and the hotel is beautifully decorated, we enjoyed having a look at the antique jewellery collection located on the first floor.  ",4,2014,10,17
27,Top hotel,"Bagues is an expensive but also high class hotel perfect located at La Rambla. I became a bit hesitant when I red a rather negative review about the hotel from someone to whom the traffic noise from La Rambla was disturbing and even the sound of the church bells was too much. Well, I had a room facing La Rambla and yes, I could hear a soft distant hum when really listening but in no way disturbing. I could also hear the church bells once every hour but did not even notice that. If one likes to have a more silent hotel one have to go to countryside.
The hotel is rather new (3 years old) and very special. Materials used are stones and woods and the dominant color is black. Really sexy combination. The room is quite small, but furnished in a way (with mirrors and recesses) that it appears to be bigger than it really is. The bathroom is top of the line with your own Jacuzzi. Also the color of the bathroom is black. On the roof of the hotel is a terrace with probably the smallest swimming pool I have seen. You have a nice view over the roofs of Barcelona from that terrace
What more to say. Breakfast is of high class and service very friendly as it is also in the lobby. If you can afford it, this is a good choice",5,2014,10,16

27,Superior Five Star Barcelona Boutique Hotel,"My husband and I spent fine nights at Hotel Bagues located on the Rambles. The friendly reception and attentiveness from the staff was exceptional. Our compact room was very comfortable, sleekly decorated, spotless, and quiet, even though our balcony overlooked the colorful and busy Ramblas. The location was perfect because we were minutes away from the historic Gothic area, museums, the harbor, excellent Tapas Bars and restaurants, and the metro. Hotel Bagues is a unique hotel experience, and we highly recommend. ",5,2014,09,17

Fantastic night out.",4,2014,09,03
27,Rumbe on La Rambla,"Reading some of the other reviews, I cannot help but feel that we were staying at another hotel! ""Peaceful""...""did not disturb""....these people must have hearing problems. Because quite frankly this is the nosiest hotel we have ever stayed at. Firstly though, I cannot fault the staff, the quality of the hotel itself, apart from the 'tight ""room size, I'm sure it wasn't a king-size bed either(maybe they have very small kings in Spain).The decoration is spot on, the amenities are great for a small hotel. If you could pick it up and relocate this hotel, it would be highly recommendable. If  you like the noise and bustle of ten- thousand people talking, shouting, laughing (in Spanish of course)past your bedroom window at 3am in the morning. Then great, it's the place for you( we stayed over a weekend). If you like the rumble of the tube-train, located below the hotel, grinding along every 30mins or so , perfect. But ""peaceful"" certainly isn't a word that I would use to describe Hotel Bagues. It has charm, it has quality staff. If you are looking for a noisy, pulsating location, then it fits your requirements perfectly. If you like to sleep at night in peace, then, a huge NO. We were going to stay for another night, but kept it to two nights so that we could find peace and quiet at our next location. Oh and right next door is a church, so I hope you like bells!",3,2014,09,02
27,Perfection...,"Overlooking la Rambles this hotel is ideally situated. The staff are wonderfully helpful and very friendly, however what really sets this hotel apart from the others is it's amenities. It boast a wonderful roof top bar and pool area which we made full use of and it has an amazing gym. The bedrooms were beautiful and our daughter especially enjoyed the luxury of staying at such an exquisite hotel.

We will definitely be re visiting this hotel and highly recommend it to anyone looking for luxury situated in the heart of Barcelona",5,2014,08,29
27,Low key luxury,"We enjoyed a very pleasant and pieceful 5 night stay at this boutique hotel right in the city centre.
Very helpful and knowledgable staff. Nice little rooftop sundeck with a bar, a tiny pool and lovely views.
Just medium size room, with excellent noise isolation, great beds and bedlinen and a good size and beautiful bathroom w shower. 
Perfect hotel to relax and enjoy! 
Walking distance to all central areas of Barcelona.",5,2014,08,26
27,Two night stay - Superb,"the hotel is stunning, the staff are really friendly, the rooms are really comfy and very classy looking, one thing about the rooms also is that when the balcony doors are closed over looking La Rambla and curtains closed you could be mistaken for not being on a the busiest street of Barcelona with the sun bright in the sky, its so dark and quiet, and as soon as you open the doors the noise comes flooding in, i can't say enough good things about this hotel, the roof terrace is brilliant and has excellent views of the city, highly recommend staying here 100%",5,2014,08,20
27,Great location but suites are not value for money,"We stayed at this hotel from 15th to 18th August and had booked a suite as the trip was for a birthday celebration. We arrived early at the hotel and only had to wait 5 minutes before our room was ready which was great!

When we were taken to our room it was a bit disappointing having looked at it on the website we were expecting more of a wow factor. The room was tiny, no way worthy of being called a suite it was just a double room with a very small terrace, we only had a small jacuzzi and no sunbathing area as shown on the hotels website. The guy showing us the room advised he had put the canopy down to keep the sun off the room but recommended we keep this down as anyone at the roof top bar could just look over on to our terrace. This room is not worth the price for upgrading so don't waste your money!

We never ate in the hotel as there are so many great places in the city to try.

The staff at the hotel were all very helpful and nice and nothing was too much trouble.

Would we stay here again? The answer is probably not as you are just paying for the location and there are probably much better hotels off La Rambla that would be better value for money.",4,2014,08,19
27,GREAT HOTEL AND AMAZINGLY FRIENDLY SERVICE.,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel, great location, very friendly service, clean room and even though there was a constant traffic of people right downstairs, I did not hear a single sound once the door was closed. The front desk staff was amazing and made me feel welcomed and at home right away.
The only complaint I have is that they raised the price on Friday when I had booked for 5 nights in advance for the same price. They should mention it up front or at least when you are checking in. 

I am definitely going to stay there again and may be next time try their suite.",5,2014,08,13
27,Gem of a Hotel in Barcelona,"Hotel Bagues is one of my all-time favorite hotels: a small boutique hotel in the middle of action in Barcelona. The location is perfect to get oriented to Barcelona: next to the famous Boqueria Market, down street from one of Gaudi's first houses, next to the Metro. The service was very personal from the front desk, from ordering on-line tickets to advice about the city. My room was perfect although small, which I liked as I was travelling solo. The pool on the roof was unique, and the view of the city from the roof amazing. I will definitely stay there again if I am Barcelona!",5,2014,08,11
27,Just So-So. Over-priced unless you are easily contented!!,"Hotel is situated directly at La Rambla, the busiest street in Barcelona. The room is really small although it is decorated with designer ideas but overlooked practicality. The service is ok to some standards. If one do decide to have a drink at the rooftop bar, you have to call the concierge before heading up as there is no one attending the place. The ""swimming pool"" is so small that I can only term it as 3 combined bath tubs. Staff were polite and spoke English but all else fell below my expectations for being a 5 star hotel. ",3,2014,08,06
27,Would stay again!!,"Staff extremely helpful and pleasant.  Most everyone spoke English which was great.  We stayed on the 5th floor facing La Rambla.  For as loud as the pedestrian traffic is, it was nice to close the balcony door and not hear it.  Happy with bed, size, decor, bathroom.  Seamed like we had to keep adjusting the air conditioning but it wasn't. Enjoyed time on the rooftop patio--sunny and shady areas.  Location is perfect--easy bus ride from airport and short walk to hotel. Can walk everywhere--to Gothic area, to waterfront, to catch a tour bus.  Loved the tour bus--perfect & inexpensive way to see the city.  Can get on and off as many times as you want for the day.",5,2014,08,03
27,Convenience defeated by pretentious design,"The hotel is designed as trendy, boutique, styled etc. - but there were numerous instances when designer's zeal trumped common sense, and cause numerous instances of inconvenience - here's a list:

Bath: no handle to climb out, no soap holder, no rubber mat, no chance to reach faucet without climbing into bath itself

Wash basin: stupid design that doesn't let water run off, tap inconvenient, leaks and strains immediately

Toilet bowl suspended too high for comfort (NB toilet on the roof terrace is also suspended, but at the right height). Paper holder bass design: unrolls with great resistance, but cannot year off paper with one hand

Lack of ventilation is abysmal: after shower (key alone after using toilet) atmosphere status stagnant for hours

Room:

Dark walls and black mirrors challenge even his eyesight to see

Lighting is bad: spotlights radiate heat to such an extent, that the feeble aircon immediately losses out, and room gets hot

Storage provision is non-existent: drawers lack rear wall, do small items fall thru

There's nowhere to put away luggage

There is no chair, and the sofa is inconvenient for two, as us the table

The empty well that runs thru the middle of the building uses up space that would have been better used to provide some are for guests' common use, meetings etc.

Roof terrace:
This is a grilling torture under scorching sun. No parasols nor tent provided, so it's a health hazard after more than an hour. The empty bar looks sorry for itself, and is useless: if it is just to prove support for a phone, then a phone on the wall would have done better. There is no shower provided, and the pool is an epitome of uselessness: one runs into the walls the moment one tries to swim, like in a bath...

Health club:
""Sauna"" is in fact a steam room, but: steam is coming out at such level that it heats up maybe top third of the room, whilst the floor remains freezing cold!",3,2014,08,01
27,Luxury boutique Hotel,"Simply amazing,  it offers a unique luxury experience. Amazing staff, maximum comfort,  couldn't be more of a convenient location in the heart of La Rambla.   Highly recommend for those seeking luxury at the busiest center of the city.",5,2014,08,01
27,"Some imperfections, but amazing staff","My daughter and I stayed here for 5 nights recently, and overall it was very pleasant. The room was very modern, clean, and very quiet. There were some things that were pretty bad, though:

1. The door between the bathroom and the room proper is transparent, in every rom. If you are traveling alone, you won't notice this . If you are on your honeymoon, you may want to see your loved one sitting on the toilet, and vice-versa.  Maybe you have the luck to be from a culture that doesn't think about such things. In our case (father and teen-aged daughter who wants her privacy), it was a non-starter.

2. The electricity for the entire hotel was cut sudddenly without notice as part of a fire alarm test. I personnally was working in the ""business center"" in the middle of tranferring funds from one bank account to another, when boom! everything was dead. Did my tranfer go through or not? I couldn't tell without quite a bit of extra work later.

3. Much is made of the fabulous roof-top pool and bar. I was looking forward to hanging out there, but the ""pool"" is about 4 feet wide, 20 feet long, and 3 feet deep. I've seen much bigger gold-fish ponds in people's backyards!

Well, what did the hotel do about it? For the bathroom door, they sent up workers immediately, and they taped two black plastic trashbags onto the door, and later somebody came up and installed a nice-looking fabric curtain. For the sudden electrical cut, the general manager said, ""I'm so sorry"" and they gave me a free bottle of water. The pool, of course, is just a place to dip your feet as you sit by the side and drink. 

The ""business center"" is a computer on a tiny desk with a printer under it. There is no separate room for this; it is in the basement. There is not enough light to see the keys on the keyboard (but one of the staff brought me her personal task lamp from her desk upstairs, and then I could see the keyboard). Defintely not what one would expect from a 5-star hotel!

In general, though, the staff at the hotel was really amazing. They seemed genuinely eager to help in any way possible. They made the whole experience very pleasant overall.",4,2014,07,30
27,Awesome hotel..awesome location!,"I just returned from my first visit to Barcelona.   Hotel Bagues was such a pleasant experience. ..the staff....the room...the rooftop terrace...the Gummi treat bar...top notch!!  Comfy beds and pillows....nice cold AC!    We only had 2 nights but I will definitely be back!!  I can't express how much I enjoyed my trip and Hotel Bagues was a huge part.  Lots of special touches...very clean!  Great location. ....we walked to everything.  Staff very helpful with recommendations and directions.  Can't wait to come back!
Kristina....Tampa FL",5,2014,07,27
27,No Choice Regrets,"My boyfirend can I had a great stay at Hotel Bagues. It was our first time to Barcelona and we didn't know what to expect but Hotel Bagues made the stay that much better. The location is great, right on Las Ramblas. The entire staff from the ddor man, to the front desk, to the cleaning maid was friendly and accomodating.  As expected being Europe and a boutique hotel the rooms were small but very comfortable. I could have used more closet space but that is the least.  We could recommend this hotel to all, it was definitely a ""hit."" Thank you Hotel Bagues for making our stay in Barcelona a great one.",5,2014,07,25
27,Perfect choice,"I used Tripadvisor extensively to figure out where to stay in Barcelona. In the end I chose Hotel Bagues for it's 5 star status, prime location and small European charm. We stayed in the Jewel Suite (number 602), their largest room with the terrace. The terrace was very private being walled in with stone. To see the view however, you must be standing as the wall is quite high. There is a retractable awning that can cover the terrace for additional privacy or rain/sun protection. The room was tiny but that is what we expected. It was perfect for two. Nicely decorated. The bathroom had a tub and a shower. The bed was not exceptional quality and it was small, however, I knew the size before I booked it. The staff were friendly and helpful and could speak English well. As prime quality steak lovers we asked for a recommendation from the hotel. They recommended Patagonia Beef & Wine which is walking distance and was excellent. The hotel location is excellent and as I could tell the only 5 star hotel on La Rambla. From here you can walk for miles around the streets, you can walk to the beach or catch the bus or metro to anywhere you would like to go. Just a reminder that this excellent location does include noise, in July La Rambla was crowded with people all day and party goers all night, sirens blaring, church bells ringing next door, and on the weekends the music is loud above this room in the hotel bar. The room has excellent quality windows and doors but it only keeps out so much. If you are looking for a quiet resort, this is not it. But we were not and it was perfect ""action"" for us. I checked out the other hotels I was debating staying at and felt I had chosen well.",5,2014,07,22
27,A very attentive hotel,"A very attentive hotel

Stayed at Bagues hotel recently but only for one night, great location right on La Rambla. Hotel is quite small, swimming pool on the roof it's tiny, but it does the job of cooling you down, but don't expect to be able to do any power swimming. Very good views from the roof,  there is also a small bar, great to chill out early evening. Rooms, I noticed that a number of reviewers commented on the internal rooms with no windows, I cannot comment on these as I had a loverly room on a corner with two small balconies, this room was very good. My only concern about staying in this part of Barcelona is the comments on check in by the hotel staff, we were handed a list of do's and dont's when out and about in this part of town, apparently petty crime is rampant, pick pockets! We were reminded every time we left the hotel, not very nice. Personally I would not return to Barcelona, it's dirty and the underlying crime is very off putting, not a place to visit.",4,2014,07,19
27,"Chic hotel, nice location","At the beginning I was a little bit afraid about the ideea of a boutique hotel. But the location is excellent, personnel is very friendly and professional. The roof pool and bar is offering a charming view of Barcelona. You may face a little problem if you are over 1,8 metter high with beds. The candies at the entrace offers to all the kids in the hotel a remarcable entrance",4,2014,07,18
27,Wonderful. Great location and service.,"From the moment we walked into the hotel and we were greeted by Mercedes, the front desk manager, I knew we were in for an excellent stay. She led a very professional and pleasant staff that went out of their way to assist us.  

Separate plaudits for Mercedes, who always had a smile and a pleasant word. Can't imagine a better hostess for our first trip to Barcelona. She gave us ideas of places, helped us with directions, and always interacted with us in a fun and relaxed way. 

The room was small but adequate, since we spend most of our time away. It was very comfortable with an excellent view of the activity on La Rambla. Bathroom was very functional. Other shave noted that the subway passes underneath the area and can be heard/felt, but it did not bother us - hotel was quiet and relaxing. 

The location could not have been better, with short walk to Playa Catalunya, the metro, the rest of Gotic Bari and El Born. In addition to using the metro, we walked all around the area, including down to Barcelona Head. 

Highly recommend this hotel. We will definitely be back.",5,2014,07,18
27,So chic!,"My family booked 4 rooms and each room was spectacular! Very chic, clean and high end.  The waterfall showers were wonderful! The views of Las Ramblas were amazing.  The rooftop bar and pool is so chic! This is definitely a 5 Star accommodation.  Tip: get acquainted with the doorman, he knows everything about Barcelona and gives impeccable service! 
",5,2014,07,13
27,Perfect stay!,Fantastic location on La Rambla next to the Boqueria and minutes from the Barri Gotic.  Extremely friendly and efficient staff who couldn't do more for you.  Lovely roof top bar with a small pool area where cocktails are on offer.  Surprisingly lively until the small hours when you can just fall into bed.  Attractive rooms with marvellous sound-proofing.  Excellent breakfast and again faultless service.  This is our third visit to Barcelona and we would certainly return.,5,2014,07,09
27,Loved it from the moment we got there,"One day/night, post-cruise, and then the airport next day. Friendly guy at the door, to get started. Smallish elevators, but enough space. Room (and view) were excellent. I don't know how they do it, but even with a view (from one side) of Las Ramblas, and a view (from the other side) of what looked like a church, when the French doors were closed, the room was absolutely quiet. Room was spotless, (no carpet, all hardwood and tile flooring) bed and pillows very comfortable, bathroom big enough. Plenty of hot water from the rain shower head. Did not try the bidet--maybe some instructions for us Yanks would be a good idea! Within probably 10 minutes after we were in the room, the hotel manager was at our door with a bottle of water! Very nice. Had an online promotion for free breakfast. It was next to the lobby. Nice tables, nice buffet, but they also offered cooked to order eggs. Wife got the last chocolate croissant. Mentioned to the breakfast supervisor that I would still like to have one--he said he would check with his ""colleagues"". A few minutes later, I had a HOT croissant, right out of the oven! And it was great! Great location--easy walk back to Aerobus. Great hotel.",5,2014,07,07
27,Great way to begin a holiday trip,"For the tourist, Hotel Bauges is optimally located in the middle of the action. 10/15 minute walk to Barre Gotic, Placa Catalunya and the beach. The staff is excellent - friendly, adaptable and fast. While the rooms are small, tey are very modern and clean. The bathrooms are tops. The massive windows shut out most of the street noise however the Metro rumbles underneath the building. 

Great view from the rooftop bar. Breakfast was nice...and open until 10:30.",4,2014,07,02
27,A touch of luxury - but no view outside from all the rooms?,"This is a very nice boutique-ish hotel with a touch of luxury and attention to detail.
Impeccable service, stylish decor.

Had a single room that had a tiny entry space, sort of like an cool, miniature arrival hall, but the room was pretty small altogether. For example, there was no table for work purposes etc.

The amenities were cool and the bathroom downright luxurious.

However, I was pretty astonished to see that there was not a single window with a view outside from my room. The only window in the room had a view to a shaft that runs in the middle of the hotel all the way to the top, and this made the room pretty dark, as there's practically no natural light coming in. I found this somewhat weird at a five-star hotel. (I do apologize if there was a hidden window that I was just too stupid to find.)

As others have noted, this hotel is smack in the middle of La Rambla, so plan accordingly. If you like the hassle and the lively thing going on, great, but if you want to avoid the tourist crowds, you might wanna check elsewhere as well.",3,2014,06,17
27,Great location,"Good location on La Ramblas, despite the noise of the street the room is quiet and safe. it is fabulous to watch the activity on the street outside from the luxury of the hotel. The rooms are beautifully comfortable, not cheap of course. We ate out most of the time as there are so many places to eat and the hotel is next door but one to the amazing Mercat de la Boquerìa where there is no end of fabulous food.

The hotel staff were friendly and accommodating, booking tickets for us online to The Sagrada Família. Other than it was a little pricy, you really couldn't fault it.",5,2014,06,13
27,A very pleasant stay,"We found a very friendly Staff in the Reception as well as the two young people serving the breakfast, perfekt lokation in the heart of Barcelona, the Bedroom is little, but very stilish.
Breakfast was fine, fresh food, as told above, perfekt and friendly service.",5,2014,06,10
27,Best for Busy Traveller,"The Hotel is very clean and modern, the staff is young and attentive. Even the La Rambla street is very busy day/night, you cannot hear a thing when you are in a rooom. Location is very convenient as the hotel is located mid-way to everything - shopping, theaters, Gotic district, hop on hop off bus stops, port, and most excursions departire points. 
Very nice roof top patio, and a good quality little restaurant on a groud floor. 

There is a flamenco show just up on the street, great performance.",5,2014,06,09
27,Right on Ramblas.,"Stayed at Bagues twice,once in April and again in May,we could not fault the staff,they went out of their way to accommodate our wishes,stored our luggage until our return,helped us with posting  a huge box back home.
All the little touches like wine and chocolate welcome, and special bag of toiletries,was very much appreciated.
We enjoyed a lovely breakfast,the best fresh orange juice ever,and very pleasant staff.
Our room was on Ramblas but not too noisy,the only niggle would be to have a better table for putting the computer on,and a couple of suitcase holders,very smartly decorated and a comfortable bed ,what more could you want? 
Would use this property again if in Barcelona.
Think about becoming a member of small luxury hotels of the world,...has good benefits for members staying at boutique hotels.",5,2014,06,08
27,Meh. 4 stars in my opinon.,"Luckily I got a decent room with a good window. But this place is really expensive for what you get, most likely due to the fact that it's right on La Rambla. It was too busy for us. The room was tiny, as was the bed. The bathroom was nice and modern. I've stayed in places half the price with twice the value. My experience wasnt bad (worth 4 stars, barely) but it's far too expensive me to stay here again.",4,2014,06,06
27,The Perfect Place to stay in Barcelona,"i recommend this hotel for everyone, we got a room viewing La Rambla which is great. Room is excellent modern decor, clean Perfect location for walking and the staff were very nice & helpful in any request you need, very nice hotel..",5,2014,06,05
27,Disappointment,"Our room was without outside window, we had a feeling like we stayed in the basement - no air or natural light which is totally unacceptable for a 5 star hotel. The room was very small, little space in the closet but the fact that we did not have any light or air from outside was the worst. We had a feeling we stayed at the worst room in hotel. When we complained about the room, the hotel personnel just did not care. But other from that situation, the personnel was very polite and helpful. However, the room looked nothing like the picture on splendia / booking.com, so we felt cheated.",2,2014,05,27
27,Perfect Place to Stay in Barca,"My wife and I recently stayed here for three nights before a cruise and we loved the place.  Excellent modern décor mixed with timeless accents.  Attentive personal service.  Immaculately clean.  Perfect location for walking or transit and close to all the sites.  The breakfasts were amazing.  Honestly have trouble thinking of any way to improve.  Maybe the mattresses could be softer, but I think that is like chasing a mirage in Europe.  Keep it up.",5,2014,05,26
27,LOVED THIS HOTEL!!!,"I'm a hotel junky. Or just totally neurotic about where I stay on vacation and this hotel was perfection. Perfect location. Perfect size. Perfect staff. Can't recommend it enough. The concierge even found us amazing tickets to a soccer match which made our trip! If you love luxury, authentic boutique hotels that could be no where in the world other then right where they are then BOOK THIS ONE!!! It's really amazing all around!",5,2014,05,16
27,Fabulous stay again,This was our second stay and it just got even better! The meal was excellent and the staff superb.comfortable beds and in spite of overlooking la ramblas the windows were so good you could hear nothing from the street. I could not recommend this hotel more highly,5,2014,05,08
27,Brilliant,"I picked this hotel after reading the very positive reviews on Tripadvisor. It is perfectly located and given it is so central, was well sound proofed from the busy outside. The room and ensuite bathroom were beautifully decorated and comfortable. The staff were most professional. We will definitely stay here again when we return to wonderful Barcelona!",5,2014,05,06
27,Great 40th anniversary  stay,"Can't fault the hotel.
Staff so helpful and friendly,everywhere clean ,quiet rooms,comfortable bed,great service throughout.
A suprise 40th wedding anniversary present from the kids , will be back.
Wonderful location",5,2014,04,30
27,Ideal for a short break in Barcelona,"An inspired choice by my partner. We do enough of the big chain hotels to know what they provide - what's harder to find are friendly, efficient, comfortable and funky hotels like this one. Ideally situated right on La Rambla (noise not an issue thanks to the sound proof windows) and very convenient for the Gothic Quarter, Plaza Catalunya, the port area and Montjuic. 
Rooms are small but well equipped and comfortable. The decor is modern and a good antidote to the usual dull and lifeless colours found in the big chain hotels. Breakfast in the restaurant is very good (we did not use it for lunch or dinner) and the staff are all friendly and extremely helpful.
The roof top terrace is a great extra feature - especially as drinks and refreshments can be served there - and the sweets just inside the door are a nice touch. 
Would definitely stay here again. Recommended.",4,2014,04,22
27,Overall Great Hotel,"Overall, this is a nice hotel in a great location, convenient to most anything near the Gothic Quarter.
The room was clean, stylish and comfortable, but small (however, this is Europe so I've come to only be surprised if a room is bigger than expected).
Staff was friendly and helpful.
Bathroom was fine but just an FYI - bathroom door is transparent so if you are sharing the room with someone make sure you know them well or don't mind getting to know them better ;-)
Definitely not a room for a business traveler since there is no desk or anywhere that you would be able to work.
Room is reasonably well sound-proofed but you can hear the rumblings from the street - and nighttime sirens seem to be common on the weekend.
WiFi was OK, but the ""free"" wifi is only a basic connection (email, etc).  If you want decent speed you have to pay extra (although the additional cost is reasonable compared to other hotels in Europe)
Great rooftop terrace - nice place for a morning cup of coffee or evening cocktail.
Fitness center is basic and small
Breakfast is great with a lot of food selections - it was included in my room rate so I can't comment on the cost but generally in Europe you'll pay 20-30 Euros if purchased separately.",5,2014,04,21
27,Excellent!,"Perfect location. Friendly staff. Good restaurant. Beautiful room, just a little bit small. Really close to boqueria. There´s a really good bar near the hotel called lobo bar. Our room had a great view of La Rambla. Itp´s was really a pleasant experience. I would definitely stay again at this hotel.",5,2014,04,14
27,Great Boutique Hotel in Las Ramblas,"A good priced boutique hotel in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. Perfect for quickly getting to the city and center of it all.  One step outside, you are in action.  Take a left and a few steps, you are in the city center, near all the tour buses and near the Gaudi Buildings.  

Great view small the rooftop, nice bathrooms and comfortable rooms. The customer service was good, speak english well and had a candy bar just for the fun of it. Great for this sugarholic.",5,2014,04,09
27,Cost x Expectation = Mixed Feelings,"The location is fantastic giving easy access to the many and varied attractions of this delightful city. Balancing the average cost of a deluxe room over four nights (£216 per night) I was slightly disappointed.
It is a stylish hotel but first impressions of a small, uninspiring reception area are not good and the only other public rooms were the appealing roof top terrace and the dark basement corridor where the public computer is situated.
Staff, generally, were very friendly and helpful - if asked - but not innovative. 
Our room had  two small balconies and was well sound proofed allowing no noise to penetrate from the pulsating beat on Las Ramblas. The hotel is well maintained and very clean, our room was spotless and the bathroom contemporary in design, just lacking a soap dish in the shower/bath area and more space to hang towels.
Breakfast was excessively expensive so every morning we walked 200 meters to the wonderfully authentic Viena Cafe which turned breakfast into one of the highlights of our time in Barcelona.
We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Bagues but, all-round, don't feel we really had a five star experience.",4,2014,04,09
27,"Hotel Bagues, Barcelona","I stayed at this hotel in March of 2014.  Outstanding Hotel - the entire service team was excellent, dining lounge food was very good!  Location right on La Rambla was perfect and the rooms are very soundproof so the late night activity on the street did not bother me at all.  The morning breakfast we very good and substantial.  My room was a perfect size with all the needed amenities.  The stand out for me was the level of attention and services.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,03,30
27,Happy Lee Family,"We stayed at this hotel for a few days on our way to cruise round the med, the staff were friendly and could not do enough for us. the food was excellent, the hotel was clean, beds were comfy, there was a power shower, clean white towels. 
We thought that being on the main road it would be noisy at night but in fact it was very quiet.  We would definitely stay in this hotel again when we visit Barcelona.",5,2014,03,24

Surprise the tiny swimming pool and the bar at the rooftop with city view. Very good room service whenever you wanted.

I would suggest this hotel to those who visit Barcelona for a city break and who love small hotels which are set in buildings restored with respect.",5,2014,03,06
27,"Amazing, well located, very good value for money and comfort","

The location of the hotel in perfect, in the heart of the city, the staff is really good and they are really helpful, they gave us everything we need and we asked for, even with some info regarding tourist places or taxi reservations they did their best to help us. the room is nicely decorated, the toilet is very nicely looked, the small terrace in nice for some fresh air, the corridors and the stairs looks nice and the breakfast is very good and you have a lot of choices of food with some that you have to ask to get like the omelette. When we made the reservation we asked for the view to be on the La Rambla, twin bed room and to cover the toilet door and I got all what I have asked for. They have a small GYM downstairs with a sauna and a small table a computer with a printer on it to be used by any guest. At the last floor they have a bar with a nice view and a small pool. They have a small museum at the first floor as well. The hotel is quiet and giving the comfort feeling. The room service and the housekeeping is good each time we order a room service or let them clean the room we either have a small chocolate or a bottle of water and small pieces of chocolate as a gift which was so nice from them.

Although the rooms and the corridors are small due to the age of the building but it's really nicely looking. The hotel blocked the room rate about one day before arrival. The wifi was free and at a good speed but you need to sign in again every time. That's about it ",5,2014,02,22

The hotel looks lovely - stylish blacks and browns with well designed lighting. Comfy bed, great power shower, nice and cool. We were upgraded on arrival and given a complementary bottle of wine on our arrival too which was really nice. The location is unbeatable. Its right on La Rambla, near the plaza de Catalunya where the tour buses go from. We didn't have the breakfast but we were offered a discount on it. Its just that there are so many places near by to try breakfast. there is free wifi in the hotel too. Although the room faced La Rambla it was very quiet.

The hotel was small and intimate, and although the restaurant downstairs was small, it had a really good atmosphere and the food was delicious and used local ingredients. Also, the decorantions where beautiful. 
The rooms were very nice, nicely decorated, but it was pretty small, and we were lacking some table space. A plus was that you could´t hear the outside noises. 
All in all, I recomend this hotel for a weeks stay.",4,2013,12,28
27,Excellent location and service,"Brilliant location on Las Ramblas, easy walk to the sea and into town. Hotel staff are courteous and helpful. Decor is very stylised. Rooms are quite dark, but luxurious. Lighting in rooms is good. I would prefer if the bathroom door was not glass, not least because putting the light on in the bathroom at night lights up the bedroom! Powerful shower is a plus point. Wifi in rooms is free but the service is painful with repeated logins required every time you enter your room. Nice bar and pool on the roof. Would happily visit again.",4,2013,12,27
27,Wonderful Chic Hotel in Central Location,"We decided to stay at the Hotel Bagues on our recent visit to Barcelona and I have to say, we were not disappointed.  

First impressions; 

The Hotel is placed very centrally in the main thoroughfare - Las Ramblas and from the outside looks very elegant and picturesque.  

The staff; The door man was very welcoming and the reception staff could not have been more helpful if they had tried. Bell-hop; very informative and gave us a brief history on the hotel en route to our room and once there walked us around explaining how everything worked.

The room; In truth it was slightly smaller than I expected but being a boutique hotel, this was probably my fault for having slightly skewed expectations this all said, the room was decorated very nicely (albeit a bit dark) and was very comfortable and more than adequate.  The en-suite was also decorated to a very high standard having a nice deep bath/shower but again, just a little on the dark side.  The bed, we found to be very comfortable but if you are any taller than my Wife and I (both 5' 10"") you may end up having your feet overhanging the end of the bed.  The only downside that we found was not really to do with the hotel, well. other than the location.  Right next door there is a church and we found out that they quite like to ring their bells, a lot! Whilst the room is well sound proofed after a while, especially on Sunday morning) the constant dinging manages to break the sound proofing down.  This said, if you like churches (and it is a beautiful church) this could be  plus side.  Finally; we found the mini bar to be well stocked and reasonable.

Restaurant; Whilst we didn't eat a full meal in the restaurant we did have a round of oysters which the hotel have as their speciality.  I guess oysters are oysters but the staff were very polite and helpful, as were all staff (including cleaners) that we encountered during our stay.  Looking at the menu (which we didn't try) it looked very extravagant but not overly priced and the restaurant always seemed to be full and quite often with locals which in my book is always a good thing.

In summary - a  nice 5* boutique hotel, ideally placed for roaming around Barcelona with wonderful staff.  A little pricey but would I go back? - I think I would, which I guess is the acid test.

I hope you find this to be helpful.",4,2013,12,12
27,Great Hotel in Ideal Location,"Ideal Location at the heart of La Rambla. Very beautiful, fantastic decorated and exclusive hotel. 
Very warm welcoming and great service from everyone working at the hotel.

Only minus for women is the mirror available only in the bathroom with not much lighting for makeup etc as well as the glass door of the bathroom that allows you to watch your partner doing all the 'activities' :)",4,2013,11,26
27,Pros and cons,"The hotel is gorgeous, great location, staff friendly and professional.  I was pleasantly surprised at the food in the small restaurant.   My only criticism was their inside rooms.  We had 2 rooms that closed off to make it into a private suite.  Well the front room which overlooked the street was fine although all the rooms are very small, the inside room while it had a window looked straight out at the lifts so had no privacy unless you kept the curtains closed, which we had to do and this presented its own problem. The room had absolutely no day light and with the mood lighting that most hotels have it was like being in a dungeon. If I was to stay there again I would ask for the rooms in the front.  The soundproofing is good so no traffic noise. There free WI-FI has to tiers and the 1st tier (free) was thru an outside vendor so you had to sign into their website to access the internet, plus it kept dropping and the 2nd was around Euro 13.00 per day.",4,2013,11,21
27,Great Allround,Great Hotel Great Staff can not say anything bad about it :)  Stayed here a few now and each and every time I do I have found everything to be excellent.  The Staff are very helpful and offer help with anything they can help with.,5,2013,11,20
27,Wonderful hotel,"A top class hotel. Beautifully decorated, extremely friendly and courteous staff, lovely room. Can't praise it enough. Would definitely stay there again. It was also a fab location - right in the heart of the city, near plenty of bars and restaurants",5,2013,11,14
27,Where earphones !!,"Great hotel,perfect location,friendly staff,all excellent apart from don't believe what it says in the brochure about "" sound proof rooms !! "" Obviously the couple in the room next to ours did !! Say no more !!
Everything else great and I'm sure he was aswell !!
We would still recommend the hotel though.",4,2013,11,13
27,Great location & excellent staff,"My husband & I stayed here for a long weekend, the location was perfect a stones throw from the Gothic Quarter. The rooms are of a reasonable size, nice decor, mini bar & no noise from the very busy La Ramblas. The staff were excellent couldn't have been more helpful, booking taxis, printing tickets for us and generally very friendly. We didn't eat at the hotel but we did partake in a couple of drinks in the bar, and the staff again we're very attentive I  would definitely recommend.",4,2013,11,11
27,Great experience and location,"I have done extensive research as where to stay during our 5 nights trip to Barcelona.  My wife and I wanted an intimate boutique hotel on La Rambla. This hotel didn't disappoint. The minute you arrive the staff at the front desk are eager to provide an experience of luxury that is care free. We were given a tour of a few different rooms upon request so we can decide what side of the hotel we want to be at. We chose to be on the La Rambla side since the noise cancelling windows are amazing. You can't hear anything once you close the windows shut. For those who are looking for a large and expansive hotel and/or rooms, this is not the hotel for them. However if you are interested in an intimate property, great service coupled with a great location, this is the hotel to stay at. 2 blocks from the world famous Boqueria market where you can buy fresh juices, fruit, meat, vegetables, fish .... etc. We never felt healthier than going to this market every day for breakfast and also buying the fresh baguette, cheese, wine and figs for early evening feast before the late late dinners.  We loved every thing about this hotel. We have already recommended the property to so many of our friends.  Don't listen to the negative stuff you ready, just book there you will LOVE it.  A apecial thank you to the great staff at Bagues for making our stay special and memorable.  Cheers!!",5,2013,11,11
27,"Central, modern, small, 5 star Hotel","Very friendly staff.  Lovely rooms with sound proofing (open the windows and you really know you are in the middle of a city!)  Small restaurant and bar area.  Went up to see the roof-top bar and small pool - sure it would be lovely in the summer.  Good security - you need your key card to access staircase and lift and there is a doorman, so you do feel very safe.  Used the sauna, which was great after a long day walking around the city.",5,2013,11,05
27,Best stay,"This is our first trip to Barcelona .. The hotel meet our expectation, it's will located in the middle close to every were, rooms are great , and the staff are very friendly they ware a great help to us which make our trip easy and wonderful .. 
We will be back to Barcelona and we will be back to Bagues Hotel defiantly ❤",5,2013,11,02
27,Central and bijou,"The standard rooms are fairly small but very comfortable and perfectly formed with kingsize beds, good sized wardrobes and a flatscreen TV and iPod station, minibar/fridge and safe.  The bathrooms have no baths, but a large rainwater shower with very good water pressure.  The style is Arts & Crafts with Rennie Mackintosh style beds, dark wood and distressed gold furniture, slate bathrooms and wooden floors.  Everything is spotless.  

Our room had a view over the Ramblas, but because the windows are triple glazed, it was pretty quiet and it was nice to look outside, watch the hustle & bustle, and check the weather.  

We Loved: Beautiful interiors, friendly and helpful staff, central location within walking distance of restaurants and bars, lovely rooftop terrace with a small (unheated) pool.  Towels and linens were good quality, good air-con and nice touches of personality such as fresh flowers, a gift bottle of wine and chocolates in the room, and jars of pick and mix sweets in the lobby for you to snack on.  
Flaws:  The pillows weren't very substantial, hairdryer was very small - bring your own if you need a good one, and their own-brand toiletries weren't very special.    

The hotel breakfast is very expensive - on check-in we were offered a reduced rate of 15 euro per day each, but instead we just got pastries and coffees or fruit smoothies a stones throw from the hotel in the Boqueria or one of the many local patisseries every day for a few euros.",5,2013,10,27
27,Bagues Hotel - Simply Wonderful!,"The hotel itself is simply wonderful. The interior decoration is stunning and the attention to detail is quite brilliant. The themes are representative of the city of Barcelona, art deco runs throughout and the shape of the building on the inside is inspired by the great artistic traditions that Barcelona is famous for. The rooms are designed well, and are beautiful and functional. The shower after a thirty hour journey from Australia was the perfect remedy for the rigours of the long-haul flight. From the moment I arrived to sadly checking out, the staff were simply brilliant: kind & genial, I was in BCN on business and the staff were so helpful when I needed it most. I can not recommend this hotel enough - To everyone at the marvellous Hotel Bagues - Moltes Gracies a tots!",5,2013,10,25
27,The best option in Barcelona,"We stayed in this exelent hotel few days ago. We recomend it 100%. The service is exelent, always smaily and very kind. The rooms are very confortable with a beautifull view. The location is on the hart of the city with a good comunication. We hope tu return soon!! 
",5,2013,10,22
27,GREAT HOTEL IN THE HEART OF BARCELONA,"We stayed at the bagues for two nights as we had tickets to see The Barcelona football team. It´s a very good hotel with helpful, attentive staff especially Ivo and Mercedes, they really went out of their way to help us in every way possible. I couldn´t praise them enough for their efforts, from booking restaurants to sight seeing trips.
We didn´t have the breakfast as we prefered to walk to the Boqueria market which is less than 5 minutes from the hotel. The room was quite dark but we didnt spend much time there. However the bed was comfortable and we had a nice view of the rambla. We were very pleased that we were able to check out later than the specified time, without having to pay any additional charges, we would like to thank Pablo for making this possible! 
All in all, we had a great stay in a lovely hotel with excellent service from staff who go the extra mile. We are already planning on returning to the hotel for Christmas!",5,2013,10,21
27,"great location, excellent staff, pity they let the designer in the bathroom","This is overall a good choice for the centre of Barcelona. The rooms are on the small side, but attractive and comfortable.They are well soundproofed which is needed given the location. The bathrooms however demonstrate design over practicality with no rails to hang bath towels, shaving mirror awkwardly placed and requiring one to get into the bath to work the plug or the shower. A glass door may look fine in the design but is less so when one needs to use the loo during the night and  the light shines straight into the bedroom.
The restaurant is well worth trying. We had an excellent meal and they serve an outstanding gin and tonic! Breakfast is first class. Staff generally were very helpful and friendly. 
A few caveats - we needed a late checkout as we were catching the night train; there was no room available which is understandable, but there is no sitting area once you are out of your room. We ended up at a table in the restaurant.Secondly we arranged for a car to collect us on arrival from the station. A Mercedes and driver duly met us but at a cost of E88 for a 15 minute transfer. To be fair we were told the price in advance but one might like to consider a taxi. I had assumed the drive must be much longer. Finally the WiFi is a disaster. For some reason it is almost impossible to get it to work with Apple devices. In the end I just paid to use my mobile network. The hotel know there is a problem - so they should sort it out.",4,2013,10,21
27,Honeymoon in the Dog House!,"We stayed in the Hotel Bagues for our honeymoon in September.  When we booked it the agent contacted the hotel and they confirmed they would do something special for us on arrival as it was our honeymoon.  I was just to contact the hotel a few days in advance to remind them.  I did this by email and in response got a price list of extras we could book!  This was a minor issue though and we were very excited heading off on honeymoon and really looking forward to staying in a 5 star hotel and since we have had children, we don't get to do this as often as we used to.  Location of the hotel was fantastic as we only had 4 nights away and it was right in the centre of Las Ramblas.  This was very convenient for walking around the city and soaking up the atmosphere.  Be prepared though as on arrival in our room, we were very taken aback at the size.  It was tiny.  Just enough space for the double bed, a small locker on each side and then right beside the bed a tiny table and 2 chairs.  No space to move around at all.  The décor, although very nice and very gothic, is not at all practical or functional (especially for any ladies out there).  There are no mirrors other than the one over the sink in the bathroom, which is very dimly lit.  Therefore doing makeup and hair is very awkward (and also very hit and miss in that lighting!!).  If you want to look at yourself in a full length mirror, you have to close the wardrobe or bathroom door and switch on and off lights until you get rid of all the glares and then view yourself in a shadowy reflection in the smoky glass doors.  The other major downside to the layout of the hotel is that there is nowhere at all to just lounge and read or relax.  The only seating is in the restaurant area - which is separated from reception by a small partition.  We thought maybe the rooftop terrace with cocktail bar and terrace would improve our first impressions and headed up to relax with a cocktail.  Unfortunately, once there you realise the pool is even smaller than the website shows, the cocktail bar is literally an empty bar with a phone.  you have to ring down to reception to order a drink and wait quite a while for it to be brought up to you.  This was on the afternoon of our arrival, and it got worse.  When we went back up to the terrace that evening before we went out, the gate was closed and we were informed at reception that the terrace would be closed for the next 2 days as a staff member had called in sick and they had no cover!!  We spent all of our time leaving the hotel as the room was claustrophobic and with nowhere to relax, it made no sense to hang around at all.  On arrival back from dinner on our second night though we did ask for a drink in the restaurant and were told that we could have one but had to sign off straight away as they were closing the bar.  That was at 11.30pm.  On our 3rd night we came back at 11.30 again and told again that the bar was closed to residents at this time.  They then told us to go to our room and call for room service.  We did this and were told on the phone to just use the mini bar!  After some discussion, they did eventually bring us up room service, however, it did involve a bit of a battle and an official complaint from me.  
Another point to note is that the hotel advertise a gym and sauna etc.  This is actually a tiny room with , as far as I can remember 2 pieces of equipment if not 1.  If you would like to use the sauna you need to give staff 1 hours notice in order that they can heat it up!!  
Upon checking out the receptionist asked about our stay and I noted all of these things to her again and told her I had heard nothing from a manager, even though I had been told I would be contacted.  She was very apologetic and seemed resigned to the matters I mentioned - it seemed as if she'd heard it all before to be honest.  She took a note of my email address and contact details.  However, to date, I have still had no contact from anyone at the hotel in relation to the complaint.  
I must say though, that the staff who were working there during our stay were all very pleasant in their manner and the bad review does not reflect on them.  
Overall , I do not know how this hotel received its 5 star status.  It was approximately €400 per night not including breakfast and yet it was one of the most claustrophobic, uncomfortable and frustrating stays I have ever had in any status of hotel.",1,2013,10,16
27,Great location & service,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel Bagues for two nights to start our 10-day holiday in Spain. We were very pleased with the hotel. For starters, the location was excellent- on the northern part of Las Ramblas (very close to La Boqueria), we were centrally located for most everything we wanted to see. We could either walk or take the metro, which was very easy to do, as an entrance to the subway was just a block from the hotel.

Our room was very clean, but also on the smaller side, which was fine because we did not spend much time in our room. While the accommodations were very nice, the bed was a bit firm for my taste (but so were all the other beds we had in Spain). The only odd thing about the room was that the bathroom had a clear glass door and was located right in front of the bed. I would have preferred more privacy.

At any rate, the service in the hotel was top notch. From the doorman to the staff behind the front desk, everyone was very friendly and very willing to answer our questions about the city and meet our every need. 

As an aside (having nothing to do with the hotel), after reading about all the pickpockets in Barcelona, we were on the lookout, and I did thwart a pickpocket attempt, as a overly persistent man was trying to sell me futbol tickets, while at the same time reach into my front pocket. He was harmless, after I grabbed his hand hard and told him to leave us alone. That was the only nuisance we encountered on the whole trip. My advice is to wear a money belt and be aware of your surroundings.",4,2013,10,14
27,Brilliant Hotel,"We stayed here end of August 2013 and absolutely loved it.  

Staff were so friendly and couldnt do enough to help you.  Price was fair for what you got.  The building was beautiful with lots of detail. The roof top bar gave amazing views, and we were the only customers when we used it!!

It was a perfect location for us.  Central to most places we wanted to visit.  Right near the underground and some lovely local bars down the side streets.

We had a room with a Jacuzzi which was a lovely treat after a day walking round the city. The rooms are small but fully equipped.  We especially liked the separate living area.  My only negative would be the no blind on the bathroom window - our room was over looked by a neighbouring hotel roof restaurant and felt like was being watched whilst showering!  No idea if they could actually see in or not as there was a privacy switch on the glass door into the bathroom.",4,2013,10,13
27,Best place during my honeymoon,"Well , i said it once and ill say it again ... This is the best hotel i have ever been to and it was so wonderful and friendly and budget friendly ... I liked it like no other hotel , and from now on whenever i may go to barcelona , ill book this hotel ...",5,2013,10,10
27,Excellent Boutique Hotel Barcelona,"Right from Check in - which was efficient but very friendly to the facilities and service - Couldn't come more highly recommended. The location on La Rambla gives you quick access to major transport plus the sights, smells and foods that are the character of Barcelona.",5,2013,10,01
27,Awesome hotel,"We stayed at Hotel Bagues, a beautiful boutique hotel in September 2013.  The staff were very helpful, the rooms were well appointed and the rooftop patio has an amazing view of the city.  The location is perfect for walking, and close to local transit.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the city.  The hotel is on Las Ramblas a great gathering street, full of characters.",5,2013,10,01
27,Great Hotel/Great Staff,"We were very happy with our 3 night stay at Hotel Bagues.  The location is great (if you like being close to the action).  You are within easy walking distance to numerous places including the market, shopping and restaurants.  The staff in the hotel were wonderful.....very pleasant, helpful and accommodating.  The room was clean and modern and the shower in our bathroom was wonderful.  I would definately stay in this hotel again and I would recommend it to my friends!!",5,2013,10,01
27,Great location. Terribly designed bathrooms.,"Service and location were great; but I have two MAJOR problems with the bathrooms:

1. The door between the bathroom and the bedroom was made of glass. I have no desire to see my wife/girlfriend/family member when they are in the bathroom, so who came up with the idea? Furthermore, because of this brilliant design, the bedroom would be bright every time someone wanted to use the bathroom in the middle if the night. 

2. The sink was rectangular and FLAT!! Imagine every bathroom sink you've ever seen in your life. Aren't they all shaped like a bowl, so gravity would force the water to go down, through the drain? Well, not in this hotel. The sink has no low point, so whatever you put on the sink (toothpaste, spit, dirt that you wash off your hands, ....) would just stay there. 

Please tell me the brilliant innovative bathroom designer was not paid. He should have been arrested for incompetence!

27,beautifully hotel boutique,"While this is a beautifully hotel boutique, we stayed at the Bagues hotel in September and could not have been more pleased; all the staff provided such great service they are very friendly. 
The room we booked was Double Superior room facing to the church, room and bathroom very dark but nice design with complimentary water on our arrival day.

We will definitely return should we come back to Barcelona and highly recommended!",5,2013,09,28
27,Excellent stay .. Friendly service ... Great location,"Just cannot beat this location right on Los Rambles close to other sights and squares. The market, the opera house, and the metro are steps away. Very nice and friendly service. The upstairs lounge is a hidden find for evenings.",4,2013,09,24
27,Great location but overpriced,"A centrally located hotel, which makes it very convenient to walk around the city centre. The staff were very friendly and eager to assist. However this 5 star hotel is overpriced for the services it provides.",4,2013,09,11
27,Just got back! Had a gret Trip!,"I was just at this beautiful hotel for 6 nights and I enjoyed my stay there very much.  From check-in to check-out I was greeted with smiles and helpful people constantly.  The entire rece[tion staff was very helpful and a gentleman by the name of Fabio was a tremendous help. The room was very nice but the only knock I had against it, was that there was no coffee machine.  Other than that detail i thoroughly enjoyed my stay with this hotel and will hopefully be back to visit soon.",4,2013,09,10
27,Barcelona Bagues,"Staying at the Bagues was a very good experience! We really enjoyed our stay: the location is perfect, the service was very good and the staff was very helpful. The design room was great and we were lucky to have a view on the Ramblas. I would love to book this hotel again",4,2013,09,03
27,Great Location Very friendly staff,"I had a very good service and a wonderful pool-bar experience on the top floor. The location is just perfect for walking on the La Rambla and down to the harbour. 
I did not really like to have animal hide on my floors and sofas .. but otherwise the room was very nice and soundproof !",4,2013,09,03
27,Great place to stay!,"1st impression is important. We were greeted by the porter (forgot his name!) he was brilliant throughout our stay and he's always helpful. The second person we met was Mercedes who was the manager in charge and she was excellent. Not only helpful but she has taken time to explain everything to all of us in great details. One night, she even walked my wife to a really nice restaurant nearby just to make sure we won't get lost! 7 of us, 4 rooms, all were fine and we loved the rain shower! Breakfast is good and my father and in-laws loved it. The hotel location is excellent, right in the middle of La Rambla. Overall, quality people offering quality services, we enjoyed our stay and definitely recommend this to anyone. P.S. the worst thing they have at the hotel front entrance is the candy bar, it's free :) .... we can't resist taking them everytime when we walked past it.",4,2013,08,29
27,The Barcelona Experience,"The location is excellent. We arrived 8.00pm for a 4 night stay. Was asked if we wanted breakfast for the special price of 14 euro each. The offer was only good to midnight - hard sell straight away. Not impressed.  Room is very adequate with bottle of cold water and glasses. Next night - no water???. Ask - water is only free the first nigh????. The hotel is to chicy and thinks its really clever but its not. Having a jewel display and charging 25 euro for two scotch on the rocks ( in plastic cups) on the rooftop bar is want I expected.  Would only recommend for those who thinks its cool to be ripped off. Service very poor, room small , prices high 3 stars at best",2,2013,08,27
27,Fabulous Boutique Hotel,"Fabulous staff, friendly hotel, really enjoyed our stay, and would definitely return, excellent location, very central.
Hotel is also very modern (less than 3 years old) very clean.

Highly Recommended",5,2013,08,23
27,Excellent location and service with one complaint,"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel.  The front desk staff were very friendly and the hotel is clean.  It seems as though it must have been renovated recently because everything seems fairly new inside.  The location right on La Rambla is very convenient and we could walk to most of the major sights and activities.  Also, the metro stop is right across the street if needed.  Even though our room directly faced La Rambla we heard no noise from the street below.  My only complaint has to do with the door to the bathroom.  It is made of clear glass, which was a problem for us in two ways.  First, one of our rooms was for our older teenage kids (one girl and one boy).  However, from the bedroom you can clearly see directly into the bathroom, including a full view of the shower, which also had clear glass.  The hotel did attach a small curtain to the window for us upon request, but it provided only partial coverage, leaving an inch or two exposed on the edges.  The second problem with this arrangement is that if someone gets up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, the light illuminates the entire bedroom, making it impossible to sleep.  This hotel would get a perfect rating if not for this issue.",4,2013,08,21
27,"EXCELLENT LOCATION, ROOMS, FOOD.","Stayed here for 5 nights and really enjoyed. We included breakfast which was tapas style and it was very good. Our room faced the church in the side street but still gave us a view of La Ramblas. The location of this hotel is just perfect. Walking out the hotel you are right in the middle of everything. Churches, shopping, food and a 5 minutes walk to the hop on/hop off busses. I stayed there with my teenage daughter and she felt incredibly spoilt. The roof top pool is only a small lap lane pool. We still used it and enjoyed the views of Barcelona. The staff were always very helpful. I would definitely stay there again. ",5,2013,08,17
27,Excellent service,"We loved the location of this hotel.  I was worried that it would be noisy, but even though our room overlooked (with a small balcony) La Rambla, we slept in quiet peace.  It was quite pricey, but the service was excellent.  There is very little space for toiletries or hanging towels in the bathroom.  It was also difficult to keep a cool temperature in the room.  We had a superior room.  Our daughter had a cheaper room with no exterior window and her room was always cool.  Nice amenities and a wonderful view from the rooftop bar at night.",4,2013,08,15
27,Perfect location,"We stayed here for 4 nights, and very much enjoyed everything about this hotel. It is perfectly located on La Ramblas, equidistant to the main Catalunya Square for picking up the open top buses (good way to explore the city) and to the marina and beach; across the road is the Real Square, (prime people watching spot) and the beautiful Food Market is one block along. Obviously La Ramblas is busy, but our room at the front (5th floor) was soundproofed and we slept well, apart from some VERY loud thunder one night! 
The hotel itself is modern, cleverly designed, and very comfortable, the bed firm but not hard, the shower a treat. Yes, the bathroom doors are smoked glass, but the wc/bidet is private, and should cause no embarrassment unless sharing with a total stranger! The maid service was carried out discreetly, to a very high standard every day. The rooms are a decent size for a European city hotel, with a small balcony, and the decor is dark but stylish.
We did not use the restaurant, but it looked nice and was popular in the evening; we preferred breakfast in the market. We did visit the rooftop terrace on 2 occasions, but it was rather busy the first time, and the bar was closed on the second (Monday) but it was pleasant, with lovely views over Barcelona. 
A special mention should go to Mercedes, part of the excellent reception team; she was very efficient, charming and helpful at all times, and made us feel very well looked after. I recommend booking for the Sagrada Familia from the hotel in advance, which saved a good hour or more of queuing in the heat! 
Our only problem was with the wardrobe drawers- they have no back or sides (silly) but that was literally the only thing we could find fault with. It's not cheap, but we felt it was money well spent. All in all, very highly recommended. ",5,2013,08,10
27,It is not 5 star hotel!!!!,"Probably when you stay in this hotel for 2-3 days you can like it and not pay so much attention for the bad sides of service and quality. But we stayed there for a long term and in the end it was real disaster.
Firstly when we arrived in the hotel we liked it. Perfect location (in the heart of La Rambla). Nice interior. Reception staff was nice. Really disliked the aromatic smell in the lobby - it is too specific, not neutral, but anyway it is individual. The room was small, but what can you expect from the old building... Terrase was devided for two parts: jacuzzi and solarium. There were matrases on the solarium and there were so much dust with sticky spots of the red wine under it!!!!!!!!  You never know if they have even cleaned the matras after previous guests. During the whole week our bedclothes was not changed. On the 3rd day of staying in the morning I've put showercoats to the floor for changing. When we arrived at the late evening there were no showercoats in the room, jacuzzi was dusty and the hosekeeping removed the flowers from the bathroom (permanent compliment). The next day we've got dying old rose instead of the previous in the bathroon.....
I forgot to say that each evening the hosekeeping comes to the room with kind of ""good night"" procedure: she closes the curtains and put candies on the each side of the bed (so, 2 candies). I gathered candies on the separate table and I think on the 4th day of staying I realized that those new 2 candies on my bed were taken exactly from the table, because there were less of them!!!! 
Then  I've put 3 plastic bags (thanks God they were empty) to the table. I don't mean that plastic bags were important to me or so, but as a fact: housekeeping removed them!!!!!! Do they have ANY trainings of the behaviour with guests belongings???
And the last day was the crown of what was happening.... We had to go to the airport at 11.30am, so had really short time to pack our luggage. Our breakfast was included during the whole stay and it was said (and written) that if the breakfast is included it costs only 5 euros just to bring it to the room - just up to the 6th floor to the Jewel Suite. So we filled the paper at night that we wanted breakfast to the room since 10am till 10.30am.........It was 10.35 when I called the reception to ask where my breakfast is. In 5 minutes the frightened girl knocked to the door and brougt 2 not huge - GIANT trays with food and gave us the bill for 77 euros. When we asked for what, she and then receptionist said that they never had such service to the Jewel Suite - only full payment!. That we don't pay extras only when we eat in the restaurant downstairs. Ok, when we started to eat we realized that there were no cups for coffee. My husband called the reception and he said even twice thwt we've needed empty cusp for coffee. Empty! In 5 minutes the guy brought us two cups with espresso.. I was even laughing!!!! Then the fish on the breakfast was kind of sprayed with the perfume... when the girl came to take it she fantasied that there was brand changing o the kitchen.. I asked her if they also changed the brand of the eggs which were served with the fish because they also smelled perume. Probably the staff has only training how to lie in a polite way. 
I'll not come back to this hotel and I'll never recommend it to anybody. This is not 5 star hotel. Service deserves no stars (exept the reception). Really pity that between so many 5 stars hotels in Barselona we've unfortunately chosen hotel Bagues....",1,2013,08,08
27,Excellent,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights, and enjoyed everything during our stay. The price was above our usual range, but as we had such a short stay we thought it was worth it. The location was perfect for a short city break, you could reach everything by foot. The noise of la Rambla worried us a bit beforehand, but it turned out that the windows were soundproof, and we didn't hear a thing, even though our room was facing the street. The staff was really nice, rooms were spotless, and there was everything you could ever need, including a small (there was only a threadmill, an exercise bike and some small weights) gym in the basement, and a lovely pool and a cocktail bar on the roof! We didn't have lunch or dinner, but the breakfast was nice.",5,2013,08,04
27,5 stars well deserveds,"My husband and I were roaming the Ramblas looking for somewhere to eat and he spotted the menu for the hotel restaurant! We were very impressed with the decor, the staff and of course the food! It's a small intimate dining room just off reception area, dimmed lighting and nice atmosphere; our order was taken and as the food was going to be a little while, we were given a selection of olives and some other nibbles. Having polished these off we were then surprised by a small glass of watermelon appetiser which was delicious; the main course of venison was superb, all washed down with a wonderful Spanish wine and then coffee and brandy. The service was so good but so quiet and unobtrusive and there when you needed without asking, giving us information about the food/wines. Excellent all round and we will go back on our next trip.",5,2013,07,30
27,"Amazing staff, boutique hotel located on La Ramblas!","My husband and I stayed in this amazing hotel for 3 nights. This hotel has everything you expect from 5 star hotel, very modern, elegant, the staff was amazing, very knowledgeable, always ready to help. We are very experienced travelers and stayed in nice hotels but  this one is the winner.
Our room was on the second floor with a balcony,facing La Ramblas ( the Main Street), we didn't hear any noise from the street despite the fact that this street was always very busy(people, cars, music).the room was very nicely decorated,  the bed was comfortable, bathroom was large and modern. It was very hot in Barcelona. At the beginning of our trip we stayed in the different hotel, but AC there didn't work properly and we moved to Bagues Hotel
AC was working fine in Bagues hotel, and our room was cool.
When we come to Barcelona we will definitely stay in this hotel. 
Thank again to wonderful people who work at Bagues!",5,2013,07,29
27,Worth the euro!,"Location, style, service are all here at this fantastic hotel.its a bit pricey, but you are right on las ramblas!  Rooftop bar is great as is breakfast.  It's wonderful modern and well equipped.  I requested a room not facing the Main Street and it was nice and quiet.  This is a five star that is worth it!",5,2013,07,27
27,Amazing staff,"We stayed a couple of nights to see the sites of the city. The hotel is perfectly located but the best part of the stay were the staff. They could not do enough for us. This included the staff on the front desk through to the cleaners. We really appreciated their willingness to help us with whatever we needed. Make sure when you book a room though, it has a view to the outside. We had a room that looked into the lobby which we did not realise when we booked online. The room was lovely but we would have paid extra for an upgrade had we known. Other than this, it was all perfect. Sleep quality wasn't great as there were other people staying on the same floor coming and going into each others room which was very annoying.",5,2013,07,24
27,five out of five,"This hotel has all what you would expect from a five-star, but it is actually the staff what makes it different from the other hotels. The staff is not merely friendly, but they do really care for you, naturally during your stay, but, in our case, also even well before we checked-in. This level of service and warmth is quite rare in these days. Hence, if you are planning a trip to Barcelona, I would warmly recommend Bagues as your hotel of choice.",5,2013,07,24
27,PERFECT just perfect,"Brilliant 5 star hotel in 5 star location in the centre of the unmissable Las Ramblas. Hotel excellent, spotless and very quiet inside despite being on the main shopping area of Barcelona. Staff very friendly and new you by name and could not do enough to make your stay as memorable as could be. The hotel has a rooftop pool but it is not a swimming pool but more of a plunge pool. It is a great place for a sundowner with magnificent views.
I would definitely recommend that you stay here.",5,2013,07,22
27,Absolutely perfect,"Yes, there could be a few small flaws here and there, but the staff's attitude and willingness to help in any way they can, makes up and exceeds your expectations.

In this hotel you are not a room number, you are truly a valued guest!

I will definitely be back!",5,2013,07,15
27,Exquisite Experience,"Our experience was out of this world! The hotel is very nice, but the staff is what made our stay memorable. Everyone was very hospitable and accommodated us in every way possible. I would recommend staying here if you are looking to be in the middle if all the action as its located in the center of Las Ramblas and is easy to walk anywhere. We'll be back for sure!",5,2013,07,13
27,Cute little boutique hotel,"Very cute hotel right on La Rambla.  If you can, book a room with a jacuzzi on the balcony - it is very cute and sweet.  Rooftop pool is tiny, so not worth using that.  But, the location is excellent. The staff is fabulous as well and very helpful.  Better than your run of the mill hotel.",4,2013,07,09
27,Nice small hotel with a very good location,"The hotel is very nice. Exellent locanion, friendly and helpful staff. Only two  comments: too soft mattress on the bed, air conditioning is very much in the restaurant. Rooms are not so big but nice and cosy.",4,2013,07,09
27,Nice decor but small rooms and quite expensive,"Great location and the décor is very modern but I think there was more emphasis on looks than practicality. The seals on the shower door were coming off and made an awful screeching noise when you slid the door shut and the sink is huge which looks cool but leaves NO bench space! As a result the cleaner must have knocked my makeup bag off the edge as the next day my favourite eye shadow case was broken. :( Also really weird but my brother in law was staying there as well and swears that they stole his toothpaste! Really random and we didn't believe him but we looked everywhere and couldn't find it! Not that we really cared, they probably knocked it into the bin and didn't realise or something but it meant we had to go searching for a supermarket for toothpaste! 

As I say, good location, great to be able to walk straight out onto Las Ramblas and very modern looks. The service was good, the guy who showed us the room was very nice and the staff were very helpful but overall was very expensive and a bit underwhelming, I still don't think I would stay there again.",3,2013,07,07
27,great location but not much else,"Step out the door right onto the top end of Las Ramblas or look down at the crowds below from the rooftop deck; a very well located spot.
However the rooms are very dark - ours looked into the internal quadrangle and the place has little character. Suggest you avoid.",3,2013,07,03
27,Beautiful hotel,"Excellent customer service and beautiful room.  Location cant be better, everything is right out the front door. Rooms are a little on the darker side but still lovely. Great for young couples visiting the city as a treat.",5,2013,07,02
27,Excellent Hotel,"Fabulous location on Las Rambla. Room was very nice. Loved the balcony overlooking the city and the windows were insulated so sound was not a problem.  Bathroom was well designed with a great shower amd partitioned toilet area.  Staff is great. Very friendly and helpful.  If you add the breakfast buffet you will be very happy that they will make fresh eggs for you and the rest of the food is really exceptional.  
Internet connection is weak and the ""business office"" is one computer in a dark lower level. 
Overall we spent three nights here and loved it.  Would stay again when we are in Barcelona",5,2013,07,01
27,"Great location, wonderful staff","My family and I stayed at Hotel Bagues for three nights in mid April.  We were greeted warmly when we arrived and while my family was taken upstairs to our promised, adjoining rooms, I remained downstairs with the concierge who not only happily made us dinner reservations for our three nights but who also tried valiantly to help me book tickets to see the Sagrada Familia.  The location was perfect, directly in the middle of Las Ramblas, and we were not disturbed by any noise at all.  The hotel itself was clean, trendy and calm.  I would stay here again.",5,2013,06,27
27,Excellent value on La Rambla,"Service was terrific, location was perfect, room was large by european standards and very nicely done, completely soundproof, modern bathroom with great shower. Only downside was internet connection was weak. Parking was a couple of blocks away, but to be expected in downtown Barcelona; wouldn't normally have a car, just happened to on this trip. Highly recommend.",5,2013,06,25
27,Run Away! This is NOT a 5* Hotel,"I booked the Jewel Suite which was advertised as a ""Spacious exclusive room with en-suite bathroom..."" and  ""have a private terrace with solarium and Jacuzzi."" The room they offered me was extremely tiny, barely larger than the bed, had a view of the toilet and shower from the bedroom, had no solarium, and did NOT resemble anything advertised. Management agreed with my assessment and offered me the adjacent single room for my daughter. We checked in, left for the afternoon, and upon our return we were informed they wanted to charge me for the adjacent single room they previously offered for free if it was available, but would include breakfast. I do not exaggerate when I say I requested a soft boiled egg 3 times at breakfast and they still could not produce one! Their excuse was the regular chef was out that week. This is NOT a 5* Hotel and they falsely advertised Room 603! The General Manager never even apologized when these issues were brought to his attention. He exemplified the poor service pervasive throughout the hotel. There are many great 5* Hotels in Barcelona for less than I paid and all of them can cook an egg and don't misrepresent their offerings. I have never written an on-line review but felt obligated if it would help just one traveler to Barcelona avoid this hotel. DO NOT stay here if you are expecting a good experience!",1,2013,06,21
27,perfect location,"hotel Bagues is located in the middle of the Ramblas. It is a very nice and trendy  boutique hotel. Everything on the hotel was positive: nice and clean room and bathroom.  Some people complain about the noisy room. We had a room with Ramblas vieuw on the second floor and it had a perfect isolation. No noise at all.
Only the breakfast was too expensive for the choise they offered.
I would certainly recommend this hotel .",5,2013,05,29
27,"Lovely, quaint, new hotel, immaculate, perfect location!","I read many other reviews prior to choosing this hotel. This Boutique hotel is brand new and on Le Ramblos right in the heart of it all. I entered the one morning to find the maid inside the shower scrubbing the walls. It was so so clean! Comfortable queen bed and linens. Soundproof room was wonderful! I read other reviews saying it was noisy, they must be part dog, as we could not hear much at all and have no hearing problems. Rooms are small, however we were very pleased with all else. One hint: the bathroom door is clear glass so for those who prefer privacy (like me), I simply hung one of my long wide scarves over the top of the door for privacy. I would not let this discourage your stay, just bring a scarf. The staff was fabulous and the HUGE food market is just around the corner! We walked easily to the port and opposite to the Cathedral, Picasso museum and wonderful shopping, quaint tapas bars and restaurants! Robes, hair dryers and restaurant all added to our pleasant stay! The fact that Rick Steves doesn't mention this hotel was a godsend as I imagine if he did, booking a room here would be impossible!",5,2013,05,28
27,A five star experience,We visited Barcelona for four nights in May 2013 and were recommended Hotel Bagues for its location and high levels of service and we were not disappointed. The standard of service was very high and the people on reception went out of their way to help with anything we needed. The location was perfect for exploring and there are plenty of restaurants close by. Will definitely go back to Bagues on my next trip.,5,2013,05,28
27,Rustyroos,"Truly amazing hotel...and incredible service...The staff just couldn't do too much for you..friendly..attentive and spoke perfect English...which was great as my Spanish is severely lacking!!!..
The hotels position on Las Ramblas is perfect for exploring the ""touristy"" bits of Barcelona plus the more authentic side streets...food market... as well as the port & beach areas..
The sun shone for our 3 day break so we enjoyed the fantastic roof bar.
Our room was fabulous...You really cant fault this brilliant hotel.,
Would go again tomorrow!!!",5,2013,05,28
27,Great location very pricey,"Nice staff, fabulous location on the Ramblas. Nice rooftop bar and ""pool"" is more like an empty koi pond.  nice to put your feet in.  Lots of great art work, very upscale hotel, trendy devor.  Rooms small but adequate.  and here are a few notes about comfort.  Do not get a Ramblas view because the building has two flood lights that are pointed directly at the building.  Makes enjoying the night ambiance impossible from your room.  Shower floods the floor if used at full throttle.  Beds incredibly hard.  Maids touched everything in our room, moved toiletries and everything on nightstand.  Use the safe, keep valuables with you.   I would not stay here again everything is overpriced.  ",5,2013,05,23
27,Everything 5 stars.,"This is our second visit to Barcelona and stayed again in Bagues Hotel. This is  the one of the best boutique hotels I stayed in Europe.
Staff  are very professional with personal touch.
Rooms very comfortable with unique decor.Would stay again!!!",5,2013,05,22
27,Great Convenience!,"Hotel Bagues offered great convenience to us during our 4 nights' stay in Barcelona.  Staff was very helpful and offered great suggestions on where to eat. 

The room and bathroom were very spacious and impeccably clean.  Lighting were well thought and placed.  Bed and pillows were very comfortable. 

Location was fantastic!  Nothing more that you could wish for.  You could walk to anywhere with a good pair of shoes.  We realized the best way to discover Barcelona is to walk.  Forget about the tour bus. 

Special mention bellman Evo who took good care of our luggage!",5,2013,05,20
27,"Great room, great location, great service!","We just returned from from Barcelona and loved the Hotel Bagues.  We stayed in Jewel Suite on the top floor with two balconies, one with a jacuzzi.  This is like no other hotel we've ever stayed in -- uniquely decorated, very quirky, but wonderfully comfortable.  The location is perfect if you like the bustle of the Rambla and it's less than a block from the Boqueria market.  But even more importantly is the service.  Everyone at this hotel does all they can to make your stay pleasant.  They also made great suggestions for places to eat so don't hesitate to ask.",5,2013,05,16
27,A wonderfull stay in an excellent hotel,"One of the best hotels I ever stayed in All over Europe, the price is at the level of service. The staff are all very professional starting from the door man, the hotel interior design and decoration is awesome, the only weakness point is the lack of varieties in the breakfast buffet.
I do recommend this nice boutique hotel to all of you for the value of money and service and the perfect location.",5,2013,05,14
27,Tops in Barcelona,"Hotel Bagues is an excellent hotel in a prime Barcelona location, La Rambla, close to Plaza de Catalunya, and only a few meters away from my two other favorite hotels in Barcelona, the Meridien and the 1898, which are also excellent. Rooms at Hotel Bagués are very clean, nicely furnished and very well equipped, as is also the bathroom. All staff were at all times extremely professional, helpful and friendly. Highly recommended.",5,2013,05,08
27,A wonderful experience!,"We just spent 3 glorious nights at the Hotel Bagues. First, let me point out that this is not the Ritz Carlton with cookie cutter rooms. This is a boutique hotel in Europe. The rooms are not going to be as spacious. The ""king"" beds are two twins pushed together. The rooms might not be completely sound proof (although I am a light sleeper and didn't hear anything from Las Ramblas 4 floors below) and there may not be outlets in the bathroom. Having said that, I have been to many 5 star hotels and the friendliness and service of the Bagues ""team"", as the front desk manager describes them, ranks up there with the best of them. A couple of examples: We went to la Sagrada Familia and the line to get in was wrapped around the block. We would have stood in line for hours. My daughter used her phone and we purchased tickets on line for a designated entry time later in the afternoon. We went back to the hotel to print the tickets and the website told us we had to go to a specific ATM to print them. We were at a loss. One of the gentleman at the front desk found someone to cover for him and took my daughter down the street to the correct ATM and helped her print the tickets. Another gentleman at the front desk tried to make reservations at a restaurant we requested and it was already booked for the evening. So he proceeded to make call after call to different restaurants that they recommended until they found us a table for the evening. And the meal was fantastic. Everyone from the doorman to the bartender always welcomed us with a big smile and a ""hola!""
The location of the hotel is fantastic. We were able to walk everywhere (yes, we walked to la Sagrada Familia....took a cab back!). Watching the sunset over Barcelona on the roof top bar was an added treat.
My one suggestion to the hotel would be, since I didn't find any outlets in the bathroom, it would be nice to have a mirror on the wall by the chaise lounge, so one could dry their hair and see what they were doing.
For a true, first class European experience, I would highly recommend the Hotel Bagues.",5,2013,05,08
27,Hotel Bagues is Awesome!,We loved our stay at Hotel Bagues.  It is located in a GREAT area next to the Gothic quarter of Barcelona.  The staff was super friendly and very accommodating.  We love the style and decor of the hotel.  We would definitely stay here again.  Muchas Gracias Hotel Bagues!,5,2013,05,07
27,enjoyable stay,"This hotel had a very friendly staff, excellent location, and beautiful architecture.  We enjoyed our Jewel suite with an open terrace overlooking La Rambla.  The staff were always happy to help make and confirm reservations. There is ambient noise that comes with this central location, but it did not disturb our sleep.  We would recommend this hotel for couples looking to explore a more authentic experience of Barcelona.",5,2013,05,04
27,some room for improvement,"The hotel is beautifully designed and the room was imaculate and very comfortable. We could not fault the staff for their warm welcome and friendliness throughout the stay. The location is fantastic, right on la rambla in the heart of Barcelona making it easy to walk just about everywhere or to hop on the metro (the nearest stop was 100m up the road). 

However we expected more, the hotel advertises itself as completly soundproof - this is not the case. We could hear noises from the street - which we did expect given the location - but we could also hear those in the room above and any noise in the lobby/restaurant travelled up the light well and could be heard clearly. 

We did not use the restaurant as it seemed to lack atmosphere and did not appear particularly inviting - there were better options locally. Breakfast wasn't included in the price and was 23euros pp, we felt this was very pricey and so we used local cafes or the market. 

The last negative is small one, although the bathroom was wonderfully decorated the lighting was very poor for applying make up etc. and there was no mirror in the main room.",4,2013,04,21
27,A huge disappointment,"We had expected 5-star service in this hotel, and it fell short in nearly every category. This is a hotel where if you were to walk through it and quickly glance at everything, you'd be incredibly impressed with the decor, facility, and style. However, when you are actually a guest at this hotel, all of the issues come through loud and clear.

The rooms are billed to be ""noise-proof,"" but that is not the case at all. The location is on La Rambla which is great if you don't mind the noise from La Rambla while you're trying to sleep, but we found that the rooms let through street noise which was a huge distraction. We also saw a lot of discrepancies between rooms. One room had robes, another didn't-in one room there was excellent closet space, in another it was almost non-existent. No, I don't want all rooms to be carbon copies of one another, but the changes in the room were pretty noticeable, and made me feel cheated on certain things.

The staff was nice at first, but the longer we were there, the more annoyed they seemed to be when we asked for things. We talked with them about booking a few tours, but when we went to actually book the tours, the prices seemed to sky rocket overnight. I can't make sense of that. There were a few helpful people-namely the bellman who checked us in, but overall I think they could use some help in their customer service skills.

I couldn't recommend this hotel, and feel as though my money was wasted. What a shame, as the facility is beautiful.",2,2013,04,21
27,GOOD BUT LACKING,"We were overall happy with our stay but equally disappointed in some aspects. Our Jewel Suite had a suite price but was not a suite by any definition and the internet was slow, inconvenient and difficult to use. Parking was a challenge. Some of the promised features like a iPod dock and the ""solarium"" were notably absent. Promised newspapers were not delivered and there was no ""welcome gift"" in the room, although a 500ml bottle of wine was there for our second night.
On the plus side staff were very helpful, courteous and friendly; the architecture beautiful, striking and unique; breakfast was diverse, fresh and satisfying and its location on La Rambla was ultra-convenient and easy to navigate to. We had no real issues with noise but enjoyed the benefit of a wall outside our sliding doors to the enclosed balcony.",4,2013,04,21
27,Overpromises,"Hotel Bagues makes much of being a top-tier hotel, but we found that it didn't deliver on its most important promises.  

Bagues prominently advertises that its rooms are ""completely soundproof.""  Given that most rooms overlook La Rambla, which is noisy pretty much 24/7, this is a big deal.  Unfortunately, it's not true.  With the balcony doors completely closed and sealed, the exterior noiseproofing is good.  But we were put in two rooms where the doors wouldn't seal all the way, letting an annoying amount of noise in (enough that we couldn't sleep even with earplugs).  Rather than attempting to fix the issue, the front desk just kept moving us.  We finally wound up in an interior room without exterior noise problems.  Even then, there was essentially no interior noiseproofing.  We could easily hear every time somebody used the elevator, opened their door, talked in the hallway, etc.

Bagues also advertises free wifi.  This is only partially true.  They provide a 24-hour access card for a single device (if you want to use more than a single device, you have to pay more).  You have to go to the front desk every 24 hours to get a new card, a la Oliver Twist.  The internet was often so slow that pages wouldn't load.

The other features you'd expect to see in a ""5 star"" hotel weren't present.  Showers leaked, king beds were made of two twins pushed together, and the fitness center was a bad joke.  There was no separate concierge desk, only the front desk, and we had very mixed experiences.  Some front desk staff weren't able to answer our questions, and others provided bad information (including a city tour that mysteriously went up €120 when we tried to book it).

On the plus side, the building itself is gorgeous and built with high-end materials, and most staff were pretty friendly.  I cannot recommend the hotel, though.  I would recommend staying somewhere else on La Rambla or, even better, somewhere in Eixample that is easy walking distance to the Gothic Quarter.",2,2013,04,18
27,"Definitely 5* Hotel, Location and Service.","This is a hotel we would definitely recommend to anyone staying in Barcelona, from the moment we arrived the service was excellent, we were there to celebrate my partners 50th Birthday so I did email the manager to inform him it was a Special occasion, and on arriving back to our room after a short walk of the area, room service arrived with a complimentary bottle of cava and a note from the manager inviting us to another complimentary drink in the hotel bar. The hotel is in a great location, in the middle of the very busy La Ramblas, our room had a small balcony which was great to have a drink and people watch. This is a noisy road, but the sound proofing of our room was very good. We stayed for four days on a bed and breakfast basis and had one evening meal in the restaurant, the quality of the food and the service was excellent. When we go back to Barcelona we will definitely stay at Hotel Bagues again, and we can't recommend this hotel highly enough.

27,Nice location - bit thin on facilities,"Perfect location and very friendly staff.  At that price though I really expect a small fridge in the room and a kettle to make tea/coffee.  There wasn't even space for a chair or table to work at - when people say the room was TINY they are not exaggerating. 
Dinner was good but expensive. Breakfast at €21+VAT seemed rather pricey and was ""limited"".  
We enjoyed our stay but not sure we will stay there again - it didn't really feel like value for money.",3,2013,04,16
27,excellent hotel,"one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in, most amazing experience
excellent location, excellent decor, extremely friendly and helpful staff
despite the fact that the hotel is on la rambla, it was very quiet at night 
I would strongly recommend it",5,2013,04,14
27,Brilliant Bagues,"Just come back from a 4 night stay, fantastic location, room small but perfectly equipped. Bagues is centrally located so everywhere is easily accessible, the market is 60 yards away and the array of quality produce and goods is worth visiting Barcelona for alone, check out the fruit juices. The atmosphere from La Rambla is intoxicating and opening the balcony door and letting it flood into the room was priceless and if that's not your cup of tea just shut the door and it goes away to a more than acceptable level. Friendly and helpful staff act as tour guide, translators, tips of the day ..oh and provide everything you require, with minimum fuss. In summary use this hotel as your base for a sightseeing holiday and from my experience you want go far wrong!...Enjoy",5,2013,04,13
27,Perfect Central Location,"I was visiting Barcelona on Business but wanted a central Hotel hotel to experience some of the flavour of Barcelona. I was very satisfied with my choice. The central location is difficult to beat and is very close to Liceu Metro station.
Very pleasant small hotel with very friendly helpful staff. Breakfast was more about presentation than content, but prefectly good. Rooms are on the small side but well equipped and very comfortable with reliable air conditioning. No noise from the street but slight vibration from the metro trains (felt on the 5th floor)  which did not disturb.Overall recomended.",4,2013,04,11
27,It's all about location,"Just returned from 2 nights in Bagues Hotel and was very happy altogether.Yes the breakfast was a little pricey but all fresh locally sourced ingredients and freshly cooked for you on request.
All staff very courteous and helpful, giving travel advice and booking restauraunts.
5 minute walk up to Plaza Catalunya for bus transfers to and from airport, very easy.Rooms tastefully decorated.
All in all, 5 star hotel? Imo not quite but definitley value for money and location the best!",4,2013,04,10
27,Location great,"This small hotel is very well located in the middle of the Ramblas in Barcelona, we had a ordinary
room with a tiny balcony overlooking the rambles, the room adequate in size, had everything you could want. the bathroom(shower only) but very tastefully decorated, no noise from the street during the night. Staff very helpful, breakfast I found was very good plenty to be had, and different varieties choice for everyone.  The top terrace overlooking the city was interesting.
The only problem (and not one the hotel can deal with) is the tube which seems to run under the hotel, but then all the hotels in the ramblas have the same problem. 
Security very good in my opinion.  Not a cheap hotel but we enjoyed ourselves.",5,2013,04,09
27,Location excellent/Jewel suite a must/Breakfast poor/Room service poor,Firstly it is worth paying extra for jewel suite - do not think too hard about price just book it - the pleasure that comes from sitting in the jacuzzi with champagne listing to the bustling La Rambla down below is priceless.  Rooms are small but tastefully decorated and have nearly everything you need.  Breakfast was very disappointing - we felt that we had to ask for everything.  Only a small selection of each item of food was put out and obviously went quite quickly - food was then not replenished we had to constantly keep asking for things.  We were here for 3 days and was same for each day.  We arrived at about 5.30pm and although we were shown to our room immediately we had a visit within minutes for a house maid to sort some things in our room which were not quite ready.  Rubbish was not taken away daily nor were dirty glasses taken away and no bin to put rubbish in so had to put rubbish in carrier bag which was not taken away.  On last night bath robes were taken away and not replaced with clean ones - this spoilt our enjoyment of jacuzzi somewhat as we had nothing to slip into as it was very cold outside.  We asked for replacements and just got more towels!  For a 5 star hotel with private jacuzzi we would have thought we would have at least got bathrobes and a good breakfast.,3,2013,04,08
27,Great position,Really good hotel in a perfect position for walking to all the main sights or getting on the tour bus. Lovely rooms and nice sun terrace right at the top of the hotel overlooking the city with a small splash pool and sun chairs. The breakfast was lovely and very fresh and the best orange juice you'll ever drink! kids love the jars of free sweets in the lobby! Expensive hotel but well worth paying the extra.,4,2013,04,08
27,A great place to stay if slightly quirky,"Took one of the Jewel suites, a good size room with a proper bathroom and, brilliantly, a private terrace with your own jacuzzi.

Breakfast expensive (the special offer was €15 each, against the normal €26).

Room service and cleaning first class.

Right on Las Ramblas bur on security issues, full time doorman and reception.

Expensive, but worth it.",5,2013,04,07
27,"""Ideal location, but......""","Hotel Bagues is an updated boutique, trendy hotel that can be an excellent choice if you want to be in the middle of the energetic streets of the Les Rambles district. If money is not an issue and you aren't traveling with children than this is the perfect hotel for you, with the location that will meet all your shopping and restaurant desires.  All the classy amenities of this upscale hotel (each with a balcony overlooking Les Rambles street) is at your fingertips.  

For the price of a standard room, don't expect a big room, or some other features such as a fan in the bathroom or a full length mirror.  Also, you may want to avoid the breakfast because the food is way below premium standards and a private transfer from the airport is ridiculously over-priced.

In conclusion, the somewhat friendly staff needs a lot of training when it comes to recommendations and manners when dealing with guests. If you do decide to make a reservation at hotel Bagues, here are the 3 prerequisites I suggest before booking here. 1) you are a middle age to older couple not traveling with children 2) have money to burn 3) want a perfect location for a Barcelona excursion.",2,2013,03,30
27,Perfect Location,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights mid March for a birthday celebration. We certainly made a wise choice. The position of the Hotel on the Rambla could not be better, being halfway between the Port and the main shopping area, near to the Cathederal and the Gothic area, with the Baqueria market a couple of minutes away. The room was comfortable, clean and of a good size.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is very modern inside and of a boutique style.  It also has a roof terrace and bar, and even at that time of year it was nice to admire the view over the city.

I would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends and family.",5,2013,03,26
27,The location is excellent,"We stayed at Hotel Bagues March 7 and 8.  We had booked Hotel Bagues on the recommendation of Hotel DO Placa Reial which was booked. We were travelling with another couple who decided to stay at Le Meridien which is only a block and a half away.  We could have stayed at Le Meridien with our Starwoods points but decided we didn't want the business man's type of hotel: we wanted boutique.  Hotel Bagues is definitely boutique and it's beautiful and clean and the staff very nice.  I can't give it 5 stars for a few reasons: mostly my own fault/expectations.  Our room was TINY;  I should have asked for an upgrade but I was tired and stressed....We had two large suitcases which took up the entire leather couch that was in the room....no where else to put the luggage.  It was a full size bed, not a king: not used to that in a 5 star.  I'm very tall but I thought oh it's only two nights.....The bathroom is beautiful and well stocked with amenities and towels/robes etc BUT there isn't a soap dish in the shower....there is ""design"" but function should play at least a small role!  This was the 3rd 4/5 star hotel we had stayed in on our trip to Spain.  2 of the 3 had glass doors on the bathrooms....Americans aren't used to that!  The other observation I have, based on the 3 hotels we stayed in: no coffee/tea making in any of the rooms!  I miss that, to be honest. I ordered coffee for two from room service early one morning and they literally brought two cups of coffee. I was expecting a pot of coffee and a pot of milk. Again: my mistake/expectations.  They, of course, immediately brought more and only charged me about 7euro.  Breakfast was not included which is normal for the city.  It's almost always included in the countryside though.   Hotel Bagues is practically next door to Le Boqueria which really is one of the best markets in the world. 
La Rambla is interesting but I probably wouldn't need to stay there again.  Placa Reial was beautiful and would probably try to stay there next time.  The rooms at the Hotel Bagues are exactly as they appear on the website but the standard room is really only suited for a single or very small couple.  I just didn't feel that they were trying to ""out do"" themselves which is, again, my expectation of a 5 star.",4,2013,03,26
27,The place to stay in Barcelona,"Hotel Bagues is located in the heart of Barcelona on La Rambla, the location is magnificent.
The staff went out of their way to assist us, giving recommendations, doing reservations and being very very helpful.  This is not to be taken lightly and should be highly appreciated as the staff dedication, commitment and professionalism is what made our 2 nights in Barcelona into a great and fun trip.
The room we had was very nice with a view to the La Rambla.  The breakfast was very good and the breakfast staff were really nice and gave us a great feeling.
All in all it was a very nice stay and we are planning to return.

27,"Lovely, understated elegant hotel.","Great location.  Lovely to be able to open the balcony doors and and watch La Rambla come to life each morning.  No problem with nosie at night.
Comfy bed.  Great shower. Lots of nice extra touches such as a note with the next day's weather forecast and sweets you could help yourself to in reception.
Great roof top bar and pool area. We stayed in March so couldn't really appreciate it but lovely if you stay in summer.
Polite, helpful, friendly staff.
Darkened glass bathroom door initially a little disconcerting but you don't really notice it after awhile.
Would definately recommend Hotel Bagues.",5,2013,03,22
27,Trendy at Bagues,"Hotel Bagues is located on La Rambla, so the location was absolutely perfect! So was the staff, so service minded and always smiling. We stayed in a Jewel Suite, and had some problems with sewage smell from the jacuzzi located on the terrace, and got moved to another suite one as soon as we made the staff aware of the problem. And the morning after we got a lovely Rioja wine with a personal apology. 

I was very happy with my stay at the Bagues!",5,2013,03,18
27,"Perfect location, nice room with terrace and outside jacuzzi","Located on the Rambla, close to the Liceu Opera, 5 mionutes from Plaza Catalunya on the left and the harbour on the right, an ideal setting for both tourism and shopping. The street outside is noisy, but the rooms are well sound-proofed. Mine, on the top floor, had a beautiful terrace with outside jacuzzi. The only slight problem is the see-through doors and windows of the bathroom _ a little problematic if you like intimacy, Otherwise, nice breakfast, very pleasant service.",4,2013,03,15
27,Barcelona holiday 2013,Hotel in superb position. Cannot belive anybody can hear street noise was totally silent when balcony door shut. Breakfast now includes bacon egg and sausage which was very tasty.Staff excellent and would recommend to anybody looking to stay in Barcelona.,5,2013,03,11
27,An absolute dream,"Just got back from an amazing three nights at Hotel Bagues.  Everything about the hotel was spot on; the happy staff, the room, the breakfast, the fantastic soft bed linen, the slate in the bathroom...I could go on.  I totally recommend eating in their restaurant, El Regulador - the staff certainly know their onions!  It was my birthday while we were there and I wish now we'd eaten there on the night of my birthday as well as the night before - fabulous food.  No need to worry about the noisy Ramblas as you can't hear a thing so had three good night sleeps.  I was sad to leave.",5,2013,03,05
27,Great stay!,"Whenever I stay in a new city, I always keep my eyes open for a different hotel that may have been a better choice.  After five days in Barcelona, I concluded that the Hotel Bagues is the perfect place to stay every time!  Las Ramblas is a busy, mostly pedestrian street, so there was a lot of bustle, but the kind you want out the window when experiencing a great city.  Plus the windows/doors were very efficient at keeping the noise outside when not wanted.  The staff was very professional, friendly, and attentive.  The interesting Gothic neighborhood is very near, and we found great restaurants in its side alleys.  The waterfront is also near, and the paella options (and sangria de cava) are many.  We even walked to the Sagrada Familia for the requisite sightsee, though it may be too far for some (don't miss it!).  And if you like antiques, great shops are also nearby.  The rooms are not huge, but I appreciated my balcony.  I was less impressed with the decor than other reviewers, but if you like a lot of black and brown, you will be happy.  Very clean, consistent wifi, a rooftop balcony that would be a lot of fun in warmer months, and even a very basic gym (pretty much just light weights).  I recommend this hotel highly!",5,2013,02,26
27,Thé place to be,"From thé second you push the door of the Bagues hotel, you feel that it will be a wonderful experience. Courteous and attentive staff, design, intimate atmosphere.  Rooms have a subtle mix of traditional and modern decoration and are very functional and comfortable at the same time. Room service is prompt with good quality. Hotel location is excellent, being at walking distance of many points of interest of the city. We will return there in spring or summer to enjoy the roof top with its  bar and the small but cosy pool.",5,2013,02,23
27,Perfect location and amazing interior design,"This a beautiful romantic couples hotel. I would not bring children. It is in a perfect location on the Rambla for walking in all directions. The hotel restaurant is very good, Star Bucks to your right in half a block, famous market place to your right in half a block and many tapas restaurants as you walk in the area behind the hotel and also in the Gothic Quarter area straight away out the front entrance. 

From here we walked to the harbor, to the Picasso Museum and to all the Gaudi structures, although the Segrada Familia was the farthest walk and it was very cold so we took a taxi back. 

We had a room, 205, facing the Rambla, and when you close the balcony door it is amazingly quiet. The sound proofing for the hotel is fantastic. Okay, like ALL hotels in large cities (NYC too) the room is small, but elegant, the fitness is not much and the bed is on the hard side, so get over it. It is a beautiful boutique hotel with a wonderful staff. When we had trouble with our wifi, the general manager gave us a high speed upgrade. This hotel will provide all the service that is requested or needed. 

The roof top pool and bar are spectacular, but as we stayed in the cold of winter, we could only enjoy the view.",5,2013,02,17
27,Nice and good position,"Nice hotel with very sympatic staff. The rooms are cosy but small. nice deco. Very central to explore the old Barcelona by foot. Lots of good restaurants close by. If you go by car, they dont have a own parking and parking close by is difficult and expensive. ",5,2013,02,14
27,Great location and boutique hotel,"Great boutique hotel in a great location.  Rooms on the small side but very chic and comfortable.  Food was great, especially at dinner and amazingly cosy and trendy rooftop bar.  Definitely recommended.  Helpful staff.",5,2013,01,05
27,Mix feeling,"Great location if you want to be on the Ramblas... but noisy all night...  Well decorated room, great balcony but  the room is quite small for a suite..The employees are very friendly, helpful and courteous.",4,2013,01,04
27,A jewel in Barcelona,"First and foremost the location is ideal, the staff is wonderful, friendly and extremely helpful. I would recommend this property to anyone that wants to experience Barcelona and it's culture. The property itself is beautiful and part of the charm is that there are only 31 luxurious  rooms, we stayed on a corner room and it was perfect and spacious when comparing other european rooms. We only stayed 3 nights over the Christmas weekend, wish we could stayed longer. The staff truly seems to enjoy working there. We will be back!",5,2012,12,29
27,Amazing experience,"The hotel is superbly located with wonderful well decorated rooms.A truly luxury boutique hotel. I
 got a deal as We booked early.The staff is friendly,helpful,accommodating and courteous.We wished to stay longer and know where to book for the next trip to Barcelona.",5,2012,12,25
27,Great location & lavish rooms,"Simply amazing. You would want to spend more time in the hotel. I love the view outside, and also the interiors of my room. Almost all amenities are provided and special needs if any, are taken care of. I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2012,12,21
27,Good location 2min walk to la bukaria market with very good service,"Good location 2min walk to la bukaria market with very good service

I don't like the door in the bathrooms 
Wen u have 2 children 16 -13 boy end girl
Is not so good!",5,2012,12,15
27,"Excellent boutique hotel in the heart of the old Town, Barcelona","We enjoyed superb service with a smile throughout our stay at the hotel.  The staff were knowledgeable, attentive and assisted with all our needs.  They even volunteered to go the extra mile by accompanying us to the nearby ATM to collect tickets we had booked and paid for online.  There was free Wi-Fi which was a big plus in an European city.  The rooms were kept clean and tidy throughout.  Even though we were in the heart of La Rambla, the rooms were well insulated and sound proof.  All in all, a wonderful experience to accompany the beauty, warmth and excitement of Barcelona.  Ole!!!!",5,2012,12,12
27,Solid Choice,"If this is your first, or fifth, visit to beautiful Barcelona, then you cannot go wrong with the Hotel Bagues.  I stayed here recently for my second visit to Barcelona, my wife's first, and we wished we could have stayed much longer!

The rooms, bed, and daybed were very comfortable, we spelt great every night.  The rooms were also large by Europeans standards - including the closets and bathroom.  The hotel itself was very modern and sexy on the inside: the colors, the lighting, etc.  It was perfect for my wife and me, perfect for couples - maybe not so much for families with young children?  The hotel was beautiful on the outside as well, I could not tell you how old that building was but it was just beautiful.

There was a small balcony on our room which you could step out onto to overlook the rush of La Rambla.  However, when you closed the balcony window, they must have really sound-proofed the rooms, because you could not hear the hustle and bustle of the streets anymore.  You could not hear the rooms next to you either, something that cannot be said for many other hotels.  Prior to staying at the Hotel Bagues, we stayed at another hotel in Madrid, which was not sound-proofed and where you could hear the street noise even with the windows closed.

Also, location, location, location.  The Hotel Bagues was right on La Rambla, perfect for a ""let's put our shoes back on and go get some xocolate and xurros"" run.  Not a far walk to the sea/La Rambla del Mar, to the Plaza de Catalunya, or to the very cool and hip neighborhood of El Born.  And for when you want to get further away from La Rambla, close by to the Metro stops.  When we got tired of taxis and something was too far to walk, I asked the friendly staff for Metro instructions.  They were more than helpful, and gave us perfect directions on where to transfer, etc. to get to our destination.  The staff never appeared put off by my questions, but rather were very welcoming and professional.

The front desk management and staff, overall, were very kind and courteous.  In fact, they went above and beyond, in my opinion, to offer my wife and I the most pleasant stay possible.  Prior to departing the States to Spain, I had purchased some tickets to a Barcelona football match, and when I encountered some problems printing them from the La Caixa machines, the front desk manager Ms. Saaikan made a phonecall for us, and also sent a kind young man by the name of Aritz with my wife and I to help us with our problem with the La Caixa machine.

The staff all seemed to speak English very well, though my wife and I preferred to speak Spanish with them instead.

We used their computer/internet/printer on multiple occasions (free), which was very convenient.  We only wish we could have spent more time on the rooftop balcony of the hotel, which has an amazing view of the city, especially at night.  We went in November, and so the balcony hours were a bit shorter and the daylight much less than in the spring or summer months, and so if you are going during those months their rooftop balcony (with bar, tables, and a small pool) would be a great idea for you.

Clean, comfortable, convenient, and ""cool"" is how my wife and I would describe the Hotel Bagues.",5,2012,12,10
27,"Good location, very pricey! Make sure you don't mind your companion looking into the bathroom through the mirrored door!","This was very expensive for the room. Admittedly, it had a very nice roof terrace overlooking  the pickpockets of Las Ramblas with a miniscule pool, which was nicely lit at night. The free cocktail was a literal knockout. I can highly recommend ""the vodka  bramble"". The area is well placed for el Gotic and you can just get lost and wander for hours. We bought a kettle as we wanted a cuppa at the end of a hard days night and there were no tea and coffee facilities. They did do a ridiculous folding-down-the-bed thing at night though where the chocolate elf put a nice choccy on your pillow. I'm afarid I would rather have the tea fairy. The food market is next door so you can have a lovely fresh breakfast on the cheap. There was free entry to the Egyptian museum, which was worth a look,  especially if followed by a drink at the rooftop terrace bar of hotel Omm round the corner (which overlooks a floodlit la Casa Mila) and maybe a pinxo or 3 at tapas 24. The room was a reasonable size but while watching the tv on the leather seat you had a nice view of the bidet through the glass bathroom door! The shower was mahussive and the decor was sleek black slate. Low lighting was trendy but meant I looked like a drag queen for the evening. Watch out on Rambla Del Raval where the real drag queen / prostitutes and pimps hang out. Don't let that put you off the area though as there are some top notch bars there.",4,2012,12,04
27,Good choice,"This is my second time in this hotel and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay again.
My room looked out over the Ramblas and opening the bay windows allowed me to be on the narrow balcony soaking up the atmosphere. With the windows closed the room was really quiet - you could change between being part of the Barcelona atmosphere or being quiet in your room.
The service was excellent and the staff very friendly.
The only downside is that you have to pay for the WIFI (although the cable connection is free) and that every time you re-connect you have re-enter the codes. A little frustrating and I think that the WIFI should really be free of charge.
However this should not stop you going to the hotel and I will be back for my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2012,11,30
27,"Great hotel choice - location, ambiance, friendly staff, value","We really felt we made a great choice in choosing the Hotel Bagues for our five nights in Barcelona!  The location is ideally situated - every destination we were interested in was just a quick walk away.  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful - greeting us every time we entered the lobby, giving us advice on making the best of our trip, and genuinely being interested in our Barcelona experience. The hotel is very new and modern, and the room decor had a 'boutique' flair. Loved the balcony overlooking the church, the leather chaise, the stone walls, bedding and bath amenities (it took us a couple of days to get used to the glass bathroom door :o)! The rooftop bar/deck was a great place to relax and offered panoramic views of the city.  Previous reviews had complained about Internet access, but 90 continuous minutes per day was adequate for us, and the there is a free, desktop computer available in their lower level business center.  We would definitely return and recommend Hotel Bagues to others!",5,2012,11,22
27,Fabulous Hotel,"We spent 3 nights at Hotel Bagues to celebrate our wedding anniversary and had a fantastic time. Our room was deluxe suite on the fifth floor with views of both La Rambla and the Church (it was a corner room). The room was immaculate and the bed extremely comfortable.  As previous contributors have mentioned the sound proof was fantastic and completely blocked out the hustle and bustle of the street. The location of the hotel makes it ideal for sight seeing and its an added bonus to be right beside the Boqueria market!! We ate in the hotel restaurant (El Regulador) and found both the food and service to be excellent. Definitely try the taster menu, everything on it was delicious. The staff were exceptional and I can not praise them highly enough. I would recommend Hotel Bagues to anyone, you will be guaranteed a good time!",5,2012,11,13
27,A Wonderful Experience,"Having returned from a 5 night stay at the Hotel Bagues in Barcelona I would absolutely stay there again.  The hotel is in an ideal location on La Rambla and is within walking distance of a lot of the sights such as the port, the market and Placa de Catalunya. The hotel is a wonderful size and the decor and layout is ideal.
Given we arrived on a mid morning flight into Barcelona our room was not ready when we arrived ( check in is 2pm -  I knew this would be the case and had not expected it to be ready and did not mind) however the check in staff took all our bags and coats and did some paperwork with us so check in would be easier later on.  Then we were free to explore and enjoy the area.

When we did check in our bags has been placed in our room and a staff member showed us how the TV, air conditioning worked and explained the hotel facilities etc.  We had a room on the 4th floor with views over La Rambla and it was beautiful.  The room was a good size (plenty of space to store the suitcases) with wonderful decor, beds were so comfortable and the bathroom was a good size too with a great shower and bath.  Rooms are also turned down each night and they leave a little chocolate and a summary of the next days weather forecast for each guest, which is a lovely touch.  The rooms are all sound proofed so once you close the windows you hear no noise from outside

There is a lovely terrace on the 7th floor with a small pool with wonderful views of the surrounding area and the church next door.  Nice for a relaxing drink or cup of coffee.  In the hotter summer months I believe it would be even nicer.
We also used the restaurant in the hotel twice for dinner and it was one of the nicest dinners I have even eaten.  The staff were lovely and could not do enough for us, they explained each dish in detail, recommended dishes etc.  The food was so tasty, (I had the ox and it was melt in the mouth) and cooked to perfection so the chef deserves great praise.  I would urge anyone using the hotel to eat there if possible.  

Overall I cannot praise all the hotel staff enough as they are they best I have ever encountered. They could not do enough for you and they recommended some lovely restaurants to try around the area and gave directions to places we wanted to go.  I cannot wait to return to the Hotel Bagues and Barcelona.",5,2012,11,12
27,Great boutique hotel,Absolutely great place.  We arrived in Barcelona after a cruise and then could not leave because of a storm back in the US and ended up staying for 4 days until we could get a flight.  We found the hotel online.  It is located in a great place on La Rambla next to the market.  We could get everywhere by foot.  The hotel staff was the best I have ever encountered in any hotel.  They could not do enough for us.  We asked for early check in arriving in the morning and had a room in 20 minutes.  Their recommendations for anything we asked were always spot on and absolutely what we wanted.  I would absolutely stay here again.,5,2012,11,10
27,"Great service , great location and decor","we stayed at the Hotel,Bagues for 3 nights. After arriving at 9am we were welcomed with coffees and apologies for the room not being available. The service during during our entire stay was awesome - nothing was too much trouble and small things were often offered as complimentary.  Eg .when we needed to leave early on the last day were offered complimentary coffees for our wake up

The location is fantastic - in the middle of La Rambla, and close to most things. Rooms and decor were very attractive, and we enjoyed the calming atmosphere of the restaurant which faces into La Rambla. On the downside, the rooms are small and there is no desk for doing any work.

Congratulations to the management and staff - your service approach is fantastic. After 2 months holiday in luxury hotels this is our favourite! ",5,2012,11,08
27,"Perfect Location, Great Staff,","Positives:  1) Great Staff!  Truly exceptional as they were very accommodating and always eager to help.  2) Perfect location if you are a tourist with many of Barcelona's best sites within walking distance . . . also a great food market is nearby as well as plenty of restaurants.      
3) The bedroom was well appointed and the beds itself was comfortable even though it was obviously two bed put together 
            
Neutral:     1) The noise.  While it is on Ramblas, the noise from the street is minimal.  However, evidently the hotel is over the subway and periodically one can hear it as well as feel a small shake.  I'm sure most would not notice the latter much or even if they did, it would not be that bothersome.  
                  
Negative:   1) The rooms are too small for my liking.  The staff was kind of enough to offer us two others, but they were only marginally bigger than the one we had and none could comfortable fit the 3 suitcases we had with us. 2) The bathroom was also too small and the design a bit awkward (I kept stepping on the damn door stopper!) and 3) The doorman:  Even though I showed the hotel my train reservation--they even arranged for our driver--he evidently told the driver to send us to the wrong station . . . luckily we had enough time to get to the right one . . . but we could have missed our all night train which would have been a major problem.    

Overall I would say this was still a very nice hotel and I would recommend it.",4,2012,11,06
27,A Wonderful Experience,"A great hotel, great location, quite expensive but worth it in my opinion,helpful staff, would recommend. We went there for a short mid week break and it delivered everything that we wanted, 10 minutes walk to the harbour and 5 minutes to the main attractions.",5,2012,11,03
27,Just right,"The hotel is in a really good spot, really quiet despite being right on Ramblas, near the extremely charming gothic quarter, close to amazing restaurants and we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go- this time. We will stay here again as it has everything that you could want in a hotel of this type and price  - lovely rooms with great bathrooms, wonderful staff and having a drink on the roof in the pool was something else at the end of a long day of being out and about. I had the best and the worst mojito ever there- make sure they have limes, not just lime juice, before you order. The fitness centre is a bit Spartan and it was closed when I wanted to use it. They were offering a deal on breakfast- we didnt take them up on it. It was a fairly regular type of offering, and we did enjoy it once. We preferred to hit the street and eat in the smaller local menu restaurants. Ask the staff to recommend restaurants- we tried to find places ourselves, with limited success, but the two they recommended were stunning.",5,2012,11,01
27,Great Hotel and location,"This is a lovely hotel with very friendly and attentive staff.  Great Doorman always smiling and friendly.  Location is great, almost next door to the market and lots of restaurants within easy walking distance.  Rooms were immaculate, not overly large but fine, beds comfortable with nice linens.  Lovely views of Barcelona from the roof top, however the pool is only a lap pool.  Would definitely recommend and would stay there again.",5,2012,10,23
27,Great location small  boutique hotel,"It is in a great location on the Ramblas so we were a short walk to most places. The hotel was a small but well designed hotel with nice touches. Comfortable bed, unusual design fetires and I can't fault the place, all the staff were attentive and professional quick to help advise or respond. I would definately stay again ",5,2012,10,17
27,"Wonderful Honeymoon, Fantastic Hotel","We booked this 3 night break through the hotels own website and found this to be the best deal. We had a Jewel Suite which was on the 6th Floor. On arrival we were warmly greeted, the staff extremely helpful, we were shown our room and how everything worked. The room was beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean and the bathroom was fitted with top quality fittings. The toiletries/robes/beds all lovely.
The Jewel Suites have a wonderful outdoor terrace with table/chairs, day bed and jacuzzi for two, with oils & salts provided. This made our stay very special, it was wonderful to return to after a long morning sight seeing.You can look down on the hustle & bustle of La Rambla which never stops, but once you have closed the sliding doors the room falls silent and is a peaceful calm haven.
I cannot praise the staff enough, they speak English better than I speak Spanish, the turn down service is excellent, if it's not convenient at around 7pm they are happy to return later while you are out. You will return to find the bathroom spotless once again, slippers out and chocolate and weather forcast for the next day.Whilst there are no tea/coffee facilities in the room the room service for coffee is instant and its about €7 for 2 coffees which for the type of hotel we thought reasonable. The minibar is also well stocked and fairly priced. On return to our room the first evening we were welcomed with an ice bucket, 2 glasses and lovely bottle of Cava, our friends were given Rioja. The next day as we had only drunk half of it the staff replenished the ice bucket again and fresh glasses, very thoughtful.
We didn't eat in the hotel, the breakfast though looked lovely but even the special offer €16 was a little pricey. The restaurant is in the foyer and seems a little quiet. The roof terrace was again lovely but also quiet but perhaps it was just the time of year.
We couldn't fault the service we received and felt the price we paid was very reasonable compared to other hotels of its quality.
We will definitely return to Barcelona and would most certainly stay in Hotel Bagues again.",5,2012,10,12
27,Short break visit.,"Generally a good hotel - but at a price!
Good
1. Position - right on La Rambla

3. Staff very friendly - door man always smiling
4. Great roof-top vista - swimming pool for thin people only!

Bad
1. Breakfast - expensive and small/basic
2. No ironing facilities!
3. Not cheap place - struggling to justify expense.",3,2012,10,12
27,Location Location Disappointment,"Great location (unless you have a Rambla facing room which I assume would be noisy) and lovely interior in this smart, upmarketesque boutique hotel.

Check in was smooth - stayed in the Jewel Suite which overlooks the side road leading to Ramblas so surprisingly quiet. However, the room is not very big (much smaller than it appears on the hotel's website). Bed is standard sized double, 'living area' not that wide and not particularly comfortable and the bathroom, whilst pleasing to the eye, is very small with a bath with shower in it - generally, in a upmarket hotel I would expect a separate shower. In addition, the window into the bathroom has no blind. The room is on the 6th floor but can be seen into from the roof terrace of Le Meridian Hotel (I know because I checked) and also by a few flats although both are 30-40m away. Still, I would expect some window covering.

The room had 2 small balconys with approx. 1.6m high walls so the view was limited but on one was a jacuzzi which was nice.

Sockets in the room were not level and tv remote only worked occasionally

Breakfast for EUR 17 (EUR 15 on offer) was adequate without being anything special. Reception managed to deliver breakfast late on Sunday to the room and also when asked to book a restaurant on Saturday for Sunday evening had to be reminded on Sunday to book actually book it - that said, everyone was friendly and because of the late breakfast and booking issue they did give me a bottle of wine for free.

Mini bar was not refilled during my entire stay and the breakfast was left in the room all day without being removed.

Finally, checked out on Monday at 7.10am - breakfast not served until 7.30am which for a hotel is really poor. They even took time to explain to me that on Sat and Sun breakfast was not served until 7.30am as if this was not the norm (because the guy at reception had to check what time they did serve on weekends which, given the same time as every other day, was a little odd)

All in all, not a bad place at all and great location, but the annoying little things in a 'luxury' hotel stand out.",3,2012,10,04
27,"Modern hotel, best location!","You couldn't ask for a better location! The Hotel Bagues is located on Las Ramblas, a busy street filled with restaurants and bars. You are within walking distance to metro stops and the Plaza Catalunya. There is also a Starbucks 5 minutes away if you're looking for a cheap breakfast. This boutique hotel is ultra modern. The rooms were trendy and clean. The bathrooms have a blowdryer and robes, and a great shower. The one odd thing is the door to the bathroom is tinted, so you can see right through. Fortunately, the toilet is off to the side, and out of the line of sight. We had an interesting view.. corner room with a view of the church next door, and a bit of Las Ramblas. Great view from the rooftop bar, but on a Sunday night, you have to request drink service since there wasn't anyone tending the bar. Free wi-fi each day for 90-minutes, so plan your usage when you will be in the room for some time, since it is continuous. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. One of the nicest hotel staff I've encountered throughout my travels. Definitely worth the price.",5,2012,10,01
27,Great Boutique on Ramblas,"As illogical as it sounds, this really nice restoration on Ramblas is a great place. The rooms are compact but modern, clean and convenient. The staff is extremely friendly and service oriented. Its a real gem of a place in the gothic quarter, steps from the Boqueria and all the Ramblas action, the port, uptown Plaza Espana etc. A really great find.",5,2012,09,28

We've stayed at other (more expensive)boutique hotels, like Soho Sanctum in London, but Hotel Bagues can definitely show them how it should be done.  It's incredibly stylish with a quirkyness which is charming at the same time.  The staff are great, the service is fantastic and the location is perfect - even if none of the taxi drivers knew where it was!  Drinks were expensive and we didn't eat at the hotel as there are so many excellent, cheaper restaurants on the doorstep, but as a beautiful, luxurious, romantic base - providing an 'oasis of calm' right in the midst of this beautiful, vibrant city it was absolutely perfect.  We definitely want to go back.",5,2012,09,26
27,"Just renovated! Brand new, amazing hotel and amazing location.","Right in the heart of Barcelona sits this incredible hotel. Make sure you go to the roof-top bar, the views are amazing. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The staff is friendly and helpful, and they are completely fluent in English. This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.",5,2012,09,25
27,"Great location, amazing room, helpful staff....just a few niggles!","We stayed here at part of our honeymoon for 3 nights.

Firstly, the hotel is in an amazingly central location. 5 minute walk from the Placa Catalunya and where the Aerobus drops you. 1 minute from the Metro, 2 minutes from the great food market.  You could not be more in the action!

We had the pleasure of staying in one of the Jewel Suites (room 602 - get this room if you can as it is the largest and has the best terrace!). The room is modern with a comfy bed, a lovely bath, a rain shower and an outside double jacuzzi on the terrace. Amazing! It has electric blackout blinds and with the doors on the balcony closed, cuts out all the noise from Las Ramblas below.

The staff at the hotel were very helpful both before and during our stay and made reservations at restaurants for us without any hesitation. The manager Felipe was particularly helpful in suggesting places to eat and answered countless emails from me before we arrived.

There is a lovely pool on the rooftop which had the weather been better we would have used. It is a nice area to sit with a drink and watch the world go by.

There were just a couple of things that could be better and would really make this a true 5 star experience:

You only get 90 mins of Wi Fi a day (this starts from when you log on not in total as we found out). We used this to find places to go on Trip Advisior and to be honest, in a 5 star hotel I would expect unlimited free Wi Fi

There is no ironing board or iron at the hotel! We found this a little ridicuous and the only way to get your shirt ironed was to pay €5! A bit of a money making scheme we felt and again not what you would expect

The rooftop pool area was locked at 8pm Sun-Tues. We didn't understand this and why as a hotel guest we couldn't sit up there in the evening on these days. Weds-Sat it is manned and open until 1am. We found this rule rather silly!

The toiletries in the bathroom were not replenished when used. Again, not what we would have expected.

Maybe now a little petty, but we did think we might have had a little special treatment as it was our honeymoon, like a glass of champers when we arrived but we got nothing. We did get the best room though so can't complain too much! :-)

Tips: 

Join the Small Luxury Hotels of the world club online before your visit and tell the hotel you are a member. This entitles you to free breakfast (usually over €20 each) and early check in/late check out where available.

Bar Lobo round the corner is nice for modern Tapas.

La Crema Canela in Placa Reial is great for dinner.

If you are lucky enough to get a table at Tickets, go! Amazing!

27,Hotel Bagues. Great Location and Property!,"We just got back from a 2 night stay in Barcelona and our experience staying at Hotel Bagues was great! We took the aerobus from the airport, which dropped us off at Placa Catalunya. From there it was only a 5-10 minute walk to the hotel, which was easily found right off the La Rambla. This smaller boutiquey hotel was very modern and clean and had excellent service. When we checked in we found out we had accidentally booked a single room and not a double. The front desk changed our reservation for us  with no hassles or fuss and our room was ready for us to check in earlier than expected. The rooms were very clean and spacious with a lot of textural aspects to the walls, headboards, closets and bathrooms. It was a really beautiful room with plenty of room, which was wonderful! The hotel is conveniently right off the La Rambla so a lot of places were easily walkable. All of Antoni Gaudi's major touristy buildings were within a walkable distance and many restaurants to choose from as well. La boqueria was right NEXT to the hotel, which was where we went for a lot of our food on this trip! I would definitely stay here again, we had a great experience. They even have a candy bar in the lobby to get your sweet fix for the day.",5,2012,09,20
27,"Hotel Bagues, Barcelona","My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of our stay in Barcelona and at Hotel Bagues. The daily breakfast (included) was very good and the staff were friendly and very helpfull. The location was perfect with the ability to walk to many of the downtown sights and shopping. The hotel was very clean, modern and safe and the staff were carefull to advise the guests how to stear clear of trouble with pickpockets and other unsavory characters in Barcelona. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an excellent place to stay.

27,My favourite hotel in Barcelona.,"This hotel can best be described in short sentences:

5-star luxury in a relaxed and unpretentious way.

Luxury roof terrace with swimming pool and lounge bar.

New hotel, opened in 2010, so everything is new and ""up to date and working"".

Young, but very qualified and service-minded staff.

Immediately after check-in, we received a delicious bottle of Rioja, compliments of the hotel.

Rooms with balcony, which means that you can enjoy the atmosphere below on ""Las Ramblas"".

Perfect location, walking distance from all the lovely sights, as well as the beach.

Nicely furnished hotel, with the latest trends within design and decoration.

Spacious bathroom with bathtub and nice products.

Soft and large bed, consistent linen with hotel logo.

No noise from ""Las Ramblas"" due to very effective double-glazed windows.

Surprisingly less expensive than the other 5-start hotels in Barcelona.

More quiet and relaxing than for example Hotel 1898 and Hotel OHLA.

The only drawback is that you have to pay for wifi, if you need more than 90 minutes.

Needless to say, I will be staying here again the next time I am going to Barcelone, amazing value for money.",5,2012,09,18
27,Terrific hotel and employees,"Hotel Bagues is on La Rambla right in the middle of the action.  Outside reminds you of Bourbon Street in New Orleans, but you can close your balcony door and you don't hear a thing.  The staff went out of their way over and over again to make our stay enjoyable.  There is an amazing open air market very near that is a must visit.  I would recommend Hotel Bagues to all of my friends.",5,2012,09,17
27,Great location and great staff,The staff can't do enough for you.Great location and very clean. We had window overlooking las rambles and it was great to open and get fresh air. Not to noisy we love being very central and this is it Starbucks next door with free wifi and market 100 meter away for fruit and other foods. Try bar cante for tapas it was beautiful and bar lobo is very good. We enjoyed the roof top for sun lounging as well.,5,2012,09,15
27,"Modern, clean and quiet!","I would recommend this hotel because its centrally located, safe, modern, clean, quiet and staff were great!

Hotel is centrally located on La Rambla  - major tree lined blvd with large pedestrian median in the center. Blvd seems to be busy all day. We arrived on a Sunday about 6:30 a.m. to find some people on the blvd who looked like they had been up all night. So I was a little skeptical but my mind was quickly put to ease. Access to the hotel is monitored, concierge staff were polite and efficient, and use of hotel elevator requires room key card. As noted, La Rambla is busy but our 2nd floor room was surprisingly quiet - I'm a light sleeper and slept soundly during our 2 night stay.

Hotel room was very clean, modern and well laid out making good use of space. Bathroom also modern and roomy with a large walk-in shower. 

Hotel is within easy walking distance to large main square (Placa de Catalunya) and near the Gothic Quarter. We declined the hotel breakfast and opted for people watching at Cafe Zurich in the main square. Gothic Quarter provides many dining options and large market (La Boqueria) is also close by (great for fresh fruit - was closed Sunday).

We walked to the Picasso museum and Gaudi sights from the hotel. Parc Guell was a bit of a hike but other Gaudi sites are an easier walk.",4,2012,09,14
27,Good Staff and location,"The hotel is well located in the center of the area, near the large Square where the tour buses are located, near the market and a short walk to the pier and beach.  The downside of the hotel was that they regulated the a/c so it got pretty warm during the night and the rooms are very small with no place to place luggage and no drawers to put the folded clothing.  They ""give"" 90 minutes of free internet (must be used at one time) and then charge for any further use; there is a computer in the lower level that you can access to get boarding passes, etc.  Since it was our first time in Barcelona I don't know what other hotels are like but it was not as roomy as the Derby hotel Villa Real we stayed at in Madrid....and it was less expensive that Bagues.",3,2012,09,14
27,Great boutique hotel,"I had a wonderful stay at this hotel in late August of 2012!

Really excellent location and the hotel itself is great.  Keep in mind though that this is a small hotel so if you're looking for the myriad of amenities you typically find at resorts --- including a large pool and fitness center, you should steer toward a much larger hotel.

The room was very quiet as the outside-facing rooms all have doubled-up sets of windows spaced about a foot apart.

While there's a Starbucks on the next block, I suggest going over to La Boqueria Mercat which is about a block and half a way to pick up something for a breakfast snack or to the street level of Restaurante La Xina which is a block up and around the corner --- across from Le Meridien.  Also next to La Xina is Bar Lobo which is a great spot for tapas!",5,2012,09,10
27,"Just brilliant location, service and room","No hesitation in recommending this hotel. Location right on la Rambla, the main 'drag' in Barcelona. Brilliant concierge desk, very helpful (free lollies in big jars when you enter - just too tempting!) Rooms decorated with reference to Charles Rennie Mackintosh which was charming, gorgeous slate bathroom, great room service, very decent breakfast, nice beds, good shower pressure. Tiny little hidden pool (more of a lounge spa) on the top floor from which to watch La Rambla and order a great mojito!

Would definitely recommend",5,2012,09,03
27,Should be excellent but...,"I gave Bagues very good (and not excellent) because of two of my pet peeves.  Two twin mattresses do not equal a king and I hate small round toilet bowls.  Other than those two issues, this was a very excellent small luxury hotel and I would go back and recommend it to friends. This is a hotel right on/in the heart of La Ramba, high end finishes, very clean, and friendly staff.  Typically when I book a room we do not upgrade.  I suspect we had one of the lesser rooms and yet it was still top end. See pictures.  No one should have any concerns about booking this hotel if you want to be in the heart of La Ramba and next to the Gothic Quarters.

For an old city european hotel, the rooms were good size, small by USA standards, but the room we stayed in was very well laid out, high end finishes, and we did not feel crowded. You could not beat the location.  The hotel had good amenities and if you do not want to use the hotel amenities, everything is within walking distance.  Plus the hotel is only a few blocks from Cataluna Square which is a major point of transporation so access to area attractions and connections to the airport are easy.",4,2012,09,02
27,one of the best hotel I 've never been in Barcelona.,"Very well located,  near of Town center. Room  is very nice, calm  and with a efficient service room.

I can recommend this hotel,without doubts.",5,2012,09,02
27,Nearly the perfect hotel!,"The location of this hotel is fantastic, you would not know you were right on La Rambla. The service is really great, friendly and helpful staff who dont act 'posh', and are more than willing to help out. Our room was dark - there are no windows - but it was very clean and had everything we needed. No tea or coffee but we didn't mind really. I love dark rooms so had a great nights sleep, a tiny bit of noise in the mornings from the stairwell area but nothing major at all. The pool is tiny but absolutely fine to have a dip and sunbathe, and because of the barman in the evenings its more like a swim up pool! Very relaxing and fun to watch the world from high up. We didn't eat here at all, the amazing market is practically next door so I cant comment on the food, the drinks on the rooftop were expensive but very good and well made. Would definitely recommend this hotel to friends, and would go back again!",5,2012,08,30
27,Almost Perfect,"My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Bagues for 4 nights in August.  It's perfectly located on Las Ramblas just a block from La Boqueria and a quick walk from 2 metro stops, the Gothic Quarter and a number of other attractions, bars, restaurants and shops.  

We arrived after an overnight train from Paris at 8am and therefore our room wasn't yet ready so we went and did some sightseeing and, as promised, someone from Bagues called my cell as soon as the room was ready, which was ahead of the time promised.

The entire hotel and the room itself are beautifully designed and make great use of space, giving it an ultramodern, yet very comfortable vibe.  As soon as you walk in you feel relaxed and completely forget the chaos that is going on outside on Las Ramblas.  

We made use of the rooftop pool every day which was great and was very relaxing and refreshing after a long day of sightseeing.

There were just a few reasons that I gave this hotel 4 stars instead of 5.  The first is that the housekeeping was a little hit or miss.  They would do a good job cleaning and providing new towels, soaps, etc. but they wouldn't remove used glasses or empty plates for some odd reason.  Also, on the rooftop, there is no attendant during the day and the only way to get food or drink is to call down to the desk.  This is fine, but it takes a very long time for them to return with your order.

Other than those couple of items, we loved our stay.  The staff was very freindly and helpful and like I said, the design is great.  We would definitely return and with just a few small adjustments, my rating would easily change to 5 stars.",4,2012,08,27
27,"With almost thirty 5* hotels in Barcelona, you can afford to give this one a miss.","Location is great if you don't mind a bit of noise from La Rambla. We booked a premium room, practically had an anxiety attack when I entered.... Completely internal, zero natural light and tiny. I didn't think I was a claustrophobic person, but this room proved me wrong.  Went to reception to try and change, there were two ladies on reception, unfortunately I don't remember their names,  one had a nice demeanour however the other (I think more senior) had severely limited people skills. You would think that a large hotel chain like Derby might have a more sophisticated screening process for its front of house staff in a 5* boutique hotel. To cut a long story short they said they didn't have any regular rooms available with natural light ie.windows and in response to our claims of being of being mis-sold the room on the hotel website which shows an external window said that ""many hotel rooms in Barcelona don't have windows!"" whether this is the case or not it's irrelevant, it's not what we had booked and we were unhappy.  Our only option was to pay a lot of money to upgrade to a suite, which we did. 

In addition, the so called roof-top pool is more comparable to a foot spa in size and usability but at least there was a bit of water to cool off in. Another gripe of ours was that you got 90 minutes free wifi each day for one device and that's your lot. My partner needed to work which was more or less impossible due to the fact that there wasn't a desk or a table in the room or suite, he actually had to sit and work on the floor. 

Another strange thing, the bed even in the suite was unusually small, in height and width. My partner is not particularly tall (6'1) and his feet were more than slightly hanging off the bed! 

I must say that the two staff I came across who were porters/doormen were very polite and friendly... Perhaps Derby should put them on reception instead?! 

In conclusion there is just too much choice in Barcelona when it comes to hotels for this to even be a contender in the city's top accommodation. Do yourself a favour and try somewhere else.",2,2012,08,27
27,Nice hotel,We stayed at the hotel for one week. The service was very good and we had a good stay there. But I don't give 5 points because the bathroom doesn't offer you enough possibilities to dry your towels your bathrobe and your swim dress. We hang them over the doors of the closet. Not very nice is also the pool on the roof top. It is only a bath cube. You can't swimm in there and after 8 pm it was not allowed to use the pool. So because of these reasons I give only 4 of 5 points.,4,2012,08,20
27,Great Boutique Hotel,"Just came back from a 6 night stay at The Bagues Hotel situated  right on Las Ramblas. To start what really makes this hotel a pleasure to stay at are the staff. You couldn't find a more friendly, professional and caring staff. They made me feel welcome and at home. The location is also perfect because most tours depart from Plaza Catalunya which is only a block away. As soon as you walk out of the hotel you are right in the middle of all the energy that is Las Ramblas. Immediately across the hotel you can walk the Barrio Gothic with all its histotical sites and immediately behind the hotel you can walk the new trendy neighborhood The Raval. Next door is La Boqueria the food market. Once you step back inside the Bagues you feel like you are stepping into an oasis of calm and elegance. I was lucky enough to be able to stay in The Jewel Suite which has an amazing outdoor jacuzzi that I  used throughout my entire stay. It was especially nice in the warm evenings  late at night  as well as in the heat  of the afternoon. The rooftop pool terrace with its chill music and direct view of the cathedral and skyline make it a lovely place for  a before dinner cocktail or a nightcap . All in all a perfect stay! Thanks to the Bagues Hotel staff Carlos, Arix, Ruben, Jorge, Pablo and  the girls at reception for a wonderful time.",5,2012,08,19
27,Hot hotel,"Good hotel. Good location. Great service. Rooftop deck is beautiful, though the designer chose looks over comfort in picking the furniture. One large problem was poor air conditioning in rooms. Difficult to sleep at night if one is used to air conditioning or is from
a northern climate. Air temperature read between 20 and 21, but the room remained very humid.",4,2012,08,19
27,Heart of the action,We spent 3 fabulous nights here. The location is right on La Rambla and very busy which is great for a first trip to Barcelona. Our room was on the 4th floor facing the street so you get all the buzz and yet the soundproofing was superb. Room decoration was quirky with character which we love. The rooftop pool was very pleasant after a hot day although a little stark. The hotel staff were fantastic and couldn't help enough; we loved the breakfast girl who remembered what you liked each day. The location is great for sightseeing/subway/el Gotic although we did have to travel a bit for more interesting restaurants (we didn't try the hotel restaurant but it looked good quality). Breakfasts were great although La Boqueria almost next door offers an amazing alternative.,5,2012,08,18
27,Perfect location,"Fabulous ""couple"" stay at Hotel Bagues.  It is in the heart of the city right on La Rambla and within walking distance to many attractions, restaurants, and shopping, as well as public transportation and tour bus stops.  The hotel itself was very chic with old world charm.  Our room overlooked the bustling pedestrian street, yet it was very quiet and dark, making it perfect for sleeping after long, busy days.  The bathroom door is entirely glass- no room for modesty!  We spent little time on the roof, but there was a tiny pool and bar.  The hotel provided free WiFi for 90 minutes per day.  The staff was extremely friendly, gracious, and helpful and I would definitely return to this property and recommended it to friends and family visiting Barcelona.",5,2012,08,16
27,Amazing stay.....,"We stayed at Hotel Bagues in La Rambla for 2 nights for our mini honeymoon. The hotel was amazing. Every little detail has not been missed, even down to the light decoration projected onto the bedroom doors! Our room was stunning and the bathroom was too. Great shower, especially after walking all day in the heat. Sound proofing from the busy street was exceptional, once the balcolny doors were shut, you couldn't hear a thing. Staff were friendly and helpful. Mini bar charges were billed to our room in error and were dealt without any hassle or fuss. Location is perfect, right in the centre of La Rambla. I would highly recommend this hotel and would definately return again.",5,2012,08,16
27,Nicolas - Great Overall Experience,"My family had a wonderful time last month while staying at the Bagues for 4 nights. The location is excellent and the service was superb. From the doorman to the General Manager.
The food market 25 meters down the street made it very convenient to get fresh fruits and meats.",5,2012,08,14
27,Great experience,Just back from a lovely stay in the Hotel Bagues. Location on La Rambla was perfect for everything. Very central and only 5-10 min walk from the Airport Bus. The welcome from the staff was great and they gave us advice on what to do and see. The room itself was a good size with a very comfortable be and a fantastic bathroom. 90mins free wifi per day which is fine for what we needed but they also supply a lead for wired connection. The roof top bar was a great for a relaxing drink especially at night. Overall a great time had and will definitely be returning.,5,2012,08,13
27,As good as it gets.,This property is top notch and has very large rooms. The staff is young and very hospitable. You can't go wrong choosing this hotel. Did I mention the location? The market (bouqeria) is about 100 yards away. Starbucks is about the same distance. From here you can walk almost anywhere. Noise was not a problem. There is a great breakfast place in the alley behind the hotel. There is a supermarket just 2 blocks away. This hotel is modern and hip and clean. You get great bang for your buck and could see them raising rates so book soon.,5,2012,08,11
27,Excellent!,"I cannot recommend this place highly enough. From location, the service, to comfort...everything you need you will get. It is right on la ramblas, the main street in barcelona and within walking distance to most of the major attractions. There is a food market literally two mins away and we went thier daily to get our fruit fix. They slso sell meat, veges and seafood. The staff at bagues were simply outstanding. They were always happy to help. The facilities were excellent. Loved the shower! If i ever return ti barcelona, i will not stay anywhere but the bagues. Thank you for making our stay a memorable one.",5,2012,08,10
27,A superb small hotel,"We have just had a four day stay at this fantastic small hotel on La Rambla in Barcelona with some friends. We were initially worried about the location - the hot spot of tourist central - but the hotel was such a haven that it didn't matter. In fact, being next door to La Bocqueria was a spectacular and delicious bonus. 
Everything about the hotel was great -
lovely room (small but not too small)
really helpful staff
good food
gorgeous rooftop pool and bar

We all loved loved loved this hotel and would definitely stay again. ",5,2012,08,08
27,Most helpful Hotel staff ever,"My wife and I stayed 7 nights at Bagues in July of 2012. Our room was clean and comfortable. The hotel is right on the busy la Rambla ,nevertheless the room was very quiet.
The staff were as friendly and helpful as any hotel that I have ever stay in. And I've stayed in many 5 star hotels. The location is near perfect. There are many resturaunts, shopping venues and other sites within waking distance. The beach is a 10-15 min walk.  When we go back to Barcelona we will stay at Hotel Bagues again.",5,2012,08,08
27,Fabulous,"Gorgeous boutique hotel close to everything. The bed was comfortable, the shower was amazing - love that rain shower, luxury inclusions such as fluffy bath robe and slippers and electric blinds topped off the experience. 

The room was quite small, but perfectly quiet unless you opened the door onto the 20cm almost non existent balcony.  The bathroom door that was clear meant that one couldn't go to the toilet in privacy unless the other was lying on the bed. Not sure about clear / glass doors on bathrooms.

The roof top pool was small also, but the space was really calm and a nice place to have a drink / relax after the hustling La Ramba.  We spent all our time eating at the northern neighbourhood of Eixample, about a 15 minute walk away, or 20 minute stroll (or short taxi).  

Lovely, would highly recommend it.  Don't pay for breakfast, go a few doors down the road to the St Joseph Markets and pick up some freshly cut fruit for 1.50 euro, or a hunk of chorizo.",5,2012,08,07

27,Great Hotel,"We just got back from an amazing stay at the Hotel bagues in Barcelona. I have been traveling for over 30 years and this is by far, my favorite hotel. Not only is the property gorgeous, the rooms spacious and original, the food 5-star quality.",4,2012,07,28
27,Hotel Bagues - not 5 star,"The staff was friendly and helpful and the location of this hotel is great, but there are a lot of hotels in Barcelona and so it is rather easy to find one with a great location.  There were a couple of aspects of the hotel room which made our stay less than comfortable.  The air conditioning in the room was not sufficient.  The room was much, much warmer than the hallways and lobby.  In order to have the air conditioning on in the room guests have to leave behind a room key card in slot near the door.  If you don't leave the key card there, the a/c turns off when you leave the room.  After we discovered that the a/c kept turning off when we left the room, we inquired and this rather odd system was explained to us.
Because the a/c barely worked, we left room lighting off since it heated up the room, but even when it was on, the room is really dark.  This was probably planned for ambiance but is gave us a rather somber feeling.  We felt like we were in a cave.
This is a nice enough hotel but is certainly not worth the price.",3,2012,07,26
27,"Fantastic all the way around, Elegant, Service, Location!","We stayed for 7 nights (July 7th – July 14th) and from the moment we arrived, it really felt like a five star hotel. Indeed right in the middle of Barcelona's largest cultural and shopping areas (excellent location), close to all landmarks, within walking distance from the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, the Cathedral, the Boqueria market, even from La Pedrera, Casa Batlo or Museum of Picasso. But if you are not into walking then the hotel is really close to the metro approximately 100 meters.  I cannot imagine a better location.

It’s a very classy hotel, modern with spacious elegant room with large king size bed. Our room was facing Las Ramblas and was pleasantly surprised how well the room was soundproofed. There were also lovely additional touches from robes and slippers to nightly turn-down service.

The service was excellent/ fantastic from the moment you step out of a taxi. We were left with the best impressions! The staff is very professional, very polite, helpful and of course English speaking staff. Catering to our every need. They never said no! And the service was prompt and friendly. Every recommendation and especially with regards to restaurants was spot on. I only wish I could remember their names so that I could thank each and everyone separately for their professionalism and all their help. 

We highly enjoyed the service. I would recommend staying at Hotel Bagues!

We can't wait to come back! 

Thank you all for a wonderful staying and for making our trip to Barcelona memorable!

27,A wonderful retreat,"This hotel is a wonderful retreat from the busy streets of Barcelona.  Rooms are exceptionally quiet and luxurious in a very understated way.  The staff were exceptionally helpful, friendly and charming.  Spending time in the rooftop pool while enjoying an Amaretto Sour prepared by the bartender, Iago, was a real treat!  We can't wait to return to this beautiful hotel in this wonderful city!",5,2012,07,21
27,Charming hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"We (my wife and child) stayed there for 3 nights in June / July and shall return. We actually made an error (this was my mistake !!!!!) when booking, however this was rectified without any fuss at all, much to our relief. The best characteristic of this hotel? Without questions the Bagues Team. The doorman, the receptionists, management, bar staff on the roof bar, and even the other guests !!!  The rooms are very sleek, modern and well laid out. Before booking I did notice others mentioning that the rooms were small and I would agree that generally, they are quite small, but for an old building, they have use the space sensibly retained much of the character of the old building. Given that we were 3, we moved room to a suite on the sixth floor and this was a lot more spacious and also had a balcony that looked out to the Rambla. A great hotel in a great city.",5,2012,07,09
27,Beautiful hotel in a top location,"I wanted to stay at the Bagues Hotel as a fan of the Bagues and Masriera jewelry. The hotel is on the Ramblas, steps away from La Boqueria and Theatre del Liceu and pays tribute to Lluis Masriera with a nice little museum and a piece of original artwork of the master in pretty much every room. Otherwise, the hotel is modern, testefully appointed and with a warm and welcoming staff. We loved the creative room numbers and door decorations which are in fact clever light projections. New, clea, beautiful, perfectly located, it's a great place to stay in Barcelona.",5,2012,07,09
27,A Perfect Retreat in a Bustling City,"My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights in July, we would definitely return and recommend to friends.  The staff are excellent and are happy to assist in any way they can, from making bookings and recommendations to general advice and information.  Nothing was ever too much trouble, they are only too willing to help.
The location is perfect for exploring this vibrant City, right in the heart of Las Ramblas.  From this location we walked all over, from the beach to the North and Park Guell.  We used the Metro System to explore further and found it easy to use.  We also took the train and enjoyed a day at Sitges.
We had dinner in the Hotel restaurant twice (we had to go back a second time as the food was so good the first time).  The staff and Chef make the meal special, the fillet steak (Ox) we had was superb, the best I have had in a long time and the little complimentary in-between courses were exciting treats.
The roof terrace is lovely with stunning views over the City and was a great retreat after a day walking the City.
Even though we were right on Las Ramblas there was no noise in the room.  Quite remarkable when you consider that when you do open the window the noise is deafening.  Obviously quality double glazing.
The Hotel is described as a Boutique Hotel, I agree, it reminded me of Boutique Hotels we have stayed in in Edinburgh like Prestonfield and The Howard.  Small is beautiful, comfortable and cosy.  Not clinical and standard like most of the big name chains.  If you want a bit of luxury in the heart of the City this is the place for you.
A big well done and thank you to Felipe and his staff.",5,2012,07,07
27,Wonderful Stay!,"We spent 3 nights at the Hotel Bagues after a recent cruise, and loved everything about the hotel. 

The location is great. Even if you're not interested in La Rambla, the hotel'slocation makes it easy to get to things you will be interested in. The fantastic Boqueria Market is just a block away, the Gotic Quarter is a short walk, as is the marina. And the extremely helpful staff at Hotel Baques made sure we knew where we were going.

The hotel is small, but with no wasted space at all. That sums up our room as well. It was European in size, but the efficient layout made it seem larger. I didn't even mind that you could see through the bathroom door. I didn't ""get"" it, but didn't mind it. The rooms are soundproofed, and it was kind of amazing how well that worked. When you closed the door to the balcony the sounds of La Rambla just disappeared.

We were supposed to get a free upgrade as part of our package, but an upgrade wasn't available at check in. So instead we were given free breakfasts (a $52 value per day). Since we loved the room we did get, that may have been the best outcome anyway. The breakfast was very nice, although $26 pp may have been a little much. They did have Cava at breakfast, which was a nice touch.

There were plenty of little touches that made the hotel special. There was a tiny jewel museum on floor 1, a hotel logo was projected on your door (hard to explain, but very cool), a very bottle of Rioja showed up at our room after checkout, and every inch of the place was stylish. We finished our trip up with drinks on the 7th floor terrace. It was a perfect way to end a perfect stay.",5,2012,07,04
27,My Hotel Bagues Stay,"My wife and I recently stayed at Hotel Bagues on our honeymoon prior to departing for a cruise.  The hotel is in the perfect location, right on Las Ramblas, across from the Gothic Quarter, next to the market. Its close to the port and metro stations.  Its right in the heart of everything.  The hotel staff was so friendly and helpful and when we checked in we told them we were traveling for our honeymoon.  That night the staff sent us a complimentary bottle of wine up to our room.  The hotel is so quaint and clean and the room was great.  We had a suite on the top floor with a jacuzzi on the balcony.  They had a computer with free wifi on our floor and they had complimentary candy dishes in the lobby.  Everything about this hotel was perfect, from the staff, to the location, to the room.  I cannot say enough about Hotel Bagues, 5 star quality and if my travels ever take me back to Barcelona I know where I am staying.",5,2012,06,22
27,Loved it!,"This was my fist introduction to Barcelona and the location of this hotel was perfect for this ""newbie""- within 5 minute walking distance of the market, Gothic cathedral and quarter, Palau Guell, opera, many neighborhood bars and bistros off La Rambla (avoid the busy tourist section) and most importantly, the subway. We chose a penthouse room, so didn't have any complaints about size and natural light. The rooftop terrace is spectacular (though I heard one Arizona couple complain about the size of the pool- ha!), the service friendly and prompt, and the overall decor is really special. My advice: spurge a little and get a room on the 6th floor. Do NOT skip the excellent breakfast and enjoy the a/c after an afternoon of wandering around. Best thing: going for a neighborhood walk at 7 a.m., then splurging on a breakfast with cava and jamon.",5,2012,06,21
27,Perfect Location,"Reviews on TripAdvisor brought us to this property which is right on La Rambla and easy walking distance to the Barcelona Cathedral. We were encouraged to book here based on comments that this new (opened Oct, 2010) hotel was soundproofed from La Rambla noise. That is correct. However, due to this modern hotel's design, do not accept a room that has an internal window on the atrium ( which are not adequately soundproofed from the noise coming down the atrium from the rooftop bar (7th flr). These would be rooms 106, 206, 306, 406, 506 & 606. We were moved for our 2 nd night to a room facing La Rambla (203) and enjoyed a very quiet night. Management comped us our breakfasts (2) for our inconvenience.
       This is a lovely, modern, small (37 rooms) hotel with attentive service, uniquely furnished modern rooms and great location. The recommendation of a nearby tapas bar/restaurant was also spot on. An overall good experience in one of Europe's top cities.",4,2012,06,20
27,Hotel Bagues visit,"We just came back from a trip to Barcelona and stayed at the Hotel Bagues based on reviews from Trip Advisor.   The location was great for us - right on Las Ramblas.  We like to be able to walk everywhere and this was a central location.  Our room faced Las Ramblas but it was totally sound proof.  The staff at the hotel was wonderful - friendly-professional- knowledgeable.

The condition of the building is great - it has only been open a couple of years - there is a small roof top pool and bar that we went to at the end of the day.

My only complaint is that the rooms are extremely small.  We stayed in the middle price room - it was a corner with windows on two sides.  Unfortunately for me it was just too tiny.  There really wasn't any room to sit or use our computers or even keep our luggage out of the way.

In addition the bathroom had an enormous sink on the vanity but it left very little room to place toilet articles.  Because of that I am not sure that I would stay there again but I feel badly saying that because the condition is so great and the staff is so wonderful.",4,2012,06,18
27,Great hotel except for rooms,"Really friendly staff and a great location for the rambles area of Barcelona. Very close to the markets and shops and plenty street entertainment at night outside the hotel. The only thing that brins te place down ar the rooms. Our room had no view at all unless you wanted to look at the corridors of the hotel. Obviously no one wants to do that or let everyone see you so a black curtain is in front of he window which makes It seem very dark and closed in. 
The bathroom is nice and stylish but again even with all the lights on it is very dark.
We found noise was also an issue. Not from outside the building but from inside. The sound travels very easy in the corridors and we could hear the staff in reception even on the 2nd floor at 5am in the morning. Because the hotel is so open I think staff should be more aware of this. having said that I would reccomend it for its location and would use it again but next time I think id make sure I had a room with a real view.",3,2012,06,15
27,Great stay,"Very comfortable stay on the La Rambla.  Location was great, close to everything.   Staff were very helpful.  Hotel is a small and charming place.  Room was lovely.  I left shoes in the room and sent a fax and asked them to forward them to a hotel in Venice.  No problem.  When I arrive in Venice, shoes were there.",5,2012,06,12
27,Superb town hotel with first class service,Arrived hot and tired. Great air conditioned reception area. Superb reception team welcomed us and took us to our room. Beautiful stylish accommodation. Very welcome complimentary drink. Fabulous bed and responsive air conditioning. The service is exceptional here. Very quietly efficient. A real gem.,5,2012,06,06
27,"location yes, staff nice, room designs poor, upkeep ok","First, the good; great location on the always always busy Rambla (think Times square busy); and boquiera/market and metro stop/cataluyna square for tours. Easy walk to beach but it takes 20 minutes plus. Access to old city is easy and El Born, but again, 20 minutes so expect that time. Easy paths on pedestrian streets Also, staff helpful with restaurant choices, maps, understand english well etc. Boutique style hotel with modern lobby. Great breakfast to start the day (get it included or it is too expensive given the market almost next door).
The rooms however are terribly designed. Small is a nice way to describe; but even small with good design would be acceptable - this is not. The idea of a glass door directly opposite the bed in a tiny room; with a direct view of the toilet; ain't pleasing unless you are single traveler. Ridiculous since could easily 'shield' the glass with opaque/curtain or whatever. Airconditioning is fine and not noisy at all; but 'drapes' the margins of the room so it 'falls' on the head of the bed - design less than perfect.
Good sound 'proofing' especially notable when you open the window - so good for them
Literally around the corner is Bar Lobo - go! good action and good food including tapas and meals. Busy on weekends to the n'th degree but fun as it should  be

Overall, nice visit in may, 2012. Hated the room design and i travel a lot!",3,2012,05,28
27,"Terrific location, nice boutique","I stayed at The Hotel Bagues for two nights in March right after Mobile World Congress.    It was a fantastic location - quite the oasis from the hustle and bustle of La Rambla, although I was able to open my window and look out on the street in the evening when I wanted to.  When I shut the window, the noise was completely shut off.   The sound proofing was very good.     The room was small but very comfortable, modern and luxurious.   The hotel itself is very nice and tastefully decorated.   The staff was very helpful.    I did not try the restaurant.    Would highly recommend it for anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2012,05,28
27,Comfortable stay,When we arrived they told me we had booked a single room.  It did have a double bed but was a smaller room.  They were totally booked.  We saw the room and it was lovely.  Very modern and very quiet.  We didn't mind the double bed.  The service was very good. The location is awesome. It is right next door to the boquiera market which is amazing.  We could go to everywhhere. Great position. Our room no. Was 102 and only had a small window but it was nice and dark for sleeping.,4,2012,05,24
27,A Great Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for a long weekend when we went to the Spanish GP. All the staff we encountered were very nice, helpful and professional. The hotel itself is quite designer as was the room we stayed in. The room was quite small but most importantly was clean and kept clean during our stay. The location on Rambla so it is easy to walk most places you just have to be careful out at night although I did notice quite few police around. While it was very noisy outside as soon as the window was closed there was barely any noise at all from outside. 
Food and wine was also very good
I highly recommend this hotel as they have clearly made a lot of effort to please their guests.",5,2012,05,22
27,Great Hotel!,"We travelled to Barcelona for a trade conference and took some extra time for sight seeing. We stayed at Hotel Bauges for the first part of our visit to Barcelona. It is located right on the Ramblas, close to La Boquiera Market. We stayed in room 202 which was off to the side of the hotel so there was no issue with noise at all in this room. We had a view of the church next door. So if you want to see the bustle of the Ramblas from your room you should ask for a room overlooking it. If you want something quieter, I suggest this room. We received a free bottle of wine and chocolates as welcome to the hotel. The room was clean and very well appointed. I have no complaints about this hotel. It is in an excellent location on the Ramblas, near metro stations, La Boquiera Market and shopping. The tour buses stop at the square just up the street from the Ramblas which made that tour very convenient for us. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We had drinks at the bar. We ordered their specialty gin drinks. They were pricey but very delicious. We did not eat at the hotel. We visited the rooftop pool area but it was too cold to swim yet. 
It was well worth it for the price we paid. We moved to another hotel for the weekend because the cost per night almost doubled to over 300 euros a night. But if you can get a room for 180 euros or lower it is really worth it. I would stay there again if I were to return to Barcelona.",5,2012,05,21
27,Pretty Perfect,"My husband and I went to Barcelona for a long weekend.  I was looking for a centrally located hotel with a touch of luxury that provided an oasis in a crazy city.  This place was perfect!  Right on Rambla in the heart of the city we had the whole of Barcelona at our doorstep.  Opening our balcony door to the noisy, chaotic hustle of the Rambla I knew it was a great location, but wondered how well we would sleep.  Well let me tell you, I'm about the lightest sleeper on the planet and those windows/doors they have in this place are amazing!  Open them and it's crazy loud, shut them and you hear nothing!  Stepping into the hotel was truly like stepping into an oasis of calm, clean and serenity.  Our room, a deluxe facing the Rambla (#503) was superb.  It's a very sleek, modern place with careful attention to detail.  Slippers, robes, chocolates, even wine and a nice note left for us on our arrival, great bath products, fabulous shower, elegant decor, lovely aroma throughout, free sweets bar at reception, etc.  Perfect for a getaway.  This really doesn't have a family feel, but more of an adult sort of feel.  I travel a lot with my family and would not have stayed here with my children.  The staff are great, super helpful in everything, great restaurant recommendations.  Barcelona is a fascinating city, really enjoyed it, but it's also hectic and less secure feeling than many other European cities.  We witnessed several fights along many streets, a couple of arrests and pickpockets (overheard so many sad stories of other travellers) are rampant.  I've been to 25+ countries in Europe and Barcelona is definitely up there on a very short list of places with a palpable crime level that means you should take extra precautions (i.e. only carry absolute necessities on your person, keep all valuables and passports, etc. in the hotel safe).  Just be extra cautious and smart and you'll enjoy every moment.  I love Barcelona and I'd highly recommend it, just be more careful.  And most of all if you're looking for a great hotel in the middle of the action that will be your oasis in the city, Bagues is the place!",5,2012,05,07
27,"Fantastic hotel, great location, great rooms","We stayed here for five nights and were not disappointed.    The rooms are great, very clean and modern and quite big especially based on most city standards.    The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly and nothing was too much effort.   It is based right on La Rambla and is central to most of the places that you would want to visit in the city.    Despite being on a very business main street we had no issues with the noise.   We ate in the restaurant and had the gourmet menu and it was fantastic, super value for money and the food was pretty damn good.   The breakfast was very good with ample choice of buffet and a cooked to order breakfast of your choice.",5,2012,05,02
27,Fabulous,"We went on a girlie weekend to celebrate my friends 50th birthday, so choosing a hotel that was central and safe was important. We weren't disappointed! It is in the heart of the Rambles, it's a beautiful hotel, our room had a great view, the staff were very helpful and friendly. If there was any down side it was the bathroom door is glass and so there isn't much privacy, although we did manage to improvise using the throw from the bed!! We didn't eat in the hotel as there are so many lovely restaurants all around and a fabulous market that sell fresh fruit and smoothies for breakfast! 
All in all, a lovely hotel and an amazing  city. Can't wait to return. ",5,2012,05,02

27,nice hotel,"we stayed at the bagues for three nights, having been to barcelona several times i had never actually stayed on La rambla before and i am glad i did, the location is great for exploring barcelona with the only slight down side being a slight audiable exposure to the hustle and bustle, if you want a nice hotel in the best location it is pretty much hard to fault.",4,2012,04,18

Staff very friendly and helpful, would highly recommend to anyone looking a fashionable luxury hotel right in the centre of things.",5,2012,03,21
27,Surely the best hotel on La Rambla,"The location is absolutely unbeatable for tourists. Super service with a young crew who gave great restaurant recommendations as per our wishes. Breakfast buffet also high quality. Design is modern and stylish, rooms perfectly soundproof, just a bit on the small side, let's say cosy. Amenities were also great. We loved every bit.",5,2012,03,19
27,Excellent hotel with great service,"Highly recommended. Had a great stay for 4 nights with Hotel Bagues. Staff at the hotel are very friendly and helpful. Location is perfect. Great experience staying on the La Rambla without actually having to put up with any noise. The soundproof system for the rooms is indeed world class. Breakfast was well executed and tasty. Variety could be an issue if one stays for a long period (but this is the same problem with all other hotels).

Will definitely return to the Hotel Bagues when back in Barcelona!",5,2012,03,05
27,"Good location, friendly staff, broken jacuzzi tub, glass bathroom door","Hotel Bagues is in an excellent location on La Rambla. The staff is very friendly and service oriented. The hotel is walking distance to anything in El Gotic and the main streets with shopping, Passig de Gracia, etc. Hotel was clean and housekeeping did an excellent job daily. We didn't eat at the hotel so can't speak to the food.

I opt'd for a top floor 'suite' with the deck and private jacuzzi tub. I thought this would be perfect after a day of walking and exploring. My particular suite, room 603, was not much bigger that a regular hotel room. There was an extra seating/lounge area but the TV was mounted right over it so you really couldn't lounge to watch TV. The space seemed useless. The jacuzzi tub was broken and they couldn't fix it during my 5 day stay. This rendered the top floor deck/jacuzzi tub useless. To me this left me in just a regular room at the suite rate. The manager gave me 20% off my bill and a free breakfast, after negotiating up from his original 10% offer. I still left mildly disappointed as I feel I shouldn't have paid more than a regular room rate.

The room was cold upon arrival and took a few hours to heat up.  After a long trip we took a nap under the blankets with our coats on.  We thought the heat was broken but it was just a very low air flow out of the vent.  I recommend they get a head start on heating the room before they check people into it.

A couple other notes, the bathroom door is glass and transparent. You can see anyone in there doing any bathroom business. We draped the cheetah print blanket over the door and clipped it to the door frame with a couple hangers. You can hear street noise. If you are a light sleeper this could be an issue. You will hear the drunk folks yelling down La Rambla until about 3am.

I wouldn't return based on my personal experience, plus I'd want to try one of the other nice places I saw embedded in El Gotic, but I wouldn't recommend you not try Hotel Bagues.",4,2012,02,27
27,"Luxury, Style and excellent attention at unbeateble location.","This hotel was the very best we have ever experienced in Barcelona and we also can say, among all the other 8 we stayed during our recent two-week trip by Spain.

Even with our great expectations, it was successfull in exceed it with great and polite attention, cleanliness, high class amenities and facilities as well as its unbeateble location, in the middle of Ramblas, very close to Catalunya Square and the Gotic quartier.

The room with its trendy, but very pleasant and slightly romantic decor was always perfectly clean, and we had silent nights and very good sleeping.

And what a charming and pleasant terrace, a perfect playground for chilling out with wine and tapas after long walking days by the sunset, facing the Cathedral´s rooftop.",5,2012,02,26
27,Cool hotel,Excellent hotel in the centre of everything. Rooms are a little small but well furnished and very clean. Staff are extremely helpful. We had a Jewel Suite on the 6th floor with a large terrace and hot tub - a very nice part of the room offer.,5,2012,02,24
27,Fantastic location staff and facilities,"If you want a romantic relaxing and fundamentally cool break in Barcelona this has got to be the place. We spent four nights here last week and everything was more or less perfect. Great location in the centre of everything in an uber cool room which was warm, comfortable and sound proofed. Staff amazingly friendly. Everything good and yes I want to go back.",5,2012,02,20
27,Good hotel excellent location,"Team is tentative, room somewhat small, location is great overall very nice hotel",4,2012,02,20
27,details so disappointing,"The staff are ok but the details in the room are a disaster. It's a  just OK hotel but not deserves a 5-star. The heating was broken when we checked in, the cold room got my girlfriend a heavy cold! The slippers look not clean. The wardrobe is full of dust.  The bathtub is small and it is not slip-resistant and of course I slipped once! All in all it is a young hotel and has its own ambitions which can be seen from the friendly staffs but to reach a real 5-star it needs to learn a lot from those old brands.",3,2012,02,20
27,"Exactly what I wanted - Great location, plus","Great location with easy access for walking to landmarks, great shopping and resturants, metro, or buses. Hotel staff was very accomidating and friendly. Room and bathroom were well appointed with a comfortable feeling. Room was facing Las… Ramblas, and was pleasantly surprised how well the room was soundproofed. We could also open the door to the balcony to experience the city sounds - best of everything. Lovely additional touches from robes and slippers to nightly turn-down service. As mentioned by another reviewer - the one thing that is hard to see in pictures is that the bathroom door is completly see through. Put a towel over the door to provide some privacy if needed.. Hotel provides 1 hour a day of free wifi. They provided a LAN cable for all day internet access at no charge. Also provided complimentary wine and drink at the bar for special occasion. Would stay there again.",5,2012,02,10

It is very modern, the location is great right in the middle of La Ramblas can walk to anywhere.  The staff just couldn't do enough for us, made suggestions and were very friendly.  Some people mentioned the noise but we stayed in a room overlooking the Ramblas and the soundproofing you couldn't hear a thing.  Do an open top bus tour is well worth it to get your bearings.  I would highly recommend this hotel and that staff are what made it extra special. Thank you",5,2012,02,01

The hotel staff are very friendly and attentative.  Although the rooms aren't the largest this is no reason to complain, as they have all the facilities that you would expect from a member of the Small Luxury Hotels of the world.  It's also worth noting that the rooms are totally soundproofed which allows for an uninterrupted nights sleep.  To conclude we would definitely book this hotel on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2012,01,02
27,GREAT HOTEL,"Fantastic hotel that is perfectly situated for shopping and cultural sight-seeing and also not far from the port. 
The staff were excellent - very friendly and professional and discerning.
The bedroom was small but perfectly functional and I had a view over the Ramblas and the double glazing was very effective - no noise at all in the bedroom.
The breakfast was good though could have had more hot choices? But there is enough not to go hungry though!
All in all an excellent hotel that I would not hesitate to recommend.",5,2011,12,16

The rooftop terrace has fantastic views over the city. 
Breakfast was not varied enough to my taste, but all items served were top notch quality. Service was good.  We had also an aperitif with some food at the hotel, which was splendid and not over priced. Well worth it. 
Room was very comfortable even though was small, we had a corner room so it was quiet but with an open balcony viewing the Ramblas and the cathedral. 
The hotel is very close to the Boqueria market, a great place to shop and enjoy the many tapas.",5,2011,12,13
27,Elegance at the heart,"On Barcelona's famous boulevard La Rambla, a mere minute's walk from the bustling Boqueria city market and adjacent to the delightful Gothic Quarter, who could ask for a more elegant place to stay in the heart of Spain's most exciting city? 
We stayed five nights. Our fears of excessive noise proved unfounded, thanks to effective double glazing. Our corner room was tastefully appointed in dark wood, leather and muted gold with comfortable bed and stylish bathroom. To the side was a fantastic close-up view of the facade of the Bethlehem Church and at times we opened the doors onto our tiny front balcony simply to watch the passing show below. The hotel staff were professional and courteous. El Regulador bar-brasserie (on the ground floor) serves an excellent breakfast  ... and in the evening an outstanding gin & tonic! The roof top bar has city views. Keep a look out for package deals.",4,2011,12,11

But, the rooms overlooking La Rambla are noisy. Bring ear plugs! The service and the breakfast at Hotel Baques is excellent. Before visiting, you should enroll in ""SLH"", Small Luxury Hotels of the World. It is free and you can receive a free room upgrade with this membership along with other amenities. For the price, this hotel is expensive. It is more like a 4 star hotel in the US.",4,2011,12,09
27,Great Hotel!,We just got back from a long weekend at this hotel.  It is a fairly small hotel in the middle of La Rambla.  It is a great location for sightseeing and easy train access.  We enjoyed our balcony facing La Rambla. Not too loud in the room.  The staff was great and very helpful with any questions we had.  The room was very nice and clean.  Highly recommend this hotel.,5,2011,11,30
27,Perfect,"We stayed here for a short weekend away and were blown away! From the moment we arrived the staff were amazing, and they were always keen to help us out during our stay. The room was a great size, cool, and comfortable, plus kept the buzzing ramblas quiet. The bar on the roof was a great spot to relax after a days exploring - the barman was fantastic too, he was really useful on helping us find the unknown parts of the city we wanted to see. Cannot recommend this place highly enough.",5,2011,11,29
27,Excellent location & a lovely stay,"The hotel is located in las ramblas,which is where you want to be if you are in Barcelona. It was our first trip after we had our first baby. We asked for a crib in the room. They provide it at no extra charge. It's not a big hotel,but rather boutique hotel.Nicely decorated rooms. The room isn't very spacious but you have everything you will need in it. For those many reviews I have read before deciding to disregard them and stay at this hotel ,that its very loud,shame on them ,because the windows they have installed are sound proof. We took the room with the view on las ramblas and to prove my point my baby never woke up by the noise of the street. As long ad the window is shut ,you will have no noise issues. The ramblas street is very entertaining ,if you stand in your balcony you will feel like you are in the middle of the action. The staff are very helpful and friendly. Most of the staff are not even native Spanish ,and their English is okay. As soon as we arrived they greeted us and the person at the help desk gave us a map and started pointing out the attractions and the places we might want to visit during our stay in Barcelona. Breakfast was okay ,don't expect much though,it's a bit expensive because there are very narrow items ,but we decided it was more convenient since we had our baby with us. The room is cleaned twice a day ,once in the morning after you leave for breakfast and another time in the afternoon ,and it's when they leave you a note card of tomorrows expected weather as well as chocolate. We were sent a complimentary bottle of wine same day of arrival. As for the bathroom it's all glass you can see through the glass door ,it didn't bother us ,because it was me and my husband in the room,but I'm sure it would bug us if we had been sharing a room with a friend rather than a spouse.  The shower is great after a long day of walking around the streets of Barcelona ,it was very relaxing. Very comfortable and pleasant stay as an overall evaluation.",5,2011,11,18
27,Simply Wonderful,"This has to be one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in and believe me we have stayed in our fair share. Great location right in the middle of La Ramblas. We had a side street room but still plenty to look at, if out on your balcony. Yes there is a building directly opposite so view not great but hilarious for people watching. Did not hear any noise from the street below at night and felt very safe walking around day and night. the rooms are a little dark but very quirky and exceptionally clean which is the main thing. Definately visit the food market very near by the hotel. Down by the harbour is lovely, also the beach. If you want to see more of the city and dont want to walk everywhere, then get on an open top bus and view the sites. Will definately will go back.",5,2011,11,15

27,Good Hotel but rooms too dark and non Ramblas facing rooms depressing,"Must take a room facing the Ramblas- those are cheerful and feel more voluminous . The other rooms face a building on the side street which is close - it creates a vis a vis and affects the view. Despite the proximity of the Ramblas, these rooms can be depressing . 
The staff is very friendly and helpful 
In its attempt to be funky this Hotel ends up making the rooms too dark - the furniture colour , the over-all colour utilisation etc end up with that effect
Over-all a good Hotel",4,2011,10,27
27,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location","We booked this hotel for our honeymoon In September this year, only 3 nights as we left our children with relatives!!  it is a great location on La Rambla and max 5 minute walk from Placa De Catalunya where the Aerobus drops you off from the Airport.  The hotel is beautifully decorated and we had a superior room facing the church with a tiny balcony which you can stand out on and watch the comings and goings, without quite so much noise, however sound proofing is excellent!  The staff are excellent and the room was incredibly clean, with the staff coming in the evening to turn down the beds and a fresh rose in a vase everyday.  We were even given a complimentary bottle of red wine in our room on our first evening.  we would have liked to have had tea and coffee making facilities available in our room though, I bought my travel kettle and supplies but forgot to bring the cups, so never used.  The complimentary tolietries are excellent and the bath and shower were really great, even had a self closing toilet seat, on the downside is the glass door into the bathroom, i would prefer a little bit more privacy, frosted door would have been better!!! We didn't sample the breakfast or restaurant in the evening as wanted to eat our breakfast on the go and eat in the restaurants local to the sites we were visiting.  Due to the location of the hotel we were able to walk everywhere to all the sites but it is still alot of walking!!!  The roof top terrace is a wonderful bonus and particularly lovely at night time!  I would definitely stay in this hotel again and would highly recommend it!",5,2011,10,17
27,An Encounter in Barcelona - Hotel Bagues,"Went for 3 days over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend with my girlfriend.

Located in the heart of Las Ramblas, this hotel was an excellent find whilst on special offer during soft opening.

The room was excellent, very modern and trendy with all the mod-cons. Excellent bathroom, with a nice deep bath, perfect after a long day sightseeing!

Very friendly staff, with a half bottle of red on arrival. 

The hotel had a roof top area which we didnt get chance to use, with a small 'dip' pool.

Would definatley recommend this hotel!",5,2011,10,13
27,A unique opportunity to stay in a work of art,"The hotel is centrally located in La Rambla and, from the first moment we stepped from the cab to the time we left, we were treated with the utmost charm and courtesy. The hotel has been finished to a unique and incredibly high standard and the rooms are as luxurious as I've seen anywhere. The icing on the cake is the roof top terrace where you can sunbathe, order a drink, or cool off in the pool. The room we stayed in overlooked an open central atrium so daylight was a little limited, but, on the plus side, there was no street noise, which is a rarity on La Rambla!  I have no hesitation in recommending Hotel Bagues - it is a credit to its owners, its designers, and its management and staff.",5,2011,09,20
27,"Excellent location, modern room, great rooftop deck & pool","We spent two nights at Hotel Bagues in early August 2011. We booked a basic room through SLH and were upgraded to a slightly larger queen room as SLH members.  Our room, corner room on the third floor, overlooked Las Ramblas and the side street with the church. It was an excellent location and we enjoyed standing on the small balcony for some pictures and people watching.  The noise was not a problem at all.  We lowered the shades and curtains at night and slept soundly.

Hotel staff was excellent and the rooftop pool was a nice treat and usually quiet. The towels at the rooftop pool are great. We ordered some drinks while by the pool in the late afternoon and received wonderful service.  

Our room was comfortable, modern, neat, and chic.  We especially liked the modern touches, yet the historic setting.  We also had the hotel breakfast both mornings and really enjoyed it.  Breakfast had a nice assortment and very fresh fruit. 

Overall, we loved our two night stay at Hotel Bagues.  It was the perfect end to our two week Europe trip. This is the third Small Luxury Hotel we've stayed in and would recommend Bagues to others and would book another SLH for future vacations.",5,2011,09,12
27,Gorgeous rooms and great location,"My sister and I stayed here for 1 night in July 2011 it was brilliant, it is such a beautiful hotel with attention to detail and the service was fantastic they offered us complementary cocktails water bottle and delicious cherries which was all so good. The twin room we stayed in had a little balcony and a view of La Rambla which was really great and there was no noise issue, the bathroom is amazing the door is glass so not good if you like your privacy but it was really stunning and had a nice bath. The design of the rooms and foyer areas is gorgeous it was all so lovely I would definitely stay here again but for longer next time.",5,2011,09,12
27,Delightful hotel right in the heart of things,"We stayed at Hotel Bagues for 3 nights and chose one of the ""Jewel"" suites to splash out on for a  treat to experience something special to finish off our hectic  2 week holiday with a bit of R&R and luxury in the heart of Barcelona.   The room and facilities more than matched our expectations and we thoroughly enjoyed the luxury of having our own terrace with an outdoor jacuzzi bath.  We were in room 603 and I must admit the other suites on that floor did seem to have more spacious terraces with sun beds etc and I don't know if that means our room was slightly less in price, I don't think so but it is worth bearing in mind when booking.  We do have a few grumbles but must admit they are minor and really only about the housekeeping side of things.  The fan in the bathroom wasn't working and although there was a flower vase in the bathroom,  there were no flowers.  We had special towels for using outside (we noticed these were also on the roof for using in the pool) delivered on the first evening (about 8 ish) after we had already used the tub and not again during our stay?  We had mats for either side of the bed and the weather forecast for the next day delivered on the second evening but not on any other night and although there were glasses and tumblers in the cupboard for use with the mini bar on the first night they were not automatically replaced and we had to ring down and ask for them. To us, the treat of staying in a 5* hotel is to have impeccable service, attention to detail and little touches that you do not normally expect in cheaper hotels so it was shame that we experienced these minor lapses.

Even so, overall,  we would highly recommend the Bagues for your stay in Barcelona.  Most importantly the sound proofing was fantastic and we enjoyed peaceful nights which is vital on la Ramblas! The staff were extremely helpful, polite and welcoming and a credit to the hotel. The roof top bar and pool area was very stylish and the barman particularly friendly and helpful. Breakfast was generous and varied and we didn't need to eat again until the evening!",5,2011,09,12
27,quaint little property with excellent service,"the location of bagues is excellent - bang on la rambla, next to a fabulous fruit/food market which is bustling. All stores are within walking distance. we even walked to the beach, picasso museum, cathedral, el born area etc from here. 
the hotel itself is small with maybe 20-30 rooms but the staff do an excellent job and bend over backwards to fulfill your every need and desire. They offered me 1 hour of free wifi, concierge gave excellent recommendations for restaurants, bars that were spot on. 
The italian doorman, Mario was our guide to the best places to eat and drink. The concierge helped me book train tickets. 
breakfast is served down in the only restaurant and is pretty good. room service is very quick - i ordered some coffee and it arrived in less than 2 minutes. Rooms are a bit small but you dont hear any noise from the outside.",5,2011,09,09
27,Love this hotel,"Stayed for a few days for a romantic break and absolutely loved the hotel! My boyfriend is usually fussy but even he had no complaints! The staff were wonderful and genuinely friendly and rooms were gorgeous. The roof pool was perfect for cooling down and as other reviews stated, the rooms are amazingly soundproofed! Will definately be back",5,2011,09,02
27,Very comfortable and enjoyable,"I spent a long weekend here as a suprise birthday treat. The location and views from my room were excellent. Although it is situated on the very busy Las Ramblas, the room proved to be very well soundproofed.
The hotel and room decor were very baroque and unique. The rooftop bar offers a great panorama of Barcelona's skyline. Special mention must go to the staff who where friendly and extremely helpful. The hotel has a nice intimate atmosphere, highly recommended.",4,2011,08,31
27,Perfect located,"Very friendly staff and top located at the ramblas.
The small pool on the roof is just perfect for a cool down with a fantastic view on the ramblas. We did not take breakfast but just walked for 200m to a small foccaccia shop and had a fantastic breakfast",5,2011,08,29
27,Super!!,"A friend recomended us this Hotel. And everything was super!
-Location. In the middle of everything you want in Barcelona. We had a room with a balcony on Barcelona's famous Les Rambles, so sitting in the balcony and just watching the people was a lot of fun.
-Rooms. Very nicely decorated, contemprory and clean.
-Staff. Nice, helpful and knowledgeable.
-Price. Reasonable for Barcelona.",5,2011,08,25
27,Fantastic location!,Stunning ultra modern hotel in a great spot on las ramblas. The room was very luxurious. The staff were very helpful & when our chosen restaurant was shut they recommended & booked us a table at a fantastic place which we thoroughly enjoyed. We loved the little pool on the terrace too!!,5,2011,08,16
27,Perfect La Rambla Location,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel Bagues, room 203 one night before boarding the Silver Spirit.  The hotel is located near the cruise terminal and one block from La Boqueria (same side of La Rambla).  Our room was spacious, nice bathroom, excellent toiletries, a wrap around balcony facing La Rambla (just large enough to stand and walk around - no seating), large wardrobe and safe.  Since we are members of The Club we were greeted with a chilled bottle of champaigne which we enjoyed on the balcony watching all the activity on La Rambla.  The room was quiet and we were not bothered by any noise from the street at night.  Our breakfast was included and was an excellent buffet with cooked to order items in the very trendy restaurant.  The restaurant/bar is open all day and has large windows looking out to La Rambla.  The hotel staff all spoke English and were very accomodating.  The Hotel Bauges definelty lives up to the standards of the Small Luxury hotels of the World and we highly recommend this hotel.  It is very modern, trendy and therefore a little dark in the decor.",5,2011,08,12
27,A very pleasant place in Las Ramblas ! A must !,"Of course, you can tell me that there is some noise but please in this case, las ramblas are the relevant place to be. Here, the atmosphere is very special, starting by the decoration so original, the kindless of the personal who are receiving you so well and with smiles. 
The bedroom can be seen a little small, but you everything in place to arrange your luggages if you are a little organized.
The restaurant is providing a very good food. The only disappointment is for the swimming pool (tool small to use).
I spent a lot of time in hotels in Las Ramblas, and it was the most quiet. Great to be in a place with only 31 rooms. 
Everything was perfect and we enjoy strongly this moment taking profit of good price conditions for this 5 stars.",5,2011,08,09
27,"Design Hotel yes, but not 5 stars","This is my very first review on Tripadvisor. As I was misled by those overwhelmingly positive reviews, I felt like I have to put things into proportion. My review is purely subjective. However my personal approach to rate hotels are the criteria of the European Hotelstar Union (EHU, knowing that Spain - unfortunately - isn't part of it yet).

First of all: in my opinion this is NOT at all a 5-star-hotel. So if you are used to service, facilities and professionalism of large luxury hotel chains like Conrad, Kempinski or Hyatt you will be disappointed. In this case: lower your expectations.

----------------------------------------
Rooms
----------------------------------------

This hotel seems to aim at tourists, not at business people. I went there for a mixed private/business trip during my summer holidays and I wanted at least to treat myself with a good hotel. When I travel for business I always make sure to book a 5-star-hotel to find the services and facilities I might need. And here comes one of the key problems: the hotel is not at all designed for business travelers. So if you plan to work with your computer, forget about it. In your room you won't find a desk, no chair. Nothing. Also don't let yourself mislead by the room description. The fact that they mention ""WiFi"" doesn't mean that it's included in the room rate. They give you one hour a day for free. If you need more, you have to pay extra (unfortunately this became a common problem in most hotels as the WiFi connection is often maintained my an external service provider, as in this case). You can get a LAN-cable to connect to wired Internet for free (works great), however the cable is too short, so the only place where you can use it, is the well designed but very uncomfortable couch that will break your back after an hour. A desk and a chair is a minimum requirement even for 4-star-hotels if it was rated following the EHU guidelines.

For the rest, the rooms are small but comfortable, clean and modern. You'll find a fancy oversized Sony Bravia Screen that faces the Sofa, not the bed (very limited selection of international channels, I didn't mind, just so you know). The bathrooms are modern, clean and have a nice look (dark design, if you like it), however - at least in my room - there was only a shower. Again (sorry): I never staid in any 5-star-hotel without a bath tub. Also basic Spanish hotel classification guidelines require a shower AND a bath tub even for 4-star-hotels. But well, the shower was stylish, clean and of good size. You find toiletries, slippers and bathrobes in the room.

----------------------------------------
Sound insulation
----------------------------------------

Talking about the sound insulation of the rooms: I stayed in room no. 202 (fortunately) facing the beautiful entrance of ""Iglesia de Betlém"", not directly La Rambla. The hotel obviously put a lot of efforts in soundproofing their rooms, however it's impossible to keep out the screaming and singing of thousands of people, garbage collection working all night (waste container under my room), police sirens etc. It's a very busy place all night long. If you are sensitive to noise you will not have a good night sleep. In case you don't know Barcelona: the hotel is well situated at La Rambla. At the same time there is probably not a noisier place than that all over the city. You have to compromise between being at the heartbeat of the city and having a quiet place to sleep. Please be aware of that before you book.

----------------------------------------
Service and staff
----------------------------------------

Now talking about the service which over the years became most essential for me while traveling. Most reviews here on Tripadvisor are complimenting the friendliness of the staff members. And yes, they are in deed all trying to be very friendly. You'll always get a smile and a ""How are you?"" when you cross one of them. I'm not blaming any of those people, I can only blame the management for not giving them what they need to run a luxury-hotel.

Here are only some examples of what happened to me (regarding service attitude):

1) I'm a Club member of Small Luxury Hotels (SLH) and I booked a special SLH-rate that includes a free room upgrade, breakfast and late checkout. When I got to the hotel, I asked if they did upgrade my room. They told me it wasn't possible because the hotel was fully booked. OK, fair enough. This is a common policy and I can't blame them for that. However what I'm used to from other luxury hotels is at least a small sign of compensation, like a welcome drink or at least a formal ""We are very sorry about it, can we do anything else to improve your stay?"" But nothing. OK...

2) When I went to the elevator to go to my room I realized that they printed the price of 22 Euros daily for breakfast on my room card. I went back to the front desk and told them that there was a mistake. With a smile the lady said: ""No, it's not."" I told her that breakfast was included in the SLH rate. Again she said: ""No, it's not."" Sorry, this is absolutely unacceptable behaviour in a so-called luxury hotel. One of the basic rules in luxury hotel business is that the guest is never wrong (even when he is). I had to start a 5 minute discussion in front of other hotel guests (!) till she finally understood that it was their mistake. I felt pretty embarrassed. She said she was not aware that I was a SLH Club member which is a weird excuse because, together with my credit card and my ID, I also handed her my Club SLH Club card right in the beginning. Well...

3) Next morning I realized that they also printed the wrong room rate on my room card so I started to feel like something went really wrong with my booking. That's why I contacted SLH directly to have them check my rate with the hotel and I also informed them about this humiliating treat I received on my arrival (the room rate I booked was advertised with a ""VIP WELCOME"" and a ""PERSONALISED STAY"", hmmmm... see what I got). They contacted the front desk and it seemed like they solved all issues (SLH contacted me back to confirm). However I did not receive any apologize from the hotel management for the misunderstanding and their wrong assumptions. Just as an example: Conrad Hotel in Brussels once gave me an upgrade from a standard room to one of their best suites only (!) because they forgot to answer one of my e-mails. They just did it, without me blaming them for anything. It's not what I was expecting in this case - but at least some warm words of apologize.

4) Next morning I realized that I must have lost my lighter somewhere at the airport (the hotel is a non-smoking hotel, however I was allowed to smoke on the balcony and on the roof top). So I went to the front desk to ask for matches or a lighter and... (not kidding) I was told that this is a non-smoking hotel, that's why they don't have any matches or lighters available. I guess I was too tired to freak out... Fantastic. They advised me to buy a lighter in one of the shops on La Rambla (not easy at 6:30 am).

5) So I thought instead of smoking, maybe doing some sports would be a great idea. I asked where to find the gym/workout room. The answer: ""Sorry, we are a new hotel, so it has not yet been opened."" (afaik the hotel exists since October 2010). Wow, why wasn't I surprised?

6) On Saturday evening I had a meeting and I realized that the only fancy shirt I had was completely wrinkled, so I went to the front desk to ask for an ironing board. Just a very normal thing to ask for. But wrong question again: ""No, we don't have an ironing board for our guests. But we offer a laundry service."" Cool. ""But could you return my shirt within 1 hour?"" Answer was no. ""Only tomorrow."" I don't have to tell you again, that having an ironing board available for their valued customers is a basic requirement - even for a 3-star.

7) Another detail: why would they clean the roof top with a noisy high-pressure cleaner during the already very limited opening hours (9am - 7pm) - insane. This spoiled even the last morning of my stay.

8) The fitness center (that was supposed to be open between 9am and 10pm) doesn't exist.

9) When I checked out, nobody asked if I was satisfied with my stay. OK, the answer is pretty obvious - however it is always a good thing to do (and would have been a good occasion for them to find out what they could do better).

I can't help, but rather finding myself with a staff that is willing to go the extra mile, I felt that there is what I call a ""computer-says-no-mentality"" (and I don't think I asked for anything weird!?).

The only person who actually responded the way I am used to, was the front desk staff member who confirmed my late check-out at the day before my departure (yeah, I couldn't believe that I got one). He acted in a very professional way, addressed me with my name, was actively offering solutions.

The hotel management should also rethink the dress code of its staff. In 2011 I don't expect them to wear a three piece suit, however e.g. I was afraid the doorman, who suddenly jumped in between me and the entrance on my arrival, wanted to steal my suitcase. He was dressed 100% casual, no uniform, not wearing anything with the logo of the hotel or a badge. Also I was very surprised to see some front desk staff members in camouflage t-shirts. It might be part of the design concept, but definitely out of place: it's a luxury hotel, not a military base (some guests from specific countries might even take offense).

----------------------------------------
Breakfast / Food
----------------------------------------

Some people here complained about the small buffet breakfast. I agree it's not a Hilton breakfast, but it's a small choice of tasty high quality products. You can ask for eggs in whatever way you want them to be prepared. It's delicious and presented in a very nice way. But still, my tip is: if you don't have the breakfast included in your room rate, try it once and for the rest of your stay invest the 22 Euros in one of the many other food-options in the neighbourhood (not directly at La Rambla cause most of it is a rip-off).

The breakfast place is an open space facing the reception desk. I felt highly irritated by the hotel staff always straying around the front desk, having fun, talking without restraint, joking, even high-fiving while I was having breakfast. It made me more feel like in a youth hostel than in a luxury hotel.

That's one of the reasons why one day I decided to have my breakfast in-room (26 Euros, or a 5 Euros top-up in case you have the buffet breakfast included in your rate). I got a very (!) small selection of things that you would also find at the buffet breakfast, but not rich enough to start the day. Not worth it.

With the breakfast I was happy to get a small thermos jug of coffee. How disappointing that the jug was almost empty (less than half of a small cup of coffee) and cold. It took me three minutes to explain the room service on the phone (half Spanish/half English) to replace it. 5 minutes later I got a new jug (full and hot). Thank you! At that point I started to be happy about the small things in life!

I also tested the 24h-room-service and ordered a ""8-greens-salad"" (11,40 EUR + VAT) and a ""cheese selection"" (13,50 EUR + VAT). The rooms service was efficient, fast and friendly. The ingredients were fresh, the cheese excellent, everything was well presented. However don't expect to satisfy a big hunger. It's just a snack. My suggestion to the kitchen would be to serve some normal bread with salad and/or cheese. Those 5 small slices of dry bred chips are more decorative than anything else.

I didn't get the chance to test the restaurant (which is the same place than the the breakfast area). As it's right in the entrance hall of the hotel, again facing the front desk, its location didn't really make me want to give it a try.

----------------------------------------
Negative aspects
----------------------------------------

- Fighting about my room rate in front of other hotel guests (no-go!)
- ""Computer-says-no-mentality"" (see everything I mentioned before)
- No appologizes from the management for obvious mistakes they made
- Attitude and dress code of staff was a bit too casual for my taste (please no military look)
- Lack of basic equipments in the room (working desk, chairs)
- rooms relatively small for a 5-star
- No coffee maker or kettle in room
- No bath tub, only shower
- Not offering basic services of a 5-star (like ironing board etc.)
- No gym / workout room / spa
- Breakfast in room too expensive for what it is (e.g. half a cup of cold coffee)
- WiFi only 1h per day included
- mind the advertised Notebook-safe: It's not bigger than any other in-room safe I know - that means a 15"" Laptop will fit in, anything bigger (like mine) won't
- pool on roof top is very small
- advertised bar on the roof top was always (!) closed during my 5-day-stay

----------------------------------------
Some positive aspects
----------------------------------------

As my review above might sound very negative (and in deed my personal experience was very disappointing), I still want to point out some positive aspects and give the hotel some credit:

+ A very central location from where it's easy to reach any location in Barcelona (I did not use public transport once). My tip in case you are interested in modern art: the Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona (MACBA). It's a stone's throw away from the hotel and worth seeing it.
+ My room had a small balcony (I guess most rooms do) which is always a nice (and rare) thing to have.
+ Cleanliness: the room maids did a great job. I always found my room in impeccable conditions. Unfortunately, sometimes the least paid people are doing most of the work in a hotel.
+ Room service was fast and efficient.
+ Roof top (7th floor) with bar (it was always closed during my stay) to relax. However it's difficult to relax on this kind of chairs (I've literally seen people falling off).
+ ""Pool"" - yes the hotel advertises a roof top pool, and yes: there is something that could be considered to be a pool. However don't expect it to be a ""swimming"" pool, but a good place to jump in an cool down.
+ Huge Sony Bravia screen in-room (in case you fancy it).
+ Contrary to other comments I found the space for cloth (wardrobe etc.) being adequate (at least in my room)
+ Even if I didn't consider the front desk staff resp. the management to be on a 5-star-level (see all my review above), at least they are all being friendly (even if most of the times the answer was ""no"" they would still smile at you).
+ You can connect your iPod if you have one.

----------------------------------------
Conclusion
----------------------------------------

My personal rating would be a ""3 stars superior Design Hotel"", with the ability to become a decent 4-star-hotel if they change some very basic things (see everything above). Because of its limited facilities and the lack of space in their rooms e.g. to install a desk with a chair, I don't see the possibility to become a true 5-star-hotel.",3,2011,08,03
27,Wonderful stay in Barcelona,"We looked at several hotels for our 20th anniverary break in Barcelona without kids. Chose Hotel Bagues for its location and style as well as price - good value. It was stylish and luxurios without being over the top. We splashed out booked a Jewel Suite which came, as advertised, with an enclosed balcony with Jacuzzi, sun bed and table and chairs. Decor was great although the room was smaller than expected but perfectly useable (could do with storage space for empty bags) with plenty of clothes spaces, internet connection and TV/Ipod connection (speaker on the balcony would be nice for jacuzzi music). Sliding glass doors to bathroom were very well designed with frosted panel for toilet privacy.

The hotel was small and friendly. It felt much more homely than larger ones. Just what we wanted. Restuarant food was excellent for dinner and breakfast. Staff were very approachable and helpful in organising restaurant bookings and airport taxi. Room service was generally prompt and housekeeping helpful when asked. Room was not always 'turned down' in the evenings but as we took time adjusting to the late Barcelona evening meals we were not always out of the room at the right time to do this. It didn't spoil our stay at all.

Location on Las Ramblas was perfect. 5 mins stroll to Opera House, Barri Gotica and Place Catalunya. 10 -15 mins to Cathedral and water side. Good AC and window/door seals meant any street noise was not a problem (had a side street view).

A spa facility would be good (especially as most accomodation is rooms and not suites)  but having the jacuzzi and booking the spa potions pack meant we didn't miss it. Our first time to Barcelona was excellent",4,2011,08,03
27,"Most amazing place, lovely staff.","Stay one night in this lovely hotel and it'll definitely be worth a return trip. Rooms were spacious and well appointed and the most incrediable attention to detail, with touches of Rene Macinosh and art deco designs. Bathrooms were beautiful and the view over la Ramblas was exceptional, however even better was the sound proofing that could block it out if needed. Hotel staff were incredibly helpful with everything from showing us the best place to eat late at night (just off la Ramblas is the bar Lobo) to giving us the opportunity to leave our luggage there securely after check out rather than drag it around town for the day. All in all the perfect end to any vacation, thank you very much and hope to visit again soon.",5,2011,08,01
27,Barcelona's Best Kept Secret!,"My hobby is travelling yet this is my first ever review! I just had to share the wonderful surprise we encountered when my husband and I stayed at the Hotel Bagues. I wanted to stay near or on the Ramblas, because even though it is not what it was in terms of style, the Ramblas still is in the center of Barcelona. So my location choice took out the Mandarin, Hotel Arts out of the running. Just leaving the 1898 ..Without being negative on any of these aforementioned hotels, I must say that Hotel Bagues is truly a gem! Having just being opened and with only 30+ rooms, everything is spotless, fully functional, and the staff could not be more willing to assist in any matter! Not surprising once I met the hotel's very much in attendance young manager. The hotel mgt  definitely believes in the old saying, ""God is in the details""! The latter went from the very stylish decor to the rose in the bathroom to great sound proofing! Also don't hesitate to eat at the hotel's restaurant! We did, given the great choice of restaurants in Barcelona, yet when exhausted one evening decided to stay in and found the food absolutely delicious! Having eaten at Per Se and The Fat Duck, we found the tuna tartare with wasabi ice cream to be among the best tasting dish ever! All in all...do stay at this precious place before it gets too full or the wear and tear start showing!",5,2011,07,31
27,Superbe hotel!! You get really spoiled!,"A bottle of Cava in ice on your arrival in the room, every day your room is made up twice. In the evening they make up your bed (again), you find a chocolat goodie and the weatherforcast on your bed, a little carpett next to the bed and your slippers ... Breakfast is very OK but with lots of possibilities in the neigbourhood to expensive so everbody went outside for breakfast. We took it ondce to try it out. If they make it cheaper, it will be better! (+/- 23 Euro/person) Swimming pool is cooldownpool. You can't swim in it but it's nice to relax and cool downn on the terrace roof. great view and very nice design! Superbe! Barcelona is VERY NICE (Palau Guel is a must and is nearby the hotel, opened in 2011 after several years of renovation!!)! If anybody says otherwise, he should be send to Siberia!",5,2011,07,30
27,"Comfortable, stylish and friendly","This is a very good little hotel. Single room was compact, but very well designed with plenty of wardrobe space, very comfortable bed and beautififul bathroom with rainshower. Staff very friendly and serviceminded. The hotel opened 9 months ago and prices are still good. This hotel is real competition for the Hotel 1898, just up the road and beats it hands down in most aspects in my opinion. The only reason for me to stay at the 1898 from now on would be the much larger roof terrasse. Bagues is a narrow building and the terrasse is very small and the pool only just big enough to dip. All in all a great experience!",5,2011,07,29
27,Only place to stay in Barcelona,"What a fanastic, well appointed hotel in a great location. The rooms are fantastic, no noise from the busy La Rambla below, the staff were fantastic and attentive. This hotel is great value for money. The restaurant on the ground floor serves beautiful food, although pricy well worth it. The rood top pool and bar is a real oasis.",5,2011,07,26
27,The Best,"Was lucky to have booked this hotel direct on line and enjoyed my stay enormously , it's central but has double glazing to deal with La rambla , it's so good am booking back in for the rest of my time in Barcelona , the other hotels are just not to this standard ! The staff are so helpful and cleanliness food is all top quality , it truly is 5 star the only thing is . . . hear it comes  the price ! But I guess you truly get what you pay for , this hotel has a city boutique feel with attention to detail , from Rose in room , flowers in bathroom , cherries and water on arrival , little chocs on pillow when your room is re set for the evening , all similar to other hotels but the quality is the best ! Am so looking forward to booking  back there tomorrow , wherever you staynin Barcelona I hope you enjoy it , it's a great city , you just need to have a good base to venture from and then explore , ps have had no truble with pick pockets but be careful , also there is an amazing Market on the same street as the hotel it's worth a look .",5,2011,07,22
27,Wonderful hotel,"Went for a romantic long weekend and decided on the Bagues for its location and style. Really loved the hotel, great staff, friendly and helpful, excellent bathroom, room was on the third floor on the side street overlooking the Belem church and the junction with the Rambla so with great views. Absolutely ideal location for everything - Barri Gotico, Boqueria market almost next door, beach an easy taxi or scooter ride, shopping area, and within decent reach of Sagrada Familia, Montjuic for the views from the Mirador and to visit the Miro centre and Poble Espanyol, El Born for quieter and slightly less touristy squares and cafes/bars. The staff gave great advice on bars/restaurants nearby.",5,2011,07,06
27,most beautiful hotel. wonderful staff and great location.,"This is my first time for writing a review after many years of reading!
Just arrived back from  Hotel Bagues in Barcelona.
The hotel was simply stunning, the location was perfect for getting to all the attractions and visiting the beach and harbour.
The staff are so helpful and pleasant. There is a roof top terrace which is an added bonus to sit and relax in the sun, there is only 3 loungers but this was enough as not many guests really used the roof top.
Rooms/hotel was faultless will definately stay there again and could not recommend it strongly enough! Enjoy!",5,2011,07,06
27,Great stay in an AMAZING hotel and great location in the center of everything,"Stayed at Bagues for 3 nights with my wife.  We had an excellent experience.  The hotel itself is beautiful, just impeccable.  You really can't ask for a better location, it was close to everything!!  The staff truly completed this wonderful experience they were all so helpful and pleasant to deal with.  We especially were delighted with Fabio at the front desk.  He answered each and every one of our questions (and there were many) and really took the time to guide us around the city (according to our requests) and truly did a great job at pointing us in the right direction each and every time!!!  Rafael was also very helpful.  Barcelona is an amazing city but having a great home base like Bagues truly made it even better.  I would recommend this hotel hands down!!!  We would definitely return and plan to.  Thank you!!!",5,2011,07,05
27,Nice hotel in the city center,"This hotel is within walking distance from Placa Catalunya, Las Ramblas, Gothic Quarter and main shopping streets. We also walked to the Zoo and beach, but if you don't like walking us much as we do, you could also use metro.

Our room was clean and big enough. A fresh rose by the bed and in the bathroom plus fresh strawberries made good initial impression (perhaps flowers could have been changed every other day and even some free cava and simple snacks/fruits brought to the room daily). Bed was ok (although a bit hard to my taste) and rain shower was fantastic. Enough pillows and blankets were available by default. TV was big and channel selection was sufficient (TIP: clicking sound-button in the remote changes the audio from Spanish to English.) Air condition was good and did not make unnecessary noise. 

If you like to sleep late, remember to hang the ""Don't disturb"" -sign to your door AND use the double-lock. The cleaning lady was so eager to enter our room in the mornings (without knocking even) using their own key, that without double-lock, we might have ended up having a so called awkward situation. 

Also, perhaps next time I would bring earplugs - just because there is a church next door and starting from 8 a.m. they ring the bells every now and then. Soundproofing in general could be better - our ""window"" was facing the inner corridor area but still we could hear some street noise.

Downstairs there is one computer with a printer and internet connection that can be used for free. Very convenient if you e.g. want to use online check-in to your flight or use email. Also one hour WiFi-connection is provided daily for free. 

I could stay here again although I think that this is more 4 star than 5 star hotel.",4,2011,06,06
27,Good Hotel in a Bad City,"The hotel was excellent in regards to European standards and the only saving grace for a terrible, dirty city with high crime. The staff was helpful and professional. They have nice doormen that will help you get a taxi and protect you as you enter and leave the hotel. Important for Barcelona. The front desk was also helpful although limited in regards to helping you plan day trips. The rooms were very nice indeed for a European hotel, so they were beyond expectations, with a great bathroom. The most important aspect was a safe large enough to hold all you valuables as you will not want to walk Barcelona with more then a few Euros in your front pocket. The question with this city is not if but when you will become a victim of crime. The complicity of the criminals with the police was varified by many of the locals. The hotel provides a nice breakfast in the am as well. So if you must stay in Barcelona for any reason, then this is a very good hotel indeed. The rooms were quiet and clean and very comfortable. The downside is that there are no external windows, however, perhaps this is best for noise reduction. So in total, good hotel in a downright dangerous 3rd world city.",4,2011,06,04
27,"Amazing Service, AMAZINGLY helpful front desk, awesome location","I have lived in Europe for half a year and have now visited for another month and could not be happier with my stay here. All the remarks regarding their poor breakfast buffet are justified, but this is a common characteristic of some expensive hotels in Europe. And philips excuse of quality over quantity is BS. 

The staff could not be any nicer, or more helpful. That said, they should advertise their restaurant more, and perhaps have a sign in the front attracting people to their food, as opposed to a stand with a small menu similar to many awful restaurant on rambla. Also they appeared to be fixing the terrace pool while we stayed at Bagues, but it was a poor excuse of a pool and not so nice a terrace. Finally, this is the first time I have checked the comments on the hotel, and all i can say is please get someone other than Felipe Turell to reply to peoples comments. 

Awesome place, but dont stay here for an amazing breakfast and please let me know if you find an amazing breakfast place in Spain. But do stay here if you want a reasonable room, friendly staff, and quality service, at a decent price.",5,2011,06,03
27,Classy hotel very well located,Modernised/renovated hotel with good facilities and easy access. Lights in bedrooms could have been a bit brighter. We had a room on the side and it was surprisingly quiet. Very friendly staff .,5,2011,05,31
27,"Best location, nice jewel","Location is one of the best, if you like The Rambla, you better choose this hotel. I would call it a small boutique hotel. Very friendly staff, the room we had was small, enough though for a couple with a small baby. It is very modern, some nice details. The bathroom is very elegant with the best rainshower ever.
There is a rooftop lappool with a nice terrace overlooking the city.
Breakfast was not included and I thought it was a rather small buffet. We enjoyed going to the Rambla for all our meals.
I would definitely come back to this hotel, the price we paid was also very reasonable for the superb location.",4,2011,05,30
27,Great hotel in wonderful location,"The staff in the hotel were very helpful.  When we arrived, we were offered a choise of two rooms, one with a view of the ramblas or a quiter room facing the internal part of the hotel.  We chose the quiter room which was also slightly larger.  The rooms aren't 100% soundproof but neither of us had any difficulty sleeping at night.

The room was beautiful and the hotel had left strawberries and a bottle of water to welcome us on arrival.  Chocolates were also left on our bed each night with the temeperatures for the next day which was a nice touch.  The bathroom had an amazing rain shower and toiletries were replenished each day. The staff were very helpful and any requests were immediately attended to e.g. more towels, room service.

The location was great, within walking distance to la barceloneta as well as the passeig de gracia and right of placa de catalunya.  Also, you are 2 minutes from the metro.  We did not eat in the hotel as there are so many wonderful restaurants in the area but the menu looked nice and there was 24 hour room service which was handy.  One thing, the pool on the roof isn't a pool for swimming in, just relaxing.",5,2011,05,09
27,Not our style,"This is not a hotel we would stay at again.  Some of things we liked about it were:  helpful and friendly front desk and housekeeping staff.  The location is really great if you want to be right in the middle of the action.  Great shower. It is clean and modern.

Some of things we didn't care for:  street noise was an issue - no surprise since our room was facing the street (on the 4th floor). Others love the bathroom but it was not for us.  A bathroom with a clear glass door looks sleek and modern, but allows no privacy when getting out of the shower.  Also, a person can easily walk right into it when the lights are dim as my husband did on a few occasions - it got a little annoying after a while. It can be difficult to tell if the door is all the way closed or ajar.
Lastly, our rate included breakfast.  It was fine.  They apparently charge $30 for this breakfast.  It was not a $30 breakfast.",3,2011,04,30
27,Fantastic Hotel - can't recommend it enough!,"My boyfriend and I have just returned from a 5 night stay at this superb hotel and we are already missing the hotel and Barcelona!

From the moment we arrived we were made to feel incredibly welcome and were given a brilliant introduction to Barcelona and the sights, and advice and tips to make the most of our stay. We were upgraded to a deluxe room with views on to both La Rambla and of Església de Betlem. 

The room was beautiful with very modern design which from the photographs online I thought may be bit dark but was actually very light and open. We were welcomed with fresh strawberries and a bottle of water. There was a fresh red rose in the bedroom and bathroom. The bathroom was stunning and we were provided with bath robes, slippers and luxury toiletries. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in!

The roof top terrace had spectacular views of Barcelona. It isn't a huge terrace but we went up a few times and never saw anyone else up there! 

The hotel only has 31 rooms and although not a small building it had a very intimate feel and was never very busy. Breakfast times were very relaxed and also not busy. The food available for breakfast was lovely with buffet choices of fresh pastries, fruit, salmon, cheese, charcuterie, cereal and yoghurt or the choice of hot plate breakfast of bacon, sausage, eggs and vegetables. Over our stay we sampled most options and all were delicious!

We were on the second floor and although occasionally we could hear some noise from La Rambla it was to be expected with the close proximity and it did not disturb us - even on the night Barcelona won the first leg of the Champions League semi-final!

Obviously the location speaks for itself-right on La Rambla giving you the atmosphere of Barcelona as well as easy access to all the sights. The hotel is also very handy for the metro station Liceu.

We will definitely return to this hotel if or more likely when we next return to Barcelona and have already starting recommending it to friends and family! We are already researching their sister hotel for a future trip we have planned in London as we were so impressed with this hotel.",5,2011,04,29
27,"Great location, cool rooms, friendly staff and free sweets in the lobby!","A beautiful building that has been very tastfully transformed into a lovely boutique hotel. Staff were very friendly and keen to help. The room was great, with a fab bathroom, with the added extra of a piece of art on display in the room. Roof terrace was good, although the pool was very small (and cold!). It was slightly expensive, but all in all was worth it. I would go back there again in a heartbeat. Only small niggle we had was that we were offered a complementary drink at the bar, but ended up having to pay for it when we checked out.",5,2011,04,27
27,Fantastic Hotel,"My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights over the Easter weekend, we had a fantastic stay in this hotel, our room overlooked La Rambla and although you can hear a bit of noise it certainly wasn't loud enough to be an issue. The room itself was gorgeous, and the bathroom was absolutely stunning. The staff were very friendly and helpful and would do all they could to help you. I would definitely recommend this hotel",5,2011,04,27
27,Perfect Hotel in a perfect location!,"We spent 8 nights in Hotel Bagues and can't say enough good things about it.  The staff are are very friendly and helpful, who are happy to help in whatever way they can.  The breakfast was beyond delightful and the perfect start to each day.",5,2011,04,24
27,Super ! We loved it !,"This hotel is super! The staff is very helpfull and friendly. If there's something 'wrong' or not satisfying they do something about it immediatly. the food is perfect. the breakfast looks not much because there aren't full plates, but that's because everything is fresh and is refilled very frequently, so there is plenty for everybody and freshly made all the time. the beds are great. the rooms aren't soundproof 100%, but it's not disturbing at all, let's say 90% soundproof. the location couldn't be better. we had the jewel-suite and there's just 1 thing which wasn't so 'jewel' about it and that was the privacy. we had the private terras with jacuzzi, but people on the swimfloor could watch us when they looked over the balcony of the swimterrace. the cocktails in the hotel couldn't be made as they should be because the guy who made them didn't had the right equipment for it (like a blender) but he did his upmost best to make them as perfect as possible.
we had our honeymoon over there, and we strongly can recommend this hotel to everybody who wants a perfect hotel at Barcelona.",5,2011,04,19
27,Great hotel!,"Really lovely hotel, tastefully decorated. Although on busy La Rambla , noise never bothered us , our room was on the fourth floor at the front of the building and we loved the atmosphere of the street. The staff were very friendly and always helpful. Great location for exploring the city.
Our deal included breakfast and would recommend doing this if available.",5,2011,04,08
27,"Excellent rooms, location and service.","My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Hotel Bagues. The room was beautiful with comfy bed and fancy bathroom with lovely toiletries.
Service was great and location was excellent. We did not have any issues with street noise but we stayed Monday to Thursday and not at a weekend. We would definitely stay there again and I am recommending it to all my friends and family. Thank you for a wonderful experience and memories of Barcelona.",5,2011,04,04
27,Very good (but can do better),"We stayed in the hotel during the week-end from 25 to 28 March and the overall impression was quite good: good ambiance, apealing design, confortable rooms, nice meal space, very good restaurant, central location. The staff was in general kind and helpful.
We were at the 2nd floor and the enthousiasm of the crowd in the streets particularly during the night from Sat to Sun was quite audible, but we cannot blame the hotel for it. I missed some common amenities in a 5 star hotel: the Wi-Fi connection was not operational (even if the staff provided me with a free password). The choice of TV channels was rather limited (mostly in Spanish and Catalan) and video on demand was not available. 
Despite the remarks above we enjoyed our stay at Bagues and we would certainly consider it in a forthcoming visit.",4,2011,04,03

27,Wonderful Stay,"My boyfriend and I just returned from a wonderful 4-day stay in Barcelona. Small Luxury Hotels are our preferred home bases for travel, and this location did not disappoint. 

HIghlights include:
*Comfortable bed
*Quiet room with balcony facing Calle Carme (windows block out most noise, except for occasional hoots)
*Roomy bathroom with excellent water pressure
*Delicious food (especially breakfast and the candy selection at the door)
*Friendly, attentive staff
*Excellent location
*Overall, a quiet hotel

The only drawbacks are that you must pay for wireless internet (the first hour each day is free), and the decor is a little on the dark side, both of which will not prevent us from returning. We will certainly be back at this hotel the next moment we can!",5,2011,03,17
27,Treat yourself to a stay at Hotel Bagues!,My husband and l have just returned from a three night stay at Hotel Bagues.The hotel is in a great location on La Rambla.We stayed in a double room and initially when l saw the room l was slightly disappointed with the size but really it was more than adequate and the room and furnishings are finished to a very high standard.This is a very stylish hotel.The rooftop area is lovely but again the pool is rather small.We found the staff in the hotel to be superb.Nothing was too much trouble.We ate in the hotel restaurant on two of the nights and the food and service was just fab.We would have liked a tiny bit more choice on the menu.There is a lot of seafood and my husband is not a seafood fan so really it was just a choice of steak for him.There is a bigger choice on the room service menu so maybe include a chicken dish or two.Really these are only tiny points and overall it was super.We would stay here again in a heartbeat.We came away relaxed and feeling this is a very special place to stay.,5,2011,03,01
27,Fabulous Spanish hosting,"Location is great, if you like being on Las Ramblas and half way between the beach and Eixample area, great for shops and Gaudi.  Service is brilliant as soon as you enter, I asked for a great tapas for the evening meal and they suggested the one I had just been to for lunch, now that's good service!  We were also delayed due to the snow in the uk and our flight was cancelled, this was not a problem to the hotel who gave us the same room at a better rate we had booked, they also allowed us a late checkout at 4pm.  The Hotel is brand new, you would never know with the service we received.  The hotel is also right next to the Boquera markets, which has fantastic food shopping and brilliant seafood bars.

Our room was gorgeous, comfortable beds, sheets, glamorous black tiled bathrooms and fancy toiletries.  We loved it!  It is a wonderful boutique hotel and would definitely stay again.",5,2011,01,06
27,Very nice and luxurious hotel.,"Afther we saw the reactions on tripadvisor we were a bit afraid what we could aspect. But the hotel was great. Very nice room, good breakfast, friendly staff, nice pool on the roof, ... only the noise of the Rambla at night. It's a fact that you can hear a lott of noise during the night. That's the only remark we can make. We can curtanly advise this hotel.",4,2011,01,02
27,Unique experience,"Having recently spent 3 nights on our honeymoon in Hotel Bagues I must admit we were impressed. We had originally booked to stay in Hotel Claris (the sister hotel) however on arrival in Hotel Claris we were told we were being moved to Bagues as Claris was having problems with 15 of its rooms. So we arrived at Bagues knowing nothing at all about it and unaware of anything to do with the hotel. The location is perfect, you are right on Las Ramblas. The hotel itself is small however it is a hotel I have never seen anything like before!! There is jars of sweets in the hotel lobby that you can help yourself to. The lifts are glass which I thought was really nice. The room itself was small enough but the tv in the room was huge and the bathroom was lovely. Our room wasn't facing the street so was nice and quite at night and we got great sleeps. On our first night there we received a bottle of champagne & strawberries complimentary as soon as they found out we were on honeymoon which was really a lovely touch! Also, ever day you are left an update with the weather for the next day in your room to allow you to plan for the next day. All in all, we enjoyed our stay in hotel Bagues :)",4,2010,12,04
27,Don't spoil your trip,"We booked the hotel for 4 days to stay in. We decided  to choose Bagues because of it's location (at Ramblas) and because it is a Small Luxury hotel chain, hotels of which usually are quite good. But not this time. The hotel was open in begin of November. When we arrived to the hotel it was almost midnight and doors were closed! We had to wait some 5-10 min till the personnel noticed that there are some guests at the door. By the way, on that night we were only guests at the hotel and during the booking process we informed that we will arrive after 11 pm.

We realised that the location was a curse of the hotel immediately: it was extremly noisy in the rooms (the noise from streets) and we didn¨t sleep very well at the first night and we couldn¨t sleep at the second night at all (and I have to say that we are from Moscow, so we are used to the noise). After second night we decided to change a hotel. We discussed with the hotel manager about a cancellation of the rest 2 nights, but even we are members of the Small Luxury Hotel and it was their fault that we had to change a hotel the manager decided to keep 1 extra night as a penalty for the cancellation. 

Rooms are very small (we stayed in Deluxe DBL), no place for the clothes or other luggage and  even it is unbeliavable, but beds are shorter than usually (at least in our room). They don't have wi-fi. Room service was slow. Shelves were covered with dust.",1,2010,11,10
27,Good,The excellent location. Bed too narrow and short for two people. Nice decoration. Friendly staff,3,2024,05,20
27,centrally located on the Rambla,"Room 602 was great, the terrace was a good size, breakfast was excellent, staff were very friendly and helpful, the bartender was competent and very friendly, the two elevators were OK but very noisy, which was disturbing at night.",5,2023,11,06
27,Nice short stay,We stayed at the Hotel Bagues for 2 nights over the weekend. The hotel has a great central location right on Las Ramblas. The rooms are small but very nice. I particularly liked the great roof terrace with pool where we spent our evenings. The staff is very accommodating. We would love to come back.,5,2023,10,30
27,5 STARS! A little too much.,"When customers enter and exit the rooms, the doors slam and if you were sleeping you wake up with a start. The toilet lacks the intimate cleanser, the toilet brush, the classic toothbrush with toothpaste, and the bathroom light placed under the tub always remains on, so you can't stay totally in the dark as the bathroom door is made of glass. To turn the lamps on and off it is a problem to locate the switch. They advertise their swimming pool, but in reality it is a tub where at most you can get your legs wet. I asked for 2 towels for the beach and they asked me for a deposit of 30 euros, absurd for a structure that boasts 5 stars. Buffet breakfast, poor. The à la carte one a little better. The staff is friendly but not very helpful. Too many strict rules that do not solve the needs of the guests. Very small superior rooms. If you don't like the room, they don't offer you to see or choose another one, which is truly unique. Very austere atmosphere, the staff smile very little. On the other hand, the positive things are the hygiene of the rooms and of the entire structure, the cleaning staff is very efficient and helpful. In short, I would say that we are not there as 5 stars. I would say a sufficient 4 stars.",3,2023,08,05

La camera era piuttosto rumorosa e con un letto piccolissimo ed inadatto a persone piu alte di 160 cm. Abbiamo dormito decisamente male.I prodotti da bagno sono dozzinali al pari della carta da wc.Colazione mediocre per scelta e qualitá.Abbiamo comunque apprezzato moltissimo la gentilezza e la professionalitá del desk manager italiano che ci ha fatto il check out.Questo ha reso meno insoddisfacente il nostro soggiorno.",3,2019,09,11

Se encuentra en un muy bonito edificio y las instalaciones están en perfecto estado. Cuenta con un bar y una pequeña piscina en la azotea, también cuenta con un pequeño museo modernista y ofrecen acceso gratuito al museo egipcio de Barcelona. El trato del personal es muy amable y eficaz. La única pega que se le puede poner es el tamaño, ya que al tratarse de un hotel pequeño, hay aspectos y servicios que se pueden resentir en cierta medida, así, las habitaciones son un poco pequeñas, la piscina del ático también es un poco pequeña y la sala de desayunos, bar y restaurante, que es la misma, queda poco independientes de la zona de recepción. De todas formas es una muy buena opción para un alojamiento de lujo teniéndolo todo a mano.",5,2019,08,22

Oggettivamente la stanza è più piccola della norma quindi potrebbe dispiacere se si vuole ampio spazio ma credo che sia una questione personale e nel mio caso non influenza il punteggio dato. Isolamento acustico tra le stanze e l’ esterno è ottima, ma a volte si sentono rumori dal corridoio, niente di sconvolgente in quanto ambiente molto tranquillo. Ottima posizione.",5,2019,08,22

27,Perfekt - sehr freundlich - Zentral - ausgesprochen hilfsbereites Personal - Rundum-Betreut-Feeling,"Wir bewohnten für 5 Nächte das Doppel-Deluxe-Eckzimmer Nr. 203
Das Zimmer war sehr gut ausgestattet, mit allem was das Herz begehrt, ausser einem kleinen Arbeitstisch für Laptop und Mauspad der fehlte, dafür gab es einen grossen, sehr bequemen Ottomanen. 
Ein kleiner Mangel war das Fehlen eines Sitzpolster für die beiden Stufen der zwei Balkontüren. Da der Balkon nur ca. 50 cm Tief, aber sehr lang ist, gibt es keinen Platz für Stühle um sich hinsetzen zu können. Der Blick auf die Rambla und seitlich auf die Parròquia de la Mare de Déu de Betlem lädt zum Verweilen ein, wenn die geeigneten Stufen nicht so hart wären. 
Die Mini-Bar liess keine Wünsche offen. Sogar die Champagner-Gläser wurden rein gestellt, damit sie schön kühl sind.
Der allabendliche Aufdeck-Service brachte auch das Bad und das Zimmer wieder in Ordnung, wenn es tagsüber benutzt wurde. Klasse !!!
Die Dachterrasse mit grosszügigen Sitzgruppen, Liegestühlen, Bar und Swimmingpool bot einen wunderschönen Ausblick auf Barcelona.
Das gesamte Hotelpersonal war überaus zuvorkommend, sehr freundlich und ausgesprochen Hilfsbereit. 
Kleiner Wermuts-Tropfen. Die Klima-Anlage im Empfangsbereich und in der angrenzenden Bar war viel zu kalt eingestellt. Dies wurde jedoch ein wenig behoben.
An der Rezeption wurden all die kleinen Probleme, welche man als Gast einer Grossstadt hat, im Nu erledigt. Egal ob es sich um eine Restaurant-Buchung, oder das Auffinden eines Geschäfts für Einkäufe, Friseur-Salon oder andere Dinge handelte. Kurz, wir durften für ein 5* Hotel einen sehr hohen Level geniessen.

Ich kann diese Haus jedem aus Überzeugung bestens Empfehlen.",4,2018,09,18
27,Excelente atención,"Las instalaciones son buenas y está muy bien ubicado, queda cerca de todos los lugares turísticos de la ciudad. Lo mejor es la atención del personal que nos ayudó durante toda la estancia. En relación precio-calidad es perfecto. ",5,2018,09,03
27,Nel cuore della Rambla con cura degli ospiti,Non sono un amante degli alberghi 5 stelle perché spesso non hanno un’anima. L'hotel burgues invece ce l’ha ed è un’anima molto elegante e  ricercata. Ogni dettaglio in questo albergo è pensato con cura e anche il servizio è inappuntabile. Un’oasi di bellezza e gentilezza nel cuore della Rambla caotica e a tratti volgare nel senso etimologico.,5,2018,08,14
27,Relax in piena rambla,"Centralissimo. Camere molto ben arredate e molto ben insonorizzate verso la rambla, forse un po' meno verso la scala interna in caso di vicini di stanza privi di attenzioni nei confronti degli altri ospiti. Bagno ampio e completo.Servizi sempre molto presenti anche se i tempi di reazione sono piuttosto lenti soprattutto al roof bar, che è molto carino con la piccola piscina ove cercare rinfresco nella calda Barcelona. Colazione ricca e per tutti i gusti, senza ostentazione e troppi sprechi in una zona che si trova praticamente nella hall dell'hotel e questo non a tutti può piacere. Temperatura nei luoghi comuni troppo fredda rispetto a quella esterna, ma sono consapevole che a molti piace così. Complessivamente un soggiorno molto positivo. Consigliato.",4,2018,06,30
27,Fantastico,"Fantastico hotel. El bar deberia abrir hasta mas tarde. Muy bonito, ubicacion excelente, personal muy amable. Moderno, limpio, muy bien ubicado, en la mejor ubicacion de la ciudad, edificio emblematico.

",5,2018,04,15
27,Decisamente al di sopra delle aspettative!!!,"Sono appena rientrato da un week end a Barcellona ed ho avuto il piacere di soggiornare in questo boutique hotel, e ne sono rimasto felice per svariati aspetti:
1 - Posizione proprio affacciato sulla Rambla quindi in pieno centro, peraltro avevo la finestra sulla Rambla e di notte non sentivo nulla, quindi ottima insonorizzazione dei serramenti
2 - Nonostante la non grandezza delle camere, gli arredi sono ben studiati per dare spazio e comodità
3 - Amenità davvero ottime
4 - Colazione molto buona e con anche servizio alla carta oltre che al buffet
5 - Personale ECCELLENTE, molto disponibile ed educato, sempre pronto a soddisfare ogni richiesta.

Vi racconto solo un aneddoto per farvi capire quanto sono attenti al cliente. L'ultimo giorno io rientravo in italia con al nave che partiva alle 22.30 da BCN, appena arrivato in hotel alle 20.30 (dopo aver fatto check-out per le 12.00) per ritirare la valigie, il personale ha capito che ero stato in giro tutto il giorno e mi ha proposto di farmi una doccia e cambiarmi, io non ho sfruttato l'occasione ma è stato un piacere ricevere questa opportunità. Da ciò si capisce quanto il personale è attento agli ospiti.

E' un 5 stelle boutique quindi ovvio è un piccolo hotel ma gestito veramente bene.",5,2017,11,30
27,Espectacular,"Este hotel es sensacional por varios motivos: su ubicación inmejorable en las Ramblas, por la calidez de sus habitaciones, por el trato que recibimos durante la estancia y por otros muchos pequeños detalles que hacen de este un hotel perfecto para vuestra visita a Barcelona.
Lo recomiendo activamente.",5,2017,09,26
27,EXCELENTE!!!,"Muy buen hotel, excelente ubicacion. excelente sus intalaciones. Decoracion moderna. Muy buena limipieza, amenities, silencioso. Muy agradable. Super recomendable. Volveria sin dudarlo. La atencion de todos muy buena. No he desayunado en el hotel porque me parecio caro ese servicio. Pero sales a la calle y tienes muchisimas opciones para degustar un rico desayuno. Se encuentra a metros del mercado de la boqueria, un excelente lugar para comer platos tipicos del lugar y hacer compras.",5,2017,08,16
27,Que horror,"Que desastre de hotel. No hay luz en las habitaciones porque dan a un patio interior, patio que da con la sala de comensales por lo que si abres la ventana oyes todas las conversaciones da igual la planta en la que estés. La piscina de arriba es pequeña e insignificante y el servicio del hotel malísimo. NO repetiría nunca.",1,2017,05,12
27,Muy recomendable ,"Edificio antiguo con mucha historia , era una joyería famosa de Barcelona . Se recicló se construyó este hotel boutique muy lindo . Decoración distinta .. las habitaciones un poco reducidas al menos la que fui que era una doble superior . De todas maneras tenía un balcón sobre la rambla muy bonito . La ubicación muy buena a dos cuadras del famoso barrio gótico  a algunas cuadras de la costa y a 5 cuadras de la plaza Cataluña .. . El desayuno correcto, la atención muy amable .. fue una linda experiencia .! ",4,2017,05,07
27,Week-end romantico,"Struttura e posizione di alta qualità. Il servizio e l'attenzione ai particolari potrebbero essere migliore: visto lo standing dell'hotel (5 stelle) ed il costo, l'accoglienza potrebbe esser più curata e la camera essere predisposta meglio (fiori, frutta, etc.). E' stata comunque una bella esperienza, confermata dopo l'ultima volta di quattro anni fa.
",4,2017,04,15
27,2 noches ,"Muy bien ubicado, agradable ambiente, la atención es buen, definitivamente más atentos que en otros hoteles 5 estrellas. 
La habitación daba a la rambla lo que lo hacía bastante movida pero no incomodaba a la hora de descansar. 
El metro debe pasar debajo del hotel por qué se siente la vibración lo q hace muy particular y hasta simpático ese momento. El desayuno es bueno y sobre todo el croissant que según entiendo son hechos en casa. ",5,2017,03,26
27,Luxushotel in Top-Lage,"Kleines, exklusiv eingerichtetes Hotel direkt an den Ramblas. Der Service war sehr nett und aufmerksam! Die Zimmer sehr schön eingerichtet, Holzfußboden und eine Chaiselonge machen den Raum sehr gemütlich! Die Rose im Badezimmer als Aufmerksamkeit hat mir sehr gut gefallen! Das Bett war sehr bequem! Das Bad war ausreichend groß und sehr modern gestaltet. 
Fast das Beste sind die Fenster! Wenn diese geschlossen sind, hört man absolut keinen Lärm mehr von draußen! Weder Autos, noch die 'Party people', noch die Kirchenglocken! 
Ein sehr schöner Aufenthalt! Wir kommen sehr gern wieder!",5,2017,03,16
27,hotel sempre bello,Piu' volte ho soggiornato in questo hotel . E' posizionato sulla rambla ma perfettamente insonorizzato. Ottima accoglienza .Camere molto belle.Purtroppo quest anno c'e' stato un problema con il bagno ed  hanno cercato di risolverlo con uno spray deodorante....un po' deludente perche' passato l effetto il cattivo odore ovviamente e' tornato.

27,Ottimo,"Bellissimo hotel situato sulla rambla cuore nevralgico di Barcellona, accoglienza splendida, camera molti comoda, non eccessivamente spaziosa, bagno completo con bidet, colazione forse un filino sotto le aspettative ma nel complesso buona.

27,Hotel Bagues Barcelona,"Wir hatten für einen Wochenendtrip von Freitag - Sonntag 2 Übernachtungen in der Jewel Suite gebucht. Sehr schönes Zimmer, alles sehr sauber und super zentrale Lage des Hotels. Über den Preis der Suite mit über 500,-- € pro Nacht lässt sich sicherlich streiten. Das Restaurant haben wir nicht getestet. Die Mitarbeiter an der Rezeption waren stets freundlich und hilfsbereit. Bei Ankunft begleitete uns eine Mitarbeiterin auf unser Zimmer, um uns alles zu zeigen und zu erklären. Insgesamt haben wir uns aber sehr gut aufgehoben gefühlt und würden das Hotel wieder wählen. ",5,2016,10,10
27,Señor,"No es un cinco estrellas, pero cobran como si lo fuera. Las habitaciones son pequeñas y muy mal diseñadas. El hotel está en una zona muy ruidosa  y sucia.

27,Hotel impresionante !!!!,"Hace unos días me alojé en éste céntrico Hotel de Barcelona, y pude comprobar que si puedo no dudaré en repetir la experiencia. Se trata de un Hotel situado en medio de Las Ramblas y al lado del casco antiguo de la ciudad. Lo que querría destacar fue el servicio recibido por todos los trabajadores, ya que fue inmejorable. También cené en el restaurante del mismo hotel, que se llama El Regulador, y tanto la comida y el vino, acerté bastante con lo que escogí de la carta. En resumen, un Hotel 5 que si puedo en el futuro, volveré seguro !!!!",5,2016,09,02

27,Feines Luxushotel an den Ramblas,"Ein sehr schönes Hotel, lässiger Service, der manchmal die Grenze zur Nachlässigkeit überschreitet. Die Zimmer sind geschmackvoll eingerichtet, nicht besonders groß, dafür aber zum Teil mit Balkon.
Auch wenn das Hotel im quirligsten Teil der Stadt liegt, findet man hier aufgrund der schalldichten Fenster (und der Klimaanlage) einen ruhigen Schlaf. Zu Begrüßung gab es auf dem Zimmer Pralinen und eine Flasche Rotwein.
Das Frühstück im Hotel habe ich nicht zu mir genommen - in ca. 200 Metern Entfernung ist der Mercado de la Boqueria mit einer fantastischen Auswahl für jedwede Mahlzeit des Tages.
Der Pool auf der Dachterrasse ist eigentlich lediglich ein plunge pool und zum schwimmen nicht geeignet - wohl aber zur Abkühlung.
Die Bar auf der Dachterrasse, die nach meiner Erinnerung lediglich abends geöffnet ist, ist ein angenehmer Ort für ein oder zwei Drinks. Kleine Auswahl und das Personal lässt sich auch gerne zweimal bitten.
Aber alles in allem ein sehr schönes Hotel in ausgezeichneter Lage.",4,2016,07,26
27,Gran hotel con ubicación inmejorable,"Extraordinario el servicio, la atención y todo el personal es muy amable y servicial. Los cuartos muy bien equipados y sobre todo bonitos.

27,Schönes Hotel in sehr guter Lage,Wir waren mit unseren beiden Kindern und drei Hunden Gäste im Hotel Bagues. Das Personal war tierlieb und versuchte unseren Aufenthalt so angenehm wie möglich zu machen. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und gehen gerne wieder in das Bagues.,5,2016,06,07
27,Sehr gut aufgehoben in zentraler Lage,"Obwohl wir regelmäßig in Hotels dieser Kategorie buchen, stach das Bagues im Vergleich zu anderen deutlich hervor. Zwar sind die Zimmer (Barelona typisch) eher kleiner, aber der Service, die Atmosphäre und die Aufmerksamkeit der Mitarbeiter ist kaum zu übertreffen. Hier wurde sehr gut geschult, das Ganze wird jedoch sehr authentisch umgesetzt und wirkt dabei nicht erzwungen. Dieses beginnt beim namentlichen Begrüßen und Verabschieden beim Betreten und Verlassen des Hotels, über die Unterstützung bei den individuellen Shoppingwünschen bis hin zum Roomservice. Hier wird individuell auf die Bedürfnisse der Gäste eingegangen. Top! ",5,2016,05,18

27,Schönes Hotel,"Sehr schönes, kleines Hotel an perfekter Lage. Die Mitarbeiter an der Rezeption waren super freundlich und sehr hilfsbereit. Einziger Minuspunkt war das Zimmer, extrem klein, keine Aussicht geschweige denn Tageslicht, die Klimaanlage funktionierte nicht und das Fenster konnte man nicht offen lassen, da einem sonst jeder direkt vom Gang ins Zimmer schauen konnte. Im Bad hat meine keine Möglichkeit das Badetuch zur zweit Benützung aufzuhängen, es hatte im ganzen Zimmer nur einen kleinen Abfallkübel und der stand im Bad. Im Schrank sollte mal abgestaubt werden, es hatte Büschel von Staub welcher sich dann auch im Zimmer verteilte.",3,2016,03,29
27,Excelencia en todos los detalles y en la atención,"Es  excelente la ubicación sobre La Rambla, a un paso de la Plaça de Catalunya. Muy buena la ambientación, así como los servicios y la atención del personal. El desayuno (opcional) es de primera calidad, así como la provisión de bolsa de picnic para viajes. En la habitación todo es de primera calidad, incluyendo los muy buenos amenities.",5,2016,03,25
27,Ottima esperienza ,"L'hotel è situato sulla Rambla e quindi in posizione strategica per muoversi in tutta la città.
Le camere sono molto belle e curate, spaziose e luminose decorate in modo molto elegante.
Anche il bagno è degno di un 5 stelle.
Apprezzata la bottiglia di ottimo vino spagnolo offerto la prima sera per un aperitivo in camera.
L'accoglienza è stata ottima con la concierge che ci ha dato ottimi spunti per il week end.
Due piccoli appunti.
Il letto è un po' corto per chi è più di 180 cm.
L'altro è che sotto l'hotel passa la metropolitana ed ogni volta si fa sentire!

27,EN EL LUGAR PERFECTO,"Lujoso hotel en pleno centro de Barcelona, (La Rambla)en uno de los mejores lugares que podrías escoger, cerca de las playas, cerca de sus principales avenidas y mejores tiendas, museos,monumentos en fin desde aquí podrás desplazarte andando para visitar BCN.
Ademas en este hotel disfrutaras de su fantástica terraza junto con su restaurante creativo donde degustaras platos llenos de sabor y colorido.
buen ambiente y mejor servicio.",5,2016,02,14
27,Ein Juwel,"Wir waren für einen kurzen Wochenendtrip im Bagues und waren restlos begeistert. Die zentrale Lage an La Rambla erlaubt es den Gästen innerhalb weniger Schritte im Gothic Quarter, am Placa de Catalunya/Passeig de Gracia oder am Hafen zu sein. Das gesamte Hotelinterieur ist sehr chic und man erkennt in allen Bereichen den Bezug zum Juweliershaus Bagues. Da das Hotel nur über 31 Zimmer verfügt ist ein kleines Team vor Ort und kümmert sich sehr individuell um jeden Gast. Im Vorfeld haben wir durch das Concierge Team sehr gute Restaurant Empfehlung bekommen (Pia, Martinez). Unser Zimmer war direkt an der Ecke gelegen und bot einen wunderbaren Blick auf La Rambla, doch dank der wunderbar schalldichten Fenster drang auch Samstag Nacht kein Lärm ins Zimmer. Ein Highlight ist die Rooftop Bar mit einem kleinen Plunge Pool. Wenn wir wieder nach Barcelona kommen, kommen wir wieder ins Hotel Bagues zurück.",5,2016,02,09
27,"Sehr schönes, kleines Boutique-Hotel an der Rambla","Das Hotel liegt im oberen Teil der sehr lebendigen Rambla. Es verzichtet auf den üblichen Pomp eines 5*- Hauses, wartet dafür aber mit ausserordentlich schön gestalteten Zimmern und Bädern auf, eben ein Boutique-Hotel. Wir wurden sehr freundlich empfangen. Unser Zimmer im 2. OG hatte einen Balkon mit seitlicher Sicht auf die Rambla. Trotz der sehr zentralen Lage an der unüberhörbaren Rambla sind die Zimmer beim Schliessen der gut isolierten Balkontüren sehr ruhig! 
Erwähnenswert ist auch die sehr schöne Dachterrasse mit kleinem Pool und einer Bar, welche mit Blick über die Dächer von Barcelona und auf die Rambla zum Schlummertrunk nach dem Ausgang einlädt! (Die Dachterrasse ist durchgehend geöffnet, die Bar abends (angeblich nur während den Sommermonaten bedient).
 
Ich würde jederzeit wieder in dieses Hotel gehen. Die Zimmer nicht sehr gross, dafür aber ausserordentlich schön eingerichte.

Es empfiehlt sich, kein Zimmer im 1.OG zu buchen. Die beiden Zimmer dort haben keinen Balkon und lediglich nur je ein ca. 1.00 m hohes Rundbogenfenster, welches sich zudem nicht öffnen lässt. Die Zimmer sind jedoch gleich gross wie die darüberliegenden und auch gleich schön eingerichtet.

Das Hotel ist unter dem Namen Bagués bei den Taxifahrern noch nicht sehr bekannt. Es ist deshalb empfehlenswert, sich die Adresse des Hotels - La Rambla 105 - zu merken.",5,2016,01,14
27,Restaurante excepcional y excelente ubicación hotel con alta calidad,"Esta en plena Rambla de Cataluña y desde allí caminando se puede disfrutar del centro de la ciudad, visitar el mercado de la Boqueria, ir al Liceu, y pasear tranquilamente hacia la Plaza de Cataluña y luego por Paseo de Gracia con las mejores marcas de lujo de todo el mundo y ahora mejor estamos en rebajas...

27,"Ein schönes Hotel, direkt an der Rambla.","Man sollte darauf achten, dass man ein Zimmer zur Rambla bekommt; ansonsten hat man keine Aussicht. Die Fenster sind derart gut isoliert, dass man von dem Treiben auf der Rambla nichts hört. Das Servicepersonal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend.Wir waren bereits zum 2.mal Gast und würden immer wiederkommen.                             Kleine Mängel: es fehlt ein Schreibtisch.

Il bagno carino con i prodotti buoni per il corpo e i capelli.
Carina anche se piccola la terrazza sul tetto( peccato che dopo mezzanotte resta chiusa a chiave e non si può prendere un drink ne fumare una sigaretta)

Il personale è molto accogliente, gentile e competente. Tutti sono adorabili e servizievoli: cercheranno sempre di aiutarvi in tutto e per tutto onde rendervi il più piacevole possibile il soggiorno. 

La colazione all'albergo è eccellente! Eleganza unita a raffinatezza e buon gusto fanno del ristorante un vero e proprio gioiello. Abbiamo assaporato un’ospitalità veramente spiccata.

L'hotel è molto carino, il servizio buono e lo staff molto disponibile. Considerando la classificazione 5 stelle però trovo che le camere seppur belle , curate e molto pulite siano un po' piccole (il letto in particolare). Area fitness inesistente ed area benessere un po' povera (sempre in considerazione della categoria 5 stelle). Non esiste un bar ed un ristorante ma un unica area in cui vengono svolti tutti i servizi ristoranti (dalla colazione alla cena).il buffet della prima colazione dovrebbe essere un po migliorato nell assortimento dei prodotti da forno.

27,Kein Besuch wert,"Mein Aufenthalt war am 19.10.2014 und sollte 5 Tage dauern. Jedoch schon beim Betreten vom Hotel wurden wir von eisiger Kälte und Unfreundlichkeit begrüßt. Gebucht war ein Doppelzimmer der Luxusvariante im höheren Stockwerk, damit wir dem Straßenlärm etwas entweichen könnten. Als wir das Zimmer im ""zweiten Stock"" betraten, schlug uns wieder die eisige Kälte kombiniert mit dunklen Steinwänden entgegen. Wir hatte das Gefühl einen Sarg zu betreten. Als wir den lautstarken Abgang der Toilette über uns hörten und das schmutzige Sofa, den verstaubten Tisch sind wir aus dem Zimmer geflohen und haben uns ein anderes Hotel gesucht. Das 5Sterne Hotel hat eine Bar auf dem Dach ohne Service-Besetzung, Schlüsselkarten die nicht funktionieren und ein unterkühltes Restaurant in dem auch kein Gast freiwillig sitzen möchte. Ich bin maßlos enttäuscht und kann nur warnen dieses Hotel zu buchen. Ich vereise sehr oft und sehr gerne, aber so etwas habe ich noch nicht erlebt!!",1,2014,10,28
27,Da evitare!!!!,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel in una camera superior. Odore sgradevole appena entri dovuto al profumo spruzzato, le camere sono davvero orrende! Brutto arredamento, tetro e di cattivo gusto. La terrazza è veramente brutta, nulla è come nelle foto. Non vale assolutamente la qualità prezzo anche per via della sua posizione: una zona della ramblas ( ghetto ) dove bisogna stare attenti a non essere stuprati o derubati in pieno giorno, senza parlare della puzza e del rumore che ci hanno accompagnato in questi giorni. Il terrazzo era praticamente inesistente e in generale l'hotel è davvero brutto. Non vale assolutamente il prezzo!! Inoltre, la metro che passa sotto continuamente notte e giorno non lascia chiudere occhio. Bruttissima esperienza!",1,2014,07,20
27,"Moderno, en el centro de Barcelona y...tranquilo!","Está muy bien situado en el centro de Barcelona en Las Ramblas, las habitaciones están magníficamente decorados y limpias.

27,"Gran hotel, nefasto cadena hotelera","El hotel pequeño encajado entre edificios de la rambla de Barcelona, con mucho encanto. Gran diseño del edificio tanto dentro como afuera. Habitación moderna, llena de detalles y con preciosas vistas de las ramblas. Buen servicio de habitaciones con detalle incluido.
Lo peor de la estancia, es que aún no cojiendo la reserva anticipada para poder sorprender a mi pareja y por lo tanto pagando un precio más caro, dos días antes de llegar te hacen un cargo en la cuenta por el precio de la reserva ( en mi caso, una noche )... y no es el típico cargo que te hacen y luego te devuelven al instante sin que te enteres, sino que queda cobrado y reflejado en tu cuenta, hasta que te marchas del hotel y unos días más tardes ( en mi caso, 8 días, culpa de mi banco o del suyo... ). No se, he viajado bastante y jamás me había encontrado una política de reservas de ese tipo, por esa razón, no volveré a hospedarme en la cadena derby. Pero el hotel, es guapo...",3,2014,03,02
27,Tutto perfetto,"Siamo stati 2 notti ai primi di Febbraio,
personale gentilissimo,sempre pronto a dare informazioni o per qualsiasi cosa ci fosse bisogno.
La camera 301 era un po`troppo piccola e il bagno buio,forse qualche faretto in piu`nella zona water non avrebbe disturbato,mi dovevo truccare in una posizione scomoda perché l'unico posto illuminato era lo specchio dietro il lavabo che a sua volta era ingombrante quindi io mi trovavo lontano dallo specchio...in ogni caso camera bella e silenziosa.
Se dobbiamo trovarle un difetto era troppo calda,abbiamo dovuto accendere l'aria condizionata il 3 di Febbaio.
Posizione fantastica a 2 mt dal mercato la boqueria e bastava atraversare la strada per entrare nel barrio gotico.",5,2014,02,06
27,Como en casa!!!!,"Elegimos este hotel por su ubicación y el diseño diferenciado que nos parecio en sus fotos.
Reservamos una habitación Deluxe con desayuno, la habitación es preciosa con grandes toques de calidad al llegar por la noche nos encotramos una botella de vino con chocolates gran detalle que hizo la estancia muy especial.
El desayuno al día siguiente fue fantastico con un buffet pequeño pero muy selecto, los platos calientes te los hacen al gusto y al momento.
Es un hotel 5* parece estes solo como en casa, con un personal muy amable y servicial te ayudan en todo lo que necesites; eso nos encanta no tanto lujo y hoteles grandiosos, preferimos pequeños con un servicio personalizado.
La próxima visita a Barcelona queremos volver alojarnos, lo recomendamos a todo el mundo que busque un servicio personalizado.",5,2013,12,24
27,hola comfort,quando ci sono stato ancora non conoscevo Trip ma mi piace ripercorrere i miei viaggi. questo hotel è sulle Ramblas in ottima posizione per visitare le attrazioni più importanti di Barcellona. Camere pulite e confortevoli. Ottimo il servizio e la cortesia dello staff in generale. Buona la colazione.,4,2013,10,22
27,Ästhetisches Hotel,"Wir waren vom 24.09. bis 28.09.13 im Hotel Bagues in Barcelona/La Rambla. Es liegt sehr zentral und man erreicht viele Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuß. Das Hotel ist sehr ästhetisch eingerichtet. Einzige Ausnahme: ""Fitnessraum"", wenn man ihn so nennen will. Dieser ist nur mit einem (leicht defekten) Laufband und einem Rad ausgestattet, alles sehr lieblos. Wer auf ""große"" Betten steht ist hier, zumindest im Deluxebereich, falsch (Doppelbett ca. 160 cm breit). Barcelona ist eine sehr lebendige Stadt - und gerade im Zentrum dadurch auch nachts laut. Die Fenster sind zwar sehr gut isoliert, für wirklich empfindliche Gäste empfehle ich Ohropax. Wir vermissten eine Kaffeemaschine.
Das Frühstück ist wunderbar. Das Personal sehr, sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend.
Leider ist die Dachterrasse nur untertags (wenn man eh unterwegs ist) geöffnet. Service bekommt man nur über Anruf an der Rezeption.
Wir können das Hotel, trotz der Bemerkungen, sehr empfehlen.",4,2013,10,03
27,Da evitare,"Pessima esperienza per un 4stelle prenotato on line. il primo giorno ci hanno dato una stanza senza finestra (o meglio una finestra alta mezzo metro a partire dal pavimento...) senza bidet.La connessione wifi era pessima, abbiamo chiesto dell'acqua bollente in camera e non è' mai arrivata. Il secondo giorno abbiamo protestato e ci hanno spostato in una camera con balcone decente, peccato che la porta del bagno era trasparente. A voi piacerebbe essere guardato dalla vostra compagna mentre fate i vostri bisogni...? Mi chiedo chi ha progettato questo hotel... Ogni giorno dopo la pulizia della camera abbiamo trovato un pessimo odore (forse esalazioni della fogna). Per completare la recensione dico solo che il pc dell'hotel non dispone di word quindi non ho potuto lavorare su un file che dovevo inviare per lavoro... 
Pessima esperienza per un hotel pagato circa 200 euro a notte...",2,2013,08,03
27,Muy a gusto,"Es un encanto de hotel boutique.  Lo elegimos por su localización y comentarios en Trip Advisor.  Sin duda una excelente decisión.  Reservamos una suite, en el sexto piso, con amplia terraza:   jacuzzi, solarium y hermosas vistas.  La habitación y el cuarto de baño confortables.   El menú de desayuno es variado y sabroso.  El hotel esta lleno de pequeños grandes detalles que hacen la diferencia.  Lo mejor de todo, el personal siempre bien dispuesto.
Muchas gracias, esperamos regresar pronto",5,2013,07,27
27,Superlativo,"Sorto al posto di una importante gioielleria ha trattenuto lo sharm del tempo. Curatissimo nei dettagli e servizio eccellente. Buonissima colazione, e poi direttamente sulla ramblas, a pochi passi dal mercato e da tutte le strade dello shopping. Non si può volere di più.",5,2013,05,16
27,CON CARÁCTER Y ENCANTADOR,"Ya, desde su ubicación sobre ""Las Ramblas"" es una muy buena opción. Y si lo que estás buscando es un lugar romántico y moderno, cuya arquitectura minimalista es ajustada pero muy acogedora no lo dudes, el ""Bagues"" y su hermoso restaurante ""El Corregidor"" es el hotel donde podrás pasar hermosos momentos en BARCELONA. El personal está muy bien capacitado y tienen, todos, muy buena presencia, La respetuosa cordialidad con la que serás tratado puede confundirse con cierta frialdad o distancia, pero no es así, podrás comprobarlo solicitandoles algún servicio. Para mí, tiene carácter y es encantador",4,2012,11,09
27,"Bien, pero...","El hotel en sí está bien, hasta impresiona por su diseño.
Las habitaciones estándar son pequeñas. Las superiores son más grandes, pero se oye cualquier cosa que ocurre en el pasillo.
No nos gustó el aspecto intimidad, pues los baños sólo tienen una puerta de cristal transparente, y dado el tamaño de la habitación es casi imposible no mirar al baño.
La primera noche tuvimos un problema con la cisterna del váter, que goteaba y cogía agua cada tres minutos. Alertamos al personal de la recepción la mañana siguiente, y nos prometieron intentar arreglarlo el mismo día y si no, cambiarnos de habitación. Al volver por la noche, preguntamos en recepción por el estado del asunto, y no: no estaba arreglado. ¡Ni una sola palabra de cambiarnos de habitación! Después de mucho insistir por nuestra parte, al final nos dieron una habitación superior (las estándar estaban completas). Causó más bien mala impresión, pero nos compensaron al menos otorgándonos una hora muy tarde para el ""check-out"".
Casi lo mejor: el desayuno en su ambiente supertranquilo y agradable y el personal muy amable.",4,2012,10,28
27,Super cool mit tollem Personal,"Wir wählten das Bagues für einen Kurztrip nach Bacelona.
Super Empfang, tolles obwohl sehr kleines Zimmer. Tolle Lage und sehr, sehr zuvorkommendes und professionelles Personal! 
Kompliment , wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt !!",5,2012,10,07
27,Oscuro,"No me gusto. El hotel esta en las ramblas. El personal de recepción vestido de forma elegante con chaqueta y polo a rayas, te recibe de una forma fria y distante, no empatiza, eres un mero cliente y eso un simple trabajo sin necesidad de aportar nada más, a mi que me encantan las gominalas, no me atrevi a coger alguna de los tarros que hay a la entrada, no sea que se molestaran y me dijeran algo.
El hotel es puro diseño, oscuro, pero diseño. Los pasillos de accesos a las habitaciones son estrechos asi como los ascensores. Tenganlo claro, si ustedes pertenecen al grupo de personas con serios problemas de sobre peso, no es lugar donde se puedan desenvolver bien. Si te toca una habitación interior, el hotel se vuelve más oscuro aún, remachado por los colores utilizados en su decoración.",2,2012,09,25
27,Personal muy acogedor,"Estuvimos 48 hores en Barcelona, para poder hacer de turistas en la ciudad donde nacimos. Escojimos el hotel Bagues, por su ubicacion en las Ramblas. Tambien por ser pequeño, no me gustan los macrohoteles. 
Tanto mi marido como yo hemos viajado bastante por el mundo, y es la primera vez que viene una recepcionista a explicar la habitacion, ubicacion......
El trato de todo el personal es super acogedor. 
La carta no es demasiado extensa, pero correcta, con platos muy bien elaborados
El maitre, buen conversador, y muy amable. Nos eligio un buen vino y no caro. El chef se presento al terminar la cena para preguntar si todo habia sido de nuestro agrado
En la terraza tanto el camarero de mañana como el de noche OK

Freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal. Der Pool auf dem Dach ist recht klein, auf Grund des kühlen Wetters haben wir ihn sowieso nicht genutzt. Leider war die Bar auf dem Dach auch zu. Insgesamt lässt sich das Hotel wärmstens empfehlen.",5,2012,05,12
27,Hotel Baques,"Das Hotel Baques ist auf Grund seiner ausgezeichneten Lage für einen 2-3 tägigen Kurzurlaub, z.B. für Paare, sehr zu empfehlen. Wer Übernachtungspreise um die € 300 in einer Weltstadt für durchaus akzeptabel hält, ist hier mehr als gut aufgehoben. Vorauszusetzende Aspekte, wie Sauberkeit, Service etc., sind selbstverständlich. Grundsätzlich recherchieren wir vor unseren Reisen sehr umfangreich in den zur Verfügung stehenden Medien.
Wir hatten bei Ankunft lediglich einen Zimmertausch arrangiert, um in den Genuß einer Badewanne zu kommen, da wir diese Entspannung, gerade nach umfangreichen Tagesausflügen, sehr schätzen. Dafür war für uns akzeptabel, daß alle entsprechend ausgestatteten Zimmer zum Innenbereich hin liegen, d.h., nur mit einem spärlichen Tageslichteinfall. Hier mag jedoch jeder selbst entscheiden, aus welchen Gründen er Barcelona besucht.... Wir werden, auf Grund unserer Erfahrungen, in jedem Fall wieder hier buchen.",5,2012,05,01

Un ottimo punto di  partenza per scoprire la città.",4,2011,06,16
27,"Estilo, clase y atenciones","La verdad es que estuve dudando bastante antes de efectuar la reserva por alguna de las
criticas que habia leido, pero he de reconocer que desde el primer momento que ví a 
través de su pagina el Hotel Bagués, fué como ""un flechazo"" y aunque miraba otros hoteles finalmente volvía al Bagués.
No me decepcionó. Mucho estilo, cuidados todos los detalles y personal joven y muy
eficiente, tanto en recepción como en restaurante y bar. Mi felicitación y agradecimiento
para todos ellos.
Incluso antes de llegar ya se habían puesto en contacto a través de mi e-mail para 
cuanto necesitase. Nos invitaron a una copa de bienvenida, nos regalaron entradas
para el museo egipcio (que aunque no es el de El Cairo, ni el de Londres.. vale la
pena visitar), nos reservaron restaurantes en Barcelona, etc.
El desayuno de calidad, variado y correcto, el zumo natural, por decir algo faltaba
un poquito de cava (tampoco lo pedí) para acompañar al salmón. La próxima vez
lo pediré.
Las habitaciones muy modernas y muy bien decoradas aunque, por lo menos
la nuestra, un poco pequeña, supongo que la terraza con el jacuzzi se ""comía""
algún metro cuadrado.
En definitiva un hotel muy recomendable.

27,Buena opción mientras siga barato,"Viajo todas las semanas a Barcelona y suelo quedarme en hoteles de 4 estrellas de reciente creación en el centro. El mayor problema de estos hoteles suelen ser que invierten todo su presupuesto en diseño y olvidan cosas tan importantes como la climatización, la ducha, la cama, las sábanas o las almohadas.
Cuando vi este 5 estrellas a un precio razonable pensé que, dada su categoría, cumpliría con estos mínimos. Y efectivamente, los cumple.
Pero hay otras muchas cosas que lo hacen muy diferente a otros hoteles de igual categoría :
-Servicio: Salvo la recepcionista, el resto del personal deja mucho que desear en cuanto a calidad de servicio.
-No tienen WIFI en las habitaciones. Amablemente te cenden un cable de red para conectarte. Hasta ahí, acpetable. Pero sólo hay  una toma de red en la habitación y tienes que navegar de pie apoyado en una cómoda.
-La ducha, algo básico, no funcionaba. Llamé a recepción y m enviaron a un chicho que, básicamente, lo único que hizo fue cerciorarse de que la ducha no funcionaba. No aportándome ninguna solución. Esperaba, por lo menos, una llamada de disculpa de recepción y que me ofrecieran un cambio de habitación.
-La comida del room service, al menos el Club Sandwich, no es propia de un hotel de 5 estrellas. Además, llegó frío. Eso si, no está mal de precio.
-El bar ser parece más a una cafetería de barrio que aun bar de hotel. Pregunté por otro bar y me dijeron que en breve abrirán el de la terraza de la azotea. Pedí una carta de bebidas para la habitación (ya había visto que no había) y me insistieron de malas formas en que enla habitación tenía una. Cuando llegué a la habitación, comprobé de nuevo que no había... pero ya se me habían quitado las ganas.
-Está en una zona muy ruidosa de la ciudad y las ventanas no aislan lo suficiente el ruido exterior.

En resumen:

-Buena cama
-Buenas sábanas
-Buenas almohadas
-Buena ducha (al menos eso parece si funcionara)
-Buena climatización

Aunque haya muchas cosas que no le hagan merecedor de las 5 estrellas, tiene muchas cosas que, por ese precio, me harán repetir. Si suben el precio, seguramente volveré a otros hoteles cercanos.

PS: Te dejan encuestas por todas partes preguntando tu opinión para mejorar. Rellené la mía, pedí respuesta al incidente de la ducha, pero no he recibido respuesta alguna por su parte.",3,2011,03,01
27,gioiello,"Soggiorno di sette notti,hotel di recentissima apertura,curatissimo l'arredamento con materiali di livello,particolarissimo il gusto degli arredatori e dell'architetto,sicuramente da visitare ed apprezzare.Ottima la cura delle stanze,complimenti a tutto la staff per la gentilezza e l'accuratezza del servizio.Eccezzionale la posizione centrale.",5,2011,02,16
27,"Intimo, precioso hotel","Este establecimiento, de categoría oficial 5 estrellas, decepcionará sin duda alguna a aquellos que esperen un Palace, o un lujoso hotel de cadena internacional. 
El Bagués es un precioso e íntimo boutique-hotel, esto es, un cuidado y extraordinario interiorismo, en un entorno especial (un histórico y elegante edificio neoclásico, en medio de la Rambla) y un servicio personalizado y muy competente.
Sin bien las habitaciones pueden resultar pequeñas, la decoración es tan encantadora y agradable que pareces estar alojado en casa de un amigo rico y de buen gusto. Los materiales (piedra, madera), el lujoso mobiliario, la ropa de cama y toallas son de gran calidad. El baño es cómodo, muy bonito.
Pero fallan un par de cosas importantes, que pueden mejorarse sin grandes problemas: el tamaño de la cama, a la que le faltan unos buenos 10 cm por banda y la deficiente insonorización del edificio.
Por lo demás, aparte de destacar la “location, location, location”, quizás lo que más nos impresionó es la extraordinaria amabilidad, discreción y eficacia del personal del Bagués, sin duda el valor (más) apreciado de cualquier hotel.",5,2011,01,11
27,DE MARAVILLA,"El pasado fin de semana estuvimos celebrando el cumpleaños de mi mujer en Barcelona y decidí por sorpresa que nos alojarnos en este nuevo hotel en pleno centro de las Ramblas.

La atmósfera en el hotel es espectacular, todo da la impresión de haberse cuidado con mimo y consigue que uno experimente una gratísima experiencia al descubrir cada pequeño detalle.

Reservamos una habitación Standard, pero por cortesía del hotel nos ofrecieron una habitación de superior categoría. Teníamos una terraza con vistas a las Ramblas muy amplia, con mesita y sillas, colchón y cojines para tumbarse en la terraza y un jacuzzi en la terraza, y que pese al frío exterior la temperatura del agua era excelente.

La habitación está decorada de manera fantástica, el baño, con paredes de pizarra, a parte de bañera tiene un más que agradable ducha con efecto lluvia!!Las paredes y muebles en un estilo modernista, enorme TV y un sin fin de pequeños gran detalles.

Desde el primer momento nos sentimos en un lugar “especial” con el añadido de que las atenciones del personal (joven y sonriente) en todo momento atento a nuestras necesidades.

El desayuno es otro punto a favor, el buffet es completo, opciones frías y calientes, todo de gran calidad y además a pie de Ramblas. Pudimos probar el famoso pa amb tomaquet (con jamón, espectacular!)

En fin, una experiencia inolvidable, no sé si podré esperar al siguiente aniversario para repetir!!!!!",5,2010,12,23
27,mejor de lo esperado,"acabo de volver de pasar un fin de semana con mi familia de barcelona, alojándome en el hotel bagués de derby, un nuevo hotel de esta cadena que acaba de abrir en las ramblas. 
tengo que decir que después de hacer la reserva vi las críticas de otros viajeros en esta página y estuve a punto de cancelarla, pero decidí seguir adelante porque a mi mujer le encantan las ramblas.
total que llegamos y enseguida nos cambió la idea que teníamos! el personal fue muy atento y se nota que tienen ganas de hacerlo bien, son muy jóvenes y sonrientes y con su amabilidad se nos ganaron enseguida. el hotel está muy bien, no se parece a ninguno de los que he visitado y se ve que quieren cuidar hasta el último detalle, a pesar de que están abiertos desde no hace mucho.
la habitación es muy cómoda y también de diseño, como el resto del hotel, con unos muebles espectaculares: nosotros estuvimos en la 303 y puedo decir que, al contrario de otras cosas que he leído, no me molestó para nada el ruido, nosotros estábamos en la esquina de las ramblas con otra callecita al lado.
nosotros si que volveremos, con ganas.",5,2010,11,23
27,La cueva de Batman,"Quisiera comenzar con una reflexión, últimamente tengo la sensación de que los hoteleros nos toman como un producto al que exprimir, sacar el jugo y tirar después de usado. Me explico, solo les importa el dinero que se paga por ocupar un espacio en su establecimiento, sin devolver contraprestación alguna. Esto me ha ocurrido durante mi reciente estancia en el novísimo Hotel Bagués de Barcelona. Reservo una habitación on-line a mediados de octubre para una estancia del  29 de octubre al 1 de noviembre. Dias mas tarde llamo para interesarme si hay wifi disponible y me comentan que como se acaba de abrir el hotel no disponen de ese servicio, pregunta mi nombre y se lo digo y me dice que tengo asignada la Habitación 405 con vista a Las Ramblas. Dos días antes de llegar al hotel, mi banco me avisa indicando un cargo por el importe total de la reserva. Telefoneo inmediatamente al hotel, pues me parece un proceder extraño y de desconfianza hacia el cliente, toda vez que yo puedo anular sin cargo hasta 24 horas antes la reserva, y en caso de anulación se cargaría el importe de una noche. Me indican que lo que hacen es bloquear ese cantidad de dinero en la tarjeta para asegurarse el cobro. Independientemente de que yo pague con esa tarjeta u otra. Pero su respuesta es política de hotel. Mantengo la impresión del principio, no somos huéspedes, somos meros clientes aportadores de recursos, dándonos un trato de mercancía más que de hospitalidad. Bueno cual será mi sorpresa cuando el día que llego al hotel sobre las 10 de la mañana inmediatamente me proporcionan habitación pero no la 405, sino la 406. Se trata de una habitación interior oscura como la cueva de Batman, que daba claustrofobia estar allí más de 3 minutos. Con el botones aún en la habitación le digo que esta no es la habitación que tenia reservada, sino que era la 405. Bajo a recepción y me comunican que estaba ocupada pero que me pueden dar la 305, que no estará disponible hasta las 14:00 pm. Llego a las 13:45 pm, y me dicen que aun no está lista, cuando vuelvo a las 14:05 me dan la llave y subo por fin a mi habitación. Tamaño, mínimo, apenas se pasa entre la Tv y la cama, baño con bañera( resbaladiza) y mampara, sin cabina de ducha,  tampoco zapatillas de baño,pero al menos tenia ventana a la Rambla. Ventana mal aislada por cierto, que con el bullicio de la Rambla era difícil descansar.  Termino con la sensación de que mis quejas respecto al cargo total de la habitación influyeron en el trato desabrido dispensado por el personal de recepción.
En conclusión, este hotel no merece las 5 estrellas que dicen que tiene ( dudo que las medidas obligatorias mínimas de tamaño de habitación y baño con bañera y ducha que se exige en España a los 5 estrellas, sean las requeridas -al menos en mi habitación-), y no figuran en su entrada, como tampoco figura su nombre, puesto que de su fachada cuelgan cables. La prisa por abrir un hotel sin estar totalmente terminado tiene estos inconvenientes. Un personal joven,  poco preparado y soberbio, y con nula predisposición a agradar culmina esta mala experiencia en Barcelona. Sinceramente no lo recomiendo, salvo por su magnífica situación.",1,2010,11,03
