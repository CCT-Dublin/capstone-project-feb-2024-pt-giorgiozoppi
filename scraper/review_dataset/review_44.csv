44,5 Star Hotel,"“Dear all,

Thank you very much for the great experience and amazing people. The front team, Carla and Pablo, went the extra mile, and we enjoyed a wonderful breakfast served by Didac and a late meal by Emanuel. I will definitely be back.
Thank you

44,Great MO in Heart of Barcelona,"Mandarin Orientale are my favourites hotel chain as service and location are always great

MO Barcelona is right in the middle of Barcelona - so very convenient

The rooftop pool with bar is really nice although always quite busy so not sure it’s just for residents

The main pool is nice as expected

Rooms very modern and good too 

Recommended",5,2024,09,08
44,Lovely hotel in a great neighborhood,"Lovely hotel in a beautiful part of the city, in the center of shopping and activity. Service was excellent from beginning to end. Every need is attended to. Rooms were very nice, all the bells and whistles. Rooftop pool is more of a plunge pool but very nice with a lovely restaurant. I would happily stay here again.",5,2024,08,16
44,Visited Blanco for lunch.....sublime with incredible service from Rui,"We stayed in Barcelona with friends and were looking for somewhere to eat on Passeig De Gracia. I am a long time fan of MO so  we stopped for a lunch at Blanco. 

The restaurant is in the atrium basement and is well lit, bright and Catalonian crip and stylish. Tables are well spaced and as you would expect for a hotel sporting multiple etoiles, service and food quality were exceptional.

But here is the surprise - it is also reasonably priced. We ate in a group of 3 adults and 3 children, the latter all having an well presented, well thought through children' menu. The entire meal with a bottle of wine was less than we paid the prior night at a run of the mill tapas bar. 

Food is cooked to perfection (this is the MO - expect nothing less) and the flavors coupled with the presentation made the entire meal a wonderfully relaxing and enjoyable experience. 

Now to the service. Of course the MO is legendary for its spectacularly attentive and intelligently delivered service. We had the delight of being looked after by Rui. He was a genius, not only automatically providing the kids with everything they needed, before asking and before they knew they wanted or needed it, but he also treated the entire party with a gracious hospitality that I have not seen in many establishments. I could go on, but the point is the MO service in Barcelona is testament to their standards and principles and as a customer this makes for a superb experience. 

Shall return.....soon I hope. Great experience. Thank you",5,2024,08,16
44,Perfect,"Our two day journey in Manderin Oriental Hotel was amazing. The location, the staff and the concierge was excellent. I think that this is the best hotel I’ve been to in Barcelona. I definitely recommend. I wanted to thank Erhan Subasi, the hotel manager and the staff members.",5,2024,08,11
44,Terrific City Hotel,"One of my favorite city hotels - really impressed top to bottom with the property and service. Very expensive but. Felt worth it to me. 

Rooms were small as you would expect but modern and comfortable. We had 2 rooms facing the garden and one had a terrace which was nice. 

Breakfast was a highlight - great buffet and a la carte menu and service was so good and warm. My kids loved it each morning. 

Concierge was excellent and they set up a what's app with me and were so responsive. Really great. 

Rooftop was really lovely with neat pool but this was where they needed more and better service - they struggled up here and acknowledged to me they weren't prepared for the guests that were there. Shouldn't be hard to fix. 

Location is also excellent - exactly where you want to be as tourist, shopper etc.",5,2024,08,10
44,Luxe Comfort,"okay, so i'm not usually one for fancy hotels, but this place? totally won me over! it's got this perfect mix of luxury and homey vibes. the room was super comfy, like sleeping on a cloud, but what really made it special was all the little touches. fresh flowers every day, a personalized welcome note, even remembered how i like my coffee at breakfast. the staff went above and beyond to make me feel like a VIP, but in a totally down-to-earth way. if you want to feel pampered without the stuffy atmosphere, this is your spot. seriously considering making this my new home away from home!",5,2024,08,07
44,Non-hotel guests are not permitted in the hotel bar/restaurant.,"I entered this lovely hotel intending to have a drink at their Banker's Bar. Unfortunately, they informed me about a private event taking place there. No worries, they assured me that I would be welcome at their bar/restaurant called Blanc. However, after waiting at the restaurant check-in desk for five minutes, I was asked if I was staying at the hotel. When I replied no, they suddenly claimed to be overbooked and had no space available, despite many empty tables.

After expressing my concerns to the friendly lady at the hotel entrance, they managed to find me a table—but only after I mentioned that I typically stay in five-star hotels and was considering this one for my next stay. I ultimately refused the offer because the overall vibes at this hotel did not feel welcoming.

I might come back later this week to check if they have improved.",2,2024,06,11
44,LOCATION FOR TOURISTS,"The check-in experience kind of left a bad taste in my mouth and a bad impression from the get-go.

I was asked to return at 2:00 p.m. and the room would be ready. I came back and they told me that it would not be prepared until 3:00.  Two minutes past three I got a call saying that my room was ready. Clearly, they are not willing to grant you any extra time 

Although I perfectly understand that check is at 3:00, allowing guests to check in a bit early will compensate for the lack of services and amenities. eg tiny pool & gym.

There was a gracious supervisor who managed to turn around the sour taste of the check-in experience and wiped out the charge of my breakfast to compensate. 

I could not care less about the charge as that was bizz trip and I am not paying for it. However, that was a genuinely nice gesture that came from the heart. 

Most of the people care in this hotel, the room is neat and well-appointed.  the overall feel of the hotel is a bit dull and soulless in my opinion. 

The room service breakfast was phenomenal.",3,2024,06,11
44,5 star experience!,"The Mandarin in Barcelona is truly an experience.  The location is outstanding, right on Paseo de Gracia in the middle of the best shopping in the city with many restaurants nearby, and only a few minutes walk from Las Ramblas.

Silvia from the Guest Experience Team greeted us upon our arrival and was available to us via text the entire stay. She was fantastic at arranging extra refrigerators, make-up mirrors, and scheduling services for both our room and the Mandarin King for our daughter and friend.  The doormen were always attentive and helpful in obtaining taxis - we appreciated knowing that they took taxi numbers and knew when we were heading out.  Front Desk service was always friendly and efficient. The Concierge staff was very helpful in sending out packages for us.

We stayed in the Barcelona Suite, which was spectacular.  We had a large terrace with a dining table and multiple seating options. The only disappointment was the ""hot tub"" that was really a small bath tub with jets - there was no way to keep the water warm.  The beds are very firm compared to Ritz and Four Seasons beds. And the furniture is under sized.  Also, it was the first 5 star hotel we've been in without a make-up mirror in the bathroom.

We ordered Room Service for Breakfast each morning and it was always delivered in under 30 minutes with friendly waiters.  Excellent bread baskets, cappuccinos, tortilla espanolas, fruit plates, etc. 

Overall a memorable experience for our family! Thank you!",5,2024,05,21
44,my favorite hotel,"this was my second stay at the mandarin in barcelona and it was just as lovely as i remember. we did not eat in the restaurants but the rooms, the smell, the products, the view, everything was superb. this just may be my favorite hotel in the whole world! I love this place.",5,2024,05,06
44,Disappointing stay,"This hotel did not entirely live up to expectations.  Its location was central, but staying in a room at the back of the hotel was a disappointment.  While the room had a view of a large courtyard, it was surrounded by buildings, which were unpleasant (unkempt) to see along with the fact that the courtyard contained a play area regularly filled with screaming children.  Additionally, the restaurant had a sterile feel, although the food was good.  In my opinion, it did not live up to expectations for a five star hotel.  The bed was quite uncomfortable due to its low height.  Overall, it was a disappointment.",4,2024,05,05
44,Great Family Vacation,"Great family vacation. We had two adjoining rooms and there was a small hallways between them to store the luggage. that was really helpful. the rooms were beautiful, very large and we had a very nice courtyard view. Breakfast was very nice though a little sophisticated for our kids. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The spa pool was great and the kids had an amazing time. The location is perfect to see the city.",5,2024,04,23
44,Perfection,"One of the most exquisite experiences I’ve ever had in a hotel, everything was way beyond perfect started from greeting us upon arrival to saying goodbye at checkout, Me and my husband were so lucky to choose MO Barcelona to celebrate our 11th anniversary, the staff were so friendly and paid attention to every single detail which made us feel so special , the service was exceptional and too good to be true that I started wondering there must be something wrong in this hotel but it turns out to be just perfection which I’ve never experienced until I stayed in Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, thank you guys for creating the great memories and if one day I come back to Barcelona for sure you’ll be one of the main reasons.",5,2024,02,07
44,Greatness!,"Excellent from beginning to the end of the stay. Great location, excellent service, everyday a different surprise on turndown service. Concierge guys were awesome! Extremely impressed about the extensive knowledge Pablo has about the city, restaurants and rooftops. Eric worked a magic out to fit the helicopter tour onto our tight schedule. Really great hotel with awesome people! Congrats!",5,2024,02,06
44,Luxury at its best..perfection,"Luxury at its best... The minute you enter the hotel you feel comfortable and welcomed due to the warm greetings of the wonderful staff, our room needed 45 minutes to be ready, they led us to a beautiful lounge to wait there and offered refreshments and pastries, this gesture meant something to us.

The staff and the concierge were very helpful and attentive to our needs, we needed to wrap a breakable item on our check out, the scissors, tape, carton packaging and bubble nylon were sent to our room in few minutes, that was very sweet and fast.
The Blanc restaurant's food was amazing, the staff were welcoming and warm, the place is calm and comfortable, you don't want to leave, we used to go there every night, every item on the menu is made with love even the club sandwich and the burger were gourmet.

The breakfast was perfect and delicious, the variety of juices, cheeses and meats were outstanding. The last day of our stay. the waiter offered us a bottle of local oil which was very touching.

Small gestures that make a big difference, for example, with the coffee pods in the room they offer honey pots along with sugar, that small gesture is very thoughtful, Very clean rooms, well maintained, you are asked everyday if you need someone to come up and clean the room in the afternoon, in addition, they send the housekeeping every day at 5:00 pm to check if you need extra towels, toiletries, water or coffee. I would live there:)

The location of this hotel is just the perfect spot, there are enough staff on the gate of the hotel for 24 hours to make you feel safe and help you with everything you may need without asking.

Thank you for making our stay memorable in all aspects.",5,2024,02,04
44,Not good - Service from Restaurant was shocking to say the least.,"The most awful service from the restaurant - totally ignored, unable to get service, customers walking out all over the place - no one running the floor. The food was buffet style on a Sunday and been sat around for ages.  The hotel is in a great location, rooms very clinical, but the letdown has to be the service, which was dire.  Don't bother.",2,2024,01,02
44,I‘m a FAN of the weekend getaway at MOBCN,"We stayed at MO Barcelona for a nice weekend getaway and as a conclusion I can say, we were both absolutely DELIGHTED.

The lovely room, the outstanding property, a delicious dinner at restaurant Blanc Hand, superb Drinks at the bankers bar, but most important the service quality by the staff!
Absolutely everyone ensured our complete satisfaction and went above and beyond for any requests.

Thanks to everybody for creating lasting memories and we are looking forward to coming back to your beautiful property soon.",5,2023,12,09
44,Hotel is in a great location ,"Beautiful hotel in a great location for shopping, the metro and restaurants. We had a spacious deluxe room with a view of the passeig de gracia - excellent facilities, comfortable bed and shower in the bathroom(no bath). We enjoyed our stay but we didnt think it was worth the price tag - about double what you would pay elsewhere and the breakfast experience was awful - absolutely packed, no space to move around the buffet and the food selection was quite limited. We had booked the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona based on our experience at the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi but you wouldnt have thought it was the same luxury hotel chain. If we were staying in Barcelona again (this time it was a 3 day pre-cruise stay), we would definitely stay in a similar location but try a different hotel. ",4,2023,11,08
44,Worth it!,"Great though short stay with our infant daughter. Staff was accommodating and kind though we were afraid of sticking out a bit in the formal and elegant atmosphere that permeates the hotel we never felt like an inconvenience (apparently nanny services can be arranged through concierge if needed though we didn’t use). Rooftop bar with the best ceviche ever. Lovely location, clean and comfortable room. Concierge set us in the right direction for sightseeing around the city. Highly recommend for a known commodity high class chain hotel where you know you will have an excellent experience wherever you go in the world.",5,2023,09,04
44,Excellent afterwork,The service is on the really high end! The location and views are astonishing! A must to visit and to enjoy a great drink or diner ! The service was perfect and the ambiance cosy reaching a mandarin standards!,5,2023,08,14
44,Perfect,"As usual everything was perfect
The breakfast team was amazing and large choice of products.
Tne only problem  the lift was always busy.

A special thanks to kevin the best concierge in town.
Will come back soon.

44,"Architecturally significant, top notch service - unbeatable location","You know you've arrived at the perfect hotel from the moment of arrival. Located right on the fancy part of Passeig de Gràcia, you're in the heart of the city - next to all the great restaurants, shopping, bars, and coffee shops. This property is walking distance from the Gothic quarter too - so it makes for the perfect place to explore the city but then quickly retreat as Barcelona can be quite chaotic and crowded.

There's a rooftop cocktail pool with panoramic views of the city, which you can enjoy with abundant sunshine. There's also a subterranean pool and spa where you can relax in the dark.

The breakfast buffet was the highlight of our stay.",5,2023,07,20
44,Mandarin Oriental is my new favorite hotel chain ,"This hotel is spectacular. Worth the money. The staff is A+. Shout out to the doorman, Andres for making each of us feel super welcome daily. He took amazing care of my Dad who had to travel in a wheelchair this trip after a bit of a tumble at the Heathrow Airport. Andres ran to help my 84-year-old Dad each day while hailing us a cab and the like. Another mention, Pablo helped welcome us on a catamaran tour and was extra hospitable. Shout out to Fabio in the Bankers Bar for making me feel like a VIP guest every time I came in for a cocktail. The location is in the heart of the city with easy access to shopping and fun people watching. Desserts at the hotel are dreamy. The room was roomy for two with a view of a courtyard. Fantastic nespresso machine in the room which is a win. Thank you to the staff for making this trip remarkable, including Tomas (another doorman), also super friendly in helping us navigate the city with a welcoming smile. ",5,2023,06,25
44,June weekend at MO Barcelona,"Spent a great weekend at MO Barcelona in connection with the F1 race in June, and was thoroughly pleased. Very nicely designed rooms, good food and service. Particularly like the rooftop restaurant with a stunning view of the city. The gym was also spacious and well structured with an indoor pool. Overall, one of the best MO experiences I have had.",5,2023,06,10
44,Less than Anticipated,"We stayed for 4 nights.
Pros: Room was clean, attractive and in great condition. Excellent location for touring and shopping. Upon our arrival a cheese tray and some bonbons were waiting for us. The indoor pool was warm and swimmable. The rooftop restaurant provided great views of the city and the peruvian menu interesting and good. The food on the breakfast buffet was of a high quality- although not extensive.
Cons: Room was very small and located on a low floor facing Passeig de Gracia and street noise lasted well past midnight on the weekend. We were called and told that because we were there over our 36th wedding anniversary we would be getting a special treat to our room. However, we didn't receive anything at turn down on any day after our arrival or a special treat on the actual anniversary. When we called about the anniversary treat, food service said they hadn't known but did send up something. Worse was we asked the concierge to draw out on a map the directions to the 2 star michelin restaurant for the anniversary dinner. They drew the dot for the restaurant 3 blocks in the wrong direction on the street. The dot was accompanied by arrows so we were not mistaken. This snafu made us 20 minutes late until we just googled it to get there. Our last morning we had an early train we asked for a wake up call and breakfast served in the room. Breakfast was wrong but arrived in time which was lucky as we never did receive a wake up call. 
We were disappointed with this stay.",4,2023,06,03
44,Very below average,"Very disappointed in most aspects of the stay…

Service at break fast very poor.. special mention to staff Adriana who had little interest in guest or work

Made bookings with concierge and response was very lacklustre ….. services booked were below par and highly over priced. Better to book on your own than rely on the hotel… 

Even online room booking for packages was poor quality with misleading information… overall I feel this hotel is completely not worth for the price. Avoid",1,2023,05,27

Review of Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona
Reviewed 3 days ago via mobile

Upon arriving we saw that this hotel was in a very good, safe part of the city with great restaurants and sightseeing close by. The inside of the hotel, as were the rooms (our bathroom was partially enclosed in smoked glass walls), was modern and looked like new - very stunning. Our bathroom's amenities were very unique, with the toothbrushes, manual shaver, etc., all having attractive wood handles, or even being made entirely of solid wood such as the comb and the wastebasket. There was a very large shower as well as the commode area, which was able to be closed off from the rest of the bathroom with a sliding glass door. Our spacious room was on the 3rd floor facing the street with a nice view and was very quiet; very well sound-insulated from the noises from the street, even from the adjoining rooms and hallway, with even the HVAC being whisper-quiet. There were two chairs, one for the desk and one upholstered wingback, with a flat screen TV which received a plethora of stations - but the majority weren't English. A nice touch was a small, very heavy high-quality cordless powered Bose Bluetooth stereo speaker to which you can quickly and easily link your phone without any problems. The included breakfast buffet was the most extensive we've ever seen, including a staff member shaving off slivers of top-of-the-line Iberico ham from a large leg, a great selection of cheeses, and cold cuts (but don't fill up on those - you can get them at home in your grocery store). There was a waitress coming to our table with a tray of wonderful, tasty pastries, and at the buffet table there was a simply delicious rustic multigrain bread that was out of this world. They even let us bring some of the food from the buffet to our room. The service and staff, from the front desk, dining room, concierge, and others, was nothing short of impeccable. I have two injured knees and have to wear medical grade supports on both my legs and the hotel supplied me with a wheelchair for my entire stay. One day we wanted to dine at a restaurant, about 1 1/2 blocks from the hotel, and a staff member volunteered to push my wheelchair all the way there, giving my wife a much-needed break. In fact, we asked Kevin, one of the concierge staff, to hire us a van for a 4-hour tour of Barcelona and he gave us a map where he traced our route for the places we were interested in seeing. The hotel staff had our driver take the wheelchair with us on our tour. The spa below the first floor was a bit small, with a small indoor pool but no whirlpool, and they did offer massages, but we didn't use any of their facilities because it was too warm and humid in that area. There is a beautiful outside multi-level garden on one of the lower floors which has plenty of different seats, some in the open sun and others under shady arbors, but what was most notable were the life-size metal animal sculptures dispersed throughout the area. My one disappointment was that I couldn't access the different levels in my wheelchair. One day we went to the small outdoor rooftop garden which had breathtaking views of the city, a shallow, long, negative-edge pool for wading (I don't know whether it was deep enough to be a lap pool), both lounge chairs and cushioned chairs at tables with staff serving drinks and a limited food menu. This was a very pleasant place to relax and enjoy the great food and drinks. I recommend sampling the Iberico ham croquettes - we ordered them at least 4 times during our 3-night stay. On the day before we left, we had gone out for our tour of the city and came back at around 3:30pm - 4:00pm and found that our room hadn't been made up. We had to leave early the next morning for our flight back home, so we had to pack. I called for more ice, and they asked me if there was anything else I wanted so, since they asked, I told them I was disappointed that our room hadn't been made up. They were very concerned and wanted to make up the room, but I told them at that point it would be too much of an inconvenience because we had already began packing up and our belongings were strewn all over the room, so please just give us more ice. A few minutes later there was a knock at our door and a supervisor was there, profusely apologizing for the lapse in housekeeping. Not only did he bring our ice but he had a lot of chocolates for us, even one very large bar of white chocolate with the city's skyline embossed on it (which I would have brought home but it didn't come in a box or wrapper) and a bottle of champagne, which he insisted we take but since we had to pack and get up early we didn't feel like consuming any more alcohol at the time and politely declined. He then asked us what time we were leaving the next morning and told us the hotel would pack a picnic basket for us. The next morning, we went down to the front desk to review and pay our bill and, upon close inspection, saw that we were charged 90 Euros for parking. The thing was is that we didn't have a car and pointed it out to them, and they immediately deleted the charge. We also observed that they didn't charge us for the snacks which were in our room that we consumed. The most probable reason for this is because housekeeping didn't make up our room the day before, so they weren't able to tally the final amount. We told them to charge us, but they insisted it would be on the house. They then gave us the breakfast which they packed for us, and it was in a very large soft-sided insulated cooler with their logo on it which, when empty, was able to be folded flat and taken with us on our plane (it will now be our go-to cooler when we have picnics at home), Stacked inside the cooler were three perfectly-fitting magnetically closed boxes. The first box had a few sandwiches, the next had a good selection of pastries and the last had 2 bowls of fruit salad and a third bowl filled with small deserts. 

All in all, we had an absolutely wonderful stay and wouldn't hesitate to come back to this hotel again.",5,2023,05,12
44,Absolutely amazing and one of the best MO hotels worldwide,"Having stayed in a lot of different MO hotels around the world I would rate MOBCN as one of the best in the group. Location is amazing, rooms are fabulous and staff is absolutely amazing. The moment you walk into the hotel you will be treated like a best friend. Everyone is extremely friendly and attentive. Breakfast and spa are also flawless. Make sure you have dinner at Moments. We can’t wait to return. Thank you very much for the perfect experience. Highly recommend for a special trip to one of the most wonderful citys in the world.",5,2023,05,08
44,Don't go to the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona,The hotel did not honor my American Express quoted rate and argued for three days before settling on a rate below what we had from AMEX IN PRINT.  It cost us $200 (approximately) in the end but the work of going through the dialogue was exhausting -- and ridiculous.  ,2,2023,05,06
44,Wonderful hotel!,"A very pleasant stay. The Junior Suite is absolutely gorgeous, and the service was impeccable. We had a great time enjoying the city from the central location of the hotel, as well as a memorable dinner experience at Moments, which has 2 well deserved Michelin stars. 

Unlike the rooms, it's just a bit of a shame that the common areas of the hotel are so plain and cold-looking. However, the pool and the gym are really wonderful and I highly recommend this hotel not only for its location but also for its outstanding services!",4,2023,04,22
44,Wonderful Hotel with Great Service,"Punch line -- such great service that was genuine and not stuffy, a truly memorable stay. We stayed for eight nights and arranged for transfer from the airport. Our flights got all rearranged due to a cancellation and the hotel was quick to respond and confirm the change for the pick up. After traveling all the way from Honolulu, it was so nice that the driver was there, loaded the car, and took us swiftly to the hotel. As we pulled in, we were greeted by someone to take our luggage and someone to take us directly to our room. On the way she explained the parts of the hotel and got us situated. Such nice service. Our luggage arrived and they are all about the details. The airline routing stickers were all removed (something I hate doing) and everything was fast, efficient, and friendly. The room was wonderful. Trendy while still very functional. We had breakfast each morning and had great service and tasty food. Really nice all the way around.",5,2023,03,19
44,Trendy and luxurious with the added bonus of perfect staff,"I visited Barcelona with my daughter who was turning 22. The hotel staff treated her to a lovely surprise of champagne and birthday desert which was very thoughtful.

The room was spacious, comfortable, nicely designed and the decor in very good taste. I particularly liked the sink. Unfortunately we were very busy running around Barcelona and did not take advantage of the comforts of the room.

The staff were always efficient and polite. On the night before we were due to depart, on our way to dinner, I was hot by a motorbike whilst crossing the Avenida Diagonal and Paseo de Gracia. The streets are wide and I have no recollection of what happened because I woke up in the ambulance. Why I mention my accident, its because the staff at the hotel were absolutely amazing about it. We needed to extend our stay and we needed extra rooms. Everything was taken care of. The concierge arranged for me to visit a private Ophtamological  clinic to get a second opinion, something I had not even thought about as I was shaken by my 24 experience in the emergency room. The head of security advised me regarding the police report. Very helpful. The staff made me feel at home and did not turn their heads when they saw the stitches on my face. I could not have asked for a better place to be after such a horrible experience. 

The hotel manager applied a special rate for the extra nights. A gesture that shows compassion, understanding, humanity as well as professionalism. 

The hotel is very well located. We had a view of Casa Batllo from our window. We walked to all the restaurants and La Rambla. Plenty to see and eat nearby.

The breakfast was very good at the hotel.",5,2023,03,08
44,NEW FAV PLACE EVER!!!!,"Perfect location, fabulous room, most comfortable bed, best bathroom, and the staff - I can say with 100 percent certainty I have never experienced a better staff in a hotel - housekeeping, bell porters, front desk, and the BEST concierge I have EVER EVER had anywhere…genuinely interested, tremendously friendly and SO HELPFUL.  We have never stayed at this hotel chain and it is my new favorite!!!  ",5,2023,02,27
44,MO accelerates my love for Barcelona,"Thank you so much for such an amazing experience at the MO Barcelona.  I truly enjoyed the 4 night stay.  The breakfast in the mornings were superb, and I'd like to especially highlight that Ms JoAn was extremely helpful, attentive, intuitive with her service.  The dining venue is beautiful, and the quality and selection of foods + beverages available are fantastic.  I personally was a fan of the vegetable quiche.  I think one minor suggestion would be for a warm cup of soup (perhaps a cream of vegetable?) which may balance out the cold cuts.

The indoor pool and steam room were also great.  The one thing that was a bit challenging was that the shower in the steam room was hard to figure out (it may have been broken?) and I ended up not using it.  Cans of water and towels available throughout the experience was perfect.

In room dining was also smooth and delivery of the food was quick.  I was continuously impressed with the professional yet friendly mannerisms of the team.

Concierge and team who helped with luggage was also friendly and very helpful.  I was on the way to the Sants-train station, and the taxi there was ready immediately.

Needless to say, the location of the hotel is right in the middle of the city so it's easy to get around on foot.

I was staying during the Lunar New Year so the red lanterns and decor of the hotel also gave me a sense of connection to the Asian heritage of the brand, which I appreciated.  

Overall, an excellent stay and I will definitely be back again in the future.",5,2023,02,04

44,Amazing stay with my little brother,"We had an amazing time. We were both recovering from Covid so it was very important that we are close to the center.  The hotel is located right across from the Gaudi museum so all the shops are at walking distance. There are couple of restaurants, however at the time of our stay only Blanc and Moments(micheline star restaurant) were open. The sirloin steak at the Blanc was to die for, and the courses at Moments were superb. Make sure to book in advance, especially Moments. As for the room, the room was nice. Will definitely go back.",5,2022,12,05
44,Excellent customer service and very central,"My daughter and I recently did a 3 night stay at the MO. Excellent location and central to walk to all key tourist attractions. The staff throughout the hotel were incredibly kind and helpful, this was definitely the bonus of staying here. Twin room - nice and enough and room to move around in. Minor but practical feedback - the bathroom needs more than one peg to hang towels/bathrobes. The one peg meant we had to leave towels/robes on different surfaces to dry. We only had breakfast in the hotel which was very nice and a mix of buffets options and order from the menu, this probably needs some explanation as you walk in as wasn’t clear to us. Food quality was very good. Our only downside was guests coming onto floor very early hours and making alot of noise for a good few hours which led to a very restless night , I do think the hotel need to moniter this with security to inform guests coming in early morning to keep voices and loitering to a minimum. Other than that hotel was great and if were visting we would definitely return. MO is an oustanding chain.",4,2022,10,20
44,Fantastic stay,"The Mandarin Oriental Barcelona can give other five star hotels a master class. This is a first rate hotel perfectly situated in Barcelona where all staff members are extremely friendly and professional. Everyone makes it clear they want you to relax and enjoy and have the best stay in every way possible. 
We loved everything about it. It really couldn’t be any better!",5,2022,10,17
44,First class,"An excellent hotel. Although it is on an extremely busy street, and we were one floor above the street, it was extremely quite. A wonderful bed with first class linens. Service is efficient and very friendly. The rooftop bar is a must do at sunset. Breakfasts were good, but could have been better. Expensive but well worth it.",5,2022,10,11
44,"Pretty amazing, especially Marie at the front desk","We’ve just begun the second of our 4-day stay in Barcelona at the Mandarin Oriental.  Within the first 30 minutes, it was apparent why this hotel rates so highly, after our experience with Marie.  We arrived before the appointed check in time, and our room was not ready, which was expected.  What wasn’t expected was the personal care Marie took to explain the situation, arrange for us to have something to eat in one of the hotel restaurants.  Midway through our meal she appeared to say our room was ready and she’d take us there whenever we were ready, a pledge she honored a half hour later. 
She rode up the elevator with us, showed us the room and how everything worked, then left us with the room keys and a warm wish that we’d have a great stay.  While its ben only two days, everyone we’ve met has been terrific, the bars and restaurants have been superb, and the advice of the people manning the concierge desk has been spot on.  Hard to beat this hotel.  I’m putting it as one of the top 1-2 places I’ve ever stayed.",5,2022,09,23
44,Gets better and better,"This was my fifth visit to the hotel over the last decade, and like a good Spanish wine it gets better with age! The building is as grand and beautifully designed as ever, the address no doubt the most prestigious in the city and the facilities second to none, but what is even better now is the service. Perhaps it is the presence of a charming new GM or the re-awakening after Covid but either way we have never experienced service as professional, efficient and charming as this, in all my travels. A request for ice in the room arrives so quickly we imagined they must have been primed for a sprint, bucket in hand! A call to housekeeping to service our room while we left for lunch was answered before we'd had a chance to grab our sunglasses and leave the room - all so impressive, and all done with genuine enthusiasm and friendliness. Likewise at the chic rooftop dipping pool and bar, complimentary filtered water was offered and replaced often and the smiles of the staff as real as those given to the guests spending hundreds on champagne. The breakfast buffet is back in full force and left us replete for nearly the whole day, so make sure to make time for a long leisurely start to the day. We adored our room with its spacious terrace at the back of the hotel so a splurge to the Mandarin Room category is highly recommended. We can't wait to go back to this  hotel that feels like a resort in the heart of Barcelona.",5,2022,09,23
44,Top notch service,"Fantastic one night stay at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona.  The service was top notch, including holding my dinner reservation at their tasting menu restaurant, MOments, due to a flight delay.  Sleek design in a perfect neighborhood, walkable to many site and terrific shopping.  I will definitely be staying here again next time I am in Barcelona!",5,2022,09,11
44,Best of the Best,"We recently spent 3 nights at this hotel in Barcelona and Im so glad we selected this hotel. The rooms were very spacious, bright, clean and modern. My husband and I commented we could easily spend a couple weeks there given how great the room was. Service was fantastic. We tried both the Bankers Bar, the rooftop restaraunt Terat and my husband visited the spa for services multiple times and said it was one of the nicest spas he has seen. I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again, although it was a bit of a splurge it was WELL worth it. We had considered staying at the W Barcelona but ended up there for Dinner one evening and were immensely relieved we picked the Mandarin. It is night and day more luxurious and classier- which was important for us as we were travelling with our toddler.",5,2022,08,31
44,Amazing Service,"We had the most incredible time during our recent stay at Mandarin Barcelona. Upon arrival we were welcomed with open arms and kindness. The staff checking us in were gracious and kind. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, the attention to detail was perfection. We can’t say enough about the level of service we received during our stay.

This is one of the most beautiful hotels, and the service was impeccable. Every staff member was very hardworking and paid attention to every detail (none too small).

The service was exceptional and created memories that will last a lifetime. The level of commitment, hospitality and concern exhibited by the staff was next level. All of the servers remembered us by name and our preferences. Every member of the staff went above and beyond to ensure perfection. We felt like we got to know the staff on a personal level and hope to see everyone again. We would like to thank the entire staff, everyone’s dedication made an exceptional experience!

tip: become a member of MO to receive exceptional benefits",5,2022,08,30
44,Best in BCN,"While Barcelona may embrace mass tourism and can sometimes be a little crowded and loud, if you have the means and you want the best luxury lodging in town, look no further than Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona. Its pristine address, close to the city centre, has fantastic amenities (amazing spa, top F&B, a mind-blowing terrace with bites by Peruvian super chef Gaston Acurio) , exceptional service, and the guarantee of Legendary Service that comes from its Mandarin Oriental heritage. The breakfast buffet is superb and well garnished, and the door and bell staff is the friendliest in the city. Treat yourself to a room overlooking the city rooftops and you won't regret it. After an expertly made drink in the Banker's Bar (the building is a former bank), float away to dreams in the best beds money can buy. You'll come back again and again.",5,2022,08,23
44,Location & Service,"Getting execellnt service in the U.S. is always nice but when you get perfect service in a foreign country is the best.  It's the little things the Mandarin does that make all the difference.  This hotel is a quiet retreat in the middle of Barcelona.  If you need anything, just ask them!",5,2022,08,15
44,Excellent Hotel in a great location.,"Excellent hotel in a great location. It may not be as opulent as it’s counterparts in Paris or London, but in many ways that adds to the charm. The rooms are well designed and well furnished. They have excellent bathrooms and beds. The location is the best in Barcelona. We decided on the MO over a coulomb of highly regarded hotels in the Gothic Quarter. I’m very happy we did. It is steps away from the Metro station. We dined at Moments, which was an excellent Michelins star experience.",5,2022,08,13
44,Well managed and fresh new hotel,Newly refurbished Mandarin oriental property. One of the nicest mandarins that I have stayed at. Very friendly staff. Very nice and spacious rooms. Excellent bar at the property with good bartenders. You know you are at a well managed hotel when the GM comes to introduce him and give his card to a customer.,5,2022,08,11
44,Excellent stay,"Travelled with the family (wife and our son - 2 years old) and had a fantastic stay with Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona. The hotel is beautiful and has everything you need for a relaxing stay; very comfortable and clean room - well prepared for a family with child, a gym with state of the art equipment, excellent breakfast venue with a wide selection of food and drinks and a rooftop restaurant / bar with a pool overlooking the city (child friendly). The location is the best in town. However, what sets this hotel apart is the genuine service from all the colleagues throughout the hotel. Everyone went out of their way to make sure that we had a memorable and enjoyable experience during our stay. Special thanks to David and Manuela at the Concierge, who made sure to arrange great personal recommendations during our stay. Lastly, Christina at the breakfast venue whom greeted us warmly and made sure that we had everything we needed every morning. Thank you again for an excellent stay!",5,2022,07,25
44,Great service.  Great location.  Great room.  Great hotel.,"There was 5 Star service from the minute we walked in the lobby to check in, until the moment we checked out.  Upon arrival from the airport, they had us sit in the lobby couch, brought us drinks, and sent someone over to us to check us into the hotel.

The hotel is located right in the middle of Barcelona's shopping district, so it is convenient to restaurants and stores.  It is a short walk to La Rambla, and a short cab ride to the beach.  

The rooms are very clean and  nicely appointed and the turndown service often included little gifts and deserts, waiting for us when we got back to the room.

The concierge service was excellent.  They made reservations for us for dinner for ever night, prior to our trip, and every restaurant was excellent.  When our Tapas tour that we set up on our own with another company got cancelled, they quickly set us up with a replacement.  And we mentioned that we would like to take a day trip to a nice beach outside of Barcelona, along the Spanish coast.  The next morning, they had a driver pull up in a Mercedes S Class to drive us up to a really charming beach and village in Costa Brava for the day.

The rooftop pool/bar was very nice, with amazing views of the city.  We would have drinks up there after coming back from dinner.  One morning, I went up there just to sit and get some work done at 9:15 AM and look out at the view of the city.  I knew they did not open until 10:00, and I did not expect any service while I was up there, but the waiter was up there, and when he saw me, he set up a table and asked me if I would like anything, as if they were already open.  So to my surprise, I had coffee and biscotti while I did my work on my laptop.

If we ever return to Barcelona, we will be staying in this hotel again.",5,2022,07,17
44,Concierge Team.. Wow,"This hotel is first off just gorgeous and upholds the Mandarin standard for our clients. I just recently had a client check in and delta lost all their luggage... the concierge team here has been ABOVE and beyond in helping us make sure my client is taken care of. From restaurant recs to last minute changes, I am BLOWN away with the service at this property! Thank you Mandarin!",5,2022,06,21
44,Absolutely fabulous hotel,"We have visited several hotel since March 2020 and all of them have shown a slight decline in service. The exception to this trend is the Manadrin Oriental in Barcelona. We have had the most fabulous experience in the 2 days we have stayed. All of the staff were welcoming, warm and so very helpful. The hotel itself is beautiful and the rooms are fantastically comfortable. Food and drink are divine. But just to reiterate my original the point…,the most outstanding aspect of this hotel is the people who look after you during your stay. I would recommend this hotel over and over again. Well done to the all the staff….you were amazing and we will be back!",5,2022,05,16
44,Starting to show its age,"The Mandarin Oriental is in a great location in Barcelona. But on this trip I found it was experiencing some wear and tear, especially after staying at the swanky new Four Seasons in Madrid. The contrast was just too big. Our room had stains on the wall but not very noticeable, and the bed was not ironed well on two days. I found scuff marks on the desk. It's not cheap either. I hope they renovate this hotel because it still has the best location. You can walk to almost everywhere.",3,2022,04,25
44,Perfect hotel with perfect location and service,Perfectly located hotel in the center of Barcelona! We booked a family stay here (3 rooms) and we are located together on the same floor. Hotel staff was very nice same for restaurants. We will come back! Pure MO Experience ! Kids were more than welcome and everything was perfect from beginning to the end.,5,2022,04,14
44,The best in Barcelona with one tiny improvement needed,"MO Barcelona.  Fantastic and modern property (the suites are incredibly spacious and nice - try to get a room over Passeig de Garcia) and amazing location.  The staff were amazing - what you would expect from a MO - incredibly helpful and polite - always tried their 110% to assist us with any requests for help - last minute or planned.  The Spa was also amazing!  The only constructive criticism that we can give is in room dinning menu which is the same/identical to the menu in the main restaurant and the appetizers the same as the Bank Bar.  It did help that the hotel has a Michelin Star restaurant that is unbelievable.  Going back to in-room dining - cross coverage in all the F&B venues is certainly an issue but not as much of an issue as the selection - the menu should be made more varied (not 5 types of ham for example) one or two main courses, one or two salads, one sandwich and a burger - very limited options.   The menu lacked imagination and was far too limited - my advice would be to get rid off the menu and start from scratch with some basics you see in all hotels globally (at least for the in-room dining) - the menu doesn't need to a huge but MO should compare the Barcelona menu with the MO Dubai, London or any Jumeirah hotels.  Embarrassed to admit that one or two late nights we resorted to Glovo which shouldn't happen at a hotel with caliber of MO.  I have to say though that if the in-room dinning is the only issue I am raising then the remainder of our stay/hotel experience was wonderful especially the staff - at all levels from house keeping to concierge to guest services who did an awesome job of helping me plan my wife's birthday.  Definitely would give it a five star and recommend it as strongly as recommending a change of the menu (in-room dinning, restaurant and bar) NEXT WEEK.  Five star stay!  If in Barcelona....don't go anywhere else!!!!!",5,2022,04,07
44,Birthday lunch at the Blanc,"Thank you for a wonderful birthday celebration lunch at the Blanc for my daughter. We all had a wonderful time. Special thanks to Edouard and his F&B team including Luigi, Federica, Alberto and the chef. The food was delicious particularly the lamb, very tender. The kids love the birthday cake surprise. Many thanks again!",5,2022,04,04
44,Barcelonas finest hotel. Worth traveling to!,"We cannot recommend this place enough. From the moment we got there, the lovely staff had our mandarin-suite ready, which was some of the most luxurious and spacious suites you could imagine, right in the center of Barcelona.

We can write endless pages about this, but we will let our pictures speak!

6 stars!",5,2022,03,25
44,A must stay,"The best customer service/ concierge experience I have ever received. Staff were friendly, courteous, professional and did everything they could to accommodate all of my special requests. Thank you for making my trip to Barcelona so memorable.",5,2022,03,22
44,Very bad customer service,"Had a coffee and cake  . Was not in-house guest and I felt it immediately at the service level .Very distant service , got my coffee and waited more then 15min for carrot cake wat turned out to be a dessert! Didn’t liked the flavour and didn’t eat it ...but nobody couldn’t care about it .",1,2022,02,13
44,Oasis in the City,"This boutique property is an oasis in the middle of the bustling Barcelona city center. 

The moment you step into the hotel you realize it is not like any other. The sleek design is both modern and comforting. The staff is professional and considerate. 

Our rooms were spotless, well-designed, and stocked with the proper amenities. Daily housekeeping was prompt, thorough, and unobtrusive. 

The spa was intimate. The treatments were top notch. The therapists were kind and skilled. There is a small pool and modest workout facility.

The restaurant offerings - even amidst covid restrictions - were great. The service was responsive. The offerings were broad and imaginative. After a busy day of walking, the lounge was the perfect place to relax for a drink with friends or a meal.

The concierge was knowledgeable and helpful. We used the car service to and from the airport - it was worth the money. The concierge was also particularly knowledgeable about art offerings in the area. That was a treat.

This is a top bet for Barcelona.",5,2022,02,02
44,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location, outstanding service","Mandarin Oriental is my favourite hotel brand and MO Barcelona exceeded expectations. 
Firstly apologies for the photos.. the room photos attached I took as screenshots from my videos from Instagram.

The hotel amenities were beyond expectation, the spa which I believe is the largest in Barcelona was impressive, food on the rooftop was delicious and the best pasta I’ve had in Spain! It was also unbelievable value.

I can’t wait to visit again!",5,2022,01,09
44,Happy Sunday After Work  at Blanc,Yes !!!!! I’m back ….. I’m so Happy finally after my 3rd attempts I got in here to my relaxing & very comfortable place to have a drink after a week of working hard at the same industry….Sophie the Host is very accommodating & I feel the passion that she give in to her job …. Love the service…. Now it’s perfect again !!! Love it ! ,5,2022,01,09
44,"We loved staying here, can't wait to come back. ","Situated on one of Barcelona'a very best streets, the location is A+++. The staff is incredibly professional and the rooms are giant by European standards. Everything you'd expect from a Mandarin Oriental plus a funky Barcelona vibe. The hotel features a unique ramp up from the street and several other touches that make the hotel memorable. We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast every morning downstairs. There are lot of excellent hotel options in Barcelona, and this is definitely on the top of that list. ",5,2022,01,04
44,High-end Hard Product. Superior Soft Product.,"To say the service at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is a well-oiled machine firing on all cylinders damns with faint praise this luxe outpost that is more of a forward-looking electric vehicle than what one would find in the waning final days of even the most refined and efficient internal combustion engines.

I last stayed in a Mandarin Oriental hotel in 1995 in San Francisco. Don’t look for it as it closed in 2015 and is now a Four Seasons. But to put how long ago this was in context, gas cost $1 a gallon (equivalent to 0.29€ a liter), people browsed static pages on the World Wide Web with CompuServ (Google would not yet exist for another three years) and Monica Lewinsky arrived at the White House as an unpaid intern. It’s been a long time but a serendipitous shoulder season sale and the readiness to pounce on a reservation created an opportunity to enjoy the brand again.

As with other Mandarin Oriental hotels, the power of the physical property is found in its restraint. Not austere minimalism, but clean design and interior spaces free from excessive adornment, courtesy of designer Patricia Urquiola Although I booked the property through a package eligible for a space-available upgrade, I stayed in the room category I booked, a “Deluxe Boulevard Room.” The lack of an upgrade is no knock on the hotel. A space-available upgrade is just that, and to transform the possibility into an expectation is a mugs game. Travel bloggers have fueled this phenomenon with tales of how with skillful deployment of hotel “points” and top-tier status in hotel rewards programs they transform a free stay booked into the lowest room category room into a sybaritic sojourn in a property’s Presidential Suite complete with a bottle of 2008 Billecart-Salmon “Cuvee Elisabeth Salmon” Brut Rose Millesime complements of the hotel GM. This will not happen to you. You are not a travel blogger or member of their influencer ilk. But that’s no reason not to join the complementary Mandarin Oriental “Fans of M.O.” Loyalty Program launched in 2018 with perks like complementary fast WIFI and a welcome amenity, in my case a tasteful and tasty plate of four chocolates shaped as lips.

The Deluxe Boulevard room was tastefully appointed – it looks almost the same as it appears in online photos although the hotel website shows this room category with two side chairs and my room only had one -- and offers a very comfortable bed with crisp sheets, the aforementioned side chair that would fit right in to Edna Mode’s modernist spread in “The Incredibles,” and triple paned glass that silences the cacophony from the lively streetscape of Passeig de Gràcia, including spirited protestors outside the Cuban Embassy down the block. Despite the location, this is one quiet room. Those looking to mix a bit of business with seeing the sites may wish to book a higher room category – or pop down to the WeWork down the street -- as the Deluxe rooms do not have desks, or bathtubs for that matter. What they do have is fantastic rainfall showers. For those accustomed to drought-mandated low flow showerheads the experience of great gargling gushes of hot water falling from the ceiling offers unbelievable abundance. All of the usual high tech amenities also abound including a gigantic television operated via smartphone and various lighting options that furnish just the right amount of illumination to ensure stubbed toe-free nocturnal room navigation without waking a sleeping companion.

As lovely as the rooms are, however, what really distinguishes this property is the service: preternaturally pleasant, personal and polished. Upon arrival after a long day of travel the front desk was kind enough to offer complimentary refreshments. Although this was most appreciated, it was beyond hospitable as I arrived well in advance of the designated check in time of 15:00. Alberto at the door was always eager to share insider tips from the best bets for tasty tapas to time-proven techniques to avoid Barcelona’s legendary pickpockets. During my stay, the other guests were a veritable United Nations from around the world. Locals enjoying brunch and other Europeans dressed to the nines. Sassy ladies from Toronto. Hedge fund Masters of the Universe from Connecticut. Guests hailing from Asia with entourages replete with a security detail omnipresent in the lobby. Despite the heterogeneity of the guests, the staff didn’t crack a sweat delivering service in what would be a cacophonous Tower of Babel to a lesser organization across Catalan, Spanish, Russian, French, German, Mandarin (natch) Japanese and more, not to mention flawless English.

To earn five stars, hotels in this category must offer 24-hour room service. Too often this comes off as a perfunctory afterthought offering soggy sad sandwiches and lukewarm soup begrudgingly offered by necessity to earn a fifth star. Not here. During my stay I not only enjoyed the best room service supper I’ve ever had, delivered at 1:30 a.m. local time, but it was also my most convivial room service experience ever, guided by the cheerful and caring Marc who was more lively, welcoming and engaging in the wee small hours of the morning than most of us are at high noon on our best days. Eating the meal itself was a bit of a stand up affair given the limited seating options of perching on the bed or an ottoman, but there was not a crumb remaining by 2 AM.

In addition to in-room dining, the hotel’s main restaurant Blanc serves up a variety of local specialties including Iberian ham along with all the regular favorites. Breakfast is a lively and pleasant way to start the day with a bang and discover the variety of nationalities the hotel hosts. The upscale recently re-opened Banker's Bar evokes the building’s previous life as a bank and re-deploys its safety deposit boxes from over the years as a design feature (allegedly ten of them are still operable). Upscale is no exaggeration. Bottles of rare and reserve Cognac worth thousands of Euro sit out on an open trolley at the back of the bar, perhaps protected by the former bank’s silent alarm or simply the honor system. More accessible classic cocktails compete with the bar’s inventive twists on tradition, some quite elaborate involving artisan flavorings and smoke gun infusions. At peak times the bar staff appeared to be a bit overwhelmed rearranging seating for large parties, mixing elaborate concoctions and making sure glasses hadn’t run dry. A piece of unsolicited advice, especially for my fellow American travelers accustomed to bar service characterized by relentless offers of refills to maximize service gratuities: initiate service requests at the Banker's Bar vs. pouting passively in the hope that a server will reappear.

Given its history and appeal as a tourist mecca, Barcelona offers a surfeit of fine hotels from which to choose. Amid this embarrassment of riches, the Mandarin Oriental stands out as a cut above. I hope it’s not another 25+ years before I’m able to enjoy such hospitality and a hotel like this again. It was a singular treat to be back. #ImAFan.",5,2021,11,29
44,My new home in Barcelona,"My last two stays in Barcelona were at Hotel Arts, which I enjoyed because it was by the beach. However, staying at the MO has made me realise how outdated and impersonal the Hotel Arts is… where Arts gives a paper coaster, MO gives a leather coaster. Where Arts gives a plastic water bottle, MO gives a glass bottle and drinking glass. Where Arts says “I’m sorry about your jellyfish sting”, MO goes out to try and find a soothing cream for me. Where Arts turndown service only involves tidying the bed, MO turndown service involves many special treats that are so enjoyable for the guest. I can happily say I have found a new home in Barcelona, and it’s fine I can walk to the beach whenever I want! It is only a lovely 25-minute walk away.

Special thanks to the following lovely team members:

From Bell: Fernando and Alberto. A special thank you to Fernando for the very warm welcome, and to Alberto for remembering/recognizing me by name every time he saw me without me having to tell him my name, whether it was in the hallways, in the lobby, or when I arrive back to the hotel. Alberto always made me feel so at home whenever I returned to the hotel, and even made me miss the hotel as soon as I left whenever he was there to say goodbye to me when I went about my day! The MO is a beautiful hotel on the street and every time I leave or come back, I notice all the people passing by peeking inside as they walked past, pointing and taking photos, and it was such a special feeling walking in and out and being treated so kindly by Alberto.

From Front Office: Elena and Laia. Although I never actually spoke to Laia personally (and I hope I have her name right), she was always very kind and courteous whenever I was in the lobby, smiling kindly and addressing me by name, again without me ever having to tell her my name. Elena is a real star on your team, from the moment I arrived, till the moment I said goodbye to her yesterday. When I checked in, Elena could sense I was a bit stressed and asked if everything was ok, and I mentioned to her that I was swimming in the ocean that morning and had gotten stung by a jellyfish. Instead of just saying sorry, she arranged for someone (many thanks to this someone) to go out to several pharmacies to find a jellyfish sting cream. In the end, I was told that it was an unsuccessful attempt because the pharmacies would not sell the cream without seeing the wound itself, which I of course totally understand. But the effort and gesture spoke volumes… in addition to this, on one of the days of my stay, Elena took time out of her day to help me print out some forms and even sat with me while I filled them out as they were in French and I was in need of a little bit of translation. Elena is so selfless, her hospitality comes from the heart, and I consider her to be a phenomenal asset to this hotel. 

From Spa: Carmen, Patricia, Andrea, and Daniela. Again, while I never spoke to Daniela herself, she was always very kind and warm whenever I was in the spa, addressing me by name without me telling her my name and asking how I am doing. Patricia and Andrea were always extremely helpful when I was there. Last but not least, Carmen gave me one of the best massages I have ever enjoyed in my life! 

From Blanc: Pablo, Luigi, Paula, Jo An. Every morning, Paula addressed me by name without me having to tell her my name and again knew my room number before I even had to tell her. They always allowed me to sit at my favourite table in the corner even though it was a table for 4pax and I was just one. The food was always lovely, and the service quick and efficient. Jo An giving a warm welcome and lovely goodbye from behind the counter every time! 

From Concierge: Mayte. Mayte is another superstar on the MO team, we were in touch from a week before my stay. There was no request too great for her. She got me a reservation at a bar that does not normally take reservations… she recommended me a fantastic Spanish restaurant by the beach and asked that they take care of my things while I swim in the ocean, she booked a haircut appointment at a lovely salon, and my hair looks great now! And whenever I shifted my schedule around and needed the timings changed, she always obliged. Many, many thanks to her.

And lastly, Housekeeping: I wish I had gotten the names of the Housekeeping attendants who took care of my room because they always left lovely treats for me that I will cherish! They left a MO Bookmark on my book (which can now replace the Shangri-La bookmark that was there before), MO microfibre cloths for my sunglasses and spectacles, and more. It was always a special surprise coming back to the room and seeing what new treats have been left there that day!

Looking forward to my next stay already.",5,2021,11,04
44,Superb in every way.,"Faultless from start to finish. The staff were all so friendly and helped us make our honeymoon even more special. The doorman helped us with taxis and tips on restaurants and bars. The room was lovely and the rooftop pool was a lovely place to relax away from the hum drum of the city. 

When we’re back in Barcelona it’s the only place we’ll stay!",5,2021,10,18
44,Condolences,"I am very disappointed with the hotel service.

When we arrived, the taxi was parking 30 meters on left the entrance of hotel. 

There was nobody there, only the single long ramp…

Inside the hotel the “welcome woman”, said and said me to back the taxi and advise de driver to park  the car in front of the hotel, instead to call someone to pick up our luggages.  

Inside the room there was a complimentary Spanish Cava, warm, because the bucket - believe me - was empty. No ice, no even water.

The breakfast was a tragedy!

Personally, I don’t like breakfast “a la carte”. It works only to the enterprise. The guess can not choose very well the options.

Well, every thing comes “at pieces”… fruits and juice only to my husband, while I wait, and wait…

while I wait my fruits, my benedict egg (at singular) - because is only one single egg - comes.

I need canceled my fruits.

I must order some toasts, because the benedict egg is over a very thin blinis.

I received - once more - only one toast again.

I had order some cheeses also (an assortment os cheese, like an emental or guyere cheese). However, I received 3 thin slices of cheddar cheese.

Everything was so horrible that I prefere to stop here.

I will not ever stay at Mandarin - Barcelona again. 

My sincerely condolences.",1,2021,10,04
44,A bit disappointing.,"We expected much more. There are things, which are amazing, but also things, you do not expect. One breakfast was terrible. From waiting time, to quality of the dish. Another was, as we expect in such hotel. Room is very clean, but bed was not very comfortable and what i don’t like at all is, how much you hear from neighbors. Almost everything.",3,2021,10,02
44,Disappointing,"Good looking hotel, well located esp if you want to shop. Good reception staff and concierge.
Staff tried their best in the restaurant and rooftop bar, but there just weren’t enough of them. Saturday night, rooftop bar full, and just 1 waiter on.  He didn’t stand a chance. Bankers bar and the garden inexplicably shut, while guests are unable to get a table on the rooftop bar as it’s full. I’d have been furious if that were me.
Service at breakfast far too slow, on our final day of 3 we had to leave after 35 minutes- had been served eggs benedict with an undercooked egg and were still waiting on toast.
Management just need to put more staff into the bar and restaurant, and open the bankers bar, and it would have the chance to actually be 5*. 
Ps the pool on the rooftop is about 60cm deep, don’t be fooled!! You can’t really swim in it!",3,2021,09,30
44,Great hotel in a good location,This is the first time we stayed in a Mandarin outside of Asia and it didn't disappoint even though you have to pay triple the rates you pay in Mandarins in Asia. Concierge was great as every place they recommended was excellent. The restaurants have very good food but expensive. Housekeeping was also amazing as hotel and room were spotless and I also asked for Aqua di Parma toiletries even though their basic toiletries were also very good and we were fully satisfied with our request. This is a point I always bring up as most 5 star hotels have this policy of having two classes of toiletries depending on the rate/room you get which is quite annoying when you are staying for a week and the basic rate of the hotel you are staying at is like 300 - 400 usd a night. Overall very happy and would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2021,09,18
44,Disappointing Stay,"As the last reviewer said, this is one of the most expensive hotels in Barcelona. I definitely did not find it to be worthy of the cost. 

The hotel is well located and the rooms were a good size for a city centre hotel.

Service was lacking throughout my stay, there was limited space on the rooftop terrace with tables stating ‘reserved’ but unoccupied for 2.5 hours. I also think the photos of the ‘pool’ are misleading, in reality it is very much a dipping pool with the water coming up to your knees so impossible to swim in. On an evening there were inadequate team members on the terrace, it was the only bar of 3 bars in the hotel open on a Saturday night.

Breakfast on the first day was excellent, but declined each morning of our stay with long wait times, frustrated customers and uncooked eggs. Upon check out I was not the only guest complaining about service during my stay.

Would not recommend or revisit.",3,2021,09,17
44,Most luxurious hotel in Barcelona,"From the moment you walk in you can feel that you are entering a luxury property. The entrance on Passeig de Gracia is grand and discreet at the same time.

The rooftop swimming pool, although very small, is beautiful and feels exclusive. The pool is perfect to sit or stand in and enjoy the views. 

The breakfast (both in the restaurant and via In-Room Dining) is amazing. Every dish is beautifully presented and very tasty. 

Although the start of my stay was not as expected, Mayte went above and beyond to ensure that I enjoy my time at the hotel. She completely changed my inital perception of the hotel and I will definitely be back.

After Mandarin Oriental I stayed at Hotel Arts for 3 nights. I wished I had cancelled Hotel Arts and stayed longer at Mandarin Oriental instead. I now understand why Mandarin Oriental is the most expensive hotel in Barcelona but it’s definitely worth it!",5,2021,09,16
44,Fantastic Long Weekend,"We were staying for a special occasion and we had a brilliant time 

The hotel is a fantastic oasis away from it all. We visited the roof terrace, the pool, Blanc restaurant a couple of times each. All fab. 

The blue fin tuna meal on the roof terrace was the best meal I had on my two week holiday

And the burgers in Blanc were yummy too !

Bedrooms are incredibly quiet and the staff  go the extra mile to make your stay wonderful 

The pool was very calming, and if you wish to use make sure you book your slot as they currently only allowing a small number of people at a time 

The only thing i didn't like was that we had to leave",5,2021,09,12
44,Would highly recommend this hotel,"This should be your luxury hotel of choice when in Barcelona. It’s location is just perfect to navigate around town, well positioned in mid town so it is a breeze to go and discover old town, the musea of the Montjuïc area or do some shopping. Where for instance the Arts hotel is further away and comes with some sort of a commute. Here you walk to lunch and dining venues within a reasonable and leisurely stroll. The concierge just had the perfect recommendations in terms of restaurants and felt immediately what kind of vibe we sought after. 

Check-in: a warm welcome, professionalism, kindness + efficiency = Mandarin Oriental. Kudos the the entire front office staff.  Thanks for making our stay so memorable. 

The design of the hotel is interesting, maybe one of the earlier hotel projects of Patricia Urquiola, still standing strong in style, with a redefinition of luxurious elegance. 

Staff, genuinely friendly, helpful and knowledgeable with eye for detail. Of course this is what a Mandarin stands for and makes this hotel stand out. 

Housekeeping: a breeze, little touches, like a wind of love that had passed through the room every time.",5,2021,09,10
44,Perfect location.,"First off, it took me about 2 years to write a review.  We stayed in this hotel back in August 2019.  First impression walking into the hotel was very impressive.  Luxurious with great staffs and amazing concierge staffs.  They helped us with point interests and restaurant recommendations.   The hotel is located around shopping area but also walking distance to the famous market.  We love having our pre drink dinner on the courtyard.  Thank you for a wonderful experience.",5,2021,08,30
44,Impeccable service,"We stayed 3 nights in MO Barcelona to enjoy the last days of summer. It was a good choice. 

The hotel is perfectly located, right on a fancy shopping street and close to all sights. 

The hotel, all the staff, the service, the room, the breakfast, simply everything was impeccable. I would like to praise the concierge team who were extremely helpful and gave us very good recommendations for restaurants, beach spots etc. 

We had a room towards the Passeig de Gracia. The windows were sound proof so we heard no noise which we very much appreciated. 

We were happy with a choice of the hotel and wold recommend it.",5,2021,08,29
44,Gorgeous,"Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is one of my favorite city hotels - impeccable service, comfy rooms, a convenient location and a lovely spa. We had a small misunderstanding after checking in and the staff rectified the issue immediately. They went out of their way to accommodate us and made our stay a memorable one. Absolutely recommend Mandarin Oriental for any trip to Barcelona. I can't wait to return!",5,2021,08,08
44,Top Notch,"The service was too notch! The front desk assisted us with our dinner reservations, transportation and even Covid
Tests needed to fly back to the USA. 

The restaurant staff was attentive and remembered my daughter is gluten intolerant :) Luis was very professional and friendly. 

We hope to return again!",5,2021,08,08
44,Superlative service in an elegant setting,"We spent a week at this excellent hotel and there is little to fault. Despite its city central location the hotel manages to feel like a resort with its beautiful courtyard garden and gorgeous rooftop terrace and pool. Staff are uniformly charming and helpful. The concierge was able to secure difficult reservations easily and happily accommodated our numerous requests and changes. Special mention to Rui who looked after us at the pool and was the epitome of what Mandarin service should be.

Our room was stylish and supremely comfortable, breakfast a delight each day and housekeeping efficient and diligent. 

The only criticism I can make would be that the menus available at the pool terrace are a little limited. Having said that no eyebrows were raised when we ate some sandwiches bought around the corner one day - and surely once business  returns to normal levels they will offer their full menu every day. 

If you’re looking for a truly luxurious hotel with the best address in town, but without the arrogance or pretentiousness you often find with it - this is the place. 

We can’t wait to return!",5,2021,08,06
44,Concierge- all about the money,"Our expectations were far too high.  Hotel is like a 3 star airport hotel.  Smells like wet carpets and very old and run down.  Breakfast was terrible.  Extremely expensive and rooms dingy.  The worst was the pretentious concierge- Maria that couldn’t find simple restaurants… and managed to inform us that “they only know about the restaurants that are higher level”….  She forgot to say it is all about the ones that are the most expensive! Not the ones that are the best.  Hotel also charge 170 for PCR test and same company that you can organize from outside is 130?  MO decided to add 40euros for commission.  Pool is small and there is no way you can use it in the daytime. It is for decoration.  

Do not get fooled by the name!  It is 3 star at most.  Much better places to stay.  Concierge….  Shame on you!",2,2021,06,19
44,Perfect Stay in a wonderful City,"I was in Barcelona with one of my best friends for 4 days at the end of April and really enjoyed our time at the hotel. The service from all the staff was unique, not at all intrusive but at a top level. I like this understatement.",5,2021,05,25
44,Superb hotel and world-class customer service,"I can not praise this hotel and its staff enough. While enjoying Barcelona and this truly great hotel my wallet and iPhone were stolen at a restaurant on Rambla Catalunya. The entire team from MOBCN - from front desk up to GM -  was extremely caring and helpful. The Head of Hotel Security even escorted us to the police after his word duty to help us file the report. We are so grateful for everything they did. THANK YOU!

By the way: also the hardware - public spaces, rooms and suites, housekeeping and food - are impeccable.  Everything you could ask for while staying at a MO hotel.",5,2021,04,11
44,Most Wonderful Staff & Service,"A wonderful 4 night stay during the pandemic.  From the moment we stepped into the reception we felt like VIPs.  Nothing was a problem for the staff at the Mandarin Oriental, every request from booking restaurants, reserving the spa, PCR tests, dining, was delivered with professionalism, friendliness and a desire to delight the customer.  What was really unique was the way the staff tried to connect with you on a personal level.  One of the duty managers, on our last night came over to our table at dinner to say 'I won't be here tomorrow when you leave but I just wanted to say goodbye and have a good trip back.'; always greeting us by our names.  The following day the duty manager in charge walked us to our taxi.  Incredibly grateful to the staff for creating a wonderful stay for me and my family.",5,2021,04,07
44,"Best located, comfortable hotel in Barcelona","Best located, comfortable hotel in Barcelona. 
From the garden to the restaurant to the bar and to the suite. Everything is taken care to the detail. 
Service is excellent and friendly. Food is exquisite. ",5,2020,07,21
44,She’s golden ,"It’s hotel located in The most golden part of the city centre, the entire street is full of international brands, it’s convenient for shopping. Average breakfast! The hotel recognizes membership and upgrades to deluxe rooms, each with a private balcony and private butler, 24 hours a day. Would come back for sure",5,2020,03,20
44,Mandarin Spa,"I visited this Spa as a way to get away and relax from the busy and noisy city. I have never been to a Mandarin Oriental before so I was excited to compare it to Four Seasons, St. Regis, Ritz- Carlton etc. I knew it was a special place from the moment you walk up the long entryway through the pillars and the glass doors slide open. The interior was very luxurious and high end as expected. You can immediately see their restaurant Blanc (which I want to try next) from the lobby. The women at the from desk directed me to the spa right away. When I arrived for check in they sat me down on a comfy leather couch, took my shoes and gave me slippers, gave me a hot towel, and a glass of warm hibiscus juice. These were all really nice touches and something that I have not seen at spa check in before. I then went to the men’s locker room where I changed into a robe and then proceeded to my facial which was fantastic. The quality of products, professionalism, and the atmosphere were all wonderful which are three things I always check for. The spa music was very relaxing and the bed was very comfortable. After my treatment she took me to the relaxation lounge and gave me a blanket. She also brought me the tea of my choice and showed me the snack counter. After I relaxed for a bit, I took advantage of the pool and steam room which were a very relaxing place to be. The steam room has beds in it which I thought was unique. After this I returned to the locker room to the rain head shower and lavish shampoos, body washes, and lotions. Overall I give this experience 5 stars and it certainly earns its stop in the top tier among luxury hotel spas. It is on par with the other luxury hotel brands I mentioned above. I am no longer in Barcelona but when I return I hope to stay here. The experience was flawless. ",5,2020,03,15
44,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona,"Absolutely amazing experience- beautiful hotel and wonderful staff.  I travelled with my 11 year old niece and she was so impressed.  The staff couldn’t do enough for either of us, there was even a panda cookie with her name on it and chocolates!",5,2020,02,21
44,Excellent hotel in Barcelona,Mandarin Oriental is conveniently situated in Barcelona.  Everyone working there was incredibly helpful and professional.  The concierge and butler services made making reservations for everything a breeze. Our suite was well appointed and very comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel in Barcelona. ,5,2020,02,18
44,"Great Location, another great MOH",The hotel is greatly located at the very center of Barcelona. Hotel staffs were very professional and friendly. Rooms are well decorated and new. I really enjoyed this hotel during my stay. I will come back.,5,2020,02,15
44,Amazing Place,"Beautiful hotel with perfect location and very high standard of service. Rooms are very spacious and comfortable - love the decor. Great Spa and wellnes area. Indoor swimming pool has a good size (lenght) for morning/evening swim. Huge variatey for breakfast with traditional food. 
Highlights: 1) hidden garden - very peaceful and green in the heart of the city, 2) wondefull terrace on the top of the hotel with outdoor swimming pool and relaxing area. I highly recommend to stay in Manadrin Orinetal 

Hotel is beautiful, has perfect location, very high service and I really enjoyed wellness area in the morning. 
I was highly suprised with the garden – I completely didn[t expect such a peacefulll and green place in the heart of the city.",5,2020,02,12
44,CEO,This place is amazing... i wish i could stay here all the time.... its very expensive but it's definitely worth trying to stay here.   I was the guest of an organization that brought me in from the USA.... Love it.,5,2020,02,11
44,Charming staff,"Staff was extremely helpful, friendly and welcoming. Doormen in the front were nothing short of exceptional, quick to help and frequently went above and beyond. Rooms were nice, the food was good and the service phenomenal. Overall pleasure. ",5,2020,01,23
44,Best hotel in Barcelona,"Excellent hotel, staff and location .
They are very polite and helpful. The breakfast is so good.
The location is so perfect and hardly you need a taxi.
It’s also perfect location for those interested in shopping.
They also provide VIP free transport to the outlet .",5,2020,01,23
44,Always Great,"I only write reviews when the hotel exceed or underachieved my expectations and once again Mandarin surpassed what I was waiting for . When I arrived my family was  given a double upgrade from a junior suite to a deluxe suíte . Traveling with two young boys it was great . Expecting for us there were cookies, fruits and a bottle of wine. After we arrived from a barcelona match the hotel sent the boys two muffins with the team symbol . Breakfast is good and pattiserie beyond excelllent .Concierge always helpful and location is the best in the city. And to finish a complimentary late checkout . It is not a cheap rate but it is worthy and definetely I recommend this hotel .",5,2020,01,22
44,"Incredible, attentive service. An amazing stay awaits you at Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona.","The staff at Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is incredibly attentive, caring, helpful and service oriented. There are not enough kind words to describe the team. My sincere thanks for everything they do. In addition, the hotel is extremely comfortable and the location is amazing. I've visited other hotels in Barcelona, but thus far nothing compares to Mandarin Oriental.",5,2020,01,21
44,Service Level in Mandarin Oriental,"My family came to Barcelona to watch a match in Barcelona vs Granada. The quality of room numbers in this hotel is perfect it was very comfortable to sleep. The hotel gave us very nice breakfast. Also when we asked the concierge about the match the gave us very brief information about the stadium the tickets and the even showed us the view form our places on the stadium. What I was trying to say is that the service is very good , the all know their city perfectly so be brave to ask them any questions, and even if they don’t know something they will also find the right answers in different ways. If you need a taxi to go to some places you can always ask them for a taxi. Also if you are coming to a football match you can ask them for tickets and they will find the best and not very expensive places on one of two Barcelona stadiums so no worries if you don’t have tickets for a match. The hotel it self is located near to Paseo de Gràcia one of the best shopping areas in Barcelona and you can also find stores inside the hotel. This is all that I can say about this hotel I recommend staying in this hotel to everyone if you are coming to Barcelona.",5,2020,01,20
44,Sheer Perfection in Barcelona!,"We celebrated our 35th anniversary in Barcelona and wanted to stay at the top hotel. It far exceeded our expectations. The hotel excelled in absolutely every way possible. Service was impeccable, rooms were gorgeous. No detail was omitted. Butler and concierge service was superb -- friendly, easy going and professional. They even ANTICIPATED our desires and fulfilled them. Location is absolutely central and accessible to all areas of the city, most are within an easy walking distance. I would rate it a 10 star experience!",5,2020,01,16
44,First Barcelona visit,"Stayed at Mandarin Oriental Barcelona and it made our vacation a memorable one. Brilliant guest service. The room (deluxe boulevard double room) was really good, size, amenities, bed etc. very happy to have the holy Quran and prayer mat available in the room too. Bathroom is excellent with WC douche! Simply loved it. And most importantly was guest relations they were understanding of our flight delayed and provided complimentary late checkout time, this was really nice and considerate from them. Thank you Mandarin Oriental Barcelona",5,2020,01,13
44,Best hotel in Barcelona ,"My wife and I stayed in this beautiful hotel when we visited Barcelona. The location is in the center of of the Passeig de Gracia, we walked to all main attractions like La Rambla, Mercat de La Boqueria and La Sagrada Familia. It's so convenient and we didnot take the train or taxi for once while we there. There are so many shops, restaurants, bars just nearby. You can simply sent it back to the hotel for whatever you brought and then go again! From the moment you arrived the hotel drive way, you know you are in the best hotel, the tastful design of the entrance and restaurants, the friendliness of the staff as well as the beautiful room. I was most impressed by the details of the service and you can really feel that the staff here are really care about how the guest feel and they are going to do whatever it takes to make the stay beyond expectations. Thank you Mandarin Oriental Barcelona!",5,2020,01,11
44,Amazing experience,"We travel a lot. We stay at the four seasons ritz and mandarin.  This was the most amazing experience due to the staff courtesy and professionalism. We got to our room early which they accommodated. But until they were able to get us the room they offered us cappuccinos at no cost brought out to us by the garden. Concierge helped us get tickets to everything we were planning the next day. Anything we needed they were all there for us. May I add the friendliness was extraordinary. The breakfast was great the bankers bar had amazing food and drinks. The server even remembered how we liked our drinks and temp of food. We had literally the best vacation they scheduled our cab they were accommodating and so sincerely nice. Also the spa was fantastic my facial was amazing and the couples massage was phenomenal the spa staff were extremely knowledgeable and it was a great experience. We’ve had spa experiences at other mandarins this one was the best! Anyway, will always just go to mandarin when in Barcelona or anywhere else. They add small amazing touches that really I wish the other hotels would but it’s fine since we know our go to is the mandarin esp in Barcelona.",5,2020,01,07
44,Best Hotel of Barcelona,"One of the best hotels in Barcelona, of course
温馨的Hotel，这里的服务无可挑剔。办理入住的时候能充分考虑到客人的状况，即使还没到入住时间也能让客人在餐厅得到很好的休息。客房服务的品质也是在巴塞罗那住过酒店中最好的。
虽然健身房位于地下一层，但设施依然十分全面。要是能有健身后淋浴的地方，和更多康乐设施比如桑拿就更好了。
每次入住Mandarin Oriental，都让人感到安心。",5,2020,01,06
44,the best hotel,The Mandarin Barcelona has the best butler service.  They go the extra mile to deliver the most personal and most genuine care.  The suites are impeccably designed aesthetically and highly functional.  Truly home away from home feel.,5,2020,01,02
44,"Nice hotel, but doesn't work for me","I travel to Barcelona on regular basis (6-7 times a year) and during my last travel in December, stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for four nights. During this stay, it was a combination of business and pleasure. The property is at prime location, very nice rooms (although it can be a bit loud in rooms facing street side), great breakfast, enjoyed the bar (house cava is excellent), but the gym facilities are not even close what I was expecting. The gym is small, dark, with not much equipment, basement pool is not a lap pool and the spa facilities are not open before 8am. The hotel offered to find gym facilities that work for me and my schedule, but other hotels offered that too. It requires me to take a taxi and I have to account extra 30-45 min for my morning exercise.
Saying that, I don't get value for the money paid. There are similar hotels in BCN that provide very similar experience and quality in the same vicinity, but at a lower price.
If I would not have the gym requirement, would definitely recommend the hotel, but in this case have to lower my rating and provide this caveat.

To be fair, none of the Barcelona hotels offer good gym facilities.",4,2020,01,01
44,Couldn't have been better,"We spent four nights here, at the end of our Spain trip. Wow. Incredible service from the nicest, most responsive staff imaginable. The hotel is incredibly well situated in Gracia, down the block from Gaudi, close to so many things. Our room was lovely, and everything was thoughtful and well-designed. Fantastic breakfast buffet, one of the best we've had. Very nice bar with interesting cocktails (though pricey.) Highly recommend the spa - we did couple massages and they were excellent. Tip to toe a great hotel and a fantastic experience.",5,2019,12,26
44,An incredible hotel in an increddible city,"I booked the MO Barcelona as a treat for my wife's birthday. I have never stayed anywhere quite so expensive before so I was slightly worried but, as soon as we got to the entrance, we were whisked away from the busy (brilliantly central location) into a quiet oasis of calm. The check in staff were fantastic and took us on a tour of the hotel before we went up to our room. The room was big, incredibly modern and very stylish. GREAT bed and very good bathroom (but no bath). Loads of hanging space etc lovely robes and slippers to wear. Breakfast was as good as I'd hoped. A fantastic selection of food buffet style plus a number of items to order (I had eggs Royale). Coffee was lovely and strong, my only complaint was that the fruit juices weren't cold). We had cocktails in the bar and I had a Cointreau which I swear was a quadruple for 8 Euros! The spa is frighteningly expensive but the pool is free and lovely for a quick swim. 

But it's the staff that really make this place. Their English is impeccable (my Spanish is non-existent) and they bend over backwards to make things happen. It really is worth it if you want a magical weekend.

I would definitely stay again.  ",5,2019,12,17
44,Very good stay,"We spent a night here and thoroughly enjoyed our stay

The hotel went out of their way to accommodate us during our short stay

44,A perfect hotel for BCN,What a beautiful property in the heart of Barcelona. Amazing location where you can walk to almost anywhere. Super friendly staff and great sized rooms. The indoor pool/steam room is a hidden gem. Great restaurants and Bar. Highly recommended hotel,5,2019,12,09
44,Great property but lacking 5 star infrastructure ,"The Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is a great property that’s walking distance from a lot of action. The hotel itself looks great but since it’s a 5 star property that costed us $500+ per night, I’ll try to nitpick a bit. The window should have more than 2 tiny little shades. It seems to me like the black out shade was broken as it was completed removed from its hinges and just left up there. 
We paid 16 euros for pancakes at the breakfast lounge. After about 45mins, we ended up realizing that the someone (won’t give no names) who we thought took our order never actually placed it. We had to ask someone else for our pancakes. Upon receiving the order, we realized that we’ve just paid 16 euros each for 3 tiny pancakes.
Other than that, the property is in a great location and definitely somewhere I’d like to visit again.",5,2019,12,01
44,Modern Leisurely Luxury at the Heart of Barcelona,"We felt welcome from the first minutes upon arriving to the hotel - staff is extremely friendly and helpful, efficient and professional at the same time. Location is amazing - the hotel is situated right in the heart of the most beautiful area with most of the historical landmarks, boutiques and restaurants. We loved the bar! Great place to relax in the end of the day - cocktails and late night snacks are really great, atmosphere is cozy and comfortable. We’ll certainly stay at the Mandarin Oriental once in Barcelona!",5,2019,11,24
44,Loved it!,"As soon as we arrived at The Mandarin we loved it.  In fact, we extended our stay because we were so happy there.  The property was beautiful and the location was perfect.

Even the doorman, Daniel always had our taxi waiting with a smile on his face.  Can't wait for our return. ",5,2019,11,14
44,Best of Barcelona,"We recently had an amazing stay at The Mandarin in Barcelona.  The location was perfect, easily accessible to everything by foot or a quick taxi ride.  The property was super with very large, luxurious rooms but what really stood out was the service of the staff.  I cannot say enough about the concierges (David and Ferran) and just about everyone we encountered.  The breakfast was incredible and we dined one evening at Moments which was also a highlight of our trip.",5,2019,11,09

44,Excellent Luxury Hotel with a Caring Staff,"We are really grateful for having stayed at the Mandarin Oriental as the property is amazing, but the service from their staff really made are stay. We started our trip realizing that we had misplaced a backpack on our trip from the airport to their property and they immediately went to work to try to locate the bag. Aside from this attentiveness, everyone that we encountered was very welcoming and going out of their way to make us feel at home during our stay. The property itself is beautiful and the rooftop pool/bar has some incredible views of all of Barcelona.  We definitely will stay here again.",5,2019,11,05
44,Best hotel in Barcelona,Wow!  Our stay at The Mandarin Oriental Barcelona has been amazing.  From the moment we arrived we were greeted with wonderful service (Alejandra) which equals the incredible property.  Rooms are super spacious and decorated with beautiful decor along with functionality (lots of closet space). One thing important to me is having a pool which the Mandarin has 2 of.  I did not realize that until I arrived but in addition to the roof top pool they have a fantastic indoor lap pool by the spa.  We have enjoyed just about every aspect of the hotel including the prime location.  The breakfast buffet is delicious and even Natalia remembered my coffee order each day.  David and Ferran were indispensable at the concierge desk organizing everything for us.  Can’t wait to return.,5,2019,11,03
44,Best in Barcelona,"As it was our first time to the city and not really sure which hotel to choose, we thought that it would be safe to go with a brand that has an established reputation. Well, safe to say, we were very impressed with what we discovered! The hotel is well situated, rooms are well appointed (although a bit funky by MO standards), and the staff are well-trained. Barcelona delivers for what you pay for! Highly recommended.",5,2019,10,27
44,Spectacular Hotel,"I stayed at the Mandarin-BCN for 4 days in October 2019.  The hotel is in a great location with easy access to all the places you may wish to go.  The service was, as you would expect, immecable in every department.  The hotel smells great and you notice it as soon as you walk in but it does not overwhelm you; in fact, it welcomes you.  I stayed in a Deluxe Suite facing the Passeig de Gràcia.  The room as huge, well decorated and comfortable.  The Butler service was helpful and attentive at every turn.  During my stay, the protests were happening right outside the hotel nearly every day. The hotel kept me informed each day with written updates and in person Bulter visits with safety updates and suggestions.  You could tell they truly cared about my safety.  While not inexpensive, it is a truly luxury, 5-star hotel and treats its guests accordingly.",5,2019,10,23
44,Wonderful,"Beautiful hotel, charming and helpful staff especially helpful as we had to get to the airport on the Monday evening with the Catalan protests in full swing ! One of the staff actually escorted us to the metro and told us what to do. Lovely room with one of the best bathroom set ups I have seen in a top hotel. Great location , easy walking distance to all the main attractions. Will definitely return.",5,2019,10,17
44,"Great location, great hotel","We had a really comfortable and enjoyable stay at the MO in BCN recently. The room is big by European standards. The bed is very comfortable. We were traveling with our toddler and the hotel had arranged some Panda cookies and chocolates for us in our room on arrival. The baby got his own Panda linen set and toiletries. A nice personal touch. The staff is very friendly and polite and the concierge desk had some great restaurant recommendations, which we thoroughly enjoyed. We had a few drinks at the terrace bar during our stay. The view of the sunset from the terrace is gorgeous. We didnt dine at the hotel otherwise. The hotel is very conveniently located on the main shopping street in Barcelona. The Gothic Quarter is just 15 minutes away and there are loads of bars and restaurants close by. Plus points for location.",5,2019,10,13
44,Thank you MO,"The reception upgrade our room to a great suite only because of a little misunderstanding while doing check-in, which enhance our stay in Barcelona a lot. And the breakfast in Blanc offer a wide range of selections even the Chinese Dim Sum, the staff always know where we sat yesterday.",5,2019,10,11
44,Excellent Stay,"I had an excellent time at Mandarin Oriental Barcelona. I arrived very early in the morning and I was offered a breakfast at the beautiful lounge while waiting for the rooms. The staff are all pleasant, professional and attentive. A female staff at concierge proactively provided me with lots of suggestions at Porto when she realized my next stop for the trip is going to Portugal for where she is from. Excellent service and I can’t wait to go back. ",5,2019,10,10
44,Great stay and convenient location ,"Great hotel and so convenient. It is located right in the busy Main Street. The front office service is excellent. They are friendly and made us feel like true home away from home. It is the first hotel of our trip in Spain. I guess MO set the bar too high that the other hotels we will be staying later on , cannot exceed. We will see... 

Thank you MO Barcelona for arranging the surprise wedding anniversary gift for us. Thank you ",5,2019,10,10
44,Beyond fantastic. A true gem ,"I had the pleasure of spending my anniversary there recently. It truly was special. Upon arrival I was met by Raul the manager and Ann one of the butlers assigned to our suite. They quickly arranged for our luggage to be dealt with and asked if we would like a quick property tour, which we accepted. The property while compact is beautifully designed and furnished. Very hip comfortable boutique feel.  Anna then showed us to our room which they had upgraded. It was great, it was very modern with fabulous bathroom and balcony.  It was decorated quite romantically for our anniversary. Effort far beyond my expectations. 
View from the room was over the courtyard, which we loved. 

Anna quickly checked us in, from the room. She got us a great dinner reservation for dinner  and while we left for dinner had us all unpacked. I might even say to my surprise when we returned we had candles and a great bubble bath waiting. Truly an incredible effort and touch.  

The following morning  we met Pablo who was our butler for the morning to mid afternoon and he to was fantastic. Efficient friendly and extremely helpful. We had both room service and ate in the breakfast restaurant daily. Service and food were excellent. I wish I could remember the wait staff names but each were efficient and delightful.  In addition Raul the manager came over to us while we were having breakfast on a daily basis to see how our stay was going. 

The concierges gave great advice and even helped secure us excellent seats for the Barcelona football game. 
The bed was so comfortable, the ac worked beautifully. Loved our room. 

I loved the rooftop bar, the manager there was fabulous and we were lucky enough to be there when they had a DJ. She was a great personality and played awesome music. 

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels. This is one worth noting. Besides great everything and (by the way a comfortable gym to workout) it is in a great location. My choice for Barcelona. Other five stars are good there, but this one is exceptional..",5,2019,10,07
44,Marvellous stay,"Beautiful hotel in the best part of Barcelona.  Modern and stylish.  
Impeccable service.  The staff is friendly and courteous. 
Concierge arranged a city tour for us and did a restaurant booking as well.
Everything was perfect from the moment we arrived until we left.   
Special thanks to Mireia Franquet who was so helpful and kind to us.",5,2019,10,05
44,Best hotel ,"The hotel amazing location 
Best food 
Amazing spa 
The pool very nice and good view 
The room very style 
The service amazing also the concierge very good service the suite very nice and big little bit over priced ",5,2019,10,01
44,What dreams are made of...,"Wow, Wow, Wow!!!!!!

This is now my FAVOURITE hotel in the entire city of Barcelona. If you love luxury, amazing, yet personalised service and pure relaxation - this is where you need to be. 

I came for my birthday as a solo traveller as I wanted to switch off from the world and embrace my new age. From the moment I stepped out of the taxi, Concierge escorted me and my luggage all the way to reception, even radioing through to them on the walk up that I was arriving. 
I received a personalised welcome, all paperwork that I needed to sign ready for me and asked if there was anything they could do or help me with during my stay in Barcelona. I had visited the city before so I had an idea of where to head, but this was mainly for chilling so I didn't have much intention of stepping outside the hotel. 

I had a feeling my room wouldn't be ready as I arrived on an early flight from London - just to add to this, a day before I had received a call from the hotel to check my flight times and approximate arrival. They mentioned they would do their best to accommodate me, but this wasn't a problem. Due to me being a little too early, I was taken downstairs to have a complimentary breakfast which I have to say, MO covered every potential appetite need. From juices to cold meats etc, fantastic options on the buffet but also on the menu. 
Was very nice to a selections of Tiptree Jam and Honey in the hotel as I live just around the corner from the factory in Essex. A little touch from home, but also, I think it is the BEST!!

The rooftop is where I spent most of my days and that was heaven. The team up there were extremely attentive, topping up my water and adding ice to make sure I was hydrated in the heat. The pool itself is more of a dipping pool, but exactly what's needed. Lovely and cooling with great views of the city. 
My room looked over the bustling Passeig De Gracia, but you wouldn't have known this unless you opened the window. Room was beautiful and amazingly so peaceful. Everything I was expecting and more from this trip I planned in my head. 
The shower alone - best I've ever used and could have taken a million showers a day ha ha! 

Every member of the MO team I met or spoke to were so polite and helpful. I was apprehensive travelling as a solo as you can feel intimated in some 5* hotels as a female. 
I have to say a very special thank you to Gemma Grau at the hotel especially, you made this birthday trip for me amazing and the team there are very lucky to have you on board. You will DEFINITELY see me again - thank you for the most FANtastic stay!!!!",5,2019,10,01
44,First class accommodation Barcelona,"Mandarin Oriental is first rate hotel in Barcelona with all required by the discerning traveller. Rooms excellent, Staff efficient and pleasant. Spa services a standout with excellent hairdresser. Quality restaurants from great tapas at Terra. rooftop to Michelin star Midori. Good breakfast.",5,2019,09,29
44,Lovely Boutique Hotel in a Perfect Location,"We splurged for our 25th anniversary and stayed at the Mandarin for four nights. It was quiet and comfortable and we were treated very well. Decor was tasteful, and we had a Japanese tub in our room, which we loved. We made full use of the amenities -- from the bar on the roof (with the dipping pool) and the spa in the basement. We chose the daily breakfast option, which was ideal for us, and we loved the Lebanese options (any reason to eat more hummus) especially. The reason we gave four out of five stars: they made a point of asking us *twice* if we had dietary restrictions. Since they asked (because we would not have volunteered this), we told them that we're both vegan. Even with otherwise astounding service, almost everything they brought wasn't vegan (chocolates, cookies, cake, etc). So why ask us at all? And the signature Mandarin Oriental scent was quite overpowering. Every time our door opened, the smell hit us and we commented on it. We started to hold our noses from the room to the elevator. The good news: there is none of the intense perfume in the restaurants, and the food was delicious -- particularly the vegan pancakes that the chef made especially for us.",4,2019,09,26
44,Way Below A Five-Star Experience,"I stayed here for seven nights and had many opportunities to observe and experience the workings of this hotel, some of which need improving. I will outline these below. The room charge for my stay was he conference rate and it's only because of this heavily discounted rate that my review is not more scathing.

In my experience, a five-star hotel is all about good facilities and thoughtful, intelligent, seamless service. These traits were not evident at the Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona. In fact, in no way should this be classed as a five-star hotel.

On the upside the hotel location is great; the laundry service while expensive was efficient, and some staff are well trained and polite, but not all.

DELUXE GARDEN ROOM
Small; poorly laid out, cluttered. Loose wiring in the bedside lamp. View from the balcony is, putting it politely, rustic - interesting outlook if you like seeing the backside of residential buildings - more reminiscent of an inner Asian apartment block than a European five-star hotel. The balcony was variously overwhelmed by the smell of tobacco and marijuana and one of the floorboards had rotted through and had dangerously dropped.

BATHROOM
If you're a man who has a wet-shave every day, forget it. The basin plug can't be recessed or removed - just leave the tap running and waste the water.

HOUSEKEEPING
Their intentions are good but for a top-level hotel, the in-room housekeeping staff often missed the mark. e.g.
. One morning I went to breakfast and deliberately didn't push the button to have the room made up and came back to find the cleaning, inconveniently, in progress. Why have an electronic notification system in place if it is not respected?
. Used towels were removed but not always replace and I had to request fresh items
. Another morning the newspaper was removed from the inside door handle and I never saw it again. Why have the paper delivered to the room if it is removed without permission?
. A personal item (a bag) that I brought from home was disposed of, again, without permission.

THE BILL
. Wrongly charged for a breakfast item; lucky I checked the bill but still, not a good look for a five-star hotel.

BREAKFAST
. The Eggs Benedict tasted OK but looked unappetising
. I specifically ordered hot food each morning but it was often cold by the time it reached the table
. The staff did not replenish the buffet consistently and I and other guests had to ask for spoons, plates and food to be brought out
. One morning I was shown to my table, coffee order taken.... and immediately forgotten. Ten minutes later I re-ordered. How hard is it to show a person to a table, take a drink order, deliver the order to the barista and get it to the table?

ROOFTOP BAR
. Only had a drink there once and...the wrong bill was presented for signing; unprofessional.

None of these things taken separately is an issue, especially if I was critiquing a three-star hotel, but I'm not.

I am going back to the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona for a final night's stay, later this week. Stay tuned; I may have an update to this review.",3,2019,09,23
44,MO Barcelona amazing!,"This hotel was perfect location for us.  Shopping at their doorstep!  All best shops!

David, the concierge, was delightful and helpful!   He made my bday extra special in so many ways...will never forget what you did for me David!

Breakfast buffet was plentiful and wonderful selection of fresh fruits!

Cannot wait to return in 10 days for another fabulous stay!",5,2019,09,22
44,Suites are beautiful,"We stayed 3 nights this past Spring and very much enjoyed our first stay at MO Barcelona.  If you reserve a suite, they are very expensive but  spacious and well designed. We had a terrace room facing the gardens with a large patio - it lacked the views but was very beautiful and quiet.  One big negative - we did not find the bed comfortable at all, supposedly it was a new mattress but it was like a rock.  Did not sleep well. The 2 other couples we traveled with did not have a problem with their suites so it must vary from room to room.  Ask for a renovated room or suite as they do seem to differ greatly- one side of the hotel is newer than the other.  We did not know about the rooftop restaurant right away, and wish the staff had done a better job showing us around when we checked in.  The location of hotel was excellent and we would return.",4,2019,09,21
44,"Five star staff, five star location, the Best of the Best","Hard to believe this hotel is SO quiet, given its five star location. We had a view of the street but never heard a peep. The windows must be crazy insulated! Never heard even a tiny sound from other guests or plumbing or traffic while in our room, and yet, the hotel sits on the perfect bustling street in the perfect area of town, and is close to all the action. We had many special requests of various staff over our week-long stay and each and every staff member was incredibly gracious and lovely, helpful and always fast and eager to solve any problem or question. We kept calling the staff with one request after the other, and often they would quickly arrive to our room to solve either technology issues or to bring us extra bed sheets, help us change our tv to our language, or whatever. We're not exactly tech savvy so this was a real plus. Truly one of the most memorable hotels we've ever stayed at, and we do one big international trip at least yearly, with other trips in addition, so we're experienced travelers. Did I mention the location? Really made a difference to us because we like to walk out the front door and GO. Also, the breakfast buffet is extraordinary! Each and every staff member, concierge, reception, and restaurant staff, was gracious beyond belief. The indoor pool was perfect size and temp for lap swimming, and the nearby hot sauna was ideal. ",5,2019,09,21
44,Heaven in Barcelona,"From start to finish, our 3 days at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona were out of this world!  I didn’t want to leave.  We were made to feel like family, everyone was so kind, courteous, helpful and just fabulous.  I slept like an absolute Queen and was treated like a VIP. I’m already looking forward to my next trip.",5,2019,09,12
44,Holiday vibes,"Stay here for a week with friend,room was cleaned and lovely designed,balcony was great to sit on and chill at night. Staff were very friendly, all day and night, especially when we arrived super late night after our flight was delayed, staff were more than happy to help. Hotel is right in the center and close to everything and some lovely restaurant around. Would definitely recommend.",5,2019,09,02
44,One of the best hotels in Barcelona ,"Service was impeccable. Attention to details was very good. They even remember what type of coffee you ordered the previous day :) loved the breakfast buffet spread too! Quality over quantity. Location was also perfect and no hassle of getting transportation going in and out of the hotel. The staff is always keen to offer help and assistance.

44,Expensive and luxurious,"I had a wonderful time spending two nights at this 
Magnificent property. We were upgraded to a nice junior suite fronting Passeig de Gracia. 
the service was personal and very professional, the bar Was nice and had a good bar man but no live music was
On. 
 food at the restaurant in the rooftop pool was tasty, the branch was disappointing. 
They probably need to be more organized focused on service and serving food continually. 
On a branch food must be on the buffet al time long. 
Italian Spanish and international cuisine is not 
What you are looking for, you are here for Spanish food.",4,2019,08,25
44,Great location and exceptional service ,"The service is fantastic throughout the hotel. We originally had a garden view room then moved to a front facing room - much better if u don’t want a balcony. 

Only negative which I didn’t realise when booking is the roof TOP pool is only a plunge pool - 50cm deep. 

Would stay again ",5,2019,08,21
44,Solid but spotty service means better options probably exist,"If it’s location, location, location that you want then the Mandarin Oriental has it. Situated on Passeig de Gràcia it has easy access to the main sites, shopping and endless restaurants. The rooms are solid if not expansive (not unusual for a city hotel) and the beds comfortable. However, what the hotel lacks is 5 star service and a top notch restaurant. It is not to say service is or the existing restaurant are bad. It’s just they are not memorable, or outstanding which at this price point they probably should be (the exception being the porters/door staff who are good). On the roof top, the service is similarly patchy. The individual staff are helpful/nice but drinks take a long time, and orders are often confused. Given views at sunset there is probably little reason to get upset but I left thinking there must be better 5 star offerings in Barcelona.
Ps the city is fantastic though!",4,2019,08,20
44,Beautiful hotel in the heart of it all!,"The Mandarin Barcelona is in a beautiful building on Passeig de Gràcia where you can find any high end shop you can imagine as well as two of Gaudi’s beautiful homes just a few blocks away.
Service is exceptional as expected. The concierge service got all tours, tickets, drivers and restaurant reservations ready for us prior to arrival.
The rooms are modern and comfortable. Although slightly tight for American standards, much more spacious than other options.
The pool at the roof is fantastic, although much smaller and shallower than you would imagine from the photos. Unfortunately, the pool area is quite full and we were not able to sit for food service any of the days we were there. You would never imagine that reservations are a must for this area, so keep that in mind.
That and the fact that both bars close quite early, for European standards, are the only negatives I see for the property.",5,2019,08,18
44,Luxury in Barcelona,"We have stayed at the Arts Hotel and the Gran Florida Hotel, each of which we enjoy for different reasons.  if you are looking to stay in downtown Barcelona, the Mandarin Oriental is the hotel for you.  Everything from the staff to the food to the suits was top notch.  By far, the Mandarin is the most luxurious hotel in Barcelona.  The Arts is fantastic if you want a beach scene and the Gran Florida is amazing for the views of the city.  But the Mandarin is in the heart of the city and separates itself from the others with the level of service offered.",5,2019,08,17
44,A Wonderful Staying Experience to Be Remembered,"Me and my family stayed at this luxuriously appointed hotel which is conveniently located right on the celebrated Passeig de Gràcia. We enjoyed our adjoining rooms with cozy balcony and had a great dining experience at Terrat on the roof top and also the  Blanc. Services provided by the hotel employees were very attentive, which made our Barcelona visit the most unforgettable one.",5,2019,08,13
44,The best hotel in Barcelona,"It is probably the best hotel in Barcelona. I loved the way in the hotel, everything was perfect except the fact that the staff outside the hotel was not so attentive and welcoming and the room was a bit small considering the ",4,2019,08,11
44,Nice terrace with great views,"Loved the terrace there! Oysters with different sources are amazing! Due to late check in, they made a complimentary wine, it’s nice of them. 
Chocolate and desserts are super delicious, try them with coffee.",5,2019,08,08
44,"Started off Rocky, But They Fixed It","This hotel is beautiful, the staff is wonderful, and the location is excellent.  We started our stay in a room that had no functioning storage.  That was super annoying.  But, after getting upset, the manager showed us two additional rooms and we selected one.  The staff also moved all our luggage.  Additionally, management made it up to us with some goodies and a much sought after reservation.  Anyone can make a mistake.  The breakfast was plenty and varied. The roof bar is gorgeous with breathtaking views.  I would stay here again.",5,2019,08,01
44,Luxury in Barcelona,"If you want a hotel that speaks luxury and style this is the place to stay! Of course the name Mandarin Oriental speaks for itself in quality, design and luxury. It is definetly a beautiful hotel in a great location. The rooms, atmosphere, service and food are all seven star. 
Highly recommended especially during winter. ",5,2019,07,29
44,Outstanding,"Excellent:
- Excellent bedrooms, just renovated as the hotel celebrates its 10th anniversary.
- Great terrace on the top floor, with good food and a nice view. You cannot swim in the « pool » up there, but there is a nice indoor swimming pool in the spa.
- Service is great as well.
- Location is perfect.

Not so good:
- The food for lunch and dinner in Blanc is disappointing (too bland and ordinary). On the other hand, breakfast is fantastic.
- The view from the « garden » rooms is not as nice as the view from the « boulevard » rooms.

Overall, an outstanding hotel.",5,2019,07,28
44,Tops in the World,"There is nothing to say about this hotel except WOW.  Our experience at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona was incredible.  United lost our luggage on our inbound flight and we arrived for our 3 day stay with the clothes on our back and a few odds and ends.  The staff immediately had an emergency kit sent to our room with all of the essentials needed to get by.  They constantly were checking on our bags and checking with us to see what we needed.  No contact solution, no problem, we’ll have someone go to the pharmacy and get it for you!  The level of service and attention to detail provided by the staff is beyond 5 star.  I’d give them 10 stars if I could.  We’ve stayed at many other high end properties in other major cities in the world (Belmond, St.Regis, Ritz Carlton etc) and everything they do here is a step above the rest.  The staff truly cares about making sure you have everything you need to enjoy a pleasant stay.   When our return flight was cancelled and we were forced to stay one additional night in Barcelona, they were once again more than accommodating and helpful.  Although traveling can sometimes be difficult and frustrating, the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona truly feels like a home away from home, where you are treated with an attitude that anything you need is possible!  Thank you to the amazing people who work at this hotel, keep up the great work!",5,2019,07,27
44,Superb genuine service. My new favorite hotel.,"Personable cheerful staff here is on point and really took our stay to the next level.
Housekeeping never missed a beat.
Both spa experiences were wonderful.
Great shopping nearby. Fantastic location.
Breakfast was delicious and had great variety.
Attentive service at breakfast and rooftop bar.
Falafels ordered from room service were excellent.
Bath amenities are local and high quality.
Place is really well managed. Good vibes throughout.
Looking forward to my next stay here.

44,Great views and cozy atmosphere ,Friendly service and good views though lacking a bit of atmosphere. Prices are however a bit on the high side compared to other rooftops - They did however have that Corona a friend had lusted for - and not found until then.,4,2019,07,19
44,In a class of its own ,"I am a frequent MO hotel guest, most usually Milan, Hong Kong, NY, and now Barcelona and I feel compelled to write a review for the first time. I spend approximately 200 nights a year worldwide in top 5 star unique hotels and to me the service is generally the most important part of my stay. 

Aside from the hotel being well located and modern and new, blending in nicely to the bustle of touristy barcelona the purpose of this review is only to note the service which is most important to me as I know I am going to get a superior hotel paying for the MO brand as is. 

Service: I have never seen traineees so serious about guest satisfaction as I have at this Mandarin O. Typically I assume I will get mediocre or unknowledgeable responses when dealing with a trainee but not this situation:  Stephan was exceptional and very accommodating. 

The entire staff at the breakfast is truly exceptional, they remember where I like to sit, what I like to eat, my ordering habits and things a typical wait staff does not document or pay attention to. 

Lastly, Lluis the front desk manager is in a class of his own.   He adds a personal touch and element to your stay that really makes you feel welcome at the property. He is a pleasure to deal with and makes us feel at home at the MO, I highly recommend meeting him should you have the opportunity to stay here. 

Until next time! 

Thank you 
Keith ",5,2019,07,16
44,Good hotel. Excellent Service.,"The hotel in general is very nice and the service from the team, waiters, butlers, and reception was great. No request was too big or small - they all went above and beyond every time.

The food was delicious, and the outside areas are great too. The menu is ideal with a great choice of drinks and food for everyone. I loved the bankers bar!

I heard some rooms were old and run down, but thankfully the one we were staying in was perfect. They have everything you need, and if they don’t, just ask - the team are so helpful. They also have a butler option with rooms which I would highly recommend too if you’re a bit of a night owl or party animal. They also have somebody on call 24/7 for anything.

The team were all wonderful, I will definitely be back.",4,2019,07,13
44,"Still a fan, but not a fan of MO Barcelona ","I stayed 2 nights in mid June with my husband. The hotel is beautifully styled, in a great central location that allows you to  walk pretty much anywhere you want to go. Staff is friendly, breakfast plentiful and excellent quality, and we also enjoyed a superb meal at the 2 Michelin stars Moments restaurant:an experience we would recommend. 

BUT there were a number of small episodes that left us surprised and disappointed at the same time.
1) we had to send back the Aperol spritz we ordered at the rooftop bar: there was hardly any Aperol
2) we asked for a beach towel (at the rooftop pool). 10 minutes later they came back saying they ran out and had to go downstairs to the lower ground floor spa to get one. It took 20 minutes in total from when we asked to when we got it 
3) there were no cotton pads in the amenities kit, we had to call housekeeping to get some
4) when they did the room the second day they replaced the bathrobes but forgot to bring us new ones. When we left for dinner we asked for the bathrobes and for an additional , firm, pillow. When we came back there were neither in the room. We called housekeeping and eventually we got the bathrobes and a pillow, which however wasn’t firm at all
5) at turndown service they didn’t remove /replace used ( dirty) coffee cups 
6) we had selected late checkout as FOMO benefit. In the morning of our last day I reminded the reception desk we had a late checkout. Surely enough when we got back after lunch to finish packing our room keys had been deactivated and we didn’t have access to the lift nor the bedroom anymore. We had to go back to the reception desk where we had been just 3 Hours before to get them reactivated.

While in isolation each episode is of little significance, so many of them in such a short stay were unpleasant and gave us the impression that the service level is below the other Mandarin Oriental we stayed at (Miami, Honk Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok). Maybe management in Barcelona doesn’t care as much? 
We are due to try the Mandarin Oriental in Dubai soon, hopefully we’ll have a better experience.
We are still a fan of MO, just not of MO Barcelona.

",3,2019,07,13
44,Definitely be coming back ,"We ended up staying at the MO when our original hotel told us they’d “lost” our reservation. Fortunately the MO were able to save us from sleeping on the streets and invited us to stay with them.

From start to finish the service we received was outstanding, in particular Gabriela made us feel at home on our first day and continued to look after us for the duration of our stay (including a brilliant recommendation for steak nearby!). She is a diamond, thank you! 

The facilities of the hotel are top notch, and everything about the place is luxurious and relaxing. We will be coming back! 
",5,2019,07,11
44,"Great service, rooms need refreshing","We are staying at the Mandarin Oriental now, and I am surprised by how many issues the hotel has. It is celebrating its tenth anniversary, and I would say that the interiors that were probably lovely and cutting edge ten years ago need a complete update. The carpet in the elevators is worn and gross. All of the common spaces reek of a chemical-like air freshner smell- sort of like a bad Uber smell or very bad household cleaner. If you like neutral environments or are sensitive to smells, the smell in the hallways is nausea-inducing. Our bathroom has rusty spots and stains in the shower and water closet, and the waste basket is chipped and stained. Perhaps they are aiming for non-American clientele, but I really hate the lack of privacy in the bathroom. There are sliding glass doors to the bathroom and water closet which do not close all of the way and which are see-through. Not fun if you prefer privacy and also not fun if one member of your party wakes up or goes to sleep earlier than the other as turning on a light in the bathroom illuminates the entire room. The room itself is small and lacking great amenities- we had to ask for pillows (they provide two per queen size bed,) and the housekeeping removed our shampoo and left us with three body lotions and 2 conditioners. Otherwise, the service is wonderful, and the staff are very agreeable. Breakfast on the lower level is amazing and the views from the terrace/pool floor are nice (if it’s not closed for a private party.)",2,2019,07,10
44,A Visit Worth Repeating,"We've stayed at a number of MO hotels around the world and once again we were very pleased with our stay at the MO in Barcelona.  

As many others have noted, we found the staff to be excellent and very helpful and warm throughout our stay.  As an example, one of our group had booked a larger room but happened to be given a room located just below the garden level (it might be described as partially underground) and therefore the interior was darker as the windows were located higher in the room than normal.   We then went to our room (located on a higher floor) which was much brighter.  We then offered to exchange rooms and without a moment's hesitation the member of staff said they would manage the details, move the luggage and encouraged us to go out and enjoy Barcelona.  No visit to the front desk required, no questions about billing, no issues regarding why the change was necessary - easy for everyone and very quick and efficient.  

We also had breakfast in the cafe each morning and it was excellent.  We would agree with some of the earlier comments regarding the Asian dishes - the dim sim, for example, were too large and the wrappers were far too thick - but the western dishes were mostly excellent.  Once again the staff were excellent - we had fresh waffles and the waiter offered to bring fresh berries as an accompaniment - an excellent suggestion and they were delicious and something we hadn't considered previously.  

It's worth noting that the rooms are furnished in a modern but relaxed style, the beds and pillows were very comfortable in the room we had and there was plenty of space to unpack.  Our room was a bit dark (as described earlier) but not uncomfortable.  We had only one small situation arise when the steam from the shower set off the fire alarm in the room by accident.  Once again, the staff member who visited and explained we should keep the door to the bathroom open and then he apologised to us even though we were quite embarrassed  (he was also very nice and very helpful).  

The hotel is well situated close to major shops and it's easy to walk around the area.  This was very convenient as we were able to return to the hotel during the day and drop off items, rest if needed and then head out to do more sightseeing or shopping.  The hotel is approximately 10-15 minutes by cab to La Sagrada Familia, depending on the traffic.

As you would expect the hotel is very popular and during our visit a major celebrity was arriving.  We knew this because of the large groups of teenagers strategically waiting outside the hotel for a couple of days.  However, this had no impact on our visit in any way - we came and went easily, the staff never stopped us or asked to see our room keys, etc. and always greeted us with a smile and ""welcome back"".  We may not be famous but it was nice to be recognised.  

We also enjoyed an excellent dinner at Moments during our stay (reviewed separately) making this a thoroughly enjoyable visit for all. 

We are looking forward to our next visit and the MO remains one of our favourite hotels wherever we travel.",5,2019,07,10
44,"Cigarette smoke in room; rough edges, rolling closures","I’m generally a huge admirer of the Mandarin Oriental chain. Its hotels in Hong Kong and Tokyo delight at every turn. I just left a five star review for my stay in Tokyo last month. The MO Bangkok is my favorite hotel in the world and super delightful.

The MO Barcelona was having a bad time during my stay.

My room smelled of stale cigarette smoke. More smoke came into our room each day via the bathroom vents. This property allows smoking and that can ruin a whole property. As I was checking out the concierge was fetching cigarettes and bringing them up to a guest. The hotel offered to spray masking smell all over the room and I declined - that just adds more smell. To me the smoke spoils everything.

On the first night I put the “make up room” light on when we left for dinner. We returned to find the light still on and the room not made up. We received no turn down service that night.

The light switch on the bathroom fell off. It was a glued on remote. Housekeeping re-attached loosely the next day.

My request for an extra pillow was forgotten. Had to call again.

They closed the pool the evening we were there and evicted us in the afternoon. Service at the rooftop pool was intermittent. At first they wouldn’t serve us because of the upcoming private event. But another staffer offered us the room service menu. Then the first server came back and asked us to hurry and eat because she was worried about the closure. 

I attempted to relocate to the bar. It was closed but they told me to come back at 7pm. I returned after 7pm just to me told it was now closed for private event. On the upside a manager noticed me being bounced from the bar and offered me a free drink at the mimosa patio. Thank you. The effect of the rolling closures was to give a sense of unwelcome. This was aggravated by the appearance that the “private event” was actually a guest whimsically demanding the public areas to himself and the hotel agreeing last minute to whatever at the expense of all the other guests.

The bathroom in the room was surrounded in tinted glass. OK except that if anyone uses the bathroom at night the light from the bathroom floods the bedroom.

My takeaway is that the MO brand doesn’t carry. It’s hotels amaze or disappoint on a case by case basis. The MO Macau and former MO Las Vegas had similar issues. Great properties with OK management. 

I checked out a day early and can’t recommend this property.

The MO Barcelona has a very lovely physical property. The staff clearly desired to be helpful and were always pleasant and trying to help. Dinner at the Moments restaurant was tasty and memorable.",3,2019,07,10
44,Dr,"The hotel was top notch.  The whole staff was very pleasant and couldn't do enough for you.  The complimentary breakfast was excellent and the staff accommodated any food allergies or preferences.  
The building architecture  was modern and beautiful.",5,2019,07,02
44,Beautiful hotel with excellent staff.....,"It's my second time staying in this hotel. Before the trip I thought I should stay in another hotel - just to experience something different but then remembered the hotel's excellent service, the fantastic location and everything in between. I'm glad we stayed here again. The wonderful staff spoils you so beautifully that one  doesn't feel he/she can be as happy & satisfied elsewhere. From the airport pickup to getting into your room, it was impressive to see the staff indulge and spoil you. I love how when you enter the hotel, the spa like scent that hits you- subtle & pleasant. We had a beautiful suite with champagne, fruit and chocolate to welcome us. There was big outdoor space to lounge and relax in. Another ultimate luxury were the pillows on the bed. Had to ask front desk about them and I've already ordered a couple for myself. I had the most restful sleep ever. All in all, for me this hotel can't get any better.",5,2019,06,30
44,"Great room, good enough service, not great food","The rooms in MO barcelona is well designed, and has great balcony and location. The staff is helpful and genuine. The restaurant downstairs is michelin and great to eat. But the breakfast in the main area is very mediocre, and the asian dishes are pretty awful. 

Kicker is when we checked out, they messed up my most important request. Dry ice. I needed them to secure dry ice so I can pack and transport breastmilk that I pumped for my baby. I emailed, confirmed and double confirmed with the staff. On the day, at 6AM I called to ask for the dry ice and they said oh sorry, we made a mistake of not storing the dry ice properly so theyre all vaporized. We dont have it in stock, and we cannot get another one right now. I was shocked. I had liters of breastmilk to pack. I did brinv my own frozen gel packs and frozen ice packs but they wont last 20 hours trip. I was so upset.

I went downstairs as I was leaving. The concierge and manager said sorry, and took one night off the charges. But my biggest sadness was not being able to bring these home properly, and the anger was because they said “no we cannot get another dry ice at this hour”. I mean when something is this important, or you see that its that important for your guest, just say you are trying your best since hours ago. How can a 5 star hotel not know how to store dry ice?!! How can you not have a supplier or just tell me that you tried!

Anyway, less than great. But appreciate the gesture.",3,2019,06,28
44,Snotty arrogant people,"We were simply trying to have a drink at the pool bar on the ninth floor, we had looked forward to the occasion, having read of the wonderful views the bar offered, we were turned away in that snotty way that makes you feel terrible inside - don’t go, Barcelona has better and more inviting places",2,2019,06,22
44,Perfect from the start to the end ,"   We’ve spent one week in this beautiful property, and everything was perfect! Very clean rooms , very friendly personnel, incredible Bfast, surroundings, building, location !
 We also tried their Michelin star restaurant, and the experience didn’t disappoint! Very much worth trying.  I fully recommend this hotel . 

",5,2019,06,21
44,Some service hiccups,"Very pretty hotel with a great location. But there were several service failures that were disappointing given what I expect from the brand. Several instances of a complete lack of service at the breakfast restaurant and bar. Part of my willingness to pay the M.O. price is for the service, so when that’s lacking it reduces the value if the hotel quite a bit.  ",3,2019,06,16
44,Disappointing MO Hotel in Barcelona,"Having stayed at many MO hotels in Asia, my husband and I had high expectations for our first MO experience in Europe. We stayed for 3 nights (6th-9th June) as part of our honeymoon trip. I am afraid to say it comes with lots of disappointments. I will start with the good first. The location is great. The decor is modern and the room comes in good size. We ate on the roof terrace (Terrat) and had a drink in the Banker's Bar as well as the fitness facilities/spa. The food and service were great. The main issues as follows: Check-in: We booked through the MO website for an anniversary package which includes breakfast, free drinks etc. The staff at the check seemed to be unfamiliar with the details and asked us if we want a free breakfast (MO member benefit). She then need to double check with the colleague and only clarified the package details when we asked. Laundry: Nightmare. We gave 3 clothing items to the housekeeping team for laundry and pressing on a Friday morning (face-to-face). According to the standard service, the item should be ready after 6:00 p.m. on the same day. We rang the housekeeping service on Saturday morning and was promised the items would be brought up to us asap. We then went out in the day, came back in the evening and still the items were nowhere to be seen. After 3 more phone calls in the late evening, the items finally came back to us after 10:00 p.m. Saturday. Concierge: I expected the concierge service to be top notched after many great experience in MO hotels. I felt the concierge service is somewhat lacking as it needs constant reminding. My husband and I wanted to make a restaurant reservation for a Japanese restaurant which only takes phone reservation. We went down to the concierge on the Friday and gave the staff our details.The staff made the call to the restaurant straightaway (in front of us) and was told the reservation could only be done on-line now. The staff couldn't find the details on its website but told us to leave this with her team. (The dinner reservation is for end of June). We passed by the concierge a few times after during our stay, we checked with them and there was no update. The concierge even told me on the day we checked out that her team would contact me via email once the reservation is made. And now it has been 4 days since we checked out and I still heard nothing (the restaurant does close on Sun and Mon). Overall I am disappointed with the service MO Barcelona provides.",3,2019,06,12
44,Superb property,"The MO Barcelona is just superb. While the entrance is not as grand as others and the lobby itself quite a let down, the smell in the house, the helpfulness of the staff, the great style of the well-appointed rooms and bathrooms and the awesome breakfast well compensate for the discreet entrance on Paseig de Gracia. 
The service throughout and everywhere in the property (maybe with the exception of Terrat, the bar upstairs) is flawless, caring and quick.
The room is not huge (it is Europe) but well appointed enough that we never felt on top of each other. Bathroom was awesome (except the vent in the restroom) with great water pressure and awesome roomy shower.
We tried the spa, which was great too, not exceptional but great, meeting expectations. The pool is on the very small side.
The only let down was the Terrat bar upstairs, which allows cigar smokers (not only cigarettes as expected for an outdoor space, but also cigars) and the advertised dipping pool which is no more than an ornamental water basin for decoration, Nobody in their right mind would enter or put their feet in this. 
Now a strong advice for anyone staying there, ask for the complete tour of the facilities or know in advance that there are 3 bars in the hotel (I unfortunately only discovered this after my stay as the lazy front desk staff who I thought was very friendly and caring did not bother mentioning it nor showing them to us during the tour): Terrat as mentioned above on top of the hotel, a Banks bar and a Mimosa Garden. I would have loved experiencing them but unfortunately did not know about it...",5,2019,06,11
44,Very average,"I'll start by saying the good: All the staff are very professional, polite, and eager to please

The bad: This hotel is not up to 5 star standard. Especially in the rooms you can tell that they have not used high quality materials (in the shower for example). Having stayed at 4 other Mandarin Oriental properties before (London, Tokyo, New York, Milan) I had high expectations and these were not met. Even in the bar one of the walls is covered with a very touristy map of Barcelona, which just looks cheap. Finally I don't understand how they decided to close the garden for renovations in May, rather than in the autumn or winter.

It is the most expensive hotel in Barcelona but it feels cheap inside.",3,2019,06,05
44,Absolutely perfect! ,"My first time in Barcelona and my first solo holiday - The MO was like a one away from home. Super friendly and highly professional staff made me feel so welcome. Blanc was the perfect place for me to work and relax. The Spa was amazing - had two beautiful treatments, which were perfect. So happy with my stay - I hope one day to return. Thank you. ",5,2019,06,02
44,excellent stay in Mandarin,"excellent hotel with very good service, friendly staff, nice comfortable rooms, tasty breakfasts with a wide selection of dishes; the hotel is also very well located at Passeo da Grazia; there is also a restaurant with Michelin stars in the hotel; I recommend",5,2019,05,28
44,Ticked all of the boxes with style,"From arrival until departure the staff were warm, welcoming and slickly professional. The room was large, bright, tastefully decorated kept spotlessly clean. The Breakfast buffet is plentiful with a huge selection in chilled vibe. We loved the rooftop dipping pool for sunbathing and cocktails, whilst the Spa pool was a tranquil oasis to relax. with the Metro near by and surrounded by great restaurants & bars the location is also hard to beat.",5,2019,05,28
44,Great Hotel in an Unbeatable Location,"We are a family of 4 from New York. We have travelled to Barcelona about 8 times in the past 5-6 years. We usually stay at Hotel Arts or Fairmont. This time, we decided to give Mandarin Oriental Barcelona (MOB) a try. We are glad we did.

The location of the hotel is superb. It is central to pretty much everything. Our prior stays involved taking cabs frequently. This time, we only took a cab to see a match at Camp Nou. Other than that we walked everywhere with our 8 and 10 year old boys (this time with my 75 year old father in law as well!). Staying at MOB allowed us to discover many parts of the city that we hadn't seen before.

Rooms were small but tastefully decorated and comfortable. Housekeeping was stellar. We never saw a single person from housekeeping during our stay, yet they managed to clean our rooms twice a day. I especially loved the water pressure in the shower. 

My wife and I also loved the rooftop bar which we visited a few times. Drinks are delicious and staff are very friendly.

As a last note, we had some issues with MOB's concierge but management swiftly handled them. Special shout out to Raul Levis (hotel manager), Lluis Pou (house manager) and Hector Lugo (director of food and beverage) for promptly and competently addressing our issues. They truly embodied first tier hotel hospitality. So, thank you.

We look forward to returning to MOB in the near future.",5,2019,05,15

Restaurants are excellent and gorgeously designed.  Breakfast buffet very good.  Had a standard room which was small but nice decor.  There was some type of construction at 8 am and I complained and was immediately switched to a suite.  There are two towers, the newer one houses the suites.

The property is absolutely beautiful and the rooms are the epitome of modern luxury. We are a Fan!",5,2019,04,22
44,The benchmark for 5 star hotels,"Travel with me around Spain and Portugal as I stay and review what is supposed to be the best hotel in each location.
First stop is Barcelona and I have to admit I have stayed here before.
This hotel sets the benchmark that all five star hotels should strive to achieve.
Sure, customer data bases are good, but these guys reminded me which room I stayed in last time and even remembered everyday day at 4:30 to bring a couple of gin & tonics to my room.
Splashed out for a suite which is nothing short of amazing, roomy and luxurious.
The staff make up the other 50% and these guys have a real pride in their service and their offering.
Worth every penny.
Next stop Madrid.",5,2019,04,21

Even for a brief stop, the restaurant (on ground level) had a wonderful ambience, excellent service, and the smoothies and bottled waters we ordered were very refreshing. The restrooms were probably the most luxurious I've ever seen in any hotel. We look forward to staying a night some time in the near future and writing more about the hotel then.",5,2019,04,05

The room was perfectly appointed, on par with luxury standards of the Mandarin brand. Location is in a fun shopping district. Staff was superb.

Louis took care of us every morning with service, laughter and things to do in Barcelona.  Second, special thanks to Daniel at the Concierge Desk who booked us the best excursions ever.  The food here is excellent in particular the breakfast offerings and the fresh coffee are unbeatable.  Lastly the hotel is located in the heart of Barcelona within walking distance of shops and coffee shops.  Our room was modern with all the latest features and finishes.  When we return to Barcelona, we will definitely make reservations at the Mandarin.",5,2019,03,19
44,"Service, Service and Service in an stunning hotel","Primed in the best location in Barcelona, the MO will not disappoint. We were upgraded to a deluxe suite and it was stunning, with large windows over the main street. The hotel is perfectly situated for venturing to all the sites, restaurants and various parts of the city. You can walk just about anywhere, and there plenty of cabs should you want. Breakfast is one of the best in any hotel we've every stayed, and the pool and gym is world-class. Makes you happy to come back each night...

All that said, the thing that separates this hotel from almost any we've stayed is the quality and sincerity of the service. Special thanks to Pablo our ever-present butler (not like a St. Regis butler that says hi on check-in and they disappears like Houdini), to Gabriel in concierge. Nice people that went out of their way to help and ask if you needed help. This quality of employee extends to the check-in staff, the valets and the dining venues. No request was too big, and there was a genuineness that seemed real. Aman service at MO prices...would definitely come back. Thank you MO Barcelona!",5,2019,03,17
44,Barking dogs,"Lovely hotel with very friendly front desk staff and concierge. However, I am amazed that a hotel such as the Mandarin would allow dogs, we had one barking for over an hour, yet the front desk could not do anything about it....I guess the guest left the dog alone ! 
The bar service was deplorable ignoring our table. We actually had a sweet male trainee from France but he disappeared  leaving our table to a very unfriendly waiter.",3,2019,03,11

44,Wonderful! I didn't want to leave,We entered heaven once we entered the hotel.  Every person we dealt with were trained in the art of excellence!    Nina checked us in and out with a very welcoming and wonderful smile.  We enjoyed breakfast with Luis the head waiter it was lovely speaking to him each morning.  Our  4+ hour long meal at Moments was an experience  not only was the food wonderful but our server was an excellent conversationalist  which added to the experience.  At Banker Bar we met a lovely French server who took the time to provide us with a list of towns to visit when we visit France in 2020.  We enjoyed the pool and while I was out shopping my husband enjoy a day at the spa.  We look forward to staying with your sister location in Madrid when it opens.  Warning TMI: The only negative was that the toilet paper was too thick and rough for us !,5,2019,03,06
44,Better than 5* - the best it gets,"I stayed here on the first weekend of March 2019 for a trip to propose to my now Fiancée. My thoughts as follows:

- immediate response to all requests and email queries in the weeks leading up to arriving, from a single point of contact - Nina Pont in my case who was just fantastic. 
- Franco, Daniel, Gustavo and one other gentleman on the front desk were fantastic to us the whole time. Perfectly walking the line between respect of privacy and always there service. 
- I had the room set up with rose petals, two dozen candles, flowers, champagne and food for the proposal, all don’t discreetly whilst we were out, with no charge. 
- room was so marvellously appointed, we had the garden facing mandarin suite, which was serviced twice daily. 
- Breakfast by far the best I’ve ever seen. 
- spa facilities have a dark relaxing decor that makes you want to zone out of the outside world. We had a couple’s massage and it was delightful. 
- location is brilliant and the hotel itself flawless with not so much as a flower out of place. 

I cannot wait to come here again, and to try some of the other hotels in the chain. Worth every single penny.

44,"Good Hotel, Good Value","Stayed in February which is off peak so price was quite reasonable.

Service was great. The concierge desk was just fantastic as they had all these food/restaurant recommendations and they arranged for all the reservations we wanted to try during our stay.

Room is about average (around 30m2) sized, queen bed which is also average. Pillow menu is great and cleanliness is superb. 

Bathroom is a bit cramped and poorly lit - but it was clean and the water pressure is great.

Superb location along Passeig de Gracia which is accessible to shops and restaurants. But since we were located on the second floor - you can easily hear the noise from the busy street outside.

The only downside from our stay was during check out. Two days prior to leaving, we requested for a 1:30pm late check out which they confirmed. On the day of check out, around 12:15pm, the front desk called and said we had to vacate the room already. I mentioned we were approved for the 1:30 check out and the desk simply said (bluntly) that they can only allow up to 1pm as the room has to be cleaned for the next guest. 

I can understand that we were the ones requesting for something out of the ordinary - but they should not have agreed to it, if they will not honor it. Doesn't make sense and it puts a bitter taste just as we were about to leave the property.

Wrong last impression.

Overall it was a nice and comfortable stay.",4,2019,02,22
44,RECOMMENDED!!!,"My husband booked this hotel for our short escape, a day after the Valentine's day. We arrived in Barcelona at 15 Feb in the evening and we stayed until Monday, 18 Feb.
Their services were absolutely the best.
Breakfast was the best, you can either have buffet or the foods from the menu. They also have fresh fruit and juice from each fruits.
The room was super comfy and well decorated. We are lucky to get the new room that recently been renovated few months ago, and I still could smell of the new furniture. While staying in the hotel, we were over slept because of how quiet the room was and how comfortable the bed was.
My favorite part in the hotel is the bathroom. I was totally fell in love with the bathroom.

Search no more, this hotel located near everything, metro, McDonald's, shops, Starbucks, you name it.

They greet you personally, the staff is amazing, the hotel is just beautiful, the rooms are quiet and so very soothing - the beds are heavenly.  The spa is top rate - with a steam room.   I can not say enough about this establishment and this staff.  Unfortunately we did not have time to enjoy the Michelin restaurant for dinner, but we did enjoy Blanc for breakfast.

44,Almost M.O.,"I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Las Vegas many times before it changed brands.  It always felt like a second home.  I have also stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo - an exquisite experience.

I can't provide the same raves for the M.O. in Barcelona.  When I checked in, I was not provided an upgrade per my arrangement with the American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts (FHR) program. I was also told at check-in that the FHR benefit of an 85 euro discount would not be honored for the spa service I had pre-booked. After I conveyed that I would call Amex, I received a call in my room about 30 minutes after checking in that an upgrade was available.  I spent two nights in the first room, which was lovely and suited me just fine.  However, both mornings there was hammering and banging above my room.  After the second morning I called and commented on the noise.  The front desk called back to convey that the noise would continue throughout my stay and that a suite could be provided to me.

A burger I had at the restaurant was full of gristle and the bar was closed for an extended period for an evening without an alternative.  I paid way too much at the spa for services to get the discount.  (The manicure/pedicure I had was relaxing in the moment, but the polish lasted only four days.). The breakfast buffet was lovely, however, and the location is unmatched.

Based on my previous experience with M.O., I would suggest that this location it not up to M.O. standards.  If you've never stayed at another M.O. you may find this hotel to be just fine.  But compared to the previous M.O. in Las Vegas and the queen-of-an-experience in Tokyo, I would suggest that frequent M.O. customers will find it to be lacking.",4,2018,12,27
44,Amazing stay - celebrating 25th anniversary ,"This is a relatively new hotel in the gothic quarter, close to many historic sights. Spacious, well appointed rooms, superlative attentive service and fantastic food. 

When they learned that we were celebrating a special occasion, the chef created a surprise - a marvelous dessert for my wife and I to enjoy in the room. 

Their in house restaurant - Moments - has two Michelin stars and is one of the best meals we’ve had in a while. We are vegetarians and have several other dietary restrictions which the chef accommodated with a smile and created a superb multi course meal, including a vegetarian ceviche to die for! The flavors just exploded with each bite. 

We will stay there again. ",5,2018,12,25

44,star in barcelona,Perfect location! Amazing staff - always want to help you and make your stay exclusive ! Nice desing! Love it Deluxe suite is just wow! Terrace is very good idea to see the ambience after wake up and to watch amazing architecture !,5,2018,12,17
44,Ultimate luxury in Barcelona,"Excellent hotel after a short stay. 

Everything that one would expect at a Mandarin property - from attention to detail, warmth of staff, beautiful interiors (rooms and common areas) was clearly evident in this property. I particular love how tastefully discrete the entrance is from the main busy street. Walking into the property from the crazy mid day human traffic was like stepping into a giant spa where you're automatically relaxed as you walk up that ramp.

As usual, staff are warm and more than accommodating as one would expect from a Mandarin. While I didn't eat at any of the restaurants, the quality of room service is excellent.

Definitely the best hotel in Barcelona. While I've also stayed at the Hotel Arts (Ritz Carlton) by the beach which is also an excellent hotel, it is too big and chaotic so the Mandarin is definitely the preferred choice.",5,2018,12,12
44,Fantastic hotel,"We came early so the hotel offered us snacks and coffee at the bar.
Rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable. We loved the details they put a robe and slippers for my son.
The concierge team were amazing they recommended lovely places and restaurants. 
The breakfast was average but we had Lebanese food for dinner and it was delicious. 
Location was amazing everything was with in walking distance. 
Highly recommended hotel. ",5,2018,12,11
44,A destination hotel,"The Mandarin Oriental is everything you could want in a luxury hotel. Our room was perfect, the staff gracious, extra services handled professionally, and the location wonderful. You feel privileged as you walk up the ramp to the entrance. The restaurant was beautiful both in its design and in it’s cuisine. The breakfast was lavish with local and international products; you can order from the buffet which includes items off the a la carte menu. Don’t miss the Banker’s Bar.  I give it my highest recommendations.",5,2018,12,09
44,Great rooftop bar,Visited the rooftop bar at the mandarin oriental whilst in Barcelona. The setting is beautiful and the service is great. The cocktails were above average. Great place for pre-drinks. The view isn’t fantastic but the atmosphere makes up for it. ,4,2018,12,08
44,Best hotel in Barcelona ,"Located at Passeig de Gracia the Mandarin Oriental offers a luxury escape in the midst of the turbulent and busy heart of Barcelona.

The service is superb. The rooms are cool and stylish and functional.",5,2018,12,07
44,Exceptional Stay,"The most fantastic hotel. The staff are welcoming and efficient, the suites are beautiful, the breakfast is amazing and overall stay was exceptional. Thank you so much for the warm hospitality and wonderful stay!",5,2018,12,05
44,Very good hotel but recommend with reservation; consider alternatives,"This is a hotel that should be rated excellent but lacks a few things that would get that rating. We had two connecting deluxe boulevard rooms. The rooms were a bit cramped and not designed very well as hotel rooms despite the fact that they are lovely. (I'd hate to see the smaller rooms.) The air conditioning controls are almost hidden along a black wall; good luck finding them in the dark. There is no nightlight in the bathroom except to turn on a whole set of nightlights that runs throughout the room. There are hardly any drawers to allow you to unpack. There are no clocks in the room unless you ask for one. The shower is excellent and easy to operate. The television could have used something like YouTube internal to the TV system -- my kids were bored with the TV because they didn't have devices to hook up to it. The gym was a real disappointment; it has just enough room for 1 person to use the one piece of weight-training equipment and it is a narrow space that is difficult to navigate with more than 2 people at a time (unless they are standing on a cardio machine). They have a pretty large indoor pool with a cool sauna beside it but considering its relative lack of usage and the fact that it closes at 9pm, it was a poor allocation of space against the gym which is open 24 hours and which I used late night. David, the lead concierge, is very good but it would help if he was given some opportunity by the hotel to play tourist for a day or two and actually see some of the things tourists see so that he could know what to recommend (ie: the evening show at the Casa Mila a few blocks away). I was disappointed that the concierges were recommending sites they hadn't seen themselves. The other concierges were trying to be helpful but were more clueless than concierges at a Mandarin Oriental ought to be. On the plus side we were referred to an excellent fish restaurant across from Casa Mila (number 300 on that street) a few blocks away for a great dinner which also offered service at 7pm (hotel restaurant starts up at 8). The concierge also arranged to have some art projects delivered to the hotel when we couldn't pick them up ourselves. On the down side, they sent us to funicular rides going to another part of town than we thought we were being sent to even though they had drawn the route on a map for us, had no clue that the Labrynthe Park was closed for a month even though they several times looked up the official website that clearly said so, and could have saved us an hour if they told us to go on the funicular in the opposite direction where lines are consistently much much shorter. Pre-arrival we asked for suggestions for things to do with the kids; more knowledge here would have helped provide us with better suggestions which we wound up getting online from places such as Viator which offered a family mosaic-making class. The hotel's printed children's guide suggested the Miros Foundation (a modern art museum) which everyone agreed would be boring to the kids. HIghlights of this hotel include the valet staff at the entrance where they check with you to make sure you are going somewhere in a taxi that makes sense. Another highlight is food; breakfast buffet is excellent (lots of interesting Arab specialties on it) and dinner in the Blanca restaurant was also excellent. The restaurant brought us whatever we asked for and did a good job of making things for the kids that they liked. The location of the hotel is excellent especially considering some other hotels like the Ritz Carlton that are out of the way. The hotel manager was nice about letting us use our Amex spa credit for F&B instead when we couldn't get convenient appointments. There was noise outside our hotel room one night for a street fair; the hotel apologized but didn't offer us anything other than a room change which by then was beside the point and was going to involve the same size rooms we weren't enjoying anyway. The real problem with this hotel is that you are paying 500 Euro a night per connecting room and that should buy a decent amount of hotel room and a good gym. The next step up is a junior suite at roughly 1,800 Euro per night which is insane. You can go a few blocks down the same street to the Hotel Majestic which for the same 1,000 Euro a night would give you a really good setup with a junior suite and an executive room and which also has a decent gym and which recently won an award for best breakfast. We visited the property for a site check; service would not be as personal and the place is more crowded but for the traveling family spending 1,000 Euro a night there is no comparison and the property is listed with Amex Platinum. I'd be inclined to try it out next time I visit. The Mandarin is definitely a good hotel, but it could be better for its price and it should offer the ability to trade up at something more affordable than its current price list.",4,2018,11,27
44,Wonderful stay,"I went to celebrate my friend's birthday, thank you the hotel team they arranged the surprise for him and he enjoyed very much.  The hotel was beautiful and the team was friendly and helpful.The location was excellent that you can do shopping or dining just at the corner.I will come back again!",5,2018,11,25
44,Absolute perfection!,"Had the pleasure of staying here for five nights. Our room was incredible. Splurge for the larger room with patio. The staff were amazing. The roof top pool was to die for and the Peruvian inspired ceviche menu was on point. Loved hanging out in their mimosa garden listening to jazz. Their indoor pool was a tranquil oasis. We loved it so much there were days we didn’t leave at all!  Above all else, the staff were absolutely on point but never overtly ingratiating. Had the pleasure of staying at Mandarin hotels in Vegas, Thailand and New York and I have to say, this one rivaled Thailand in client appreciation. ",5,2018,11,21
44,Great location ,"This hotel is located in the center of the shopping district in Barcelona. It is close to,everyplace you want to be. The hop on hop off bus stop is immediately outside the hotel.
The staff is very solid and helpful.
The breakfast was provided for us as part of the reservation. The spa was very limited with a pool and gym. It was awkward to have to be escorted around like we were imposing. I am not that smart. It try to get out of the changing closet. The handle is so small and indiscreet I finally found my way out. That would have been embarrassing  to be locked in the changing room.
My only complaints were the size and subsequent pricing of said . I mean the room had zero  room. The bathroom had no door on the stall nor the shower. As a result the water splashed all,over the floor and was slippery.each bathroom has 1 sink and very limited counter space for your toiletries. Actually they had lots of room for my stuff but my wife had none .
There were chairs in the Halls that were clearly placed there by the residents of the rooms so that they could move around in the tiny rooms.
The hotel is under construction on several floors which was not disclosed at reservation time. We had requested that we have a room not located but the elevator and we were placed far away from the passenger elevator. However our room was directly next to....the freight elevator and we were rewarded by housekeeping carts running over the threshold at all hours of the day.
But there were no other brand name hotels within the immediate area and as a result this was the choice at hand. For $500 per night we were hoping  for more. In the end the location was the thing and that we got
Good fun restaurants nearby and as states shopping is abundant as well as sites gaudi presence apparent ",3,2018,11,09
44,Wedding Bliss,"We stayed at the MO for several nights to attend a wedding in BCN and came away a bit disappointed at the room we stayed in.  Since it was on the 2nd floor, it was facing the floor of the courtyard & the view was blocked by a row of shrubs.  The room was smaller than anticipated and the TV was much smaller than most other hotels I’ve stayed at.   Bathroom was nice and spacious though and the beds were quite comfortable.   Plenty of amenities were available.  The property is located in a great area with plenty of shopping and restaurants nearby (I suppose this is what we are really paying for).  Staff at front desk was courteous and efficient.  Overall a pleasant stay.",3,2018,10,31
44,Fabulous attention to detail and service,Perfect location to sightsee or shop. Staff fantastic and butler service exceptional. Food on rooftop limited menu and not food. Breakfast service spotty. Not enough help and serving too many tables. Our suite very nice and terrace very nice.,4,2018,10,30
44,Best hotel in Barcelona,"If you like to enjoy hotels when you feeling like at home. Where service are on the top. You should choose MO Barcelona.Such cozy, home feelings in 5 luxury hotel I did not feel anywhere.The location are perfect, in city center.Breakfasts will give you a great choises (freshs, fruits, international cousines and etc.)I did not use UNFORTUNATELY the inside swimmingpool and gym but I saw that and it is great! ",5,2018,10,30
44,Super relaxing time,"The hotel is great - fantastic service, room, comfortable bad, bath amenities  - everything. 
We were staying during Christmas holidays and the decoration of the hotel was also stunning. 
Excellent service and what was also great that in the room we every time had some small complements during our stay each day. Our Mandarin room was not really big but still it was really comfortable. And also there was kimono bathrobe to wear as well from natural materials. We enjoyed our stay very much! Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,10,28
44,THE PLACE TO STAY,"Dot every I and cross every T is what the Mandarin Oriental experience was for us!  The hotel is beautiful, the rooms were nice.  When we arrived we were welcomed with a beverage and the check in was VIP.  The hotel apologized that they were not able to give us an upgrade but honestly it was not missed - the room was great.  The roof top bar is not to be missed - giving you a beautiful view of the city.  The next day I scheduled a facial - Honestly it was the best facial I have ever experienced.  The esthetician was amazing the product that they used was fantastic.  I loved every second of my facial.  The breakfast at the hotel was also wonderful - so many wonderful choices and a great way to experience the local cuisine.  Thank you Mandarin Oriental for a wonderful stay in Barcelona!",5,2018,10,28
44,The best hotel in BCN,"I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel for five nights.From the time you arrive at the hotel you will feel the distinguished service.Their doormen are well trained.They will deliver your luggage in time.
All the staff at the front desk are very professional and always smile from start to finish.All the details they pursue are perfect. This hotel is very convenient in any place in the most central part of Barcelona.
Believe me, you will not be disappointed.",5,2018,10,24
44,Two days in Barcelona,"We spent two days in Barcelona at the Mandarin Oriental hotel. I stayed there few times and it's always perfect. It's not a bieutiful hotel in terms of architecture bit the service is great and it's very well located to enjoy the city.
Rooms are small but nice. 
The swimming pool on the roof is small but enough for a quiet afternoon at the pool. 
Careful no spa at the hotel.
My wife asked for a simple treatment and they had to call outside services.
Still nice place to enjoy Barvelona in a Palace.",4,2018,10,24
44,Elegante and super,"Great place, a luxurious hotel which has a lot to offer. Great employees and helful. 
Maria from the Front office is so attentive of our needs.i
HK team dis a great job and so polite.
Will always choose Mamdarin for my business trips.",5,2018,10,17
44,Another Case of Food Poisoning at a Mandarin Oriental Hotel,"My wife and I recently spent 3 nights here. Just before checking out to board a cruise ship, I had a hamburger for lunch. Within 4 hours I became violently ill. I was quarantined for 2 days, rehydrated by IV, and had a restricted diet and limited activities for the remainder of the 7 day cruise. I notified the hotel manager, and when he denied responsibility, I notified the CEO of the MO hotel group. Mr. Riley failed to even acknowledge my emails. 

MO’s excuse was that I must have eaten the contaminated food elsewhere - even though I had pointed out that my wife and I had identical tasting menu dinners for 3 nights (all at Michelin starred restaurants), and had all our breakfasts at the MO. The only differences in our food for 3 days was that before checking out, I ate a hamburger and my wife did not. I became ill and she did not. The hamburger was blood red rare even though I ordered medium rare. It’s hard to avoid responsibility given those facts, but that’s exactly what MO did. 

A quick search reveals multiple cases of food poisoning at Mandarin Oriental hotels, including one at the MO Barcelona reported in 1/17. The author of this review also mentions the failure of management to offer any consideration other than another meal. MO totally failed to live up to it’s reputation for 5 star customer service, and based on numerous reported experiences, doesn’t even meet minimal hygienic standards.",1,2018,10,15
44,Fanatistic magical Second Honeymoon,"Excellent facilities, services was impeccable, room was decorated with a minimalist, relaxing, calm serene and clean environment. Public facilities, hallway, rooftop facilities, spa, restaurants were extremely clean. The hotel a really nice aroma scent throughout the hotel. Staff served you with the utmost professionalism and had a genuine courteous smile at all time. Hotel was ideally located easy accessible to public transportation and near many famous landmarks. ",5,2018,10,15
44,Perfect hotel in Barcelona,The Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is one of the finest hotels I have ever stayed in. The room was huge and beautifully appointed. The service was almost instantaneous. Call down and moments later there was a knock on the door. The breakfast was in the main dining area and the selection was excellent and well prepared This is one great hotel,5,2018,10,15
44,Fab!,"I recently stayed here on a business trip for 2 nights and the hotel is just amazing especially the service by ALL the staff.

The food was 5 star. The cocktails in the bar were 5 star. The room was clean and comfy. I didn’t get chance to use the pool or spa but I can imagine they were top class too.

What amazed me most of all though was every member of staff greeted me by my name. In the restaurant, the bar and at reception. I was baffled by this as the hotel has over 300 rooms. I’m still baffled by it to be honest.

I actually can’t wait to go back with my wife and enjoy it on a leisure trip.

If in Barcelona this is the place to stay if you want 5 star luxury. I’ve stayed in a lot of hotels around the World and this is probably the best of the best.",5,2018,10,11
44,Luxury stay,"First class service, amazingly comfortable bed, all you need in the bathroom including luxury bathrobs.. Expensive, yes, but very good value for your money. Pleasant view over the garden. Nice balcony to sit and relax in the evening.",5,2018,10,10
44,Bulls-eye!,"Celebrated my wife’s birthday here and it was FABULOUS! Location is perfect for shopping, wandering, sight-seeing or our favorite - dining. Staff was incredibly attentive and truly wanted us to get the most out of every adventure. El Nacional is a restaurant next to the hotel that is everything to every one. Don’t miss it!",5,2018,10,08
44,Beautiful,From the moment you walk into the hotel you are treated like a royal.  The hotel is in a great area for walking around Barcelona.  The room was well appointed and a beautiful veranda overlooking the garden.  The restaurant Moments was truly a feast of Spanish foods paired with wines.  Delicious.   The rooftop pool had fantastic views of the city skyline.  ,5,2018,09,29
44,Always exceeds even the highest expectations,"Excellent hotel in a prime location. Feel welcome and at home as soon as you leave the car. Superb professional team anticipating all your needs. Extremely comfortable rooms, specially in the newest wing or any overlooking the courtyard. Great breakfast buffet. Very good and professional therapists at the spa. Overall an excellent experience. Congratulatiuons",5,2018,09,27
44,Perfection,"We had a lovely stay here.  The building is beautiful, top rate service and our room was fantastic, with a small patio looking out back - very quiet and felt ""local"" even though it was in the central tourist district.  We enjoyed the spa very much.  Its very peaceful at the indoor lap pool - a very spa-like atmosphere.  May not be the best for children as its very quiet.  This is a hotel that will go the extra mile to make your stay enjoyable.  Highly recommend.",5,2018,09,27
44,Perfect Stay Barcelona,"Came with my wife on our Babymoon. Had a wonderful street facing room with balcony. Staff was courteous and friendly at check in, concierge, and breakfast. The spa was unbelievable and I highly recommend it. Will be back.",5,2018,09,26

2. Modern and stylish rooms and suites.
3. Delicious breakfast and dinner at Moments was superb as well.
4. Stunning view from the rooftop small garden.
5. Luxury amenities. 
Have stayed here 3 times already.  Really enjoy every moment.",5,2018,09,24
44,Business,Great stay in the Center of Barcelona. The hotel is super cool and the Terrace Bar gives you a special touch of M. O. beauty. My room was as nice as you can expect from these level of hotel but the wifi not free is a little weird. To be suggested for leisure and business. ,5,2018,09,23
44,Details Oriented,"Excellent breakfast. The turndown service was well done with a different surprise each day. The blow dryer was very strong which is rare to find in hotels. 

I found a pair of slippers under my bed when i checked in but other than that service was great.",5,2018,09,20
44,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"It is not often that I write about a 5 star hotel commenting on excellent service because, lets face it, that is what 5 star should be. However when one hotel stands out then they deserve a special mention and this hotel certainly does. We booked a deluxe room overlooking the main shopping street, the Place de Gracia, on level 4 which had a lovely view of the historic buildings in the area. The room was well appointed with adequate lighting, desk, and spacious bathroom for two people. It did not include a bath but the shower was fantastic with an easy walk in pass the robes on exit. Towels soft and products from Acqua di Palma. Our breakfast was included and the breakfast area expansive with one of the best and widest selections of top quality offerings I have seen. Gluten free bread was served each day for my wife without her asking as was a Soya Cappuccino. I indulged in a hot chocolate drink which is a custom in many parts of Spain. As we stayed for 6 days we had every opportunity to experience the service of the staff which was 5 star plus. Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona surpassed all my expectations. An outdoor roof top pool added to the enjoyment which was more of a plunge pool with views over the city and drinks and snacks on offer.",5,2018,09,20
44,Simply No Reason To Stay Anywhere Else In Barcelona!,"I can write a long note, but i can simply put it this way.......if you are looking for a great hotel with exceptional service, food, location, security, cleanliness then the MO Barcelona is your only choice",5,2018,09,18
44,Modern and Magnificent.,"Located in prime position in Barcelona, this fabulous hotel ticked all the boxes. The room was comfortable with quirky design and excellent amenities. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in away from home and the hotel facilities all excellent. Blanc restaurant served excellent breakfast and the staff noted what you liked and offered you your preferred beverages and food options from the second day onwards. Only disappointment was the rooftop pool which is only a wading pool and 60cm deep. Rooftop bar staff lovely as were those in the inside bar. We loved this hotel and would definitely return if visiting Barcelona again.",5,2018,09,17

Such incredible warm hearted highly skilled people. What a great joy and pleasure for a wonderful stay in every way. Thank you. Aaron S.",5,2018,09,17
44,"The design is amazing, the lifting rope at the hotel has gone down","I arrived at the hotel for the third time. I arrived again at the end of August 2 nights through the Amex FHR I got the room a bit late, I was told I got an upgrade but that's what I ordered in the junior suite I forgot to mention that we were 3 people on the booking I arrived at the hotel. I said at reception that we were 3 people and treated with contempt. The service at the hotel dropped and this was expressed in courtesy of the time employees, taking a very long time for things to arrive was very bad attitude! I was very disappointed after the day the hotel manager spoke to us about the problems and gave a discount of 500 shot which was nice but no fun coming to the hotel and feeling unwelcome it was a feeling I had last received at the hotel. Last year I was at the hotel was perfect hoping that the service will return to total  hotel chain 
 that I very much like.
Delicious hotel food and a perfect breakfast.",3,2018,09,15
44,Excellent,"Located on the Passeig de Gracia, it enjoys stunning views over their gardens and Casa Batllo. The service is par excellence. The interiors are Contemporary with a classic style. Stayed in the Mandarin room, its spacious with a good size terrace. Very stylish. Its expensive but definately worth the price.",5,2018,09,10
44,A great hotel!,An excellent hotel with outstanding service. The concierge was able to make last minute reservations at a number of Barcelona's finest restaurants.  The staff at the Blanc dining facility were outstanding.  Would go back to this facility in a heartbeat!,5,2018,09,09
44,Amazing Attention to Details ,"Amazing Staff! They plan anything you request very helpful and sweet. One of the cleanest hotels I've been to, they actually clear your room twice a day. As well as, I had a book and a glasses on my side bed after they cleaned, I found under the glasses the cleaning cloth and a book mark in the book I was reading. And that is just one of many details they pay attention to. I would definitely visit again. Worth the price!
Attached tonight's cute gesture.",5,2018,09,09
44,Shakey beginning but afterwards great,"It took 2 hours to get our room after being told it would be ready in 30 min. They have a holding room bar for people waiting for their rooms. They have coffee (machine didn’t work) croissants fruit.  We had a deluxe room. The holding room was empty when we arrived but soon filled up. After everyone got their room we were still there. After many trips to reception we finally got our room. Not a good beginning. But, after that we really liked the hotel. Our room was very modern as is the entire hotel. Room service was excellent. While awaiting our room I went to the concierge but he was overwhelmed and could take care of everyone’s request. They should have has 2 concierges. I was very disappointed that the Michelin starred restaurant was closed. ",4,2018,09,09
44,The service not the best ,"I go many times to mandrin all over but this time in Barcelona was so so from the beginning  

The reception not the best service speak not nice  I order suite and she try to  give me low level suite  not like it at all. 

The food from the pool bar rooftop was so so. Not so fresh 
 I pay  I like best service I wait  24 hours tell the manger come to speak with me about all the problem  

Not so good  check before you go there all the small things because is do there many issues for everything ",3,2018,09,08
44,love it,"It’s very conveniently located, walking distance to best shops and restaurants; rooms are very cool with a small patio and bathroom has a rainforest shower that I love. Breakfast is excellent and staff will make you feel like at home, (they call you by your name).",5,2018,09,07
44,Great hotel,"It is a lovely hotel with some great facilities the part I didn’t like is that most of the staff are just too obsequious, with lots of bowing going on. Yes it is an expensive hotel but I don’t need to be bowed and scraped to. However I will return because it is a lovely hotel. ",5,2018,09,06
44,Exceptional service ,"It’s perfectly located and has an interesting modern design. A very nice rooftop terrace with a bar and great views. Our room on the 2nd was disappointing for a 5 star hotel: rather small with a glass bathroom where only one person can stand. 
But: all the personal was extremely friendly and helpful. In a style you very rarely find anywhere but in Asia! Compliments!",5,2018,09,06
44,Impressive accommodation ,"Recently had the pleasure of staying here for 3 nights. Without question this may be one of the finest hotels I’ve stayed at in a long time. It’s location is perfect right above the rambler in the midst of high end retail stores. There are plenty of terrific restaurants that the concierge is more than happy to introduce you. In fact, the entire hotel staff is very welcoming and more than happy to assist you. The most memorable aspect of our stay was the sincere efforts made by the mandarin employees to make our stay perfect. We did take a massage at the spa and it was worth every extra dime. I can’t say enough about the ambience, location, and employee morale at the mandarin Oriental. I highly recommend this place!
",5,2018,09,03
44,Ravishing,"Cast among fashion houses and Gaudi buildings, in a neighborhood full of great restaurants, lies the ravishing MOBCN.  

There is a gorgeous rooftop with commanding views, including a small pool and some sun loungers. Like the rooftop at Soho House Barcelona but more intimate and refined. It is too bad they don’t have more loungers, honestly, because it would easily become a thing. 

There are rooms that face the boulevard and those that face an interior garden grove of trees. This time I had one facing the garden, with a small terrace that was perfect for having morning coffee (thanks to a quality espresso machine in the room, one of my must-have features).  

The rooms can be compact but are cleverly designed so that amenities do not suffer; every cubic inch is useful – there are hidden drawers and cabinets and pockets for various things. It shows that they are thinking of all the little things that make your life beautiful.  

The Acqua de Parma bathroom products are great and provided generously.  They furnished lip balm, pillow spray, toothbrush, mouthwash.  Housekeeping was excellent and they even wiped the screen of my device and left me a mandarin oriental screen cleaner.  It’s all the little things. Rooms are very high tech and up to date, with USB ports (in addition to sockets), electronically controlled blackout blinds, good quality WIFI (which bizarrely they charge you for if you aren’t registered with them – one negative point).  

Apart from design, style, a killer breakfast, and clutch amenities, it is the staff that realty sets it apart. They are superbly polished and well trained – not a false move.  Staff can let a great hotel down, but not here. I had the opportunity to meet the energetic FOH manger Lluis who is overseeing everything. 

The restaurant for breakfast is a bright and airy cube and the staff are exceptionally attentive and smiling. The Sunday brunch is an absolute delight, with a broad range of dishes including local favorites like fideua (the famous Catalan seafood dish), octopus salad, jamon iberico, as well as usual breakfast items, all at a very high quality.  And it’s free-flowing bloody marys and cava, which puts you in the right frame of mind for Sunday.  

The gym is stocked with new equipment – the up to date Technogym treadmills and some benches and dumbbells.  A small stretching and callisthenic area with yoga mats.  Water, fruit, earphones for cardio.  Small but functional indoor pool.  

If you want to splurge, this is a great place to do it.",5,2018,09,03
44,Yoga class + relax at the spa,We went to the mandarin oriental after having seen an event on Facebook with the amazing opportunity to enjoy a 1h Yoga class with Vanina that has been very sweet and professional . Then we had the chance to enjoy the inside swimming pool with the steering room . It was a full relaxing morning that I strongly recommend to anyone . Moreover it is to a very competitive price .,5,2018,08,21
44,perfect as always with MO,"I am a huge customer of MO around the world, with maybe 15 weeks a year in one of their hotels. It was my first time in the Barcelona branch and once again it did not disappoint. Some might say that the hotel need a little freshening but overall the experience is still exceptional. I get a bit tired of writing the same reviews about MO hotels, and to be honest if you are reading this you probably already know what you will get, so I will keep it short. It is the whole package as always, fantastic service, attention to details, great rooms, showers etc.... Internet is maybe a little slow in this hotel, but I cannot find anything else to say. Special mention to the indoor lap pool and the terrace dipping pool. Superb location.",5,2018,08,19
44,Supreme Service,As others have said the service always comes with a genuine smile and intent to exceed your expectations.  The breakfast was one of the best we have had at a hotel and or resort property.  It wasn’t about the quantity but about the quality of the food and the service attended to at the breakfast.  We were there for four days; the bed was oh so comfortable.  Enjoy...,5,2018,08,18
44,Dream birthday experience and truly warm welcome,"I've chosen this hotel to celebrate my birthday in August and I must admit this place is the best city hotel I've ever stayed. A must-stay hotel for those who want to have best of the best. Even private guides especially mark this place as best and most expensive hotels in Barcelona. Asian design, very special smell inside of the property, location at Passeo De Gracia, amazing views from the rooftop terrace, truly sexy design of SPA pool (I cannot describe this masterpiece SPA area in another words), super delicious breakfast, and of course, a unique entrance to the hotel I've seen for the first time - a bridge crossing the atrium to lobby area reminds me the entrance to some world famous modern art galleries. 

After arrival at 9 AM i was personally welcomed by General Manager, who congratulated me with Birthday as well as all reception managers. Hotel provided me with complimentary early check in at 9 AM (instead of standard 3 PM) and late check out at 3 PM on the day of departure. The most unforgettable emotions caused the room upgrade from Deluxe Room garden view to extraordinary and luxury Deluxe Suite! Concierge team also helped me to get inside Sagrada Familia, despite all tickets during my days in Barcelona were sold out. 

Highly recommended!!!",5,2018,08,18
44,Wonderful hotel,The people at the front desk were very helpful and courteous; the room was clean and served its purpose. This hotel is located right on the main boulevard in Barcelona and close to many attractions. The bakers bar was very cool; although the drinks were on the expensive side. The breakfast was probably the best we had in the three locations we visited in Spain. The concierge service was very good.,5,2018,08,17
44,The best stay in Barcelona,We stayed in Barcelona for 2 nights before we left Spain. Mandarin Oriental made our stay nice and relaxed. The hotel services were exceptional and Concirge staff was very helpful. We came to the hotel at 1030 am they gave us complimentary breakfast and upgraded our room.Check in and check out was fast and staff was very friendly and took care of all our needs .,5,2018,08,13
44,Superb Hotel!,The Mandarin Hotel in Barcelona has an excellent location. The staff make you feel at home and not want to leave. This is a very high quality managed property and their execution to detail is unmatched in this industry!,5,2018,08,08
44,Incredible 5-Star Service!,"We stayed here for 9 nights in late July/ early August and just got back.  We booked our reservation with our American Express Platinum Card, which got us free breakfast (and it is an amazing breakfast spread), an upgraded room (which the staff bent over backwards to find for us because they were completely sold out during our stay), and free wi-fi.  But the real value is in the people who work at this MO.  Starting with Lluis, who treated us like royalty and helped us with arranging all things Barcelona (including excellent restaurant recommendations) and who is a fantastic troubleshooter, Luis, who took great care of us at breakfast every morning, and Daniel, one of the concierges who noticed how sunburned I was one day and on his own initiative brought an aloe-based lotion to our room to address the problem, this staff is easily the greatest hotel staff that you are going to encounter at any hotel in the world.  You can tell they genuinely like each other and they clearly like their hotel guests and will quite frankly do anything for them.  An example?  We arrived in Barcelona late at night and found out at the airport that there was a taxi strike.  We had to take a 90 minute metro ride from the airport to the hotel.  Without our asking for such treatment, Lluis and the MO told us that they would drive us to the airport at the end of our stay in one of their sleek Mercedes Benz cars, at no cost to us.  It didn't matter to them that the taxi strike was beyond their control, Lluis and everyone else at MO only care about doing whatever they can to make their guests' stay enjoyable and comfortable.  We will definitely be back to this great hotel.",5,2018,08,06
44,July 2018 Best Service in Europe,"I've stayed in a lot of five star hotels around the world and the service at the MO Barcelona is the best I have experienced in Europe.  I cannot recommend the friendly, professional staff highly enough from the concierge to the housekeeping to the restaurant staff.  Keep up the good work!",5,2018,08,04
44,Finest Hotel Ever Stayed In! Would Give 6 stars if possible,"No detail left undone in the outstanding luxury hotel. I have stayed in luxury hotels across the world and this is by far the finest experience I have ever had. The room was spacious with an elegant bathroom. Many many fine details in the room and with turn down service including slippers, bookmark by the bed, night aisle lighting for when you need to use the restroom, and more.Wonderful balcony overlooking a beautiful courtyard. Breakfast at the hotel was sinfully good. Service impeccable. Best location on Passeig de Gracia right across from Casa Batllo. Don't miss the rooftop terrace for drinks!",5,2018,08,02
44,High quality friendly and receptive stuffs 👍🏻,This is our second visit to this hotel. I would like to commend the great and efficient services of the housekeeping teams. The lower lobby lounge has exceptionally good stuffs- Luis and Matthias made our breakfasts and dinner very lovely. Anna at The Spa was caring Ang highly skilled in curing my fatigue from the heat etc. I have been to various Mandarins in Asia and Europe - Barcelona ranks miles ahead so far. Keep up your great job👏🏻👏🏻,5,2018,07,31
44,"Tranquil, understated luxury","We stayed here for four nights, the first time at a Mondrian Oriental property. We'll definitely stay here again our next time in Barcelona. If you're looking for grandeur and big public spaces, this probably isn't your hotel. But many will appreciate the tasteful minimalist decor and the overall peacefulness of the place; there is nothing frou-frou about it. The service was impeccable.",5,2018,07,29
44,Barcelona Mandarin is perfection!,"I never write reviews but felt compelled because I feel that I experienced perfection! I have never stayed at  a hotel who's staff was this outstanding! And I want to emphasize the entire staff! On arrival the bell captains greeted me, took my bags, lead me to reception and brought me an iced tea. Irene at reception was efficient, welcoming, and worked quickly to check me in. Franco in concierge planned my three days including meals, and all dinners were excellent choices, perfect food and atmosphere, like he had read my mind! Every single employee in their restaurants provided outstanding service with a smile and only wanted to make sure your every need was met. The food was delicious, the location amazing, and if time allows the spa is remarkable. Please I highly recommend the manicure and pedicure. These treatments are far from the norm, given by a knowledgeable podiatrist, and not like any manicure or pedicure you have had in your life! Trust me! Finally, the rooms were just renovated so clean and comfortable with top of the line technology and lighting, bedding,amazing towels and wonderful products and water pressure. I don't think I left anything out. So treat yourself and book the Mandarin, and the amazing people there will take care of the rest! ",5,2018,07,27
44,Awesome Rooftop Spot (Expensive),"This place is in a great location. Even if you're not a guest, go in through the main doors, hang a right and another right for the ""terrat"" elevator. Checkout the awesome view and cute seating spots. Drinks were standardly good but expensive. Worth the price for the environment and view if you're popping in with friends.",5,2018,07,26
44,TOP TEN PROBLEMS WITH THE MANDARIN BARCELONA,"1. We paid for the top suite in the hotel. It had no view, was dark, and was overly not remotely worth the price.

2. The service was consistently frustrating and it was a struggle to get simple things done in the hotel.

3. The hotel is overall very awkward in the layout, with no true lobby, and feels like a 'miniature pop-up hotel"" that lacks a proper entrance, or hangout areas. it's as if they shoe-horned a hotel into a tiny space that is not big enough to be a proper hotel, let alone a Mandarin Property.

4. The general manager is nowhere to be found, and could care less about guest experiences. Luis, the assistant manager is equally useless and just smiles and says ""i'm sorry"" over and over for repetitive failures in service, but he is ineffective at making any improvements.

5. They don't have a hotel car for simple short distance dip-offs, and instead, recommended for us to reserve a 140 euro car to drive us 2 blocks. 

6. They failed over and over to cook our food as requested and several times undercooked meat or runny eggs needed to be sent back since they couldn't follow the simple instructions of ""well cooked"".

7. We were unable to speak to the concierge directly the entire time during our stay since they were 'always' busy and understaffed. 

8.We requested top tier restaurant recommendations, but were routinely sent to very average restaurants that served average food. When we expressed our dissatisfaction with our dining experiences and requested to the manager more fine dining recommendations, his response was "" well, all of our other guests like these restaurants.""

9. Although we had a jacuzzi hot tub on our deck, it was empty when we arrived. It required 5 conversations and visits to get them to fill it up all the way since each time they would only fill it a couple of inches and then leave, requiring us to call them back to fill it more. After finally getting it filled up enough to be usable, housekeeping would frustrate us each day by emptying it again, requiring us to start the whole process over again. 

10. Our so called butler ""Ana"" was completely useless and managed to mess up every request either by getting it wrong, or usually by not showing up for hours after she promised ""to come to our room right away"" for simple things like laundry pickup. 

This property is an embarrassment to the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group, and has turned us off forever from wanting to stay at a Mandarin. We were once devoted fans of this hotel group, but will never trust them again. It's clear that this property is not managed by anyone who cares one iota about the customer experience. They are content to change EXCESSIVE rates and under-deliver. Stay away from their fancy suites….you will only waste your money and be disappointed.",1,2018,07,24
44,Respite from Busy Barcelona ,"Amazingly situated hotel. Very discreetly located however the position allows you to access easily so much of this amazing city. 

Rooms are well appointed and very quiet. Wonderful beds. 

Service is first class, I can’t imagine a reasonable request they couldn’t fill. 

Greetings always bright and welcoming from all staff. They will go out of their way to ensure your happiness. The staff remember your name as you access different parts of the hotel. 

Love the dark and cool bar on the entry level. Gorgeous staff there. 

The breakfast assortment is abundant and delicious. Fabulous bright and stylish space. 

The concierge was very helpful with recommendations and advise. ",5,2018,07,23
44,Wonderful stay but.......,"Let me begin with the pluses. Location is great, right in center of city.  Hotel is beautiful and immaculate with an exceptional staff. There is a small but adequate rooftop pool with only a handful of chaise lounges.  There is also an indoor pool and pretty good gym. The buffet breakfast which was included with the room(courtesy of amex) was also great.  We had drinks at the Bankers Bar each night and the waiters and waitress were the best.  There was even a 19 year old intern waiter who was like a seasoned 20 year veteran.  Now some negatives.  We had 3rooms and none were ready when we arrived( we did get there very early).  1 room was finally ready around 1:00 and the other 2rooms not until 3:00.  The rooms were very small ( don’t know if all rooms in Barcelona are small) and the views were of an ugly interior courtyard.  They did have great toiletries and plasma televisions plus great housekeeping with nightly turn down service.  The last negative is the nightly rate of almost 750 euro=$900.  There are lots of hotels in Barcelona so I would compare prices and if there is a general trend toward inflated prices in July and August I would seriously consider MO.  If not, you might want to consider somewhere else.",4,2018,07,18
44,Excellent Michelin Restaurant and Good Service,"We stayed for four nights in a deluxe room with balcony. The rooms are a bit more tried than when we stayed three years ago and the bathrooms seems a bit dark and old in design. However everthing was working and clean.

They did provide a welcome amenity in terms of some cookies, but no fresh fruits that we would have prefered.

The dining options are very good and especially Moments make it worth travelling here just to eat. Superb cooking and very good service - two Michelin stars are well deserved. Also Terrat on the rooftop was very accomplished with very good ceviche and other Nikkei spescialities. Blanche is more ordinary but still ok and serve a little above average breakfast. 

The pool is unfortunately a joke - only 60cm deep so not at all a swimming pool. 

But service is good and especially the concierge and Reception staff are very good. 

We will definately be back again, but hopefully they will do a bit of remodeling in the rooms and consider a proper pool.  

",4,2018,07,17
44,THE place to stay in Barcelona,We loved the Mandarin Oriental. We booked a Studio Suite through Amex Platinum card and we were upgraded upon arrival to a larger suite. We loved the location of the hotel being in the center of all the best shopping and sights. Gaudi's Casa Batilo is across the street.  The service level was what one would expect from a hotel of this caliber. The rooms we well appointed and luxurious on all accounts. We loved the roof top bar and restaurant. We enjoyed the roof top every day. You can hang at the pool or go up for sunset cocktails. I was struggling on whether to stay near the water or in town and I am so happy that we selected to be in town. I think it is too touristy near the water and for us we enjoyed being in the heart of the city.,5,2018,07,15
44,Excellent location and superb concerige service,"The facility is what you would have expected in a five star luxury hotel and its location is superior as it is close to many scenic spots. What makes the hotel stand out is their excellent concierge team. They are all very friendly, enthusiastic, patient and helpful. The concierges are happy to answer all our questions, discuss itineraries, and catered for all our needs extremely efficiently.  We are particularly impressed by Daniel Resende.We were caught up in a very unusual situation when all the taxis in Barcelona were engaged due to a popular concert in town and we were late for a theatre booking. Daniel in his tuxedo suit ran down the street in full speed to find a taxi for us.  His dedication is very much appreciated and it is this kind of concerige service that is the soul to hotel hospitality.",5,2018,07,15
44,My mother’s purse stolen at breakfast,"The hotel is fine but definitely not to come back. Management should be wary of staff as I cannot understand how my mother’s purse was stolen at breakfast in this five star hotel and staff did not catch them at cameras?
They did not call the police and did not offer compensation.",1,2018,07,13
44,Excellent hotel of the highest standards - apart from Moments Restaurant,"We stayed for 10 nights at the MO in Barcelona – 4 days at a conference and then some holiday either side. The hotel is a pleasure to stay in – comfortable, modern and with the most amazing friendly and attentive staff – for example, within a day they knew which beverages we drank at breakfast. We stayed in a room with a small terrace overlooking the central courtyard/Mimosa garden. As a result this was very quiet and nicely positioned. Rooms facing the front will overlook the busy Passeig de Gracia. The Mimosa garden is peaceful and a good place to sit and read or work – hardly anyone used it – although a wedding function took it over on our last Saturday (more later). The roof garden with terrace and small pool provide a great view over the city – although the space is limited. The fitness centre and indoor pool and spa are also excellent.

Breakfast in the Blanc restaurant every morning was excellent as were the two evening meals we had there (see separate review) – fresh, high quality ingredients, good portion sizes, friendly staff and good value. Indeed the staff throughout the whole establishment are warm, friendly and operating at the highest standards.

The Michelin 2 star Moments restaurant, however, was a huge disappointment: we ate there on our last night and had the 13 course tasting menu with wine pairing. Eating at Moments was the low point of our dining in Barcelona, which included noisy tapas bars, restaurants by the harbour, the lovely monastery restaurant at Montserrat and three great local restaurants (2254, Louro and Rao) all of which are an easy walk from the MO – in fact Rao (see our separate review) stands head and shoulders over all of the others and there we tasted the best food we’ve had in ages, at a good price and in a restaurant with great staff and a fantastic ambience & atmosphere. The evening at Moments was completely ruined by the disco from the wedding that was occurring in the Blanc restaurant, one pane of glass away. The noise was over powering and drowned out the music playing in Moments and sadly spoilt our last of 10 otherwise wonderful days in Barcelona. We called the manager and asked if we could complete our meal on the roof terrace away from the noise but they said this wasn’t possible. Both the restaurant manager and duty hotel manager were very apologetic and were very gracious by not charging us for the meal and giving us a small gift the following day and so they dealt with the situation at the time very well. Overall, however, a hotel and restaurant of this caliber shouldn’t be hosting noisy events, which must also have disturbed all of the other guests both dining and using the bar, unless they have separate facilities to do so.",5,2018,07,13
44,"Fabulous service, great location","The hotel is superbly placed, right in the middle of the city, within walking distance of the most popular areas, and also close to the main subway and bus routes.  The room was very comfortable (I slept very well), clean and well appointed.  But the thing that stood out was the service:- genuinely pleasant, cheerful and incredibly helpful staff everywhere.  Whether having breakfast, enjoying the view from the rooftop terrace, or simply checking in, nothing was too much trouble.  Loved the city, loved the hotel, and will definitely be back.

For some reason I am having trouble with some parts of the review form on my iPad - 5 stars for location, sleep quality and location.",5,2018,07,13
44,NM,"The location and staff are amazing. The hotel and staff are top quality! 
My only complaint is because our room was located on the main avenue there were noise issues during the night. When we next come back we will probably stay there again.",5,2018,07,10
44,"Mandarin Barcelona: 3 European Cities: Madrid, Barcelona,Venice  3 Five star Hotels, 1 very Outstanding Hotel","Unable to find two seats together on a flight to Madrid, Had to choose the Barcelona Route...not a difficult alternative to choose when going on a 20 day vacation... So 4 days in Barcelona, became the first highlight of our trip...
The Mandarin Hotel Barcelona was the next highlight of our visit. 

With an early arrival we were kindly offered Breakfast or spa to get over our 15 hr. journey from the Caribbean.

Carlos at reception was personable and Mandarin excellent, making sure we relaxed and not worried about belongings or anything...offering us a shower at the spa, before we ventured into the city, as check in was later in the day. This was perfect and very Mandarin !!!

 On second day he learned I was a Wine Consultant on my spare time and surprised us with a bottle of local area wine made by famous winemaker Palacios...

We enjoyed the Morning buffets with top quality Iberico Ham, delicious Scottish salmon and eggs coked to order. In a sunny central court area of the hotel

 The Terrat on the rooftop was an Oasis in the middle of the city...with casual special fare by famed Peruvian Chef Gaston Acurio and good wine choices... 
The lap pool looked very attractive...and staff was attentive. City views great and expansive for a 9th floor...

Several concierge team members offered us help and suggestions and all were ""on target"". 

On our second day we enjoyed outstanding = travel rejuvenating body massages each... (couples massage not available...) Purchased thyre unique  aroma kit diffuser
for us and friends who stayed at this same Mandarin a year prior... (Only on-premise sale offered)...Very relaxed and reasonably priced as other Mandarin Oriental Hotels

Location, Location, Location: Paseo de Gracia...we walked everywhere we needed go.
1st night we returned late after dinner and walking the avenue... Thinking of a night cap at the Hotel... when I asked for the bar, I was told Bar had just closed...when I flashed my room key... Reception turned the situation around by saying: "" If either of you two can locate the secret door entrance, she would flag us in as a late special exception""... We thought she was joking when escorted to a small artsy room with furniture and framed pictures,,, we started touching frames, tables and chairs...and vuala: The Vault was opened for us... (remember this Property used to be a Bank).
Again,  very Mandarin !!!
Safe deposit boxes everywhere , comfy lounge areas, good looking and well dressed final hour hotel guests and super friendly bar tenders despite the fact they were about to close... naturally: Mandarin Hotel Mixologists !!!

We gratefully thanked the front desk on our way to our room...

In the mornings we and you can enjoy complimentary use of the large spa swimming pool for wake up laps...

Room was perfect and very Mandarin in every sense of the word... Aroma, Pillow choices, top tier Aqua di Parma toiletries, large windows, quiet, large soaking tub for two in a 4 division bathroom.

As we were departing, an attractive Geisha dressed lady bid us farewell and asked we return soon...

Last but not least: The bell men were always attentive until the last minute... we had local friends taking us to the AVE train station but had to use underground public parking as Paseo de Garcia was very congested... Guess what? The Mandarin bell man took our luggage all the way two floors down to the car...

So Mandarin !!! and so very 6 stars !!!!

Our compliments to all staff and management !!!

No wonder you have made us natural Mandarin Fans...

44,"Excellent Location, Property and Staff","We stayed for 3 nights at the MO in Barcelona - probably one of the most beautiful MOs we have stayed at. The property used to be an old bank and they’ve kept some of the theme across the whole decoration. 

Pros: 
- Great Location: If you are visiting Barcelona for tourism, you cannot beat this location. Walking distance to downtown Barcelona (think Plaça Catalunya, Las Ramblas, etc.) and if you want to go a bit farther away, the hotel is located right next to a subway station. 
- Overall Decoration: The hotel is beautiful, it has an memorable entrance where every detail has been thought out. 
- Excellent Rooms: We stayed at a deluxe garden room (hear the suites are beyond anything you can imagine), and it was a beautifully put together room. Decoration was simple yet luxurious. 
- Bathroom: I am a fan of MO bathrooms. They are so comfortable, and their showers are amazing ALWAYS. Excellent water pressure if that is important for you. Of course it was always spotless. 
- Service/Staff: As always, the highlight of any visit to an MO. From the minute you walk in, you feel welcome, and they really don’t know how to say “no”... they’ll just find a way of figuring it out. 
- Food/Drinks: We had drinks at the Banker’s bar, and they were very nice and had breakfast at the Blancs restaurants. They had a good buffet option, but we went with a la carte options. Very tasty. 

Cons: 
- Very few cons - but just one. Although the linens were amazing, I was not 100% in love with the quality of the bed. The pillow was not thick enough and it was a bit uncomfortable for my taste (probably my only mistake was not asking for another style of pillow?). ",5,2018,07,08
44,"Great place, but a few items to note...","Still love this hotel after several visits, but the 5th star is a bit tarnished.   What I continue to love about this hotel is its location, design, comfort and sense of calm.   Rooms are immaculate and designed to make you feel relaxed and get a wonderful sleep night or day.   Rooms have the best blackout shades I have seen.   The windows are thick and block out all noise from the exterior.  Air conditioning is strong, keeping the room cool at the peak of summer, and the beds have duvets with big fluffy pillows.   Very comfortable indeed.  We were kindly upgraded to a junior suite which has the benefit of more room, a powder room and a huge soaking tub.  Toiletries are from Aqua Di Parma.   

Aside from the room, we enjoyed hosting friends at the Banker’s Bar, using the indoor pool and steam room.    When we used the gym in the morning, staff was readily on hand to wipe down equipment, hand out water and refresh towels - all in a a tiny gym.  I would do a special call out to the friendly and helpful outdoor attendants who recognized us by name, changed money for us, got taxis, etc.   All staff were friendly and greeted us.   I would also say that this hotel is very well located on a wonderful street close to Gaudi favorites,  great shopping and great restaurants.   

The bits from our stay that tarnished the star include: (1) Trying to get a shaded spot to eat lunch at rooftop Terrat when very few diners were present.  We were eventually accommodated, but after 30 minutes, it seemed unnecessarily complicated.  (2) At breakfast, when we entered Blanc on both days, several tables were left with dirty dishes for extended periods of time (15 mins or so). (3) We returned to our room at 3pm one day to find that our room had not been serviced - we had to call.  

In all, none of these items mentioned above would prevent me from returning, but they are worth calling to management’s attention.   Regardless, I would still say that this is the best place to stay in Barcelona.   ",4,2018,07,05
44,Consistently Outstanding,"MO consistently delivers a superior experience and MO Barcelona is no exception.  My family of four utilized the airport transfer.  When we pulled up to the hotel, the front desk and valets were ready.  They quickly whisked us through the hotel and completed the registration process.  When we think about the rating of a hotel we consider the physical property itself, location, services and quality of staff.  In all four areas, MO Barcelona excels.  The hotel itself is a complete remodel of an old bank building.  The heritage of the bank is woven into the fabric of the hotel in a smart and elegant way.  The rooftop terrace lounge is a great place for casual tapas and drinks overlooking the city.  The rooms are typical MO and of high quality.  As you can imagine, the full services from spa and underground swimming pool to multiple restaurant selections are available.  All delivering excellence.

However, what makes the MO special is the quality of the staff.  They are the pinnacle of professional yet also warm, friendly and approachable.  It is amazing how they remember your name throughout the property.  My son is a soccer fan and with the World Cup going on, it was a topic of conversation with the staff every day.  You could see the fun inter-play of the staff and management as they discussed their favorite teams.

Bottom line, the MO delivers everything you would expect from a high-end luxury hotel.  In Barcelona, this is my go to hotel.",5,2018,06,27
44,Lovely hotel,"Me, my wife and our baby boy stayed 5 nights at mandarin oriental barcelona. It was our second time in this hotel and it was even better this time. Location is perfect in the heart of passeig de gracia. They are super baby friendly. Room was great and equiped with baby bed, changing table ,bathtub and a welcome sweet for infant. This time we had complementary wifi in the room. Staff were very friendly and always trying to help. I am very pleased with all hosting. It is an expensive hotel but absolutely worth it.",5,2018,06,26

My rooms was very well appointed, magnificent design and easy to use, I did not have to take an engineering course to turn lights in and off, use the TV or phone systems, being able to easily find plugs for my phones and MacBook. Lighting settings were perfect for each time and occasion during my stay.

Worth staying!,4,2018,06,20
44,Roof top dining.,"Stunning setting,superb cuisine, wonderful service.Strongly recommended.We have been to several rooftop bars/dining venues in BCN, but this was definitely the best.lt's location in the city's premier street make it very easy to access.",5,2018,06,18
44,Not what you would expect,"My wife and I came here to celebrate our anniversary. Upon arrival, we were greeted by friendly staff (very friendly staff here). We stayed in the deluxe boulevard room.

Things I liked:
- Nice views and great location
- Friendly staff
- Nice breakfast and good quality food
- Pretty decent spa
- Put rose petals on our bed (real ones)

But the rooms are not what you would expect of a 5-star hotel:
- Terrible layout, makes you feel like the rooms are going to squeeze you
- Slide door bathroom with a see-through panel (aquarium style) makes it really awkward for sharing a room
- SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE BED (TERRIBLE MATTRESS AND PILLOWS)
- General interior is little bit too Ikea (looks too cheap for a 5-star hotel)
- In general certain items in the room felt worn off and need replacing
- Doesn't have a bath

They also charge you half a day rate for late checkout, despite the issues we encountered during check-in. Upon arrival, they messed up our room and gave us a twin bed by mistake, and while they changed it, we ended up staying in the adjacent room with a closed door  (joint room style). These type of rooms make me always feel uncomfortable. Not what you expect you paid for, despite being €625/night.

Despite the niceties, I don't think I will ever come back here and personally wouldn't recommend it to my friends.",2,2018,06,17

44,Outstanding,"Fantastic property with a great location in Barcelona. There’s no surprise wherever we go, Mandarin Oriental will give us the best service. Superb dinner at Moments, many thanks to Filipe, for his attention to the detail and kindness, he definitely adds value to that place. The focus on the Spanish wines and the way that the sommelier presents it is to be proud off. Another place to go is the bankers bar, great evening with really good and friendly staff.",5,2018,06,07
44,Not worth the money,"the lobby is unimpressive and confined.  we had a suite and it was very small considering what we paid.  the view was that of tenements.  don't think you are viewing a zen garden.  you can look down and see some trees - that's it. the breakfast on the lower floor was great, though.  lot's of choices and service was great.  luckily it was included in our room as it was over $100 for 2 buffets.   i would probably stay at the Ritz again next time,  although the Mandarin did have a great location.",3,2018,06,07
44,In love with this place,"I am very impressed with the hotel as a whole from its design, to its location and the staff. The rooms were impeccable but most importantly the service was beyond amazing. The whole staff was very attentive and careful in accommodating us and the concierge was very helpful in recommending places where we could dine and go out. Also the rooftop pool bar serves well crafted drinks and good sushi.",5,2018,06,04
44,"Sophisticated, Stylish and Warm Hotel in Heart of Barcelona","We arrived in Barcelona a few days prior to embarking on a 14-day cruise in the Mediterranean.  While having stayed at Mandarin Hotels in Asia and the US, this was the first time staying at their European properties.  The Barcelona property clearly continues the fine tradition of all of the others.

We had an exceptional suite on the quiet back side of the hotel, away from the noise of the Passeig de Gracia, with a balcony overlooking the gardens.  The space was well-appointed, with fresh fruit and a welcome bottle of wine.  The staff saw to our every request, including keeping the minibar overstocked with Nespresso coffee pods to accommodate our coffee 'habit'.

But beyond the accommodations, the Concierge staff was absolutely TOP NOTCH.  Their consistent recommendations for dinners, drinks and other things for us to do were excellent, though the casual dining area, where we had breakfast each day, was equally tasty.

The spa staff was incredibly accommodative, and my partner's deep tissue massage was just what was needed a day after the long flight from the West Coast of the US.
 
One treat that we enjoyed several evenings while there was the pop-up NYC bar Employees Only, which took over the lobby bar.  The bar was converted into a speakeasy with generous libations and tasty treats.  The mixologists and staff flew over from the New York outpost, and we befriended the manager and head mixologist.

I know that we will return to the hotel again, as the entire staff made us feel at home during our entire stay!",5,2018,06,01
44,A rare quality.,"An absolute pleasure to stay here as always. Exceptional and friendly service from the staff with quality rooms. Very welcoming on arrival, the room was ready early and the suite was exceptional with a large balcony. Mandarin Barcelona, you should be proud of yourselves!",5,2018,06,01
44,Not even close to a luxury hotel,"I have always been a huge fan of the Mandarin Oriental brand and have spent many trips at their beautiful and luxurious properties all over the world. I recently spent a long weekend at the Barcelona property- the staff there were very nice but the hotel experience could not have been more disappointing. It was a very busy weekend in town so my room was not the room category I would have normally booked. However even for a standard room, it was absurdly small and was so dark with tiny windows it was depressing. The hotel gym did not have an attendant so you have to go to the spa to request a key for access. When I asked the concierge for a dinner reservation they were dismissive and I was told there wasn’t anything available, which surprised me. Additionally, I twice asked to have my room turned down and it was forgotten. I understand room prices and availability shift based on demand but nothing about my experience at this property felt like a luxury hotel. 

I love writing positive review because I know how difficult it can be to run a luxury hotel but unfortunately this property was no where close.",1,2018,05,31
44,Exceeding expectations!,"First of all, what an unforgettable hotel and especially what a professional and service Orientated staff. The arrival too the hotel was very smooth, and was greeted with a lovely tea and a big smile from Carla and Gustavo in the reception. 
Unfortunately, we had requested an early check in after lunch and this request was accepted but when we arrived the room was not ready until 3:40...

Too show their apologize we were brought some Luxemburgerlis, and the following day a cake a bottle Cava for my fathers 50th birthday, aswell presented by Gustavo from the reception. 

The terrace/rooftop was excellent for relaxing and enjoying a nice selection of sushi and beverages, and again staff was excellent, especially the two trainees were extremely professional and had very high knowledge of the hotel as well as the menus. 

For the evening of my fathers 50th birthday, we had emailed the concierge prior too our arrival and they had recommended a tapas bar called bar canete, which having read about, seemed too be the top choice for tapas in Barcelona. Too summarize, this resturant was a complete disaster, with terrible service, arrogant staff, extremely overpriced food. 

The next morning we told Franco and Daniel from the concierge that my dads birthday evening did not go very well and how disappointed we were in the restaurant. This is where Franco completely exceeded our expectations, he took our complaint very seriously, listened too our thoughts and immediately apologized that we had this unfortunate experience despite being rated a top restaurant in Barcelona. He even went so far that he said he would Personally go too this restaurant and talk with the manager. In the afternoon when we were departing he personally escorted us out too taxi, giving his card and saying if there is anything else he can do too make our next stay excellent.

Having stayed in countless of 5 star Hotels around the globe, studying in Ecole Hotelier de Lausanne, I have never met such a professional staff and especially how Franco acted and reacted too our complaint. This is hospitality at its absolute finest and best. I created TripAdvisor purely too write this review. 

Thank you too Carla, Gustavo, Daniel and especially Franco for creating a great stay for my fathers 50th birthday.",5,2018,05,30
44,Incredible hotel with comprehensive service,Beautiful room with lots of space and multiple balconies. This suite had all that was needed for a luxurious and enjoyable stay. The location was great for shopping although a 30 minute walk to get down to the harbour. The fully comprehensive service was great with delicious food and a great pool.,5,2018,05,27
44,Barcelona,A truly beautiful hotel in a great location. The staff in every area of the hotel are wonderfully helpful and pleasant. Check-in and check-out happen with great expediency and efficiency. The rooms are tastefully furnished and good internet speeds. We would always stay here.,5,2018,05,25
44," World class service as usual!","A newcomer to the elite group of hotels, this MO is different in style but offers the signature premium service found in other properties worldwide. We didn’t think much of the restaurants, but what they lacked, the staff made up for in personalized care of guests.  From Housekeeping to the Concierge staff, there is competence and professionalism everywhere. And let’s not forget the fantastic Doormen and Bell Staff! We would certainly visit here again!",5,2018,05,21
44,Awesome Service,"Stayed here for a nice long weekend getaway. The rooms were small but perfectly appointed as you would expect from the Mandarin. What really blew us away though was the service from the concierge when it came to restaurant recommendations, places to see and things to do. The pool on the rooftop though was a bit smaller than I thought it would be with only 8 sun lounges and some tables. ",5,2018,05,13
44,Outstanding Experience,"This property takes the concept of service and brings it to another level.  When you are visiting a city as charming as Barcelona and continue to talk about the hotel where you stayed, you know they did an excellent job.  The property itself is in an ideal location on Passeig de Gracia.  It is located in an old bank building (great art deco style entry) and their bar (Banker's Bar) is decorated with old safety deposit boxes.  It's Blanc restaurant, with it high ceiling, is a charming location for both breakfast and lunch--as the light pours in.  There are rooms that look out on to Passeig de Gracia--an example being the mini suite room #301.  We had a larger suite, #321, and it was ideal--large main full bathroom, walk-in closet, with a full-sized living room and dining room---also an additional 1/2 bath.  There is a decent-sized workout room and an indoor pool.  The concierge, butler service and front disk were exceptional.  It was a delightful experience and we are anxious to go back.",5,2018,05,12
44,Superb,"This hotel is as good as it gets. The location is ideal but it's so much more than that. The MO creates a feeling of wellbeing, of subtle attention to detail, of quality that touches on everything you encounter. From the service, to the food, to the ambience, it hits all the right notes.  I'm definitely a fan....",5,2018,05,09
44,Great place,"In the very center. Beautiful. Rooms are a little bit tired but service is very good. 
Excellenet bar on the roof (9th floor). SPA is perferct as always at Mandarin Oriental chain hotel. Breakfast is delicious.",5,2018,05,07
44,Catalan Luxury!,"My husband and I recently spent three nights at the Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona:  And were treated in a style that can only be called:  Catalan Luxury!  When entering this Mandarin Oriental property, we immediately noticed their world famous attention to detail and customer service by every staff member.  Despite arriving at 9:30 AM, from a cruise ship;  We were notified that our Mandarin room would be ready in ""10 minutes for check-on"".  We were provided a relaxing spot to wait in their ""Special Pop-up bar"" which has a hidden entrance and large couches with beverages and food to enjoy.  At check-in we were welcomed by ""Irene"" who spent time explaining aspects of the hotel, with a special  warm, charming attitude!  The room was luxurious and spacious: with the only downside being the outside view of apartments(But that did not diminish any aspect of our stay).
The breakfast buffet(or ala carte) was a gourmet offering of local products and specialities(Churros and chocolate!).  Great job Mandarin Oriental!  We will return!",5,2018,04,29
44,Barcelona Birthday,"very poor bathroom design  for a suite. unusable bathtub and only one sink. shower door did not close properly allowing water onto the bathroom floor

44,MO Barcelona sets new heights in their rooms and service.  Amazing stay for our family!,"The words Mandarin Oriental are synonymous with luxury and pampering. Well, during our stay, they took that to another level. Our family was fortunate enough to spend 6 glorious nights at the MO Barcelona and we could not have asked for anything better. As if the entire hotel staff were clairvoyant, they met our family's needs before us having to ask for it. We arrived early in the morning and our room was ready. Ready with a welcome snack for the kids and fruit and a very nice bottle of Spanish wine. But before even setting foot into the room, they had upgraded us to the junior suite which was just incredible. During our stay, which ran through Easter, the staff made our stay feel like home and we were spoiled rotten. Our butler took care of our every need while the concierge and the dining team did all their best to keep us well fed and our kids entertained. The kids play lounge next to the dining room was just perfect. The food at the Michellin starred restaurants onsite was a pleasant surprise. The daily breakfasts were amazing as was the Easter Sunday brunch. More importantly for our kids, the Easter egg hunt organized by the staff for the kids were just so thoughtful and demonstrative of the level of detail the MO puts into its product and service. Aside from everything inside the hotel being perfect, the location of the hotel is, well, again perfect. Just a block south of the Gaudi house on the main thoroughfare, you cannot go wrong with the convenience of being able to walk everywhere.  Lastly, the brand new rooftop patio with the dipping pool is ideal for when the weather warms up. If the weather isn't nice and warm, you can always take a lap in the gym downstairs and relax in the sauna.  Anyways, I can go on and on about our stay. By far one of the, if not the best, stay in all of our family's travels around the world! Thank you MO Barcelona for everything!!!",5,2018,04,24
44,A Reminder,"I stayed at the MO Barcelona for three days before attending a cruise. Just checked-out 2 days ago. Everything was excellent during my stay from the transfer service, the room to the restaurants. However, now on the cruise ship I just received a mail from the hotel reception informing that they had charged additional 131 euros on me for consuming the products from the mini bar which I actually didn't. To be honest, the price of 131 euros isn't really not that high in comparison with their room price. This may be a rare incidence, but being a frequent traveler, it is one that I have never encountered before. In fact, my good mood on the ship today has been partially affected by them. Whatever the outcome will be after my reply to the reception, a reminder to the guests of MO Barcelona: be sure to confirm that your mini bar account is correct when checking out.",3,2018,04,23
44,Amazing weekend!,"Thank you so much Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona for such a lovely stay. Beautiful hotel, amazing room and delicious food. Everyone is so friendly and helpful! We couldn’t have had a nicer weekend and cannot wait to visit again. ",5,2018,04,14
44,"""Luxurious Escape""","What a lovely stay at MO Barcelona! 
Super luxury room and its amenities, the wide range of buffet breakfast, let alone its wonderful location. Few minutes walk to  tourist attractions, shopping stores, and the metro station is extremely close at hand. But what really impressed me were their fantastic hotel staff from each corner of the hotel. They were trying their best to anticipate your every need without having to ask. By the way, I’m also appreciated the concierge helped us to get the tickets to The TICKET Bar.   For every one of them, no effort is too much.  That's why I am SO glad to be parts of the fans of M.O.Barcelona because they are always going the extra miles to make you feel at home.  P.S. It would be perfect to get additional amenities in the indoor pool",5,2018,04,11
44,"Great hotel, great location great service","My wife and I stayed in the hotel last week for a whole week. The hotel has a great design and located on the number one street in Barcelona  Passeig de Gràcia. We stayed in a junior suite facing the street. The suite is beautiful and very well designed. We were extremely impressed by the friendliness of the staff and high level of service of all departments, reception, concierge house keeping and most of all the in-room dining staff. No doubt we'll come back!",5,2018,04,10
44,Magnificent,"From the moment the doorman opens your car/cab door to the moment you leave you feel special.  Every member of staff treats you like family, Royal Family.  The location and property are terrific, but the people are magnificent.  From the GM to the doormen, everyone works very hard to ensure your stay is nothing short of perfect.

Get a room overlooking the garden if possible.  No room is bad.  Butlers are available to help and the concierge will make any arrangements you might want.  Thank you Jorge for a wonderful MOHG experience.",5,2018,04,03
44,Best Easter Brunch ever,"We choose Blanc, the whole day dining at Mandarin for a Brunch in family and we did not regret a minute.
Their concept is great, you choose local food from the buffet and they pass at your tables with small dishes from around the world, mainly Asian, every 5-10 minutes.
It's actually a great concept coupled with a fantastic service and the food is awesome 
Clearly the best brunch in town.
Price wise, with €59 at a Mandarin! And if you have a sweet tooth, best home made pastry in town.
You can't beat it!
Will definitely return and can only recommend it to anyone.",5,2018,04,02
44,Perfect,"We stayed after having to move hotel due to lack of air conditioning. Everything works, service is great, staff are knowledgeable. Would definitely stay again. I wish they had a bath tub in the room - the only negative .",5,2018,03,26
44,Exceptional!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 4 night stay at the Mandarin. From the warm greeting on arrival until our departure, the staff and service were exceptional. Our room was large, clean and bright with a comfortable bed, lovely linens and good storage space. The maid service was special-when we were late going for dinner they still came and did turn down service. Breakfasts were excellent with many hot and cold choices. The restaurant staff were personable and efficient. The concierge gave us excellent advice regarding nearby restaurants that we enjoyed. The hotel is well located with excellent shops, restaurants, a Gaudi house and other historic sites within easy walking distance.",5,2018,03,24
44,Luxurious!,"We recently stayed at the Mandarin Oriental right after arriving in Spain from the US. We arrived in the morning and they were very nice to get us a room early so that we could take a quick nap before starting our day. All the staff are helpful and gracious. Breakfast is expansive and fresh. The rooms are dark and QUIET!! The doors are so well constructed with ""slow close"" mechanisms that you never hear noise from the hall. And the location was great... near shopping, dining and subway!",5,2018,03,20
44,Expected honesty and better service,"I booked a terrace suite for three days, and wrote this to the hotel ""- We would like to have a suite with terrace on the south side, we hope to get some sun."" What we got was a terrace suite on 1st floor, and there are no sun on the terrace suites as far as we could see. With a bit of honesty they could have mentioned this when we booked, but they did not. We arrived early (the hotel knew), but no room was available when we arrived. Not even on check in time at 1500 was there a room available. At 16:30 we got the room finally (the offer lunch for us as a compensation). Both examples are really bad service when you pay this kind of money for a hotel room.",2,2018,03,13
44,Mandarin Oriental. Heaven on earth 🌏,"Well, i mean what do you expect from the Mandarin Oriental? they are always nice, atleast at all the locations I have stayed. A magical place. The rooms are clean and luxurious, the service is outstanding. The location is breathtaking. I just returned and i hoping for a five star resort with five star service and i got it!",5,2018,03,11
44,Beautiful Hotel,The hotel is located at a major shopping street. Has a lovely roof bar/restaurant/pool. The rooms have a huge bathtube. The staff is attentive and nice. The breakfast was good but could have more healthy options.,4,2018,03,11
44,Wedding Venue,We were guests here at a wedding.  Great location on the Paseig de Gracia. Beautiful wedding venue. The hotel is beautiful with a rooftop terrace.  Needless to say to food  and the service was excellent.,5,2018,03,11
44,World class hotel and staff!!,"Recently was in Barcelona for business and stayed at the Mandarin Oriental. An exceptional property, well maintained and well located in the center of the city. All aspects of our stay was exceptional, I believe the staff made a huge difference, you could tell that they were happy to be a part of this brand and their behavior towards us reflected that clearly. Everyone from the bell hops, front desk, concierge, house keeping and room service staff went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. Highly recommend this property!",5,2018,03,09
44,What a beautiful Hotel.,"We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona for one night, the hotel is amazing and the services is nothing less.
Elena from front desk she took care of us and she provided an amazing experience that we will never forget!
The size of the room are prefect with some fantastic interior design pieces.
Unfortunately we couldn't try the Bar and the Michelin Restaurant, we definitely need to go back few more times... 
Thanks for your unbeatable hospitality Mandarin Oriental Barcelona!",5,2018,03,06
44,One of the finest hotels in the world,"This is my second stay at the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona. I travel all of the world and have stayed at some of the world's top rated hotels.  At each of these properties I enjoy an exceptional experience.  But I can honestly say the the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona exceeds all expectations and provides a level of service, quality, and comfort in the luxury hotel category that is above and beyond what I experience in other luxury hotels.  The staff is consistently attentive, polite, and goes out of its way to provide a quality of service that is unparalleled.  The rooms are beautifully appointed and extremely comfortable.  Hotel restaurants are top notch, and for a pre or after dinner drink, the Bankers Bar is amazing.  In the two times that I have stayed at this hotel, I have been made to feel as if I am highly valued, warmly welcomed, and deeply appreciated.  I have become and will remain a loyal customer.  And I also believe that the Barcelona property is the best in the Mandarin Oriental portfolio.  Thank you to the staff for once again making my stay a truly exceptional experience.",5,2018,03,05
44,simply the best in every way,"Celebratory trip with parents and nothing was too much trouble for all the staff in this hotel who went out of their way to ensure we were all comfortable and looked after.  Concierge staff were outstanding at assisting with all travel, attraction bookings and finding restaurants that were suitable.  All meals we had in the hotel were excellent with staff remembering preferences from our first visit.  Rooms were comfortable and spotlessly cleaned every day.  The late check out and  use of spa facilities to prepare for late return flight to the UK were much appreciated.  The best hotel in Barcelona and a wonderful location for all that the city has to offer.",5,2018,02,23
44,"Phenomenal service, decent digs","My husband and I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona for four nights this past week. Originally, we had planned to stay for six nights; however, I came down with the stomach virus during our stay, and we decided to leave early to get home.

Hotel pros: 

-Unbelievable service. We arrived before check-in and before our room was ready, so the hotel offered us complimentary breakfast at their restaurant Blanc while we waited. Upon learning that we planned to leave early, the front desk only charged us for the nights we stayed and didn't charge us a penalty. They were extremely concerned that I had gotten sick from something I'd eaten at the hotel, but we assured them this wasn't the case. The restaurant staff allowed me to order off-menu items for room service as well as during meals with my husband at Blanc (bananas, dry white toast, plain jasmine rice). Everyone who works at the hotel is absolutely lovely. 

-Delicious food and drinks. My husband raved about his old fashioneds from Banker's Bar, which is the hotel's bar. The hotel itself is in an old bank, so the bar has repurposed safety deposit boxes as decorations. Very swanky. The food at Blanc is also delicious. Highlights include the ox-tail burger, jamon tapas, jet-lag soup, and trolley cart desserts.

-Room service. They have both daily housekeeping and turn-down service, both of which are unobtrusively and thoroughly done. The hotel rooms are set up with lights so you can indicate your preference: red for ""do not disturb"" while green is for ""please come make up the room.""

-Location. We love to explore cities by walking, and the Mandarin is well-situated. 20 minutes to La Sagrada Familia, the Gothic Quarter, and El Born.

 
My only quibbles...

-Room layout. As others have noted in their reviews, the rooms are fairly small. We stayed in a Mandarin room, and the layout didn't maximize space. While it's fine as a place to go back and sleep, I nearly went stir crazy being cooped up all day in such a small space while sick. With that said, the patio we had was a nice touch.

-Smell. The hotel scent in the hallways and lobby can be oppressive. (Yes, I realize how ridiculous that sounds.)",4,2018,02,23

44,HS,"Every aspect of this hotel is mediocre. The lobby is shabby,the hallways with the glass partitions look like a prison. Nothing about this hotel smacks of luxury except for the price. My room was very small and narrow decorated in IKEA style furniture that was chipped. The bathroom was dark and dreary with nary a light, no soap holder. Instead they had a Parsons table for soap etc. Not a single electric outlet could hold a converter. and the icing on the cake no pun intended was the fact that there were 4 cookies uncovered left in my room on day one and remained there for 4 days. Highly unsanitary i will say. To sum this up i will say that any reviewers who gave this 5 Star have never stayed in a 5 Star hotel or have very low standards.",2,2018,02,01
44,Amy B,"It was a girls birthday trip for three lifelong friends. Barcelona is the chosen city. Dreams of shopping, art and pure luxury dancing in our minds.
What an awakening upon checking into our hotel.
Our rooms were not ready and we were offered breakfast. Of course, there was a 40 Euro charge, which included no bananas, no chef station, powdered eggs and awful coffee/expresso/cappuccino.
When we were finally ushered into our deluxe, garden room at a questionable rate of over 500Euro per night, it was neither garden view nor deluxe. But rather, dirty, dark and as far away from 5 star as you can get. To be specific, the area rug was dirty, mold crept around the bottom of the shower and lighting was minimal. The windows had an interesting bar effect, which I quickly realized was protection from intruders from the tenement housing backing up to the hotel.
Public hallways were dirty, especially the carpets.
The Blanc restaurant was closed for renovations.
The lobby was uninviting and uncomfortable.
The concierge was constantly on the phone and had absolutely no knowledge of Barcelona.
There were no brochures, Time Out or anything in the hotel or room enticing us to see Barcelona.
The bar area was unremarkable and the bartender did not know how to make Sangria! Oh but I forgot, “Barcelona is not Spain!” as was told to us over and over again by hotel employees.
To make matters worse, a child was running loudly around the bar and knocking into our chairs at midnight while his parents sat by and did nothing. We questioned the staff and they said there was nothing they could do! Our conclusion was that CHILD SERVICES does not exist in Barcelona!
The doormen posted in front of the hotel reverted to their cell phones when we asked for directions to El National, a half block from the hotel.
A hotel of this caliber was staffed with “children” who did not make it through “hotel 101.”
I would NOT RECOMMEND this hotel to anyone.
Our disappointment in every aspect of this hotel was overwhelming.
",1,2018,02,01
44,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona trip,Three of us decided to stay at the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona to celebrate a special birthday. The hotel was very pricey and fell below our expectations. The rooms at roughly 500 a night were sub-par and badly in need of renovation. They faced what looked like tenements with clothes hanging from clotheslines. There was no literature in the room for tourists as to what high spots of Barcelona to take in. Some of the staff seemed inexperienced as if they had just been hired. The bar which was quite nice had children running around as late as 11:30 in the evening. When we arrived at the hotel we expected what is typical of the chain but our stay at the hotel was very disappointing. Certainly did not justify the highly priced poor accommodations,2,2018,01,29
44,Our second home,"We are in love with this hotel located right on the luxury shopping street Passeig de Gracia. We even bought the signature Mandarin scent for our home. Its available in the Spa. They have rooms both with the courtyard and street view. The rooms facing the garden have a bigger terrace. 
if you are a couple try their bath treatments. The ''romantic'' comes with roses petal for the bathtub, a bottle of cava and some chocolate. Also the pillow selection is really great, you can request even a pregnancy pill to support your belly. 
Moreover, we quite often actually visit the spa for massages.",5,2018,01,25
44,About as perfect as you can get,"In the past I have been frequently criticized on this site for my reviews being too critical. It is always with an eye for detail that I review hotels. Some hotels you wonder why the bother, others remind you why it is worth paying the extra. The Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona reminds me of the Hong Kong property. By that I mean the proper one, not the bling one in the Landmark. You can't find a single fault or flaw in food, rooms,service, or location. Nothing else to add. Congratulations to the team running the hotel, and whatever you pay the team on concierge you should double it.",5,2018,01,24
44,A gem in the heart of Barcelona,"We stayed 3 days in a Mandarin room and the service was exemplary... We really much enjoy the stay, from the extreme confort in the room to the delicious breakfast with a selection of Spanish specialities. A big thank you to André, Miriam, Luis and the concierge team : David, Sebastian, Manuel who were very helpful and knowledgable. Hopefully we will be back soon !",5,2018,01,23
44,Great Two days,This hotel was excellent. The staff was fabulous and very attentive to our needs. We especially enjoyed the rooftop bar and the food was excellent.The location of the hotel is close to all the attractions. We felt very safe walking around.,5,2018,01,22
44,Mr. Kim Degerth,"This review is really simple and basic: 

If you want the absolute, very best hotel in Barcelona, and you don’t need to think about your bank account balance, then Mandarin Oriental is for you:) 

Forget about one letter hotels by the beach, Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is simply the best hotel in the whole of Spain. 

I have enjoyed pleasant nights at fine hotels, but this one is in a league of its own:) 
Simply the best.

44,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona - A unique experience ,"Sometimes first impressions are the ones we hold at heart, and the feeling I got from the plane window looking down on this colorful city set the stage for what I was about to experience. 
 
ENTRANCE OF HOTEL
Upon exiting the customs hall in El Prat Airport, I see the all so welcoming MO driver from which I received the most gracious welcome. First comment the driver makes ""did you have a good flight sir, is there anything you need assistance with before departing the airport.""(*UT)
 
That set the mood for a warm, sincere conversation during the journey to property. (*UT)
 
Reaching the hotel, we are greeted by three staff members one being the butler waiting to welcome me to the hotel.(*UT) 
 
The Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is a unique boutique hotel in the heart of the city with an unconstrained, artistic tastefully appointed lobby. The lobby and street are integrated by a raised glass walkway that resembles a classic fashion show runway. (*UT) Wherever you look, there is a feeling of opulence and luxury in every corner of this hotel that gracefully extends to all the venues.  
 
When passing the concierge desk, I receive a warm greeting from the whole team, and Franco, who I corresponded with prior to my arrival. (*UT) As we approach the elevator, I am greeted by Monica Homedes, the hotel Director of Communications who, while off duty and on her way home, graciously welcomed me to Barcelona and the hotel.(*UT).
 
With such a gracious wholehearted welcome from the team, how can you not be made to feel at home and unique!!
 
Checking-in was swift effortless and in the privacy of my room.(*UT)
The room is luxuriously appointed, and has all the latest technology, a beautiful sitting area, an outdoor terrace, and a spa-like bathroom! (*UT) The bathroom had a vast amount of Acqua Di Parma toiletries, which is something I absolutely LOVE! (*UT). 
 
 
Within minutes, the doorbell rings and in comes butler Jaime with a bottle of Cava as a welcome gift! In addition to the bottle, Jaime wields a Chocolate Mousse Cake with Raspberries Filling and Chocolate Ganache. (*UT) It was so amazingly delicious, I can still taste it on my palate!
 
MOMENTS RESTARAUNT 
Since my flight had arrived early evening and the onset of jetlag was being felt, I decided to go for a stroll near the hotel. Once returning and now approaching ten in the evening, I asked Franco if the Michelle stared restaurant “MOMENTS” was still accepting guests. Before I could even finish my sentence, Franco walked me to the restaurant and introduced me to the maître di, where I was welcomed and seated immediately. (*UT) 
 
You do need to understand this is a top-notch Catalan dining experience that consists of a 13-course wine pairing ""Ecosystem"" tasting menu. (*UT) This means it's a three-hour well-choreographed dining journey that would last past midnight. 
 
After my eyes and palate experienced the art, colors, and tastes of the talented kitchen staff, I disembarked from “MOMENTS” knowing It was the best adventure my appetite had ever experienced. My sincere gratitude to the whole staff at Moments Restaurant, who went beyond the call of duty to accommodate one guest with all graciousness and smiles. (*UT) 
 
 
EXPLORE THE CITY
The next two days I explored the city and absorbed as much as one can for such a short journey. 
 
On my third day, I had requested a private guided tour, but did not want to experience the city like a tourist. I wanted to experience the authentic, raw, and unfiltered Barcelona, just as a local would! Once again, I was reassured by the concierge team that they had the perfect guide in mind. 
 
To my surprise, Tanja was EXCEPTIONAL(*UT). Tanja asked the right questions and made me feel as if we were two friends on a weekend stroll. Not only did we discuss the history, monuments, and attractions of Barcelona, but also the real facts of day to day life. We went to all the right places, I was never overly informed, but most importantly, nothing seemed choreographed.(*UT)
 
On one of the evenings, I was discussing with the concierge team about Catalan cuisine and how I wanted to try something that is produced locally.   
 
The next day the doorbell rings again, and I see butler Klementyna and Jaime rolling in a tray with Catalan Cheese, locally raised and cured meats, and a bottle of Catalan Wine. (*UT)Klementya had overheard me in passing talking to the concierge team the other day and decided to surprise me! (*UT). 
 
MANDARIN SPA
Now on to the world respected Mandarin Spa.
 
The Mandarin Spa is a serene environment in the heart of a busy city.
The receptionist offered me hot or cold tea, a scented damp warm face cloth, and a change of shoes to slippers(*UT). I was escorted to the changing rooms where, after a quick shower and a session in the luxurious steam room, I was introduced to my therapist, Ricardo. 
Ricardo is an amazing therapist who is all about holistic healing. He is also a great personal trainer whose primary focus is your well-being. He believes everyone’s body is unique and does not have a cookie cutter approach to your training or massage session. (*UT) His thought process is clear: ""treat your body well, and it will give you satisfaction for many years to come."" Since this was a short trip, unfortunately, I was only able to spend a few hours at the spa for a 90-minute session, but I did enjoy the indoor pool, gym and spa facilities daily.
 
 
On one of the mornings when I decided to enjoy an ""early"" breakfast. (as it was difficult getting out of bed early because the room was tranquil and the beds were so comfortable) Breakfast was served at ""BLANC"", and I had the unexpected pleasure of meeting the mastermind behind this jewel property, General Manager Mr.Jorge Monje.(*UT)   
 
Jorge's background as I came to find out is from South Asia. We shared many stories of our travels, and with that opportunity, I wanted to express my joy and experience at The Mandarin. I said, ""Jorge, I have only experienced this type of sincere wholehearted hospitality from Asian hotels, and your staff surpassed many.""
With a kind smile on his face, Jorge responds "" it gives me great pride and honor to hear such great compliments from guests, as we strive to do our best and each of us have a common goal."" My response was, ""well you have all succeeded and delivered the best experience to date from any European hotel I've stayed in.""
 
That evening I paid a visit to the Bankers Bar, indeed the most beautiful bar in Barcelona. It holds such a seductive atmosphere full of class, luxury, and a knowledgeable mixologist. (*UT)
 
On the morning of departure, while admiring the view from the entrance of the hotel, I see Jorge walking down the glass bridge to personally wish me a farewell and to thank me for visiting Barcelona and the hotel. (*UT)
 
Upon heading to the limo for transfer to airport, I am greeted by butler Klementyna to wish me an excellent continuation of my journey and if there were any last minute details that I needed help with before departing the hotel. (*UT)
 
As for the drive back to the airport, while discussing with the driver on what I experienced during my visit, I told him that I wanted to explore the waterfront area of Barcelona, but had no time. To my amazement, he drove me to the waterfront/port. (*UT) I was able to go for a short walk and take a few photos. At that point, I promised myself to return for New Year's Eve as I most definitely need to explore more of this exciting city, culture and The Mandarin Oriental while at the same time saying hello again to a new friend Jorge.
 
I have to say this is one of my favorite MO Hotels. It is elegant, fresh, and full of energy! Staff included!
 
Goodbyes are never easy unless you reply with; ""see you soon.”

 
 New Years Eve - MO Barcelona
 
 As I have always said, ""Goodbyes are never easy unless you reply with, see you soon."" And so, begins the journey back to Barcelona as promised for the holidays.
This city has so much to see and do that a third trip back is a must. As expected, we received the warmest & most sincere welcome back from the whole team of the Mandarin Oriental. (*UT)
 
We were escorted directly to our suite with Klementyna (our butler) where the check-in formalities were quickly processed. Upon entering the room, I noticed a few of my personal photos that were placed around the room, and I said to Klementyna "" those are photos of me,"" Klementyna politely responds,"" Mr. Geragonis, we wanted to make you feel at home, so we placed a few of your photos around the room. (*UT) That is something that, to date, I have never experienced.
 
Every day we had a surprise of sweets waiting in our suite, but on one occasion there were these small treats that were white and had the shape of an oversized almond which I just loved(*UT). In the past, I mentioned to Klementyna that I so enjoyed those sweets. Well, within a few hours, a bowl of those was in the room! (*UT)
 
After a restful sleep, the next morning I had the pleasure of sitting down with my friend and GM of the property Mr. Jorge Monje. The staff remembered my coffee, breakfast, and seating preference. (*UT)
 
With thoughtful recommendations from the talented concierge team, we set out to explore Barcelona -The Montserrat monastery and the fantastic 3 countries in one day tour(Baga', Andora, Aux-Les-Thermes) (*UT) in the outskirts of the city which were not explored during my visit in October.  
That evening we journeyed out for a late dinner to one of my favorite restaurants in Barcelona "" Bar Canete""(will post a separate review). This place is a show stopper, and a must experience for all foodies.
 
On the evening of the 31st, we were surprised with my favorite MO cake and a bottle of Cava to start the evening festivities and celebration.(*UT) Prior to our arrival, we had selected to experience New Year's Eve with our friends at the elegant hotel restaurant ""BLANC."" The theme for the evening was Gatsby; the restaurant was transformed so elegantly to that era with live music, great decorations, and models which were hired exclusively to add real ambiance (*UT). The menu for the evening was presented with wine pairing that lasted until past midnight -it was a journey for your palate that will most definitely be remembered throughout 2018.(*UT)
 
Unfortunately, another journey has come to an end.
I started off the new year with such a grand adventure that I will compare all others going forward with this experience. The MO Barcelona is an exceptionally orchestrated property throughout- most importantly they are genuine and sincere.
 
Jorge and Andre' you are both a fantastic duo that lead a tremendously talented team.      
 
I wish you again a healthy, happy, and prosperous new year- Cheers!",5,2018,01,10
44,Exceptional ,"Would give this hotel 6 stars if I could. Fantastic position, outstanding hospitality and attention to personal detail from check-in to check-out. Rooms were very comfortable and quiet. Cleanliness and aroma (amber-musk in air conditioning units) excellent. Lovely and spacious areas inside hotel. Impossible to fault.",5,2018,01,09
44,Very best Hotel in Barcelona ,This is the very best hotel in Barcelona. Excellent staff. Great rooms. Good food. Great modern location right in the heart of the city. Great place for shopping and sightseeing. We will definitely come back. ,5,2018,01,07
44,Perfection,"We had travel 8 countries in last couple of months, different cities different locations but Barcelona already got the first place in our top list because of Mandarin Oriental Barcelona. 

It was a perfect stay and they pampered us with personalized service. From reservation stage to the end, it was perfect, it was memorable. 

Special thanks to Mayte, Javier, Butler Team, Concierge, Guest Service, Housekeeping and Bellteam. We felt like we are at home thanks to you, thank you for all. 

Great hospitality, great management and great staff, thank you for all...",5,2017,12,29
44,Excellent stay,"Been at many Mandarin Orientals, and we were curious to discover MO Barcelona. Very modern, refreshingly so, yet with MO hallmarks. Luxurious, welcoming, friendly, and accommodating. Excellent - would happily return.",5,2017,12,27
44,Exemplary service,"Pre check in: I was flying to Greece and I went to the hotel to see if I could leave my luggage for a week. They took it with no hesitation. It was so pleasant I had dinner there. 
Restaurant: AMAZING. Amazing service, amazing food. Just....amazing

Check in: Upon my return the hotel bell person remembered me and my bag. I didnt even give my ticket. I go upstairs to check in and they greet me with my name. How did they know my name?

Bell service: You get in the cab and they mark the cab and your room number in case you leave something in the cab. 

Room: tasteful and spacious. clean. the radio did not work with the new iphone and so they bought me a different radio to plug it in.
House keeping: Spot on. I'm that person that takes all the tolietries so I can get extras. I have no shame. I have a lot of nice bath products for guests in my open (I saw this on Oprah once). 
Laundry service: They laundered my items very nicely. I don't recall the cost but I was also desperate. 
Room service: My ""friend"" and I ordered a bottle of wine. It was brought up promptly at 3AM. 
Bar: Friendly bartender, amazing spicy wasabi snacks and a spot on French 75.
Spa: Decent massage. The staff were a bit cold compared to the rest of the hotel staff so I would pay attention to this. 
Pool: Adequate
Rooftop bar area: Windy but fun if you are into that
Gym: Sorry, I missed this one. 
Breakfast: Delicious breakfast buffet

I stayed here a few months ago but I have not forgotten this hotel. I also stayed with friends at a hostel which was nice for what it was and I stayed at Hotel Arts which was also nice. I've stayed at many hotels and outside of Singita in South Africa this MO in Barcelona stands out. Also I'm AMEX platinum so breakfast was free and I had a discount on my spa appointment.  Hotel is pricey but not over the top when you consider the service and comfort.",5,2017,12,25
44,Can’t think of any other hotel to stay in Barcelona,"Mandarin Oriental is at the heart of Barcelona: on Passeig de Gràcia where Gaudi’s famous Casa Batlló is located. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend The Moments restaurant, which is managed by one of the world famous chefs. What you have on your plate   can be best described as a delicious piece of art.",5,2017,12,25
44,When the people who voted 5 stars went to bed.... the standards of the Mandarin Oriental went down,"I am a bit disappointed with the standards at the Mandarin Oriental. I didn't stay at your hotel this time but wanted to visit your renowned cocktail bar towards the end of my visit in Barcelona. I came over by taxi, but found out that the bar was shut before it should be -  it normally shuts at 3am. The front desk people told me that it was shut at 1:30am due to reasons unknown (laziness?). 

This is a Hong Kong establishment, and I do expect service at an Asian level because I am a fan. When it says on the tin it shuts at 3am, it should at least close its door after that. ",3,2017,12,23
44,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"You have an amazing hotel, I am so in love with it.  The best customer service I’ve ever experienced at a hotel, ever.   Mortse at the front desk is exceptional, she personally gave us a tour of the hotel and introduced the room to us. We had such a great time talking with the concierge, David and Daniel.  Their recommendations were the best.  There was also a new concierge in training that was really nice.  We bought tickets to Park Guell and told him we would pick them up after lunch at Tapas 24, instead (Justin or Patrick, I think his name was) walked over to the restaurant to personally give us the printed out tickets.  I also was impressed with the bellman, we asked for a cab and the bellman ran down the street, got into a cab and rode it back to the hotel for us.  The housekeeping was so great organizing the room with our toiletries in the bathroom.

Two days in Barcelona is not enough, there is so much to see and do.  I cannot wait to come back in a future visit.",5,2017,12,21
44,amazing hotel in downtown barcelona,"Great location for a great hotel in downtown Barcelona
Very convenient for business stay or winter getaway in sunny barcelona
Extremely friendly staff
Rooms are well decorated

44,Personalised luxury,"An absolute pleasure to stay there. The staff are outstanding and an amazing team working togeather to provide the best hotel experience ever.
The butlers are an amazing thing there. They made us feel so well taken care of handling and anticipating all our needs. ",5,2017,12,14
44,city break in barcelona,"My stay here was great due to the high working standards of all staff members in the hotel, they were extremely friendly and helpful with every small question and query. The amenities are second to none in the hotel with a high class spa to help you wind down after a long day out in Barcelona. This was my first time staying in Barcelona which meant that I didn’t know any restaurants or activities to do, however, the staff were great at giving me details about all the nice restaurants nearby and all of the different excursions that I could do while on my visit. They also call to your room the morning of your arranged day out to inform you that the bus will be arriving to the hotel shortly. 
Overall I had a very pleasant stay at the Mandarin Oriental hotel, its location was a key factor to the enjoyment of my stay as I never had to travel far to find my plans for the day. From the hotel design to the hotel restaurant food, my stay was much beyond my expectations and I cannot rate this hotel highly enough.",5,2017,12,05
44,"expensive luxury hotel, but not that impressed","very good location, walking distance to Michelin star restaurants and major sites. my third hotel stay in Barcelona during my trip. small room, but looks nice. very business like service attitude, don't feel the warmness or anything. again, I am out touring the city, so I only go back to sleep.",3,2017,12,01
44,Best Hotel ever!!,Spend couple of nights in this hotel for my honeymoon in deluxe garden room. Everything was perfect in every way. Professional hotel staffs were there whenever I needed help. It was expensive but worth it. I really wish to visit here in the future.,5,2017,11,27
44,City Break in Barcelona,"My Mother and I visited Barcelona for two nights in November and stayed at Mandarin Oriental on Passeig de Gracia. WOW. What an amazing experience - if there wasn't so much to see outside I would have stayed in the hotel the whole time! 

Deluxe rooms are spacious and a little bit of luxury, just perfect for a city break. But the Suites are fantastic and extremely generous for a hotel in the city centre. Very stylish and contemporary decor with the perfect combination of Mandarin Oriental routes and local Spanish style. You won't to move from the rainfall showers and the amazing luxury bath products by Acqua Di Parma!

Breakfast is a MUST in Blanc, lots of staff around to make sure you are always seen to and having good conversation. Excellent selection of continental and cooked breakfast. The space is really light and airy and is a great place to just relax throughout the day just for a coffee or afternoon tea even. Didn't try the Mitchelin Star restaurant Moments but heard lots about it whilst there. Definitely book in there is budget allows as the Chef offers themed tasting menu's that change all the time.

The location of the hotel is perfect for all your shopping and sightseeing needs - the Concierge kindly helped us book the open-top bus tour at no extra cost and the stop was right outside. Beautiful Spa to relax in after a hard day!

Having seen a few other '5 star' properties in the city this is 100% the one to go to. Best Location, Staff and Rooms around. The whole time I was out exploring I couldn't wait to get back into the property - it's a little bit of luxury in one of the busiest cities in Europe - a perfect getaway!",5,2017,11,15
44,"Great Hotel, Fabulous Service, Very Knowledgeable Conceirge","We spent 3 nights at the Mandarin. The room was well appointed, the breakfast plentiful  BUT what blew us away was the personal attention and knowledge of the concierge, Claudio Heldt. Mr. Heldt was helpful before we even arrived making dinner reservations and suggesting daily itineraries. He is the best concierge I have ever worked with as he was immediately able to figure out what I liked and offer up 2-3 suggestions as to places we might want to eat, see or shop. He made a great impression on us and we will be sure to return.",5,2017,11,12
44,uniformly outstanding service compensate for high price.,"rooms very nicely appointed, if a little small. the junior suites are worth the extra money.
service uniformly excellent - at reception, in the restaurant, and especially the outstandingly helpful concierge.
an excellent restaurant.
a very good location too.",4,2017,11,12
44,One of the Best in Europe!,"Excellent service throughout the hotel. From the doorstep, to your room and in the dining areas. Our room was modern, very spacious, elegant design, comfortable and clean. They were extremely helpful with arranging tourist destinations. The Sunday brunch was the best.",5,2017,11,08
44,Luxury in style,"Our room was extremely small to the point of being uncomfortable. Staff was professional and very attentive to our every need. Fantastic location and a top luxury hotel but, as stated before, the room was not worth the expense.",4,2017,11,07
44,brunch ,a great place for a sunday brunch..  relaxed and with great quality food.. solid service.. great value for money when you see the variety of food and the options for drinks - cava and bloody mary au discretion :),4,2017,11,06
44,Recommendable hotel.,"The hotel certainly belongs to the luxury group. Feel the entrance of the staff guest interest. They immediately help you with your luggage. There is no problem at check-in. Rooms clean, beautiful. Service at the highest level. Hotel quiet. I would highly recommend.",4,2017,11,02
44,Nice ,"Nice hotel bang in the middle of the city. Can be noisy as a consequence as it's on a main road, but noise is fine with the windows closed. 

Rooms is spacious, very contemporary design.

Nice breakfast. Rooftop is quiet and nice place to chill in the sun when you're tired of the city.

Gym is basic for this category of hotel and pool area could be a bit nicer with more facilities.

Friendly staff and overall very comfortable stay.",4,2017,11,01
44,A stay I will never forget,"I have stayed here twice now and there is nothing bad to say about this place. The staff are incredibly friendly and you receive an extremely personalised service.They go beyond any other staff I've known to at a hotel. The rooms are modern, best beds I've slept in and the breakfast is a 10/10. As well as a spacious well equipped gym and a lovely spa. The location is perfect and the staff will recommend dinners, nights out and tourist attracts while you stay.

Overall a wonderful and very memorable stay!",5,2017,11,01
44,Fantastic hotel in great location!!,"Stayed here for 5 nights with my husband as part of our 7 week Europe Trip and by far the best hotel we have stayed at.

Staff are exceptional, friendly, make you feel so welcome from check in to check out. Daniel at concierge is fantastic!! He helped us plan our days sight seeing and organised tickets and dinner reservations at great restaurants. Highly recommend you speak to him. Thank you Daniel. 

The hotel is quiet even though its busy. Rooms are lovely. Bathroom is great. They literally provide you with every amenity you can think of and replace anything used or opened which is fantastic. Water pressure in shower is strong which is great. 

Location of the hotel is fantastic. 

Restaurant in hotel called Blanc has delicious food!!

Terrat rooftop dining is fantastic, the lovely ladies are so friendly and welcoming. The mocktails were delicious. Fantastic views and evening vibes to just chill too. Be sure to watch a sunset or two from here...Loved it!! 

Overall, brilliant hotel, thank you for a very memorable stay. We definitely will be back.",5,2017,10,24
44,Wonderful stay at the MANDARIN ORIENTAL BARCELONA,"Extremly personalized service. Everybody knew our name,
Beautiful rooms and nice breakfast. You feel like coming home.
Great Concierge Service. We felt very save although we experienced the demonstration on the day of departure. The staff looked very well after us.
",5,2017,10,23
44,Luxurious hotel in a great location,"We stayed 5 nights in August for combination of conference and vacation.  

The room was modern, bright and comfortable,  Windows are thick and do a great job of blocking out city noise.  Power blackout curtain is fabulous.  The lobby smells great.

Plusses:  Location on the Passeig de Gracia - very central and walkable to the Gothic Quarter, great shopping, museums.  Service is excellent.  Rooftop bar, though the ""dipping pool"" is not much of a pool.  The indoor was nice and private, with a great steam room.  Spa is very good.  

Minuses: Very minor criticism - the breakfast buffet has zero variety and the a la carte menu is small.",5,2017,10,22
44,A genuine luxury hotel at Passeing de Gracia,"Stayed in this cosy and full of charming characters hotel for three nights that we truly enjoyed. The appearance of the hotel inside and out couldn't be called ornate, but when walked in everything makes you feel comfortable and relaxed in term of visual and sensate aspects, the signature spa aromatic smelling of MO leads into a calmness and a touch of oriental mystery. Our room was a classic one on the front hotel overlooking the busy and bustle Passeing de Gracia which is a bit of on the smallish side but was not that bad considering the general room size of the hotels in Europ. The bathroom is spacious with separated areas of toilet, basin and walk-in shower with the rainfall and handheld spout heads, and their own brand aminities are in good quality we loved them. The breakfast included served at Blanc was gorgeous, a delighted gastronomic fair for what people may want to have at breakfast. An extensive array bakery goods, dairy products, local cheese, vege and fruits, Spanish cold cuts and sausages and plenty hot plates were available out of see-through kitchen, plus many choices of beverage and different coffee and tea makings to wash down the food. Read a few negative reviews regarding the services of the hotel, however, we saw it on the contrary. Any single staff we met at any single place we had been in the hotel like roof top dip pool, spa, breakfast, concierge and reception, also porters even the security personnels at entrance, all of them are nice, polite and willing to help. The entire staffs worked at breakfast were full of energy with fast and attentive service made a pleasant start for you to set off the day. They even took a note in their record for the congee I asked for which was not on the menu to deliver it to our table for two at next day breakfast, we felt we were being treated as at home indeed. The staffs worked at concierge desk are brilliant knew everything of their town, the flamenco show recommended by them was the one of best comparing with the one we've seen in Andalusia. Ms. Nobuko Yamamoto from reception, whom we contacted most is standing out. She is very helpful by giving us a late check-out till 2pm despite the rooms were tight on the day and granted us to use spa facilities till we leave since we had late evening flight departure and insisted to escort us to our picking up car at the end, we really appreciated very much for the kindness from her and were gleeful of being the guests of MOB. What a whole excellent staffs team they are and all of them are the treasures of the hotel. The hotel is located in the middle of Paseo de Gracia where the brand and high end design shops are concentrated along the both sides of the street, and the Placa de Catalunya is less than twenty minutes easy walking away,  the famous La Rambla is just next to it. Want to try out good and delicious tapas, no problem, the very popular tapas bar and restaurant Tapas 24 is right at the corner few minutes walk from the hotel. MOB, a home away home, and yes it is an expensive place to stay, but all you got is what you paid for, which is worth every single penny from your pocket. Will stay again and highly recommended.",5,2017,10,22
44,Absolutely outstanding ,"This is a wonderful hotel in a great location. The staff is fantastic! 

The spa is a real treat. Great services in a relaxing atmosphere.

Morning breakfast was delicious and I loved that the wait staff remembered us from day to day.

The concierge staff was always helpful, kind and accommodating. We were there during the Catalonia independence vote and strikes but the staff did the best they could to meet the changing needs of their guests. You won't be disappointed if you stay here.",5,2017,10,21
44,Outstanding hotel,"My wife and I stayed for four nights October 10 -14. We are fans of the MO Group and were not disappointed. 

We had a Studio Suite on the third floor with garden view. The room was spacious with a good sized terrace which included two comfortable easy chairs. The view from our terrace overlooking the hotel’s Mimosa Garden immediately below is fine as far as it goes but the rear of the hotel forms one side of a square with the other three sides comprising the rears of apartments. These do not particularly impact on the privacy of the hotel guests and in any event there is nothing that the hotel can do about it.

The bed was very large and comfortable, and there is a ‘walk in’ area for hanging clothes and plenty of drawer space with two spaces for suitcases. 

The bathroom is a decent size with plenty of shelf space for toiletries and ‘his and her’ sinks. The walk-in shower is of good size with simple controls. My wife has some mobility problems and she was concerned that there were no grab handles in the shower but it was not an issue as the floor seems to be non-slip. Once the rain shower temperature is set to your preference it stays that way as the excellent and attentive housekeepers leave your settings alone. The room amenities are Acqui di Parma. There is also a good sized bath.

The suites come with a Butler Service which is efficient but not intrusive. The Personal Butlers are always available and for your needs you dial one number to have all of the hotels services immediately available to you through the Personal Butler. In truth we didn’t have to bother the Personal Butlers much but we had good contact with Maria and Araidna who are very knowledgeable and helpful. Our thanks to them.

Housekeeping is efficient, comprehensive and unobtrusive.

The staff throughout the hotel are excellent and friendly and somehow everyone seems to know your name within five minutes of checking in.

The Concierge desk provides an excellent and friendly service. I am not name checking them individually because they are all a credit to themselves and to the hotel management.

Breakfast is taken in Blanc and there is a decent buffet which together with the a la carte menu is more than satisfactory.

The Bankers Bar is interesting and includes a small but attractive covered terrace if you wish to smoke with your cocktail. Again the staff are excellent, friendly and anxious to please.

We used the Roof Terrace a lot and we really enjoyed it up there both for the odd light lunch and dinner on our first night as we arrived late. We had during our stay a variety of dishes on the Roof Terrace and they were all excellent. The young staff on the Terrace are welcoming, efficient and cannot do enough to see that you are relaxed and content. Because we were there quite a bit I would like to express again our thanks to Clara, Roberto, Constance, Camille and Jenina who are all fantastic. I hope that we haven’t forgotten anyone and the Roof Terrace is a great place to relax at anytime.

We ate one evening in Moments. What can you say other than it was one of our great dining experiences of recent years and our thanks to everyone there and again our complements to the chefs for the wonderful preparations and to the front of house staff for making the evening so memorable. We went a la carte but the Tasting Menu which we saw being served to other table looked fantastic.

This is an outstanding hotel which is a credit to the Mandarin Oriental Group as a whole and to the excellent management of the hotel.",5,2017,10,19
44,wonderful hotel,"spent three great nights at the mandarin oriental hotel. very modern, clean hotel. it has a great bar and two wonderful restaurants. we used the hotel transportation to pick up us from the cruise ship. they were on time and very friendly.

44,Fantastic Stay and Conference,"I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona for 4 nights and was very pleased with the experience.  

The hotel is clean, well appointed and the rooms are as well.  Extensive use of glass makes the room bright while the curtains can be used to create a very dark and comfortable room if you prefer.  The service was excellent as well.  I had some small requests that were handled promptly and beyond my expectations.

The Terrace/Terrat wading pool and lounge was fantastic.  Great views, relaxing and held some of the best staff I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with.  They were exemplary during the day and during an event for the conference I was attending.  ",5,2017,10,16
44,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed,"I have stayed there for two nights on a business trip.
The rooms are clean, large and with a very luxury Interieur.
Location is perfect for visiting the city.
Breakfast is just great and last but not least the hotel staff is very friendly.
I would come back anytime.

PS: don’t miss the rooftop bar!",5,2017,10,11
44,The Staff are Extraordinary!,"The rooms vary quite considerably.  We had 3 visits over a 3 week period and 3 different rooms.  Its very modern, and well appointed.  The best rooms are in the 'new' wing.  These are mostly suites, which are expensive but faultless.  Nothing is too much trouble for all the staff, who are very friendly, yet extremely professional and capable.  The concierge was extremely good at recommending restaurants. Hair/nail salons etc...",5,2017,10,06
44,"Great location, small room","The hotel is very nice and located at the heart of the tourist centre. As you can expect from a Mandarin, it is not cheap.

The staff was very helpful and friendly.  The concierge helped us make reservations for lunches and dinners and reminded us of dress codes, when applicable.

In the room where I stayed, the shower stall was long and narrow. Be careful while treading over the tiles as it could be slippery,  especially when you are older. Maybe for better drainage, the tiles are slanted a bit, so you should be cautious. There is an elongated shower mat, but it does not extend to the entire shower stall. 

The designer of the shower stall never showered there. There is no place for you to place the soap, shampoo or shower gel. Where do you put it after use? Throw it on the floor? What if you need to use it again? You stoop down and fetch it from the floor. A 5 star hotel??? Really? The should install a little rack at the corner of the shower stall to solve this problem.",4,2017,10,04
44,Great service! Great location @Passeig de Garcia. ,"The service by every one of the staff is excellent!! Especially those we frequently contacted ie Daniel, Claudio at concierge and Elena of Guest Relations. They are proactive in giving us advice for our 6-day stay before our arrival and helped us in all aspects during our stay. My husband surprised me with flowers and gift which were nicely arranged by MO. Well done team!",5,2017,10,02
44,Will definitely return!,"We had dinner at Blanc for our anniversary and oh my Lady Gaga, that experience was second to none. The fall menu allows you to taste many dishes, one better than the other to reach the dessert trolly full of wonders.
Excellent service from Gonzalo and Mathieu who master their art.
Will definitely return!",5,2017,09,30
44,Most probably best hotel in Barcelona...,"We stayed here for the first time and it was for two nights.
Location is amazing on the most expensive street in Spain but shame there are so many wooden book stalls in this part of the boulevard. The hotel is luxury with a spectaculair entree ! The concierge service upon arrival one of the best ever experienced.

You can immediately feel this hotel is great ; the decorations are fantastic like the smell and the staff absolutely makes the difference in every sense. They are not only extremely
 friendly but motivated to make your stay exceptional.

We had a luxury boulevard view room but no need to go for the view ; the room was small in my view but might be the case in whole Barcelona. I hate it when suitcases need to be put in walking area of the room.This hotel has a lot of suites !

Breakfast is great in a nice location and huge choice. Spa is great too !
Moments restaurant is amazing but will write a separate review.
Had a few comments but were picked up by the management quickly.
This is the hotel to stay if you want impeccable service and top luxury !",5,2017,09,27
44,Magnifico!,"Lucky enough, I've been able to enjoy a few days at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona and it was a perfect shot! The staff is amazing, very careful & welcoming. The breakfast buffet is perfect with a lot of choices (thanks to Matthieu and his team we've had a good time every morning). The reception team is adorable (Fiona was super friendly), the concierge team is wonderful (Hanna, Claudio, David ... can't remember all their names, but they helped us a lot!). The Fitness, Swimming Pool and Spa are wonderful - ask for Daniela if you want a massage. She is super). The rooftop is very nice and you can enjoy a great view while drinking delicious cocktails or tasting amazing food. The staff is also very nice (Marc, Alice etc..). Nothing wrong to say ... I'll be back for sure!",5,2017,09,26
44,Central location and good facilities,"Only stayed here due to a problem with the price on the BA website - got a 3 night stay for a bargain. Room (deluxe garden) was spacious and had everything I needed except a kettle, only an expresso machine, as I don't drink coffee that didn't impress me. Requested a kettle which arrived very quickly but no tea bags despite asking twice. Glad I didn't pay the full room rate!

Nevertheless a lovely hotel, in a very central location and good facilities. Lots of cafes and restaurants close by as well as designer shops. Would only return if the price was right!",4,2017,09,19
44,A proper 5 star hotel ,"When you stay in a Mandarin hotel you do wonder how other 5 star hotels fall in to the same category . I often think this hotel chain should demand an upgrade to 6 star status !

Having been fortunate to stay in many Mandarin Oriental hotels I always look forward to planning my next visit . This time it was Barcelona... a lovely exciting city with lots of choice in shopping and dining .
I chose on 2 night to dine in the hotel , after all it is the Mandarin and work is paying an allowance :-). All the food we had was prepared and presented to the very highest standard. The entire staff we encountered were all very polite and attentive without being intrusive , I wish other hotels would take note .

You must at least try to stay once in a Mandarin Oriental but beware ... they are addictive! 

",5,2017,09,19
44,Amazing Cocktails!,"Perfect setting on their rooftop bar to try some of their amazing cocktails! Try the white cosmopolitan.

Staff were very helpful and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble!

The view over barcelona was beautiful.

 Thank you very much! :) ",5,2017,09,16
44,Perfect stay!,"Another perfect stay in one of the Mandarin Orientals hotels! The location is great, the hotel is modern and the service is incredible with very attentive and kind stuff. We stayed several nights together with our 1-year old daughter and we only wished that we could stay more. Special thanks to Emanuele who helped us getting out of the hotel on the crowded 11th of September which is a national day in Barcelona.
We wouldn't make it to the airport with our baby without his kind assistance!",5,2017,09,12
44,Bravo - Mandarin Oriental Barcelona,"My wife and I travel with a group of art enthusiasts to special cities with unique art history.  Madrid and Barcelona were the stops this year, and both cities were indeed magnificent cities to indulge in this passion.  

These trips are always ""high-end"", so we expect to stay at top class, and we were not disappointed.  We started at the Ritz in Madrid (managed by the Mandarin Oriental Group) followed by the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona.  Both were great, but the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona was our favorite, matching some of the other great European hotels we have enjoyed on previous trips.

This hotel is very modern in every aspect, the architecture, the room designs, even down to the music playing on the lobby.  Normally this would put a group of more ""mature"" travelers off, but not us.  We found the property very functional, if not slightly confusing given the variety of elevator banks.  However, we loved our room, with a large living area focused on a glass wall with a long balcony overlooking the local neighborhood.  The closet space was spacious and well appointed (although the private safe is poorly located).  The bathroom had double sinks with a large tub and rain shower - perfect for us.  

The public areas of the hotel are attractive and functional, as well. We frequented the Bankers Bar several evenings, and were very pleased with the variety of food and drink, as well as the attentive service. The complimentary breakfast was very special and we started each day there.

The main reason for our enthusiasm for the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona was the service.  From the moment we checked in until the hotel limousine dropped us at the airport, the staff were engaged and engaging.  For example, David took us to our room and he noticed how much my wife admired the Mandarin calendars on the desk - two arrived with a note the next day.  Every staff member seemed to know our name and bent over backwards to make us feel at home.  

My wife and I lived in Asia for 28 years, so we have stayed at Mandarin hotels in many cities.  The Mandarin Barcelona lives up to the best of those.  Bravo!",5,2017,09,10
44,Wonderful Hotel; Excellent and Warm Service,"MY husband and I spent 5 days at the hotel, and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The level of service is very high, but not at all pretentious. It is clear that the people who work here love their jobs and want to make sure that guests are happy. When we checked in, we were entitled to an upgrade as we reserved through AMEX, subject to availability. Well, the hotel was crowded and no upgrade wa available then. Eleni at Reception said that as soon as an upgrade became available, she would move us. Sure enough, we soon got a phone call from her informing us that the next morning staff would move our things to a nicer room. 
Whenever we needed anything we called downstairs and staff brought up whatever we requested. There is a choice of many different pillows which was great. 
Concierge staff is very knowledgeable and helpful.
Breakfast at the hotel is wonderful as well. Finally, great location, short walk from many tourist attractions. If we return to Barcelona we would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,09,07
44,Exceptional experience!!,"Beautiful hotel!  Over the top guest services and concierge services!   We got the BEST recommendations for restaurants and tours!  Perfect location!  Great bathrooms especially for Europe!  Incredible rooftop pool and bar!  Bankers Bar lives up to its reputation!  Not too good to be true!  If you appreciate the luxury experience, you must stay here!",5,2017,09,06
44,"Perfect location, Excellent Customer Service","Our first trip to Barcelona and our first stay at a Mandarin Oriental. We had a wonderful stay, found the location to be ideal, the property beautiful and the service exceptional.  We arrived too early to check in but were set up to change in spa and wake up after the long flight at the rooftop bar and plunge pool and take in the views. 
They were very friendly and accommodating with my 5 year old- giving him a welcome toy and a few treats throughout the stay.  Breakfasts are delicious and included, and my son really enjoyed the area set up specially for kids. 
Concierge made some great restaurant recommendations for us and it was a wonderful stay. We were in a Mandarin room - which has plenty of space to add the rollaway bed and also a great patio looking over the garden and on to some nearly buildings which make you feel like you are living in the city. Utilized the yoga mat on the patio and enjoyed my exercise in the fresh air. Great location. My only critique-- the traditional MO scent that is throughout the property was to me, too overwhelming.",5,2017,09,04
44,Not on the same level as any other Mandarin,"** I have already written a review for Blanc, the restaurant which you should avoid at all costs, unless for breakfast. **

My first impression was that the hotel smells terrible, with intense perfume in all common areas. 

The next thing I noticed were the sheets. The sheets were the most unpleasant thing in my whole stay. They felt like sweaty skin engulfing you from head to toe as you tried to fall asleep. Every time I woke up, I was immediately confronted with the discomfort of these sheets. 

Breakfast was great, with none of the incompetent servers who work at Blanc at night. 

The concierge seemed confused. Every single person recommended different restaurants and one even argued with me about the menu. After checking out all of the recommendations, we decided to go to Blanc the first night (worst decision ever) and the second night, we found our own place. 

We asked them to book a restaurant and the inconsistency continued. One told us that the place never picked up the phone and that they had emailed, another tried calling and said he'd call again later and a third one said they had a connection there but the restaurant 'did not need the hotel' and they'd contact us if they had a space. He told us to see if we had received an email from the hotel but we insisted that we never gave them our details so the hotel would have received the email. He argued with us for a bit before realizing that they had provided the hotel's contact and not ours.

We booked a back up restaurant, a phone call which took entirely too long. The concierge acted victorious when he made the reservation, as if it was some impressive feat. Any five star hotel concierge should expect to get things done, even if it's hard, they shouldn't act like it. This one however couldn't seem to contain the joy of getting a reservation at a half empty restaurant. 

Another thing which shows that this hotel doesn't cater to foodies is their categories. When asking for recommendations, they asked me 'catalan or Michelin?'. I don't understand why a restaurant can't be both, and why Michelin is a way to categorize restaurants, the difference between a 1 star casual Japanese restaurant and a 3 star formal Spanish restaurant could not be anymore different. I'd rather know the cuisine of the restaurant and how formal or casual it is, I can determine for myself whether I think that it's good or not, I don't need stars to tell me that. 

They have 3+ men standing outside the door but only one helps. I asked one a question and he called over one who was helping someone else, making both guests wait longer. 

Currently, there is no other hotel that I'd stay at in Barcelona but I would not go out of my way for this hotel at all. It's not up to the same standards of the other Mandarins.",3,2017,09,03
44,Attention to detail,"This was our first stay at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Barcelona.  From the first minute of arrival we were warmly welcomed, and throughout our stay we experienced an exceptional level of service.  Everyone from the front desk to the housekeeping to the door-staff and the restaurant / lounge servers were exceptional.  Beautiful, serene room and public areas,  outstanding roof terrance lounge and restaurant.  We will definitely stay at this property again next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2017,09,01
44,Excellence,"Excellent 4 nights. Great restaurants and bar. Excellent fitness centre facilities. Excellent communal areas. Excellent room. Excellent staff - helpful, great communications and recommendations for eating out. ",5,2017,08,31
44,Its a Mandarin - When only the best will do!,"If you have ever been to a Mandarin you know what to expect right? The Barcelona Mandarin Hotel did not disappoint with sublime design, impeccably trained staff, perfect location there are literally unlimited adjectives to use to describe this hotel. The highlight however was the concierge staff who directed us to the most fabulous dining experiences in Barcelona - both lunch and dinner. Perhaps the best meals we have had in our lives according to our children. Cannot wait to return to this 5 STAR property!!",5,2017,08,30
44,Wonderful hotel in Barcelona,"Great staff, great rooms excellent food.  I really enjoyed this hotel. The location is central to many attractions.  It is easy to get to and easy to take a taxi anywhere. All of the staff was quite friendly and very helpful.",5,2017,08,29
44,Luxury redefined .. one of the best property,"5 star isn't enough to rate this brilliant property .. maybe 7 stars or 10 stars. Right from the on-boarding to check out ... every step the staff is extremely helpful and courteous !! F&B team Jose, Luis, Marie are just excellent personnel's !! Always looking out to help customers and making them feel at home. Brilliant location just 10 mins walking from Catalunya junction and La Rambla. Will always recommend this property to anyone visiting Barcelona! ",5,2017,08,26
44,Superb,"We were very much looking forward to staying with the Mandarin, we had previously stayed at their hotel in Kuala Lumpur and really enjoyed our stay with them. 

I was so impressed from the moment we arrived at the property in Barcelona. Check in is from 3pm and we arrived at 11am. I enquired if they could allow early check in and the lady at the reception desk apologised as our room wasn't ready and offered us free brunch while we waited, explaining they would try and get the room ready within an hour. 

When we were taken to the restaurant they asked us if we wanted anything a la carte in addition to the buffet in spite of the fact that the breakfast was being offered complimentary. Our room was ready within half an hour but the lady asked us not to rush our brunch and take our time - how lovely. 

Every aspect of the stay was superb. The bed was comfortable, the room was lovely with great views of the famous Passeig de Garcia. Great showers, Acqua di Parma toiletries, very comfortable beds. However, best of all were the staff, every member of staff was so courteous and helpful, in particular the concierge team. 

I am tempted to make another trip to this lovely city just so I can stay at this property again. ",5,2017,08,25
44,AMAZING!!!!!,"This restaurant, rooftop, was one of the best experiences I've had eating out abroad. 

The service (people) were lovely and attentive. 
The food was amazing! This Peruvian style tapas was mind blowing. 
Wine (rose) was great. 
Scenery is beautiful, especially during the sunset.

A must for people that visit Barcelona. Just amazing, I can't say it enough.",5,2017,08,24
44,Exceptional Hotel in every aspect,"Our hotel stay was nothing less than exceptional in every aspect. We were thrilled by the staff's friendliness and attention to every detail, especially during the aftermath of the tragic terror incident. We felt like we are among our family, the staff kept on updating and reassuring us on the situation and always making sure that we were safe and comfortable.

You set the standards in exceptional hotel services.",5,2017,08,23
44,Look elsewhere in Barcelonia,"I paid approximately $1,000 US per night and spent one night corralling a cockroach in my room.  They couldn't find a delivery to the hotel (only a friend's credit card!).  After many phone calls and a fair bit of panic, we found the package in our room.  Tracking deliveries is not their strong suite.  Stayed four nights and housekeeping cleaned it three nights, 75% isn't bad.  Very friendly staff.",2,2017,08,23
44,Perfect stay at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona,"We had a wonderful time in Barcelona and thoroughly enjoyed our time at the stunning Mandarin Oriental. I thoroughly recommend this hotel, having stayed in a few others in the vicinity. The staff at the hotel really are incredible, nothing is too much. The breakfast is perfect (and importantly includes healthy options!) The rooftop is the perfect place to relax with a drink and a dip in the pool after a day of exploring the city.",5,2017,08,22
44,Amazing,"Staff are first class. Location is great, right in the centre of the city on Barcelona's ""Rodeo Drive"".  Food is sublime with various restaurants to choose from. The roof terrace is beautiful, so peaceful and peruvian inspired sushi which is second to none.  Decor and ambience in the restaurants is simply sublime.  ",5,2017,08,21
44,Understated simple luxury ,"Iconic location in Barcelona, on the main P de Gracia but understated to make one feel that it is almost tucked away in a small lane. Beautiful hotel, nice rooms, though small, and lovely amenities.  Service is excellent though at times one could sense a holier than thou attitude from some members of the team.  

The breakfast is delicious, fresh, healthy and just enough variety so as to not overwhelm you with a big spread.   

Enjoyed the stay and will go back if the price is good !",4,2017,08,21
44,Its the personal touch that matters !,"Barcelona is a great city with a multitude of hotel options....but if you are looking for a true oasis in the heart of the city this is it.  The location cannot be beat (in the heart of the most upscale area).  But this hotel is all about the personal touch.  The staff went out of their way to make our entire family feel welcome.  When the guest services manager found out that it was our daughters 14th birthday balloons and a NUT FREE cake (yes they knew she was allergic) appeared in her room.

The upstairs bar area has a fantastic city view and is a great place to relax with dinner or a drink.  The kids loved the indoor pool and the breakfast service.

A big thank you to the ENTIRE team for a fantastic stay !",5,2017,08,18
44,Not the best,Stayed here for 5 days and was disappointed .  The hotel and staff did not meet any of my expectations. The concierge wasn't helpful at all. The hotel itself is def not 5 stars. The in room dinning was not good at all. Very limited. When calling in for in room dining they actually were annoyed because they mentioned being busy already and really didn't want to take more orders. The gym is tiny and very limited with selection of equipment. Overall the customer service and demeanor of staff was poor. The rooms are tiny and dark. Not a good experience. The roof lounge was also tiny and their menu was even smaller. ,1,2017,08,14
44,Spectacular experience in Barcelona!,My wife and I spent 5 nights at this wonderful hotel that is centrally located to see all of the sites. Our suite was beyond description exceeded only by the best service I have ever received at any luxury hotel. Kudos to the entire staff who always were pleasant and efficient. Breakfast was was wonderful with more choices than anyone could ask for. ,5,2017,08,10
44,😉 👍Amazing!,"Mandarin Oriental...was outstanding!  By far a 5*****  Hotel!
Just very pricey!   
Loved it...staff didn't know what to do for you!
It was in the BEST location ...
I totally recommend the Mandarin Oriental....👍",5,2017,08,08
44,Ideal location,"This is probability the best hotel in Barcelona.   I came in with high expectations and for the most part v was not disappointed. 

Rooms:
We had two connecting rooms.  One was a king the other a twin.  They had one common entrance.   Both rooms were on the small side.  We were traveling with family and it worked out for us but I wondered how it would be if we only had one room.  There is a common foyer that leads to both rooms.... this could be awkward if in the next room there is someone you are not travelling with.   The rooms were modernly decorated, bed was great.

Bathroom:

Nice palma amenities.  Shower was a little cramped but not too bad.  Took a little bit to figure out the controls.  Wife said the floor was slippery although I didn't have the same experience.   No good place for a towel.   

Didn't eat at any of the restaurants so can't comment

Grounds and location:

AC was a little weak in the common areas and no AC in the elevator.   Lobby is also relatively small.  Location is on the passeig de Gracia which is basically the 5th avenue of BCN.   Ideal location and away from the crazy crowds of las rambles.

Service: was quick and prompt... Concierge was very Helpful with a great tapas recommendation.   A nice touch was the prayer mat. 

Value for money: a bit pricey for what I got in return but not too bad. That along with the lack of AC in the elevator and common areas is why I give it only a 4 stars.  I would definitely stay here again though.",4,2017,08,06
44,Barcelona Mandarin Oriental,"5 Stars on all levels. Butler service and concierge service is excellent. Rooms are beautiful, breakfast room very very nice.
If I can state a minor observation: when it is hot in Barcelona, the lobby should increase the air conditioning.  And, also the elevators.",5,2017,08,04
44,"The best hotel in Barcelona, but not within the Mandarin Oriental network ","Unique combination of a very convenient location and yet an oasis of calm on the Passeig de Gràcia (a bit like the original Mandarin hotel in HK). The other great thing about the Barça MO is the superb front staff (porters, receptionists, concierges) - friendly, pro-active, courteous. Public spaces (especially the restaurants) are elegant and chic in an understated way. Otherwise, the rooms tend to be on the small side, with a décor more like a W-hotel (cute but not classy) than a premier palazzo, no Nespresso machine (or even a kettle with coffee or tea bags for that matter), poor fruit selection, slow and weak wifi. Guests used to MO's in Asia will be surprised at the absence of a hot teapot brought to your room upon check-in, or the underwhelming breakfast buffet (probably 1/4 or 1/3 of the diverse food offerings in Asia). Quality wise, F&B is good, especially at the signature, two-Michelin star Moments (see separate review). Beautiful pool (which only opens at 8 am!!), tiny gym with modern equipment, though. In other words, a five-star offering at a six-star pricing.",4,2017,08,03
44,Restaurant: impeccable service if overpriced ,"I'm a little torn, I visited the the blanc restaurant to meet a friend who was staying in the hotel. It was a beautiful setting and the staff were friendly and provided excellent service. 

However, although the food was well cooked, I had the Ox Burger, it was quite bland and a little too sweet for my liking. I felt it was overpriced for what it was. That said, the overall experience was enjoyable, so I would certainly still consider staying there myself and checking out their other restaurants. ",4,2017,07,31
44,"Excellent, fabulous location",Great location on a beautiful wide avenue surrounded by Barcelona's most iconic buildings.  The waterfront is within walking distance (15 minutes) or a very short taxi ride.  Everything you would expect from this category hotel.  Highly recommended,5,2017,07,29
44,Great Service and Good Location,"Stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for several days and couldn't have found a finer place. Service by ALL staff was supurb, the breakfast was excellent and the location was right in the middle of everything. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,07,26
44,Excellent,"Fantastic stay all staff were amazing, there was nothing they couldn't do for us, they remember your name, your preferences make you feel fantastic. Highly recommended they treated you like to royalty and made you feel welcome ",5,2017,07,16
44,Simply The Best,"If you are one of the nearly 50,000 travelers who read my reviews, listen up! When in Barcelona, stay at this incredible Hotel. Do not even consider another option unless price is a major concern. As you know, the Mandarin Oriental Hotels offer the best but are also pricey. If you can somehow skip a meal to save the bucks, do so to stay here!

From the moment their Guests arrive, the Staff at this Mandarin Oriental (MO) make them feel welcome. There is no request too big or too small that you can make of them. Whatever needs to be done or accomplished will be done in the most professional manner. 

The Staff at this MO are just the best that this city has to offer. They are incredibly knowledgeable, caring, well-trained and excited about their work. It is simply a pleasure to be with them. The Concierge Desk is manned by extremely nice and knowledgeable men and women who, I believe , can get anything done asked of them!

The Front Desk folks are equally nice and helpful. They take exceptional pride in producing exceptional service. 

The rooms are new, beautiful, comfortable and are attended to by the amazing Housekeeping Staff. Their twice-daily attention to your room will have you in awe. 

Frankly, I can't imagine a hotel in this City better than this one. They truly have their act together for the benefit of their Guests. 

When you are next in this glorious city, stay at the Mandarin Oriental. You will be forever glad that you did so - I promise,,

Go. Stay. Enjoy. ",5,2017,07,15
44,Very nice hotel,"Being a Mandarin, it is typically very pretty, great service, clean and very high end.  It is located in a great area, rooms are very nice and large for Europe, Breakfast isn't worth the price.  Rooftop bar is very nice, ""dipping"" pool is pretty but really should be a real pool instead of what it is.  View in the back of hotel isn't nice at all.  Service very good and food choices good as well.  Overall a very nice high end hotel but I would say a better business hotel rather than a "" vacation"" type hotel, but if you can afford it, it is very nice.",4,2017,07,13
44,Outstanding service and a truly luxurious hotel in Barcelona,"If you are looking for a luxurious stay and a hotel with the finest touch you should consider Mandarin Oriental Barcelona. The duty manager, the front desk, the concierge, the butler for our room all the way to the general manager are thoroughly outstanding, We did not know the hotel GM but at breakfast, Andrei Devillers, general manager,came up to greet the guests at each table and introduced himself. He wanted to know what the guests requirements were and there was nothing too big or too small for him, a personal touch that reflects his dedication and leadership. We had a wonderful suite overlooking the prestigious Passeig de Gracie. They have a Michelin star restaurant and we would give them a Michelin star even at their normal restaurant which is opened for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Our suite was so beautiful that we had in room dining one night just to enjoy private dining. Be sure to have a mojito on the rooftop and enjoy their ceviche and other Peruvian specialties. This is a truly wonderful stay and definitely a hotel we want to return.",5,2017,07,12
44,Top- Notch Service,At least there is 1 peaceful place within Barcelona city center. There was no feeling of outsider or tourist but rather a usual luxury service only expected from this hotel. Impressive! ´luv the ladies washroom,5,2017,07,12
44,High Style Questionable Function ,"This is a modern hotel reburbished into an older building. There are some style elements however that don't work. 
In the rooms the bathroom is an opaque glass cubicle with a double bath. Sounds fine but if you turn the lights on in the middle of the night the whole bedroom lights up! The shower has a drainage system that if you drop the soap it is lost!
The other disappointing feature is their roof top ""pool"". Having seen the pictures I thought it would be perfect in summer to do laps. Unfortunately it is only 60cm or 2 foot deep. It is a "" dipping pool"". There is another 12 meter indoor pool useless in summer.
The breakfast is expensive as are most things in the hotel but that is the cost of high style. 7 Euro for still water poolside.
Redeeming feature is their attentive staff. Daniel in Concierge was outstanding.",3,2017,07,12
44,Great start to our wonderful Mediterranean Cruise holiday !,"This was indeed a great start staying at the Mandarin Barcelona. The overall staff was very attentive and caring. Hector Lugo won our hears by being extremely hospitable. The location of the hotel is excellent as well. We will definitely look forward to going back to the hotel again. Oh I forgot to mention the amazing 4 hours dinner we had at the Moments restaurant which is surely one of our longest dinner ever.  It was very memorable with the food being excellent, the degustation menu was so original and presentation of the food was awesome, a definite must try restaurant if you want a memorable dinner experience!",5,2017,07,09
44,Mandarin Oreintal Hotel Barcelona,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. All the staff were very friendly and nothing was to much trouble in making our stay so memorable. Even the General Manager Mr. Gregg Liddell came to see us throughout our stay to see if were being looked after.

The restaurant Moments (Michelin rated) was excellent and gets fully booked up every night (so book early). Hector Lugo the Restaurants and Bars Manager was amazing and he really took care of us.

44,Great location,"Of all the Mandarin's I've stayed in, this is probably my least favorite just because of the size/style, but our room was still lovely and the location was perfect.  Within walking distance of many things.  The staff was very kind.",4,2017,07,07
44,Classy Joint,"Stayed here for 3 nights using Amex platinum program with complimentary breakfast, late checkout and spa credit. Hotel in great location. Staff is highly polished and helpful. Rooms adequate size and nicely decorated. Nice rooftop pool. Excellent food. No complaints. Highly recommend. ",5,2017,07,06
44,"If you aren't staying in the hotel, they do not take you serious.","I wanted to check out the hotel and restaurant as I had just moved to Barcelona. While I was having a drink at the rooftop, I was asked multiple times if I was staying at the hotel, and every time I said no, they seemed to then take care of the other guests who were and leave me desperate to get their attention. The same happened at the restaurant, when I arrived they asked me if I was staying at the hotel and then when I said no,  the same happened - trying to get their attention to order, to have some water etc. 

Overall I am sure its a great hotel and possibly I got them on a bad day, but the mandarin oriental should have consistent service everywhere in the world.",3,2017,06,30
44,First time in Barcelona,"This is my first visit in Barcelona. I stayed at Mandarin Oriental Barcelona. We stayed in room 512 for 1 night. from the checked in by Elena I knew that I found my hotel in Spain. I had the chance to met Andre Devillers the Hotel Manager and Lluis Pou Executive Housekeeper in the lobby. They were outstanding during my stay. We loved the view of the rooftop. We met a French lady I think her name was Charlotte. She is an amazing waitress .I will never forget my wonderful experience at Mandarin Oriental Barcelona. This is the hotel were people should go in Barcelona from the room service, HSkp, Bar,Reception. EVERYTHING was PERFERCT. Mr. Devillers  you have the best team in BARCELONA. and thank you to Nokuba or Nokuma for the checked out. I will come back soon.Jimmy Camara",5,2017,06,29
44,Our preferred hotel in BCN,"Great location
Stunning building inside and out
Dreamy rooftop pool area if a little small, so make sure to book in advance for dinner/lunch. 
Great cocktail bar with comprehensive choice of drinks and nibbles. 
Service is by far the best in all of Barcelona. Other 5 stars do not even come close. 
We only came to eat here but we left as loyal customers who will always stay here going forward. 
Very impressed with every aspect of the hotel and is consistent with the MO brand (when compared to standards at MO Singapore)
 ",5,2017,06,27
44,Location ambiance and service,"The Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona is as perfect a hotel as you will find. The service, as expected, was first class. From reception to concierge to Maid service. The waitstaff was attentive and beyond courteous, the amenities are all you'd expect and more. If you are looking for a first class hotel in Barcelona, look no further.",5,2017,06,23
44,Tale of two rooms,"Mandarin Oriental pride themselves in their service and indeed it is excellent. They raise the bar to almost unachievable levels though by stating that their objective is to anticipate their guests needs. That's a tall order, but all the staff are exceptional. 
Even though Barcelona is a crowded city the hotel has a sense of quiet with many rooms facing a very large and unusual internal garden - which by the way appears to be little used by most guests, it is an ideal refuge to read a book or to enjoy a glass of something shaded under the arbor.
So it might be worthwhile checking out your room before committing. Our friends paid the same rate as we did but their room was much smaller. Ours was excellent except for one thing. We couldn't possibly work out the lighting in the three nights we were there. You'd need half an hours intensive instruction to come close to mastering what must be the most confusing lighting we have ever experienced. 
One other thing which disappointed us was the rooftop pool. Its not a pool, its a trick of photography, its only knee deep, more suited to gold fish. On the other hand there is a very good internal pool in the basement.
Staff exceptional. Location great.",4,2017,06,22
44,Great service and well appointed rooms,"If you like 5 star accommodations and are looking for flawless service in a clean and modern environment, you'll love this hotel. Personally I prefer a more local experience and was eager to explore all of the offerings of Barcelona so I don't feel like I got to enjoy my room. However, all of the food venues are great and the service was incredibly impressive. You're welcomed with fresh tea and a tour of the property and your rooms. The variety of venues under one roof is very convenient and each of them are different and enjoyable. The rooms are very well appointed and cleanly decorated. There is an asian influence throughout the design of the hotel but everything is done tastefully and is not over the top. The room was somewhat small but filled with all the amenities you could need - a welcome note and gesture of fruit and chocolate, mouthwash, toothpaste, and anything you could ever need. The rain shower in the bathroom was nice and we had a great view onto the street and could see the Gaudi house right from the room. Everyone was incredibly helpful with booking taxis, answering questions, and they event left us a nice complimentary ""anniversary"" gesture of roses in our room the one night.",5,2017,06,19
44,Exceptional in every way,"Perhaps best hotel experience of our lives. Rooms are perfectly appointed with good  layout, comfortable beds, nice rain shower, excellent sound proofing. Location is ideal- 5 min walk into old town and close to Gaudi sites. Numerous restaurant choices nearby. We ate at every dining venue except Moments, and all were of the highest quality and service. The food was truly outstanding, from breakfast buffet to rooftop terrace tapas. Nice pools on roof and in basement. Hotel gym is well appointed. Service was unfailingly efficient, professional and friendly, from bellmen to reception to waiters to housekeeping. They went well above and beyond any reasonable expectations for service. Mentioned that we were there to celebrate a milestone birthday and they sent up balloons, champagne and cake. ",5,2017,06,14
44,2 Things You Must Do in Barcelona - Stay at the Mandarin Oriental & try Iberico Ham,"We always stay at 5-Star hotels when travelling. However, Barcelona Mandarin Oriental has redefined what good service should be. Outstanding service fron Blanc wait staff (Clare), butler service staff (Adriana and Jaime) and Carlos with valet team. No matter what part of the hotel, the staff went out of there way to make our stay memorable.  In fact, we changed reservations for the last part of our trip to stay at the Mandarin Oriental Milan (from other 5-star hotel).",5,2017,06,13
44,wonderful food again at the Blanc,"What can I say, if you are amongst the people who is a regular guest at the Blanc restaurant at the Mandarin in Barcelona. You should be so happy as I was to see Blanc is back in its original glory. Mrs Carme Ruscalleda is finally in charge and what a difference. I loved it is Catalan food at its absolute best, the extraordinary and excellent service from the staff, and the best of all the dessert wagon is back with some exquisite french pastries, who in this world would not love a lunch dinner ir even breakfast with that combination of quality, love and passion. One of the best restaurants in Barcelona and if you look for quality and moderate prices this is the place, 
enjoy  ",5,2017,06,12
44,"A great hotel, but not as great as I was expecting.","The service is 8 out of 10, the rooms are small, the back of the hotel faces a school which is loud, and the front entrance isn't overly welcoming. However the food is excellent, the spa is wonderful, the location is beyond perfect, and the finishes in the room are great. I will try somewhere else next time, but will likely return to the MO Barcelona when the price is right.",4,2017,06,10
44,Great location,"I stayed in a Deluxe Boulevard room for 3 nights as part of a large corporate group. The hotel is ideally located amongst high end shops, bars and restaurants with numerous tourist attractions within easy reach.

The bedroom was very comfortable with all amenities you would expect from a 5* hotel (even hair straighteners).

Service was efficient and the staff pleasant.

I do think that the hotel prices are over inflated, but I suppose if people are willing to pay this then they will continue to charge for this premium brand. I don't think I would necessarily stay again (unless someone else was paying) as there are other hotels which offer the same level of service and comfort for a fraction of the cost.",4,2017,06,10
44,For the astronomical rate I expect perfection,"For the astronomical room rate I expect perfection in a hotel of this sort.  I have always found great service in other Mandarin Orientals, but not in this one.  Although they had nice details with us, room amenities are scarce, water is not put at nights in the rooms and the concierge service is terrible.  They sent us to dine in a tourist trap.  They fill the place with hotel guests when in Barcelona there is a huge variety of spectacular restaurants.  When I requested to speak to the manager, the girl in the front desk said she was the manager and I wasted my time talking to her to find out the hotel manager was not on site. And yes, this hotel is out of control and the staff in the front desk is not apt to handle such property.  I do believe Mandarin Oriental should look into this property.",3,2017,06,09
44,Family does not want to leave!!,"We are visiting the MO Barcelona for the second year in a row in June.  This time it is pre-cruise.  Our family wants to stay in Barcelona and instead at the Mandarin Oriental!

Or course we are going on the cruise, but that gives you some kind of insight into this city and the luxury and detail (and amazing service) at the hotel.  

Not only is the service amazing, but the rooms, restaurants and location are the best. 

Don't even think about booking anywhere else if you can afford this place.",5,2017,06,09
44,Great hotel,Excellent hotel for a relaxing trip to Barcelona. The location cannot be improved upon for easy access to the sights of the city and shopping. Good restaurants in the nearby areas. And Gaudi's Casa Batllo is a bonus. ,5,2017,06,07
44,Outstanding in every way. HIGHLY recommend,"Best service ever had. Perfect balance of helping without making you feel stalked. And, more importantly, extremely friendly and positive staff who make you feel welcome, not just lucky to be here (even though we are!). Concierge desk incredibly friendly and effective as well. 

They should start a school on how to provide guest services.

Location can't be better. Spa was also excellent as are other facilities. 

And, best yet, Memphis Grizzlies fans which mean they know their sports and know their Gasol brothers. 

If coming to Barcelona, this is the place to stay. ",5,2017,06,06
44,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"Excellent stay. Perfect location, exceptional staff, most courteaus and caring attitude, great breakfast. A wonderful hotel as a whole. I highly recommend this hotel to couple an amazing Barcelona ezperience. ",5,2017,06,03
44,Wonderful celebration ,"We recently stay for 4 days at the hotel celebrating our 50 th wedding anniversary and our friends 60 th Birthday we had the most amazing stay and were treated incredibly , ALL the staff from the moment we arrived until we left were truly outstanding in every facet of the hotel and made our stay outstanding .",5,2017,05,29
44,One amazing place!,"So the location is perfect, the building is beautiful, the rooms are super but the big wow factor has to be the staff! From the front desk when checking in and out, the amazing concierge staff, the knowledgable yet personable staff in the 2 Michelin starred restaurant MOments, the staff in the restaurant Blanc, and everyone you may contact....they are all super friendly and helpful! They lend a real personal touch to what could otherwise be just another fab hotel! It is pricey but we felt it was totally worth it!! Can't wait to stay again! A special thanks to Fiona at the the front desk (and seemingly everywhere)!",5,2017,05,24
44,Good Hotel,The Mandarin was just what I expected it to be . A solid safe choice in a city that I have never been to before . Amenities were  nice including Bar and spa .Highlight of Hotel however was the staff . Exceptional service . ,4,2017,05,24
44,First Class Experience!,"My husband and I travel frequently and have stayed at a number of Mandarin Oriental properties around the world. Our stay at the Barcelona property was by far one of the best experiences we have had with Mandarin Oriental and that was made possible by Thais Guerrero and the entire concierge staff. Upon arrival we had some issues with our room but Ms. Guerrero quickly resolved the problem and provided us with excellent customer service throughout our visit. The entire staff, specifically treated us with dignity and respect, were extremely professional and courteous and went above and beyond to ensure that we had a comfortable stay.  We were extremely impressed with their willingness to make us feel welcome and how much they took pride as representatives of the hotel. It is important that Ms. Guerrero and the entire concierge staff be recognized and praised for their outstanding hospitality. Thank you for a wonderful visit and look forward to our next stay. We will certainly be recommending the hotel to our colleagues, friends and family!",5,2017,05,22
44,"Expensive, may be worth the concierge!","Yes, this is one of those expensive hotels. First we stayed in which has their own Michelin starred restaurant. Due to a bad cold, I didn't eat there,

The staff is young, energetic, pleasant and very helpful - truly a welcome surprise to us. The concierge staff did an outstanding job, handling all our requests with aplomb. They set up reservations at four excellent restaurants for dinner, and two more for lunch. All of these were very good.",5,2017,05,22
44,Simply the best,"The best rooms, service, location and most importantly staff. Also, we had such an amazing experience dining at the hotel that we think we had better food at the Mandarin than at restaurants outside the hotel.
I also think that they have the best staff ... they are so helpful.",5,2017,05,22
44,Luxury and high standards,"This was a short one night stay whilst I was in town in Barcelona. The staff were exceptional - extremely polite at reception including being walked and shown around the room. The hotel itself is right on one of the main streets of Barcelona, but it was so quiet inside you would never tell, a perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle.

The room was only their basic but it was huge and more than adequate. The bathroom was fully stocked with every toiletry you need, with exception to deodorant and big styling! The shower is fantastic. The only downside was having to request an iron and ironing board, but a minor fact in the grand scheme of things. 

The rooftop area was extremely relaxing, and the ""refresh"" pool is just above knee height but does the job to cool down from the sun. The views are fantastic and it is very serine. Drinks are around 10euro for a glass of wine or beer. Room service food was of a high quality but expensive as expected for the convenience.  

The spa was a nice area as well if the sun gets too much on the roof. A cool pool for lengths and a steam room, and there are extra treatments available. I didn't partake in any of those though. Unfortunately, the garden was closed for a private function so I was unable to sample the area.

Concierge we great at holding bags after check out and very helpful in arranging airport transport. 

A very nice stay and I'll hopefully be back soon as I fell in love with Barcelona! ",5,2017,05,21
44,Overview,"Fabulous location. The best concierge service ever. I communicated them prior to our trip and expressed our desires regarding restaurants and entertainment. They afforded us the best tables at every place we went. They coordinated a fabulous private driver for us who was extremely well-versed in both architecture and art history. Rooms were satisfactory, but for the price I would expected larger and more ""female"" friendly. Our room was north of $700 per night, and we had a Fabulous street view. In general our room was poorly lit and there was no place to sit down to get ready with hair or make up. Also the rooms were skimpy on closet and drawer space. Loved both the rooftop bar and the bar inside. The modern nature of the furniture in the lobby was extremely uncomfortable when meeting guests. Given these physical problems, however, the staff was superb",4,2017,05,16
44,This place gets it right everytime,"If youre feeling like treating yourself you just couldn't go wrong. Id stay here again and again - motivates me to keep playing the lottery so i can come back again and again. 

The only difficulty you'll have is choosing from the amazing menus",5,2017,05,09
44,Beautiful top class hotel,"Stayed here on a work convention with around 25 couples. Superb welcome and service. Room was very comfortable. Bathroom beautiful with an outstanding rain shower. 
Breakfast was ok with a good variety but the hot food buffet was a tiny bit disappointing. The fresh fruit and yogurt/cake selection was delicious.
The location is outstanding on a beautiful tree lined street. The weather was appalling with pouring rain for two days  but on leaving the hotel complimentary umbrellas were given out which was a nice touch. We didn't use the spa facilities but popped in and they looked fantastic.
Overall a beautiful hotel, would I have stayed there if I was paying myself, absolutely not, is it worth the money per night, absolutely not.",4,2017,05,09
44,A Stay To Remember Forever,"I chose The Mandarin Oriental Barcelona as the place to propose to the love of my life. I had certain expectations as The Mandarin is world renowned for luxury service and world class stay experiences. I have stayed in many Mandarin Oriental properties previously but I must say The Mandarin Barcelona has now won a special place in my heart because of its people.

I reached out to Ms. Victoria Simpson from the Sales Department in March to coordinate my special plans and she quickly connected me to Ms. Thais Guerrero from Guest Services. These two women absolutely exceeded my expectations as they took my inquiries, plans and requests to heart and made it their personal mission to see to it that everything was perfect. I cannot thank them enough as they helped create memories that my fiancee and I will cherish for the rest of our lives. 

As a hospitality professional myself, I do not get impressed easily as I have a discerning eye for detail and customer service. But when I say every request was fulfilled, I mean every detail down to the placement of the flowers, the specific champagne I wanted and the scheduled romantic turn down service with flower petal placement on the bed was followed to perfection. This was truly world class service and the team at Mandarin Oriental Barcelona executed everything flawlessly. I suppose the reason for getting the perfect experience was due to the diligent planning of Victoria and Thais - they literally emailed me every week for over one month to ensure our plans were coming together!

As if that weren't enough, we were upgraded to the most beautiful studio suite replete with all the amenities a couple could ever want. We had a lovely balcony overlooking the beautiful garden and the bathroom was bigger than some hotel rooms I have seen in New York City. The Banker's Bar was simply magnificent and the rooftop, Terrat, had the best views of the city with the most friendly servers I have ever met.

Lastly, I cannot stress enough how wonderful Victoria and Thais were as they also were aware this was my first time in Barcelona. They compiled a list of sights and restaurants for us to visit and we were never disappointed. We were even given all alternative options for transportation as there was a taxi strike on the day we checked out. We had to make our way to Valencia via train and we easily got to the train station thanks to the staff who proactively mapped out our alternate route. 

Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is simply one of the best places to stay in. The property is not only impeccable and beautiful but the people make it a stay experience to remember. I highly recommend staying here and I will make it a point to come back as soon as I can.",5,2017,05,07
44,Luxury....at a price.,"Having stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Bangkok many years ago and remembering the hotel fondly, we decided to reduce our planned 4-day stay in Barcelona to 3 days but stay at the MO instead!
Located in the Park Lane equivalent street in a former bank headquarters, the hotel exudes luxury at every turn, both from the facilities to the guests. The rooftop open air restaurant set the scene on our first evening, with a delicious small plates meal featuring Peruvian cuisine. Exquisite tastes, with excellent service, but at120 Euros, not something to be enjoyed every evening. 
Being a city centre hotel, the room was small, with a definite triumph of design over function, but luxurious nevertheless.
The service throughout the hotel was impeccable, especially from the Concierges who were attentive and helpful.
Would we stay again? Not at those prices, but it was a reminder that excellence commands its own price, and it was a welcoming haven to return to after a day's sightseeing.",4,2017,05,03
44,My Favorite Mandarin Oriental,"I've stayed in a few Mandarin hotels (NY, Paris, Milan, Tokyo) and Barcelona has been my favorite.  

Cost.  It's not an inexpensive hotel, but there is definitely great value if you seek out attentive and warm customer service with a great in-room product and location.  

Dining.  I didn't have breakfast at the hotel or dine at Moments, but I liked Bistreau and Terrat.  Bistreau offers a comfortable ambiance while Terrat has a great rooftop view that allows almost 360 views.  

Location.  Hard to beat Passeig de Gracia for location in Barcelona--especially for a first-time traveler.  Many of the historic sites are within 1-1.5 miles.  High-end shopping is within footsteps of the hotel entrance and La Rambla is two subway stops away.

Service.  The check-in, the concierges, the butlers, dining, and check-out--there was never a moment when I felt like I was an inconvenience to any of the employees of the hotel.  All requests were met with a warm greeting and smile.",5,2017,05,03
44,"Quality, not hype.","Let's call it what it is - it is not inexpensive.  However, you never felt as though you did not get your money's worth and that is the difference.  It isn't hype or marketing.  These folks are just that good.  The service, at every level, is attentive to you enjoying your stay and helping in any way possible.  They are appreciate you being there and are professional in how they show it.  They epitomize the term ""customer service.""  The hotel rooms are modern and incredibly tasteful.  Bed was so comfortable, I didn't want leave the room.  The location is exactly where you want to be.  If you have never stayed in a top flight hotel before, this is the one you need to come to.  If you have enjoyed other top hotels but not this Mandarin, you need to change course.",5,2017,04,30
44,Amazing.,"Our stay at the Mandarin in Barcelona was simply fantastic. I could not have asked for a better hotel. If you do choose to stay at the Mandarin, I would definitely recommend eating dinner there one night as the food for both breakfast and dinner was superb. The rooms were extremely modern and sleek and always kept neat. And last, but certainly not least, the service was excellent. Overall, I have no complaints and would come back in a heartbeat :)",5,2017,04,29
44,A Jewel in Bustling Barcelona,Enjoyed a two night stay at this spectacular modern Mandarin Oriental Hotel with well-appointed spacious rooms. The hotel concierge were knowledgeable providing fast track tickets to the Casa Batllo which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The rooftop bar has lovely views of the city and even better cocktails.,5,2017,04,27
44,Excellent hotel and location ,"My husband and I just finished our 3 night stay at the Mandarin and could not be more pleased. The location was excellent. Walking distance to passeig de gracia, other popular sites, and many great restaurants. Also right near the metro. Our standards are pretty high when it comes to cleanliness and service, and the Mandarin did not disappoint. The room was very comfortable and modern and they accommodated our request for an early check in. The concierge was on point with every single dining recommendation, putting my hours of restaurant research to shame. The front desk was even extremely patient with us when we were late to check out. The one regret I have is not bringing my own hair dryer.. the one in the room worked very poorly and took forever to dry my hair. Minor detail. When my husband and I return to Barcelona, we certainly plan to stay here again.",5,2017,04,26
44,Bacelona visit April 19-23,This was my first trip to Barcelona and after my visit I am just so impressed with what the city has to offer. I stayed the first two days at a meeting hotel near les Corts but after the meeting spent my final two days at the Mandarin. Check-in was really efficient and pleasant. My room wasn't quite ready but I was taken down to the restaurant to relax. the room was ready within 15 minutes. I had the mandarin room with a view and a terrace overlooking the garden. My one issue with the room was that there were no free power outlets by the desk and I had to unplug a lamp to plug in my computer. really comfortable bed and the bathroom was also very bright and clean with Aqua De Parma products. The hotel is centrally located on Passeig De Gracia right next to a metro station. location cannot be beat. I  had room service and the person who delivered the room service offered to leave his personal bottle opener with me. I thought this gesture is really an example of the legendary customer service provided by the Mandarin. Check out was as efficient as check in- I was given a call that evening and was asked about any transportation issues. a cab was waiting for me at check out- really fantastic service from the minute you check in to when you leave- will definitely come back,5,2017,04,25
44,Beautiful hotel and amazing service!,"We are just back from a long week-end at the Mandarin Oriental and although we had high expectations, I have to admit that we were impressed by the facilities and the overall service. In fact, all the members of staff we have met during our stay have exceeded our expectations. I cannot recall staying in a hotel were everyone was this consistently and genuinely kind and effective. I cannot thank enough Myriam and Fiona for looking after our stay... I will miss Barcelona!",5,2017,04,23
44,Perfection from A to Z!,"If you are looking for the best accommodation in Barcelona, look no further! 
This is by far and beyond, the very best hotel in the city.
The property is stunning! It has this perfect blend of Catalan and Oriental feel.
Our Deluxe Room had a beautiful layout and was one of the most spacious we've ever seen.
From the moment we stepped in the lobby until the moment we left the hotel, we have been pampered and so well taken care of. 
In fact, each and everyone of the staff members are not only making sure that you are enjoying your stay but they are actually doing everything possible to go the extra mile. 
From the Hotel Manager to the Reception team, everybody was so gracious and attentive.
Just to name a few we would like to thank in particular Camille at the Bistreau who has to be one of the warmest and smiling person ever and remembers your exact order from the previous day ...and Franco at the Concierge Desk who understands perfectly what you are looking for and makes spot on recommendations.

One tip: at sunset, to have a Mandarin Mojito on the Rooftop.",5,2017,04,23
44,Best Hotel Stay Ever!,"My wife and I stayed over the Easter weekend, which coincided with my birthday. 

The hotel is in a great location, very central and nice area, inside its an oasis, so relaxing and peaceful. 

The best part though are the staff, from check in to breakfast, lunch, dinner, the bar and concierge i have never felt so at home in a hotel. The staff genuinely make time for you and go out of their way to enhance every aspect of your stay. we were only there for 4 days but i actually miss them! 

If you are visiting Barcelona and are considering staying somewhere else, stop and just book the MO, its wonderful!",5,2017,04,19
44,"Perfect location, wonderful hotel","If you did not know where to look, you might walk right by the MO. Everything is low key and, yet, excellent. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The rooms are light and airy. Everything works. The Concierge staff is amazing!  This hotel may be expensive, but if you want a 5 star experience, this is it.  ",5,2017,04,16
44,Good location but kind of spotty service,"Disappointed.  Had wanted to stay here (we usually stay at the Majestic up the street) but we had trouble getting our room here and when we finally did get it they couldn't find our bags, which the porter took some place.  After a trip to see the manager they finally appeared 45 minutes later.  Breakfast was okay but the omelette uninspired.  I had a mushroom/cheese/ham and if there was much ham or cheese in it then it was hidden.  There was no bathtub at all in our room (6th floor front view) but it was clean and fresh.  The newspaper didn't show up.  They did leave some nice chocolates for us in the room.",3,2017,04,13
44,Best hotel in barcelona,Great hotel in Barcelona. Very modern. Cool architecture. Friendly staff great spa. Nice restaurant. Very good concierge. Good location most attractions can be reached by walking. Will definitely come back. And from April on the will be a very cool rooftop terrace.,5,2017,04,09
44,Perfect Luxury Hotel for our First Visit to Barcelona,"My wife and I just returned from Barcelona to visit our son while he is abroad for the semester.  As we debated hotels and locations, given the time of year (not quite beach/pool temperatures just yet) and his apartment location next to the Cathedral of Barcelona, the Mandarin was the perfect luxury choice for us.

The location was perfect, directly located on Passeig de Gràcia, a few blocks from Las Rambla, in the heart of the high end shopping and restaurant district.  Within only a 6 block walk from the hotel, you are in the heart of the Gothic Quarter with great history and architecture, coupled with choices of boutiques, cafes, and tapas restaurants to choose from.

The hotel staff was incredibly helpful and attentive and the room was modern and quite large, given we were in a building that was once a bank.   Enjoying cocktails after a long day of walking or before dinner at Banker’s Bar was a highlight, with a fun, friendly staff, in a really cool atmosphere.

You are only a 15 minute walk to the beach area, which is pretty isolated from the rest of the city.  Even during the summer, given the location and luxury experience at this hotel, I wouldn’t consider staying anywhere else.",5,2017,04,09
44,Outstanding staff makes for a special stay,"Hotel is in a very good location, is discreet and not too big. Rooms are light and airy and well furnished and decorated although somewhat small for the price. Main restaurant for breakfast is in a lovely sunken garden with sky lights. Given the relatively small footprint of the building it does not feel cramped which is testament to the architect. 

There is a small but well appointed pool and steam room in the basement next to the spa. Also a roof terrace which unfortunately was not yet open for the season but looked lovely.

Real highlight was the staff - doormen, concierges, receptionists, waiters/waitresses, engineer and maids were all fantastic. Whilst one expects that in a hotel  in this price bracket one doesn't always get it. Thank you to all.

Certainly worth a visit but bring your wallet!",4,2017,04,09
44,"Fabulous hotel, staff, and location","Travelled to Barcelona with my sister for a 4 day visit.  This was our first time to Barcelona and this location was perfect.   It is centrally located to key sites; Old City, Waterfront, Sagrada, Park Guell, LaRambla, shopping, and dining. We walked to everything with the exception of Park Guell.  The hotel staff is exceptional.  From reception, concierge, valet, housekeeping, and dining.  The hotel staff sets this property apart from other options.  The concierge service made our visit very enjoyable.  They provided guidance on key sites, dining and help with our many questions.. Rooms are small - but that is generally true across Europe.  We did not spend much time in our room but when we did (morning with coffee and end of day) we expected more options regarding english speaking TV.  Options included CNN, BBC, and SKY news and frankly we had no desire to watch any of these - we were on vacation to get away from all the talking heads.  We decided on Spanish language Grey's Anatomy to fill the last hour of our day!!  Stay here for location and staff.",5,2017,04,07
44,Beautiful hotel ,Rooms are divine. Loved the sheets. Beautiful decor. Great staff. Car parking available. Very central location. Beautiful pool. Loved it there would love to go back. Stayed with family on way to Majorca.,5,2017,04,04
44,Great for Gaudi and shopping,"I have to qualify my quibbles about the hotel by first pointing out that the staff were fantastic in finding me a room despite the fact that I showed up without a reservation (due to previous internet issues at another hotel) on a busy Saturday.

Staff were fantastic and did a great job booking restaurants, rides to Park Guell, etc. Our room was on the first floor with Garden View. It was a bit dark and not a great view, but given the aforementioned circumstances, was perfectly fine.

The location was incredibly convenient for Gaudi and Modernisme. Casa Batlló and Puig's Casa Amatller are just down the block. Gaudi's Casa Milà is just a bit further up Passeig de Gràcia. Many high-end stores (Chanel, Burberry...) are here as well.

The spa was excellent, gym adequate. The bar also has a cool vibe.

Bar, lobby, entry (and some rooms) were designed by Patricia Uriquiola. Those areas were very cool, though I found the dining area where breakfast was served a little conventional and cold. Compared to the dining areas at either MO Tokyo or Singapore, this was somewhat underwhelming.",4,2017,04,04
44,Fabulous! Young and contemporary but elegant.,"The Mandarin Oriental is so fabulous. The design is contemporary but not stark or cold. The service is like Asian service, beyond reproach.. and the location... on the Main shopping and walking street.. 
perfection, and I am picky! ",5,2017,04,02
44,Superlative,"As always, the Mandarin Oriental group deliver first class service and accommodation at this city centre hotel. It is wonderfully placed if you wish to visit the sights (and shops) of this lovely city, although it is quite a way inland if it is the beach that draws you there.",5,2017,04,01
44,Exceptional customer attention ,"We were celebrating my husband's 40th birthday at the Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona, and as before, our experience was wonderful; with particular mention of Rafael Tapia.  As ever, he went above and beyond, exceeding expectations, providing outstanding customer care, and experience.  He is a true asset to the MO company, and they are very lucky to have him represent them. 

We will be returning!",5,2017,04,01
44,Disappointing example of the MO brand,"We left the W just to get away from that whole hectic vibe and checked in to a hotel that we felt we were able to rely on for much of what we're looking for in a hotel.  The service as expected was perfect.  Every single member of staff impressed.  Alas the problem is with the structure of the hotel unless, of course, you decide to pay full whack and go for one of the hideously expensive and extremely swanky suites.  We took a room on the 7th floor looking over the 'garden', hoping for some peace and quiet.  A garden it most certainly is not.  The view is of the backs of three sides of a square of houses, all in various shades of disrepair.  Nothing charming about them at all - no pretty roof tops, no church spires, nothing of architectural interest at all and at ground level there are a lot of scruffy gardens with one large basket ball court which seemed to be heavily used at the weekend.  

So here's the nub - since the view is poor we'd hope that the room would somehow compensate but not a bit of it.  Pokey in the extreme, it was almost impossible for us both to dress at the same time.  There is only one extremely uncomfortable armchair to sit in, another confounded bathroom split off by ill-fitting sliding glass doors, a ridiculous bath that was a design-over-comfort disaster and every wall of the entire bedroom/bathroom arrangement angled differently.  It was incredibly disappointing and NOT cheap.

We found that breakfast was delicious and the concierges were extremely helpful and when we did, with some irritation, point out that our room was still unmade at 4:00 in the afternoon, the manger did swing most apologetically into action.  

It seems that on this occasion we got our Barcelona accommodation completely wrong and to add insult to the whole thing, the roof terrace which has a very good view to the Sagrada Familia was closed until Easter.  How ridiculous.  It was beautiful weather that weekend and we would have enjoyed a drink and some quiet time up there but it was forbidden.  Our reason for picking the hotel apart from always loving the brand is that it has a swimming pool - my husband uses one every day.  Next time, tough beans - we're going for small, boutique, charming and no pool and there are dozens of these in this beautiful and intriguing city.  I have my eye on several already!",3,2017,03,30
44,Manager Branch Operations,"I was on a honeymoon trip.
Its highly recommended just to make it simple as that, the hotel location was just amazing, so clean with twice room service a day and its only 3 minutes to the down town La Ramla street, the staff were so kind, helpful and so so professional.

Special thanks goes to both staff down in the breakfast area ms Maria & Elena",5,2017,03,30
44,"Great hotel, great service,  great location, small rooms","Just spent four nights at the Mandarin Barcelona with our family of 4 including two teenagers. The hotel is fabulous, common areas are great, there is a nice terrace area to sit outside which was not officially opened yet but the hotel staff allowed us to spend time there relaxing at the end of the day. The hotel is in a perfect central  location and walking distance to everything in Barcelona, we walked everywhere. Concierges all helpful with dinner reservations, and any other questions. Great breakfast buffet in an open airy room. The only down side of this hotel is that the rooms are really VERY small. There is not adequate space to unpack thus we were living out of our suitcases for 4 days. The bathrooms are also tiny and the showers are sort of tucked in to the bathroom with no shower door, they are a part of the bathroom. There is a single sink with not a lot of counter space. Since we were barely spending time in the rooms ( we were out exploring all day) it did not impact our stay however I think it is important to note that these rooms are really tiny and particularly so for this class of hotel. If you do not like small rooms  or if you are planning a longer stay I might recommend exploring other options",5,2017,03,29
44,Incredible service!,A beautiful modern hotel at the best location possible in Barcelona. The staff was exceptional. I have never been more satisfied with a concierge staff than at this hotel. The rest of the staff  was also quite remarkable. And they make a great Martini. I will definitely stay there again  when I return to Barcelona.,5,2017,03,22
44,Excellent! ,"We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights with my fiancé. We definitely travel a lot and always stay in 5* hotels, but this time we were nicely surprised. The hotel offered us more than great travel guides that showed us around the city and nicest restaurants except Assunta Madre, there were always concierges willing to assist us, find a taxi or carry the things. Moreover, the design of spacious rooms is very nice and modern + the hotel smelled so good! We were very glad with the room service and breakfast, offering variety of fresh food and local goods. About the spa we were very happy as well, had one of the greatest massages just the ladies tried to sell us too many things probably seeing that we were having many procedures :) . The swimming pool is very suitable for swimming and exercising just we missed the jacuzzi. Thank you, we will definitely come back whenever we are in Barcelona again. ",5,2017,03,21
44,Perfect anniversary stay,"Location:  5/5
Conveniently located on the major shopping street Passeig de Garcia, I can't think of a better place as the base of my 3 day stay in Barcelona.  I was tossing between MO and W- then I thought since it's not gonna be beach season, I'd stay closer to the city.  It is within walking distance to just about all major sites: 5 mins walk to both Casa Batllo and Casa Mila, 10 mins to La Rambla and Gothic quarter,  an easy 30 min walk to La Sagrada Familia.   

First Impression: 4/5
Understated.  The main entrance blends in well with the neighboring building-one can quite easily miss the place if not looking for it.  It's sandwiched between Tiffany and Brioni.  I loved we had to cross a bridge-like walkway through the atrium to get to the main area of the hotel.  I thought they could add some water feature in the atrium but my partner thought it was perfect.

Front desk services: 5/5
The bellboys efficiently and discreetly handled out luggage on our arrival.  Check-in was simply a hoot. The girls at the front desk were a gem.  We were treated first with tea, but as soon as they found out it was our anniversary, there was free flow of bubbly.  Front desk was apologetic about not being able to give us an upgrade to a suite as part of my VIP status- I sorta gathered it as soon as I found out FC Barcelona was playing Paris SG that day-but did make sure all my other requests, including a Passeig de Gracia facing room with a balcony, are met.  We were personally escorted up to our room by one of the staff members and had a little tour of the property.

Room: 4.5/5
We stayed in a Mandarin Room facing Passeig de Gracia on the 3rd floor. I believe it was in the newly renovated wing where they host most of suites.  I loved the high ceiling and the understated luxury.  The room size was decent, not crowded at all for two grown men.  The balcony is lovely as we very often just stood there and watch the world go by. We actually could easily see Casa Batllo from our balcony!  The room was decorated in a demure/dark tone.  The bed was heavenly.  The only bone to pick is the lack of bathtub, as both my partner and I love a nice bath.  

House keeping/amenities: 5/5
I am not sure how many times they service the room a day but it seems like there was always something to surprise us every time we returned from our adventures in the city.  Hats off to the housekeeping for putting up with messy people like us.  Every time we left the room, even just to duck out for a quick walk around the block, they managed to fold and put away all our clothes nicely and bring some little treat.  There was a new bottle of bubbly every night after turndown.  After dinner on the first night, we returned to the room to find a bed adorned with a heart made of rose petals-my partner and I both thought it was over the top but loved that Hollywood moment.  Love the Acqua Di Parma amenities.

Other services 5/5
Breakfast was simply delightful @ Bistreau.  We both loved the natural light.  The pastry was to die for.  I was particularly impressed with the Mediterranean/Middle Eastern flavor of bread, dips, and stewed chicken.  
Banker's bar had the right vibes at night for us to wind down.  Love the Peruvian/Japanese fusion bar food.
Moments was simply amazing.  We had the tasting menu and my partner had matching wine.  It was truly a gastronomic trip around the world.

Overall: 5/5
It was a delightful stay and the best way to celebrate our anniversary.  I loved the attention to details and how everyone seemed genuinely happy and proud of what they were doing.  This property deserves its MO label.  My partner and I are already talking about starting a tradition of going back for our anniversary every year.",5,2017,03,20
44,Excellent place to stay,"Best choice while visiting and shopping in Barcelona. Perfect also for business trips an family escapes. Pity restaurant is not so good offering international dishes instead of local food, meanwhile many excellent places can be found just steps away. Also pity there is not  outdoor terrace swimming pool. Cocktail Bar decorate with antiques safe boxes, as Bank previously located in there is unusual but very nice. Good finger food and lar selection of beverages on that cosy and nice place.",4,2017,03,14
44,Perfect stay,"Stayed 4 nights at the Mandarin In Barcelona.  What a stay, it was perfect from the check-in process to the room to the concierge.  The room was modern, clean, and met our expectations.  Our language were delayed and the staff at the front desk went out of their way to accommodate all of our needs. Location is perfect, I would definitely stay there again. ",5,2017,03,13
44,I love the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona,"This was the third time I stayed at the MO, and it was as great as always. I stayed in the most wonderful suite in the new wing, with dreamlike views to the grand Paseo da Gracia. I had an early check in, but tthe room was not ready, so the front office agent just took me to their bistro and invited me for a drink. Lovely! After a short while, the room was a ready, and I could start enjoying. I have stayed at many 5 star hotels in Barcelona, but the MO is in a class of its own. I cant wait to go back in 2 weeks time:-) Hasta la vista!",5,2017,03,08
44,Turned to be a fan of MO in Barcelona,"I was traveling in Barcelona last November and stayed in 3 different hotels in the city. While all three hotels provided me great accommodation experiences during my stay, Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, however, was the best of the best experience I've ever experienced in my travel stories for the recent years.
The hotel is located on Passeig de Gràcia which is the most happening street in Barcelona. Other than the brand shops like Loewe, Prada, Dolice & Gabbana are in the neighborhood area, there are couple of must-go tourist spots in the walking distance, e.g. Casa Milà, Casa Batlló, etc.  There are two subway stations in this area (Passeig de Gràcia and Plaza de Catalunya) and both are within 10 min walking distance.
While I checked in at the hotel, I was well taken care of by the reception staffs and my room was upgraded from originally booked deluxe room to the junior suite which was at the 2nd floor and facing the Passeig de Gràcia.  The manager of the butler service team escorted me to my room and gave a detailed introduction of my room for me.  The junior suite was well decorated and more than being just comfortable for a solo traveller like me.  All of the welcoming presentation by the receptionists and the butlers were proper and made you feel pleasant but not pushy.
I asked the receptionist about the outdoor swimming pool which I saw the picture on the website, and learned that the pool on the rooftop was actually a shallow water not for swimming purpose, and it was not opened during the winter season (that's a bit disappointed in fact). However the hotel did have a swimming pool in the basement floor (Spa area) which was an indoor pool for swimming. I enjoyed the pool during my stay and the good thing was it was totally empty and quiet! That's very awesome.
You must not miss the 2-star Michelin winner restaurant in the MO Barcelona, Moments. I booked the lunch on MO website for myself one month before my trip and fortunately got a table.  While I was having lunch at the Moments, however, there was not too many guests during that time. However I still recommend you to make a reservation earlier before you stay in the hotel.  The menu I've experienced that day was like a journey of Around-the-World.  I don't want to reveal too many details of the meal but it could be better than the other 2-star Michelin restaurants I ever tried. The service from the staffs were proper and made you feel comfortable and the meal was great and full of surprises! Must try.
I stayed in the hotel for 4 days and turned to be a huge fan of Mandarin Oriental from that time. I would like come back next time if I visit Barcelona again and will put MO on my priority list while I travel around the world in the future. ",5,2017,03,02
44,Magical stay,"I have never written a review before but felt the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona deserved my time. The staff were so incredibly warm and friendly, they anticipated our every need to make our stay perfect. We made the mistake of spending our last two nights at Hotel Arts, what a mistake! The Mandarin is an unbeatable experience ,money well spent. ",5,2017,02,26
44,"Eager to Return -- Excellent Location, Staff & Restaurants","Located in the heart of beautiful Barcelona on the elegant Passeig de Gracia, the hotel features excellent staff and restaurants.  Formerly a bank building, the hotel has the subtle, elegant and light design one expects of a Mandarin property.

The restaurants are excellent. I especially enjoyed Moments,  a Michelin star recipient, which features excellent seasonal and and local Catalan cuisine.  Also excellent is Blanc, a bright and cheerful Mediterranean brasserie with an all-day menu.  Banker’s Bar is a comfortable cocktail lounge with an outdoor area for those wishing to smoke.

The hotel is comfortably close to the Gothic Quarter, Las Ramblas, and Gaudi's Casa Milà (“La Pedrera”) and Casa Batlló. Many of Barcelona’s museums, churches and parks are located near the hotel as well. I had a pleasant walk to the Barcelona Cathedral (Catedral de la Santa Creu). I took a short cab ride to Sagrada Familia. The hotel is located in a fashionable shopping district featuring luxe brands. 

In short, this is a beautiful and elegant hotel staffed by the excellent team one trusts to find in a Mandarin. Bravo!",5,2017,02,24
44,Barcelona's most expensive hotel right in the heart of the city,"The Mandarin is located right in the centre of Barcelona, on the famous Paseig de Gracia, an avenue filled with designer stores and the regular high street retailers, plus within the same street you can find a few of Gaudi's famous buildings.
It's a very vibrant area with lots of restaurant choices and great places to go for drinks.",5,2017,02,22
44,Amazing hotel and great location!!!,All I can say is WOW.  We stayed here for two nights before setting sail for a Mediterranean cruise.  This hotel is extremely posh and very high end.  I loved staying here and it is worth every penny!!! You won't be disappointed.  The rooms are a good size for Europe and the scent in the hallway is so lovely (you will know what I mean when your there).,5,2017,02,20
44,Expensive but Fantastic,The hotel and staff are outstanding.  The concierge group can get anything done--among the best I've ever encountered.  The hotel itself is in perfect condition and the location is great.  It is expensive but worth it.,5,2017,02,19
44,Expectations exceeded in Barcelona,"Great hotel, impeccable service, excellent food
perfect location right in the centre of the town, but no noise was felt from the streets. Gaudis work/ a must see
the concierge will give you the best tips

44,A worthy stay for the 20th anniversary and st valentine ,"My wife and I choose to do our 20th wedding anniversary trip through Spain and mark our highlight stay in Barcelona at the mandarin 

The hotel is pretty nice and central, great room, spa, location 

But what stands out is the excellent service attitude from the porter welcoming you in to the concierge helping you out with all your queries and requests 

They have been truly helpful in every way to make our stay magical and memorable for that I thank you and I wouldn't choose any other hotel to stay at in Barcelona. ",5,2017,02,18
44,First night and day one,"Bankers bar is fantastic!!! Breakfast is amazing, and the staff is extremely professional and welcoming. However, the spa and pool were a bit disappointing. I think it was a bit rushed because we had 7 pm appointments.Our ""upgraded"" room is a bit shop worn and no bath tub. Again, can't say enough good things about how nice the staff is yet we remain confused about tipping.",4,2017,02,16
44,We will come back ,"Stayed in a junior suite with our two boys in one also.  Plenty of space.  This hotel is fantastic.  Great location.  You can walk most places.  But what makes this hotel one of the best we have stayed at is the quality of the staff.  Attentive, no request ignored and a real interest in your happiness and wellbeing. Nothing and I mean nothing is too much trouble. ",5,2017,02,13
44,"Wonderful hotel, location and staff",A trully 5  star hotel. Excellent staff and service. Great location and beside services. All staff with smile . Especially     Albertino. A wonder staff when you was enetering the Hotel and leaving it.  Surely Would be back.,5,2017,02,11
44,I was WRONG! This place is EXCELLENT!!,"I first stayed at the Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona on the first leg of a recent trip. After arriving tired and jet lagged, I went to my first room which was smaller than I usually like. The size issue was but due to poor planning in by behalf. 

In addition to the room size, there were a few technical issues and I ended up publishing a brutal review. 

On the final leg of the same trip, I returned to the Mandarin,.....this time in a much bigger room,....a suite actually,.....and I was blown away! 

Superb service and quality all the way around. The location of this hotel is incredible and I highly recommend you stay here when in Barcelona. 

I've stayed at some of the finest hotels in the world and this one ranks right up there as one of the best. 

Great hotel!!!!!!",5,2017,02,08
44,Pure luxury in the heart of Barcelona,"Our 3 night stay at the Mandarin was wonderful. Location is perfect. Right in the middle of Passeig de Gracia close to all the shopping you could ever want to do. Think of Champ Elysees in Paris. 
Being that it was my first time with the brand, I was overall impressed and look forward to staying at other properties in the future. We were greeted at the Port by our chauffeur and he was amazing and gave us wonderful tips and suggestions. (I forgot his name but he was a British guy)
Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by friendly staff and warm smiles. Check-in was quick and easy and they escorted us up to our room and gave us a tour. 
The room was in their newer wing and was beautiful and nicely decorated with modern finishes. It was huge by normal room standards. Everything was large actually: the room, the bathroom, and the massive closet. There was also a balcony which over looked Passeig de Gracia which was nice. Bathroom amenities were by Acqua de Parma and smelled great. 
Breakfast in the restaurant downstairs were great also. There were many choices and the staff were quick and eager to serve. Nights in the rooftop terrace by the pool was a nice sight, especially as the sun was setting.
Overall, our stay was great and left a positive mark for the brand. We hope to be back soon and stay at other properties.",5,2017,02,06
44,Fantastic Location and Service,"We regularly visit Barcelona and have stayed in a number of very nice hotels but this recent weekends visit topped them all. The service was outstanding with not a detail missed by the always pleasant and helpful staff who went out of their way to try and accommodate even the simplest of requests. The location is a significant plus being in the heart of Passeig de Gracia and within walking distance to most things. 

While certainly not cheap, prices are within reason compared to other luxury hotels but the location and service may be the best of them all in Barcelona.",5,2017,02,04
44,Not enough value for the price,"Dated furniture in the room and not set up for working out of the room.  Complicated and old TV remote. Over price hotel, but in good location. I feel there are better choices in the area for the money. First and last time at this hotel.",2,2017,02,03
44,Perfect Experience,"Never have I had a hotel experience that was as perfect as this one. Firstly, the location was within walking distance of all our weekend plans. The staff was most welcoming and always willing to help. And the facilities of the hotel are just spot-on: the comfort of the rooms and beds, the quality of breakfast and lunch, the indoor pool and spa, and even the scent (!) in the hotel - just a completely perfect experience. Can and will recommend this to anyone!",5,2017,01,31
44,Excellent service,"Our hotel choice for our honeymoon was perfect. We had excellet service the whole time at the Madarin, icluding a special detail for our honeymoon. The locatio was unbeatable in the heart of the city without beig too downtown. Made our honeymoon extra romantic and special!",5,2017,01,24
44,We left a coat - they went out of their way to send it back to us swiftly!,"I really liked our room - it had a lovely terrace and was very efficiently designed with a sitting area and semi separate bedroom. The hotel is beautiful and the restaurant was very good! The bar was a bit slow and they comped my drink because of it. The service was excellent and after leaving a coat in the room, with NO TROUBLE AT ALL it was sent back to us in the US.  This hotel is the place to stay if you want to be in the middle of the action in Barca.",5,2017,01,16
44,The Best Service,"I was planning to visit Barcelona since many years ago, but did not have the chance until now. I always thought about Mandarin Oriental due to his excellent service and comments from friends and other guests who previously stayed at this property. Now I can really say the choice was just right!

The Mandarin Oriental Barcelona concierge service is spectacular. In particular, Mr. Ricard Margalef went out of his way to provide fantastic restaurant recommendations, make bookings, change appointments, etc., over my one week stay at the hotel. I had my own suggestions for restaurant reservations and he made them for me, but also made recommendations for when my choices were not taking reservations. All were great finds; no disappointments.

The hotel room itself was well appointed, and designed in a way that travelers appreciate. The location is just superb! on the main shopping district, within walking distance to Casa Balltó and Milá (bith worth visiting), and short taxi ride to Gaudi´s church and Rambla street.

This was my first visit to Barcelona and I would return to this hotel again.",5,2017,01,11
44,Absolute delight - Truly a 5 star hotel with 6 star service,"This wonderfully positioned and quality hotel was a highlight of our 6 week holiday. The garden rooms were very large and beautifully finished. Combined with a fantastic modern large bathroom this hotel truly lives up to it's 5 star rating. The staff were so welcoming from the curb-side doorman, to the friendly check in desk and the incredible concierge team. This hotel was a delight to stay in and we truly felt that nothing was too much trouble. We would not consider another hotel in Barcelona",5,2017,01,09
44,The perfect stay,"Third time in Barcelona, first time at the Mandarin Oriental. Great location, beautiful hotel, and the staff is simply amazing. A level of service and friendliness I have only found in Japan so far. Will definitely return to Barcelona and the Mandarin Oriental!",5,2017,01,09
44,Posh Location. Luxurious. Nice small pool. Convenient. Deluxe Garden Room Review.,"We booked a deluxe garden room at a corporate rate over the Christmas holidays. The room itself was a strange shape - long narrow hallway with closets on one side, enough room for a king bed and a chair. As with any of these fancy hotels, the bathrooms have limited privacy. You have sliding doors that are part transparent. But overall, the furnishing was of 5-star quality. Fast internet, plenty of power points, good toiletries and amenity kits. Good housekeeping and turndown service. 
The view from the garden room was of this strange courtyard with surrounding neighboring buildings that looked decidedly un-posh. 
So, the room and view aside. The location is great for transit. It is good for upscale shopping. The hop on hop off bus has a stop right in front of the hotel. There's a taxi stand right in front of the hotel. The Passeig De Gracia metro stop is 2 short blocks away. So it is very very convenient. But it is not right in the middle of lots of good restaurants. We were travelling with a child so there was nothing within a short walk that was good. There is a McDonald's on the next block that you might want to try for breakfast (opens at 7am) in case you want to skip the pricey hotel breakfast. 
The hotel's spa has a small pool - it is a decent space. You need to be escorted in - can't just use your room key. Cute little pool that's really warm - perfect for the winter. There's also an attached steam room. Strangely - no toiletries in the showers down here. There's a supermarket on the street behind the hotel if you want to buy any essentials. The business center is a joke - one PC with a computer that you are escorted into.
Stay here if you get a good deal, if you like the luxury location. Despite the 4/5 review I would personally rather stay here again and take cabs/metros rather than stay in La Rambla/Plaza Catalunya. Seemed too busy and crowded there, this is quieter.  And if you don't have kids you can just walk there.
Overall - excellent luxury location.",4,2017,01,06
44,Understated charm,"Stay here if you like truly attentive service.  The rooms are open-plan and modern; a much more expensive version of other comparable (and, frankly, much less costly) boutique hotel rooms in Barcelona.  But the service quality and location set this hotel apart.",5,2017,01,05
44,"Great location, very relaxing","We had a small, but well appointed and beautiful garden room at the Mandarin Oriental.  Very comfortable, clean and quiet.  Modern bathroom with shower and bath tub.  Rainhead in shower had excellent water pressure.  Heated bathroom floor - which was a wonderful touch in December!  We were on the 7th floor, and had a great view over an interior courtyard/garden area for the block.  The hotel itself is in an amazing location - everything that we wanted to visit was within easy walking distance.  The Barcelona Bus Touristic also has stops directly outside of the hotel's front door.  Restaurants within the hotel were great, and the most amazing tapas restaurant (Tapas 24) is right around the corner.  My husband enjoyed the pool and spa.  Hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  My only negative was that there was not a coffee machine (such as Nespresso) in the room to get me going each morning.",5,2017,01,04
44,unbelievable,"a wonderful experience, a truly great hotel with all the bells & whistles that you would expect from a hotel of this class. The location is great so that you can explore the city on foot, the staff are fantastic and very professional",5,2017,01,04
44,Fabulous,"We have stayed at this hotel for a week and must say it has been wonderful. Very comfortable rooms and excellent attention. Greetings from Manhattan and thanks.
Next year we will return.
Happy new year

",5,2017,01,02
44,Wonderful Location with Attentive Staff,"Stayed in December with our older children.  The location is perfect for exploring Barcelona by foot, walking distance to museums, cathedrals and plenty of shopping and restaurants.  Although located on a busy boulevard, the hotel is smaller and quiet and a nice respite as soon as you get off the street.  Easy access to metro also.  

Rooms are decent size, very modern and comfortable.  Being a smaller hotel, we found the staff very helpful and attentive, especially the concierge staff.  Sebastian was particularly helpful on numerous occasions with directions, suggestions and recommendations.  Breakfast buffet was top notch.  

Would highly recommend the hotel.  My only complaint is the fragrance they pump into the halls and public areas was a bit strong and overwhelming, but other than that, a very enjoyable vacation stay for touring Barcelona.",5,2017,01,01
44,"Great area, perfect for our stay.","It was my birthday, and on this trip we only had 1 night to rest in-between flights so we choose to do it at the Mandarin Oriental BCN.  It was the perfert choice.  We flew in from Canada and arrived very early in the morning, when we arrived to the hotel they didn't have a room for us yet BUT offered us to relax in the breakfast room and offered us a complimentary beakfast while we waited.  It was delux and delicious.  All the details you would expect from a 5 star hotel with extra spanish touches...by the time we finish eating our room was ready.  We opted from the least expensive room which was around 600 CND dollars for the night, it wasn't a big room but it was comfortable.  The bed was perfect for us, and the bathroom was large, modern and chic.
After a nap, we spend the afternoon in the spa, it was raining out and we were exhausted from the trip.  The Spa is VERY VERY nice.  We loved every minute of it, the massage / facial experience was spot on.  One of the best I've ever had. highly recommended. 

The concierge was kind enough to sort out dinner reservations at a very cool, old world restaurant that felt trendy and cool, good price with great food.  

It was the perfect birthday in a very special hotel.

Thank you Mandarin Oriental for the magical experience.",5,2016,12,28
44,3 Stars - absolutely ,"We celebrated the 88 birthday of my father and were treated like in heaven. The Chef Carme Ruscalleda is well known by her other top restaurants and she has earned a total of 7 Michelin stars. Hence high were our expectations. 
We selected the gastronomic menu ""the trip"" and received creative dishes from 14 countries worldwide in which Mandarin Oriental has hotels... very original and nevertheless very tasty. A ""round"" experience documented in a specifically designed passport!
The service team was exceptional, it seemed they only took care of us despite all tables being occupied. 
Recommendation: visit the bank bar afterwards for the coffee and a cocktail- another wow-experience. 
Thank you for this unforgettable dinner. Gracias. ",5,2016,12,27
44,"Excellent stay overall, but short of a few 5-star hotel ","The service at the Mandarin oriental is  impeccable as usual, and Mandarin oriental Barcelona was no differ. We were treated like VIPs throughout our 3 day stay there. It is only around 10 minutes walk from La Rambla and Hard Rock Cafe Barcelona and there are quite many cafés and high end shops beside it, including Tiffany's. 

We chose a garden view room and were located on the 5th floor. The view wasn't anything spectacular to be honest as beside us were some private apartments which looked slightly run down, but the balcony in the rooms was a nice touch nonetheless. The room was quite nice and spacious, and it was really fantastic that we they placed a large edible chocolate Xmas ball and a delicious panatone (as it was over the Christmas period) in our room. It was a lovely touch coming back to such treats in the room. 

I suppose our biggest issue was the fact that the WiFi wasn't free. It's really strange for this day and age, for a 5-star establishment not to have this included in the price of the room. You need to pay 15 Euros for 24 hours WiFi access. The only free WiFi was at the public areas of the hotel.
 I get it that the hotel wanted a minimalist look and design, but I felt that there were some practical things missing from the room, such as places to hang towels and bathrobes. There was a large, lighted wardrobe in the room but I don't think it was suitable to put such wet items in there. The toilet paper dispenser was also not the most user friendly, and the shower - was designed in a way that every time you  used the ""rain shower"" it would wet the entire floor outside, unless you use the hand held shower (as there was no door) and even if you were careful it still made outside area wet. 

Other that this, we thought the pool area and steam room were great and the massage service was excellent. We definitely had a good time at the hotel (as its so conveniently located) but I do think in comparison to some other 5-star hotels in Europe, this hotel is slightly overpriced. ",4,2016,12,27

The hotel is well located, in a very nice area of the city and greatly managed. We had a very nice room, with a beautiful view over the Casa Battlo.

44,Almost perfect,"What a fantastic stay. Hotel in a great location and staff were amazing. Couple of issues with our room , quite small and at this price would expect a bath tub. However the staff are what really make the hotel . From check in to check out and every interaction between we were treated as valued guests. Bankers bar was amazing with an outdoor heated area for cigars etc. Will definitely return here if we come back to Barcelona . ",4,2016,12,09
44,Gem of a Hotel,"I have recently returned from a 3. Ishtar trip to Barcelona, my first time in the city and WOW what a city. As a seasoned traveller I have a certain criteria: location, style and service and this hotel delivers in abundance. 
It truly has the Wow Factor from the moment you walk through the door you are treated like a VIP, the check in was quick and exceptionally efficient despite arriving prior to the usual check in time.
The rooms are exceptionally well appointed large rooms with great views, modern clean, chic bathrooms and tastefully decorated rooms, good Wifi connectivity throughout the hotel is a real bonus.

On site dining facilities are vast with even the fussiest of esters I am sure catered for.

Location is great, strong transport links to get you around this fantastic city.

Highly recommended. Would definitely return ",5,2016,12,07
44,Best in the city!,"We stayed with our 8-month old daughter and friends. The hotel in a great location, enjoyed the buffet breakfast. The service was superb and staff were friendly. The room is decent size and cozy. We will definitely go back.",4,2016,12,06
44,"Amazing stay here, super service","Super beautiful hotel with an amazing staff. Took the time to go the extra mile with a smile - they brought me my omelette - from an awesome breakfast buffet but didn't get made in time for the bus call - to me on the bus, with silverware and cloth napkins. Really amazing place and highest marks.",5,2016,12,06
44,Best Hotel in the City,"I stayed here for two nights and there is not a single complaint about the entire experience. Fantastic service all round, the food and drinks were wonderful. The rooms are great in design and still feel cosy and comfortable. The rooms even come with hair straighteners. Buffet breakfast is a great variety and delicious plus Bankers Bar has a great ambience and drinks menu. I got to experience the Michelin starred Moments restaurant which was mind-blowing in all respects. If you want to experience the finest in the city, then this would be it. ",5,2016,12,06
44,Outstanding service,"This was my first visit to a Mandarin Oriental hotel and I have to say it was a great experience. The hotel was interesting in its design , well located , well appointed but what really made this hotel was the standard of service . No one person stood out ...ALL of the staff I came across were personable , charming and very professional . Congratulations to you all it was a pleasure to stay with you.",5,2016,12,02
44,Happy birthday to me,"I Like all the Mandarins and I am a real ""fan."" As usual it was excellent.
When in Barcelona, I would not stay any where else. Returning this time was just like coming home.
It was my birthday and it made for a fabulous celebration.",5,2016,12,01
44,Amazing hotel experience!,Stayed for two nights and it is really all you expect from the hotel but what really stood out was the excellent service and friendly staff! Would definitely recommend to those wanting a little splurge,5,2016,11,29
44,Outstanding Service,"Lovely hotel and staff anticipated all needs.  Warm welcome, great service, food is delicious.  From the time we arrived to our departure, we felt spoiled.  We had a garden view room and would try a different room view as the view is of apartments and a schoolyard.  ",5,2016,11,28
44,"Lovely hotel, lovely room and lovely staff","My daughter and myself went on a quick break to Barcelona for a Justin Bieber concert. We stayed at Mandarin Oriental Barcelona and we found the hotel is a second to none.  Guillem (Porter) was always smily and kind. Carlos (Concierge) helped us to get connected to the wifi very efficiently, Elena (Reception) checked us in very professionally and scorted us to our room. It was a shame that the terrace at the top of the building was closed due to the bad weather. Breakfast was sublime and the staff again kind and very polite. Strongly recommendable for those visiting the second largest city in Spain. Great location, city centre, near everywhere",5,2016,11,25
44,"Terrific, professional staff. We've been WELL taken care of.","Mandarin Oriental isn't cheap, but we definitely value for our money! Location, rooms, spa, all was excellent, but moreover it's the staff that made the difference. They were all so pleasant and professional, I think I've never encountered service in such standard. Superb experience. Huge Gracias guys!",5,2016,11,23
44,Fab hotel,Absolutely fantastic hotel. The quietest room I have ever stayed in. Fabulous food and amazing staff. Location was perfect too as this was our first visit. Fabulous attention to detail too. Can't wait to go back. ,5,2016,11,23
44,Exceptional staff,"We stayed here for 3 nights, the hotel is in a very good position in the city and it is a very nice hotel, our room was quite small and maybe a little tired. The massive plus point for this hotel are the staff, they are simply fantastic, nothing is too much trouble, they are all consistently helpful and go the extra mile. We ate in the bistro and the food was delicious. We had a couples massage which was excellent.  Th roof terrace was closed due to the summer season being over which was disappointing as it was warm enough to sit up there but there  was no furniture out. Lovely view from the roof terrace across the rooftops of the city ",5,2016,11,23
44,Never encountered better service!,"I didn't know what service was until I stayed at the Mandarin Barcelona! Everything about the hotel was wonderful: the decor, the design, the architecture, the restaurant, the bar, but above all, the service. I was blown away. I have many anecdotes I could tell but to recount just one: I mentioned in passing to the concierge that I was going for a run the next morning. When I got back from dinner, the staff had left three protein bars and a bottle of water and a note wishing me an enjoyable run. Everyone at the hotel calls you by name. In the morning, my 7am wake-up call came with a cappuccino. The staff really made me feel at home! The hotel is not cheap but it is worth every penny!",5,2016,11,22
44,Exceptional,"I have to say, The service is fantastic! All the staff are nice, smilly, specially when my husband was taking the huge luggage and walking in the lobby, a lady with high heel ( I think she is the manager) ran to him and try to help him... Breakfast was good, roof top is great! Bed is comfortable as well. Location is great! We could visit lots of the top visit spot by walking.",5,2016,11,18
44,Business meeting ,It is an incredible cozy place!! It is extremely nice inside and the service is fantastic. Located in the Main Street of barcelona for shopping!! I totally recommend this hotel for a weekend plan with your wife or girlfriend.   ,5,2016,11,17
44,WONDERFUL TIME AT MANDARIN BARCELONA,Excellent Hotel. High level of the services. Very qualified Employees. Perfect location. Highlight to the Restaurants in Mandarin Hotel. Other highlight is the internal heated swimming pool. Allow us an exceptional stay.,5,2016,11,15
44,The Best,"We checked into the hotel, on November 6 at 7:00 AM. amazingly the staff was marvelous. No waiting and registration was quick and competent. The room was spotless and the bellman explained all the features. THE CONCIERGE staff was excellent. The restaurant, MOMENTS, a two Michelin star restaurant, lived up to that level. The bar was friendly. The General Manager of the hotel was always overseeing the operation. He was friendly and extremely warm. He advised us throughout our stay. The stay was memorable.",5,2016,11,15
44,Delightful stay,"Thank you to the whole team at Mandarin Barcelona for an excellent stay. I would especially like to thank David, Anna, Frederico, Juan (Front Office) and Nuria (Spa) for their hospitality and professional service. I look forward to returning as soon as possible.",5,2016,11,13
44,Smile,"This hotel put a smile on our faces.  We were upgraded several categories on arrival and loved our room.  The front desk was very accommodating, the breakfast and dinners were first rate, and the concierges were very helpful.  The location is perfect, and the staff always went out of their way to make sure we were cared for.  Will stay here again the next time we are in Barcelona. ",5,2016,11,12
44,Best in the city,"I spent a weekend with my partner and had a deluxe room with balcony over the inner court. The room was beautifully decorated and was calm and peaceful. toiletries are excellent. 

from the check in time my name was remembered throughout the whole stay. WOW. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet in the morning which was delicious and plenty of choice. I recommend the Spanish Jamon! Top Noch. 

In the evening we had a drink a Banker's before dinner. The staff was very friendly and drinks were superb. Try their gin and tonic they are great.

Overall we had a dream stay and the mandarin.

Top 3 features: 

service
location 
food 

Thank you to all the staff, we will be back for sure",5,2016,11,07
44,Pretty well,"Can't say enough about the people at this property! Exceptional in every aspect from Doorman to the waitress in the Banker's Bar. The rooms are pricey and smallish, but you are in a EU city. It's kind of expected.  
Love this place and will be back to this and other Mandarin Oriental properties.",5,2016,11,05
44,Best location and value.,One of the most delightful hotels ever. Fantastic location. Warm and welcoming staff. I'll stay there always. Very talented and helpful concierges. Strongly recommend the Bankers Bar for after dinner drinks. ,5,2016,11,03
44,Wonderful Stay,"My wife, daughter and I stayed in two adjoining Garden View rooms for four nights;  someone used the term ""quiet oasis"" and that description is very apt; from bustling Passeig de Gracia, one enters the Mandarin via a surprisingly steep ramp (sort of like a rising model walkway) into the very contemporary entry way; service was exemplary, the hotel rooms (though not large) comfortable, elegant and well maintained.   We found the view over the back (into the back courtyards of neighboring apartment buildings as well as a school playground) very pleasant, indeed much more relaxing than the front street views.    Most convenient location.  Very satisfying breakfast buffets.  Most important, a comfortable bed is one of the absolute requirements for a happy stay; the Mandarin did not disappoint in this regard!",5,2016,11,03
44,Customer oriented luxury hotel,"Wonderful hotel , friendly staff, They can sens your needs and acts rather quickly. Room service is the fastest I ever encountered before. Definitely would stay in again if I ever have the chance. Value for money ",5,2016,11,02
44,"Fantatstic , relaxing stay in a wonderful hotel","Stayed in the best hotel room we have ever stayed in. Relaxing atmosphere , good food , excellent staff. Relaxed on the roof top bar. Superb Sunday Brunch. Brilliant room service. breakfast is very good , something for everyone. Great spa.",5,2016,11,01
44,Another oasis of calm,"Spent two nights at the Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona at the end of October. Having stayed in MOs before there are some things that I now expect as a given - top notch service, comfortable rooms, a stay-all-evening bar. This one excelled in all those areas, particularly the service, which was faultless. My father and I spent one afternoon in the Moments restaurant which is amongst the best restaurants I have ever eaten in. Michelin starred food can be hit or miss. Not here, superb from start to finish. The fitness suite was well equipped albeit underground and my father used the spa and had a great massage. Location is perfect for exploring. It's not cheap, but you get what you pay for. The view from the rooftop bar was tremendous, a perfect place to take the last Aperol Spritz of the summer.",5,2016,10,31
44,I'm a fan,"The Mandarin Oriental is by far the best hotel I have stayed. I've stayed in hotels with butler service and the staff of the MO Barcelona surpass all previous experiences. The staff is sincerely kind, pleasant and attentive , eager to please and help. We needed a room change due to noise. The staff was very eager to help and make up for the inconvenience. The accommodations are superb! I love everything about this hotel. We ate at Moments and loved all 4  hours of our meal. It is worth 3 Michelin stars! Cannot say enough good things! ",5,2016,10,31
44,MOBCN,It was perfect wonderful 3 nights stay in Barcelona at Mandarin Oriental. The Suite #701 was really comfortable and amazing interior design and view of Passeo de Gracia. The concierge and butler services were very efficient and polite. ,5,2016,10,31
44,Impeccable views and food from the rooftop tapas restaurant!,"This restaurant was so amazing, we came back the next day! Be sure to have sun downer drinks at the rooftop bar and have dinner from the tapas restaurant! Delicious food and unmatched views of Barcelona! There's always a pool on the rooftop, but it's small and narrow. If you're in hopes for a large pool, this isn't it. Perfect for sun bathing, although you have to be early with getting a reservation as there are only 8 or so chairs available.",4,2016,10,31
44,Excellent ,"Beautiful, new and modern hotel centrally located on the main shopping street in Barcelona. Excellent service by all staff from the bell man to the managers. Rooms are a bit small but I guess that would be the case in all Europe. Small but well equipped gym. Bottom line; if you can afford it then this is the place to stay in Barcelona. ",5,2016,10,24
44,Great Location!,We spent five nights at the Mandarin after our Seabourn cruise through the Western Med. The hotel was nice and room was fine. Location is great as you are close to everything and quite a few Gaudi buildings. The Passeig de Gracia is in the middle of everything and you can walk to old town or up to Park Guell.,4,2016,10,23
44,Luxury hotel with warm service,"Warm and welcoming staff. For breakfast chef made us personalized baklava.

Service was great and concierge offered good suggestions. 

Trendy looking hotel.

Nice spa

Michelin star restaurants which was quite good. Interesting journey around the world.

",5,2016,10,22
44,Best hotel in Barcelona,"The Mandarin Oriental is the best hotel in Barcelona!  Great location on Passeig de Gracia where all of the great shopping, restaurants and some Gaudi buildings are located.  We were fortunate to receive a substantial upgrade to a suite which was incredible.  The staff are all amazing and friendly and will help you with reservations for everything...including the FC Barcelona game we attended.  It was an incredible trip to Barcelona and we will definitely stay at the Mandarin Oriental on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2016,10,22
44,Excellent service,"This hotel is rating your satisfaction to the maximum, every member off staff is involved to give you the best experience possible.
The location in Barcelona is perfect for shopping and site seeing. Although you're in a busy part off town, the hotel is very quiet.",5,2016,10,21
44,Perfect Suite Experience,This suite was incredible...service impeccable  and food was exquisite  I loved the safety and ability to enter the floor only by the keycard.... the complimentary cheeses and wine in the room was a very nice added taste...Very impressed with the welcome card also....Thank you to all the staff...,5,2016,10,19
44,Nice and wonderful stay,"Everything was very good. They even had a water spray in the toilet for the muslims and people who are hygiene concern.

Location is city center. Walking distance from la ramblas and catalunya. Many nice restaurants near the hotel. Also supermarkets are near by. ",5,2016,10,19
44,Great stay on Passeig de Gracia,"Beautiful hotel, in a great area of Barcelona. The hotel sits about a block from Casa Battlo, one of Gaudi's wonders. Lots of great high end shopping around the hotel. Safe to walk around at night. Close to great Tapas. Stayed here for three nights. Lives up to MO standards. Food was excellent. Great breakfast buffet which was included with our stay through AMEX FHR. We ended up getting a room upgrade to a suite via the program. 

The good: rooms beautiful, clean, housekeeping responded promptly. Staff all very pleasant. Beautiful rooftop terrace with good drinks, and fresh ceviche 

The bad: We had ""butler service"" but didn't really utilize this. We have had this at previous hotels and our butler was always checking in on us. We didn't see much of her. Not that we needed things, just thought perhaps there would be more checking in, help with airport transfer, etc. maybe we should have been more assertive. Also, with the late nightlife in Barcelona, we wished the hotel bar was open a bit later than 1AM as many of the clubs are open past 3AM. No room service other than breakfast ",4,2016,10,18
44,Only spent one night,"House of mirrors, I say that because we were all very confused as to how to open doors, use the shower, use the elevator, we laughed about it as we shared our stories. We also spent most of the day in the spa and had a wonderful experience",4,2016,10,18
44,Best in class,"The Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is by far one of the best hotels ever experienced. We went there for an anniversary trip and the staff went out of their way to accommodate us, we were even greated by the GM upon on arrival and departure. The hotel has a true soul by its associates making every guest feel very special. We will return and recommend to friends. ",5,2016,10,14
44,Simply the best,"It was the second time in MO Barcelona, we have loved every minute of it. The rooms are very well designed, also very well though for ease of use. The staff goes above and beyond for you. They are genuinely caring, kind and very professional. We had the best stay ever. Thank you very much! ",5,2016,10,14
44,No better hotel in the world!,"I stayed at The Mandarin for three days this month and it is a WONDERFUL hotel with the world's best, most helpful and friendliest staff.  From top to bottom, everyone there is great.  What a terrific staff.  Management picks great people and obviously inculcates service, service, service in their minds and they deliver--from the concierges who are great, to the reception to the people you meet in the halls--everyone is nice.  It isn't cheap, but you can afford it, you will be happy. A new category of rating is required for this place- six stars! It is also very conveniently located a block form Gaudi's Casa Batllo and is in the best part of town.",5,2016,10,12
44,Awsome!,"This Hotel is not a surprise, it is one of the Mandarins :)
No hotel in Barcelona would enjoy this gorgeous location. You are in the middle of Barcelona, and near to everywhere, thanks to the concierge. The service is at the top of this world. The suites are excellent.",5,2016,10,11
44,Well Satisfied Wıth our Stay,Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona is excellent hotel with modern facilities in the centre of the city. The staff were very welcoming and helpful from the start of check in until the final check out. We used its restaurants and were pleased of the quality of the service. Rooms were comfortable and clean. The hotel was placed in the heart of the shopping district which enables you to do shopping of major luxury brands. Also the hotel is well situated near the old city. You can see the historical places in the old city by walking 10-15 minutes. Also it is easy to walk to Las Ramblas. Overall it was a very pleasent stay in Mandarin Oriental.,5,2016,10,11
44,"Cozy bar, but small","Went the have a lunch. Place is very cozy and the location is nice, view as well. Food is good quality.
 Cons are that it is quite small, in hot season it may be too crowded. There are only 7 places near the pool and it is very small, thought in photos it looks much bigger.
",5,2016,10,11
44,Lovely rooms in a boutique style hotel,"Very trendy hotel - wonderful rooms (get the room with the balcony 515 as it had a larger bathroom - our  travel mates complained that there rooms had no bathtub and where smaller).

Very nice (small) pool at the top of the hotel which becomes a bar at night,",5,2016,10,10
44,Accomodation,"Perfectm I like everything in the Hotel & Room.
The Recepection is perfetct and Restaurantes too.
The Service is perfect and Restaurante offering the best Food.
I will come back again at Mandarin Barcelona.",5,2016,10,09
44,Excellence!,"From the moment of arrival until departure, staff were excellent as was the service and standards. I was there for 3 days on business but completely relaxed. At breakfast, after the first morning, I was referred to by name, asked if I wanted my regular seat (on only second morning) and my preferences were noted (capuccino and orange juice ?). Fruit bowls in the room with large cherries to die for: sweet. The concierge was excellent too, booking for us even when we gave him a location of a restaurant but didn't know the name. Will definitely return",5,2016,10,08
44,very good in every way,"The Peruvian food at Terrat was wonderful. There was everything that you could want on offer for breakfast. The staff and service were faultless and always with a smile. The food and beverage manager, Hector, was always around checking that guests were happy. Our room was plain but functional and we had a little balcony which we used. Great location, I would stay here again.",5,2016,10,06
44,Beatiful hotel. Brilliant service,Overall excellent. Location is perfect. Bars are wonderful. Staff is outstanding. Right i. The very heart of Barcelona. This hotel is a rare gem in total five star luxury. Walking distance to every major Barcelona landmark. ,5,2016,10,04
44,"Serene, ideally located and amazing service","The hotel is located right on Passeig de gracia next to all the high end shopping and local shopping. It is ideal for a shopping holiday. Also with a few minutes you can reach all of Gaudi's architectural gems, most are a stone's throw away from the hotel. The hotel is amazing. The gym is great and the indoor swimming pool with the steam room s a delight.  I had a medical emergency in the family and had to check out a day early and Juan at the front desk was very accommodating in not charging the cancellation fee, which I was very grateful for. The breakfast was amazing, fruits, eggs the way you want, juices, cheese, you name it and it was part of the buffet. Really enjoyed the breakfast. I would be back to this hotel. It is a great find. Mandarin Oriental always is.",5,2016,10,04
44,Excellent Service,"Perfect choice for Barcelona.  The hotel is in a central location, right near multiple attractions including two Gaudi homes.   Breakfast was excellent, service throughout the hotel was outstanding and the rooms are modern and clean.  The most stealth housekeeping staff ever...you never see them but they keep the rooms extremely tidy and spotless. We stayed in a deluxe boulevard room which was ample in space with a view over the Passeig de Gràcia. Special thanks to Roberto on the roof terrace, Jordi at the Mimosa Bar and Alberto out front, for making our stay extra special by providing us outstanding service, and friendship.  It's employees like this that keep guests coming back.   Thanks for a wonderful stay !",5,2016,09,29
44,Smashing hotel ,"This hotel group does not disappoint 
Supreme location impeccable service and being in the lap of luxury 
For this hotel in particular very close to two of Gaudi's attractions.Just super restaurants nearby 
Also for those that stay here this used to be a bank the outdoor facade is very cool 
And where breakfast is served used to be the vault 
Enjoy be a fan ",5,2016,09,27
44,great modern hotel and top location,Great hotel in the center of Barcelona in typical MO feel.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.  Restaurant serves excellent food.  The hotel is located in the best part of town and there are may things to visit by foot.,4,2016,09,25
44,Stunning!  A gem of a hotel,"This gorgeous hotel is worth a visit even if you are not staying there.  The drinks at the bar are lovely, and in a truly stylish and chic setting, a perfect reflection of the tony neighborhood that the hotel is in.  Dress up, feel beautiful and surround yourself with serene, chic, luxury!",5,2016,09,25
44,Best Location,The Mandarin Oriental is close to everything. And the staff is fantastic. Very helpful. Albert deserves accolades for his great personality and attentiveness. I highly recommend this hotel. Don't miss the breakfast. It is out of this world.,5,2016,09,23
44,Terrible Response,"My husband and I were staying in a lovely room with a balcony. Coming back inside from the balcony, the extremely heavy door   swung back seriously hurting my foot and breaking the skin. There was a room service waiter in the room and he said it had been a problem before. 
We both called the front desk.
A ""manager"" came up with a first aid kit and put on a band aid. She said someone else would contact me. No one ever did. I was concerned about infection and it did become infected and took a while to heal.
I called the front desk again that night and in the morning before we checked out.
Everyone said there was no record.
I have posted a previous Trip Advisor comment but no response.
Stay somewhere else!!!",1,2016,09,21
44,Memorable Stay,"My husband and I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental several weeks ago while visiting Barcelona. Within two hours of our arrival, a plumbing problem was discovered in our bathroom. We were told we would have to move rooms for 1 night. Having traveled for 24 hours, were tired and quite unhappy with the situation. David Cezezo at the Front Desk stepped in immediately and gave us a significant upgrade. We were blown away with the new accommodations, complete with a bottle of champagne. Of course, this was a unique situation but it demonstrates their commitment to customer service. The entire staff from the front desk to the concierge to dining and housekeeping were outstanding. Combined with the great location, high quality food, and luxurious spa we had a memorable stay in Barcelona. We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,09,20
44,Stupendous,"Easily the best luxury hotel in Spain, stayed in a suite for 3 nights and every single day was simply amazing. The staff were attentive and caring while the food was delectable. Would recommend to anybody going to Barcelona",5,2016,09,19
44,I don't know how they do it,In classic mandarin style it seemed everyone knew me when I arrived ! It is a stunning hotel and the collective staff are world class. Location is excellent and the variety of different rooms available makes the hotel unique.,5,2016,09,19
44,Best hotel in Barcelona,"It is by far the best hotel in Barcelona, not to mention best hotel experience I've had in a very long time. From the moment you walk through the door and enter the hotel, there is not a single minute where the staff is not looking after you or trying to anticipate your needs.",5,2016,09,19
44,"Great room and Staff, Too Long to check in","This review would easily be a 5 except for the long check in process. We arrived at 12 after a long flight from NYC. With such a premium hotel, I thought we should have our room within the hour. We did not get into the room until 3. So, that was quite exhausting and no one gave us somewhere to relax.
Otherwise, the stay was awesome. The room was great; the staff was very attentive and the roof is amazing.",4,2016,09,18
44,No other hotel in Barcelona like the mandarin oriental,"fabulous room, very professional staff and good food!  Loved the hotel building and design.  Enjoyed the roof deck pool and restaurant as well as the other food outlets in the hotel.  Classy amenities and most comfortable bed and bed linens!  Definitely a return to hotel.",5,2016,09,15
44,Weekend,"Very good, just a couple of unfortunate incidents with housekeeping. Dirty tissue and debris left on counter, supervisor just walked into room without knocking or checking if occupied and another maid rang bell and when I answered door, she said it was the wrong room number. ",4,2016,09,15
44,Great experience ,Wonderful hotel with such an attentive staff. Have never had such great service all around. The location was excellent and the breakfast superb. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Barcelona. ,5,2016,09,14
44,Great Hotel Great City,"Spend 4 days as part of our Euro-Trip with friends and decided to stay at the Mandarin.

We simply loved the hotel and location. Restaurants and coffee shops close by to eat and unwind. Retail stores dotting the roads leading to the hotel. Spend our evenings in La Rambla eating and shopping. We simply loved Barcelona.

The room was very good and clean with floor to ceiling windows giving you a great view of the city. The food at the hotel was 5 Stars and the service was even better.

Spent a day in the Spa to unwind and was one of the best Spa experiences we've had.

Highly recommended.",5,2016,09,14
44,Excellent Service. Noisy Experience,"We rate this hotel 3.5 stars.  We had a short stop in Barcelona just for a reservation at El Celler de Can Roca prior to continuing on to Morrocco.  We thought it was preferable to staying in Girona and coming back to Barcelona for the flight out.  The hotel was up to Mandarin Oriental standards in terms of service and aesthetics, but the hotel is certainly not a destination unto itself.

Starting with the advantages of the hotel:

1.  Location: located on Passeig de Gràcia, the hotel is close to a number of Barcelona's shopping and dining establishments as well as entertainment and cultural venues

2. Spa:  as expected of Mandarin Oriental hotels, their spas are more luxurious than most elite hotels with a range of invigorating therapies for the tired traveller

3.  Service:  very professional and helpful staff, especially the Concierge service which was excellent.  The reception was welcoming and most friendly

4. Rooftop Pool: the rooftop pool area offers a gorgeous view of the city

5. Rooms:  are tastefully designed in a modern style that is consistent with their standards

As for the few complaints we have:

1. Rooms: the floor to ceiling windows are a nice touch but the ceilings are not particularly high.  We also had a view of the garden, which was not really a garden, but the backyard of adjacent buildings that seemed to include a school with a court, so there was the noise of children.  Also off in the distance, there were domiciles of locals, which was not very pleasing in terms of views.  Since our stay was short, we didn't bother booking a larger suite or nicer view, but if we absolutely had to stay here again, we would look for that.

2.  Check in Time:  check in time is 3 pm.  That's not too unusual, but they must have had high occupancy that day and it was at least after 3 pm when we were finally able to check-in.  We had to wander around the city tired for at least an hour before our room was ready.  We were not pleased with that.  They were kind enough to invite us to the restaurant and comp us for drinks and food, but we still would have preferred to check in.

2.  Thin walls:  we had an early 6 am flight the next day, but to our dismay could not sleep well due to the thin walls.  All throughout the night we could hear other guests laughing and stomping down the hallway outside our door.  I think the high occupancy might have been one or more wedding parties, which accounted for the late night noise...after our late night return from Girona.  So there was noise from kids on the back during the day and noise from the guests from the front at night.

Some of those negatives aren't completely in the control of the hotel, but again I would avoid the garden view.  I would also look for a room with higher ceilings if available.  And avoid wedding parties.  

The redeeming quality was the Mandarin Oriental's luxurious spa and excellent service.  We left before breakfast was being served so they insisted on packing us quite a nice to go breakfast.  There was so much food that we ended up giving one of them to our taxi driver, which he was quite happy about.  ",4,2016,09,13
44,Very Luxurious Property but just really poor value,"Stayed here for five nights on holiday in September. Stayed in one of the more upmarket rooms and I thought it had all the inclusions. The positives of this place are that its in a smashing place, the service is very good the quality of the rooms is excellent and it has a rooftop pool and bar area.  

The negatives are as follows:
Notwithstanding a really top end hotel rate ($700 euro a night) - with a straight face, they charged us $15 euro a day for internet usage - that's just offensive
The rooftop pool is only 60 cms deep - its like a fish pond
the rooftop restaurant is Michelin rated - no idea how - its warm bar snacks at rip off prices 
The tv in the room probably cost $20k to buy (10 years ago) but was impossible to use

in summary I guess the hotel was good, and we enjoyed staying there but it was just such bad value that it taints your enjoyment of a place. We always stay club level and spend big money on hotels etc, but somehow I ended up feeling foolish when paying the bill at this place - I've stayed at so many hotels in the $500 euro range that just deliver so much more - trying to clip the ticket for internet usage for a few dollars a day just lacks class and left us feeling silly for shelling out all the money and more foolish i guess for thinking that it would have been worth it. 

One last thing - concierge quoted us i think $200 or $250 euro for an airport pick up - the taxi was $37 euro - when i booked an s class Mercedes myself to drop me on at the airport later on the trip it cost $90 euro, the cost for the airport pickup should have been a warning sign about this place.",3,2016,09,12
44,Excellent,"Excellent property in the perfect location. Rooms are sizeable, with good facilities and many of them have a handy balcony.
Service is great, with polite staff going out of the way to please and assist",5,2016,09,12
44,Tough to rate,"I hated to give this place a 3 rating. It's clearly a very nice luxury hotel. Having said that, it is a terrible value. We experienced a long check-in procedure to start. The breakfast buffet was unimpressive. I wanted to suggest they checkout the awesome buffet at a competitor's hotel. The room was very small and lacked a coffee maker and an iron. The room was very nice though. It had the best shower I've ever encountered...anywhere. Anna at check-in was fabulous as was Luis when we had a cocktail in the lounge. Again, a nice hotel but a terrible value.",3,2016,09,10
44,Beautiful oasis in the middle of the city!,"The Mandarin Oriental Barcelona does not disappoint. The service was next level! The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. Check in was seemless and after a long overnight flight we were tired and hungry. Even though our room was not ready the concierge sent us for a complimentary breakfast in the beautiful restaurant downstairs. Our room was worth the wait. It was well appointed, modern with all the conveniences you would expect in a MO. Comfortable beds, very clean and a great shower. The only slight negative was the view of the garden from our balcony. It was not as pretty as I expected, however, Barcelona is such an incredible city it hardly made a difference. After long hot days of touring we were delighted to be able to take a dip in the rooftop pool where the food and service was amazing! An incredible hotel in a fantastic location right in the thick of amazing shopping. The concierge was exceptionally helpful as we navigated the vast restaurant scene in an unfamiliar city. This will be our go to hotel in Barcelona!",5,2016,09,10
44,"The Best Hotel - facility, service, and location","Can't say enough good things about our 6-night stay. Upon arrival, the receptionists were so friendly and accommodating, and Guest Relations rep David Rius was especially generous with his time while giving us a tour of the facility. The hotel is clean and well-run, and the location is ideal... walking distance to wonderful cuisine options as well as the must-see Casa Batlló and La Pedrera. The highlight of our trip was watching a FC Barcelona match at Camp Nou -- and recalling this from earlier conversations, Mr. Rius surprised our daughter with a FC Barca scarf on our check-out date! That's a level of service and consideration you get from only top-level establishments and the fine people who work there. We will absolutely stay again at Mandarin Oriental Barcelona.",5,2016,09,09
44,Best in Barcelona,"This is a true five star hotel!!!!
The service is amazing with a wonderful level of professionalism and care. The rooms are immaculate and well maintained. This was our third stay. The location is close to great shopping and restaurants. It is also close to the Sagrada Familia and Park Guell. The concierge offered great dining options.",5,2016,09,07
44,Our hostess out-shined the sunset over Barcelona,"This is a review of Terrat.  We celebrated our 31st wedding anniversary on the rooftop of the Mandarin overlooking Barcelona.  Our experience was extraordinary of course because of the amazing setting, at sunset, with wine - how could it have been better.  We were not staying at the hotel and due to a last minute change, were not able to eat dinner at Terrat.  Despite this, our hostess, Elena made our evening truly special.  Besides her attentive service, she brought us a small cake with a candle to celebrate our special occasion.  She created the most special experience for us - despite not staying there, and even not eating there. The Mandarin - Terrat is great, but Elena made our 31st anniversary impressively special.",4,2016,09,04
44,Magic in Barcelona,"Great hotel, great location & great staff. Internet is great but you have to pay for it which is disappointing given the standard of the hotel. Would stay here again in a heartbeat none the less. Highly recommended",5,2016,09,02
44,Chic hotel in An amazing location,"Chic hotel, great location, excellent service. Very friendly staff. Travelled with family and my 3 years old daughter. Fantastic food. Rooms are spacious and very comfortable, especially for our child. I would highly recommend this hotel in Barcelona.",5,2016,09,02
44,Sublime,"One may take for granted the outstanding location, lavish interior design, fine furnishings, luxurious amenities, serene ambience and impeccable service that the Mandarin Oriental offers. And I echo the superlatives lavished on these aspects by other reviewers. 

However, what struck me most was the harmonious integration of these components. There is a tranquil, almost effortless quality to one's stay here. From check-in to check-out, things just work exceedingly well.

I tend to most value the quality of service during any hotel visit and the Mandarin Oriental more than satisfies. I was always greeted by name and the staff had a knack for anticipating my needs. I found the concierge recommendations for sight-seeing and dining were spot on. Especially impressive was their ability to predict what I would enjoy based on previous excursions.

I have no complaints whatsoever and can offer little in the way of improvement. For its given market segment, I believe the Mandarin Oriental is essentially perfection.

The next time one visits Barcelona, I strongly recommend treating oneself to a stay at the Mandarin Oriental - truly exceptional!",5,2016,08,31
44,Superb Experience ,A top end luxury hotel located just about in the heart of the city. Stayed in a one bedroom suite with the balcony facing the garden.The breakfast spread is amazing and they have an In house Lebanese chef who cooked a lot of fusion Arabic Mediterranean food.The staff are extremely politely and the service provided during the stay was world class.,5,2016,08,28
44,Review for Sunday Brunch ,"We were in Barcelona staying in Casa Fuster and we're invited by friends for Sunday Brunch at the Mandarin Oriental hotel.  
Myself and my host are gluten sensitive.  Gluten free bread was baked especially for us.  The buffet was very good and we ordered egg benedict was to die for.  The rice meals were exquisite.  Service was excellent.",5,2016,08,28
44,Great position - quality plus,"Centrally situated in Passeig de Gracia The Mandarin Oriental is within easy walking distance of Le Rambla district and surrounded by quality shopping and restaurants. We arrived after 24 hours travelling from Australia - hot and tired. Our room wasn't ready upon arrival but arrived before check in time. Check-in staff were very warm and welcoming and the duty manager escorted us to the rooftop pol deck for a cool drink and relax whilst we waited for our room. This was a nice touch and the pool bar service was outstanding as was the view over Barcelona.
We only booked for one night before boarding a cruise. Our room was ultra modern and a touch quirky. Bathroom was a bit odd but nice just the same. We met friends in the outdoor garden area consisting of bar and snacks. Very nice. There is a Michelin Star restaurant but we didn't eat there. Breakfast was in a lounge type restaurant with a' la carte or extensive buffet. Once again the service was outstanding.
We thoroughly enjoyed out exeperience and would certainly stay here again.",5,2016,08,27
44,Wow,"The Mandarin Oriental is supurb, the views over the town are glorious and so romantic, the staff are so helpful and the food just delicious, washed down with a carva or vino blanco or even a sangria. must do.",4,2016,08,26
44,Still a fan?,"Made a reservation for six nights in a studio suite for almost E 2000/night through the hotel's website. Clever marketing girls and boys who do the write up for the MO website and I should be warned: the suite was just an ordinary hotel room, without a seperate lounge area, a bathroom and a tiny walk in closet with just a few drawers. The butler service was mostly absent, the butler number most of the times answered by the front desk who then had to check with housekeeping, etcetera. The hotel lacks facilities, no serviced general lounge area, a very expensive restaurant always fully booked and a (breakfast restaurant) with a very limited dinner menu.The small roof terrace is not particularly comfortable and serves small dishes and drinks from plastic glasses.The gym is very small in a low ceiling basement with little airconditioning and no fresh air. The pool is a dark uninviting small basement room. We informed the butler twice and well in time that we had to cut our stay to 5 nights. At check out we were told that the cancellation policy stipulated that we while staying 5 nights had to pay for 6. We protested since we had informed the hotel with ample notification, that we pay full fare, the hotel was not full and such policy would force their guests to reserve rooms day by day, no problem with the prevailing low occupancy rates but a problem for the hotel. After this debate, checking with the butler whether we indeed had cancelled our six night - so much for trusting the guest - and internal discussions with management the sixth night was not charged.

After paying Euro 12,000 for our 5 nights in our 'suite' we are no fan, anymore. Mandarin Oriental should do some rethinking on their product, management seems to have started believing their own advertising lingo. Still a room is a room and a suite a suite, in my book.",2,2016,08,25
44,"Very good stay, some issues","Very good and nice hotel. Some issues why I cannot say perfect. We had to waith 2 hours for the suite we booked. While checkin time is 15.00, the room was ready at 17.00 I think this is not acceptable for a very expensive suite. 
Very young employees during our stay, many trainees from hotelschools, and sometimes they forgot orders or made some mistakes. But okay, we all make mistakes when we are learning. But for sure I can recommand this hotel!
",5,2016,08,24
44,"friendly, professional guest services ","A concierge services are very very in quality ! Helpful and Friendly. 
The dining services are fine too, provided a good briefing about the menu . Comfy decorated and modern. Worth to experienced :) Food taste and presentation is up to standard , I suggested the dessert should be more choices .",5,2016,08,23
44,Superb,"We love the  Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona.
We stayed in the new wing with big and modern design suites, which are maybe the best I've ever enjoyed in a city hotel. 
The staff were super helpful and friendly and always do something more than you expect, like when the concierge gave us bags with beach towels and chilled water when we were going to Vilanova.
The rooftop and garden bar are a great places to have a drink after a long day.
Unbeatable location in the middle of everything .Try and book a suite if you can.
",5,2016,08,21
44,Mandarin Oriental Brcelona is over the top,"We recently stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona and had a wonderful experience. Their butler service was excellent and they went our of their way to help us with dinner reservations, early check-in, room upgrades and transportation services. We would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,08,20
44,Living the dream in Barcelona,"From the second we arrived to the moment we left, we lived an amazing experience. 
The service is exceptional, the attention to detail, friendliness of the staff from those in housekeeping to the front desk to the bellboys was superb.
The accomodation was outstanding, so luxurious and tasteful with a much appreciated balcony you can enjoy a nice glass of Rioja on after a long day discovering the city. 
Thank you to the whole team who made it exceptional. Special thank you to Thais Guerrero (Guest Relations Manager) and Andre Devillers (Hotel Manager)  for spoiling us with very nice attentions.
All in all you can be sure we will be back!",5,2016,08,19
44,Did not feel welcome,"Visiting the roof terrace, lounge and innercourt terrace for tea and lunch I did not feel welcome by the Staff. Service took long and there was not a nice atmosphere. The staff did not gave me a warm welcome.
Also the public toilets are to dark, there is not enought light.",3,2016,08,18
44,Charming Getaway,There is nothing bad you can state about this hotel and the experience in this hotel.  The location is perfect for Barcelona.  The whole staff really takes care of you - top notch!  Would do this again and again!,5,2016,08,17
44,Not my favorite mandarin ,Stayed in milan paris london vegas and this is definitely not my favorite rooms are small employees are distracted gym is tiny compared to the size of hotel no pool just what they call feet dipping pool on the roof which you cant swim. And for all that its very pricey compared to other 5 star hotels in barcelona with rooftop pools nice gyms and larger rooms,5,2016,08,16
44,"Not great , Not really 5 star","We checked in with high hopes after a less than impressive stay at Paris Mandarin. 

The room was not ready on arrival (3pm) which was a little disappointing but we did only have to wait 45mins in the bar. 

The room was adequate but not very large. The pool very small with no more than 6 sunbeds! 
The staff were pleasant, SPA very good and the restaurant Ok. 

Not really 5 star and I am ever hopeful that there is something better than this in Barcelona.",3,2016,08,15
44,By far the best in town,"My third trip to Barcelona was the best of all, only because of Mandarin Oriental. By far, this is the best hotel in town. It is certainly more than a hotel, offering comfort, practicality and solutions for everything you may be needing in the city. The staff are incredibly kind, warm, welcoming and understanding. Feel free to dialogue with them about your most personal of needs, and they will discretely comply.
I would say it makes you feel like you're at home, except that's not true, because its much better than home. Kudos for the awesome spa as well. Congrats to the MO Barcelona for the fantastic team.",5,2016,08,12
44,Mother-son weekend,"Last time I was in Barcelona, we stayed at Hotel Arte on the water front. This time I wanted to try something different. Oh. My. Goodness. The Mandarin Oriental is just top notch. The entry way is chic and makes you feel like a celebrity just walking up the glamorous ramp, despite looking bedraggled after a 12-hour flight and 3- hour stopover. 
The reception desk are so friendly and welcoming. They walked us to our room, showed us the elevator and all the fixings. The hotel decor is so stylish. Again the most apt word is ""chic"". 
Absolutely famished, we went to the Terrace restaurant on the rooftop that serves Peruvian cuisine. How delightful! The manager tossed aside the menu and said to leave it up to him. We then experienced a conveyor belt of delicious seafood and fusion cuisine. This restaurant is gorgeous for its views, ambience and food. 
The concierge became my best friend! I asked them to plan out my day while we sank into a deep jet lagged sleep. The next morning we awoke to the perfect itinerary: Segway tour, break for tea, followed by dinner reservations. If we had managed to eat a little faster and not savor every bite, we might have made it to the Magic Fountain, but our appetites got the better of us and dinner took too long. 
As we checked out, the doorman gave our taxi driver exhaustive instructions about first dropping off my son and then waiting before taking me to the airport. They took down the cab number and the drivers name & phone. Just made you feel so safe and protected. 
The level of service at the Mandarin Oriental is outstanding. I'd say it's up there with the Palace View in Tokyo and the Zermatterhoff in Zermatt. ",5,2016,08,07
44,"Excellent, simply the best","We went there in July 2016 and stay there prior to our Norwegian Epic Cruise and also after we finish from the cruise. 

The service of the hotel is truly exceptional, the greetings from staffs began at the first minute that the door of our van open and all the way until they sent us to our room.

I really like the famous catwalk of the hotel. It is elegance, and at the same time, chic and trendy.

The breakfast was very good, you can order everything from the menu and enjoy buffet at the same time, all included.

When we first arrived at around 3 pm, the room was not ready. I was a bit surprised as it is already the check in time but the hotel took the responsibility and invited us for lunch, of course on the hotel's account. The room was ready shortly after that and the staff escorted us to the room.

The room was spacious, simple but at the same time elegance.

The location is perfect as it is the center to everything and shops are in just a walking distance (although we have the car and the driver so we didn't have to walk but it would also be very convenient should we have to do so)

The return stay after the cruise a week after was also impressive and reaffirm the mandarin oriental standards. 

All in all, Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is a fantastic hotel and a very good choice if you travel to Barcelona.",5,2016,08,05
44,Review of the rooftop bar only,We spend a lovely few hours after dinner on the Mandarin Orientals rooftop. Simply stunning with superb service and drinks. Of the three rooftops we visited in the area during our stay in Barcelona this was the best.,5,2016,08,03
44,One of my favourite hotels ever!,"This hotel is truly fantastic. the  hotel is beautiful, the best location , city centre. the rooms are super comfortable, spacious and luxurious.
the hotel staff is true to any mandarin in the world. the concierge services were great. the managers were amazing. truly a  star experience!!!
the spa and pool side is a must visit!
the bankers bar is also a great experience'
cant wait to go back",5,2016,08,02
44,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona,"fantastic all round hotel, best in Barcelona
room great, service great and very well located in Barcelona,
the room was small but very well appointed and the staff could not have been more helpful.
The attention to detail was amazing and the general manager made us feel like genuine friends,
we will definietly be back",5,2016,07,30
44,Return to paradise,"Was delighted to be able to return to this fabulous oasis in the heart of Barcelona. This time we encouraged two other families to join us for 4 days after spending time at Costa Brava. We first visited 4 years ago prior to a cruise - my wife and our three small sons. It was amazing then and this time it was even better. The front desk team are exceptional and the concierge team are outstanding. The genuine interest in our well being, exhibited by all of the staff makes you feel incredibly welcome and very connected with the city. Breakfast each morning in Bistreau is a fabulous way to start the day. I have a gluten free diet and the waiting staff took great care in ensuring I was offered some of the kitchens' fabulous menu options (I've never had GF pastries like these guys have..). The guest rooms are exceptional - the shower is a real treat and the beds are perfect. We chose to have connecting rooms - with the three boys very comfortable in the adjoining room. The personalised gifts for our boys on arrival and the ongoing warmth that was exhibited towards them is refreshing from a 5 star hotel. The concierge engaged with them at every opportunity - encouraging the discussion about the highlights of each day in the city (which were many). A week later - even after we had departed the hotel - the concierge was still assisting us with travel connections (thank you). I travel globally a great deal for business and stay at 5 star hotels, as does one of the other fathers in our group. We agree that this is at the very top of the list of our favorite places to stay. Really love this hotel and looking for a reason to get back to Barca soon so that we can stay here again.",5,2016,07,26
44,Amazing stay!,"The location of this hotel is in the heart of Barcelona! Cannot be more convenience for a Luxury 5 star hotel! incredible service, food is amazing! Love our room with a balcony oversee some fun neighbourhood (feel more like staying at a residential area from the back balcony! feel just like home!) very comfortable room! it was our first trip to Barcelona! love the city, restaurants and of course our staying at Mandarin Barcelona! 
we will definitely come back again!",5,2016,07,26
44,Great!,"Great location, close to the most relevant places to see in the city, caring staff, beautiful big rooms, breakfast with everything you could desire, a pool, a deeping pool, a spa... for a relaxing vacantion!",5,2016,07,26
44,Lovely,We did drinks on the rooftop. The view was lovely. We were able to watch the sun set. Service was great. We did not stay at the hotel. They let us have a drink since they had room for us. You just have to ask and get permission to get to the rooftop bar.,5,2016,07,25
44,Spain,Great hotel. First choice second time I stayed here. Will be back for sure. Spa is great. Breakfast also very high quality . Location is great. For a 5 star hotel the rates are reasonable. Look no further ,5,2016,07,23
44,"Fantastic hotel, great team. Never dissapoints","I have been staying at the Mandarin in Barcelona since it opened a few years ago. It is always a pleasure to be back. I'm continuously surprised by how the team keeps up the excellence of service. From the moment you arrive you are made to feel you are at home away from home. Every team member is friendly and professional anticipating your needs an beeing helpful without beeing overwhelming. The team at the door, the reception team, spa, breakfast, concierge, room cleaning, butlers, etc, etc make your stay special. Rooms are ample, well appointed and comfortable. Specially quiet are the ones overlooking the interior patio, and the suites are exceptional. The spa reception is extremely flexible to accomodate you and  has some of the best therapists I heve encountered in my long travelling life; breakfast caters to every taste and has very high quality fresh produce. And all this with a wonderful team and in the middle of Barcelona . Congratulations !!",5,2016,07,21
44,BEST location in Barcelona,"We traveled as a group of 7 couples in April and most of us had been to Barcelona before and we've decided to stay at the MO Barcelona for it's convenient location and level of service.  Well, this is probably the nicest hotel to stay in Barcelona for a few days' trip and extremely convenient location.  The service was top notch, breakfast was included and excellent menu offerings with Iberico jamon sliced in front of you every morning.  Roof top pool has an excellent view of Barcelona.  The room we had faced the main street and we were high enough that there was no noise and the blinds were really dark even in the daytime and so resting isn't an issue.  The room was good/great with a lot of features and amenities but were a little small.  Shower facility was modern, no tub but it was fine with us.  The only little problem was water almost flooding to the room since there was no actual shower door.  Overall an excellent hotel for the money spent",5,2016,07,20
44,Perfect location perfect service perfect hotel,"This hotel is in a fantastic location. Large shopping street walking distance to dozens of great restaurants and attractions. The breakfast is the largest buffet I have ever had in Europe. Included with Amex Platnium rate it is a great deal. The rooms are modern and functional... Huge bathroom with rain water shower head. The concierge (great guys!)  desk is an invaluable source for your trip. They got us our skip the line tickets at the Gaudi house and Picasso Museum and timed entrances as well for Segada Familia and Parc Guell. We went to Girona  (40 min high speed train) to see where Game of Thrones is filmed at their suggestion... Fantastic mid evil city and the home of Bravos and the church of the High Sparrow. Also we took a train (35 min local)  to Stieges the Saint Tropez of Spain ... If you have time do it! . Hector the manager is an incredible asset to the Mandarin brand... Looking forward to returning soon. Cons... Honestly nothing... If you can stay there you will not regret it! 
Oh and so much is said about pick pockets and petty crime in Spain. We had zero trouble in Spain.. Felt safe even when walking late at night back to the property. ",5,2016,07,20
44,"Wonderful service, pools and attention","Excellent central location. Beautiful breakfast buffets and exemplary customer service. The hotter the weather, the lovelier the fact that they have two pools - one dipping rooftop one; one lower floor indoor swimming pool in spa. 
We had a problem on check in and they sorted out and did so many lovely things to make us forget it. They also have amazing restaurants. the terrace tapas is as good as it gets",5,2016,07,19
44,Possibly my favorite city hotel...,"This is quite possibly my favorite city hotel yet!   Great location, great rooms, great service.   The location on the Passeig de Gracia can't be beat.   A short walk takes you Casa Mila and Casa Batllo.   Stores and restaurants are at your feet - quite literally.   Take a long stroll and walk to Plaza Catalunya and the down Las Ramblas and into the Gothic Quarter.  Ask the Concierge for tips on restaurants, but there are many to choose from within a block from the Hotel (we liked Tapas 24 right around the corner). 

The rooms are great.   We booked a Mandarin room and were placed in the 'new section' overlooking the Mimosa Garden on the back of the hotel.  The room was quite large with tall ceilings and a balcony that spanned the width of the room.   The room design was modern but very comfortable - sleek hardwoods and all glass panels with a sofa and chairs and writing desk.     We appreciated the black out curtains, strong A/C and the crisp white sheets.    The bathroom felt like a separate little oasis with rain head showers, heated mirrors and Acqua di Parma toiletries.  The walk in closet is its own special place, all wood fixtures with indirect lighting and plenty of room for two.  The closet also offers a choice of robes: terry cloth or a lightweight kimono.  It was July, it was hot and after a day of walking around the city, we looked very forward to returning to our cool surrounds.  

We used a number of the hotel facilities.     While the hotel was full while we're staying there, you would not have guessed so other than at breakfast in Bistreau.  The basement pool is very relaxing with a perfect water temp - the steam room is a nice place to relax with tile 'loungers'.  The Mimosa Garden is a tranquil a shaded retreat - great for an early evening cocktail.  It's a bit hard to find at first but worth the venture.  The roof top restaurant (Terat) is a great place to have lunch and a glass of wine with a view over the city.   Note that on the rooftop, you can find a lounger to catch some rays, but the pool only comes up to knee level.  In room dining was always quick and kind.  

And last but certainly not least, the service is great.   Our room wasn't quite ready when we checked in, so Juan at reception walked us to Terat and invited us to a drink on the house.   I had ordered a cake and some bubbles to celebrate an event and both were waiting in our room when we walked in.  We loved coming back in the evening to turndown service, the room always looked great (we just wish that a chocolate had been left on the pillow :-).  We used the concierge desk repeatedly and they offer great advice on local restaurants.    As we would come and go, the staff at the front door were always friendly and welcoming.  

No complaints here.  Nothing but good things to say.",5,2016,07,17
44,Another great MO hotel,"These guys really outdid themselves in the breakfast stakes. Now I'm really finding it hard to judge who has the best breakfast. I think these guys go top two or three. You MUST have the Spanish omelette - delicious. 
The rooms are spacious and ours overlooked the internal courtyard. It felt like we were a million miles away. Awesome shower and bath. 
The team - especially concierge Rodrigo - were amazing. I really think the training the MO group have their teams go through must be first rate. Nothing is ever too much and they always do what they say they will do with no fuss.
Great location for the hotel. 
BUT, the real surprise and massive delight was the rooftop terrace. Great sun beds and covered areas. A brilliant splash pool to cool down in and simply wonderful service from a dedicated team. This terrace area really sets them apart. You can have drinks by the pool or you could have full dinner. A wonderful secret not to be missed. 
And Barcelona - you have to visit. A great city",5,2016,07,11
44,Great experience,"The hotel is fantastic. The location is the best ever, right in shopping street. you can see Casa Batlo from the rooftop. Design is unique, everything very modern. Stuff is very friendly, especially the concierge. They booked for us all attractions we wanted. Wonderful place to stay!!!",5,2016,07,10
44,Tiny Tiny Tiny,"After leaving the Four Seasons in Portugal, I thought I was in for a treat at the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona. 

The Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona SUCKS!  Rooms are tiny tiny tiny. No closet space, no drools, TV was not functioning when we arrived, safe didn't work and the barrooms were designed for little people. 

I was so looking forward to this hotel, but you need to avoid it at all costs. 

Very surprised and disappointed! Very very very poor! ",1,2016,07,08
44,Great location and excellent service,"We had a lovely time at the Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona. It has a very central location to explore Barcelona and easily the best service of any hotel we have been to. The concierge is very helpful and we will definitely be back!",5,2016,07,07
44,Amazing!  Best hotel in Barcelona!,"Best hotel in Barcelona.  Exceptional service all around, especially the converge and Sebastian.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!  We had an outstanding 4 night in Barcelona and the mandarin treated us like family.  I can't say enough, it's the only place I will ever stay in Barcelona.  You are crazy not to stay here!",5,2016,07,06
44,excellence,"iIeally located in the centre of Barcelona, this place lives up to its expectations and might even be bett than its sisters in Bangkok and shanghai 
food is great and staff is quite what one expects there 
luxury at its best",5,2016,07,03
44,Review,"We stayed here 2 years ago, and at the time I didn't use trip advisor, however we recently returned to Barcelona and passed this hotel so thought I would write a quick report. When we stayed everything was great we had a little mishap at the start where they gave us a downgraded room due to ""being busy"" however I managed to explain what we have paid for and me being me had all my paperwork in my bag. It was quickly resolved and we were given our original room. Which was lovely and clean. All staff were happy and chatty. I liked this hotel because it seemed to have a mix of all people. Students on gap years, elderly couples, romantic young couples. And large groups and families. The only problem I had back when I stayed was that outside was all being redone which I was never warned about. However from passing recently I can tell you it looks a lot better! 
Enjoyed our stay. 
Sorry for the late review 😊",4,2016,07,01
44,wonderful stay with a great service!,"We stayed in the hotel for 4 days! The experience was great! We had a butler service who was very professional. Javier was there to meet all our requests and made recommendations for our stay. The concierge team is very professional, all the restaurants they recommended was top class! You should try the spa and the restaurants ! Moments was exceptional and unique experience. The location of the hotel is perfect!",5,2016,06,30
44,"Great service, great situation, great stay!","The staff were amazing and did everything they could to help and make our stay enjoyable!
they where great with our kids and everyone loved to chat! Hotel was clean and comfortable and the swimming pool was great for a dip at the end of a hot day! highly recommend",5,2016,06,30
44,Outstanding experience!,"Amazing hotel. It´s not only about thinking in a place to stay in Barcelona while travelling. It´s the whole unique experience that you live from the moment that you make the first contact until the last ""good-bye"". People are always willing to surprise you. Incredible views of the terrace. Would definitely come back!!",5,2016,06,28
44,Simply the best,"We staid in this hotel for my birthday(me, my husband and little daughter 1,5 year old. We love our stay soo much! Very big modern clean room, the management team was so welcome: helpep us with a baby, organized check out in the room! Breakfast area was amazing with a kids sweet table and a play zone. Thank you from all ou family",5,2016,06,28
44,Great location AND a case study of poor customer management,"it has been our wish for some time to stay for a weekend and finally we did it
from the moment you arrive you are classified into customers with high life time value and the others. so upon arrival they gave us a small room non renovated on the first floor pretending to be fully booked. furthermore they declared this room to be an upgrade to the 740 Euro Deluxe room i booked. it did not take long to meet a valued customer at the reception who paid for the same room type only 375 E , this is called price cascading . anyway following my complaint i got a nice upgrade. yet the experience in the beginning left a bad aftertaste, especialky as i paid the full price ( this is called milking strategy) 
next i asked the concierge to organize Michelin star restaurant for the first night, instead we got a cheap fusion place , so they dont listen to the customer, fortunately the management recommended Ticket which we could join for lunch the next day..ouff...then we asked for the best Paella and again were send to a kind of tourist tsp.
so yes it is a nice hotel with unnecessary problems.",3,2016,06,26
44,Loved it!!,I thought it was the best experience ever with my family. Loved the fact everywhere you go is beautiful and has music and lovely people. If you're coming with you're family or couple it's gonna be perfect for you. Definitely would recommend.,5,2016,06,24
44,Double bed rooms....no can do !,"We were used to the flawless Asian Mandarin Oriental service. 
We specially loved the Tokyo one.
Unfortunately the Barcelona one does not reach the usual Mandarin standart : Asking for a double bed room intead of a king size bed room I was just told that double bed rooms simply do not exist in Barcelona.
You have to book a suite for that, or to be content with a ""French bedding"" which is 2 duvets on a single King size mattress.
I do not call that a Mandarin service.
I call that camping, but a very expensive one !",1,2016,06,23
44,Very well appointed slightly lacking in charm,"This is a very comfortable, quite nicely designed modern hotel in city centre.
There's a lovely roof top area, though 'swimming pool' is actually a small splash pool.
Spa pool area however is fantastic, good size, lovely design and with a great steam room with 5 beds.....
If you're looking for a good nights sleep it's a good place to come to, with super comfy beds and linens. The total black out blinds are also fab, as is the super modern designed Bath.
(However being woken at 6am by reception who had accidentally called the wrong room was NOT appreciated)!
Hands up, I'm a fan of small characterful boutique hotels, so I find this kind of place a little soulless and corporate. 
But you can't argue with the 5 star luxury on offer.....
",3,2016,06,23
44,"Excellent Service, but Smaller Rooms and Fewer Amenities - Try Arts Hotel","The outstanding staff at the Mandarin Oriental make this hotel shine.  Like all Mandarins, the rooms are filled with only the finest linens, comfortable beds, nice touches like quality robes and this hotel even included adapter cords and a high powered dryer and flat iron for ladies in their bathroom. This hotel certainly has what it takes to make guests feel comfortable, but I do not feel like it was at the top of the game for Mandarins.  The hotel itself is small - located on a main street.  The room we had was awkwardly configured and very narrow, with no view and not the finest decor.  The smaller space made it feel less luxurious than I would expect from a MO at this price point - about $800 USD per night for our upgraded category. The next category up for more space was a studio or suite room at almost $2000 USD per night.  Pricey for this particular hotel, because while nice - it did not deliver on the extras.  There was no lobby area to meet or lounge in - even though it had several on site restaurants.  There was what they called a dipping pool - too small to count - and another small indoor lap pool with limited access.   Location was central to the downtown tourist areas and the shopping was excellent just next to the hotel.   In considering this hotel, decide based on price at time of booking if you can select a larger room category - or you will be cramped.  I would try another luxury brand like the Arts Hotel or a stylish boutique option.",4,2016,06,22
44,Great Service and design,"We staid at MO Barcelona for just one night but had a great experience. We loved the room, wonderful design and attention to detail. Toiletries and in room facilities provided are outstanding, ven a yoga mat! We order room service that night and I was impress with the choice and quality. Service was fantastic too, we will stay at MO Barcelona again!",5,2016,06,20
44,Flawless.,"We have just returned from our second visit of the MO in Barcelona. We loved it so much the first time, we returned this year. 

The staff are outstanding. Cannot fault them.
Special mention to Carmen in the spa who worked wonders on my neck and shoulders.

The location is fantastic, easy walking distances, for example 10 mins to La Rambla and 25 mins to the harbour. 

The rooftop pool is the best feature of this hotel. Very comfortable, beautiful views and accommodating staff up there.

Even though we were mid week guests of the hotel, we couldn't get a table as Moments. Very, very frustrating. Book in advance for Moments, we regret not!

Bedroom is fantastic. Bathroom especially, with a very large bath and shower. If you are partial to your baths I recommend you start to run your bath half an hour before you plan to take it- a tub that size takes a very long time to fill. 

Toiletries and in room facilities provided are outstanding. Even a yoga mat in our room!

Breakfast is a little expensive, but if you sit in the Bistro there is a lovely atmosphere and good buffet.",5,2016,06,19
44,ATTN Families - You won't want to leave!,"Danger - the food and service are so good at the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona that you might be hesitant to even leave the facility.

The facility itself isn't excessively opulent.  We stayed at the Mandarin in Paris just a few weeks earlier and that facility is more impressive.  The rooms are gorgeous and everything is beautifully decorated and appointed.  It's tremendously clean as well.

What makes this a special property is the level of service is a site to behold.  They are clearly trained in a very specific way.  If you ask someone a question and it's either better handled by someone else or directions in the hotel, whoever you ask stops what they are doing and walks you to the next staff member, making a ""warm introduction"" to that person.  

This practice is incredibly luxurious.  It makes you feel like you are the most treasured guest this have - but of course they treat everyone this week.  When I walked I took a right and indicated I was checking in.  Instead I was at the concierge desk (it is not marked as such).  Registration is on the other side of the lobby about 40 steps the opposite direction.  Upon asking my name and about our travels, they walked with me the 40 steps and introduce me to the front desk staffer.  The entire experience was like this.  

Additionally, they could not have been nicer or more friendly to our three children.  Nobody wanted to leave because in addition to the service, the food and drinks in all locations were phenomenal.

We are due to come back to Barcelona next June to catch a cruise and we will surely visit the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona again.",5,2016,06,19
44,I am a fan....,"Stayed in the MO for 3 nights - a combination of business and pleasure;

Efficiënt check-in with nice reception area that is elevated above street level through a ramp up entrance, very nice design; Accommodation was ready, and was escorted to my room; Nice lay-out room, with excellent amenities and a nice balcony overlooking the courtyard;

Highlights of the hotel:

- Excellent staff, concierge made a big effort to get us reservations in our favourite restaurant on Saturday evening;
- Small, but efficient rooms, we had a large walk-in shower and full bathroom amenities (toothbrush, shaving kit, etc.);
- Good stocked minibar and comfortable (electric) blinds
- Free and fast Wifi;
- In room dining options, you can even order from a special room service menu with dishes from the Moments (Michelin star) restaurant; 
- Both outside areas (garden and roof-top) are great to relax and have drinks and enjoy a lunch; Roof-top pool is exclusively for hotel residents only during the day

- Location very central on Passeig de Gracia and close to Plaza Catalunya with good public transport options available;

My preferred address when in Barcelona !",5,2016,06,19
44,The best staff you can imagine,"Stayed here for 3 nights on our honeymoon.  The service is so kind and sincere.  I felt like a prime minister.   The concierge staff is amazing and loved getting my daily greetings from them as I passed to the elevator.  Doorman and front desk staff equally as impressive.  

The restaurant Moments is a must if you love fine dinning.  I went two days in a row for lunch. 

We had a great garden view room with a terrace which was perfect.  Very quite and urban at the same time.   The shows is amazing.  It's like been under a waterfall.   

Also the hotel is a perfect location.  Doesn't get any better.  Be sure to check out the private Egyptian collection just 2 blocks up.  One of the best in Europe.   ",5,2016,06,16
44,Perfect hotel.  Don't stay in any room  ending with 10,"Everything was perfect about the stay but was somehow was given the worst room on the floor.  Room 410.  
After an 18 hour trip from Hong Kong via London, arrived excited about the trip and of course the stay at Mandarin.   Tried to take a nap but there was non stop noise.  Not from the garden courtyard but from the hallway.   Room 410 is directly across from the door to the service elevator.  With a door that you just push open and bang close.  For the few hours that I was trying to nap before our epic dinner at El celler de can Roca, the cleaning staff were going in and out, with non stop noise.   My friends had two other rooms, and one of them was at room 610 with the same noise issues.   
other than that, eveything else was perfect, the rest of our crew of 9 was at W barcelona (for the addictive Spg points and the beach) but I had no regrets about MO Barcelona.  Room was a little on the small side but I loved everything else about this hotel.  
I was only here for one night.  Otherwise I would have asked for a change of rooms.   ",4,2016,06,16
44,Wow,Fell in love with the hotel the moment i stepped in. Staff were friendly and gave us a warm welcome and i really loved the room. What i loved about it is most of the staff of concierge are golden keys members! I assume all of them if not mistaken. Lovely hotel,5,2016,06,14
44,Superb,"I was disappointed that I could not enjoy the hotel to the fullest due to not having enough time!  The terrace on the top floor is small but oh so wonderful, with a dipping pool just big enough to cool down in - not swim in, The garden room I stayed in was an oasis of rest with a large bathroom (only shower), lovely bathrobes and high quality products (a loofah, dental kit, sewing kit, comb, ...), a docking station, 2 TVs, very nice decor, separate seating area and licht blocking blinds. Last but absolutely not least, great service from the front desk and the concierge...  Absolutely a hotel to go back to. Note: next to reception you find a Manolo Blahnik store and the hotel has a Michelin star restaurant.",5,2016,06,10
44,Already looking forward to our next visit,"American Express made the recommendation of the Mandarin Oriental. We couldn't be more grateful.

From start to finish we couldn't have been looked after better during our short stay in Barcelona. The staff made us feel incredibly welcome, our room was just amazing and the food was amazing.

I've stayed in some superb hotels across the world but the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona has to be one of the best",5,2016,06,08
44,Lunch and Spa at Mandarin,"I've booked this promotion while I've visited  the city and been always curious as Im big fun of MO group. So I decided to check it out for my for my future stay.

I can only confirm with all reviews the service here is impeccable. My spa treatment was amazing and that relaxing area. Just wow. 

Only a bit disappointed with a food.The Mackerel salad was  good however the main cannelloni dish was pure salt. I couldn't even had a bite. Also I have no problem to pay for my own drinks but it should be stated in booking that the drink are not included.

I'm still fun tho :D",4,2016,06,07
44,Top notch hotel in the centre of Barcelona,"We stayed with our two girls over two nights for half term. The hotel did not disappoint. Our garden rooms were tastefully decorated and looked onto the gardens. I'd requested quiet rooms and they were very quiet. The roof top is a great place for an early evening cocktail with stunning views across the city, and the spa is excellent with a good sized pool and steam room. We had to pay for wifi which is a bit disappointing as it's a luxury hotel at I'd expect it to be included.",5,2016,06,05
44,"Beautiful hotel in an A plus location, great bar","We rented an apartment in Barcelona but spent quite a bit of time at the Mandarin bar. 
Quite a different mix of people and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. 
There was a young man from France who took care of us at the bar when we visited. Very professional and a top notch bar tender. His name escapes me now but I'll update soon.",5,2016,06,05
44,Beautiful dinner,"We stayed nearby and visited the Mandarin for dinner one night.  The hotel and dining room are beautiful.  The food was everything you would expect from the Mandarin Oriental.  Service was a bit off, but the table captain corrected everything by escorting us to the Bank bar for after dinner drinks.  While it's not a place to absorb local culture, it's a wonderful retreat from the chaos on the streets.",4,2016,06,03
44,Amazing Service!!,"Contemporary and calm!  You will not be disappointed by choosing to stay at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona.  There is much to recommend it just based on location alone, but it is so much more than just that.  
Location wise it is right in the posh neighbourhood, walking to a new of sights as well as Plaza Catalunya!  You really feel that you can walk almost anywhere.  If it is further away, the metro is right there!  Inside the rooms are very quiet and you cannot hear any of the noise from the street.
The hotel restaurants are lovely, the rooftop fabulous and the Bank bar is just amazing, but if you want to venture out of the hotel there are some great options very close by which the concierge is very happy to assist with.  The concierge team is very knowledgeable, friendly and kind - always ready with suggestions.  Albert from the concierge team offered some great tips for bars!  
Check in was efficient with the warmest welcome possible!  I can't seem to recall the name of the person who helped us check in (Krystina?) but she was more hospitable.  From the first moment you truly felt that you were being looked after.  The room itself is a calm oasis after a busy day, comfortable in size and contemporary in feel.  One more thing I must mention is the breakfast!  There is a wide array of choice for breakfast but that comes second to the attentiveness of the people there!  Everyone was so attentive, remembering our preferences from the day before, looking after us as if it is their second nature but unassuming at the same time.  Alex from the team even came to tell us when more dim sum dumplings were available!  I would wholeheartedly recommend staying here.",5,2016,05,31
44,Not worth the Room Rates,"MO in Barcelona is a wonderful hotel with great location, good street to lobby access, friendly and very helpful staff.  Good in room amenities, but not great.  Why won't I stay here again?  The rooms are a real let down for the amount we paid.
We chose the Mandarin Room, 36sqm.  The design of the room was sleek and modern but lacked functionality.  No drawers at all, only a large wardrobe.  The toilet was away in a separate cubicle from the rest of the bathroom.  It was located at the entrance to the room.  There is a balcony but you would have to draw the curtain at all times as when you neighbour sits on their balcony they look straight into your room.  The bed was very soft, fine if you like soft beds.  I had no problem but my husband with a back problem found it challenging.  Hardly any vanity counter space.  No coffee making or even a kettle.  Lighting was dim.  With all the lights on it was still ""soft lighting"" in the room.
We stayed at other five stars in Barcelona and the rooms are much better without the hefty price tag of this MO.",4,2016,05,28
44,The best,"Our stay at this hotel was exceptional.  Great location, outstanding service, and wonderful meals.  The staff anticipated our needs, especially helpful with local knowledge, and made the visit to Barcelona all the more enjoyable.",5,2016,05,27
44,Absolutely recommend!!!!,This hotel is superbly located on one of the best streets in Barcelona.  You can walk everywhere.  The service is impeccable.   The quality of this hotel is top notch and the staff is amazing.  Everyone knew our name and attended to each of our needs when asked. Staying at this hotel was a highlight of our vacation.   Please consider the Mandarin Oriental on your next visit to Barcelona.  ,5,2016,05,27
44,Best stay in Barcelona,"Professionel and efficient Staff, Fantastic rooms and Restaurant's
and an excellent Terasse on the roof where they serve excellent Food
The Hotel is Located in the best area in Barcelona with a lot of Shops and Restaurants.",5,2016,05,23
44,Wonderful spa massage.,"As a hopeless massage addict, I tried the massage here and concluded that this is one of the most dependable massage saloons worldwide. 

Preparation: the swimming pool is salted and thus offers a huge floating power. With some tiny force you can swim faster than usual. I did some swimming prior to the massage. And the pool area is very chic (though being a bit on the small side), design-wise. 

Gym: very well laid out and functions well. You can find all the necessary weights and cardio equipment here. And the pictures on the wall are quite impressive. Designer’s taste is good. 

Spa reception: a totally pleasant experience. Efficient and considerate. 

Massage room: very well furnished and so quiet. Music is relaxing and soothing. Barcelona has many boltholes to explore and you will feel tired after a day’s touring. So having a quality spa massage is very helpful for your restoration of some energy and preparation for a good sleep. My therapist is experienced and her fingers worked magic on my fatigued body. 

The Restaurant: after the massage, I headed to the famous restaurant. Gosh, the design is soooo pretty and the furniture is entirely classy!!!!!! Every middle class professional would want his or her own home to be designed in a likewise manner – simple, tasty, colorful, inspiring and warm. The light lunch is yummy and the presentation is absolutely memorable. You have to try this restaurant when staying or visiting this hotel. 

Rooftop bar and pool: I am glad to have gone upstairs before leaving the hotel. The rooftop bar has a wonderful view of the whole city. With bright sunshine and a cloudless sky, you feel the gentle breeze and sip on your wonderful local beer, while relaxing to some nice music. What a good place to get tuned into Barcelona!!!

Reception area: the entire design was done by a female Spanish designer and she did everything so RIGHT. Very low-profile luxury. Nothing was ever overdone. All the details are CHIC, high quality and effortlessly render an atmosphere of underrated sophistication. I like such style very, very much, after having experienced some overly-posh hotels in the rest of the world.",5,2016,05,19
44,The only place to stay,"Even with its price tag, this is the only place to stay in Barcelona. It's the most comfortable and luxorious place to stay in the heart of the city. I highly recommend foregoing the 'but I just need a place to stay' mentality. If you want the perfect trip, stay here. Otherwise, settle for less than perfect. ",5,2016,05,18
44,Memorable ,"We had not stayed at a Mandarin Oriental hotel before and would recommend it to the seasoned traveler looking for impeccable service and luxury We stayed 4 nights and used the concierge service for all our restaurant bookings and sightseeing advice
I can only say it was awesome!!! ",5,2016,05,17
44,Amazing hotel with excellent service!,"We had an excellent 10-day stay at Mandarin Oriental Barcelona! We had two adjoining rooms and both were extremely spacious. Decor was truly amazing and it actually felt as if we were the firsts to stay there - everything in both rooms looked brand new. We also had a pretty impressive balcony where we could have meals surrounded by a nice garden.

Service at the hotel is excellent. The butler service works really well and is very attentive - it was actually one of the highlights of our stay. Concierges are very friendly and so is the staff at the main restaurant. Breakfast and room service are amongst the top I have ever had.  The Michelin starred restaurant, Moments, is also excellent and it is actually quite good fun (not overly formal, excellent inventive dishes and some nice surprises along the way). Views from the rooftop bar are amazing and really worth a visit for a drink by sunset. The spa looks great too. 

To sum up, I would say this is one of the best hotels I stayed so far - it is definitely worth a visit!
",5,2016,05,15
44,Best City Hotel I saw so far!,"What an amazing overnight - where should I start?

Took the airport pick-up with S-Class, which was very expensive (more than double what you normally pay). It was worth the money... Very nice driver, superior S500L Hybrid, with all stuff from hotel in it, so you could inform yourself about the hotel.
Driver informed hotel staff about arrival and I was greatet by a group of people taking care of everything immediately. Check-In with receptionist on the walk inside to the hotel.

They also upgraded me 3 levels to a Deluxe Suite, which was really awesome. Two mini balconies to passeig gracia, and a gigantic bathroom with the best rain shower I had so far. Very comfortable bed. Design pieces everywhere, super mini-bar. Full DIning Table for 6-8 people. All just ""perfect"" (and I use this word very rarely). Used room service at evening, and also this one was delicious, set up on private dining table.

Breakfast was in style, and the eggs benedict were special and very tasty. Good choice on the buffet. Sunday Brunch definitely a recommendation as well!

Too cold to use the roof terrace, but the view was impeccable, Pool very shallow.

SPA with pool is quite small, but very nicely designed. State of the art, mid-sized gym.

Will definitely come there again!",5,2016,05,15
44,Slightly disappointed...,"Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed at the MO in Barcelona. I have always regarded Mandarin Oriental as the pinnacle of luxury hospitality with the Hong Kong branch among one of my favourite hotels. I had been recommended to other hotels in Barcelona but opted to stay at MO for one night due to my fond memories of the hotel and trust that it will deliver. The experience was not bad but at 600 euros+ for a basic room, I would have much gladly spent it elsewhere. The rooms themselves were nice but not excellent and the bathrooms could do a little more updating. The service itself was fine, but at times, there was no one to help us in the lobby and half the room rushing to someone else who appeared far more important. Why does it take over 20 minutes to get my bags when the person next to us checking in has three people hovering over them? Additionally, there is wifi throughout but you have to pay for it...? Its not uncommon to not offer free wifi but if the store next door to you has free wifi, its a little embarrassing to charge for it. 
I have stayed at other hotels in Barcelona such as the new Monument that opened recently and the experience there was much more personable and better for value.
I do however want to add that Albert at the Concierge desk was the only reason why the experience at MO was not entirely lackluster, he was very well informed and a pleasure to talk to. 
There are so many great hotels in Barcelona, I would recommend staying elsewhere.",3,2016,05,11
44,A very special hotel,Friendly staff. Beautiful rooms and ambience throughout. My wife and I enjoyed our first anniversary and her birthday during a special few days in Barcelona. This is a wonderful hotel. Staff organise some lovely food treats for our anniversary and a birthday cake for her big day. Totally unexpected and very much appreciated. Made us feel even more spoilt. ,5,2016,05,08
44,Pure Excellence,"A wonderful modern hotel where the friendly staff will make you feel welcomed and will look after you with pleasure. Fantastic location in the heart of the city. Certainly not a cheap hotel, so not for the budget conscious. I will definitely stay there next time.",5,2016,05,07
44,Not that Great,"I also agree with the earlier review of Amy from Washington DC - this hotel is just not on par with other Mandarin hotels. Its tired and need of an update.

Pros - 

1. Staff are fantastic; very helpful and polite and as my wife pointed out, very good looking.
2. Location  - you cant fault it
3. Hotel terrace and pool - one of the best

Cons - 
1. Breakfast was poor and over-priced. I don't understand that after paying €600 per night the breakfast was not included! 
2. Michelin star restaurant - kitsch and out of date 
3. View from room terrace not in keeping with the hotel

Overall, I felt that the Hotel was very tired and lacked a personality. I also feel the days of over-powering Hotel lobbies with musk fragrances are long gone.

Would I stay again? - No. However, would definitely try the Cotton House which is 5 minutes walk,

The hotel also had an over=powering fragrance",3,2016,05,06
44,Outside garden bar is very peaceful,"We went in the day just for drinks in the outside garden bar. Peaceful and serving great mojitos we had a lovely break there in between our sightseeing. 

Lovely herb garden surrounding and lovely staff as you would probably expect from a mandarin. Lovely",4,2016,04,30
44,The most comfortable hotel in Barcelona,"Great hotel, best location in the center-everything is at hand. All staff do excellent work, I liked the style, pool and rooftop bar. Really feel relaxed, inspired  and full of energy.  If you care about the quality of service and lifestyle , be sure that Mandarin Oriental provides the best ones!",5,2016,04,29
44,The WOW factor!!,This is by far the most amazing hotel I have ever stayed at around the world!  From the moment we walked up and were greeted to the moment we left we always had a smile on our face.  From the amazing room to the staff everything exceeded our expectations! If you are looking to book a room in Barcelona do NOT book anywhere else but here.  We are now loyal Mandarin Oriental clients for life!,5,2016,04,28
44,Best Hotel in Barcelona!,"Like most Mandarin properties,  you cannot get more central in location then Mandarin Barcelona. Its location is right in the middle of the heart of the city.  Although it is situated on a busy main shopping and attractions,  the moment you step onto the property, you feel like you are entering a private club.  The way the entry is designed which elevates you to the higher floor lobby removes you from the busy sidewalk and crowd.  As you enter the lobby, the cozy but well designed and warm space welcomes and embraces you into a charming welcome.  The staff is amazingly courteous especially the concierge who are not only knowledgeable but follows through with every detail.
 
The rooms are spacious and well designed.  We ordered room service and could not say anything less than superb from not only the staff's courteous manners but the delicious food.  I highly recommend the local breakfast which is not only a feast in itself but is truly delectable.  
 
There are many things to do at this Mandarin property.  From the organic and well designed garden which can host private parties, to the rooftop pool which has a million dollar view of the beautiful and vigorous Barcelona view,  there is NOT a better property in Barcelona.  And not mention the spa and well equipped gym with the amusing ""sumo wrestler"" wall background.
 
I look forward to coming back to not only the city but staying at the property.",5,2016,04,27
44,Mandarin Oriental - Barcelona,An excellent hotel with exceptional staff. The hotel is situated in the heart of Barcelona within easy reach of all the main attractions. I can't recommend it highly enough. The restaurant on the rooftop terrace has recently opened and the food was fantastic.,5,2016,04,25
44,Beautiful hotel,"I stayed here on a business trip and thought it was a beautiful hotel, well located with plenty of restaurants near by. Attention to detail was  excellent, great check in experience and the rooms are beautiful. One of my favorite hotels for a business trip to Barcelona and I will return",5,2016,04,22
44,Puzzled by the five star reviews,"My husband and I just stayed here for 8 days.  It was my birthday and we wanted to love this hotel.  We booked a junior suite.  When taken to our room, it seemed a bit frayed (calking in shower not great, rug a bit stained).  I called and requested a different room and was told we could switch midweek (which we dislike doing).  The butler staff came to our rescue and got us another room which was modern and fresh and much more to our liking.  I'm not sure why it was called a studio suite (since only one room) but we weren't going to quibble.  It was a pretty room with good soundproofing and a comfortable bed.  The view was of a local school and apartments (not ideal). 

Here are the pros and cons of this hotel (you be the judge):
Pros:  The concierge and butler staff were very attentive, nice, and helpful.  The hotel was quiet.  The location is excellent.   Our room (once we switched) was a perfectly nice room although we have stayed in much nicer rooms.  Nice indoor pool and spa.  

Cons:  The food was mediocre.  We thought that the breakfast was unimpressive for a top flight hotel (pastries only okay, fruit salad chintzy)  and our dinner at the hotel restaurant (not Moments which we didn't get to) was only fair.  Our dessert consisted of frozen macaroons.   We were very surprised that the gardens outside were not open (why not?  it's springtime!).  We thought that the menu at the Bankers Bar was unappealing,so we left, but I realize that may just be personal taste.  The rooftop bar was closed for two of the evenings that we were there.  Why were we told that we could not switch rooms until mid week?!  

I am not sure that the Barcelona Mandarin is at the same level as other Mandarin hotels. My husband who recently stayed at a Mandarin in Asia does not think that this one is comparable.  Please know that we were paying over 1200 euros a night for this hotel and so I am comparing it to other hotels in this category.  Also, please know that I appreciate the kindness of the butler and concierge staff.",3,2016,04,19
44,"Comfortable, Friendly & Central","Rooms/suites were well presented and equipped. (Loved the 'wet room' style shower)
Spa - Swimming pool excellent (the children loved it)
Dining! I only experienced food in the Bistro and would not bother again- Thai curry with fish - basically 1 tablespoon of tiny morsels of fish served with a Very Wet Rice! The same with the chicken Curry- very hard to find a piece of chicken!! BUFFET BREAKFAST in the same restaurant - VERY VERY good - excellent choice including chinese dumplings and stir fried vegetables.
THE STAFF - extremely friendly and helpful.
Will I go again? -  YES INDEED.",4,2016,04,19
44,A real Mandarin Oriental in Europe,"This hotel really surprised me and in a good way. Ahead of our stay I thought we were paying a lot for what seem to be small rooms, and yet I left thinking it was great value. This MO is in the league of the Oriental or Hong Kong MO, rather than other properties which trade off the name like in Kuala Lumpur of Singapore.

The room we had has brilliant, full of design touches and no straight lines to reflect Gaudi's architectural style. The bath tub filled quickly; the shower was powerful in its own alcove with floating pebble style floor. The amenities well thought out; great bath salts, and I loved the Shanghai Tang toiletries. Having a balcony was a real treat too to sit out in the sunshine and chill.

Service was sublime. On entering the bar the second night we were asked if we would like our usual drinks! You expect that in Asia but this was a first for the European properties. The Concierge managed to book a table at the restaurant I had tried and found to be full. He recommended a great motorcycle and sidecar tour of the city which was just perfect. Late afternoon drinks on the terrace wasn't a problem as tables were held back for hotel guests.

It is a struggle to fault anything although it would have been nice if the docking speakers had been equipped with a lightening adapter.

I really enjoyed this hotel and it is a place I would be so happy to return.",5,2016,04,19
44,Magnificent Mandarin,"This was my 3rd stay at the MO BCN, it's easily my favourite city hotel. 

Pros
The staff are amazing, personal welcome and tour of the hotel, can't do enough to make your stay enjoyable
The interior design is cool, very modern, the whole place even smells great
The spa / indoor pool / gym is really good for a smaller hotel
Rooftop bar / pool area overlooking the city is great for sunbathing during the day and cocktails in the evening (it opens to the public for drinks around sunset) and has very good service
Rooms also really cool design, very comfortable.
Nice part of Barcelona, lots of bars restaurants shops on the doorstep 
 
Cons
Really can't think of many, if you want to go to the beach it's about 30 min walk (or 5-10min cab) through the city but it's a nice walk through the gothic area
It's not cheap but you get what you pay for and I think it's good value ",5,2016,04,16
44,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"When we had planned a visit to Barcelona, early this year, we had to book a hotel. Despite many others recommendations, I decided on the Mandarin Oriental. We arrived on Monday from London and were received very warmly. The doorman even knew our name when we got out of the taxi ! 
We were here for 4 nights and our stay was very comfortable. the staff are really well trained and very helpful. The concierge was always well informed. Our room was clean and well laid out. 
Having visited other hotels while we were here, I can only say that we were very happy that we had chosen this one. 
Every time we returned from sight seeing or shopping, the staff received us warmly.
Their Spa is excellent. 
The hotel is well located and all the  best shops are near by. There are also great restaurants within a short walking distance. 
So if you're coming to Barcelona, stay here !",5,2016,04,14
44,Amazing experience,"Last Saturday my friends and I went for a drink in the roof top and Jean Gabriel took personal care of us, he helped us choosing the cocktails according to our taste and I must say that he did knew exactly what we wanted. On the other hand, we were a little bit surprised to have our drinks on plastic cups I suppose it has something to do with the pool still excellent service and great views! Thanks team Mandarin!!",5,2016,04,12
44,Like a dream,I stayed here together with my husband back in September and it was just a dream coming true! We absolutely loved it! The staff would always greet us and help us with anything. The room was spotless and the beds were comfortable. Such a gorgeous hotel! You definitely won't regret staying here! Even though you are vey central it's nice to have the metro nearby.,5,2016,04,09
44,OK and expensive but not great ,"The hotel is located on the main upscale shopping street which is great. We had two Garden view rooms which actually face very old houses from the back and a schoolyard which can be very noisy. The rooms are very small - the interior is not 5 star and a bit tired. Rooftop is amazing. Small gym and a short 12m lap pool.
Great breakfast buffet but as some mention here, there is an issue with the egg dishes.
Staff is very friendly.",3,2016,04,08
44,First rate (but expensive) hotel,Well... when you pay 450+ euros a night for a modest sized room and it doesn't even include breakfast it BETTER be nice. And it is. The service is very good and the restaurants are fine. But why eat at the hotel when (for much less) there are so many amazing restaurants. The location is great and I will probably stay here next time!,5,2016,04,06
44,Not Worth It!,"Not up to the usual Mandarin Oriental standards. Service is spotty, the food is not particularly good, and the room was oddly configured, loud and uncomfortable. No air-conditioning in the lobby and breakfast area-----unpleasant on a hot Spanish day! Definitely not to be reccommended!",3,2016,04,03
44,Luxuriant bliss in prime location,"3 day treat, for my daughter's birthday. Although we took the most basic room it was extremely comfortable and perfectly minimal, with a small terrace. Fabulous, friendly, charming staff throughout the hotel and the Spa was 'to die for'! Cannot comment on the food, because visiting Barcelona, arguably the food Capital of Europe, we were out the whole time, but I would definitely book again! Looking forward to next Mandarin Oriental experience in Marrakech!",5,2016,03,31
44,Excellent Concierge,"My family was at Mandarin Oriental Barcelona from 21 Mar for 5 days. We had an excellent stay with great restaurant recommendations from the concierge team who were friendly and professional throughout our time there. In fact, the willingness to serve attitude was observed from the doormen, front desk to the housekeeping staff. They never fail to make eye contact and greet you at every turn. I will like to make special mention of Claudio from Concierge who went the extra mile to arrange a restaurant booking on Good Friday night for my mother's 70th birthday celebration on short notice. I will recommend this hotel for anyone who wants a welcoming stay in the city centre. ",5,2016,03,25
44,BEST HOTEL IN BARCELONA,"With all my heard I want to thank huge thank you for all you team for this amazing stay with you! From the first contact to the last goodbye this experience for me was incomparable. The service was so unimpeachable that I can't even express this in words! Please believe me, because of my job I travel a lot and experience lots of 5 star deluxe properties and without any doubt I can confirm that your hotel and your staff on of the best one!

great location, very contemporary, new, light rooms, great SPA and GYM, very full Breakfast: try Eggs Benedict with salmon- It is masterpiece!

I wish to say huge thank you to reservation department which helped me so very much with my pre-arrival reservation! Took all the notes, was so helpful, so attentive to all my changes, with all my preferences! It was a great pleasure to deal with them
I wish to say huge thank you to all the staff of the hotel who made our stay so memorable, for this unexpected and unbelievable upgrade to mandarin junior suit, which was stunning! And especially thanks to our butler , who was also so helpful and so attentive!",5,2016,03,25
44,Just Excellent,"Service impecable , excellent location..perfect stay. Staff is welcoming and extremely helpful .Interesting open shower in the bathroom, great spa , pool and gym.

44,Perfect stay! ,"My partner and I had a perfect stay at the MO Barcelona for our anniversary trip in October 2015! The team was very knowledgeable and willing to fulfill all our dreams. 
The breakfast was very good with efficient and warm service. 
Thank you again for the romantic welcome... :) looking forward to our next stay! ",5,2016,03,22
44,Can't speak highly enough of this.,"Usually in a review  I try to give a balance of  pros and cons.  Here  I can  only think  of pros. The hotel is superb, the staff very helpful and  friendly, frm  doorman to concierge, to waiters, to spa, everything. The location is excellent, the building excellent, the food superb. 

I could carry  on waxing lyrical  but  it would  only to be to say x, y and z all great. Which would waste your time. So just try it!

(OK, one  tiny quibble - no free wifi!)",5,2016,03,21
44,Nice weekend get away,"Really nice spot for a weekend get away. Perfect location! Walking distance to everything! Nice and enjoyable. Our room needed some refurbishment, but was comfortable anyway. Dog friendly! Friendly and helpful staff!",4,2016,03,20
44,Mandarin Oriental without all the standard luxury,"Mandarin Oriental Hotels are known as 5 Star Hotels so this rating is based on their category. It is a very nice Hotel but compared to other Five Star Hotels it has some shortcomings. The rooms are very small ( at least, the one I was assigned paying over $ 500 a night !) . The Spa is great but the Fitness room is completely inadequate. The breakfast served is truly extraordinary. No complaints there. Overall attention of the staff is quite good.",3,2016,03,18
44,"What a lovely, pleasant hotel, clean and efficient, great location!","Fantastic location near Gaudi sites and lots of shopping and the market. If you're a walker, you can walk to the gothic cathedral and explore the Ramblas so easily from this great location!  

Comfortable beds. Great minibar. Yummy room service. Spacious rooms and fantastic bathroom and tub! Roomy closet. Great room service. Quiet. Not the best views, but the room is so nice, who cares? Get out there and explore this amazing city from this location/starting point.  We'd stay here again in a heartbeat! 

(FYI: The Mandarin Oriental in Paris is a different story... do not recommend)",5,2016,03,10
44,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona - Perfection,"Where do I even begin. Only one word describes this gem of a hotel: Perfection. Everything and everyone from the moment we arrived until the moment we left, couldn't have been more accommodating and hospitable. The staff went over, above and beyond, anticipating our every need.  Our room was incredibly spacious, tastefully decorated and furnished with the highest quality bedding, linens and bath paraphernalia. Champagne on ice greeted us at the door. Fresh orchids, sumptuous assortment of fruit, delicious espresso and the highest quality of bed linens made it difficult to get out of bed each morning.  Our suite overlooked Passeig de Gràcia and our lovely floor-to-ceiling French doors allowed natural light to flow through, keeping it light and airy. Our dinner at Moments was indescribable. It was probably the best dinner we've ever had.  The service was beyond impeccable with each carefully crafted dish made to perfection. It was quite the culinary experience for my husband and I.  There is no doubt we will forever make this wonderful hotel the place we hang our hat when visiting Barcelona. Not only will we be graced by it's opulent  surroundings and professional staff, but will also make sure our colleagues and friends sample and experience this wonderful union of East and Southwest – Simplistic timeless elegance with the highest rated service only the Far East can bring, blending with the captivating passion and energy of the European Southwest – a perfect combination.  To Greg Liddell, General Manager: kudos to you for an incredible job well done. You and your staff are truly the best.",5,2016,03,06
44,Bankers bar ,"Great bar at the mandarin.  The bartenders appear to be artists making the drinks.  Yes the prices are high but the drinks are solid and consistent.   Drink menu is varied with pretty much every liquor you might want. Wine prices seemed normal and not inflated 

Nice little olive and chips tapas served with the drinks.  They give you the wifi password on a card when you walk in.  Nice touch  Would definitely return ",4,2016,03,03
44,Bankers Bar,"A great place for business drinks, quiet and sophisticated. Prices are steep as you'd expect. Attentive staff too. The outside area is nice although the doors seem ridiculously large and clumsy for guests and particularly staff to get through with drinks.",4,2016,02,24
44,Excellent palace,"Great hotel located in city center barcelona, in paseo de gracia near a lot of shops. Hotel is very clean an have a good service, we have been i time at restaurant and food was very taste. Service very pulite and always tried to help us with places to visit",5,2016,02,23
44,One of the best! ,"The feeling Mandarin Oriental Barcelona transmits to its guests is the feeling of being ""home away from home"". My boyfriend and I spent two days there and during our entire stay no efforts have been spared to make this experience unforgettable! 
The staff knew that I was coming to Barcelona to attend the half marathon and they all went beyond and above to delight me. When I came back to the hotel after the run, I found energy bars and drinks in the room as amenity and upon turn down service the staff prepared different creams and lotions aimed to relax my tired muscles from the race. That was surely unexpected and very thoughtful! 
We are looking forward to our next stay!",5,2016,02,22
44,"Concierge wins, room & housekeeping could use extra work","The greatest asset of MO Barcelona is their Concierge team. For our trip, it was really the concierge that made the stay spectacular giving credit to Antonio and his colleagues on making very good recommendations from shopping to transportation to even getting us a table at the famous El Celler de can Roca. It was not only about making arrangements, but knowing the quality of things you are expecting and pointing you in the right direction. 

Dining wise, loved their breakfast because it's situated in an area flushed with skylight with very comfortable furniture and serves till 11am without complaints even if you arrive at 11am. Had dinner at Moments, their Michelin 2-star restaurant, and was generally happy from its food through its service. 

Where some extra work is needed are the rooms and housekeeping. Nothing disastrous just that I think a Mandarin Oriental should do better in this respect. The way the rooms were serviced varied (e.g. turndown service didn't consistently close the blackout curtains) and could be a bit more attentive to detail. Gooseneck bedside reading lamps that have become too loose to be adjusted along with other minor maintenance issues. Again, probably way better than 99% of hotels in Barcelona, just think a MO should do better. 

Stayed 6 nights in their Deluxe Boulevard Room (couldn't get upgraded) and booked through Amex Platinum.",5,2016,02,22
44,Great new hotel. Good location,Great location. Funky setup in rooms. Beds could be better. Great staff. Very modern and minimalist. Cool decour. Excellent concierge in Claudio. Cool bankers bar when they dont rent it out. Great breakfast. ,4,2016,02,20
44,What's not to love??,"We visited the hotel with my husband and two daughters in the middle of summer and I was so happy we did!
On top of the usual wonderful things every Mandarin Oriental offers, which are many and all delightful, the fact that they have a rooftop swimming pool made our visit even better. Barcelona can be extremely hot during the summer months and not many hotels give you the chance to have a splash at the pool when you're just too hot and want a break. Location is perfect, service is impeccable, and our rooms were lovely. They were even waiting for us with personalized cookies for our daughters! We absolutely loved our experience at the Mandarin Oriental, and can't wait to go back soon. ",5,2016,02,18
44,Random TIPS and observations after a redeye flight,"I stayed in the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona for 4 nights.  I flew in off a redeye from New York and since my wife booked our room through Amex Platinum, we were eligible to get an early check in at noon and an upgraded room, though both were subject to availability.  Unfortunately, we didn’t receive either.  My wife and daughter spent about 2 hours sleeping on one of the sofas downstairs while we were waiting for our room.  Despite my multiple inquiries to the front desk, we weren’t actually let into our room until 2:45pm (official check-in is at 3pm). 

In the meantime, the friendly staff suggested I use the fitness center to take a shower while we waited for our room.  The lockers have a programmable lock and the shower facilities were pretty good.  Although they had disposable toothbrushes and hairbrushes, there were no disposable razor/shaving cream, and no slippers.

While initially waiting for our room, we decided to visit Casa Batllo, which is a famous house designed by Antoni Gaudi.   The building is extremely close to the hotel… across the street and no more than a 5 minute walk.   One TIP is to get your entry vouchers from the concierge (they will add the cost to your bill and give you a voucher) so you can skip the general line.  Take your voucher to the VIP line and you will be escorted to the front window where you show your voucher and get your tickets and then directly enter the building.  I had asked the concierge if there was a discount for my 11 year old, and he said no, but it turns out he was incorrect.  However, the additional 2 euros I ended up paying was more than worth it to avoid the long general entry line.

The hotel is in an excellent location. The nearest subway station is Passeig de Gracia, which services 3 lines:  L2 (purple), L3 (green), and L4 (yellow).  There are 2 entrances near the hotel.  If you’re taking the L2 or L4 lines, turn left when exiting the hotel. You will cross a small street and then a larger street.  The entrance is just past the larger street (subway stations are denoted by a red “M” inside a white diamond inside a red square).  There is a fountain in the middle of the street that you can use as a landmark, though it’s not always on.  It takes probably 5 minutes or less to get to the station. TIP:  the entrance that is closest to the hotel is near the L2 (purple) line and is called the Sortida Pau Claris exit.  If you’re planning to use the L3 (green) line, then head to the right when leaving the hotel (it’s an even shorter distance to the station).  The other major TIP I would recommend is paying for the T-10 tickets (you get 10 one way rides per ticket) from the subway machines.  I investigated buying other special cards for tourists but concluded it was a waste of money.  The T-10 tickets average slightly less than 1 euro per trip.  So unless you’re planning on taking 7 one way trips in a day, just buy more T-10 tickets as you run out.  The other nice thing is that you can use one card for multiple family members.  So, for example, if I have a T-10 card, I insert it into the turnstile and it comes out a different end.  I grab the card, the gates open (see the arrow towards the bottom of the turnstile to figure out if it’s the gate to your right or left), and a family member goes through.  I then reinsert the card and do the same thing for each family member.  The display lets you know how many rides you have left.  When you arrive at your destination, you do not need to reinsert the card in any turnstile. 

I’ve stayed at other Mandarin Oriental Hotels, and as expected this one had phenomenal service.  Everyone was extremely friendly and went out of their way to help.  I liked the handwritten welcome note from the general manager and we received a complimentary fruit tray.  

Though we didn’t get a formal upgrade, I still liked our room, which was larger than I had expected.  We were pleasantly surprised to find a king bed as well as a formal twin bed for my daughter, the latter of which was not formally requested but was much appreciated.  The room also had a small terrace that overlooked the inner garden.  Our room’s décor was very black and white in color and the ceiling was quite high.  The furniture was modern, including many features with rounded edges.  The main wall had alternating recessed followed by protruded wall segments, which I haven’t seen before in a hotel room.  One minor complaint was the very loud clanging noise that occurred when closing the various closet doors.  A plastic bumper at the contact points would be a quick solution to decrease the noise. 

The bathroom was fairly spacious.  I liked the 7-foot-long heated bar, which was especially handy for drying swimsuits.  The toilet was in a separate enclosed space. There was a very long tub and a large shower area contained a powerful waterfall showerhead located high above, with a light in the middle that made it seems like the sun was shining through the water and also made for an interesting geometric pattern on the shower floor.  

We used the concierge a lot.  They all spoke fluent English and were quite helpful.  Some gave slightly incorrect advice, such as telling me to get off at a certain subway stop when going to the FC Barcelona game.  Since 90% of the people got off the train the stop before the one the concierge told us to get off on, we did as well and just followed them.  There is no business center, but you can forward items for the concierge to print, such as museum tickets.   

The fitness center was a bit disappointing for me, though I’m a work out junkie.  There were 2 treadmills, 3 bicycles, 2 elliptical machines, a dumbbell rack, and cable like machine (the Kinesis Personal by TechnoGym).  The fitness center was in a pretty small room and was uncomfortably warm, at least for me.  The spa receptionist has a manual if you can’t figure out how to do various exercise on the Kinesis machine. The fitness center is available 24 hours though if you plan to use it during nonstandard hours you need to ask the front desk to program that into your room card key.   The indoor lap pool was heated.  I don’t know the depth, but my 11 year old had a full head above water.

Our room rate included full buffet breakfast, which was excellent and had lots of variety.  TIP: have churros dipped in chocolate after dinner at Xurreria Trebol.  This hole in the wall (no tables, 2 bar stools, and otherwise you stand) was worth the walk.  Dip the churros in the chocolate and then drink whatever is left.  This redefined the meaning of “hot chocolate” for me.  

Overall, this is an amazing hotel in a fantastic location with a superb staff.",5,2016,02,17
44,The best hotel service ,"We stayed for 2 night in our way to Malaga the service is great and the room very comfortable space and the breakfast is very healthy spa is very elegant and the treatment is worth trying 
Walking the shopping street no need for taxi every thing is just walking distant ",5,2016,02,17
44,Weekend Brunch,We were looking for a place to enjoy a full brunch. And we came across the brunch of this lovely Hotel. Very classy and they have everything form eggs benedict to huge pancakes. A bit pricy but totally worth it! Its right in the center so you can enjoy some shopping after.,5,2016,02,16
44,Perfect Modern Counterpoint to Gaudi's Barcelona,"Location is excellent, and the hotel comes with the typically unsurpassed standards of the Mandarin Oriental. What makes this property unique is its efficient design and space planning and impeccable interiors! I loved the tone-on-tone colour scheme, which through little nuances managed to look warm, inviting, and even quirky. 

The pool is also pretty awesome, as was the Spa.",5,2016,02,15
44,Wonderful choice!,"We stayed here for a week before leaving on a Disney Cruise.  The hotel was clean, modern, and luxurious. Rooms are a bit small, but well equipped. Concierge was extremely helpful with advice and booking local attractions, and the breakfast buffet each morning was delicious and varied.  The location of this hotel was in a safe and clean neighbourhood, walking distance to upscale shopping and restaurants.  A wonderful choice!",5,2016,02,10
44,Drive for perfection ,"We had a wonderful stay at the Mandarin. The location of the hotel is great, with fantastic shopping all around. The hotel itself is an oasis of calm, with the team looking after you like royalty. It already starts with the doorman Alberto, who immediately recognises you when you return to the hotel, and the wonderful reception team with Miriam the reception manager who made checking in super smooth. 

Whether it is in the sleek Bankers Bar or in the Bistreau restaurant the staff is spoiling you: Rafael and Miguel (great negronis!) in the bar, Erhan, Jesus and Theo in the bistro are all so personable and professional. 

It seems that everybody has only one thing on their mind: making your stay a great one. And they succeeded. From the concierge team to house keeping to the Moments team, a job very well done.  ",5,2016,02,08
44,Excellent Barcelona Hotel,"Great hotel at a great location. Excellent staff and service
We stayed in 2 hotels during a family holiday this Feb and the Mandarin was a clear winner 
Will return in future visits to Barcelona. A meal at the El Nationale next door is recommended",5,2016,02,08
44,"Excellent service, location and food","The hotel is absolutely fantastic, the service, the food, the attention to every little detail, the amenities, the location ... i could go on and on.  Apart from the size of the rooms, which could be small and at times odd shaped, and the lack of TV channels (frankly, i did not really felt the need to watch TV), everything else was smack on !  The most wonderful part was the service, everyone speaks perfect english and is ever ready to attend to any wish or need.   Try the rooms ending with '8' if you prefer larger bathrooms or rooms with balconies, which have a nice feel.  Great breakfast, a wide array of health food.  A true luxury experience well suited to the charm and happy nature of Barcelona !",5,2016,02,08
44,Mandarin Barcelona Vacation,"Mandarin Hotel is a fantastic hotel. I personally think the service is a little too expensive this makes a little disturbed but the luxury inside is wonderful and highly appreciative. In my case when they told us that we have to pay about 2000 more euros and if we left to another hotel they were gonna charge us a penalty of 2500 euros this wasn't a nice entry but, overall I think this hotel has a very organized and rooms are very well and service was just the beginning not so good, but it got better through time and it is close to many stores. So it is worth it in total I really enjoyed it.",4,2016,02,04
44,Truly a gem hotel - absolutely perfect!,"One of the absolute greatest experiences I have ever encountered! I would like to congratulate the team and the GM for delivering such a perfect product. It is difficult to create a perfect experience that meets all standards and expectations, and MO Barcelona truly has accomplished this. When I think of this hotel, I think of synchronization. Every member of the team provided genuine, timely, and defect free service. All employees were on the same page - communicating so well the guest needs and wishes amongst each other. I have only experienced this in Bangkok and Hong Kong thus far.
The Mandarin Oriental hotel chain continues to deliver and define luxury. I've stayed at a number of their properties worldwide and it's always an exceptional experience. This gem property is strategically located to give you access to the main city centers & attractions. The reception and concierge were very delightful to deal with, curating a perfect itinerary for a 3 day stay. 
Room was overlooking the main shopping district and extremely quiet, which was important. I spent a great amount of time in the room and felt refreshed after a great nights sleep. The spa and pool facilities were very relaxing and spacious. The breakfast buffet setup was delicious. The hotel definitely has a boutique feel about it & I love the personalized service delivered. One of the highlights of the trip was indeed the friendliness, professionalism, and attentiveness of the staff. Thank you Mandarin Oriental Barcelona for such a memorable experience and congratulations!",5,2016,02,04
44,One Night Celebration Visit,"I have just experienced the perfect hospitality at the Mandarin Oriental. Every single detail is taken care of, the room was spacious and we had our every need met there. The booking with Sofia in advance was a complete joy as she responded to my requests via email, a refreshing cup of tea as we signed in served with a smile! Later on we were overwhelmed with the surprise in our room to help our celebration. The staff were an absolute joy from start to finish. The gentleman who looked after our bags until our flight was the most polite and helpful porter I have ever encountered. Your cake was divine. Thank you for making our visit perfectly memorable in every way. Can't wait to return with more time to enjoy your amenities! You touched our hearts thank you.",5,2016,01,28
44,Wonderful Interior Design and Service,"We stayed in three different rooms at the Mandarin over a month long tour and the interior design of each room was unique, high end, functional and beautiful.  When I came home to my own house, it felt like a dump! 

The hotel is expensive, but compared to other companies/hotels at the same price point, I feel the hotel is a good value. 

The staff is very nice, everyone speaks CAT EN and ESP perfectly.  There is good security level at the hotel also.

Our stay was fantastic, but I do have suggestions for the management:

Humans have overfished Beluga sturgeon, so Beluga caviar is illegal.  Yet the menu in one of your restaurants advertises it. I have a picture of the menu.  I ate the dish, and I do not believe what was served was truly wild Beluga.  Please have a little truth in advertising, and do not serve food made from endangered species.

There is no business center, please make one. Or provide mini printers in each room.   If you have a sensitive/private document you need to print, the front desk has to print it out for you. I did not like that. 

The toilet paper is not soft like my American behind is used to.  This is a spoiled rich man issue, lol. I know EU utilities and plumbing are different than in the USA.",5,2016,01,20
44,Super in every detail,"This is a very stylish hotel with a very great attention to all details. Some off the most friendly hotel staff I have come along. Great, quite room (to the back). Good gym with relatively new equipment from Tecnogym. OKish indoor pool. Breakfast was great with choice for every taste. Be aware that they use room perfume everywhere which might become a bid annoying. Would definitely stay there again for business.",5,2016,01,14
44,Excellent - a perfect choice,"We spent a weekend for a special birthday of my wife in Barcelona and, as always wenn there is a Mandarin (other than in NYC), we chose the Mandarin and it was a perfect choice (as expected).

The location is conveniently in the city center, the rooms are nicely designed and spacious (we had a Mandarin Room with a nice little balcony), the service was perfect and the Spa and indoor pool were also very nice.

For my wife's birthday, we got a complimentary bottle of Cava and a little cake - a nice touch.

We will definitly stay there again, when we make it to Barcelona the next time.",5,2016,01,13
44,Perfect perfect perfect!,"To the hotel manager
Dear sir 
Congratulations for the perfect management of this hotel. I am a regular visitor of Mandarin hotels and you expect to have a high level of service but in our short stay at you hotel your team has surpassed our expectation in every aspect. 
From the doormen, the concierge, bar staff everybody has been fantastic trying to accommodate our every wish and most importantly try to foresee our every wish. 
Well done sir and you can be sure we will be back again soon. 
See you 
 ",5,2016,01,06
44,Exceptional hosting place,"You should not hesitate to go to the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona. The Concierge's services were at utmost quality and kindness even with new clients staying only a couple of days ! 
We enjoyed it so much, we won't hesitate to return to the Mandarin Oriental. 
(...ok it's expensive, but money isn't an issue regarding the high quality services provided by all the team of the hotel...) ",5,2016,01,06
44,Very swank,"My husband and I spent three nights here while expiring Barcelona.   Beautiful hotel, great location.  We really loved the roof top deck/bar.  The bar on the main level is very cool also.
Our room was very contemporary, which is our style. Not huge, but well appointed
Definitely recommend",5,2016,01,02
44,Did not want  leave,"Everything expressed by prior reviews are on the mark. We wenrt as a family of four and we only stay at 5 star hotels. We have stayed at MOs in Munich, San Francisco, and Boston and this was the best. The buffet breakfast was so great it held us over until dinner. It was the best buffet breakfast we have seen. The Bankers Bar is great to unwind at and if you love gin as we do, they make the best gin and tonics and martinis. The bartender allowe dme t try 4 gins to determine which on eto order. As for the concierge, they are second to none. I dealt primarily with Rodrigo who scored us tickets to a FC Barcelona game and a great guide to tour the Gaudi masterpieces. There is no other other option in Barcelona if you are willing to pay the price. It is worth it.",5,2016,01,02
44,New Year's Eve at Banker's Bar: pretty disappointing,"The location is the best in Barcelona, where we live. We decided to celebrate New Year's Eve at Banker's Bar with some friends, having some drinks. I called a week before and the receptionist that answered took note of my name as pre-reservation, even though I was advised that no official reservations were accepted that night.
When we arrived, the person-in-charge, a rude guy told us that my name wasn't in any list and that no table was available for us. My partie had to sit down in the terrace waiting for a free table inside. I have to say that the waiter's manners were so disappointing, making us to feel completely foolish. I understand that hotel's customers  have preference, of course, but it is unacceptable to be treated in this way. ",3,2016,01,02
44,Christmas Vacation in Barcelona,"As a family of four, all adults, we opted to spend Christmas in Barcelona at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. We stayed a week and found the hotel excellent in all respects. The staff was the most attentive I've ever encountered in any hotel anywhere in the world. The location was great as it was close to many of the places we wanted to see. The hotel itself had excellent amenities and we ended up having Christmas dinner in one of the restaurants.

I'd highly recommend it. it is expensive but worth every Euro!!

",5,2015,12,30
44,Perfection,"The hotel is expensive, but you get what you pay for.  The staff are helpful and friendly, the service is excellent, the facilities are superb, the location is central yet the rooms are quiet.  The Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is as near to perfection as a hotel can get.",5,2015,12,29
44,The Best!,"What a fabulous hotel. The location is superb, right in the middle of the city centre.
The service and attention to detail from the lovely staff is second to none.
We were related very well.
The rooms are superb. Plenty of space and everything you could ask for.
I would highly recommend this hotel for a city visit.",5,2015,12,29
44,Definitely one of the very best hotels in Barcelona,"As a regular guest at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona I can now confirm it is certainly the best hotel in that wonderful city. The location is superb, on the beautiful Passeo de Gracia main shopping artery... the architects and decorators have surpassed themselves. The rooms are splendidly equipped, and enjoy many amenities, they are also exceptionally sound proof. Modern design prevails, superb confort is the rule.
The staff is attentive, the food and service excellent",5,2015,12,20
44,The Mandarin Oriental brand is second to none!,"Our first trip to Barcelona had started very badly thanks to Booking.com messing up our hotel bookings so we found ourselves searching for accommodation at 1am and made a hasty booking at the Mandarin Oriental as we are big fans of this hotel brand.

However, they too were unable to offer us the room category that we showed them we had booked online so perhaps it was simply a Barcelona hotels technical issue than a Booking.com technical issue!

The bad news is that they were unable to find us suitable rooms for 1.5 hours and we were beyond tired and fast losing patience by then. There was a member of staff on duty that evening whose name i don't recall, but she did very little to rectify the situation. However, the Night Duty Manager then threw in some extras to compensate for the very long delay and the apologetic follow up from the Daytime Duty Manager was outstanding the next day. 

Infact, Management upgraded us to the best suite in their hotel the following day, the Barcelona Suite, which is normally priced at EUR4,500 a night and the experience was simply incredible! The suite itself was large enough to be a luxury apartment and was outstanding. We were offered amazing service from thereon in and i must say, the Management staff are simply fantastic and exceeded service expectations. 

The Chef went out of his may to make us any special requests we had and the suite was in a private part of the hotel with its own set of private elevators, so it was beautifully secluded. The hotel is very centrally located in the Passeig de Gracia and is right in the heart of exclusive restaurants, malls, banks and other services so you could walk everywhere within 5 minutes. There is also a taxi rank outside the hotel so it is ultra convenient in every way. 

Obviously, at a hotel of this caliber, they charge for absolutely everything to the point that it becomes outrageous, so do be aware of the fine print. It is definitely a hotel the rich, famous and beautiful people frequent. 

One of the rooms we were in (not the Barcelona Suite) did have a faulty shower and a grimy window sill. The room was also tiny which was disappointing given that even the standard rooms at this hotel cost in the region of EUR400 a night.

However, the Mandarin Oriental brand is high-end and are experienced at dealing with celebrities and high profile individuals every day. The Management team's impeccable service rectified a bad situation quickly and we left at the end of our stay, feeling wonderful. We will definitely be back.",5,2015,12,18
44,Perfection in Barcelona,"The hotel exceeded our expectations on so many levels.  When you are whisked in upon your arrival, you feel like you've entered into some surreal dream.  The staff immediately checks you in, shows you the property before escorting you to your very quiet room where you can completely decompress from the stresses of the world.  We stayed here 5 nights and were pampered by the staff who anticipated every need.  The doormen were delightful and extremely helpful with directions and the housekeeping never wavered on keeping our room clean and fully stocked. But the Comcierge was simply incomparable to any I've ever seen. His attitude was ""nothing is too much"" and he greeted us by name every single time we passed the station.  He secured us reservations at the best restaurants months in advance and landed us incredible tickets to the FCB match.  We really can't say enough about the service at this hotel and our overall experience.  Highly recommended for anyone who wants top notch service and quality while staying in the best area of Barcelona.",5,2015,12,18
44,Large room and nice location ,Hotel is centrally located at the heart of shopping areas. Excellent services as the bell boy standing at the hotel entrance kindly offered to bring our shopping bags to our room as we passed by the hotel so that  we could continue with our shopping spree. Excellent spread of breakfast choices as well. Loved our 2 days stay but too bad it is a business trip and not my personal holiday.,5,2015,12,15
44,one night in barcelna,"too short a stay to say, first impressions favourable, decent place and staff, mostly genuinely charming, attentive, discrete, bar the odd detail, perhaps more experienced serving staff, geared to high end and high cost yet warm and welcoming all round. my visit was in low season which made it nicely quiet and peaceful, i enjoyed no music or noise, and the terraces to myself and my tea. it warrants a second visit. ",4,2015,12,12
44,One of the Best,Staying in this hotel is like being treated as well as you would be if you stayed at the Inn on Fifth In Naples Florida. Attention to detail all upscale amenities and a staff that leaves you saying wow. Well done Mandarin Oriental.,5,2015,12,08
44,Excellent service,"I was so happy and impressed with how I was received at check in. I have been to other MO properties where Mr. Greg Liddell was the GM and he has always been the most incredible host. I didn't realise he was now at Barcelona MO until he personally welcomed me and made me feel so welcomed and special. The whole experience was fantastic. My room, the service, the food and facilities. I'll certainly be back for the 6 star experience. ",5,2015,12,06
44,Exceptional property and service,Thus us the second  time we stayed here and it just gets better. Room was comfortable  and dead silent. Staff ultra friendly and discrete. Room has done unusual electrical controls that take some getting used to. Great shower. Minor criticism: vanity mirror not illuminated. Also in fantastic shopping Area. Recommended for any trip to the city ,5,2015,12,05
44,great,"We love mandarin oriental, but barcelona miss a little bit the level of service of the other mandarin we have been around. In our city its actually one of the best ever.
We have stayed in a normal room the first 2 nights and then moved to suite. The suites are great, the normal rooms a bit old, thats why we changed.",4,2015,12,05
44,"beautiful room, great location, not 5 star staff","Excellent welcome at reception, perfect hotel  location in the center of the city. Our room in the new wing was beautiful -  spacious, comfortable beds,  great closets, gorgeous bathroom in our Mandarin room - loved it and I am particular. 
Our issue was with the concierge staff communication leading up to our stay. Staff assured me that they could help secure a difficult to get dinner reservation, but they dropped the ball. I emailed to follow up and was ignored. Finally a rude response from Albert Perez with the head concierge copied. False information about the sister restaurant being booked as well, it was not. My travel consultant suggested I discuss with the Guest Relations manager, Thais Guerrero. But, Thais Guerrero  simply forwarded my email back to the offending concierge staff with a perfunctory apology, no explanation, and no attempt to make the calls or help secure the reservation or any of the restaurants in this group. The reservation was not important, there are so many great restaurant in Barcelona - but what was notable was the  inexcusable behavior from the concierge and guest relations manager. By the way, the front desk welcome by Johannes was outstanding, as were the rest of the staff at the hotel. The Mandarin Barcelona has to do better - it was an unpleasant and unwelcoming feeling to arrive and have to deal with this concierge staff that is not well suited for a hotel of this quality. A first for me, have always had outstanding experiences with concierge staff in our travels. 
So - if you plan to stay at this hotel - book a room in the new wing, worth it. Make your own dinner reservations if possible, if they haven't already changed their concierge staff. You are on your own,the Guest Relations Manager, should you need it, is completely unhelpful.

44,The must stay hotel in Barcelona,"The hotel is in the perfect position, however inside it is so quiet you would never think you are in heart of the city! The hotel is stunning in every detail, and the staff is just what you would expect. The only tiny detail I could find is that there was no light on the balcony of our suite therefore in the evening it was hard to read on it.....but that is all! Wonderful property and wonderful experience, I would recommend this hotel to anyone, regardless of the reason of their trip!",5,2015,12,01
44,Luxury Surrounded by Gaudi,"From the minute you walk into the fragrance-scented passageway of this elegant property you know you are in capable, experienced hands.  The service starts with a welcoming cup of tea and continues throughout all parts of the hotel.  We found the concierge very helpful and knowledgeable, and we loved the rooftop bar experience.  This hotel is located within walking distance of several Gaudi masterpieces and excellent shopping.  One minor note to the modest:  the bathrooms lack soundproofing but they are very luxurious and well-appointed.",5,2015,11,28
44,Off the scale! ,"From stylish reception to opulent suites this is a truly fine hotel. The quality of service, food, guest services and its fantastic central location makes this an aspirational hotel visit! If your budget allows, stay nowhere else in Barcelona! ",5,2015,11,28
44,WOW!,"Was here for a quick business trip.  After a long international flight, I was eager to settled into the Mandarin Barcelona.  The check-in was swift and I was able to get a quick nap before business meetings.  I would be hard-pressed to come up with any complaints.  My suite didn't have a coffee machine.  I know it's a luxury hotel, but sometimes I just don't want to wait for something this simple to be delivered and served.

The hotel had so many amenities I didn't get to try out.  Will definitely return to this hotel for pleasure.",5,2015,11,28
44,Beyond expectations,"I have always loved the Mandarin Oriental Hotel group. But the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona exceeded my expectations. From the moment I arrived until I left, the service was faultless. My suite,renovated recently, is breathtaking and inviting and has a balcony that looks into the delighfully peaceful mimosa garden. There's also a goreous living area with a dining table that can easily six. It goes without saying that flatscreen TV, ipod dock, WIFI and internet access are included. Suite guests also have access to the fabulous butler service. Breakfasts are a delight - you get to enjoy chef Angel Leon's stunning breads based on sea-flavours. Moments, the hotel's fine dining restaurant, is world class. Helmed by Raul Balam, son of Michelin star chef and much-respected Carme Ruscalleda, the restaurant has one Michelin star. i had a 'crystal' puff pastry topped with prawns and also the most divine squab worth crossing the world for. What a hotel! What an experience!",5,2015,11,27

44,Excellence personified ,"It's about the people. I would expect a five star hotel, particularly one with the pedigree of Mandarin to be physically spot on. This hotel is and some. The ambiance is soothing, sophisticated and reassuring, the fittings high quality and stylish. 

My room on the fourth floor although compact was beautifully appointed. The rain shower superb.

It's about the people... Everyone I met on the hotel team were professional, knowledgable and above all charming. Excellent, simply excellent. Good effort team, good effort. ",5,2015,11,22

44,Awesome Hotel!,"Best hotel I have stayed so far. great location, great decor, great service! The service is impeccable. The warm service can be felt right from the greetings at the drop off to the service personnel to housekeeping. Checking in was a ease although we have quite a big group. The rooms are spacious with very contemporary and tasteful decoration and are extremely comfortable.
What really impressed me was the honesty of the hotel staff and their prompt response. Left my wallet behind in the hotel room and only realised it a day later. They responded quickly when I contacted them despite it being a weekend and the housekeeping staff had returned it to the front desk. The hotel is really remarkable!",5,2015,11,07
44,Best hotel in Barcelona,"Mandarin Oriental Barcelona will make you feel like a royalty. The staff of the hotel will remember your name the second you stepped in and will do their best to make your stay a great experience.
The concierge team is amazing, each one of them, they have always been helpful with any requests and bookings.
Great housekeeping! We are late sleepers and therefore i was surprised by the fact that we have never been disturbed by a vacuum cleaner or any other cleaning noise which is normally a case in other hotels. I have also never seen a housekeeping trolley in the corridor, nevertheless our room has always been perfectly clean and tidy, two times a day. 
The rooms are nicely designed, light, modern and quite spacious. The only downside was the bathroom design, as i believe already mentioned by other travelers. There is no privacy in the bathroom due to frost glass doors and also there is no way to turn on the shower without getting wet.
The location - can't be better, it is in the middle of the main shopping street with lots of restaurants around; Casa Batillo is 2 mins away and you can even walk to the old town and La Rambla in about 20 mins.
The hotel is quite pricey but you do get what you paid for. I would definitely return on a next trip to Barcelona.",5,2015,11,04
44,Great weekend,"Excellence with a warm delicate service.   
The service is impeccable and rooms are spectacularly done.    The renovated suites are extremely comfortable, spacious and very contemporary in their decoration.     Food is exquisite with a great service.

44,Not up to Mandarin standards,"We stayed at this hotel Friday night and were very disappointed.  We have stayed in multiple Mandarins and usually love the experience.  Barcelona did not make the grade.  We arrived early and were shown a very noisy room on the ground floor.  The room was tired with chips in the sink, on the mirror and faded spots on the wood floor.  I went to the spa for a treatment looking forward to the usual Manadrin experience but was also disappointed.  In order to use the steam room before my treatment, I had to be escorted from the female changing room to the steam room as only the attendants with a special key can get in.  You'd think this made it exclusive but no, it was impossible to relax as it's beside the pool which was full of noisy children.  Add to that the steam room was tired and dirty similar to the room.  My massage itself was fabulous and the therapist did a great job so she did redeem the experience for me.  However, at breakfast the next morning we had another bad experience where the waiter comes to our table to inform us that the buffet was closing in 5 minutes so we'd better get what we want now.  I've never seen this at a 5 star hotel and was frankly shocked.  Plus, this was after we waited several minutes to have our order taken.  
All in all, I will not be returning to the MO Barcelona.",2,2015,11,01
44,The hotel in Barcelona,"The hotel to be in the Golden Mille in the center of Barcelona. 
As in all the Mandarin Oriental's hotels service is great. 
Don't expect big rooms if booking a regular room but they have the most amazing suites in town. 
At the Biatrau restaurant breakfast is great and a good place to meet for breakfast meetings. 
When in spring enjoy Mimosa terrace and the roof top pool. 
Spa service very good. 
Maybe you are lucky enough to take a yoga class by Xuan Yoga-Lan. ",5,2015,10,31

Everyone knew our names almost immediately.  The Concierge service, especially Alberto, were terrific and the gal in the fitness centre was extremely helpful.  The one downside is the restaurant, a Michelin 2 star where we had an advance reservation, does not open for dinner until 8:30 pm, much too late for normal travellers.  As a result we ate in the Bistro but the menu was limited and the steak was tough.  The wine list was good though.",5,2015,10,30
44,In the middle of all the excitement...,"We are fans of the Mandarin Oriental hotels, our favorite being in London.  So we knew that our stay in Barcelona would be a good one.

The hotel location is definitely in the middle of it all.  If you're looking for quiet and serene, this may not be the hotel for you.  Although once inside, they've done a decent job of separating the city from the attempted 'zen' experience.

The check-in/check-out staff was very helpful and accommodating.  Our room was not ready until almost 4:30pm, which was a bit disappointing, but we enjoyed having a drink in their main bistro, which is very relaxing.

The room itself was nice.  We were facing the main city street, which was a bit loud, but the windows did a pretty good job of keeping the noise at bay.
There were some interesting features about the room...  cool lighting, several storage spaces, accessible outlets and a very modern feel.

My one complaint about the rooms were the bathrooms.  They are designed to be modern and minimal...using a lot of frosted glass.  Unfortunately, this doesn't afford one much privacy while in there.  Also, there is no shower door, and you can't turn on the showerhead without getting wet (you have to go under the showerhead to get to the handle).  I often like to steam clothes in the shower when traveling, so this was a bit of a hassle.

The room service was tasty and prompt, and the bellhops were very friendly.  We also had a situation where the hotel had to hold our luggage while we spent a couple days in Costa Brava, and they were very accommodating with this request.

I enjoyed people-watching in the lobby as well.  I have to say, the poshest of the posh seem to stay here, and it was fascinating to see all the different kinds of guests.

I would definitely recommend staying here if you're looking for a posh hotel in the midst of bustling Barcelona.",4,2015,10,29
44,There is no other choice,"If you are looking for phenomenal service, great ambience, delicious meals and an incredible experience, book a room now. The location of the hotel is perfect, in the middle of the Eixample district, which is bustling and beautiful. It is two blocks from Casa Batlo, one of the premiere sights in Barcelona. This particular streeet is in a very upscale area and full of great restaurants, cafes, and wonderful for strolling. The staff is second to none: top notch service and attentive, professional service. Customer service is obviously a priority and for me, worth every penny. The hotel is more pricey than some but the saying, you get what you pay for, applies here. The restaurants in the hotel are excellent: we had breakfast twice in Bistreau and dinner at Moments. The buffet breakfast is outstanding. Moments' ambience is very special and the food very gourmet. The Spa was also very good, although its odd layout in the bottom of the hotel, was a bit too dark for my tastes.

We also made use of the pool in The Spa which was lovely. The room was a good size and tastefully decorated. We had our 9 year old son with us and the hotel treated him so well.

The breakfast spread was truly incredible- it's really expensive, but was included with our room.  The location is fabulous - you are in the heart of everything, with easy access to pretty much everything you'd want to see.

The fitness and indoor pool are fabulous. The breakfast buffet is delicious",5,2015,10,09
44,Right across the street from Gaudi's Casa Batllo,"It's hard to find fault with this spectacular property. The location, service, decor are all perfect. I emailed the concierge 4 weeks before arriving and all my restaurant requests were made. I called housekeeping for a different pillow and it arrived in 2 minutes, not 20. The Breakfast buffet is fabulous. A few things I didn't like: the heavy perfume they spray throughout the lobby (why or why are properties doing this now?)!  The dim lighting in our room, how the toilet is separate than the shower. The toilet ""room"" is quite small  ",5,2015,10,08
44,Fine Choice for Busy Barcelona,"This is a very fine hotel located on the very trafficky Passeig de Gracia. It is set back from the street and is designed as a peaceful island in the city.  We stayed for three nights before leaving on a cruise and enjoyed the service and amenities.  At check-in, we were told the AmEx Platinum upgrade was not available and we had a smaller room on a lower floor facing the rear of the hotel.  The adjoining rooms seemed to have a decent balcony but not our room.  During the day, there is a school playground which generates a good deal of noise and, in hindsight, we should have asked to see more rooms with less noise.  The room included an outstanding buffet breakfast in the main dining room.  The rooftop deck and pool is nice but fairly compact and was very breezy during our stay.  It has, however, great views.  The first night, we ate a light dinner in the Banker's Bar which was really good -- nice jazz group playing too.  We were able to walk everywhere including to the beach and the Gothic neighborhood.  There are many very good choices for dinner within a couple of blocks too.",4,2015,10,06
44,Top notch as expected!,"We have stayed at MO before in Hong Kong and Singapore.  As expected, the service and amenities were impeccable.  The concierge was particularly helpful in planning our sightseeing (and booking advance tickets to the Gaudi landmarks).  

The location was perfect for shopping and sightseeing.  Old Town and several Gaudi exhibits are within walking distance, as well as all of the high end shops.

The breakfast buffet is open until 11am, with friendly staff and a solid buffet selection.  The rooftop bar is a great place to relax with a great view (though the drinks are not inexpensive - roughly EUR20 for a cocktail).

Only drawbacks I would say is that our room was somewhat smaller than other MOs we have stayed at, and the bathroom design was a bit awkward without sufficient ventilation.  

In any event, could not think of a better place to stay in Barcelona!

",5,2015,10,02
44,Really lovely people; some pros and cons otherwise,"First of all, the positives  You will not find friendlier, more smiley, courteous, gracious, warm, welcoming, and overall lovely hotel staff anywhere.  The people and the service are definitely the MO Barcelona's strong points.  I was there for a few days, and by the end of my first day I felt as if nearly everyone at the hotel recognised me and made a point of striking up conversation while also asking whether I was happy there and had everything I needed. 

My room was on the seventh floor, overlooking the Passeig de Gracia, and the views were amazing.  

The breakfast buffet was very good; my friends and I stayed too late every morning (because the food and service and atmosphere were so pleasant!), but the staff never made us feel rushed, and even asked whether we wanted another coffee or anything else before we left.

My friends and I had an excellent dinner one evening at Moments, the hotel's showcase restaurant.  We also enjoyed drinks one evening in the Banker's Bar, where the maitre d' could not have been more funny and charming.  Lunch on the roof terrace was lovely too.

We all enjoyed the spa services, including facials, massages, and the Bastien manicure/pedicure, administered by top-notch technicians.

The cons are few, and their importance will depend on what you value most in a luxury hotel.  The rooms are very small, and they are showing their age a bit.  The bed pillows were weirdly uncomfortable (I found them too thick and firm). Also, there is a bit more noise from room to room and from floor to floor than I would have expected in a hotel of this calibre.  (I was awakened at 5:30 one morning by what sounded like furniture being moved around overhead, but it may just have been guests packing up and departing with luggage.) Again, this will bother some people more than others.",4,2015,10,02
44,The best in Barca,"This hotel has always been a favourite of mine, but now the extension of suites is open it is stunning and takes the experience to a whole new level. I loved how the flavours of Barcelona Modernist life have been mixed with Mandarin style and elegance. The staff are some of the friendliest I have encountered in Spain and the breakfast is just amazing with no rush to leave at the end of service either. Sadly I was only here for 1 night whilst in Sitges but definitely a hotel to come back too and personally one of the best GM's in the business.",4,2015,10,02
44,just great in every way,The staff in this hotel all deserve a raise. Every single person we encountered was upbeat smiling and could not wait to help us in any way possible. We ran into only some very minor issues but when brought to the staffs attention they were rectified instantly. All I can say is wow nice place I'll be back and will tell everyone I can,5,2015,10,01
44,Tranquil hideaway in bustling Barcelona,"We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for a weekend in mid-September, and found it to be an oasis in the middle of the busy streets of Barcelona! The hotel on the whole is very good, but there are some areas that disappointed...

Check in:
We arrived early, and our room was not ready. We did not mind this as it gave us an opportunity to have some lunch and to explore the local area. The hotel promised to telephone me when our room was ready. Four hours after originally checking-in the hotel had not called to tell us the room was ready. Despite this we went back and checked with the reception desk and we were told that our room was ready. It was disappointing that they did not call us to let us know that our room was ready, as they had promised.

Room:
We were upgraded to a Boulevard Suite, this was a reasonably big suite with a living area, bedroom and large bathroom which included a dressing room. The room was immaculately clean and very modern in style. Despite the room being on the first floor overlooking the busy Passeig de Gracia the room was well insulated from the noise on the street. What was disappointing was that the room we had originally booked had a balcony (a key amenity for us), and whilst this room was advertised as having a balcony, the balcony itself was tiny, and there was no room for a chair or table and it wasn't a place we could relax or enjoy.

Spa:
During our time at the hotel was used the Spa and indoor pool. The Spa staff were outstanding, some of the best I have come across. The treatments were excellent, and they really couldn't have been friendlier. This truly is a 5* spa!
The pool and steam room, located in the basement were also excellent, and with thoughtful touches like bottles of water by the side of the pool.

Food:
We took breakfast in the hotel whilst we were staying, there was an excellent selection of both hot and cold food on the buffet as well as an a la carte menu which you could order from. There was also a opportunity to sample the cuisine from the Hotel's Michelin starred restaurant, on the breakfast buffet - quite a treat!
Room service was less impressive, a burger that was requested to be well done came bloody in the middle, and the club sandwich was very disappointing - not a traditional club sandwich, but chicken and bacon in a bread roll, this was not a true club sandwich, and the quality of ingredients could have been better, it looked and tasted like no one had put any effort in, and reminded of a sandwich you might get at an airport for a few Euros.

Pool and Bar:
The rooftop pool and bar which is only open to residents during the day is a peaceful and relaxing oasis, enabling you to enjoy the city and then relax by the pool. It is quite a small space, but we always managed to find somewhere to relax in the sun!

In conclusion, the staff were, on the whole, outstanding, and very efficient, the hotel itself is modern, stylish, and chic. There are a number of areas where there could be improvement, and for a top ranked hotel they need to be looking to solve these problems in order to achieve perfection.",4,2015,09,30
44,Mandarin Oriental - Top Notch,"We stayed at the hotel for four nights and had a wonderful trip. The staff truly cares about your happiness and well being. We had many situations where the staff exceeded our expectations in catering to our needs. 

The Spa is fantastic and would recommend it to anyone looking for a luxury spa experience.

We will be back!",5,2015,09,30
44,"Superb location, service and amenities","If you can spring for the high cost, this hotel is tres chic and the location can't be beat.  The staff get 6 stars.  None better.  The amenities were outstanding.  Loved the buffet breakfast, roof bar, bed and linens.
It has a few drawbacks.  First is the cost.  Second, the rooms are high tech to the point of baffeling. We had to switch to a larger room because our first had no drawers anywhere/  We had trouble figuring out the light switches,  finding a way to wash our socks in the flat sink with no stopper, and could not dim the night lights without piling towels in front of the frosted glass walls in the bathroom.  If you like high style you won't mind.",5,2015,09,29
44,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.,I travel quite a bit and stay in top hotels in Europe and U.S.  The Mandarin Barcelona is a true five star hotel. The quality of the service is outstanding. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are thoughtfully designed with top notch amenities. The Mandarin Barcelona is the only hotel I will now stay with in Barcelona. ,5,2015,09,29
44,Great location and friendly staff ,"Was here for 2 days and the staff was very friendly . 4 of us arrived at the entrance and the bellman already greeted us and helped with the luggage. The reception and concierge was helpful and truly love their smile and the hospitality extended! I am going to have my bday on 3 oct and yesterday when I' was back to the room a complimentary champagne and a chocolate cake was placed in the room ! So surprised and warm! Location is perfect, it's very closed to some Gaudi architecture ! Definitely recommend this hotel ! ",5,2015,09,28
44,Most Convenient 5 Stars Hotel,"Mandarin Oriental always lives up to its reputation. Best location if you love shopping and food. After all it is situated at Passeig la Gracia. It's also near to the Cathedral, Rambla, St Joseph Market and other tourist attractions. Well trained and friendly staffs. I love their strawberry juice for breakfast and was told they made them in the kitchen. Love this hotel and the staffs.",5,2015,09,25
44,You can never go wrong with a MO hotel,"I absolutely loved this hotel. We are in our early 30's and sometimes get treated differently at these luxury resorts because of our age. I am happy to say this did NOT happen at MO Barcelona. The staff treated us with respect and the concierge staff were incredible. All of their recommendations exceeded our expectations. The breakfast was amazing, but make sure to go early as it can get quite crowded. The sheets and black out shades ensured a restful and plentiful slumber. The location was ideally situated. I cannot say enough wonderful things about this hotel.",5,2015,09,24
44,What a great hotel!,"This hotel is the best! Beautiful rooms, clean, and excellent staf. Friendly, attentive and willing to go the extra mile. It is perfectly situated in the middle of the nice shopping area of the busy Passeig the Gracia, but absolutely no noise in the rooms. Also the breakfast is great, and not to forget their splendid rooftop bar.
Unforgettable!",5,2015,09,22
44,In the Center of it all!,"We opted to have a car from the Mandarin pick us up a little pricy but worth every penny.
I'm sure you would be able to find a less expensive service but I wanted to be sure that our first impression of Barcelona  was perfect and it was. As for the Hotel Service was excellent as well as it should be when you spend that kind of money no regrets there. My only little problem was the sizes of the room but it was clean and confortable. Over all I would stay there again.",4,2015,09,22
44,Mandarin has always.,"Congratulations!
To all the team at MO Barcelona, they provide us a fabulous stay.
Our suite was exceptional and the Butler service outstanding.
If you find a free table at Moments, don't miss it.
I'll be back for sure in my future stay in Barcelona.",5,2015,09,17
44,Great alternative for a matching dinner,"From hotel main entrance to its big nice restaurant on first floor to its small roof top bar by the pool, you will enjoy a great dinner. Try the chef table dinner!! A new alternative just designed by its Michellin chef...you will really enjoy every single step. Except the chocolate ""salted"" dessert. I know salted desserts are becoming a trend, but personally, I didn't like it...even that you will have other great desserts to end a great dinner.
Cocktails at the top terrace are incredible expensive and basic...peanuts are hot, so I felt like having a Mexican food, which I don't personally like, but if you like spicy food, you'll enjoy them. 
In short, a nice alternative for creating a nice experience once in beautiful Barcelona.",5,2015,09,16
44,Three night visit in April 2015,"The Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Barcelona is super nice. The rooms and suites are immaculate in every respect. The concierge is most helpful as I do not speak Catalonian or Spanish. The breakfast buffet is more than I expected, quality and price wise. Do not stay here if you are on a tight budget. Two minor concerns: lifts (elevators) require your room keycard. The hotel bar is ok for beer and wine but they know very little about cocktails. Don't miss the roof terrace - splendid views and small wading pool. Enjoy!",5,2015,09,15
44,We always stayed there ,"It was our 3rd stay in oriental mandarin , it has the best location for those who love shopping , the location is amazing in the middle of the shopping centre but o feel that this time that the hotel really need maintenance , the shower was leaking through the room , there are some stains on the floor , i think its the time to re new that lovely hotel 

The staff are really friendly, kind and really helpful , the hotel had a very nice sitting area with a bar at the back yard , the thing i missed in almost all hotels in Europe the kids club room they should think about it specially for the family who's travel with kids anyway this time i gave the hotel 7/10 ",4,2015,09,15
44,Top notch service and facilities in an ideal location,"My 3 days stay at the MO was amazing, one of the best hotel experiences of my life.  We arrived in Barcelona at 7 am and the MO picked us up in a series 7 BMW with wet wash clothes and WiFi.  Our rooms were not ready at such an early hour, so they let us shower and change in the spa, eat complimentary breakfast at the restaurant, and then called us when they were ready.  The rooms are beautiful and not small as per other comments, decorated in Barcelona's modernist style.  The restaurant and upstair terrace were great dining and drinking options.  The location is FANTASTIC within walking distance of many major attractions, and on a street know for its architecture including two Gaudi buildings and shopping.  But the best part of this stay was the service - everyone was friendly and helpful all the time.  Few hotels offer this high quality service.  Thank you MO Barcelona for a great time.",5,2015,09,13
44,Spectacular Luxury Stay,"We decided to spend a couple days in a hotel in Barcelona as we were traveling to visit our family in the city and we wanted to have a relaxing stay without the kids.

I am from Barcelona and have stayed at other five star hotels, but wanted to stay at the Mandarin Oriental. We usually book through American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts and the Mandarin is part of it, so we decided to give it a try.

The Mandarin Oriental has the best location in Barcelona. Located in the Passeig de Gracia, you have all the main touristic destinations with easy reach as well as all the most exclusive stores around the corner.

The entrance of the hotel is breathtaking, the lobby is small but beautifully decorated. Check in was great, we did get an upgrade to the Deluxe Suite with views towards Passeig de Gracia and the room was just spectacular. The decor was beautifully done, the views unparalleled, there was fruit, chocolate and champagne in the room, which was a great touch.

The room came with butler service and even though we didn't need to use them too much, they were extremely attentive. We have traveled to many different luxury hotels and it was just comparable to the Aman resorts.

We had a couple drinks at the terrace and the views are breathtaking. 

We didn't make prior reservations at any of the restaurants, but they were able to accommodate us at the Moments restaurant at their first opening day after closing a few weeks over the summer. The experience was amazing, the quality and creativity of the food was outstanding. The chef came to introduce himself at the end which was a nice touch. We did love the last dessert which included a skyline of the main buildings in Barcelona made with different type of cookies. Very original. 

We were not able to use the treatments at the Spa as everything was booked, most likely due to the rainy weather outside, however we did enjoy the indoor pool and steam sauna.

Breakfast was great with a large selection of items, we loved the decor and ambiance of the restaurant.

Overall this has been one of the best stays in a hotel we have ever had. The room was fantastic and the best was the attention to detail and costumer service.",5,2015,09,12
44,Mandarin,"Great modern hotel. Small rooms , large bathroom. We received an upgrade for a room with a balcony facing the rear. Ok view , but added to the overall space. Great service and help from the staff. Great breakfast buffet. Great location. Expensive. Recommended.",5,2015,09,12
44,Excellent hotel,"Very nice hotel, good location, very good service of the staff, excellent breakfast and very peaceful restaurant.Short way to shops, old town, metro station. Quiet rooms. Very highly recommend in Barcelona.
      ",5,2015,09,10
44,A Luxe Modern Escape in the Middle of the City,"I stayed a the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona in early November of last year for about a week for work and thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of it.

ARCHITECTURE + DECOR
The hotel itself is an old bank that has been gutted and completely renovated. The architects and designers stayed true to the spirit of the bank but added a very luxe, modern polish to everything giving the property a very unique, spacious, welcoming feel. The moment you step into the Mandarin Barcelona, you feel like you've arrived somewhere special, which was a welcome treat for a weary business traveler.

The rooms are equally as tasteful and open-feeling as the lobby area: think naturally finished woods contrasting beautifully with crisp white walls and linens and an exceptionally clean and modern bathroom with large shower and soaking tub. 

SERVICE
Service at the Mandarin Barcelona is exceptional. I was greeted and checked in quickly with no hiccups. The multi lingual staff are all attractive, pleasant and helpful. They are quick with directions and restaurant recommendations and well informed about various sites and shops nearby. I told the concierge at the front desk that I had about 2 hours to kill in between meetings and asked what I should do. She set me up with the perfect 2 hour itinerary which consisted of a short walk through the city, lunch at a nearby cafe and a place to buy some shirts (I'd forgotten to pack one extra change of clothes).

FOOD
The only meals we ate at the hotel were breakfasts and a couple lunches or late snacks. Overall the food quality was very good and the dishes were thoughtful and well prepared. The restaurant is a Michelin star rated restaurant and the beautiful open atmosphere and food reflect that. 

LOCATION
After the stunning architecture and decor, the location of the Mandarin Barcelona is the real star. It's situated in the heart of the city, and extremely close to literally everything you could want: great restaurants (whether you're looking for a fine dining experience or just a casual bite), a variety of shops, bars, clubs, public transportation and sites to explore. We took an afternoon walk around the city on our day off to see the Gothic Quarter and Gaudi's Sagrada Familia (which is stunning and even more impressive in person than it is in pictures), and we caught a ride to the former Olympic Stadium as well.

Despite being nestled right in the middle of everything, the Mandarin Barcelona is surprisingly quiet inside. I'm a fairly light sleeper and never once heard any loud or distracting city noise from my room and slept very soundly.

THE SPA
I treated myself to one little treatment at the spa in the Mandarin Barcelona. As with everything else, setting up the appointment was quick and easy. There is a private elevator you can take from every floor that goes directly to the spa so you can go down/up in your robe and slippers without having to ride the regular elevator with other guests--a very thoughtful detail. When I was there, the spa had a podiatrist visiting from Paris who specialized in a 45 min foot massage and basic pedicure and assessment. Having walked around most of the day before, my feet were very sore and the Spa concierge highly recommended this treatment. I've had many massages in the past, but I'd never had a pedicure or foot wrap. I have to say it was very pleasurable experience. The French podiatrist did a bit of reflexology, manicured my toes, massaged my feet and lower legs and then wrapped them up in chocolate paraffin wax. My feet were recharged and rejuvenated and I smelled like bittersweet chocolate. haha.

Overall, my experience at the Mandarin Barcelona was very enjoyable. The hotel is comfortable, stylish, and luxe and the service is warm, responsive and fast. I couldn't ask for much more on a business trip or otherwise. Highly recommend.",4,2015,09,10
44,"Amazing Hotel, even more amazing Guest Relations Manager","We arrived at the Mandarin and there were some problems with the room to which we were assigned. We asked to speak with the manager, and the Guest Relations Manager, Thais Guerrero, bought us lunch while she solved the room issues, and placed us in a beautiful, upgraded room. As if that were not enough, she checked with us in person daily to see how we were enjoying our stay.",5,2015,09,09
44,Better impossible..,"I stayed 3 nights with my wife last year..how could i say ?? just but just so perfect. Room is cleaned almost 3 times per day..concierge is just so good to give you the best tips and book you the best table in top restaurants.

For who lovea chic, design and urvan hotel..do not look forward..Mandarin is the place to be in Barcelona.

Will go back for sure",5,2015,09,09
44,Great hotel amidst the Barcelona hustle and bustle,"The public spaces in the Mandarin make this an oasis of calm in the busy atmosphere of Barcelona.  The standard rooms are a bit on the small size, the suites are definitely a better way to go.  The Terrace on the top floor has fabulous drinks and great view of the city and a plunge pool--great place for hanging out.  The garden restaurant is wonderful off the first floor bar--great tapas and great drinks.  The front desk staff and concierges are warm and welcoming and very concerned about your welfare.  Would definitely stay there again .",4,2015,09,09
44,Could Not Be Better,"Without exaggeration, the staff here is one of the best we have ever seen--both in terms of quality and quantity.  Their ability to anticipate needs is beyond description--and that was true uniformly.  Their training program must be unique.

The location is perfect.

The only negative is minimal drawer space.

Would return in a heartbeat.",5,2015,09,07
44,Excellence!,"Our first ever trip to Barcelona, this hotel set a very high standard of service. The staff was friendly, attentive, accommodating, and went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. The property is in a superb location, and the decor and pleasant fragrance throughout the hotel do not disappoint. Our room (Mandarin Room-garden view) was spacious for two people and very quiet. 

They handled the one issue we had very well. The Resident Manager, Vincent, was responsive and personally addressed it and offered a reasonable resolution. It was evident that the management team is very communicative with the staff to ensure their guest experience is positive. 

I can say that mine was and would not want to stay anywhere else. ",5,2015,09,02
44,Always a fan of the Mandarin hotels but....,"The Mandarin in Barcelona is a beautiful hotel at a very convenient location. The first room we were shown smelled of smoke and the staff was amazing and worked with us to switch to a different room. Our room on the 5th floor was very comfortable and tastefully decorated. The service in true Mandarin style was impeccable - the staff at the reception, concierge, restaurants, bars and spa go out of their way to make sure you have an amazing stay. We ate at Moments which was fabulous but more on that in a separate review...So a couple of reasons why its just short of 5 stars (I would give it a 4.5 if that was an option) - (i) we just stayed at the Mandarin in Paris a couple of days ago and that is hands down a nicer property and (ii) the pools on the property are a little disappointing; the roof top pool is for wading purposes only and the one in the basement is too dark and the water is a little too warm. Little nits on the margin as overall this is a great property",4,2015,09,01
44,Urban OASIS,"I LOVE Mandarin hotels and was so happy we picked their Barcelona spot for our recent vacation.  The location is PERFECT - close to the shops/Eixample and an easy downhill walk to the coast.  The room was super modern with clean fixtures and a great shower/bath space.  We were on the main facing side of the street - with views of the block of discord - and yet at night you could hear a pin drop.  The shades were also the darkest i have ever seen!

We included the breakfast as part of our package and it was well worth it to get a full meal before touring.  I also was lucky enough to enjoy yoga in the mimosa garden which was pure relaxation right in the middle of the city.

The rooftop doubles as a plunge pool and bar - we enjoyed the loungers midday after a long day of walking and the evening cocktails overlooking the night lights was perfect.  We also enjoyed the indoor pool for a refreshing dip and I treated myself to a massage in the spa - such a cool spot and the massage was superb.

All in all you cant go worng staying here - only good things!",5,2015,08,31
44,Amazing attention to Guest service,"We enjoyed 3 nights before traveling away for a biking trip in the Pyrenees. Our days in Barcelona were filled with intense sightseeing, and the luxury of the Mandarin was exactly the refuge we desired. The rooftop was an amazing perch in the middle of the city, it was difficult to leave. The beds were incredible comfortable, and the rooms were well sized.
We when we returned for 1 final night after our biking trip, the staff knew about our trip, and went above an beyond to provide comfort for our weary bodies. My husband took advantage of the SPA services, which provided great relief. Again our goal was to capture more sightseeing on our last evening, however the hospitality was so overwhelming we just stayed in the Hotel! The level of attention by all the staff to provide absolute hospitality, was beyond expectation. I really wanted to stay longer, & will next time.",5,2015,08,31
44,"Can't wait to return to the Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona!!","The Mandarin Oriental Barcelona was absolutely amazing.  It is located on one of the most amazing streets and is surrounded by great shopping and restaurants.  Yet, once you enter the doors of the Mandarin, you feel relaxed and do not hear any street noise.  We stayed for four nights with our kids and the adjoining rooms worked perfectly for our family.  We couldn't wait to eat breakfast in the morning and the hostess always remembered our drinks.  The concierge desk was beyond amazing and anticipated our every need.  They truly went above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay in Barcelona.  They booked us a great electric bike tour of the city that we will never forget! The outside pool was small but beautifully located on the roof with a great view of the city.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona and look forward to our next visit.  Thanks again to the wonderful guys at the concierge desk and the entire staff at Mandarin Barcelona for making our visit to Barcelona so memorable!!",5,2015,08,29
44,Top notch,"Beautiful, fashionable, stylish hotel on one of the best streets in the world. Great shopping and restaurants all around. We especially enjoyed the various bars in the hotel! Great place to get a drink! Great service and rooms. Would highly recommend.",5,2015,08,28
44,Great concierge service and wonderful spa!,"Stayed here for one week and it was great overall. The room was a bit small compared to the same price point at the Four Seasons (in Florence).. for example. The concierge made our stay wonderful experience with very smooth arrangements; including a private tour guide for 3 architectural sites, a horseback riding excursion for an advanced rider, dinner reservations and recommendations as well as booking nail and beauty appointments within walking distance. The only let down was late laundry service on one occasion but for the price of high end hotel laundry, there shouldn't be any mess ups. It was not an hour or so late but the next morning kind of late. It only happened once but when you're traveling and have dinner reservations at a nice sot; that's important! Best massage I've ever had was there!! Definitely enjoy the spa...speaking of which, they have separate spa elevators on each floor so you don't have to roll in the regular elevator while you're all robed-up!",5,2015,08,26
44,Excellent,"The hotel location is excellent.

44,Great but Confusing,"I just recently stayed at the Mandarin in Barcelona. First of all, i am a big big fan of Mandarin and have stayed in the one in prague - stunning. This stay was slightly different. Before i continue, i just want to say that the concierge was amazing - so helpful - such great and quick feedback. I am confused however, about two things. First of all, a piece of advice - never ever stay on the 1st floor - it feels like a basement with hardly any natural light coming in (at least the room i got). The breakfast is amazing, the rooms are well cleaned, the staff friendly. I did face some challenges - However, both times, i received an apology note (and the second one came without me complaining). So, i want to give it an 'excellent' but i cant.",4,2015,08,21
44,Excellent service and great location ,"We stayed with our family on this our first trip to Barcelona. Stayed on 3 separate occasions . Service was superb and very personalized . 

Rooms are lovely - nice to have room overlooking Paseig de Gracia . 
The breakfast buffet is fantastic . Decent gym though would be nicer to have a view. The upstairs terrace with mini pool has great views of the city and lively to relax there and have an aperitivo. 

The location is fantastic - all the shops and sights nearby . 

Highly recommend. ",5,2015,08,20
44,Excellent Luxury design Hotel,"We had a great stay at the Mandarin In Barcelona. 
The design and service was excellent. 
The only problem would be the roudines  of intense kids in the pool area who don't respect the calm of the spa area, this is not a water park (this goes to all the classless parents who think the bad behavior of their offsprings is amusing)",4,2015,08,16

While there we had a small problem about a leaking noise, and Sandra made sure to send us champagne, roses, wine, fruits, all just for the little trouble we had. If you are to go then stay at one of the studio suites, they are big and very beautifil. ",5,2015,08,15
44,Breakfast service is lacking,"We enjoyed MO BCN. The hotel is beautiful, the service was good most of the time. Most importantly, the location is right in the centre of the city. Casa Batllo and La Pedrera are just minutes away by foot.

We stayed 3 nights in a Studio Suite. The suite was spacious with a high ceiling and it was decorated stylishly. There was a balcony overlooking the Mimosa Garden. Our butlers took care of everything we needed during our stay and they were doing a good job.

We visited the Spa twice, once for a facial and the other time for a massage. Unfortunately, my partner did not enjoyed as much as I did and it was all about the skill of the therapists. We enjoyed the Banker's Bar as well as Terrat on the roof top. However, Terrat could be too hot for drinks before sundown. We had brunch at Bistreau and dinner at La Mesa. The brunch was nice but the dinner was just an average experience and I gave it a separate review.

What I must mention is the breakfast at Bistreau. The quality of food was good but the service was missing. Breakfast started at 7:00am but they were still setting the buffet table when we arrived. It was the same for the first 2 mornings that we visited. They finished setting around 7:30am and we saw the restaurant manager started the briefing. We tried to get a waiter to remove the dirty plates but they were all gathering around the manager so no one was attending the guests even though there were not many at that time.

On day 3, we went a bit later so the buffet was ready. We were given the bill to sign not long after we were seated and we considered that not appropriate. Anyway, we signed and returned it. When we almost finished the meal, another waiter presented us the bill again. I must mention breakfast was included in my room rate so I was only signing for the gratuities. This is not the kind of mistake happens at a MO.

However, I will stay with MO BCN again when I come visiting Barcelona for the comfortable room and excellent location.",4,2015,08,14
44,awesome,"loved the stay, it is awesome
it has good location that close by the most important places in the city and the buses for the city tour are stopping in front of the hotel.
the price is kind of expensive but it is worth it

44,A chic hotel in a lovely city,"Stayed there with my wife for 4 nights, we were bumped into a lovely room overlooking the internal Garden, great modern decoration and well equipped with modern amenities, the staff are very helpful and courteous. 

I would defiantly stay there if I am visiting Barcelona Again.",5,2015,08,13
44,Beyond classy,From the moment you walk in they make you feel special.  The rooms are very nice and have plenty of space.  The rooftop pool is a must at this hotel.  The view is out of this world.  Location is right in the middle of shops and resturants.  The hop on/hop off bus has a stop right in front. Will come/be back. thank you for a great time.  The only thing better would have been free wifi/coffee maker in the room.  For what you are paying a night ... It should not be extra (wifi).,5,2015,08,12
44,"Special Touch at the Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona","To celebrate my 50th birthday, I returned to Barcelona after a week long cruise, and was simply over impressed with the quality of the service and facilities. From check in to check out the staff was extremely attentive and truly felt like you are a special guest.  I returned to the room after a day of sight-seeing, and a special birthday greeting of champagne, cake and the ever so rare hand-written note was present to wish me a happy birthday.  The location on the Passeig de Grace is very convenient with in walking distance to sites such as Las Ramblas, Gaudi houses (Casa Battlo is across the street), and the easy to use Metro, is just a block away.

44,Property Fabulous Management Not,"The hotel has a wonderful location. The lobby is stunning. The rooms are very attractive and well furnished. I would stay here again except for what happened when I ordered room service. When it arrived, I was on the deck and the waiter walked into the room and over to the door. I was startled since usually when you don't open the door most hotels call the room. As I stepped back into the room the bottom bar of the shade hit my foot. It was very heavy and sharp. I fell down.It was impossible to get back in the room without contact with it.
The waiter reported the incident and two people came to my room with a first aid kit. They were pleasant but not apologetic. The shade (floor to ceiling) is very large and the bar at the bottom is very heavy. The waiter said several other people had been hurt by it. I called and complained about the lack of an apology for what was obviously a poorly designed shade. I never heard from anyone again. We checked out the next morning.",3,2015,08,11
44,Perfect Stay in Barcelona,"When I mentioned I was going to Barcelona, a friend recommended the Mandarin Oriental. I had a somewhat less-than-desirable experience at the NYC MO so I was a little hesitant, but ultimately I figure if it was an expert traveler like her gave it two thumbs up, it was enough to convince me to try.

The Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is located on Passage de Gracia, known for its array of designer shops, Gaudi architectures and great restaurants. This particular MO has 98 rooms, 5 restaurants and a world-class spa.

Despite the late 7PM check-in, we were upgraded to a Junior Suite. Unfortunately I am one of those annoying people that needs her own bed, we stayed with our Deluxe Blvd twin room.

Measuring at 376 square feet, the room feels much larger thanks to lots of natural light. Some people think all white rooms are a bit sterile but I personally love how clean it looks. Our room had a cute little balcony that had a view of Passage de Gracia. Leather lovers, Loewe is just across the street. The twin size bed looked a little small initially but it was enough to accommodate my 5'10 frame. However, I think tall gentlemen might find the twin beds to be a little short.The bathroom was beautiful and well-stocked with luxurious products. The room does not have an actual closet, but the wardrobe provided more than sufficient space for our things. 

There was a nice fruit & chocolate plate waiting for us in the room and it was replenished daily. Also because we didn't take the upgrade, the manager insisted we treat ourselves to anything in the snack drawer and mini bar, how nice!

Our dinner at Blanc, a contemporary restaurant offering Mediterranean cuisine, was fantastic. Food was flavorful but not too rich. We received complimentary breakfast at Blanc, which is continental breakfast plus a hot food bar (courtesy of AMEX. Apologies as I am unsure of the actual cost).

We only had 2 nights so we did not get to explore all the amenities but I will be sure to do that next time I am in Barcelona, because the service was impeccable I will definitely return.",5,2015,08,11
44,Chi Chi Luxury,"What an amazing hotel. If you like luxury, this is THE place to stay in Barcelona.
What a perfect location for a quick short stay for shops and tourist attractions!
The staff are impeccable, the service is first class, the food in MOments restaurant (2 Michelin star) was AMAZING and behold, the largest breakfast buffet I have ever seen. The room decor (by my favorite interior designer Patricia Urquiola) was sublime. From the tweedy vinyl wall coverings to the brushed copper light switches, no attention to detail had been missed. An abundance of great hardbacks were scattered around the room for your perusal and as for the mini bar.... rephrase.... LARGE bar. Goodness me. I could have easily bolted myself in for the month and would have hardly touched the supply. Bathroom was huge and again, beautifully decorated. After a mornings shop, head to the roof for a burger (best ever) or some of the divine hummus by the pool. Not for swimming though, more a dip and a sit on the step as rather shallow.
Mandarin Group, you have done it again. I am truly a FAN.",5,2015,08,11
44,MANDARIN ORIENTAL HOTEL BARCELONA,"The Mandarin Oriental Hotel Barcelona is the best, absolutely the best - best -best, (did I say best? :) ) place to stay in Barcelona.... as soon as you walk up its carpet entry hall the first sense of luxury hits you.  You will fell like a VIP right there.  The hotel should have +6 stars.... truly it is an experience of absolute perfection from top to bottom, not to mention its great location, lovely and attentive staff, great indoor pool and unusual (in a good way) steam room, spa facilities, breakfast setting more than lovely and food is to die for....  Great roof top terrace!  Oh, rooms are very spacious and heavenly comfortable with first class amenities!!!! Must experience it to believe it.  ",5,2015,08,11
44,A Mandarin Lemon,"My wife and I booked in to the Mandarin Room of this hotel for two nights. The room design is all over the place like a mad person's breakfast. The swinging television which sits predominantly in the centre of the room can be an annoying obstruction. The separate toilet reminded us of our toilet in a campervan we hired. The rug on the floor impeded the full opening of the balcony door. We had requested a garden view - very little garden but lots of apartment buildings. This room is an attempt to be modern and trendy and it just does not cut it. I can only assume that the rooms to be in are the suites,which at considerably more cost, should have been our choice ( suites are located in a separate building evidently).  Having said that, no complaints with all the staff we have encountered - they were pleasant & very helpful and the location is great. A suggestion: hold spraying whatever you spray in the corridors outside the rooms and in this day and age like so many of your competitors, offer free wifi.",3,2015,08,11
44,Excellent Hotel !!,"What differentiates a Mandarin Hotel from others is it's service. That is also the case for the MO in BCN.
Because the stay was such a good experience I would like to provide more details:

Location: more central is not possible. Super location for shopping/dining.
Check in/Check out: very quick and professional. Multi lingual staff.
Rooms: we stayed in a standard room as well as a Suite. Standard room was somewhat small but had everything you need. The Suite was something special in terms of interior design. Far better than most hotel suites. Mo knows how to create a non hotel room atmosphere and make you feel very comfortable.
Restaurant: breakfast choice far above usual standards. Service excellent.
Terrat rooftop restaurant: very good sushi. Super view.
Fitness: excellent Gym.
Indoor swimming pool really good. Water heated with the right temperature. Steambath with beds to lie on, more than excellent.
Spa: my wife had a facial which was also really well done.
Concierge service: beyond the normal. We asked them to buy some special medicin which they handled very professionally. Also the restaurant recommendation was excellent.
Bankers Bar: super friendly and professional service. Really nicely designed bar!

Will we return: Yes already booked our next stay for September.

44,I'M A FAN!,"Fabulous hotel, conveniently located. Very nice variety for food and exceptional  concierge service. Although it is pricey by some standards, clearly worth the money. The entire staff is very very customer centric. They even procured a box of Spenda for us during our stay. ",5,2015,08,06
44,A diamant in the sky,"High expectation and anticipation are always associated with any Mandarin Oriental in the world. In Barcelona this is no different and you will not be disappointed. I don't know how the Mandarin does it, but they seem to have a magic wand that hires them the best staff available. Staff, that is not only friendly and helpful, but carries their duties out with grace and sophistication. As a guest you feel truly valued and looked after. 

The roof top bar and pool are a great place to relax after a day of sightseeing. The pool is only 60cm deep but enough to cool down and enjoy the rest of the day. I loved the beautiful and comfortable outdoor furniture design from Kettall and B&B. 

The rooms are spacious and so are the bathrooms. All is decorated in an amazing contemporary scandinavian design. The only thing I would change is the slippery floor in the showers. You have to really carefully walk in and out. This might be a problem for older guests and younger children. 

The breakfast room is another beautiful decorated place with a fantastic buffet selection, as well as a a-la-carte menu. The table and chairs are quiet low seated and for tall guests somehow inconvenient to have breakfast. I felt a bit like sitting in my sons primary school chairs. 

I would like to thank the staff of the Mandarin Oriental for a wonderful stay and an excellent service throughout our 4 days. 

If you have a chance to stay at the Mandarin Oriental don't think twice. You will love it or as another reviewer wrote: Too lovely to miss it!",5,2015,08,06
44,I'm a fan:),"Prime location, almost across the Gaudi house, close to all the brand stores and restaurants on Passeig de Gracia, walking distance to las Ramblas, Barrio Gotico, Sagrada and the harbor. Lovely entrance ramp right next to Tiffany's...
Mostly great service as I've come to appreciate from this brand. Concierge lady could be a bit friendlier...
We had a room facing the back, quite a horrible view, looking at not so nice back facades, which makes the balcony kinda pointless....I do understand that this just can't be changed, we are in a big city and you can't buy 5 star surroundings. Upside, more quiet at night. The decor is beautiful; calm contemporary, stylish and functional.
If you come by car you have to drive into the very right lane that looks like a pedestrian only path. One of the friendly bell men will park your car (for a fortune, but that's normal for big cities) in the garage.
Wonderful, varied breakfast buffet, including freshly shaved pata negra:) Tea and coffee service could be a bit better.
My husband did a running city tour in the morning, great coach and great way to see the city.
We didn't spend any time on the roof terrace pool; it seems a bit small, but is probably lovely for an evening cocktail.
All in all not as top notch as the MO in Vegas or Hong Kong, but nicer than the one in Geneva.
I've been in Barcelona several times, this is surely one of the best, most luxurious hotels the city has to offer.",5,2015,08,02

44,Great Summer Stay!,"Stayed there last summer and I must say everything about this hotel is spectacular. The main thing I always look for in a hotel is their service and how well they treat their customers and this hotel was didn't miss a thing, it gives you this feeling that your special and that your in a world of your own. The hotel room was a bit compact and the bathroom doors were a bit confusing but overall a visually stunning room, I loved the whole design concept of very modern chic colours like the white it was very artsy. The food at the old restaurant Blanc was satisfying to the taste buds it was brilliant, the restaurant itself was a piece of art and was interesting to even look at especially from the lobby. I've stayed at several mandarin orientals before and this is one of the best I have ever experienced. I will be staying once again this summer during August and I am extremely excited and am looking forward to it.",5,2015,07,28

You need a reservation in advance as it is sold out in advance. ",5,2015,07,16
44,Top Notch Service,"The service in this Hotel is really some of the best in Europe. Everyone smiling and eager to help you. I think Greg Liddel must be one of the best GM´s out there. He is really taking this hotel a few steps further.

We stayed in two connecting rooms for three nights and when the rooms were not ready when we arrived we were invited to lunch in the Brasserie.

The rooms were of a high standard with small balconies facing Passieg de Gracia. The bathrooms come with shower only, but the showers are huge and with very good water pressure. 

The roof terrace is just amazing with a plunge pool (a pity it is not a full depth lap pool) and nice chairs and sofas to lounge in and to have drinks and snacks in the evening. You can see Casa Batllo and other modernista buildings from the terrace.

Food was ok, but the sushi on the terrace and lunch in the Brasserie was not quite up there. Breakfast however was superb. I am sure they will improve the food aspects further. Unfortunately we did not secure a table at Moments (the Milchelin restaurant) so remember to book ahead - it is said to be very good indeed.

We are looking forward to returning!",5,2015,07,15

The breakfast was superb (we opted for it to be included) and service on the roof terrace was perfect- €22 for a glass of Champagne, €20 for a Mandarin Mojito. From 7pm it became busy with non-hotel guests so to get a good seat go up before then. The room was quiet (we had a garden view) and the underground pool also very pleasant as we never shared it.

44,a stylish retreat in BCN,"The polished service, gorgeous and friendly staff, sophisticated contemporary design throughout makes it a winner. 

The rooms are small (at 367 square feet for a Boulevard Room), but well designed with intelligent storage space to get your suitcases out of the way. There are some thoughtful amenities such as a yoga mat, mini-flashlight, USB port in the wall, “vide-poche” to empty your pockets into when you come in the room.  Even the ever-present fragrance in the hallways is pleasant.  

Don’t miss Terrat – a calm and relaxing rooftop oasis. A plunge pool, a number of relaxing lounge chairs, sweeping views of the city.  

I don’t usually write about breakfast but it’s exceptional.  There is a wide but curated range of items; I particularly liked the gorgeous artisanal yogurts, the freshly sliced jamon iberico, DIY pan con tomate, local cheeses.",5,2015,07,08
44,Not the best Mandarin,"Quite clean and fairly decent service but the very modern rooms are small (we had a larger room but it still was small) and not very efficient. We had our luggage over the floor and could hardly walk. The bathrooms are tiny and the design is just silly with a shower that drenches everything within reach. 
We liked the location near high end shopping but if that's not your thing then maybe find something near the beach. 
One highlight was the rooftop cocktail lounge which we loved.

44,Top-notch service,"In nearly every aspect, MO Barcelona is an exceptional hotel. Located in the heart of the upmarket shopping precinct of the city, near to the top end of La Rambla, 2 minutes to the metro station and a 10 minute walk to La Sagrada, it's situation is hard to fault. The basic rooms, although smallish, are stylishly decorated with good sized bathrooms and a comfortable bed, along with doors opening to a small verandah with furniture. The service is flawless in true Mandarin Oriental style, the breakfast buffet (5 tables!) is amazing, and the food at the 2 Michelin star hotel restaurant Moments is to die for.
The fundamental goal for a luxury hotel, however, is a tranquil night's sleep, and here the MO falls a little short. Rooms at the front facing the street get a lot of traffic and pedestrian noise throughout the night, especially on the lower levels; there seems to be little in the way of sound insulation. Rooms at the back are quieter, unless the locals, living in the apartments onto which the hotel backs, decide to hold an all night party - not too uncommon in Barcelona! Add to this the wooden floors which transmit noise from the level above quite readily, and a peaceful night's sleep may not always be the result.
I would like to give the MO 5 stars, and if they can fix the noise issues it would come close to 6, but until then....",4,2015,06,27
44,Beautifully designed hotel,"I have a love hate relationship with this hotel.  There are several great things about this hotel:  The hotel is within walking distance to touristy stuff (read: Gaudi).  The interior design of this hotel was fantastic; great attention to details.  The men's public bathroom is so nice that it doesn't even look like a bathroom.  The service is topnotch.  It's hard to get ice tea in Spain (freshly brew ones not Lipton can ice tea).  When I asked for ice tea, I didn't get a question of which flavor do you want.  Instead, they asked if I wanted freshly brewed or can ones.  They just get it.  Food was delicious at the cafe and at their 2 Michelin star restaurant.  The bad: Rooms are tiny for the price you are paying.  I get that one is on the most desirable street in Barcelona so space is at a premium but still, $800+ a nite for 350 sqft seems a bit steep.  We had a disastrous stay at Ritz Carlton Barcelona so moved to MO last minute.  They had either a $4000 room or $800 room left.  We took the $800 one.  The rooftop pool was very weak.  We took a look and quickly left the tiny rooftop deck.  This ain't Gansevoort at meatpacking district in NYC.",5,2015,06,24
44,"Excellent, personal service and great location.","Stylishly modern rooms and exceptionally good service - nothing is too much trouble and the staff welcomed us back every time we entered the hotel lobby. Extremely comfortable beds with gorgeous sheets. Rooms at the front are right on the street so it can be a little noisy, but the street is fabulous - designer/chain stores and cafes from end to end. Huge bath and large shower room. 

Food: We weren't able to get into the Michelin star restaurant as we hadn't booked, but there was generally plenty of room in the main restaurant which served food all day and was extremely pretty, airy and relaxed.

Pool: Rooftop pool and the surrounding seating area is small.

44,Pure Luxury in Barcelona,"So happy we chose the Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona, for a romantic weekend in Barcelona. 

The location says it all - smack in the middle of the city's most grand boulevard, across the street from Gaudi's Casa Batlló and within walking distance of most places of interest.  The concierges did an excellent job at pointing us in all the right directions. The staff in general were the high calibre you come to expect from Mandarin - warm, friendly and very professional. 

Our suite (322) overlooked the boulevard but was well-insulated against the noise - which is saying something, when the city erupted to Barcelona's recent football win.  The suite was vast and fabulously decorated - modern, funky and very comfortable.  The bed was enormous and we slept well and the bathroom was great, with enough electrical points in the right places for hairdryer and flatiron, etc.  (Ladies will understand.)  Oh - and let's not forget the minibar.  Amazing.

There's a lower terrace which is a great place to escape with a book and the top floor terrace & bar is a funky chill-out zone and a great place to catch some sun.   But do be warned - the rooftop pool shown in the photos is just a dipping pool.  I was disappointed when I realised this, but the pool in the gym/spa area is good enough (with no sunburn risk) and the adjacent steam room is one of the best I've ever used.  The gym itself is well appointed, if you need to burn off too many tapas.

For anyone looking for a luxuriously indulgent place to enjoy a romantic break in Barcelona, I couldn't recommend the Mandarin Oriental more.",5,2015,06,08
44,Probably the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in,"Wonderful hotel from the moment you cross the threshold to the moment you leave

A welcoming refreshing drink while checking in. Every member of staff I encountered made me feel like they were there just for us.
Special requests I made for the room were filled without fuss, I asked for some fresias and there was the biggest bunch I've ever seen resulting in a very happy fiancee.
Stayed in the junior mandarin suite, which was very comfortable with a great large circular bath which you could get filled with aromatics. A large shower and a wonderful bed which was very comfortable but just in case it's not quite right there is a pillow menu to get that perfect nights sleep.

The roof bar and splash pool was a nice place to relax, non residents only have access after 6pm

I made use of the steam room and pool during the day. Probably not for the serious swimmer but for a paddler like me it was perfect, lovely mood lightng and very comfortable also I was the only one in there, perfect.

My fiancee had a massage treatment in the spa which she loved.

Hope you enjoy it as much as I did

The hotel location is great if you like walking around as it was central to all the sights I wanted to show",5,2015,06,05
44,"Amazing staff, perfect location","We stayed three nights and loved this hotel.  The location is perfect - close enough to Las rambles for an easy walk but yet quiet and peaceful when you need it to be. It's an easy walk to all of the sights and the rooms are great.  The best part is the staff -- the concierge staff truly cared about the missing luggage (followed up with airline without us asking, followed up on it's delivery, etc), they were great in suggestions on how to find specific items, tours, restaurants.  

Rooms are modern and comfortable.  We had a little step our balcony with a view of the Gaudi building (casa batllo) from our porch.  The rooftop bar was great and offered a lovely sunset view as well. 

Breakfast via room service was expensive but that is true of all luxury hotels.  We don't have any negatives to say about this hotel.",5,2015,06,03
44,MO Barcelona great stay,"This was my 3rd visit to Mandarin Oriental Barcelona this year and it was outstanding in everyway.  I especially would like to acknowledge Sandra at the front desk for making the stay perfect.  I had requested a room on the 2nd floor with the small balcony but at check I was informed that it was not available nor would it likely be available the next day.   At around 4pm I received a call from Sandra at the front desk informing me that she was able to secure for me a balcony room and would I be available to immediate make the move to the new room.  I was so impressed with her initiative not only finding me a balcony room but arranging for my luggage  and new keys brought up to the new room.  I will always remember this special service and will definitely return to the MO Barcelona on my next visit.

Nothing was too much trouble and any question was treated with a smile and very timely assistance. In terms of food, we couldn't not fault it, and the cocktail bar was none too shabby either !!

The concierges were the best we have worked with in any hotel any where in the world.  And we have traveled a lot, on both business and pleasure.
  The negatives to us, were surprising.  The room was relatively small for a top-rated hotel.  The decor  was, to us, barren and ultramodern.  I mean it.  The lighting in both the room and bath was inadequate.  Breakfast in the beautiful Bistro is ridiculously overpriced (25 Euros for a continental breakfast). After 2 days, we learned that less than two blocks away in any direction, one could have an excellent breakfast for a fraction of that price.
  All things considered, we would likely stay there again because of the outstanding positives.",4,2015,05,31
44,Sunlit Haven on P de Gratia,"Barcelona is picturesque and well- planned and just redolent in culture.
Every exquisite sight is set just so.
As for the Mandarin Oriental, the facade is unprepossesing but the interior and the staff just made our stay.
The whole lobby is scented with their signature spa aroma so be prepared to be wafted up to your room.
Ours was a suite overlooking the Paseig.We looked left towards the sea and up to the Tibidibo mountains. Comfort pamper and luxury are the key words.
The staff speak perfect English and go above and beyond to ensure the perfect stay.
This is a standard to keep.",5,2015,05,26
44,Outstanding Service,"From the moment you walk into a Mandarin Hotel, you know that you are in for a treat.  It is quite impressive to see how every member of the staff at the hotel understands the importance of providing their guests with high quality service.  Our stay in Barcelona was our last leg of a three week trip in Europe.  By the time we arrived at the hotel, we were a bit tired of having been on the road for 10 days, but it was quite refreshing to have the assistance of a fantastic team.  From the doorman to the General Manager, we were provided with great service and information about restaurants, places to visits and shopping.  The hotel's two Michelin star restaurant, Moments, deserves a third star.  The food was magnificent!! Do not miss eating at Moments.  It is worth the visit.",5,2015,05,26
44,THE hotel to go to in Barcelona!,"Ideal Location right in the middle of shopping and restaurant facilities. Spacious rooms with generous and luxurious amenities. Bed Linens were fabulous. Our room was garden facing and therefore super quiet.
The Terrace in the 9th floor is spectacular and staff throughout the hotel was extremely friendly and efficient.",5,2015,05,24
44,Very nice hotel,Great palace with a superb design and perfect services. We have been very warmly welcomed and we joined our beautiful room. The bathroom is spacious and well-equiped. We enjoyed the food and the hotel was ideally located. Thank you  for this stay !,5,2015,05,21
44,Not Up To Mandarin Orientsl Standards,"When checking in, we were already in for a surprise. The receptionist was not informed about the special package and its benefits we booked through Visa Infinitive. According to a written confirmation we were entitled to a continental breakfast, free Wifi and an upgrade to the next category. The lady wanted written proof! We showed it to her. Two other colleagues were watching and all giving their comments! Even though we were the guests, we were treated like liars. Concerning the upgrade, we were told in very poor English that it was subject to availability. As the hotel was not informed in advance about our package, there was of course no upgrade available for 4 consecutive nights. When we opposed, we were told we should consider us very fortunate that our request for a quiet room had been honored.
On our way to the elevator there was a smell of sewage! I noticed that other guests were also aware of the smell.
Our room, garden view, turned out to be on the small side. Staying only for 4 nights, we did not have too much luggage. But it was a challenge to stow away our belongings. The bathroom turned out to be totally unfunctional as well. A round bathtub without any possibility to hold shower gel or towel. An open shower with water spilling over all the floor. The sliding glas-door separating the toilet from the bathroom did not close properly.
The bathroom was separated with a glass wall from the room itself.
The whole room felt like a  cage. 
The hotel's quality is not up to Mandarin Oriental standard. Having stayed at several Mandarin hotels, I am sorry to have to say that this one is substandard! 
I cannot recommend this place to anybody!",3,2015,05,20
44,Stunning hotel with really cool design!,"Wow! Great great city hotel! It's urban, the interior design is super and perfect location to go everywhere in the city. The staff was extremely helpful and went out of their way to assist from the entrance to checkout. It used to be an old bank and the hotel bar certainly does reflect that with metalsafes lining the walls. It feels boutique but with ""big hotel"" amenities.
Only negatives are that the garden facing rooms have a ""so so"" view as it is surrounded by building blocks and you have a nearby school which can be quite noisy during their breaks daytime...But then again, you feel like you are a part of the city life. If you are looking for a nearby restaurant, try out Boca Grande with its adjacent bar Boca Chica which has a great vibe.",5,2015,05,20
44,Overpriced Hotel in Barcelona,"Tiny rooms that seem to have been designed by committee.  Indifferent service.  Despite the great location, this hotel offers very poor value for money.
Our biggest problem  was the noise.  Despite the fact that this was a former bank facility, the rooms are incredible loud.  In four nights, we never got a good night's sleep.
      ",2,2015,05,20
44,Hamed El Chiaty,"The hotel gives the impression it is a luxury hotel but in fact its very poor service and lack of trained staff takes away all the enjoyment pf a beautifully decorated property.
1. Rooms are extremely small. When i asked how can a hotel be rated five stars with such small rooms the answer was not clear whether the hotel was not rated officially five stars or in Barcelona the classification is not dependant on room size. 
2. Reception desk is very very small manned by three receptionists meaning total lack pf privacy of the guests being serviced. The lady who checked us in was extremely unfriendly and very abrupt. She does not belong in a five star property, maybe at Macdonalds. On checkout day at 12.05 shall called saying we must check out immediately as the room was needed for a check in at 3pm. She did not want to give us another 20 min as we were finishing a movie on tv at its very end and actually closed the tv remotely. Wow! Five star!
3. Concierge desk was asked to book a restaurant table for four persona as we were inviting important business guests in a restaurant for the evening for dinner at 9.30pm. No word or confirmation was left in the room. On the way to dinner i went to concierge to collect the address and confirmation, another person was there and he started writing the name of the restaurant by hand because the printer was not responding. He actually wrote the name of another restaurant without telling me to was another restaurant. When i realized this he apologized and told me the other one was full and they booked this instead. When i asked why i was not informed earlier if this he said he did not know. 

If you are a well travelled person avoid this hotel

44,Perfect Location,"Very happy I booked this hotel.  The location can not be beat.  Plenty of shopping and restaurants right outside the lobby.  The Hotel definitely has the upscale vibe, which is good, because you are paying for it.  The staff is extremely courteous and professional.  I booked a balcony room, and could not have been happier.  The room was very spacious, especially for European standards.  Very clean and was serviced well by the staff.  The balcony overlooked the passeig de gracia and had wonderful views.  No issues with street noise once you close the balcony doors.  The rain shower was a highlight of the room.  WIFI was also very fast.  Would definitely recommend this hotel in Barcelona.",5,2015,05,18
44,barcelona,"We have stayed in 5 other Mandarin hotels around the world.  Barcelona is one of the best.  The location for sightseeing and shopping is superb.

44,World Class in a Perfect Location,"The Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona is world class excellent.   The location is within walking distance of all the famous sites:  Gaudi architecture, the medieval city, Gothic architecture, Roman ruins and even the 13th century Jewish town.  It is also on an elegant street next some delightful shopping including Zara Home  and Cortes Ingles. If you are going on a cruise, stay here first.  You will get plenty of water views from the ship.

The staff is outstanding and David and Hendrik even programmed the navigation system in our rental car. They made a big difference!!!!  The hotel itself is  bright, modern in a delightful array of shapes and airy and because it has only a 100 plus rooms it is easy to navigate. 

 It was redone about five years ago and the suite we had was among the best we  have had in the world!!  We had it thanks to the Amex Platinum program which enables upgrades and the generosity of the hotel via Craig and a very responsive and professional front desk.  The  Terrace Suite included several contiguous but separated spaces including an office with a fax machine!!!! All rooms faced the 7th floor deck and were filled with sunlight The view was of urban reality including a school yard.
  
 They had thought of everything...including superb amenities, a bath and a half and a wonderful three mirror vanity on a brass pole in the middle of the master bath... It was such a good idea I am going to try and recreate it in my house.

Included in the Amex promotion was a Spa credit.  The spa was beautiful and my masseuse ,Anna, was terrific.  Again the hotel staff went beyond the call of duty and was able to call in an extra therapist to meet my schedule since they were fully booked.

We also had a great experience with a walking tour  arranged for at the last minute through the  Concierge at the hotel.  Cristina Mila was sent by the Barcelona Guide Bureau and she was super . She had great energy, lots of knowledge, and good English.

The whole experience left a very positive impression about both Barcelona and the Mandarin!",5,2015,05,15
44,Magnificient Stay,"Was lucky enough to visit when hotel had only just opened( a rather delayed review from me),so we had a fab upgrade to a top floor suite with a huge balcony overlooking the Passeig de Gracia. We were welcomed with flowers, champagne and a daily plate of either delicious chocolate dipped strawberries or decadent chocolate delights. The staff couldn't be more helpful in assisting with restaurant choices. We also dined in the hotel restaurant but the atmosphere was rather staid. Breakfast was good if the service was a little slow. On a previous visit to Barcelona we stayed at the Fairmont Juan Carlos so knew for this visit we wanted to be more centrally located nearer to the centre ( Fairmont is near the business district). All in all I would highly recommend!",4,2015,05,15
44,Perfect Location in Barcelona,"Stayed for almost 10 days, first in a Mandarin Room, then in a studio suite - the latter being much much better. There is a very big diffence in room/bathroom size and feel, ameneties and service, the regular room being on the small side and rather dark, and did not even having a coffee maker or kettle. Closet space was tiny as was the bathroom. The suite on the other hand was much brighter and obviously had more space- as well as a butler service (we had a nice young man who was always eager to help with anything). We'd say the upgrade and expense was worth it. 

The location was just perfect for us - shopping, restaurants, business for my husband...not far from the sights and taxis were cheap and plentiful.  The concierge staff were excellent for booking restaurants and giving us advice (Sebastien was very good!), and the doormen/porters (like the lovely Alberto), very warm and helpful.Breakfast buffet was delicious (fab Bellota ham), and Moments was an incredible dining experence. The spa was at par with the other Mandarin Orientals - very good treatments (tried the massage & facial) and ambience. 

Compared to the Bangkok & HK MO's, this one still has some room for improvement in terms of its housekeeping services (mini bar not replenished, room serviced at 2pm etc..), room service and room ameneties (need to be taken up a notch) - but then again this is Europe! Would definitely stay here again in Barcelona.",5,2015,05,13
44,"Great staff, great location, great hotel","My wife and I spend two nights here on our first visit to Spain.  The staff was outstanding - from the receptionist at check-in to the house keeping staff.  Although the room was a bit narrow (508), it was first class. The concierge was also great.  They made several restaurant reservations for us and all them were exactly what we were looking.  Also, on our first morning, I was sick - sore throat, aches, congestion.  We contacted the concierge and a professional doctor, who spoke perfect English, was in our room within 30 minutes.  After two shots and three prescriptions (which the concierge staff picked up for me!), I felt great great and enjoyed our time in Barcelona. We had drinks one night at the roof top bar which has an amazing, romantic view and setting.  Also, make sure your reservation include breakfast.  It is one of the better European style breakfast I've had. 

 I highly recommend the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona. ",5,2015,05,12
44,Fantastic Staff Decent Rooms,"Best staff ever ! Well trained very helpful and happy to be so. Our companions thought a bit too eager but not to me. Location excellent, rooms whilst very nice and generous by European standards, the decorating didn't do much for me but that's a matter of taste and you may love it.",4,2015,05,08
44,"Beautiful design hotel, great location! True 5 star experience in Barcelona!","This hotel does not disappoint even the most discerning travelers. Amazing interior design including rooms, around hotel and restaurant. Excellent location and service. Never stayed at a Mandarin but will definitely be back to this one. One of the best hotels I have stayed in.",5,2015,05,05
44,"Great location, usual High MO standards","Very nice place, in keeping with the brand. Stayed three days. Location is excellent for visiting Barcelona. On a big avenue with lots of shops and restaurants. Walking distance to all the main attractions in the city and old town. Service was excellent, as usual. The room was fitted to a high standard with a very contemporary look. Bathroom was nice, with a great open shower. The room was a little bit on the small side, but MO are not overly generous with space on their standard rooms. The unexpected nice surprise was that for the first time for us in an MO.....the wifi connection was complementary! There is a nice terrace on the roof with a dipping pool. Nice place for a drink at the end of the day with nice views of the city. We ate breakfast every morning in the main restaurant/brasserie and this was good and not outrageously priced (euro 25 pp). Good breakfast buffet. Overall a very nice stay, would very much recommend.",5,2015,05,04
44,Very disappointed with this MO outpost,"This stay was definitely not consistent with the MO brand which is typically 5 star. Great location but with a difficult front access.  We rejected the first room which was small and had a view of poor housing.  Accepted an ""ungrade"" for negotiated add on cost with A/C that never worked and a very poor layout.  We got a partial refund after filling out their survey and immediate contact from the GM to his credit.",2,2015,04,30
44,Modern zen in centre of Barcelona,"Nice stay, great location, tasty breakfast. I loved the iberico ham face to face cutting :) The staff is kind and very helpful.

44,"Outstanding, first class fabulous hotel!!","We visited here recently and it is without a doubt one of the best hotels we have stayed in. The staff are 100% professional, the room was incredible.We extended our stay to 10 days because we loved the hotel so much. The whole hotel is beautifully designed and appointed. They thought of everything. Its in a great location, very handy to all the big brand shops as well as smaller boutiques and more intersting shops in the surrounding streets. I just adored the breakfast area. The Patricia Urquiola interior is to die for, from the tap fitting, to the bed side lights, the rug at the entry... everything has been beautifully designed and thought through. The outside terrace area is a must for a cruisy, early evening cocktail. The two pool areas, the indoor one with the moody green glow and the outside one upstairs with the incredible view of the city are amazing. Very, very cool, chic hotel and we are fussy!!",5,2015,04,27
44,Simply the best,Beautiful hotel with the best location in Barcelona and high level of service. Very good rooms especially in new building. Fantastic bar and restaurants. And off course the garden where you can relax after busy day in noisy town,5,2015,04,27
44,Home away from home.,"The hotel is in a great location.  The service is outstanding.  I usually prefer ""old world"" style luxury but this modern hotel changed my mind.  It was the people more than anything else although my room was lovely too. It overlooked the garden, was quiet except for the happy sounds of children coming from the school playground next door. ",5,2015,04,25
44,Disappointing,"I was staying locally for a conference and typically it was good standard business hotel but they couldn't go to MO for 50 people. However I thought I'd come back to Barcelona for city break, so I thought I'd check out the MO as I've stayed at others and thought if I came back I would stay there for a couple of days. So I went on Thursday morning for breakfast as the traveller photos on here didn't make the hotel rooms look that good as other MO's. So I had time and thought I'd have breakfast here. I'm really glad I checked it out as I would be disappointed coming here and paying personally for it.

Yes it's located on the main upmarket shopping street in Barcelona and that has massive advantages but it also has disadvantages it's very busy. For me it was like having a hotel on Oxford Street in London, except you have a few more trees.

For me the hotel lacks a wow factor in the lobby....I could literally be anywhere it's nice but fairly boring. I went for breakfast which is basically in the basement of the hotel, it has a glass atrium so you do get natural light but it's still it's basically in the basement. The reception I received entering the breakfast room was just about acceptable but not  particularly warm and I was left a menu. A friendly waitress came over and explained the buffet or al la carte. I was decided to go buffet and ordered coffee.  Overall the service was poor and worst still for me was the selection on offer, not MO at all it was limited.

The Juice was self service and the fruit I thought fairly limiting for an MO, basically kiwi, one type of melon and pineapple but it was all cut up into ridiculously small cubes, I don't slabs of fruit but neither do I want sugar cube size. The bread/pastries likewise a very small range nothing special whatsoever. The coffee arrived and for an international hotel chain I thought was fairly poor, very weak and in a metal jug which was only half full. 

Then the waiter came over and asked if I wanted eggs cooked, I told him I was having the buffet but he said no you can have eggs cooked so I said fine, scrambled eggs with ham. What came out was awful, tasteless mountain of egg in a bowl. This is MO for goodness sake, what was given to me was not international standard, it was the worst I've seen or tasted for a very long time. I decided to go over to the buffet instead. Again I thought the selection was very limited. Yes they had lots of ham but that was about it. I decided to leave it. 

At no point did anyone ask me if I wanted anything, more coffee, no nothing and it wasn't at all busy and they had enough staff.  Many of the staff seemed to just vanish the only person I saw working was the guy behind the bar counter making coffees. 

You can probably tell by now I wasn't impressed, so this combined with the feel of the place means I will save myself a lot of money by not staying here when I come back in the summer. Barcelona is difficult place to pick a hotel, its a lottery as there so many hotels but unfortunately for me MO sadly was lacking on a number of levels and I'm sure there will be a great hotel with much cheaper rates delivering far better service.",2,2015,04,24
44,great location!,"i stayed at the mandarin oriental in barclona last week.  it is in a fantastic location...right out the door and you're on a fantastic shopping street....the hotel is very nice, modern and very clean.  the staff was very friendly and nice.  the food at the hotel was very good....the only negative i have about the hotel was the size of the rooms and the lighting in the rooms.  i had reserved one of the regular rooms....i guess i didn't see the size when doing the reservation...or realize how small they would be... the rooms we're very, very small...compact to say the least...and it wasn't a cheap price! i felt a bit claustophobic.  the room decor is nicely done, very modern, but, along with the modern theme, for some reason they thought that dimmer lights would be best...the rooms lighting is liveable, but, the bathrooms is was so dim...that's where you need a lot of light!  i tried to get an upgrade but there was no possibility....so, it was a nice hotel, but get a bigger room if you can!",4,2015,04,17
44,Form wins over substance,"first the staff is first class. No two ways about it helpful attentive the works
Location is the best.....
Rooms are very avantgarde not very functional. Small bathrooms and small beds
SO WHY THE. LESS THAN FIVE Stars?
Well the extensions on the phone dial the wrong place all the time. You try the spa you get housekeeping you dial room service you get maintenance
Then there is the shower open the hot water and wait 10 minutes!!!!'n
After three tries over two days great fix wait is only give
Air condition same thing
Water in sink doesn't go down
So I became the maintainer guy
But the guy that tried to fix it was first class .

44,"Great Service, Great Location!","My wife and i recently stayed for our honeymoon for 6 nights and the staff was just amazing. The restaurant service, the Spa, the concierge, bellmen, etc. were all the nicest people who provided impeccable service. This was one of the best luxury hotel experiences. We especially appreciated the help from the concierge desk in suggesting some great restaurants. Specifically, Marta Fernandez was extremely helpful and so nice throughout our entire stay. We had breakfast at the hotel everyday and the had drinks and appetizers at the bar a couple of times as well and it was a great time. The hotel is located in the middle of the city making getting around easy. If you want to see the beach, then staying at the W may be ideal but we wanted to see the city and by staying here, we were able to walk around easily to all the key sites in the core of the city or have short cab rides to Parc Guell and Camp Nou (FC Barcelona's stadium). We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,04,12
44,Outstanding hotel that sets a whole new standard for modern luxury!,"This is what luxury is. The staff is so professional and well-trained yet personable, that I feel like I've known them forever: Johannes who checked us in, Javier in Terrat, Albert in the concierge, Alex who helped us find taxis, Rafael in Banker's Bar, Udine by the elevator, to name a few. Nothing is too much of a trouble here: we once asked to have one item on the menu from other restaurant in the property (BistrEau) brought to the rooftop (Terrat), no problem. Now, top that with prime location, flawless property, well-appointed decor, impeccable room, lovely Shanghai Tang in-room amenities, first class gym spa & pool. A little note though, would love to have a coffee machine / teapot in the room (yes I can order from room service but I like my tea hot, straight after waking up before shower & make up). All in all, one expects a few things when staying in Mandarin Oriental; can't say I'm surprised but I'm definitely impressed.",5,2015,04,11
44,Absolutely Fantastic!,"Beautiful Room with wooden flooring and zen décor, beautiful view from the windows onto the garden, great location (its in the Pasage de Gratia which is the downtown of Barcelona) so you are surrounded by amazing shopping venues.

The Hotel Concierge is the best from among all the hotels I visited; great English, very helpful and supportive, they helped us (me and my friend) book for many of the touristic places we wished to see (ex. the Segrada de familia, flamingo show, Gaudi Park...etc), always gave us valuable advise on where to go and what to do. The Restaurant had a great breakfast selection. The roof top has a bar with a great view on the city next to the pool. One of the best hotels I visited!",5,2015,04,10

44,Sylvester the Cat,"Whilst in the room I was watching an old favourite cartoon of mine. I was watching Svlvester and Tweety Pie in Arabic. Of course there was not much talking but what I did find was that I was laughing and smiling a lot more than I have been recently in life. After Sylvester had been beaten up a few times and the Cartoon had ended I noticed to myself of how happy I was. Now I began to look around my room and outside the window and thought to myself, 'this is truly a great place to be'. I used to frequent the Mandarin in London a lot. I stayed there for weekends, entertained my guests and friends for business and pleasure and there were some really good times. Then I stopped using the Mandarin and moved over to the Jumeriah Carlton Towers after a miscommunication between my guest and the hotel reception. This was over 5 years ago. Times have been more difficult since then in business and  also life. I chose the Mandarin in Barcelona because the brand reminded me of all the fun and good times that I used to have in London. After the disaster that I had in Jumeriah Rome I wanted to go back to a trusted brand and MO Barcelona did not disappoint!! Not only did I get to watch Sylvester which reminded me of my youth but I met some of the old staff that were working in MO London in 2008-2011. They were fantastic in their greetings and it was nice to see how far they had gone in their own lives. Special mention to Carles and Jesus. Thank you for your time and hospitality. I did get to eat in all 3 restaurants within MO Barcelona and all 3 places were fantastic and a great gastronomic experience that I would highy recommend especially Restaurant Moments. The room was very bold and different to the norm with the ensuite trendy but very comfortable and spacious with lots of luxury. I enjoyed the ambience that the room generated and the sleep was very peaceful even though I was facing the street. It was a great stay in a great hotel. I could say more superlatives of how the MO went out their way to help and accommodate my every need and request but you need to experience the MO Barcelona yourself to really understand what I mean and how I felt whilst at the MO. But I think the best compliment that I can give the MO Barcelona is to say that if you want to really have the best time in Barcelona (budget permitting of course), you need to visit Parc Guell, La Pedrera, the Zoo and all the other Tourist sites that make up Barcelona  BUT foremost and up most you need to stay in Manadrin Oriental. This is the Hotel to stay in. I've visited Barcelona 5 times previous and this was my favourite visit by  miles. And if you are lucky like me during your stay, you will be able to watch a childhood friend on TV. Thank you very much MO Barcelona",5,2015,04,08

I wish we had to the money to afford to stay in this hotel and the view did not disappoint, we all had a lovely champagne cocktail followed by some complimentary snacks. The staff were all very friendly and made us feel very welcome despite us not being staying guests at the hotel and even gave us some tips on where to go for dinner. I would definitely return for drinks if I came back to Barcelona and the sushi looked pretty amazing too. ",5,2015,03,28
44,Elegant and prime location!,"We stayed in the beautiful property for 6 days, we were in the 5th floor,  the hotel as you’ve seen is on the busy street of Passeig de Gracia- where all the high end plus some other stores are. The hotel is pretty new, very elegant.  We loved it here. Our room wasn’t facing the street so it was kind of quiet and no issues with noise. The room was very comfortable, the bed was as well. The shower is separated from the toilet room. Storage is kind of limited.  We had breakfast at the Bistro and it was so good and tasty, a lot of great options. The room provides you with waters and turndown service every night.  The price was acceptable for the room and service, we knew Europe was expensive. Down the street from this hotel it is the Casa Batllo and Casa Mila. We visited the indoor pool and gym, really nice facilities. There’s a view from our hotel roof  of the Sagrada Familia. It is also a short walk to the Ramblas/Boqueria. The staff at the hotel was very attentive, excellent service from everyone. I was  very pleased with the Hotel. We used their car service to and from the airport.",5,2015,03,24
44,Beautiful hotel!,"We stayed at the MO for four nights in Barcelona. The hotel is very well situated to tourist attractions and high end shopping as well as local boutiques.

44,Great Hotel!,We stayed at this hotel as a family of five. The rooms are very nice with aqua de Palma products and very comfortable beds. Breakfast is a hi light! You are every close to all the attractions and shopping.,5,2015,03,17
44,Nothing bureaucratic about this mandarin!,"Names can mislead - a mandarin is a bureaucrat, and this hotel is anything but that! Staff make real efforts to be friendly and nothing seems to be too much trouble. 
Whilst it is expensive, there are lots of unexpected additional amenities. Hair straighteners for the ladies and rolled up yoga mats in the wardrobes!
I very much enjoyed my stay - the food was very good and the spa a treat. One observation: the pool is a little dark and could be just a little better lit - the pool shower would benefit from having shower gel. Otherwise, top notch. ",5,2015,03,16
44,Perfect rooms!,"It is very well located on Paseo de Gracia, near restaurants, stores... beautiful room looking on to Paseo de Gracia, no noise. Great service from everyone you encounter. I like this hotel, we never stay in a Mandarin Oriental before, from now on I will look if there is one in any city I go.",5,2015,03,14
44,Fantastic,"The hotel is very nice and comfortable,only the bathroom could be updated..
The room was very nice and quiet.breakfast was superb.the fitness is ok ,swimming pool and spa very good.the staff young and dynamic and friendly.i would return to the Mandarin Oriental

44,Best Hotel in Barcelona and amazing service,"I like to write reviews if places have problems or places are good. This one is easy. I have been in Barcelona many times and this Hotel is the best one. Location, building, decoration and (most important) incredible service. It is expensive but if your travel is about experiences then you will get a perfect one.",5,2015,03,14
44,Service that has never been so good!!!,"We often stay at the MO Singapore and a few years ago at the MO Munich so it was without hesitation that we chose the MO Barcelona. We know this brand very well and its attention to detail.
From the moment the taxi pulled up and the doorman took our bags we knew this would be a special experience. I have never experienced the level of service from the staff at the MO Barcelona, not one staff member was grumpy or unhelpful during our stay. The staff appear to actually enjoy their jobs, requests are met with a smile and professionally executed.
The concierge are fantastic and never tired of our requests for information on restaurants, metro stops, tapas bars.
I celebrated my birthday at the Hotel and we arrived home after dinner to find a bottle of Spanish sparkling with a cheery note wishing me a happy birthday. This was an especially lovely gesture on the part of the Hotel.
The room is compact, the bathrooms are great but it is the staff at this Hotel that has made the visit to Barcelona so memorable. Oh and they offer the use of an IPad whilst staying at the Hotel to keep in touch.
We had an early train departure and the Hotel arranged for coffee to be sent to our room because we were leaving before breakfast started. Such attention to detail!
This is an expensive Hotel but if you can afford it stay here, you may be surprised or perhaps dazzled by the level of service.",5,2015,03,13
44,Very bad value! Did not feel like a Mandarin Oriental,"Stayed in a DELUXE BOULEVARD ROOM KING UPSCALE CITY VIEW (room 608) and did not seem a 34 sqf. room at all. There was no bidet in the bathroom, no complimentary wifi at 470 euro/night. The two starred restaurant (Moments) was absolutely not worth it. The bar is very nice but have very poor heating lamps outdoor so it is not so comfortable being outside in the winter period. The wonderful roof terrace was closed even though the outside temperature was about 17/18 Celsius. Would not go there again in Barcelona.
              ",3,2015,03,11
44,The best hotel in Barcelona,"This hotel is standing out of all other hotels in terms of service, food quality and also the friendliness of the employees. It is a special experience and makes this hotel unique.  My favorite hotel in Barcelona!",5,2015,03,10
44,Best hotel in Barcelona,"We had received exceptional services since we stepped in the hotel. All the staffs are very professional, service-minded and friendly. Room size is reasonable with a huge bathroom. The hotel is new, modern, and well decorated. When it comes to hotel location, no other hotel in Barcelona can beat Mandarin Oriental. The hotel is located right opposite to Casa Batllo and on the city main shopping street. The hotel's restaurant, Moments, is one of the best restaurants in Barcelona. The service at the restaurant is also exceptional. The food are divine with a very reasonable price for 2 starred Michelin restaurant. The only negative comment we have for the hotel is breakfast. The choices are very limited and doesn't taste that good.",5,2015,03,08
44,Valentines Weekend - just perfect.,"I booked a Valentines special. Got an upgrade into a suite. The room was excellent. Staff was always friendly and the concerige was able to arrange several reservations in advance. Just when I need something quick, they forgot it (one negative aspect of the trip) Of course such a hotel has its price. Therefore, if you want to save money, simply dont go there. If you want pure luuxury, book it. Breakfast is nice, but if you want to have dinner in the 2 Star restaurant; NO chance! I hoped they leave some reservation possibilities for hotel guest, but unfortunatly not. (The second negative aspect). But in total a great Hotel to stay.",5,2015,03,06
44,good experience,The Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is a very friendly & nice hotel.  Room we stayed is very nice overlooking the boulvard with a small balcony.  Although its a bit small but the design are good.  Just missing the bathtub after a long walk.  I will definitnely be back to tis hotel.,4,2015,03,06

44,"I like this hotel, SUPER!!!",This is a fantastic hotel and staff. Our stay was perfect. This is a great for people with families who still want a bit of luxury. Can’t wait to return. Excellent service and comfortable bed. In room coffee and tea would have been nice. Staff is open and friendly. I and my family had a very enjoyable stay and the room was lovely and relaxing. We have stayed at the hotel three times before and we can say that it is a wonderful hotel. All was very good. We are looking forward for our next visit! Thank you a lot.,5,2015,02,26
44,Wonderful staff,"This is a luxurious hotel with many nice features but my rating is largely due to the wonderful staff. Centrally located on Passeig de Graci, this hotel was very convenient to everything we scheduled during our stay in Barcelona. Entire staff were wonderful. Concierge Sebastian in particular made our stay truly memorable. Every restaurant recommendation was excellent and exceeded any that we tried on our own. If you want to have a wonderful stay in Barcelona, stay here and speak with Sebastian! As to the rooms and amenities, the pool, spa and gym are nicely done and were a welcome and relaxing respite at the end of the day. I suggest that if you are going to spend much of the day in your room the rear courtyard might be a bit noisy with a school playground as your neighbor. I would take a street view if I stay here again. Also not a big fan of the trendy glass walls and touchy lighting controls that are be so popular in luxury hotels in recent years. Even with these annoyances the overall comfort, convenience and fantastic staff made our stay here pleasant and memorable.",5,2015,02,23
44,Great service.,"Great and attentive service. Rooms on front can be noisy. Smaller rooms are, well too small.  The surfaces while being cool are sharp and somewhat impractical.  Being spain, i have experienced many technical difficulties with lack of hot h2o to phones not working to weird snafus with stylish but poorly executed tech stuff in rooms- blinds, tv, stereo, lights. Spanish and itslians live tech o style in rooms that driver americans crazy- i dont need to turn the lights on in the bar from my bedside. The restsurant is great. Try mezze platter or fresh flatbread that comes hot and puffed. Get a room with a tub.  Try the spa and steam rooms. Nice. I like the city atmosphere over hotel arts or other trendy spots. And again, cannot fsult the service even one bit.",5,2015,02,22
44,It was a very nice stay,"It was my first stay in a Mandarin Oriental hotel and my expectations were very high. I felt welcome since the very first moment I entered and the Staff were always obliging and eager to help us. Nice room, good breakfast and  a great location make this hotel as one of the best choices in Barcelona. Good job.",5,2015,02,18
44,Fabulous hotel with happy staff,"We stayed for New Year 2014 as a family. This hotel would have to have the friendliest staff that I have ever experienced. Nothing was too much trouble.
Wonderful hotel, fabulous New Year party, and stunning location.",5,2015,02,11
44,The place to stay in Barcelona,"The location on Paseo de Gracia is excellent. The hotel is beautiful, the architect is to be commended. The staff is friendly, corteous and helpful. After the first day most knew my name. The breakfast is excellent. The wifi is high speed and free. The rooms are spectacular and have all sorts of amenities. I could go on and on but suffice to say, I am a fan.",5,2015,02,06
44,BEST IN BARCELONA,"Without a doubt, the Mandarin Oriental is the perfect hotel for the traveler who craves style, elegance and value.  Business or pleasure it is perfectly located and my go to choice any time I travel to Barcelona.
              ",5,2015,02,03
44,"Very nice but could do better, especially for a Mandarin Oriental","Stayed here for 6 nights in January 2015.

Room: we booked a Studio Suite for about EUR 900/night.  The room was superb - the sitting / living area is not separate from the bedroom but we loved that (personal taste), it made the bedroom large and airy.  The iPod/iPhone Bowers & Wilkins dock was very good, the desk was well appointed (includes two USD points for charging - very helpful touch).  The bathroom was extremely well designed and the walk-in wardrobe was spacious (although the automatic motion-detecting light did not always work well - minor niggle only).  We thought overall it was a little bit pricey for what it was but maybe that's just Barcelona.

Restaurants: breakfast was amazingly good - do try the eggs and the toast, among the best we've had.  Service was overall good but they made 1-2 mistakes every day - would serve us an omelette when we'd ordered scrambled eggs; would forget orders.  But nothing serious and overall a good experience.  Dinner was not as memorable - the 'main' restaurant had a new chef when we went, the food was sometimes excellent, sometimes weird, it was as if the chef was trying too hard to be creative (but then, maybe just a question of taste); service at dinner was less good, they seemed a bit under-staffed and would sometimes leave our table abruptly before we'd asked what we wanted!  The Michelin-starred restaurant was a disappointment in terms of both food and decor - it was really nothing special, although service was very decent.  The bar, Banker's, had an original design, service was very good there but music was too loud and it had too few customers to have a proper ambience - not somewhere we'd recommend.

Reception & Butler: the butler service was impressive - the head butler helped us seamless with a restaurant booking before we'd arrived, responding to emails within minutes.  We met her (Ms Mayte) there, she was always helpful and nice.  Reception was not as good - they made a few mistakes at check-out and did not fully understand how to apply credits included in our package, we wasted a bit of time with that.  The bellmen were also a bit too relaxed - couldn't be bothered to help us depart in the rain with our luggage and came with their umbrellas after we'd sat in the car!

Concierge: not more than ""OK.  A bit fishy how many times they'd tell us that a restaurant we wanted to book was ""not answering"" and ""must be too busy to even answer the phone"" and the concierge would push their particular choice of restaurant on us; when we called, the restaurant which was not answering the concierge 'miraculously' answered us!  Not the best experience there.

Location: very nice on Paseig de Gracia - both for shopping and sight-seeing.  It's on a large and airy street and most of the places we wanted to visit were within walking distance (within 25-30 minutes).

Overall: we give them four stars because, while the room was very nice, the location was superb and the service generally OK, it was a bit over-priced and service levels from some members of staff should be reviewed - it is not a Mandarin Oriental service and they are a bit too relaxed sometimes.",4,2015,02,01
44,Lifesaver,"After checking out, I had realised several hours later that I had left some important documents in the room. Thankfully, housekeeping had seen it fit to hold on to the folder and were professional enough not to look into the file until I had provided my express permission. Imagine my relief. 

I will absolutely recommend this hotel for its amazing service and highly trained staff, plus the fact that the location is unbeatable, and it is a very well-appointed property. Great amenities, friendly people and a real home away from home. ",5,2015,02,01
44,Not for me,"Very expense given other 5 star hotels in Barcelona. No coffee making in the room so a simple two cups of coffee cost you 16 euro. Wifi is not free so for 24 hours this cost 18 euro. Breakfast not included in the price (when many others are). Rooms are sparse (sorry minimalistic) and feel impersonal. Pillows on the bead are a massive lump of things.  Staff great and service good.
              ",3,2015,01,31
44,Food not great,"We love the bar but decided to book the Bistro for our wedding anniversary. The staff were very attentive apart from the main guy who took our order, did not care one bit about our eating restrictions (which were not massive!) was really patronising as he know we were English but still talked in Spanish and at one point when i said we did not understand said 'well u asked"" quite clearly in english! Not what we expect at such a lovely hotel and we will remember our 2nd anniversary as not food we wanted to eat along with rubbish service",2,2015,01,26
44,"Satisfaction, a guarantee","The Mandarin Oriental chain is well known for their excellence. In Barcelona, they raised the bar. My wife and I were fortunate to have booked at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona for 5 nights in January 2015. On arrival at the hotel, located in a prime position diagonally opposite from a Guadi creation, Casa Batllo, we were greeted outside the hotel and escorted directly to our room. All check-in formalities were conducted in the room. This was the start of the personal service that made us sad to depart. 
On being shown the room, I realised that while it was large, we were travelling heavy (with 5 suitcases in total) and we required more space. While our request was being processed, we were taken to the bankers bar to relax with a choice from the extensive offering. After about half an hour, we were escorted to the Terrace Suite, accommodation with a large balcony overlooking the Passeig de Gracia. We cracked open the complimentary wine and watched the sun set, what a treat. The Suite came with a personal butler service (more about that later)!
Being our first visit to Barcelona, we required guidance with what to see, where to eat, and moreover when to do these. The concierge service were exceptional. They took the time to note the kind of people we were - our likes and dislikes including our restaurant preferences. When we next spoke to them, all that detail was available and they were able to tailor visits to our preferences. We hit it off with Albert and from then on, he guided us through our discovery of Barcelona, including suggesting that we attend the annual 3 Kings Parade and moreover the exact location where we should watch it. We would never have known about this unique local event which was an absolute delight watching the thousands of parents and children lining the streets, some people with upturned umbrellas to catch the candy thrown from the passing brightly lit floats.
Our complimentary breakfast was one of the best we have enjoyed at a hotel. The usual hot foods, eggs, etc., but the buffet included Asian, Middle Eastern, Catalonian and European breakfast foods. Most impressive however, was that from the 2nd breakfast, they knew our coffee orders and asked when seated if we would like the same as yesterday!
We didn’t really understand what the butler service was about, but soon learnt its value. My wife had bought a shirt in a local shop and when taking it out one morning to wear it noticed that it still had the security tag (which had not activated on leaving the store). The butler took the top and invoice to the store and returned the item within 20 minutes!
And finally, I visited the gym on 4 occasions, it was fantastic. The standard of equipment was excellent. One early morning I was first to arrive and couldn’t adjust the air-conditioning to my liking. I called the butler who remotely set the temperature. This is a hotel ready to pamper and enjoy! Well worth the rate",5,2015,01,26
44,"Friendly Staff, perfect location!","The hotel is well situated. Close to  the main shopping district!
Staff are very friendly and accommodating. 
Food in main restaurant is the best!
Thank you team for the excellent service!
Highly recommended, value for money!",5,2015,01,20
44,Fantastic - probably the best hotel I've ever stayed in,"From the moment I arrived, the Mandarin Oriental was everything I could've hoped for.  I had asked for a room that was quiet, and they gave me a Garden Deluxe room that faced the back of the hotel rather than the street.  My room had a nice balcony with table and chairs, and a view of the garden below.  The room itself was beautiful -- very modern yet comfortable, very clean. Amenities were a really nice touch -- they seem to think of everything (luxury toiletries, adapters, tech cables, etc.)  Wifi was not included in my rate, so I paid extra.  The hi speed wifi wasn't cheap, but it was honestly the fastest, most reliable service I've ever experienced in a hotel.  Had dinner in the Bankers Bar one evening - great food, fun drinks.    The location is fantastic, right on Passeig de Gracia, across the street from Casa Batllo.  World class shopping and restaurants both on site and just outside.  Easy walking distance to Las Ramblas, El Born and Barri Gotic.   Sagrada Familia is a 20 min walk away; Passeig de Gracia metro station is basically outside the door, if you don't want to walk.  Anything I couldn't walk to, the staff was quick to help me get a taxi, In general, the staff was very friendly and welcoming, very attentive without being obtrusive.   I hope to return to this hotel for another visit soon.",5,2015,01,19
44,"expensive, but good!","We stayed here for 2 nights on a 6 day tour in spain. It was a big  & very gorgous hotel. Our rooms was big enough, and it was well equipped with all what we needed during our stay. the staff was very helpful with whatever was needed. Not to foget to mention The location was excellent. It was a bit expensive, but it’s worth it! I may stay there again!",5,2015,01,19
44,Just awesome,"We stayed here for 2 nights and this hotel is just awesome.  Service is second to none, every single member of staff we met could not do enough for us and made us feel so welcome.  The concierge helped us with everything we asked and gave us great restaurant recommendations.  Everything you could think of and more in the rooms and the breakfast buffet had the best selection i think i've seen.  We went swimming in the indoor pool which was very nice - there is a rooftop pool but this was shut as it was out of season but we went up to have a look and it would be great in the summer.  Great location too, just a few minutes walk from Las Ramblas, would definitely recommend this hotel if you want to treat yourself.",5,2015,01,17
44,Fantastic Hotel,"I attended a conference at the Mandarin Oriental a few days ago. From the moment of arrival you feel well taken care of. A Doorman greets you on the street and escorts to the check-in. The Entrance itself is already a wow. Rooms are clean and well equipped with anything you need - as I only had handluggage I did not bring any liquids or even shaving fooam - but no need, it's all there.
The Meeting room was also nice and the coffeebreaks superb - thanks to the demale waiter who served us - well done!
I can only highly recomment this hotel not only for business but also for leisure. For sure planning to visit again with family.",5,2015,01,15
44,Close to ideal,"I think this may be the best hotel I've stayed in (and that is comparing it to four other Mandarins and many other fine properties). The building itself, its furnishings and decoration, are flawless, but the staff set the Mandarin apart, with a competence and warmth that make staying here such a pleasure. Some of this must be down to a rigorous training program, but I don't think it can be entirely faked, and it doesn't feel fake, and it never goes over the top into obsequiousness. We stayed in the cheapest room category (Garden Deluxe) and our room was more than enough, with a big, comfortable bed; an armchair and desk; a big bathroom with freestanding bath, separate shower (which comes on at the right temperature and with good pressure, and is set a little apart so as to make it impossible to splash water over the rest of the bathroom), plenty of storage and a nice small balcony. You don't really need any more. The climate control was easy to use and seemed to work. TV - well, no English channels other than news and things like Discovery. The restaurant (Bistreau - we could not get a booking at the more formal Moments) was exceptionally good (try the ""Bravas"", here lightly fried prawns instead of the usual potatoes, and the seafood ""Bomba""), though very expensive for breakfast (very reasonable for dinner). The bar is one weak spot, because the music is set too loud for easy conversation. There's a little gym and a pool (kind of dark), and a (very costly) excellent spa. But it's the overall sense of serenity and quality, and the welcoming atmosphere, that makes staying here feel as relaxing as sinking into a warm bath at the end of a long day.",5,2015,01,07
44,WOW! Couldn't ask for more!,"My stay at Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona was one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. These guys raise the bar for excellence in so many ways I don't know if I can articulate all of it.

Let's start with location: right on Passeig de Gracia. You can't have a more central nor fashionable location just a few blocks up from El Corte Ingles as well as several other designer stores. Tiffany is RIGHT in the building....a more luxurious address you will not find! You are right near the Passeig de Gracia metro station, or should you choose to walk (which I HIGHLY recommend whilst in Barcelona), you'll find most everything a short stroll away.

In a city renowned for it's architectural treasures, the hotel is itself a work of art and study of meticulous design by Patricia Urquiola. One walks up a ramp from Passeig de Gracia through an enclosed six-story atrium into a warm, welcoming urban retreat. 

A refreshing cup of tea is served while checking in at the small reception desk. From there you are taken to you room which is richly appointed in modern, yet classical decor and furnishings. All of the modern amenities are included with plenty of powerpoint and an iPod doc. The beds are ultra comfortable and the bathroom is AMAZING. Rainforest showers and an oversized tub, and of course Shanghai Tang Mandarin Tea product to keep you refreshed are all what await you.

I was regrettably not able to dine at the hotel (save for a late night call to room service after a long night bar-hopping!) One does not simply walk into Michelin-starred Moments on a whim, so I'll have to plan more thoroughly next time! I did however enjoy some pleasant drinks at their very classy bar, Banker's Bar.

The level of service is truly what sets the Mandarin Oriental brand apart from most other hotel brands. The staff all know your name, even staff members whom you don't interact with. They are all eager to do whatever it takes to ensure that your stay is perfect and their service is warm, graceful and genuine.

I have to give a special shout out to Albert who works at the concierge desk. He made an OUTSTANDING restaurant recommendation and even called in the reservation for me. When I arrived at the restaurant they were expecting me and greeted me by name. This was such an amazing experience on my first day after arriving on a long flight.

For most people, a hotel stay is just about a bed, four walls, and a roof. Just the basics will do and there is no sense paying extra for a place where they're just going to sleep-there is nothing wrong with the. But for some, their accommodation is just as  important a part of the travel as sightseeing or eating. For those who travel for business, their accommodation is a place where they can relax and be looked after by people who genuinely care about their comfort, happiness and well-being. These people are willing to pay substantially more for that experience. 

I  work very hard, and I think that the experience I had is great value for money. I won't soon forget the comfort, or the smiling faces of the staff or their genuine warmth and kindness. If you're traveling to Barcelona and want a 5-Star experience through and through, looking no further than Mandarin Oriental.",5,2015,01,05
44,Elegance and Luxury on Paseo de Gracia,"20 years as a meeting and incentive professional has somewhat attuned my otherwise deaf sensibilities to product and service standards in hospitality that might be categorised as luxury. Familiarity with high end luxury often fosters fatigue and you can easily find yourself adopting that teenage “whatever” approach. However, Mandarin Oriental manages to vary the luxury tune sufficiently to keep you surprised and delighted no matter how entitled or complacent you may have become.  Like the way the housekeeper leaves a beautiful fan shaped book-mark in your paperback on the night stand. Or the nice yoga mat in the wardrobe. Or the extra box of bathroom amenities with a razor and comb.

Around the property, too,  there’s a high design ethos. Mandarin Oriental eschews the cookie-cutter consistency favoured by other chain properties, seeking, instead, to reflect across its properties the unique identity of the destination. Thus this property takes its inspiration from Barcelona as a design innovator, achieving a truly satisfying contemporary hospitality experience that’s both luxurious and light, design-led but truly functional.

Carved from a space previously occupied by a bank, some guest rooms are long and narrow yet clever interior design creates the impression of light filled spaciousness. A magnolia / cream / beige colour palette reinforces the sense of light as does the airy openness of the bathrooms which use sliding glass doors and lots of mirrors. While this is a boutique property with only 120 guest rooms (of which 30 are suites), it is perfect for up-scale incentives and high end C-level meetings. Nicolás Verdú takes care of all group enquiries and also shared this beautiful e-book with me, highlighting the design features of this magnificent property.

If you're inclined to take a day trip you can find the tourist center and tour buses at Placa de Catalunya just 10 minutes away on foot. The hotel is modern but not sterile.

Service at the Mandarin Barcelona is always excellent...friendliness, professionalism, making you feel welcome and at home... Rooms are generally extremely good even thiugh some can be a bit on the smallish side. These suites, however are extremely ample and comfortable.

44,Loved the location,"Sleek and modern with excellent service.

We loved everything about our stay here. Has to be the best bathrooms of any hotel I have stayed in. They even offer a service to have someone draw a bath for you. My stay was too short to enjoy that so I guess I will have to book another trip.

A little warning! If you are heading to the airport. I would not recommend the packing service that the hotel offers. They will both unpack your bags ( thumps up on that) and repack on departure. For airport security reasons this is not a good option in my opinion.

The hotel itself is well situated, literally steps away from shopping and Gaudi sites; very walkable to just about all (except Guell) of the Gaudi sites, gothic quarter, restaurants etc

The rooms are well appointed and chic. The courtyard view Mandarin room was great -- quiet and spacious with a delightful balcony.

44,Elegant hotel with great location.,"We stayed here for 3 nights on a 10 day trip to Spain. This hotel was extremely elegant. We had a 1 bedroom suite with a living room, balcony and private butler(We never used the butler). All the amenities were luxurious, the staff was more than willing to help with whatever was needed, and The location was excellent. I did have a few negatives with the hotel. First at check in. We arrived a few hours early for check in and our room was not ready. This is understandable. However, when you have been traveling all day with an infant and your room is ready more than an hour late that is unacceptable. Especially when your spending $1200/night. The breakfast, which was also very expensive was ok, not great. Last at check out I noticed there were two bad charges on my bill. A $70 tip was added when I clearly signed for $25, and a mini bar charge was added for about $100 which was not mine. The manager fixed both these issues immediately. Again this hotel was very nice but I feel the value for the price was not good.",4,2014,12,12

44,Barcelona City Center Luxury,"From the greeting on arrival, to all of the staf greeting you by name- this is a luxury property that will leave you feeling special.  Fantastic service on all levels- from the bellman anticipating your need for a car, taxi, or umbrella to the breakfast staff recognizing your fatigue from partying too much and having the coffee waiting on your breakfast table.  Spa services excellent.  You will not be disappointed",5,2014,12,06
44,"Great Hotel, Wonderful Location","We highly recommend the Mandarin Oriental as a place to stay in Barcelona, whether for pleasure or business.

The Mandarin Oriental is everything you would expect in a five star luxury hotel: great bed, wonderful linens, pillows, towels, luxuriant shower (no tub, but we didn’t want one), ample electrical outlets, closet and drawer space, night lights, maid service twice daily, free Wi-Fi and daily newspaper, etc.

Some nice touches – thermostat that can be set to either Celsius or Fahrenheit, drawers that pull closed automatically when they are a few inches away from the cabinet.

We stayed for five nights in a very large room (the hotel called it a “suite” on the room signage) on the first floor in the new section (opened April 2014, we were told), facing on the street, Paseo de Garcia, but very quite. The hotel did a great job on noise deadening the windows and walls in this new section, even for a room on the first floor.  You should not hesitate to stay in a room facing the street.

The staff, especially for breakfast, at the restaurant Bistreau, was extremely gracious, and the breakfasts are very good.  The dinner menu is more limited, but it was adequate. We didn’t try the fine dining restaurant, Moments, as we were not in the mood for the Michelin star type restaurant.

The Bankers Bar was too noisy (piped in music) for us but many others will enjoy the buzz. The staff in the bar (Giuseppe in particular) was very welcoming, but we preferred to walk down the street to the Majestic Hotel lobby bar (very pleasant) where we could enjoy a drink before dinner without straining to hear each other.

The staff at reception and the concierge are all very good, professional, and knowledgeable. They really helped make our stay a very pleasant one.

Minor cavils:  the drawer on the desk in the room is on the wrong side (away from the wall) and I kept banging my knee against the sharp end almost every time I got up (design flaw!).  Also the desk chair was very hard. I used my iPad for only an hour or so in the morning or evening, and I was uncomfortable sitting for that short a period of time.  If you were trying to use this chair to work from this desk for a few hours, I suspect you would be very uncomfortable.  As others have noted, you should ensure that the person escorting you to the room explains how everything works – it took us a few days to figure out how to turn on the floor lamp (it’s next to the door) and to transfer the sound on the TV/radio from the bathroom to the bedroom (there’s a dial in the bathroom).  We never did figure out what the device on the desk was, or how it worked.

The location of the hotel (in the Eixample district) was perfect for us, but some visitors to Barcelona may prefer to be closer to the Old Town or Montjuic.

All in all, these is one of the best hotels we’ve experienced.",5,2014,12,04
44,BANKER’S Nº3 at Banker´s Bar,I have been to Banker´s Bar many times and it is by far my favorite cocktail bar in Barcelona. The bar has a beautiful ceiling fashioned from original security boxes as the building was formerly used as a bank. Besides the beautiful minimalistic design you can find some of the best cocktails of Barcelona all thanks to the head bardtender Giuseppe Baldi. Beautiful service and presentation. My latest favorite cocktail is by far Banker´s Nº3 and I can truly say that is exquisite. If you don´t believe me go and try it yourself.,5,2014,12,04
44,Gorgeous hotel in a shopping location.,"I stayed here with a friend in February 2013, for leisure. The Mandarin Oriental ensures that every aspect of your stay is full of indulgence. As soon as we stood still long enough we were approached by staff with a hot drink, friendly chat, and sincerity. The cocktail master Giuseppe was really nice and professional. I cannot fault this hotel for design, service or experience. The rooms and amenities are really nice.

The only 'down' side was that the steam room was out of order when I used the pool but that was it. Oh, and the Eggs Benedict I'd ordered for breakfast looked odd but tasted nice enough, and I don't think the choices during breakfast looked that vast in comparison to other hotels I have stayed at, but I did not go for the buffet option so cannot comment on it.

All in all, I had a wonderful stay and would recommend to others.",5,2014,12,03
44,Barcelona's best,"This is the second time I stay here. I love the catwalk, the nice staff and the very comfortable rooms. The breakfast is incredible and the bar is spectacular with all its old safety deposit box all over the place. The pool is a nice feature and the lobby shop probably the poshest in the world - Manolo Blahnik. I am having breakfast now, and I will sit here and enjoy until they throw me out.
I am a fan:-)",5,2014,12,02
44,A reference ,"Such a special place! People are highly welcoming, the restaurant downstairs makes so special tapas, amazing tastes, I recommend bravas, marriage and special mention for croquette with a glass of priorat
Housekeepers are exceptional, service great and concierge efficient, and the building.... The bankers bar ... Try the swimming pool also! Two things to improve : no more cigars available, even if the Barman found small ones (great thanks) and the wifi!
Congratulations ",5,2014,11,23
44,Wonderful luxury hotel in Barcelona,"My wife and I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in central Barcelona for a 3 night mini-break in early November.  We didn't know the city and really picked the hotel based on good reviews and the fact it had a swimming pool...safe to say that we had a wonderful time and the hotel was exquisite.  Top class service throughout, with an extremely helpful concierge desk. We chose a 'garden view' room on the 3rd floor.  I think this was slightly cheaper than a street view room, but in my opinion that is the right side to be staying...you maybe miss the 'people watching' element of looking out onto the street, but being able to sit out on the balcony overlooking a quiet urban garden was lovely.  The room was fantastic - comfortable bed and excellent walk in shower.  The pool in the spa didn't disappoint either - a good size and very quiet which was perfect. They also have a steam room by the pool which is FOC for guests. Breakfast was tasty and 'comprehensive', so something there for everybody.  The hotel is also in a brilliant location in Barcelona, right in the heart of the up market shopping area, and a couple of minutes walk away from some great Gaudi buildings as well.
It isn't cheap, but if you want a top quality hotel in Barcelona that ticks all the boxes then you won't be disappointed with this",5,2014,11,23
44,Stunning service as ever,"Always such a joy to stay with Mandarin and they go the extra mile. Good location, great studio apartment, balcony and an amazing bathroom you just wanted to sit and relax in the bath or shower.Really love design so more of an apartment then hotel feel.

Its a shame Terrat their roof terrace and garden was closed for the winter.",5,2014,11,21
44,Barcelona's Pearl,"An exquisite hotel offering all the standards and quality expected from a Mandarin Oriental. The lobby is very Zen, decorated with very light colors and excellent natural light.  The staff is friendly and the bedrooms are comfortable. The location couldn't be better, in Passeig de Gracia - one of the most chic avenues of Spain.",5,2014,11,20
44,Pricey but great staff,Enjoyed the hotel and its very contemporary look.  New restaurant was very good. As always the MO staff excel at guest service.  My rating is due to the unique requirements of being with a traveler in a wheel chair.  We were in a Mandarin room. Not sure if all have separate bath and shower but these required additional moves back and forth between the two rooms. We never found an easy and direct route to the restaurant. We had to go to lobby and transfer to another elevator which was hidden and small.  The long push up from street entry can be an effort.  Going down is a breeze.  Shopping is near and no matter your style or budget easily found. Hotel is central to all the visitor spots and points of interest.,4,2014,11,20
44,Best hotel in Barcelona par excellence,This is without doubt one of the finest hotels in Barcelona I enjoyed my stay here and particularly enjoy the spa and the bank is bar which is unique the staff are without exception polite friendly and extremely accommodating one of the best values for luxury hotels in Barcelona is not in Europe,5,2014,11,11
44,Our new home in Barcelona,"Stayed here pre-cruise for 2 days and was extremely pleased with the service and helpfulness of the staff. The room, while small compared to US sizes, was impeccable and comfortable. The room decor was minimal and lacking colors. (Mostly Black/white/grey/mirrors).
Early morning check-in was a most welcome surprise after a red-eye flight and greatly appreciated. 
Concierge service was excellent and very knowledgeable with excellent restaurant recommendations and perfect guided tour arrangements,. 
Sidebar: Bellman might be the tallest residents in the city. It seemed like everyone of them was over 2 meters tall.",5,2014,11,10
44,We are fans of MO Barcelona,"We stayed at this hotel on the last 3 nights of our Spain adventure in August. What a superb way to end our visit. There was road works in front of the hotel but we called when we arrived and 2 people rushed to meet us around the corner and helped park our car. The warm welcome made up for this little inconvenience that was not the hotel's fault. We were upgraded to a wonderful suite and really appreciate this generous gesture. 

The service is just beyond words - from housekeeping to the concierge to the gentlemen at the front of the hotel. When we told them we need to retrieve our car to return to the rental company at the Estacion Sants, we were so touched when we got into the car and saw that they had programmed the location in the GPS for us. That is great service for you ! Nice touch MO Barcelona.

The buffet breakfast has everything you need, very interesting selection of food and you can order additional hot food from a menu as well. The quality of the in-room dining food is good too. 
Location is unbeatable like what the other reviewers said. 
This hotel is beautifully designed and has a lot of style. The staff are intuitive, very friendly and they are passionate to give their best. It's such a special hotel, in a great location surrounded by lots of shops, cafes, attractions etc... Our favourite Tapas 24 is just around the corner. Can't wait to return to this hotel !",5,2014,11,02
44,Another great stay (four nights in Oct),"Yet another great stay, room was overlooking the garden restaurant, nice balcony, room perfect for a couple. Staff superb as always. Hotel on the main shopping street ( cross between , fifth Ave and regent street for shops.) therefore chose the garden view. this building used to be a bank therefore high ceilings , bright and airy rooms with excellent use of space. Only thing to consider is that not of lot or draw space if staying for a number of nights , and our room had no safe. Lovely bed , hotel room floors very quiet at night. Things to consider are this, I went with my wife ( no kids) so not sure if this would work for a family as the rooms have a designer feel. The bathroom we had had white opaque glass walls, that could be off putting until you realise that you cannot see a thing through them. What it does though is keep the room looking bright and very spacious without the encroaching feeling that an actual solid wall would give. there was a separate WC, sink etc elsewhere in the room (no glass doors here) The bath and shower were in a wet room and the shower was brilliant. As mentioned this used to be a bank building so it is mid block and the whole block creates as very large courtyard ( about three soccer fields wide), some of which is the hotels gardens and outside restaurant/bar , some private gardens and a school. There are also private residences over looking this courtyard. When the school kids come out to play ( you cannot see them , just hear them ) then you hear the kids playing basketball etc. that is the only noise we heard and even then you probably have to be on the balcony to hear. The windows block out most of any noise. So if the sound of kids playing annoys you then go for a room at the front. If like us you can live that occasionally but also like the peace and quite and your own balcony to sit on then try a room overlooking the garden. Hotel is a mid city so need a wall to the beach , parks etc , tour bus stops within a few hundred yards , Las Rambles couple of blocks away. Hotel restaurants are all good , bar great and the roof top bar and plunge pool is a good place to relax and have a drink",5,2014,11,01
44,We loved the location,"Great hotel in a beautiful part of the city. The hotel also has several wonderful dinning options.

We booked two separate rooms for this stay. Both were gorgeous in design and had amazing showers and bath tubs.

The hotel even has butler service!! My only regret was that I was not there long enough to have the staff prepare you a bath. Maybe next time.

Plus how can you go wrong with a hotel that has a Tiffany store almost in the lobby!",4,2014,10,26
44,Architectural gem,A wonderful oasis in the hub of the city.  Walking distance to many attractions.  Modern and clean design.  Lovely pool and steam areas.  Restaurants are superb on the property. Staff great! Spa is lovely as well.,5,2014,10,23
44,everything focused around your well being!,"this, I dare say say, was a hotel that really impressed me for its cleverness!! (if there is such a thing). the hotel room are so well and intelligently designed to really meet your needs. fascinated by the small details and impressed by the simplicity!! 
the personnel were very accommodating and made no fuss when asked to be moved to a higher floor for fear of noise. unfortunately there were road works and could be heart in the room so opt for a garden room to avoid the noise. on the weekend though you couldn't hear a thing.

the location is fantastic.
the concierge service was not top notch and were unreliable at 2 occasions. I think they are too busy with the tendency to forget your requests the minute you leave their desk. improvement is needed there. otherwise I really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it with no hesitation.",4,2014,10,19
44,Amazing stay,The location can not be better. Service everywhere was top notch and friendly. Do not miss having a meal of a lifetime at Moments. Concierge staff was very helpful. The breakfast buffet was amazing and the spa is an urban oasis,5,2014,10,14
44,Worth every euro!,This was our first stop on a two week trip to Spain. Our travel agent recommended the Mandarin and we were not disappointed. The hotel is beautiful and centrally located to just about all the top 10 sites in Barcelona. The concierge staff (a big shout out to Sebastian) was first rate!  Every restaurant recommendation was terrific. The personal guide we used for two days (Bernard) was top notch. And the spa was one of the best we have ever experienced. Every staff member was warm and accommodating.,5,2014,10,14
44,Great Location,"The Mandarin is on the main avenue in Barcelona.  It is within easy walking distance of all the sights. We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly.  We enjoyed our drinks in the Bank Bar and also in the rooftop bar which has wonderful views over the city.

The rooms are very nice.  The only problem we encountered was in the bathroom.  The shower is very modern and does not have any sort of door or curtain which means the water tends to go everywhere.  It took some creativity not to drown the bathroom floor.

I would stay here again.",5,2014,10,14
44,What a shame!,"Been there for a couple of nights. Personnel very capable and friendly. The rest one big disaster:

- Sliding door between bathroom and room is simply 20 centimeters too short and won't close. No privacy on the toilet. Vapor from shower goes into room and triggers fire alarm

- Swimming pool opens at 8. No usage before 8 am

- No bathroom near to gym. Need to go to the reception

- No bathroom at the super-duper top-of-the-hotel bar. You are asked to use the ONE elevator and go pee in your room's bathroom or at the reception 

- Bikes for rent cost DOUBLE of normal prices 

Breakfast is stupendous, though. 

All in all fancy design, little functionality and a price completely beyond reason. Spend your money somewhere else. 

",1,2014,10,12
44,Just perfect,"As has been written already, everything was perfect. Just perfect. Staff outstanding, concierge was the best, rooms comfy.  We were on an amex package, and breakfast was included, and they recalled that my daughter liked English breakfast tea, and asked her if she wanted tea every morning, which she just loved.  Another amazing touch, we had a really early flight, needed to leave hotel at 5.30 am. Hotel arranged a cab, and asked if they we wanted a wake up call and send some coffee in the morning. So call at 5.00 am, then coffee was brought up at 5.15 (instead of follow up call). But get this, coffee, juice + warm coissants.   Just perfect.   Ok, a few disappointments.  No outdoor pool, just indoor and it's a bit small and dark.  Food was just ok, but we just got snacks at the roof top bar.  It's expensive, (it's the mandarin of course), and a 20 euro mojito.   Would we go back, heck yeah, if we can afford it.",5,2014,10,11
44,"Great location, wonderful staff","We arrived from the airport at 1:00 AM and as we came upon the hotel saw that there was construction on the sidewalk and the street and that we could not be dropped at the door. We were concerned that we might be disappointed. We shouldn't have been at all concerned. The driver had called to say we were arriving and we were met at the end of the street.
The service from the entire staff was superb. We had occasion to use the services of the concierge(s) and they were extremely helpful",5,2014,09,29
44,Best Hotel and Location,"The hotel is first class all the way. TAP Air Portugal lost my luggage. The concierge was just as upset as I was.  They made a million calls to help me locate it. They were helpful with reservations and were the highlight of the hotel.  The rooms were spacious, clean and extremely comfortable. This hotel is a must in Barcelona...",5,2014,09,24
44,Stay away,This wildly over priced hotel is a refurbished bank building. Unfortunately it still does not cities purpose. The rooms are woefully inadequate. For example my terrace was used as an ashtray for the rooms above. They forgot to dry the table and chairs after rain. It was very noisy. The concierge varied between unhelpful and inaccurate information. But the worst thing was being charged for thing that I did not order or recieve.,1,2014,09,23
44,Amazing service,"Such a lovely weekend at the mandarin oriental. Amazing service. The kind of service where as well as being friendly and unfailingly helpful the staff remember your breakfast drinks order each day and ask if you'd like the same again, or offer to find you a different flavour of jam just in case the four on offer already aren't quite perfect. Basically you feel like a king. Super concierge who was happy to take care of finding us dinner - whether we wanted something fancy or just local tapas - and answering lots of questions, and charming chaps on the door who gave us directions each day and welcomed us back with a smile. The invisible chambermaid tidied everything exquisitely every day. The room was small but as expected for the ""cheapest"" room on offer and had a wellstocked minibar, lots of wardrobe space and big bathroom. We used the spa a lot - great treatments, relaxing steam room. A lovely little roof terrace (with very overpriced sushi) with a dipping pool. Yummy breakfast buffet although not quite as big as the W. Pillows could have been firmer. Now I'm fault-finding- the place was just fabulous and we were lucky to stay there and felt incredibly well cared for.  (Tip: If you want to eat at ""moments"" Michelin restaurant or have spa treatments you should book ahead of your stay.) ",5,2014,09,22
44,Gorgeous hotel,"We spent a wonderful three nights in the newly opened wing of this stunning hotel – perfectly located on the Passeig de Gracia. Impeccable service by smiling, courteous and helpful staff – with great dining recommendations from their Concierge. Loved the roof top terrace, enjoyed great pre dinner drinks at Mimosa and Bankers Bar, as well as a wonderful breakfast to start each day.
 
A true home away from home.
 ",5,2014,09,19
44,nice hotel,"this is a great hotel. modern. staff very good. room nice but bad lightning in bathroom and room. rugs in the hotel are terrible, full of stains everywhere. outside our suite looks like a body was there, and badly cleaned up. good breakfast. roof top has potential but the hedge was to tall couldn't see the view.",4,2014,09,18
44,Great stay,"My wife and I visited this hotel as part of our holiday in Spain. The rooms were confortable, perhaps a little on the small side but we were aware we were staying in a city so it really didnt bother us. The staff were all very helpful and the design of the building is very modern. We would return again if were were ever in Barcelona. Whilst staying at the hotel my wife had her birthday and we decided to leave the hotel for a steak dinner. We searched on trip advisor a place to go and found one named The Venue Steak house on Carrer Casanova. It was amazing. Whilst we enjoyed our stay at the hotel the most memorable part of our trip was dining at this restaurant. The staff were polite and friendly and the steaks are imported from Ireland and were of really high quality. There menu wasn´t filled with beef there were other options too.",4,2014,09,18
44,Good hotel but why pump that smell into the hallways?,"Very well located. Excellent help, service staff is very well trained and very professional. Breakfast buffet is very nice and in a relaxing setting.  But why do they pump that perfume smell in the lobby and in the hallways.  Some might like it but we had to breath by mouth to avoid the odor which make us feel sick.  The rooms are on the small size for a hotel chain of this reputation, particularly when compared to the Ritz Art’s hotel. Our room narrowed to 10-11 feet wide in some parts due to its design.  If I opened the closet door my wife could not get into the bathroom.  The contemporary design was pleasing to us but could be unpleasant to others. When I saw the Palace hotel a few blocks away I felt I made a mistake staying here.",4,2014,09,17
44,Perfect Location for your Vacation,"The Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is perfection. From the location to the beautiful rooms and roof top pool/gardens, this hotel is a must. Ask for a room in the new section if possible. The service was always top-notch, and they did little things to make your stay more enjoyable-- welcome chocolates, ambient turndown service, champagne for our anniversary! It was a great hotel to start our vacation. Also, the location is great! The MO is set along a tree lined street, busting with designer shops. It is also an easy walk to La Rambla and you can see the Gaudi house and famous church from the roof top!",5,2014,09,16
44,the staff is the best in the world!,"I could almost rate this hotel an excellent for the staff which is about the best in the world. However, the lobby is exacty what you would see in a budget hotel in terms of size and style. Plus it is hard to get away from the advertising and even the Mandarin Oriental gets into the act by projecting a weird promotional video onto a glass wall in the middle of the lobby. The regular rooms are small but beautifully appointed, many have a very authentic barcelona view which is that of laundry and the ugly rears of the neighborhood buildings. The location is really good though! 
Currently, there is construction in the area, so morning jack hammers woke us up one day. (It is expected to be completed in October 2014 but check if this is a concern.)
The fruit bowls are a nice touch, but often the fruit the hotel delivered wasn't at all ripe yet- and fruit flies were a slight problem. Also, if I am really being picky, there is an odd, chemical smell in the hallways...
However, on the plus side, room decor is beautiful, and the dining room and breakfast are excellent.",4,2014,09,16
44,Touring Spain,Wonderful hotel in the center of the city.  Within walking distance of old town and La Rambla.  Very nice breakfast gets you ready for a day of enjoying the sights and taste of Barcelona.  Rooms are relatively spacious and very modern.,5,2014,09,16
44,"Perfect Location, Gorgeous Rooms","I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental on a recent trip to Barcelona. The staff was polite and welcoming and the atmosphere was bright and beautiful. The rooms were clean and perfectly decorated. The showers are especially cool! The hotel is not only beautiful, it is in a perfect location. It is walking distance from everything you could want in Barcelona. The Mandarin is also on a great street for shopping and dining. You will really enjoy the beauty, location, and overall experience of the Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona.",5,2014,09,14
44,Best Place to be in Barcelona!,"Best place to be in Barcelona. The hotel is beautiful, the staff is wonderful. I would like to thank  Jane,  the attentive manager of the  Blanc Brasserie and the best waiter ever, Alberto. I cut my finger during my stay and was promptly attended by the hotel manager, who treated me with great affection. Unfortunately I do not know his name, but it was a very educated, blond tall guy, Thank you so much for your help! The housekeeping was just ok, since we're talking about a five star hotel... They were very slow, and the last day, one of them left a cleaning cloth inside my suitcase, sad...",5,2014,09,14
44,Very good inner city choice,"Other then charging for Internet , nice place to stay especially if you have Amex Platinum or black card .
Beautiful , delicious breakfast and lunch buffet with excellent service .
   Currently doing construction out front , difficult access.
  Locker room downstairs under construction , try to get room in new section ",4,2014,09,12
44,MO quality and charm,"The hotel is in a great location, less than 10 minutes walk from the train station (25 mins approx from the Airport). As with other MOs the staff were excellent.

We got a double upgrade, to a Mandarin room which overlooked the garden at the rear and had an outside seating area. Nice and spacious and as usual an extremely comfy bed.

The MO hotels are not cheap, but personally I like to stay with them when I can because I know I will have a relaxing stay.

We drank in the Bankers Bar a couple of times and the barman was chatty and had a real enthusiasm about the cocktails. Breakfast in the Blanc restaurant was fine. Anytime we asked for something it was delivered very promptly and always with a smile.",5,2014,09,10
44,Beautiful hotel in central Barcelona - amazing staff!,"This is a great hotel. My favorite things about this hotel was the staff.  Each person at the hotel was helpful, professional, polite, and went out of the way to make sure I enjoyed the hotel and Barcelona. Traveling with children is difficult and this hotel made it easier.  I stayed at this hotel in August with my mother, mother in law and my two small children.  We had two rooms deluxe boulevard rooms, which provided plenty of space.  There was actually space for both cribs in one room but not ideal with toddler sleeping habits.   The bathroom, furniture and details were modern, luxurious, clean and comfortable.  The breakfast downstairs has everything you could possibly want and more (hot and cold).  We also had lunch by the pool on the roof and in the Mimosa garden in the back of the hotel - both were beautiful and peaceful.  The pool is not deep but perfect for cooling off and relaxing.  The menu by the pool is limited to sushi and lighter food but the staff had some fries and fruit brought up from downstairs for my kids so everyone was happy.  I had a wonderful facial at the spa - worth a visit if you have the time.  I also had a delicious gin and tonic in the Bankers bar.  They have a menu devoted to gin and tonics and I had one recommended to me with the local gin. Honestly, even if you don't stay at this hotel, you should go to the bankers bar and have a cocktail.  It was really that good.  Overall this is a wonderful hotel in a great city and I can't wait to visit again.",5,2014,09,09
44,Incredible staff,"Great location and facilities. Nice decor and two relaxing oases: quiet garden and rooftop pool.The most impressive feature was the staff. Every encounter with the hotel staff at every level was flawless. 
We've stayed in Barcelona a few times and at Mandarin hotels in various places. The level of service and attention to detail by the staff here is better than anything I have encountered previously. Definitely my first choice when I visit again.
Breakfast is great, lunch is ok but for dinner head out. Cocktails bar is excellent.",5,2014,09,04
44,Disappointing,"Having heard good reviews about the Mandarin Orient in London we decided on an overnight stay here but was seriously disappointed. The price at 450€+\night for a room was excessive for the quality of room.  The furniture and fittings we about as cheap as they could possibly have been and by comparison our recent stay at The Majestic just up the road could not have been a greater contrast.  We decided to try the hotels Michelin starred restaurant, highly acclaimed.  That was also very disappointing. The staff were unorganised but even worse, we had to send our food back as it was COLD.  When it was returned it was still not to a temperature that most would call acceptable.  We will definitely not be returning to this hotel or restaurant.",2,2014,09,03
44,"Opulent and as you would expect, expensive","We booked here for 4 days to experience Barcelona in style and boy does this hotel deliver. The single most impressive quality is the staff. Every single member without fail is very happy to see you and help you in any way possible. From the moment of arrival, you are taken through a well designed process to take you from the hotel entrance to your room in style and comfort. 

During your stay, the concierge desk are fantastically useful and will help with any query about visiting places of interest, booking you tickets and advising on the best way to get there. Every one of their restaurant recommendations was also, top class.

The rooms are beautifully designed and the other facilities are of the highest quality. The rooftop terrace is a particularly fantastic resource. To dip yourself in a cool pool when the midday heat becomes too much is a rare city centre luxury. The location is superb and you don't have to walk (or get a cheap cab) far to visit most of Barcelona's treasures. All extras in the hotel are, of course, ridiculously overpriced. 17 Euros for a post of tea? No free internet access?!? Phew they know how to charge. However, if you are looking to live in the lap of luxury, then that seems to be the price you have to pay.",5,2014,08,29
44,"Really nice hotel, beware of construction. ",I have stayed at this hotel 3 times now. And I have frequented the dining and bar options to many times to mention. And though I absolutely love the hotel. This last stay took a bit a way from my otherwise hotel love affair. I got the usual centurion upgrade. But this time it's a bad thing to be facing the passeo. As it means waking up to noisy construction. And also forget about valet parking while the construction goes on. So I had to park in some public spot. And carry the luggage up stairs etc. Anyway it's not the hotels fault. But it does take the last star away while it last. Thank you for the birthday cake though. And the Michelin star restaurant is to die for.  ,4,2014,08,28
44,Love it- but they have room for improvements!,"Overall a great hotel but the are lacking in a few areas. Especially the management and reception need to step up a bit, the staff is friendly but sometimes sloppy. 

Even though I have pointed out below some flaws we are happy we stayed at Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona, and we will be back; however our stay at MO in Paris is still closer to our heart. Paris is Paris.

Below you will find our experience from the different parts of the hotel.
The rooms:
The standard rooms are quite small, narrow and not that easy to have  lot of luggage in. The bathroom is fantastic, the tub is a dream! Take a special note of the beautiful sink!
Spa och pool/hamman:
This is a special place, the hamman and the pool is something you need to visit, the SPA is fabulous! Worth knowing is that there is a special private lift which goes straight to the Spa with no possible stop at lobby level to avoid being seen by other guests when you're in your bathrobe & slippers.

La Terassa: The roof top bar. Very good sushi and cava, attentive staff when they are there. We arrived one day after 11 when the roof top opens and nobody was there , no towels, no cushions to the furniture's and no cava... We called down stairs twice before we got any towels, took them about an hour to prep the roof top for us guests. The view from the roof top is magnificent and the dipping pool is just what you need to cool down. If you are looking for a swim go to the ocean or downstairs to the SPA.

Moments: Did not manage to get a table even though we were first in line on the waiting list. Make sure to book it well in advance.

Mimosa Garden: Very nice garden but not that special if you compare it with the Mandarin Oriental Parisian one. The houses around are not renovated/anything to look at so that drags the feeling and rating down.
Closes at 8 pm so no late drinks there...

Bankers Bar: Very friendly staff, attentive and professional. The room is very very nice and the possibility to sit outside and have a cigar is perfect, otherwise the cigar smokers would be forced somewhere else since the garden closes at 8 pm. The bartenders makes the place!

Blanc Brasserie & Gastrobar: All day dining, and the breakfast area. A magnificent room with very nice furniture. We had a very nice dinner and the prizes are not that hysterical, 3 courses with matching wine for 2 for around 140 Euro. Really love how they have used origami as a inspiration for the shades, discreet and classy but still contemporary. Breakfast is good but expensive, make sure to check your receipt since they charged us incorrectly twice.

Our thoughts: 
We arrived late, close to midnight and we were surprised how unpersonal the greeting was, in Tokyo, and Paris you are greeted as a star, here it was all formal; sign here and here and lets go to the room. No welcome cava, not a smile

Later on we commented that we did not find the coffee machine in our room (there was not any) and that almost all hotels have that as a standard. A day later the staff arrived with one, coffee capsules arrive an hour later. Since the machine was not included in the interior they just put it on the desk, they should off course have moved around some things to make it look good. My experience is that the staff in Paris and in Tokyo did just that, they made sure that the room looked gorgeous with you stuff in it, the bathroom, the shoes, the négligée, everything was laid out so it looked nice. In Barcelona they did not pay any attention on those details.

Another example is that they wrote the wrong age on my birthday cake, they took my husband's age, not that fun since he is 5 years older...But the cava the cake came with was very nice!

The checkout experience was very very bad. We arrived down to the reception with our luggage, it was a queue so we sat down in the sofa. Nobody came to collect our luggage. When the staff later on were available they made my husband to stand over by the reception desk even though they were just fixing and printing the receipt. The invoice was incorrect and it took them at least 15 minutes to get it fixed. It is not about the money, I would gladly pay 20 Euros for a espresso, but I do not want to argue about that in a hotel as mandarin oriental. We had to ask them to assist us with our luggage to get someone to pick it up.
I was very sad to leave the hotel with a bad feeling and a little stressed since the checkout took almost 30 minutes.. Overall, the consignee and the restaurant people is very good, the reception desk not that much.",4,2014,08,27
44,Best gin tonic of my life,"I just went to the bar for a gin tonic one night and it was an amazing experience. Staff was charming, place is wonderfully decorated and gin tonic... simply the best of my life. It's expensive (at least 15 euros per drink) but it's something you have to do once in your life.",5,2014,08,26
44,good hotel / good restaurant,"the hotel is good and nice. the location is also good and shopping is convenient.
the rooms are not that big but ok for a business stay or long weekend. the rooms are stylish and modern. Everthing is ok in this hotel and also the Restaurant / food was good.
I will go there again next time.",5,2014,08,25
44,Paradise found,"I'm a frequent traveler and regular guest of this hotel , which in my view is one of the best European hotels. Exceptionally good service, very good rooms, tasty food, superb spa and good size indoor lap pool, beautiful contemporary decor, one of the best locations in Barcelona. In addition to that, good value for money  (cheaper than the Mandarin in Paris for example).",5,2014,08,23
44,True 5 star Hotel,"The building oozes luxury even as you enter it. The entrance foyer is stylish and you certainly know you are entering a high end hotel. On being greeted by the reception staff, and offered an ice-tea even as we checked in, we were offered a substantial upgrade from our room to a much larger suite. 
The reception staff escorted us to our suite, which was simply amazing. It felt brand new - that's because it basically was - in the new building. It was also so large that it had a separate guest cloakroom/toilet as well as a large sitting/dining area, massive outdoor seating area with table and loungers, and the bedroom itself with large walk-in wardrobe and fantastic bathroom.

Everything was impeccably clean and just worked. The room was perfect and exactly what you'd expect from a 5 star hotel. Although you did have to pay additional for wi-fi, it was extremely fast (100Mbps download and around 60Mbps upload speeds!) so it felt a small price to pay for good quality internet. Other features of the room included 2 large and modern samsung TV's, a modern iPhone dock with lightning connector, I think the TV's even had AppleTV connected to them in case you wanted to stream movies to them! Overall, extremely impressive.

The hotel restaurant - Blanc - was nice and light and airy, very comfortable. We had lunch there were the fish we had (Haddock, I think?) was amazing, absolutely perfectly cooked. For dinner we decided to go and explore the city - the Concierge recommended us somewhere to eat, which also turned out to be fantastic. Would highly recommend the concierge service. 

Overall, I would not hesitate to visit again or suggest to a friend. This is what 5 star should be.",5,2014,08,22
44,Perfect,"Mandarin, the chain that originally came from Hong Kong and manage these days to take over the best locations with the most luxurious style worldwide, is a branch that will always amaze you. You can count on them, to have a stylish experience - But It is, however, mostly (in most cities, or most dates) unaffordable or climbs to immoral prices per night. Honestly, when the prices here get to 1000$ a night I wouldn't go thats for sure, but when you do luckily manage to find a room in a reasonable price (we found one at the beginning of January), this hotel is BEAUTIFUL and promises the ideal romantic weekend, its a sensual experience, full of style and comfort, relaxing and intriguing atmosphere. The location is great, the pool and spa are wonderful, you feel its new. I miss the smell of it.",5,2014,08,22
44,Excellent in every way,"Very well positioned in the center of the city without the commotion and traffic.Exclusive design ,very polite staff and a spot for breakfast that is really amazing.Spacious rooms.Very well organized.",5,2014,08,21
44,The best hotel in one of Europe's best cities,"It would be difficult to find a better hotel in Barcelona. The location is perfect as you are on a popular avenue for shopping and cafes. It's a short walk to many of the most famous areas and attractions in the city.
What will impress you the most is the staff. From check-in to Housekeeping to the Concierge staff, they couldn't have been nicer and more helpful. The Concierge staff was most excellent. Francisco was knowledgable and friendly and the amazing Carlos gave us the best suggestions. It's easy to see why this is the busiest desk in the hotel. They take care of everything!
The rooms are modern, beautiful and well-maintained. This is a fantastic hotel.",5,2014,08,17
44,Magnificent,"This beautiful, contemporary, Asian themed hotel is located in the heart of it all.  Walking distance to some Gaudi sights, the best shopping and restaurants!  The hotel has a fantastic breakfast buffet with omelets, cheeses, fruits and fantastic bread and sweet tables. A must!!!
The swimming pool is small but cozy and the lounge chairs are very comfortable.",5,2014,08,16
44,Excellent Service,"Service was excellent, as one would expect from Mandarin properties.  Rooms were small, but not atypical for Europe. Everything was very modern both inside and outside of the room.  Location is good for the city center, situated among the high-end shops (Tiffany's, Brioni, Manolo Blahnik, etc).  I prefer the seaside hotels, but if one is going to stay within the city, then this is likely the best option.  Simona in the Banker's Bar was a true pleasure, filled with great suggestions for dining and activities.  The concierge service, in general, was top-notch as we did not have a single bad suggestion on our 7-day trip.  I was not overly impressed with the restaurants:  Blanc is great for breakfast, but lacks ambiance for evening.  Terrat is the rooftop bar / restaurant, and it has only a sushi menu (I was tired of having only sushi every time I took in the pool).  Banker's Bar is nice, but the foot traffic going through there is very light.",5,2014,08,14
44,Beautiful Respite in a Great City,"It starts with the service the minute you walk in the guys at the door are friendly, accommodating, caring, and smart.  Alberto is the man. There was some construction in front of the hotel when we arrived so you could not pull up to the front of the doors but the guys at the door wee on this like white on rice. Our luggage was grabbed we were escorted up the very cool walk way and taken right to the desk.  Our room was not ready but we were taken care of never the less, I was a little bummed we did not get upgraded but the room we had was perfect plenty of space and a great bath room with a giant shower and huge soaking tub.  The concierges were fantastic, great recommendations for restaurants and sites.  We wanted to see a jazz show that was being held on a Saturday evening on top of the Guadi building up the block there was some confusion and the concierge purchased tickets for a different venue.  Upon realizing this we came back to the hotel and not only did the concierge correct the error but  paid for the concert we wanted to stay.  Breakfast was awesome kudos to Mikala (sp?) a waitress in the breakfast venue she was a great server and super accommodating.. My wife hit the spa and loved it.  The location s is perfect If you are going to Barcelona and are going to stay in a luxury hotel this is the place, look no further.  I'd love to go back",5,2014,08,12
44,A Stay of Perfection,"We were considering other hotels for our trip to Barcelona this past week and the tipping point was the number of people who said that the concierge at the Mandarin were outstanding.  We were not disappointed.  We had very little chance to plan for this vacation and as a result were heavily reliant on the concierge.  There were always at least 2 at the desk except first thing in the morning and sometimes after 9:30 at night and they worked hard to make sure they were meeting every expectation.  They always pulled out a map to show where you were going to go and they took great pride in their recommendations - following up when you passed them the next day to make sure you liked what they had recommended.  It was a flawless experience.  We worked with Marta, Albert and Francisco and I can safely say they listened to what we wanted for that day's excursion or meal and we were never disappointed.

As for the hotel itself - this too exceeded expectations.  I had read that the rooms were small - I was prepared for a tiny place with no space.  We found the opposite - not that the rooms are huge, but they are perfectly spacious with design elements that solve so many problems you are grateful for the thought that went into it.  For example, they have a box with every conceivable charger you could need in case you forget your own or need additional ones.  They provide unlimited converters for your room at no charge.  They have this night light system that is awesome - you press the button when you turn off the main lights and you get this runway of lights that make sure you can still find your way around.  Then when you shut off every light to sleep, the closet -which you pass on the way to the bathroom - has a motion sensor light that sheds this tiny bit of light through the crack in the door to make sure you don't trip or bump into something on your way in and out.  It then goes off seconds after you get to where you're going allowing you a seamless trip without your partner waking up from the light.  The closet was big enough to have extra room for us as well as two drawers and there were  shelves in a cabinet sufficient for the week's worth of clothes for two.  The room came with its own yoga mat and there was plenty of room for an adult to stretch on the floor as well as two chairs - one of which I'd like to bring home with me because its so comfortable.  The desk was sufficient for my husband to do work on with documents and a laptop.  We had a separate shower and tub and faced the street - we never heard noise even though there was construction on Passieg de Gracia - our view.  The bathroom had both a hairdryer and a flat iron! The windows come with an electrically controlled black out shade that was excellent.

The hotel feels very intimate - not like a large hotel even though there are a fair number of rooms.  There's no overwhelming hubbub of activity even though there were people of all ages there - traveling with small children, teenagers and just couples.  We greatly appreciated the restfulness of the ambiance.  

The spa was lovely (we both enjoyed excellent massages), the terrace on the roof with a dipping pool was lovely (although it lacked a bathroom), and the indoor pool and steam room were comfortable and enjoyable. It never felt overcrowded.  The gym is spacious with 2 bikes and 2 treadmills and a few other machines, a full compliment of weights, large and small fitness balls and a stretching area.  The machines aren't new but they are very well maintained.  Everything is spanking clean and someone is always coming through to restock the water and towels. 

Breakfast was amazing.  It was 39 Euros for the full buffet, 32 Euros if you didn't have the hot options.  Our breakfast was included with the rate so I'm not sure if we would have splurged everyday but the food quality and options would have made it worth it a few times.  

Location is great because it is central to everything so you can walk everywhere or take a subway and cabs are plentiful.  No cab trip from any part of the city cost more than 10 Euros to get back.  And, you're right across from one of the Gaudi homes - you can see it if you have a boulevard facing room from your window which makes it an easy thing to do.  

I hope to stay at another Mandarin one day and certainly return to Barcelona to stay at this one.  It made all the difference in the world to have this kind of experience.",5,2014,08,11
44,Amazingly helpful concierge service made our trip a huge success,"The staff at all levels, especially the amazingly helpful concierge service, helped to make our trip to Barcelona a huge success. We would not hesitate to return or recommend the Mandarin Oriental.
We felt the Mandarin Oriental is in an ideal location. While the Ramblas is chock-a-block with tourists, we wanted to avoid the crowds. The hotel is just a few blocks north of the Plaça de Catalunya in the L’Eixample district. Here, we felt almost as though we were part of the city, experiencing Barcelona with the people who live there, rather than melting into the tourist throngs in the older part of the city. But we never felt the tourist destinations we wanted to experience were out of the way.
When we checked in, we were shown two different rooms. Our goal was for quiet. The room we chose faced the back of the hotel onto the garden, and was close to a doorway the staff uses for room service. But we rarely, if ever, heard anything. The room was, indeed, quiet. There was a long hallway from the entry door to the room. We felt this added privacy.
We were there the last week in June, after school closed for the summer, and it was a holiday weekend (Festival of Sant Joan), which may have made a difference. 
From our first day, whenever we needed directions, restaurant suggestions, even translation help, the concierge staff was there to help. They were absolutely amazing. We felt the concierge staff by itself made the price of a room at the Mandarin Oriental worth every Euro. 
The bathroom did not have a door around the shower. Instead, water from the rain-style shower head lands on a kind of platform – which is level with the rest of the floor – but has a one- or two-inch space around it for water to drain. It worked well. Except, at one point, since a little of the shower water does make it beyond the platform, I slipped and fell on the bathroom floor. Luckily, no injuries. 
The lighting in the room was controlled by a master switch next to the bed. This was convenient but we had a little trouble understanding exactly how the lighting worked. We found this to be merely a curiosity. 
We found it easy to get a taxi out front on Passeig de Gracia and there was always a staff member to hail one for us. There is close-by subway stop, as well. The hotel is just one or two convenient blocks or so away from Gaudi’s Casa Batllo and just another few blocks to another Gaudi house, La Pedrera / Casa Milà. 
We enjoyed the Mandarin Oriental and would recommend it highly.",5,2014,08,11
44,"Great location, great customer service and the new building is a must","We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona for a short two night weekend gate away.

As with all Mandarin Oriental hotels customer service and staff are top notch. From the driver that waited for us at the airport through to the butler service in our room, everything was impeccable. 

We specifically booked a suite in the new building which has just been opened. The room is beautifully appointed with high ceiling, comfortable furniture and a dinning area, siting area, bedroom area and bathroom with walk in wardrobe. 

The room is large at 600 sq ft and with all the different area being carefully separated you really get the feel that you have a small luxury flat of your own for the weekend.

We opted to have dinner on arrival in our room (23 PM) and we also opted for two in room breakfasts. While there was plenty of choice both in the room service menus and the breakfast menu there is some room for improvement in the food quality. 

Our dinner club sandwich was called a club sandwich but was something far from it. Our cappuccino's at breakfast were of quite poor quality and overall we found dishes were tastier on paper then in reality. 

The hotel has a great spa and we were very happy with the treatments we had. The spa area itself is rather small but sufficient. The steam room needs some serious improvements as it is very large but not hot enough. 

On our last day we opted to go up for the 9th floor roof terrace and pool. We were a bit disappointed to find about this great place from the in room TV as the staff at the hotel actually didn't tell us about it when we checked in. 

Overall a great experience and if you are looking for class and quality in Barcelona then this is the place to stay
",5,2014,08,10
44,Great hotel,"This hotel won't disappoint.   Nice roof top pool, great location!   Easy walking distance to all the sites in the city.   Also close to the train if you want to head to the beach for a day trip.

The staff is amazing, they team at breakfast remembered out names by the second day.    Food is excellent as well.  ",5,2014,08,09
44,Simply the best!!!!!,"After looking around for a hotel in the center of the city we decided on The Mandarin. It was amazing!!!Especially the concierge!!! Albert!!! As well as the front end manager Miriam!!! 
So if you're looking then look no more! Mandarin is it!! 
",5,2014,08,06
44,Success is in the details and service,"This is my fourth trip to Barcelona and my travel agent urged me to change hotels and try the Mandarin Oriental and what a wonderful choice it was. From the bell staff, to the wait staff, to the desk staff, to the house keeping staff, to the staff at the pool, to the concierge staff there wasn't a thing they couldn't do and there wasn't a need that was not met. Every one of the staff seemed to know my name and attention is paid to the smallest and smartest detail. For example, throughout the day at the elevators there is a member of the staff to say hello and ask if you need anything at all. The first day we asked where the breakfast was and he didn't direct us but said, ""come with me"" and off we went. You really do feel pampered. Although every concierge we dealt with went above and beyond you have to experience Albert and Carlos. They are incredibly well connected and Carlos seems to know the entire world. They act like an old married couple and are a joy to work with. I can't begin to explain the attention to detail so I will give you one example. The second day at the hotel (we were there 5 days) I looked at the novel I was reading and realized that the house keeping staff had added a fancy Mandarin Oriental book mark to my novel as a gift. How cute is that! The room we had was huge it was the Mandarin room. It included a walk in closet/change room and double shower. No tub but that is what we prefer.Very modern looking as is the entire hotel. We did have tapas in the Bankers Bar and it was great as was the one dinner we had at the hotel. Breakfast in the morning includes not only two full cold buffets but you can order anything off the menu. Just plain excellent.",5,2014,08,05
44,Not cheap but class and friendliness all the way,"a great hotel, with beautiful dining and cocktail gardens and also the same on their rooftop open wire restaurant and lounge, and dipping pool. magical to be up there at night and see all of barcelona lit up!!",5,2014,08,02
44,"Fancy, affordable and great location","Fancy, affordable and great location overall. 

I was stunned at the quality of the accommodations given the prices. We were there in high season and it didn't break the bank. The concierge and front desk were polite, friendly and helpful and added materially to our experience of Barcelona with suggestions of out-of-the-way restaurants and tours. Even the lobby exudes taste. Definitely would (and will!) return. ",5,2014,08,01
44,"Outstanding quality, the spirit of Barcelona pervades the space","My husband and I spent a weekend at the beginning of July 2014, and we were both enthusiastic about our stay.

The hotel is beautifully decorated, Urquiola managed to reproduce the anarchic yet organic balance that one could sense in Gaudi's style. If you have an eye for interior design, you will be amazed; if not, you will simply feel the magic that reverberates from Urquiola's unique and refined taste.

Our room overlooking the Mimosa Garden was spacious, luminous and quiet. Room service was impeccable and the toiletry was good both in quality (I could avoid my regular shampoo and conditioner and still have nice hair) and assortment ( you could find anything you needed). Details that make the difference: bathrobe with inside lining, houseshoes smooth to the skin of your feet.

Staff extremely polite, helpful and resourceful. Not only were they very efficient, but they had a welcoming smile on their face.

Breakfast is excellent in quality and quantity; and the deco of the buffet area is a true treat.

I would not miss eating Japanese food at the restaurant on the roof terrace; amazing balance of taste and atmosphere.

The only minus was that you have to pay for internet connection. Locally, I did not need one, yet I find that given the hotel standards, this option should not be an extra.",5,2014,07,31
44,Luxury,"Excellent hotel, the services was fantastic and the whole ambience was chilled and luxurious ... the location was great for sight seeing , the rooms for the money they were we a little small and slightly noisy but that might have just be the position ours was in. 

Highly recommended",5,2014,07,29
44,Good location lacked a little charm,Located at the centre of designer shops. The hotel is new and clean. It's very a business hotel. The room we stayed was a bit small and lacked character. The service was good but nothing special. We called the concierge to book a few things for us and he sents a letter to our door for confirmation. It would've been more personable if he had returned a call directly to let us know.,4,2014,07,25
44,What a beautiful place!,"Loved Mandarin....absolutely beautiful property and incredible service! Must have a drink at the amazing rooftop bar and enjoy the unbeatable view. Centrally located, with shops, restaurants and everything else Barcelona has to offer, Mandarin is the most perfect hotel in town!",5,2014,07,24
44,Fantastic! Best Hotel ever!!,"Where do I start? I could write a thesis on this wonderful establishment! 
From the welcome you receive at the entrance to the minute you checkout,  you are treated like royalty. 
The location is perfect for leisure and tourism as well as for business. 
The interior design of the hotel is so beautiful and well thought out. Calming and relaxing in the rooms and vibrant and alive in the restaurants and bars. The lighting,  the audio...... everything is considered. 
The staff, Juanma from the Butler department,  Oscar from in room dining, Hernandez from the spa, just to mention a few, were exceptional!
The restaurants; Moments is a life experience, The Terrat on the rooftop is so tranquil and calm,  Blanc in the heart of the hotel is truly delightful. 
The Spa is great and offers a wide range of treatments including the famous Bastien Pedi/Mani and the massages by Hernandez are the best I've ever had!
All in all, it is an exceptionally delightful hotel that gives you an experience of a lifetime!!!",5,2014,07,22
44,Probably the best hotel in Europe,"The location is in the middle of the main shopping district which is so convenient. This location was a bank and converted to be modern and chic hotel. Unlike many chic hotels, everything works here with its well designed. Staff from the entrance to everywhere were great with anticipation of guests. We came from shopping in hot weather and staff at the entrance offered help to take our bags like any good hotel but he even offered bottle water for us. The 2nd breakfast, hostess could repeated our beverage preference without having to ask for it. Service in this hotel is beyond expectation and really wonder how they could execute this kind of standard. The roof top bar is with the view of Barcelona, a must visit if the weather is beautiful. Highly recommended for anyone who need a good standard hotel in Barcelona, this one will not disappoint you.",5,2014,07,19
44,One of the best hotels in Europe,"As with all Mandarin Oriental hotels, is one offers first quality and impeccable service, sparkling clean rooms, a great location and an pampered experience like few others can offer.  It's central location puts you in a nice part of town within easy walking distance of most of the city's best sights. We stayed here on our trip through Spain and were not disappointed.  We especially liked the roof top terrace restaurant that offered a quiet respite in an otherwise energetic and bustling world class city that never seems to pause or slow down.",5,2014,07,17
44,AMAZING TIME AT THE MANDARIN ORIENTAL BARCELONA,"Slumber party with Rhianna at the Mandarin Oriental. So we hanging out on La Rambles having an awesome time and decided to blow off the concert. Walking back to the hotel we see 1000 people crowded in front blocking the entry. Yep Rhianna staying at the hotel. Kinda funny. We did get to meet her. Super cute in person sporting a Celtics jersey and shirt skirt. Adorable. The hotel is beyond first class.  If your worried about the validity of 5 stars.....  you want have a problem here.  
The rooms are very high end an state of the art.  The service is the same impeccable. Unusually high attention to detail, every inch of this place.  Staff is amazing.",5,2014,07,13
44,Oasis of calm with a delightful roof-top terrace,"We loved this hotel. The service was first class and the terrace suite we stayed in was spacious and beautifully appointed (although in the interest of fairness, the view from the terrace wasn't that appealing as it overlooked the back of other buildings). 
One of the best things about the hotel was the roof-top terrace - great outlook, well shaded (when the wind wasn't too strong), delicious, relaxed food and delightful staff. 
The hotel is a 15-20 minute walk away from Las Ramblas. Close to the action but far enough away to provide an oasis of calm.
We would recommend this hotel. 
",4,2014,07,13
44,Top Notch Service!!!,"The service at this top-notch Barcelona hotel could not be beat. The staff was practically falling all over themselves to accommodate our every need (which were few!) The rooms are modern and very clean. They even supply a flat a flat iron in the room! The location can't be beat. Even in super crazy, crowded Barcelona, they have spaces in front in which we could park our car. My only negative, which is so minuscule that it is almost not worth mentioning, is that there is not a light above the make-up mirror in the bathroom, making it a little tough to see. Everything else here was over-the-top.",5,2014,07,10
44,Its a Mandarin Oriental!,"Met expectations. !! nice hotel, very good service, I had room service \@ 3am and was perfect.  The shower was great.   very good experience for me and my friends.   It is totally worth the experience.  No free wifi.",5,2014,07,08
44,Perfect on all accounts,"The wow effect starts walk up the entrance. Awesome architecture. The service is perfect, there's nothing the staff won't do to make your stay memorable....nothing's a problem. It's perfectly located along the Passeig de Gracia. I can't say more than it was awesome. The spa is beautiful. the roof top terrace view is impressive. One of the finest stays we've ever had. I should mention that we were upgraded to a suite in the new wing which certainly added to our stay.",5,2014,07,07
44,Above and beyond,"Our family of 4 recently stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona after a cruise. Property is ultra chic and modern. Staff extremely friendly and spoke English well. The breakfast was superb. Location of the hotel is excellent if you are a shopper like me. It is right in the middle of the street where the major luxury brands are located.
Most notably, however, is their service. The day we checked out coincided with a taxi general strike and protest. The taxis were expected to block up the city centre. Hotel management was so concerned whether guests were able to leave the city centre in order to catch their flights that they specifically arranged for free shuttle buses to run to the airport ahead of the blockade (which was scheduled to start at 6:00 am). They even made sure there was tea and coffee in the hotel lobby at 5:30 am! I have stayed at other mandarin properties but this level of service is extremely impressive.",5,2014,07,05
44,5 Star Oasis!,"Highly recommend, central location, staff friendly, helpful, terrific service.  Rooms are spacious, modern, complete blackout and silence even though on Paseo de Gracia.  An oasis from fun and energy of BCN.  Terrific breakfast, great service, totally relaxing spot to start the day. Concierge exceptionally helpful in getting tickets to sights to avoid lines and restaurant suggestions.",5,2014,07,01
44,Simply the Best - Truly 5 Star,"We've stayed at this hotel several times previously, but only for one night at a time, before boarding a cruise, so we knew it was good but hadn't fully appreciated how good!

The hotel is situated on Passeig de Gracia probably one of the most beautiful streets in the world with its Gaudi and other modernist buildings, wide pavements brimming with cafés and tapas restaurants and beautiful boutiques.

From the street it's not immediately apparent there is a hotel were it not for the doormen who are at hand to assist you.  You enter the hotel via a ramp taking you from street level to first floor level through a brightly lit modern atrium, which is breath taking even when you've seen it all before.

Staying this time for four nights, we made better use of the hotel than on previous occasions.  We arrived at the hotel after midday and as we had advised the hotel of our arrival time, our room was ready immediately and check in was done in the room itself, which was a nice touch.

We had a beautiful room on the 6th floor overlooking the garden at the rear of the property, we prefer these rooms as they provide a real level of tranquility from the bustle of the city.  The room was a good size with good storage space, a desk and seating area, a huge bed and our favourite, a fantastic appointed bathroom, with huge round bath, walk in rain shower, large vanity area and separate WC all behind sliding glass walls, which are tres chic!

Previously we had visited the hotel in the autumn and winter months so hadn't used the garden or roof terrace. The garden is a gem with comfortable tables and chairs in a beautiful shaded tranquil setting.  We had lunch and stayed hours enjoying the serenity of the place.  The roof terrace has shaded seating, great sun beds and a large plunge pool which despite its shallow level we did manage to swim in.  The views of the city are quite spectacular especially at night!

Breakfast was taken in the Blanc Brasserie which is set in an atrium at the centre of the hotel, where you could choose from an excellent buffet or extensive breakfast menu.  The staff here were truly exceptional, with first class service delivered in a very personal and friendly manner.  We also ate here one evening and enjoyed similar service and great food.   We had wanted to eat at Moments the Michelin star rated restaurant, but strangely enough the place was closed two nights of our stay, so didn't manage to eat there at all! 

Another great venue in the hotel is the Bankers Bar, serving great cocktails in a chic and quirky environment.  We've experienced it jam packed late at night on a Friday and at quitter times too. A must to try is the Bankers Martini!

One draw back to the hotel is if there is a private function, they tend to close the Blanc Brasserie to guests which is very restricting.  It is such a shame they don't have another venue which could be used for parties and weddings.

We liked the hotel after previous visits, but have now fallen head over heals with the place.  We shall definitely be back and soon!!",5,2014,06,29
44,Great Location,"The location of this hotel is perfect: right in the middle of great shopping and restaurants.  The service is exceptional and very friendly.  They remembered out names after the first night went out of their way to make us feel welcomed.  The room was a bit on the small side, but still quite comfortable:  modern and clean.  Will stay there again next year when we return but move up a room size.",5,2014,06,29
44,Superb Stay,"The hotel is superb with impeccable service. We got a complimentary upgrade to a street view suite which was absolutely amazing.  It had a very spacious bathroom with a large tub in the middle and a shower, and the bed was very comfortable. The rooftop terrace with its stunning views of the great architecture of Passeig de Gracia is an exceptional place to relax while the tranquility of the Mimosa Garden is perfect for a light lunch and a glass of wine. We will be back.",5,2014,06,24
44,Wonderful stay!!,"I have stayed at this hotel twice in the last year. 
I was amazed when a member of the staff remembered me and how I drink my coffee, it had been 8 months since my last visit! 
The property is beautiful, the location perfect, and the staff wonderful. They prepared special gluten free backed goods for me each morning. 
The rooms are very comfortable and finely appointed.
I would give this hotel a perfect score!
",5,2014,06,17
44,"Excellent hotel, but not sure it's worth the money","The service at the hotel, as with all MO properties, was flawless.  Staff could not have been more accommodating or friendly.  Everybody seemed to speak perfect English, which is unusual in Barcelona.  
Location is excellent.  
Room was a little small but extremely comfortable.  Parts of the bathroom shower area could have done with a little refurb though and the blinds didn't work exactly as they should.  
I used the rooftop terrace one day.  Service and cocktails were fantastic but I was a little disappointed in the rooftop 'pool' which is actually only about 40cm deep, so suitable only for wading, not swimming.  
Second day I used the spa which was great, good sized pool, excellent amenities in the changing rooms and super friendly staff.  
All in all I'd recommend this hotel, but I wouldn't want to stay there again solely because of the price, it really is very expensive and I have stayed in a couple of other equivalent hotels in the area for half the price.",5,2014,06,11
44,Visited the Room Top Bar!,"We only visited the roof-top bar in the evening seeing as we were not staying at the hotel.  The ambience was just right, the views were amazing, and we were served very quickly, 
My husband and I both do not drink and we requested for the waiter to provide us with a surprise mocktail.  We were presented with a 'mango drink' which was surprising but not what we expected to recieve as a mocktail!
We were presented with the bill only to find out the waiter had charged us for a full-priced cocktail.  Sonia; the manager on site was made aware and she was apologetic and attentive to realise this service was not acceptable from the hotel.  She definitely knew how to provide a great customer experience and looked after us for the rest of the evening.
This has not put us off and we will be staying at the Mandarin on our next visit as the hotel looked immaculate and modern. And above all service like Sonia provided on the day was no doubt 5 star's! :)",4,2014,06,11
44,Service Suprasses that of Hong Kong and Bangkok Mandarin Oriental,"The services at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is near flawless.  The hallmark of the Mandarin Oriental Chain is superb service: I expect to be appreciated, remembered and recognized.  This Barcelona hotel delivered everything.

The room is a bit on the smaller side, but we had a good view of the boulevard below.  Toiletries are the best and most comprehensive of any hotel: bath salt, loofah, floss, body cream, conditioner, shampoo.  Best of all is the deep soaking tub.  This boutique hotel has everything imagined: discrete elegance service, rooftop terrace, spa, swimming pool, multiple restaurants and shopping.  Staff is genuine and willing to help. What is remarkable is the anticipation and their ability to be proactive and made our stay ever more so enjoyable.  

Case in point is the food service manager, Mr. Carles Monzon, who checked our departure time and arranged breakfast to be delivered at 430 A.M. without asking.  Another high light is the concierge, Mr. Albert Perez; a true gentleman that delivers with a genuine smile.  We were recognized and greeted by name by all shortly after check in. The day always started with a good morning with newspaper and coffee, inquiries always follow upon our return from excursions and the evening always ended with a flawless turn down service.   Even the top management stopped by for conversation.

Spa and the swimming pool are excellent.  The roof top terrace is not to be missed; it has a very lovely view of the Sagrada Familia.  The breakfast spread at the Blanc restaurant is excellent; it was a treat to have Dim Sum for breakfast in Barcelona.  Uxia, especially has a very keen memory; she will have your food and drink preference memorized in no time.

We have always been very impressed by the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group, and have always used the standards of Hong Kong and Bangkok as the bench mark for comparison.  However, the service at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona surpasses both places. Our room was sparkling upon our return from breakfast, requests were never asked twice and turn down service always complete when we return for the evening.  This hotel is discrete, elegant, comfortable, safe, and we were very well looked after.

My word of advice: come to Barcelona and stay at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona; it is incredible.   We can't wait to return.",5,2014,06,08
44,Better than the best!!,"A marvelous experience. A good situated and modern hotel.
Very friendly and helpful staff, extremely well trained.
Nice rooms, nice dinner and nice breakfast .
 We come back next september and hope to do it many more times while visiting the nice town.",5,2014,06,08
44,Watched the sunset,"I didn't stay at this property but I was told by a friend to go have a drink on the rooftop and watch the sunset.  It was truly MAGNIFICENT!  Do it.  Just. Do. It. No seriously, do it. You'll thank yourself later when you get home at look at the pictures.",5,2014,06,05
44,Fabulous afternoon tea,"We had a wonderful afternoon enjoying the afternoon tea experience. Beautiful hotel, super staff and delightful little sandwiches and pastries.
We also enjoyed a smoothie and cocktail in the garden room.",5,2014,05,26
44,Pluses and minuses,"We recently stayed at the hotel and although I don't know that I would stay again there were certainly some nice pluses with this hotel.

First of all the location. It is very well located, a short walk to Las Ramblas and a 10 minute bus ride to Sagreda Familia. Lots of shops and restaurants in walking distance. About a 20.00 euro cab ride from the port and about 35.00 euros to the airport. The hop on/hop off bus service has a stop right in front of the hotel and it's a great way to get around and see Barcelona.

From the moment you arrive at the hotel the staff is wonderful- from the bellman, doorman, reception and concierge. Very welcoming and helpful and eager to ensure that you have a good stay.

Security is good- you need a room key card to operate the elevator. Nice bath amenities and linens, free wifi, as well as bottles of water at the Concierge desk to take when you leave the hotel.

The rooms are an average size. They have that black and white minimalist look (which you will either love or hate). I have to say the beds were comfortable- the pillows were as hard as rock. Order extra or softer ones from housekeeping. The room was very clean,.

I hated the bathroom. Sliding doors which didn't shut all the way and no tub- just a black glass shower. The rain showerhead was nice but there were no instructions on how to turn it on so you got soaked with cold water turning it on.

The bathroom was very dark, even with all the lights on. And no sound proofing (lol). The amenities were nice but the towels were hidden.

The television had a lot of channels but very few were in English- and they were just news networks. A pay movie was 21.00 euros. Far too expensive, even for the Mandarin.

We had breakfast in the Blanc Brasserie and Bistrobar, A bit of a misnomer because although it is located in the ""basement"" of the hotel the ceiling is incredibly high and has glass block insets that let in natural light. Not at all like a traditional brasserie. There is also a gallery from the main floor that looks down into the restaurant. It is mostly white and very light. You could order from the menu or visit the buffet, which had a nice selection. Wonderful croissants! Coffee/cappuccino could be hotter and the wait staff could be a little more attentive. There is a fabulous cream carpet in the restaurant- in desperate need of cleaning (who puts cream carpets in a restaurant?) The white leather chairs could also use a polish.

The indoor pool (lower level) and spa were very nice. There is also an outdoor terrace on the roof that serves snacks and has a lovely shallow pool that would be nice during the day.

In conclusion although the hotel is well located and the majority of the staff is great this is not at all like the elegant Asian-themed other Mandarin Hotels that I have stayed in. A bit of a disappointment.",4,2014,05,24
44,Amazing,"Stayed here with a group of 12 on a work/leisure trip for 4 days and it was incredible! Beautiful hotel, impressive rooms!!! We had a suite so had our own butler! The breakfast was to die for and also included champagne. We ate dinner in the main restaurant one evening and the service and quality of food was impeccable.
The roof top pool has some amazing views!!! It could do with being a little bigger however Barcelona is to be explored!
The spa is lovely! All staff cannot do enough for you. It is very expensive however this is a top world class hotel chain I was in paradise!
Would definitely stay here or at another mandarin chain again.",5,2014,05,23
44,FABULOUS! THE BEST HOTEL IN BARCELONA!,"Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is a WONDERFUL Hotel.
The rooms are very modern with great amenities. We were greeted by the Director of Sales and Assistant Manger and felt so special!
The staff is amazing! We have stayed at 5 star hotels all over the world- and I would have to stay that the staff here was the best we have ever encountered. Every staff member was always smiling and had great attitudes and were very informative with our requests or questions. They couldn't do enough for you- always going the extra mile.
The hotel is located on a beautiful street and in a great location. Our rate included breakfast and the breakfast was FABULOUS! A huge selection and of very high quality. We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant and it was excellent.
If you are going to Barcelona then this is the only hotel to stay at- if you want a 5 star experience with great service- then this is the hotel for you!
Thank you to all the staff for making our stay so wonderful!!",5,2014,05,17
44,"snooty, pretentious and poor value","I love the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong - it is absolutely my favorite place and I am a regular there.This Barcelona version - well, where do i start.Too cool for school, insincere and inattentive staff, poky room, slightly frayed fittings...but more importantly, only got into the room at 3.40, which when you consider how places like this harass you out at 11 in the morning is pretty awful.Waited in the restaurant/lounge for 15 minutes before someone deigned to take my order, which of course they made me paid for (a well run place would have waived the bill since I was waiting for a room) .Of course, I could have gone out of the hotel while waiting but Barcelona is notorious for thieves -and carrying my worldly possessions around with me (I certainly wouldn't leave money etc with the staff here)  would have been too dangerous.It is a shame that the Mandarin brand has been diluted and spoiled  by this sub standard temple to the gods of vacuousness and blandness.",2,2014,05,10
44,Great,"I've stayed here a few times. Love the decor and feel of the hotel. The pool and spa are great. The location is good, loads of eateries and shopping right out the front. The staff are always very helpful.",5,2014,05,10
44,Five Stars Plus,"Central Barcelona location. Impeccable service. The modern bedroom fixtures and fittings were the most beautifully crafted that I have ever encountered. Even the fridge cabinet opened and closed immaculately. Food very good, maybe tried just a bit too hard, but dim sun for breakfast went down very well. The hotel limos included the very latest Mercedes S Class hybrid.",5,2014,05,01
44,In love...,"Truly in love with this hotel... and the experience.  

Outstanding service: we arrived late, and understandably the kitchen was closed, but the waitress managed to make us something small, instead of just letting us know that the kitchen is closed.  Very appreciated... thank you! 

Drinks at the bar - thank you, Rafael - AMAZING - best Mojito's we've ever had... anywhere! #TALENT 

Absolutely will return to this hotel... in love with this hotel.",5,2014,04,30
44,Completely overpriced,"We stayed three nights at this hotel, and, as many before said, this design hotel where form dominates widely over function. I'll leave out the details as they have been mentioned before. But the location is obviously great and the staff was very friendly and forthcoming. The main impression though is that the room we stayed in (a standard double) was WAYS too small and WAYS overpriced. The same hold for the breakfast as well as the bar. The pool on the top floor was closed although the weather was balmy.",3,2014,04,24
44,"Great Place, but a few tweaks needed","Stayed here for 2 nights while on a family vacation with our adult kids. The hotel is a very cool renovation of an old bank and is located perfectly on the Passeig de Gracia (read that shopping and heart of a lively city).

Let me start with the numerous positives: the staff is focused, welcoming, pleasant, and genuine. A very special call out to Marta the concierge, she helped us with some very tricky circumstances and did so quite professionally and pleasantly. Maria and Marika of the front desk are also worthy of thanking. Our room ( a junior suite on floor 3) was large but not spacious. It came with ""Butler Service"" which is an interesting touch. Very contemporary bathrooms that you should find enjoyable with great amenities and towels. The elevators are very good -- fast and nice. The roof top terrace provides a great view of Barcelona and has an attractive dipping pool. It is pricey but if you are willing to sign up for this you get high touch service.

Now for things that need to be tweaked (improved upon) -- for a hotel of this stature the Fitness Center needs to be better. It is too small and has very limited weights. The aerobic machines are high quality TechnoGym and there is an ""advanced"" singular universal machine that only uses resistance bands -- very hard to use. The Spa is nice and the people are welcoming but the relaxation facility is too small and it can get to a situation where there are not enough lounges. Lastly, breakfast was not included in our room and it should be given the price of your stay. 

Net net: This is a very fine and expensive hotel. It has many advantages but a few things that hold it back from being a exceptional experience.",5,2014,04,20
44,It is simply the best ,"Our holiday was great , and what made it the best is the Mandarin Oriental , everyone was wonderful and pleasant , the rooms are excellent , the food was amazing , room service is excellent , housekeeping were excellent, it was very safe and comfortable , from the minute we checked in till we checked out , every minute was enjoyable , can't wait to go back again , many thanks to all the staff there from the doormen to the GM, thank you for making our holiday great and worth it , and the most important was the pleasant attitude from everyone. Highly recommended.",5,2014,04,17
44,Fantastic Cocktails,"We didn't stay in the hotel but popped in on Saturday afternoon for some cocktails to The Bankers Bar.
The barman was very knowledgable about cocktails and started us off with the Banker's Martini.  It was a great choice, we all enjoyed it.  
We picked a couple more from the menu which were equally as good and the barman then asked us to leave the next round in his hands as opposed to choosing from the menu.  We told him our likes & dislikes and he came back with four fantastic cocktails which felt special as he had obviously understood our tastes.
Well worth a visit when in Barcelona.",5,2014,03,31
44,beautiful barcelona,"we had a suite which was lovely. beautiful room and finishings, very peaceful and romantic.  i absolutely adored the hotel, i particularly enjoyed the delicious cocktails and barcelona has to be the best place in europe.  i would go back at any time i love the gaudi architecture",5,2014,03,28
44,Wow hotel like usual with Mandarin Oriental,The wow effect starts when walk the entrance. Awesome architecture. The service is perfect. It's perfectly located along the Passeig de Gracia. I can't say more than it was awesome. Restaurant is so good with a 2 stars chef. The spa is beautiful. the terrasse is impressive on the roof. Stop talking come and try it.,5,2014,03,26
44,Excellent City Hotel,"We had a very pleasant two day stay with great service. One feels very welcome in this boutique style City Hotel. It's like an oasis in lively Barcelona, especially the spa. The spa has excellent staff and can really be recommended. The rooms are very nice and the beds very comfortable. the restaurants are also very good and the service is very friendly. I would come back any time.",5,2014,03,23
44,The experience at Mandarin Barcelona was a very enjoyable one.,"I have stayed in Barcelona at Mandarin hotel for three nights and the oveall rating is very good,. Special concideration for the attention from the personal.
I would stay again in another opportunity.",5,2014,03,19
44,"Great staff, poor room design","The staff were helpful and pleasant. Check in was in the room, which is always nice. Later, Francisco the concierge took the trouble to make an inquiry about trains for me.

But I didn't like the bathroom. A huge amount of space was taken up by a coffin-like bathtub that I suspect most people don't use, while the shower had no enclosure, exposing you to cold drafts while showering. This is another case of a European hotel designed by someone who has never traveled outside Europe.

The floors were wood (bathroom floor was some kind of plastic), so when the guest above you walks around in heels, you hear every footstep.

Upon arriving, I gave an instruction that I didn't want any maid service during my 4 day stay. They respected this for one day. Then they couldn't resist entering the room and rearranging all my things. The maid even rummaged in my bag, moving items around, and taking some items out of the bag. If I need a valet, I'll hire one. Hotel staff shouldn't inspect bags and move guest belongings.",2,2014,03,17
44,Friendly staf ,"As a non guest we reciewed help from the concierge without any questions - and we didn't have to pay anything for their service!! 
They made us feel at home and we are sad that we did not stay there this time! The hotel was beutifull and stylish, a sight for swore eyes!",5,2014,03,16
44,Asian service in West Europe,"I staid for 5 nights in the hotel. Very nice rooms and excellent food. 

The staff is Asian level friendly and everything is spot on. Though the service level can be a bit overwhelming if you are not use to it, you do not get the feeling of them being too pushy.

Located in the centre of Barcelona and easy walk to the shops and clubbing.",4,2014,03,11
44,"Fantastic service, location and beds; terrific value","The service is outstanding.  One is called by name by just about every staff member.  The hotel has only 98 rooms giving the hotel an intimate feeling.  The concierge service is always accommodating and friendly.  The breakfast is amazing.  The same hotel in New York, Parisor London would be double the price",5,2014,03,11
44,"Stunning Hotel, Stunning Service... Enjoy your stay","I visited the hotel with a group of friends and we were a little loud at times, however when in public areas we were looked after, but also mindful of the other guests.  I have a lot of respect for that and the service we received was impeccable.

The food was fantastic, the bar is excellent.... 

The rooms are very well laid out and a lot of though has gone into the room to make sure your stay is comfortable and enjoyable.

I fully recommend this hotel to anyone...",5,2014,03,06
44,Best service ever,What an amazing place. I have stayed in quiet some hotels but have never experienced this level of service. Absolutely everything is well thought of. A lot of hotels could learn from this place. The room was beautiful with very special amenities. Nice bar and good food in the lobby. We enjoyed it so much that we booked an extra night. The concierge was extremely helpful.,5,2014,03,03
44,BEAUTIFUL HOTEL IN THE MIDST OF EVERYTHING,"Mandarin Oriental Hotels are generally very nice, but this one is an exception.  Built inside an old bank building, my favorite place in this hotel was the bar where the walls are lined with old safe deposit boxes. Even on the ceiling!
Rooms are very nice, though somewhat small.  I recommend a Jr. Suite if you want some space.
The range of room amenities is spectacular.  They have a little box in every room with all kinds of electronic hookups and cords.  So if you forget a plug adaptor or a phone jack or whatever...just check out the little box.
Baths are pretty amazing as well.  The Jr. Suites have ""tea cup"" bathtubs which are very cute, but somewhat of a pain to bath in (if you like baths).  I guess they are going for the oriental touch with the Japanese style of soaking tubs, but it didn't work for me.
The gym here as well as the two pools are great.  There is an indoor pool in the basement and then there is the spectacular rooftop pool that would be super in warmer months.
I really liked this hotel a lot, and would highly recommend it.  Be careful not to wander too close to the Jimmy Choo Shoe store just off the Lobby....it can pull you right in if you are a shoe fanatic like me.",5,2014,02,22
44,"Perfect location, inadequate butler service","This hotel has some of the most desired features for a perfect vacation - a convenient tourist location, great views from the upper level suites and from the roof top terrace and a really helpful concierge service. Our butler showed up at the welcome and totally vanished for the rest of the stay. Impeccable housekeeping.",5,2014,02,09
44,Perfectly Placed.,A wonderful hotel right in the heart of Barcelona within walking distance of Las Ramblas and lots or shopping and sight-seeing.  Staff were very friendly and helpful and we loved the safe deposit boxes on the roof of the Bankers Bar! - the roof top pool and bar a great place to have drinks before dinner or a light sushi lunch. We did have a really small room but it was fine as we didn't spend much time there.  Great gym and gorgeous lotions and potions in the bathroom! -,4,2014,02,07
44,first visit to Barcelona and to stay at this hotel,"beautiful hotel and great location. concierge have exceptional service while my wife and i spent 4 days there. the medium built concierge about 1.6 m tall with slight baldish top was very very good in helping me with every single day. he helped us with breakfast and dinner recommendations and arranging tours which he said we should go. he booked everything for us. mind you, the first concierge person i met who had even a jacket promised me to arrange for me and FAILED to even mention to his colleagues and this second gentleman then displayed his excellent service to us.the reception was pleasant too when we arrived. we want to mention that the lounge below the reception and excellent service and the tall manager was very good in service as well as his staff too. all of the food was good. . the other Italian food was very good too. Excellent service still rings in my ears at the lounge. the next area of excellent service was the door men. they always provided the smile which i looked forward to when we return to the hotel. they were very very helpful to us. one little small matter which i don't understand. this is an excellent hotel and a high class one too. but they want to charge for WiFi usage in the room. i find this ridiculous for a hotel which commands an exceptional reputation doing a disfavor to their guests. all the other smaller hotels are providing it free and these days WiFi is so common to have and provide and the cost is a small fraction of running a hotel. why this absurd rule ???",4,2014,02,03
44,I would live the rest of my life there,The hotel is fantastically located where all the great shopping is. It is surrounded by great cafés and restaurants. There is a tour bus stop just outside the hotel that you can hope on/off and see the town  the restaurants in the hotel are great and a fantastic bar,5,2014,01,28
44,One of his kind,Stayed here last week and what a place very regular of mandarin oriental. First time in Barcelona. Design and luxury. Service level is outstanding just behind Tokyo where after 3 years I am still impressed by the little concierge.  Room are well appointed nice bath tub touch. Restaurant amazing food. Great location. Recommend,5,2014,01,13
44,Good Service,"This hotel is very well located with great service. It is within walking distance of many attractions and shops and is also close to the metro line. The staff greeted us by name each day and were willing to assist with anything, including bookings and recommendations for fantastic restaurants and flamenco dancing as well as guided tours. 
The rooms are large, clean, well appointed and very modern, however they lacked a certain Spanish flair. 
The bar area is fantastic and serves wonderful cocktails and coffees and the views from the rooftop are really magical.
My only disappointment with this hotel was the food. The breakfast was very average as was a dinner experience we had on Christmas eve.",4,2014,01,13
44,Pure bliss!,From start to end the mandarin oriental did not disappoint. The service was exceptional and cannot be faulted. Our room was beautiful and very tastefully designed. The breakfasts were my favorite part of the day! Moments restaurant was also a wonderful gastronomic experience. The location is a 10. We had a magical week in Barcelona which was magnified by the pleasure of returning back to the mandarin oriental every day. What a pleasure!,5,2014,01,08
44,Really Excellent Hotel,"What a superb and quaintly original and unique hotel! From the classy and unique yet stunning decorations throughout hotel and the rooms to the restaurants, one can feel the immaculate and ornate details which goes to show that no details is too small reflecting the truly luxurious embodiment of the Mandarin Oriental brand. We were greeted with such aplomb by the Front Office Manager, Miriam and her team. The Concierge team really shared the local knowledge and helped us to plan our itinerary resulting in us having a most wonderful experience and stay in Barcelona. Special thanks to Sebastian for listening to our needs and his recommendations really enhanced our tour sightseeing. One must not forget to try the spa which is out of this world and is a gem after the many hours discovering the wonders of Barcelona which is plenty. The hotel's location is so central and so convenient and in one of the best location in the city center.

44,Oasis of Asian service standards in crisis-ridden Europe,"This is a great property, worth dropping in for a drink or meal if not staying. It manages to be a proper Mandarin Oriental, which some other locations struggle with. Barcelona is a fitting location as well, very refreshing.",5,2014,01,07
44,Utter gem,"You couldn't ask for a more wonderful venue.  The service is perfect, the room is excellent, but most appealing is the location, which is right in the middle of the most  vibrant and beautiful avenue in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.",5,2014,01,01
44,Not a blah spa,"We stayed in a rental apartment not far from the hotel, and I booked myself into the spa for a quick massage - 50 minutes of heaven. My masseur Victor spoke perfect English, and at my prompting, was funny but focused on the task. I'm tempted to go back tomorrow. Very professional, friendly service, very reasonable and pretty place. Treatment rooms are small, but who cares when it's candle-lit, smells like heaven and you're in total relax mode?!",5,2013,12,31
44,Great address for everything in City,"This hotel is a wonderful haven from the busy streets of Barcelona. The service is exceptional, friendly and extremely efficient. Rooms are very comfortable and modern. If bit on small side.Garden rooms more expensive and small, and not worth the extra price as view is not exceptional. Better off with a boulevard facing room, larger without balcony. Balcony not worth it in winter.great breakfast included in price sets you up for day.. Lovely informal, relaxed elegant bar for evenings and late afternoon tea.",5,2013,12,31
44,Incredible as Expected,"This hotel lived up to all my expectation as a Mandarin Oriental hotel.
Not only is the hotel itself exceptional and the location unmatched, the service is a level other hotels can only aspire to achieve.
Nothing is an effort for Mandarin Oriental staff and the personalised service is just amazing down to the tiniest details of the doorman remembering each guest by name.
If the budget can stretch so far, the suites are amazing and the butler service to be experienced.
A special thanks to Hendrik and Carlos for making our stay so enjoyable.
Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,12,23
44,"Not bad, good location but very small room...",The hotel is located in a very nice shopping area and the staff tried hard to provide a friendly service.  Maybe it was not a busy season but generally the hotel responded to all our requests promptly.  The room was very modern and some part of the room was very dark in the night and was not functional (e.g. Inside the closet and section around the safety box was extremely dark even during the day time).  The room was small hence not suitable for a long term stay. ,4,2013,12,11
44,Incredible experience,"Thank you for a truly amazing stay, the rooms and facility's are first class but the personal touches make it memorable even the door remembered my name! You will defiantly see me and my friends /family again. Regards Sean Renton",5,2013,12,06
44,Not your typical Mandarin Oriental,"The location is great and the design clean but the shower was so small I could barely turn around in it.  The staff were friendly and the quality is good but not exceptional as one expects from this Hotel Group.  At the price I was charged, free internet hotel wide should be standard.  Hotel Olivia Plaza is comparable in design, room size, and location at one third the price.",3,2013,11,29
44,Beautiful and Elegant,"We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona before and after our cruise and loved every minute.  It is right in the heart of the city and very easy to get around as the bus and subway lines are within a short walk.  We had a balcony room that looked out on the famous street so we could watch the world go by and close the door for a quiet sleep at night.  Their room top bar is also elegant and fun to stop after a busy day of sightseeing.  Worth the extra dollars.

44,Stay away,"If you have ever stayed at a Mandarin Oriental hotel before, or if you know what a 5-star hotel should be like in general, do not expect this same level of quality and class here. The rooms are small, with poor quality of finishings and furniture. Even our bathroom door did not close fully. There was construction next door along with a high school and kids screaming non stop. The food at the restaurant was OK at best. The hotel umbrellas were cheap and small. There was trash laying around hotel common areas and the public bathrooms were quite dirty. There is a sense that the hotel management is trying to save money and cut corners on absolutely everything. They don't even put real flowers in the dinning room! When was the last time you saw fake flowers in the main dinning room of a 5-star hotel?

While the staff does listen politely to complaints, they do not do anything to make it any better. Moreover, I was initially promised an upgrade to a suite. I did not get it because when I arrived it turned out the suite was flooded the night before due to rain. The fact that the hotel leaks when it rains does not inspire confidence in the quality of the hotel. However, I do understand that sometimes a promised upgrade cannot be provided. In such a case, a real 5-star hotel shows the courtesy of providing the lower-class room at a discount, to compensate for the inconvenience. This was not offered.

The only thing that is 5 star about this property is the price. Everything else is very, very poor. It is a mystery to me how the Mandarin group allows this hotel to tarnish the brand so badly.",1,2013,11,24
44,Excellent hotel with first class service,"This is the first tme we have stayed at a Mandarin Oriental hotel and we were really impressed with the hotel itself but more importantly, with the welcome we received and the outstanding service from the moment we checked in to the moment we left. We had absolutely awful weather in Barcelona and the hotel actually rescued the trip for us - it is a very modern hotel with excellent amenities, a beautiful spa and fitness area and great bar and restaurant facilities. Our deluxe room was modern and well appointed, comfortable and quiet. Every member of staff we encountered during our stay was friendly, welcoming, helpful and professional. The only negative I have about this hotel is having to pay for wifi access - I really don't think it's acceptable to charge for this in a five star hotel given the already premium rates.",5,2013,11,22
44,NEVER AGAIN!,"This is the first and last time I have stayed at a Mandarin Oriental Hotel.  Don't let the website fool you, the bedrooms are absolutely tiny and they think they are doing you a favour.  Instead of trying to sort it out, they told us we could upgrade but we would have to pay extra.  Eventually we came to a mutual agreement, and were shown an alternative room.  Although it was bigger it had delightful view over the local noisy basketball court and they had building works going on right under our window, so forget the alarm clock they builders will wake you up very early!! Oh and don't ask them to sort out transfer unless you have more money than sense 170 Euros just to take us to the harbour which is a ten minute drive - more fool us!  To be fair the rest of the hotel is okay, the breaksfast was perfectly pleasant and the staff were very helpful.  Would I stay again - absolutely not!!",1,2013,11,19
44,Outstanding hotel in great location,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is fantastic. Staff was fabulous especially the concierge. I would highly recommend this hotel. The location of the hotel is also great making it easy to walk the city and to major attractions.,5,2013,11,15
44,Sheer Opulence,"Fantastic service and the perfect location to explore Barcelona.
Although expensive bedrooms there are really great value restaurants on your door step in the surrounding area.
Ask for a room over-looking front so you can spectate the hustle and bustle of this vibrant city.
Concierge incredibly helpful and charming.",5,2013,11,11
44,A really great hotel,"We just returned from a month in Europe and thankfully this is the hotel we chose in Barcelona. 
It was a prefect stay--from the moment we walked up to the checkout and were greeted by Jaume, who took amazing care of us to til we said good by to all the amazing waitstaff Jose Miguel, Raquel and all of the other staff at Blanc, we had an amazing stay.   Johan at Terrat was also really great as were the staff at the Spa!  
If you want a perfect location and a staff that's probably one of the best around, chose the Mandarin Oriental!",5,2013,11,09
44,Wonderful Afternoon Tea at The Mandarin Oriental,"Fantastic afternoon tea; excellent service, eat as much as you want afternoon tea Catalan style and fantastic value for only 18e each. Sandwiches, glass shots with chocolate, so many lovely pastries and cakes. And the most amazing specialist tea selection, simply delicious. We went here prior to the evening tour of La Padera (also worth doing). And had just enough time to wonder and browse all those lovely designer shops and walk off some of those lovely cakes prior to our tour.",5,2013,11,09
44,Mandarin Oriental Spa - Oasis in the city,"This is a review specifically for Mandarin Oriental Spa.
I had a signature massage one of Sunday late afternoons.
As you could expect from its reputation, from the beginning to the end was almost perfect.
The treatment was the best - I went around so many Spas to try out different treatments but this time was by far the best. I am pretty sure that I had the best therapist in the Spa :) If I go back there, I would ask the same therapist.
In addition to the treatment, I also enjoyed a short swimming & steam sauna time before the treatment. It was almost like a little oasis in the busy Barcelona city centre as I could use the entire space just by myself.
(It could be nice if the spa treatment space has an ""exit"" sign... I could not find my way out after the treatment... :) )",4,2013,11,07
44,OUTSTANDING!!!!!,"From the moment we arrived we experienced superior service combined with very professional friendliness. The front desk and concierge did an outstanding job of orienting us to the hotel, city and how best to see it.  Their recommendations and follow-up were second to none.  Don't miss the roof top bar for an evening drink.  The city views at night are spectacular!!!",5,2013,11,05
44,Little gem,"One of the newer 5 star hotels in Barcelona.
Rooms are on the small side and hardly any view. The so called balcony is tiny and it would be a tight fit to have breakfast there.
The service is good but when you check in after 3pm your room is not ready and you have had a long flight, patience can were thin. The alternative is upgrade or wait. This happened twice in the same trip. Also happened to my friend. Is this a ploy to get you to upgrade?",4,2013,11,04
44,Terrific staff and location,"My husband and I stayed at The Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona the second week of October, 2013.   As others have noted the rooms while spotless are layed out in such a way that their function does not accomplish the restful stay one hoped for; the lighting is so low as to be dangerous, especially in the bathroom--the shower, no matter how careful you are , makes the floor area wet, and slippery!  To be charged for wi-fi when you are spending almost $600 per night for your room left a very bad impression on us--and finally after the first evening was provided gratis.

To enter the hotel one must walk up a steep incline!!!!  There is NO ELEVATOR OR ESCALATOR to assist you---as I am disabled ( I walk with the aid of a cane) this was very stressful---had any review ever mentioned this fact, we would have stayed elsewhere.  There is a very limited area to sit in the "" lobby "" and the seats are so low to the floor that getting up from them is very difficult---and for people who are NOT disabled!!

The pool on the 9th floor was relaxing with beautiful views of the city--and luckily still opened in October as the weather was still very pleasant.

The staff was very accommodating and the buffet breakfast was plentiful with many choices from which to choose---and presented beautifully.

I had not stayed at a Mandarin Oriental Hotel before and coming from a week at The Ritz in Madrid, there is NO hotel that can reach that level of elegance but I certainly expected our room to be more comfortable and lighted better.   While we would not choose this hotel again, for others it may be a good selection.  The location is very central and the hop on/hop off bus is in front of the hotel which is very convenient..

I again want to praise the staff who are all very well informed about places to visit, restaurants to choose, and always with a smile and a welcome to the guests that include your name.

",4,2013,11,03
44,One of the Nicest in Barcelona,"If not for the views, the food, the pool, the service and the great design, this place would be nothing.

Stayed for 5 days with my wife and Mother-in-Law while I was in town on a business function. We stayed in the Terrace suite and an adjoining Terrace room. The suite is very nicely laid out and I appreciated it having a separate study area for my work while there. The furnishings are very good quality as you would expect from the MO hotels with superb housekeeping and all the little extras anyone could want or need. The terrace at night overlooking the Boulevard was a nice place to sit and unwind before heading out for dinner. 

My special thanks go out to the hotel concierge and crew my bag was lost on arrival and having an important conference to attend the next day they arranged for the Brioni store to stay open a little late so I could pick up some shirts and ties and a suit .. my wife always laughs cause I am 6'1"" and 190 pounds so I am quite easy to fit of the rack she never believes i can get the same shopping done in 30 minutes which takes her almost a full day. 

The hotel’s famous “tea time” every day at 4pm i something you should try while there too, which offers an assortment of high quality teas and cakes and is a real treat. 

Many questioned why would we stay in an Asian influenced hotel while in Barcelona but as others have mentioned it is unlike any other MO property I have stayed in. They really seemed to keep to and want to convey the feel and influence of the city with this property overall I think they accomplished it quite well.

The building itself used to be a bank and you can still see traces of it throughout the premises. Definitely one of the nicest hotels in Barcelona, this luxury five star accommodation will offer you a comfortable stay and top-notch service. There is really little to say negatively about this hotel; the interior design is tasteful and the rooftop pool overlooking Passeig de Gracia, is definitely a treat. 

Bottom line I highly recommend it for your stay in in Barcelona",4,2013,10,31
44,"""garden view"" room ?","The Mandarin Oriental is supposed to be a 5 star hotel. On the surface it appears to be. Public areas and restaurants are beautiful. But don't EVER book a garden view room. There is a small garden on the back of the hotel but that is not your view when you are on floors 2 and above. The view is of an empty hot tub, the back of what looked like tenement housing and a schoolyard with basketball court and  graffiti filled walls.   Customer service was also terrible!!! We were given one room that faced the street initially. The desk called us to say that that was not our room and we were forced to move to the room afforementioned. There was no consideration of our displeasure and apparently ALL rooms were booked(and we know that that isn't true). The garden view room cost 440 euros. We were very unhappy.",2,2013,10,29
44,Exceptional service during corporate meeting,"I recently stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for 4 nights to attend a corporate meeting and I have to say that thanks to the exceptional service the meeting was a great success. When I first walked into the hotel I thought it was a bit small and I was expecting something more luxurious (same with the room) but I soon realised that real luxury was the service and the details. The food at the Blanc restaurant was delicious, the hotel staff knew my name and all my preferences (for coffee, food, etc) after only 1 day!. Small details like the smell of the hotel, all the room amenities and the rainforest shower are things that you do not find in other hotels. The hotel has a sense of calm and oriental service which I have only found in Asia. The personnel were really nice and always trying to help and made you feel really welcomed and special. I had a great experience and if I had the opportunity I would choose it again for a meeting.",5,2013,10,29
44,Lovely Hotel in the Center of Barcelona,"We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for 5 nights before going on a cruise and found it an excellent hotel with attentive service.   We stayed in a suite that had a separate living and bedroom area.  The marble bath was beautiful, although the rain shower was a bit daunting and the floor outside the shower always got wet.  We had a beautiful private terrace, large closets and well stocked bar.  The butler service was superb.   Furnishings and decor are very modern and sleek--white and mirrors.   I did not like the hallway fragrance that so many hotels are using but fortunately it did not go into the rooms.   We loved the Terrat--great rooftop bar.  They had a lovely spa and services.   I would have rated the hotel excellent except for the hall fragrance and I thought the restaurants were very good, not great.   Service was excellent.",4,2013,10,29
44,New and chic but still green,"Visit Barcelona on my trip to Europe and decided to try the new Mandarin Oriental. Some friends told me not to visit an asian branded hotel in Spain but, I must admit it is beautifully done. Rooms are comfortable, it´s well located but service is still not there. Arrival was sloppy, upgrade not granted and room not ready upon arrival. I waited and waited and had to check myself several times. Service for breakfast was good even though you had to chase waiters to have your cup refilled. Nice hotel but value for money is still not up to par.",4,2013,10,28
44,"Good, Not Great","There is no point in choosing a Mandarin as a value proposition in business terms. As their expensive ""she's a fan"" advertising campaign (which you pay for in your room rate) indicates, Mandarin is all about fashion, celebrity and cool. 

But cool, as Apple shows, can be superior in functionality as well as design. Here the Mandarin fails. At first blush, your bedroom looks sleek, modern fixtures, earth tones. But the room was not prototyped; the designer did not sleep there. 

As reviewers have stated, the shower stall can overflow, the sink is too shallow, lighting is too low, the desk chair is hopelessly uncomfortable, it's hard to find the window shade controls, the bath towels aren't plush enough, you have to call housekeeping for an adaptor. In addition, to be charged for wifi on top of the very high room rate is rubbing it in.....but if that worries you, you probably shouldn't be staying here.

All that said, the room design and fixtures are very attractive and have the Zen-like feel you expect from a Mandarin. Sound insulation is also good. But if you want to be comfortable and not cramped, you must book a Deluxe rather than a Standard room.

Service is very responsive and friendly, more than sufficient to compensate for the occasional oversight. Like the staff, the public areas are warm and welcoming and not wasteful of space. The open rooftop terrace is a valuable bonus, a good place to relax on a fine day.

",4,2013,10,27
44,Form Over Function,"Although the staff was very friendly and helpful, this hotel was a big disappointment to me as a business traveler.  The room was very cramped - virtually no space to maneuver around the bed, a weird wall that separated the bed from a tiny desk (more on this later), and one (!) very narrow drawer inside the closet for clothes.  At least 25% of the room space was taken up by a huge round bathtub next to the shower area that could have been used for a more functional working area, perhaps a small table, and a decent set of drawers.
    It was very hot the week I was there and the air conditioning did not work properly and it took several calls before someone who knew what they were doing could get it working.  
    The lighting in the room was also terrible, especially in the bathroom.   It was similar to the dimmed lighting in a restaurant late at night.  I had to keep walking out of the bathroom and over to the window to put on my makeup but even that didn't work since many mornings I had to be out the door before the sun was out.  I honestly thought there was a problem - that there must be some dimmer switch I could not find - but the staff assured me that the low lighting was intentional.
     There was plenty of hot water in the big shower area but it was in a large open space and it flooder the entire area.
     Working in the room was really uncomfortable - as noted above, the desk was not very practical or functional.  It was crammed with all kinds of apparatus and magazines, and was very very narrow so that my PC was hanging off the edge as I worked.  In order to plug my power adapter into the wall, I had to pull the desk out into the room since the high back of the desk (form over function again) was a problem.  And of course one of the outlets didn't work so I had to unplug the phone in order to use my PC.
     Bottom line: although the location is great and staff is nice, I won't stay here again and definitely would not recommend as a place for business travelers. No real space in the lobby to have a quick conversation with colleagues, no bottle opener in the room despite the fact that the water bottle (one) they leave for you any many in the mini bar are not twist off, overly perfumed lobby and hallways (headache inducing)...not good!",2,2013,10,19
44,A discredit to the Mandarin Oriental name,"My wife and I spent two nights at this overpriced hotel before a cruise from Barcelona.  At roughly, $700.00 per night, we expected something special. Instead, we got a smallish Holiday Inn type room not ready until 5:00 pm with a stubborn light that would mysteriously go on during the middle of the night. The hotel staff tried to fix it on the first night but it still malfunctioned.

At this price level, you expect perfection.  Even without the malfunctioning light fixture, the hotel was a disappointment!",1,2013,10,18
44,customer service is number 1,"Modern hotel in a great location.  Staff couldn't be friendlier or more helpful.  The room was tiny but clean and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom, though cool looking, lacked privacy and the shower tile was very slippery.  The rooftop space was a wonderful bonus, affording beautiful views of the city.",4,2013,10,14
44,If I could put one more 'dot' I would!,"I could make a list of BEST... Best Location, Best staff, Best breakfast... Very nice Spa, Very nice rooms, very nice bathroom. Great terrace on top 'Terrat', Great bar.... what else can I say?! Obviously by paying for an expensive hotel you would expect all of these... but since this hotel is small - comparing to the big luxury hotel in Barcelona, you are treated like a guest. they all try to remember your name and they all try to make you feel special.",5,2013,10,14
44,"nice to look at, but stay somewhere comfortable!","It amazes me to read the gushing, thrilled reviews! Yes, it is better then Holiday INN...sort of. The problem is that the design was meant for viewing, not for guests. There are no comfortable chairs anywhere...literally none! The bathroom is glass enclosed...try to use it at night without distrubing your fellow guest!
The shower is open, such that it is impossible not to flood the bathroom floor upon use. The sink is about 4 inches deep, ensuring floods there. Instead of centering the sink to allow articles to be placed on either side of it, it is on the far end of the counter.
The $50pp breakfast (yep!!) arrive improperly cooked/cold all 3 days of our stay. Some of the buffet food looked like it had sat there for days....
The vaunted Bankers Bar is pretty....but don't try to sit there comfortably. The special $20 Bankers martini was more citrus juice than alcohol.
The hotel tap water is so foul tasting you should avoid it like the plague (they say it is safe!). But, for your ultra expensive room, they leave you 2 bottles of 6 ounce water....not very generous. 

Our room was finally made up at 4 pm after a call to the front desk.
 So....what makes you feel like a princess?? What about this is wonderful???? Read The Emperor's New Clothes to find out........",1,2013,10,11
44,Best hotel in Barcelona,"Centrally located, this hotel with 98 rooms occupies an elegant mid-twentieth century building with a strikingly contemporary interior.  The service, staff and restaurants are excellent.  The restaurants include Moments with two Michelin stars.  Concierge service is first rate.  We enjoyed a sushi/wine bar, Terrat, located on the roof of the hotel with panoramic vies of Barcelona.  Some of the rooms are small so check out the suites.  A new all-suite addition to the hotel is currently under construction.",5,2013,10,10
44,Style over function,"The Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona is a high styled hotel.  The staff is excellent and very
helpful.  When you stay at an expensive luxury hotel, comfort, cleanliness and service
are top priorities.  This hotel excels at service and cleanliness but lacks comfort.
 
The design of the hotel projects sleek modern. Style trumps function and comfort. It's not
user friendly.
The lighting system is difficult to use. In our stay of 3 nights, we
 never figured out how to avoid having all the lights on or off at the same time.
The automatic shades in the bedroom and sitting area both either go down together or up together.
The rod in the closet is set very high with heavy wooden hangers. If you're not tall, it's very difficult to reach.  There's a second small bathroom located in the
entrance to the junior suite.  It's a major effort to open the door.  A handle would help.

   The hotel's modern
decor (bar, lobby and rooms) includes all low furniture.  The couch in the room is neither attractive
or comfortable.  We took turns sitting on the desk chair for back support. I would suggest that
some hooks and a hamper for used towels be added to the bathroom. While the room lacked comfort,  cleanliness is excellent.

We were disappointed in the hotel brasserie, Blanc.",3,2013,10,10
44,"Great location, great bathroom","Location was great for walking to all sites. Our room was ready when we checked in at 11 am. As others have said room was ""not Mandarin like"" compared to others that we have stayed at. Room was so modern that there was absolutely no charm to the room.  It was fine for a 2 night stay but I would have been very dissatisfied with the space and storage if we were staying for any longer. However, bathroom was exceptional as was the bedding.  Concierge service was extremely helpful. Also, we checked out in the morning but we were able to use the SPA early evening to shower and get ready before we left Barcelona.",4,2013,10,09

44,Awesome service!,"Pro
- Impossibly perfect service, starting the moment our lazy cabbie didn't want to drive up the door in fear of having to double-park

- On-time room service at 4:30 am (we had a 6:00am flight)
- Everyone's impeccable English

- Wake-up call was 10 minutes late
- Great wifi, but they charge for it... too nickel & dimey for our taste
- No electric outlets by the night stand (Dan thinks they would have messed up the painfully cool decor!)",5,2013,10,05
44,Mandarin at its best,"This hotel is one of my favorites. I now have stayed 2 times here and both were just great.
The location is good in the city center and not as far as the other 5* hotels in town. Within a few minutes you can reach by foot the attractions of Barcelona.

The entrance to the hotel is just great with a lovely light. Check in is fast and very discreet. The rooms are amazing. I love the bright colors and especially the bathroom is an experience by itself.  
The bed is cozy and comfy and perfect for a good sleep. 

The Bankers Bar is one of my favorite bars. The atmosphere is cozy with low light. Try the Bankers Martini!

The breakfast at Blanc is just delicious. There is a buffet with great choices and also some other dishes to order from the menu. 
At the evenings you can enjoy a show cooking as there is a big window to the kitchen.",5,2013,10,01
44,Exceptional service exceeding expectations,"While the Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona is not as grand in structure compared to other luxury hotels, the service and staff make up for any shortcomings in room size or grandiose asthetic.  The location is ideal, the amenites are wonderful, but more than anything the staff (from the concierge to the wait staff at breakfast to house keeping to check-in) are warm, friendly, knowledgeable and go out of their way to make your visit to the hotel and the city special and unique. They do this in a way that is ever present and available, but not the least bit obtrusive.",5,2013,10,01
44,Wonderful Hotel,"My wife and I flew into Barcelona from New York for the start of a two week vacation.  We spent three nights at the Mandarin Oriental and it is a fine hotel.  The only reason we did not give it an ""excellent"" review was primarily because of the size of our room.  We booked a room with a terrace that overlooked the courtyard and it was lovely.  But it was not possible for one of us to sit at the desk and let the other pass by without moving.  The bathroom, shower and amenities were all top rate and the towels and linens were what one should expect from Mandarin Oriental.  If you are planning to stay here and if you are traveling from the U.S., it is more than likely that you will not have entrance to your room until later in the afternoon.  The reception was very helpful to us and we only had to wait for a couple of hours before getting our room.  The concierges were very helpful in planing our days as well as making dinner reservations.  Breakfast at the hotel was a treat.  One of the nice touches, is that the staff knows how you like your coffee as well as your juice in the morning after just one day.  They all go out of their way to make one feel at home. The hotel has a restaurant with a two-star rating from Michelin .. We ate there and we were disappointed by the food.  The bar (and pool) on the roof is a wonderful spot to watch the sun set.  The dinner ideas from the concierge desk were all amazing, interesting, fun and delicious.  If we return to Barcelona we will probably not stay here again.  I say that even though this is a fine hotel with excellent service.  I think the next time we would probably opt for the Gothic Quarter.",4,2013,09,30
44,Understated Elegance and Efficiency,"Perfectly located in the heart of the city, from the moment we arrived we were treated with nothing but an excellent level of service - the bags simply disappeared effortlessly, we were served with ice cold jasmine tea during the check in process and then shown to our room where our bags reappeared again.  The room was simple and elegant, with all the mod cons you'd expect from a top-class hotel, but with a couple more - the towels were constantly refreshed and changed throughout the day, even when we went out for dinner late in the evening.  The service was invisible and things just happened as if by magic.  Also the concierge service was super helpful and gave us some great dining recos - would definitely stay here next time I'm town.",5,2013,09,29
44,Fabulous!,"Good location, great rooms, excellent amenities and world class staff! Can't ask for anything more!

44,"Excellent property, Location and Saff","My wife and I recently spent 4 nights at the Mandarin and we were both very pleased with the experience.  First, we arrived at 9:00 and they were able to get us a room right away without us having to request early check-in.  We had an inside rom with a terrace which was very well appointed (very calming), quiet and modern.  The hotel location is excellent, within an easy walk to restaurants and the major sights.  Finally the staff was great; the concierge found us some excellent restaurants and also helped book tickets to La Familia online so we did not need to stand in any lines.  Yes, the chairs are low in the restaurant and bar but who cares – this is an excellent hotel in an exciting city.",5,2013,09,19
44,"Fabulous property, location and service","Yes, there are cheaper places to stay in Barcelona that are still quite nice, but if you want to treat yourself and value location, service and style, check in here. We loved our stay, from the moment we arrived -- delayed because we were bumped from our flight and my suitcase was lost -- until we departed four days later. The ""emergency kit"" they gave me with toiletries, a camisole and underwear exemplified the hotel's attention to detail. Their ""technology kit"" contained all sorts of adapters and cables, and the room and bath were sleek, comfortable and quiet.

We found all the staff attentive and cheerful. The concierges were extremely knowledgeable and made us reservations at fabulous restaurants as well as interesting small bars. The housekeepers were excellent, and the dining room staff made a point of greeting us by name the second time we came to breakfast.

The hotel's location in the middle of the Passeig de Gracia is fabulous. Yet when you enter up the ramp, you come into a zone of tranquility that contrasts with the busy street outside. In all, we loved our stay here and hope we can return another time!",5,2013,09,18
44,Opulent Elegance with a Few Minor Hiccups,"After a fairly intensive research period, I chose to stay at the Mandarin Oriental during my weeklong trip to Barcelona.  Based on the reviews I had read, I had some misgivings, but I was pleasantly surprised not to encounter any of these issues during my stay.

Pros
Room decor/comfort: The rooms (I stayed in a few during my stay) are decorated in an attractive, coolly modern white and black scheme.  Each time, I had a room facing out onto the Passeig de Gracia, with a lovely view of the Casa Batllo.  I had been concerned about street noise/construction, but it was never a problem.  The room size, which I had been concerned about, was completely adequate for our needs and we did not feel cramped at all.  

The service: In general, the service was quite warm and attentive, especially in the Blanc restaurant where we took breakfast every morning.  It wasn't say at an Aman-level, and there were a few hiccups (in terms of having to ask for things multiple times, the handling of a noise issue), but in general the service was quite accommodating and gracious.

The location: I could not have been happier with the location of the Mandarin.  From the property, you can very easily walk to virtually anywhere you'd like to see in Barcelona: the Ramblas, the Barri Gotic, etc.  I had been considering staying at the neighboring Majestic, but even that seemed just a smidge too far north on the Passeig de Gracia.

The food: We took breakfast every morning at the Blanc restaurant, as well as having afternoon tea there as well.  I still dream about these meals.  The spread is sumptuous, combining fine European pastries, Asian breakfast staples, and the freshest fruits you could imagine.  I ate my weight in Nutella crepes and they were perfect every single time.

Cons
If I had to cite anything, I'd say that the value for the money is slightly off given the minor issues I encountered during our stay.",4,2013,09,17
44,Not Your Typical Mandarin Oriental,"The Mandarin Oriental was my third Hotel stop in Barcelona after The Claris, and The Majestic.

My first night in the Hotel was in the Deluxe category on the 7th floor facing the street.  The room was very bright with a very contemporary layout and yet very small with very limited storage space for clothing being in a very small Armoire with two small drawers at the bottom.  The bed was seemed very hard for a 5 star hotel and did not have a box spring which can be typical of the more basic european hotels, yet the linens were nice and comfortable  There was a single sink in the bathroom and very limited counter space which for two people could be and issue.  

The room was very bright; however, and had a very nice black out curtain.  Given that the hotel is contemporary, sounds can carry in the hall way's so you can here people coming and going from their rooms if they are talking or there are children.

I asked to be moved to the next room category for the following 3 nights because my partner was arriving and I didn't see how we would be comfortable in the Deluxe room given it's size.  A terrace room was available and had a larger feel but the same small single sink area and small armoire with two drawers for clothes.  There were floor to ceiling windows and a small deck which looked out into a shared courtyard which was very nice; however, there's a school playground below with night lights and the local adults and kids seemed to use this area well after ten and the shouting and cheering carried easily through the windows.

We used the car service from the airport and were told that the service would be complimentary; however, it was $170 Euro's and the driver refused to assist with getting the luggage into the car.

Having stayed at the Mandarin New York and The Mandarin Las Vegas I do not believe that the rooms are anywhere as nice and do not justify the high cost of the rooms.  I found The Majestic to be in a better location and the rooms to be far more luxurious and well appointed.

The common areas of The Mandarin Property itself are nice; however, the roof top terrace restaurant is very small and looks to the west and not over the city.  The pool itself was only one or two feet deep and more of a reflection pool than anything usable.  There's a pool down in the basement of the Hotel next to the sauna which has that classic zen feel of the other Mandarins but still seemed to be a miss.

The service in the Hotel is very good and I was always warmly greeted and asked if I needed anything. We ate at all of the dining venues and found the main dining room to be very large and comfortable and the food was good with great service.

We had an opportunity to eat at the main restaurant Moments which I will rate separately; however, it was a very nice experience but not the best we had in Barcelona.

Not taking into account the great service at this Hotel we feel that this property falls short of the other Mandarin properties and doesn't justify it's high costs.  Not only do the room charges seem excessive; however, there seems to be another charge for something at every turn. Including 18 Euro per day for internet connectivity.  When your paying 5 star prices this should be complimentary.

Another point that is bothered me about The Mandarin in Barcelona.  Tipping in Europe generally isn't customary but is appreciated when warranted.  Neither The Claris or The Majestic had a spot on the checks for a Tip and the bill was always totaled when presented.  However, only at The Mandarin did I see a position open for tips and the bill not totaled.  This was for every service, room service, dining room, or bar.  I did tip throughout my stays at different places where warranted; however, I felt as if it were just one more are for this Hotel to make money on their clients.

Again, I have to say the Hotel service staff was wonderful and exemplary.  However, our stay was $3,900 Euro for a 4 night stay and that included one free night.  Because of the poor quality and size of the rooms and the excessive cost given the value received we are giving it a poor rating.",2,2013,09,15
44,"First time, and last, in a Mandarin Oriental","We travel about 13 weeks a year and like luxury hotels but had never stayed in a Mandarin Oriental so when there were no Four Seasons in Barcelona we booked this one but we were very disappointed in pretty well everything except the staff all of whom were great. We arrived at 3pm and although we had requested a high floor all they had available were the two bottom floors looking over a very noisy street. We were told that a higher floor room would not be available until about five. Since check out is at noon why does it take them five hours to get the rooms ready? In any case we left our bags and went exploring for a few hours. When we came back we were taken to a room on the seventh floor overlooking the seedy and dirty backyards of surrounding buildings. The list of what was wrong with the room is very long but basically they totally sacrificed functionally for design and it just doesn't work. Even though we had reserved a deluxe room it was very small and cramped. The safe is inside a dark cupboard and positioned so that it is very hard to access and even harder to see the keyboard; the magnifying mirror in the bathroom is set so low and not adjustable that my 5'3"" wife had to crouch down to use it; the lighting is very dim, the shower leaks; etc. The breakfast buffet was the most basic we have ever seen and when you ordered eggs off the menu they took forever. One day, even though there were only two other couples in the restaurant it took an incredible 45 minutes to get our eggs and the poor waitress was apologising to us all even though it was certainly not her fault. We felt ripped ofvwhich we nev do at Four Seasons, or Ritz, or Oberoi.",3,2013,09,15
44,Wow experience!,"Outstanding hotel! The service is excellent, they knew all our names personally and would ask specifically about my 6 month old daughter by name everyday. The food was delicious! The pool is stunning. The location is perfectly central. All in all it was an amazing experience and we will most definitely be staying here again the next time we go to Barcelona! ",5,2013,09,15
44,Not as good as it thinks it is,"The hotel is well located and, as you would expect from an MO, very stylish.
Service is good, although a little under staffed, and there are some great views from the roof terrace where there is also a small pool.
The rooms are fairly small and are not particularly well designed (although I think I had a bad one and they vary a bit) in particular the bathroom as mentioned by other reviewers.
Room rates are pretty steep for what it is, and does not even include free wifi - which is just annoying.",3,2013,09,11
44,Great Location in Middle of Everything,"I'm biased towards Mandarin Orientals (MO).  MO and Four Seasons are my hotels of choice when I can afford them. :-)  The Barcelona property is an old bank that was converted into a hotel. The location is main thorough fare providing easy access to museums, plazas, Gothic quarters, etc..  

Booking with AMEX Platinum includes breakfast.  The breakfast buffet is nice with a good arrangement of fresh fruits.  

Overall, a nice stay an interesting property.  As other have mentioned, seems understaffed, which was fine.  Never a problem finding a staff member whenever needed.",5,2013,09,09
44,Does not live up to the name,"Paid with Amex Plat, so we got upgraded. Disappointed that there's no bathtub. Room view isn't great at all. No extra pillows or blankets were provided in the closet. Bathroom shower design wasn't good - water everywhere. 

Food was not that nice compared to all the other Mandarin Orientals. Breakfast - not nice, with that price we are paying, my expectations were much higher, eggs are over cooked. Tea was not brewed. We ordered room service tea, they gave us hot water in a thermos jug = not boiling water... Most other Mandarin hotels will have tea bags or coffee in the rooms, not this one.
However, service was excellent. Concierge team is extremely knowledgable. Every single place they recommended was REALLY GOOD! 

Advice: 
1, Tell Concierge what type of food, atmosphere u want, and you will get it. 
2, Make sure your room is not Garden View - EYE SORE. There is no Garden on higher floors.
3, DO NOT ORDER room service. (not a big choice on the menu anyway)",3,2013,09,09
44,A great hotel.,"A newer add to this top chain. Well located right in the heart of things. Staff is friendly and very efficient. Great knowledge of the city. Breakfast is good with
Choices but 39€. Maybe pricey but so is everything here. The one problem I noticed is the light or lack of it the bathroom. Designer used way too much black in that room.  The best concierge service I have ever encountered. Amazing knowledge done with friendly politeness. Great hotel experience but not the cheapest  ",5,2013,09,07
44,Great service and great location but not as good as in Asia,"This hotel must have the best staff and service in Spain.  Hotel is also perfectly located.   The staff always greeted us on our return from touring or descent into the lobby.  It's a nice modern hotel in the heart of Barcelona.  Like most Spanish hotels, it does seem somewhat understaffed.  As great as the service was, we did have an issue where we were given the wrong address to a restaurant at which the Concierge had made reservations for us.   The Concierge desk was always incredibly busy.   This Mandarin would not match up to those in Asia but it's still the best hotel in Barcelona.  The roof top terrace has nice views of Barcelona as well.",5,2013,09,06
44,Friendly staff!,"Great service defines our experience. The hotels sort of quirky design does sacrifice utility over design, but the excellent staff more that makes up for this. Location is wonderful for exploring the city. Wonderful concierge staff with great restaurant recommendations.  Management and wait staff at Blanc, the casual restaurant were particularly excellent - remembering our names and preferred drink!!",5,2013,09,04
44,A terrific staff make this former Bank Building a winner,"Perfectly located in a most active part of downtown Barcelona, the mandarin Oriental is housed in a renovated commercial structure. As a result the room are generally small--long and narrow, The furnishings, however, are ideally suited to the space. A narrow shower is enhanced with an intriguing and comfortable water flow that seemingly enters through a light fixture. the rooms are comfortable, though not spacious by any means. The staff is friendly, helpful and anxious to please. They make your stay. the one serious flaw--though it may seem minor to some -- is the internet. Rarely have I seen an upscale hotel charge so much for wi-fi (18 Euros a day) and then it is slow and weak. And by the way, for some (especially those using Blackberry, the internet reception in Barcelona is generally spotty",5,2013,09,03
44,Great service and staff,"While this hotel did not live up to our amazing experience in the Mandarin Oriental NYC, we nevertheless had a great time and the staff were generally very accommodating and friendly.  The service by far made up for a couple of issues that would have made it otherwise truly unique.  The location was great as it was in the heart of it all and within walking distance to all possible sightseeing destinations.  The building is new and as such the rooms felt fresh and up-to-date. We had connecting rooms that were overlooking the rear which did not have a great view, however it was serene and we had a balcony that we used every day.  The reviews about the room size being small are accurate and the modern design may not be for everyone.  Bottom-line we had a great time and the staff of the hotel contributed to this positive experience.",4,2013,09,02
44,One of the very best,"This was a great hotel,the service was just what you would expect.The staff was welcoming and went out of their way to do whatever they could for you. The in-house terrace bar, had a romantic view. The room was very nice and welcoming, and the hotel was the best one we stayed at in 10 days of various Spanish cities.",5,2013,08,31
44,Perfect place,"We loved our stay in the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona. The hotel was great and the location was perfect: I the middle of the main shopping area, close to the sights and the restaurant. 
A very good place to stay! ",5,2013,08,31
44,First class,Having stayed in many a Mandarin Oriental I was delighted by both the service and the style of this hotel in Barcelona. First class. The team there seem to share a real and honest commitment to make our stay an enjoyable one. Recommend highly.,5,2013,08,17
44,Excellent Hotel situated in a great location in Barcelona,"This was my 1st trip to Spain and I relied on my Travel Agent to recommend an Hotel. I was so happy with her recommendation that I emailed her during my stay to thank her.
I saw some negative reviews and can only surmise that the people are very difficult to please!!
The room size and quality was excellent. They even provide a Yoga Mat for in room exercising and stretching.
The quality of service provided by staff in particular Concierges, restaurant staff and Bellboys is absolutely superb, They go out of their way to try to personalise the service. So many people addressed me by my name and this is not a small Hotel!!
Restaurants and ideas recommended by the Concierges were great. 
The only negative points are;
1. Hotel provides free WiFi in public areas but you have to pay 18 Euros per day to use it in the comfort of your room - I believe this is penny pinching and at prices of rooms should be free everywhere!!
2. I wanted an Hotel with a pool and on internet it looked like there was a small outdoor pool on the Terrace but the depth is about 25cms or 10 inches. The Hotel does have a 12 meter indoor pool but it is dark and nothing fantastic.
However if I have another short stay in Barcelona I'm almost certain I would return to this Hotel and would not hesitate to recommend it to others",5,2013,08,15
44,Lovely.,"It doesn't matter how expensive it is nor how many stars it's rated,  the lighting in a city hotel room is that of a cave. The Mandarin Oriental was different though. Light flooded into our 5th story window, changing the ""dark city cave"" experience into a ""city retreat"" feeling. The lighting of the rooms was just the beginning of a pleasant experience in Barcelona.

Upon arrival we were greeted hospitably by reception who then offered to return our rental car from our week in the country. The concierge than recommended Tapas 24 just around the corner, where we headed over for lunch, (don't miss this casual eatery). When we returned the rooms for ready and we began to settle in. 

The rooms were decorated simply and nicely with a modern flare. Bathrooms were the essence of luxury, large showers and tubs with large mirrors and tiled floors. The pool on the roof was less than a dip pool with only  two feet of water but it was quite a respite in the hot summer. 

Finally the congeniality of the hotel's management and staff really shined; we attended an FC Barcelona game and the concierges gave us Barcelona scarves.  A couple days later the concierges hearing of my younger sisters obsession with soccer sent up a poster of the whole team as well as a sweet treat and frosting soccer ball.",5,2013,08,11
44,The Perfect Hotel in Barcelona,"This sleek modern hotel is the perfect place to stay in architecture-focused Barcelona.  The design is beautiful and the ambiance is so calm, which provides an excellent respite from busy Barcelona.  It has an excellent location and very comfortable beds.  We also really enjoyed the best breakfast buffet I have ever seen.  And I generally avoid buffets at all cost. We were only staying one night (pre-cruise) and the excellent concierge arranged an amazing city tour for the morning.  The guide (Rosa) was fantastic as was the driver.  I acknowledge this chain is pricey, but if you can swing it I would recommend it.",5,2013,07,30
44,First Class Service,"We stayed for 9 nights in June.  I cannot overemphasise the quality of the service in this hotel.  In addition to making our stay extremely comfortable, the Concierge team were excellent in helping us with several administration tasks.  Requests for printing, photocopying etc were turned around very promptly.  

The room was beautifully designed and very large.  We had a deluxe room which felt more like a small apartment.  The only slight downside was the night-time lighting, there wasn't really any possibility to have a small light on in the bathroom.  Turning the ""night light"" on in the bedroom can wake the other person in the main room as it lights the whole floor.  There also is no full length mirror in the room, although one was brought immediately on request.

Room service was fast and efficient, they even remembered our breakfast order each morning without us requesting it which was very welcome (9 days in a row gets tedious ordering the same thing).  The food was high quality (I have had better) , although the choice rather limited.

Overall this trip was made very enjoyable by the staff at MOB.  Truly first class service and we will definitely be returning.",5,2013,07,28
44,Beautiful and really nice place to stay,"The Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona is a beautiful place to stay.
The rooms are spacious and modern and the bathrooms are really lovely.
The hotel has a really lovely roof top garden with a bar, lounges and a dipping pool area. It’s lovely to sit in at night and watch the sunset or just lay round and red. It’s a highlight of the hotel. Whilst the pool is not deep it’s great to lie around in (it really is only a dipping pol). 
The hotel is in a fantastic spot in Barcelona with lots of shops and restaurants outside its door. The hop on hop off buses also stop out the font. We only needed to walk a few steps to find all we needed in terms of restaurants and shopping. 
Breakfast is really nice with an excellent selection and just about everything you could want. We had breakfast included which was well worth it.
All of the staff were really lovely and friendly and couldn’t do too much to help us. The concierge arranged our tickets that we needed to skip the line for the Familia Sagrada and the Picasso Museum.
The gym is reasonable and has most of what you need. There is an indoor swimming pool but we didn’t use it. It looked nice however.
Would recommend the Mandarin Oriental as a haven to rest in after a very busy day in Barcelona.",5,2013,07,25
44,You don't get what you pay for,"Sure, location is pretty convenient. Having said that you don't get the sense of usual Mandarin oasis feeling as the entrance/lobby is tangled among a matrix of retail shops. In fact the reception is literally next to a Manolo Blahnik
shop! Rooms lack the usual luxurious feel. Instead they are sparse and minimalistic. Wardrobe and bathroom doors are flimsy and Ikea-like. Toilet is cramped and positioned so close to the wall that you can't sit straight without touching it. Our room faces directly a council housing estate, hardly what one would expect for €500+. No coffee maker, no complimentary wi-fi.  Swimming pool on the roof was more a dipping pool. The one down in the spa looks nice and zen when it's empty but once you have 2 people inside it can't fit a 3rd.  Overall it feels more like a boutique hotel than a 5-star hotel. Last year we stayed at Hotel Moo which I feel offers much better value for money. 
",3,2013,07,24
44,Almost perfect!,"The best location in Barcelona for sightseeing, upscale shopping and proximity to fantastic restaurants.  The service from the concierge is outstanding!  Hotel personnel greet you by name and are quite responsive to your needs.  The breakfast buffet looks great and has a varied selection of hot and cold dishes.  The Banker's Bar serves wonderful tapas along with very well made drinks by the very personable bartenders.  Now for the ""almost""....our room was on the first floor which is partially underground.  It was quite dark, loaded with very modern controls and switches, but do not accept a room on this floor.  Housekeeping was spotty.  Always had to call for turndown and repeatedly had to ask for additional soap.  The toiletries were not up to MO standards, delivered in plastic tubes that were hard to distinguish.  We asked the front desk for another room, but they repeatedly said that it was not possible due to the hotel being full.  All in all, this is a very nice home in Barcelona.",4,2013,07,23
44,THE place to stay in Barcelona!,"Service! From beginning to end, this hotel is FIRST RATE. The staff seems truly to love their jobs and are eager to make guests happy.
Reception is quick and pleasant, especially after a long international flight, with missed connections. As we stood to check in, someone showed up and offered an herbal tea tea without being asked. Nice touch.
Breakfast is wonderful and inclusive. What do you want? They will try to make it happen, with a smile!
Each concierge is knowledgeable and helpful.
We literally took names of those who went out of their way to help make our stay exceptional. A glowing letter has been sent to management.
WiFi is included (it surprises me that many 5-star hotels that are still charging).
The hotel is situated in a lovely area, walking distance to most things you'll want to do.
We felt like royalty throughout our stay. Yes, MO hotels are pricey; but this was by far the best we've ever experienced and worth every Euro.",5,2013,07,20
44,Great location! Great service!,"This beautiful gem of a hotel is centrally located on Passeig de Gracia, far enough from the riff raff of Las Ramblas but a perfect walking distance to all of the sights and neighbourhoods. 
The concierge staff is phenomenal and the staff makes a point of knowing and using your surname name. (It's not mechanical, like at the Ritz Carlton hotels, but warm and genuine.)
The spa is delightful and the rooftop dipping pool is a nice refuge above the city on a hot afternoon. 
Can't wait to return!",5,2013,07,20
44,"Outstanding location, Small Rooms","This hotel has an excellent location, situated  on the  passing de Garcia amongst many  well-known retailers and cafes. It is extremely convenient as there is easy access to double decker tour buses which take you on a fantastic tour around Barcelona including explanation about the sites. I highly recommend this. The hotel  service is excellent, from the bell men to the receptionists and the concierge. The concierge are very friendly and recommended us to really good tapas. Our personal favourite was ""catchitas"", which was about  a 5 minute walk from the hotel. However the actual rooms were very small and there was hardly any space for our suit cases to be placed neatly around the room.  The bathroom also had frosted glass, which made it impossible for someone to shower early in the morning without being woken up by the glare of the light. Buffet breakfast was good, as they had a great selection of breakfast cereals, yoghurt and fruit. The á la carte menu was excellent and contained a extensive variety of eggs and other delicious breakfast treats. The service at breakfast was also fantastic.  We also specifically enjoyed our experience at the spa. Our massages were among one of the best we have  ever experienced. Sunny afternoons were also well spent by the pool on level 9. although the pool is only 60cm deep, it is a great place to chill and soak up some of barcelonas sun while escaping the  hustle and bustle of the city.  (We also enjoyed great sushi and cocktails here). Proceeding to level 9 however was quite a task, as only one lift was able to reach that level. We often  found ourselves sending down unwanted lifts as we were waiting for the left  lift that was able to take us to level 9.  All in all, the location is exceptional, and the spa and our poolside experiences were highlights. However the size and practicality of the rooms were questionable.  
",3,2013,07,14
44,Rooms Too Small for the $$$,"Hotel was very exclusive 5star but we were very disappointed with the room size.  We had business to attend to and could not do it in the room  Only 1 chair and 1 end table  I seriously don't know how you would order room service unless you eat on the bed. 
It was very modern which I don't mind but bathroom very exposed not enough privacy there.  Shower head was strong and excellent.  The spa was very accommodating and we liked the fact that the gym and spa were part of the room fee.  The service was excellent.  If you don't mind the small room with big $$$ rate than you can't beat the location and service.",4,2013,07,11
44,Service was superb,"My wife and I recently stayed here prior to a Mediterranean cruise. The hotel is in an extremely convenient location right near two of the most famous Gaudi houses.Although the room was a bit small ,the service was among the best I have experienced, the concierges were extremely good.The lobby bar and restaurant were also very nice,overall a good experience.",5,2013,07,10
44,Great hotel in pleasant location,"Pros
(1) Room was well designed and comfortable.
(2) Free breakfast was offered when we arrived early in the morning from our flight at about 9am. A room was made ready within 2 hours while we had breakfast.
(3) Breakfast buffet was good but expensive. It is in a nice setting.
(4) Room at the back of the building was very quiet.
(5) Small pool and bar at rooftop to relax in.
(6) In a nice location where the shopping district is.

Cons

(1) Conceirage did not answer all queries by email. Was generally fine but could have been more helpful.
(2) Spa was so-so.

p.s. Try the tapas bar, Tapac 24, off peak hours near the hotel. Every dish was wonderful.",5,2013,07,10
44,Brilliant !!,"Stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for 3 nights at the end of June.  This is a great hotel, located on one of the best streets in Barcelona and near some of the main tourist sites.

The rooftop pool was most enjoyable for spending relaxation time, enjoying the city views, sunshine and food.  My deluxe room had fine views over the Mimosa garden and was quiet.  The furnishing in the room and bathroom was excellent.  The food in the Blanc restaurant is high quality.  The hotel bar was pleasant in the evenings.

Overall the design of the hotel is brilliant and fits in with the trendy Barcelona style.  Will definitely return, hopefully in a few months time.",5,2013,07,03
44,Get what you pay for,"Expensive - Yes. Outstanding location - Yes. Amazing helpful staff - Yes. Extremely well appointed room - Yes. Great Dining, Bar and Guest Facilities - Yes. Could not recommend highly enough. Our first visit, and certainly not our last visit, to Barcelona was made by this hotel",5,2013,06,29
44,Wearing well,"I chose the MO for a number of reasons - it was right next to the Passeig de Gracia station exit (Oh no it wasn't they bloody moved it) and it was in the bit of Barcelona I like to be.  It didn't disappoint.  I like good looking men and women trying to make me feel good - they did. I did. It's a bit dear (500 quid for a standard room) but the rooms are very nice and the entrance is very dramatic and chic.  The beds are comfortable - the service everywhere was good - the rooms are functional and the bathrooms are smart, clean and you can just about suss the taps. 
You don't half look the business rocking up in shorts amidst a sea of Armani suits.  Well Armani is a bit on the cheap side so they have begged Brioni to open within the hotel - he did too and in a recession.  Good old Brioni.  In the lobby is a window for Bel & Cia and they have a shop half a block down. Now if you want to buy serious understated luxury that's your shop. You're never going to look flash but you will look elegant.  Bel also sell Panamas (but they're real ones and they WILL  set you back thousands and not hundreds of €.) They used to keep them on a hat stand by the door - sadly no longer.

Had a cocktail there but ate elsewhere",5,2013,06,28
44,N I C E  and  G O O D ,"We were just stay in mandarin oriento Tokyo end of May. Just 3 weeks later we stay here 4 night choice here main reason best location recommend form one of my Swedish friend  we were pleased my choice. 
Compare those two I like Barcelona more even Tokyo also good.

We arrival hotel around 11am, but the room didn't ready yet, anyhow front desk let us enjoy half breakfast and take shower in spa because we have booking private tour at 1400....

Spa should not be missing. We have take 80min spa twice, the spa booking full so time not very suitable for us, anyhow we decide take spa and cancel dinner booking.... it is value compare other city same quality, and all the girls is nice and friendly.

Generally say this hotel is charming and all the staff is nice.
The room is modern I recommend.

Special thanks all the girls work in breakfast, they are so kind and nice... :)

44,The perfect base for a weekend in Barcelona,"We stayed here for a long-weekend, hoping for some April Catalan sunshine to make up for London's gloomy weather.  It was not to be.  There was rain in Barcelona, while London was sunny.  However, the Mandarin Oriental did its best to make up for the weather.

This hotel was the perfect base for our weekend.  Centrally situated on the Passeig de Gracia, it has Gaudi buildings and upmarket shops for neighbours, and bus stops and a metro station a few paces away.   If you are feeling energetic (and we were) you can easily walk from the hotel to the Sagrada Familia and almost all of Barcelona's other tourist destinations.  The hotel has an ample supply of umbrellas for loan. 

The helpful concierge arranged an English speaking guide for us, and we ""did"" the city at leisure over a couple of days, by metro and taxi and on foot.  The queues for the major attractions were long, but having a guide meant that we were always taken past the queue and straight in.

The Mandarin Oriental has a Spa (though we did not find time to use it), the Bankers Bar (which we did find time to enjoy), and two restaurants: ""Blanc Brasserie"", which served interesting Catalan cuisine (plus the usual international food offerings) in the evening, and a full buffet breakfast in the morning; and ""Moments"", a formal restaurant with a Michelin star (which was fully booked during our short stay).

Staff in the bar and in the brasserie (and, indeed, throughout the hotel) were very attentive, and even remembered our names - something which we found quite exceptional, given that we were only short-stay guests.

Our room had a fine view, overlooking the main road, and was only noisy when the teaching union's anti-cuts demonstration passed by on the Sunday morning.  (Nice to know that some problems are shared the world over !).

The room was, though, a rather quirky shape, and not large for the cost.  The decor was very elegant, but showed the triumph of style over substance in some respects, particularly in the spaces for hanging clothes and in the bathroom.

These, though, are small quibbles.   This is a superbly run hotel, with excellent facilities, in a perfect location.   We had a great weekend there, and will return whenever we can.",5,2013,06,24
44,""" The perfect location while visiting Barcelona""","Stayed here for a couple of nights with friends.  I cannot say enough about the concierge staff, from assisting us in getting our luggage from our airlines, to the most wonderful restaurant recommendations, and just a overall can do attitude.  The rooms were quite different, as they were pod like in shape and appearance, but were clean and offered all the necessities.  I found the bathroom lighting to be on the dark side.  Our room faced the street and I never heard any noise.  The air conditioning was whisper quiet.  Loved the location.  We were able to walk most everywhere. The daily breakfast was extensive and delicious.  Again, the restaurant staff was attentive and spoke lovely English, as did all the staff.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,06,22
44,"Best location, but very expensive","We are staying here for several days and love the location. It is central to everything and such a lovely street. The housekeeping is very good. The concierge was helpful, but not  as proactive as I have experienced in other 5 star hotels. The buffet breakfast is good and the staff is top notch. They are very eager to please and be helpful. Overall, the hotel is nice but I would rate it as 4 stars.",5,2013,06,19
44,"Great location, excellent staff","At first it seemed too modern for us, but we adjusted quickly.  We had two rooms facing the courtyard, which might have provided the worst view I have ever seen in a luxury hotel, but if you're on a vacation in a place like Barcelona, how much time are you going to spend looking out the window?  The location is in a safe area, is pretty central to many of the major tourist attractions, and there were no noise issues.

The staff in both the hotel and restaurant was very attentive, charming, friendly, and made every attempt to meet whatever special requests we had.  I don't know if they all love their jobs, but they gave that impression.  The food was also excellent, even for those of us with narrow diets.

I gave it 3 stars for value and rooms because the rooms are not that big, but they are nice.  They might be average for Europe, though.",5,2013,06,18
44,"Great Service, small problems","The service is amazing from the time you walk in to the time you walk out.  The spa is the best part of the hotel, the services were great and everyone was extremely helpful!  The food is amazing, it is in the perfect location for tourists and it's a beautiful, well maintained luxurious property.  As a warning to all the men out there, they are located next to a Tiffany's jewelry store and promote it all over the hotel. 
The room I checked into smelled of mold, they quickly found me an open room and moved me which is all I ask.  That room didn't smell until I went into the bathroom, it appears the design of the shower is the problem.  The showers have no visible drain, the water runs off the sides of the platform you stand on and under to a hidden drain.  The problem is the house keeps either can't or simply don't clean under there.  The rooms are smaller than normal rooms but still extremely nice!  I have two other very minor problems with the hotel, one is the elevators.  You have to have a key to access each floor, that becomes a problem when multiple people are staying on different floors.  They don't allow you to book set rooms ahead of time so now you are unable to go to a friends room and they can't come to yours.  This can be solved with a little bit of planning but it's a pain.  Finally the room didn't have Qtips, I know that sounds so minor but it's an expensive hotel and I expect little things to be provided.  Overall I will be staying here again, the small problems were vastly over come by the warmth and kindness of the staff!  Also while in Barcelona check out Spanish Tours, it's an American staffed tour company that is AMAZING!!!",4,2013,06,15
44,One of my favourites!,"We stayed at this hotel for five lovely nights. Maria , at the front desk, is lovely, charming, and nothing is a problem for her. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to the next category of room - thanks to the American Express Platinum Card. Lovely, or so I thought. Maria mentioned that the 7th floor room would be facing the back of the hotel, and its courtyard. Ever so graciously, she indicated that the room we were originally booked in had a wonderful view of La Rambla. Yes, the 7th floor upgrade was roomier and had a full balcony, but the view was of the back of other apartments and  it was too high up to benefit from the courtyard gardens. Not too charming. So I chose the original room on the second floor. While smaller, it was perfectly appointed and decorated in such a manner as to minimize the size of the room. I loved being able to hear and see what was happening below on such a busy street during the day with the windows open. But at night, with the windows closed, and the shades drawn, the room transformed itself into a quiet cocoon. . 
The view from the roof top restaurant (fusion and delicious) and pool  is spectacular. 
The breakfast buffet should not be missed. The super friendly and charming staff (who knew our names and preferences after our first breakfast)  are to be commended!
I just loved staying at this hotel! Kudos to the management for hiring such gracious staff.",5,2013,06,12
44,Beautiful hotel in great location,"An excellent hotel. It is located on the Passeig de Gracia, within walking distance of Barcelona's sights, shops and restaurants. Exceptional service from all of the staff: front desk, concierge, maid service, both restaurants and the garden bar. We stayed in two deluxe rooms, which were very comfortable and well-equipped. Staff treated our two sons (13 and 11 years) very well. The Blanc restaurant is very good and Moments is one of the best in the world. The Mimosa bar in the garden is an oasis in a great city. I would highly recommend.",5,2013,06,06
44,An HOUR for a Drink!,"The hotel is extremely expensive especially if you compare the service level and room size with that of the Arts hotel or W. 

Given that I'm over paying per square meter, I expect to have better service. But the reality is that the service is extremely slow and the staff are extreme slow. 

During my last stay I took one of the most expensive suits they have, the one that costs 3000+ euross per night! 

Given all that, when I reached my room at 10pm I found that the minibar was not replenished. So I had to order a drink from room service. It took a whole hour to get the drink! Their excuse was tat there weren't any cold ones!

That type of thing has never happened to me even in 3 stars hotels.",3,2013,06,04
44,Expected better,"Unbeatable service, extremely helpful and friendly staff, great location for shopping. But rooms rather small and those above passeig de Gracia very noisy. Disappointed by the roof top pool which was very cold and the whole pool area was much smaller than expected with only 6 sunchairs. I've been to other hotels in Barcelona with better rooms and nicer roof top pool area for half the prize.",4,2013,06,03
44,İt is excellent..,This hotel is great..We had no problem..And it is so close to all the attractions..It is on a beautiful street..We had our 4 year old son with us he loved to be there..But the best part of the hotel is the consierge..They were so helpful ..We ate in great restaurants..And they handle everything..Even they fix our sons toy..If you have a thought of choosing in btw Arts and Mandarin choose Mandarin you wont regret it..,5,2013,06,03
44,Gloriously Glamourous & Gluten Free,"Beautiful and elegant hotel.  The staff and service and the comfortable and Glamourous environment and rooms are major selling points.

I it's good enough for Rhianna tonight it's good enough for us.

Gluten free breakfast was a delightful surprise.

",5,2013,06,02
44,Overpriced transit hotel,"The location is good for the city and the staff are well trained and excellent, but the hotel leads a lot to be desired.

To me it was a designers dream but a visitors nightmare, the reception area had very low and uncomfortable seating (the type people of a certain age couldn't get up once they had got down!!). We booked a deluxe room via our UK agent and were massively dissappointed. The room was kitted out for a disabled visitor and whilst I do very much appreciate the needs of a disabled person I am not (happily) one of them. When challenged as to why we had a disabled room the answer was that all the other deluxe rooms were full - full with who or what I would like to know because the hotel did not seem in anyway busy.

We didn't eat dinner there (generally I don't like eating dinner in hotels) but we did have the most overpriced breakfast, 25 Euros for Continental and 39 Euros for Ala Carte - I stay in London quite often at some of the top hotels and these prices are extortionate even by London standards and frankly the hot breakfast was not good - I think (but not 100% sure) the scrambled egg was the powdered version.

The Bankers Bar was totally uncomfortable, again low seating around the sides, however the best bit (joke) was sitting at the bar, low stools - high bar, the absolute worst combination.

As I say designers dream but visitors nightmare.

We will not be staying there again, at any price!",2,2013,05,28
44,Mandarin Oriental style & class in Barcelona,"Penthouse suite was perfect. Our trip was for business and Mandarin Oriental (MO) was the client's choice. Stay at an MO hotel and you will become a ""fan"". This property is in a central location and this makes it great as you can be anywhere in the city in a short time. Excellent service from the moment you arrive, great spa, pool. For business trips MO is a great choice, anyone you meet with will be made to feel like the most important guest",5,2013,05,24
44,Lovely hotel,"This is a really lovely hotel.   We booked junior suits, which gave us much needed additional room.  A nice bonus is that the junior suite had an extra bathroom.  The service from start to finish was wonderful.  Breakfast came with our stay and was luxuriously done.  The bar is very nice and comfortable and the restaurant was stellar.  You cannot beat this location unless you want to be on the water.  A terrific place to stay as a tourist - right in the shopping area, easy access to everything.  We loved it.",5,2013,05,22
44,Perfection: Hotel and Location,"We had a toss up on our trip to Barcelona: the Arts or MO. The final decision to stay at the MO was based upon location: we wanted to be central. But let's get away from location for a moment, and talk about the hotel. For those who are already 'fans' as Mandarin calls them, then what I am going to say will resonate: the staff here gets it! Everyone is immensely helpful and committed to making you feel welcome. Our meals in the two restaurants were flawless. Our room was small, but not claustrophobic, dominated by a large king size bed. Everything was so MO: simple, while and very design-orineted. The bathroom was wild, with a large walk in shower, with more pressure than we had ever experienced in a hotel; as well as a nice size tub and crazy sink (could have used two though, a minor flaw). The terrace was a great refuge, and quite surprising in a downtown property. All services exceptional. You cannot go wrong here. Would we return? Yes. What about the Arts...we had an exceptional dinner there, and it is an option for you to consider as well.",5,2013,05,20
44,Good Location,"We stayed at the MO as our first stop in Europe and the Hotel Arts/Ritz as our last stop.  They are both very nice hotels, however I would definitely choose the Hotel Arts/Ritz as my preferred hotel for many reasons.  The good is that MO offered excellent service upon arrival and we were assigned our own Butler who whisked us from the curbside into our room for check-in. The hotel location is close to Las Ramblas and shopping.  The breakfast was wonderful, the bar had nice ambiance, the room service food was good and the hotel was not overcrowded.  
The not so good is that our suite was supposedly double upgraded but I felt we may have been downgraded.  I found the room to be very uncomfortable in many areas.  The bathroom was terrible with sliding frosted glass doors next to the bed and we're still trying to figure out who other than a child could use the circular bathtub.  The bathroom doors didn't close completely and even if they did, your travel partner will be suffering thru blinding light should you need to use the toilet in the night.  We found the furnishings in general to be uncomfortable, the bathroom design not functional, the shower leaked thru the doors and there was some molding.  The balcony was very small with no chairs and overlooked the parking area on the street.  As far as the common areas of the hotel, for the most part everything appeared to be nice; however we were surprised at the extremely dirty carpets in the hallways and elevator.",4,2013,04,30
44,It was like going to Hotel Graduate School,"If I were in the hotel business, this is where I'd send all my executives. I'd say ""watch what the staff does...and learn from it.""  All of the Mandarin Oriental amenities and design flair was in evidence. My room overlooked the main boulevard but was well sound-proofed.  The WiFi was perhaps the bst I've ever experienced--throughout the property.

But the thing that knocked me out was how quickly the staff shared information.  Within a day of my arrival, every employee greeted by my name.  After eating at he Blanc restaurant only once, all of the servers knew that I liked lots of ice in my Diet Coke, and no lemon.  Their awareness of each guest was remarkable.  Their obvious enjoyment in serving you was enjoyable without being obsequious.  

Congratulations to the staff and what must be a great leadership team.",5,2013,04,26
44,4 day visit after a cruise,"This is a fabulous hotel. Checked in and was assigned a first floor room on the boulevard. After some discussion and a lot of maneuvering by the woman at the desk, I got a sixth floor room since I am a light sleeper. They worked very hard to accommodate me since a family had reserved quite a few rooms including one whole floor.
The concierge people are extremely helpful, especially Francisco. I did not know Barcelona that well but once I told him what I was interested in he provided a lot of useful information.
Rooms are spacious and bathroom is nice; amenities are first class. The Banker's Bar in the hotel is very unique since the building formerly housed a bank. The bar still has the safe deposit boxes and the service and pour are very nice. Highly recommend this hotel. The bed was a platform bed and very hard.",5,2013,04,25
44,A bit overpriced but... Great !,"Great choice in Barcelona but I'm not sure it's worth what I paid for...
On top of everything... Staff ! With a very special mention to the ladies dedicated to suites and staff working at the concierge desk.
Location is great, suite and it's bathroom were nice, breakfast ok but service there has to be improved...
Loved what they did with this old building !!!
Two friends stayed in a standard room which seems a bit small for Mandarin Oriental standards...",4,2013,04,23
44,Not quite a Mandarin - style over substance,"Don't have the patience to write a long review but here are the points;

- Arrived on Good Friday for a long Easter weekend - having booked a flight+hotel BA holiday (business class + 5* hotel)
- Welcome was adequate but had to wait for a room for two hours as we arrived just before midday - so waited in the basement restaurant.
- Room was pretty small and had french windows overlooking the ornamental garden at the rear
- Bathroom's shower cubicle is quite odd in the sense the flooring has a moveable slab of what appears to be marble and quite slippery. 
- Shower ran hot and cold with little consistency in temperature (pressure was more consistent)
- At check-in was asked about newspapers - none delivered
- At around 1600 on Saturday housekeeping staff open and come into room unannounced!
- Water problems in bathroom continued
- Checked out Sunday morning (a day earlier than planned) - used BA Exec club points and returned home (sacrificing the return flights back on Monday as the dates could not be changed)

Pros:
- Great location
- Helpful restaurant staff

Cons
- See above

Would we stay again: NO (this is in marked conrast to a 9-night stay at MO in Hong Kong over Christmas last year - that was absolutely great)",2,2013,04,21
44,Spa experience,"Great Spa experience at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona! I had organized two spa treatments for my best friend's birthday and we were were well looked after at the Spa! Team was great, settings very nicely featured; the atmosphere was great, the pool and steam room were awesome! We were booked in the double cabine and this was a great experience alltogether! Thank you for a great moment of relaxation!",5,2013,04,12
44,The Best Barcelona has to offer.,"Three days in Barcelona with my other half for some R&R, this hotel was chosen by my travel agent so no preconceptions.  We wanted downtown and quality but were cautious as to street noise overlooking as it does P. de Gracia, one of the busiest streets in town.  
It was perfect in every way. Walking distance to the best shops, finest restaurants, moody churches and the old town.  We had a B&B rate (excellent brekky with dim sum!) and a ""deluxe"" room which was modern and very comfortable if a bit on the small side but it served our purposes just fine.  
The MO has its own Michelin restaurant ""Moments"" which we didn't get around to trying as there was just too much else to sample so nearby.  Notably: Ciudad Condal (the very best Tapas in town), Dry Martini/Speakeasy, L'olive, Da Greco all got a sampling with not one disappointment. 
MO manages to combine attentiveness, invisibility, comfort, charm and intelligence in everything it does. We left like old friends; Raphael in the Bankers Bar wrote down his signature cocktail recipe and provided us with a chilled sample in a Perrier bottle as a good-bye gift to take to the airport. How good is that.",5,2013,04,12
44,Great Hotel,"Great hotel, service second to none, rooms could be better designed - lack of towel rails, modern furniture and fixtures a little chipped and showing age if you look carefully.  Staff great however and spoilt us rotton supplying us champagne and cake for my wife's birthday.",4,2013,03,26
44,Excelente luxury choice in Barcelona,"This is the true Mandarin experience - top services, luxury, confort and food! We loved all. The location is perfect, maybe that could be the difference to choose this hotel. The breakfast room is wonderful, starting the day there was a must. Really recommend and hope to be back.",5,2013,03,23
44,"Beauty, Service and all the Jazz!","The building in which the hotel is housed is simply beadthtaking. We made a beeline for the bar on our first night and did not regret staying in. There was live Jazz, beautiful people and lots of great drinks on the menu. Our room was a standard grade but was very respectable. Have always been a fan of the service level of the mandarin oriental group and the one in BCN ranks well. In my opinion, consistently great service can be expected from a stay here.",5,2013,03,21
44,Not up to mandarin oriental standards,"I have stayed at other Mandarin Orientals and this one falls far below the mark.  The location is excellent on Psg de Gracia.  The concierge staff is also great but that's where the excellence ends.  The rooms are tiny, modernistic and uncomfortable.  Beds are hard and there is no place comfortable to sit as the room is so small.  My biggest complaint however was the bathroom!  Bathrooms are awful!  Sliding frosted glass doors that do not close offer no privacy.  Light, sound etc are not blocked by these sliders.   Shower is open so bathroom gets wet.  Single sink and lousy lighting for makeup application etc.   extremely awkward toilet paper dispenser. Magnifying mirror is built into part of the fixed mirror so it can't be adjusted for height or lighting. 

Pool deck is open in march but looks abandoned with no seat cushions out or any amenity so it cannot be enjoyed on a lovely and sunny day.  Spa is not available to guests unless you are purchasing a service.  Single unisex steam room is in basement off of the pool area vs in the spa. Gym is fine though small. 
I just can't recommend this hotel for the price and was disappointed in the level of service.  Turn down did not include even a chocolate at night!  They do provide adapters and nice shampoo, conditioner and body wash.  Buffet breakfast is very good but costs 19euros per person and is exactly the same everyday. Hotel rents out 2 bikes at 30 euros vs every other bike rental place charging 10 euros.  And they charge for wireless Internet as well!  I will never understand why an expensive hotel needs to charge guests extra for Internet when everyone needs or wants it yet inexpensive chain hotels provide it for free.  
Mandarin oriental generally provides top notch service and facilities.  They need to reexamine this property and bring it up to an appropriate standard   ",3,2013,03,19
44,A fine example of outstanding service,"A great location and very nice hotel. Pretty much everything was in walking distance and those that were not were a short taxi ride.
The room was a little on the small side but furnished beautifully, the bathroom took some navigation and it was a little tricky avoiding everything in the room getting wet.
The service was outstanding. Check in was efficient, service in the restaurants friendly and professional. The Concierge service was especially good.",5,2013,03,19
44,Great hotel to explore the city - great service & spa,"Very good hotel near Catanuya Square. All main attractions of Barcelona are withing the walking distance from the hotel - perfect location. Casa Batlla is just over the street.
We had a terrace room with a small balcony - nicely fubished and clean, though a bit small.
Service in the hotel is very good, especially Concierge services: they helped us a lot with our requests and recommended fantastic restaurant around the city.
We visited Spa nearly everyday: very good treatments & staff. Pool is also very good, though it was a bit cold for me.
Breakfast at the hotel is fantastic - very good & wide selection of food, choice of Continental / Buffet or A la Carte Breakfast. Very tasty & good quality of food.
The Michelin starred restaurant in the hotel is really hard to book as it is quite small. But to be honest, it's nothing special. We've been to many Michelin starred restaturants and this one is definately not the best one of them. 
The gastro bar downstairs is very good and easy to book. We liked the food & the tasting menu that they had for dinner. But the signer that was entertaing guests in the evening is awful! She had a bad ear for music and sang terribly:)
To summarize, this is a true luxury hotel in a very good location for the city break.",5,2013,03,14
44,Perfecto!,"Went to barcelona to visit our daughter studying abroad. We have been to many fine hotels around the world but the service we received at the Mandarin was second to none. From the moment we walked through the doors we felt like they really wanted us to enjoy our stay. We arrived in the morning after a long trip from the states and while we were waiting for our room to be ready(not expected at 10am) they invited us to their buffet breakfast at no charge. The concierge was outstanding. Always friendly and helpful. He remembered where we went to dinner and asked us about it the next day.  The waitstaff was extremely friendly. For breakfast they truly wanted to make something special for us even though there was no additional charge for this. When our daughter joined us for a quick breakfast they encouraged her to eat at the buffet and didn't charge us .It's the little things that make a place special. The barista cared enough to remember how we liked our coffee.The bellman were more than just bellman. They took an interest in where we were going and saved us valuable time by suggesting that we get tickets to ""La Sagrada Familia"" at the hotel saving us hours of waiting in line. Of course the location is clearly perfect. The rooms are pleasant and the exercise facilities and indoor pool are a real treat. If you go to Barcelona and want to stay in a hotel where they truly care about their guests, I would suggest staying at the Mandarin.",5,2013,03,08
44,Wonderful place to stay,"We have been staying at Mandarin Oriental 3 times during the last 12 months. In fact it is one of the best hotels in Europe. It is not an ordinary ""old school"" 5 star hotel, it is much more. Attention to details, room design, modern materials, style, service, breakfast - everything is great. Location is fantastic too, but in this case even location is not most important point. It is style, service and attitude. Great place to stay in fantastic city",5,2013,02,23
44,GREAT LOCATION AND GREAT HOTEL,"Stayed at this hotel for 4 days and wish I could have stayed longer.
Near all the high end shops and the hotel was so close to key sites of the city like 2 guadi works which were just up the street 100m.
Hop on hop off bus just across the road and some great cafes and restraunts off the main street .
Staff were excellent and so was conceirge.  All spoke perfect english.  
Hotel has a great spa and swimming pool anmd great terrace view of the city.
Could not fault the place. Great introduction to our first time in barcelona.
As always you get what you pay for.",5,2013,02,06
44,"Great hotel, best location","The hotel is located in the best area of Barcelona, Paseo De Gracia, near all the beautiful stores and easy access to the train and attractions. Very elegant, the spa is amazing and the breakfast room is with lots of open space and natural light. Highly recommended.",5,2013,01,31
44,Perfect Location,"Excellent location, normal service, small rooms.  Standard room is not convenient even for one person. I cannot imagine how couple would move here, it’s almost dangerous. 
And too small table for the breakfast if you are alone. 
And it would be very convenient to have business-centre at the hotel.",4,2013,01,28
44,Minimalist Haven,"It's a posh hotel with extreme attention to detail.
Situated in a perfect location in Passeig da Gracia next to shops and restaurants as well as Casa Battló and La Pedrera.
The rooms are perfectly formed with special mention to the shower room.
Staff is extremely polite and helpful. The concierge gave us great restaurant recommendations.
The Spa area has a beautiful swimming pool and an incredible steam room.
Breakfast is delicious and the Bankers bar is a cool little place too.
All in all it's a great place to ty if money is not an issue.",5,2013,01,26
44,Not really up to MO standards IMHO,"Hi,
We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental last November. The location of the hotel is brilliant, and the hotels facilities are also pretty good, and the staff really are outstanding.
The main problem I found was the room itself. We stayed in a Deluxe Boulevard Room, overlooking the main street outside. No problem with noise from the road, and fortunately we were far enough away from the building work next door that no noise reached our room from there either.
But the rooms are small. Very small. Basically it's a long thin room, with a bathroom off it, and the bathroom didn't have a bath. Call me old fashioned, but if you're staying in a city, you're there for work or a city stay (which will involve walking around a lot). When you get back, you want a bath, not a shower. The shower a huge walk in affair, with a ceiling rose (which had the pressure of a leaking drain pipe) with a hand shower attached, which has the pressure of a fire hose! The towels were pretty poor. Small and not fluffy. If you're staying in a MO you expect huge fluffy towels, not something you'd get given to you at your gym. 
In our room, the ""flush"" above the loo was almost coming out of the wall as well, which was a little disappointing. I'm not purposely being ""picky"", oh actually I am, but if you're spending over €500 per night for a room, you do expect it to be nice.
The rooftop terrace was deserted when we were there. Obviously too cold for most people to swim, but you would of thought people could have had coffee of something up there as the views are great, but alas not.
Oh, one little tip. At night, you click on the master switch to turn out all the lights, to save you running around trying to find the individual switches. Be aware, that also turns off the power sockets, so your iPhone will still have a flat battery in the morning!
We had breakfast in the hotel which was very good, albeit obviously expensive as you'd expect in a 5* hotel. We also tried out the bar, which only stocked Catalan drinks/wines. I know that Barcelona is pretty much independent, but you would have thought that some international wines/beers would be available.
The hotel staff however, were all quite excellent. The hotel is let down by small rooms and poor finishing, which is why I think it's not worthy of 5 stars.",4,2013,01,25
44,Outstanding,"Wow what a fabulous hotel! My husband and I recently stayed 3 nights here and it was faultless. It was my first time in Barcelona and I was very impressed and the hotel made our stay even better.
The service is fabulous, from the moment you arrive at the front. Our bags were whisked away from us and taken to our room without them even asking our name.
The check-in was smooth and friendly and were given a tour of the hotel facilities. The decor is very cool and modern. I loved it.
Concerige were great with restaurant recommendations and bookings.
The location is perfect to base yourself and plenty of places to walk to including many high end shops!
The Blanc brasserie downstairs was a wonderful place to sit of an afternoon and share a bottle of wine and some cheese with a loved one. 
The Bankers Bar at night is very cool and a great way to start or end an evening for cocktails. The bar staff were excellent too.
I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here should I be fortunate to visit Barcelona again.",5,2013,01,21
44,A mini palace with breathtaking views,"Spanish designer Patricia Urquiola has transmuted this into a chic contemporary retro 98-room boutique hotel. Urquiola has carefully chosen the layout and furniture design, the soaring ceilings and the stunning hand-woven carpets, reminiscent of the world’s great classical hotels. All indication of its former banking days are obliterated, with the allowance of the revamped security boxes in the sleek, hip Banker's Bar where Catalan’s élite comes to imbibe the overpriced cocktails.

The hotel’s ninety-eight rooms are breezily decorated with shades of white and subtle oriental touches, which make them feel larger than they are—they are quite small considering the hefty price. Little expense is spared on the extras, from large Asian inspired wall screens and lacquered Chinese boxes to swanky aromatherapy toiletries. There is also a lovely arrival gift of macaroons, fresh fruit and exotic chocolates on arrival. The bathrooms, complete with vast walk-in showers, are adorned with Mutina and Bisazza mosaics conceived as boxes of sparkly, tinted glass.",5,2013,01,18
44,"Second time, still incredible....","For the last two years, we have spent the 26th through the new year at the Mandarin Barcelona.  I wouldn't do Barcelona any other way.  The service is spot on.  From the valet, to the front desk, the concierge, room service, housekeeping, spa, etc. etc.  You get what I mean.  Everyone in this hotel has been fully trained in the true meaning of customer service.  I had one problem with turn down for a couple of days and mentioned it to the front desk.  The problem was fixed.  Housekeeping sent me truffles for my troubles and everything was back to normal.  I will probably be in Barcelona again this summer and of course, the Mandarin it will be.",5,2013,01,07
44,"Service, service, service","But that isn't all. The hotel is a perfect blend of old and new, just like Barcelona. Built inside a former bank, the spaces are contemporary without trying too hard. The restaurant, Moments, earns its 3-Michelin stars (the only such rating for a female chef). The staff is incredibly helpful - you always know they are there to help, and they stop short of being intrusive. Every need was met (including advance requests made by email when the butler/concierge staff reached out several days before our arrival). There is construction next door, which looks to be nearly finished, but the MO is built solidly so it was not a problem even though our room directly neighbors the site. The pool and gym are perfectly sized and we had them to ourselves. This is the fifth Mandarin Oriental we've stayed at, and while all of them have among the best hotel staffs of any top-rated hotel, Barcelona will always make me smile for the people who work here. A side note: some ""fancy"" hotels are snobbish about families and kids, but our 8-yr old was made as welcome as any other guest.",5,2013,01,04
44,Superb location!,"This was my first experience staying in a MO and I can definitely say that it's a really nice hotel. It's up there in service with Four Seasons. The staff were always cheerful and helpful, the room was very nice and comfortable, and the only negative was that there was construction going on next door that started at 8 am and was very noisy. We had a garden terrace room and the view was unattractive and we were right above the kitchen trash, so we kept hearing the staff throwing bottles in the recycling receptacles. We asked to be moved and the next day a different room became available and they cheerfully helped us move. So kudos to their attentiveness. We stayed 5 nights and truly, this hotel is the best location out of all the hotels. it's right in the midst of all the greatest shopping, Tapas restaurants, and attractions, or a short cab ride away. It is also a very safe part of Barcelona. We had a super early flight home on January 1 so we had the hotel schedule a cab for us at 5:30 am. The doorman obviously knew the cab driver because when we went out to get into our cab we were getting in a cab and he came running out and steered us to a different taxi. We saw the cab driver give the doorman some Euros as we were getting into the cab. Sadly, it ended up being the cab ride from hell! The cab driver was texting on his phone the entire ride to the airport, swerving all over the road, and we were terrified. When I asked him to stop texting, he became aggressive and started screaming at us. He ended up manually pushing up the meter by about 10 Euros and forced us to overpay or he wouldn't give us our luggage. When I called the hotel from the airport, the manager, David, acted concerned but didn't do anything about the doorman's knowledge of this cab driver. He simply apologized for the ordeal. I realize it wasn't the hotel that was responsible but clearly their doorman knew this cab driver. If they book you a taxi, specify that you want a SAFE driver.",4,2013,01,04
44,Perfect location to explore Barcelona by foot,"We couldn't have asked for a better place to launch our re-exploration of Barcelona. Having been away for over 20 years, there was lots to do. The Mandarin gave us the opportunity to have a sanctuary as our home. The staff is superb. There are so many to thank, but I will start with Francisco, Simon, and Carlos at the Concierge. Natalia and Paula at breakfast. Our wonderful housekeeping staff, who after repeatedly leaving money for them without them taking it...we had to leave a note with directions that it was for them. The location is brilliant, especially if you like shopping...and high end shopping. Every luxury store is within walking distance; most are across the street, around the corner, or just next to the front desk. However, to keep things in perspective, some hints for those who have special problems with noise. The floors of the rooms are wood, with a cover rug. This leaves enough space to hear your neighbors getting ready to go out...or come back home at odd hours. The street side rooms, which the front desk considers an upgrade or lovely for the view, but occasional sirens through the night shatter that illusion. If you can wear ear plugs comfortably through the night, bring them. Other than that, this was a fantastic spot. We are looking forward to our next trip.",4,2013,01,02
44,Look no Further,"I've been traveling regularly to Barcelona for about 25 years now so I've stayed in quite a few hotels in the city. Although it's expensive, I'd say the Mandarin Oriental is the best. The rooms are  well thought out with attention to deal that other hotels could learn from. The lights are easy to use and there are reading lights by the bed as well as night lights. There is a special closet just for empty suitcases. The service is good, the restaurant recommendations from the concierge were excellent. The pool was in the basement and so a bit dark but was of a decent size. The location is convenient. We didn't try the hotel restaurants although these have had good reviews but the breakfast was good despite a long wait for cappucino most mornings. I'd love to stay here again.",5,2012,12,15
44,Fantastic experience!,"This is the first time staying at a Mandarin Oriental hotel,  which is why anytime I need a Five Star hotel it will be with the Mandarin Oriental chain.   My wife and I were very impressed with the all of the staff,  always there to help you and so knowledgable.  Staff in restaurant were there for you if you even thought of something you needed.  Dining was out of this world, as well as the decor in rooms and hotel.  We stayed there 4 days and traveled north but altering our plans to go back and stay our last 2 days.  We could mention names of special staff but would not because we'd leave someone out,  what training by management.  Beautiful hotel in a great shopping area in a  great city.
JC, Gainesville, Florida",5,2012,12,04
44,Fabulous service!,"Great location, great service, great design. Just a shame that the double glazed windows don't seem to work. I stay in a boulevard side room and the window might as well have been open the noise was the same. Strange that a hotel that was quite recently built wouldn't use triple glazed window as the noise from the traffic is quite bad! 

On another note Moments restaurant is fantastic. As are the concierge, every recommendation was perfect, just what we had asked for. All the staff were very friendly. Breakfast was also really good, really good Buffett and perfect cooked breakfast. I've stayed in a few MO hotels, Barcelona certainly has the best chefs and friendliest staff. ",4,2012,12,03
44,Good Choice In Barcelona,"Stayed for only 1 night in July, 2012.

I was pleased with this hotel choice.  Of the several top-end options in Barcelona, the MO seems to be the clear winner if you want to be in the city (as opposed to being at or near the beach area.

The MO is situated right in the prime area on Passeig de Gracia, which is a huge asset.  It is in the midst of all sorts of great shopping, restaurants and one fo the Gaudi houses.  The location can't be beat.

The hotel is VERY contemporary, but well done (as compared, for e.g. a 'W', which generally feel cheap and Ikea-like to me).  Out room was spacious and well appointed.  Cocktail serviceright to the room was complimentary with our suite...a nice touch.  The staff at the Concierge desk is very good. Suites also have butler service, which was quite helpful.  We only ate breakfast at the hotel, and I have no complaints there.

the roof top pool deserves special mention.  It is small, but designed in a very cool, contemporary, out-door space with very cool city views looking out beyond a gorgeous rooftop pool.  Very nice spot.

My only complaint with the the MO is that the views to ""the garden"" are not all that desirable.  Basically you are overlooking the outdoor space in the back of the hotel, which includes a somewhat unattractive collection of the backs of buildings.  It's not terrible, but not a beautiful view to look at either.",4,2012,12,03
44,Perfect location,"This property is about location, location, location.  There are building works now in November in the building next door, so ask when you check-in for a quiet room if that is of concern to you.  The spa needs a refit in the pool area (or a good clean).  Rooms to international standard and comfortable.  Streetside rooms can be very noisy also at nighttime so ask for a garden room.",4,2012,11,30
44,I second a prior reviewer - An Expensive Disappointment,I was excited to stay at this hotel.  Then I arrived.  We were met by a strangely rude front desk - possibly the rudest I have ever encountered.  The room looked (to me) like a W (at MO prices). I found the view from our terrace depressing. We had just come from the club floor at the Hotel Arts -- where I will happily stay the next time I am in lovely Barcelona.  Note: their signature restaurant is open for a little more than 2/3 of the week.,2,2012,11,29
44,Amazing...,"Great hotel, great restaurant ""Le Blanc"", great spa where I surprised to find a PEDI:MANI:CURE Studio by Bastien Gonzalez ! a pedicure and a massage with a french podiatrist ... fantastic...
A beautiful hotel in the heart of the city, good location,  ...

Hope come back soon !!",5,2012,11,28
44,They know service,"Great staff and atmosphere!    yes pricey 
Hotel however these folks are friendly, knowledgeable, honest and
Have excellent follow up skills!
Food and atmosphere outstanding!
We trusted their opinions and were never 
Disappointed!",5,2012,11,25
44,expensive disappointment,"Despite several calls and emails ahead of time with the concierge, nothing was arranged property for our arrival - only partial details were given for tickets we bought and so we ended up having to purchase twice.     We were greeted on arrival by our ""butler"" - a morrocan lady who spent 5mins at the lift talking to some morrocan guests whilst we waited for her to show us to our room.    She then told us how she was there to help with everything so we asked for a small bathrobe and a dinner reservation at the hotel for the next night.    The next day we asked again for the bathrobe and enquired about our dinner reservation - robe never showed up and finally i called housekeeping who brought it immediately (2 requests to the butler and 1 to the conceirge who was going to remind the butler achieved nothing).....and the dinner reservation had just been forgotten and there were no tables left.     Then we tried the spa - i requested a pedicure, they booked me in for their very expensive special pedicure......the guy cut my toe but tried to cover it over (10 days lady i still have a wound under my nail) and he filed my nails so they all broke and cracked the next day, without doubt the worst pedicure i have ever had.    i have regular pedicures and my feet and nails are in good condition - when i saw my regular spa the following week they were shocked at what had been done.    Interestingly when i arrived i was asked to fill out a form about this special pedicure and there was a section left to complete after the treatment to say whether or not it had met your expectations......i was never asked to complete this piece when mine was finished!     We had the sunday brunch and breakfast - at both the food was poor and you had to wait ages for them to re-fill things.     Expensive for the selection and quantity.      Overall it was just incredibly disappointing for the price and not what i normally expect from a Mandarin Oriental",2,2012,11,23
44,Wonderful Stay in Barcelona,The Mandarin Oriental is one of two full service luxury hotels in Barcelona.  The other hotel being the Hotel Arts.  The Mandarin's location is exceptional (walking distance from most everything in the city) and the architecture/interiors are spectacular.  The rooms are appointed beautifully and with a very contemporary vibe.  What makes the Mandarin in Barcelona so special is the outgoing and kind staff.  They will do anything to meet your every need.  No hotel in Barcelona is a close second to the MO.,5,2012,11,19
44,Great staff - cramped room,"The staff are amazing from concierge to doorman (Alberto) with a great location. the rooms are fine and the shower is amazing. I hate the toilet. When your bags are in the room, it resembles a jumble sale. ",4,2012,11,12
44,"""Outstanding""","We had a great stay in Barcelona and the superb service in the Oriental has completed the stay.  Not only is the staff polite and always have a natural smile for you, they also really care and remember things you tell them. This is not unusual for Asian Luxury Hotels but here in Europe we have rarely received such an outstanding service.",5,2012,11,11
44,Excellent,A very foot hotel. Top service. I was a bit nervous about going with my 6 year old as I've never stayed at this chain of hotels before. The staff made us very welcome and gave my daughter lots of attention. The concierge was a great help. We chose a junior suite as it has a kind of separate bit with a separate bed. You get a butler on suite level and the lady was superb.,5,2012,11,06
44,Amazing service when we got stuck in Spain because of Hurricane Sandy,"The Mandarin Oriental has a well deserved reputation for phenomenal service.  Our plane was canceled about 12 hours before we were supposed to go to the airport and we had to stay in Spain for another 2.5 days.  

I was pretty upset and worried about when we would get back.  So the concierge's desk called the airline, stayed on hold for 2 hours and helped us re-book the best flight we could get.  Then when we wanted to go to Madrid with the extra time, they booked us the transportation, a room at a modestly priced hotel in Madrid and held a room for us in Barcelona for the night before our new flight went out. When we arrived back late the night before leaving, we had a very warn welcome for the staff, and our bags were already in our rooms. (We had taken just small shoulder bags and left most of the luggage at the hotel.)  

And besides that, this is a pretty new hotel, right in the middle of everything in Barcelona -- and easy walking or short cab distance from all the major sites.  

We loved the place even before they helped out with our issues.

It is very expensive, but worth the price to us.",5,2012,11,05
44,Excellent hotel with excellent service minded staff,"stayed there first week early august . After a few (english language) dificulties in making myself understood during booking , turned out to be an excellent experience.
Very well located in the centre of town on passeig de gracia.
Suites benefit of the service of a butler who proved very full of attention in satisfying our queries of all kinds.
Excellent concierge desk also to help us find our way.
Also very good quality of equipment in the  hotel and nice spa but staff service mindedness was really great.",5,2012,11,04
44,Tasty Hotel with a bitter aftertaste,"Superb location, very tasty decoration, best staff I've stayed with, but for 600 Eur/Night, the smallest and crampiest room I had to stay in, except for the Greek jailhouse back in Mytilini.

Bear in mind that there is a noisy construction going on right next-door for at least another year. Ask for a room facing the front facade (Pg. Gracia), much less noise that way.",4,2012,10,27
44,Great Staff,"I stayed here a while back and loved it. I went back and it was just as great. The service and location as well as the concierge (who sorted me out with a barca ticket when I told them how badly I wanted to see the one and only Messi). All in all, fantastic.",4,2012,10,25
44,Effortless style,What a delightful hotel! Beautiful building in fantastic location to access the very best of Barcelona. Theatrical entrance and a lovely blend of new and old architecture. Impeccable service with a special mention to Maria on the front desk and the concierge who offered excellent advice all the way down to the recommendation of an espresso cocktail in the Dry Martini bar. The highlight was an afternoon sunbathing (in October!!) on the roof top with the occasional dip in the roof top pool and rounded off with a beautiful lunch on the sun beds!,5,2012,10,17
44,hellasview,"We have been to many luxurius hotels up to now , however what makes this one unique is first of all the exchellent service! Very polite , helpful and always smiling staff indeed!And not just some of them , all of them! They give you the impression that they really enjoy their job and that each one of them is very carefully selcted to ensure customer satisfaction.As per the hotel itslef : The location is ideal for all the City sighntseeing as well as shopping areas. Few minutes walk fom City Center ( La Rampbla etc).We enjoyed the minimal style the rooms were decorated with and the cool atmosphere - it has a calming light aroma all over the floors as well as very delicate lighting selections ( in the rooms and all over the hotel). The selections for the mini bar were excellent and tempting :) , outside the normal beverages and drinks most of the hotels have to offer. The hotel bars offer very good coctails as well. The bathroom design was something to remember as ideal.The sleeping material are made of very soft linen and adding the automatic windows and temperature makes your sleep very conforting. An overall excellent experience that is highly recomennded.",5,2012,10,16
44,"Impeccable Service at the Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona","We just came back from our anniversary trip, staying at the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona.  We had a beautiful junior suite with a sizeable balcony that faced Gaudi's Casa Batllo on Passeig de Gracia.  Upon arrival, we were treated to Cava, fresh fruit and chocolates.  There was a bottle of wine also.  Roses were strewn on our bed at night.  On actual anniv, this was replicated.  Our butler Brendan was very pleasant and accomodating.  Concierge was most personable. The doormen were friendly. Amazing bathroom with generous toiletries. Everything was faultless and worth every euro spent.  And the restaurant MOMENTS is one of the best restaurants we've been to.   Impeccable service all in all.  Looking fwd to a re-visit.",5,2012,10,10
44,Elegant Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,"The minute you get out of your car, you are greeted by the very friendly doormen, you step on the thick and plush carpet that leads you towards the main doors, and upon entry you are hit by the smell of Ginger and Spice that permeates the entire hotel.

We had arrived at 1:30pm but our rooms were not ready. So we went to the outdoor bar, which was huge, but empty. Very attentive and friendly young staff, quick on their feet, who saw to our every need. The bar closes at 10pm because the neighbours complain about the noise, which was a shame. A lot of good tips from Delfin, for bars and clubs so Thanks for that.

Our rooms were finally ready by 5pm (!), and we received one round for free, but we were somewhat damaged by then. However all forgiven as my room was beautiful, very well laid out, bright, with an extremely comfortable bed. I loved the bathroom, all black and white granite, large mirrors with an amazing all black shower room that was open to the white bath. Very nice indeed. Toiletries were also great, right from the spa.

We had breakfast in the very spacious and beautifully laid out basement cafe, that had plush sofas for seating, excellent service, and great food.

The concierge service is also excellent. The staff here made great recommendations, effortless reservations, with a courtesy that made it all very pleasant.

The construction next door makes sitting outside a bit disturbing, but it is very quiet in the rooms and indoors.
 
All in all, a great boutique feel to the hotel, in the heart of the uppity shopping district, with everything no more than a 10 minute walk away, and service that sets the benchmark for other 5 star establishments.",5,2012,10,06
44,A piece of heaven...best hotel experience ever,"Amazing service staffed by people who openly acknowledge how much they enjoy their jobs.   Beautifully appointed and comfortable, spotless rooms with a fabulous rain shower and deep soaking tub.   The restaurants were all lovely including the rooftop deck overlooking Barcelona.  I have bad allergies and only had to mention once and meal were adjusted to accommodate (fresh gluten-free pastries and breads warm each morning, soy milk for coffee, custom tapas).   It was our anniversary and they provided a delicious bottle of cava and desserts in our room on arrival. Spa services were superb but a bit pricey.  The location is central and concierge is extremely helpful.",5,2012,10,06
44,A Top-Notch Stay!,"We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for one night before departing on our Mediterranean Cruise.  We flew from the US & arrived in Barcelona at 9:30 AM the next day.  I arranged with the Concierge for their driver  to meet us at the airport & transport us to the Hotel.  The driver was waiting for us at baggage claim.  We were whisked to the Hotel & immediately met by the Hotel Staff.  We were brought straight up to our room, no need to stop at the Hotel desk & within a few minutes we were able to relax after our long flight.  The room was very comfortable, a bit small, similar to what you would see at a New York City Hotel but had every amenity available.  The bathroom was outrageous & there were various controls on the remote to adjust the lights & blinds.  We visited the rooftop pool, that was great, a lovely view & we were able to get a bite to eat.  The concierge also recommended a great restaurant for dinner & gave excellent directions for us to walk to.
All in all, the Mandarin Oriental was a great experience, even if for only a one night stay!  We can't wait to go back!",5,2012,10,05
44,Shouldn't be a Mandarin,"The Barcelona property shouldn't be a Mandarin hotel.   The rooms are too small, the gym area is terrible, the rooftop area where they advertise drinks and service is abandoned.   They failed to put laundry items in our room for 3 days in a row.    There is a high rise building being built next door and there is constant construction noise.  When there isn't construction noise there is noise from the school playground either from the kids during the day or adults playing basketball at night.

The staff are excellent but management is obviously lacking as was the Mandarin group's decision to build the hotel on this property.  I love Mandarin hotels - the ones in London, Hong Kong, Macau and Prague locations are all spectacular in every way.

The one good point is that like every Mandarin the core staff are very pleasant and they do try their best but nothing can make up for the properties basic shortcomings.",2,2012,09,28
44,First Class!,"From the moment you walk into this beautiful property, you are treated like loyalty. They are professional, warm and super friendly! The hotel is two years old, it's maintained so well, the decor and installations are beautiful. 
This hotel is run by people who love their job. They are not there because they have to, they are there because they want to be there. The rooms are beautiful, clean and charming. The level of attention to each guests needs is superb. They have an amazing roof top area with amazing views of Barcelona with a dipping pool and great staff. The breakfast are very good, our room was booked through our travel agent which came with full breakfast. You have an option of both the buffet and ordering a la cart. The Mimosa garden restaurant in the hotel is a beautiful interior garden with great food, an amazing manger, Ramon Safer and a great wine expert, David Soler. They go out of their way to make sure your lunch or dinner is exactly what you want. They both make your experience so wonderful. We tried lunch at  the Blanc, where they served breakfast in the morning, it sure was not as good as Mimosa. Blanc is great for breakfasts.The Banker's bar was very nice with great staff, they have live bands at some nights. Ask the concierge, they will give you all the information about their live bands, we got to see an amazing Cuban band during our stay which was an amazing experience. The spa is magical and takes to another world. We were lucky to be able to check out from Ohla hotel to stay at the Mandarin Oriental, which was the first place we wanted to stay. But since Mandarin had no availability on the first night of our stay, we had to go stay at Ohla for one night. Please read my other review about Ohla. My husband and I highly recommend this hotel, the only downside about this hotel was there were no restrooms at the roof top and if you needed to use the restrooms, you had to go to your room or to go to the spa other than that, everything was just perfect.",5,2012,09,26
44,First Class,Lovely hotel with wonderful service. Arrived early after all night flight and were given room early. Lovely amenities with spacious room and and fantastic showers.   Hotel is on busy street but very quiet and serene once you enter.  Concierge and front desk very helpful.  We were leaving late afternoon for cruise and they extended our checkout .  You will not be disappointed.,5,2012,09,24
44,Amazing service and food,"On this occasion we were not able to stay at this beautiful hotel, however, we did visit the Banker's Bar one evening and then have a meal in the Blanc restaurant the following night.  In both locations the staff were absolutely brilliant, attentive and friendly.  The cocktails were a real treat and the choice and quality of the food in the restaurant totally perfect - and all served by lovely people in great surroundings.  Very special.",5,2012,09,24
44,Top notch,"My husband and I were treated like royalty at this fine hotel. We were upgraded to a beautiful room with a balcony and butler service. What a pleasure. The hotel is modern but comfortable.  The staff as warm and professional as they come. The location is central to many sights, including two Gaudi homes. The hotel manager was warm and sincere about making our stay a great experience and he succeeded.",5,2012,09,22
44,Superb ...,"My wife and I had the pleasure of spending 6 nights in mid-September at the Mandarin Oriental. We were absolutely pleased with every aspect of the hotel and staff.

First, and foremost, is service:  Every single employee, from busboys to management, went out of their way to make certain that our stay was perfect.  Special kudos to the efficient and friendly concierges, doormen and room service crew. Every employee we encountered made an effort to learn our names and address us by our names during our stay.  All spoke English, most of them fluently.

We had a room with a terrace, which was quite pleasant -- the rooms are not especially large, so having an open-air spot to enjoy coffee or breakfast or a cold drink was a bonus.  The rooms are appointed with every possible amenity ... wine glasses, an electric-plug converter, fully stocked mini-fridge, excellent high-speed wi-fi, lighted wardrobe ...  you name it.

One note:  While we enjoyed the terrace, unsuspecting tourists should be aware that the hotel is in the heart of a working city and the views on the terrace reflect that.  The view below of the garden restaurant was pleasing, but the rear of the adjacent buildings revealed Spaniards going about their daily lives -- hanging out laundry, tending their plants, etc.  Didn't bother us, tho might turn off some folks.  But it's a city, after all, and not Disneyland.

My wife enjoyed the spa and workout facility on several occasions, rated them as 5-star in ambience and service.

The Moments restaurant, with its Michelin star, is well-known an lives up to its reputation.  However, in value-for-your-money, the Blanc restaurant cannot be beat.  The food was excellent and the service even better than at Moments.  This little-discussed restaurant is a treasure.  We also enjoyed a leisurely outdoor lunch at the Mimosa Garden restaurant -- again, good food and superb service.

The Mandarin is perfectly located for seeing the city, with easy access to all modes of transportation and very good restaurant nearby. Yes, it is expensive -- but they earn it.  Couldn't have been happier.",5,2012,09,19
44,Elegant hotel with professional service,"We like to stay with Mandarin Oriental hotels when traveling in Asia. Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is our first experience with the MO in Europe. The best thing about this hotel is the attentive professional staff team that treats every guest equally. As Asian traveler, I have experienced less than perfect service from luxurious hotel in Europe but Mandarin Oriental Barcelona staff are very professionally trained and well managed.",4,2012,09,18
44,One of the best hotels worldwide,"there is no better hotel to stay in Barcelona than Mandarin oriental
very proffestional and freindly staff almost in all the hotel, except the concierge don't rely on them heavily.
Rooms are wonderful with lovely bathroom and shower. The hotel managment were very kind with us in our stay they automaticaly gave us a discount during our stay as we stayed in it for about 14 days.
Location is very good at the Passige de Gracia great shopping area not far from La Ramblas
 just infront of gaudi building thing.",5,2012,09,18
44,I'm glad I chose the Mandarin,"Located in the heart of Eixample, the Mandarin Oriental is a fantastic, luxury hotel.

The Mandarin is a perfect place to stay if you are interested in great restaurants, great shopping, and Gaudi architecture (Casa Batllo is just a skip from the hotel).

The service is top-notch.  The rooms are average size, but very stylish.  The bathrooms are SPA quality -- fantastic!

Blanc is a great restaurant -- we ate three meals here during our stay.  The food is delicious, prepared flawlessly.  Menu included a wide variety, but even the more pedestrian entrees were special -- the burgers came with fioe gras.

The Banker's bar is gorgeous.  The decor is inventive, with stainless-steel safety-deposit-boxes lining the walls and ceiling, shiny keys sticking out of each lock).  It's worth it to have a pre-dinner drink.

One hiccup -- our room was not ready when we arrived, so we chose to have lunch at Blanc.  We ended up sitting in Blanc for more than 2 hours while they got our room ready.  That said, they filled us with Reserve Cava, declicious food, beautiful truffles for dessert -- more Reserve Cava....all luxurious and worth it.  The service was excellent.

Much of the meal was free since we had to wait so long -- so that was a nice gesture.  

All in all -- one of the best hotels.",5,2012,09,17
44,Delightful hotel.,"I always love Mandarin Oriental hotels but they are most spectacular in Asian countries. However this property did a respectable job living up to the Mandarin magic. We switched rooms after we saw our double room which had no bathtub. After the prompt switch to a lower floor room (which actually had nicer views of the Passeig de Gracia) we fell in love with the room with it's large tub (necessary for the long soaks after 5 hours of walking each day to see the city!). The rooftop ""plunge"" pool had a beautiful view of the city. The Bankers Bar was a nice spot for a cocktail to start the evening. We also enjoyed the outdoor courtyard bistro for a late lunch. The pictures are worth at least a thousand words.",5,2012,09,16
44,Don't do it!! Read the reviews!!,"I was planning my partners 50th b'day and wanted to stay somewhere really special....i spent ages reading reviews on Trip Advisor and despite reading mixed reviews i decided on Mandarin Oriental. My logic was that people who wrote bad reviews generally moan about the smallest of things......i wish i had listened.

Ok so lets start with the positives nice location, rooms although a little small for the price they are well appointed, concierge lovely, service from maids and porters is great!

Negatives- told the hotel it was my partners 50th and they said they would make it really special- we arrived and checked in and received no drink and were definitely not made to feel special. Everything is ridiculously expensive so only stay here if you have bottomless pockets of money to spend. 
Noise next door is a pain when sitting on balcony or indeed on  rooftop- not normally fussy but when you pay such a lot for these nice hotel features it does make you think twice about whether its worth it when everything is so noisy and dusty!!

The WORST thing this hotel is guilty of is not making guests aware of their ludicrous policy to take not only the money for hotel room but also an additional 200 euros per night!! I returned to UK to find my bank account empty, i was told of this policy after i phoned them to query why all my money in my bank had gone. I was repeatedly told it was hotel policy and i would get the money back within 1-2 weeks- not good enough!!! Had i been made aware of this before i would have stayed elsewhere. I have stayed in many top hotels and never had an issue like this before, normally having your credit card details is enough!!

In my opinion the hotel could be better and i do not think it was worth what i paid for, we passed many other hotels in Barcalona which looked equally nice but for half the price. I have been left with a bitter taste in my mouth and not been offered an apology or any compensation despite the hotel making interest on my money- meanwhile i am living off money borrowed!!!!

READ THESE REVIEWS- I WISH I HAD",2,2012,09,11
44,spotless,"finishing up four night stay in BCN and really enjoyed our time.The hotel is new and smells/looks it.
Very polite and efficient check in.Initially given room with shower only so we requested a room with tub.The switch was quickly made with fruit and chocolates waiting for us.
We had chosen a room on the street side.We preferred the outside view of the street and the beautiful buildings.I believe the courtyard side isnt as nice and might be noisy due to recent construction.
Concierge was very helpful with restaurants and tour tips.
Special thanks to Carlos Martin for calling all our restaurant picks.
Housekeeping was great and room service prompt.
Everyone spoke English-our Spanish is limited at best.
Location if perfect for us between waterfront (30minwalk) Gothic area (20min) Eixample (10 min)
El Raval (20 min) and Plaza Cataluna with all tourist buses (10 min)
Hotel surrounded by great shops ,bars and restaurants.
Rooms are spacious including huge tub and rainshower.Lighting of the room was sublime.
Glad we stayed here-our third BCN visit first at the hotel.
If you want centrally located luxury then this is great choice-and money isnt an issue as it can be quite pricey.
If you need more water/beach vacation the I would consider the big W hotel with its huge pool and wonderful water views.Location though is far from all the sights.
We enjoyed Cerveceria Catalana,Paco Meralgo,Cafe De L'Academia,Pla,Boca Grande,El Xampanet for lunch and dinners.",5,2012,09,09
44,"Nice rooms with impeccable service, spa and location.","Stayed there for 8 days and was heartbroken to leave. The hotel's location is perfect, right next to shopping, restaurants and sightseeing. The rooms are nice but may have minor drawbacks. I complained about mine and they bent themselves over to satisfy me, even did the move for me. The level of service is beyond perfect, they will try to do anything you ask for. and genuinely nice people. Concierge and spa are great too. I am definitely going back, and staying there again.",5,2012,09,08

44,Very poor....well below expectations! Beware building works ongoing!,"I booked this hotel for a 3 night stay because i though i would get great service in nice surroundings...mandarin are usually pretty reliable....HOWEVER...my stay was plagued with issues!

Firstly they have a big construction site next to the hotel....fair enough out of their control but at NO TIME do they make you aware of this when booking. The first day a trip hammer that shook our hotel room was going for hours incessantly. I complained as we were on the side close to the building works ...however they said they were full....and couldn't change our room but did acknowledge it was a big issue! they gave me a discount on the first night but that wasn't the point....it ruined our first impressions and stay in Barcelona! Basically we had a room that we couldn't bear to be in during the day! It was a mid price room too over 500 Euros a night with a balcony that looked down into the building site below! The blurb says it has views of attractive gardens but i would say the outlook isn't attractive at all even if there wasn't a building site.....you look at the back of loads of grotty buildings. Also note that you look at a big tower crane from the rooftop pool and terrace while construction is ongoing next door. 

Secondly...as it was a romantic break i ordered at the time of reservation (as i was prompted too) some champagne for when we arrived in the room......it never appeared...when i asked why it hadn't been delivered they didnt give a monkeys! Very poor to get such a basic request wrong....especially when they ask you at point of reservation.

Breakfast was terrible...basically 39euros each....but the buffet was 75% empty with no urgency to replace any items that had run out!...there orange juice machine ran out for about 30 minutes! AGAIN very average and not what i would expect. 

Rooms are ok..nice design but ours was a little tatty around the edges. 

Concierge were excellent, knowledgeable and helpful.

To top of the bad experience despite paying in full when we checked out my bank have now informed me that Mandarin Oriental have left a reservation on a further 2,000 euros on my account! PLEASE GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER MANDARIN AND TO DATE THIS IS STILL NOT SORTED.

I would recommend the Arts hotel or the W hotel by a mile over this. stayed at both and no comparison. Barcelona has some great hotels but this isn't one of them!",2,2012,09,06
44,The Best Hotel in the center of Barcelona,"This Mandarin is at the top! Small yet with every amenity and superb personal service. Everything seems to be anticipated by the staff. The rooms have terraces that make you feel like you are a longtime resident. The bathroom, bathtub and shower seem designed for every need.",5,2012,08,31
44,EXCELLENT HOTEL IN A GREAT CITY,"Stayed August 2012 for 4 nights on a city break.  The hotel is perfectly located in the city with shops and attractions all within walking distance.  There was considerable construction work going on next door when we there but I can honestly say that it didn't impact on our stay in any way even though we had a deluxe boulevard room.

Staff at MOHG are always polite, courteous and helpful.  A nice touch is that they always rremember your name and address you by it during your stay.  The breakfast service was superb as was the food.  We also tried a special tasting menu in the restaurant on our last evening and this was fabulous and good value.  Note however that the Moments Restaurant (rated very highly in Barcelona) is shut due to upgrade work being carried on.  The Bankers bar is another highlight as is the rooftop bar after a day walking around the City.  We used the dipping pool on the roof one afternoon and whilst only a small facility, the service and views were great.  

At check-in we were offered a €50 daily credit for the Spa but didn't use it as we wanted to enjoy the weather and the City.  When I came to settle the bill this had been converted to a credit against our room rate each night which was welcome as the hotel is not cheap. What you do get however is a first rate experience and on this basis it has to be considered value for money.

I would recommend.",5,2012,08,29
44,Very Good but needs some work,"The hotel is very good.  Some service items keep it from being excellent.  For example, it took two hours to get the bags sent up to our rooms after arrival.  Turn down service is unreliable.  At the restaurant, particularly at breakfast, service is slow and on one occasion they charged us for something they forgot to bring.  They did correct the mistake however.  The Concierge is helpful and the team is trying. The rooms are great and the location ideal to tour Barcelona. Good for families as well.",4,2012,08,23
44,Loved it!,"We stayed in the Mandarin Oriental for 1 week. We had ordered a car to pick us up from the airport (Mercedes S and BMW 7) and the chauffeur service was as it should be - quiet and efficient! From the moment we stepped out of the car till the moment we entered the limo for departure we felt that they really cared about us. The service was extremely friendly and unique. The room was modern, clean, had everything it should have. Small disappointment was that some of the TV channels were not visible all the time (connection problem with the sat?). Also the bathroom could have had more hooks to hang towels and cloths. The food (breakfast, lunch and dinner) were really good. The Michelin star restaurant was a nice experience even I have to admit that downstairs (outside in the backyard) the Mimosa restaurant had maybe the best ""hamburgers"" I have had for a long time (not the normal style you would expect - just try it!). Wifi is available but having been in several 5 star Hotels I think it should be free for the guests. Concierge service again was top perfect!",5,2012,08,17
44,the best hotel in europe,"Until I visted this hotel I believes that no hotel in Europe would be able to provide me the serivce that I get at the hotels in the Far East. This hotel shattered that belief. The concerige were the most helpfull bunch of people that I have ever met. The interiors of the room was very modern like the hotel. The serivce was superb. It is pricey but you get your monies worth. The rooms were a little small but that is understandable considering that the location was the best in Baraclona. Very central.

When I am back I will only stay here. There was some construction in a building next door but this started well after 9 am and was done before 6pm. It will only bother you if you like to slee in late.",5,2012,08,15
44,SHANG RA LA  IN BARCELONA,"The very Best Hotel in the very Best Location.The price seemed correct for all that they offer you.
We had a great large soaking tub and a separate water fall shower.
The whole experience had a very Zen type feeling.The Blanc Restaurant was awesome and the rooms come with a terrific buffet.  
The staff was one of the best we experienced through out europe.",5,2012,08,13
44,Outstanding Experience Top to Bottom,"In a great location, this was an outstanding experience all the way from an amazing rooftop with a splendid view and a magnificent lap pool, to both a superb dining and bar experience, right on down to a terrific spa and gym facility below.  Our room was comfortable and well appointed.  The service offered by the staff was top notch. Special acknowledgement is due Nathan, the rooftop attendant during our stay, whose attention to service exemplified the outstanding treatment guests experience from the staff of this fine hotel. Though during our stay there was some ongoing construction next to the Mandarin Oriental, it hardly affected the quality and comfort of our stay. This speaks volumes of the quietness of the rooms as well as the pleasant distraction of so many other great aspects of the Mandarin Oriental amenities.   We plan to go back again. We've always loved Barcelona. The Mandarin is just one more thing to love about it. There are many fine restaurants to experience in Barcelona, but one should be sure to experience ""Blanc.""  Unfortunately the Michelin Star restaurant ""Moments"" was closed for August. Nevertheless ""Blanc"" pulled up the slack for us in that department.  The Mimosa Garden Bar and Banker's Bar are also very good options right in the hotel. We both fully enjoyed our Mandarin Oriental Barcelona experience and would highly recommend this hotel to others. We will be back and looking forward to trying out ""Moments"" when we do.",5,2012,08,12
44,A tale of two hotels,"As far as the staff are concerned this is exactly what a Mandarin should be - everyone was helpful, pleasant, and polite.The rooms on the other hand were a great disappointment and really didn't live up to the standard of Mandarins around the world. I had booked a deluxe room and it was anything but deluxe. Not very big, a tiny window that you had to stand on tiptoes to look out of and a shower and no bath. I wasn't remotely happy but to give the staff their due, they listened to my complaints, especially about why there was only a shower and no bath when this wasn't made clear on the booking , and showed me another room that was available. It wasn't much better but at least it had a bigger window which made you feel as tho you weren't sleeping in a prison cell. The next day they offered a better room.So there is no doubt the staff and that is  everyone from the checkin  staff to the manager could not have been more helpful throughout our stay. They deserve five stars and more. The rooms most certainty don't.",4,2012,08,11
44,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"Great location on Passeig de Gracia, outstanding staff and service. Hotel Arts and W are very large properties on the water, and you must take a cab to go anywhere. Mandarin Oriental is walking distance to many sights, shopping, and popular restaurants.",5,2012,08,10
44,Gorgeous location,"We stayed here in early August, which is when vacations start in Spain, and on a weekend... so maybe the construction others have referenced was dormant during our stay. We did see the scaffolding next door.

The service here was fantastic and the location second to none - just a few blocks from Placa Catalunya and located on one of Barcelona's most beautiful and magestic streets. Short walk to the subway and also to the Gothic Quarter and the Born neighborhoods - convenient to everything, really. We stayed at the W earlier in our trip and really wished we had been at the Mandarin for our whole stay in Barcelona. If you are concerned about noise, ask for a room on a higher floor and maybe one that does not face Paseo de Gracia.

Other than the construction factor, this is definitely a 5 star hotel. Rooms in Europe do tend to be smaller than in the US (except of course for NYC), but actually larger at this hotel than in some other European cities (try a 5 star hotel room in Rome if you don't believe me).",5,2012,08,06
44,Its a perfect place to stay,"Love everything about the hotel , the building the rooms , we stayed in a junior suit with balcony its terefic , the location in the shopping center , the rooms are clean an reallly new, the very helpfull concierge and perfect service , from the best hotel I ever stayed in Europe ",5,2012,08,05
44,"Noisy construction, can not sleep","There is construction and heavy noise next door. Impossible to sleep late in the morning. Crane over the terrasse pool. Not good enough for the money they ask. The interior dezign is good, but the rooms are small and the view is not very inspiring.",3,2012,07,29
44,Not a great experience.,"I stayed at this hotel for 7 nights from the 9th of July.  I was traveling with my two daughters ages 18 and 20.  I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and this is NOT a 5 star hotel.  We arrived in the evening and were shown to our room.  The room had an air cleaner in it as it had been smoked in by the previous guest.  It had a heavy smell of smoke and I asked for a different room but was told the hotel was totally booked.  Even with the air cleaner the bedding, curtains etc. all smelled like smoke the entire stay.  It was a terrace room and I was told that guests are allowed to smoke on the terrace only but our soap dish had cigerette burns on the dish so apparently they are smoking rooms even if it is called a smoke free hotel. The view from the terrace is horrible.  Very depressing ugly buildings are your view from these rooms.  I had considered a room with a view of the the front of the hotel and had asked for a photo of the view from the terrace room. I was sent a view of the garden below which was totally misleading.  There is construction next door so the noise and dust just added to the dissapointment of our stay.  I had questions to which I was directed to the general manager - I believe his name is Vincent - and he could not have been less helpful and was outright rude to me.  There were a lot of other small things that also were not up to par - they never restocked the mini bar so I had to call everday for soda, candy bars etc.  They gave us three washcloths for three people everyday unless I called and asked for more.  They never replaced the mouthwash and other bath supplies the entire stay.  They managed to get the coffee order wrong most days - I asked for extra sweetener no sugar but routinely got a small container with a few sugars and sweeteners.  On our first morning I had a private guide set up with a private car - I callled the night before for room service to be delivered at 8:00 a.m. and thought I would use this as our wake up call.  Bad idea - it arrived at 8:25 so as a result we were late for our expensive guide that morning.  Last summer we went to London and Paris.  We stayed at the Savoy in London and at the Four Seasons in Paris.  Both of these hotels are amazing - considering the price of the MO is the same I would have to say there is NO comparison.  I can definitely not recommend this hotel under any circumstances.",2,2012,07,28
44,Simply Fantastic,"Location
Perfect location. It is located at the centre of Passeig de Gracia which you can find most of the hi-end boutiques in Barcelona. Two Gaudi buildings are on the same street as the hotel, of which Casa Batllo is only 3 minutes walk from the hotel.  You can always find a taxi in front of the hotel (it takes around EUR10 to get to Park Guell and EUR35 to the Int’l Airport). However if you are more adventurous, the Metro station is just a few minutes walk away.

Check-in/Check-out
My family and I arrived early at around 9am. The hotel was fully booked that week and we were informed that the room would be ready at around 1pm. We went back at around 3pm and our luggage was waiting for us in the room. Overall, the whole check-in/out process was very smooth. The receptionist was very polite and professional, asking with discreet questions without being intrusive. The bellboys were very efficient and friendly as well.

Room
We stayed at the Mandarin Terrace room. It was slightly smaller than I thought. The décor is immaculate and neat which brings you a sense of serenity and calm. Views are over the Mandarin Garden, which frankly I don’t find spectacular at all. The good thing with a terrace is you can get some fresh air from outside. We didn’t spend any time in the terrace, as it was a bit dusty. 

Dining
Complimentary breakfast was provided at Blanc. The food could be better for a 5 star hotel (especially in a city famed for its gastronomy) however the restaurant itself is so cozy and can forget about the food and indulge in this quiet oasis.

However, one-star Michelin restaurant Moments did not disappoint us.  It was around 80 percent full the night I visited and each table was given appropriate attention.  The dining area isn’t too big and I’d recommend couples to book a table beside the window, which is beside a wall of plants outdoor.

A USD200 F&B credit was provided to us as part of the room package, however it didn’t state clearly that Moments is not eligible for the credit offer. 

Spa and other facilities
We didn’t do any spa treatments but visited the indoor pool beside the spa and the terrace pool. The indoor pool is a standard European hotel size (15m I assume) and there’s a herbal steam room beside the pool which is quite nice for you to relax after a long day out.

The terrace dipping pool was terrific with a stunning view of Passeig de Gracia.  Some guests might prefer to have a few more sun loungers but I think the amount they have right now is perfect – which provides you more space and privacy. One thing I’d suggest is to add a shower beside the dipping pool for people to wash themselves before getting in the pool.

Service
Legendary service with exquisite Asian hospitality – the service is what really makes Mandarin Oriental exceptional.",5,2012,07,25
44,Dissapointed,"I booked this hotel because of a recommendation by one of my friends who told me that it was fabulous. You are paying top dollar and have very high expectations. The hotel property is immaculate and our room was very impressive. It is very sleek and the interior design is WOW.
We arrived at the hotel at 11am and were told that check in is at 3pm, so we went for a walk and came back at 2:30pm and were told that the room was still not ready. Check out is at 11am, so really one would expect that a hotel could get a room ready in two and a half hours. We were kept waiting till 3:30pm.
There were lots of staff everywhere and everyone seemed attentive.
On the first night we wanted to have dessert in the hotel restaurant as we had some friends with us and asked to look at the dessert menu. It wasn't very comprehensive so we asked if it could be explained to us and the lady couldn't explain it so asked another lady to come and explain.
The young lady who came had a bad attitude, and had no idea about the menu. I was frustrated so asked if they had ice cream and what flavours they had. She knew the basics but when I questioned her about a name that she mentioned she couldn't tell me what it was. In the end I ordered chocolate, coffee and vanilla, and what came was 3 baby scoops of the wrong flavours. 
The next morning we had breakfast in the main area that they serve breakfast and it was nice but small portions of things and very fussy. We love a buffet, and this seemed to have small things, like a baby cup of yoghurt. Small plates of cut up fruit, and at times the plates were gone because they were emptied. There was a good cheese area. I ordered eggs Benedict and two baby stacks came out from the kitchen. It looked nice but tiny and not filling at all. It all felt fussy.
On check out I did mention my concern with the dessert experience and they did refund the money. The complaint was handled very seriously as the restaurant manager did personally come and apologize.
We were booked to stay at the Mandarin Oriental again for our last night and we cancelled and booked at the Alma instead which  was  much cheaper and really fabulous. The service was incredible and I've realised that service with a great property overtakes a  good service with a WOW property.",3,2012,07,23
44,Dissapointing Mandarin Property,"I have stayed in Mandarin Oriental hotels all over the world, and have been always impressed by them. This hotel is beyond disappointing. Rooms are the size of cabins on a cheap ocean liner, Room views terrible, and rooms themselves, try to be Barcelone ultra modern- but have failed in the design. Could not wait to get out of this hotel.",2,2012,07,19
44,GREAT SERVICE,"We stayed here in June and it was our first time staying at a Mandarin Oriental. We were very happy with our pick. The interior of the hotel is very unique and art deco and a perfect fit for Barcelona. However the service is really what stood out as excellent.. The most important was that the concierge was beyond helpful. Also the spa services were incredibe. 

The only drawback which the hotel really can't help is that there was construction next to the rooftop pool.",5,2012,07,19
44,"Not a negative review, but I was honestly a bit disappointed compared to other MO's I've stayed at","First, the positives:
The Oriental is on a wonderful street, filled with the finest high end shopping in all of Barcelona. It is safe, convenient, and surrounded by outstanding restaurants, which is simple to do, as Barcelona is a food city.
There are not one, but TWO Gaudi buildings to tour on this street, and they are amazing!
The hotel is short walking distance from the Ramblas, Barcelona's most famous street, but one that has been fraught with pickpockets. 
Their signature restaurant (Moments) is outstanding, and deserves their Michelin One Star rating.
Their spa is terrific, and after the long flight over to Barcelona, I badly needed to restore my body and sanity. Our flight over had been delayed due to mechanical issues for nine hours, making the trip from California grueling.
The rooms are okay, nothing special. Yes, it's a Mandarin Oriental, and anyone that complains about these rooms needs some serious relection, but if I'm completely honest, I've stayed at far better at both Four Seasons and other MO's. We were upgraded to a deluxe room overlooking their terrace (nothing special), and the room dimensions were small, the bathroom was just so so, and I simply wasn't blown away. 
I was caught between coming here and staying at the Palace, and to be honest, the next time I go to Barcelona, that's where I'm going to stay, as it's going to be at least as good.
The hotel is relatively new, so everything is clean and peachy, but it lacks character, and if the hotel isn't WOW, this is AMAZING (and it isn't), I'd go for the character. Sorry, MO, but this is as close to a ""negative"" review that I've given. It was simply okay.",4,2012,07,15
44,Fantastic all the way around!,"Location, location, location! I wouldn't stay anywhere else. It's perfect!
Regarding the hotel rooms and service: fantastic! My family and I travel frequently and only stay in  luxury hotels (Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Mandarin Oriental and some Starwood) so my expectations are always high. This property did not disappoint. We had two adjoining rooms (we traveled with our 2 kids) overlooking the Passage de Gracia. The view was great! We were worried about street noise, as it's a busy avenue. But it was surprisingly quiet. The windows in the rooms are very thick and must cancel out much of the noise. I would recommend the rooms overlooking the Passage de Gracia because the view is much better than the garden rooms with the terrace. The staff was excellent! Catering to our every need. They never said no! And the service was prompt and friendly. Nicolas on the roof deck was great. And the butler, last name Walsh, was super helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel. When we return to Barcelona, I will definatley stay at the Mandarin Oriental!",5,2012,07,12
44,Very good located,"I spent 4 night in this hotel, and must say they serve nice breakfast there, and it is located very well by all the nice shops.

The concierge is very helpful.

I stayed in a terrace room, but i do not recommend it at all, because the view is just terrible.

Other wise the hotel was nice to stay in, and i will go back if visiting barcelona again, but wont book for terrace

",4,2012,07,12
44,"Fireworks, Location, Service, Quiet Rooms, 5 Star All the Way","Location cannot be beat.  Right in the center of everything, amazing restaurants within walking distance, easy walk to all the historic areas, quick cab ride to the must sees of Barcelona.  I cannot imagine a better location.

We were offered an upgrade to a terrace room.  Traveling with my wife and child, the downgrade standard room was bigger.  The difference with the upgrade is an outdoor balcony which frankly we didn't need.  The rooms were not huge, but stunning in decor and so quiet.  We are fanatic about loud rooms and hearing noises, and this was one of the quietest rooms we have ever stayed at even though we were facing the busy street!

Moments is amazing.  Food all around in the hotel is great - the Michelin Star restaurant is worth the experience and did not disappoint.  Concierge steered us to amazing places each night.  Great recommendations.

Highlight of the entire trip was we were there on the big holiday where fireworks were going off all over town.  The rooftop was closed, and our 3 1/2 year old wanted to see the fireworks.  The staff let us up on the roof to watch the show (which we loved - amazing seeing fireworks over Barcelona).  When we got back to the room, there was a handmade card with my child's name on it and pictures of fireworks signed by the entire staff.  A definite keepsake, beyond thoughtful.

We will be back for sure.",5,2012,07,10
44,Stunning,"As you would expect from a Mandarin Oriental this hotel is simply stunning.

From the moment you arrive you are treated impeccably, the service was comparable to that you find in Asian hotels - no mean feat in Europe.   Normally you just cant compare Asian and European hotels as the service is Asia is by far superior, but this MO has really nailed it.

The hotel itself has been renovated sensitively and elegantly, with the space available being used to the best advantage.

The check in was slick and professional, with discreet questions being made about our stay without feeling intrusive.   

The room was slightly smaller than expected, but decorated to the standard you would expect with great unexpected touches.

There is a very small (and cold!!) pool on the roof with fairly limited seating it has to be said, but as this is a new hotel I should imagine they will spot this teething problem and provide more sun loungers shortly.

Breakfast was a real treat, not just the food (which was of course divine), but the restaurant itself is so chic and airy you want to drag out the breakfast as long as possible.  

Location is excellent, on Paseo de Gracia, with everything on your doorstep.

Keep up the good work MO Barcelona - I would return tomorrow if I could!",5,2012,07,10
44,"Wonderful settings, but fails in basics","This was our first stay at Mandarin and our expectations were quite high. Unfortunately the overall experience just wasn't what we hoped for.

Firstly, the location is truly superb if you're into shopping. The hotel is in the center of Barcelonas biggest shopping street, but there's plenty of reviews telling you this already.

The thing that seems surprising is how outdated the Mandarin website is. It really isn't today's standards. Very unpleasant to use, but once you figure out the logic, it get it job done. For that I'm rating the website ***

When we checked in, the staff seemed very concentrated in their on going business. To be fair we arrived early due to our flight and they said they can have the room ready in 15 minutes. We were directed to the Bankes Bar for coffee and some refreshments which was nice. However, the 15 minutes turned into 45 minutes and when I went ot ask about the room status, the reception called house keeping who apparently had forgotten the whole matter. So it took another 20 minutes to get our room.

We had the Terrace room which has a nice little balcony towards the courtyard. The design of the room was very nice with very high quality materials all over. Only downside would be slightly small size of the room. For our room I'd rate it *****

A thing to know (at the time of writing 07/12) is that the property next to the hotel is being remodeled to Mango and the noice really is something you might want to check before cheking in.  The jack hammer started quite early and went on throughout the day. Especially disturbing this was in the spa downstairs, where it really sounded like they were coming through the walls.

The spa itself is nice, and staff was very kind, but really disturbing issue was the fact that propably due to the renovation behind the wall, the whole pool & relaxation area had a extremely strong smell of sewage through our stay. I wondered why the saff didn't put some sort of incense of aromatic oils to diffuse the smell.

The rooftop was one of the reason we chose this hotel. We were looking for centrally located luxury hotel with a rooftop pool. As the website says, it really is a ""dipping pool"" that is about 50cm deep. So no laps there. It seemed like the whole rooftop was an after thought for the establishment since it just felt neglegted in general. Our absolutely most positive experience during our stay was the young man, Nathan who worked the rooftop (from noon to 22:00). Very kind, helpful and great attitude. Besides him, it felt like the place was run by interns.

Drinks and service could take up to 40 minutes to get to the roof and the consistency of offering was very diverse. Our group ordered dishes that others had earlier and each time the dish was with a different recipe or ingredients. This also was the issue with courtyard resaturant Mimosa.

My advice is to call the hotel first and ask about a) the next door renovation b) spa pool noise and smell. Other than that if they manage to get the service up to speed, this would be a wonderful city center hotel.

Overall, when ever the staff was adressed, they were very courteous and seemed active, but for me the ball just seemed to drop jst when it shouldn't.",4,2012,07,09
44,fabulous hotel! Great location!,"located in a beautiful location, set back,off the main street, this hotel is beautiful. We only stayed one night as we were off on a cruise, back what a great stay. After arriving early in the morning, after an overnight flight, the staff treated us to breakfast as we waited for our room to be ready. the room itself was spacious and elegant. The bathroom was  very large, with an exceptionally big shower and lovely standalone tub. We had a lovely breakfast the next day in a light and airy room. the service was very good. We have already booked our next visit.",5,2012,07,09
44,Feel home,"People are extremely nice at mandarin, One of the point Made these hotels famous in the world.
Location is fine, in the centre of the most famous street of Barcellona.
Rooms are ok, breakfast under the stamdard",4,2012,07,08
44,"Good stay, bad ending","Last year while we were staying at W Barcelona we had the opportunity to have a drink at Mandarin Oriental. We were blown away by the decor, the quiet atmosphere, and we were looking forward to staying this hotel.

So we booked a Mandarin Terrace room for the first week-end of July.

When arriving at the airport we were taken in charge by a great attendant. Confirmation of the concierge was mentionning a BMW Serie 7 but it was a Mercedes S-Class. No problem. One-way transfer is 160 Eur. It took only 20 minutes to reach the hotel, doormen were waiting at the entrance and check-in was quick and efficient.

Our room was not ready yet so we had a quick lunch at Mimosa Garden. The place is fantastic. Staff was young , yet very attentive and food was excellent. Wifi is accessible from everywhere in the hotel (public spaces, garden, swimming-pool) at no cost.

When room was ready the lady at reception told us she was busy and she could not show us the room, so she gave us the card and told us we could go by ourselves. You need the card in the elevator to reach your floor, which is a good security mesure.

The room itself was bigger than I expected ,very bright, with a small balcony/terrace. It faces the East so there is sun in the morning but no more in the afternoon which is great considering the heat in Barcelona. Bathroom was on the small side, with a 'wet room' meaning shower & bathtub are close together and everything will get wet. Design is nice, very modern, but choice of material is sometimes a bit odd and I fear furniture will age quickly.

Hotel seems usually well insulated, unfortunately there are building works just besides the hotel and we had noise everyday (even on Sunday). In a few months I guess it will be back to normal.

Breakfast is a large buffet with good selection.
We also tried in-room breakfast, everything was perfect.

We spent a lot of time at the swimming pool in the Spa area. The dipping pool on the roof is very nice, but there was too much sun for us. We saw almost nobody at both places and it was great to enjoy a 12m pool for just the two of us. Good point: there is a special lift which goes straight to the Spa with no possible stop at lobby level to avoid being seen by other guests when you're in your bathrobe & slippers.

Concierge gave us good advices for restaurants (many close to the hotel in Passatge de la Concepcio).
Location is perfect for shopping. But keep in mind that the sea is a long walk so depending on the purpose of your trip W or Arts can be a good alternative to MO if you want to enjoy the beach in summer.

Overall, our stay was good, but it lacked something special to make it even better, service was not up to our expectations.
And after having booked our transfer from hotel to airport with the Concierge, and checked it with Reception, we had a very bad surprise when we had to leave. They just had forgotten, and there was no car available. It is the first time ever that concierge forgets about transfer. We had already paid for it on the bill so it was removed and reimbursed quickly, but we had to take a cab (25 Eur) and it last impression of the hotel was rather disappointing.",3,2012,07,07
44,Just Mandarin,"Perfect location in the Passeig Gracia city center with best shopping around.
Almost everything was perfect in that luxury hotel : excellent service, helpful concierge and front desk staff, nice breakfast buffet and amazing restaurant,  extreme cleanliness ,on and on

Considering that this building used to be a bank the way that it has been laid out makes good use of the features the building has to offer. Entrabce alone makes you feel like a star walking up at catwalk. the reaturant Blanc is siutated it what I belive would be the old banking hall and has natutal light flooding in from the roof windows.

44,Luxury boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"We stayed in the Deluxe Boulevard Room for four nights during our recent trip to Barcelona and were impressed by the hotel's high standards of service. Situated in the middle of the luxury shopping strip Passeig de Gràcia, the hotel location is excellent.  The interior design is contemporary yet soft and welcoming. The room was a little smaller than we expected but nonetheless comfortable.  We were a little disappointed that the bathroom only had a standing shower with no a separate bathtub. The bed was very comfortable with high quality linens. The food at the hotel was excellent with top notch service. We had a hot stone massage and a Thai massage at the hotel spa which were absolutely divine! We highly recommend Mandarin Oriental Barcelona.",5,2012,06,28
44,Really the best,"I slept in many hotels in Barcelona, but this one is really the best. Check-in was very fast and efficient. The gym was opened 24 hours a day, with excellent equipment and cold drinks available even at late hours. The bedroom was so quite at night that I thought it was not working, but it was indeed and I felt it during the night. My bedroom was just front of the famous Paseo de Gracia, noisy from morning to evening,  but inside I heard no noise at all. Room service was served quickly and food was tasteful. Staff and food quality at the breakfast buffet were also of high standard. As for its location, it is right downtown and it could not be better. I highly recommend it.",5,2012,06,25
44,Asian beauty in Barcelona,"As always Mandarin Oriental does not disappoint and the sense of beauty is outstanding. I love the decorations, the soft colors, the white tones and the harmony so well obtained. The entrance, and restaurants, bars are well situated to create areas of elegance and amazingly  there are always areas of tranquility. You feel private even if the restaurant is full. The Mimosa terrace is a lovely area with another esthetic feel to it. The chairs are well chosen. You dive in literally and feel like a film diva. YES I like it. So we arrived and were treated as royals, all details taken care of. While waiting for the room to get ready we grabbed a snack and wow, it was superb. Europe meets Asia and very well balanced. Our room was with a terrace and we enjoyed a cool glass of white wine, while looking at the charming backstage scenes of Barcelona. Very colorful, almost chinese spirit to it. The big bathroom was fantastic, with bathtub and shower separated. Unfortunately I did not have time to check out the Spa area and dip pool. But the restaurant Moment and I definitely give my best best recommendations. The breakfast was superb and the restaurant beautiful.",5,2012,06,18
44,Keeps up to the Standard of the brand,"Disappointingly the night before travelling american express called to say the hotel would not be able to upgrade the room on arrival as American express had indicated (with a subject to availibility waiver).Howver they did reduce the rate for the room given instead.

The room was pleasant and overlooked a school at the back and its best to avoid these rooms as one gets a lot of noise from the lids paying in the morning in the playground below.

Generally what one would expect from a Mandarin Oriental...the room butler indicated she would iron clothes complimentary...got lumped with an ironing bill so may be complimentary has another meaning here.

The bathrooms/ shower design is a bit daft as the shower is in the same outside the bathtub and when showering since there is no enclosure the entire place gets wet.similarly the washbasin in the separate WC is so small water splashes everywhere...the designers didn't think through practical aspects.

The contracted exclusive Limo provider to the hotel is a rip off and best to avoid.The concierge recommended an alternative whom they could not deal with directly that was about 40% cheaper for half and full day trips out of Barcelona and very good.

The Barman at the Bankers Bar in the hotel  mixed some great cocktails!",4,2012,06,15
44,Unparalleled Service,"I booked under Platinum amex. We were upgraded to a a very small room with a terrace  . The next day we were downgraded to a much larger room and a bathroom twice the size, with a separate bathtub and shower. We didn't quite understand but apparently the terrace is a prized room. We much preferred the room without the terrace.  The even lowered our rate. It was room 508. The beds and pillows were very comfortable.  Two comfortable chairs in the room as well as the desk chair.The shower was powerful and the bathtub was excellent. Very contemporary decor. Blackout shades worked very well. The hotel even provided us with a computer in our room as they do not have a business center. Our butler Elana was beyond helpful as were all the other butlers whose names I unfortunately cannot remember. Breakfast was excellent and included with our room. English was spoken throughout the hotel. They served us champagne upon arrival as we preferred it over cava. The staff all knew our names. I did use the spa which was lovely. We also received a drink at the bankers bar and an 85 euro credit at the spa under the platinum program.
The concierges were all extremely helpful, Carlos, Alberto and Francisco. We will definitely stay at more Mandarins after this very positive experience.",5,2012,06,03
44,Awesome,"This hotel is slick, clean, sophisticated, centrally located. The staff is amazing and pays attention to every detail. Make sure to check out the terrace on the 9th floor... The food in the garden restaurant is amazing, and if you aren't staying here, you can eat and have a drink there, you will not be sorry!",5,2012,05,29
44,"Quality, location, service","Quality hotel,service and location.  Utmost service attentiveness from all quarters of staff services makes for a very pleasant stay. Highly recommended.",5,2012,05,28
44,A supperb hotel,It never ceases to amaze me the great quality of all Mandarin Orientals I haves stayed in. This one is in a wonderful location in Barcelona. You are made welcome as soon as you arrive by a very personal and efficient reception. Rooms are well appointed even though some may be a bit small. However the wonderful  water pressure in the shower makes up for this!! Service is flawless...breakfast arrives perfectly on time!! The spa is also great with wonderful treatments. A really worthwhile experience.,5,2012,05,21
44,Great Hotel!,"My wife and I spent 3 nights in this fantastic hotel.  Amazing design (courtesy of Patricia Urquiola) excellent service, awesome breakfast buffet.  Try the gastro restaurant ""Moments"", a truly great experience.",5,2012,05,21
44,A truly perfect luxury hotel in Barcelona,"Perfectly located  amongst the up market stores in Passeig de Gracias The Madarin’s entrance is somewhat understate with a long ramp carpeted by the most fabulous Chinese rug leading you to the hotel reception and concierge. 

We stayed for two nights at this beautifully appointed hotel situated in the heart of Barcelona. The service is simply what you would expect from this fabulous hotel group – nothing is too much trouble.

The décor is simply stunning - reminiscent of sixties chic yet strikingly modern. Our room looked over the beautifully designed Mimosa Garden used for al fresco dining. 

I could go on and on about every aspect of this wonderful hotel but a visit to their website will convince you of its merits.

 A stay at The Mandarin is not inexpensive but I believe it is tremendous value in terms of faultless service. Push the boat out and stay there the next time you are in Barcelona. I do not believe that you will be disappointed.",5,2012,05,11
44,Cool modern place living up to Mandarin standards with boutique hotel feel,"We spent two nights in the Deluxe Terrace room on 1st floor overlooking the hotel's private garden.   It was our first visit to Barcelona and we came to celebrate our wedding aniversary and see the City.  We decided to stay at the Mandarin because it was newly opened and we stayed at other Mandarin hotels in Europe and Asia and liked the level of serice and quality of hotels.

We would like to share the following observations:
Overall impression - very positive, this is a new property with a feeling of a boutique hotel with very good and attentive service, good restaurants and spa.  the hotel is in the centre of Barcelona luxury shopping district and not far from its main tourist attractions. Therefore it is somewhat far from the beach attractions of Barcelona however the Mimosa Garden restaurant, the rooftop pool, the spa, and the Blanc and Moments restaurants more than compensate lack of the seaside view and atmosphere.   We went to the W Hotel for lunch and althought the seaside location is v attractive we were dissapointed with the food in the main restaurant and the feel of a mega Las Vegas hotel in the lobby.   We were happy to return to the Mandarin after having our lunch the the W Hotel and settle in the great Mimosa Garden restaurant.

Rooms - cool modern style however relative small. We recommend a room with the terrace facing garden or larger as rooms without terrace must feel as being v small.

Restaurants - we spent a lot of time in the Mimosa Garden restaurant which has a Mediterranean felling and good food and wine.  We were somewhat dissappointed with food at Moments which at the same time has excellent ambience and is great for a romantic dinner.  Blanc has good breakfast and consistent main menu althought we would prefer Mimosa during warm weather

Spa - we have only toured the spa but found it very impressive.  at the same time the menu is more expensive than in top London or Paris hotels which we find unjustified.  the spa pool is very small.

Roof top pool - it was closed to our surprise with a notice that it is opening in May.   We liked the view and envy guests who will have opportunity to enjoy this area since May.

Service - the staff is very young and the hotel new hence we recommend not taking everything for granted e.g. we booked a dinner at Moments one week before arrival only to find that there was not reservation made (however the restaurant gave us a table when we insisted we made the booking via the concierge); breakfast service was somewhat slow, we were bugged with 2 prompts/calls from the reception re our credit card details following arrival only to find that the reception noted incorrect cc expiry date, we could not open the door in the public bathroom and had to call maintenance to assist.  However when we complained the management was extremely helpful and polite and we found a bottle of complimentary champagne when we returned to the room.   Hence overall all was up to Mandarin standards.",5,2012,05,05
44,Fantastic staff and a great location,"We spent 3 nights in a boulevard room on the 7th floor that was quiet, comfortable and stylish. Breakfast at Blanc was included otherwise it is about 29 euro. The staff really tried to make us feel at home and were glad to help us in any way. The mixologist at the Bankers bar were very skilled and helpful. The roof top pool is closed in the winter and as I recall opens in May.",5,2012,04,29
44,Wonderful service - excellent place to stay,"We had 3 days/2 nights at the Manadrin in Barcelona.  The service and staff were outstanding throughout - we arrived late morning and were provided with coffee/pastries while are room was made ready. Spa including the steam room was wonderful - on our last day, after visiting the Cathedral, we utilised the Spa ahead of leaving for the airport (our bags were retrieved from the concierge and brought to us in the Spa). We were also delighted by the glasses of Cava on arrival... and departure.  Our room was lovely with all the facilities you would expect although my partner was disappointed she didn't get chocolates on the second night! Finally, the new restaurant/drinks courtyard - opened the week- was a lovely place to unwind before enjoying Barcelona in the evening.

Overall we had a brilliant time from start to finish and would strongly recommend.  One small current issue to note (& not the Mandarin's fault) is the building work next door - we had a room at the back and the noise started at 8am.  ",5,2012,04,28
44,Hotel is great and stuff is AMAZING!!!,"We actually live in Barcelona now. Staying in a hotel is by choice to relax (we have a big house up in Tibidabo). We stayed once as a romantic wend just my husband and myself (I am pregnant now),the 2nd time with our 2 kids as well (14+3y.o). Both times we had exactly what we were looking for - relax, even with kids! Hotel is just excellent!Everything is perfect BUT especially the people! I would like to thank everybody who works there and makes it special and adds a nice touch! People actually remember our names and the names of our kids! We had cookies sent to our room and ducks for our younger son to have in the tub and his name (LUKE) made out of letters in the shower! We loved it and so did our kids! Room service is SUPER! I've traveled a lot and stayed in really nice places and would like to say that the room service food is usually at best ok. Probably, most of you will agree. Here, the selection is nice and the quality is great! The breakfast is very nice with a proper selection of everything (including dim sum),lots of fruits,etc, of course! Great location, needless to say! Still, for us what made it special were the people. Thank you again and we will be back again many times and we recommend to our friends and business partners of my husband!!!",5,2012,04,13
44,"Not flawless, but still top class","I spent 3 nights at the hotel during my recent trip to Barcelona.  Great location, good food and real top class design.  Breakfast at the Blanc was a pleasurable experience.  Very elegant and clever design, making use of skylight during the day and cozy lighting at night.  Their steam room at the basement has lounge chair and showers inside.  Real cool.  On the flip side, service at the breakfast was not very attentive the first day and showers inside the room didn't drain properly.  I had a room facing the busy street of Passieg de Gracia, so it's a bit noisy.  But overall, a great hotel.  One of my top choices in Barcelona.",4,2012,04,09
44,Perfect location BUT ... not the best value for money,"1) Location is perfect just in the middle of shopping street , with 2 Gaudi houses on same street . U can walk across the road and enjoy Rambla de Catalunya with many small shops and tapas places
2) Stuff very nice and pleasant 
3) Rooms that's the biggest minus of this hotel . It's not a disaster but lots of minor things which in complex not making your feel comfortable ( like no hooks in bathroom for towels or clothes , after shower water all over around the place , glass  doors are not closing properly so why do they need doors at all then ... POOR Sound isolation !!!!!! Don't expect to enjoy the morning sleep as you ll wake up with the city !!!! So 350 euros for the place with perfect location , strange room design and the place where you weren't be able to have proper sleep ..... More likely you ll find better value for money in this wondefull city :))",3,2012,04,01
44,"Very nice hotel,great location","As you would expect of a Mandarin Oriental, the hotel had very nice rooms, food(the AC worked very well),location and service. What really made this hotel stand out was the concierge desk. My wife, daughter and I don't speak Spanish and have some dietary restrictions. The concierge staff was able to direct us to great restaurants as well answering general tourist questions about the city.They definitely made our stay more enjoyable. The breakfasts were great! Probably the best example of service occurred during my wife's birthday.I called to request some cake for my wife.  Room service put candles on the cake,brought champagne and sang happy birthday! The location was great.",4,2012,03,29
44,"mostly a great hotel, perfect location","Just returned from a week at the MO Barcelona. Overall the service is excellent.  They are warm and friendly and try really hard, particularly concierge and Front Desk and bellmen. 
The hotel is extremely well situated for sites, restaurants, and international luxury brand shopping.  The ambiance and crowd are very chic and upscale feeling. Barcelona is an exciting beautiful and easily navigated city and the Mandarin is located right at the center of the action for a visitor.
We were actually deciding between the Mandarin and the Arts hotel where we have stayed on prior trips.  Mandarin is more conveniently located and central.  Arts has much bigger rooms with amazing city/ water views.  Both have very good service. If you are looking for good value, this is not the spot.  In fact we had some friends that checked out early and moved up the street for suites double the size at half the price at an historic well-known hotel in a similar location.  We did not, but know in advance that this hotel does not offer you the most in accommodations for your money. 
Restaurant recommendations were hit and miss. There was a terrible Tapas place around the corner that did not have one healthy item on the menu, did not have lettuce, or vinegar, and was out of two items on the menu we requested that was highly recommended.  Don't go there. The hotel food itself is good so that is always an option. Other than the hotel I woud say our most enjoyable eating experience in Barcelona was the Boqueria Market on Las Ramblas - don't miss that!  Truly amazing.  Otherwise we found food to be weak or over the top expensive( ie Abac at over $300 p/p) It could have been us but we had a hard time finding quality, healthy upscale dining.
Rooms are well-equipped and well-designed with advanced technology.  They are on the small side. Ours had a great shower, no bath, which I would have liked to have with all the walking one does in Europe. We were originally supposed to stay in a Junior Suite which is double the price of a regular room. When we went to check it out we didn't think it was worth moving b/c the room was next door, also on a low floor.  They could not accommodate us for the full stay in the suite so we started in the room. We ended up staying in it b/c even though they asked us during make the reservation if we had any requests and we sent a request for a quiet room on a high floor, we were offered the suite on the 4th floor for a 7 nt stay we had reserved well in advance. We were supposed to receive an upgrade based on availability through Virtuoso, so either they don't upgrade, or it wasn't available, but I do wish that when we requested,quiet room/ high floor, when they in fact solicited special requests, with a form they send prior to your arrival that they had answered that our request would not be available.
Breakfast was included with our stay and was good, a nice buffet, but offerings did not change at all during the week we were there, so more exciting the first day, by the end we were grabbing a coffee to go and going out to try something else. There is a great well utilized bar, the Banker's Bar in the lobby.  Hotel has a very upscale retail feeling with a Manolo and Tiffany stores in the lobby - not the most practical, but pretty.  There are pharmacies, etc on the same block so you can get whatever you need. 
Some issues during out stay-While downstairs service was top notch,housekeeping was just okay.  In a week we received hair conditioner once and had to call for it and then it took 45 minutes.  Ditto with Q-tips.  There were three shower caps and four shampoos.  Someone could not get the bathroom amenities straight for a week.  Oddly for a luxury hotel, towels were noticeably rough, both in the room and spa .I do not recommend the spa. I had a massage the second day and planned on more but was not all inspired to return. I had a less than comfortable massage-room was cold, there were rough towels on the table both  below and for a blanket.  The therapist did not listen at all to what I requested though I speak both Eng and Spanish.  I had to ask the spa front desk for a shower cap in the bathroom. I was sort of kicking myself for leaving a 20 percent tip out of habit b/c overall in was not a good massage experience.
The hotel is heavily scented with amber fragance both in the lobby and upstairs hallways.  It is quite powerful and distinct. We were okay with it but it's surprising that they don't chose a lighter more universally pleasing scent. It is what you would expect to smell in a dark, Orientaliste hotel filled with old Persian rugs, not in a light / bright modern place like the MO Barcelona.
In summary it was a nice experience,  but in the future I might return to the Mandarin or I might return to the Arts where I was given upgrades and incredible service at the club level. They are the best two hotels in Barcelona for different reasons. If I was with family/ teens or wanted to spend time on the beach I would definitely choose the Arts for the enormous room/ aptmt sizes.  If I was a couple or single I might choose the Mandarin if the price was competiive and for the privilege of walking out the door to the fabulous Paseig de Gracia.",4,2012,03,25
44,Absolutely Fabulous,"We had an amazing experience at this hotel. This was my first stay at a Mandarin Oriental, and it far exceded by expectations. I really cannot say enough good things about it. Service was impeccable at all times. The location was perfect with upscale shops very nearby, more moderate shopping one block over, two Gaudi buildings within a 3 minute walk (one was across the street and viewable from our room), and of course a doorman was always there to give us directions, greet us, and help us with a cab. We never actually had to wait for a cab because there were always several right there in front of the hotel. It was rainy when we were there and the doorman provided both myself and my fiance with umbrellas for our sightseeing. Front desk staff provided a map and all spoke excellent English. In fact, every single member of the staff spoke excellent English (this was not the case when we stayed in Valencia and Paris at different hotels) so we really appreciated it here. The room was beautiful, although a bit smaller than American hotel rooms. Every single thing I could possibly have wanted was already in the room ~ little things like bath salts, a bookmark, a magazine with an article on the Michelin starred restaurant in the hotel, electrical outlet adaptors, Ionic blow dryer (important if you are female), a remote control for the black out shade, champagne/white wine/red wine glasses, two different sizes of slippers, just anything and everything one could need or want was already there. The bed was very comfortable and the windows eliminated all outside noise. We were on the sixth floor and heard absolutely zero street noise (vastly different from New York City where I stayed in a hotel on the 31st floor of Le Parker Meridien and was kept awake by street noise). The black out shade was so effective and the room so quiet that I inadvertently slept until 1 in the afternoon.
You must check out the Banker's Bar ~ it doesn't have bartenders, it has mixologists. The cocktails were innovative and contained the freshest ingredients. The hotel was once a bank and the bar contains safety deposit boxes on the walls (and ceiling). There was also a lovely patio outside, but it was rainy so we didn't have the opportunity to enjoy that.
We also had dinner in the hotel and spent 4 hours in the spa. I will review those as well.
In summary, it is going to be very difficult for me to stay at any other hotel now. I am fairly sure they will have a difficult time measuring up to this one. Absolutely the pinnacle of excellence in all areas.",5,2012,03,23
44,Simply marvelous!,"This is my second trip to Barcelona.
MO Barcelona remains one of my favorite city hotels. Staff are professional and friendly. The hotel also cannot be in a better location. 

Last time I didn’t get to try out their Michelin restaurant because it was closed for a Summer break, but this time I finally dined at MOments.  MOments serve modern Catalan cuisine and we tried their tasting menu. Chef Raül Balam is very creative, with a strong respect for each ingredient’s original taste. His team picks the season’s finest and freshest, and create dishes with a modern twist to the authentic Catalan flavors. Presentation is also a key element here, as each dish is presented like a piece of art.
The 2 Spanish wines which the Sommelier picked were both excellent and complimented perfectly to our meal.

The next day, I went to the Spa and had two of their “star” treatments (offered only in very few places); the Bastien pedicure and the Linda Meredith Haute Couture facial (I was told the LM facial is a favorite of Kate Moss, Gwyneth Paltrow, Madonna and Jude Law)!!!!  
The Bastien pedicure is exactly what I needed after much walking in the city. The leg massage soothed my tired feet and the pedicure gave my toe nails a nice clean natural shin (perfect as I especially prefer no nail coloring when travelling). Then the Linda M facial therapist analysed my skin (my face was calling for S.O.S. after much flying), and gave me a deep (non-harsh) cleansing and deep hydration facial – a much needed water plumping to my dehydrated skin. 

Going back to our Suite, it is sunset time, and our Butler has already arranged my favorite cocktail (Banker’s bar signature ginger martini) for our enjoyment at the balcony! Salud¡ Así es la vida¡",5,2012,03,15
44,Tony Hayes,"I travel a great deal and thus, I am no stranger to hotels around the world.

I recently stayed at the MOB with my wife and two children (14 & 3). We were amazed by the service, food (great room service food too) and their exceptional customer service.

From the personal greetings including toys for our son Luke, the welcome notes and truffles in the rooms, a personalized welcome in the bath spelled out for Luke, an exceptionally helpful butler service and the overall overly helpful staff around the hotel we had a simply marvelous and relaxing time. And the bedding is simply wonderful.

I can assure you that whenever we take a break in Barcelona and whenever we are asked for a recommendation for a hotel in the city, it will be Barcelona Mandarin Hotel that we suggest.

...and make the time to check out their spa...!",5,2012,03,15
44,unique,"What a hotel!!
We had a 2 days stop in Barcelona and we decided to try again a Mandarin Oriental. 
Glad we did it!! Rooms are fabulous, service is perfect, location the same.
U will sleep in a fabulous room, high quality beds, chic bathrooms , rain showers.",5,2012,03,12
44,Overall a great hotel.,"I stayed at this mandarin oriental on the back and of a European trip from the states with two teenagers. Upon arrival, the bellhop was exceptionally nice and took our bags as soon as we arrived. We were swiftly checked in and brought to our room. A nice, spacious room with a view of the city and a great flat screen T.V and on demand movies. After visiting the pool and sauna, both tolerant of children,(but the children are exceptionally well behaved) we adjourned to the room for room service and some rest. The room service was very quick and tasted fabulous. The beds were extremely comfy and well sized. The only critique I have is that with the shower, regardless of the door being closed, water would secrete under the door and onto the floor of the actual room. But, that is a minor problem. Overall, this hotel is great and I recommend it to anybody in Barcelona.",4,2012,03,01
44,Oasis in an unbeatable location,"MO barcelona is one of the new boutique hotels MO is now developing all over the world

The attention to detail is here sublime and the dedicated efforts from everyone makes the stay memorable

I stayed here for over one week last year and had a great time

For me the highlights are the gym an pool area, the terrace mimosa and the rooftop

The rooms are on the small side but comfortable and very clean",5,2012,02,29
44,Quality concept hotel,"Public areas are stylish and modernist. Bedrooms are designer but also practical. I had an entry level room facing the courtyard on level 3. It featured a huge, high quality bed with oddly hard pillows (2, not 4); a large circular free-standing bath with a view was great; monsoon shower worked well and was spacious; separate sink and toilet rooms were welcome; TV was easy to use and high quality; lighting controls were (as always in modern hotels) a little confusing; bedlinen, towels and bathrobes were quality and comfortable; floor to ceiling windows. There were 2 fairly bad cleaning issues upon arrival that still weren't rectified within 24 hours. Room service was swift and polite. Breakfast staff were sometimes slow but the breakfast choice was very comprehensive and delicious. Bankers Bar has a great smoking terrace, lovely cocktails and professional staff. Reception, Concierge and Door staff were all courteous and helpful. The -1 level swimming pool and spa are both good. The rooftop pool was closed during my stay but I have previously viewed it and it is a great space. In conclusion, this is a slightly over-priced hotel that delivers on most levels but there are some areas that could be improved at little cost.",4,2012,02,27
44,Best in BCN,"Clearly the premier hotel in Barcelona . Lives up to all the expectations one should have for a MO . 
Service level and staff attitude on par with MO HK . 
Rooms vere bright and well designed , bed ultra comfortable , room service excellent .
The Bankers Bar is a nice place to hang out , interesting people and a bartender that provides great drinks with a show and a smile.
Only possible drawback is the "" lack "" of a lobby and the location of the main restaurant .",5,2012,02,27
44,Absolutely Decadent,"So far for me this is the BEST hotel in the world.  From the convenient location on Passeig de Gracia (around the corner from Tapas, 24 my favorite tapas bar in Barcelona), to the gorgeous rooms, dining room and Bankers Bar to the very personalized, VIP and over and beyond service of the concierge, restaurant, bar and front desk..it is the perfect hotel.  Definitely will be my home everytime I visit Barcelona.  Their welcome Cava is a delight and I love the breakfast buffet they have that serves different kinds of olive oil and Cava of course.  The view from our room was one out of a postcard.  Cant wait to go back.",5,2012,02,24
44,Outstanding concierge service and staff - truly very service oriented hotel.,"This hotel is located in a great location, close to metro and aerobus. It is also within reasonable walking distance of most sites. The service staff is there to please and we were upgraded to a higher floor and courtyard room when our room was not available on our arrival.  I do agree that the aromatherapy that hits you in the lobby is overpowering and can be annoying. The concierge staff was so on target recommending just the restaurants we were interested in and made reservations where possible. They also mapped out each day for us so that we didn't have to guess as to our timing of attractions. I had a massage at the spa with a very knowledgeable masseuse recommending a follow up set of stretches to utilize at home. The quiet area is for both men and women.  We were able to get a special rate including breakfast and 
spa credit so it was worth the price.  ",5,2012,02,20
44,"Great Location for all the Barcelona sights, restaurants & shopping","It was a difficult call between the Mandarin Oriental and the Hotel Arts when we were deciding where to stay. Having booked the former, we are very glad we did - principally for its fantastic location. We could just walk everywhere from the hotel - we were surrounded by the best shops and great restaurants. Breakfast was excellent - expensive, even for continental - so try to get a rate which includes it. Rooms are not particularly large, are ultra modern and the lighting etc was a bit over-engineered for our liking - lots of white walls and surfaces which are already beginning to show a bit of wear & tear. The first room we were shown did not have a bath so we asked to be moved to a room which had one - they were happy to do this as the hotel was quiet. Gym is small, but has sufficient equipment for a short city break; spa pool looked reasonable, but small - we did not use it. The Bankers Bar is great - fab gin & tonics and selection of cocktails. Again, expect to pay city hotel prices. We didn't eat in the restaurants as there was so much choice all around. The concierge desk is excellent - as mentioned by others. Overall, the commitment to guest service shows at this property as it does at all the Mandarin Orientals we have stayed at.",4,2012,02,17
44,Great personal service and lovely rooms!,"the service at the Mandarin in Barcelona is almost perfect and so personal. I love the hotel and their staff for their friendliness  and great service.

Psg de Gracia location amazing. Hotel room was set away from street so noise was minimal. 

I love photography and was allowed after hours, with security detail, access to rooftop pool & terrace. The magical view of this magical city was sublime.",5,2012,02,15

Very big and nice swimming pool in the 2nd floor, with hammam and gym. The gym is not really big. Both are free access if you're hosted in the hotel.
I don't often go to hotels in this price range, usually you can find this hotel at rates between 250 and 350 Euro, too much for me.
Breakfast... I don't know... 30$ each one (I've not seen). Coffe with milk served in the room 8 euros.... all has similar rates, double or triple than i expected.
But I'm lucky and I got a special promotion for only 130 Euros, and went to this really great place.
They invite to drink a glass of cava, catalan sparkling wine, in the Bankers bar. Nice people, nice place, nice moments.
I've been in summer to, in the terrasse Mimosa, and is very nice place to take something.
The location is the best.
Just take a look to the pictures... no comments.
The room, was with shower, with no bathtube !!! and no terrace.... great for me because I pay 130 Euros... , I had not written the same thing if I had paid 300...",5,2012,01,30
44,amazing weekend in barcelona,"This was a business stay for me and I wasn't paying (actually don't know what the cost was), but I thought it was perfect.
The location was fabulous. It is located on the street with all the best shopping.",5,2012,01,26
44,weekend in Barcelona,"Last weekend we spent with my husband and 3 year old son in Mandarin Oriental. All of us had a great time. The stuff, the facilities and the room was everything you can only dream about. Our son was just spoiled by stuff - toys, special biscuits, sweats. There are nice restaurants and Banker's Bar in the Hotel - definitely worse to visit. We  have stayed in other hotels in Barcelona but Mandarin Oriental is the best.",5,2012,01,17
44,One of the best Hotel in Barcelona,"I spent one night but enough to say that they have the best concierge, perfect location, great Bar, excellent restaurant and comfortable room.

Despite a noisy first room due to window system, I was quickly and without any effort moved (they handle my clothes and replaced my laptop in power!) to another room.

Excellent breakfast with some Chinese raviolis. Design is amazing.

Strongly recommended",5,2012,01,17
44,Ultimate luxurious hotel!,"This hotel was the ultimate treat if you can afford the stay.  Located in the very posh area of Barcelona with shopping and Gaudi sights right at the doorstep.

The service and staff went out of there way to accommodate your every desire, and everyone knew your name.  I can't say enough about how wonderful the hotel was.  They even used aromatherapy diffusers through out the hotel so there were never any unpleasant odors anywhere you went.  

The spa was exceptional and provided a very relaxing experience after a day of taking in the sights.",5,2012,01,14
44,"If you can afford it, stay here","This hotel has it all: beautiful design, great service, outstanding location. We stayed in a suite with a wonderful terrace overlooking the passeig de gracia.Although the floor plan was open (in my experience, it's hard to find a two room suite in Europe, most are open floor plans unless you get up over $1200/night), we had plenty of room and never heard one sound from the hallway or another room. Our terrace looked right out at one of Gaudi's most famous buildings, it was amazing. If you're trying to decide between the Ritz and here, I would definitely stay here. The Ritz is on the beach, which is a very nice area but if you're doing the tourist thing in Barcelona you're probably not going to spend more than one day at the beach, which makes the Ritz a pretty isolated option. Also, the Mandarin service is incomparable.  If you're not going to stay here, check out Hotel Omm, it looked really cool. Finally, just FYI, BARCELONA IS FANTASTIC.",5,2012,01,10
44,"A beautiful, luxurious hotel!","If you are looking for a treat, stay here! Fantastic location, most beautiful roof-top pool view, rooms just divine. Spa is fab and indoor pool too!",5,2012,01,09
44,It is what makes a hotel different,"Beautiful hotel, luxury accomodations, great location and great food and beverage. What made this hotel exceptional was simply the people that worked there. Every single person I met who worked there was not just business friendly, but truly friendly people. To me, that was what made the trip great.",5,2012,01,04
44,Exceeded Expectations,"Fantastic location, staff truly likes people.  Most friendly + desire to serve of any hotel I've ever stayed at around the globe.  Great bed, shower took a day to get used to.  No shower door and water cascaded from what appeared to be the light fixture.  Great roof top; spectacular views of the city.  W e definitely like Barcelona and will be returning.  Moments restaurant was expensive but - why not ?? White glove service and interesting preparation(s).",5,2011,11,26
44,Mandarin is a great location,"We stayed here for two nights at the beginning of our cruise and one night at the end.  The location was great. HOHO bus stops right in front. Many great restaurants and shopping within walking distance.  Walkable to Las Ramblas as well.  Very professional staff.  Room was comfortable and quiet.  Our flight arrived on a Sunday morning and the hotel was able to get us into a room right away.  My only complaint was the extremely strong incense that filled the public areas and gave me a horrible headache.  I was never able to eat in the cafe or enjoy afternoon tea.  If you are sensitive to perfume or have allergies, I would avoid this hotel.  Otherwise it was very nice and can't say enough about the staff, they were outstanding.",4,2011,11,16
44,Perfect location for exploring Barcelona,"We just spent 3 nights at the Mandarin Barcelona, and were on all counts very happy with our choice. We booked our stay through the AmEx Platinum Concierge, which in addition to a reduced room rate added several great perks: free full breakfast every morning (and the food was delicious), free afternoon tea (once per stay, again delicious), and late check-out. All-in home run.

** Great location - 1 block from Casa Batllo (a Gaudi gem), an easy walk to Las Ramblas and the marina, in the heart of prime shopping and restaurants
** Attentive service - we were entirely dependent on concierge assistance for daily wanderings and local tapas joints, and their recommendations / directions were great. When we needed tickets to Segrada Familia on a rainy day, one of the bellmen gave us umbrellas and escorted us in the rain 2 blocks to purchase advance tickets from the nearly hidden cash machine to avoid the lines. Wow.
** Facilities - spotless, and lovely. Must confess that we were laughing at ourselves trying to figure out how some of the uber-modern fixtures work (with no visible buttons / switches!)

Overall, highly recommend this hotel - especially if booked through AmEx Platinum.",5,2011,11,14
44,The Reign in Spain,"It's very simple: if you want the best hotel experience in Barcelona, look no further. The MO perfectly exemplifies New Spain, with an elegant balance of tradition-meets-modernity. My first (in 20 years) impressions of the changes that started at the sleek airport - smooth from disembarkment to baggage retrieval - were mirrored by my arrival at the MO - from the smooth drive down the graceful boulevard of the Passeig de Gracia - to the grand walk up the ramp through the old-world portals of the 18th century building to the modernist lobby.
My junior suite is well-appointed and service is friendly and efficient. Meals at their restaurant Blanc are a good example of new Spanish cuisine, but the hotel is well-positioned for exploration of tapas bars. As with all MO hotels, the location is primed for easy access to many attractions, including monuments by Gaudi, and the best Spanish fashion brands, from Loewe to Zara, are on your doorstep.",5,2011,10,31
44,Wonderful hotel. Everything exceeded our expectations!,"First class, modern, stylish, intimate, fashionable, comfortable, luxurious.
Friendly, patient and knowledgeable staff. 
Charming GM (if you do get to meet him, you’d understand why the hotel offers such impeccable service and with such attention to details).

Conveniently located on a busy street (the 5th Ave. of Barcelona), the hotel is surprisingly quiet. Only 2 min. walk from both Gaudi-designed houses. Shops like Manolo, Adolfo, Tiffany, Zara, Armani, Hermes, Santa Eulalia, are all steps away. All rooms (we were there for a week and ended up staying in both a standard room and a Junior Suite), are generous in size and have large spa-like bathrooms. The rooms are mostly in white colors, but still feel very warm and welcoming. The rooms are so relaxing, I surprised myself by acting like a local, rushing back to the hotel every afternoon so I can take a long “siesta” in their heavenly beds and silky sheets. We stayed in a Suite facing the streets, but the windows are all so sound proofed, the room is very quiet.

Great view from the rooftop pool, but for laps and the most relaxing steams must try their basement pool next to the Spa area. 

Their bar serves the best martinis I’ve ever had, must try their signature Ginger martini. 
Unfortunately, their restaurant MOMENTS was closed during our stay for Summer holidays/renovation, so that gives me an excuse to return to the hotel very soon. 

Definitely my 1st choice in Barcelona and my favorite Mandarin Oriental hotel so far.",5,2011,10,10
44,"Well done, but too modern for my tastes","As a preface, I try to stay at top hotels (Ritz, 4 seasons) and expect to pay for service and comfort.  The Mandarin is in an EXCELLENT location is Barcelona.  You are right in the middle of shopping and a quick walk to the major attractions.  The Concierge was EXTREMELY helpful to prepare for our trip with dinner reservations and a Barcelona FC match.  They were very good.  The restaurant is wonderful.  Lunch was wonderful and breakfast was very good - expensive, but worth the cost.  The gym does not have a ton of options, but it is VERY clean and spacious.  My two gripes - the room was not ready and room size.  When you get off a flight from NYC, you want to take a shower.  I had reserved 2 rooms and neither was ready because a cruise was leaving from hotel.  They tried to work with me, but then said it would be 30 minutes.  It ended up being over one hour.  That is unacceptable, particularly because we reserved a pickup at the airport through the hotel.  They know when we were arriving.  This is a pet peeve of mine.  If you are prepared and happy to go out once you get there, then ignore the negative comment.  The room was very nicely appointed.  It is very high tech - offer convertors etc.  It is VERY modern.  The shower was a bit weird for me on wood planks, odd shower head, and handle shower thing.  There really is not much room at all and the bed is very low to the ground.  It was very nice, but not my style.  If it is yours, you will love it.  They have a great patio for cigars and tapas above the lobby - very nice.  You can also smoke tight outside bar banc in the hotel.  Very nice drinks there.  Overall, it is a very good hotel in a great location.  If you like modern hotels and don't mind the room being a bit small, then this is great.  Don't get me wrong, I would VERY likely stay here again because of location.  Yet, when you compare to Villa Magna in Madrid, there is not comparison.",4,2011,10,07
44,"Location,location,location","We stayed one night at this hotel.the room was booked through American Express Platinum.
The location:fabulous.It is located on the street with all the best shopping.
Service:this is the weakest of the hotel's assets. The check-in was ok,but there was not an upgrade available. The bell service was extremely slow. The service in the restaurant was extremely lax.
The room: immaculate and stark contemporary. It took me awhile to figure out how to open the shades and work the shower,but it was pretty nice once I discovered how everything worked and where to find things in the room.
The price:probably very expensive for Barcelona,but I would stay here again because it is a beautiful hotel in a fantastic location.

",5,2011,09,27
44,Nearly perfect,"The hotel is wonderfully situated on Barcelona's leading street for shopping and close to city center and most sites. It opened two years ago and is in a converted bank building that has been completely remodeled by one of the country's leading designers. Every inch is beautifully and sleekly designed; however, even the deluxe terrace room is a bit small. We chose the hotel because we heard it had the best concierge desk in the city.  We are not good about planning vacations, so we make heavy use of concierge services.  With the guidance of the concierge team we had six perfect days and nights on our first trip to BCN.  Because we booked through AmEx Platinum, breakfast at Blac each morning was included. It was a great was to start the day (but I might have felt otherwise if I'd been paying an additional 38 euros per person). The complimentary afternoon tea was also nice (but would have disappointed at the usual price). As mentioned in other reviews, there still seems to be an attempt to charge business travelers for wi-fi, but not casual tourist users. There are some other quirky policies like this (eg, a 4 euro supplement for a skewer with 4 strawberries at tea), which make you wonder about hotel management. The rooms seemed quite fully priced for the market, so one wonders about other nibbling.  Beware of the charge for cocktails on the roof (Two vodka and grapefruit juice clocked in at 50 euros, setting a new personal high for per drink charges). The fitness center is included without a supplemental charge and the steam room are quite nice, even though the gym is small and barely has what you need for a workout. Even though it is not a perfect hotel, it stll manages to produce a near perfect experience of Barcelona.  We will return.",5,2011,09,18
44,Perfection,"This hotel is amazing! The rooms are so beautiful and modern, the staff is so friendly, and the design of the hotel is to die for. Not recommendable for children though. This is more of a business or high end travel hotel. I really loved it!",5,2011,09,18
44,Magnificent Hotel in the Heart of the City,"Two adults and one child stayed in a lovely room set up with a Queen sized bed and a small single for the tot. A large decorated cookie was waiting for the little one when we arrived in the room.

Yes, the rooms are not huge but they are immaculate and include lovely amenities such as luxurious bath and spa products, slippers, robes, I-pod charger, shoe bags and turn down service in the evening.  The concierge was extremely helpful in assisting us with dinner reservations in a good restaurant overlooking the water.  The rooftop pool has an amazing view of the city at night.  

Very centrally located and near upscale shops and Los Ramblas, you can walk to many restaurants and shops within twenty minutes.",5,2011,09,07
44,AMAZING,"In a word, amazing. The Mandarin Oriental is a stunning hotel, beautifully decorated.  The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  Its location is what I would describe as the Fifth avenue of Barcelona, Tiffanys and Manolo Blahnik either side of the hotel and all the usual designer stores a stones throw away.
I believe you get what you pay for and the Mandarin Oriental is no exception.  
We had welcome drinks and tapas in the Bankers Bar one night which were tasty and, like everything about this hotel, beautifully presented.  
We had room service one of the nights of our stay and although the late night room service menu is limited enough (it was after 12 when we ordered) the food was excellent.
We didn't get to the spa which is disappointing but there was too much to do outside the hotel.  We did go up to the roof top terrace which has stunning views of the city, what a great place to watch the sun go down and enjoy a glass of cava.
The location of the hotel is excellent.  The tour buses stop right outside and across the road from the hotel.  The Casa Batllo is to the right a short walk up the road and Las Ramblas approximately a 10 minute walk.  It really is a great location.
Overall, I would recommend the hotel in a heartbeat",5,2011,09,05
44,"Location, thats about it!","We stayed at the Madarin Oriental in Barcelona to be in the ""pulse"" of the city, and because we heard it was a great hotel.  The reputation of the Oriental has always been a plus for us.  This property has been open for approx. 2 years, its a converted bank building.  I looked at three different rooms before deciding on the final room, believe me I am not fussy.  The first room felt like it was underground, on the first floor, 2nd room had no tub, just shower, and the third room was smaller than the other two.  The service is slow, the rooms are very contemporary, but not functional.  No shower door in bathroom, lousy lighting in the rooms, and just not what we expected from this property.  Went to the Arts and asked them to show us a room of our comparable rate.  What a beautiful property.  I would stay there next time for sure, and take cabs to the city center.  We had lunch at the Arts on the patio overlooking the water, and wonderful food and service.  We were also showed the Presidential Suite....Wow....",2,2011,09,01
44,Elegant and well located,"Yes, the rooms are on the small side, but they are modern and beautiful, and the hotel is very well situated (lovely part of town) and elegant. Breakfast was included with our room, and it was bountiful. We were very pleased with our stay and would recommend this hotel without hesitation.",5,2011,08,28
44,Best Hotel in Barcelona!!,"Ended our trip to Portugal and Spain at this gem.  Stayed in the Terrace Suite w/ connecting room for kids.  The service was fantastic, food was great and the facilities provided a quiet oasis in the Heart of Barcelona.  
The roof top soaking pool was great and the attendant was fun and attentive with the kids.  The pool and gym on the lower spa level were also great and necessary with all the eating that goes with a holiday!!
Our room was the priciest of the hotels we had stayed at on this trip, but the service and quality were commensurate.",5,2011,08,10
44,"Tried to love it....but couldn't, no matter how hard I tried.","I Love Mandarin Oriental hotels and this one has got to be the weakest one I have ever stayed in.  YES, they have very good service and lots of staff but after that???? not much.  This hotel CANNOT be compared to HKG, Bangkok,NY, London or Tokyo.

It's location is in the center of Barcelona and on the main street.  When we went looking for those little small ""finds"" Restaurants we like, we always ended up walking far away from the hotel which is really just a few blocks north of the touristy Ramblas.  This location is good and far more central then the Ritz or the W however still just misses being on a 6 lane main road.  

The Lobby, Bars and restaurants were fabulous form little function.  Sprayers in the hallways kept the scent of the hotel everywhere.  Our room was TINY with a large bathroom..This is really ridiculous as they built a huge atrium which could have been made smaller to give you more space in room, however they totally went for design..a poor choice in my opinion.  We had beautiful side lamps but the white bed and side tables are already showing many dings and dents and the room seemed claustrophobic, narrow.  This was the first time with this chain that I felt we paid for something we did not receive.  More a name ""Mandarin"" and less product. Prices for food and drink were standard Mandarin pricing, very highly priced,but good quality.   

This hotel had a colorful group of people staying there.  From Old Americans with lots of plastic surgery to Arabs with tons of kids everywhere.  Then there were people from Germany and France and Japan and China....a real interesting mix.  Except for the unruly kids we enjoyed the people watching over drinks or just sitting in the lobby.  The feel of this hotel for us was just ""cold"" which was strange as we love modern?

If you want to tell your friends you stayed at the Mandarin and take fashion photographs....this is your hotel.  Otherwise, in this range, this hotel doesn't measure up to much of the competition.  Will they remember your pillow favourites when you return...yes!  Can your room feel like a coffin....Yes!  This hotel is not a value hotel....it is a luxury chain and I felt they did a poor job from the design to execution. 

Barcelona is a fabulous city with many fabulous choices!   My suggestion is to find a fabulous hotel, book a suite with a terrace overlooking the city and sip champagne listening to the church-bells ring as you think of how much you love this city and your hotel....not this one.  Safe travels to all!",3,2011,08,06
44,"Great service, great location","The Mandarin is a refurbished old bank building in prime location for Barcelona shopping, eating and nightlife. The building has its limitations, however interesting it is the way they have solved the refurbishment. We think this is the reason for us being slightly disappointed in the room vs. the price they charge for it. We had a deluxe boulevard room facing Pg de Gracia, which we booked because their webpage said that ""some rooms with balcony"". Even if I asked about this at reservation, ours werent one of those. The way the windows are constructed, starting 1,5 meters up from the floor, gave the room a ""bunker"" feeling. You had to stand on your toes to see anything out of the window. The bathroom is huge, but with a coloured wall and door system, that does not close all the way, it is less than privatre (sometimes designers need to calm down a bit!)  Having said that, the quality of the materials are excellent, sleek and mondern! 

The service are excellent, beautiful and friendly people everywhere ! The pool on the roof is not really a pool, just 40cm deep, and there are only 6-8 sun beds for those that would like to work that tan. The ""poolboy"" Nathan, was very friendly and very well-informed about Barcelona. They do have a nice spa in the basement, with a large indoor pool and a nice gym,  for those that want to work that body.  

The Bankers bar made very good coctails, and the old bank box theme made a great ambience!  The garden was nice, but the surrounding buildings are not to the same standard as the Mandarin, which makes the feeling a bit ""roustic"". Good DJ and nice drinks there as well. 

The hotel is great for shopping and doing the major sites incl. nightlife. We have been to BCN many times and stayed at this hotel for the easy access to nightlife and shopping. 

Then; free internet - come on! this is a luxury hotel, and they still have the audacity to charge for Internet!!! Ok, we did get one day free, but got charged in any case for other days. It seemed to be dependent on who you asked. Very anoying.",4,2011,08,05
44,wow - the only game in town!,"gorgeous hotel - very attentive staff - wonderful outdoor bar - Mimosa
near everything -totally enjoyed it
a respite far from the madding crowd - worth the splurge!
love the butler who brought cocktails complimentary every day!",5,2011,07,31
44,Nice service / small room,"Was there last weekend for two nights.
Good point : 
Staff / service is great
restaurants are good
Location perfect.
Spa is nice.

Cons: 
Room are so small (i had deluxe terrasse) and the view is not nice.
You must book a suite.
You can hear the door when the guest close the next door, incredible for this kind of hotel....
Bad smell in the bath.

Next time i ll try other hotelto see the difference",3,2011,07,29
44,Elegant and stylish but friendly and welcoming too. A great experience.,"We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona. The position of the hotel is wonderful. It is within walking distance of many sights but also has a tourist bus stop right outside the hotel which is great. The staff are excellent. My 14 year old son is learning Spanish in school and the staff were really welcoming and encouraging when he ordered in Spanish and made him feel great about trying to speak it. The concierge service was excellent too and we went to a super Flamenco show (again, 10 minutes walk from the hotel) and then on to try paella at one of their recommended restaurants (again super). We had a complimentary drink at the Bankers' Bar which the children really enjoyed. Breakfast every day at Blanc was lovely, very fresh and lots of choice. The waiters and waitresses couldn't have been more helpful or friendly.  Our room overlooked the main street but was not particularly noisy and it was fun to look out and see what was going on. I suppose it was small but that didn't bother us. If I went back to Barcelona, I wouldn't stay anywhere else.",5,2011,07,20
44,Fair. No big deal,"The rooms are small and many have no bathtubs,only showers. Be sure to ask before you make a reservation.  The shower soaks the bathroom floor,so put a towel down to catch the water.
Tea was a disaster at 25 euros a person. Poor service and a lack food. We constantly had to ask for tea sandwiches as none we on the buffet. No silverware was on the table, so we tok it from an empty table.
We were told the room was soundproff. Forget it. Every street noise came thru the window,causing a poor nights sleep 
Internet service horribly expensive
Having stayed in the San Francisco Mandarin over 20 times and the London hotel we found the Barcelona Mandarinonly fair. 
Be aware. If ultra modern is not for you, forget this hotel .
Robert S",3,2011,06,25
44,Expensive? Sure! Worth it? Absolutely!,"This is In the busy part of the city, where all the Madison Ave or Rodeo Drive shops are.  Don't let it intimidate you. It's a short walk to Las Ramblas, the red on/off bus stops in front of the hotel and rooms (mine) overlooked a Gaudi masterpiece. Service was extraoridinary. the included breakfast was both buffet and everything on the menu, serverd in a delightful restaurant.
  A warning, the Michelin starred restaurant  in the hotel is overpriced and under special. there are so many good ones withing walking distance, skip the hotel restaurants, except for athe excellent breakfast.

There's a very good Italian restaurant, diagonally across the stree on the corner.   Prices are moderate, and food delish.",5,2011,06,13
44,Fantastic location,"Had a great stay for 3 nights. Great location for all the main attractions. 

We stayed in a delux room, with an amazing shower. The bed was very comfy with crisp linen sheets. The electronics in the room were great could attach iPad/iPhone to tv speakers. 

Only comment the price was about €100 over priced for the hotel",5,2011,06,09
44,Avoid if possible,"The hotel is converted from a bank a year ago fairlly new. Stuff was quite unexperianed . Rooms were very small. Bathroom was a disaster. Open door showers  sliding window seprators after every shower water was in the bedroom.  We were trying to dry the floors so our belongings won't get wet. Breakfast was not worth the price . First morning we had to wait 25 minutes for our tea.when it arived breakfast was over. Our waitress sad she only had 2 hands when we complaind. Consinage was helpfull beyond expectations when asked find out he was transferd from London. Spa pool gym was excallent .  The general managment tryed to compansate the the best they can. However , it was annoying constantly complaining. Sincerely we picked the hotel thinking it is one of the best chains not worth the price I won't stay in this chain ever again even if it is free.",3,2011,04,09
44,Lovely hotel in perfect location.,"We stayed at the lovely new Mandarin Oriental and we impressed by its location, its rooms are not large, but very comfortable and well maintained.  We found the room lighting switching was a little confusing to find where the switches were located and how they worked, but were impressed with the technology of it all.  You don't need adaptors, they are supplied, and a USB charger is built right into the console along with other plugs.  The shower was constantly great.  The automatic window blind system was easy to use and was very dark - kept the light out completely so much so that we overslept for our flight home.  There was no clock in our room.

The dining rooms and Bankers' Bar were great places to wine and dine.  The food slections were good (not great) but expensive.  And talking about expensive .. the laundry service is good but the prices are rediculously high.  We had been sprayed with excrement while out walking, then robbed (I will put a note on another page about Barcelona), so we had to put our clothes into the laundry service for cleaning.  A pair of cotton sox cost 6Euros to wash!  They cost less to buy!  We should have thown them out.

Overall I would highly recomment this hotel, not only for all its attributes, but the staff are the best we have ever encountered.  They are highly professional, helpful beyond all expectations.  Nothing was too much trouble to find out for us, or to help us when we were robbed.",5,2011,04,09
44,"cool, contemporary, and beautiful","Located in an old bank on the prime part of passeig de gracia (flanked by tiffany and brioni), this hotel is relatively new- some cab drivers were unfamiliar with it.  nevertheless, it is pretty stunning eye candy to behold: the walk up the bridge, the enclosed atrium overlooking the restaurant, the banker's bar.  

The neighborhood is comparable to being on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, or Central Park South in NYC.  It is within a 10-12 minute walk of Las Ramblas and Barri Gotic.  The subway system is nice, clean, and fast, and conveniently located about 2 minutes from the hotel front door- highly recommended if you get tired of walking.

The service was typical for an MO: pretty fast, relatively quiet and discreet.  The concierges were very good for the most part, especially Albert (there's a tapas bar around the corner, Tapas 24, that is highly recommended as a place to start: casual and tourist-friendly, but still very good and serviceable tapas- they are also open at ""non typical"" times.)  The maid service was outstanding.

There's a small but well appointed fitness room with bikes and treadmills, some freeweights, and that's about it.  There's a nice lap pool next to it with showers, sauna etc.  Access is free.  The spa (and its services), however, is the opposite of free, which is why we skipped it.  There is a gorgeous infinity pool on the 9th floor along with a lovely terrace with a commanding view of Barca.  It was empty, probably since we were there off season, but I'd highly recommend going up there in the summer.

We had a terrace room on the 5th floor.  The room, by european standards, was pretty spacious, with a couch and desk.  The bathroom was very narrow, resulting in the bath/shower positioned immediately adjacent to my wife's side of the bed.  The toilet is located in a separate very small room next to the front door.  

Be warned that there is a school behind the hotel; if you are there during the regular school year, it kind get a little loud in the morning as well as deep into the evening- kids playing basketball and soccer in an enclosed playground in the back of the school.  The noise echoes off of all the surrounding buildings.  Not terrible but definitely noticeable, especially if you are trying to relax and enjoy your patio with a glass of cava and a book.

Breakfast buffet was very good- it came with our package.  I don't know that I would have been willing to pay nearly 30 euros for it.  Wireless internet access was egregiously expensive- this is a pet peeve of mine.  It is utterly ridiculous that they charge 9 euros/hour (!!!), considering the room rates.

What I would NOT hesitate to spend vast quantities of euros on, is dinner at Commerc 24.  A singular dining experience that is not to be missed.  Trust the sommelier and waiters: tell them what you want and don't want to eat, then sit back and relax.  It was an incredible experience and comparable to (although distinct from) Alinea, Robuchon, and French Laundry (C24 is not nearly as formal but every bit as delicious and unique).

All in all, The MO is a very luxurious, well located, very comfortable but expensive hotel to base your barcelona adventure.",5,2011,03,31
44,Great location and service,"The location is perfect for walking in the city centre, close to shops and restaurants and a peaceful oasis to return to.
I arrived after 3pm but the room was not ready and reception were initially unwilling to give a reason. I asked to see the reception manager who explained the problem, upgraded the room and agreed to my request to include breakfast at the original rate.
The terrace room was lovely although the lighting system is way too complicated and too much time was spent trying to work it out (I never did).
The bankers bar is a must, good atmosphere and helpful staff.
On checkout, the bill had seven items  - only five were mine.
Otherwise I would recommend the hotel - overall the service is very good and staff always greet guests by name. Top class.",4,2011,03,24
44,"Terrible, unbearable noise in the rooms facing the back.","I'm staying right now in room 215 and the street noise is absurd. On top of that, this line is next to the service door and they slam it every time. If you want to rest, pick another hotel.",3,2011,03,19
44,Exceeded Our Expectations,"My husband and I just returned from 6 nights at the beautiful Mandarin Oriental on the Passeig de Gracia in Barcelona.  From the moment that our taxi pulled up in front of the hotel, until the moment it pulled away to bring us back to the airport at the end of our stay, the level of service we experienced at this hotel exceeded what we have experienced even in some of the finest hotels and resorts in Asia. 

The hotel is staffed by some of the most charming, attractive, smiling young people who greeted us by name, remebered our likes and dislikes, and generally made sure that we were always happy and well taken care of.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found that most everyone I encountered speaks English quite well, with the exception, perhaps of some of the housekeeping staff.

The Bankers Bar in the lobby was a great spot, and although the service was a bit slow the evening we were there, the beautiful surroundings and the great scene more than made up for it.     We can't imagine staying anywhere else in Barcelona.",5,2011,02,09
44,Understated opulence,"Mid 30s professional couple from Australia. 
Stayed here for a conference trip and definitely most memorable hotel for our 3 week trip. Everything from the room to the gym were well built and stylish. The service was only very slightly hampered by lack of english by some staff, but this was usually quickly solved by asking for a more senior member of staff, at all times with patience and sincerity. 
Check in was speedy and we were escorted to room and everything explained. Baggage staff at the front of hotel were prompt and willing with a smile. 
We had a garden view room which overlooked the local school's basketball courts and unless you were REALLY serious about siesta, then this made no impact on the tranquility of the room at night. The room was fashionable, as is expected of MO, with a very modern style shower. The lighting is completely adaptable to personal needs at night, and the electronic curtains are light proof for the day. The lampshade would be right at home in a designer warehouse. Pillow menus will make anyone feel at home. Room turn down nightly by the room service staff, who make up for their lack of english, by  their beaming smiles and the pride they take in their work. The flatscreen TV was good quality, but the signal frequently dropped out and that needs some attention. The movie selection is also slightly outdated. The bed was comfortable enough, but users of plush matresses will find it not quite as good as would be expected of a hotel of this calibre. The other thing missing is free WiFi, which you would expect when you are paying this much. 

By far the best breakfasts in a 3 week trip were eaten in the hotel's Blanc restaurant. Although sparse in terms of variety both in terms of day to day, and in terms of overall choice, the quality of the food is second to none. The restaurant staff also remembered our name by sight which was a pleasant surprise. Blanc restaurant for dinner is also very good, but I expected more. The food was above average, but if you are looking to have your socks blown off, then maybe look at Moments restaurant. The sommelier however was knowledgable, spoke good english, helpful and also provided a free glass of wine!

The room service meals were directly from the hotels restaurants and they arrive promptly in a trolley that has a small enclosure beneath the trolley bench top, which keeps the food warm. The quality is also impeccable, but you pay for the quality.  

The gym is small but well equipped with modern machines. We went there every morning at 6am, and sometimes before (jet lag), and had the place to ourselves. But I can imagine that during the day, it could get quite packed. The rooftop dipping pool was undergoing renovations when we were there, so that was a huge disappointment. 

The location is not right in the middle of the city, but not far, which is what we wanted. The location is smack in the middle of the most magical street in barcelona, Passeig de Gracia where you will find the famous Casa Batllo almost directly opposite the hotel and La Pedrera is only 10 mins walk. The street is dotted with Gaudi features, and you only need to walk out the front door to experience the magic. For those wanting the bus top tours, the bus stop is directly outside the hotel, and the subway station is just one block away. 

Overall, would definitely come back to stay here if I was in Barcelona again.",5,2011,01,29
44,Excellent overall--a few flaws,"Arrived late afternoon to no doormen or reps at sidewalk or entry ramp to hotel. Carried own luggage into reception.(The attractive, smiling bellmen remained a non-existent or poorly timed service throughout check-in, room transfer, taxi assistance, and check-out---this needs significant monitoring and improvement.)
We were given upper floor room (no Virtuoso upgrades available) with very small window and a noisy neighbor above (despite check-in requests for a quiet room away from louder guests; clerk seemed confused between street noise, which I assured him was not bothersome to me, and guest noise). Rooms are well designed and ample (Deluxe Blvd) with cool, retro decor, fun bathroom, everything new and clean (lighting controls not so user friendly or flexible, though). That evening we asked for room with larger window or step out balcony (away from noisy neighbor above), and were told daytime staff would attempt a switch the next morning. To our surprise, without further mention, we were contacted the next morning by front desk, who located balcony rooms we could choose from and switched us. Kudos to the lovely and efficient Alba, who got us into a much better room--and helped us move (we moved ourselves; bellmen too busy/slow again). 
Enjoyed very nice buffet and special order breakfast (included in our rate) each morning in fun, airy dining/bar area but had unacceptably slow beverage service the first two mornings, despite pleasant wait staff (a problem somewhere in the kitchen/bar).
Overall, this is a really lovely property with excellent rooms, generally good service, in the best possible location for anyone wanting to be in the middle of the best part of BCN and willing to pay for it. If you want excellent light and decent views of some of this fabulous city's famous architecture and vibrant street scene, get a balcony room facing Paseo de Gracia, where you can step out and take in one of the world's great, elegant boulevards.",4,2011,01,08
44,Spectacular hotel in every way.,"Stayed here with a friend for a spontaneous pre-Christmas getaway.  The service here is outstanding -- I've never seen anything like it.  Simon was an incredible concierge -- got us tickets to the best soccer rivalry match in town, knew where to find the perfect churros con chocolate and had unbelieveable tapas recommendations.  We ate in one night at the hotel restaurant -- I think it's called Blanco -- and the wait staff showered us with attention, generous glasses of rioja and plenty of free tapas.  And the food was out of this world.  Great location, beautifully decorated, great value, very clean, very quiet.  I will return.",5,2011,01,08
44,A real nightmare,"Have already been a happy guest to other Mandarin Oriental hotels and therefore decided to book this brand new Mandarin in Barcelona. Booked a Terrace Suite for a daily rate of 2.900 euro, expecting obviously a perfect stay. It's a design hotel but unfortunately the designer who did it totally lacked practical sense. The suite is made by a living room and a bedroom which are not separated by concrete walls but by glass, so that if your wife sleeps in the bedroom and you decide to stay in the living room, it will be impossible for her to sleep because the light will pass from one room to the other. The room, the wardrobe and the bathroom are full of sensors, so that if you wake up in the night from the bed, the light in the wardrobe will suddenly switch on therefore waking up also the other person. On top of that we had huge problems during our stay which made impossible to sleep : the light in the second bathroom kept on switching on and off by itself all the night long and the hotel maintenance was not able to fix it. Moreover, the electric curtains in the bedroom suddenly went up early in the morning whilst we were sleeping. The hotel maintenance ""discovered"" that it was due to the fact that an hotel guest staying in a room below our could open not only his but also our electric curtains with his remote control. Only solution seems to negotiate with the other guest the wake up call....
Staff was totally inadequate and unprofessional as well as unable to deal with such problems. Final result was 11.000 euro spent for 4 nights without being able to sleep. Mandarin Oriental top management should fire this people and may rebuild the hotel with less technology and more cleverness.. Keep away from Mandarin Oriental",1,2011,01,06
44,Paradise... in 50 square metres,"This hotel is amazing - the service was top notch! Breakfast was delicious there was a huge buffet with tasteful interior and with comfy seating. The pool was spectacular in its positioning, it was on the rooftop of the hotel. You could see the whole of Barcelona!

The rooms were gorgeous, the pillows fluffy - Big TV's clean bathrooms!

I loved my stay! And you will too!",5,2011,01,02
44,"Love the Mandarin, great experience","This is a really nice hotel. Very spacious, modern and comfortable room. The bathroom was the best I have ever seen. Staff were nice enough- not overly friendly but decent enough. The room was very clean, quiet, and modern. The bed was very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was delicious. The hotel staff was very helpful, professional, and friendly.
Only recommendations.",5,2010,12,08
44,Misses the mark,"This hotel missed the mark for us with indifferent service from the front desk and restaurant staff. The concierge staff were great with planning dinners and trips.The hotel also lacked a business center and Ipod chargers in rooms both of which are important to us. When I asked for a ipod charger they said they had none as previous guests had not returned them so they were not bringing anymore in. They were helpful in directing me to a store where I could purchase one. Instead of a business center they gave me a dated Dell laptop that took 5 minutes to boot up and you are to use sitting  in the middle of a very busy lobby with no access to a printer.. The front desk manager told me they had been requesting a business center from the hotel since opening but MO head office would not approve the funds . The real deal breaker was the room a Junior Suite on a lower floor that we were given. While lovely we were awakened all night long from street noise. We asked for a change of room for our last 3 nights but were told that it was impossible. Not something I wanted to hear when paying 800 Euros a night.. We left the hotel early and stayed elsewhere. Having stayed in Mo properties in Munich. Prague, Vegas, San Fran and London this year we were surprised by the indifferent attitude of some of the staff at the MO Barcelona.",3,2010,11,10
44,Wonderful place to stay in Barcelona,"Recently stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona.  It was our last stop of a 2 week Spain trip and it couldn't have ended any better.  Great location on Passeig de Gracia.  Beautiful hotel, clean and spacious rooms, attentive and caring staff.  We booked the room through Am Ex fine hotels and resorts which included daily breakfast, an afternoon tea, and late checkout.   
When checking in, the receptionist noticed my birthday on my passport and realized I would be actually having my birthday during my stay there. The first evening in our room they sent up a bottle of sparkling wine to say happy birthday and they sent up a chocolate cake the second night with happy birthday written on it.  Very nice touch!
The neighborhood directly around the hotel is really nice.   You can spend several days walking all the nearby streets with their shops, restaurants, and cafe's.  Easy access to the subway is a plus too.  Only a  5 - 10 minute walk from Las Ramblas. 
The only real complaint would have to be that in room wifi internet access is an extra charge.  For a 400+ euro/nt room starting, it should really be included.
Every employee at the hotel treated us very friendly and with our needs being their most important concern.  It was sad when we had to check out......
We would definately stay there again.",5,2010,11,02
44,Architectural gem with world famous hospitality,"Loved this hotel for the beautiful interior design of the lobby, the sauna area (even if a little less for the rooms which are too small and not too user friendly). Still it's a definite must for architects and fans of designs. Love the concierge services, they know everything and can book you almost everything and are more than willing to help with a smile ! The location is also great as it is so near to Gaudi's works. 

The only downside is the limited parking space and the difficulty in getting continued internet access (they give you by the day which has to be renewed every 24 hrs). Other than that if you are not driving in barcelona and a bit of money to spend for a luxury treat, go for it.",5,2010,10,19
44,Almost perfection,"The rooms are superb, although bathrooms a little small. Modern, totally up to date and look almost new. The staff is impecabble and does everything to help during your stay. Rooms come with B&O TV and stereo. Building next door was being rennovated so a little noisy during the day. You might want to check if the construction is over or request to stay on other side of hotel.

Ate at the restaurants and the food and service were superb. Location is extremely convenient and centrally located to metro stops and sightseeing bus service. Next time in Barcelona will be back at this hotel. There is a W which is on the seaport directly overlooking the water but location is very inconvenient unless you are going to hit the beach scene every day.

Be careful in Barcelona unfortunately leading city in pickpockets and petty street crime. Do not wander off the main streets.",5,2010,10,14
44,Great Hotel!,"Hello, This hotel the Mandarin in Barcelona was great! We had a wonderful time and felt we were in a luxurious environment that wasn't too cold! I really recommend spending the extra  money and staying there! It was an excellent choice!

44,Heart-of-the-City Perfection on Passeig de Gracia!,"On the same street as two of Gaudi's masterful buildings, La Pedrera and Casa Batilo', this uber-chic, modern hotel offers warm service and immaculate, sophisticated comforts. Our room on floor 2 offered a balcony for enjoying the sights of the Gaudi building across the street and the active bustle of the city below... the location was perfect for strolling and taxis were plentiful and available throughout the city. (They are, by the way, the most educated group of drivers we have found ANYwhere-- lovely Catalans!)  Our room was not large, but every luxury was provided, (with the exception of free wi-fi, which was only provided in the lobby and restaurant-- what an inconvenience!)  and we were completely content. Breakfast in the restaurant below was a huge, beautiful buffet boasting the same warm, caring service as the rest of the hotel. Bravo!",5,2010,10,09
44,"Excellent hotel, service could be better","The hotel could not have a better location, it's very well designed, modern and beautiful.  Rooms and amenities are great, shower did not drain well enough so bathroom got flooded two times, this really needs improvement.  Our room had a great tub and we really enjoyed it.  Room service was excellent, great wines at very reasonable prices.  I would be raving about the hotel if not for one detail which, although fairly small, speaks volumes about the real commitment to service:

One night we were leaving the hotel and it was raining really hard, pouring is more like it; the hotel always provides umbrellas for guests of course, we had taken one during the day and returned it when coming back.  I asked for an umbrella and they told me they were freshly out of them, there was no way we could walk without an umbrella so I insisted and they said no more umbrellas.  I went to the front desk to ask for help getting one and they told me sorry but they ran out of them, I was a bit incredulous and insisted, asking if there was not one more umbrella in the whole place and they said no.  So I called our friends to pick us up, and while waiting for them, five minutes later, they got some more umbrellas out of storage.  I was really annoyed, because I specifically had asked if there had no more, even in storage and they said no.  This shows that they really don't care for the guests, so even though the place is great and I would return, Mandarin Oriental still has a long way to go until they can compete with Four Seasons on service.  I do not mind paying top dollar but I do expect great service and they are lacking.",4,2010,10,02
44,"Great location, great sleep, awesome spot","Stayed Sept 8-12 at the Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona and thoroughly enjoyed it.  First night the gorgeous and large with flat marble floor shower did not drain but engineering came immediately and fixed it.  The mezzarine outdoor lounge/bar was wonderful and quiet, the rooftop pool was equally great and had amazing view of city and the Sagrada Familia.  Beautiful breakfast every morning, Zero street noise and dark room with the motorized shades at night, best linens in the universe.  Like too many 5 star hotels the lighting in bathrooms is too dim but that's a smallish thing. Bankers Bar is also a good spot for a night cap and open late when we wanted to leave El Born district. Modern rather than traditional but it is a great hotel!",5,2010,09,21
44,"Very Chic, but, well...","This hotel's location can not be beat! Just blocks away from the Barri Gotic and the Placa Catalunya, there is much to do and see near and around this hotel.  The staff was wonderful and the concierge was very accommodating and helpful in assisting us with directions and taxi services.

Although this is a new hotel, I thought it was beginning to show signs of wear and tear, which was a little disappointing considering the cost of our stay.  (We recently stayed at a Mandarin Oriental in Miami, and was very impressed with how new and well maintained the hotel was).  The carpeting is beginning to look a little ragged and the furniture in our room had many nicks and dings.  It wasn't that obvious, but noticeable enough to me. The shower was beautiful and unique in design, and the bath amenities were wonderful.

Like many European hotels, there isn't much room to navigate.  If you are looking for spacious, this is not it.  The lobby is extremely small, and seems a bit oppressive.  I felt a little cramped waiting in there for my room to be ready.   On the other hand, the rooms are attractive and the balconies are a nice addition, but again, not what I would call 5 star accommodations.

I think overall this hotel is adequate, but does not exceed expectations.",3,2010,09,20

44,Exceptional Hotel,Beautiful hotel.  While on the expensixe side it was a very comfortable stay.  The room met all of our needs in terms of comfort and amenities.  Hotel is located in a very central location making it easy to get around.,5,2010,09,15
44,Great.,"Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is newly opened (November 2009) deluxe hotel in Barcelona. Its location is perfect! Just opposite the Casa Battlo, one of Gaudi's best works and is 5 minutes from Plaça Catalunya & La Rambla. Hotel is relatively small, with only 98 rooms and is hidden behind some boring facade of an old bank which could not be reconstructed due to its historical value. Anyhow, inside the hotel, nothing is boring :-). Hotel has very nice bar called,  Bankers Bar, with old deposit boxes still inside the walls, has two very nice inside restaurants and one outside bar/restaurant (with beautiful garden). We were accommodated in Deluxe Boulevard room (facing Passeig de Gracia) which was very nice (but a little bit small for deluxe hotel/room) and quite. Room was equipped with everything that you need (and don’t need), beside TV and DVD it had all possible cables so that you can connect any piece of hi tech device that you might have with TV.
We loved roof top pool which, even with only 50cm of dept, provided to us excellent opportunity for chilling out, getting some color and gave nice view on the city. Small problem with roof pool is that there is no toilet, so you must go back to your room if needed...
All in all, Mandarin Oriental Barcelona is excellent hotel in perfect location with great service.",5,2010,08,15
44,Chic and serene,"In the thrilling city of Barcelona it is nice to be able to retreat occasionally to a quiet and comfortable place, and the Mandarin Oriental celebrates Barcelona's great sense of style but with every comfort you could imagine. The restaurant Moments is sublime, and the spa is wonderful. The service is brilliant throughout the hotel.",5,2010,06,26
44,Magical Mandarin... as always.,"Being from Hong Kong, it was interesting to see how the brand reinterpreted its Asian roots within Barcelona.  Brand-wise, it reminded us more of Landmark Mandarin Oriental.  It was very contemporary, the service was excellent, the breakfast was amazing.  My boyfriend was ill, and they were extremely helpful and accommodating.  Only drawback is the price of course - everything is very expensive, as expected.  But it's worth it!",5,2010,06,26
44,Ultra-modern hotel in the swish part of Eixample,"The Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona is a very new property – slick and ultramodern inside the shell of a former bank on Passeig de la Gracia in the middle of Eixample, the so-called “extension” of the old city of Barcelona.  We were there on holidays, and its location is outstanding for tourists – you can walk to the Barri Gotic (the old town) in about ten minutes, and you are within walking distance of most of the Gaudi houses (across the road) and the Sagrada Familia (20 mins).   The third big location, Montjuic, can be reached from the nearby metro station, with the cost of the funicular railway included in the ticket.

Both the public areas of the hotel and the rooms reflect the best of modern design.  We stayed in a Mandarin terrace room – worth the extra.  It had a separate toilet, bathroom, two vanities and a magnificent shower, which sprang from a light in the ceiling.  With reference to other comments, we had no problems with flooding, but I can see how it might happen.  The room itself was the ultimate in sophisticated, modern design – a real delight.  

The hotel staff were marvellous, particularly the concierge staff, for whom nothing was too much trouble.  They organised an outstanding guide for the Gaudi monuments on 12 hours notice, selected four superb restaurants for us, three of which were absolutely stunning, printed airline boarding passes and did God knows what else.  It was also wonderful on arrival to be whisked into the bar for two complimentary cavas.  It has a well equipped fitness centre and a delightful indoor pool, as well as a spa (the latter not tried).

Two criticisms, one of which would be easy to fix.   The rooms have limited hanging space and virtually no drawer space for clothes.  It’s fine if you’re there for a long weekend, but if you’re on a three week trip around Europe as we were, it’s a disaster.  We had bags all over the room.  The other issue is the technology.  There are plugs and leads and connections all over the place, but the TV didn’t work.  We arranged for it to be fixed and finally could use it on the last night, but the signal was appalling with the picture freezing on all channels constantly.  There were no instructions as to how to use the phone – you had to guess the number for an outside line.  You could connect your computer to the TV – in theory only.  The hotel has not been open long, and one would hope that they’ll fix the electronics problem.  The bigger bother is the hanging space.",4,2010,06,11
44,"Polite staff, nice hotel, too many hidden costs","Stayed at this hotel in mid-may 2010 for an extended weekend and can only testify of a mixed experience. The hotel itself is smaller than anticipated, with no real lounge to speak of. The staff were courteous upon arrival and throughout our stay. We received complimentary drinks at the hotel bar before being checked into our room. And then the surprises began. 

We waited 30 minutes for our suitcase to be brought up - which after a long trip and at that late hour was quite unpleasant - and discovered that we could not connect to the internet from our room without some sort of password because their system of logging in with your name and room number wasn't working. Thankfully, a staff member helped us retrieve a password and the first 24 hours of wireless internet connectivity were on the house. Up to this point, it had been our understanding that the internet in the rooms was free. We were told it was only free in the lounge, which is, as previously mentioned, the small area between the concierge's desk and reception, with four couches and completely in the way of anyone coming in. 

Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was poor quality. The tomato and olive bread was soggy and stale, the croissants were a day old and the price was exorbitant. We made the mistake of taking breakfast in our room on the second day and the price for a continental breakfast for one person came up to 60 euros! Lunch on their terrace is the only redeeming quality of their restaurant service. The tapas were excellent and we were lucky to be there on a Sunday so that kids playing games on the immediately adjacent basketball/football court next door did not bother us - as we noticed on our last day that they were so loud we could hear them in our room, with the windows closed. 

It is undeniable that the rooms are trendy and fashionable and done up to a high standard. The decor is clever and modern and the room was very much to our tastes. However, the bathroom doesn't allow for much privacy as the sliding tinted glass doors do not close fully. On the other hand, the array of toiletries offered was very good. 

All in all, the hotel offers an interesting location, within walking distance of Las Ramblas and many Gaudi sights, but the high price of the rooms does not justify all the additional high costs that pop up as one makes uses of services which one might have presumed to be complimentary.",3,2010,05,20
44,"Great location, amazing attention to detail, very small rooms","The hotel location is wonderful as is the rooftop dippiong pool area, BUT it is the only place really other than the bar or restaurant where you can sit, so if the weatgher is bad, and it was when we were there, you are really stuck in your bedroom, which is small.  The bathrooms also have no real privacy, which when travelling with a friend, is not very convenient.  It is a pricey hotel, and we decided to treat ourselves, but now wish we had gone for something with more space.  Have stayed in 3 other Mandarins, and they have all been really spacious, love the one in Hong Kong and London, so was expecting the same.  The foosd though is brilliant.",4,2010,05,16
44,Best service in years,"Was booked into the Mandarin in Barcelona by work and didn't really have any expectations. However this is a great hotel. It's got all the usual stuff you would expect but the best bit is the staff who have a wonderful knack of being incredibly friendly, helpful and natural without being obsequious. They were utterly delightful.",5,2010,05,11
44,"Great hotel, excellent staff.","My wife and I have just returned from a 5 night break over the May day weekend.
The reservation was booked through Amex FHR and we arrived a little early to check in.
The room was not quite ready and we left our bags with reception and went to explore the city and a late lunch. We returned just before 4.30 to find still no room, eventually we  unpacked our suitcase around 6.30.
These things happen and the whote delay was dealt with in a very professional manner and I did not push the point.
From the Bell boy all the way up the staff were fantastic, this I beleive is what makes the hotel.
The weather took a turn for the worse and meant we took full advantage of the Bankers bar, room service and both the garden and resturant.
The only issue I had was mystery items popping onto my bill, again this was dealt with to my satisfaction.
The only real gripe is the shower is not usable and floods the bathroom floor, this was news to the staff, but i have seen comments before.
To my surprise the hotel even though quite new was starting to become a little grubby and some fixtures were slightly damaged.
As a glass half full kind of a guy, these little wrinkles are overlooked and I will use the Mandarin for my next visit.",5,2010,05,08
44,"Great Location, Small rooms","This is a tough one – This Mandarin Oriental has so many plusses and minuses:

 The staff is friendly and kind and they try very hard to be helpful, but some staff simply is not all that well trained or knowledgeable.  But, that’s management’s fault.

The concierges need to get a better feel for the city and there can be quite a lineup of guests awaiting assistance. However, they go out of their way to be helpful and provide assistance. You could not ask for a more generous staff throughout the hotel.
 
The in-room check in is a nice idea, but the person who checked us in to our room didn’t show us how to operate anything in the room, which was extremely high tech.  I have a feeling that was because she didn’t know how to operate the various gadgets. On the plus side, the rooms have all the necessary plugs and connectors in a nicely packaged box, however the plug location behind the desk made it very difficult to charge electronics.

Our room was extremely small with only one drawer in the closet; even the nightstands have no drawers.  As we were staying for 5 nights and are traveling for two months, this made for a difficult stay.  There was no room to store luggage or clothes.

Again, on the plus side, the breakfast was excellent and the breakfast staff was amazingly good.

Here’s the dilemma, if you like to get fresh air and keep your windows/doors open, you need to have a room on the courtyard side – half the rooms are on a main road, the other half on the courtyard.  But, by about 8:30 am the schoolyard, which these rooms overlook, comes alive and there’s no chance of sleeping and the playground can stay active until well past 8 pm.   In addition, we had jackhammers beginning at 8 am so the hotel could finish the Mimosa garden (now complete).  However, if you prefer air conditioning, the rooms can be relatively quiet with your windows/doors closed.

The design of the hotel is imaginative and quite impressive, but it is simply not functional.  The location of the hotel is spectacular, but we just don’t think it’s worth the price if you are paying rack. In addition, the Internet costs at about $35 US for 24 hours and the parking, which approaches $60 US per night, are ridiculously high—verging on the absurd,",4,2010,05,06
44,"Perfect Location, Great Service","Forget about the Ritz-Carlton -  The Mandarin has it all - great location, quiet, discreet service. Sure, it doesn't have a Club Level, but, quite frankly, you're in Barcelona - Tapas Bars and great restaurants are everywhere! - Cal Pep, Xampanyet, Dry Martini - lots of power outlets with US and European plugs, if you go through Amex Platinum / Centurion, then you get the upgrades and free breakfast.

One word of caution - this is a small, European hotel - the rooms ARE on the smaller side.",5,2010,05,03
44,"Great Hotel, Fabulous Service, Brilliant Position","I stayed here with my wife for 2 nights and have to say it is one of the best hotels that we have ever stayed in anywhere. The service was just fantastic and nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff who genuinely seemed anxious to be as helpful as possible at all times.  The decor is modern chic and we were extremely happy with our room which although not huge had everything that we could possibly want. The position in my view cannot be bettered - near enough to easily reach the centre on foot but not so close that you bump into other tourists when you walk out of the door. Breakfasts were terrific - and the high tea was marvellous. If I am being really ""picky"" (and in fairness I am struggling a bit here)  then I would have to say that the food we had for dinner in the more ""casual"" restaurant was a bit pretentious but that is the only minor criticism I can come up with. Overall this is a great hotel and I would not hesitate to stay here again and/or recommend it to anyone.",5,2010,04,08
44,When perfect style meets Mandarin Oriental service...,"I've stayed at a number of Mandarin Orientals but this is definitely the most stylish one. Spanish designer Patricia Urquiola did an exceptionally great job!!! The hotel only opened in December 2009 but the system is already perfectly running.
In the best location of Barcelona (Passeig de Gràcia), next door to Gaudi buildings, exquisite shopping and great restaurants you'll find a tranquil, stylish and charming island in hectic Barcelona. Night life and harbor are also close bye and in walking distance.
We stayed three nights over Easter in a Mandarin Terrace room (514) which was superbly furnished and totally quiet. The restaurant Blanc (for breakfast, lunch and dinner) is one of the nicest and well decorated restaurants I've ever eaten at.  We just had the longest breakfasts in the mornings since the atmosphere is so great and the waiters so charming. The staff is not only very good looking but warmhearted and always with a smile. Even though the hotel was fully booked everything worked perfectly. The indoor pool and the steam room are also extremely stylish.
The check in staff was super friendly and efficient. The concierge knew everything and helped us a great deal with resos at restaurants (a MUST is ""Bar Mut"" (a five minute walk from the hotel. They do nice twists on Spanish cuisine (reserve well in advance)) and checking in for our flights.
The plunge pool on the rooftop terrace is not really for swimming but you can dip in and enjoy the beautiful views over the city.
By the time we were there the gardens were not finished but already looked relaxing and great.
The Banker’s Bar is also well designed and drinks are perfectly mixed. Anna is a great bartender.
When I return to Barcelona the Mandarin Oriental will be my first choice again.
We also checked out the W Hotel (loud beats throughout the entire hotel, super unfriendly staff with attitude (especially at all entrances), bad location, loud (mostly American) crowd) and the Grand Hotel la Florida (not even worth talking about since it’s totally run down).
If you want it nice with perfect Mandarin Oriental service, stay at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona. It’s pricy but worth every cent.",5,2010,04,07
44,Absolutely Disgusting!!!,"My husband and I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental, Barcelona to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary.  My husband and I made reservations at Mandarin Barcelona to celebrate our wedding anniversary, we travelled with our 1 year old child.  We asked the hotel to arrange for transportation from the airport to hotel and back to airport.  They said 150 euro for either a Mercedes S class or BMW 7 series but they sent us a VW mini van to pick us up.  We had reserved a Junior suite and according to the description online it is 58 sq mtrs with a terrace and a second guest bathroom and when we checked in they gave us a small room which I believe is the manadarin terrace room with no guest bathrooom and a very small room.  When we asked the reservation desk about it they said that all suites were booked and this is the only one available.  I said why were we given this one as that is misleading because when I made the reservations online, they only had one description for the junior suite and no where did it say that some suites are much smaller or dont have  a second bathroom. Not to mention the rooms are very unsafe for little kids where they can bump and get hurt by all kinds of unnecessary objects.   When we addressed our concern to the hotel staff and director of operations, they started arguing with us and were very rude and did nothing to accomodate us.  Is this the training the staff gets at mandarin Orientals? Too argue with the guests.  We told them that we had an email from the hotel manager Luis Marco stating that he welcomes us to the  hotel and confirmation of our stay details which again showed the same description fro the manadarin junior suite.  He did  not even bother calling us or apologizing to us or showing any concern towards our complaint.   The director of operations was not at all helpful and did NOTHING to rectify this mistake.  We are still at the hotel siince we had booked our trip from April1 thru April 6th and we dont want to lose the whole amount that was already charged to our credit card $ 5000.00 (usually the card is charged on the day the guest checks out) but they charged our card $ 5000.00 on the very first day.......do they think we will not pay on our departure?  WE ARE NOTHING SHORT OF ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED BY THE BEHAVIOUR OF THIS HOTEL STAFF!  It was my husband's gift to me for our 5 year wedding anniversary but your hotel has absolutely ruined it for us and has left a very bad taste in our mouth.  Cant wait to leave and go on to our next destination (beautiful Turkey) whre we are staying at the Ritz and that's what we will stick to in the future.  I had also made reservations for a swedish massage for my husband at the SPA at Barcelona Mandarin Oriental but the confirmation letter that we received stated Aromatherapy for both of us.  That was'nt what we had requested...like I mentioned we have our 1 year old baby with us...one of us has to watch the baby and that is why the reservation was for swedish massage for just my husband.  It's a good thing we opened the letter and checked to make sure what it said and caught the mistake or else thay would have probably charged us for something that was never booked.   NO ATTENTION TO DETAIL.

So we cut our trip short and left 2 days early and were not refunded anything.....but that was expected.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE!  STAY AT THE RITZ BY THE MARINA.",1,2010,04,03
44,Magical Service,"Excellent Hotel.

Small rooms but cleverly laid out.  Everything feels a bit special.  The service is superb.  The hotel must have a policy that no luggage should be seen in the foyer, as it is miraculously whisked away from you to reappear in your room/in the back of your taxi as appropriate.  Very very good location too - and the buffet breakfast is a treat.  We stayed on a 3 nights for the price of two deal which made our stay affordable and delicious. Recommended.",4,2010,04,02
44,Mandarin Oriental- Sorry not for me,"Having a very enjoyable stay in The Majestic Hotel Barcelona last December, I noticed walking down Passeig de Gracia the New Mandarin Oriental.  
Being a senior citizen travelling alone I promised myself that my next visit to Barcelona I would try this impressive looking hotel for a treat.

My booking was made two months in advance with a debit card for five nights, taking advantage of an opening offer of a third night complimentary- total rate Euro 1605.00
My choice of room was a deluxe terrace room overlooking ‘attractive gardens.’ I also requested a two hour extension for check out at the time of booking.

Reception
Checking into the hotel I was asked for a credit card. I only carry debit cards whilst travelling but I was told the Hotel did not accept debit cards. 
The reason? A refund can not be given from a debit card. 
The outcome? The total amount of Euro 1605.00 was taken from my debit card immediately, which was acceptable to me at that point in time.
I was then asked to leave a deposit of Euro 300 daily for incidentals which was totally unacceptable and unreasonable to me. After expressing my disagreement with this arrangement the amount was eventually reduced to Euro 100 with the proviso that if this amount was not used I would not have to pay again. 
I was then escorted to my room expecting my luggage to be in situ having spent a long time at check in.
Two telephone calls later asking for my luggage it arrived after 25 minutes.

I was not given a key for my room at check -in because there was a problem with the 'system'. it was hoped to be corrected in a couple of hours however It was an inconvenience which lasted 24 hours,  having to wait for a concierge or bell boy to open the door with a master key. Many guests were complaining.

De-luxe terrace room.
The room was very pleasant, light and airy, functional with a desk, easy chair and small table but the furniture was not of the quality expected in a five star hotel.
The king size bed was comfortable with a linen change every day. 
The flooring is wood and I could hear people walking to my left, right and above. Also I could hear quite clearly the doors of the rooms to my left and right banging when closed.

The Bathroom 
Robes, slippers, good quality towelling, appealing spa toiletries, with a good rain shower but it did tend to overflow into the bathroom if not careful. 

The Terrace
The terrace, facing north overlooking the mimosa garden had one chair and a small table. Next door to the mimosa garden is a large sports ground in use all day and late into the evening, being floodlit. Football and basket ball is played and the noise is loud and disturbing so I had no pleasure sitting on the terrace. 
Another disappointing factor was the terrace outlook also faces the back of several apartment buildings with washing hanging out to dry.

Blanc Restaurant and Lounge
I decided to eat in Blanc one evening and was immediately met by someone who suggested I sit in one of the ‘favoured’ tables at the side, seeing as I was dining alone. I hasten to add that these tables were only for two whilst other tables down the centre of the restaurant with cushions and probably more comfortable sofas could sit any number of people by pushing together the tables.
I gave my order for food, Montserrat tomatoes and goats cheese followed by Linguini. To drink I asked for ½ bottle of red wine, preferably a rioja.  After much unnecessary fuss I was informed that they did not have ½ bottles of any wine. I then chose a glass of cava for my first course and a glass of rioja for my second course. Once again I was out of luck and they didn’t have my choice. To simplify things, I then requested just to bring me whatever they had available.
I waited 20 minutes for my first course to arrive with numerous waiting staff coming to offer their insincere apologies. The meal itself was reasonable but did not meet expectations, I found the waiting staff to be most insincere and fawning and I did not enjoy the evening.

The day before my departure I reminded reception that I had requested a two hour extension for check out, but once again this hotel let me down.

In all honesty , despite it's prestigious position , I would find it very difficult to recommend this hotel to anyone",3,2010,04,01
44,chris at the mandarin dining room made our stay!!!,"My husband and I recently dined at the Mandarin Oriental during our stay in Barcelona with our teenage daughter.  From the minute we entered to the minute we left we were treated like royalty.  Chris particularty enthralled us all.  He was personable, attentive and very knowledgeable.  He made our evening a total joy, and the food was good too!!!",5,2010,03,30
44,Very cool hotel in central Barcelona,"I stayed for one night at the Mandarin Oriental Barcelona and have to say that I was totally impressed with everything from the uber-cool design of the lobby, restaurant and rooms, the service and the food.  Breakfast in the Blanc restaurant was very good indeed with a great selection of breads, cereals, fruits and hot food available to order.  Drinks in the hotels Bankers bar were also great and it is a nice place to relax after a busy day in the city.  The rooms are excellent - very minimal with a decent mini-bar (Roberto Cavalli vodka!) and nice toiletries, bathrobes, slippers etc.  The location is perfect, on the Passeig de Gracia which is close to Las Ramblas and no more than 15 minutes walk to the marina.  Lots of nearby shopping, food and tapa's bars.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay somewhere special in Barcelona.",5,2010,03,29
44,The best place to stay in Barcelona - can't wait to return,"i have visited Barcelona quite a few times (25+) over the last 8 years or so - sometimes with my partner, on occasions with friends and now with my husband and young son.  i have stayed in various hotels including the Claris, the Grand Marina, AC Miramar, the Gran Florida, the Hilton, 1898, the Hesperia Tower, Casa Camper and, without a doubt this is now my hotel of choice in Barca.

Contrary to previous reviews our room was large and spacious with a seating area and beautiful terrace.  The pool is fabulous, the bankers bar a great place for a pre dinner drink and the breakfast was the best I have ever had in a hotel.  

The location is fantastic and the design features amazing.  Stay - you won't regret it.",5,2010,03,27
44,"Despite excellent service/location, not a great value","I booked the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona based upon the reputation of the MO chain (I had never before stayed at an MO hotel), its location, and this hotel's opening special.  Because the hotel opened in December 2009, I received one free night of the four I stayed there.  I enjoyed my stay during which I experienced excellent service.  However, the hotel has design issues and is not a particularly great value, even with the opening special.

The hotel is superbly located.  It is literally in front of a metro station, across the street from Gaudi's Casa Batllo, and a 10-minute walk to the old medieval quarter.  The reception, concierge, and bell-hop staff are excellent.  

I was given a room on the first floor facing the Passeig de Gracia and found the sound-proofing sufficient.  The room itself is of decent size though not particularly roomy and is filled with all the modern conveniences and some modern design touches.  However, there was no tub (a downside for me), just a large, open shower/hand-held shower.  To get to the bathroom you have to walk through the sink/open shower area.  There was no bidet.  The design is cool (the overhead shower doubles as a light fixture) but practically speaking has flaws.  The drainage system is simply not adequate to accommodate the amount of allowable water pressure, which is adjustable, and one evening water seeped/flooded into the rest of the bathroom and underneath the glass shower walls to the bedroom and entry hall.  I would suggest that to prevent such problems and the resulting damage to its brand-new floors that the hotel restrict the allowable water pressure in the shower.  We solved the problem by reducing water outflow and did not again have an issue.  I would also suggest that the hotel adopt a policy of at least offering guests the option of reusing towels/comfy bathrobes over multiple days to conserve energy/reduce waste.    

We stayed in Barcelona during a period of very cold weather (it snowed 4-5 inches) and the hotel's common areas (halls/small lobby/downstairs restaurant) were extremely chilly.  There really is no genuine lobby to speak of though this is the only area in which the hotel offers free wireless internet to its guests.  Surprisingly, the hotel lacks a business center.  So, the hotel provided us with a laptop and we paid for limited internet usage from our room.  I'm not sure how the hotel would handle requests for printing-we did not try.

Given the room prices, the hotel should at a minimum provide free wireless throughout and/or create a business center as soon as possible.  Other optional costs are high.  A pay-per-view movie, for instance, costs an astounding 28 euros. 

My companion enjoyed the indoor pool and steam room; the fitness room is basic/nothing special.

After driving around Catalonia for several days we returned to Barcelona and stayed at the Omm for our final nights, which I would have to recommend over the MO for its superior value and design.",4,2010,03,16
44,Great service!  Great location!  Some start up issues.,"I am a fan of the MO chain.  This is a neat little addition to the chain; however, it is not as polished as other five star hotels and still needs some work.

Positives:  The staff, especially the concierge, were very friendly and helpful.  They had great attitude and gave us the feeling that nothing was too much trouble for them.  We used them a lot because we were out and about a lot and asked the concierge to print out taxi directions to everywhere we were going.  They were alway prompt and nice in rendering their assistance.  The bell hops and doormen were always extremely pleasant and helpful too.

The location of the hotel was terrific.  We could basically walk to most restaurants and shopping we wanted to go to from the hotel.  If not, nothing was more than an affordable 10 to 15 minute cab ride away.

Minor issues that need improvement:  Housekeeping was not as prompt or neat as they should be.  Once I left a dirty robe on the floor, and housekeeping just hung it back up instead of taking it away for laundering.  Also, they missed our turn down a couple of evenings.

Our room was not as well sound proofed as it could be, although the noise would probably only keep you up if you were a moderately light sleeper.

The decor of the hotel could be ""cooler.""  I understand that the appointment of this hotel is minimalist in style, but I still think it could have been done better.  It lacks a certain ""wow"" factor, especially the lobby.  Nonetheless, our room was very comfortable and the rain shower was a nice touch.

I would stay here again on my next trip to Barcelona if they could keep rates reasonable.  We got a great ""opening rate,"" which is a great way to experience the hotel.",3,2010,03,11
44,OK hotel but with start-up problems,"The general reputation of a MO property is good with an almost drive to exceed expectations.  The MO Barcelona is trying but couldn’t exceed our expectations overall. Let’s start with some up side of this property. The location is really perfect and despite the noisy street, the rooms located at the Passage de Gracia are totally sound proof. The check-in at the reception desk was good organized with a complimentary drink of the house so the staff could prepare our room. After the drink we were escorted  to our room and received a quick briefing of the equipment of the room. The room wasn’t that big but please consider, it is a city hotel. The equipment of the room is modern and light furnished. The facilities of the hotel are good, there is a nice swimming pool with a hot steam sauna. The restaurant “MOments” is a real treat, wonderful dishes with marvelous taste sensations. The staff of “MOments” are well trained and keen to service the quests. On all good things comes an end so hereby some negative points. The check-in was good but after we were escorted to the room wasn’t our luggage at the room and I had to call the reception asking when we could receive it. The bellboy at the entrance isn’t always that sharp when you arrive the hotel with a taxi. The Bankers bar wasn’t a success, the staff could be and must be sharper. It took too much time to get attention for signing the bill or ordering a new drink. The Spa is good but not perfect due the swimming pool with steam sauna is also to use for the regular hotel quests. It could be to crowdie which is a shame and doesn’t contribute to a complete SPA relaxation. Overall I will recommend this hotel and I’m sure that they will improve the flaws to align the hotel with their other MO hotel colleagues.",3,2010,03,09
44,Never again ...,"The new MO is, unfortunately, a big disappointment. Despite the fabulous location (on Passeig the Gracia, lovely street) and quite nice concept for the lobby & atrium, this is not a really MO property: room are very small, full list of troubles like no heating in the middle of the night, 60 minutes waiting time from in room service breakfast (instead of 20, as adviced), low quality food, flooding of the room when using the designer bathtub...

On the good side, I would like to mention the Bankers bar: nice atmosphere, reasonable prices...",2,2010,02,17
44,Bound to become the place to stay in Barcelona!,"This is in reaction to the comment entitled ""when MO is not a MO"". Although I often refer to tripadvisor before booking a hotel, I  -- and I am sorry to admit it -- rarely find time to write a comment myself.  Still, I felt I had to bring the record staight on this one:

My husband and I stayed at the MO Barcelona for one night shortly after it inaugurated.  We are both frequent travelers and are used to stay in top-end  hotels and this one really exceded our expectations.  I was familiar with the Mandarin standards for having stayed at the mandarin NY and I can garantee you that the Mandarin Barcelona goes beyond the quality standards expected in 5 stars hotel: it is beautifully designed with personality and style and no compromise on confort.  The staff is indencently friendly.  The facilities are top notch and the location is just fab (you can't bet it, the city is at your feet ).  I highly recommend this hotel to all those you are looking for a memorable stay is Barcelona.  Personally I can't wait to get back...",5,2010,02,15
44,When an MO is not an MO!,"We only stay in Four Seasons, Ritz, MO type properties, and usually in suites. The new MO Barcelona had many problems due to being a new property which I can excuse. Still the bottom line with this place is the design which is your standard W type 'IKEA' style hotel. The rooms are so incredibly small with solid metal doors, one feels they are in jail. If you like MO's you will be very disappointed here. We moved to the Ritz Arts Barcelona and conversly it was amazing. Check out the new W as another option.",1,2010,01,06
44,Amazing,"We stayed 3 nights at the Mandarin at the end of December.  After a long trip from the U.S., it was a pleasure to check-in and get some rest at this hotel.  We were greeted at the doorstep of the hotel with very accommodating staff who immediately took our luggage and led us to the check-in desk.  The check-in was seamless and very personal; we were escorted up to our room by the front-desk agent who explained every aspect of the room and its features.  I had e-mailed the hotel in advance to ask if they had an Ipod docking station so I could charge my U.S. Ipod in Europe; it was brand new in a box and waiting for me gratis on the desk in the room.  Very impressive.  The room itself, a standard garden-facing room, was on the smaller side but beautifully decorated in muted colors.  The bed was divine with Frette sheets and a mattress that absorbed any movement by your bed partner.  Everything smelled clean and new and every detail was thought of, including a box containing all remotes for the room, an electronic window treatment system, and there was even a DVD player.  The bathroom was probably as large as the room which was surprising.  We had a separate shower, huge soaking tub, separate WC area and vanity.  While we are huge fans of modern design, the downside of this bathroom was its functionality.  The shower was in a ""wet area"" with a recessed border for draining and no door or other separation; in addition to lack of privacy the shower flooded every time we used it and we had to soak up excess water with towels (which were amazing towels, by the way).  The door to the bathroom is a sliding transparent glass door, which does not frost, so beware if you are traveling with anyone other than someone you are COMPLETELY comfortable with, your every bathroom move will be seen from the bed.  In addition, the door provides no sound insulation so if your bed partner uses the toilet in the middle of the night, you will hear everything.  The products and variety offered were top notch and were replenished every day.  Turndown service was excellent and a great way to return to the room after a long day - with bottled water and music playing.  Room service was extremely expensive even by European standards but reliable.  The food was very good.  We were surprised there was no free Wi-Fi at a hotel of this caliber and that there was no business center, although when we asked about these lack of amenities, we were graciously provided a free laptop delivered to the room and complimentary Wi-Fi for the evening.  We cannot say enough good things about Francisco and Albert, the concierges.  Every time we asked for tips, they were spot on and sent us to great restaurants with a variety of price points, as per our request, which were not tourist traps.  When we asked for help with planning a day trip to Girona, they meticulously planned it out for us.  Hotel staff referred to me by name each time I passed by, which was a great touch.  It seemed that there was a lot of staff posted around the hotel, which made for a bit of an intimidating experience as you walked in and walked around; it didn't seem that all of them had an actual function other than to stand around looking you over.  We attempted to take some photos of Blanc, one of the restaurants with an impressive interior, and we were stopped by a bouncer-type looking man who said ""no photos"", despite the fact we were guests at the hotel.  The gym was small but well appointed, with free water and fruit - it was open 24 hours a day, a great perk.  The pool was pretty but released a chlorine smell in the area surrounding - it needs some sort of scent system.  This is definitely the best 5 star option in Barcelona.  We were debating between the Mandarin and the Hotel Arts and we are so happy we chose the Mandarin.  Its location on Passeig de Gracia was unbeatable - we were on the Fifth Avenue of Barcelona in walking distance to everything, across the street from Gaudi's Casa Batillo and all the finest shops and restaurants.  We visited Hotel Arts during our stay; it looked dated and was by the water which is totally out of the way, and was desolate at night with nothing to do but gamble at the casino.  I highly recommend this hotel to discerning travelers.  Its a gem with fabulous staff and impeccable attention to detail.",5,2010,01,01
44,new top address in Barcelona,"we spent 3 nights beginning of december in the new Mandarin in Barcelona. The hotel opened 2 weeks before, and it is a very nice place to stay if you like modern, contemporary and luxury places. The staff was very nice and helpful, and especially the concierge gave us all the information we needed, and managed to book some very good restaurants, typical tapas , and seafood ones, where locals are going. It was very nice , and the three meals we had each time were really good. The restaurants in the hotel are top quality, and we had breakfast in room , which was extremely good as well. We tried the spa, and the indoor pool. Both are top quality , even if the pool is not huge, but for an indoor, you can still swim (12m long). 
Location is perfect as in the centre of the city, and if you like luxury, high quality service and contemporary , I will recommend this hotel, especially for the price you paid, as there is currently a promotion for the opening (3 nights for the price of 2).",4,2009,12,20
44,Mandarin Terrat,"I had gone to Terrat del Magín in other years, with my wife and sometimes with my partners. Yesterday I sent an email to book, but they replied that it was not necessary and that I could go directly. When I went with my wife they asked us if we had booked and then they told us that everything was full.

I don't know what has changed but I won't go back again.

We went to the terrace of the Majestic where they treated us impeccably and we had a very pleasant evening. I recommend it",2,2024,05,05
44,For everyone who wants that certain something extra in Barcelona.,"We had a wonderful stay at MO Barcelona. The VIP in our group also felt very comfortable. The MO BCN Guest Relations team around Gemma Grau and Sonia Catalán quickly fulfills all wishes - and does so in a relaxed manner via WhatsApp chat. The rooms are perfectly equipped, and the small balconies and terraces are also nice for chilling out. The breakfast is superb, you don't have to order the extras that are charged for in order to start the day well fortified. Above all, the always fresh fruit such as raspberries, blueberries and blackberries - delicious. The very pleasant indoor pool invites you to relax. And anyone who likes to go designer shopping. All of the city's designer boutiques are in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. At MO Barcelona, the wonderful capital of Catalonia is just so much fun!",5,2024,03,22

Da das Zimmer zum Zeitpunkt unserer verfrühten Anreise noch nicht fertig war, wurden wir auf einen Drink auf der Dachterrasse eingeladen.
Das Zimmer war hell, freundlich und elegant eingerichtet und es blieben keine Wünsche offen.
Zu jedem Zeitpunkt hatten wir das Gefühl willkommen und etwas ganz Besonderes als Gäste des Hauses zu sein. Egal wo und wann, man wurde immer mit Namen angesprochen.
Ebenso keine Wünsche ließ das reichhaltige Frühstück offen und das Team um Natalia im Restaurant hat sich fürsorglich um uns gekümmert.

El mejor Bloody Mary de Barcelona! Mejorable la música, preferiríamos Jazz, Soul....una terraza tan bonita necesita música a su altura!",5,2021,08,27
44,Más que Extraordinario,"Simplemente la mejor cadena de hoteles en el mundo, por mucho. 

He viajado por todos los continentes del planeta, en inmensidad de hoteles, y simplemente no hay un punto siquiera donde se pudiera comparar el servicio ofrecido en M.O. vs cualquier otra cadena. ",5,2020,03,14
44,Hotel único con servicio impecable ,He estado en una comida en el Mandarín Oriental de Barcelona. Unas instalaciones muy cuidadas y un servicio impecable.

44,MERAVIGLIOSO... ,"Che meraviglia... Che GRAN MERAVIGLIA è il Mandarin Oriental, Barcellona,   ed il mio terzo soggiorno presso questo meraviglioso albergo è stato ancora una volta a dir poco meraviglioso...e meraviglioso sentire di nuovo il gradevolissimo sensuale profumo di vaniglia uscendo dalla camera attraverso i corridoi, godere la vista del bellissimo giardino dal terrazzo della camera, sentirsi bene ed avvolti dalla bellezza, dal calore, dall'accoglienza della camera, fare una prima colazione eccellente, fare merenda pomeridiana o cenare presso l'affascinante stupendo ammaliante ""De Blanc"", rilassarsi alla sera sorseggiando un incredibile gran signor cocktail al fantastico bar ""Bankers"", essere coccolati e viziati, serviti e riveriti dal meraviglioso personale, e tanto altro ancora... Arriva purtroppo il giorno del check out, e si lascia a malincuore questo magico posto, ma c'è sempre la consolazione di poterci tornare, di organizzare in futuro un nuovo bellissimo  soggiorno... ",5,2020,02,18
44,De lo mejor que hay en el Passeig de Gracia,"Nos hospedamos en este hotel y es uno de los mejores que había en el Passeig de Gracia, la calle más céntrica de Barcelona. El personal super atento y el restaurante japonés de la terraza muy bueno con unas vistas de Barcelona impfresionantes",5,2019,10,05
44,Cuidado hasta el mínimo detalle,"Sitio precioso,céntrico y acogedor.Se encuentra en pleno paseo de Gracia ideal para visitar las casas Mila y batllo de Gaudí.El trato me pareció sensacional.Estuve el sábado 28 septiembre de 2019.Pude cenar después de ver el Madrid -Atlético a las 23 horas...lo que da muestra de que se trabaja y mucho en ese hotel para la comodidad del cliente.La habitación la 214 con vistas a un jardín.Saludos y besos a tutiplén del de la camiseta del Barça",5,2019,09,30

44,Realmente excelentes,"Impecable en decoración, limpieza, calidad de los diferentes servicios disfrutados y trato del personal, especialmente de Gabriel, concierge, que fue muy atento, cercano y amable y no solo me mostró las diferentes opciones gastronómicas del hotel, sino que quedó a cargo de mi maletín para que pudiera estar más cómoda y disfrutar de todo. ",5,2019,08,25
44,Eines der wenigen absoluten TOP-Hotels in Barcelona.....,"Auch auf unserem diesjährigen Trip nach Barcelona besuchten wir wieder für mehrere Tage das Mandarin Oriental und es war sicher die richtige Entscheidung. Wer meine bisherigen Bewertungen gelesen hat, weiß eigentlich schon alles....
Hervorzuheben sind immer wieder die Lage, Service, Hardware und Restaurants. Sie bewegen sich alle auf absoluten Weltstandard! Auch wenn einmal ""Unstimmigkeiten"" aufkommen, wird schnell Abhilfe geschaffen. Gerade bei den Zimmern sollten man wissen was man will; es gibt sehr unterschiedliche Kategorien und wir tendieren zu den fantastisch gestylten Suiten und sind gerne bereit, dafür zu investieren. Selten haben wir ein solch harmonisches Ambiente vorgefunden und wir haben schon viel in der Welt gesehen....Überhaupt hat das Hotel eine überschaubare Größe, wo unsere Privatsphäre akzeptiert wird, was in anderen Häusern nicht immer gewährleistet wird.
Für den ausgezeichneten Service möchten wir uns diesmal stellvertretend für alle Servicekräfte bei dem Hotel Manager Raul Levis bedanken, mit dem wir ein sehr interessantes Gespräch geführt haben. Wir kommen bestimmt wieder.....",5,2019,08,22
44,Un Oasis en Barcelona,"El hotel es precioso y el spa enamora, la tranquilidad que se respira y el relax son únicos. Recomiendo sus tratamientos! El hotel lo encuentro elegantísimo y se come de cine. Me chifla la terraza interior donde puedes tomarte un café fuera del bullicio de la ciudad.",5,2019,08,07
44,Experiencia 100% recomendable. ¡La comida está muy rica!,"Fuimos a celebrar el cumpleaños de mi madre al Brunch del restaurante Blanc.
Cuentan con un buen equipo de camareros y camareras que nos recibieron con una copa de cava fresquito, que se agradece al medio día de agosto! Federica fue la que nos atendió principalmente, y estaba atenta a cada detalle: reponía bebidas o cubiertos y nos trajo un pastel con una vela para soplar en el momento de los postres!...aunque todo el equipo es muy amable y servicial. El encargado, Luis, nos recibió en la llegada al salón, se acercó a nuestra mesa durante el servicio y la despedida fue igualmente cordial.
Un 10 en atención! Les felicito por el equipo, la verdad. 
Encontramos variedad de comida distribuida por la sala en tres islas: embutidos, quesos, arroz, hummus, un buffet de ensaladas, ostras, alitas, sushi...Lo mejor: ¡el buffet de postres! con variedad de pasteles, dulces, fruta cortada y zumos naturales que una camarera se encargaba de ir reponiendo. También hay una barra que comunica con la cocina y sirven platos calientes además de otros platos que salen de la cocina y los camareros ofrecen en mesa (recomiendo probar los huevos Benedict!).
El comedor tiene una decoración sencilla y agradable y puesto que no es demasiado grande estuvimos muy tranquilas. Es la primera vez que lo visitaba y ha resultado ser un acierto para celebrar una ocasión especial.",5,2019,08,05
44,Preciosidad,"Tuvimos la ocasión de poder acceder al hotel para el evento de “vespres inedits” para disfrutar de 2 tapas de autor con cerveza. Lo poco que vimos del hotel nos parecia una pasada. Muy moderno, decorción preciosa, grande, personal amable, etc. En definitiva un pedazo de hotel con terrazas paran disfrutar en verano",5,2019,07,24
44,Schlechtestes 5 Sterne Hotel der Welt / Krank und Herpes als Souvenir ,"Schlechtestes 5 Sterne Hotel der Welt

Ein Albtraum Namens Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, innerhalb von 2 Tagen 4 Zimmer gewechselt und als Souvenir Herpes eingeholt!!!!

Erstes Zimmer eine kleine verdreckte Box ohne Badewanne mit Balkon mit Blick in die Slums. Flecken an allen Möbeln und Teppichen

Zweites Zimmer eine größere Box mit Badewanne welche noch mehr verdreckt war, mit Flecken auf den Teppichen, Möbeln ect.

Drittes Zimmer eine Junior Suite wo wir schlussendlich für eine Nacht übernachten durften mit schmutzigen Fenstern, Flecken und Essensresten auf den Teppichen, Löchern im Sofa, Fettflecken auf allen Tischen, beschmierte Wände, korrodierte Metallbeschläge im Badezimmer und eine Badewanne die ausläuft und das Zimmer flutet.

Viertes Zimmer eine Suite die besser war, aber mit defekten, undichtem Waschbecken, mehreren grell rot blinkenden Lichtern an der Decke vom Schlafzimmer, an schlafen war nicht zu denken. Dito auch auch an den Nachtischen mit dem roten Licht.  

Die Bar des Hotels, welche an diesen Abend nur von 5 anderen Gästen besucht war, komplett verschmutzt, die Tische dreckig, für ein Rotwein/ein Champagner/ein Wasser fast 30 Minuten gewartet und das erschütterndste für ein 5 Sterne Hotel, sie hatten keine Rotweingläser, sehr peinlich für ein Mandarin Oriental.

Die Lobby und vor den Aufzügen die Teppiche komplett mit Flecken überseht, bei der Anreise in der Lobby leere Gläser überall am Boden gestanden. Ein stechender Geruch im kompletten Hotel, offensichtlich soll der Hygienemangel mit einem Raumduft überdeckt werden.

Frühstück auch so eine Sache in diesem Hotel, eine Familie mit zwei Kindern ca 5-8 Jahre alt, diese am Frühstück alle Marmeladen Löffel abgeleckt und diese wieder in die Behälter zurück gesteckt, genauso Schinken/Früchte/Sandwiches/Kuchen abgeleckt und wieder zurückgelegt. Personal hat nur zugeschaut und nichts gesagt. Sehr unhygienisch und ekelhaft, erst beim hinweisen hat die Kellnerin die Sachen vom Buffet genommen kurz rausgetragen und diese wieder zurück getragen!!!!!!! Der Frühstücksraum komplett dreckig und heruntergekommen!! Alle Ledersitze durchgesessen, Nieten fehlen an allen Sessel, dreckiger Teppich.

Poolarea am Dach ist nicht viel anders, alle Sitze verklebt und dreckig und voll mit Flecken, hatte dort etwas gegessen und getrunken und als Souvenir mir den ersten und schlimmsten Herpes meines Lebens eingeholt. Dieses Hotel nimmt es mit Hygiene nicht so ernst, es sollte mal das Gesundheitsamt dieses Hotel untersuchen.

Dieses Haus ist eine Schande für Mandarin Oriental und max ein 3 Sterne Haus. Es grenzt schon an Betrug!!!! Zimmerrate die wir gebucht hatten war eine total Rate und beim checkout auf einmal ein Nettopreis auf den noch die Mwst aufgeschlagen wurde!!!

Nie wieder dieses Hotel, größte und teuerste Enttäuschung meines Lebens mit einem 5 Sterne Hotel und ein nettes Andenken Namens HERPES!!!  ",1,2019,07,13

El Gerente del restaurante de la planta baja es un tipazo! No dio una súper atención, además de ser muy ameno en su trato. ",5,2019,06,29
44,Excelente Hotel y ubicación. Fuera de serie.,"A pesar de que Barcelona es una ciudad que dispone de muchos y buenos hoteles, de alta calidad, este sobresale por encima de los demás, no sólo por su excelente ubicación si no por su especial atmosfera, con detalles de altísima calidad y cuidado exquisito",5,2019,05,08
44,Cena sorpresa,"Platos que uno era muy bueno y otros normales por ejemplo el bacalao para cenar con garbanzos llena mucho y era un plato normal de sabor y si que era consistente a mi me encanta el bacalao y no es de los mejores he he probado, te esperas mucho de sitios con este nombre, pero tengo que opinar que el menú degustación era bueno relación calidad precio, extensa carta de vinos creo recordar que el que pedimos no había y nos recomendó otro similar y era bueno, espectacular el carro de los postres me encantó aunque el menú degustación sólo había un flan de naranja y por eso al final nos pedimos el mousse de chocolate que era delicioso. El servicio amable. Un sitio muy elegante.",4,2019,04,24

44,Atención buenísima ,"Te atienden muy bien. Te ayuda a cada instante en lo que necesites sin duda alguna. El diseño del hotel es espectacular y el restaurante buenísimo.
Lo único malo fue que el primer día nos iban a entregar la habitación a las 3pm y no estaba lista. También el concerge a veces fue lento.
Igual en general muy buena experiencia",4,2019,04,03
44,Il leggendario servizio Mandarin Oriental è qui... ,"Il Mandarin Oriental di Barcellona, per la sua bellezza ed il suo gran fascino... è una delle meraviglie della bellissima grande città catalana, e bisogna soggiornare in questo albergo da sogno, per capire.  Il leggendario mitico servizio e l'eccelsa accoglienza del Mandarin (che fu in Hong Kong) e dell'Oriental (che fu in Bangkok) si trova ancora qui al M.O., Barcellona. Il personale dell'albergo è di una professionalità incantevole,  squisito,  meravigliosamente cordiale e cortese,  tratta l'ospite come un familiare... ma anzi qui l'ospite è un familiare. Grazie...sinceramente infinitamente grazie a voi tutti (ristorante Le Blanc, Bankers Bar, Congierge, Housekeeping, Reception, ecc.) per aver reso meraviglioso il mio soggiorno, e spero di poter ancora godere della vostra calorosa sincera gentilezza ed affettuosa accoglienza... in futuro. Siete tutti dei veri Gran Signori. Un grazie particolare e speciale al ""Door Man, anzi door GENTLEman Alberto, per il carinissimo pensiero che ha avuto, per l'apprezzatissimo regalo che mi ha fatto.

44,"Brunch del domingo en Restaurante Blanc, para no perdérselo.","Habíamos probado el menu de temporada y nos apetecía el brunch. No decepcionó, es estupendo una gran variedad de platos de excelente calidad. Embutidos, bocadillos, ostras, langostinos, ensaladas, paella, carne, alitas, etc.... Variedad y mucha calidad, como cabe esperar de un lugar de esta categoría. Los postres muy caprichoso con variedad de pastelitos y chuptitos, también fruta. El servicio como siempre muy bueno. La relción calidad precio es estupenda. Coctel de bienvenida, cava, agua, etc. Sin duda volveremos. Lo aconsejo sin ninguna duda.",5,2019,03,13
44,Brunch,"Muy bueno el brunch, muy completo, quizá faltan más opciones de fruta y verdura. El servicio muy atento y muy buena calidad. Buenísimos los dulces, una pena que algunos no se reponían, así todo la cantidad más que suficiente.",5,2019,03,03
44,Best Pedicure ever!,"Diesmal habe ich nicht im MO BCN logiert, aber den Spa besucht. Sie haben da ja diese tollen Treatments vom Fusspflege-Guru (aus Belgien ist er glaube ich). Charlotte hat bei mir die Men's Pedicure durchgeführt und danach waren meine Füsse (die vom Skilaufen extrem gestresst waren) so wie frisch nach der Geburt. Nehmen Sie sich danach unbedingt noch die Original-Fusscreme in der Bordgepäck-tauglichen Grösse mit, sie kann dann zu Hause wirklich Wunder bewirken. Vor dem Treatment war ich noch im Indoor Pool und im Dampfbad, eine ideale Vorbereitung auf die Fussbehandlung, die - wie eigentlich alles in der Mandarin Oriental World - einfach ein Maximum an Effet mit sich bringt.",5,2019,03,03
44,una visita obligada en Barcelona,"siempre que viajo a Barcelona 
tengo que visitar el Mandarin Oriental y tomar alguno de sus ricos cocteles en su terraza maravillosa con unas vistas increíbles o en su bar siempre con una buena atencion",4,2019,02,27
44,Tornare a casa felici e soddisfatti,"Abbiamo soggiornato al Mandarin Oriental per due giorni, camere bellissime e con ogni comfort.
L'hotel è in una posizione strategica , a pochi passi dalla rambla e dalla sacrada familia, ben servita da ogni mezzo pubblico e con negozi e locali.
Accoglienza calorosa da tutto lo staff super efficiente. Grazie a Claudio che ci ha dato ogni informazione da noi richiesta in modo esaustivo. La colazione è spettacolare, grandi buffet con cibo( dolce/ salato) genuino e buonissimo.grazie a Gemma e Lorena che ci hanno accolto ogni mattina e a pranzo con un sorriso. Grazie ad Alberto che ci ha accolto all'entrata e uscita con una parola e un sorriso...familiare e amichevole ma sempre professionale. Se il nostro viaggio è stato così bello da non voler tornare a casa è anche grazie allo staff Mandarin Oriental Barcellona. Grazie da Matteo, Valentina, Daniel e la piccola Micol",5,2019,02,13
44,"RESTAURANT BLANC, elegante y excelente","Restaurante de lujo  ubicado en los bajos del hotel Mandarin Oriental. Una Carta de lujo y un servicio excelente y atento, cuidando todos los detalles. Como es muy caro sólo fui a la hora de merienda, pero incluso el café y las pastas fueron un autentico lujazo",5,2019,01,07
44,Pop up Restaurant,"Hasta el 1 de enero del 2019 tienen un Pop up Mexican restaurant. La decoración del local es preciosa, inspirada en Mexico y Frida Kahlo.

44,Il top a Barcellona ,"L’hotel è in pieno Paseo de Gràcia e la catena Mandarin è una garanzia per clienti molto molto esigenti 
L’accoglienza di tutto lo staff è con sorriso ed una professionalità eccellente 
Personalmente ho soggiornato in una Mandarin room al primo piano 111 a disposizione Nespresso, prodotti per il corpo capelli con essenza di caviale
L’hotel è una oasi rigenerante in città (Spa giardino zen , terrazza con infinity pool ) per tutti coloro che dopo meeting shopping o semplicemente visita della città vogliono rilassarsi rigenerarsi ed anche assaporare cibo eccellente non solo nel ristorante stellato ",5,2018,12,02
44,SIN LUGAR A DUDAS !!!,"Hoy nos perdemos en Barcelona, una de mis ciudades preferidas en el mundo. En pleno Paseo de Gracia, corazón de la ciudad, donde los edificios emblemáticos, neoclásicos y modernistas de arquitectos como Gaudí, Domenech i Montaner, Puig i Cadafalch, Josep Vilaseca i Casanovas se multiplican gracias a la apuesta de la burguesía catalana de la época por esa zona.
En el numero 38 del Paseo, se encuentra este edificio que desde sus inicios fue la sede del Circulo Ecuestre hasta la Guerra Civil y luego paso a ser la sede del Banco Hispano Americano. 
Su rampa de acceso al Hotel ya define al Hotel como ÚNICO, teniendo en el atrio de luces, su primer valor diferencial y exclusivo. Su servicio, marca de la casa, MANDARIN ORIENTAL, es sobresaliente, sus habitaciones, como mi 321, amplias y decoradas con todo lujo de detalles, su restauración es punto y aparte con las manos de Carmen Ruscadella y Raul Balam y la terraza de la ultima planta con esa pequeña piscina con infinitas vistas es uno de los valores añadidos del hotel.",5,2018,11,29
44,Semplicemente perfetto,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questa magnifica struttura per 3 notti. Parto col dire che la posizione è perfetta, nel pieno centro di Barcellona, vicinissimo a tutti i mezzi pubblici (metro/treno/bus) nel cuore del quartiere Eixample, a pochi metri da Casa Batlò! L'intero staff è di una cordialità, gentilezza e disponibilità unica, pronto a soddisfare qualsiasi esigenza sempre col sorriso. La struttura è impeccabile, noi abbiamo soggiornato in una Deluxe Room e siamo rimasti entusiasti da tutte le piccole accortenze che ci hanno riservato: dal benvenuto a base di cioccolatini, alla preparazione della camera anche per la notte, alle indicazioni metereologiche del giorno successivo, agl'innumerevoli prodotti per qualsiasi esigenza (notavano che avevamo occhiali sul comodino e al ritorno trovavamo delle stoffe per la loro pulizia; leggevo un libro e al ritorno trovavo un segnalibro; ecc...) ciò ci ha fatto sentire coccolati sotto ogni aspetto. Per non parlare poi di una sorpresa in camera offerta da loro in occasione del mio compleanno. E' stato un soggiorno fantastico, siamo andati via a malincuore. Speriamo di potervi fare ritorno in futuro.",5,2018,11,26
44,"Restaurant Blanc, Hotel Mandarín Oriental","Opción muy recomendable con la promoción ""Restaurant Week"" de El Tenedor, ya que de no ser por ésta no hubieramos conocido este magnifico hotel y restaurante.
Encantador tanto el hall, el salón donde se ubica el restaurante Blanc y el personal muy acogedor y servicial.
En cuanto a la comida todo nos pareció excelente, tanto la presentación muy cuidada como la calidad del producto. Creo que se nota la mano de la Sra. Ruscalleda!!!! Felicidades",5,2018,11,07
44,Restaurant Blanc en Mandarin Oriental Barcelona,"Fuimos a cenar al restaurante Blanc en el hotel Mandarin. Escogimos una propuesta de menú del Tenedor Restaurant Week 45€. El menú fue correcto, sobretodo la carne. Seguramente probaré otra cena para ver sí supera el menú que seguro que si. Aunque no se nota mucho la mano de la gran Chef Carme Ruscalleda, de la que si pude probar, hace un tiempo, su gran cocina en el ya cerrado Sant Pau.",4,2018,11,07
44,Hotel perfecto pero sin bañera en la habitación,"Me encantó este hotel, destacar la comida, la comodidad de las instalaciones y la calidad del sueño. Primero expresaré lo único que no me gustó y es que por el precio que se abona pienso que debería tener bañera en la habitación y no sólo ducha, sino... al menos en la descripción de la habitación debería ponerlo (habría elegido una habitación superior).Lo bueno es todo lo demás y no sólo bueno sino espectacular, desde la comida solicitada a las 12.30 de la madrugada a la habitación al spa etc. todo genial y especialmente delicado y de calidad. Recomiendo este hotel 100% y esto que me he hospedado en muchos hoteles de lujo de Barcelona y sin duda el mandarin oriental es mi favorito. Deseo volver!!",4,2018,09,26
44,Decepción ,"Lo visité antes del 2017 pero la opción de fechas no me permite poner el año exacto. Un hotel que puede ser de los mejores que he visitado en España, se vino abajo cuando una persona del hotel (gerente) me pidió levantarme de la sala de recepción pensando que no estaba hospedado y cuando supo que había estado casi dos semanas y estaba esperando a mi chofer, no supo como remediar la situación. Pésimo hotel por eso que para nada recomiendo",1,2018,09,16
44,No es para tanto,"Hotel muy bonito, pero sobrevalorado. Las habitaciones estan bien pero no para 800€ la noche como nos cobraron. Piscina en azotea bonita para tomar una copa. Y desayuno muy bueno eso si, a parte de un excelente trato y decoración. ",3,2018,09,12
44,Fünf Sterne?,"Gute Lage sehr zentral
Kleine unpraktische Zimmer ""Deluxe""
Bedienung völlig inkompetent sei es bei Frühstück oder Concierge 
Alles dauert ewig , wenn es überhaupt kommt...
Gänge wie im Schulhaus
Leider das schlechteste MO das ich je besucht habe",3,2018,09,10
44,IL MIGLIOR HOTEL LUSSO DI BARCELLONA,"Hotel di lusso in posizione centralissima. Ottimo punto di partenza per visitare Barcellona anche a piedi. Servizio di livello, personale molto attento alle esigenze del cliente senza essere mai invadente. Colazione ottima: varia e di alta qualità. Camere eleganti, moderne e pulitissime. Assolutamente consigliato!",5,2018,09,07
44,Simplemente lo mejor,"Acabo de llegar de San Sebastián y gijon hermosas ciudades y siempre barcelona muy punto final a este viaje por el cántabro, y como siempre este hotel de esta cadena tiene un nivel de servicio excepcional, en todos los puntos habitaciones amplias muy cómodas y un servicio de limpieza de lo mejor. En recepción son muy buenos y serviciales. Para mi esta entre los mejores hoteles de España ",5,2018,08,25
44,Incredibile ,"Sicuramente il miglior albergo della città, ottima posizione per ogni esigenza, dallo shopping alle escursioni.
Personale gentilissimo e cura maniacale dei clienti. Bello il giardino interno, un cocktail e jazz band sono stati una goduria per le afose serate catalane.
La terrazza con bar e piscina un po' piccolini ma lavorano bene ugualmente con tutto quel caldo. Non ho provato i ristoranti interni ma la colazione è stata molto abbondante e curata.
Davvero un hotel incredibile. ",5,2018,08,17
44,Sunset Terrat!,"Recomiendo la terraza del Hotel Mandarín oriental. Está ubicado en pleno Passeig de Gracia, con muy buena ambientación y el menú de Gastón Acurio es lo mejor!. Puedes reservar sin problemas por internet y la atención es de lujo.",5,2018,08,05
44,"CALIDDAD SUPREMA, CENA BRILLANTE!!!","Calidad SUPREMA!! REST. BLANC EN  EL HOTEL MANDARIN ....Servicio excelente, ambiente exclusivo y calidad-precio ideal... Las estrellas no son símbolos pq la Experiencia es Brillante .. Me lo recomiendo mi amiga Águeda y vaya suerte porque la mesa que nos dieron fue Espectacular celebramos nuestro 1 Aniversario....Nos surgió un imprevisto y tuve que llamar para retrasar la reserva 40 min, la gestión fue eficaz y amable .. Tomamos el menú degustación y era fabuloso!!El Señor Gregorio y Filipe nos atendieron de lujo... Estamos deseando volver a disfrutar en este restaurante y quedarnos a dormir en este magnífico Hotel.💫💫💫💫💫",5,2018,08,02
44,Stilvoll und elegant,"Das Hotel liegt ziemlich unscheinbar am Passeig de Gracia. Schick und nobel mit unaufdringliche Eleganz wie alle Mandarin Oriental-Hotels. Mega- Service, tolle Location. Dazu ein 2- Michelin-Sterne- Restaurant (Moments) mit einem Mittagsmenue von Dienstag bis Freitags für 77 € in sehr schöner Atmosphäre.",5,2018,07,05
44,Nos gustó mucho,"Menú compuesto por platos muy diferentes y sorprendentes, con productos exquisitos y atención espectacular. Visita a la cocina incluida durante la cena iniciativa del chef. Totalmente recomendado: una experiencia diferente.",5,2018,05,27
44,Ambiente raffinato e cibo al top!!!,"Ho pranzato il giorno di Pasqua nel ristorante di questo albergo. Cosa dire? Ambiente raffinato e cibo veramente al top! Un buffet  a dir poco ""luculliano""! Il tavolo dei dolci poi...Consigliatissimo!!!",5,2018,05,21
44,Tolles Hotel für einen Barcelona Kurztrip,"Das Mandarin liegt perfekt für einen Shopping oder Sight Seeing Trip im Herzen von Barcelona. Bereits der Weg zum Hoteleingang vermittelt ein wenig das Gefühl über einen Laufsteg zu gehen. Im Inneren überzeugt das Hotel durch eine sehr helle und offene Architektur und ist überraschend anders gestaltet als die meisten Hotels.
Highlight ist der Dachgarten, welchen ich leider nicht wirklich erleben durfte, da es während des Aufenthalts geregnet hatte.
Schade fand ich, dass auch am Wochenende Abends in der Bar nichts los war.",4,2018,05,09
44,BRUNCH EN EL BLANC DEL HOTEL MANDARIN . MUY RECOMENDABLE,"Fuimos a cenar meses atrás al Restaurante Moments del hotel y aprovechamos para pasar la noche en el mismo. Todo nos pareció perfecto y como cuando estuvimos alojados nos recomendaron el brunch del Blanc el pasado domingo fuimos a probarlo.
Realmente decir que se trata de un servicio  que no es barato, 59€ sin vinos, aunque el precio incluye zumos, agua y una copa de bienvenida, pero que merece la pena, por la calidad de los platos, el ambiente del local , con su luminosidad y decoración y la amabilidad de todo el personal del mismo.
Tiene un bufe de ensaladas, la mayoría de ellas especiales y con toques asiáticos, otro de platos fríos ( donde y por decir alguna pega quizás hay demasiados bocadillos y junto con el embutido parecen las sobras del desayuno ), tataki de atún, ostras, salmón, gambas, sushi,  quesos…todo de una gran calidad y mejor sabor.
Tiene también platos calientes y la cocina abierta donde también se sirven algunos de los platos principales, entre ellos los canelones , exquisitos.
Finalmente hay otro bufet de postres a cual más tentador.
Además van pasando platos especiales traídos directamente de la cocina, como los huevos benedicte con salmón, su mini- hamburguesa, etc., que no pueden dejar de degustarse.",4,2018,05,02
44,Ottima posizione !,"Mi sarei aspettata di più.....posizione ottimale veramente comodo. Personale molto gentile e all'altezza di un 5 stelle .Un profumo inebriante delizioso ovunque . Noi avevamo 2 camere doppie , una suite e una superior , devo dire che la differenza si vede.....anche dai piccoli dettagli ...pantofole , vestaglia etc .Le camere avevano balcone molto comodo per i fumatori !!!! I difetti per me sono stati un house keeping inefficiente , scarso e poco attento....bottiglie d'acqua aperte , metà piene lasciate senza tappo e non sostituite . All'arrivo 4 prugne senza posate e 3 pezzi di cioccolato di vario tipo , ma scomparso il giorno dopo.....Vasca non pulita......alle mie lamentele tante scuse e subito provveduto.
Io non penso di dovermi lamentare in un albergo così ! La colazione del mattino al di sotto di ogni aspettative , si deve scegliere tra 2 banchi 1 a 35€ e l'altro a 45 € ....sarebbe meglio e più elegante fare una media senza questa antipatica divisione. A me hanno sbagliato l'ordine , l'ho fatto notare e subito scuse e portato ciò da me richiesto. Alla fine la manager non ci ha fatto pagare il piatto....molta gentilezza e professionalità.Per finire soddisfatti , ma prezzo qualità non vanno bene ......",4,2018,04,19
44,El mejor hotel de lujo de Barcelona ,"Imposible destacar nada negativo, habitaciones limpias y grandes. Dispone de una terraza no muy grande pero con muy buenas vistas y unos ricos combinados.
El servicio y trato de los empleados inmejorable. He pasado tres días espectaculares. Enhorabuena. ",5,2018,04,19
44,Muy recomendable,"He ido sola para desconectar un poco, no sólo me dieron una atención impecable, muy por encima de los expectativas, estoy deseando volver. 

Recomiendo el desayuno y los masajes,sería ideal para ir con parejas .

44,Restaurante Blanc: Alto nivel,"Aprovechando la oportunidad de degustar el menú especial de Passeig de Gourmets, tuve la posibilidad (y supongo que la suerte) de conseguir mesa en este excelente restaurante.
Un menú cerrado, con bebidas y café incluídos, con un nivel de calidad muy alto, acorde con el prestigio del restaurante (una delicia el plato de ""caviar verde"" con butifarra).
A destacar la profesionalidad y corrección del servicio.",5,2018,03,20

44,Buena tapa maridada con cava Gramona!,"Fuimos en los dias del evento Passeig de Gourmets, que se realiza durante diez dias en los establecimientos de lujo cercanos al Passeig de Graci. La tapa, muy bien elaborada, no era excelente, peró sí el servicio, el local y los snacks complementarios....y por 7 euros",4,2018,03,14
44,Muy recomendable!!,"Excelente atención del personal, especialmente de Jose Miguel. Comida muy buena y de calidad, sobretodo el impresionante carro de postres. Un ambiente muy confortable y acojedor. Busca un momento para ir al baño es  recomendable y sinceramente me impacto.",5,2018,03,12
44,I'm a great fan of Mandarin Oriental Barcelona ......,"Nach mehreren Jahren besuchten wir mal wieder das Mandarin Oriental Barcelona für eine Woche und wären liebend gern noch ein paar Tage geblieben. Wo findet man auch in Barcelona ein Hotel mit einem Spa mit Indoor-Pool, eine Dachterrasse mit einem Plungepool & Bar, einen mediterranen Garten mit Olivenbäumen zum Verweilen, dazu vier Restaurants & Bars (darunter das außergewöhnliche zwei Sterne Restaurant ""Moments""); und das in absoluter Top-Lage...?
Das Hotel wurde im Nov. 2009 eröffnet und von der renommierten Innenarchitektin & Designerin Patricia Urquiola zum Flaggschiff der katalanischen Hauptstadt mit viel Liebe zum Detail gestaltet. Wenn man vom Passeig de Gracia über den langen ""Catwalk"" direkt ins Hotel kommt, fühlt man sich in einer anderen Welt. Asiatische Einflüsse wurden subtil mit modernem Charme & Ausstattung wunderbar verknüpft, so dass wir uns sehr wohl fühlten. Und obwohl es sich um eine ehemalige Bank handelt, strahlen die öffentlichen Räumlichkeiten nur so von Licht und Durchlässigkeit; einfach Lifestyle pur... Eine zusätzliche Investition in eine höhere Zimmerkategorie (ca. 120 Zimmer & Suiten stehen zur Auswahl) lohnt sich ganz sicher. Wenn man dann wie wir eine helle Terrassen-Suite in der 5. Etage (ca. 120 qm) mit einer riesigen Dachterrasse über den Dächern Barcelonas bewohnten, blieb kein Wunsch offen; traumhaft...! Trotz moderner, leicht orientalischer Einrichtung mit vielen Kunstwerken kam eine wohnliche Atmosphäre auf, die wir in den Tagen sehr genossen. Unser besonderer Dank gilt dem fantastischen Service-Personal, das nicht nur professionell, sondern auch herzlich war; in der Konstellation auch in der Luxus-Hotellerie selten anzutreffen. Hervorheben wollen wir stellvertretend für das gesamte Personal den Concierge Franco Cassinelli, den Guest Relations Manager Gustavo Estebanez und die Front Office Managerin Miriam Tirado, die sich bei all unseren Fragen und etwaigen Problemen liebevoll um uns gekümmert haben, so dass wir uns als wahre Gäste gefühlt haben.
Dass so ein Erlebnis nicht ""preiswert"" sein kann, müssen wir eigentlich nicht erwähnen; u.E. war es aber jeden Euro wert.",5,2018,02,17
44,Ottimo albergo in posizione centrale,"L'albergo si trova nella zona dello shopping e vicino a plaza Cataunya. L'albergo offre ottimi servizi (consigliato il bar Bankers e il ristorante Moments). Buona la pulizia e il servizio in camera e la cortesia di tutto il personale. Migliorabile la colazione (avrei voluto trovare più frutta fresca e, soprattutto in Spagna, spremuta fresca di arance...) non ho gradito la crepe e il pancake (sapevano troppo di uova). L'area del ristorante Blanc meriterebbe di essere valorizzata maggiormente. Migliorabile anche l'insonorizzazione delle camere.
Struttura consigliata",5,2018,02,15

La comida muy buena, no sabría que recomendar porque en general estaba todo muy bueno y los postres deliciosos.

Incluyendo acceso al Spa, desayuno en la habitación y copa de bienvenida, en un hotel precioso y muy bien ubicado. Conocíamos sus restaurantes y su bar, pero la experiencia ÚNICA fue ponerse en manos de su personal, cuya atención no tiene precio. TODOS desde la puerta de la entrada, camareros, recepción, conserjería, servicio de habitaciones, barman, camareros, te transmiten la alegría que sienten al tener la oportunidad de hacer algo por ti y todos pusieron algo de su parte para hacernos sentir acogidos, cuidados y como en casa. Nuestra más sincera felicitación a todos. Sois increibles!!!",5,2017,12,11
44,Un hotel con encanto.,"Es lo que se puede esperar de un cinco estrellas Gran Lujo y hace honor al prestigio de la cadena Mandarín Oriental, es lujoso, elegante, sofisticado, tiene su parte snob, pero también tiene el encanto del “BARRIO/PATIO” 
Para mí las mejores habitaciones son las que según ellos dan al “jardín de mimosas”, vulgo “PATIO DE MANZANA DE TODA LA VIDA”. 
Según mí particular punto de vista, lo mejor, ahí puedes sentarte en la terraza de la habitación, a observar la vida pasar, cada ventana es un canal de televisión diferente, amenizado por los sonidos provenientes del patio de recreo del colegio ahí situado, sonidos agradables que me retrotraen a mí infancia. En ese patio se reflejan las distintas luces del Mediterráneo a diferentes horas del día, crean un ambiente especial, mágico, que consiguen que te integres mas fácilmente con la ciudad.
Un hotel con un “un gran continente” (el edificio, instalaciones servicios), estaría cojo sin otra de sus patas, el equipo humano, y en este caso, estos profesionales han estado a la altura y superado las expectativas que se espera de ellos. Todos sin excepción. Pero soy humano y hay una persona que ha superado mis expectativas, Carla Pontnou. Como he dicho me he alojado anteriormente en el hotel y siempre he pedido habitaciones al patio, y siempre habían sido con terraza, en este ocasión, nos la dieron sin terraza,  comentar mi error con Carla y arreglarlo fue todo uno, no solo hizo eso, sino que estuvo pendiente de todo durante nuestra estancia, incluso organizarnos el desayuno del día de salida, pues nos íbamos de madrugada. Gracias Carla, tu y tus compañeros sois el sol del Mediterráneo dentro del hotel.
Un punto débil: Los churros.No son lo auténticos, que se esperan de un establecimiento de esa categoría.",4,2017,12,06
44,excelente hotel,"Excelente hotel, buen trato,, personal profesional, excelente cocina, habitaciones amplias y comodas con todos los servicios de más de 5 estrellas, las instalaciones piscina, sauna y otros excelentes así como el spa una maravilla con su personal, hotel para repetir siempre.",5,2017,12,05
44,Realmente espectacular ,"Lo considero el mejor hotel en Barcelona en todo, las instalaciones son de alta calidad y clase, la atención de todo el personal, las habitaciones ni se digan y los restaurantes divino, no es económico, pero si lo puedes pagar, no dejes de ir.",5,2017,11,18
44,Sin duda el mejor de los grandes hoteles Barcelona.,"Un sitio con una ubicación inmejorable. La atención es discreta y atenta. Y hay un cierto punto de lujo antiguo en el trato que generalmente valoro mucho. 
Los restaurants son de un nivel adecuado al hotel, y posee una terraza interior donde hacer un té con pastas es una auténtica delicia.",5,2017,11,09
44,El mejor hotel de Barcelona,"Si eres un viajero acostumbrado a los detalles más cuidados, Mandarin Barcelona es tu hotel en la ciudad. Ninguno puede superar una profesionalidad máxima, atención personalizada, sinfín de cuidados y comodidad para que tu estancia sea única e inolvidable. No puede faltar una visita a su restaurante Moments y disfrutar de su menú degustación y maridaje. ",5,2017,11,03
44,Ubicación inmejorable y servicio excelente,"Estuvimos cenando en el restaurante Blanc durante la Restaurant Week de El Tenedor. La verdad es que nunca antes habíamos estado y nos encantó la experiencia.

44,Muy buen brunch,"Hemos ido en familia a probar el brunch del fin de semana.
Excelente!!!!!!!
El trato lo mejor, el equipo muy muy bueno. Este hotel tiene ""alma""
La comida del mismo nivel
Al final el cafe en la terraza.
Recomendable",4,2017,09,24
44,Luxus,"Das Hotel liegt direkt an der berühmten Flaniermeile, dass man in einem Luxushotel ist bemerkt man nicht an großem Pomp, alles geschieht wie selbstverständlich, das Personal ist immer unauffällig zur Stelle wenn man ein Problem hat. Besonders imposant der Pool auf dem Dach mit der schönen Aussicht",5,2017,08,31
44,Gintonic con vistas,"Instalación de lujo ubicada en pleno Paseo de Gracia de Barcelona.
Vale la pena al menos ir una vez.
En la terraza hay vistas a la ciudad, con piscina y zona de relax. Copas buenas (precio no tan bueno, pero el contexto se paga y se entiende). RECOMENDADO.",5,2017,08,13
44,Excelente Hotel,"De los mejores hoteles que me he quedado . Muy buena ubicación , el servicio de todo el personal es buenísimo, siempre pendientes de lo que necesitas y dispuestos ayudarte en lo que pidas.las habitaciones son muy cómodas además de todos los ammenities que te dejan  La comida es de primera desde el desayuno hasta cualquiera de sus restaurantes .

44,Disfrutando de las vistas ,El servicio de camareros es excepcional !!! Magnífico me tomé dos copas de vino y una mouse de mango buenísima para el calor !!! Siempre que puedo voy a disfrutar de las vistas !!! Gracias por el servicio  ,5,2017,08,03
44,Restaurant Blanc - Un secreto a descubrir,"Estuvimos cenando en el Restaurant Blanc, que podríamos denominar como una versión económica de Moments. Ambos dirigidos por Carme Ruscalleda. Por 59€, con 4 platos + aperitivo + copa de cava + postre incluido creo que es una de las mejores ofertas que se pueden encontrar en el corazón de Barcelona.
Comida de altísima calidad, atención extraordinaria, ambiente relajado y sin complejos, en un hotel precioso.
Sin duda, una cena que para una pareja por 140€, donde cada euro, está bien empleado y la experiencia es realmente buena. Lo recomiendo mucho.
Por cierto, si eres intolerante o alérgico, con comunicarlo previamente, el menú te lo adaptan, y en mi caso, fue espectacular el cambio.
Por tanto, aunque es una cantidad elevada, la relación calidad-precio es buenísima. Totalmente recomendable.",5,2017,07,27
44,Lujo,"Si quieres pasar unos dias tanto de viaje de negocios como de vacaciones de lujo, este es el hotel indicado.
Situado en el centro de Barcelona, en paseo dd gracia, una de las calles mas lujosas llena de tiendas.
La terraza es preciosa e ideal para ver puesta de sol y relajarse, y la comida deliciosa",5,2017,07,26
44,Empfehlenswert!,"Hervorragende Lage, viele wichtige Sehenswürdigkeiten und schöne Geschäfte fussläufig zu erreichen. Die Zimmer sind sehr großzügig, sauber und ruhig. Der Service und alle Mitarbeiter sind extrem freundlich und hilfsbereit. Fitnessgeräte von Technogym, indoor Pool zwar klein, aber mit Salzwasser und Temperatur sehr angenehm. Dachterassen Pool nur 60 cm tief, also nur zum Eintauchen geeignet, dafür aber tolle Sicht über Barcelona. Terrasse am Abend nicht zu übertreffen. Essen auf der Terasse eher für Sushifans ( haben aber nur zwei Essen gekostet). Qualität top. Wein im Verhältnis sehr teuer. Wir würden auf jeden Fall wieder kommen. ",5,2017,07,25
44,Buen Hotel,"Hotel relativamente nuevo ubicado en paseo de G  cerca de todo en Barcelona, cuartos muy modernos, rooftop super cool , el Bar del Lobby era una antigua boveda de un banco, todavía se ven las casillas de seguridad muy buenos cocteles full recomendado.",4,2017,07,24
44,Excelencia absoluta,Es un lugar espléndido donde te acoge el inmueble y lo superan las amenidades y el servicio.  La atencion es personalizada y se esmeran por entender tus necesidades y requerimientos resolviéndolos de inmediato,5,2017,07,21
44,El Terrat,"Pequeño restaurante en la terraza del hotel con unas vistas privilegiadas de Barcelona , la cena muy floja , platos poco sorprendentes tanto en la presentación como en el sabor , no puedo destacar ninguno ......estaban buenos pero esperaba más , l detalle de la copa de plástico no me convenció , después de pedir un buen vino y no poder saborearlo como tocaba .
Es un gran lugar para tomar un café o una copa de licor pero poco más 
Es solo mi opinión y yo no volveré pero que cada uno saque sus conclusiones ",3,2017,07,17
44,Terraza Mandarin top ,"La terraza del Mandarin sin duda una de las mejores Terrazas de Barcelona , cèntrica , con clase , mobiliario comodo para tomar algo , Tranquila , Buenas vistas y muy Buenos cocktels , el precio en consonància con Este tipo de hoteles de lujo .",4,2017,07,16
44,Súper lujo ,"Nada más entrar por la pasarela ya te das cuenta que esto es otro nivel , y te asomas y ves el bar abajo y ya te da un pasmo. Él servicio impecable , nos tomamos un bloody mary en el bar y es el mejor que me he tomado nunca , por no hablar de la judicatura y la decoración 
Te sientes millonario por momentos al lado de michael j for o algún otro ricachon ",5,2017,07,11
44,Que piscina,"Precio: Es un 5 estrellas y lo vale
Instalaciones: exquisitas y no es de esperar menos del Mandarin Oriental
Habitaciones: Camas extra grande que para alguien de 2 metros es de agradecer.
Observaciones: Esa piscina esta muy bien hecha, el poder hacerte unos largos y no parecer que estas en una bañera un poco grande. Aparte de disfrutar tomar algo a la noche junto a ella. Y esos pequeños detalles como el chocolate a diario y mas cosas hace que no quieras salir del hotel aunque tengas que hacerlo para disfrutar de la ciudad.",5,2017,07,06
44,Brunch,"Muy caro
Excesivo precio para la oferta de los platos disponibles que no son materias primas especialmente selectas
Pagar incluso el agua aparte es de muy poco detalle
El servicio es poco experto, parecen cedidos o subcontratados",2,2017,06,29
44,"Bonito sitio, almuerzo flojo","Estuvimos cuatro personas en una comida de negocios. La decoración del restaurante Blanc es muy agradable, luminoso y con gran espacio, las mesas y butacas cómodas y adecuadas para un almuerzo, así como el servicio, atento sin ser empalagoso. Lo más flojo fue el almuerzo en general, para un restaurante con supervisión de la señora Ruscalleda, se espera algo más con una lechuga con un par de adornos, unos canalones solitarios en el plato, o un par de rapes rebozados con una ligera salsa. Para casi 100€ por comensal, la verdad, esperaba mucho más.",3,2017,06,17
44,Buenas vistas!!,"La terraza algo pequeña, buenas vistas y muy buen servicio, amables, estéticamente agradable ... los tragos muy buenos!! Spritz!! recomendado!! sitios cubiertos como al sol.. buena música... recomendable!",4,2017,06,06

44,Excelente,Es un ejemplo de hotel excelente las habitación muy bien decoradas y excelente luz. Adicional los baños con todo lo necesario. El desayuno es excelente siempre me gusta un buen desayuno y aquí es tremendamente bueno. El servicio del personal muy bueno y muy servicial. Pagas por lo que opines y eso es bueno.,5,2017,06,05
44,Super BRUNCH,"Todo fantástico, servicio, calidad, cantidad, ambiente, precio.... seguro repetiremos.
Enhorabuena al equipo. 
Querría destacar sobretodo el gran surtido que hay des de salados, dulces, crudos. I bonito detalle de la copa de champagne para recibirte. ",5,2017,05,10
44,Decoración sublime y ubicación excelente,"A la derecha Tiffany&Co y a la izquierda Brioni, ahí es nada. Son las dos tiendas que flanquean este magnífico establecimiento. Te sientes en la quinta avenida de NY.
Las habitaciones no esperes terneras antes de las 15:00, mientras puedes almorzar su excelente  sándwich club en el precioso restaurante.
La habitación correcta, le falta un poco de presión a la ducha, los productos de baño Red Flower, la cama muy cómoda, edredón de plumas de ganso mítico.
El desayuno muy bueno, buen café y bolleria.
El servicio simplemente correcto.
Cené en el restaurante de la terraza de la azotea. Excelente, cena fusión Peruana. Muy agradable.
SPA magnífico.
Eso sí, nada es barato.
No obstante, actualmente es mi apuesta en Barcelona.",4,2017,05,02
44,"Brunch bien, falla el servicio..","Comimos diada de Sant Jordi , sin platos en el bufet , tubimos que  esperar el 2º plato de un comensal 15', amables pero falla organización del comedor ...la comida muy bien , variedad y calidad.. personal despistado...espacio bonito y bien decorado...",3,2017,04,23
44,"Ausgezeichnete Bar, toller Garten, tolles Spa","Die Bar ist klasse, das Essen schmeckt, der Garten ist schön.. Das Spa sehr nett. Das Personal ist freundlich und aufmerksam. Das Interieur ist Mandarin-oriental-like sehr klar, nicht unschön dunkel und modern. Cocktails sind Top.",5,2017,04,22
44,Schlechtestes Mandarin ever,"Dieses Hotel hat es aus meiner Sicht nicht verdient den grossen Namen dieser eigentlich tollen Hotelkette zu tragen. Ich bin geren sehr oft Gast bei Mandarin Oriental in diesem Haus aber zum ersten und letzten Mal.
-Zimmer, gehobene Kategorie jedoch winzig. Selbst wenn man NewYorker Hotelzimmer gewöhnt ist, ist das hier klein
-Der angekündigte Balkon ist komplett ohne Bestuhlung, man kann also nur auf diesem stehen
-trotz eingeschaltetem ""do not disturb"" klingelte am Sonntagmorgen um 8 Uhr!!!!! das Telefon wegen Laundry Service...unfassbar
-Zimmer auch ein bisschen abgewohnt
-Betten keine schönen King Size Boxsprinbetten wie normal in solchen Häusern, sondern ganz einfache Betten
-trotz unsere Rate mit early check inn war bei Anreise um 13 Uhr Mittags das Zimmer natürlich nicht fertig
Wir wollten eigentlich zwei Nächte bleiben, jedoch haben wir die zweite Nacht storniert und ziehen um. Zum Glück gibt es in Barcelona genug Alternativen. Zu deutlich besserem Preis-/Leistungsverhältnissen. Das Mandarin Barcelona zählt definitv zu den schlechtesten Hotels in denen ich jemals in dieser Kategorie gewesen bin.",1,2017,04,09
44,Cada vez mejor!!!,"Este hotel y sobre todo su equipo no deja de sorprenderme.
Cada vez que nos hospedamos nos atienden mejor, el nivel de excelencia es superlativo.
Thais sigue al frente de un equipo de profesionales inolvidables.
Deberian replicar el trabajo en el Ritz de Madrid, de la misma cadena pero donde helos tenido una experiencia sumamente olvidable.
Los felicito y espero volver pronto al Mandarin de Barcelona!!!!",5,2017,04,02
44,Perfecto,"Opinión del Bar del Hotel Mandarin. Es un bar muy acogedor en el centro. El servicio es inmejorable, tanto en la atención como en el trato. La oferta es variada. El ambiente muy agradable, se puede hablar sin ruidos. La relación calidad/precio es adecuada. He ido varias veces y lo recomiendo.  En temporada estival dispone de un restaurante en la terraza que es una maravilla.",4,2017,03,29
44,Stupendo,"Molto comodo per la sua posizione centrale.
Raffinato.
Molto costoso.
Servizi e cortesia di altissimo profilo.
Per pochi non per tutti.
Molto suggestivo al suo interno.
Purtroppo non ho potuto visitare le camere ma dal sito ti rendi gia' conto del livello molto alto della struttura.",5,2017,03,18

Realmente nos sentimos muy comodos , Sin ninguna duda volveria a elegirlo !",5,2017,03,01
44,UN BUEN HOTEL CON UN SERVICIO IMPECABLE,"Este fin de semana , a pesar de ser de una población cercana a Barcelona nos dimos el capricho de alojarnos en el Hotel ya que queríamos comprobar in situ la fama que se le otorga.
Nada que decir en referencia a la ubicación, que es excelente, sobre todos para los visitantes que no conocen la ciudad y en cuanto a la decoración es vanguardista pero a la vez cálida y relajante.
Sobre los precios, evidentemente no es barato, pero está en el mismo nivel de hoteles de su misma categoría que hemos visitado en el extranjero pero este tiene un servicio más esmerado que alguno de ellos. Da la impresión que son conscientes de que se paga por unos servicios que intentan siempre facilitar.

Que decir de la restauración, ya que creo que pocos hoteles pueden presumir de tener en sus dependencias la categoría de los chefs que tiene este Hotel, destacando entre ellos el Moments con sus dos estrellas michelín ( en el que cenamos y no nos defraudó en absoluto )
Quizá el punto más flojo fue la habitación. Contratamos la de categoría estándar y aun que tenia los metros cuadrados que publicitan, la que nos toco a nosotros, tenia una distribución bastante irregular, lo que la hacia poco atractiva. Comparada con otras habitaciones de otros hoteles de la misma categoría no tenia el mismo efecto de amplitud y confort.
Eso si, lo que lo compensó eran los complementos de la misma que en ese punto si que supera las habitaciones de otros hoteles. No solo  las amenities, albornoces, etc, que suelen ser bastante estandars, sino que contaba con muchos otros detalles como plancha para el pelo, pequeño material de oficina , adaptadores multimedia  para todo tipo de aparatos electrónicos, etc. y todo ello, desde la televisión hasta el mini bar con un diseño moderno y elegante que marca la diferencia.
Finalmente lo mejor del hotel es su personal. Desde recepción , maleteros, valets, información, limpieza, camareros, con todos ellos con los que tuvimos la ocasión de hablar hemos de destacar su profesionalidad, su atención y las ganas de ayudar en cualquier consulta o petición que se plantease. Fueron realmente atentos y simpáticos y desde aquí les agradecemos sus atenciones.
En resumen un muy buen hotel y si todos los de la cadena tiene el mismo nivel es para tener en cuenta.",5,2017,02,26
44,Stadturlaub Kurzbesuch,"Es gibt sehr viele gute Hotels weltweit; das können wir mit Sicherheit sagen, da wir bereits in einigen abgestiegen sind.
Das Mandarin Barcelona zählt nicht dazu- es ist ein TOP Hotel! Eines der besten Häuser weltweit!
Fangen wir mit der Lage an, sehr von dort alles zu erreichen - direkt im Zentrum.

Die Ausstattung des Hotels und die Zimmer sind großartig- unser Zimmer lag zur Straße mit kleinem Balkon- das Bad mit Dusche und abgetrenntem WC war modern und groß. 
Das Hotel ist mit einem Innen Pool und der Rooftop Bar mit Pool (Sommer Monate) sehr gut Ausgestattet.
Das Restaurant ist sehr gut - wir hatten ein Frühstücksbüffet inkl. Bei dem keine Wünsche offen blieben.
Auch Mittags haben wir einmal dort gegessen was ebenfalls sehr lecker war.
Abends nach einem langen Stadtbummel Tag, waren wir einmal an der Bar, die auch gut ausgestattet war und jeder Cocktail perfekt schmeckt.
Nun möchte ich etwas zum Personal sagen- alle Mitarbeiter sind in diesem Haus wirklich einmalig! Es wurde uns soviel Gastfreundschaft und Hilfsbereitschaft entgegen gebracht, was schon außergewöhnlich ist - auch in einem 5 Sterne Haus.
Besonders Herausheben möchte ich den Concierge Service - und den Restaurant Service - sehr nette und top geschulte Mitarbeiter.

An das Management Senior Jiménez und an Frau Annete Rusch Danke für die Top Organisation - wir kommen gerne wieder!

Ps an alle Reisenden- dieses Hotel und diese Stadt ist eine top Kombination - unbedingt machen.

44,"Hotel muy bueno, pero excesiva fama y precio para lo que ofrece","Gran hotel, lujoso, moderno y mucho personal dispuesto a ayudarte con todo.
El problema viene en ciertos detalles que encuentro a faltar.
""Hall"" pequeño con pocas opciones donde moverte con un niño.
Desayuno de mucha calidad pero a un precio desorbitado 30€ sin embutidos y 45€ completo, dos bufetes para cada menú. No entiendo la separación (pon 35€ para un bufete de desayuno fijo y ya está...
).Por tomar una tostada con pan y tomate y un poco de fuet... 15€ más? No tiene sentido. He estado en buffets de similar calidad y sin tantas complicaciones.
La habitación normal (como la del resto de hoteles de igual categoría de alrededor) pero pagando bastante más.
La ducha tiene al lado un felpudo de goma con ventosas para que no resbales (lo he visto en hoteles de 2 estrellas). Si la ducha resbala, hay mil opciones mejores que un felpudo de goma.
La habitación muy limpia, pero no esperaba ver polvo detrás del escritorio al enchufar un cable..
En definitiva, un hotel de 5 estrellas totalmente recomendable, gran servicio, gran calidad y mucha fama, pero en Barcelona, pagando mucho menos, tienes hoteles de similares prestaciones... 
Pero claro... no estás en el Mandarín.
Volvería...",4,2017,01,07

44,"Es ist das Personal, welches das Herz eines Hotels ist......","Wir hatten ein tolles Wochenende in Barcelona, die Sonne schien, und unser Quartier, das Mandarin Oriental entsprach zu 90% unseren Vorstellungen. Hier merkt man wirklich, das die Seele jedes Hotels eigentlich sein Personal ist. Hier ist äußerst geschultes und sehr freundliches Personal am Werk. Jeder Wunsch ist machbar, es wird mit größter Aufmerksamkeit gehandelt und agiert. Das Frühstück ist toll und auch hier sind die Mitarbeiter des Hotels so aufmerksam, das sogar eine Diabetiker Marmelade am nächsten Tag am Tisch stand. Vielen Dank hier an diesem Punkt, an Jose Miguel und sein Team.... sehr aufmerksam.
Wir haben uns super wohl gefühlt im Mandarin Oriental, und es schläft sich toll in diesen Betten und wenn es was zu kritisiert gäbe, so ist dies das Bad bzw. die Dusche in einem Mandarin Room, (andere Zimmer habe ich nicht gesehen..), denn es entzieht sich gänzlich meinem Verständnis, den Duschkopf direkt unter der Deckenlampe des Nassbereichs anzubringen... ohne Duschtasse oder in der Wanne zu stehen, und beim duschen, quasi das ganze Bad unter Wasser zu setzen,...... ach ja und der Fernseher und dessen Fernbedienung benötigen auch einen eigenen Fernkurs und eine Bedienungsanleitung um Fernsehen zu können, aber dann sind alle Standard Programme vorhanden.. auch deutsche........
Aber all dies kann ein gemütliches und sehr schönes Wochenende in diesem tollen Hotel nicht beeinflussen......",4,2016,12,18

44,Eigentlich wirklich nichts besonderes,"es waren 2 Nächte in diese Hotel geplant! Hab aber nach einer Nacht das Hotel verlassen!
Ich hatte ein Zimmer mit Balkon gebucht, bekam dann ein upgrade zur einer suite..... natürlich war es größer aber nicht besonders groß und hatte leider keinen Balkon! Deswegen habe ich gesagt ich würde gerne mein gebuchtes Zimmer haben...eine Mandarin Room. Eigentlich auch schon eine bessere Kategorie. 
Das Zimmer war winzig.....das Badezimmer erinnerte mich an ein kleines Segelboot.... Dusche Wc Waschbecken Badewanne....alles in einem Raum und noch dazu ein kleiner Raum! 
Ehrlich gesagt..... das Zimmer im Motel One oder Hotel Ibis ist nicht schlechter!!!!!
Aber der Balkon war wenigstens schön!

Es waren im Hotel alle so richtig geschult freundlich. Nur leider wenig dahinter! 

Concierge:  Um 19 Uhr ging ich zum Concierge und ersuchte ihm er möge bitte in dem von mir vorgeschlagenem restaurant einen Tisch für 22 Uhr reservieren. Er sagte mir er macht das und gibt mir dann gleich bescheid.
Ich gin ins Zimmer und um 21:15 hatte ich noch immer keine Info ob er nun reserviert hat oder nicht..... nach dem ich aber wissen musste ob ich nun in 45 Minuten einen Tisch habe oder nicht habe ich den Concierge angerufen und daraufhin meinte er, ja das lokal ist leider voll.
Ich fragte ob das nun sein ernst sei, denn wieso sagt er mir das nicht früher .....   er hat dann irgendwelche blöden ausreden genannt und ich hab darauf hin aufgelegt und selbst in dem Restaurant angerufen.... und komischer weise habe ich dann für 22:15 einen Tisch bekommen.
Also der hat einfach nicht angerufen...vergessen oder was auch immer!
Mir wäre lieber gewesen er hätte mir ehrlich gesagt warum denn jeder kann mal was vergessen..... aber so wie das abgelaufen ist geht das garnicht!!!!!

FAZIT: so ein Concierge ist das letzte!!!!

SPA: naja ich hätte versucht einen Termin zu bekommen aber es war alles ausgebucht. Also ein 6 Sterne City Hotel welches am selben Tag keine Massagen mehr frei hat.... der spa sollte gleich geschlossen werden..... also das ist mir noch selten ein so einem Hotel passiert!!!! 

FAZIT: Schönes Indoorpool, auch guts Service im  Spa aber leider keine Behandlungen bekommen!

Frühstück:  Toller Raum....schöne Möbeln! Essen zum vergessen. Die Rühreier waren kalt! usw usw.....

Fazit: einfach nicht frühstücken gehen!

DACHBAR: ja sehr sehr schön aber erst um 12 Uhr offen. Da ich aber auf mein Zimmer einige Stunden warten musste hab ich zwar platz nehmen können, aber es war nicht möglich das sie mir wenigstens ein Cola mit Ice bringen...... also mir nicht begreiflich!

FAZIT: zum vergessen.

Ich habe dann aus geschäftlichen Gründen Gott sei Dank eine Nacht früher das Hotel verlassen müssen und mir war bewusst dass ich die eine Nacht nicht mehr stornieren kann. Aber trotzdem fragte ich nach ob man mir entgegenkommen könnte ! Aber es kam ein sehr freundlich geschultes ""leider nein"" zurück! Finde ich auch nicht unbedingt perfekt! Irgendwas hätte man mir anbieten können...... Vor allem wenn ich an die Aktion vom Concierge denke....

Also ich war nun schon sehr oft in Barcelona. Meistens im Hotel Arts oder im W ! Und beide sind wirklich tolle Hotels und nicht zu vergleichen mit dem Mandarin Orienal!
Ich werde dieses Hotel sicher nicht mehr buchen und kann es auch keinem Empfehlen!!!!!
Ich bin von Barcelona direkt nach Dubai ins Four Seasons Jumeirah geflogen....und naja liebes Mandarin Oriental Barcelona Team.....von dem FS könnt ihr viel lernen!!!!! Siehe Bewertung Four Seasons at Jumeirah",3,2016,11,02
44,Muy agradable,"Estuve con mi pareja tomando algo en la terraza que tienen, por la noche. Sitio muy agradable,tranquilo tipo zona chill out, con piscina aunque no la pudimos aprovechar por que hacia algo de fresco.
El servicio bueno, aunque se supone que con lo que cobran por una copa ya puede serlo.
Para ir un par de veces al año no esta mal.",5,2016,10,20
44,Excelente ubicación ,"Ubicado en el paseo de gracia éste hotel se encuentra localizado excepcionalmente para los que les gustan las compras y los buenos restaurantes. Se puedo ir caminando a la plaza de Cataluña, las ramblas y las ramblas de Cataluña. El hotel es moderno y cuenta con un lobby excepcional, las habitaciones son muy cómodas con muy buena vista a la calle. ",5,2016,10,09
44,Un gigante en decadencia,"Este hotel cada vez decae mas. 
La limpieza en las habitaciones deja que desear. En varias ocasiones pasaron mas de 24 horas sin que nadie viniera a limpiar, hubo que llamarles y se disculparon argumentando que el hotel estaba lleno. O sea, que no se limpian las habitaciones porque no contratan suficiente personal. Sin comentarios. 
Pero continuo: El restaurante ""moments"", por ejemplo: tardan muchísimo en atenderte, una vez espere media hora por queso y vino. Ni siquiera recibi una triste disculpa. Tampoco el desayuno es digno de un mandarin. Poquisima fruta y pobre variedad de todo en general. Pocos camareros que no dan abasto. Esperas 30 minutos por un cafe con leche, 20 para que te traigan un te.. Hablamos de un desayuno de 46 euros. No los vale. Ni el desayuno ni el servicio.
Otro desastre parecido es el bar/lounge de la azotea. Increibles 25,- euros por un mojito hecho casi solo con hielo triturado y una ridicula pizca de limon y ron. Vergonzoso. Una vez tuvimos que esperar que se vaciara una mesa que estaba pagando, y un camarero nos pidio que esperasemos fuera, en el pasillo de la azotea. Como si estuviesemos molestando a los clientes que estaban sentados! Increíble porque estabamos en una zona COMUN, con piscina, bar, eramos huespedes del hotel..etc etc. Sin palabras. 
A mi, al menos, cada vez me impulsan mas a reservar en el Palace, que no esta en el paseo de gracia, pero sigue siendo impecable, sin altibajos ni ahorros forzosos en personal.",3,2016,10,02
44,"Zentral, modern, schön","Wirklich eine super Lage. Ich habe alles zu Fuß angesehen. Bei dem angenehmen Klima kein Problem.  Ob man chic Richtung Cartier geht oder zur anderen seite Richtung Küste.

Rundum perfekter Service. Heller angenehmer Frühstücksraum man sitzt dort nicht gedrängt. Umfangreiches asiatische, spanisches, europäisches Frühstück bester Qualität.

Große helle Zimmer. Viel schrankplatz. Perfekte Dusche. Ganz leiser airconditioner.

Das Fitnessstudio habe ich nur angesehen sieht sehr gut aus. Den 12 m langen Pool täglich genutzt. 30grad warm, leicht salziges Wasser, herrlich.  Man hat einen extra Fahrstuhl zum spa und Pool, sodass man in den angenehmen Bademänteln gleich richtig ankommt. 

Wunderbare dachterrasse, toller Blick und viele köstliche kleine Snacks gibt s dort. Sonnenliegen und loungesessel ebenso. 

Absolut zu empfehlen dieses Hotel.

44,"Ubicacion, estilo y calidad","Perfectamente ubicado en el Passeig de Gràcia. Excepcional primera impresion con la majestuosa entrada del Mandarin Oriental, cadena hotelera referente de lujo. Hotel moderno y elegante.
Cuenta con un antiguo patio interior de manzana, el cual han convertido un bonito y agradable espacio, el Jardín Mimosa donde la comida es original, fresca y realmente exquisita. Tambien en la planta baja el hotel alberga el Restaurante Moments con 2 estrellas Michelin.
El desayuno es a la carta y tiene ademas un buffet variado y muy bueno. Se sirve en un espacio acogedor, amplio, una planta mas abajo de la Recepción, desde la cual se tiene una fantastica vista de este área.
Bonitas vistas de la ciudad desde su terraza donde ademas hay una pequeña piscina.
La habitacion en la que me alojé, moderna y con mucha luz gracias al gran ventanal que daba salida a una terraza con vistas al patio interior. Cama muy confortable y baño amplio con plato de ducha y bañera separados.
Muy buena opcion en Barcelona.",5,2016,09,29
44,Una experiencia regular,"Pornel precio que se paga, las habitaciones regulares son ridiculamente pequeñas.  No tiene sentido el espacio.  Nuestras maletas estuvieron todo el tiempo desorganizadas, la television imposible de prender aunque era una bang and olufsen, el sistema de luces, dificil de usar, hasta hoy sigo sin saber como prender y apagar las luces, tenemos que tocar todos los interruptores hasta que con suerte logramos medio apagarlas.   La vista es triste y oscura.  Da a un colegio que ademas se escucha el ruido de lis ninos jugando.  No que no me gusten los ninos jugando, pero estamos en el mandarin oriental, y no en el oriente mandarin donde esto seria mas normal.   En fin.  Las cosas buenas:   La mejor ubicacion, el servicio es bueno, los pasillos huelen bien, la terraza es hermosa, pero no me volveria a quedar en este hotel nunca mas!",3,2016,09,27
44,Nada de excepcional ,"Fui con un amigo a tomar algo en la terrazza que es muy bonita para tomar unos cocktalis de la casa! El personal nos ha fallado un poco, en el sentido que el camarero no supo explicarnos los ingredientes de los cocktails y nos trajo los snacks después de los cocktalis, después de haber preguntado por ellos cordialmente. Al final todo bien hemos disfrutado del ambiente en general!",3,2016,09,25
44,Lindas vistas,"Estuve en la piscina a finales de julio y aunque es súper pequeña tiene una vista espectacular y el servicio muy profesional y muy simpático.el hotel es muy bonito y me encanta como huele,me trae buenos recuerdos y es muy acogedor.",5,2016,09,21

44,Ein Traum,Es war alles extrem stimmig. Perfekt ausgestattete Suite mit Butlerservice - VIP Service und Limo ab/zum Flughafen inklusive. Sehr gute Meetingräume und perfekter Service.

44,Ein echtes Highlight der Stadt,"Mehr oder weniger zufällig sind wir auf das Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona gestoßen - naja, mit einem Haus der Kette liegt man eigentlich immer richtig. 

Schon bei der recht frühen Anreise wurden wir angenehm überrascht: Der Zugang zu Lobby fürhrt über eine Laufsteg-ähnliche Rampe und wird flankiert durch einige der elegantesten Boutiquen der Stadt. Alle Mitarbeiter, mit denen wir in Kontakt kamen waren auf eine sehr entspannte Art zuvorkommt, unsere Bedürfnisse wurden geradezu vorausgeahnt. Besser kann man das nicht machen, das ist internationale Spitzenklasse. Besonders das Team des Butler-Services möchte ich hier hervorheben.

Unsere Suite war atemberaubend: sehr viel Raum und eine moderne Einrichtung, wie ich sie mir eigentlich heute in Luxushotels wünsche. Es wirkt nichts überladen, alle Einrichtungsgegenstände wirken extrem hochwertig. Auch, was in dem Leistungssegmet eigentlich zu der Pflichtausstattung gehört war da: eine private Nespresso-Maschine, 2 große LCD-Screens und eine separate Dusche. Traumhaft übrigens die Amenities von Aqua di Parma in Großpackungen. Sowohl der tages- als auch der abendliche Turndown-Service waren makellos.

Das Frühstück dann gehörte ebenfalls mit zu dem besten, was ich aus Stadthotels kenne: großartig die spanische Schinken und Wurstauswahl als auch die Leistungen des Personals.

Wohl kein echter Geheimtipp mehr: die Dachterrasse mit Plungepool und stylischer Bar auf dem Dach des Hotels mit einem unschlagbaren Blick über Barcelona.

Vielleicht hat man es schon bemerkt: Das Mandarin Oriental gehört zu meinen neuen Lieblingshotels in Europa!",5,2016,09,08
44,Excelente Estadia en Barcelona,"No pudimos tener mejor ubicación con este hotel.  Desde que llegas el personal es super amable y siempre dispuesto a resolver cualquier inquietud.  Las instalaciones del hotel no pueden estar mas bonitas y tiene muchas areas que si no deseas salir puedes aprovecharla. Las habitaciones lindas y limpias y con areas para estar dentro de ella.
El desayuno exquisito, variado y sabroso.  Me encantó haber tomado la decisión de hospedarme en el Mandarin Oriental. Lo recomiendo",5,2016,08,29
44,Ottima struttura,"È probabilmente uno dei migliori alberghi della città, ottimamente posizionato nella strada delle griffe della città, abbastanza distante dalla confusione delle ramblas. Ottimi i ristoranti interni, tutti con stelle Michelin. Ampiamente ricca la colazione, internazionale, per chi come il sottoscritto è rimasto dispiaciuto dal non trovare dei più prosaici churros, basta chiederli per il mattino seguente e verranno preparati sul momento per un vero piacere del palato",5,2016,08,27
44,Grandios!,"Schon bei der Ankunft im Hotel wurden wir mehr als freundlich empfangen. Das Lächeln der MitarbeiterInnen wirkt ansteckend und vermittelt das Gefühl überaus willkommen zu sein. Dass wir auf unser Zimmer ein kostenloses Upgrade erhalten haben, war mehr als wir zu träumen gewagt hätten und so kam es, dass wir unser Wochenende in einer der schönsten Suiten, inkl. Butler-Service, verbringen durften. Es war einfach wundervoll!
Das Hotel ist überaus elegant. Die Stimmung ist ruhig und es finden sich auch in den Freibereichen viele Ecken in die man sich ungestört zurückziehen kann.
Das Personal ist durchgehend freundlich und sehr aufmerksam. Wir wurden meist mit Namen angesprochen und schon bald waren die Angestellten mit unseren Vorlieben vertraut.
Die Küche ist sehr gut. Im Restaurants „Moments“ haben wir eines der besten Menüs aller Zeiten gegessen. Witzig, verspielt und auf höchstem Niveau zubereitet. 
Die Lage des Hotels in unmittelbarer Nähe zu den Gaudi-Häusern ist sehr zentral und auch die Altstadt kann innerhalb weniger Minuten erreicht werden. 
Ich kann dieses Hotel uneingeschränkt empfehlen!",5,2016,08,23
44,Aniversario de bodas ,"Cada año mi pareja y yo nos escapamos un fin de semana de spa y romance. Este año decidimos este hotel donde todo fue fantástico reserve un paquete de estancia romántica y tuvimos muchos detalles durante toda nuestra estancia en el check in nos realizaron un upgrade a una habitación con terraza y vistas a passeig de Gracia todo fabuloso un verdadero placer y toda nuestra estancia donde el concierge realizó un trabajo estupendo consiguiéndonos una cena especial fuera del hotel.

El bar Barkers con muy buena selección.

El spa todo un gusto ya que ha sido de los mejores tratamientos y masajes 

Desayuno incluido buffet justo pero muy bueno 

Solo un detalle en el lobby justo frente al Restaurant moments había un mal olor durante los 3 días que estuvimos ahí 

En general recomendable y excelente!!!

44,magnifica estancia,"me gustaria decir, que en cuanto a el servicio de mayordomos excelente con clementina y maria, a excepcion de un echo aunque anecdotico, me gustaria que quedara constancia, clementina hizo una reserva en el restaurante abac y creo que no me aviso con respecto al tipo de vestimenta necesaria para poder ir al restaurante al final se soluciono, luego el dia de mi vuelta tuve que volver a pasar por el hotel porque habia un pago pendiente cuando justamente esa mañana habia pasado a ver si debia algo y hacer el check out esto si me molesto, pero volveria sin dudarlo",5,2016,07,27

44,Un Oasis en Paseo de Gracia,"El Domingo decidimos ir a probar el Brunch en el Bistreau del  Hotel Mandarin Oriental. Nuestra experiencia fue muy satisfactoria. El servicio fue impecable , destacar la variedad de comida en un ambiente tranquilo y sereno que contrasta con el ruidoso Paseo de Gracia.

Muy recomendable subir al Jardín Mimosa a tomar el  té o el café , nosotros decidimos alargar la velada y tomar una copa en un ambiente relajado con un servicio siempre atento.

44,come sempre...il Migliore!!!,"Sono gia' un cliente affezionato e spesso dove c'e un mandarin mi fermo!!!
ottima la struttura a barcellona..moderna con la classica eleganza..in pieno centro.
camera con balcone perfetta!! check in super rapido...ottime le colazioni..molto bella la spa!!  una piccola nota positiva:al mio arrivo erano in ritardo di 10 minuti con la camera e allora ho approfittato x un pranzetto a bordo della bella piscina sul tetto...al momento della mia richiesta x firmare il conto...il personale mi ha comunicato che era stato offerto x il piccolo disguido....questo si che e' vera attenzione x il cliente mandarin....complimenti!!! consigliato al 100%",5,2016,06,27

44,Precios excesivos para un hotel con pretensiones,"Copa en la terraza con unos amigos hospedados, problemas para elegir mesa pues media hora antes de cerrar estaban ""reservadas"".
Insiestiendo que eran huespedes pudimos elegir mesa, vasos de plástico, poca variedad de ginebras, calidad cuestionable a precios de lujo.
El servicio todo extranjero que domina poco el español. El bar de la primera planta con mucho olor a tabaco que provenia de la terraza a pocos metros. Visitamos la habitación de nuestros amigos, para mi gusto no corresponde a los más de 600€ que pagaron. Una decepción, no lo recomendaria.",3,2016,06,19
44,eccellente,"Tutto eccellente. Ti accorgi subito di essere arrivato in un posto dove tutto è curato nei minimi particolari. Arrivi e si fa avanti l'addetto alle valige. La reception ti ringrazia all'arrivo e all'uscita con una stretta di mano. La stanza impeccabile con tre volte al giorno le pulizie. La colazione...ti sembra di essere in un posto curato alla perfezione anche nell'arredamento, insomma il top. Ah dimenticavo...la veduta dall'ultimo piano dove si trova la piscina è da mozzafiato.

Lo dicho, una experiencia inolvidable.

El servicio, desde que entras por la ""rampa"" es atento, en recepción se vuelcan contigo, en los restaurantes atención exquisita en todo momento... y los amenities en la habitación???? Un lujazo llegar y encontrar la botella de agua fria, fruta... 

Tuve la oportunidad de tener una habitación con salida al Paseo de Gracia, eso... impagable, levantarme por la mañana y lo primero que hice fue salir al balcon a respirar el aire fresco. 

La habitación una de las más grandes de su categoria, comoda, un estilo en la decoración exquisito, baño comodo, y la cama... todavía recuerdo el gustazo de dormir en la cama mandarín, la almohada increiblemente cómoda y confortable... 

en lo relativo a espacios comunes, el restaurante Bistreau un 10 en la comida y desayuno y despues, la piscina - solarium del piso de arriba y el jardín mimosa... fabulosos. 

en definitiva, volvería a hospedarme en el Mandarin de Barcelona sin dudarlo. Lo recomiendo abiertamente.

No dudeis en probar la experiencia Mandarin, no os defraudará.",5,2016,04,28

Te reciben con una cva de bienvenida, y luego pasas a un buffet q es extraordinario. Luego pudes elegir de los platos de la carta, las veces q quieras. Uno era mejor q el otro. Los jugos son libres, al igual q la mesa de postres y el cafe. No me parecio caro por el lugar, la calidad y la atencion. Los menores de 17 pagan la mitad. Repetiria en cuanto vuelva a BArcelona",5,2016,04,24
44,Excelente,En general esta cadena se encuentra entre las mejores y este hotel no es la excepcion.. Las habitaciones son lindas y comodas.. Pero lo mejor que tiene este hotel es el personal.. De los mejores hoteles en que estuve alojada.. Es un poco injusto decirlo ya que todos son realmente extraordinarios y muy calidos pero Albert de conserjeria merece una mencion especial.. Conoce de gastronomia como nadie y habla fluidamente varios idiomas.. El mejor conserje que he conocido.. Realmente un excelente hotel que vale la pena conocer,5,2016,04,21

Ocupamos una suite con una terraza y una vista maravillosa. La atención personalizada es excelente. No te hacen faltar nada. Y no falta nada. Pero más allá de las comodidades, la amabilidad del personal es lo que lo hace diferente. Ni hablar de la ubicación del hotel. En el corazón del pasaje de Grazia. Cerca de todo.

Questa suite prevede l'affiancamento del maggiordomo, stanza studio, terrazzo attrezzatissimo, soggiorno con tavolo presidenziale, frigo bar dotato di qualsiasi tipo di bevanda alcolica ed analcolica, stanza doccia, 2 stanze bagno, stanza con vasca da bagno, stanza armadio e tanto altro... La disponibilità del personale, in particolare Ona e Javier, ci ha fatto sentire coccolati. Il servizio consergie è eccellente come pure il servizio in camera, la governante e la lavanderia. La pulizia è maniacale e la stanza è dotata di ogni confort. Insomma, è un peccato uscire dal l'hotel per andare a passeggio. La posizione è centralissima. Lo consiglio vivamente!",5,2016,03,29

Del Hotel, que comentar, que como todos sus hermanos dispone de unas instalaciones estupendas a un alto nivel, aunque comparado con Londres o Nueva York no contemple el total de los servicios que los anteriores ofrecen.
La atención es siempre correcta pero señores "" ring, ring, es hora de despertarse"" , a estos niveles no se pueden cometer errores como dejar una habitación sin finalizar la totalidad de su limpieza y que la gobernanta no haya chequeado su estado. Detalles como este hacen que cierto tipo de clientes dejen de.confiar en una marca. 
Sería importante que Barcelona fuera capaz de ofrecer los mismos niveles de calidad que encontramos en el resto del mundo.",3,2016,03,06
44,Un excelente hotel para negocios,"Esta es la segunda vez que me quedo en el hotel durante mi estancia en Barcelona, el servicio de primera desde que llegas. Hay que añadir que este hotel antes era un banco y la remodelación fue excelente. El restaurante es de lo mejor no puedes fallar, pero difícil conseguir mesa. El bar tiene cócteles muy buenos un poco caros pero vale la pena, está muy céntrico el hotel, lo único que los precios han subido y prepárate para pagar caro pero si te gusta lo bueno no hay problema vale la pena ",5,2016,03,05

44,Il sapore d,"La Passeig de Gràcia é una delle vie più belle di Barcellona non solo per le opere di architettura modernista di Gaudi, dichiarate dal patrimonio dell'umanità ma perché in questo quartiere può trovare uno degli alberghi più belli. Il Mandarin Oriental...che dire, un posto magico, atmosfera internazionale, personale eccezionale e disponibilissimo. L'ordine e la pulizia regna sovrana, niente fuori posto, nessuna sbavatura emozionate come posto.
Poi devo dire posto strategico. si trova nella parte centrale dell'Eixample che collega la Placa Catalunya  con il quartiere di Gràcia ed incrocia le due strade principali di Barcellona la Gran Via de les Corts Catlanes e L'Avinguada Diagonal. 

Peccato che la terrazza fosse chiusa, ma tornerò presto a Barcellona.

44,Ni en el mejor de los sueños,"La pasada Navidad era mi cumpleaños y no podía haber mejor regalo que celebrarlo en el Hotel Mandarín. He ido a varios hoteles de lujo y ya sabes que tipo de requisitos deben cumplir, pero hay detalles que no están escritos y son los que marcan la diferencia. Y estos detalles son las personas quienes los tienen , con su delicadeza, sus sonrisas, sus comentarios amables; al levantarme por la mañana todo eran felicitaciones y unas sonrisas de oreja a oreja. Realmente ha sido un cumpleaños inolvidable, también agradecer el pastel y la botella de cava que encontré en mi habitación.",5,2016,02,22

44,Un 5 estrellas gran lujo sin cafeteria,"Esta opinión la escribo con profunda decepción. Estando en Barcelona, y teniendo varias reuniones por delante imprevistas, decidí hospedarme en la ciudad. A tal efecto, pensé en un hotel confortable y céntrico, en Paseo de Gracia. Unos amigos me recomendaron este establecimiento. Así pues, decidí entrar , tomar un café y hacer algo de tiempo hasta quedar con ellos. el hotel antes de coger una habitación. Al llegar, pregunté por la cafetería, en la planta -1. Me senté, y estuve esperando 15 minutos, hasta que literalmente me echaron de la misma, diciéndome que estaba cerrada, y que no podía tomar algo en todo este hotel, porque el bar no abría hasta las 17 y eran las 16:20... En un 5 estrellas gran lujo me resultó algo simplemente bochornoso, tanto el hecho en sí como las formas... Así pues, salí, caminé unos metros, y me hospedé en el Majestic. Si esto es lujo asiático, me quedo con el buen gusto clásico de otros establecimientos. ",2,2016,01,28

44,Ausgezeichnetes Hotel,"Wir hatten eine Suite gebucht und bekamen einen Upgrade nach der Ankunft im Hotel. Das großzügig zugeschnittene und elegant eingerichtete Zimmer sagte uns sofort zu, ehe wir das betraten. Eigentlich empfanden wir das Zimmer als Wohnung - derart gemütlich und wohnlich war es. Die Einrichtung war modern und hochwertig, dafür aber heimelig. Das bequeme Bett sorgte für eine gute Schlafqualität. Das Bett wurde täglich frisch überzogen - ohne dass wir das Personal daran eigens zu erinnern hätten, wie es heutzutage auch in vielen Fünf-Sterne- Hotels leider der Fall ist. Das Zimmer wurde gewissenhaft geputzt. Das geräumige Badezimmer war mit hochwertigen Körperpflegeprodukten von Aqua Parma ausgestattet. Als Begrüßungsgeschenk bekamen wir eine Flasche Rotwein. Jeden Abend wartete auf uns aufm Zimmer eine kostenlose Schlale Obst. In allen Räumen gab es gratis WLAN, die Verbindung funktionierte schnell und zuverlässig. Als Suite-Bewohner durften wir den Butler-Service im Hotel in Anspruch nehmen, und davon machten wir gerne Gebrauch. Alle unsere Wünsche wurden schnell und gewissenhaft erfüllt. Alles in allem: wir haben unseren Aufenthalt in diesem Hotel richtig genossen.",5,2016,01,01

Der Concierge half uns bei der Auswahl eines Restaurants für den Abend, das natürlich gut besucht war. Klar bekamen wir einen Tisch ... :-). Sollten Sie nach Barcelona kommen, sollten Sie definitiv in diesem Hotel übernachten. Sie werden es nicht bereuen. Falls Sie dort nicht wohnen, sollten Sie aber jedenfalls die Bar auf der Dachterrasse besuchen.

44,"Modernes Hotel, tolle Lage, perfekter Service aber Abstriche beim Zimmer","Super Lage, sehr modern eingerichtet, wie im Mandarin nicht anders gewohnt perfekter Service. Schöner Spa Bereich und eine supertolle Dachterasse. Wir hatten ein Zimmer mit Balkon und Gartenblick ( für 515 € mit Frühstück das günstigste).
Wenn man aber die Zimmer mit denen von Mandarin in Prag oder München vergleicht, dann macht diese Kategorie eher einen dürftigen Eindruck. Sehr modern, schon fast kalt eingerichtet, sehr klein und verbaut. Das Bad eher schlicht, für uns überhaupt nicht edel. Auch der Service im Zimmer für diesen Preis sehr einfach. Nur ein Kissen, relativ einfache Bettwäsche, keine Tagesdecken. Am ersten Tag einen Obstkorb mit Besteck. Von den 4 Teilen haben wir sofort 3 gegessen. Am Abend wurde das schmutzige Geschirr entfernt und nie mehr aufgefüllt, genau so wie das Obst. Die Kiwi lag die restlichen 4 Tage alleine in seiner Schale (ohne Besteck auch schwer zu essen). Auch beim zweiten Service eher lieblos, nur das Tablett mit Wäschezettel und Frühstückstüranhänger auf dem Bett, nicht wie z.B. in München mit Wetterbericht , gute Nachtwünschen, Betthupferl usw. Kurz gesagt, da hatten wir in weit aus günstigeren Hotels bessere Zimmer mit besseren Zimmer service.
Es fällt mir schwer als absoluter Mandarinfan dass zu schreiben, aber wir waren einfach von den Zimmern enttäuscht und würden uns auch in Barcelona nicht mehr für das Mandarin entscheiden.",3,2015,08,31
44,Sin palabras,"El hotel es espectacular, precioso. Nosotros sólo estuvimos en la terraza, que tiene unas vistas privilegiadas de la ciudad, con una pequeña piscina para los pies, tiene una zona de sofás bordeando la piscina y otra para poder cenar. El servicio es increíble, tomamos un mojito mandarín que estaba buenísimo, diferente al mojito típico. La única pega es que fui al servicio con mi hijo de 3 años y estaba sucísimo, la verdad es que me dio mucho asco, para ser un hotel de esa categoría no me lo esperaba.

44,Muy confortable y el spa increible,"Fui con mi novia y los servicios de habitación excelentes, la calidad del duvet en la cama era espectacular!, si alguien del hotel lee esto y me puede decir la marca o tipo de material, lo agradecería muuuucho. El servicio en el spa es único y tienen un servicio personalizado en el cual tu seleccionas que tipo de masaje requieres y lo aplican sin problema, las instalaciones del spa adecuadas. En los restaurantes y el room service la carta es prácticamente la misma, muy pequeña la lista y al segundo día prefieres ir a comer a otro lugar. Solicite el servicio de romantic turndown y súper bien, además de las rosas que pedí a la habitación de muy buena calidad también. El servicio es excelente por todo el personal, la vista de la terraza es muy bonita y puedes observar la casa Batllò desde aquí. Es para presupuestos altos, pero si quieres una estancia romántica no falla.",5,2015,08,19
44,Confort confirmado,"Sabemos que la cadena de los Mandarín Oriental es una garantía, pero confirmarlo es más agradable, aunque sus habitaciones son reducidas, tienen el buen gusto y detalle que te hace sentir excelente.

Sus instalaciones son de primera, las habitaciones de muy buen gusto y tamaño.
Los restaurantes son muy buenos (desde el bufete del desayuno que es variado y de muy buen sabor, hasta el prestigiado Moments que es toda una experiencia de sabor y atenciones).
El SPA es impresionante, muy buenas instalaciones para el ejercicio, alberca y vapor.
El servicio, como siempre, de primera, desde que te reciben en la puerta de la calle te sientes bien atendido.

44,Ein Juwel mit einer schönen Dachterrasse,"Das Hotel ist in einer sehr gut gelegenen Lage. Die Zimmer sind wunderschön und die Ausstattung Modern. Es fehlt an nichts. Das Personal am Empfang, Concierge sowie in den Restaurants ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Der Pool sowie der Fitness raum bitten alles was man braucht um sich auszupowern. Das Dampfbad ist sehr angenehm mit den Liegen zur Entspannung. Vor dem Hotel fährt auch ein Hop On Hop Off Bus was ich als sehr angenehm empfand. 

Danke an das Personal ich werde wieder kommen",5,2015,07,02
44,Ungezwungener Luxus,"Wir hatten endlich einen guten Babysitter für unser Kleinkind gefunden (Schwiegereltern, wer sonst?) und flogen kurzfristig für drei Tage nach Barcelona. Wir buchten das Mandarin, da wir bereits sehr gute Erfahrungen mit dieser Kette in New York und München gesammelt hatten. Meine Frau fragte mich im Vorfeld, wieso ich keine  Restaurantreservierung oder sonstige Vorvereitung getätigt habe, was ich normalerweise akribisch mache. Das macht der Concierge bestimmt, war meine Antwort. Und genauso war es auch. Innerhalb kürzester Zeit stellte der hervorragende Concierge das für uns optimale Programm zusammen. Es,fehlte nichts und es war nicht zuviel. Vielen Dank nochmal. Vom exquisitem Fischrestaurant bis hin zur rustikalen Tapas Bar (Bar Mont, sehr zu empfehlen) war alles dabei. Natürlich speisten wir auch einen Abend im Sternerestaurant des Hotels. Ein Elebnis. Wenn man bedenkt, wieviel Geld man über die Tage mit reiner Nahrungsaufnahme und wenig damit verbundenem Genuss ausgibt, war es uns das allemal wert. Die Zimmer und der sonstige Service fünf Sterne, keine Frage. Hervorzuheben wäre noch das exzellente Frühstück, eine Kombination von Büffet und á la Carte.
Fazit: es kostet, klar. Aber durch dieses Hotel machte den Unterschied von einem sehr guten zu einem wunderbaren Barcelona-Aufenthalt.",5,2015,06,25
44,Muy buena ubicación,"La ubicación que tiene es estratégica. El servicio que brinda es muy bueno, desayuno completo, cuidado cada detalle de diseño. Las habitaciones son cómodas y el room service es excelente también.

44,"fantastischer Service, beste Lage und grandiose Suiten","Jedes mal, wenn man die lange frei schwebende Treppe aus dem Hotel hinaus auf die große Allee schlendert kommt man sich ein wenig wie ein Filmstar vor. Der Service ist aufmerksam, schnell und intelligent. So, wie es sein muss. Das Frühstück wird im wunderschönen großzügigen Innenhof serviert und ist von hoher Qualität und großer Auswahl. Wir haben uns immer darauf gefreut. :) Ich empfehle Restaurant Besuche und Attraktionen wie die Sagrada Familie und Casa Batlo beim Concierge zu buchen um an den Schlangen vorbei zu kommen. Spa ist fantastisch und zurecht ausgezeichnet. Die coole Bar mit Live Music und DJ ist eine schöne Alternative zum pulsierenden Nachtleben von Barcelona. Wir kommen wieder. Keine Frage. Hervorzuheben ist das wohl schnellste Internet, dass ich je in einem Hotel genießen konnte.",5,2015,04,20

44,Parece pero no.,"Me he alojado este fin de semana en este hotel quería conocerlo porque había oído hablar de él y de restaurante Moment. Me alojé en una habitación estándar.  No es nada del otro mundo. Habitación mediocre para el precio. Las diferencias empiezan a partir de la Hab. Mandarín fuera de eso hay hoteles mejores. Con respecto al Moment ya escribí mi opinión sólo decir que cómo es posible que en un restaurante de esta categoría tengas que pedir que te pongan una servilleta. Incomprensible. Cuanto más tiempo pasa más enfadada y estafa me siento. 
Lo mejor el personal del hotel. Amables, correctos, cercanos, muy profesionales. Hacen del hotel mucho más de lo que es. Enhorabuena a todos ellos.",3,2014,11,19

Insgesamt eine sehr schöne Innenarchitektur die sich auch in den Zimmer fortsetzt. Auffallend ist auch das umfangreiche Frühstücksbüffet.
Negativ: armselig ist, dass bei einem zimmerpreis von rd 500,- noch 18,- pro Tag für wifi berechnet werden.
Die Türen der Zimmer fallen sehr laut ins Schloss!",4,2014,11,08
44,Un buen sitio para hacer reuniones,"Ir a un hotel en el centro de Barcelona tiene sus ventajas a la hora de hacer actividades típicas de una gran ciudad.

El hotel es muy tranquilo y el trato muy bueno.

Hay que tener en cuenta que un un hotel muy bien situado y por tanto sale caro.",4,2014,10,16
44,"Si,  pero no","Hacer la crítica de este hotel me resulta un poc complicado por como fue todo...pero intentaré ser lo más objetiva posible...Mi marido y yo hacíamos años de casados por lo que él se esforzó en sorprenderme con este regalo el 3 de octubre, repito, REGALO. Hasta un par de horas antes no sabia dónde me llevaba, así que al final me dijo el sitio y me presenté yo sola porque él volvia de viaje y se unia más tarde. Me insitió mucho en que al llegar sabían perfectamente que era un regalo por lo que no me pedirían ni  targeta de crédito, ni tarifa ni nada, y que evidentemente no teia que ver el precio. Al llegar, ya empezó la cosa un poco mal, porque la chica de recepción , y mira que se lo dije, insitió en pedirme la targeta como depósito y en enseñarme la hoja de registro con el precio total etc...por lo que de sorpesa de regalo, poco!Le dije que no tenia porque saber el precio que era un regalo, y por suerte, como sin gafas no veo, no vi lo que costaba...eran más de las 15h por lo que la habitación tenia que estar de sobras, pero me hicieron esperar 20minutos, ofreciendome una simple agua que encima me trajeron sin vaso. Cuando al final me llevaron a la habitación, esta era la 1a planta que daba directo al Paseo de Gracia,que ya de por si es ruidoso, por lo que si encima le añades que estaban haciendo obras, el ruido era importante. La habitación en si, nada del otro mundo, no para un 5 estrellas lujo ni mucho menos, y el baño muy simple y sin bañera. Al ser mayoritáriamente en blanco, hay que cuidar mucho las paredes, y en este caso, se veían ya un poco rozadas... Llamé para ver si podían, antes de que llegara mi marido, darnos otra habitación. Maria, creo que se llamaba, una chica muy amable, me lo gestionó y me traslado a una habitación de la 7a planta que daba a la otra calle. Esta habitación mucho mejor, ruido 0 la verdad! y era más esapaciosa y el baño con bañera y ducha. La decoración era similar en ambas, minimalista, siguiendo el estilo de esta cadena. La chica se diculpó por la espera, el descuido de la recepcionista que argumentó que estaba en prácticas, la 1a habitación asignada etc...y como mi marido había insistido al hacer la reserva que era una ocasión especial, me dijo que por la noche nos prepararían la bañera con pétalos, velas etc...lo que se lo agradecí y que también se lo dijo a mi marido cuando él llegó...que sobretodo no nos preocupáramos que intentaría que la mala experiencia de la llegada se compensara con el resto de estancia.  Mi marido reservó también el spa, que es muy  pequeño y justo, y un masaje de una hora, que este si que hay que decir que de los mejores que me han dado. En recepción sabian perfectamente que esábamos de 7 a 8.30 en el spa, por lo que se deduce que debian de preapra la cobertura de la habitación y estos detalles que nos dijeron, durante este tiempo. El resultado? que llegamos después de los masajes con el albornoz etc y con el tiempo justos para ir a cenar, y nos encontramos las chicas de la limpieza haciendo la cama y diciéndonos que si nos podíamos esperar 15 minutos...¿increible no? evidentemente les dijimos que no y que volvieran luego, pensadndo qu equizá a la vuelta de la cena, tendríamos lo que nos prometieron como detalle de boda y por las molestias, pero al volver, nada de nada...Mi conclusión es que en este Hotel hay una descordinación total, porque sinó no sé entiende. Independientemente de todos estos incidentes que hicieron que lo que tenia que ser una celebración especial, se quedará en poca cosa, el hotel para mi no vale lo que cuesta ni mucho menos. He ido a varios hoteles de lujo de la ciudad de Barcelona, y el precio por lo que ofrecen es desorbitado. Lo bueno, la ubicación porque está en el centro, y la ambailidad de la mayoría del personal así como el desayuno. Por le resto, tanto habitaciones, zonas comunes, terraza superior con charca mas que piscina, no se corresponde a un 5 estrellas lujo. Mi conclusión, es que hay otras opciones mejores y que , ojo si quieres sorprender a tu pareja, porque la sorpresa te la llevaras tu!!",3,2014,10,15

Stanze decisamente comode con bagni ampi e spaziosi. grandissima pulizia e servizio impeccabile. prezzo ""impegnativo"" ma risponde alle aspettative!",5,2014,10,14
44,Muy caro para lo que es. Descoordinación total!,"La habitación no es espectacular para su precio, hay mejores hoteles en Barcelona por este precio. 
El servicio es muy amable, eso sí, pero descoordinadísimo.
Existe mucha descoordinación entre recepción y los servicios. 
Pedí una habitación alta que diese al Garden (parte de atrás, más tranquila), avisando de que era un regalo para mi mujer y que ella llegaría antes que yo, por lo que el check in ya lo haría yo posteriormente.
Pues bien, ella llegó y le pididron tooda la documentación para hacer el check in. Le enseñaron el precio! le dieron una habitación en la primera planta! y daba a paseo de Gracia! muy ruidosa.
Le regalé un masaje y nos dijeron que, al subir, tendrísmoa preparada en la habitación la bañera con aceites y pétalos de rosa... pues cuando subimos no sólo no había nada, si no que estaban las de la limpieza a medio limpiar (sabiendo que el masaje era de 7 a 8!). Por supuesto, ni aceites, ni pétalos ni nada de nada...",2,2014,10,10
44,Geburtstagsüberraschung einfach vergessen !,"Jedes Jahr feiern wir in den Geburtstag meines Mannes ""hinein""- irgendwo in einem Five Star Hotel in Europas Metropolen.Dazu gehören neben Champagner / Cava Sekt  immer ein Rosenstrauss und Canapees.
Auch mit dem MO war dieses Procedere rechtzeitig abgestimmt und von dort bestätigt.
Nachdem wenige Minuten vor Mitternacht nichts aufs Zimmer angeliefert wurde- haben wir nachgefragt. Es wurde dann zwar in letzter Sekunde ein wenig schöner Blumenstrauss ( keine Rosen ) geliefert und eine Flasche Cava. Keine Canapees.Argument seitens Zimmerservice: Auftrag wurde vergessen ! Fünf Sterne lassen grüßen !

Dies ist das erste Mal,seit vielen Jahren,dass unsere Geburtstagszeremonie absolut schief gegangen ist.

Beim Versuch der Entschuldigung seitens des Managers  of Duty wurden wir gefragt,was Sie denn für uns tun könnten !

Ja geht's noch ?
Am andern Tag stand dann eine Flasche Cava auf dem Zimmer und 4 kleine Häppchen .

Dies konnte den Effekt des ""Hineinfeierns "" nicht wiederherstellen.",3,2014,10,07
44,BUEN SERVICIO - PERO LO PAGAS CARO,Hemos elegido este hotel por su lujo y su u icacion para ir de compras!! Hemos comprado muchas cosas de lujo pero lo que mas caro nos ha salido era el hotel!! Si fuera perfecto no me importaria pagar 400€ la noche pero la limpieza era insuficiente: baño sucio (azejos y espejo aunque hay control previo por parte del housekeeping). El spa un poco cutre y nada de lujolujo!! El bar muy bonito!! El conserge muy pero muy bueno: Ha conseguido mesa en el mejor restaurante aunque estaba lleno!!!! Perfecto para compras!! Aver si uso el vale de una noche gratis que me reglaron.....,4,2014,09,24
44,Un Hotel inigualable para disfrutar Barcelona,"Pasamos dos noches en este hotel hermoso, un diseño fuera de lo normal, y muy cálido. La atención del personal es perfecta, desde la recepción hasta el personal del spa. La pileta no es profunda pero muy util para refrescase en verano y la vista hermosa. La comida del restaurante de la pileta es muy rica, oriental con toques peruana, una delicia. El spa hermoso y grande un ambiente super relajado y agradable. Hermoso para volver una y mil veces.",5,2014,09,23
44,Uno de mis lugares preferidos de la ciudad,"Soy cliente habitual de su amplia restauración. Según la época del año y el momento del día, voy a un lugar u otro de los 5 que ofrecen.

Desde luego, todas las ocasiones en que he ido han sido unas experiencias excelentes. Ofrecen calidad y trato exquisitos.

Estoy tan satisfecho que hasta incluso he confiado en celebrar mi última velada de Fin de Año, así como de cumpleaños, siguen sin defraudarme.",5,2014,09,12
44,Excelente,"Inmejorable situación
Un pub interesantísimo
Un restaurante excelente
Unas habitaciónes extraordinarias con una decoración exquisita
y un servicio maravilloso poendiente de cada detalle
En fin, que nos encantó. 
El único pero, es que es un poquillo caro.",5,2014,09,08
44,Ankommen und wohlfühlen.,"Schon die Ankunft in der Lobby des MO war ein Genuss. Weicher Teppichboden und ein angenehmer floraler Geruch waren der Grund. Das Personal beim Check In war sehr,sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit.
Auch unser Zimmer war ansprechend. Einziger Nachteil, wenn man es anders gewohnt ist, die fehlende Kaffeemaschine. Ansonsten alles vom Feinsten. 
Das zeigte sich auch beim Frühstücksbüfett. Die Auswahl der spanischen Spezialitäten incl. Cava waren toll. Hervorzuheben ist auch hier die Freundlichkeit des Servicepersonals.
Leider konnten wir nicht im Gourmetrestaurant ""Moments"" Gast sein. Grund: Betriebsferien. Aber so haben wir einen Grund mehr zum erneuten Besuch des MO.
Eine Bemerkung ist noch das ""Terrat"" wert. Der Blick von oben auf Stadt und Umgebung ist toll.
Einziges Manko: Der Pool ist wirklich nur zum ""plantschen"" geeignet. Weil nur 60cm Wassertiefe.
Alles in allem war es ein toller Aufenthalt, zumal viele Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuss erreichbar sind.
Zum Schluss nochmals, grosses Kompliment an das Personal des MO. Alle waren sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Wir kommen bestimmt wieder.",5,2014,08,16
44,Caro pero muy aconsejable,"De entrada es un hotel de lujo como se puede suponer. El trato es muy servicial y muy agradable.  Nada más entrar un pequeño cóctel. Las habitaciones son impecables y los artículos de baño son muy correctos. La terraza superior también es bastante espectacular...
En cuanto a la comida del Resturante Moments.... qué decir de Ruscalleda!!! Mi novia dice que es el mejor restaurante que ha probad, quizá es un poco exagerado pero tampoco se queda lejos.
El desayuno... increíble!!! Puedes hacer un desayuno y no comer más en todo el día!!!
Es decir, si tienes pasta o quieres una velada especial (hay packs con promociones...), recomendable!!!",4,2014,07,29
44,Ubicación y lujo,"Ubicación perfecta, lujo sobrio y atención impecable, las características que todo mandarin Oriental debe tener y este no es la excepción. Una de los lugares que mas nos gusto fue la terraza del hotel con su piscina, una vista invaluable. No veo la hora de volver",5,2014,07,27
44,NIE WIEDER!!!!!!,"Es ist eine Unverschämtheit was einem im Mandarin in Barcelona geboten wird.

Blick auf den Garten bedeutet Baustelle und auf einen Schulhof mit schreienden Kindern u. Jugendlichen!
Die Zimmer sind sehr klein, mit kaputten Möbeln, dreckigen Teppichböden und schmutzigen Betten, flecken die durch das Bettlacken zu sehen waren und überall Haare. „EKELHAFT“
Das Hotelpersonal bis hin zur Direktion arrogant u. unverschämt !!!!!",1,2014,07,17
44,Teurer Aufenthalt mit gutem Service,"Das Mandarin Oriental bietet einen sehr guten Service. Gemessen am Preis fand ich das Hotel von der Ausstattung ein wenig enttäuschend, da die Lobby nicht sehr großzügig war und es zu Schlangenbildung an der Reception kam. Der großzügige Frühstücksraum befindet sich leider im Souterrain wird aber durch eine große Glaskuppel lichtgeflutet.
Wir haben uns den Spabereich nur zeigen lassen, ich fand den Chlorgeruch eher unangenehm es gibt auch nur einen kleinen Pool und ein Dampfbad. Achtung, das Bild mit der chilligen Dachterrasse, das auf der Internetseite gezeigt wird ist ein Fake und entspricht nicht der Realität. Die Dachterrasse ist zwar vorhanden, aber komplett anders gestaltet.
An zwei von 4 Tagen, stand die gemütliche Bar, mit den sehr guten Cocktails, wegen eines privaten Events stundenweise nicht zur Verfügung!
Das Frühstück entspricht dem was man von einem 5 Sterne Hotel erwarten darf. Der Service war nicht zu beanstanden, die Lage ist hervorragend, aber auch entsprechend laut, wenn man, wie wir, zur Passeig de Gracia heraus schläft.
Unmöglich fanden wir die Tatsache, dass für Wifi auf dem Zimmer Geld berechnet wird, 1 Stunde 8€, das sollte bei den Zimmerpreisen drin sein!",4,2014,06,03
44,Lujo en un hotel urbanita,"Estuvimos en este hotel tomando un café y los niños un postre. Impresionante el espacio, la decoración....un hotel de quitar el hipo. El servicio normalito, tampoco fue extraordinario por lo que pagamos por dos cafés y dos postres. Un mundo de lujo en pleno Passeig de Gràcia, hace gracia por los botones o ""piccolos"" típicos que están afuera esperando a que algúna celebrity se apee de una limousine...un hotel privativo que hasta para tomar un café se te va el presupuesto de la comida de la família de un día. un capricho. No me alojaría en él. Demasiado. Excesivo. No hace falta tanto, para mí.",3,2014,05,29
44,"Sin duda, el mejor hotel de BCN!","Ya no solo por su olor a vainilla al entrar…ni por sus gintonics..ni por sus espectaculares habitaciones...ni por el restaurante moments….ni por el piano de cola blanco que suena sin cesar....ni por su jardín/bar interior donde puedes hacer que se pare el tiempo y olvidarte de que estas en pleno paseo de gracia…

Mandarin Oriental está por encima de cualquier detalle minúsculo, trabaja en la esencia de lo abstracto y lo ""eyacula"" en la fragancia de lo concreto.

Obligatorio: Siéntate en el patio interior y tomate lo que te apetezca. Vas a olvidar lo que es el ruido.",5,2014,05,22
44,Albergo straordinario,"Sono stata al  Mandarin per Pasqua, con i miei figli. E' stata una bellissima esperienza. Albergo curatissimo nei dettagli, molto raffinato ed elegante ma al tempo stesso essenziale. Ottima la colazione. Strepitoso il ristorante "" Moments""  (lo chef ha due stelle Michelin davvero meritate) dove abbiamo sperimentato il menù' degustazione. Insomma un albergo straordinario dove spero di avere occasione di tornare!!!",5,2014,04,29
44,hotel fantastico,"appena si entra già i profumi sono inebrianti (provare per credere).
lo staff è sorridente ovunque, la camera (matrimoniale) è grande e confortevole.
i materassi ed i cuscini morbidi il giusto, per una qualità del sonno superiore.
La piscina sul tetto è impressionante.
In più: ho pagato la metà di quello che pagherei negli altri mandarin di Parigi e New York.",5,2014,04,23
44,La especulación turística y mala gestión del hotel Mandarin de Barcelona,"La especulación turística y mala gestión del hotel Mandarin de Barcelona

Hace escasos días estuvimos en el hotel Mandarin de Las Vegas  ( Nevada ) y del cual   mi esposa y yo quedamos realmente impresionados del mismo.

Por ello decidimos que celebraríamos mi cincuenta aniversario en el hotel Mandarin de Barcelona. Visitamos el hotel y la persona de recepción nos atendió muy correctamente y después de enseñarnos las instalaciones que para mi criterio son fabulosas, nos hizo un presupuesto por escrito del coste de un tipo de  habitación en concreto con vistas al patio de las mimosas con terraza y bañera con los complementos que incluía dicha habitación, y con la fecha en concreto.

Al día siguiente llamamos para hacer la reserva especificando lo que nos habían explicado el día anterior, y nuestra sorpresa fue mayúscula ya que  nos estaban aumentando el precio por el mismo producto y aparte intentaban que nos conformáramos con una habitación de diferentes características (inferior), 

El motivo : (debido a la alta demanda para las fechas y la poca disponibilidad que tenemos para esa época.)

Después de enviarnos diferentes mails con la dirección del hotel al final  nos respetaron el precio que el personal del hotel nos había facilitado por escrito pero no nos quisieron asegurar el tipo de habitación que figuraba en el presupuesto aun faltando mas de cuatro meses para dicha fecha.

Como última opción intentaron que reserváramos una habitación superior “mas cara” para garantizar en la que estábamos interesados.:
(Si realmente quieren garantizar la bañera y terraza y una habitación mas amplia, estaré encantada de informarles sobre la tarifa Mandarin room.) 

Como catalán estoy contento del éxito del turismo en Barcelona pero veo injusto que cadenas de prestigio como el Mandarin Oriental de Barcelona quieran especular hasta el último momento principalmente en verano para sacar mas dinero de habitaciones en concreto. Y aprovecharse de celebraciones personales importantes para incrementar el precio.

En el Foro del hotel hay múltiples comentarios negativos sobre clientes que se han sentido engañados a última hora con habitaciones muy pequeñas que no concuerdan con el precio que pagan.
Un hotel tan bien ubicado de  prestigio y tan espectacular es triste que tenga tan mala gestión en la dirección, en una ciudad  tan cosmopolita como es en este momento Barcelona.

Todo lo dicho hay constancia en diferentes mails enviados y recibidos y concuerda totalmente con la realidad. Digo lo mismo porqué el director del hotel Mandarin de Barcelona suele  contestar los mensajes negativos del foro intentando suavizar las quejas, pero en mi caso no hay nada a suavizar. Es solo una mala imagen y mala gestión de los directivos",1,2014,03,24
44,Que falla en este hotel ? La falta de amabilidad del personal,"Sorprendente si que un hotel mandarín que he podido frecuentar en Asia y Miami tengan a un personal tan pueblerino o altanero cuando no tienen nada para motivarlo. Los clientes siguen siendo los que pagan y finalmente te llevas tan mal recuerdo del personal que cualquier sitio bonito no compensa su gente. No volveré y esperó que los turistas no se dejen llevar sólo por la marca mandarín sí Barcelona no es digno de representar su marca . Probablemente sea un tema de management y algún día se arreglará pero hasta entonces preferiré el servicio cálido y entrañable del reciente te renovado hotel majestic, un icono en la ciudad",2,2014,02,01
44,Es un gran Hotel...,"Las últimas dos veces que he visitado BCN he tenido la suerte de conseguir alojamiento en el Mandarin Oriental del Paseo de Gracia, es una cadena increíble que se ocupa como la mejor de hacerte sentir bien tratado, es muy particular porque está asentado en la antigua edificación de un banco internacional... En su bar aún están en las paredes las antiguas cajas de seguridad...
La atención es excelente se esas que te dejan siempre con ganas de volver...
Ni hablar de su excelente ubicación, y de su restaurante que cuenta con un alguna estrella Michelin.... No dejen de visitar el SPA, son famosos los Spa's de la cadena Mandarin.
Lo recomiendo sí reservas porque vale cada euro que pagas por estar allí ...",5,2014,01,22

Aunque parezca una pijada es muy agradable entrar en estos hoteles de la ciuudad donde vives, ya que no te alojarás en ellos y de esta forma los visitas.
Este en concreto me pareció muy recomendable, un servicio esmerado y muy tranquilo, ideal para pasar un buen rato charlando en buena compañia.
Excelente.",5,2013,12,28

Muy limpio y su amenidades del baño con rico aroma. En el closet hay un mat para practicar yoga, se agradece!!!
El salón Blanc donde sirven desayuno muy completo y donde también tomé un té en la tarde y que tiene un mesón para disfrutar mini baguetes con jamón y tomate o de jamón y queso estaban muy buenos, gran variedad de té presentados en lindas cajas y variedad de pasteles, destaco la buena atención del personal del Blanc.",4,2013,12,22
44,Non solo hotel ma ideale anche per aperitivi e cene,"L'hotel Mandarin Oriental di Barcellona mette a disposizione nei periodi estivi una bellissima terrazza panoramica aperta anche ai non clienti dell'albergo. Una location molto elegante dove potersi godere il tramonto assaggiando un buon cava e rilassarsi in un'atmosfera internazionale e cool. Durante l'autunno-inverno invece si può sfruttare la bellissima location interna chiamata Banker's anch'essa molto raffinata arredata con lo stile unico ed inimitabile del Mandarin Oriental. Il servizio è veramente ottimo, una cortesia che non si trova spesso ahimè in tutti i locali. Il responsabile del Banker's, un italiano di nome Giuseppe, è molto professionale e specializzato nei cocktails. I fumatori non si disperino, il Banker's dispone una piccola terrazzina laterale dove poter fumare seduti in comode poltrone in vimini.",5,2013,11,04

44,Pésimo servicio,"El hotel sin duda es bello pues es un Mandarín , pero la atención de personal es de muy mala calidad , me toco una habitación muy pequeña y no me solucionaron el problema su respuesta fue indiferente , grosera y altanera no ofrecieron solución alguna .
Llegando al hotel decidí cenar y me encontré con una mesera que de manera fría y retadora me indico tiene reservación y el Restaurant vacío le respondí soy huésped y me fui a sentar y me atendieron la siguiente mañana lo mismo en el desayuno el mesero me dijo tiene reservación y le conteste soy huésped y me senté , esto es una manera grosera de tratar a alguien deberían acercarse y pedir de manera atenta el número del cuarto y si la persona no tiene entonces pedir la reserva , me queje de la habitación y del servicio en el comedor y no hubo respuesta solo me contestaron que así son los hoteles Europeos , estuve a punto de cancelar mi próxima instancia en el mandarín de París , hablé al hotel de París y le dije que no quería una habitación chica y del trato recibido en Barcelona y me solucionaron todo me dieron asenso pague una pequeña diferencia me explicaron como me convenía más hacer mi reserva para tener un mejor asenso y el trato fue maravilloso en París , es increíble que en una cadena de hoteles luxury se diferencien tanto de una ciudad a otra definitiva miente el Mandarín de Barcelona tiene una pésima atención de su personal de recepción y meseros , no volvería a este Mandarín ,la próxima me quedo en el Arts . Pero si va a París el Mandarín es la mejor opción personal  atentó educado y dispuesto a atenderte y servirte no como en este de Barcelona que no hicieron el mínimo Esfuerzo",3,2013,09,09
44,"Lujo discreto, Los detalles Marcan la diferencia","Un hotel exquisito en el mas amplio sentido de la expresion. Ubicacion inmejorable y detalles que hacen de la experiencia Algo inolvidable.

44,"""Diseño y Calidad pero sobre todo un Servicio Excepcional""","Es la primera vez que me alojo en un hotel de la cadena Mandarin Oriental y tenía curiosidad por probar. Mi experiencia ha sido muy positiva y siempre que pueda repetiré en otras ciudades donde haya hoteles MO.
Situado en pleno centro de Barcelona, la fachada no hace honor al interior, luminoso, moderno y con un diseño muy cuidado  con toques orientales. Se entra por una rampa que le da solemnidad y originalidad a la llegada. Hay que destacar el SPA y la piscina climatizada bonita y gozosa.
La habitación, excelente en cuanto a diseño, mobiliario, calidad de la cama, el único pero su tamaño ajustado. el cuarto de baño con plato de ducha y sanitario separados cuenta con una  bañera espectacular y redonda.
Con todo, si hay algo verdaderamente excepcional y que diferencia a este hotel de los demás hoteles cinco estrellas gran lujo es el SERVICIO. Personal altamente cualificado, atento y amable siempre pendiente y dispuesto y disponible. además se nota un excelente ambiente de trabajo entre ellos y compañerismo y esto acaba notándose en  la relación con el cliente. Es un autentico logro a destacar y copiar de la cadena Mandarin Oriental.",5,2013,07,19
44,"Sorprendente hotel, decepción habitación","Es un hotel muy céntrico, en pleno Paseo de Gracia, con unas instalaciones maravillosas. La entrada al Lobby es excepcional, así como el ambiente que se respira una vez dentro. 
El servicio es de primera, tanto en el check in como en conserjería. Que amabilidad y eficiencia !! 
A considerar que te proporcionan una clave diferente cada hora para el wi-fi gratuito. 
Excelente calidad gastronómica, tanto en el desayuno , como en la cena del restaurante Moments. 
La única pega de este hotel son las habitaciones, que sin estar mal, no están tan acordes a la grandiosidad del hotel. Encima, como solo estuvimos una noche, con la excusa de un up grade , nos pasaron a una terraza Deluxe con vistas muy feas al patio interior, a pesar de que teníamos reserva para habitación Deluxe Boulevard mas pequeña, pero con vistas al Paseo Gracia.",5,2013,07,05
44,Innenstadtoase,"Zimmer mit Balkon nach hinten zum Hof, eine perfekte Klimaanlage, da kann man bald besser schlafen als zu Hause.

44,Un sitio exquisito,"Viendolo desde fuera no parece tan bonito quiza por eso todavia sorprende mas.
Una pasarelavte conduce al interior y te transporta al maximo lujo.
Este edificio haba sido un banco, en la pared de acceso a la cocteleria

La reverencia que te hacen al servirte la copa es ponerse casi de rodillas un poco innecesario a mi parecer.
El hotel es precioso",5,2013,07,01
44,La cadena hotelera es símbolo de calidad,"Tras una mala experiencia en S'Agaro, fui a parar a este magnifico y céntrico hotel asiático que me compensó con creces.

44,Nulla di meglio!,"E' difficile esprimere una recensione quando il soggiorno in un albergo come questo si trasforma in un sogno. 
Sono stato per tre notti in un lungo week-end di metà marzo, e devo dire che farò fatica a dimenticare queste giornate. La magia di Barcellona passa quasi in secondo piano quando varchi l'ingresso del Mandarin Oriental. Personale sorridente ovunque, come a volerti accompagnare e coccolare in ogni tua mossa. La dimestichezza con l'inglese rende piacevole il dialogo con ogni collaboratore dell'hotel, che si sforza comunque di parlare anche in italiano quando riesce.
Credo che la cortesia e la disponibilità del personale possa cambiare radicalmente le qualità di un albergo, ma il Mandarin non è solo professionalità. La struttura è di una bellezza sconcertante, sia dentro che fuori, e le camere sono meravigliose. Punto di forza il bagno di un bianco luccicante e di una spaziosità degna di menzione, con una doccia enorme che confina con una meravigliosa vasca a bacinella Lo stile è classico ma molto moderno, ed appaga sia l'occhio che ogni necessità. 
Questo è il primo albergo in vita mia che mi fa venire voglia di stazionare al suo interno invece che uscire a passeggio.
A parole non si può descrivere tutto il resto. Posso solo consigliare questo posto a chi è interessato a ricevere un trattamento principesco....ovviamente spendendo qualcosa in più.",5,2013,03,18
44,"Excelente ubicacion y servicio, habitaciones algo justas","Excelente hotel, en el corazon de Barcelona y con un trato por parte de su abundante personal a la altura de la fama que le precede. Una eleccion perfecta y, seguramente una estancia mas que confortable. Sin embargo la habitacion que ocupe, en la segunda planta con vistas al Paseo de Gracia, me parecio bastante normal, mas bien de dimensiones reducidas, estrecha y alargada, lo que no la hacia muy acogedora. al margen de este tema, la cama comoda, excelente, el baño moderno, de diseño con una ducha muy agradable con chorro cenital, pero sin bañera. El minibar tambien excelentemente surtido. El servicio fue lo mejor, tuve un problema con la conexion de internet y lo solucionaron rapidamente. Todo el personal muy amable. Hay hoteles mucho mejores en Barcelona.",4,2013,02,25

Das Hotel ist zwar fast neu (aufgebaut), aber es bietet ausser der Lage am Passeig de Gracia nicht wirklich viel Zusatznutzen. Und, es ist sehr, sehr teuer. Zwar ist das Personal hervorragend geschult und die Atmosphäre im Haus sher angenehm. Aber so besonders wie einige Hoteltester sehen empfand ich dies nicht. Hervorragend für ein spanisches Hotel war hingegen die Leistung des Restaurants.",3,2013,02,06

44,Espléndido hotel en pleno Paseo de Gracia,"Me alojé durante dos noches en el hotel Mandarin Oriental de Barcelona, reservando un paquete bastante económico que incluía habitación, desayuno y spa.

El hotel está decorado con motivos orientales, aunque hay muchos puntos del establecimiento en que la decoración cambia completamente.

Cuando ves el edificio exterior no te sorprende, pues es un edificio más del Paseo de Gracia pero no destaca mucho. Pero lo que si destaca es su impresionante entrada, donde un botones te estará esperando para darte la bienvenida e ir a la recepción mediante un camino compuesto por una alfombra roja. 
El hall es pequeño pero muy lujoso, y en la recepción el personal te atiende siempre con una sonrisa y con la profesionalidad de un cinco estrellas gran lujo.

El hotel en si es todo minimalista, y lo considero uno de los hoteles más lujosos de Barcelona. Es difícil compararlo con otros grandes hoteles de la capital como el Arts, el Casa Fuster, el Majestic o el Palace, pues todos son diferentes y únicos, pero yo creo que este es el más especial de los cinco, ya que combina la elegancia y la modernidad con la espléndida decoración asiática.

Nosotros reservamos la habitación más sencilla, que tenía el nombre de ""Habitación de lujo"" o ""Habitación Deluxe"".
Simplemente una pasada. Decoración muy moderna, limpieza espectacular, cama cómoda y vistas estupendas. Además tenía todos los servicios que podías imaginar, desde unos lujosos productos de baño de la selecta marca Red Flower hasta la última tecnología en audio y televisión dentro de la habitación.
La habitación es impresionante, sin duda barata en comparación.

Después destacar el espléndido Spa del hotel, muy tranquilo. Allí dudas en que te encuentres en pleno Paseo de Gracia, pues te encuentras completamente relajado y tranquilo y en realidad te encuentras en un edificio situado en una de las calles más concurridas y visitadas de la ciudad condal.
Tiene la gran ventaja de que abre todos los días, de lunes a domingo. En muchos hoteles los domingos y/o los sábados cierran el Spa.
Es un Spa muy completo y cuenta con una piscina climatizada, un jacuzzi, un baño turco y un gimnasio. Todo de decoración minimalista y con el lujo a todas partes.

El hotel cuenta también con una piscina exterior en la planta alta del edificio, y ofrece unas maravillosas vistas aéreas sobre la ciudad.

Y por último destacar la increíble restauración del Mandarin:
Cuenta con un bar, una brasería y dos restaurantes, pero quiere detallar cada uno de ellos:
- Restaurante Mimosa Jardín: Es el sitio de restauración asiático, pues puedes encontrar muchos productos típicos de Asia, además de algunos aspectos decorativos. Se encuentra situado en el patio interior del hotel. También puedes tomar algo cuando te apatezca.
- Bar Mandarin Banker (creo que se llamaba así): Para mi el sitio con más clase del hotel. Tuvimos la suerte de alojarnos un miércoles y poder disfrutar de la magnífica actuación de jazz mientras bebíamos un delicioso cóctel. Los camareros son muy profesionales y hacen los cócteles con mucho lujo y mucha dedicación. 
- Bar-Restaurante Blanc: Solamente fui a desayunar, así que no puedo opinar de su gastronomía a la hora de las comidas y cenas. Creo recordar que se podía merendar o tomar algo por la tarde, pero no estoy seguro. Los desayunos se hacen en este restaurante-brasería: son muy elaborados y tienen mucha variedad de alimentos, todos de altísima calidad.
- Restaurante Moments: Uno de los mejores restaurantes de Barcelona, no cabe duda. Aunque el precio es muy elevado, la gastronomía es de altísimo nivel. Muy recomendable comer en el Moments, pues es un restaurante galardonado con 1 estrella Michelin y de la famosa chef Carme Ruscalleda. En mi opinión debería de tener dos estrellas Michelin, ya que he ido a muchos restaurantes de una y dos estrellas michelin y yo creo que éste tendría que ser de dos. Es mejor que otros restaurantes de Barcelona de dos estrellas Michelin como el Lasarte o el Àbac (en mi opinión, claro está).

En definitiva, un hotel al que estoy seguro que volveré y recomendaré.
Felicitar a todo el personal por su gran labor, sois todos unos profesionales y hacéis que el cliente se encuentre muy satisfecho.",5,2012,09,27
44,El mejor hotel de Barcelona,"El Mandarin Oriental es hoy dia el mejor Hotel de Barcelona. No hay mucho que añadir a los anteriores comentarios, fantástico personal (los mejores ex empleados del Arts - Ritz Carlton se cambiaron aquí), habituaciones de lujo pero sin empalagar, con su punto de casualidad. ubicación inmejorable, desayuno increíble. si es caro, pero desde cuando entras hasta que sales todo tu dinero sale muy bien invertido.",5,2012,09,09

Ho alloggiato li appena aperto 2 anni fa o 3, solo quando entri un profumo buonissimo ti colpisce, il personale è molto cordiale e disponibile, camere bellissime, la cosa più nella è la doccia, grossa e bella, le piscine sono stupende, sia quella sul tetto che quella sotto, la SPA é mozzafiato!",5,2012,08,20
44,Perfecta ubicación. Se notan las cinco estrella GL en todo momento.,"Es el más nuevo de los 5 estrellas Gran Lujo de Barcelona. Habitaciones amplias y muy bien equipadas. Restaurantes gastronícos de primerísimo nivel. Jardin interior para tomar una copa sensacional.
Las dos tiendas que flanquean la entrada ya dan idea de donde estamos. A un lado la sastreria Brioni y al otro la joyería Tiffanys.",5,2012,08,03
44,Uno de los mejores de Barcelona,"Que decir de este hotel que ya no sabemos? Patricia Urquiola realmente es una de mis predilectas!
La decoración es simplemente fantástica, las habitaciones tienen una buena insonorización, el restaurante muy bueno, tanto en carta como en precio (no hay que olvidarse que es un 5*), el espacio del lo in es uno de los mejores que ya aya visto en mi vida.
Por poner una pega la pondría a la terraza (los sillones son una pasada de bonitos) que sonaba Lady Gaga ( aun que creo que la música venia de otra parte)
Recomiendo 100%",5,2012,06,25
44,"Lujo, ubicación y servicio excepcional","Si lo que quieres es sentirte en el paraíso dentro de una ciudad, este es junto con el Arts uno de los mejores...",5,2012,04,28
44,El mejor hotel de Barcelona,"Hemos viajado bastante, y podemos decir que el Mandarín Oriental es el mejor hotel en que nos hemos alojado. Calificado cómo otros de hotel de lujo, es el único que lo cumple en todas su facetas. Estéticamente  impresionante, con un estilo asiático moderno. El servicio extremadamente amable y atento. Las habitaciones espaciosas, con grandes y comfortables camas, y ambiente relajante. 
Para desayunar hay una gran cantidad de opciones, tanto de dulce como de salado. El restaurante Blanco, dónde se sirve, además es precioso: en tonos blancos y con luz natural que entra de una bóveda en el techo.
La ubicación es céntrica, en pleno Paseo de Gracia, muy cerca de Plaza Cataluña y también de las Ramblas. 
Si vais a Barcelona, y podéis permitiroslo, no dudeis en quedaros en este hotel. Sólo por lo bien que huele, ya vale la pena.",5,2012,04,01
44,Super Service und Location,Das Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona ist eines der absoluten top addressen aus meiner Sicht. Die Zimmer waren sehr modern ausgestattet und man fuehlt sich wie in einer wohlfuehl oase sobald man ins Zimmer geht. Der Service war excellent und beim Check-in wurde man sofort persoenlich begruesst und angesprochen. Die location ist auch super. alles ist in der naehe und von Fuss aus zu erreichen. Wuerde auf jedenfall wieder in das Hotel gehen.,5,2012,02,27
44,"vale la pena,","es muy excepcional, un lujo asiatico inigualable, el mejor hotel de la ciudad, para ir en pareja y cenar en el resturante",5,2012,02,07
44,Imperdonable no probarlo,"debe ser de los mejores hoteles que podemos encontrar en todo el mundo, no se puede pedir mas. Tienen de todo pero si quieres mas, lo pides y te lo traen. 
El que se lo pueda permitir y no lo prueba se perderá unas experiencias verdaderamente importantes, porque saben satisfacer espectativas como nadie.",5,2012,02,06
44,muy bien,"Estube en este hotel el verano para ver a la familia, por su situacion todo genial, el trato y la limpieza, volveria!!",4,2011,11,29
44,"LA PERA, NOS ENCANTÓ","Creo que volveria sobre todo por su ubicacion, la mejor, aunque tambien por sus camas ""heavenly beds"" no cabe duda que son maravillosas, no habia dormido tan bien hacia tiempo. El hotel en si es espectacular, la entrada, la recepcion, los restaurantes, todo. Nos hicieron un upgrade a Junior Suite, nos encanto la habitacion, muy silenciosa pese a estar en pleno centro de Barcelona, con una bañera enorme y todas la amenities de La Prairie, todo un detalle. El desayuno en el restaurante Blanc era fantastico, aparte de la comida que era muy buena,el sitio era muy espectacular lleno de plantas y todo el mobiliario en color blanco  y el personal muy amable. No dejes de visitar su Bankers Bar, un antiguo banco lleno de cajas de seguridad transformado en bar, muy animado.",4,2011,11,17
44,"Top Lage, ausgezeichnetes Hotel, aber sehr teuer","Einmaliges Design, modern und doch sehr angenehme Wohlfühlatmosphäre. Geräumige Zimmer, sehr guter Service. Top Lage im Zentrum. Wer's gerne ruhig mag, kann ein Zimmer zum ruhigen Innenhof mit Garten buchen. Die Zimmer zum Paseo de Gracia bieten dafür eine schöne Aussicht über die Stadt. ACHTUNG: der ""Pool"" auf der Dachterrasse verdient mit 40cm Wassertiefe wohl eher den Namen ""Fussbad"".
Wifi gegen Gebühr (es ist zwar in vielen Hotels so, aber ich finde es trotzdem unverschämt, bei 370€/ Nacht noch exorbitante Gebühren zu verlangen)",4,2011,11,02
44,Beste Adresse,"Besser kann man nicht wohnen, mitten im Zentrum, stylische Einrichtung, excellente Küche unter anderem serviert im ruhigen Innenhofrestaurant. Alles so, wie man sich ein 5 Sterne Resort in Barcelona vorstellt. Die Zimmer sind groß und, soferne in den Innenhof gerichtet, auch sehr ruhig. Man kann bei offenem Fenster schlafen. Gym ist ok, aber kein Highlight, weil ohne Tageslicht. Das ""Pool"" am Dach ist nur 40cm tief und eignet sich nur für Fußbäder. Sonst aber ein absoluter Volltreffer.",5,2011,05,13
44,Altamente Recomendable!,Es el tipo de Hotel donde vas se buscas lo mejor! Todos los detalles desde decoracion al servicio te hacen sentir especial! Al final es lo que esperas de un MO!,5,2010,12,16
44,Tanto para tan poco? Una gran decepcion...,"Mandarin Oriental siempre tiene criterios de servicio excepcionales, en este caso los han debido olvidar.
Salvo el restaurate, donde la calidad es exquisita, el resto del hotel no merece la pena.
Un diseño tan innnovador que convierte el recinto en un lugar frio y sin alma. Un servicio gélido y muy poco disponible.
Unas habitaciones muy mal insonorizadas, imposible dormir hasta después de las 9. El ruido hace insoportable el descanso.
No merece el titulo de 5* Gran lujo, si van a Barcelona, hay mejores opciones.",3,2010,11,25
44,"Kleines MO, aber absolut traumhaft","Die Zimmer sind relativ groß mit knapp 30m². Ansonsten gefiel mir die Mischung aus spanischen Details, modernem Design und klassischen Einrichtungsgegenständen. Alles hochwertig, aber nicht protzig. Empfehlenswert sind die kleinen Mandarin Suites, das Preis/Leistungsverhältnis stimmt hier am ehesten. Allerdings ist das Preisniveau bei MO generell sehr hoch. Insgesamt aber noch vertretbar. Lage exzellent, nähe Plaza Catalunya. Service mehrsprachig und zuvorkommend. Besonders empfehlenswert für Honeymooners.",5,2010,11,09
44,Kurzurlaub,"Wunderschönes Hotel. Moderne, grosszügige Zimmer (Junior Suite) mit sehr schöner Möblierung. Super Service und freundliches Personal.  Ausgezeichnetes Restaurant und schöne Gartenterasse. Sehr gute Lage fünf Minuten von der Placa de Catalunja. Einzig negatives: das  vom Concierge empfohlene Restaurant enstprach nicht den Erwartungen.",5,2010,08,02
44,"Fantastische Lage, bester Service, eine Perle in Barcelona","Endlich wurde es eröffnet, das vierte Mandarin Oriental in Europa. Gegenüber der Casa Batlo, nördlich des Plaza de Catalunya. Fantastische Architektur kunstvoll in die alten Grundmauern integriert. Knapp einhundert modernst eingerichtete Zimmer,
Bad mit runder Riesenwanne und Regenwalddusche. Unbedingt Zimmer zum Garten buchen, der Passeig de Gràcia ist stark befahren und laut. Dunkelgrünes Schwimmbad in einem der unteren Stockwerke, 25 qm Hammam. Restaurant le Blanc bietet u.a. interessante asiatische Spezialitäten. Service der seines Gleichen sucht, Zimmerpreise
( 379 Euro / Nacht mit Frühstück ) bereits kurz nach der Eröffnung recht deftig !",5,2010,06,29
44,Schönes Hotel im Zentrum,"Schönes Hotel direkt im Zentrum in der Nähe der U-Bahn
Tolles Frühstücksbuffet mit verschiedensten frischen Obstsorten und Fisch.
Leider keine finnische Sauna vorhanden, Dampfsauna ist verfügbar
An der Rezeption war immer wenn wir dort waren auch eine deutschsprechende Person verfügbar.
Tip: Hotel war über einen Reiseveranstalter preiswerter als direkt buchbar. Gleiches galt für das Frühstück.",5,2010,06,08
44,Fantástico oasis en Bacelona,"El nuevo hotel MO de Bcn me gustó. Es todo un hotel urbano con todas las comodidades y lujos que corresponden a hoteles de esa categoría y precio. La ubicación es perfecta, en pleno corazón de Barcelona. El personal es muy muy atento, están pendientes todo el rato de tus necesidades y siempre con un trato sumamente correcto. Los restaurantes son buenos, buen diseño y buena comida siempre rodeado de la gente mas ""in"" de Bcn.Las habitaciones sin ser de un tamaño generoso estan bien equipadas y con todas las comodidades necesarias. La ducha sensacional.El jardín de atrás recientemente abierto es precioso, muy estilo manzana de NY,con amplias mesas y butacas muy cómodas que invitan a una copa en primavera y a las noches de verano. Pienso que de dia va a ser un horno en pleno verano. El hotel dispone también de una piscina en el ático maravilosa desde donde poder disfrutar de una vista expléndida de todo Barcelona. Es muy poco profunda y en realidad mas que piscina es para refrescarse. A mi juicio, le falta a esa terraza unas mesas y un pequeño bar snack con música donde poder tomar una bebida.En resumen, se trata de hoy por hoy, una de las mejores ofertas hoteleras de Bcn para gente sibarita. 
Lo peor: La ensalada César del room service",5,2010,04,25
44,Champagner-coole Eleganz mit warmherziger Gastfreundschaft!,"Ultra modernes und elegantes Hotel; sehr gute zentrale Lage; elegant eingerichtete Zimmer - sehr ruhig, trotz der verkehrsreichen Avenue vor dem Hotel.
Hervorragender Service (Butler!). Ausgezeichnetes Restaurant ""MOments"" - Küche
und Service absolut exzellent - Restaurant alleine schon eine Reise wert! - Spa
klein, aber fein!",5,2010,02,23
44,El mejor hotel de Barcelona y por fin un MO en España,"He estado tres noches con mi mujer en el MO Barcelona. Es un hotelazo, al más puro estilo de la cadena. Conocemos otros hoteles Mandarion Oriental, en Ginebra, Bangkok y NYC y este está al nivel.
Conocemos el Hotel Arts, y salvo por la ubicación de cara al verano, el MO Barcelona, es más moderno, con mejor diseño y con personal mas amable.
Lo recomendamos sin duda.
Es cierto que todavía hay detalles que deben pulir, típicos de hotel nuevo, pero es un hotel que se puede recomendar con la garatía de que gustará.",5,2010,01,09
