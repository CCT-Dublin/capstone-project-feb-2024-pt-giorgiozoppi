203,Great afternoon tea,"My Mom and I went for afternoon tea at the Westbury. It was easy to book it online, and see same-day availability. The hotel is located right off of the main shopping street. The setting was beautiful, the staff attentive, and the food delicious.",5,2024,10,14
203,Look no further than The Westbury Hotel!,"Truly Spectacular location, service, food and room!

If your considering a trip to Dublin, look no further than the The Westbury Hotel, besides the fact that it‚Äôs nestled neatly in the heart of Dublin‚Äôs bustling Grafton St, it‚Äôs an added bonus that The Westbury Hotel is a stone throw from the wondrous Brown Thomas.

Unfortunately while on the motorway from Derry to Dublin, my husband and I experienced a tyre blowout in our Defender. We arrived at the hotel shaken (me) and filthy (my husband) from changing the wheel. I‚Äôm delighted to say, upon arrival at the hotel things quickly changed. The valet service took our vehicle off our hands and guided us into the hotel dazzling hotel lobby. 

The the reception staff are warm welcoming as you would expect at a 5* hotel. We were allocated a newly refurbished suite on the 6th floor which surpassed all expectation. The suite was spacious and luxurious, but the jubilation didn‚Äôt end there‚Ä¶ as parents of 3 young children our plan is always room service and relax. The food was exquisite (I plan to attach photos at the end if possible). The burrata was the best I‚Äôve ever tasted, both rich and creamy, the risotto was delectable, my husbands fillet steak was, in his words ‚Äúthe most delicate piece of meat, both tender and flavourful‚Äù. We enjoyed all the trimmings on the side of what was thee most perfect meal. 

Having woke up refreshed after a wonderful nights sleep in the most comfortable and magnificent four poster bed, we availed of a room service banquet breakfast fit for a King, complimented perfectly with a late check out. 

Needless to say, my husband and I cannot wait for our next trip to The Westbury Hotel. Thank you to all the wonderful staff that made our stay very special in particular Jack and Sarah from guest services. It was an unrivalled weekend.",5,2023,08,06
203,Excellent Service,"Best place in Dublin Excellent service, super attentive and polite staff, especially the waiter √Ålvaro who took special care to explain everything to us in Spanish since I don't speak English. I will definitely come back again and recommend the place! I had afternoon tea with my mom  at the gallery",5,2024,10,13
203,Absolutelu Terrible experience,"11 at night jet lagged, exhausted and they have a bamd playing in the hotel.  Front desk says will stop at 12:30 am.  AM!!   Hoping i paid with AmEx.  Ruined an otherwise wondereful day. Completely beyond the pale to portray this place as a 4 or 5 star hotel.  IT IS NOT.  Run do not walk to anywhere else in Dublin.",1,2024,09,28
203,We will never stay here again. The hotel is badly dated.,"I grew up in Dublin and always wanted to stay in the Westbury. 
Sadly, it‚Äôs been terrible. The hotel is incredibly dated. The room we got stank and had little to no ventilation. There was no room service after 10pm, which I‚Äôve never seen in a 5 star hotel. The staff are overly formal considering the overpriced dump that the hotel has become. The location is the only thing the hotel has going for it. We will not be coming back.",1,2024,09,23
203,The Westbury-Beautiful and Welcoming!,"The Westbury is a beautiful hotel conveniently located.  It is an oasis in the middle of shops, restaurants and pubs.  The room was lovely and the staff extremely friendly and welcoming.  
From The Westbury, we were able to walk to multiple historic sites and parks, including St. Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral, Trinity College and Dublin Castle.",5,2024,09,22
203,Disappointing and unsettling. Do better.,"It pains me to write this review. I was booked at the Westbury for one night before heading to Galway to present a paper at an international legal conference. Unfortunately, my bags had been left in Perth, Western Australia en route to London because damage to the tarmac necessitated less weight in the aircraft. 

Anyway, I was very anxious to get my bags back and enquired with the university as to whether it would be better to stay in Dublin another night to ensure I got the bag quickly rather than it having to be transported to the West Coast of Ireland. They agreed and went about getting approval for booking another night at the Westbury. 

The quote for the extra night was eyewatering (the rooms are quite nice but really‚Ä¶?)  and I thought it was ridiculous. I said not to bother, and I would just head straight to Galway after the night in Dublin. 

I received notification the next morning that, unfortunately, the confirmation for the extra night had gone through overnight and to check with the desk about whether the booking has been confirmed or not. I should mention at this point that once made the booking was nonrefundable. 

I phoned the front desk from my room immediately and was told the booking had been confirmed overnight and that the room was booked for another night. My hotel in Galway was then notified that I would not arrive until the next day. 

I had a nice extra day in Dublin until mid afternoon when everything went pear shaped. I returned to the hotel and discovered I was locked out of my room. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time as these things happen. The front desk was busy, so I just took myself into a quiet area to have a cup of tea. I then received a call from one of the managers asking to speak to me in person. I thought it was a little strange, but I said I was in the hotel and would come across to reception to meet him. 

Anyway, in so many words I was accused of trying to overstay. I was terribly upset. He said that the booking had been cancelled overnight (the university had tried to cancel it, but it had already been confirmed as I was informed in my conversation with the desk earlier in the day) He said it had actually been cancelled. I showed him all the emails particularly the email regarding the confirmation and the request to contact the desk to see if we could do anything. Unfortunately, the conversation with the desk was the only thing that wasn‚Äôt reduced to writing. I felt he was of the view I was being untruthful about this. 

The hotel had my corporate card on file, so obviously there was no issue with payment for the room. I reminded him of this. He then said they needed the room as the hotel was full. I realised then they wanted me out. 

I was clearly upset, but I said  I could leave and go to Galway that night. He went and checked the train time table. He said one left in a bit over half an hour and could I pack up for that? I said yes, as I didn‚Äôt feel I had any choice and felt completely humiliated. I was in a crowded reception area and obviously, the desk staff also knew what I was being accused of. I turned and went towards the lift and then he had to come after me and give me a key because - they had locked me out. So it wasn‚Äôt because of some random glitch that happens from time to time - they had actually made the decision to lock me out of my room. 

I packed up quickly and they called a cab to the station. I got the train to Galway. All good. The people in the Galway hotel were really understanding and I‚Äôm having a delightful stay. 

I informed the university travel department and they put in a complaint about the Westbury with APTI. We also found out at that point the Westbury had actually charged the university for the extra night despite embarrassing me into leaving because they claimed the booking had been cancelled! üò° 

I really don‚Äôt know what to say. I‚Äôve travelled all over the world throughout my career and been in and out of all sorts of accommodation without issue. This was just awful. It is supposed to be a reputable hotel and I would‚Äôve thought that customer service - and at least a modicum of respect and understanding - would be a priority. 

Seriously, what kind of a dodgy outfit embarrasses a visitor into leaving claiming the reservation had  been cancelled and the hotel is full and THEN proceeds to  charge for that extra night (after claiming there was no booking). I thought afterwards too, what would have happened if I couldn‚Äôt have found accommodation in Galway? That my hotel here was not  as understanding as it was and I could not get my room back for the night? The Westbury didn‚Äôt care. They just wanted their room back to avoid the embarrassment of being double booked. Nice one. 

My experience with the Westbury was  disappointing and, quite frankly unsettling. I  wouldn‚Äôt wish this experience on anyone. Do better.",1,2024,09,19
203,Sub-standard hotel with many flaws,"While the hotel is located in a great location, our room was sub-standard.  The phone never worked, the TV did not work at first and the room had stained carpets.  It took 3 times for the tv to be fixed and the phone was never fixed.  We complained, and everyone was very apologetic, however nothing got done.  When we left we told the front desk they ought to be embarrassed about renting a room like this at a ""5 star"" hotel.  They took our name and made sure they had our email, but in over a week not a single apology for the lack of effort.  Poor service from a hotel such as this.",3,2024,09,18
203,Olde irish charm with afternoon tea ,"My husband and I and our 3 year old daughter went for afternoon tea to celebrate my birthday. 
It was a fabulous afternoon one of which I will treasure. I have to say the staff were too notch and in particular Anthony that served us was superb so helpful and had a genuine interest in us having a great afternoon.  His tea recommendations were also great and his special treatment of our daughter was beautiful. Nothing was too much trouble and he was so happy to chat with us and advise and help us with anything we needed.  
Definitely a treat to remember.
Thanks Anthony.",5,2024,09,18
203,Diana the lady,"We got married recently and had an impromptu lunch here and it was just fabulous, the food was so tasty and the atmosphere lovely but what made it so special was the staff particularly the very lovely Diana who went above and beyond in any requests we had.  Almost three months later another impromptu visit and Diana greeted us and remembered what we drank and what food we liked !!! She also made our visit again special by having the piano player play our wedding song and a surprise cake.  The westbury is aesthetically beautiful as we all know but the real beauty in this place is how kind and warm the staff are and no stone will be left unturned in your quest for what will make your stay at the westbury so special.  Diana and staff thank you so much for what you do",5,2024,09,17
203,A perfect spot for a first visit to Dublin,"The hotel is luxurious with friendly staff. The room was well appointed and had plenty of amenities. The location is excellent and within walking distance of most attractions. On the Friday they had a free guided walking tour that was in conjunction with the Abbey Theater, it was a great option for us. Definitely recommend it as a top place to stay in Dublin.",5,2024,09,14
203,Wonderful hotel!!,We absolutely loved this hotel!  The staff were so friendly and went above and beyond for us.  We loved the location - it was within walking distance to everything we did. The rooms were clean and the breakfast was wonderful.  I will be returning for sure!,5,2024,09,12
203,Afternoon Tea,"5* I have been going to the Westbury for afternoon tea with my Grandmother for 20 years. Ofcourse the actual afternoon tea itself has changed over the years but the standard, the ambiance and the service has always remained the same. 
I was joined by a friend visiting from abroad on this occasion and we had a fantastic time.

203,The best hotel bar in Dubl√≠n,"The best bar in dublin. Excelent service I travel a lot to many hotels. This is the best hotel bar I've had in 7 countries. All the dishes are excellent. And best of all, the attention of the staff is outstanding. The best waiters. Congratulecion",5,2024,09,02

203,Truly unlimited afternoon tea,"The unlimited afternoon tea was good, good choice and what you can‚Äôt eat you can take away. Would come back to visit the other restaurants as the service was great very attentive. Good tea and non tea options for all. Would go back and do it again",5,2024,08,25

203,Beautiful afternoon in Dublin,"Excellent service, very welcoming. The food was delicious and the table was set beautifully. Teas and waters were topped up as soon as they went dry. Our waiter had an excellent attitude and was very informative when it came to explaining the food choices. We were very bold and had some cocktails afterwards. They were more than happy to recommend cocktails from their specialty menu. Would absolutely recommend a visit.",5,2024,08,23
203,Weekend in the westbury,"Anthony in the Gallery, looked after me on Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon. His professionalism and attention to detail was excellent. He used whit and charm to enhance the experience. The westbury was a lovely hotel in the centre of Dublin. Surrounded by culture and history. Who doesn‚Äôt love Dublin City on sunny Sunday afternoon!",5,2024,08,18
203,"It‚Äôs The Westbury, it doesn‚Äôt get any better!","While this hotel needs no review as it speaks for its, I just wanted to point out on just how wonderful and professional it is, I want to mention the exceptional and outstanding attention and service given to us by Elena. I believe she was in charge of staff at front desk. Maia also made it a delight to come to our room every night and even left me extra chocolates on my birthday. Beautiful hotel!",5,2024,08,10
203,Fancy Tea for 6,Had the most wonderful tea service for six people. We left very full despite my husband‚Äôs suspicions he wouldn‚Äôt be by the end of it!  Highly recommend the champagne addition!  We loved Anthony he had the best tips on tea for each of our preferences.,5,2024,08,10
203,"Antony, a 6+ star superstar!","Anthony was such a sweetheart. If I could give him more than 5 stars I would! Thanks for making our afternoon tea, and my birthday a treat! You were so lovely!

Our afternoon tea was full of savour and sweet delights. All you can eat sandwichs, teas and coffee! ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,2024,08,10
203,High Tea at the Westbury,"This was our first high tea experience and Anthony was great and a fun waiter! He was informative, pleasant, and attentive. Also, the atmosphere was wonderful so i would recommend coming here in Dublin for afternoon tea. Overall enjoyed our time!",5,2024,08,09
203,Charming hotel !,"This is a charming hotel! The welcome was very pleasant with two very friendly women; we just had to sign a paper and the room key was ours. The rooms were pleasant, spacious, and the presence of a bathtub in the bathroom was a real plus. However, the lighting system was impossible to understand: the bathroom turned on from the hallway to the bedroom, and the bedroom lights had to be turned off one by one. I even had to unplug them all because I wouldn't understand how it worked!

The hotel bar is friendly, with a subdued atmosphere. The cocktails are a little expensive, around ‚Ç¨15 on average, but the service is impeccable and very friendly. The hotel is also very well located, next to many bars and shops. A very successful experience overall!",5,2024,07,31
203,Terribly displeased,"Surprisingly the rooms were worn out.   Damaged walls, sated and dreary furnishings.   While the hotel lobby and restaurants were lovely, once inside the room  I felt like I was in a motel.    

Then came the evening when the rooms would not cool down.   A hotel staffer came to the room to show me the high versus low fan but that was already going and it didn‚Äôt cool the room.    You could hardly hear the fan blowing at all.  I can‚Äôt imagine what this room would feel like in the height of the summer.  

A sleepless night.  

Can‚Äôt wait to get out of here.",1,2024,07,27
203,Great,"Went to the westbury to watch the Galway vs Donegal all Ireland semi and also the Euros , we sat at the bar and were looked after very well by both Debbie and Norman . They were both so friendly and kind. Great service! Highly recommend! Would definitely visit again!",5,2024,07,14
203,Wonderful stay,"We came here for my husbands birthday and the hotel is wonderful. We were upgraded to a beautiful suite and received champagne and chocolate dessert in the room. The service is outstanding. We will most definitely return and cannot recommend it enough.
Location is amazing too. 
Thank you!!",5,2024,07,13
203,Location Location Location,"The service at The Westbury was excellent. We had dinner at Wilde and Balfe and enjoyed both of them. Paul at Balfe went out of his way to print a train schedule for us when we told him about our plans to visit Kildare. He went out of his way to make our trip seamless. The drinks at The Sidecar are some of the best I‚Äôve ever had. Truly something we will always remember. Our room was fine  but the carpet could use a good cleaning. The location is what really sets this hotel apart. You are close to all the shopping, restaurants, theatre and of course lots of great pubs.",5,2024,07,09
203,perfect relaxing experience,"A pleasant and relaxed stay , high quality food and hot drinks. special thank you to cara and Sarah who I did not see this Time but she was helpful on my previous stay and made me look forward to receiving great service in the next. great team, looking forward to stay again during winter season as that is when I believe is the best time to visit this hotel, the scent, food menu and warmth upon entry every year is one of the most exciting things to look forward to.",5,2024,07,08
203,5 Star Hotel in Dublin,"Wow , this was our second time staying at the Westbury Hotel. What a great experience .

203,Dublin can be heaven...,"

We were gifted a voucher for dinner, bed and¬†breakfast for the Westbury Hotel, and finally got to use the voucher recently. Smooth checkin and the bedrooms are well appointed,¬† was lovely to enjoy some tea and delicious shortbread in the bedroom on arrival. Sheehans and Nearys are good pubs, only a few steps from Westbury, and we enjoyed a pint here before dinner. Dinner was delicious,¬† great service,¬† in particular the sommelier who chose our delicious wine! What a treat to return to our room after which had been turned down! We had a good nights sleep and enjoyed a short walk around Dublins fair city before breakfast. Breakfast is cooked to order, and there is an extensive buffet of fruits, cereals, cold cuts, pastries, etc. We did not eat until late in the evening post breakfast!! Special thanks to Sarah Coleman in reservations, who was a pleasure to deal with and looked after a special request! Thank you, Sarah!! All of the team we encountered were super friendly. If I were to have one quibble, it's that the bedroom doors are not silent closing, but I guess this is a first world problem!

203,Great hotel and location,Lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin! Good breakfast and also the rooms are super comfortable and clean ! Special shout to Peter and Taynan the 2 most friendly and helpful concierges I can meet . Great guys ! Thanks for the nice hospitality to the whole hotel staff doing great job !,5,2024,06,26
203,"Top notch comfort, service, location","This is an exquisite hotel, with comfort, service, and location all to the highest degree. The amenities are all very thoughtful and rooms are comfortable and beautiful. So much helpful staff to accommodate. We have traveled widely and this was one of our favorite hotels in Europe.",5,2024,06,19
203,In the heart of the city!,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our holiday and then our last night before our early departure.  The staff at the front desk, concierge, and restaurant are super friendly and so willing to make sure that you are happy!

Our room during the beginning of our stay was a good size and very well appointed.  My only issue was the noise above us early in the am. It appears as though they're doing construction.  I used the gym during my stay. It was small but did the job! Breakfast was very nice with many good hot options. I did feel badly for a server as an American woman was annoyed that she didn't get her large bowl of berries. Note that I am American but this was so uncalled for!

Last night's stay was so short as we didn't to depart at 4am. Our guide dropped our luggage off earlier as we were headed to the Guiness tour. When we returned from dinner, our luggage was brought up to our room.  

This time we were in room 218 which was smaller than our last room. It looked on to some roofing area...definitely not eye pleasing.  But for a night, it was fine.

Love the location of the hotel.",4,2024,06,17
203,Great hotel in city center,"Stayed for 5 nights at this nicely stated hotel in the city center. Arrival and check-in experience was great - staff were welcoming, efficient and professional. Assigned room (signature suite) was of a good size and was nicely appointed; it came with a bottle of welcome champagne and small offerings of chocolates. Room was bright, temperature control was responsive, wifi signal was strong, and the bed was very comfortable. Bathroom came with many amenities, shower was  in good order but the water pressure could be better. 

Breakfast fare at the Wilde was reasonable; staff were attentive, polite and efficient. Also ate at the Bafles for dinner that provided simple but good quality (tasteful) offerings. 

Hotel is adjacent to a variety of shops, pubs and restaurants; the surrounding area is vibrant but a little too vibrant on some evenings as there was discernible music coming through to my room on the 6th floor till fairly late in the evenings.

Overall, a great, luxurious hotel that appears to be well managed. Staff throughout were excellent; they provided  friendly and efficient service. I would recommend and revisit if afforded an opportunity again.",5,2024,06,15
203,Exceptional in every way. THE top hotel IN IRELAND,"Our stay was quite exceptional in so many ways- our room, the food, the staff. The hotel is breathtaking and beautiful. I could not stop talking about the breakfast and the eggs! Dessert and after dinner drinks in the lobby were a highlight after a long day of seeing Dublin on a rainy day. Will never stay anywhere else in Dublin. Excellent location

Sarah King, a hotel experience manager, went above and beyond before and after our arrival. Thank you Sarah for your kind and welcoming gestures along the way.",5,2024,06,09
203,Wonderful,Luxury personified. From check in to departure the level of service and attention is very good  our room had a few defects and immediately it was addressed and a dinner stipend provided.  Every need is addressed promptly and professionally  No small wonder it is rightfully considered the premier hotel in Dublin.  Very close to restaurants shops and points of interest. If ever in Dublin we would return to the Westbury,5,2024,06,07
203,Simply Superb,"Simply Superb in every way. Comfortable room. Excellent staff that were always trying to make the stay a good experience. Standard of cleanliness was very high. The food in the restaurants was high quality. 
A really enjoyable experience.",5,2024,06,01
203,Cost may not Merit Stay,"The location is very nice and the public areas are nice especially the large bar area.    It is well designed and has great staffing     My only issue is that we paid a lot of money maybe 700 plus euros for a very small room with almost no storage space.

That is a lot of money for the actual room offering so the cost is not probably worth it.   We could have stayed elsewhere and enjoyed the  restaurant for less.",3,2024,06,01
203,"Great time, 5* experience","All round Excellent experience.
Modern facilities in both bedroom and bathroom. Exceptionally, comfortable bed.
All staff friendly and helpful. Internal decor full of grandeur and opulence. A five star hotel at a five star price, but worth every penny I paid.",5,2024,05,25
203,A jewel in the centre of the action,The Westbury is first class all the way. It is very well situated in the centre of the city. The Concierges were very helpful. The food was very good. The ambiance of the hotel was excellent. I would recommend the Westbury to any visitor to Dublin!,5,2024,05,18
203,Stayed for business but could do with some improvements for price point,"I have stayed here for business 3 times now. The location is fantastic and nice lounge/bar area etc. But I think the upkeep in rooms needs to be better. Every time I stay there is something not quite working/broken - tap, broken pedal bin, wardrobes slider, lights etc. I think if paying out of pocket this wouldn't be acceptable to me as high hotel rates. 

Sometimes I have found the phone operators not that helpful also like putting me through to the wrong person, having to chase up for my invoice to be emailed when was told when checked out it would be with me in 2 minutes...Even more frustrating though is they do a late turn down. Most places do in afternoon and sometimes as late as 8/8.30pm and I was already settling in for evening so very inconvenient. 

 Sorry but I certainly wouldn't pay the high prices if there for leisure and not work...",3,2024,05,14
203,Perfect in every way,"Absolutely fantastic as always. We have not stayed in any other hotel in Dublin for the last ten  years or more and we are frequently in Dublin to visit family.  The location is superb, the attention to detail excellent and the beds and duvets  are the most comfortable we have ever had . The breakfast is second to none - served hot, very, perfectly cooked and just delicious. 5****",5,2024,04,29
203,Wonderful stay at the heart of Dublin,"excellent stay from start to finish, the staff were wonderful, the room was just gorgeous and the food was delicious. We also had drinks at the in-house bar which made lovely cocktails. We stayed at the westburry for a night, just me and my husband and it was a perfect little getaway in Dublin, we will be staying there again without a shadow of a doubt.",5,2024,04,29
203,Relaxed drinks,Had a most relaxing time having drinks after dinner. Seated by a window watching the world outside going by. Special mention to Martha who looked after us so well.,5,2024,04,28
203,Dated and needs a revamp!!,"I stayed here for business and booked an executive room - on arrival I asked whether a free upgrade was possible as I was a hold customer of the hotel booking company - also the occupancy was only half full - no upgrade was given so a missed opportunity to wow a new guest! My room booked was nice and I had to work from the room so fine - bathroom was nice and bed comfortable - breakfast was mediocre to low standard - it does not compare to other European 5 star hotels and I ordered the Irish breakfast- only one piece of bacon and 1 sausage / very poor!! The hotel feels like it needs a bit of re modernisation- the hotel lift did not have a security mechanism to stop non guests reaching floors - now a standard in a lot of hotels! On check out despite a few guests at reception they were chaotic / I was promised to have my bill issued and brought to the lounge area as I was again working - 3 hours later no sign of my paid bill and I had to go back to reception
! Would I go back / no !",3,2024,04,28
203,Cara is a Class Act,"After having a disappointing experience elsewhere, it was a breath of fresh air to receive 5-star service and an excellent cup of coffee in the morning from the lovely Cara at the beautiful Westbury Hotel. She went above and beyond to accommodate our needs, and her Irish charm and friendly smile also gave us a warm welcome. Cara is a natural in the hospitality industry and a great asset to the Westbury team. We want to extend our heartfelt thanks to Cara for making our morning!",5,2024,04,27
203,Fantastic hotel,"Fantastic hotel with first class service. Beautiful atmosphere with friendly, professional, polite and efficient staff.

203,Westbury stay,"Amazing hotel, wish we had stayed more than one night!  Breakfast was superb and the Sidecar Bar was fun and classy.  We loved the location near great shops and restaurants, but this was a quick stop in Dublin before flying out the next day.  Would love to stay here again the next time we visit.",5,2024,04,14
203,Well positioned but possibly loud,The hotel was well-positioned for touring Dublin.  Our family spent one night here and enjoyed the proximity to some of Dublin's main sites; the hotel breakfast was delicious; staff was courteous and accommodating; the rooms were comfortable and nicely appointed.  The one down side for us was the street noise - there was street music just outside our window and it persisted well beyond our desired bed time.,4,2024,04,11
203,The Westbury,"I just had lunch here, it was nice, the staff are lovely. I had scallops as a starter and fillet of beef as a main, delicious. Didn‚Äôt have room for dessert. The place is clean and tidy. Lots of available seating. The service was really quick and there is a cosy atmosphere to the place.",5,2024,04,07
203,Nice night,"Highly recommend to stay here, located within walking distance to Templebar. Food was delicious and staff catered to our every need. Enjoyable drinks with friends and fine dining. Will definitely be staying here again next time we‚Äôre in Dublin.",5,2024,04,07
203,GREAT people make the Westbury special,"Just concluded an extended stay while visiting a daughter studying abroad.  I can‚Äôt say enough about the people and staff members at The Westbury. I‚Äôm particular, the waiters, waitresses and hostesses at breakfast greeted us so warmly every day, and make us feel so welcomed and we‚Äôll looked after. Pamela, Rebecca and Nav were especially pleasant, friendly and helpful. You can‚Äôt beat the location if you want to be in the middle of everything Dublin has to offer, with Grafton Street out the front door, and cultural landmarks like Trinity, the National Gallery, St Stephen‚Äôs Green, O‚ÄôConnell Street and Temple Bar just a short walk away. But overall it‚Äôs the people that make the Westbury special and I will look forward to visiting it again.",5,2024,04,05
203,"A great, well staffed hotel in a great location.","This is a great hotel, well kept and well staffed in a great location. 
Eddie and his crew of bellmen and women/concierges are all great: always very cordial and helpful in a timely way. Mr. Darcy and Mr O'Dwyer made every effort to help solve a problem, which we accomplished in a very satisfactory way. There are great restaurants and pubs. We especially liked Wilde. the room and bathroom were spacious, clean, well-equiped - lovely. The lobby/lounging area is elegant and again, well staffed - trained professionals.",5,2024,03,20
203,Excellent lunch experience,"Went down on the train from Belfast in the morning, for lunch, and then back on the train in the evening.  Everything about it was superb, food, service, and overall ambience. The staff were so attentive, nothing was too much trouble.  Excellent",5,2024,03,16
203,"Great location, good hotel.","We stayed over a weekend for a family birthday.

The hotel is in great location near College Green, which is central and a few minutes walk from where the airport buses stop. 

The entrance is impressive with good door staff. Reception staff are helpful and friendly. 

Rooms - We had both deluxe and standard (""Classic"") rooms. The standard rooms overlook a central atrium that hosts a tea salon and bar. It had poor ventilation and was far too warm for good quality sleep. The deluxe room had exterior windows that opened and was much cooler, larger and comfortable - worth the additional cost. 

Breakfast was very good and at a quality one would expect of this grade of hotel. 

Would recommend staying here, but with an upgrade to deluxe. ",4,2024,03,16
203,"A 2-star experience, at best!","This hotel is 5-star price-wise only. For example, when we arrived, we have been welcomed by the Customer Care Person, who explained to us who she is, but said nothing on how she can help us and definitely nothing about the construction on the 4th floor of the hotel. So, banging starts at 8:30, which presumes that everyone is up and about at that hour. Apparently, they were supposed to notify me about it via e-mail, but someone just forgot about it...  If I knew there will be construction at the hotel, I would have never stayed here. I guess that's why I never got that email...
The concierge reached out to us a while ago asking why we are staying at the hotel so long. We have written to him in a reasonable detail. No response. Zero follow-up. The concierge in general was great in instructing us how we can do things ourselves.
Another example. We return to the hotel at 10 pm, and our ever-hungry teenagers would like to eat something.
- We are sorry but all the restaurants close their kitchens at 9:30 pm, and there is no room service.
- Can we have have at least some bread and butter?
(And here, the staff at 5 or even 4-star hotel would respond ""Let me see what I can do."" But instead we heard:)
- No. You need to take care of it by yourself.
And, it is like this, pretty much with everything service-wise at this hotel.
Only the staff of the first-floor caf√© seemed to know what they are doing.
It just looks like the place lacks direction from the management that is lost and confused.
To add to the ""attractions"" we could hear very clearly all the water noises coming from a room next door. We also had some trouble falling asleep as the guy next door snored like a hog in heat.
I also think that having the permanently screwed through cracked dial to a heated towel rack is something that I would find at a 2-star hotel, and I still would be surprised...
There was 6 of us in 3 rooms, and we stayed here for 6 nights. The impressions were all the same. It's the details that matter both in the customer service and the decor, and it is simply not a case here.
At the end of our stay, the front desk staff has made a scene, because we wanted a detailed invoice. Thanks to that though we found out they have charged us additional numerous positions from the mini bar, which we did NOT use. So, please be careful they will try to cheat you.",1,2024,03,15
203,Overnight stay,"We enjoyed a lovely 3 course dinner in the Wilde restaurant. Excellent service, Daniel was very pleasant. 

Very nice hotel rooms were very nice and all the staff were very friendly and pleasant. 

We also enjoyed a lovely pre dinner drink in The Sidecar.",4,2024,03,11
203,Pleasant Afternoon Tea,Myself and my friend had the privilege to enjoy some afternoon tea here at the Westbury last week. The food was absolute beautiful and the service was immaculate. We were served by a lovely girl called Millie who made our already pleasant visit a 10/10 experience. Would definitely recommend to all family and friends! Thank you to the Westbury team for having us in such a lovely atmosphere.,5,2024,03,07
203,Couldn‚Äôt use hotel bar due to lack of consideration for residents,"Room was great, very comfortable with all the amenities expected of this star hotel.
However when you can‚Äôt get in your hotel bar on a Saturday night because it‚Äôs to full and catering for afternoon tea who have chosen to extend their stay to the evening. I appreciate that a hotel needs to make money but surely residents should take some priority when using the hotel facilities, which we have paid a high price to use‚Ä¶
So disappointed that there isn‚Äôt some consideration for residents.",4,2024,03,06
203,A step into time,"Lovely evening spent in Wilde- the luxurious restaurant owned and operated by the Westbury. Amazing decor and aesthetic including a world class chandelier, indoor vegetation as well as lovely piano.  The drinks and service are also top notch!",5,2024,03,06
203,Westbury hotel with just a 2 star experience for an almost 5 star price,"Unfortunately, my entire experience with the Hotel Westbury was a great disappointment. It should become a beautiful experience on my birthday and became a bitter experience. Now to a 5 star unworthy hotel stay. The porter was fixed with the removal of the baggage on a frying evening. The Check-In went as snowy as in a simple hotel without birthday wishes or so. Everything like a robot. My demand for an upgrade matching my Doyle status was denied since the house was full. Quickly checked on the internet, it was a smooth lie. The room was a studio suite for 1 night my offer price 511 Euro normal night so from 700 Euro with breakfast. The first appearance was good. Not large, a small window on the 5th floor but nice bright and a large bathroom. But here the negative continued. When checking the cleanliness, the topper of the bed was dirty and the mattress also had the same issue, dust over the bed (it was a kind of cot) dust on the wall, dirty glassesin the minibar. I reported all these shortcomings with pictures at the assistant guest experience manager of the evening Mr. Hickey. He took them up suprised and guaranteed me a call in 5min. After almost 15 minutes there was no call, but the ladies of the housekeeping were there. But didn't know anything about the big problem of bed. After a call and further waiting there was finally a solution in the form of a new mattress. The Assistant Experience Manager has to handle the big heavy mattress with a maintance guy. The baggage came niw after about. 40min now  in the room after it stood forever lonely and partly unobserved in the area in front of the lifts. I was allowed to watch the whole drama in the room until the manager came up with the idea to offer a drink in the bar. The ladies of the housekeeping were very friendly and open to the comments. It is not for me to make someone bad, but to sharpen the view again. The drink in the lobby bar was OK but also there was not asked about the preferences of the taste. Also a small attention to the birthday was given in the form of a small dessert, which I did not really want to eat after the whole dilemma. 
Even the already renovated room left some questions as to how to remove it. The carpet was badly cut and the edges were not covered with a ledge, the upstroke in the wall of the bathtub was mounted at about 1m height and thus completely useless. The edge of the tub could not be used for standing up, since the edge of the tub was almost completely overbuilt from the wall of the mamor. The breakfast is absolutely solid but also minimal something special for a 5 star hotel. What annoys that the waiters ask you every 2 minutes with a already penetrated courtesy. No wonder if there is a card on the table where you can give tips for the service. A late check out was friendly possible and a taxi was ordered and agreed that the baggage was picked up because it was quite a bit extra. This did not work in spite of time agreement and I had to carry everything myself. At the exit of the hotel one wanted to help me what I thankfully refused. There was no excuse for the experience and anything else. Until today (over a week later) I was waiting for my bill and the obligatory guest survey after the stay. That is why I have decided to share it here. Incidentally, the member profile is not taken seriously. This is level of a 2 star hotel. Thank you for one of the most ""beautiful"" birthday experiences.",2,2024,02,17
203,5 Star Dublin Experience,"My wife and I attended the hotel on sunday 4th if february. We had a fantastic stay. Thanks to Sarah King for going our of her way to assist us. We had booked one of the new executive rooms on a high floor. The room was modern spacious with an excellent view of the city. Really cosy and luxurious. We had some drinks in balfes and service was again exceptional. We had some cocktails in the sidecar. The mixologists are so skilled and each cocktail had something special to make it stand our from others we had. Again service here was exceptional. In Wilde we had a lovely dinner. Food was of a high standard and enjoyable.
As part of our package my wife was given a 9k gold pendant with her initial on it.

Well Done The Westbury we we were very impressed",5,2024,02,14
203,Underwhelming experience ,"Great location. Great staff, but unfortunately they did not tell us the hotel was under reconstruction. And we paid full price for extremely noicy rooms. The breakfast were not up to standard for other 5 star hotels. The breakfast buffet was meager, and you could only choose one hot course from the menu. 

",3,2024,02,13
203,Avoid.,"Avoid. Staff have no training in heath and safety. The automatic door was locked with no doormen in attendance. Had to use the revolving door (while pulling luggage). Again, no doormen in attendance to ensure my safe exit. No ambulance was called and no taxi service was provided to get medical treatment.",1,2024,02,12
203,Wedding anniversary,"Had a fantastic experience with my wife for our wedding anniversary. It was a gift for from my daughter. The atmosphere in the hotel was amazing with all the hustle and bustle of Christmas. We couldn't get a booking in Balfs but Eddie managed to get us a booking in Sole its was amazing I don't know how Eddie got the booking as it was very busy. Thanks Eddie. And a big thank you to Kevin the doorman for all the info and the laughs.

We had a brilliant time.

Cheers

203,A wonderful return!,"Spent two nights here last weekend,  for my birthday,  with my husband, and  it was a wonderful experience from start to finish. On arrival,  the doorman was helpful and so welcoming. Check in was professional and very friendly..we got upgraded which is always a bonus! The room was perfectly appointed with the most comfortable bed, wonderful bedding,  robe, slippers and a powerful walk-in shower.  On first evening we ate in the onsite restaurant Wilde, which was extremely tasty with top rate service. My husband was anxious to get to see the rugby so we went next door to Bruxelles to watch on big screen. We came back to hotel for drinks/cocktails in Sidecar. A lovely touch is getting a little glass of prosecco ( on the house!)  while waiting for my cocktail.  Back at the room, turn-down was expected,  with a little chocolate to end the night! Breakfast was mixture of buffet and cooked ( menu) offering..delicious,  all served in a relaxing environment. We ate at another restaurant second night but had a nightcap in side - car before retiring. Checkout was swift, remote checkout and we were sorry to be leave but will definitely be back in the not to distant future. ",5,2024,02,09

203,I was expecting more,"The hotel is well located in the city center. Walking distance from shops, pubs and restaurants. Rooms are comfortable and service is perfect. Few things though could have been better, and this is linked to the management, not the staff. First the TV network was down in the entire hotel for a full evening, night and morning. No apologies made. Second, we spent a few nights in the hotel including NY Eve, and there was no special ¬´¬†commemoration¬†¬ª gift in the room. I spent every NY in a different Capital city of the world and there is always a little something in your room in this special evening. Last, our check out bill was wrong. There was overcharging. It took us 20mn to clear this up. All these small tiny things make a difference when you claim to be a 5 star hotel and one of the best in Dublin.",4,2024,01,01

203,Afternoon Champagne Delight.,"This was not an overnight stay, but a short call into The Gallery to escape the hustle and bustle of Grafton Street Christmas shoppers. I wanted to treat my wife to a nice bottle of champagne, and to relax for a short space of time.

We were pleasantly greeted, and quickly seated, which is where we served by Anna. She is the reason for this review. Whilst she poured our fizz we asked a few questions of her. She was extremely pleasant and interesting to converse with, and we found out that she was very young, and had only recently become part of the Westbury team.

I was taken aback! Her level of professionalism, graceful confidence and ability is rarely seen on one so young, but we were thankful for it as it added greatly to a thoroughly enjoyable experience.

So, if you read this Anna, thankyou. We hope to see you again!  ",5,2023,12,18

203," Good hotel, but rooms could be better.","We have stayed several times here and always found it to be a good quality hotel. The location is excellent, staff are polite and attentive and the quality of food is good.

On occasion this time, even if you are a guest you are asked to wait to be seated in the gallery area and bar area. So do not expect to get a seat straight away if you are a paying guest. They had no lager to serve on the Saturday evening (25 Nov), how could a hotel of this stature run out of the two only lagers on the menu.

The accommodation could do with an upgrade. The rooms are a bit dated, our room had stains on the carpet, stains on the bed blanket, and the walls had plenty of scuff marks. The carpet in the corridors is tired looking also. For a five star venue I cannot understand why they leave the laundry equipment in the corridors on what are pretty ugly trollies.

Disappointed to see the prices they now charge for the carpark. ",4,2023,11,27
203,Rude management and refusal to give money 'On Hold' back to us.,"To be honest this place is over priced for what you actually get. Our room was average, a little bit dated but that's ok, not worth the money though. 

When we arrived they took a card to hold for the room with a ‚Ç¨100 extra fee per night (Understandable), and the parking was double the price that we had gotten an email about the night prior to arriving. They reluctantly agreed to the emailed price.

The manager on the floor down in the main lobby was extremely rude and pushy to the 8 of us staying there (4 couples), each night there was a large amount of cocktails and drinks ordered. The rest of the wait staff were lovely and very accommodating.

The real issue lies when we were checking out. We also had to get our second day of car parking changed to the agreed upon price when we were checking in. We paid in cash rather than on the card they held the money on. We were told it would be 3-5 business days to get the money back.. called after 5 days, 'oh sorry that can take 7 days.' We call again after 7 days 'oh sorry that can take 10 days.' We call again after 10 days... still nothing! Their latest response is 'we'll see IF the money can be released from hold..' It would be up to us to get a letter to the bank to say they don't have anything on hold? If it goes another 2 days on the card we get charged that price from the bank. They haven't been helpful or accommodating in any way shape or form.

I would avoid this place and go to somewhere more accommodating with better standards for the price. No customer service whatsoever.",1,2023,11,27
203,Festive Treat!,We had a wonderful early Christmas afternoon tea at The Westbury; great food and tea and amazingly attentive service (thank you Miguel)!  It‚Äôs become a tradition and we‚Äôre looking forward to returning!,5,2023,11,26

203,There is no faulting this place.,"From check-in to check-out, the guest experience at the Westbury was superb. The staff are impeccably attentive and we never felt overlooked despite it being an obviously busy weekend.
The room was spotless and the heated bathroom floor tiles were a lovely comfort on a wintery November morning! You will definitely have a good night sleep in one of their queen sized beds (it was like drifting to sleep in a cloud üò¥). 
I really recommend a cocktail in their gorgeous sidecar bar, it was a highlight of our stay! Gorgeous interiors and a vigorous cocktail menu.

First interaction to last was nothing but 1st class. From the minute they took the car, and Kevin the door man introduced himself, you just knew the stay was going to be special. I had my kids with me, and even though they weren't staying with us, the staff made a real fuss of them, giving them each a Westbury teddy, which was a lovely touch. Whilst checking in, I casually mentioned that we were getting married and was there any chance of an  upgrade? This was dealt with so well, the gentleman checking me in couldn't have been more accommodating, upgrading us to the most amazing terrace suite, complete with balcony and Christmas tree! As if this wasn't enough, a bottle of champagne with chocolates was sent up to the room shortly after, another classy touch! We had two magical nights in the suite, with the bed beautifully turned down & scattered with rose petals on the night of the wedding. The whole experience really was the cherry on top of a truly special couple of days. We're still talking about it, the kids are still playing with their teddys and, even though we live in Dublin, we're already planning our next stay in the very near future! I've stayed in some nice real places but my experience in the Westbury was truly exceptional, the best in Dublin by far! ",5,2023,11,16

203,The Westbury- One of the best,"Our stay at The Westbury Hotel was fantastic. The hotel is absolutely beautiful, especially with the lovely Christmas decorations we enjoyed as we left. However, the highlight was breakfast. The food and service were outstanding. A big shoutout to Nav‚Äîhe made our experience unforgettable. Not only did he remember our names, but he also recalled what we had eaten in the previous days. It felt like he knew our orders before we even mentioned them. This truly reflects his passion and love for his job. Feeling so personalized and special made our stay memorable. The hotel is fortunate to have someone as wonderful as Nav on their team.",5,2023,11,15

203,Fabulous wedding venue,"We recently had our wedding ceremony & celebration at The Westbury. We stayed two nights in a Signature Suite. The suite was absolutely beautiful and there was lots of space to accommodate the various people dropping in - hair, makeup, photographer & flowers. The front desk managed all of the visitors seamlessly. 
The Grafton Suite was set up beautifully in the different areas we required and it just gleamed and twinkled.
Full credit  goes to Mary & Elise who assisted with the planning and the Operations Manager Sean who coordinated (with others) the celebration, drinks reception and dinner on the day. The service & management was flawless and all of our guests were very well looked after. A great experience & highly recommended as a wedding venue!",5,2023,11,11

Thee best margaritas outside of Mexico along with exception service. Our fab waitress Christina could not have been better. Definitely recommend if you‚Äôre visiting Dublin‚Ä¶ you won‚Äôt be disappointed,5,2023,11,09
203,Best Location in Dublin but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.,"As a frequent visitor to this hotel. PROS: Great Location for visiting Dublin as a tourist, shopping, restaurants, pubs, sights etc., in the pedestrian area of Grafton St. Lobby Lounge area, Wilde Restaurant for breakfast and dinner and the bar are the highlights. Staff are good in all areas. CONS: Main issue with Westbury is the noise, mostly from the street but also from your internal neighbours and sometimes from the ballroom during late night events. The sound insulation is not good. Might be a problem if you are looking for peace and quiet, small children etc. Regarding the street noise they have installed double windows which do reduce the noise somewhat but they are not always both closed fully. They don‚Äôt necessarily have the windows closed and they don‚Äôt advise the guests so it may not prevent you from being awoken at 2am or 4am. The quality of the rooms is reasonably good for a 5 star but there is an issue with the bathrooms. Because of their age and their condition and features they are tired and I would rate them 3 star. Although some rooms have new bathrooms which are more than adequate but I don‚Äôt know the proportion. Finally in relation to our most recent stay the main issue was there was substantial noise at 3:50am coming from outside the window on the 3rd floor. It sounded a little like a building site but also sounded very close to the window. Upon investigation they were actually cleaning the windows of our room on  the 3rd floor from the street below using the required machinery while shining a spotlight up at the window so they could see what they were doing, I have told a few people about this but nobody believes me yet. They think I was literally dreaming (more like a nightmare). When I checked in the morning I could see that the outer windows were open but the inner windows were closed. Can I suggest to management to come up with a different solution for the windows and to ensure all windows are closed - don‚Äôt expect the guests to make sure both layers of windows are closed. Finally I did mention the window cleaning at check out when asked. There was no follow up so I just felt the feedback here might help the management to fine tune a few things in what should and can be the ultimate experience in Dublin. ",3,2023,11,08
203,"Lovely visit, fab staff.","Lovely greeting, very welcoming, all the staff were fab but Martha in particular. We had a small issue with drinks in the bar and she sorted everything out very professionally.  She also noticed I was struggling with a cough and brought me some hot water and honey, such a lovely thing to do.",4,2023,11,07
203,Excellent experience in the Westbury,We sat in two big comfy chairs looking at the christmas lights outside the front window of the Westbury and had drinks and some dessert.

203,Great unique experience,"We just got back to the US after a great time in Dublin

Yesterday decided to have the coffee at The Westbury and luckily we got a table on the terrace. The coffee was lovely and the service was amazing.

Exceptional food‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.it never disappoints and is consistently delicious. The lovely lady, I didn‚Äôt catch her name, who serviced our room on the fifth floor was excellent and so accommodating.

203,Location Fantastic and Lovely Hotel,"The WESTBURY was the first top on a 16 day trip to Ireland and started us off in style and comfort.  The location is excellent for touring Dublin and felt very safe.  The staff greets you warmly and makes it clear that they are they to be helpful.  We booked using the AMEX Fine Resorts and Hotels program and they delivered on the extra perks including early check in. 

As others have said, the breakfast is delicious and served with smiles each morning and we also very much enjoyed a dinner at Wilde (see separate review).

Our room was of good size and luxurious and was quite quiet for a city hotel.  Our view wasn‚Äôt great but it wasn‚Äôt a big negative.

The gym was then only weak link:  quite small and with no internet connection.  For an upscale hotel, they need to upgrade that facility.

We would return and recommend it to others.",5,2023,10,21
203,Afternnon Tea in the Gallery,"I cannot thank Lauren and Arthur enough. We arrived to the Gallery for Afternoon tea, thinking we had confirmed a booking, unfortunately the booking had not been previously confirmed but Lauren fit us in with a generous time slot.

Lauren 100% took this in her stride and greeted us with professionalism and a fantastic smile. Arthur our waitor gave us a full menu tour, including recommendations and a level of hospitality which can be rare to find. Thank you both so much!

The lobby area and the bar are lovely, warm , stylish and the staff are very welcoming. The cocktails are divine. 

However the bedrooms are a little dated. The carpets are worn and look dirty. The shower and telephone need replacing. The soft furnishings, amenities and the decor are nice. However the rooms furniture is really really old and it just lets the room down a little bit. Having said that the room service was great and the bed was comfortable",4,2023,10,14

Some really nice decor internally and good amenities. We enjoyed fabulous breakfasts in the hotel and very good service in the bar and restaurant. 
A couple of things prevent me from rating it 5.  I had an issue with the bathroom on the Saturday evening and whilst I was sympathetic to the fact the hotel was busy, I wanted to have a bath. I had to speak multiple times on the phone and then had to get dressed and go to reception to sort out. Eventually, maintenance sorted the issue out but I‚Äôd missed my opportunity to go out. The duty manager apologised and I was offered a drink in the bar but I did tell them I was on my own as husband out. I did feed this back after our stay and I let them know that I felt they could have done more by way of an apology. 
Also, this isn‚Äôt the hotel‚Äôs fault but understandably the nature of the location can bring noise issues.",4,2023,10,10
203,A perfect afternoon. ,"We had an afternoon tea booked for six of us as a treat and it definitely was a treat.

203,Afternoon tea,"Went for afternoon tea and our server Miguel was the best ever. He was so prompt on checking on us, explaining how afternoon tea works, brining our orders down to us.

203,Afternoon tea with Adam and the Americans ,"I went to Westbury,  Dublin,  for afternoon tea with my friends visiting from the USA.  Lauren,I believe,  greeted us at the front desk. While jordi settled us at our table.  Where we met Adam Cahill,  Adam was the perfect server and greeter. From Adams first introduction to Adams farewell.  He was awesome.  Adam went through the menu. Adam asked us about allergies and dislikes and Adam explained   in great detail , what to expect from the afternoon tea experience.
It turned out that Adam was one of the pupils from a school I had previously worked at as a lollipop lady and Adam is a cousin of another family my American friends were here to see. 
When we finished afternoon tea Adam boxed our leftovers and stored them in the refrigerator while we strolled around town. Over all we had an excellent experience and would definitely recommend the Westbury for afternoon tea. You are lucky to have Adam, everybody needs and Adam..",5,2023,10,07
203,"8/10 hotel experience, room disappointing","Good things: friendly staff including front desk, doormen, waitstaff. Wonderful location 1 block from pedestrian mall, walking distance to restaurants, clean and pleasant public spaces, terrific breakfasts, great restaurant (Wilde).

The bad: our studio suite king room at a cost north of $800/night was not what we hoped for. The bathroom was tiny with a tub/shower combo that was hard to enter and slippery. The toilet was a few inches from the shower wall. A single sink with very little storage space was crowded and only allowed one person at a time. The bedroom itself was spacious in contrast to the tiny bathroom. Our bed was so high up that my wife could not get into the bed. We asked for a step stool but were told that was a safety problem and not allowed, so we piled up pillows and books to help her get into the bed. We asked for a different room but were told the hotel was fully booked. The next day we were offered a handicapped room but by then we did not want to repack all our belongings. The view out our 2nd floor window was a tarred roof or balcony of sorts, really ugly. Twice the management said they were sorry we didn't like the room, but not much they could do for us.",4,2023,10,06
203,Great Hotel,Hotel was clean and well appointed.  Staff was attentive and easy to work with.  Location was perfect to walk to almost all sites in the city.  Food was excellent.  Would not recommend driving into Dublin.  ,5,2023,10,05

203,Same old problems at The Westbury.,"Stayed a the Westbury a few weeks ago during one of my very regular business trips to Dublin. Stayed a few times in the past, but in the last trips decided to stay at other hotels (Merrion, Marker, Conrad) because in past stays The Westbury didn't meet my expectations. This time wasn't different. Almost all the comments I will make on this review are comments I made on previous reviews.

Check in - they asked me if it was my first stay at the hotel....weird, because stayed many times in the past. I would expect their system to identify regular clients, otherwise I wonder how you recognise and reward loyalty

Temperature in the room - literally a sauna, unbearable hot. AC is deficient and does not properly cool the room down. It was a hot summer night and it was impossible to get a decent sleep because of the heat.  Exactly same problem as time ago during a stay during the summer.  Definitely a hotel to avoid on hot summer days. 

Room service - good food, nice, tasty. Delivered right on time....challenge is that after I ate, they knocked on my door to deliver food I didn't order so told the waiter that it was a mistake and he left.....but nevertheless  I was charged for this food I didn't order and I didn't ate. When checking out, told the lady at reception and she showed a remarkable level of dissatisfaction because had to amend my bill.  Not even a minor apology. Instead of this, a body language which does not belong to a hotel like The Westbury.

In summary, recurrent shortfalls, issues, gaps in service on a hotel which definitely should be operating at a much higher level. It's a real shame because hotel itself is nice and in very good location.",3,2023,09,26
203,Great hotel,"I had a wonderful stay in the westbury hotel.
I was greeted by a really nice Concierge named Kevin who looked after my luggage and provided helpful insightful information. 
I was then greeted at front desk by a wonderful receptionist named Julia who had a beautiful smile and was perfect at her job...
I then had dinner in the wilde restaurant were our server Alex was incredibly professional and went above and beyond with everything. 
He asked us for our first names as he liked to speak with us on a first name basis which we appreciated. He remembered our names for the night and was such a wonderful host to us.
Our overall stay was very pleasant, and as a manager in another 5 star hotel, I noticed every little detail and must admit I learned a few things from the incredible hospitality I experienced. 
I had the steak for dinner with Mash, and it was perfect.
For breakfast, I just had some juice, sausages, white pudding, and beans, all of which were perfect. 
I heavily recommend this play as it was an overall wonderful hotel!
At checkout, I was once again greeted by the Concierge Kevin, who again was very professional and friendly.. what an awesome guy!
Thanks for such an enjoyable stay, westbury!
Hope to see you again someday!",5,2023,09,25
203,Great Place,"Great place! It‚Äôs a nice, clean, comfortable place to stay. The staff were all very helpful. The location was perfect and couldn‚Äôt be beat. I am glad that I picked the Westbury and would stay there again.",5,2023,09,24
203,Great staff ,"Special mention to Thomas the bellman, who was calm centred, humerous, and human... solved my issue with aplomb and grace. You can't buy that kind of service, he even made the ‚Ç¨5.70 bill for mediocre cold coffee, served in a paper cup much less of A sting. He's a keeper. ",5,2023,09,24
203,Great experience!,"The food was delicious and after a day of walking, it was exactly what we needed to relax! Recommend going for afternoon tea, the perfect pick me up! The staff are so friendly and welcoming too. 10/10 recommend. ",5,2023,09,24

203,Excellent service and lovely atmosphere,"Our waitress Berna was really lovely, it was a birthday and we were so well looked after. It is somewhere really nice to go as a treat as it‚Äôs it‚Äôs fairly costly but absolutely worth it. The food was good, the room is lovely but it‚Äôs mainly the atmosphere that makes it special and that‚Äôs a lot to do with the attentive but not intrusive staff. Already planning a return visit. Would definitely recommend. ",5,2023,09,23
203,Birthday Treat,"The staff are brilliant in all areas from the moment we arrived by car. No wondering what to do or where to go - everyone just steps in and you are sorted. Waiting staff are attentive, polite and friendly in Balfes Restaurant and during breakfast service with our waitress Berna. Comfy rooms and a good nights sleep. Centrally located - can‚Äôt ask for more.",5,2023,09,23
203,Excellent stay ,Wonderful hotel in the heart of Dublin. Excellent location and attentive staff. Everything i. Town was within walking distance. The rooms were spacious and every need was met. I will be back on my next stay! ,5,2023,09,23

Breakfast at the Wilde was fantastic! May was our server & fantastic- the food was delicious!! We had omelettes & toasted sourdough bread with butter. She even made us to go cups of coffee.",5,2023,09,23
203,Nice but had some problems,"The hotel is amazingly well-located and visually beautiful. A few problems though : our room was hot and the air conditioning system just wasn‚Äôt powerful enough to cool it off adequately or get it below ~72 or so degrees. The windows did not open fully and there was a lot of street noise below, including car alarms and what sounded like drunk people yelling. Also, I needed to eat my lunch in the lobby area since my room was being cleaned, and I was practically chased out for bringing in outside food. So, there‚Äôs nowhere to hang out casually unless you‚Äôre actively paying them for drink or food.  Front desk staff was nice, though. Wouldn‚Äôt return, however.",3,2023,09,22
203,Fabulous Experience,Beautiful food and the most amazing service. Artur took care of us and was polite and professional. We will return for sure. The experience was exceptional. We will return and hope to have Artur looking after us again ,5,2023,09,22
203,Excellent location‚Ä¶staff great!,"Hotel is in prime Dublin location and is perfect for a visit to the city. Lobby was relaxing and overall staff were pleasant.  Restaurant (Wilde) was best we had in Dublin.  Want to call out one employee who is front office assistant, Julia F, who literally saved our trip after I left a valuable item in my room.  She rushed it to get shipped to next hotel out near Galway the next day.  Thank you Julia.  One tip, some rooms are not updated.  They might try and get you to upgrade to suite, on lower floors.  Try to stay on top floors that are nicely updated.  Great stay and Julia‚Ä¶thank you!!!",5,2023,09,20
203,excellent stay ,"Great restaurant environment

Breakfast we had bacon eggs sausages I think not a good idea to have crispy bacon
The selection selection of tea was great and coffee the pastries were great",5,2023,09,20
203,Decent hotel in a good location but a bit tired,"We arrived in Dublin and spent our first two nights at the Westbury. It was a very good location and a reasonable hotel just not as good as others in town .We had guaranteed early check-in which they couldn't accommodate for us and we asked for a room on a higher floor (I think they have 6). We went for a three hour walking tour and came back and we were on the fourth floor with a poor view of an ugly roof. That being said it was a large room though I would say a bit tired. The staff was very friendly and solid and it was a decent stay. Would probably lean to giving it a 3.5 but options were only 3 or 4 and I couldn't say it was ""very"" good but just good.",3,2023,09,19
203,Very pleasant experience ,We are at Wlide‚Äôs on o Tuesday afternoon. Food was just lovely. Really excellent service. We were travelling with a 1yr old and the staff (Berna) couldn‚Äôt have been more accommodating. Highly recommended. ,5,2023,09,19
203,Impeccable service!!,Adam was our server both in the evening for cocktails and then for afternoon tea. He was the epitome of hospitality and what fine dining service should be! I have not had service this fabulous in a very long time. It was delightful to see that this service still exist somewhere. We will definitely be back!,5,2023,09,19
203,"Excellent service, swanky vibe","Adam was very attentive! We stopped here for our last drink. He recommended his favorite; but we ended up ordering every drink on the menu. We ordered a drink off the menu, and he came back and told us it was the bar tenders favorite drink! It was very good. He offered a reservation for afternoon tea the next day! ",5,2023,09,18
203,Drinks at the Sidecar,We walked in about an hour before closing and were immediately swept off to a beautiful table. Adam was our angel!! He just kept replacing our snacks and gently checking on us throughout our visit. He even made the bartenders make cocktails that weren‚Äôt on the menu (the Last Word)! His conversation and energy were perfect and he really made our Dublin trip a fairytale.,5,2023,09,18
203,absolutely phenomenal. adam was brilliant.,"as hospitality professionals in nyc visitng dublin for a wedding, we received some of the best service we‚Äôve had all year. adam was extremely warm and kind without being overbearing, provided top notch service without feeling pretentious. attentive and went above and beyond. drinks were phenomenal. cannot recommend the sidecar enough. ask for adam",5,2023,09,18
203,Disappointing,"When we checked in, we find out breakfast is not included. Since we were staying for 4 days and paying a fair bit for the room, we requested breakfast be included. The girl at the desk says she will have to ask and will get back to us. Once we are checked in and settling into the room, they call us and say ""oh yes we can accommodate your request for breakfast"". Great, we say. Next morning, the breakfast hostess takes our name and room and looks at her list and says ""breakfast is not included for you, correct?"" We say, ""it is included actually as we spoke to reception about it last night at check-in"". After the breakfast, being the careful people we are, my wife and I go to reception and say ""the breakfast hostess seems to think breakfast is not included in our stay so why is that?"". The receptionist says ""let us look into that and call you."" Twenty minutes later they call our room. ""Oh sir please disregard what the breakfast hostess is telling you, their lists are not updated compared to ours and we make an adjustment on our side and I can confirm for you the breakfast is included"". Great, we say. At check-out, being the careful people we are, we say to the receptionist, now there are no extra charges for breakfast right?"". ""No, you owe us nothing extra"". Fast forward 3-4 days and we are back in Canada and I get a charge for 280 Euros on my credit card for breakfast during our 4 day stay. I email and then call long distance and have to explain to the front desk manager and explain all this. He ""investigates"" for like 3 days and then comes back and says ""breakfast was not included and you requested it so the charge stands. I am not sure why when you checked out nobody told you about it"". 

Anyway, my wife and I are fortunate enough to be able to stay at luxury hotels from time to time and are absolutely stunned by how they are handling this. Hopefully, this helps someone in the future. Other then that, the hotel is fine but we won't be staying there again anytime soon.",1,2023,09,17
203,Service above and beyond,"The Westbury Dublin has the best and most amazing staff. When it comes to service, I rate Westbury above all the hotels that I have visited worldwide in the past 30 years.

I have left some reviews for individual restaurants and employees. However, the gallery does not show up on Tripadvisor. I must say I‚Äôve received an incredible service and accommodation from Adam in the gallery last night, trying to please my wife for the type of caviar and the style of toast that she wanted . Quite frankly, I probably would‚Äôve thrown her out since I would‚Äôve lost my patience after 10 minutes with her. However, Adam and Elias, and one of the managers aimed to satisfy her taste for caviar.  Great job. Thank you.",5,2023,09,17
203,Highly Recommend,"The Afternoon Tea at The Westbury was such a treat!  We were waited on by Emily, who was so sweet and pleasant, and attended to our every need. Very attentive!  Thank you Emily!  The tea sandwiches, scones, and mini dessert selections were simply to die for. We weren‚Äôt sure what to expect, but we left there feeling extremely full and satisfied. Highly recommend. ",5,2023,09,14
203,Great experience ,I recently went to the Westbury with a friend of mine and the service and quality of food was next to none. Lauren sat us and looked after us during our afternoon teas experience. She was so helpful with and pleasant. Will for sure be back again,5,2023,09,13

203,Amazing dinner,Gio was the absolute best server we experienced in all of Ireland. Incredible food. Incredible service. The chicken spatchcock was incredible. The maple cask cocktail was Devine. Everyone should go to Wilde and ask for Gio!,5,2023,09,12
203,"Lovely staff, great location, wonderful food but small rooms for the price","We have stayed at the Westbury a few times previously.  Always treated very well with friendly, helpful staff. Food continues to be excellent.  
Stayed on the 6th floor in a room advertised at 270 sq ft. However the room felt quite small with a tiny bathroom (shower no bath) and low ceilings. A few niggles with a bent ironing board, flickering light but otherwise everything functioning well.  The beds were very comfortable and supportive with good linen and sheets.
Perfect location for walking tours around the city",3,2023,09,11
203,Excellent experience,"The westbury Dublin! 
I attended the Westbury hotel in Dublin this weekend for my first afternoon tea experience and I was blown away with the service, the food and the experience as a whole. The staff in the hotel are delightful and always happy to help. We were looked after well by Lauren and Ivana and Kim.

I always look forward to staying here.",5,2023,09,10
203,Always a lovely time,"Second time having high tea here. Very accommodating. Our server Miguel was fabulous; attentive, professional, and knowledgeable. I love that you can order extras of anything you like and that they have ICED teas as an option! Perfect for the warm day we came on. Still dreaming of the fresh baked scones. A first for me is that I asked for seconds of the tea sandwiches!  All was lovely. Would come again for yet another celebration. ",5,2023,09,10
203,Did not live up to expectations,"Disappointed. Booked 2 rooms, received upgrades but the carpet was very dirty, rooms were very dated. AC was almost nonexistent and almost unbearable to sleep. Asked for a fan and felt like we were inconveniencing then. Had breakfast and lunch at the restaurant and disappointed in selection and flavor. Tried to call valet to bring car around and said we must come down to give our ticket. We did but waited for 10 minutes for someone to come assist, then waited another 10 minutes for the car. Felt constantly rushed. ",2,2023,09,10
203,Afternoon tea,"We had a lovely experience. Food was lovely and great service from Miguel! Great options if you have any dietary requirements.

203,2023 short break,"The hotel location is why I stay at the Westbury, The Sidecar bar is great, the rooms are dated with the Shower in the Bath with a fixed shower head... The breakfast coffee pot was stale and just warm, the orange juice use to be great but now just taste average.. The breakfast service was good. My rating for B&B at 500+euro a night is ""could do better""....",4,2023,09,06
203,Excellent Return,Returned to the hotel after a period of 15 years and all aspects of the hotel and its staff were excellent as they were all that time ago. Would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for the best in Dublin. ,5,2023,09,06
203,"Old rooms, worn out suites - not 5 star and very expensive","As a GHA member, I use many of the global brands for business travel and was looking forward to this experience. This is not a 5 star hotel. It has a great location, lobby and reception area but the rooms are so worn that it became a distraction. I was in one of the suites, and without exaggerating, the entire experience felt like a 1990's 3 star hotel - worn carpet, old and outdated furniture, creaky entrance door, light that don't align with the room (bathroom light is actually in the hallway?), step in tub to shower with a swinging glass door design from 1990s, rusted drain, and a shower head you'd buy at Walmart. I'm so disappointed that for 750 a night for their Studio Suite, this was the experience. You don't need to pay that anywhere to get a better room experience, AND I learned the next morning, the rate didn't include breakfast (that's my fault for not checking) but if this is the suite experience, then I don't know what the standard rooms are like, perhaps they've upgraded those and they are working on the rest of the hotel. Regardless, Dublin has very limited 5 star hotel options downtown, but I won't stay here again. Westbury - please update your hotel",3,2023,09,06
203,Summer Afternoon Tea,"We enjoyed Summer Afternoon Tea and the experience was a joy! The tea, champagne and the food were all top quality and quite delicious!! Miguel was very attentive and one of the best servers we encountered on our 12 days in Ireland.",5,2023,09,02

203,Over the top good,"We loved the attention to every detail.  They were professional, helpful, and friendly.  The location was great because it was nested in a corner away from the noise of the main street.  It is not the least expensive hotel, but worth every penny.",5,2023,08,30

Unusual for a 5 star hotel is the service at the front door when you are arriving or departing.  Helping with cabs, bags on arrival, or on  departure did not happen.  I was only helped when I got inside the building and someone saw me and my wife pulling our bags.   My observation is that staff is happy to stand inside and pop open the door at the ramp if they see you, but nobody greets you outside.   After four days at the hotel, I could not imagine any of the staff holding an umbrella to help my wife get in a cab.  They are almost certainly understaffed in this department.",4,2023,08,27
203,Afternoon Tea ,Miguel was an excellent server at Afternoon Tea. He was very detailed and gave us a walk through of what to expect and lovely recommendations. He was very attentive and went above and beyond with his service.,5,2023,08,27

Couldn't fault anything. The food was amazing and there was more than enough for us with the option to get extras. Thanks Marlene.",5,2023,08,26
203,Great experience,This is a very classy hotel with excellent food and amenities. You couldn't ask for a better location. Grafton street is right out the door. The hotel lobby is Hugh and the service is fantastic. They have 2 restaurants which are great. The rooms are large but the shower is too high and narrow but that is common in Europe. ,5,2023,08,25
203,"Wonderful stay, awesome day managers (Craig & Jack)","We chose the Westbury because of its location and proximity to all the places we wanted to check out in Dublin. We had 2 young kids with us and they setup a tent and provided 2 bears and a bunch of goodies for each kid. Breakfast was the best we had while we were in Ireland, service was prompt and they even asked if we wanted to take some of the food to go for the kids. 

We stayed for 3 nights and on our last day, we has an unfortunate accident when our youngest son, 1.5 years old spilled hot tea down his arm. My husband went to the gents‚Äô restroom to run cold water down his arm. Two of the day managers, Craig and Jack, checked on my son and provided first aid burn dressing. They acted very fast. His wound is healing now (2 weeks after we get home) with no visible signs of long lasting scarring.

The one thing that would have been better is housekeeping hours. We were woken up by housekeeping at 8 for them to check if we wanted to have the room cleaned which we declined at that hour. We were out until 5:30-6 and housekeeping didn‚Äôt come back until we were about to go back into our room so we had to wait down at the lobby. 

But overall we had a wonderful time at the Westbury.",5,2023,08,25

203,Nowhere better in Dublin!,"What an experience we had at The Westbury! For my wife‚Äôs 30th birthday I surprised her with a stay in Dublin. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everything was truly exceptional.

We were greeted with valet parking by two very friendly attendants. When we checked into our room the customer experience staff had left a small gift for my wife; a very nice touch.

The rooms were well apportioned in a classical style - the linens and soft furnishings were top quality.

All of the eateries within the hotel were second to none - from the friendly service and delicious cocktails in The Sidecar to the beautiful lunch in the bright foyer.

The Westbury‚Äôs real asset, despite its amazing comforts, are its staff. Everyone we encountered from the cleaning staff to Kate in The Sidecar, could not have been more friendly or helpful!

We have stayed in many of Irelands 5* hotels, but we‚Äôve never quite experienced anything like this - when in Dublin we‚Äôll now stay nowhere else.

From Victoria and Patricia treating us like family in the Sidecar to Anderson the concierge going out of his way to grab us breakfast on a very early morning tour.  The service is second to none.

We had a hair dryer go up in flames on us and was no fault of the hotel, yet they sent us a lovely letter apologizing and provided us with chocolates and champagne the next day.  The hotel is located in a perfect spot within walking distance to just about everything.  The condition in great and the staff take a lot of pride in maintaining the facility in terms of cleanliness and condition.  

The stars of the show are the staff though and the friendliness they exhibit. You couldn't find a nicer group of people, always greeting you and calling you by name.

Brendan was also incredible when we had our dinner there. Also, we have to give praise to Audrey at the lobby entrance.  She was just amazing, helpful, and had a lot of advice for us as we wondered where we should eat on the last night.  Overall, it is no surprise to us why the Westbury is ranked number one.  We have stayed at the best of the best but the Westbury is truly the cream of the crop. The location, accommodation itself, and  staff our perfect.

203,The Westbury Dublin,"What a nice hotel to stay at while in Dublin, It was in a great location and was first class. The staff was welcoming and helpful.

203,middle of dublin delight,an upmarket hotel which is luxurious in a traditional way - service is great. However - warning - it is full of loud tourists from the USA. And it is overpriced per night - tho the food was fairly priced and good,4,2023,07,07

He couldn‚Äôt have done more to look after us! We will be back.",5,2023,07,07
203,Wilde - a 5 star experience!,Fantastic experience in Wilde. A fantastic atmosphere and service. The sole was amazing!! Drinks in the sidecar post dinner was also lovely with a great buzz. The new cocktail menu is defintely very special!,5,2023,07,07
203,Staff are lovely ,"The hotel is in a very central location within easy walking distance of Grafton Street and St. Stephens Green. It's tucked on a side street so you don't get to much traffic noise even with its central location.
 
Check in was fast and smooth. I did ask if I had a quiet room, was assured I did but on getting to the room found it right next to the lifts. It wasn't a quiet room. At night you could here guests in the corridor and often they weren't trying to be quiet. 

The room itself was pretty standard. Bed was large and comfy, had most of the bathroom amenities required, big bath but as I'm finding now in '5*' hotels they don't offer this anymore.. cost cuts impacting that old luxury style. There were tea and coffee facilities as well as a well stocked mini bar. WiFi was good strength. The one thing I did love was the big water glasses, I wish the tea and coffee cups had been large mugs too rather than the smaller tea cups, but that's personal preference. 

There is a gym but it doesn't open until 9am!! Madness if you are staying at this hotel for work it's impossible to use. It stays open until 9pm but with evening work events as well it made it impossible for me to fit in with their restricted timings. I did find a pay as you go FlyeFit only 10min walk away and they open at a respectable 5am for workers so there was a solution.

Breakfast was a very pleasant affair, lots of choice on the menu and everything is made fresh to order and was very delicious. The staff are very pleasant and attentive, each guest is welcomed by name and the service staff continue to address each guest by name when taking orders and checking everything is well. A really nice touch to make guests feel special. The same applied to room service. A very lovely lady took my order and within 30mins it arrived. Food was delicious. My only feedback would be don't put ice cream on a hot dessert plate, by the time it arrives to the room the ice cream is completely melted. 

All in all it's a strong choice for a central Dublin hotel. ",4,2023,07,07
203,Exeptional Team members,"During our recent visit at this beautiful hotel, We were amazed by the outstanding team members who made our stay truly exceptional. Specially, I would like to highlight the fantastic service provided by Karolina at reception.
From the moment We arrived Karolina greeted us with a warm smile and genuine enthusiasm that immediatly made us welcome. She took her time and provided us with detailed information about the hotel and brought us to our bedroom.  Her knowledge and attention to detail were truly imprressive.
All team members in the hotel were so professional, friendly and they made our stay truly special.",5,2023,07,06
203,TERRIBLE Family Vacation Experience,"My entire stay at the hotel was a nightmare since we checked in, they kept us for hours waiting and didn't even offer a glass of water while we waited.  Someone dropped the ball on our reservations. 
 Laura the manager tried to give us a solution by giving us an extra room free of charge that didn't connect to our room, and was several doors away for my ""8yr old son"" that is also a sleep walker.   They also knew that we were changing rooms on Jul 2 and the room was not ready so we waisted half a day packing and waiting for them to give us the room.   ",1,2023,07,06
203,Cocktails in the sidecar ,I stayed at the westbury for my birthday with my partner. We had dinner in Wilde while we were there. The star of the show is the sidecar bar. They have great cocktails and the bartenders are great. Especially Mattia. He is great. He created for me a unique cocktail for my birthday. Really made me feel special. Even if you don‚Äôt stay here I would recommend the bar. ,4,2023,07,06
203,Most classic hotel in Dublin,"This wonderful hotel retains its history and service from a bygone era. The location is perfect for all central sites. Highly recommend. The Side car bar is a wonderful place to meet, and the rooms are uber comfortable.",5,2023,07,05
203,5 star location. But not a 5 star hotel.,"First trip to Dublin. 3 night stay. The Westbury has a fantastic location in the center of the city. Walking distance to the top shopping area and many of the best restaurants. The hotel itself is a bit of an illusion unfortunately. The common areas are fairly swanky. Elegant with some glam touches. Clearly updated. The lobby seating area and bar are aesthetically something you might expect at a Ritz Carlton or a Four Seasons. However, that‚Äôs where the disconnect begins‚Ä¶.
The accomodations are incredibly inconsistent. Our first room was a ‚Äústudio suite‚Äù on the 4th floor. Spacious- yes. But that is where it began and ended. It was awful. Yes they had planted some updated furniture in it. But the ceiling had visible cracks. Filthy windows (bird droppings) and dead insects in the interior frame. Stained curtains that were visibly off their tracks. Old AC unit that barely worked. Stained carpet and an old bathroom. Yes it was marble and in fairness, it jwas clean. But the actual fixtures for the shower and tub were a throwback in time. It was a shower/tub combo which in and of itself was gross especially for a 5 star hotel. There was a small glass partition for the shower, that no matter what you did- the rest of the bathroom and toilet were sopping wet. And dim lighting. I tried to access the mini bar which wouldn‚Äôt open and even when someone from the front desk did open it- it wasn‚Äôt cold and I needed space to store medication. A separate fridge was delivered into the room. However, it made so much noise that we had to shut it off. We went down to the front desk and complained and asked if there were renovated rooms/suites in the hotel. The answer was yes (wish we knew that before checking in). We asked for one. But none were available/ However, the next day, we were able to change accomodations and we were given 526 which was another ‚Äústudio suite.‚Äù Night and day. Spacious, new everything. Large, oversized closet with tons of hanging and drawer/storage options. Beautiful furniture. Large, bright brand new marble bathroom with separate bath and shower. Electric shades for the windows in the bedroom. Like I said, this was a whole different experience. Hard to believe we were in the same hotel. We did speak with several members of the guest management team and all were In agreement that our original suite should not be inventoried for use. We also learned that the accommodations on the 5th and 6th floors have all been completely renovated. Those below have not. One more thing, the tvs are not smart TVs and offered very limited channels  which for a five star property and in this day and age is ridiculous. While guest management was quite polished and professional- there was a drop off thereafter. Plenty of eager front desk staff that meant well-
but lacked experience and was inconsistent. The concierge presence was definitely weak. One person and not always there. One afternoon at 5pm- we were told they had left for the day? Very strange to be honest, and the location at this small desk down by the car valet was equally odd. Our bellman was more helpful. The restaurant Wilde was solid for breakfast. Service was good. Not great. Afternoon tea is where the hotel shines most in my opinion. I wish I could give a more positive overall review. There is a lot of potential here to be a true five star property. But, serious improvements need to be made in the interim.",3,2023,07,04
203,Very luxurious,Everything was perfect except the gym. It was small and old machines with limited hours. Other than that service and food were excellent. Highly recommended. They treat you individually and listen to your requests.,5,2023,07,04
203,Afternoon tea,"Had a lovely afternoon tea today, service was good as always. Adam served us, who made our day, very pleasant chat, good humour and quick service.
Nice food , lot of choice, pleasant and comfortable surroundings ",5,2023,07,03
203,"Definitely NOT a Worthwhile ""High End"" Property","Hard to pinpoint the worst part - perhaps the curtness of the front desk staff?  The fact that neither of our rooms was ready when we arrived at 12:30 pm (granted check in is at 3 but we sent various notes to the property ahead of our arrival requesting at least 1 of the rooms to be available).  Speaking of notes to the property ahead of arrival, we requested a room on a high floor away from the elevator preferably on a corner.  The room we received was on the 2d Floor and only 2 rooms away from the elevator.  Regarding the room, I have closets in my house which are larger than the bathroom in this room, and my house is nice but by no means a mansion.  Also the design of the bathroom is poor - there is no way to turn on the shower without getting the bathroom wet, unless of course you want to stand in it while the water heats up.  Last but not least, the seal in our window was broken, so the wind provided a unique howling sound to our stay, which detracted from our sleep.  All in all, we would prefer staying at a youth hostel to The Westbury - and indeed we saw an interesting one during our stay so perhaps when we come back to Dublin we'll check it out. 

PS - we are now at the Four Seasons in Prague - literally everything which was wrong with The Westbury is perfect in this property.  Perhaps the folks at The Westbury should do some comparison shopping at other properties and learn from their peers!",1,2023,07,03
203,Not worth the price.,"We just checked out today after a 3 night stay. This hotel was not worth half of the daily rate. Location is good and lobby is nice, but that is it. Our key cards had to be replaced at least twice every day because they quit working, but with only 2 elevators to service the building, it meant waiting n elevators or taking the stairs to get replacements. We were NOT keeping them near mobile phones nor credit cards, but the front desk indicated the key card system has been problematic. 

Breakfast service at Wilde restaurant was incredibly slow. I ordered a cappuccino each morning and never waited less than 20 minutes just for the coffee, even reminding them. I would not spend my money to stay there again.",2,2023,07,02
203,Afternoon Tea at The Westbury,"Had afternoon tea at The Westbury Miguel was a wonderful server. He was attentive and made our visit truly memorable. A wide selection of teas, coffees, sandwiches and pastries. Very nice experience. The Westbury is exceptional. A Must do if visiting Dublin.",5,2023,07,02
203,Amazing coffee and pastries,"Gorgeous hotel, top notch coffee and very friendly staff. Concierge Kevin has a lovely way with people - noticed my elderly mother would be better taking the lift to the cafe and kindly escorted her. ",5,2023,07,01
203,Afternoon Tea,"Had afternoon tea today for a family birthday and had the pleasure of being served by Miguel who couldn‚Äôt do enough for us, was extremely helpful and friendly, he made the whole experience great from start to finish. ",5,2023,06,29
203,An afternoon tea sesh The Gallery is a MUST,"What a stunning space just graced with elegance, calmness and posture! Spent a pocket of my afternoon with a delightful afternoon tea at the Gallery. From the moment I walked through, Dionne, who is at the front of the house made me feel so welcomed. The sandwiches and desserts were on point. Especially the humble egg salad sandwich. I don‚Äôt know what it is about the Westbury, it could be the perfectly fluffy brioche tucked with this harmonious juxtaposition of textures : larger cuts of the eggs whites meshed elegantly with the creaminess of the egg yolk! Text book perfect of you asked me. This is coupled by the gracious hospitality of Rory, Miguel and Marlene who checked in at the perfect cadence to make this meal so special! Miguel just went above and beyond with his hospitality and did not miss a beat! Thank you sincerely for this the Westbury Family! I truly look forward to coming back and staying at the Westbury the next time I‚Äôm in Dublin!",5,2023,06,29
203,A 5* Doyle Hotel with 3* Accommodation!,"My husband and I having just returned from a 5 night stay in The Westbury Hotel, needed some time to process our thoughts and feelings after an extremely disappointing experience.  As a Dubliner, I visited this hotel numerous times since it opened in 1984.  However, I never stayed there as a guest until now.

Let me be clear from the outset the staff were excellent, performing their duties always with a smile on their faces, trying to accommodate guests as well as possible.

On the contrary, our Room 336 was appaling and totally unfit for use in any self-respecting hotel let along a 5* Luxury Hotel member of ""The Leading Hotels of the World"".  To mention just a few problems: a mattress fit for the dump, a headboard soiled and torn, stains on the bedspread and carpet and stained curtains handing off the rails.

When the concierge came to collect our luggage and asked whether we had enjoyed our stay, we pointed out the problems with the room.  He said he would send the manager up to us before we checked out.  The Assistant Guest Experience Manager came and agreed the room should never have been rented to guests.  Considering the fact that he took a photo with his phone and said he would order the room to be closed for guests, we still had to pay the full amount which averaged ‚Ç¨500 per day.  The only gesture of good will was removing a ‚Ç¨25 charge per day for parking a car we didn't have.  If we hadn't checked the bill, which was in an Express Check Out envelope under our door, we would have paid an extra ‚Ç¨125 for a service we didn't avail of.

As a Dubliner I am appalled at what has become of a Doyle Hotel.  You the reader can decide whether making money at any cost is the new ethos of The Doyle Collection.!
",2,2023,06,29
203,Staff are exceptional,"A fantastic experience at this most beautiful hotel. It really is 5 star luxury, from the moment you arrive at front door. Staff are so attentive polite & cannot do enough for the guest. Kevin the doorman is exceptional, deserves a special mention. 
The heated floor in the bathroom of our en-suite, the chocolates on our pillow, the extras that make it such an enjoyable stay. 
Cocktails at the bar were excellent, we got a complimentary baby presecco while we waited for our order ! 
Looking forward to my return visit to The Westbury already. ",5,2023,06,28
203,Wonderful place to enjoy your Dublin vacation,"Stayed here with my family for three nights and could not have been happier. 
-The hotel location is prime; less than a five minute walk from St. Stephens Green, a block from Grafton St., and super close to Trinity college and the Temple Bar area.

-In addition to its central location, the hotel has a really nice vibe inside. The main lobby area has lots of comfortable seating and tables on which you can enjoy drinks or food. There is also a really nice bar right off the lobby with a very distinct and cool feel. I would characterize the overall vibe of the hotel as being modern, chic, and understated

-The rooms were very comfortable and well appointed.

The only downside I can point to is the hotel gym was only adequate. Could have been bigger and had more weights.

Overall, an excellent hotel that I could not recommend more.",5,2023,06,28
203,"Great location, very nice hotel","My husband and I enjoyed our stay at the Westbury.  Its location can't be beat - central to so many of the attractions and restaurants in Dublin.  Our room was very nice as well.  

I would say the service was good but not great.  We arrived late morning, and the person at the front desk said our room had actually been cleaned but just needed to be inspected before we could check in.  We were thrilled by this news, having flown overnight and ready for a rest and a shower.  However, it still took her over an hour to allow us into the room, and that with numerous prompts from us.  

Additionally, we had some difficulty each morning with breakfast.  The servers couldn't quite get our orders right.  But the food itself was very good.",4,2023,06,27
203,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"We had an amazing experience of afternoon tea at The Gallery in The Westbury to celebrate my mum‚Äôs birthday. Our waiter Adam was outstanding and made our experience so enjoyable and special. He catered to our every need and was so hospitable.

I would highly recommend having afternoon tea at The Gallery in the Westbury!",5,2023,06,27
203,Lovely Afternoon Tea Experience,"A lovely afternoon tea experience. Celebrated a special birthday with family members. Lovely room and ambiance. All feels very special. Excellent attentive staff.

Looked after very well by Cara and Marlene. ",5,2023,06,27
203,A very warm welcome,We were 4 friends having afternoon tea at the Westbury and Adam and Miguel could not have looked after us any better!  So friendly and kind and funny.  You need to hang on to both of these guys -they absolutely know what customer service is all about!! ,5,2023,06,26
203,Outstanding,"Outstanding service, food and location.  Loved every element of the trip.  We had made an error with our reservation, and the hotel could not have been more reassuring in solving the problem.  Wilde was an exceptional dining experience.",5,2023,06,26
203,Tiny room very poor value,"For 600 Euros a night you get a tiny room and bathroom, you can‚Äôt unpack a thing.  The headboard was damaged.  Public areas are v nice and the tea looks lovely.  In a very busy part of town.  Bed v comfy. Best scrambled eggs and breakfast staff very accommodating. Poor value.",2,2023,06,25

203,"Excellent location, very nice hotel, noise issues specific to this stay","The location is great for access to all attractions in central Dublin.

The service from all staff members was excellent and personalized.

Jet lag severely impacted our stay.  Sleep patterns were way off and we did not experience many of the hotels' offerings like breakfast and afternoon tea.  Food and drinks that we did have were exceptional.

The tub/shower was very narrow and elevated, making access difficult or uncomfortable for people of large or short stature.

A local music festival nearby with load drumming until 2AM was the biggest issue during our stay.  We were not forewarned of it occurring, or we would have stayed out on the town instead of returning to the hotel and not being able to sleep.",4,2023,06,25
203,A fantastic afternoon tea experience in the westbury,"From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, everything was seamless. The staff here are extremely attentive and friendly.

They said they couldn‚Äôt give us any time to expect the room.  They would call us.  She told me the room was by the elevator,however,it was far from the elevator. The room had stains on the carpet and the wallpaper was tearing off.  The bathroom was terrible. Only one sink.  The sink stopper kept sticking and the water buildup.  There was only two small bottles of body wash.  The tub  was dangerous with a shower in it. There was no extra spray wand.  The phone didn‚Äôt work so we couldn‚Äôt call front desk.  The air conditioner didn‚Äôt work.  When I asked if we could change rooms even upgrade to a walk in shower, I was told there were no other rooms available.

The highlight of our trip was the afternoon tea service. The food and tea was EXCELLENT. Our server Marlene was really amazing and made the day so special. She heard we were there celebrating moms retirement and brought over a very thoughtful sweet to help her celebrate. This was our favorite day of the trip, in large part because of her service. A big thank you to Marlene and the Westbury staff. ",5,2023,06,05

203,Lovely hotel. Great location.,"Hotel was centrally located and the rooms were very nice. Comfortable beds and nice touches ( We had an upgrade and champagne in the room  on arrival) Staff were very pleasant with the exception of the check in where the lady was quite abrupt with us for some reason.
Afternoon tea was excellent. Great choice of sandwiches and cakes all very tasty.  All good so far.
The breakfast however was a disaster. First morning we had hard poached eggs ( myself and my wife ) after specifically requesting for runny or lightly poached eggs and then we waited 30 minutes for a coffee which didn't arrive so we gave up and left. The following morning you received wrong orders for our breakfast which we retuned then waited 20 minutes for our order to arrive. In all honesty we thought the hotel has understaffed te breakfast area. It was chaotic. Other people also received the wrong orders or were complaining. Not what we had expected for a 500 Euro per night room. 
We have stayed in other 5 star hotels around the world and I would have loved to give the Westbury a higher rating just for the general staff who were charming and friendly but it is sadly lacking.
Shame about the breakfast!      ",4,2023,05,22

203,My favorite hotel in Dublin by far.,"I'm an Irishman living abroad, and every time I come home I try my best to spend at least a couple of days at The Westbury.

This is a true 5 star hotel, with incredible attention to detail, beautifully appointed rooms, and fantastic staff/service from reception to concierge to housekeeping. The location is perfect.

203,3-star room at a 5-star price ,"What a disappointment. We stayed here last year and really loved it, but this time was a totally different experience. Our room was not nice at all - what looked like cigarette burns on the carpet and an absolutely filthy apolostered chair. I called the front desk and asked them to come and take a look, and while the guy who came was horrified and took photos and said he‚Äôd speak to his manager, we never heard anything back. The bed was lumpy as well and pillows flat. For what we paid, we could‚Äôve stayed at the Merrion, which is a true 5-star experience. We won‚Äôt be back. ",3,2023,05,10
203,Lovely,"We had such a lovely day at the westbury to celebrate a special family event, which was made all the more wonderful by Yunju who went out of her way to make us feel comfortable. We had 3 kids in our party and she was so kind to them and put us all at ease. Thank you! ",5,2023,05,08
203,Disappointing and Overrated,"The best things about the Westbury is it‚Äôs convenient location and generally very nice personnel.  Otherwise, it is very overpriced for what it offers .  The room was nice looking at first glance , but then the stains, scratches and generally tired appearance became obvious.  The hotel is in the midst of remodeling- but some of the new rooms still have some of the old worn furniture and vanities .  The breakfast was expensive and disappointing- the continental buffet was one of the worst( and most expensive ) I‚Äôve ever had , while my spouse‚Äôs ordered full Irish breakfast was mediocre and unappealing looking ( fortunately we later had ones that did honor to that name at other hotels ).  We were so disappointed with our room that we were promised a nicer , remodeled one on our return ( yes , we checked out several rooms with the receptionist) - but when we came back a few days later - it ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt 
available ‚Äúand had to settle for a ‚Äúremodeled ‚Äúroom that still had stains and nicks and looked too  ‚Äúlived in‚Äù .   We expected a great stay based on the rave reviews- but the Westbury is seriously overrated.",3,2023,05,07
203,Dublin Westbury ---World-Class Wow!,"Located in the center of Dublin, the Westbury has a lot to offer, just in location. Adjacent to Grafton Street, it is within walking distance to renowned area parks, sightseeing destinations, pubs, shops, churches, buskers,  and businesses. 
It is easy to access and navigate the property. but its superpower clearly is actually its staff and their collective ethos. Working with a very large group on property, I found the staff constanty smiling, helpful, and working together to meet any challenge or opportunity. 
From Eddie and the crew (John, Tommy, Kevin and all) that serve as Westbury bellstaff and conscierge-- mastering any influx of luggage, golf clubs, curious people, events guests, or people navigating their Westbury stay, they remain calm, helpful and masterful. Regardless of the challenge, they 'lean in to it' orchestrating motorcoach arrivals/departures, incredibly fast luggage movements to and from rooms while greeting everyone, and providng directions, parking assistance, etc. 
Restaurant  and event staff are attentive and polite, and the food is amazing (thank you Executive Chef Sandeep!) with prompt service and artistic presentation (Karl, Rory, Oisin, Florie, Stephen and Mary!). Beginning our days in the Wilde with a wide range of tradiitnoal and contemporary options was wonderful.
Rooms management (with a very large arrival group, coupled with departures from an absolutely full house) requires tight orchestration and communication (Stephen, Graham, daniel , Jack and everyone working the front desk)--and the Westbury did this superbly. 
Working within the Westbury for over a week and being able to witness the flexibility, adapatability, commitment, and extraordinary work---showed that their superpowers of energy, willingness to help, and professionalism--that are framed with smiles  and genuine commitment to team service delivery--by literally EVERYONE--waitstaff, housekeeping, business office, and the aforementioned departments, made for a truly remarkable stay at the Dublin Westbury! Whether you are a large incentive group or an individual visiting Dulbin for the first time--stay at the Westbury, you'll love it!!!",5,2023,05,04
203,"Lovely hotel. Fabulous staff,","Lovely hotel. Fabulous staff. Here‚Äôs a shout out to my favorite staff member at the front desk named Coner who was friendly, helpful and always willing to chat and take extra time with us!

Westbury is beautiful but typical to European hotels with small rooms, small bathrooms and lacks storage space. What is lacking in size, however, is made great with friendly, polite and exceptional service, lovely amenities and great housekeeping.

The Westbury is located in the heart of Dublin near Grafton Street and surrounded by wonderful restaurants, pubs and shops! Balfe‚Äôs, the hotels casual restaurant, had great food, craft cocktails and a lovely wine selection (for those who prefer it to beer). And, here‚Äôs a shout out to Isabella who was an exceptional server.

I would stay here again. Thank you for your lovely Irish ‚òòÔ∏è hospitality,",4,2023,05,04
203,"Stained carpets, frayed headboard‚Ä¶.. not 5*","Dirty carpets, frayed headboard & electrical outlet not working. This is not a 5* experience. This floor needs a major renovation. In the meantime, charging a 5* price for this quality is insulting.

203,Best afternoon tea.,"Visited for afternoon tea. It‚Äôs our favourite place for afternoon tea. The surrounds are beautiful, so comfortable and tasteful. The food is incredible- so varied and so many vibrant flavours. Coffee is delicious and we tried so many different types of tea.

203,Perfect night in The Gallery,I was lucky enough to spend several hours in The Gallery celebrating my sister and her fianc√©e over cocktails and some snacks. We were looked after so well by Saumu and Kim and some others who I (unfortunately) can‚Äôt remember the name of. Would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a relaxed but sophisticated environment for an evening spent with friends. I will definitely be back and can‚Äôt thank the wonderful staff enough.,5,2023,04,29
203,Disappointing stay,"We were excited to stay at The Westbury, but we had so many problems during our stay that I would never return nor recommend this hotel.

The primary issue centered around an issue with our room keys not working. This became quite the ordeal and after the 3rd set of keys not working we asked the front desk attendant to accompany us, and only then we could enter with their master key.

This would be the only way we could enter our room for the first 24 hours of our 48 hour stay (and often staff that tried to let us into our room forgot their master key‚Ä¶causing us to wait longer). They did apologize and explained the key card issue, but management continued to make missteps in how they handled it. It became a MAJOR inconvenience to our trip. After 24 hours I escalated my frustration and was offered 2 cocktails‚Ä¶which we then had to tell 3 staff members that it was free and finally get it taken off our final bill. A $25 compensation for a room that I was spending $500 a night to stay in‚Ä¶

There is poor communication among the staff and this operation is not well run. I would never stay here again. Too many other nice options in Dublin.",3,2023,04,28
203,Birthday bubbles in The Gallery,We really enjoyed going to the Gallery for a lovely birthday treat for our Mum. Saumu was our waitress and her service was excellent. Would highly recommend the Gallery for a special treat in a luxurious setting. ,5,2023,04,25
203,"Top notch hotel with great amenities, great service, great bar","I'm glad we opted to stay here instead of another local hotel where our group was staying. From the moment we checked in, it felt like home. We landed at 8am and weren't expecting our room to be ready but it was which is way ""above and beyond."" Our bags were brought right up (which we appreciated) and we were all checked in by 9am after an overnight flight. All the public spaces are great and it was easy to ask the front desk to print out some documents I needed.

The room itself is quaint but on the small side for the price and no view. I hate minibars with high prices which is annoying -but at least the boxed water was free. I did use the gym every day - it's outdated and could use new equipment and more room but now I'm being picky as I always use the hotel gyms. With a few updates this would be full 5 star but because the service was so good and. breakfast was AMAZING (and included) I opted to give it 5 stars. I love that all the special orders (even Irish breakfast) is included and the dining room is very nice. Location is GREAT - right off Grafton street, St. Stephens and the artist district in the other direction. We walked everywhere. All the doormen were SUPER helpful as well. Finally the sidecar bar is worth the trip - top notch cocktails and #1 bar in the city.",5,2023,04,24

203,Good but not great,"The hotel and location are wonderful. Lovely room and very close to everything. The service, however, was not what I would have expected. Upon arrival, we waited several hours to have our bags brought up to our room and eventually went and fetched them ourselves. We ordered room service one evening and were told it would be 20-40 minutes. The food arrived almost one and a half hours later.

Marta noticed the baby eating the raspberry‚Äôs from the top of the sweet treats and so unprompted came to the table with a small cup filled with raspberry‚Äôs.

203,Don't judge your residence by their appearance ,"Husband and I stayed at Westbury in February for business and pleasure because it landed on his birthday .
Checking in went smoothly,we went to our room. The room was okay, carpet stains,rips.Found a cork screw unden locker not a big deal, phone wasn't working and next day TV stopped working not the end of the world. The highlight of our stay was dinner in Wilde restaurant. The food was amazing along with good service from Alex . After dinner we went to the sidecar cocktail bar it was amazing My shaking martini was really well made in front of us .  Breakfast was lovely ,some staff could smile more but I understand it is hard sometimes. My biggest downfall was when we done with breakfast my husband back to the room to get his phone,so I took the seat outside the lift. 5 min later lady approached me asking if I am here for a job interview before that she asked receptionist who I am and same girl who checked us out didn't have idea it was myself 5 min after checking in out. It would be a privilege to work in Westbury but it really offended me that I don't look good enough to stay in this hotel because I am not dressed in Gucci and my bag is not a Prada . Never judge people by their appearance . And one last thing we almost drove home without our suitcases because the receptionist forgot to tell the concierge to collect our bags from the
 room. But the concierge handled it very well with a joke and smile  . Don't know if we will stay here again ..",4,2023,03,02

203,"Nice, comfortable hotel, in great location.","We took three rooms here  for four nights  recently.

Check in was efficient with friendly, smiling reception staff.

The rooms are quite well appointed with everything you would expect from a Five Star Hotel, well stocked mini bar, tea/coffee station, dressing gowns, iron, etc. 

Beds are very comfortable as are the pillows.

We were on the second floor and during the night at around 2am there was a lot of noise with guests coming in, banging doors which went on for quite a while, other than that, no problems with the rooms.

Breakfast consists of a hot menu and also a buffet table which  is very good with great quality Irish produce served by happy, professional staff who are very attentive to your every request.

The only downside was when we went to Balfe's, the restaurant that is part of the hotel.

We entered the restaurant from the hotel side at lunchtime on Saturday where we encountered a floor manager who saw us coming in but blanked me and walked straight past, so we stood there for a minute until he came back. I said , ""Is it possible to get a table please"" but he walked off again this time to speak to a couple who had come in from the street side and gave them a table.

I then asked for a table again and he pointed at a table for two , I said we were three people and he said ""No, we have none available"" and walked off!

Needless to say we never went back and went out with  Irish friends each evening for the rest of our stay.

Apart from this minor hiccup we enjoyed our stay at The Westbury.",4,2023,02,15
203,Excellent stay,"Check out the beautiful Sideway bar. The bartender Stefanie is very friendly and professional. She gave me good tips for cocktails and also for sightseeing.

203,Great stay.. breakfast staff need more training,"First time staying at the Westbury. Great service at check in ‚Ä¶ rooms very clean and comfy‚Ä¶ pillows very soft. 
Breakfast service ‚Ä¶ food was lovely‚Ä¶ staff seating you very rushed ‚Ä¶ telling you only have 1 hr to eat.. our server Lara needs more training on her manners‚Ä¶ very rude not only with us but the couple sat next to us. You shouldn‚Äôt expect this kind of attitude at this kind of hotel.",3,2023,02,05
203,Dissappointing,"The staff treat you like a nobody unless you show up in brands from head to toe. I was checking in late after an xhausting flight. The reception girls are completely lost and do not fit for a job. Took hours to find my properly done company reservation. The room is tiny and entirely run down, not clean, and you can hear how people next door are sneezing or even zipping their bags. On top of that elevator would occasionally work with your room key, and you would also smell cigarette smoke in the hallways. Additionally, hotel breakfast and dinner don't fit the minimum standards of when a 3-star hotel. Very overpriced bar lounge with waiters treating you rudely and ignoring you to discourage you from coming to the place. They need 15 minutes to ask for your order and 15 others to bring your drink. Absolutely ridiculous.  Very sad honestly. I'm not sure how this hotel stays in business, and I have no idea how it is a 5-star hotel.",1,2023,02,04

You're both an asset to the hotel and we will certainly be back for our next family celebration ! , ",5,2023,02,03
203,Badly in need of an update,"I can‚Äôt quite understand why the reviews here are all so positive. In fairness, the hotel is well located and the staff were all very helpful and friendly. The room, however, was badly in need of an update - stained carpets, limited plug sockets by the bed, light switches that did nothing, an 80s bathroom suite, no USB sockets, tatty furniture etc etc. There was also a LOT of noise from surrounding rooms at all hours of the day and night. And I know it‚Äôs a minor thing but why serve American-style thin and crispy bacon with an Irish breakfast?! I get that this is a grand dame of the city but for the money, I just couldn‚Äôt justify staying here again.",3,2023,01,31

203,Lovely experience,My friends and I had a lovely evening in the Gallery. The staff were pleasant in particular Miguel who was very helpful and attentive. Would recommend for a treat and comfortable catch up with friends.,5,2023,01,28
203,Excellent venue and staff,"Central location, staff, food, ambience, cleanliness and furnishings couldn't be better. Based on our communication with other guests we were just very unlucky to be allocated a room that had complex and inadequate bedside lighting with poor room card access problems. If we had been staying any longer than 2 nights we would have requested a room change.",4,2023,01,27
203,Ultimate Luxury,"One of the best Hotels in Dublin. Everything is always on point from right from the staff to the rooms. Every time you walk in the door you fell appreciated and welcome. The location is just brilliant, everything is walkable and right on your doorstep. The ambiance in the lounge and the bar is fantastic and the Sidecar bar experience not to be missed... especially for the bar staff!",5,2023,01,27
203,Ms. Smith,"Totally recommend the afternoon tea at the Westbury hotel. Miguel was our server, very attentive and welcoming, he looked after us well Great variety of sandwiches and cakes. Staff were very friendly and informative.",5,2023,01,25
203,Lifelong tradition,"Since we were very young we‚Äôve gone to afternoon tea at the westbury. Birthdays, Christmas, retirements and various other celebrations and milestones for our family over the years. It has maintained the same high standards of excellent food and especially service.  We had a fabulous day on Sunday to celebrate mams 70th. we were bowled over with Izz who looked after us the whole time.  He brought a little cake for mam with happy birthday written on it, and anything we asked for was no trouble to him. It was lovely to be so well cared for.   We loved every minute and already can‚Äôt wait for our next visit. Thanks Izz x",5,2023,01,25
203,Another 5 star stay,"A wonderful return stay at the Westbury. Myself and my husband recently returned from another fabulous stay, our room was ready early meaning we had plenty of time to explore the shops nearby. The food in Wilde was incredible, service perfect as always. The team at the hotel is second to none!",5,2023,01,25
203,Average,Disappointing considering we we‚Äôre returning guests and no valet parking and told no space left in carpark which was very difficult as one of our party has a disability (with blue badge which was ignored),3,2023,01,24
203,Brilliant Weekend Break,"Everything about our experience at the Westbury was gorgeous. From the moment you step through the doors, you are greeted with luxurious marble walls and decor that is at once elegant and playful- I was particularly fond of the charging bull statuette next to the concierge desk. We didn't get a chance to go to the brasserie, Balfes, but it looked charming. The first floor, however, is where the magic happens. From the fantastic portraiture, to the fresh flowers (which were labelled with their names, a wonderful touch to the guest without the gift of green thumbs), I was delighted by every corner of the hotel's buzzing centre. The suite in which we stayed was equally beautiful, boasting a tasteful art deco flair and a comfortable large bed. Even the lifts were gorgeous, fitted with a couch and uplifting jazz.

The real charm of this five-star hotel, it must be said, are the endlessly friendly and accommodating staff who work there. From Graham the receptionist, to the breakfast staff such as Matilde, to the hostess Aina and the knowledgeable bar staff like the enigmatic Osian, those who work at the Westbury are truly the cr√®me de la cr√®me. Above all, one of our waitresses at the Sidecar, Imogen, deserves a special mention as a wonderfully approachable and down-to-earth woman who took her time to remember our names and ask about our day.

I can't say I can remember ever having such a pleasurable experience at a hotel. I truly hope I can find the time to return soon.",5,2023,01,22
203,"We attended due to my granny‚Äôs birthday, and we shared 1 afternoon tea between us. We finished the afternoon tea with","Service was brilliant. Great atmosphere. Would definitely recommend.

203,Very Rowdy Hotel,"On Christmas Eve, The Gallery part of the hotel was full of drunk non-residents who were extremely rowdy and loud. Many of the residents complained but the staff did not do anything about it. Many of the residents actually left The Gallery due to the noise. Very disappointing and no sense of exclusivity for guests and residents. Why are drunken people invited into this hotel? ",4,2023,01,03

It‚Äôs a very old hotel with a lot of history . It is extremely well maintained and the staff are on point . If you go to Dublin I would highly recommend staying at this hotel. It is walking distance to everything , there is parking too if you have a vehicle . The only one tiny minor issue is the nav takes you to the side of the building that is not the entrance . You have to go down this narrow little street that seems almost like a sidewalk . It might take a minute to figure out but it‚Äôs no big deal really . I noticed the issue so I just wanted to give a heads up to anyone planning on staying here . The valet actually met us and drove us around the block to the entrance because I couldn‚Äôt find it ‚Ä¶..like I said , the staff is excellent üòú",5,2023,01,01

Our room was overlooking a side street and was clean and comfortable.
We had breakfast on the first two mornings at 10am and it was extremely busy, breakfast on the third morning at 9.15am was more relaxed and enjoyable. Good selection for breakfast and I really enjoyed the omelettes.

203,Lovely visit to The Westbury.,"Went with some friends during our visit to Dublin, the place and the food were amazing.

The service was carried on by Pedro, a lovely and careful waiter who looked after of every detail during the visit. ",5,2022,12,26

Our waiter Pedro was so attentive, he explained everything and went through each item on the menu.An excellent experience and will definitely be back ",5,2022,12,26
203,Perfect location; beautiful quaint property,"I‚Äôm so pleased we decided on the Westbury for our first trip to Dublin.  It is literally steps from Grafton Street and Trinity College, and if you are trying to get a flavor for Dublin, that‚Äôs the place to be.

The hotel itself is charming and beautiful - the kind of property that‚Äôs design suggests iconic status.  It‚Äôs busy and lively, but the staff were still helpful and made a great effort toward welcoming us.

The rooms were interesting - I felt like a giant using the sink, as it‚Äôs probably only three feet off the ground.  The hot water was also non-existent, which was obviously problematic.  Aside from that, however, it was a well-appointed room.  Probably not five-star, but decent enough.

Again, the location is perfect, the service is terrific, and if you can forgive a little on the rooms, the Westbury offers a five-star experience.",4,2022,12,25
203,The Westbury a Dublin Gem,WoW what an excellent experience in the Westbury. Fantastic staff and service. Kevin on the door was an absolute gent and full of information. Highly recommend. Location Cleanliness Staff Service top class.,5,2022,12,22

203,Disappointing stay,"Extremely disappointing weekend visit. Weekend away to celebrate 3 birthdays, 8 people in our party. 
Rooms very basic, beds were tiny, scuff marks on my bedroom wall and curtains came off the track when closed.
Limited toiletries in the rooms and a towel replacement was not offered for the second night stay.
As residents we were informed on both the Friday and Saturday afternoons that they were fully booked and no tables were available for tea/coffee in the afternoon.
Dinner was booked for 9pm on Saturday evening but we were not being seated until after 10pm and starters arrived approximately 10:45(so late to be eating). When food did arrive the turkey and sprouts were dry and overcooked.
There was a massive queue for breakfast on Sunday morning. The porridge which was ordered for some of our party arrived along with the cooked breakfast, which was returned while cereals were eaten. The eggs Benedict were cold and overcooked for at least two of our party. Finally at checkout I was asked for proof of payment for the room which astounded me. The receptionist stated that there had been a problem with their system the previous day and some payments were not taken.
This was such a disappointment as I have previously stayed here. 
I penned an email to the hotel with my feedback, no-one replied and I had to phone 4 times before I had the opportunity to speak to the Guest Relations Executive who simply apologised, said he would pass on the feedback and if I decided to revisit he would look at a preferential rate!! 
Disappointing stay and extremely disappointing customer care from a supposed five star hotel",2,2022,12,21
203,This is not just a hotel,"This is not just a hotel, its a tradtion,a memory and a feeling......Another amazing weekend spent in the westbury, its a Christmas tradition my friend and I look forward to every December, we visit the same weekend every year and this year was even more special as we stayed for 2 nights.

Thank you to all the amazing staff for been part of our Christmas tradition and memories. ",5,2022,12,19

203,Not sure how this is 5 star!,"No residents bar so bar closes early and told you had to get room service if you want another drink but we were with other residents that were friends so no use. Same happened with other guests. Penthouse guests came in and were served a drink immediately after we were told no!!
Next night had a much better experience in 4 star Titanic hotel Belfast where bar is open until 2am. For an expensive 5 star hotel this is not acceptable.",2,2022,12,10
203,Best Afternoon Tea in Dublin,"A fantastic Afternoon Tea experience with a friend. We've tried others but the Westbury has the edge, a blend of classic & modern with the best views in Dublin City centre.  The food was delicious & very fresh, especially the scones. The mulled wine elixir is such a treat, I've never tasted anything like it. The service is impeccable, attentive & friendly without being overbearing. Particular mention has to go to our server, Marta T, who was just so nice, professional & very helpful. There's a reason we return every Christmas, they just get it spot on here. ",5,2022,12,05

But but but, you want a good nights sleep and this was impossible. Neighbouring guests seemingly having parties,  heard another guest complaining about similar issues.

We are definitely coming back.",5,2022,11,16
203,Birthday  gift,As I was celebrating a big birthday my daughters booked dinner bed and breakfast at the Westbury. It was a fantastic experience the staff are amazing and could not be more helpful. The service and food in Wilde was fantastic. It was a really lovely evening I could not recommend the Westbury enough. Catherine B.,5,2022,11,15
203,Suite Night at The Westbury - Not SWEET at all!,"We booked a Luxury Studio Suite using the hotel's Suite Night offer, which included a bottle of champagne and the room. The offer was cheaper than just booking the room only.

Staying at the Westbury was a treat, and we stayed at The Hilton the previous night using points, so the 714.00 EUR for one night at the Westbury didn't feel too bad.

Firstly, the positives. The hotel is in a great location, and the front desk service was excellent. The service at The Sidecar and breakfast was also excellent.

Sadly, for the negatives. The Studio Suite was a decent size, and the bed was comfortable, but the room looked a bit tired and was not 100% clean. You would expect the room to be spotless for the price.

The Suite Night purchase included a bottle of Charles Heidsieck Champagne, and when we called room service for the bottle, it arrived warm! We had to request a cold bottle from room service.

Not the best experience at the Westbury, and we are unlikely to stay again in the future.",3,2022,11,14
203,The best afternoon tea we‚Äôve had!,"I took my mum to the Westbury for a birthday Afternoon Tea. We were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived. The dining area was warm, cosy and atmospheric, and we had a lovely table by a large window allowing us to look out over the street below. 

Our waiter was exceptional. He was incredibly friendly and attentive to our needs. The afternoon tea itself was delicious, and they allow you to swap out options if you so choose, as well as ask for additional things if you like something. 

Halfway through, our waiter also came over with 2 mini lemon cheesecakes and a chocolate plaque reading happy birthday as a gift for my mum, who was very touched at the gesture. 

Absolutely fantastic, and we wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to return.",5,2022,11,13
203,Vacation Dublin first time,This hotel made the trip a very good experience and added a good flavor to the end of this birthday trip.I will return to Dublin and this hotel when time permits. It is very centrally located in the city.,5,2022,11,12
203,Exceptional service,"Matilde and Megan provided us with outstanding and attentive service during our whole stay, they made our stay very special. Nothing was too much trouble.

Would wholly recommend for anyone thinking of visiting",5,2022,11,10
203,"Westbury Hotel, Dublin","Super stay.  Thoroughly recommend.  Perfect for visiting arts & history institutions, exhibitions etc and for shopping.  Food was delicious, both the Wilde restaurant & the Balfe bistro.  Breakfast perfect - good coffee, scrambled eggs + salmon was wonderful, and the muesli +fruit fresh and tasty. Esp the fruit - not cold, but still fresh, not fermented.  Lounge area - very welcoming, and it meant that our bedroom was just that - we basically had a huge yet at the same time intimate sitting room downstairs.  Bar great - noisy when wanted, quiet when needed, late at night.  Service - always excellent.  Staff were welcoming, attentive, above all human.  Barman - was asked for a Whisky Mac (we're Scots) - hadn't heard of it - he went away, researched it and produced a very fine WM. Negronis were superb.  ",5,2022,11,09
203,Amazing staff in the Gallery ,We went for 2 days in the Westbury and it was an amazing experience. We've been to the Gallery and Desiree welcome us and took great care of us! She make me feel special and was very friendly!  Thanks to all the team and see you soon! ,5,2022,11,06
203,Lovely afternoon  tea,Came here for afternoon  tea on a busy Saturday  afternoon. Setting was lovely. Staff were so friendly and accommodating.  Food was delicious. We were brought some extra sandwiches which were very much appreciated! Plenty of choice of teas and coffees. Afternoon was very relaxing. We were allowed chat and catch up without being rushed. Would highly recommend!!,5,2022,11,05
203,Luxury in Dublin,We had a fabulous stay here. Very posh. The room was a nice size and very quiet. The breakfast included each day was wonderful. Very close to a nice shopping area. We would recommend this hotel and would stay here again.,5,2022,11,05
203,"A relaxing, upmarket oasis in the city centre","A five star experience in the heart of Dublin. The staff are super friendly . The food is delicious , the ambience is of the utmost relaxation. All a stones‚Äôs throw from the shops, restaurants and a walk in Stephen‚Äôs Green to unwind! A relaxing stay from check in to departure .",5,2022,11,05
203,Great hotel in a friendly city!,We loved our stay here for a few nights exploring Dublin!  The staff were friendly and SO helpful in trying to make sure our wishes and interests were met.  The room was clean and comfortable (we always would prefer more hooks!).  The location of the hotel was perfect in the center of town.  The breakfast was delicious and included with our room rate.  The casual restaurant on the entry level had very good food and a nice patio to sit outside on.  Heads up - there is currently a building being built right across the entrance to the hotel so there is some construction noise throughout the day.,5,2022,11,02

This was the last of 5 hotels we chose to stay in including London, Edinburgh and another area of Dublin. I wish this had been the first stop because every hotel after would have been rated far superior. There were parts of our stay that were good (breakfast) but overall not a good experience. We were early checking in so they said they'd call us when the room was ready. We waited and waited and walked around the area for hours. I understand we could not check in early as they told us housekeeping was working on our room. Well, one party after another began arriving from about 2:30 p.m. on and they were given room keys. I went to front desk to inquire at 3:05p.m. and they needed to check. Staff called housekeeping and it would be 10 more minutes. We finally got to our room and what a disappointment. Old wallpaper, very small and outdated ammenities. We had requested a nice room but we had to move furniture to open our luggage. The way they continued to make us wait but checked in the people walking in after us made us think we must be getting a very nice room for the inconvenience. Did not hapoen. The Westbury was probably 5 star upon opening but not anymore. Location is good and there were some positives but negative didn't make up for those.",3,2022,11,02
203,Luxury that is comfortable and enjoyable,"This hotel is beautiful, in the middle of everything but so quiet with luxurious rooms and bedding that just help you feel great with your time with them!  The breakfast and restaurant is amazing and beautiful.  Everyone is very accommodating - from schedules to allergies.  I love this hotel - I saw it in my previous travels and so glad I remembered it and booked it for our girls trip!  Will always stay here in the future! ",5,2022,11,01
203,Concierge Experience,"The Westbury Hotel never fails to embrace you warmly from the minute you get through the circular doors; you feel nicely tucked away from the busy-ness of Grafton Street and beyond. 
Having attended a lunch there yesterday, I had cause to ask the Concierge to keep hold of a package for me and not even being a resident of the hotel, the concierge went above and beyond his call of duty to find a solution for what I required. 
To highlight the concierge in question, as I had asked for his name, is Thomas O'Connor.
Hopefully others will enjoy the same level of care and friendliness as I did yesterday. 
Many thanks to the team in The Westbury, Dublin.

203,Afternoon tea,"We had a wonderful day at The Westbury for afternoon tea. Jane looked after us so well, we couldn't fault the attentiveness of her service. The sandwiches, cakes and scones were delicious and presented so beautifully. The Irish whiskey tea was a favourite. Coffee was nice too, we enjoyed the lattes. We had plenty and were provided with gorgeous boxes to take home whatever we had left over. It is really a perfect day out for a special occasion.",5,2022,10,29

203,Great hotel in the heart of Temple District,"The staff is incredibly friendly and able to help with any anything you need. It‚Äôs just a short walk to any number of restaurants, bars, or attractions. The rooms are very spacious and well kept. Highly recommend. ",5,2022,10,23
203,5 Star perks and service MOST of the time...,"On the positive side: The beautiful 1st floor and the very well appointed room (including the bathroom) and I should mention that we had the most lovely view from our 3rd floor room looking out over the flags and directly down Chatham (?)..    I would also like to say that every staff member was accommodating and very pleasant.  On the not so positive side: The reason I would not more whole heartedly recommend The Westbury to others is that each day of our 3 night, 4 day stay we had to remind the staff to replace our tea cups, our room was not serviced until early afternoon, the phone did not work (it was replaced after we brought it to the attention of the front desk) the room service and front desk buttons, though marked on the phone, did not work and the light switches were a mystery -- each time we tried them they worked differently (ex. at times the bathroom light could be turned on by itself, other times the hall light had to be on first, or one switch would turn both lights on), the blow dryer provided in the room could not be plugged into the outlet in the bathroom and the kettle cord could not reach the outlet when set on the counter, we had to set it on the ottoman).  Finally, the  toilet recovered so slowly that we had to wait in between uses to flush the toilet a 2nd time) and on our final night we requested tea cups and none arrived...    ",4,2022,10,22
203,Perfect stay,"This hotel is lovely and accommodating and in the center of the shopping district in Dublin. Our first visit to this wonderful city and it was great.  Top notch hotel with great service and restaurants, the breakfast is great.  ",5,2022,10,21

203,Afternoon tea at The Gallery in the Westbury,"The food and atmosphere were great.  The staff, especially Marta and Giuliani made the whole thing a wonderful experience. My wife has been wanting a high tea experience and this fit the bill. It was definitely a once in a lifetime experience.",5,2022,10,17
203,Great experience,"We really enjoyed our trip to the Westbury last week. We were blown away by the ambiance, the staff and food were all lovely. We dined in the Gallery where we were welcomed warmly by the hostess Lauren and had a great experience overall with our service from Marta T! Will be recommending this place and plan to come back for the Afternoon Tea experience soon! ",5,2022,10,16
203,Pretty Awesome,"The Westbury is fantastic. It is a beautiful, attentive, friendly place to be if you find yourself in Dublin. I lost my virginTEA here and it was delightful. Everyone was was very kind. Marta T(ea?) in particular was fab and provided fantastic service. She was patient with my naiveTEA.

Can‚Äôt more highly recommend and thank you to everyone that made this a wonderful experience.",5,2022,10,15
203,Afternoon Tea at the Westbury was fantastic,"Had a fantastic experience at the Westbury in Dublin today. We were there for the Afternoon Tea. From start to finish it was great. Our server Louis was very knowledgeable, he answered all our questions and they had no problem making changes to the sandwich options. They sat us in a lovely spot by the window and the atmosphere was so relaxing. Would recommend this to everyone and we will definitely be back.",5,2022,10,13
203,"Gross, worn, dirty rooms. But central!","I have to say, the service here is top notch. Everyone from front desk to restaurant and housekeeping was very nice and accommodating. The restaurant was lovely and the breakfast food was exceptional. The location can't be beat, it's right in the middle of it all. But the rooms? Ick. Literally ick.

The visit started poorly when we were placed in a room directly across from the elevators. It was incredibly loud in our room and we could hear everything. We asked to be moved and they did move us to another more quiet room just down the hall. This is how I'm able to tell you that more than one room was dirty 

Both rooms were gross. Stained beige carpet‚Äîtruly a baffling carpet color choice for a hotel room. There was a faint urine smell at the corner of the second room by the chairs, worn walls and furniture. But the apex of the gross was when I discovered the crusty white stains on the blanket at the end of the bed (see pictures). We foumd this tossing the bed on the morning we left. I am so retroactively disgusted by this, knowing this was here the whole time. Ick. Just ick.",2,2022,10,12
203,Westbury a delightful experience,Vacation. Birthdays for my wife and me. The food was excellent and the service even better. We felt like very special people with each interaction of the staff at the Westbury. We traveled September 20-October 2. ,5,2022,10,10
203,Amazing experience,"I recently spent the night at the Westbury hotel and was blown away by the experience as a whole. It was so relaxing and enjoyable! 
From the moment we checked in and we‚Äôre greeted at the Reception by Graham,  to the service in The Gallery from Lauren and Marta T who looked after us very well. Can‚Äôt wait to come back again! 
Thank you",5,2022,10,09
203,Remarkable,"Quite frankly the most fantastic hotel and incredible service. 

Recently stayed in a party of 12. Beautiful Art Deco themed hotel with some of the most professional and attentive staff I‚Äôve ever witnessed. 

Nothing was too much for these guys, they  pulled out all the stops to ensure we had a wonderful time, made sure we had seating together available and made everyone feel really welcome. 

A huge shout to the young lady on the breakfast reception. I believe her name was Molly, service with a smile. 

If you‚Äôre visiting Dublin, book this hotel, fantastic location for site seeing and general retail therapy. 

Finally, cocktails in the side car bar of the hotel are sublime, a must even if you do not stop here. 

Well done to the management of this establishment, your staff are truly some of the best.",5,2022,10,09
203,Great location and enjoyable stay,"First time to Dublin and we chose the Westbury because of its location. Just off Grafton Street, it is within walking distance to key sights and the centre of town. 

We arrived late at night and unfortunately the entrance was unattended. With reception on the first floor, he had to carry our suitcases with us which wasn‚Äôt ideal.

We had a classic room which was a good size. The room does have a bathtub/shower combo which is something that some travellers may want to be aware of. To get a separate shower and bathtub you will need a suite or request an accessibility room. Either way, it is best to check with the hotel. 

The lounge is open for a lunch, afternoon tea, coffee and late night drinks. The hotel also has 2 restaurants. Wilde is the slightly more fancier of the two. The food was great and the staff were even better. Balfes is more casual though the food is still very nice and the staff maintain the professionalism expected at a 5 star hotel. 

An enjoyable stay and I would happily stay here again.",5,2022,10,08
203,Top notch,"This is what a 5 star hotel should be. Excellent experience all around. Prompt responsive service, clean and well appointed room, helpful staff. Breakfast offered a wide array of choices. Would absolutely return again.",5,2022,10,07
203,A Wonderful overnight treat,"Thanks to our wonderful family, we recently spent one night in this magnificent hotel in the heart of our great city. For foreign visitors, please know it is first class and near almost everything in lovely Dublin. As locals we have been here before many times for drinks, or dinner in Balfe‚Äôs and for functions but this was our first time to stay. It was a special occasion and the hotel did a number of lovely extras that added to our enjoyment.  The rooms are splendid and we were hugely impressed with all the staff. Reception, serving and concierge staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. 
Breakfast was a feast! The bed was very comfortable.
We want to single out ‚ÄúPolina‚Äù on reception, who was exceptional. Thank you.",5,2022,10,05
203,Balfe's Brunch,"I visited Balfe's bistro recently for brunch and it was a wonderful experience.  The food is amazing and the service is excellent. All the staff were incredibly warm and welcoming. Renato, in particular, was very kind to us and served us a gorgeous, signature cocktail following our meal. I look forward to returning soon.",5,2022,10,05
203,Dinner in Balfes,"Last week I was in Balfes for a gorgeous dinner with a group of friends. We were looked after by two lovely Italian waiters, Davide and Lorenzo.
For starter I had prawns, then salmon with mango sauce for dinner- both perfect. 
My friends were just as satisfied with their meals too.
We were blown away by the service- Lorenzo and Davide were so efficient and they couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. 
The Westbury is so central for a day of shopping on Grafton. 
Will definitely be back!",5,2022,10,03
203,An exceptional hotel experience.,"My Wife and I stayed at the Westbury in October 2022. We had heard of it‚Äôs reputation and so we were very much looking forward to our stay. It didn‚Äôt disappoint. The welcome was warm and friendly, the room was very nice and clean. Bed was also very comfortable. We had dinner in Wilde on the Saturday night where the food was exceptional. We will certainly be returning. ",5,2022,10,03

203,Amazing Afternoon Tea,Today was my 1st trip to the Westbury for afternoon tea for my friends 50th birthday. From the moment we sat down Felicia attended to all our needs telling us all about the different teas on offer plenty of refills.

203,Brunch in balfes,"Went out for lunch with my friends in Balfes and we were served by such a lovely woman Manuela. She was very kind and attentive.

203,Room in need of refurb,Three days in Dublin and stayed at the Westbury. The public rooms where excellent. We are in both restaurants and had drinks in the bar and lounge. Staff without exception were a credit to the hotel.The only disappointment was the room. Circ 1970 since last refurb. For the price charged not good value for such a room.,4,2022,09,28
203,"DEE-lish Tea, Porridge, and People-Watching!","As it was in May of this year, The Gallery is my favourite place to people-watch whilst savouring breakfast and brunch whist pondering the temptations of Grafton Street! Over several days in May, I was particularly struck by the warm welcome and professionalism of Marta, Louis, Kim, and Karin. This late-September day, Kim's taking great care of me, safely ensconced in my favourite window seat in the world. 

PS~Breakfast is never more delicious than with conversations intermittent and always kind ~ and porridge slathered with melting Irish butter!",5,2022,09,28
203,Westbury was average.,"On our last night of our trip I wanted to stay somewhere very nice in Dublin.   It was expensive when we booked it . We were unaware about the big football game in Dublin that night. Unfortunately we had been delayed by a bad accident coming into Dublin and the traffic was horrendous so we were late checking in . The hotel was packed with people for the game . The front  desk was very accommodating and our room was quite large. The furniture was a little outdated but the carpet had major stains on it which was disappointing for the price we paid. Bathroom was very small and only one person fit at a time . We had a couple problems with the room and they  sent up someone to help immediately.staff was courteous and helpful. The arranged for us to have dinner at Balfe and the pasta dinner was wonderful. Dessert was excellent as well and the portions large. Staff was very pleasant.
I felt the hotel was overpriced . We didn‚Äôt have time to explore the area which was disappointing.",4,2022,09,26
203,No place to get rid of the calories,"I am going to give this hotel a 4-star review. People are friendly and even offer an umbrella if you ever come to Dublin without one. The lobby is gorgeous, and the food here is excellent! I loved the breakfast, but more I loved the cake and champagne afternoon. The rooms are spacious, although the tube is a little bit high for someone with mobility issues. The GYM. however, does not match the rest of the spaces. Machines are broken, and equipment is super old. I bet the Titanic had a better gym.",4,2022,09,25
203,Convenient to downtown,"The hotel is located  in the centre of downtown. Very convenient to restaurants, shopping and tourist attractions. If you are driving it is not the easiest place to get to. The hotel is older and has a classic look.  The staff are fantastic and go out of the way to help you.  We had breakfast each morning and the selection and quality was great. Rooms are nice although there was a large stain on the carpet which surprised me for the room rate and the class of the hotel.",4,2022,09,24
203,Location can‚Äôt be beat!,"Great place to stay! The location can‚Äôt be beat. The rooms were comfy, the front facing views were really nice and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We didn‚Äôt book the room with breakfast included and instead opted to each at Balfes every day, which was excellent. We would stay here again.",5,2022,09,22
203,Perfection,"I can say nothing poor about this hotel. Everything from the moment we walked in, to the moment we left, was perfect. The hotel itself is gorgeous, and the staff extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms are very well-appointed. Breakfast was superb. The location is excellent, within easy walking distance to just about everything, yet the room was quiet. I would gladly stay here again.",5,2022,09,21
203,Afternoon Tea,Has afternoon tea with a friend a couple of weeks ago & Marta T looked after us so well. It was a wonderful experience all round. Food was lovely & their vegetarian options were great. We had a window seat so could people watch also!!,5,2022,09,21
203,Condones Sexual Harassment - AVOID!,"Bar - a clearly drunk customer was allowed behind the bar to intimidate a female member of staff while her male colleagues not only looked the other way but actively dismissed any concern when I complained. Front desk were similarly unhelpful. Clearly a toxic work environment.

Hotel itself is underwhelming. Has a big reputation but the rooms are pretty bog standard. Asked for a Queen - got two doubles instead. Not worth the money - Dublin has better options.",1,2022,09,21
203,Amazing One Night Getaway,"My girlfriend and I stayed for one night in the Westbury and were blown away by the friendlyness of the team there. Check in with Elizabeth was very smooth and professional and then up to our room which was very clean and comfortable. 

We had a drink in the Sidecar where we were looked after by Vittoria who made our night. She was so friendly and had both great menu knowledge and recommendations. After a very nice meal in Balfes, we decided to venture out into the city to visit a different bar but actually decided to return to the Sidecar because of the great experience we had had earlier. We were not disappointed! Thanks to Lee for the great cocktails.

Breakfast the next morning was in the lovely Wilde restaurant with a varied offering, staff were all very attentive.

All in all, an amazing stay elevated by the wonderful team at the Westbury. Looking forward to coming back again!

203,Not worth the money.,"Be warned, if you want a 5 star experience this is not the place.
 The price did not match the quality of the room or service we received. I was left very unimpressed and quite disappointed by the experience. Our room, had a very old musty smell. There was stains on the carpet and bedding. We couldn't use the air-conditioning out of fear, as the vents were covered in black mold. Breakfast options for gluten-free was poor. Nobody at check-out, asked if we enjoyed our stay (we didn't), or if there was any problems (there was). ",1,2022,09,14
203,"Dated decor, gym a disgrace. Terrible value.","Unfortunately not a good experience. Terrible value. Bathroom very dated. Damaged dark wood drawers, very old fixtures & fittings. Stained bath. The hotel fun was frankly a disgrace. Tiny room, no cleaning product out. Stained, dirty very old equipment. Looks like hadn‚Äôt been updated in 20 years. 
Wilde restaurant - lovely food but damp marks on ceiling & dust on the fake greenery. 
Communal areas of hotel otherwise were very nice.
Staff pleasant but concierge we‚Äôd had contact with in advance about a taxi booking. Told us they had no record of this. Eventually resolved but unnecessary faff. 
At over ‚Ç¨600 a night, I won‚Äôt be rushing back. 
At check out no one asked how our stay was‚Ä¶perhaps they didn‚Äôt want to know.",1,2022,09,11
203,Outstanding Service!,"We Stayed 3 nights  while we went to see Garth Brooks . The most outstanding feature of this hotel is the friendliness and the service from ALL its staff . I must Pay a particular mention to a fabulous girl from Clare named Hazel. She definitely went the extra mile in the restaurant to accommodate us . The food is fabulous in Wilde restaurant , the hotel is beautiful and The side car Bar , is top class . From the moment you arrive the welcome from the concierge straight through to reception, accommodation, bar and restaurant, all a 5 star service but in a very  warm and friendly way . Not thing is a problem. A shout out to the  lads getting our car , they were all fantastic. We will definitely stay again and I would highly recommend this hotel .",5,2022,09,11
203,Perfect Location,"The Westbury is a world class hotel located in the heart of the world class City of Dublin.  The staff are friendly and quick to assist with whatever your needs.  I was having issues booking tickets to the Guinness Storehouse and the concierge took over and book the tickets for me and my wife.  It was a simple thing to do but it went a long way in making our day less stressful.  

The location is perfect for walking to Grafton Street and all the shops and restaurants there.",5,2022,09,09
203,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"My sister brought me for Afternoon Tea in The Gallery at the Wesbury, and it was a wonderful experience. Highly recommend trying the sparkling teas!

203,Delicious food!,I had some food and drinks at the Westbury. The food was delicious and so was the atmosphere. The service was excellent with Alice. She was very friendly and great at her job. Highly recommend the hotel for food and a cuppa.,5,2022,09,07
203,Wonderful afternoon tea,Myself and my husband had a lovely afternoon tea here in August. Our waitress Sauru was very attentive and all the staff provided helpful recommendations. We are both vegetarian and were very impressed with the sandwich selection available. We were encouraged to stay as long as we like and overall felt we were looked after really well. We definitely will be back and would recommend afternoon tea here to everyone,5,2022,09,06
203,Drinks at The Gallery,We wanted to stay at the Westbury again but it was sold out for the big college football game so we stopped by for drinks at The Gallery instead. The service as always was top-notch and our server Felicia was outstanding. We'll absolutely be back.,5,2022,09,05
203,CLASS!,"This was the end point of an absolutely amazing 10 days in Donegal. This trip was booked for me from start to finish by an amazing guy, John Colclough of Britain and Ireland Observed. This hotel (though he says he had another one he wanted first) was AMAZING.  What a location! The heart of fun Dublin. It was also absolutely gorgeous and top shelf all the way! The restaurant, the bars, etc. Just lovely! The room was great, very comfy and I honestly could've stayed longer there. I highly recc this hotel if you are in Dublin!",5,2022,09,04
203,Outstanding Hotel,"Stayed at the Westbury for our ten year wedding anniversary. I was impressed from the minute we arrived until we left. The hotel is beautiful but what made it so special was the amazing staff. From the talented bar staff who made amazing cocktails , the hosts and the conceirge these people are the opitimy of professional. We were surprised to find a gesture left in our room due to our anniversary, these touches really added to our day. Thank you Westbury for allowing us to relax and feel spoiled, you are doing an amazing job. Can‚Äôt wait to return.",5,2022,09,04
203,Our stay in  Dublin,"Beautiful hotel in an excellent location. We were able to walk to excellent shops and restaurants. The room was very clean and comfortable. The food in the restaurants was very good as well. 
I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2022,09,03
203,Not 5-star standard - a very disappointed returning guest,"The overall quality of the room which was presented to us as an 'upgrade' was shabby and very disappointing for a '5 star' hotel charging over 400 euro per night. I am a Leading Hotels of the World Member and have stayed at the Westbury and other Doyle Collection hotels several times over the last decade - I have never seen a room like this on any other stay so can only assume I was 'lucky' enough to previously book a refurbished room which I took to be the standard, but it is clearly not. Even though we checked in at 5.30pm, our room had clearly just been 'cleaned' and a full tray of someone else's room service remains was left outside the door, with a large, dark wet stain on the carpet just inside the door which I only noticed when I stood on it with my bare foot. To think that the Westbury front desk would welcome us warmly (with me sharing that the occasion for our stay was a special night out in Dublin, 1 week before our wedding) and tell us that our room had been 'upgraded' - then send us to this room, was shocking to me. I called reception as soon as we arrived to request another room and to express my dissatisfaction. The receptionist offered to pass my complaint on to the guest relations team, but shared that only the 5th floor had been refurbished to the standard I had previously stayed in (my first stay was 10 years ago and last stay was 4+ years ago, so something must clearly be holding up the renovations of the rest of the floors), so moving us would not necessarily result in us getting a better room. At the time of us leaving for dinner, I had not been contacted by guest relations, so I mentioned same to reception on leaving for our evening out and shared with them a photo of the wet stain on our carpet - to be clear, while terrible, this was not my only cause of disappointment with our room. During dinner, I was called by one of the guest relations team (3+ hours after first checking in), who apologised profusely for the stain on the carpet and offered to move us to the 6th floor. When I questioned what the room standard difference would be if we agreed to that, I was advised that the room would be the same quality, it would just 'not have any stain on the floor.' I declined due to the inconvenience it would cause us to move late at night. The Westbury is a lovely place for a daytime visit for tea, drinks or lunch, but based on this I would not stay here again nor recommend it for the price.",2,2022,09,03
203,Stay at the Westbury in Dublin Aug 2022,"Beautiful hotel in the common areas, rooms are looking tired and starting to show their age, old key card technology, old bathroom fixtures, no stand alone showers, not entirely a 5 star experience. Staff was remarkable, polite, professional and attentive at every turn.",3,2022,08,28
203,Elegance without Pretension,"We are just back from a journey that took us around Scotland and culminated in Dublin.  Originally, the 4-night stay at the Westbury Dublin was planned as a way to rest up and perhaps see a bit of Dublin before our trip home.  We  had no idea that the Westbury, and Dublin as a whole, would blow us away.  Quite simply, this was a 5-star experience from the moment we checked in, until we sadly departed 5 days later.  

The Westbury Dublin is perfectly located in the downtown core of Dublin, a vibrant exciting city with something to offer for everyone.  You are within easy walking distance of Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green, Temple Bar district, etc.  There are fabulous restaurants and pubs everywhere- we had two amazing dinners at Sole and La Maison, both recommended by the helpful Westbury concierges.

The Westbury itself is a stunning property, with both formal and less formal dining options. The daily (included) breakfast was served each morning in the elegant Wilde dining room and we enjoyed great service from Fernando and Katie each morning.  Our other two dinners were enjoyed at Balfe, the more informal option.  

Our room at the Westbury was beautifully appointed with heated bathroom floors & towel rack, super fast internet, quiet A/C, and a really nice mattress.  As one other reviewer mentioned, not all the rooms have been renovated so definitely try for one that has.  

What really made this stay special was the staff.  Without exception, they are polished but super friendly.  Not sure how they select their staff, but please keep doing it.  

We did get out of Dublin for one day, taking a tour of the Wicklow Mountains with Hilltop Treks.  The countryside was just stunning and we enjoyed the day very much.

The icing on the cake is when flying to the US from Dublin, it is one of the few airports outside North America where you can clear US customs and Immigration in Dublin!  When you land in the US, no having to claim baggage and then recheck it, it's just like a domestic flight connection.

Dublin has become one of our favorite cities and the Westbury is the place for anyone looking for a truly exceptional experience! We can't wait to go back.",5,2022,08,27
203,Great dining experience,"The Gallery is always a great dining experience . Welcoming and friendly staff in very comfortable surroundings. The food is excellant . In particular, staff members Felicia and Marta provide superior customer service which is why it is our favorite restaurant.",5,2022,08,27
203,MrP Mooney+ Family,5* Hotel and deservedly so. Food and service in the ‚Äò Gallery ‚Äò was excellent. It was a special family occasion and we were made especially welcome. Seating comfortable and well spaced. We particularly mention Marta T and Felice. Could not ask for better hosts. Wholeheartedly recommend the Gallery for afternoon tea. Thanks Westbury.,5,2022,08,27
203,"Great location, average room",Hotel is located perfectly just off Grafton street near many fantastic restaurants and pubs; staff are very professional. Rooms need a refreshing. Breakfast was excellent. Check-in and check-out were excellent.  ,3,2022,08,26
203,Afternoon Tea at The Gallery,"This was my third time coming for afternoon tea in The Gallery and it was absolutely exceptional as always

My friend couldn‚Äôt come so I decided to go alone and I do not regret it one bit!

I was made few very welcome by all staff members but what made it truly special was the lady who served me

Marta T exceeded all expectations, as soon as she knew I was alone she kept coming over every once in a while to talk and make sure I was happy and attended to. I had a window seat and just watching the world go by while enjoying the most delicious food was amazing

My dietary requirements were acknowledged straight away and I was offered the option of trying different teas and coffees throughout

I have had afternoon tea in many different places and I cannot recommend the afternoon tea at The Westbury enough. It truly is magical and not something to be missed!",5,2022,08,22
203,Didn't want to leave!,"The customer service at the Westbury exceeded our expectations more than I can explain. Every staff member there went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. You are addressed by name and no ask is too much or a bother. The littlest details make a hug difference. The food is outstanding and the atmosphere is truly memorable. Make sure to have a drink in the Sidecar bar! I would like to make a special shout out to Imagen in the Sidecar and John and Derek at the concierge! Many thanks for making our stay so pleasant! 
Only thing to be aware of is some of the floors are not renovated. The rooms on these floors are not reflective of a 5 star hotel and do not reflect the hotel as a whole. Front reception however, happily changed us to a renovated room and once on the 5th floor, the experience was amazing!",5,2022,08,17
203,The Gallery !,"Afternoon Tea for two ! A great experience, staff were extremely attentive and ensured we had a really lovely time. They encouraged us to try different teas throughout our visit and the sandwiches and scones were just beautiful. The pastry selection was lovely, though as I have more a savoury tooth, I am no expert but my husband devoured most of them !! It is the perfect place to relax and people watch while Grafton St is a minute away ! We were given beautiful takeaway boxes to take home the remaining pastries and never felt rushed, just very well looked after in the beautiful oasis that is The Gallery at The Westbury ! A special mention has to go out to Alice - who is a huge asset to the hotel ! I would highly recommend the wonderful experience of Afternoon Tea at the Westbury !",5,2022,08,16
203,Heart of Dublin,"Excellent hotel and staff. Super clean, located steps from all the shopping, sites, and bars a visitor to Dublin could ask for. Breakfast to the room on two mornings arrived right on time, and dinner in the restaurant was great. Front desk staff made our dinner reservations for us.",5,2022,08,16
203,Afternoon Tea with friends,"My friends and I visited the Westbury for afternoon tea on Sunday and had a fantastic time. Special thanks to Alice and her colleagues Sauru and Luis who looked after us so well! Not only was the service amazing but the treats, sandwiches, scones and tea was to die for. We left feeling extremely content, would highly recommend afternoon tea at the Westbury for a relaxing Sunday afternoon treat!",5,2022,08,16
203,Lunch was lovely,I would like to thank the West bury hotel for brightening up my day. Frankie and I had a beautiful lunch served by  Hazel our waitress. Thank you Hazel! On your advice we visited the Guinness store and had a blast!  Lizzie x,5,2022,08,15
203,Afternoon Tea,"Had an amazing time at the afternoon tea! Highly recommend going, not only was the food amazing, the service was top notch ‚Äî Marta T went above and beyond to make sure we had an amazing experience! Will definitely be back!",5,2022,08,15
203,Best place to stay in Dublin,"We had two stays at the Westbury, at the beginning and end of our Ireland trip, and they were kind enough to store two pieces of luggage for us during the intervening week, which was much appreciated.  It is a lovely upscale hotel, in a perfect location (one cabbie said it‚Äôs the best located hotel in Dublin, which I think is true). Just a block off Grafton Street, there are lots of shops and restaurants within an easy walk, as well as many of the major tourist sites.  Service was excellent. When I requested a bag of ice for my knee, they cleverly packed it in a vacuum-seal bag which ensured no leakage.

We had the opportunity to compare two different room types. First we stayed in a luxury studio suite, and then in a deluxe king room. Both were great, in some ways I actually liked the smaller room better ‚Äì the suite had a step up from the entry hall to the living/sleeping area, and I worried that it could be hazardous getting up in the middle of the night (I positioned a chair almost blocking the way, to serve as a reminder.)  However, the deluxe king was a bit awkward when it came to drying hair, as the bedroom mirror had shelves in front of it. I liked the heated towel rack in the suite, and the separate walk-in shower in the deluxe king (we had a bath/shower combo in the suite, and the floor was a bit slippery, use caution!). I think that each room is unique, so others in the same category might be differently configured. Both rooms were comfortable and spacious. They did show a bit of wear (stained carpet and shower grout) but nothing major. Both were on upper floors, and we did not notice any street noise.",5,2022,08,14
203,Afternoon  tea,"First of all  thank you very much  The Gallery  team for the excellent service for my wife 's birthday   especially  felicia and we attended the afternoon tea.no words to express the happiness  and gratitude towards everyone.foods was very delicious  and there was no time delays at all.We wish u all the very best in their future days.
Thanks  to all 
Jackson  &Juley",5,2022,08,13
203,Absolutely amazing,We went to the gallery and sidecar for a few pre dinner drinks and couldn‚Äôt have been treated better. Big shoutout to Lee and Steph for their amazing company and recommendations they made us feel so welcome. Will definitely be back!,5,2022,08,11
203,Hospitality at its finest,"The best place in Dublin hands down. Fantastic welcome as usual, hats off to Tom, Eddie, John and ≈Åukasz. Lovely room overlooking Grafton Street, very comfortable  and well maintained.
Superb breakfast in Wilde, excellent service from Hazel. The location is the cherry on the cake .
Wish I could wake up here every morning!!
Thanks to all the staff and management, it‚Äôs an experience to stay here and the ethos obviously comes from the top down.",5,2022,08,11
203,Perfect afternoon tea.,"We recently visited the Westbury for Champagne Afternoon Tea as a birthday treat. From the moment we arrived The Westbury had a fabulous atmosphere and ambience. We requested a window seat and staff were very accommodating in giving us our window seat. We were well looked after by Martha who was extremely attentive, friendly and helpful. She definitely ensured we had the best afternoon tea experience. The afternoon tea was amazing and had vegetarian and vegan options along with a wide variety of ‚Äòsweet treats‚Äô.  Martha very kindly brought out mini apple crumbles as a birthday treat which we were delighted with.  I found it was very relaxing and ideal for a birthday treat. I am really looking forward to visiting again at Christmas and can‚Äôt thank you enough for how well looked at her we were, the staff especially Martha are an absolute credit to the Westbury! Thank you.",5,2022,08,10
203,"Afternoon Tea, cheap champagne shows margin being sought","Service and food quality excellent - Marta T was lovely and so helpful.

Afternoon Tea offered one champagne and it was cheap. Considering the charge was an extra ‚Ç¨18 per person it demonstrably shows the chasing of margin by the hotel. Disappointing given the image sought by and advertised by the Hotel.",3,2022,08,09
203,Excellent Staff - Great location,"Our room was lovely and bright and overlooked the road up to St Anne's which was very nice. The staff were amazing, friendly, eager to assist and we never felt rushed or like a burden with any request. 
The location was amazing - everything at our doorstep. Very easy to get around and find anything we needed.",5,2022,08,08
203,"The Gallery at the Westbury, Dublin","Had my Birthday Afternoon Tea here and Alice and Izz our waitresses were just Incredible!!! The service was so attentive and we had a lovely experience, the Ladies were so friendly and Alice really engaged with myself and my cousin throughout the whole tea...",5,2022,08,08
203,Overpriced but nice!,"I visited the Westbury with a friend for joint birthday celebrations on August 6th. We booked in for afternoon tea for two with champagne. The afternoon tea was lovely - the sandwiches tier was a little stingy in comparison to some other hotels I have had afternoon tea in however, our server, Marta T was extremely attentive and offered us more sandwiches which was a lovely touch. Again, she reminded us that we could choose from as many of the teas as possible and it was all included in the price so we were definitely impressed with this. The food itself was delicious and we were both extremely satisfied. The champagne was gorgeous too! Marta T also kept our tea topped up and ensured it was fresh and hot at all times. We also ordered a bottle of water which was ‚Ç¨6.50. This was a total rip off and I feel that even though a 5* hotel, they should just give out (or offer) tap water. Overall, the price was ‚Ç¨82 each which I did feel was extremely overpriced for what you got altogether. The service was 10/10 however and a special shout out to Marta T who really went above and beyond for us! Lovely for a girly day in Dublin but be prepared to stretch the purse strings if you visit the Westbury!",4,2022,08,08
203,The Gallery - lunch served by Alice,"We could not have chosen a better place to celebrate my parents wedding anniversary and my Birthday! Alice made this so special for us , she was so charming and so attentive to me and my family .  This is why we choose the Westbury , the service is unbeatable and the food to die for as always . Thank you Alice for making this a celebration to remember, you treated us like royalty !",5,2022,08,07
203,Fantastic stay,"What a great hotel - starting with a great location, inviting luxurious atmosphere, excellent staff, and beautiful rooms.  The check in process was efficient and we were greeted immediately by the lovely Elizabeth who explained everything.  Our luggage was already in our room when we entered.  Restaurant (Wilde) was excellent for dinner and breakfast  Love this hotel.",5,2022,08,07
203,Anniversary,Couldn‚Äôt rate the staff highly enough. They were so accommodating and we had the most special anniversary at the Westbury. Would come back every year if we could. The staff were very knowledgeable about both the food and the wine.,5,2022,08,07
203,Lovely common areas,"The common areas are lovely and the service in the dining restaurants was excellent.  I had cleanliness issues in my room, but they were quick to resolve the matter.  Room service food was also good but I received the wrong desert.  They corrected it straight away.  The room temperature needed to be monitored as the thermostat kept clicking off.
Overall a good experience.",4,2022,08,05
203,A delightful afternoon tea experience,"My wife and I have just enjoyed afternoon tea by the window at the Gallery, where Saumu was our wonderful waitress. Although not on the cocktail menu, they mixed a superb French 75 cocktail.  Highly recommend this as a special treat!",5,2022,08,05
203,Best Hotel in Dublin,"We arrived to the hotel by taxi from the airport and couldn't wait to get to the Westbury once again.  We were checked in by Elizabeth and got our room a little early.  It was a 5 night stay in a queen sized room and of course the location could be beat.  The bed was comfortable but we had some problems with the AC and so they switched our room and the AC worked better.  The breakfast at Wilde and lunch at Baffert is always a treat.  Every morning we had breakfast and were greeted by Valentina, who was very pleasant and was a great hostess.  Some of the staff there were Sylvana, Emily, Kay, and Amy,  They were always there asking us if they could help us,  They have a great staff there.  At the desk, Hannah and Laura were also very helpful.  In addition, the assistant manager (blonde young lady) was very helpful in switching our room but I missed getting her name.  She couldn't have been more helpful. We have been to the Westbury a few times and can tell you I'm already looking into our return there.  We have stayed at the Shelbourne and the Merrion before, but the Westbury in our opinion has the best location because you can go shopping without having to cross a street.  We love Grafton Street!  Overall, it was a great stay at the Westbury as usual and we can't wait until next year.",5,2022,08,03
203,Noise,Pygmalian niteclub is nearby.  They stay open until 3am most nights.  If you are on business or value your sleep then do not stay in this hotel.  This is clearly not a new problem.   It is unlikely to be resolved any time soon.   Yet the owners  continue to  charge guests 5 star prices for these  rooms that are unsuitable for sleep.,1,2022,08,03
203,Afternoon Tea Delight @ The Gallery,"My wife and I treated ourselves to champagne afternoon tea here last Saturday. We had a lovely relaxed afternoon, - and enjoyed delicious sandwiches and treats, all washed down with a selection of fine teas and a glass of champagne.

The staff were very attentive and clearly have a great team spirit, but our server Alice was the star of the show. Her warmth and personal touch shone through and she really made the difference.

We look forward to  returning soon.",4,2022,08,03
203,Business Trip,"Westbury - much better this time as room at the front so a lot quieter and the air con worked well. Didnt eat in the restaurants as though quite expensive, but I guess as it is a hotel. Lots of lovely places to eat outside of the hotel and it is in a very central position",4,2022,08,03
203,Gorgeous Hotel,"We weren't able to get into our rooms as we arrived early in the morning, but we were able to take advantage of their wonderful breakfast. I was very content just getting their continental breakfast and a pot of tea. The tea was fantastic- we got another pot later on, I tried the Moroccan mint tea- it was gorgeous. The rooms were very comfortable, and I appreciated the heavy curtains so we could take a quick nap in the afternoon. The location was great, we were able to walk to a number of sites, and the restaurants at or near the hotel, were fantastic- I did not want to leave!",5,2022,08,02
203,The Gallery,We were booked for champagne afternoon tea and boy did it live up to its reputation. The moment we came in the welcome from staff was so warm and could not be anymore accommodating. In particular Felicia ensured that are glasses were refilled offered choices and teas coffees replenished. Definitely a return visit is on the agenda,5,2022,08,02
203,Afternoon tea,Had the most wonderful experience celebrating my mums special birthday. We were shown to our table by the lovely Rory and looked after so well throughout our stay by Felicia. Nothing was too much and the staff were so personable. The afternoon tea was exquisite and we were offered top ups of anything we liked. The range of beverages on offer was fabulous. We were so lucky to be seated beside a window also. A truly fabulous time and can‚Äôt wait to come back. The race will be on for Christmas bookings!!,5,2022,08,02
203,Stunning Room & Excellent Customer Service,"Had a stunning stay in The Westbury earlier this month. The room was gorgeous and the bed was so comfy. 

Concierge and reception were very friendly - John and Eddie are gems! 

Lee at The Sidecar bar was also very helpful and friendly.",5,2022,07,30
203,Westbury‚Äôs location is unbeatable.,"The Westbury‚Äôs location right off Grafton street makes it a fantastic place to stay, not to mention the elegant hotel, extremely friendly staff and fantastic afternoon tea. The room was very nice and the classy.
",5,2022,07,29
203,Good hotel but prefer the Merrion Hotel,"This is a 5 star hotel but if you are going to spend the money, I would recommend the Merrion Hotel in Dublin. 

The rooms are nice but dated but most importantly, the service is lacking. After we took a 10 hr flight from the US, we tried to check in at 3:05pm (check in is at 3pm!). The receptionist was rude and unfriendly. She then stated ""Check in is FROM 3pm"". I then commented that at the hotel price, I would expect to be able to check in on time. After a bit of reluctance, we were checked in at 3:20pm.  
My biggest complaint is that throughout our stay, no one ever inquired how we were doing or how our stay was. We were ignored upon entry and exit of the hotel. The rooms are not updated. I would recommend the Merrion Hotel. The rooms are updated and gorgeous and the service is impeccable.",3,2022,07,26
203,Excelente servicio,"I went to the Westbury hotel on Friday afternoon to have some drinks and appetizer and we received an excellent service. Desiree was our waitress and she did an amazing job, she recommended us what to order and everything was perfect. I would recommend this hotel to all my friends and people who ask me for a nice and peaceful place to relax.",5,2022,07,25
203,Excellent Afternoon Tea experience,The Afternoon the  experience at The Galley at the Westbury hotel in Dublin was great. We had an unforgettable experience. Especially thanks for excellent service by Izz and Marta T. We all liked the huge Tea selections and options to select several drinks as included in the package.,5,2022,07,25
203,Fantastic afternoon tea,"I brought my mother here for her birthday to indulge in afternoon tea. I had requested a seat by the window and while we were initially shown to a table in the middle of the room, our server did manage to get us a table with a view, which was very much appreciated. Alice, our waitress, was incredibly attentive, efficient and entertaining. She was also great with recommendations of different teas, and really made the overall experience relaxing and special. I would say the sandwiches ‚Äì while perfectly fine here ‚Äì are probably better in the Shelbourne or Merrion's afternoon tea, but the mini desserts in The Westbury are really delicious. I would certainly recommend.",5,2022,07,25
203,Excellent stay,"The hotel looked after us so well. The staff were very helpful, lovely breakfast and a great atmosphere in the lobby. Nothing was ever a problem. The bed was super comfortable and the hotel was spotless. ",5,2022,07,25
203,2 Nights in Dublin,"Driving over to Dublin catching the ferry, we arrived at the Westbury around about 6 o‚Äôclock in the evening. The actual entrance is a little restrictive to approach due to it being on a pedestrianised thoroughfare. It is times like these when you really do miss trust your satnav. Once outside the hotel the valet unloaded the car and parked the car in the hotel car park. The cost of parking at the hotel is ‚Ç¨25 a night however you can park cheaper at the Q Park at Saint Stephen‚Äôs Green which is only two roads away about 100 yards walk.

The foyer and entrance is very luxurious with galleried steps and lifts to the upper landing. Upon checking in we were allocated to our rooms and the valets brought our luggage to the room. The lower level contains Balfes brasserie and the concierge, The first floor is Wildes restaurant, reception and toilets and lift access. Breakfast is served in the Wildes restaurant. The Wildes restaurant overlooks Harry‚Äôs St with views of Bruxelles, a bar home to the likes of Phil Lynot of Thin Lizzy, with a statue dedicated to him.

The Wildes Restaurant menu choices (can be found online) have a limited range, however was excellently presented and tasted perfect. The Scallops were perfect, the warning of the ‚Äúhot plate‚Äô was well advised as it was blisteringly hot.

Balfes Brasseries has a more Mediterranean bias menu (can also be found online) the linguine was excellent, spicy and the haddock very well presented.

I suppose the pricing of the meals reflect the hotel, however in comparison we ate in Pink on William St, for one meal and the Atlantic Hake served was in my opinion far surpassed the quality of any food at the Westbury and at half the cost. One could argue, the setting, the hotel the service etc. yes, you could argue. Yes it‚Äôs nice, at a price.

The rooms are excellent, with housekeeping a little slow, this could be forgiven, as we later learned that we had coincided with a visiting group of 200, so hats off, we were not that put out. Complimentary water, coffee, tea etc. on call if running low for top up. Nice sized en-suite with decent sized mirrors. Missing a full length in the room or the ability to step back from any mirror, as an observation.

Overall and excellent stay, yes it‚Äôs an expensive hotel, but it was a special occasion. I believe that is how some people may justify some of the costs associated with it.

So why not 5, here‚Äôs the rub. I contacted the hotel twice via telephone, once prior to my arrival to arrange meal bookings, only to arrive to find they hadn‚Äôt been arrange. It was sorted on the evening, but that could have gone so wrong‚Ä¶.

Secondly, on checking out I left a charger and cable in the room, I remembered 2 hours later, when I rang the hotel, as I had travelled north to Derry.  ‚ÄòNo problems - We‚Äôll keep it for you‚Äù great, I‚Äôm back in Dublin Thursday, I‚Äôll collect - Thursday, nothing found, nothing in the room. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm gonna do 380 mile round trip to try con them out of a charger. They have some housekeeping integrity issue. The person on reception was helpful but apologetic. 

It‚Äôs a nice place though :)",4,2022,07,20
203,Excellent and friendly service,"We recently enjoyed several nights at the Westbury.  After a long journey we were delighted by the friendly welcome of the porters and car valets.  A true Irish welcome!  In no time they had taken our luggage up to our room and parked our car.  All hotel staff exceptionally helpful and we very much enjoyed our stay, taking advantage of meals in the hotel on several occasions. Breakfast was superb with a very wide choice. The Westbury is in a superb location and walking distance from everything in the town. We went to see Riverdance at the Gaety Theatre which is a mere five minutes' walk - this is an absolute MUST!",5,2022,07,20
203,Afternoon Tea,"What a beautiful experience enhanced greatly by the fabulous service we received from Martha T. The Westbury are lucky to have her, professional, friendly and accommodating. She would make me want to come back. Beautiful food as well and very well presented.",5,2022,07,16
203,Our server was amazing!,"My friends and I got afternoon tea at the Westbury. Our server Saumu was lovely! She was incredibly kind and went above and beyond to make our experience incredible. She went out of her way to take photos of our group. Then one of our friends received some sad family news mid-tea, and Saumu brought over complimentary desserts with a smiley face on them. At the end, we forgot to take our leftovers with us, and she ran around the hotel looking for us so we didn‚Äôt leave without them! Everyone book tea at the hotel & ask for Saumu!",5,2022,07,16
203,Afternoon tea,"Sissi took great care of us, we had a fantastic afternoon. We went for the champagne tea and everything was beautiful and delicious, the service is exceptional and we were well looked after. Thanks again",5,2022,07,16

203,Afternoon Tea for Two,"My friend and I celebrated our birthdays with afternoon tea at The Gallery. Every request that we made was met and our server, called Felicia was wonderful. She was so attentive but in no way intrusive and she went above and beyond for us. 
It was a most enjoyable experience and thank you Felicia for our lovely chat!",5,2022,07,15

The room was gorgeous, we stayed in a super king
Breakfast the next morning was lovely, plenty of choice and beautiful surroundings
",4,2022,07,14
203,Just OK - would be fine if it was a 3 star but not really good enough for what it is,"I wanted to love this hotel but just could not. It was not bad, but I really would not stay there again.

We received an absolute barrage of automated emails from the hotel in the week before our stay.  First we were told that we had to check in on line (even though they already had my credit card on file.) When I did this several days before we arrived, it charged for our full stay before we ever arrived - a bit discount hotel feel here. Then I got another automated email that they wanted to charge Euro 200 per night for incidentals during our stay - again that was charged. Then I got an email saying that we had to book all of our meals on line - even breakfast. That was an absolute pain - you had to go online and enter all your personal information for every single breakfast reservation as if you were not staying at the hotel. They then sent confirmation emails for each individual breakfast reservation and YOU HAD TO CONFIRM THAT BACK TO THEM.  Please understand that we were travelling in France and Portugal while all this barrage of emails was taking place. It was really not a first class hotel experience.  At other hotels, you are asked to let them know in an email what reservations you would like and they take care of the rest, but at the Westbury, it really feels like a self-service environment.

This hotel is in a fabulous location right in the centre of Dublin's best shops etc. Hotel is fine but at almost Euro 500 per night it could do with improvement.  People who live in Dublin (i.e. my family) love the place and do not want to hear a word said against it. When we arrived there was no doorman outside.  It might seem like a little thing but when you are in the city centre you cannot just leave your bags outside - your stuff will disappear.  In the absence of a doorman, we rolled our single suitcase inside and could not figure out what to do next.  We did not know it but reception is one level above ground up a flight of stairs and you cannot use the elevator to get up there without a keycard .....which you do not get until after check in.  After about five minutes of wandering around a doorman finally showed up and let us into the elevator to go to the reception area.  (When we were leaving the hotel for dinner that evening, we saw a poor guy getting out of his taxi with golf clubs and multiple bags and again.....no doorman...he was really frustrated.) Check in was very pleasant.  Our room was fine - quite small but fine for a short stay.  As noted by other guests, the carpets etc. were heavily stained but the bed linens and towels were high quality and room was comfortable. Bathroom was however very dark (hard to put make up on.) Also, the liner inserts in the bathroom drawers were very very stained and dirty - a pretty easy fix for housekeeping. The glass on the wood shelves in the bathroom also seemed to have an inordinate amount of dust trapped under them to the extent that they looked dirty however if you ran your finger over the glass you could see that there was no dust on top of the glass, it was all underneath.  A good proper clean of the bathroom would have made a big difference.  There was a filthy dirty dusting cloth on a shelf in the wardrobe. My husband left it out in the corridor outside our room.

Every staff member we encountered was very pleasant.

Housekeeping missed us on turn down service on one night of our three night stay - since we had showered before going out that night and did not get back to the hotel until about 2am, we then had to hang up our wet towels to reuse them early the next morning.

Breakfast was fine. The location is really lovely however the food was not great.  I ordered the eggs benedict the first morning and asked for soft eggs. When it arrived, it was obvious that the eggs had been made quite a while ago and were probably sitting on a heater. They were sitting on a stale english muffin (probably freshly cut a couple of hours previously and  not been toasted.) The hollandaise sauce was very nice but there was absolutely nothing else on the plate - no fruit, potatoes etc. There was buffet area so I guess we could have gone to look there but we were really trying to limit our opportunity to pick up covid. My husbands Irish breakfast was similarly uninspired. The second day, I just had some fruit. The third day we simply skipped breakfast as it was just not appetizing.  We had lunch one day with my parents in Balfes  a french bistro style restaurant in the hotel.  The food there was very good. My husband and I chose one of the ""healthy"" options that I think was meant to come in at about five or six hundred calories - when our wraps came though they were oozing with cheeze and avocado - given we are fair weather healthy eaters, we had a good chuckle about it but for people who really did want a low calorie option this might have been a problem. Anyway, the service and food was very nice and we had a lovely relaxing lunch.

If you are just looking for location, then this is a good hotel to stay in. It is not however a five star experience no matter how nice the people who work there are.",3,2022,07,12
203,Afternoon Tea,"The whole afternoon experience was delightful. The food was amazing and delicious. Marta T. And Mariam from the service team were both amazing (Marta T. gave me freebiesüòâ) ,very professional and accomodating as well. Highly recommended",5,2022,07,12
203,Sidecar:Juan the Master Mixologist &Multi Diverse Marta T.,"Although we stayed at another 5*****, we heard the Sidecar at the Westbury Hotel was spacious &  beautiful. Comfortable seating,  cozy coffee tables, a very special cocktail menu and 2 people who are gifts to the Westbury, Marta T.  seated us near a window so we could overlook Grafton St., watch the clouds, that looked like nebulous ghosts,  allowing the sun to weave  in and out and asked us, ""How can I make you happy?"" What an introduction with an appetizer menu & a beverage menu. We are seasoned martini drinkers. We will not have a martini if it is not in a REAL martini glasses.
               The long stem controls the temperature, because drinks served in this glass will not have ice. One can hold the stem rather than warming up the v-shaped  cone 
or chilling one'e hand. Moreover,the cone shape keeps the ingredients pushed together, and provides a nice large surface area for aroma. Utilitarian art deco!

             After explaining that to her she understood, totally and sent Mixologist Juan who was from Cordova, Spain and as handsome  and congenial as she was beautiful and caring to create joy for us. He discussed the best gins & vodkas for our martiinis  & carved  beautiful , thick lemon twists. She recommended an appetizer that was  delectble transcending anything else we saw on the menu.

 Thank  you Marta & Juan. The Westbury is fortunate to have you.",5,2022,07,11
203,Wonderful birthday lunch in The Gallery,"My friend and I arrange an annual birthday celebration and we had our best one yet in The Gallery at The Westbury. It was an oasis of luxury in Dublin City Centre where we could relax, chat and still get a sense of the bustle in the city as we had one of the much prized window tables. I have always loved The Gallery for a coffee and catch up with friends, but this visit was made extra special by Alice, who took extra special care of us. Thank you Alice and The Westbury!",5,2022,07,10
203,When in Dublin always stay at the Westbury,I can‚Äôt rave enough about the Westbury and the wonderful stay my family and I had there. The hotel is beautiful and all the fresh flowers smell so divine. The real icing on the cake is the staff they are the best hands down staff ever! They make you feel like your home and anticipate every need. They are truly wonderful and made our stay perfect. The breakfast was one of the best I‚Äôve had. If you‚Äôre in Dublin don‚Äôt stay anywhere else but the Westbury. You will be so well taken care of that you won‚Äôt want to leave. Thank you Westbury staff for taking such good care of me and my family. You all are the best!,5,2022,07,09
203,AFTERNOON TEA LOVELY EXPERIENCE,"My friend & I had a lovely experience in Westbury. She was marking her 80th birthday. Staff were discrete & very well trained. Sandwiches, scones & sweets were very tasty and beautifully presented on delicate china. Staff very attentive but not in a smothering way. Two hours is sufficient time as it is a very efficient service and foods arrive quickly to table. Lovely experience for a special occasion.",5,2022,07,09
203,"Great location, comfortable rooms!","We spent 4 nights at The Westbury in a spacious room with a seating area and well appointed bathroom. The bed was most comfortable, the mail service efficient, and we were very well taken care of. We also enjoyed several drinks and a light lunch in the elegant hotel lounge.  Great location for walking, shopping (if that's your thing!), and dining.",5,2022,07,09
203,Afternoon tea,I‚Äôve been lucky enough to attend here a few times for afternoon tea and once for an overnight start. By far the best afternoon tea and service I‚Äôve had in any hotel. Cheerful staff and nothing is too much. Beautiful sandwiches and cakes. My nephew asked for a club sandwich and it was no problem even though we were booked in for afternoon tea. They made a big effort for my mother for her 60th with a personalised dessert. I just had a baby and they made sure I had plenty of room for the pram and feeding. We will be making it a family tradition to attend afternoon tea here every Christmas.,5,2022,07,08
203,amazing experience,Visited the gallery in the westbury for a few afternoon drinks to celebrate a birthday. The cocktails were phenomenal (would highly recommend the pineapple lady) and overall the experience was great and the atmosphere was lovely. The staff were amazing especially our server Desire who was extremely friendly and attentive to me and my mother. Would also like to thank the staff for gifting me with a complimentary dessert upon learning it was my birthday. Will be back again soon would recommend for any special occasion where you want a nice special experience in Dublin.,5,2022,07,07
203,Amazing location very elegant accommodation!,Gorgeous and feels posh!  My sister and I 4 nights at this wonderful hotel and loved it!  It's location was perfect with dining and pubs merely steps away.  You honestly don't have to leave the hotel to enjoy amazing food (Wilde and Balfes) and a cozy bar!  The only thing I have to say that might be considered negative:  if you have traveled the red-eye and hope to get into your room in the morning: don't plan on it.  Plan on staying awake until mid to late afternoon.   Your luggage can remain with the hotel while you walk about Dublin.,4,2022,07,07
203,Second Stay Here,Fantastic Hotel in the heart of Dublin. Must have Afternoon tea there. Service was fantastic. Also enjoyed wonderful appetizers with a good friend in The Gallery. Our server Mirian and team took great care of us. Look forward to staying again our next time in town!,5,2022,07,06
203,Wonderful Afternoon Tea with All the Trimmings,We booked for afternoon tea on Sunday July 3rd. What a wonderful experience in a very classic setting.

203,Marking our first month as newlyweds. ü•∞,"My husband and I had a wonderful Afternoon tea experience on Thursday the 29th marking our first month as newlyweds. Our servers Felicia and Mirian were extremely friendly and attentive and made the experience very special. Kim who was also working on the day was very friendly and was very professional in greeting other guests around us. Looking forward to booking again soon. üòÑ 

We would also like to say Thank You to the gentleman who was at the table next to us who sent champagne to our table to congratulate us when he was leaving. Unfortunately we only have his first name. So, if you ever see this, THANK YOU CONOR. üôÇ

203,A gorgeous afternoon tea,"My friend and I had afternoon tea in the gallery and we had a really lovely experience. The food was beautifully presented and delicious, and the atmosphere was very relaxed and enjoyable. However, the service was the main selling point of our afternoon from our waitress, Felicia. She was an absolute joy and suggested lovely pairings for our dining experience and went above and beyond to make us as comfortable and well fed as possible. Truly the best service I have experienced in years. Thank you for making the occasion so special!",5,2022,07,03
203,Weakened away!,My son treated me and my friends to a lovely weekend in Dublin where we stayed at the Westbury. The rooms are fabulous! Extremely comfortable bedding and a beautiful view of a bustling Grafton and St Anne street.  We dined at the hotel for breakfast each morning and on our second night. The food was divine and the atmosphere matched it. A beautiful hotel with very friendly staff and perfect location!,5,2022,07,03
203,10/10,"Beautiful meal at Wilde, food was excellent, and service by Alexander Clarke was outstanding.
Celebrating my parents 25th wedding anniversary was made incredibly special by the lovely food and efficient service by all.",5,2022,07,01

203,Recommend ‚Ä¶. Treat yourself !,"Amazing food, atmosphere and service. Highly recommend. We were here for our wedding anniversary meal and we were treated so well. We will definitely be back. This review requires 200 words so I‚Äôm going to fill up the rest with some random words",5,2022,07,01
203,High Tea at the Westbury is Highly Enjoyed,"Our sister trip started with a high tea in Waterford and ended with a high tea in Dublin. 

By far the service and setting at the Westbury was our favorite. 

The opportunity to select from coffee,tea, hot cocoa, and chillers made the experience so decadent.  Let‚Äôs not forget the bubbles, a fine sparkling rose was the perfect touch. 

The treats were sumptuous and hearty, in fact we skipped dinner after because we were filled to the brim. 

Alice was our server and went above and beyond to help ensure we had a delightful time. 

I would recommend The Westbury to anyone seeking the quintessential tea experience.",5,2022,07,01
203,Fantastic Stay at Dublin‚Äôs Westbury,"Our family , two adult daughters , my husband and myself recently vacationed in Ireland and began our trip in Dublin at the Westbury . We were never so satisfied with the service , staff and accommodations. We had breakfast daily and Marta T was our server . She always greeted us with a smile and made us feel special . She was very polite , friendly and professional. It was obvious she took her occupation seriously and did her very best to please us . The concierge services were superb , arranging rental car pick up at the hotel , taxi service , recommendations for site seeing and assisting in any way they could . We felt very much welcomed by the staff at the Westbury Hotel and all the people of Ireland we had the pleasure to meet! Can‚Äôt wait to go back !",5,2022,07,01
203,"Magnificent stay, and fantastic afternoon tea service.","Gorgeous accommodations, and a lovely professional staff.  We particularly enjoyed the afternoon tea - our server Desire took fantastic care of us and was delightful and charming to boot.  Delicious sandwiches and pastries and a wide selection of teas.  A    must do experience on your vacation!",5,2022,06,30
203,Afternoon Tea,"I‚Äôve gone to several places for afternoon tea and this place had amazing food and tea selection. However, my favorite part was the great service we received. Alice, was our waitress and she was outstanding! She definitely made this a wonderful tea experience.",5,2022,06,29
203,5 star service,"We received a birthday present for afternoon tea for two in the Westbury and I didn‚Äôt know what to expect. I have to say from the minute we entered until we left I received the best service I have ever experienced especially from our main server Desire. The food served was first class and I‚Äôve never seen such a selection of teas and coffees. While on the face of it it may seem expensive the quality and quantity of what you receive makes it quite good value. Would definitely recommend everyone tries this at least once, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.",5,2022,06,27
203,Fantastic Afternoon Tea,Wonderful service from Felicia. Very attentive and accommodated all of our dietary needs with loads of options and triple checking we were happy. Lovely food and just the right amount to avoid the Irish man going home hungry without enough sambos,5,2022,06,27
203,Stay in the Westbury/dinner in Wilde,"Stayed in the Westbury as a treat. Lovely meal in Wilde and we were really well looked after by the excellent Alexander Clarke, our waiter for the evening. Would definitely recommend for an overnight or just for dinner.",5,2022,06,27
203,Much improved visit,"I visited towards the end of 2021 and wrote a less than favourable review. Our room was not up to standard at that time. On this visit we were in a mini suite with 4 poster bed and our experience was completely different. Front desk staff particularly Laura were friendly and efficient. The hotel was full and lots of visiting American tourists but they only added to the buzzy vibe. The last time I visited  was at the end of Covid which I realise now effected my experience greatly. Things like reduced soft furnishings and toiletries given to you in a bag all detracted from my experience at that time. All that is gone. Fabulous toiletries. Turndown returned which adds to the 5 star experience. Location is second to none, in the centre of the city. Breakfast excellent. I did not get an opportunity to have a look at the standard room on this visit and cannot comment on them. We were disappointed with our room on last visit and hope that things have improved there. Overall this visit was everything I had hoped for and I will be happy to return.",5,2022,06,27
203,Thank you Anastasia!,"Anastasia was such a wonderful sommelier! She gave great recommendations and even sparked a future trip we would like to take! When visiting the Wilde at the Westbury Hotel, it would be a sin to miss a conversation with Anastasia!",5,2022,06,26
203,Wonderful afternoon tea experience!,"We had a magical afternoon tea afternoon with our server Desire!  Can‚Äôt recommend this experience more! A wonderful selection of teas, scones, sandwiches, and desserts. There were 8 of us ranging in age 10-70 and everyone enjoyed the selections.",5,2022,06,26
203,Dining in Wilde,"Wonderful dining experience in Wilde at the Westbury. Joined a friend for dinner in Wilde after their Rose tasting came recommended, it didn‚Äôt disappoint! 
Kudos to Marcin and his team for a great evening from start to finish. The genuinely friendly Alex looked after our table and couldn‚Äôt have been better. The sommelier was but informative and interesting without the usual bore of a wine pairing. The wines were spot on and uniquely exclusive to the Westbury. 
The food was as good, if not better than more renowned restaurants in the city. Amazing prawn and scallop starters. The fish of the day, Hake, was beautifully simple and seasoned perfectly. The risotto was also great. Take a bow chef üëèüèº only shame is we were too full for dessert! Next time maybe‚Ä¶. 
Retired to the sidecar for a post dinner drink, again, everyone we met was so friendly. The cocktails were super and the added touch of a small glass Prosecco while you wait is a nice touch. Thank you all and looking forward to my next visit!",5,2022,06,26
203,Stunning afternoon tea,"Felicia was our waitress today and she was so attentive and friendly. She gave us a glass of bubbly and a little cake to mark a special occasion.  The iced teas were truly delicious and so refreshing on what was a very hot day. The sandwiches were tasty and fresh, as were the scones. The desserts were simply sublime. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Westbury for afternoon tea and will definitely be returning.",5,2022,06,25
203,Excellent stay.,Excellent accommodations. Everyone made us feel welcome and they were very friendly. The location is excellent easy walk to many places. Breakfast was included for us and it was very good.  We arrived very early and the concierge held our bags and they were waiting for us when got back. We would stay here again.,5,2022,06,24
203,Lovely hotel with excellent breakfast,The Westbury is in a great location and there was a warm welcome when we arrived.  The room was large and we were able to request one with a bath (although perhaps that is standard?).  Breakfast was extremely good with the Full Irish  particularly standing out.  We were only there for two nights but would have been happy to stay longer.  The only minor niggle was that housekeeping did not service our room until late afternoon when we had been out most of the day.  It meant that we spent a bit of time hanging around in the corridor but it was not major problem.,4,2022,06,24
203,Great evening with friends at Westbury!,"It was certainly not a planned evening out with my friends this Thursday. Nevertheless,  Alice made our visit to Wesburry super relaxed and enjoyable. Great service and such a friendly personality.  We will definitely return!   Splendid experience!  ",5,2022,06,23

203,Afternoon tea - superb,"Afternoon tea taken at the Westbury Hotel in June 2022 on a recommendation 
A delight , possibly the best I have ever had. 
It was relaxing but a huge challenge to eat the volume served üôÇ
Our hostess Desire was superb and a pleasure to have met.
Thank you",5,2022,06,22
203,"So, So","So my mum and I stayed here two nights recently - June 2022.  I am a regular to Dublin but this was my first stay here.  I was a little disappointed, we had NO maid service on our first night, they did knock on the door at 530pm but at that time we were back from a day out and wanting to get ready for the evening!  Then our check out day, we had a knock at 11am to ask when we were leaving!    
I think the bar in the hotel was OK, quite small and may need more variety on the cocktails.   We had afternoon tea which again was OK, but not the best I've had.   Tables are close together and people are also eating meals around us, which was quite noisy. 
I had emailed my complaints, but ignored. 

Location is OK, but we had the back room which was quite noisy and not scenic at all!
Not sure I would stay again.",3,2022,06,22
203,Wonderful Hotel and great location,"Wonderful hotel and great location.  The staff could not have been more helpful and welcoming.  With all going on around it, the rooms were very quiet with no noise from outdoors.  
We ate at the hotel restaurants twice and each time it was excellent...again the staff was most attentive.

When we return, we will stay here.",5,2022,06,20
203,No room at the Inn,"Booked our 30th anniversary stay here nearly 2 months ago and arrived at reception approx 5pm only to be told there our room was not ready and reception had no idea what time it would be ready. It that would call me ?? 
We were offed a complimentary drink while we waited and were asked to sit in the lobby area, we waited 15 minutes before someone approached us to take a drinks order.the irony of the server asking which room number she should charge the drinks too, ( had to explain they were complimentary) 
Got the call about 5:45 to say room was ready.
Given check in is normally 3pm this is really not acceptable.
No issues with the room etc, but breakfast wasn‚Äôt great either l, long wait to be seated and then long waits to be served  hot food. Servers seemed to be flat out and I think they actually forgot about us , eventually I stood up and caught the attention of someone and requested hot food ,
Overall we left feeling very flat after our Westbury stay , and as it was a 30th wedding anniversary celebration it wasn‚Äôt ideal.",2,2022,06,19
203,Afternoon tea,"We celebrated my cousins engagement this afternoon with afternoon tea.The service and food was amazing,special mention to Alice who was so attentive and gave great recommendations for tea.She was such a pleasure",5,2022,06,18

She really helped make this experience one to not forget!",5,2022,06,17
203,Feel like I‚Äôve been scammed!,"BUYER BEWARE!! The pictures on the website are completely misleading. Less than half their rooms match the gorgeous photos online. The other half haven‚Äôt been renovated or redecorated in decades.

We paid ‚Ç¨500 a night to look over a light well at the rear of the hotel in a room where the closets were broken and the minibar was jammed so tight into a narrow cupboard that it wouldn‚Äôt open. Why would a so-called ‚Äú5 star hotel‚Äù even have a room open to guests where the minibar cannot be opened? God knows how long the items have been stuck in there.

There‚Äôs been a cleaning trolley been parked outside our room for the last 5 hours. 

This is a 3 star hotel dressed in a 5 star hotel‚Äôs clothes. I‚Äôve stayed in a Holiday Inn in rural Arizona that had nicer rooms. 

Sarah, the guest service manager on duty, was condescending totally unwilling to have a conversation with me about making this right.

Feel like I‚Äôve been totally scammed. And on what was supposed to be my 30th birthday celebration!",1,2022,06,17
203,Afternoon ¬´¬†snacks¬†¬ª at the Westbury!,Just wonderful‚Ä¶ Alice was our fantastic hostess ( th√© term server cannot be used‚Ä¶) and attended to our every need . It is a pleasure to have such a hostess.Highly recommended for a deluxe afternoon experience!,5,2022,06,17

Carina our server provided outstanding service and the food was excellent, would highly recommend to anyone looking to grab a bite or drinks.",5,2022,06,14
203,"Very convenient location, excellent service","The hotel is situated right on Grafton Street, which means that there is no lack of dining (and shopping) options within easy reach.  Rooms are large (had a King Room).  The bathroom was modern and clean.
Breakfast is served in Wilde's.  Fruits and cold cuts on the buffet, cooked breakfast on order.  Guests may order more than one dish.  Good selection.  Friendly service generally.
Balfe's Restaurant was noisy, which was not entirely comfortable.  Food was acceptable.  Good service, but the waiter seemed harassed (Friday night crowd).",5,2022,06,14
203,Afternoon tea at the Gallery.,"We had a lovely afternoon at The Westbury Hotel. The afternoon tea was delicious with a wide variety of sandwiches, treats and drinks. Our server Marta T was so friendly and helpful which really made the experience extra enjoyable. Would highly recommed.",5,2022,06,13
203,Lovely hotel in a lively neighborhood,"The Westbury was our first stop and we loved the ability to walk out into Dublin and enjoy the local attractions on our first day. The hotel was very busy, so we couldn‚Äôt check in until a bit later than normal check-in, but we walked the Trinity campus and St. Stephen‚Äôs Green, did a little shopping, and went to Mass at St. Teresa‚Äôs. A big thank-you to the housekeeping staff for finding some valuables we left behind and keeping them for us all week as we toured the west and southwest.",4,2022,06,13
203,Amazing dinner at Gallery. Food was delicious but the highlight was the care Carina provided for our family. Superb!,Dinner at the Gallery was superb. The food was delicious but the highlight was the care and attention Carina provided our family. She gave excellent recommendations and was incredibly friendly.we highly recommend the Gallery and ask for Carina if you want the best.,5,2022,06,12
203,Fantastic experience overall,"The Westbury is in a perfect location for most tourist attractions in Dublin. It is easy walking distance from many bars, restaurants, cathedrals, museums, etc.  Breakfast at the Wilde was gorgeous with the flower walls, beautiful views, and delicious food. The rooms were impeccable, everything you want from a traditional Dublin room with modern features. Dinner at the Gallery was a culinary affair with interesting combinations of food that delight the palate. We had an excellent server in Carina, she was attentive, helpful, and kind. Overall, the decor of the hotel was luxurious and relaxing. We had a great stay and would definitely come back again.",5,2022,06,12
203,Disappointing Calamity,"This good be a very long review with everything that wrong. In my 35 years of travel this was by far the most non 5 Star experience. I was shocked how bad this was. So here goes. We were given a nice upgrade at check-in. We got to the room and it was beyond warm and the carpet was filthy. See picture. The A/C took hours to catch up and it was still warm most of the night. I decided to shave before dinner and as I moved the vanity mirror to the side the entire mirror fell of the wall bringing dust dirt, wood and wallpaper onto the counter top and all our toiletries. It was a mess. Ok. New day. At about 1130p I called room service for a pot of coffee for 2 for 8am. Sort of extra wake up call. We wake up about 810am and no coffee. I call Room Service who doesn‚Äôt answer and it rolls over to Front Desk. They send up a bag with 2 little Keurig cups for the coffee machine. Nope! Try again and coffee arrives. We go to breakfast and head back to the room and our keys have been deactivated at 9am. Back to the front desk. Lastly upon leaving we had our car brought up from valet. All good. As we leave our car is in front and we thank the bellman. We drive away and head right into a walking street. Bellman could have certainly told us to turn around at the hotel. All in all from the dirty carpet and poor a/c along with the vanity mirror it appears upkeep is an issue. The staff does try very very hard to please and quite a few are from Eastern Europe and I‚Äôm wondering how much training they really got before they started. That‚Äôs the story.",2,2022,06,11

My Mom and daughter go twice a year for birthday treat, but I was always more a Sherbourne  afternoon tea girl. Sadly I may be going to the Westbury instead. Its just that little bit more luxurious,  attentive and nicer decor. Maybe the Shelbourne is playing a little too much on its tradition of afternoon tea and while still lovely the Westbury comes up that bit better, especially  if you get served by Marta T.

When our official 2 hour sitting time was up we were wondering if we had to hurry and finish up but Alice reassured us to relax, enjoy the afternoon and take all the time we need! And then the food‚Ä¶.. Absolutely delicious!!! We have been offered a top up of the sandwiches but there was no way we could have eaten any more.

203,Can‚Äôt beat the location.,"I planned our trip to Ireland for almost 2 years since we couldn‚Äôt travel in 2021 as originally planned. Although I was not terribly impressed with Ireland overall our 6 night stay at the Westbury was definitely above par. I decided to base in Dublin and take day trips since the whole island is smaller than my state so I decided to book an exceptional hotel. I went back and forth between the Westin and the Westbury. We were very glad to have chosen the Westbury! I felt the best part of Dublin was Grafton Street and everything else was easily accessible on foot from there. The lobby is really as gorgeous as the photos show and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was well appointed, very nice and the bathroom was pretty good too. Things that weren‚Äôt great? The tub floor was very high off the bath floor and being short - I was nervous every time I stepped down. Two - the elevators were a little shabby and could use some sprucing up. And finally the breakfast included with room rate had a limited menu. Not sure if there was a larger selection when paying for breakfast or not but 6 mornings with the same small menu got a little monotonous. Our trip would have been better if we hadn‚Äôt been stuck in Ireland an extra 10 days due to hubby getting a positive covid test but still the Westbury was the best part of our vacation.",5,2022,05,08

The hotel is lovely and perfectly situated just off Grafton Street. Staff were so pleasant the first time, it was part of what brought us back the second time. I really can't say enough about the Manager, Daniel. He was everything you want in your hotel manager - we had a small issue when we first arrived and he came directly to the room and had us moving to a different room within 30 minutes time. I sincerely appreciated his direct approach to resolving our situation and letting us get on with our holiday weekend. Too often the front desk staff passes you on to maintenance or someone else - Daniel dealt directly and quickly to help us and we were very happy with him and felt valued and taken care of.  Kevin at the door and Thomas the concierge are also excellent additions to the hotel - always friendly and welcoming, they are two of the people on this excellent staff who help to make The Westbury an elegant and friendly Dublin destination hotel. The hotel restaurants are excellent - love the Gallery for a very special and extravagant tea time (and they did a fantastic job dealing with the food allergies in our group - Marta was excellent), and Wilde for breakfast. Our family loves The Westbury, it's absolutely where we'll stay when we next visit Dublin!",5,2022,04,28

The Gallery area is a super experience and a great meeting place and place to relax . Varied menus are available in the Gallery area. 
Breakfast in the Wilde restaurant you could not fault and is excellent, dinner in the same restaurant is ok but very pricey. Balfes restaurant attached to the hotel is another dinner option at more reasonable prices.

Rooms in hotel are ok, not that big and could do with a bit of upgrading, headboards, curtains, etc are a bit tired looking.

From reception, dining, bar to the front door, the Westbury staff are highly courteous and very professional.

Upon arrival the staff and in particular the doormen were so friendly and helpful. The food in the restaurant was lovely and the bar service was very good. However, sadly the room was very disappointing and we were greatly let down given the high price we paid for the room.  The room itself was quite basic and felt shabby, bathroom was dirty, the basin and toilet hadn't been cleaned fully from the previous guests and there was stains all over the carpets.

Marta T was our main server, and took great care of us, offering top ups of sandwiches & tea throughout our stay. They even treated my mom to a complimentary mini-cheesecake!

The tea was quite traditional, though there were beverage options including cold summer teas or champagne options (I believe the cost increases for the champagne options, of course). We didn't quite manage to clear our plates, but take away boxes were provided, so we took the last few pastries & scones home.

I'd definitely recommend the afternoon tea here for quality, service and surroundings, if you're looking for a special treat.",5,2022,04,01

Central location
Beautiful public spaces
Nice food in WILDE

Cons
Slow service
Some miscommunication with front desk staff on one occasion
Very early turndown service - arriving at 5pm whilst we were getting ready for a a 7pm booking downstairs
Food was just ok in Balfes - standard bar food 
A number of rooms in our party were kept up by extremely loud nightclub music outside their window (I didn‚Äôt have this problem but a few woke up tired both mornings from the disturbance)
Thin walls in all rooms (could hear next door on a phone call early morning)

I looked online for several places and the location was perfect and the photos you see online do not deceive, it is a gorgeous environment. Yes it is a bit pricey, but worth every penny for such luxury.  If we are to ever return, which I would love to, we will be staying here again.",5,2022,03,19
203,Westbury hotel,"The Westbury is undeniably a lovely hotel, however, it is not as self important as it‚Äôs staff appears to have been advised. While Dublin prides itself on friendliness as a guest I have rarely been treated as rudely as this hotel. Class is what class gives. Terrible service with an edge of downright hostility.",1,2022,03,19

203,Top Dublin Hotel,"We stayed here overnight while in Dublin for a show. Its the second time we stayed here for one night. We had dinner at Balfes and drinks later after the show there too. Dinner was the most delicious fish in GF batter, the best around in my opinion. We had breakfast the next morning, eggs benedict, which was perfect. The staff and particularly the door staff were more than helpful. Only problem surprisingly was our room, the toilet had not been cleaned, the seat, the toilet rim and the bowl had urine on it. The rest of the bathroom was spotless. Also the carpet and seats at the window are badly stained, I would have thought that they would be a priority to clean in a five star hotel. Any how it didn't take away from our lovely stay and we hope to return many times this year for a few more shows.",4,2022,03,18

203,"Nice location, terrible service",This is like a two star hotel in a fantastic location.  Do not expect much in terms of service but you will be close to everything.  You call room service to order food and you may get a recording that they are too busy to answer.  The doormen are flirting with women just outside the door smoking so you may walk through thick smoke to enter.,2,2022,03,15
203,Stunning afternoon tea experience,"My fianc√©e and I went for afternoon tea on Saturday to celebrate a special occasion and were blown away by the hospitality of the staff and the quality of the food and drinks.

203,A random visit from America,"We booked this hotel through our Amex FHR program and randomly was walking by in the lobby. We decided to try this tea time. Confused Americans who barley knew what to do. Sissi, came to our rescue and explained how everything worked. We weren't hungry which really in hindsight you could do this as a lunch replacement but if you want to just munch and sip tea this is really good. It's finally nice to taste what a real scone taste like. The cream then jelly on top was delicious. 

Both Sissi and the person who was pouring the tea her name started with a M were great help in getting us situated. 

The sandwiches were okay bread tasted fresh but their just sandwiches. The top layer tier had desserts which we could barley take a few bites because we were so full  from just eating lunch an hour prior but of the ones we did  try they were amazing.

Aside from our tea time we have been  getting room service from Andrea P who has been very lovely setting our breakfast up in the mornings for room service. It's kind of the best way to start the morning is to see her smiling face bringing us loads of food. All of the food we get for breakfast were good the eggs were cooked to perfections scrabbled and super fluffy.
   
So far our service here has been far better then our stay at Shelborne Hotel which cost more.",5,2022,03,07
203,Pleasant overnight,"Location of this hotel is the best, its right in city centre. Bedroom very cosy, small and compact, not sure if it reflects a five star room. Cocktail bar was great.

No pretentious fluffing here, the Westbury  know what works! We had a couple of bottles of Prosecco and Aaron recommended the Wake me up cocktail. Again Delish!!

The staff were professional and attentive.  The Afternoon  Tea area was extremely busy.  Our food was delivered to us at 2pm.  I understand from a member of the staff that there were only 2 coffee machines operating that day, which delayed the delivery of coffee. At 3.15  we were advised that the table was needed for 3.30.   While we understood that we have a two hour window,  the delay on delivery of afternoon was not caused by us.   It seemed a pity that we felt we were rushed out at 3.30.  You must also appreciate that while the whole experience is lovely,  it is a treat but  we felt short changed by the experience.   ",4,2022,02,22
203,Front Desk & Concierge Team,"Thank you to John and Thomas of the Concierge team - kind, accommodating, and an overall delight to interact with! We had an impossible request for a large group reservation - John has followed up with a status update, even after our stay at the Westbury has concluded.

Front desk team was also great - the team lead who checked us in the morning of Feb 20 (I terribly have forgotten her name) was very warm and welcoming after a long flight from the states - this was exactly the introduction to Dublin to set a happy tone for our trip.

Thank you Westbury team!",5,2022,02,21

Couldn't thank her enough very attentive and lovel.
Thank you.",5,2022,02,17
203,A good but not quite perfect stay,"We stayed here as a couple on a Saturday night in February 2022. We arrived early (9.30am) and pulled up outside the front door. There was nobody outside the hotel at this time but once we got out of the car two people came out, one took our bags and the other parked our car. Parking is ‚Ç¨25 for the night.

We entered the hotel and walked up the stairs to reception. First impressions were very good....there is a wow factor when you take in the surrounding. It turned out that our room (539) was ready was that was a great bonus. 

The room itself was a decent size. The bed was extremely comfortable and shower was excellent. We had no view to speak off but that was fine. 

We had dinner booked in Balfe's for 8pm that night. We arrived at 7.50pm and told table not ready yet. So we stood at the bar and ordered a drink. Five minutes later we were led to our table. Another 5 minutes later someone different came to take our order but we had to explain that we were yet to receive menus. Once we got these we ordered. The food was very slow in coming out and I had to look for someone to come to our table to take a drinks order while we waited. However, when the food did come it was excellent. 

After Balfes we went back upstairs and tried to go into the Sidecar cocktail bar. However, we were told it was full up but we could get a drink in the lobby and someone would get us when a free table came up. This was fine but after sitting outside for nearly 30 minutes I seen loads of other couples being allowed into the bar. I went up and asked the girl on the door why we were still waiting and she apologised and took us straight in and gave us a table (She had clearly forgotten about us).

After 2 drinks each i requested the bill and got the wrong bill. Once this was settled we paid and left. 

With the exception of the service in Balfe's and the Sidecar, everything else about this hotel visit was to the highest standard. 

However, you are paying top money for accommodation, food and drinks so you don't expect this kind of service in a 5 star hotel. 

Debatable if I would return in the future.",4,2022,02,17
203,A night at the Westbury,"We had one night at the hotel on our way to Donegal. Staff were very helpful and professional. The door man was great and saw us off the following morning. Food in the restaurant was great. 
Room was very peaceful.",5,2022,02,15
203,Magical Weekend at The Westbury,"Wow. 

What a weekend! We were truly spoiled. It‚Äôs our little home away from home.  The staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for us, tripping up over us! A special mention to Derek the doorman. He couldn‚Äôt do enough for us and as he said himself, welcomed us to the Westbury Family. A traditional genuine gentlemen. 

We ate in Balfe‚Äôs evening and my mouth is watering. Food was sensational and I can be quite tricky. 
Our room was amazing and bottle of Prosecco and huge chocolate  strawberries to boot! 

Cocktails were class. Derek personally made sure that a table would be reserved for us for drinks later on the evening. 

I can‚Äôt explain the magic of this place.. We travel quite a bit, but this hotel and the people in it are simply unreal. It‚Äôs impossible to put into words the feeling you have when you‚Äôre there",5,2022,02,14
203,A lovely treat in opulent surroundings.,"Had afternoon tea for two in The Gallery at The Westbury Hotel today. The surroundings were beautiful and the atmosphere was perfect - relaxed and enjoyable. 

The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The waiter who took our order asked us if there was anything we‚Äôd like to swap on the menu and a couple of minor tweaks were no problem at all. Meant we could avoid the egg mayonnaise and the fruit scones! The team were also keen to tell us we could have more sandwiches or scones if we liked. Have never been told that at afternoon tea before. Nice touch. 

The food was delicious, especially the ham and cheese with mustard sandwich on granary bread. A must tastier version of the everyday staple. Everything is made and presented with such detail the whole experience was a real treat. 

Special mention for Aaron who served us most often - he had a friendly yet professional manner and had a natural flair for the job. 

We had a perfect window seat for a great view. All in all a very worthwhile outing. If you‚Äôre considering booking, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.",5,2022,02,13
203,Afternoon Tea,We had a fabulous afternoon tea in The Westbury and were looked after wonderfully by Felicia. She was so friendly and helpful! The food and service was spectacular. Looking forward to another return visit soon.,5,2022,02,13
203,Below Par Afternoon Tea,"My friend booked afternoon tea as a birthday treat in the Westbury.  Our sitting was for 3p.m for 2 people   Lovely seat by the window overlooking Grafton Street.   Our waiter came over and introduced himself and handed us the menus.  A short time later a waitress came over with a pot of tea that she said was for our table, we had not ordered any tea at this stage and said it was not for us, she went and got our waiter who was saying it was our tea, again we pointed out we had not ordered tea yet. Next came the mix up with the orders, my friend had ordered a mix of vegetarian and fish for her sandwich selection, her plate comes out with vegetarian only.   We had both stated no Pistachio eclair, and one of the plates came out with pistachio. The biggest surprise for me in a 5* hotel was when we were changing to different teas and asked for clean cups, I was handed a cup that had clearly visible lipstick marks on it, I pointed it out to the waiter, who then tried to tell us it was part of the pattern ... seriously!!  He finally got the message that it was a dirty cup he was trying to give to us and replaced it with a clean one. No water was provided at the table, which to me is a basic standard anywhere else i have had afternoon tea  As this was a birthday treat, my friend when booking had marked it as so, she was bitterly disappointed when no effort whatsoever was made by the staff to mark the occasion   Will we be back to the Westbury, I don't think so.  We have had much better afternoon teas in the Shelbourne, the Merrion and the Westin.  A very disappointed guest",3,2022,02,13
203,Birthday Lunch,"Went to Westbury for lunch for my granddaughter's birthday. Had lunch in Wilde Restuarent lovely food, good service, friendly staff. Lovely  atmosphere if you want to treat yourself or somedody for a special occasion would recommend here it is a tad pricey but it is The Westbury but as i said for a special occasion it is lovely.",4,2022,02,10

203,Westbury Hotel,"We have recently visited the Westbury for a girls night away. The location of the Hotel is ideal for shopping and bars and restaurants. The price of the hotel is very high and you are paying for the location. The hotel is clean and the staff are very professional however i think our expiations for the room  were much higher than what it is in reality. Rooms are fine, beds is very comfortable but for what you pay I though the standard of the rooms would be higher. ",4,2022,02,07
203,Still THE place to stay in Dublin,"We have stayed in most of the decent Dublin hotels but this one has become a firm favourite. Location is excellent, a terrific bar (The Sidecar) with wonderful staff (Puglian Federico!) an outstanding breakfast and comfy rooms.  The rooms could now do with a refresh but are still super comfortable.  Doesn‚Äôt deter us as we think it is still the place to be. 
Do book your breakfast slot though as it ensures a good table. 
Also thanks to concierge Kevin for sorting me out with an emergency nail appointment! 
We‚Äôll be back.",5,2022,02,07
203,Such a lovely hotel,We have stayed in some lovely hotels and you can dress them up as fancy as you like but they always seem to be missing something.  The Westbury has it all. The rooms are immaculate and so comfortable. The location for a city break is perfect. The restaurant food and breakfast is outstanding. The staff are attentive and seem to take such pride in you enjoying your stay. A massive thank you to Matt and his concierge team. They work tirelessly to ensure everything runs smoothly. I can‚Äôt wait to go back.,5,2022,02,06
203,Afternoon Tea,Had an amazing time at the Westbury. We went for my friend‚Äôs Hen party. The food and service was second to none. Marta T was especially attentive and provided us with additional cakes and sandwiches at her suggestion. She also brought out a cake as a surprise for the bride which was a really nice touch. She made our visit such a great experience. üòä,5,2022,02,06

203,Afternoon tea,"Afternoon tea at the Gallery in the Westbury was an amazing experience. The maitre d, Kim was charming and professional and introduced us to our host Felicia who was so attentive and professional. 
We could not sing her praises enough for making sure we were comfortable and that we had enough to eat and drink. Even though she was busy attending to other guests, she still made the time to talk to us and make us feel valued as guests. 
She came across as being naturally interested in what we had to say and she was also very whitty with a very down to earth and bubbly attitude. 
She presented to us a beautiful selection of sandwiches, scones and petit fours along with seemingly endless flow of tea and coffee. Being a champagne tea, we thoroughly enjoyed our champagne too. 
Overall Felicia was professional, attentive, very charming and overall good fun too.
I could recommend a better host as she was attentive but not I  your face lime some other places we have visited.
As it was my wife Fiona's birthday, Felicia presented her with a lovely little birthday cake which we were not expecting which was on the house. Its the little things like that which really makes our visit special.
Please anyone, visit the Westbury for afternoon tea or stay at the hotel. You will be guaranteed a great welcome and an outstanding service.
Thank you Felicia for your smile and attention to detail and for the chat. And a big thank you to everyone else who were so kind and looked after us for our afternoon stay. 
Regards
Richard Laverty.",5,2022,01,29

203,5 star service at Afternoon Tea,"The service at afternoon tea was second to none. The Westbury might be one of Dublin‚Äôs fancier hotels with 5 star service to match but thanks to the friendly and attentive nature of the staff the atmosphere was also quite relaxed. We wanted for nothing, the tea and sandwiches never stopped coming and we were even given boxes to take what we couldn‚Äôt finish. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this afternoon tea, the best way to spend a Sunday. Felicia even surprised us with a happy birthday desert - can‚Äôt wait to come back!",5,2022,01,16

203,This isn't just another hotel,"This hotel isn't just another hotel, it's a feeling, it's a memory, it's a place that  my friend and I visit the same weekend every year in December and we save all year for it. Its more than a hotel it's a tradition. And we absolutely adore everything about it, from Kevin the door man to Kevin on check in, who I may add travels from waterford up and down every day for work. We live our best lives in this hotel, we walk through those door and we literally feel like a million dollars. From afternoon tea to dinner in wilde all are exceptional as is the staff. So if your looking for something a little bit more than just a hotel look no further. See you in 2022 and we are counting down the days already. ",5,2022,01,09
203,No room for us in lounge (The Gallery) or bar (The Sidecar) during a Christmas stay - bad service,"I had booked a 3 day/ 2 nights romantic stay December 2021 with breakfast. We arrived Friday at 1 pm and when we wanted to book afternoon tea in The Gallery they told us it was booked the entire weekend.

We accepted that but no one offered to give us notice in case a booking was cancelled or the like.

When the same thing happened in the bar, we ended up having a 3 day stay at The Westbury where we went directly to our room or from our room and outside every time we had been out or were going out to dine, shop and enjoy Christmas in Dublin.

Since I booked the hotel specifically because the indoor facilities looked tasteful and spacious, I really regretted my choice because I could have booked any other hotel with a pleasant room.

On Saturday evening upon our return from dining in the city we wanted a drink in the bar and when the person at the door said they couldn't help us even though we were guests at the hotel I asked to speak to the manager and told him in a calm way that they really should consider calling the hotel welcoming when they kept refusing their own guests.
He didn't really respond.

The next day I said the same thing in the reception upon check out when they asked about our stay. After listening to our troubles the receptionist said *I'm sorry, but I hope you liked Dublin?'

Ha ha I actually couldn't help but laugh.

When we came to pick up our luggage a lady from staff asked if we had enjoyed our stay and when I told her about the non welcoming happenings for 3 days, she offered to give us an upgrade next time. Maybe an idea if we had gotten a response sooner.
I told that we were not coming back.

The hotel is not worth the money.",2,2022,01,08
203,Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon tea was a fantastic experience. Lovely selection of food and gorgeous room. Felicia our waitress was very friendly and helpful and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. Would definitely recommend, it was a lovely treat.",5,2022,01,08
203,christmas stay,"excellent hotel, 5 star all the way . staff from arrival out front to the  sidecar bar, wilde restaurant excellent food and cocktails, a great experience and close to Christmas , made it more special to stay at this wonderful hotel",5,2022,01,07
203,Didn't live up to expectations,"Stayed at the westbury for one night. It was a great deal at 360 B&B. A number of things let the hotel down and maybe it can be justified by the price being low but these are just my observations. When we checked in our room wasn't ready, the receptionist advised they would call us when it was ready so we went for a walk. We never received a call about our room and arrived back at 5pm to be told room is ready and bag in it, frustrating for us. Side bar was closed, gallery menu was really awful, poor beer and whiskey options and staff who openly admitted not having a clue. Drinks options were wine, champagne or 6 cocktails, i'd never heard of most. The nights sleep, really hot, not much air in the room,couldn't get the temperature to regulate. Pillows lost all comfort after lying on them for five minutes. The view was poor. The bathroom was gorgeous, room decor itself was stunning. Valet staff were very friendly, that was the highlight for us.",2,2022,01,04
203,Afternoon tea,"""Marta was amazing and her along with others made our experience super magical! I took my friend there for her 30th bday celebration and the staff made sure to make it special for her. The service was quick and the food was delicious! Can't wait to be back!""",5,2022,01,03
203,Festive Afternoon Tea,"First time trying the festive afternoon tea at the Gallery, and we will definitely be going back. From start to finish, the whole experience was fantastic. Food was delicious, and you could order an endless amount of teas/coffee from the menu. The service by Martha was impeccable, extremely attentive, and everything was presented beautifully.",5,2022,01,02
203,Afternoon tea at the Gallery westbury,"Had an amazing afternoon tea at the gallery. I was served by the most amazing staff member being Marta T!! Highly recommend everyone to come here! The hotel is immaculate, service is top quality and staff are incredible!",5,2022,01,01

203,Continues to be our favourite place in Dublin,"We had the opportunity to stay at two other of the best hotels in Dublin on this trip at different times  and the Westbury did not fail to seduce us again when we visited for the fourth time just before leaving Ireland. We were in a renovated room on the 5th floor and appreciated the updated decor (only problem is sensor nightlight that turns off as soon as you ceased moving so there is a constant on/off but I am sure this will be remedied after leaving note with management) and, even though the rooms and bathrooms are on the smaller size, everything we needed was there. Location remains prime, we love the public space, lively yet chic (especially decked for the holidays) and the restaurant Wilde never disappoints, wether for a romantic dinner or a delicious breakfast. ",5,2021,12,31
203,Comfort Blanket Luxury at Christmas,"2 night luxury break between Christmas and New Year. Everything about this hotel was just what the doctor ordered. Our suite had a full size gorgeous Christmas tree, champagne and chocolates. 
Hotel staff were so lovely but also very professional too. Not very young teenagers as is the norm now in most ‚Äúluxury‚Äù hotels. Sidecar cocktail lounge is like a home from home to relax in before dinner, oh and after dinner too! The wee complimentary Prosecco whilst you wait for your cocktail to be made is a lovely touch.
The Wilde fine dining restaurant is just perfect for setting, ambiance, service and most importantly the exquisite food. We ate both nights and tested most of the menu between us, all the food was excellent. Breakfast in Wilde is table service and again very high quality food & service. The location for Grafton street shopping is perfect too. You can nip in and out of the shops back to the hotel to drop off bags and go out again.
Overall we couldn‚Äôt fault our stay and we will be back very soon.",5,2021,12,30
203,Afternoon tea,"What an amazing way to spend 2 hours, absolutely amazing, delicious and a superb selection of delights. All in a fabulous atmosphere and we were well looked after by the very attentive Martat. Felt completely safe with regard to Covid-19 restrictions implemented. And would highly recommend The Gallery for Afternoon tea.",5,2021,12,28
203,Afternoon Tea,"Amazing experience for afternoon tea in the gallery! Very professional service, especially Desire - she was so so attentive! The afternoon tea was really good and the food was delish! The champagne was also very good and a choice between brut and Rose",5,2021,12,27
203,Yet another excellent stay!,"This is our second time staying at The Westbury, we booked it after such a positive experience the first time and have to say, this exceeded our expectations yet again.

From the minute we arrived we were greeted with a smile, a welcome and a good laugh from Kevin, Derek and Aidan on the door. Our car was parked and our bags taken to reception where the check in was effortless, thanks to Laura on reception. We enjoyed a coffee in the Gallery and were taken care of by Ciara, Marta and Andrea. It was a lovely space to sit and take in the Christmas vibes, the decor was fabulous.

The rooms are spotlessly clean, extremely comfortable and the Christmas tree was lovely. We had a welcome note which was very personal, noting our previous stay and, as far as we remember, a lady called Sharon left a Teddy bear for our daughter. Such a nice touch. Thank you!

Each time we passed through the doors we were greeted, the staff remembering our names and ensuring we had all we needed.

Daniel on reception made check out easy and again our car was waiting outside thanks to Eddie and Lukas.

We will 100% be back and will continue to recommend this beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin. 

If you do go make sure to enjoy a good Irish laugh and chat with the guys on the door. First impressions and all that. They're a credit to the hotel.",5,2021,12,22
203,"Beautiful public areas, disappointing bedrooms.","Excellent staff and beautiful public areas. But for the quality of the bedroom The Westbury is seriously overpriced. The bedroom is almost as good as a Premier Inn bedroom. But given a choice I would choose the Premier Inn bedroom. The Westbury bedroom is boring and drab and just a place to sleep. When you are paying the rates they ask it should be more than this and on par with other 5* hotels. Was it just the bedroom we got, possibly. But we decided we wouldn't want to stay there again.",3,2021,12,16
203,Spoilt all the way,"Our glorious 24 hours stay was 5 star service all the way, polished yet friendly and full of charm. 
Its true what they say that first impressions are lasting, Concierge parking with Kevin and a very  polished check-in with laura set the tone.
Beautiful room over looking Grafton Street, turn down service and delicious breakfast with a team impeccable in presentation and early morning charm.
Bravo to The Westbury in what are very trying tomes. We will be back. Thank you.",5,2021,12,14

203,A must stay,"Fabulous room, atmosphere, location, staff, service & food! We could not fault our stay in the Westbury. From the moment we arrived we received fantastic service from the wonderful staff. Food was excellent and our room was stunning. The location is out of this world, lots of great bars and restaurants nearby, not to mention great shops!!!!",5,2021,12,12
203,What‚Äôs the Rush?,"My fianc√© and I visited for afternoon tea and were  booked for Sunday at 3pm. To be fair we arrived 20 mins late as we had a bit of nightmare getting parking in Stephen‚Äôs Green with Christmas shoppers. We were greeted by Kim and we apologised for our tardiness. We were told we had to vacate our table by 5pm as the sitting was for 2 hours only and then we were told again a second time when we were seated all in the space of 30 seconds. It wasn‚Äôt exactly the ‚ÄòC√©in M√≠le F√°ilte‚Äô you might expect when dropping ‚Ç¨156 on Champagne afternoon tea for 2 at a 5* hotel. 

So we took our afternoon tea and in truth everything from the freshness of the sandwiches to the mulled wine and the service were faultless. We were having a lovely time. We decided we‚Äôd complete dessert with some cocktails and we ordered 2 passionfruit martinis from the bar. So our cocktails arrived and they were lovely, shortly followed by Kim, back to inform us that it was now 5:10 and that we needed to leave as our 2 hours had elapsed. 

We found this very strange indeed. There was no one waiting to be seated and we counted 7 vacant tables (large and small) including the one adjacent to us which had been vacated but not cleared for about 30 mins. Indeed our waitress didn‚Äôt protest when we ordered our cocktails, why would she, after all we were spending more money and she didn‚Äôt need the table.

In short, neither of us know why but we were made feel exceptionally unwelcome and we won‚Äôt be in a hurry to be treated that in that manner again. Hospitable it was not.",3,2021,12,12
203,Cmas Visit,"John and Imogen excelled in every way during our stay. The service, quality and attention to detail was second to none. A true Christmas treat! They brought us from our table in the bar to the beautiful fireside sofa afterwards.",5,2021,12,10
203,Christmas Surprise,"we brought our mother to the Westbury for dinner and drinks last Thursday after shopping on Grafton street part of our surprise for Christmas.

the hotel looked beautiful and was so cosy and full of the charismas feeling .
we set in the Fabulous Gallery  and Donal the manager could not have made more  of a fuss of  my 90 year old mother making her feel really special .
after shopping it was great that we only had to  walk feet off the street to the hotel as we were so tired.
Arron our Waiter explained the menu and recommended a  lovely bottle of wine
and chatted away with us making my mother laugh and smile with all his charm saying if she was 70 years younger  she would apply for a job  there !!!

203,Great location but guests are not prioritised,"Really enjoyed our stay as a family, but could not believe it when we had to queue for the hotel bar along with any members of the public. Staff were very nice and did their best to accommodate but this was hotel policy. Also found the bedroom to be very dated, and several bad stains on the carpet.",3,2021,11,29
203,Second impressions,"We stayed here as a complimentory night after an incident during the summer, so this was my second impressions and I am so glad I got to experience what The Westbury is really about. Thank you to Karl B for organising this.

We were able to check in early, which was a very smooth experience. We checked out our room which was a good size and very clean. There was some mini desserts waiting on us which was a lovely touch.
We had drinks in the reidents bar after heading out around the city during the day and thought the atmosphere was great, it was well organised regarding Covid.

Breakfast the next morning was lovely, and we dined in Balfes later that day. The food was absolutely delicious. Service was top class also, I got a cocktail recommendation from the waitress which was lovely.

The service really makes this hotel, it was a lovely treat to stay here.",4,2021,11,29

203,Family Stay,"We just had a few family days spend at The Westbury. Everything was very covid safe. The staff were all lovely and very helpful.

203,A jewel in Dublin's crown.,"Popped in here for an impromptu visit to catch up with my sister whilst on business in town. What a treat! Despite the current circumstances we were warmly welcomed and  accomodated with no fuss.

Looking forward to repeating the experience.

203,Afternoon tea,"I visited here for afternoon tea with a friend for a pre Christmas catch up and had a really lovely time. The Christmas menu was in place and everything was delicious and the selection of teas was amazing as well as hot chocolates and coffees. With the hot beverages being unlimited we were able to try quite a selection of the hot drinks on offer. The staff were so attentive particularly our waitress Sisi and the Christmas decorations were just beautiful making for the perfect location for afternoon tea, right in the heart of Dublin City.",5,2021,11,26
203,FIRST CLASS,"For a hotel to be designated first class, EVERYTHING has to be first class and The Westbury wins hands down.  They have perfected every category but they've especially nailed the key that  makes Ireland and an Irish hotel different to any other hotel in the world - HOSPITALITY.  From the beaming greeting of the reception team to the staff in The Gallery (particularly AARON) and tall he team in Balfes (particularly ISABEL) they win the gold star.  A thoroughly enjoyable few days, and nights. ",5,2021,11,26
203,The Stylist Doyle Group,"Perfection as always, effortless style and attention to detail. Very comfortable pillows and beds. I love the way their hotels are decorated and the staff are the best Ive experienced anywhere in the world.

203,I wish I could give more than 5 stars,"What a lovely place, lovely staff, everyone so helpful and pleasant, if you need to feel good about life, The Westbury will give you that feeling, well done to all the staff for flying the flag during these difficult times.  We were there as 4 sisters and particularly enjoyed the lovely atmosphere of the gallery. Location is perfect too for some retail therapy.",5,2021,11,24
203,The Gallery,"My mom and I had afternoon tea in The Gallery to celebrate a postponed Mother's Day due to COVID. We had a wonderful afternoon! The champagne, food and tea were all amazing. Our sever Felicia was so kind and made sure everything was perfect. I would recommend afternoon tea in the Westbury to anyone looking to celebrate an occasion or even just for a little treat!",5,2021,11,22
203,Fantastic weekend,"After waiting 18months due to covid we have had a fantastic weekend, hotel and staff are absolutely amazing, friendly couldn‚Äôt ask for more. We even met Derek again who gave our daughter his uniform to wear in 2013 and he remembered us he is such a friendly happy chap and can‚Äôt wait to see you all again next year !",5,2021,11,21
203,The gallery at the westbury,Myself and my cousin wanted to treat my mum and auntie to a special afternoon tea post lockdown after missing out on celebrating previous special occasions. Alannah went over and above for us and made the afternoon tea a relaxing and enjoyable experience. She even asked if we were celebrating anything in particular- that day I had just bought my wedding shoes and she brought me out a special desert saying ‚Äòbride to be‚Äô which really made my day. Alannah really did go over and above for us. A true asset to the westbury!,5,2021,11,17
203,Post Lock-down Treat,"This is simply a jewel in the heart of Dublin. Brought my mother as a post-lockdown treat and we had an experience to remember. My thanks to the entire team at the Westbury; the Concierge, Aisling at reception, Mirian at The Gallery and the team at Wildes. ",5,2021,11,17
203,The new normal,This hotel does not sell coffee or tea while you wait for friends one must book in for lunch ...or an afternoon tea you can not enter unless you have one of the above pv doyle must be spining in his grave bless him  this is the new normal after covid ect,1,2021,11,16
203,Wedding anniversary trip,"Wife and I headed to the Westbury for a Saturday night in Dublin .  First impressions were good. It‚Äôs very central and staff are  lovely to deal with.  Situated in very busy area and can be hard to drive through the crowds on the narrow streets to get there.

Reception was smooth (albeit I‚Äôd flagged up that we were there for our anniversary and there was no reference  made to it) but when we got to the room it got a little disappointing... 
Room was ‚Äúok‚Äù but very dated. Nothing like one would assume a five star hotel room to be. And at over 500 euros a night plus 25 to park the car‚Ä¶. Well .. we expected better. I realise people pay (as we did) for the location etc in a major city but it‚Äôs just not good enough at these prices. We have had much more luxurious stays in Dublin in the past.

We didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel at any stage but did have a drink in the bar upon our late night return. Was fine but very quiet.

We‚Äôre both glad we had our night in Dublin and got to experience the westbury.  We will definitely be back to Dublin again but not to this hotel. Nothing major wrong at all  just not anywhere near value for money.  That said it was packed and will be packed again without us so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not of huge consequence to the hotel what we do! Supply and demand is everything I guess but it‚Äôs just not for us in the future.",3,2021,11,16
203,The Gallery at the Westbury,"Mirina at The Gallery was excellent. Really professional and friendly - she took time to talk to guests and showed great efficient. Even though she‚Äôs brand new, Mirina is a great asset to the business. I‚Äôd thoroughly recommend the Gallery. Bernard",5,2021,11,16
203,Wedding September 2021,"My husband and I got married in the Westbury in September this year. Due to covid related issues at two previous venues, we only booked the Westbury 5 weeks before. From the moment we met our wedding coordinator Kate, we knew we were in safe hands. She was excellent throughout. We couldn't have been happier on the day, we were so well looked after by all the staff, including Rory who managed things in the evening. The food was phenomenal on the day, the guests are still raving about it and the service were second to none. Already looking forward to our anniversary dinner :) Would highly for a city centre wedding.",5,2021,11,15
203,Another lovely visit,"The Westbury is a delightful deluxe hotel which consistently delivers in relation to room quality, food and staff service. Dinner in Wilde's was outstanding & afternoon tea in the Gallery was delightful",5,2021,11,15
203,Wonderful Birthday Celebration,Marta T and Kayley were great help. Excellent service with nice touches to mark the occasion.We were very late and there was no issue. I would highly recommend.  Good value compared to other afternoon teas I have done in the likes of Harrods,5,2021,11,14
203,Fantastic Afternoon Tea,"We treated ourselves to a champagne afternoon tea today in the Westbury and it was wonderful. Marta looked after us and was so friendly, welcoming & accommodating. She made such an effort to ensure we enjoyed the afternoon, including a special celebratory cake & teddy when she heard we were celebrating the arrival of my baby niece. The atmosphere in the gallery area is so comfortable & spacious, and with the Christmas decorations now up, it really was a festive treat. We're already planning a return trip! I would highly recommend the Westbury, and many thanks to Marta for looking after us so well.",5,2021,11,14
203,Afterwards tea at the Westbury,Served by Martha t in the gallery for afternoon team. A delightful service and made great by Martha t. Delicious food . High standard . Love and clean. Great hotel would recommend to anyone. Ambience is great . Sit beside the window looking out.,5,2021,11,14
203,Champagne Afternoon Tea - one of the best,"Today was my mums birthday, so I decided to treat both her and her sister to champagne afternoon tea. When I say Marta and her team in the gallery room made sure we had the most amazing experience, one that we hope to repeat now yearly. The atmosphere and ambiance in the gallery area was so nice.   The Xmas decorations made it feel soo Christmassy. I would highly recommend the westbury, so much nicer and cosier then The Shelbourne.",5,2021,11,11
203,Amazing experience,We had an exquisite three course meal in 'The Wilde' restaurant. The food was top class as well as the service. Brendan was our waiter for the evening and was so helpful and polite. Would highly recommend.,5,2021,11,10
203,Absolute Excellence,"Staying with my partner celebrating a special birthday and what a treat it was. The welcome from Derek and Tom was very warm, reception was friendly yet efficient and the room more than comfortable. Beautiful welcome amenity and personal note.
Covid protocol is very well observed in all areas and the staff were fantastic. Kim in the Gallery and Brendan along with Marcin in Wilde.
It‚Äôs so relaxing and having people like Eddie to tend to your every need is a real treat, staff like him are a pleasure and set the tone for everyone.
Special shout out to Miguel at the desk for directions, lifesaver!
Finally I would have to say it‚Äôs as well run an establishment as you will find on the island and that‚Äôs something the management should be proud of.
Thank you all.",5,2021,11,07
203,Price doesn't match with the standard,"Noisy room with, I could hear outside noisy in the room, water from the bath was not getting warm enough for a bath (my partner brought it to reception concern and we never heard any apologies for this inconvenience, the only thing reception said they would ask maintenance to check it...also not enough body wash and shampoo for 2 people, room locker not working . Hard to manage the heating system as I tried to set it several times was getting warm enough. Room very clean and comfortable bed with nice tv, breakfast service good",3,2021,11,07
203,Fantastic Afternoon Tea at the Westbury,"We went to the Westbury for afternoon tea for a celebration.
Marta was our server there and couldn't have been more helpful, she really made the occasion feel special! The food was fantastic and the decor is really beautiful.
Can't recommend it enough!",5,2021,11,02
203,Greatest bed ever!!,"We started and ended our trip at the Westbury. A bottle of champagne was in our room when we checked in. The first day after our flight, we were able to check in early. All the staff were genuinely glad to see tourists return. The room was extremely comfortable. We did have a bit of trouble figuring out the lights. The bathroom was large and spacious. The shower/tub was a bit too high for this short person to get in, but had great water pressure. Bothe restaurants in the hotel offered delicious food and excellent service as well. 
We had to scramble to get our return COVID testing and the front desk was extremely helpful with this. 
We would definitely stay here again. Thank you for a lovely visit.",5,2021,11,01
203,Fabulous Afternoon Tea,Had a wonderful Champagne Afternoon Tea to celebrate a life event. Beautiful and interesting desserts and a wonderful selection of teas! The rose Champagne was a Real Treat! Martha T was a friendly and attentive waitress who went the extra mile and organised a suprise Peach Melba for the occassion. Cound not have asked for a more comfortable and pleasant environment :),4,2021,11,01
203,Afternoon Tea at The Gallery @the Westbury,"The care and attention which Alannah provided made an already special occasion perfect. Fabulous food, a beautiful selection of teas, high-quality champagne. I highly recommend a visit to the Westbury.",5,2021,11,01
203,Excellent afternoon tea,"Excellent service by Carina for a special afternoon tea. in The Gallery.  The food was delicious and beautifully presented.  The service was professional, courteous, friendly and efficient. We were a party of six, during a busy service, and the staff were attentive and accommodating.",5,2021,10,31
203,Afternoon tea at the Gallery,Amazing service and food in the Gallery for my Mam's Birthday. We were absolutely stuffed and the vegetarian options were amazing. Marta and Elizabeth made it so special! Lovely setting and atmosphere.,5,2021,10,30
203,Perfect spot for out honeymoon,"This hotel really knocked it out of the park in every way. Location, Amenities, and of course hospitality. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Made for the perfect Dublin experience with location and surrounding pubs.",5,2021,10,28
203,Excellent Service,"Excellent Location. Excellent Service. Rooms cozy, not big but sufficient.
I got an issue with the shower water pressure but was brilliantly solved by Guest Relations Manager, good service recovery. So overall excellent 5 stars hotel in the city center of Dublin.",5,2021,10,27
203,Afternoon Tea at the Gallery,"The Gallery at the Westbury is the most beautiful room in Dublin. We went for afternoon tea and it was delicious. The sandwiches and scones are exceptional. 

We were served by Martat and Louis, service was perfect. 

The autumnal cakes are a little heavy for me but that's common for pecan pies and such. ",5,2021,10,25
203,The Wilde Restaurant,"Gorgeous experience at the Wilde Restaurant, beautiful food and our service was extremely friendly and helpful especially our waiter Brendan O‚Äô Toole. Brendan made us feel extremely welcome and provided a great service. Thank you.",5,2021,10,23
203,Can improve,"Just returned from a one night stay here with my wife. We have probably stayed here at least 20 times over the last few years. For some reason, the room we received on this visit was not very good at all and it totally out of keeping with the other rooms in the hotel. Location of hotel is excellent and staff are excellent, hence, this is why we have stayed here so often. The reality is that if you are trying to decide to stay either here or The Merrion, there is no doubt that the Merrion is a better all round hotel but the advantage the Westbury has is that the location is just so good. Hopefully; when we return next time, we get a nicer room and the bathroom in the room we had was more in keeping with Jury‚Äôs Inn than the Westbury !",4,2021,10,23
203,Afternoon Tea at The Gallery,"The afternoon tea experience at The Gallery was excellent. We felt very safe with the Covid compliance, and hand sanitiser was readily available. The choice of menus was brilliant as it includes a vegan and vegetarian menu. 
The best part by far was the service. We had the pleasure of being served by Felicia. She was so efficient and completely accommodated to any of our dietary requirements. She offered us recommendations and was so friendly and helpful. We felt like she looked after us and was very mindful of any of our requests.",5,2021,10,23
203,Go for afternoon  tea at The Gallery. What a treat!,Spent a few lovely hours at The Gallery having afternoon tea with my daughters. Everything was perfect. We went for the vegetarian option. The food was delicious. A special mention has to go to our server Kim who made the experience for us. He was exceptional.,5,2021,10,23
203,Good on the basics. Lacks attention to detail. Keeps being inconsistent.,"Stayed a few times in the past at the Westbury and never wasn't a big fan because services has been very inconsistent.  This time stayed 2 nights earlier in the week mainly becauase was co-hosting a lunch for 20 clients jointly with the CEO of the company I work for.  He was staying at the Westbury, the client event was taking place at the hotel so was very convenient to stay here.  Convenience was the main driver of my decision to use this hotel.  Below a summary of my experience:

Pros: nice newly renovated room, good wifi, very friendly staff in general, clean, you feel safe in Covid times, very nice bar and restaurant,  location is great., 

Areas to improve
Check in - arrived very late in the evening on Oct 20th.  The lady who was checking me in gives me a form for me to fill-in with my details (address, phone, etc) I gave her my business card to staple to the form......all the details are in the business card..... and.this is something I do always on every hotel. For my shocking surprise she told me that I had to complete the form myself, in handwriting. She didn't accept the business card and didn't  staple to the form.  Never happened before on any other hotel.

Check in - the same person who was checking me in asked if it was my first time at the hotel. It wasn't. Stayed many times. In every hotel where I'm regular guest, they have a client profile and they know if you're returning and hence greeted with a ""welcome back"". I also wonder how the hotel rewards loyalty. 

Room clean - at check in, was asked if I wanted my room cleaned daily (was told that due to covid they have to ask, was is absolutely fine). Responded positively. I wanted my room cleaned. On my first day, when back to my room in the early evening I saw that bed was done and towels changed.....but the tray from my room service dinner from the evening before and a cup of capuiccino which I ordered for breakfast were left dirty in the room.  The bin by the desk not emptied,  the bin at the toilet not emptied, the area around the espresso machine not cleaned, the toilet not cleaned.  Really, but really bad.  I really don't get it. Removing a used room service tray is really basic, and also why are you asking guests if they want the room cleaned if then you don't clean it properly.

All the above and what for me is lack of attention to details is what differentiates a very good or excellent hotel from a simply good or average one. Need to be in Dublin again in 3 weeks time, and really not sure if will stay at The Westbury.",3,2021,10,23
203,Beautiful Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"I would recommend the Westbury to those business or leisure travelers used to staying in boutique hotels in large cities or those accustom to the JW Marriott/Ritz Carlton level hotels.  The linens were high quality, bedding superb, and the property was highly maintained.  The best part of the hotel was the service and friendliness of the staff.  There was nothing they would not do to assist. 5 Stars from me.",5,2021,10,22
203,Westbury Stay October 2021,"Very comfortable, clean, hotel with great restaurants but their true benefit is their staff. They will always make you feel welcome and looked after, no matter who you deal with. In terms of location and immediate access to all that Dublin has to offer, in my opinion The Westbury is the clear winner.",5,2021,10,21
203,Afternoon Tea at the Gallery,"Definitely the best afternoon tea I've had.

The food was amazing, part of our group was vegan and their menu and food was on par, if not better, than the regular menu. 
The tea was superb, some of the best quality I've tasted.

To tie it all together, the server, Felicia, was friendly and helpful and really made the entire experience a joy. 

I loved it so much I'm taking a friend there for her birthday next month.",5,2021,10,18
203,A memorable time,"I usually spend a night with a friend every year and this year was outstandingüëçfrom the minute we arrived, we were treated so well. Attention to detail and the professionalism of staff was top motch.
Well done to all",5,2021,10,18
203,Disappointing,"Very nice staff, excellent location, very very disappointing room. Definitely paying for the location as it is very expensive compared to other Dublin hotels. The room was very dated, very small, and a bit shabby overall. ",3,2021,10,17
203,Afternoon tea at the Gallery,"I very recently brought my Sister to the Gallery for afternoon tea as a birthday treat.  I can certainly recommend the experience.  The variety of food and the attention to detail by the staff was exceptional.  The Lady who  attended to us  (Martha) on arrival and checked in with us through out our stay was both professional, friendly and extremely courteous . I would highly recommend this experience to all.

203,Best afternoon tea in Dublin,"We had afternoon tea for my wife‚Äôs birthday at the Westbury, it was absolutely delightful, the food was delicious and the service was second to none. A big thank you to Felicia who took great care of us and even brought out a birthday cake as a surprise. You couldn‚Äôt ask for more. Highly recommended.",5,2021,10,13
203,Afternoon Tea,"Beautiful afternoon tea Tuesday 12th October 2021 in The Gallery at the Westbury Hotel.  Thank you Georgia for making our experience so special.  The food was delicious and we drank pots and pots of tea, Coffee and a few cappuccinos.  Such a lovely treat considering all we have been through with covid.  So good to feel relaxed, welcomed and indulged in the hotels beautiful setting.   Our only regret is that we weren't staying overnight.  Compliments to all your staff.  Highly recommend everyone has this experience at least once every month.  Total escapism.  The Ireland of a ""thousand welcomes"" is truly alive at the Westbury.  Can't wait to return.",5,2021,10,13
203,Afternoon Tea in The Gallery,"Fantastic afternoon tea in The Gallery with the beautiful Georgia looking after us. Food was amazing, tea selection was delicious and the champagne made it extra special. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for more or better. Loved it! Would definitely recommend.",5,2021,10,12
203,Go for the grub stay for the fabulous staff,"I brought my mother to The Gallery for afternoon tea for her birthday. We both had the most wonderful time. We were looked after by the lovely Felicia who was so warm and kind. She looked after us so so well, and made my mother's birthday extra special. She was wonderfully attentive and an absolute credit to the company. I hope they know and appreciate how wonderful and kind she is.
The food was delicious as were the cocktails.  The setting was opulent and so welcoming.
My mother was treated to an extra special birthday cake which was a lovely touch and much appreciated.
 And while the food and setting was fabulous and you would come back for it, it was the staff that made the experience as pleasurable as it was.
Thank you Felicia you were fabulous.",5,2021,10,11
203,Not a Suite experience,If you require 200 characters you have clearly not read through my survey submission. However if more is required I suggest staff and management much training is really needed particularily in the hygiene and cleaning departments.  I believe this establishment is capable of much better.,2,2021,10,11
203,Weekend break in Dublin,Amazing from arrival to departure. Best hotel in Dublin with fantastic staff and in the best location just off Grafton Street. Food was fabulous and nothing was too much trouble to all the amazing staff. Well done and keep it up ,5,2021,10,11
203,"Nice stay, disappointing breakfast","Nice stay, very nice hotel. Disappointing breakfast. Over cooked eggs and slow service only seated 20 mins after our reserved slot. I would have returned it if I hadn't already eaten other parts and we were already tight for checkout with the delay getting seated and served. The continental plate and other cooked parts were very nice.",4,2021,10,11
203,"Amazing staff, tired interiors & dreadful shower.","The Westbury is a beautiful hotel, that is situated perfectly to discover Dublin just off Grafton St.
The entrance is very grand & the staff are exceptional.
Unfortunately our room was much smaller than I expected & the intteriors were very tired & in desperate need of a refresh - the headboard of the bed was greasy & the fabric was damaged.
For a 5* hotel I would expect the shower to be the best, unfortunately ours was little more than a dribble & meant there was no way I could wash my hair & just about managed a wash - it reminded me of taking a shower when camping certainly not a luxury hotel! ",3,2021,10,11
203,Wont be back,"Myself and my husband stayed here on Saturday 2nd October. Overall it was very disappointing.
The room was ok, nothing to write home about and the experience in the hotel was not a 5 star service. My husband and I had to queue to get into the bar for a pre dinner drink, we were left queuing again after dinner to get back in. As far as I could see there is an awful lot of people not staying in the hotel frequenting the bar/gallery and there is no priority given to people staying at the hotel. We eventually got a table in The Gallery and experienced some very rude service while waiting for drinks for about 30minutes.
When we went back up to our room the TV wouldn't work and were told maintenance were working on it. Looking at other reviews the issue with the TVs might be ongoing. We wont be back, you pay the extra little bit for good service and unfortunately we didn't get it.",1,2021,10,11
203,Very Coeliac friendly - will definitely be back!,"Had our first dinner in Wilde at the weekend and was so impressed with everything. Lovely surroundings & the food and service was superb. Our waiter Brendan went out of his way to make sure that everything I had was Coeliac friendly, was extremely courteous and efficient & certainly added to the enjoyment of the evening.
Would certainly highly recommend Wilde as a place to go for anyone who has dietery issues and I will definitely be returning.",5,2021,10,10
203,First Class Experience - Afternoon Tea in The Gallery Room @ The Westbury,"A friend and I took afternoon tea this weekend as a pandemic-emerging treat and it was such a glorious experience. We got to try their recently launched Autumn afternoon tea menu with seasonal cakes, as well as scones, plus unlimited sandwiches, tea and coffees. So you can try out a few tea varieties which is fun. The Irish Whiskey tea is a real winner in particular (Baileys taste). 

Our service was looked after by the fabulous Felicia who was so attentive, respectful, warm and genuine and her professional yet relaxed attitude made our visit even more special. 

Thanks for looking after us! 

When you work hard, this is the sort of experience that makes it worth it.",5,2021,10,10
203,Afternoon tea,"Gorgeous experience at afternoon tea on Sunday afternoon in the Gallery of the Westbury. Fabulous setting and delicious food. Served by Marta who was very attentive and friendly, and went the extra mile",5,2021,10,04
203,Excellent service on The Gallery.,My partner and I were seeking a quiet location to enjoy a cup of coffee in City Center and chose to visit The Gallery. Miss Marta T. greeted us warmly and provided us with a table with a stunning view and an enticing breakfast buffet. The service and meal were both excellent.,5,2021,10,04
203,Best afternoon tea,Had a fabulous day in the Westbury having a gorgeous afternoon tea served by Martha T. From start to finish Marta T looked after us so well. The food was lovely and she couldnt have been more attentive. We were offered an excellent selection of sandwiches and a great top up of tea and coffee. Thank you,5,2021,10,03
203,Perfect Afternoon Tea,"We‚Äôd be waiting to visit the Westbury for Afternoon Tea for a long time and it did not disappoint! Thank you Marta for your fantastic service! Nothing was too big an ask, from offering a variety of teas to taking multiple photographs to kindly swapping out our sandwiches. The food itself was impeccable and the ambiance was lovely and relaxing. Marta even brought out an extra treat to celebrate my friend‚Äôs new job. Thank you so much, we can‚Äôt wait to return :)",5,2021,10,03
203,"Nice hotel, but star rating is questionable.","Checked in online, gave credit card details for deposit, and opted in to charging  any extras to my card. The online check in said go to the key pick up desk at the hotel. No such desk exists, I had to go to the regular check in desk, and provide all the same information again and give them my credit card again, basically check in from scratch.

Went for a drink then and had to stand in a queue to get into the bar, for about 10-15mins which seems a bit odd for a 5 star hotel. The service inside the bar itself was outstanding.

Then went for dinner in Balfes which was very nice, and then back to the bar, but again had to join a queue, after standing for 10-15mins we asked could we sit somewhere else as the queue hadn't moved at all, we were brought to a table in the gallery, but nobody came to take our order after 15 mins, my wife had to go find a server and ask for a drink to be brought down, 15 mins later after asking again and getting some attitude the drinks arrived, so it takes about 45mins to get a drink. We asked to be re-seated in the bar, where again the service was very good once you can get into it.
Queueing to get into a bar was something I'd thought I'd left behind in my early 20's, certainly not what I'd expect to do when staying at a supposedly 5 star hotel. 

Then the TV in the room wouldn't turn off or change channel, the remote didn't seem to work, we called reception and asked for batteries, but we're told it was a know issue across the hotel. I can't understand how a hotel wide issue could stop a TV from turning off or changing channel, but I just plugged it out rather than argue the point.

At breakfast the next morning both the food and service were outstanding.

Overall I'd rate it as a good 4 star hotel, charging good 5 star hotel prices. If there's availability I would recommend the Merrion, which is where I'd normally stay. 
If the bar was full in the Merrion and they couldn't accommodate guests, I think they would apologise, seat and serve the guests somewhere else and notify them when a table was available, not leave them standing for indefinite periods.",3,2021,10,03
203,Lovely hotel missing the mark,"The room was clean and spacious with easy access to the Luas red line however, 2 request that I made were not fulfilled.  I requested cream for my coffee at breakfast and they had none. I walked 2 doors up and bought cream. I also asked for an early breakfast for a redeye flight and I was offered a muffin.  I would expect better  from a 4 star hotel.",4,2021,10,02
203,Poor reflection on the management,"Unfortunately the Westbury is letting itself down on the most basic of services. I booked a large suite at a rate of ‚Ç¨615 for one night, the rate is not an issue but the TV did not work and the mini bar was locked even though they took a ‚Ç¨200 deposit from a debit and credit card on top of the ‚Ç¨615, again the money is not an issue. I requested room service and got offered a ham and cheese sandwich or salmon. The 3 star  service  has to be a reflection of the management.",3,2021,09,29
203,Very disappointing beverage choice‚Ä¶.,"We dropped into the Westbury for a pre-lunch drink on Thursday 23rd September. All our Covid documentation was checked and we were shown to a table in the lounge. 
We were initially shocked to find that it wasn‚Äôt possible to have a standard Gordon‚Äôs G&T because the hotel doesn‚Äôt stock Gordon‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ they have a ‚Äògin cocktail‚Äô menu ‚Ä¶. priced accordingly‚Ä¶.
Our next shock came when I asked about the beers and stout available on draught‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I was told Heineken, Guinness and an IPA‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Now, for a five star hotel this meagre choice is very poor. The ‚Äòother‚Äô five star hotel close by on Stephen‚Äôs Green has a very good choice in draught beers and also serve a lovely Gordon‚Äôs and Schweppes‚Ä¶..
In any event, we left the Westbury, disappointed. What a shame.
I did email the hotel group, but nobody had the courtesy to email me back.",2,2021,09,28
203,Afternoon Tea at The Gallery,"Five star treatment from Felicia for our afternoon tea at the Gallery in the Westbury. Gorgeous setting, great service and vibrant atmosphere. A special thank you to Felicia for organising a complimentary dessert for two from our group- a birthday and a retirement- even singing happy birthday! Thank you for a brilliant experience.",5,2021,09,26
203,An afternoon well spent! ,"We enjoyed a lovely afternoon at The Gallery on Friday. They offer an afternoon tea which looked great but we are savoury people so opted for wine and cheese, which was delicious! The setting is stunning and the service was exceptional, big thanks to Marta T. She brought my grandfather a complimentary dessert to welcome him back to the Westbury, this nice touch was greatly appreciated. 5 stars! ",5,2021,09,26
203,Awesome Afternoon Tea experience in The Westbury.,"We booked afternoon tea for a birthday treat and from the moment we were met  by Kim at the desk we knew we were in for something special.

Beautiful food in gorgeous surroundings and the most amazing staff mead this a memorable experience.

Felicia Alannah Marta Julien (salut!) and Sarah ensured that everything was just perfect and arranged additional sandwiches for us during our two hours in The Gallery. I cannot recommend this experience highly enough. Having visited the Westbury on many occasions over the last 30 years its wonderful to see that this hotels customer service standards has remained so high. Thank you all!!

203,Afternoon tea - amazing experience in Dublin City Centre,"We booked afternoon tea in the Gallery on a Sunday evening.

So lovely to see the hotel buzzing again.

The afternoon tea experience was exceptional from the 3 tier cake stands to the delicious pastries. We were amazed that the hit with our kids were the scones!

The pastries, sandwiches, scones, and tea were so delicious.  But the best part was the exemplary service provided by Felicia.

WOW - it was amazing!!!!!  I have been to quite a lot of hotels for Afternoon Tea and this is by far the best ever.  The hotel is stunning, the room you have Afternoon Tea is gorgeous.  All the staff that we spoke to were lovely and very informative and the food was out of this world, they even gave both of us a special chocolate cake for our birthdays, which was a lovely touch.

Very clean, staff very friendly, especially at reception and during the breakfast. I‚Äôm not a breakfast person, but it was very tasty and well presented. Coffee very good too.

We dined in Balfes our first night , a dining experience which could not be faulted . The food was superb as was the service .The central location , a stone throw from restaurants , shops and trendy bars , is ideal especially if you are not familiar with the city . The efficient and prompt nature of staff make for a comfortable visit , especially  after a long trip . A wonderful experience which was enjoyed by all . The only complaint , we didn‚Äôt stay longer . ",5,2021,09,05

Worth every cent, really enjoyed our visit & would love to return again.",5,2021,09,01
203,Best hotel experience in Dublin,"We chose The Westbury because The Shelbourne was full, and so glad we did. The Shelbourne was very nice but we will now always stay at The Westbury. The hotel has a great feel as you walk in, the entire staff provide a warm environment. From check in to departure our stay was seamless. Lunch at Balfe's was great and the daily breakfast at Wilde was outstanding. A special shout out to Eddie and his concierge team. He recommended and booked great restaurants and arranged all of our transportation and he did it with ease. Since I was organizing for our group of 8 friends, he made my life so easy. I should also mention the location is perfect as the front door opens out to Grafton St. and the sidecar bar was great for before and after dinner gatherings",5,2021,09,01
203,Delicious afternoon tea ,I recently had afternoon tea with my mum and we though it was absolutely brilliant. Felicia looked after us brilliantly and was very attentive and made the experience very enjoyable.

203,Elegance and Comfort with Top-Notch Service,"We chose the Westbury for its central location - walking distance to the heart of Dublin's pub and shopping.

203,Afternoon Tea at The Gallery - An amazing experience,We had an amazing time at the Gallery for afternoon tea. 4 of us went to celebrate our 15-year friendship and it was a wonderful experience.

203,Afternoon delight ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è,"I had the most superb experience at afternoon tea at the westbury hotel today. Having recently experienced afternoon tea at another 5 star hotel in Dublin, I can honestly say this was far superior and exceeded my expectations in every way. From the delicious (and unlimited) hot drinks, gourmet sandwiches and scones to the excellent service from the fabulous Felicia, myself and my husband left feeling well fed and watered. They go the extra mile at the westbury and we will definitely return!",5,2021,08,27
203,Wonderful place. Certainly coming back!,Had a delicious dinner party with my friends at Westury's Balfes restaurant. Food was 10/10. Service was extraordinary. Afterwards we went upstairs to Gallery restaurant for a drink. We were greeted by Ieva (really lovely and helpful lady) who went extra mile and arranged us the table next to a window. Really enjoyed the whole experience and surroundings. +cocktails were superb!,5,2021,08,26
203,High tea,"Had an incredible high tea on Saturday expertly waited on by the lovley Marta T who was fantastic.
The food was delicious and the experience was great. The atmosphere was very relaxing and it was the perfect way to start the wedding celebrations! 
Thank you",5,2021,08,25
203,Certainly not 5 star!!!,"As you can see from our previous reviews, we have stayed in many a 4 and 5 star hotels around the world and this one is certainly no where close to 5 star!! 

From start to finish the whole experience was a farce!! Their is an air of arrogance about the whole place especially from the mainly Non Irish staff! 

GOOD
Central Location 
Large room (Family 2 x Queen Beds)

BAD
Arrogant, rude none customer friendly staff especially in the dinning areas 
OTT Covid rules that once you are in a function room seem to fall by the wayside
Dinning reservations not upheld
2 x none working irons
1 x none working ironing board
Half eaten dried manage packet left in the lamp shade of the standard light
Noisy rooms from 12-4am (Hen party like)
Can‚Äôt sit down and relax without making a reservation
Can‚Äôt just come down for a drink without having a reservation 
Turned away from the bar twice even though seats were available 
Air Con absolutely useless! 
Fan supplied wouldn‚Äôt stand up without a table to lean against! 
Room key reset 3 times in 15mins! 

As you can see the above evidences quite clearly that the Westbury is far from 5 star especially at ¬£400+ per night!! 

Wouldn‚Äôt recommend!
Wouldn‚Äôt  revisit!

This hotel has left us not wishing to revisit Dublin (and this was our first visit!)",1,2021,08,23
203,Great afternoon tea experience,"We had a really nice afternoon tea experience, our waitress Felicia was amazingly welcoming and make the experience even better. Nice food and a great amount of options for everybody. Really good experience. The location of the place is great in the middle of Dublin and the surroundings were good to continue having a great evening.",5,2021,08,22
203,Gorgeous!,"Great location by the Greens shopping district and park. Very vibrant area of the city. Rooms were beautiful and well appointed, albeit a little on the smaller side, but this is a European city hotel, so what one would expect. Restaurants were phenomenal, great staff and the attention detail was outstanding! Highly recommend the Westbury in Dublin.",5,2021,08,22
203,"Superb Afternoon Tea at The Westbury, Dublin","To celebrate our son's upcoming wedding to his childhood sweetheart, my wife and I, along with our two boys, their partners, and our two nieces from Texas who are over here in Ireland for the wedding, all went to The Westbury Hotel in Dublin for Afternoon Tea today, Saturday. I have to say that it was a truely superb experience from start to finish. A very warm welcome, great attention all through the Tea, and really excellent food - a good variety of fresh sandwiches , scones with jam and clotted cream, and lovely desserts. We had an unlimited supply of beverages - several kinds of coffees,  a huge choice of teas, and of course whatever kind of alcohol you wanted. But best of all was the service, and a special mention to Marta T - nothing was a problem for her, or for her team. What a great experience, we will definitely be back! Well done to all at The Westbury!!",5,2021,08,21
203,Outstanding,"Dublin's finest hotel, superior in every way, the rooms, food, amenities and customer service. It is centrally located giving you access to all that Dublin has to offer. Try a dinner in Wilde's, or a cocktail in The Sidecar or just relax in your room, highly recommended.",5,2021,08,18
203,The Westbury's reputation is well-deserved,"The Westbury is a traditional five-star hotel with great service in the heart of Dublin close to Trinity College, Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green. Everything about it is exactly what you'd expect from a city hotel of this caliber, including fantastic cuisine. The streets around the hotel can be a little tricky to navigate, as some are pedestrian-only, so it's best to get directions ahead of time or have the doorman/valet park your car for you (as we did). In short, this is a great property in a fantastic location.",5,2021,08,18
203,Amazing,The hotel and the team are just amazing. The rooms are spacious with an amazing view to the Grafton Street. Breakfast is sumptuous and the team are caring. Would highly recommend The Westbury hotel for staying in Dublin. ,5,2021,08,15
203,Excellent traditional service at Westbury,"I wanted to write to say that the level of service at this hotel is astonishing‚Ä¶.. it‚Äôs it akin to yesteryear!!!

We will be back!!",5,2021,08,14
203,FIVE STARS! The most amazing hotel experience!,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights after we got married and it was the most special and classy hotel to start our honeymoon!

On arrival we were checked in immediately by the very friendly and helpful Miguel. 

Our room was the most beautiful hotel room that we had ever stayed in, never mind the incredible view and being able to see Grafton street from our massive window!  

Lucas with guest relations made our time there especially memorable and checked in with us on different occasions to make sure we were enjoying our stay. He is such a gentleman and made my husband and I feel so at home and taken care of! Thank you Lucas!! 

It was such a dream stay! We only wish we could have stayed longer in the Westbury!",5,2021,08,14
203,Beautiful Wrstbury,"We decided to visit Grafton St after Lockdown and walked past Westbury. Always wanted to visit but thought only for rich and famous but casually having a chat with friendly doorman who checked availability and got me and wife a seat in gallery.
wow, I was blown away with beautiful gallery, delicious meal and ambience.
Thank you Kevin for introducing us to this new world. We have now decided to book a night for our anniversary.
On our way out we bumped into Kevin again laughing and joking with a tall gentleman.
Great to see Westbury colleagues enjoying their jobs.
Thank you again Westbury and Kevin and Martha for treating us like V.I.PS.
Regards
Dave and Caroline",5,2021,08,12
203,Afternoon Treat,"I posted a review which TripAdvisor seems to have deleted on me so I am posting again! 

Had afternoon tea here after an overnight stay back in June for Fathers Day and could not fault a single thing. 

We were looked after by Felicia, who always takes care of our table when we have our annual family breakfast every Christmas Eve. The Westbury, don‚Äôt ever let her go!!! 

The food was incredible, we took some desserts home with us as the portions were so generous but it was lovely to have some later on in the evening. 

In terms of current restrictions, we felt very safe, the hotel is spotless as always and we had no issues at all. 

We had a wonderful day and will be back very soon!",5,2021,08,11
203,A convert,"I usually stay at the Merrion or Shelbourne - but after my first experience with The Westbury I think that might change 

great rooms, amazing service, maybe missing a bit of the character that comes with the above mentioned but more than make up for it ",5,2021,08,10
203,Honeymoon started right. ,"We started off our honeymoon in the Westbury, and it was a great choice. Lucas in particular made us feel like celebrities, and really made our stay there.
We arrived to a lovely note and gifts in the amazing room, and we left to coffee, pastries and a ready taxi to take us to the airport at 5am.
Hard to express in words how grateful we are, but we wanted to try. ",5,2021,08,10
203,Top Class City Centre Hotel,"Had a lovely time with the Family back at the Westbury. Everything from check in to check out was as expected. Smiles on all the staff faces and top quality accommodation, food and drink. Always our choice when we want to relax in the city centre",5,2021,08,10
203,5 star experience at the Westbury.,"We stayed at the Westbury the night before and the night of our wedding. We live locally in Dublin and were getting married in Dundrum, so it was a special treat to also have a staycation at the Westbury. We would highly recommend it. We loved everything. The food, the friendly concierge, our room, the helpful staff. We couldn‚Äôt have enjoyed it more ",5,2021,08,09
203,Beautiful Afternoon Tea Experience,"Wonderful afternoon tea experience in The Westbury. Delicious and plentiful food, very attentive and friendly staff, beautiful surroundings. Our server Felicia was an excellent hostess. All perfectly socially distanced and mindful of Covid-19 regulations. Would highly recommend and will definitely be back.",5,2021,08,09
203,Unhappy with Balfes,"Hotel should be more clear on menu available if booking the package (stay with 3 course meal).

The menu we were given was not the normal menu as seen on the website, but a slimmed down version with very little options.

The hotel should be more clear on the menus available if booking a package which includes meals.",3,2021,08,08
203,Afternoon tea,It was great to be back at the Gallery for afternoon tea. Marta T really looked after us. All the Covid regulations were clear. The food & ambience at the Westbury were as lovely as ever. Will be back again soon.,4,2021,08,07
203,Family time,"We stayed for three nights and then our family joined us for the remaining two nights.
On arrival Eddie and Aidan parked our car and our luggage was all looked after. Both are very friendly but Eddie has a fantastic personality and really made us welcome.
We checked in with Ciara who was very friendly.
We treated ourselves to afternoon tea, the staff serving were excellent and we sampled many iced and hot teas along with the lovely sandwiches, scones and pastries.
We were lucky enough to be given a lovely window seat with a lovely view of the street below.
Our room 509 was very nice and spotlessly clean. My family were in rooms next to ours.
Breakfast was very good. Plenty of choice and staff were friendly.
We dined in Balfes on two evenings and the food was really good. Again very good service from Hayley and Florrie.
Overall the location of The Westbury is amazing, so central to everything.
We enjoyed cocktails that John made  on our second day which were lovely.
Rebecca checked us out and was very nice. 
The car park is 25 euros per night but worth all the hassle of looking for a space and the car is very safe. 
We had a great stay and loved every minute. ",5,2021,08,07
203,Dolores,"Stayed on The Westbury lately for a 
Weekend break , was very disappointed with the room 
Quite outdated and not much off a view quite disappointed as we have paid extra for a room with a view. BUT !! The staff in this hotel totally made up for the disappointment, every member off staff from start to finish were exceptional, could not do enough , The food in Balfes absolutely delicious, Great location for exploring the surrounding areas , But really it‚Äôs üíØthe staff in this hotel that is keeping The Westbury in business üëèüëèüëè",4,2021,08,07
203,Tea for two!,Afternoon tea at The Westbury -  what a lovely way to catch up with a dear friend.  The friendly and smiling Felicia could not have been more attentive to our every need.  Look forward to returning soon.,5,2021,08,07
203,A Night in The Westbury,"Excellent service from start to finish. Staff were extremely attentive to our needs. Rooms spotlessly clean. Great location for anyone visiting Dublin. Kevin, the parking valet was a very pleasant & friendly man. Would certainly recommend this hotel.",5,2021,08,03
203,Very disappointed,"We visited Westbury for  the first time this August Bank Holiday weekend.  We normally stay in other 5 Star hotels in the city centre and had heard good things about the Westbury. The location is fabulous for a shopping break and this informed our choice.  The disappointment started from check in.  When we were given our room ( king room) I asked whether it had a stand alone shower in the bathroom .  A reception manageress informed the lady checking me in that the only room available to us with a shower that was not over the bath, was an ‚Äòaccessible‚Äô room.  We were disappointed with this and refused.  Our room - which was a standard room- was tiny.   It overlooked the back of buildings which was understandable I suppose and the view could most certainly been overlooked but the whole style of the room was dated.  The bathroom had - as I mentioned- a bath on one wall and single sink on the other.  Toiletries were in a paper bag .  There was no shower cap provided . I asked at the front desk later in the day and was handed one by receptionist .   As you can see from the pictures the room furnishings showed wear and tear which to be honest took from the luxury experience.  We took the stairs often as lifts often busy.  The stairwell was also in shabby condition with fraying of carpet. Although this was not the main route for most guests many of us used it.   The food, drinks and service was fabulous in all areas and the staff were certainly 5 star .  I have seen the hotel featured online and on social media but the rooms that are shown being stayed in are certainly nothing like the room we were given.  There is obviously a huge difference in quality in different room types and perhaps you need to book a suite in order to be sure of a refurbished room.  Even the fact that the room was so tiny could have been overlooked by us but not the ‚Äòtattered finery‚Äô.  The hotel was 60% full we were told ( as per Covid conditions) but our room was not made up until 3.30 one of the days.  All in all I‚Äôm afraid our next visit will be to a different hotel in the city.  I re iterate that the staff and service were terrific but the place badly needs an upgrade . With so much competition in the 5 star market there is plenty of choice. We came away unfortunately very disappointed.",3,2021,08,02
203,Afternoon tea at the Gallery,Had a fantastic birthday celebration afternoon tea with my wife and kids.  Both Marta T and Mia made us feel really welcome and the service was fantastic.  Great way to spend the afternoon enjoying great food and beautiful surroundings. Kids afternoon tea menu was a real hit!,5,2021,08,02
203,5 star service,"We had a fabulous stay in the Westbury. Everyone treated us so well. Our room was beautiful and we really appreciated the treats on arrival for our wedding anniversary. We had afternoon tea in The Gallery and Marta T took great care of us! Nothing was too much trouble. Dinner in Wilde was equally delicious, followed by amazing cocktails in the Sidecar! Thanks for a wonderful stay!",5,2021,08,02
203,The Gallery at The Westbury,"Myself and my family went for food. It was a celebration which we only mentioned in passing to our waitress Martha T but she brought us a surprise cake with ‚Äòcongratulations‚Äô written on it. The food was so delicious, every very friendly and I felt very safe given the times we‚Äôre living in.",5,2021,08,01

203,"Lovely stay, great service and amazing food!",We stayed on the 28th of July to celebrate my 30th and throughout our stay we couldn‚Äôt be more satisfied with the service and how the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcomed. The room was impecable. Especially thanks to Felicia for the incredible service during the afternoon tea!,5,2021,07,29
203,Monday Night Stay. ,"Having  booked a mid-week stay for just one night, to attend some city appointments,  we didn't expect too much interaction with the hotel.
Far from that was our experience, from the beginning to the end of our short stay, we found all staff attentive, mannerly and always seeking to offer help if required. Notably Sarah at reception, Hayley in the restaurant Balfes and the two or three gentlemen that met us at the main entrance whom helped us with car parking etc.
We dined for Dinner in Balfes. Just perfect nothing to add. A real credit to all those involved here.
Breakfast was served In Wildes and it was  excellent.
Eggs Benedict served and prepared properly.
Delicious.
Our room was spotless,  quiet,  spacious and the bed was comfortable.
The hotel was  busy. But any controls need for covid adherance were discretely organised through  what appeared to be for staff, normal everyday business. With very well managed seating and cleaning ongoing quietly in the background. Well done for that.
",5,2021,07,28
203,Great experience,"We had a beautiful lunch in The Westbury to celebrate a special occasion. We were lucky enough to have Felicia attending our table. She went above and beyond and made a special occasion, even more special! What an asset she is to the Westbury team. Loved every minute of it!",5,2021,07,28
203,Afternoon tea,"Beautiful experience at the Gallery for afternoon tea. Service by Marta was excellent. Tea trays were stunning and we were offered unlimited refills of teas, coffees, sandwiches and scones- if we could fit them in! The gallery offers a vegetarian/vegan/gluten free option and the option to swap out any sandwiches you do not like for ones of your choosing. Myself, my mom and sister found the entire staff very accommodating and we would not hesitate to go back.",5,2021,07,28
203,Wonderful stay!,"My family and I recently stayed here to mark a special occasion as a party of four adults. The valet service was super efficient so thank you as that was one less worry for me regarding parking. Check-in was efficient. Our rooms were well appointed and what we would expect of a 5-star hotel. Covid-19 mitigation measures were clearly visible and adhered to. The location of the hotel is extremely central which was super handy for our shopping appointment in Brown Thomas. We had lunch in Balfes and were served by Isabella who was very welcoming and super efficient. We also had dinner in the restaurant in the evening which was lovely. All the staff were really nice and went above and beyond for us. Breakfast was superb. Check-out was no-fuss - sorry, I can't remember the staff member's name but he was really efficient. We look forward to returning again.",5,2021,07,27
203,Great Dublin location,We finished our travels in Ireland at the Westbury. The location off of Grafton Street was great for exploring.  The staff were eager and tried to be helpful but we did feel that there may have been some shortages in staffing as we had to wait a bit each time at the desk. We also did not have a room with good air flow or air conditioning for the heat unusually in Ireland. They did provide a cooling fan but other rooms seemed to have more effective conditioning. Room decor was a bit sterile (we previously were at the Merrion which had a lot more character). This felt more corportate.  Food was plentiful and good but not excellent however met our expectations overall.,4,2021,07,26
203,Beautiful and spacious with friendly staff,"We had a wonderful time staying here ü§ó The staff were all very welcoming and helpful throughout our stay. Our room - Luxury Studio Suite - was beautifully designed and spacious enough for the kids to set up a play areaüéâThe breakfast was delicious and Balfes also has a nice selection of food, but our favourite place was the stunning Gallery ü§óüíïü§©we loved the ice cream & chocolate tart! Our favourite part of the stay was the adorable teddies and colouring books that the kids got ü§ó We also loved being able to pop back to the hotel a few times a day to drop off shopping and freshen up. It really is in an amazing location - right on Grafton Street! Thank you for assisting us throughout our stay and ensuring we had a wonderful time. We will be back soon ü§ó",5,2021,07,25
203,Stayed for 1 night,"Stayed for 1 night and was surprised at how professional the staff was. Very polite, friendly and helpful, especially those in the Sidecar, Wilde and the Gallery (Felicia, Marta). 

The hotel appeared to be very complaint for Covid-19 which relieved any concerns for us.

Thank you and will look forward to visiting again in future, even just for Wilde or the Gallery.",5,2021,07,17

203,Amazing anniversary treat.,"Stayed for 2 days in the beautiful Westbury Hotel. From the second we pulled up to the door until the moment we went home it was a beautiful experience. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, room was esquisite and the food was amazing. The meal in the Balfe restaurant was amazing and breakfast in wildes was exactly what you needed to start your day.
The location is so central to all the shops and attractions in Dublin. There was not a single thing I could fault through the whole stay. We felt safe and all the Covid regs were fully complied with. I cannot wait to come back in September for another fabulous stay xxxx",5,2021,07,13
203,*5 star service from Felicia @ The Gallery.,"I was served afternoon tea by Felicia and all I can say is wow. Top service with a smile and a fantastic ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù song also üòÇüòÇ..  Felicia went above and beyond for us and looked after us really well.
Fantastic photo skills also üòä
All in all out of 10 I would rate Felica‚Äôs service today as a strong 11 üòä.",5,2021,07,11
203,Lovely stay at The Westbury,My wife and I experienced a very pleasant stay at The Westbury recently. What made our stay very relaxing and pleasant was the extremely efficient professional and pleasant staff who could not do enough to make our stay so memorable. The room was very clean and tidy and fully stocked with all our needs. The food in both restaurants was very good and the restaurant staff were very professional and pleasant. The hotel location is excellent and we would certainly stay there again.,5,2021,07,07
203,A special one night stay,"Perfect for a special occasion as made to feel genuinely welcome & constantly looked after. From valet, to door staff to reception& staff in the beautiful Sidecar cocktail bar, service was above& beyond. Special mention of Kevin at the door who was the most memorable for impeccable service, referring to us by name each time we passes & just for going the extra mile ",5,2021,07,06
203,Fantastic overnight stay,Marvelous 5-star experience right in the heart of Dublin. From booking to departure the staff at the Westbury make you feel very welcome and really at home. Service is warm and charming ensuring a very relaxing stay,5,2021,07,05
203,Wonderful lunch in The Gallery,"Excellent service from Felicia during lunch with friends in The Gallery, such calm, elegant surroundings, and very Covid safe. Felicia was very friendly, helpful, attentive and also arranged a lovely surprise birthday dessert! Thank you. When can we come back?!",5,2021,07,03
203,Feeling Special,"Myself and my husband returned this weekend,  post all the malarkey that COVID brought.  It‚Äôs our special place, where magic happened.  When we arrived  6 years ago when we pulled in to front of hotel and we were met by Derek,  who looked after the car and bags and made us feel so welcome. But do you know why we keep coming back?? Derek.. never forgets our names or faces and without a doubt has always made us feel like home‚Ä¶ 
Thank you Westbury for our home from home!!",5,2021,06,26
203,Super location,"This is a very good hotel 

- brilliant city centre location 
- ideal for Grafton street shopping
- balfes restaurant is excellent ( brilliant with allergies)
- super floor one open seating space for coffee / drinks / afternoon tea 
- friendly staff throughout the hotel 
- good standards of cleaning clearly happening throughout the day ( masks are available if you don‚Äôt have one)
- beautiful floral displays and incredible art in display  throughout the hotel 
- great rate Incl dinner in balfes on offer at the moment

On the negative side
- rooms are a little tired ( example : chairs in our room were damaged)
- service at breakfast was incredibly disorganised and slow ( we had to put in our order several times) and we didn‚Äôt get exactly what we ordered 
- could easily hear noise in nearby rooms 
- poor queue management at breakfast - no booking system in place ( which is what I‚Äôve experienced in other hotels recently )
- feels more four star than 5 star",4,2021,06,21
203,Perfect central location for a night in Dublin,"Great central location, a minutes walk from some great dublin pubs, perfect for shopping. Hotel bar is very cool (like something out of the great gatsby). The house restaurant Wilde is excellent with a great ambiance on the terrace. The hotel lounge is very comfortable also. The only downside was the aircon in the room - hard to operate which resulted in us waking during the night with the humidity.",4,2021,06,19
203,Afternoon Tea,Had Afternoon Tea with the girls in The Gallery served by the lovely Felicia. The food was amazing and service was first class. Nothing was too much for Felicia and she made a birthday so special. Highly recommended,5,2021,06,16
203,Afternoon Tea,"Have just had a wonderful afternoon tea for my 40th birthday in the Westbury hotel. The food was so tasty, the bubbles were fabulous. The staff were so kind and attentive, especially Felicia and made the experience so special with a lovely surprise dessert to celebrate my birthday, would highly recommend this experience for a special occasion",5,2021,06,16
203,Mr.,"Had a lovely weekend at the Westbury. Room was spotless. The Gallery excellent. We had a waitress Felicia who made our 5 year old granddaughter feel like a princess when she joined us for breakfast on the last morning and couldn‚Äôt be more helpful. 
Food in the Wilde restaurant was top notch. 

Paddy.",5,2021,06,14
203,Great stay,"Lovely stay, very relaxing with great service. Food and drinks were of a high standard. Dined in both the Gallery and in Wilde and would recommend both. A little on the expensive side but great to see the hotel open and serving",5,2021,06,10
203,Business ,"Checked in early and our hotel room was ready.
The front desk staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Had a wonderful stay. Ate in the Gallery and the food was delicious, again the staff were so nice and attentive . Delicious breakfast served in Wild. Thank you Tommy at the front door. Highly recommend this hotel.  At check out , I made another booking. ",5,2021,05,12
203,"Fantastic service, beautiful setting","We had a wonderful wedding night at this beautiful premises, where the staff where not only so helpful and welcoming, but made our evening more special than we expected.

Every need was met, they went above and beyond with the service and made our stay comfortable and effortless, especially since we had our baby with us
The food was exceptional, catering to our dietary requirements and room service was a pleasure.

Thank you to Tommy on the door, Miguel at the desk, Joanna in the restaurant and all the staff that served us on the night. You made our wedding day so memorable.",5,2021,05,11
203,Daughters Wedding,"I alway liked The Westbury. Had afternoon tea, dinner and drinks here on many occasions over the years. My youngest daughter had her wedding and reception here after Christmas last year and due to Covid restrictions it was limited to family only.
The staff and management were fantastic and made it special for the happy couple even with the restrictions in place. The food and accommodation were excellent but it‚Äôs the staff who can‚Äôt do enough for you who make it special.
Look forward to visiting again.",5,2021,03,14
203,Essential Service Stay During COVID 19,"I have always stayed at The Westbury - my husband chose The Westbury to propose to me.  We have had the occasion to stay in many outstanding hotels throughout the world - nothing comes close to the comfort, service, professionalism, luxury and consistency of The Westbury!",5,2021,03,09
203,An oasis in Covid,Been cocooned since St Patrick's Day so a visit for Christmas Day lunch was a special treat. The hotel did not let us down and set us up for a cocooned 2012. The. staff represent all that is good in the hospitality industry. ,5,2020,12,29
203,A Night in the Westbury,"The westbury was a beautiful hotel with a very good experience. I have been previously when I was a child with my family and felt especially at christmas, the westbury stood out the most. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful throughout our stay the room was lovely and the food was extremely outstanding. The only unfortunate downside to my stay was, for such a high price and expectations of a high quality room, our sleep was particularly dreadful. I had explained this to the staff at reception on our departure and yet again they were very helpful and kind and apologetic, I hope they have resolved this issue as it will leave an awful sleeping experience for future residents, expecting so much from and amazing room.",4,2020,12,21
203,Westbury hotel,"Simply the best hotel in Dublin, in every category, and I‚Äôve stayed in the shelbourne. Don‚Äôt hesitate to book, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Stayed with family on an overnight with dinner and breakfast.All excellent ",5,2020,12,19
203,Disappointing ,"Just returned from an overnight stay and feel slightly disappointed overall. The standard of the festive afternoon tea was very poor compared to previous years. Stale sliced pan bread was served for the sandwich selection, no brioche buns, no home baked brown bread. The desert selection was also extremely poor compared to previous years. Staff were not very attentive. Doormen were great and very courteous. Breakfast was good and waiters were very polite. When we got home we realised we left some shopping bags in the room. My mum called the hotel to explain exactly where they were left in the room and reception said someone would call back which they didn‚Äôt. She rang again to be told they weren‚Äôt there so they were asked to check again as we knew we had left them there. Another irate phone call later the bags suddenly appeared! This is not at all what I would expect from The Westbury so just felt a sour taste. ",3,2020,12,14
203,Overpriced,"Disappointed with our visit.
While the hotel lobby and Sidecar bar are lovely and full of Christmas ambiance Wilde restaurant was a let down.
How can you get steak so wrong ...twice.
There was also an issue with some sort of power cut during the night, we had no lights working in our room.
Don‚Äôt think we will be back
",3,2020,12,13
203,First Visit,"We loved the place from moment we walked in. There was a buzz and a friendly atmosphere in the lobby/check in area which was very busy. The hotel is in a very central location to shops and nightlife and current Covid precautions are very well policed and there are numerous sanitizing stations all round the hotel, in the lifts and public areas.
All staff members we encountered were very friendly and professional. The food in Wilde restaurant was excellent and plentiful. Our room (351) was smallish but very comfortable.
All in all we had a super 2 night stay with 2 breakfasts and 2 dinners in the Wilde restaurant and have no hesitation in recommending the Westbury. Will definitely be back.",5,2020,12,08
203,christmas stay  Dermot & Patricia,"just to say we had a wonderful time, and will be back, everything was very relaxed even in the current time with covid-19,  the comfort of your hotel and the staff were brilliant, in every area, from arrival we we felt the welcome, small things, on arrival, we were brought to the lift, directed were to go,. we were early and did not have to wait long, for our room to be ready. Dinner in Wildes and Drinks in the Sidecar was excellent . merry xmas to all ",5,2020,12,07
203,THE JURY IS OUT,"Slightly disappointed with our experience.
I dont feel this is a 5 star property despite the 5 star price tag.
Door men are excellent and very welcoming, restaurant and bar staff are very well trained and service is good, but something is lacking.
We had a luxury studio suite, and while it was large it needs a refurb, especially the bathroom. The bath shower combination is old school now and a suite should have a walk in shower plus a bath.
Lighting in the room needs to be addressed as the room was very dark, lots of lamps around the room but gave out very little light.
Breakfast the first morning was good but the hotel was not busy, the 2nd morning was a different story . We found it very difficult to get attention, and had to ask 3 times for coffee and tea, not what you would expect in a 5 star property.
Check out was very annoying. There was a que that extended  around to the bathroom area of the lobby, this is something you would expect in a holiday inn  in NYC .I felt the check out staff were indifferent .
Location is probably one of the best in town, but this does not make up for small details that makes an experience eceptional, and unfortunatley this was not the case for us.
I think you need yo up your game as you are falling behind.",3,2020,12,05
203,Weekend end break at the westbury Dublin. It was our wedding anniversary (23rd). The hotel is beautiful .,"Staff fantastic, yes a little pricey but worth every penny . The food was to die for in the Wilde restaurant. The large lobby area was great to sit , watch the world go by while we sipped cocktails . We will be back .",5,2020,11,21
203,Old hand,"Have stayed many times at Doyle‚Äôs Hotel over time 

And thought The Westbury was the one for our 
Anniversary as right in centre of city near parks and within walking distance of everything we just felt it was safe for us",4,2020,10,21
203,Quick break in case of lockdown ,"Booked what seemed like a great offer (B&B with 3 course dinner for ‚Ç¨345).
Nice welcome every time you step into this hotel but dinner and particularly breakfast service not really what you‚Äôd expect for a 5 star hotel which is a great pity because bar and main area service is so good. Breakfast was tepid at best and had to ask for teas and coffees and toast a few times before eventually arriving after we had eaten our breakfast. Staff are v good at apologising for delays etc. 
Room was nice. Bed was v comfortable. Felt safe from Covid-19 at all times.

",4,2020,10,17
203,Excellence in the heart of the city,"There is no better place in Dublin than the Gallery in the Westbury on a sunny afternoon.  Sit in the window and order a pint or a glass of wine and enjoy people watching from the best vantage point in town.  

The service was excellent in the main hotel, although the Sidecar Bar and Wilde restaurant were closed.  We felt very welcome and comfortable.  They were only serving food in Balfes, which was a bit of a miss for us, although having a meal indoors during Level 3 lockdown was a bit of a treat in and of itself.  The hotel was very quiet in general, but this really didn‚Äôt bother us.  I enjoyed the peace in the Gallery, where we spent most of our time when we were not out and about. ",5,2020,10,10
203,Highly recommend The Westbury ,"I had to make an essential visit to Dublin last week and stayed in The Westbury.
I have to highly commend them in these most difficult times , for looking after their guests so well.
The hotel adhered to all the social distancing rules and I felt very safe and still had a very good experience.
Balfe‚Äôs was open for evening meal, which was hugely appreciated as I had no company on the night and it was a great option, to dine in restaurant rather than have room service.  Only 4 other diners on a Tuesday night so well done to hotel for having restaurant open.
Breakfast- which was really good -in Wilde‚Äôs in the morning, again appreciated that this was open.
It was the staff that really made my stay.  Reception could not have done more to facilitate me and everyone I met had a chat and a smile.   Truly 6 star service- well done to The Westbury.
",5,2020,10,09
203,Not the place to stay in during a pandemic,"Excellent hotel in a pre covid world I‚Äôm sure, but very difficult to justify its costs now. Location the key, but not worth a whole lot in the pandemic - which should be mirrored in the price of the hotel which it absolutely isn‚Äôt. ",2,2020,10,05
203,Excellent,Staff are fantastic and really what make this hotel so enjoyable to visit. Location is excellent. Rooms are very comfortable and clean. A nice relaxing atmosphere in the lounge area and the food in Wilde restaurant is delicious. ,5,2020,10,05
203,Our Wonderful Westbury,"On the day we should have but couldn‚Äôt fly to Spain, I checked into The Westbury with my Mam for a belated birthday treat for her. It was a great way to relieve some of the disappointment!
It‚Äôs a beautiful place to stay, we spent the afternoon on the terrace having some super relaxed drinks before taking a stroll around Grafton St in the sunshine.
It‚Äôs in a fantastic location and whilst our room was nothing special, it was very comfortable (the beds and bedding are fabulous).
I love it and it‚Äôs positioning. Would be delighted to stay any time!!",5,2020,09,22
203,Weekend Break,Excellent experience and really enjoyed the warm hospitality - we were unsure if the trip would be strange given the COVID restrictions but it was actually lovely and we really enjoyed the glimpse of how weekends away used to be - before COVID.,5,2020,09,14
203,Afternoon Tea not to be missed,"Myself and 3 friends visited the westbury today for afternoon tea in the gallery. An exceptional experience from start to finish.

We were greeted at the door by Derek and Kevin who were so welcoming and directed us upstairs where we were taken to a lovely table. All of the staff on the gallery were very attentive especially Cameron who looked after us mainly. 

The food was exceptional and I‚Äôm happy to say the best afternoon tea I‚Äôve ever had. The price is to the upper limit of what I would expect to pay for afternoon tea but the food, service and ambiance make it fantastic value for money. I was a particular fan of the pistachio opera cake üëå

With everything covid at the moment there is always the risk that things won‚Äôt feel the ‚Äònorm‚Äô but we definitely didn‚Äôt feel that, other than wearing a mask from the door to our table it felt like a normal but safe outing with the girls. The tables are nicely spread, staff wearing visors but we weren‚Äôt at all rushed and really throughly enjoyed our afternoon. 

Keep up the good work guys. Can‚Äôt wait to book my table for the Christmas season üòÉ",5,2020,09,13
203,A quick one night stay,"Excellent night in the Westbury, great food and drinks were had in all their establishments (Balfes, The Gallery, Wilde, the Sidecar). Excellent customer service from staff who could not have done more for you.",5,2020,08,30
203,Paying for location - not worth it I‚Äôm afraid ,"I stayed on a Sunday night which was my 40th birthday as a treat from my husband. While the bed was comfy, the TV didn‚Äôt work and the plumbing in the room was terrible, both noisy and it had an odor. I think my husband thought they might look after us as it was a special night and quiet being a Sunday evening. I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs not worth the rate for the night. Rooms are very standard and I‚Äôve stayed in better 4* hotels. You are totally paying for location. The lobby is fabulous and the afternoon tea is well worth a try. I‚Äôd visit and stay somewhere else. I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt be returning to stay again. ",2,2020,08,25
203,Fabulous experience at The Westbury,"Amazing stay at this hotel, d√©cor fabulous, staff very friendly and attentive. Bedroom excellent. Perfect location. Overall a wonderful experience definitely return. Special shout out to Kevin who looked after us.",5,2020,08,25
203,Excellant,I have wanted to stay in the Westbury for a long time. What a treat it was. The valet parking on arrival starts a very relaxing stay in the hotel. All staff were very friendly and so helpful. On check-in the sanitiser and masks provided in a travel pack were a really nice touch. Presecco in the room was much appreciated. The hotel is very sanitary and clean. The food is really good. I can't fault anythimg. It surpassedy expectations. I am looking forward to my next stay. ,5,2020,08,24
203,AMAZING,Twas such a relaxing time I had n d bar upstairs it's was fantastic and d food was so nice. D staff were all so very nice I highly recommend this place . We visited d place n August and it's was so nice up there.,5,2020,08,23
203,Ruby wedding anniversary as a gift from our family,"We stayed at the Westbury Hotel Dublin 16th to the 18th of August for our Ruby wedding Anniversary .
What an experience from start to finish of our stay.
Hotel was spectacular, spotless, hand sanitisers everywhere.Staff absolutely went out of their way to make our stay special. A bottle of Prosecco was left in an ice bucket in our room along with treats.
The cleanliness of the hotel was excellent, social distancing was carried out in restaurant etc .
This was by far the nicest place I have ever stayed with my husband. Just pure perfection from start to finish. This hotel is run very professionally with the best staff I have yet to come across. The door men welcomed you at the door very pleasant men, they packed our car and took our luggage to our room which was out of this world.The cleaners were first class at their job and after your room was cleaned a seal was put on door so when you opened the door the seal broke . This showed us every time our room was cleaned . I can‚Äôt praise the Westbury highly enough. The food , breakfast beds everything about this welcoming hotel is 100% perfect .
So thank you all for a wonderful experience and lovely memories of 40th Anniversary.
üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüíï",5,2020,08,18
203,Afternoon Tea,"My first visit to the Westbury HoteI  was for afternoon tea with my sister and my niece to celebrate a recent special birthday. We were made to feel very welcome with very attentive staff and delicious food. Very nice, comfortable surroundings and spotlessly clean. Overall it was a lovely experience which we all enjoyed. Hoping to return again sometime.",5,2020,08,16
203,Disappointing,"We stayed in The Westbury for my 40th birthday, a gift from my fianc√©. I didn‚Äôt realise how much it cost until I overheard the receptionist when checking in. It most definitely was not worth the money. See photo attached of view. I‚Äôve stayed in hotels in London and America where the view may not be great but the hotels have put fake grass, potted plants etc to make the most of an unappealing view. 
We had dinner in Wilde, not a great selection on the menu due to covid but the food was delicious and service was excellent. The bar closed at 9.30pm so nowhere to have a drink after dinner. 
We were also not warned that there was building work taking place. We have a 2 year old and we were looking forward to a lie in so you can imagine how happy we were being woken up at 8am to the sound of drilling! 
To top it all off, as if the cost of the room was not enough, we were also charged ‚Ç¨25 for parking üôÑ

In short, you are not missing anything by staying there, the best part about it is the bar, restaurant, lobby area which you can utilise without staying. The rooms are fine but nothing special, you‚Äôre purely paying for location. If I had of known I would have saved the money and had some 5* pampering in Monart. Very disappointing but at least we know now. We will definitely be back to Wilde but will not stay again unfortunately.",3,2020,08,15
203,Excellent all round.,Thoroughly enjoyable visit. Good location. Excellent food. Preparation for Covid 19 very obvious and comforting. Every precaution taken. Convenient car parking. Make sure and use Sat Nav for directions through the narrow streets. ,5,2020,08,13
203,Ok but for the money not great,Hotel is tired and dated. The rooms are average and there is terrible soundproofing- you can hear everything going on at all hours. Even people plugging in chargers next to your head whilst trying to sleep. The staff are amazing and the hotel is in a great location. Just the lack of sleep due to noise was a problem. For the expense of the hotel. I probably would chose differently on my next trip to Dublin. ,3,2020,07,28
203,Relaxing weekend,"Just spent a lovely weekend in Dublin and stayed at The Westbury Hotel, it was exceptionally relaxing and all protocols due to Covid were strictly adhered to , all staff were exceptionally friendly especially in all Departments. Totally enjoyed our stay.  ",5,2020,07,27
203,Afternoon tea,"I have had afternoon tea in the Westbury many times and each time it is simply wonderful. The food- always delicious, the staff- so friendly and the atmosphere - just perfect. I will continue to return tine and time again.",5,2020,06,09
203,getting old,The hotel is ok  but it is getting old. The location is good although a little tough to get to with all the traffic and one way road so expect to walk as it actually is more convienient. The rooms and the lobby need refurbishing.,3,2020,05,16
203,Great Hotel & Delicious Breakfast,The Westbury Hotel is located in the heart of downtown and you have a nice view of busy Grafton Street. The brunch at The Westbury is the finest anywhere in the City and the service is top notch. We also enjoyed the afternoon tea and the delicious snacks that The Westbury offers.,5,2020,04,19
203,"Nice hotel, but not as good as I thought.","The hotel is indeed very comfortable, and in a wonderful location. The staff are exceptional and very helpful The room I stayed in was quite small with a very dark bathroom, not suitable for applying make up,  this however wasn't a major problem.
What I didn't like  for a five star hotel, is that there is no lobby where you can sit and read a paper, or wait for other guests to come from their room. My  daughter in law was staying at the hotel at the same time as we were and we needed to wait for her , the area near the reception was serving food, so I couldn't wait there , I then thought I would wait for her in the bar, when I went in with my daughters I was told I couldn't sit in the bar, ( even if I  had a drink) as it was lunch time and you could only go in if ordering food.  We  didn't want food.  I said I was a resident and was waiting for someone, I was told I could sit in the area at the bottom of the stairs, ( where the taxi drops guests) It was cold, and certainly not a five star experience.  
Breakfast was nice , and the serving staff were very pleasant,  I complement who ever trains the staff as they do a very good job.",4,2020,04,18
203,Very good stay in Dublin,"We heard so much about the Westbury hotel before our trip, eventually we cancelled our bookings with Conrad and booked with this one. The hotel itself is very good, great and convenient location. Hotel facilities and services are very good, recommended!",5,2020,03,20
203,Best Stay in Dublin,"We unfortunately timed our stay terribly due to the coronavirus outbreak but inside The Westbury you wouldn‚Äôt have known. The concierge were incredible and looked after us so well, especially Lukas. Every member of staff who we encountered in the hotel were incredibly friendly and professional. 

We got a room upgrade from the studio suite to the luxury studio suite and the room as exceptional. A big room space for a city centre hotel. Every amenity you could have wanted was in the room, the big red chairs were so comfy you could have slept in them! The tv in the bathroom was a great touch. The room itself was spotless and so well presented. Our room was at the front of the hotel so we could see grafton street from our room which was great for people watching. In terms of shopping, we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better location, grafton street was right on our doorstep!

The hotel bar have some amazing cocktails, very different to what you get in most bars but so creative. Definitely worth a visit there after a day of shopping. Our breakfast was included and it was beautiful! So much variation included in the buffet, it was always well stocked and tidy. The hot food was delicious and the staff were incredibly attentive. 

We won‚Äôt be staying anywhere else in Dublin after our stay at The Westbury. We will definitely be back ",5,2020,03,17
203,a big thank you to Sophia from reservations!,"Due to the cercomstances of the Coronavirus we had to cxl our business trip to Dublin.¬†I contacted the reservation deppatment where I spoked with Sophia from reservations, she was so helpfull and flexible just how it should be!

Hotel is in a great location very central to see Dublin",5,2020,03,12

Thank you guys at The Gallery. ",5,2020,03,11
203,Great location!,Stayed here with my family when visiting Ireland this year and it was so lovely! The location is amazing!! It was easy to walk to a lot of landmarks we wanted to visit and very close to the shops on grafton street! ,5,2020,03,09
203,Afternoon Tea,"This was a delightful delicious high tea. The tea selection was fantastic and the server had great recommendations. The food selection was wonderful. Tea sandwichs won high praise. Not delicate but v ery good. The scones were perfect. I didn't care for the desserts but they were beautiful and my tea partners liked them. 
My only complaint and I could have asked but I was just enjoying myself...was that they didn't check back on a regular basis to get our next tea order. So we reallly only had a chance to enjoy one kind. Again, we should have asked. Staff was wonderful. The hotel was lovely and the flowers (my first take) were breathtaking.",5,2020,03,08
203,disappointing-very noisy,"This was our first holiday abroad for 2 years,we chose the Westbury because we wanted to stay in comfort. When we made our reservation we requested a quiet room.

Disappointingly, the room was noisy both internally and externally.On check-in we were informed that the hotel was being refurbished and therefore our room would not be quiet but that work was limited between 10am and 5pm. It is now 6.15pm and the continuous drilling  is still going on, this is just inconsiderate and not acceptable.  
Our room is at the front of the hotel, every morning the pub outside our window loads and unloads about 100 empty guiness barrels and their replensihments from 8am. This is very noisy

We feel that the level of refurbishment disruption should  have been disclosed when we were booking and then we would have had a choice in the matter.When it is cold outside it is essential to have the option of relaxing in our hotel room.

Our other disappointment is the poor speed of internet connection, this is just irritating

On the plus side, the breakfast is outstanding and  generally the staff are very helpful and pleasant  (apart from the member of housekeeping who could not supply any earl grey tea bags for our room even though earl grey tea is available at breakfast)",2,2020,03,04
203,A great hotel & wonderful staff.,"We stayed at the hotel in February for 4 days and we had an amazing time.The locations is great, being in the center of the city. The staff is really friendly, with good energy and always with a smile to help you in any need.The breakfast is great but if you have the chance you definately have to try their restaurant as well. Its amazing with great food and selections of wine.The room specious and clean. Only issue was the noise from an other builiding coz of construction but it was ok. Will definately go back again.",5,2020,03,04
203,Sardee,"From the start to the finish of my stay staff were friendly and efficient, location brilliant and the food excellent. The beds were comfortable and no noise can be heard on the corridors at night . Well done to all managers & staff",5,2020,03,03
203,"Beautiful hotel, fabulous location, let down by concierge ","Right in the centre of Dublin, though tucked away in the winding streets is the beautiful hotel. Upon arrival guests feel truly welcomed. The door men are so helpful. When I returned from a run in the morning one rushed to get me a bottle of water (proactively). Something I've never experienced before.
Check in was easy and quick even when arriving early. The classic room on the 4th floor was large enough. Most importantly the room and bathroom was clean and well stocked. Kettle for tea, Nespresso for coffee, even a shoe cleaner. As well as the usual amenities. The turn down service was the best as the chocolates on the pillow are delicious. 
I didn't check out the gym as I usually would as I enjoyed running around Phoenix Park which is a mile away.
Breakfast in the hotel was substantial and very good. Of particular mention is the muffins which have to the freshest and softest ever.
So why not 5 stars, which I was so ready and desperate to give. I pre-ordered my taxi to the airport with the concierge. Taxi was there on time, but upon time to pay he told me he didn't accept credit cards. I had made it clear at time of booking this would be my payment method. So not only was this embarrassing, due to traffic (been a crash) I was running late. I am now also stuff with the foreign cash withdrawal fees. Such a shame, and unfortunately leaves a bad taste.",4,2020,03,02
203,Simply The Best!!,"We have stayed at the Westbury for many years when we come home to Dublin. The welcome on arrival is always friendly, warm and courteous. We wouldn't choose anywhere else to stay as it is simply a perfect location, and always a beautiful experience.",5,2020,03,02
203,BEST LOCATION AND VERY HELPFUL STAFF,"The location of the hotel is very good !!! The staff very helpful and the food at the restaurant was Fantastic!
The only small problem was a little noise from some renovation or construction that was going on but not for long time . 
I will come back to this hotel but I will make sure there is no renovation goes on. ",4,2020,03,01
203,Fabulous service ,"Fabulous service: efficient, genuine and exceptionally helpful.  Lovely hotel with great history but totally modernised.  Delicious food.  Great for our business conference which we had there over 4 days.  One downside is that the gym is truly awful.  Really need to put their hand in their pocket and build a 5 star gym. ",5,2020,03,01
203,westbury is a terrific hotel in a beautfiul city,"exceptional staff across the board. great location with easy access to multiple parts of the city. afternoon high tea is well worth it. gym across the street (hotel rate) is remarkable, great equipment and heavy bags available. restaurant is solid. smaller rooms are definitely small (though beautifully appointed), so splurge for a suite if you can.",5,2020,02,27
203,Balffs restaurant!,"We visited by chance for lunch and were given a warm welcome. I‚Äôve used this cafe/restaurant a few times for work and found it a great place. Lunch was great, food was tasty, fresh and plentiful. Service is relaxed. Great visit!",5,2020,02,26

203,Beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of Dublin,"What a perfect Dublin location for a weekend of sightseeing. Great to walk right onto bustling and festive Grafton Street, yet stay in elegance and feel somewhat removed from the noise. There was some construction noise within the hotel, but nothing at night during sleeping time, so all was manageable. Tea in the front restaurant was perfect; we enjoyed a lovely window seat and table for two and had a marvelous time with delicious food and tea. The concierge was truly wonderful to deal with and made excellent recommendations for dining and an area tour of County Wicklow. We would absolutely return to the Westbury.",5,2020,02,24

203,Wonderful people and hospitality,"The team at this hotel were exceptionally accommodating and hospitable. A few things worth mentioning:
- We flew in from the US and arrived early, and the front desk worked hard to get us a room quickly so we could check in early. They also provided complimentary breakfast while we waited for the room to become available. These gestures were above and beyond and much appreciated.
- There was some construction noise during the day between 10am-5pm for essential maintenance. We asked the front desk if we could move rooms as we needed to do business work from the hotel during the day. They did one better, and provided us with a full business conference room along with beverage service, no additional charge.
- The restaurant and bar on site are very beautifully designed and furnished, including fireplaces. They are a joy to use.
- The staff is very kind. For example Marta T was wonderful when I arrived at the lobby at 11am which was after breakfast time closed in the restaurant, and she volunteered to check with the kitchen to accommodate my request for breakfast, and promplty worked it out with great food and service. She went above and beyond, and did it all with a gracious smile.
This staff really cares.  I highly recommend, they treat you like royalty.",5,2020,02,14
203,Best Location and Beautiful Hotel,"The hotel is beautiful, the staff is so welcoming, and the Sidecar cocktail lounge is fabulous!

We had a king suite - I highly recommend!",5,2020,02,13
203,Excellent Stay,"We stayed for 2 nights the first weekend in January in a King Suite room 208 and everything about the stay was lovely - very large room and the comfiest bed we have ever slept in.

Christmas 2019 I was even treated to my very own Christmas tree and I  just managed to put the presents under the tree for my friends arrival to share a glass of Christmas Westbury bubbles.  (pink) .My thanks for these beautiful Westbury Christmases must go to Mr. Jack Fitzsimons,  customer and sales manager at the Westbury. He is such a gentleman and makes every amazing experience at the hotel seem effortless.

203,One of my favorite hotels in Dublin,"I use this hotel so much it's almost become my Dublin office. They serve a limited but excellent menu in he Gallery on the first floor, where reception is located which also includes some healthy options. Service is excellent. A bit pricey but what else would you expect from a 5-star establishment.",5,2020,01,26
203,25th Wedding anniversary,We spent a night here for our anniversary and every single minute we were looked after - the friendliest staff and so helpful and professional.  A surprise addition of wine and cake to the room to congratulate us and then rose petals over the bed - they just went the extra mile to make it special. Gorgeous breakfast and Stephen the waiter was so friendly and professional.,5,2020,01,26
203,An Unforgettable Experience,"My friend and I were in Dublin for the day and decided we would dine in the Westbury. We went with Balfe's Bar Brassiere, where we were delightfully greeted by the host (I'm sorry I didn't catch his name). The place was designed with an industrial theme in mind with a modern approach. The food menu had an excellent selection of lunch bites, salads, food from the grill and desserts. We were served by the lovely Isobel, who has very attentive to ensure we enjoyed our experience. I went for the cheese selection, which was beautifully presented on a wooden board which looked like polished tree bark. I paired it with the Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot. My friend had the BodyByrne sweet potato wholemeal wrap and a glass of prosecco. Both of our meals were delicious. 
Afterwards, we decided to go upstairs to the Sidecar Bar for a cocktail. This bar area is also beautifully designed with a 1930's theme. They have a martini trolley in the centre of the room, and plenty of seating available. We sat in the corner couch and were immediately served some water nuts and olives. We were served by Gabriel, who was happy to answer our questions, especially about the Martini trolley. After our order was taken, we were given complimentary glasses of prosecco while we waited for our cocktails. This blew us away and made us feel very special! We enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere along with our cocktails.
Overall, we had an unforgettable experience and will most definitely be back!",5,2020,01,24
203,Very polite personel,A nice hotel in the old part of the town. The restaurant of the hotel has nicely presented dishes but not so tasteful to my judgment. A too much crowed hotel mostly from outsiders.    it is not evident you will find a table or chair at the pub of your hotel so you have  to go out somewhere. Also It is impossible to find a table for 5oclock tea if you have not reserved. There is not  for hotel residents a quite reading salon.  also some drawers closet would help arrangement,4,2020,01,22
203,The Little Bear Family Package ,"Worth every single cent... 
from check in to check out was perfect. We started off in Balfe‚Äôs restaurant while our room was getting the final touches, lunch in Balfe‚Äôs delicious nice and simply, my two little girls loved the pancakes and colouring books. Then we made our way to the room we had organised a cake to the room for my daughters 3rd birthday perfect, we had a luxury kids tent in the room and two westbury teddy bears, it was just perfect. Evening meal in the hotel lounge area once again it was delicious, the breakfast and the breakfast area was perfect. Can‚Äôt Wait for our next stay.. thanks to all the staff at The Westbury...

203,Class Act Start to Finish,"Just returned from a pitch perfect Celebratory Birthday Weekend at the Westbury. The hotel, accommodation, food (Room Service & Wilde Restaurant), Bellmen, service staff and incredible managerial customer service was TOPS and absolutely 5 + star worthy. The location also brilliant particularly for shopping, the creative quarter, church, park & museums - we walked everywhere and with ease. A few niggles the first night with our suite but they were resolved immediately and with great care and attention from Valentia & Caroline. I am forever grateful to these ladies and the hotel for making a most memorable and delightful Birthday weekend. Looking forward and plotting our return, I would recommend The Westburyl to anyone with great confidence and enthusiasm. Dublin is super and the Westbury a jewel in the city. ",5,2020,01,15
203,Exquisite Hotel,"The hotel to go for Afternoon Tea. The staff, (in particular a young man named Remi who was fantastic) were so attentive and well mannered, had no issues in offering us more sandwiches and treats and remembered my mother's birthday and marked the occasion with a lovely slice of their signature chocolate mousse cake. 

The d√©cor is beautiful in the Gallery, soft plush comfortable furnishings and the chandeliers added some sparkle.

Highly recommend for a ladies afternoon out whether with family or friends.",5,2020,01,13
203,Birthday/New Years Eve dinner,"We had dinner in Wilde in the Westbury on New Year's Eve.  The ambiance, food and staff are second to none here. Food was excellent and generous portions too.  They even gave hubbie a birthday desert.  Staff were so attentive and friendly.  Great atmosphere here and we finished the night in the side bar with champage from the hotel and some cocktails. An amazing experience.",5,2020,01,13
203,Dublins Finest,"Had a wonderful stay over new year with the wife and in-laws. Cannot thank the staff enough. Great service from the doors to Aisling at front desk who checked us in and showed us around. Balfes is a great spot for a hot whiskey where they give you a nice whiskey as a base and a choice of whether you would like it made with honey. The Croatian gentleman who was extremely busy when we were there but somehow found the time and a smile for everyone. Rooms were great, team at breakfast extremely friendly and coordinated and a superb choice of Jams and Irish cheese at the buffet. My wife particularly loved the bread. We were lucky to meet the handsome hotel manager on our way out who seemed to know everyone. A great vous all around.",5,2020,01,13
203,Beautiful hotel,"The Westbury is a beautiful hotel set in the heart of the city.
Very friendly professional staff.
Comfortable room.

However.Trainee receptionists cancelled my room card and it had to be reinstated 3 times.
Lots of apologies from manager. Very inconvenient.",4,2020,01,12
203,Beautiful old property,"Old but loved the room sizes and the service. Check-in was smooth, room was ready and quick 5 minutes to get to the room and bags already there. Room was the junior suite with an extra bed for my kid. It was spacious and the poster bed comfy. The bathroom on the other hand is fairly tiny when compared to the size of the room. Since we there for just couple of nights, it did not bother us. Good coffee in the room and our breakfast was included which was excellent. I would definitely go back to this hotel and maybe get an upgraded room.",5,2020,01,11
203,Amazing Experience ,We stayed at the Westbury on the 4th January. It was an amazing experience from the minute we arrived. The receptionist at check in was friendly and gave us all the information we needed about the hotel and surrounding area.  The rooms are big and luxurious with a turn down service at night. The bar has a great atmosphere and a wide variety of cocktails are on the menu. There is a complimentary procceco while you are waiting for your cocktail. The food at the Westbury is second to none and breakfast has a wide variety of food to choose from.  Will definitely stay here again in the future. It is an experience of a lifetime. ,5,2020,01,11
203,New Year Stay,"Myself and my husband were gifted a voucher to use as a wedding gift from family members. We were so excited to use this gift over the Christmas period and chose to book The Westbury as our location to ring in the new year of 2020 (our first new year as a married couple). 

Unfortunately, upon arrival at the hotel, although check in was from 3pm, we had to wait until 3:45 for our room to be made available. This was frustrating as we had made plans to meet friends at 4pm and wanted to freshen up before meeting them. We had booked a front facing room and were informed at check in that we had been upgraded. However, when we reached the room we found that our 'upgrade' was an extra small room for a baby (which was of no use to a couple) and our 'front facing room' was in fact  to the side and looking out onto building work/scaffolding.

We had made prior arrangements to eat in one of the hotel restaurants that evening. However were told once again that our table was not yet available. We eventually placed an order at one hour AFTER our reservation.

The following day we, left our room with a notice on the door saying please clean our room. However, when we returned 5 hours later our room had not been touched!",3,2020,01,10
203,Very Nice Hotel. Excellent service. Excellent Location,"Stayed for one night with my wife over the Christmas period. The hotel is in a superb location, just off Grafton Street and close to tons of great restaurants, pubs and everything the south side has to offer. The room was pretty big, clean and comfortable. We had a light lunch in the Sidecar bar which was very nice and breakfast in Balfes the next morning was also very good. 

Where The Westbury excels is customer service. Every single person treated us like royalty from the moment we checked in to the moment we picked up our bags to leave. This is where I feel they really earn their 5 star rating. 

Highly recommended. ",5,2020,01,06
203,Excellent Stay,"This was our second stay in the Westbury. We already have our next trip booked for later this year.

The hotel was extremely busy and staff were under pressure with their allocated tables, however all interactions were friendly and helpful. We did have to ask 3 times before a sweeping brush was provided to clean around our feet which was below what we would've expected. However, in general cleanliness and service was excellent.

Location, quality of service, welcome, friendly and helpful staff as well as a luxury experience in the heart of the city- the Westbury has it all.

",5,2020,01,06
203,fantastic location,"beautiful hotel, great location in the heart of dublin but so quite, our room was lovely very comfortable and i could not believe how quite it was considering the location.

203,Simply The Best,"We wanted to end our 3 week visit of several cities over the holidays with the best hotel...and we found it. Welcomed. Attention to detail. Professional. Flawless. Rich. Plush. Just some of the ways to describe our feelings/experience at The Westbury. You can read about the smiles and name recognition by the team but it does not quite hit home until you have experienced it by this wonderful staff. Their ability to anticipate our needs all based on an eye contact or just entering a room. Ashley at the front desk, Gabriel In The sidecar and Scott in the galley are ones to watch. We finished up on New Years Eve with a perfect balance of sophistication and ease in The Sidecar with Scott. A great way to start our journey home the next day. A Happy New Year.",5,2020,01,05
203,Superb Afternoon Tea,Received a voucher for afternoon tea for two for myself and my daughter. From the packaging to the day itself it was absolutely phenomenal.

203,*****Five Stars *****,"My Mother and I had visited Dublin at the beginning of November (sorry for the delayed review). I am so glad we had selected The Westbury for our first visit to this city, it really made the vacation start on the right foot. The Service from start to finish was remarkable and what I remember the most.  From the time of check in, I really felt that the team here would help in any way they can in making sure we visited and enjoyed the best of Dublin.  The rooms are nice and the location could not be any better.  We were able to walk to all of the the historic sites and learned a lot about the countries history. I hope one day my travels will bring me back to Dublin, and I certainly will not think twice about staying here again.",5,2020,01,03
203,A Five Star Night in the Heart of Dublin,"Recently stayed in the Westbury and from the moment we checked in, it was just the most amazing experience, from the room over looking Grafton Street, to the cocktails in the Sidecar and finally the food on the Gallery. Staff are excellent and I would highly recommend a stay here.",5,2020,01,02
203,"Pretty, but tired hotel",Westbury is a beautiful hotel in a great central location for Dublin. But the hotel needs a complete ‚Äúre-do‚Äù. Rooms are tired and bathrooms are tiny. Nothing about the rooms or bathrooms justify the high prices for this hotel. Many other locations available at better prices. Staff not very friendly or attentive with the exception of our waitress at Bafles restaurant. Disappointing. ,3,2020,01,01
203,Amazing Westbury,"Every December for the past 6 years myself and my two friends spend a night at the Westbury. It is by far the best location in Dublin .

203,What a great place to stay,"We received a very warm welcome the hotel was very busy but that did not stop the staff being attentive and friendly . The central location is ideal for shoppers and sightseers . We stayed for 4 nights and ate in the hotel every evening swapping from the brasserie to the restaurant and back both excellent . Our only gripe being when we booked and asked about booking the restaurant we were told that wasn‚Äôt necessary and we would have no problem getting in , we were very lucky to have a stool in the brasserie . Would definitely stay there again ",5,2019,12,29
203,Amazing Hotel and staff,"We booked a night in the westbury as a special treat and were not disappointed. From the moment we pulled up outside we knew this place was special, Tomislav our concierge could not have been more pleasant and helpful and sorted out our luggage, Parked our car and gave us some very useful tips about the hotel and surrounding area. We checked into our room on the 5th floor - it was amazing and everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel and more. We had booked dinner in the Hotels restaurant Wilde - it was more than we could have expected. The sumptuous starters (scallops) followed by succulent lamb chops - the food was simply amazing and the best I have had for a long time. We finished with Irish coffees made at our table - a must if you are there! The service was impeccable and Patrick was so attentive- he seems to know what you need before you ask! He managed to reserve a table for us at the sidecar bar after our dinner where we had some fantastic cocktails.

You haven‚Äôt lived until you have stayed and dined in the Westbury - it is simply a must do!!",5,2019,12,29

Theres a reason for why we come back year after year, there is just something special about this place at Christmas its magical. The one thing that really stands out every year beside all the usual bits  like food, room, and location which are all amazing, is the staff, the staff really make this place. We met a lovely chap originally from Waterford (where we are  from) I'm sorry we didnt catch his name and also Kevin down at the door. We already cant wait for next year only this time we will be doing 2 nights as 1 is just not enough. ",5,2019,12,16
203,Mediocre all round,"First the positives: fantastic location, great lobby area, early check in possible, valet parking 
The negatives: mediocre staff when checking in, small room and bathroom, no shampoo in bathroom and had to wait 30 mins next morning for some to be delivered, lobby and bar were extremely busy, great atmosphere but as we were returning to hotel at about 630pm we were told by a gentleman on the stairs that it was not possible to get food or a drink anywhere, we asked another lady who gave us a table in the lobby area, staff in general leave a lot to be desired. A small point, we were given a choice of paper when checking in to be delivered to our room but the wrong one was delivered, not a big deal but having stayed in quite a few 5 stars I would expect more attention to detail. Also myself and husband were on a night away and my sister wanted to arrange to treat us to a couple of drinks but was told when she rang that we were not staying here. Again just not the 5 star service I would expect. 
The shelbourne and the merrion definitely rank higher in my opinion!",3,2019,12,15
203,Great family owned 5 star hotel,"Pro:
- very good service as soon as you enter the property they take your bag;
- 5 star hotel room, which is really quiet but in the middle of Dublin Center 
- nice umbrella and even a brochure for in-room fitness
- nice restaurant The Wild, restaurant pricing is fine.

Con:
- it‚Äôs hard to open the Windows ",5,2019,12,14
203,Fantastic experience!,"On 17th November 2019,myself and my family were treated to an unforgettable birthday dinner in the Wilde restaurant in the Westbury. Our waiter James and wine specialist Vinnie were incredibly receptive and the food was delicious. We cannot wait to return some time in the near future! 

Your staff are a credit to your hotel. We hope to join you, perhaps, for a very early 7.30am breakfast on Christmas Eve?
Regards,
McGrath Family ",5,2019,12,14
203,The Westbury always a pleasure,"I have stayed  here many times , the location is superb as is the food and staff , I know I will return next year which i look forward to, I love the breakfast served in The Wilde Restaurant its amazing. ",5,2019,12,13
203,Work and play,"Always a favorite part of business trips to Dublin. Lucky enough to have my wife join and enjoy the city at Christmas. The Westbury was ideal for each. We were n the middle of everything. Gracious, comfortable with all the amenities needed for both business and pleasure. Difficult to enter or leave without being offered bottles of water. I don‚Äôt recall more luxurious towels in any hotel.",5,2019,12,10
203,Afternoon tea in the Gallery,"My family and I loved our afternoon tea. Was our second year in a row and loved it as always. The food was super tasty and the tea menu is amazing from matcha tea to tumeric tea. The nutella hot chocolate is a must. The service was amazing, couldn't speak more highly of Kleyton, he was on the ball amd super friendly and attentive.",5,2019,12,10
203,Best place to stay in Dublin,Luxury setting and convenience to shopping and restaurants ‚Äì No need to look any further than the Westbury. I arranged a meeting for international guests and with had dinner in the Wilde restaurant ‚Äì they left very happy and impressed ,5,2019,12,10
203,Amazing afternoon tea,"Superb festive afternoon tea in 'The Gallery', amazing service and wonderful ambiance. Ambrose made my friend's birthday extra special. Highly recommend for any occasion. I have been before but the festive afternoon tea is on its own level- incredible",5,2019,12,09
203,Loud noise from band,"Stayed here for three nights. Room was okay. Service was great as was the whole staff. Saturday night, with a 3:30 AM wake up call, for an early flight on Sunday, the noise from the band is so loud neither my wife or I can sleep. We have been laying here for 2 hours and sleep is not happening until the band stops - maybe about 12:30 or so - according to the front desk. With luck, we will get 2 hours of sleep before we have to get up for our trip to the airport and I am furious!

This is so loud, I know I am not the first person to complain, but they go ahead and rent the room out anyway. Very shabby treatment and they get zero stars from us.",1,2019,12,07
203,Very Helpful Service & Great Location,"We stayed for my 50th birthday and when I arrived back to the room, there was a lovely piece of cake/dessert and a card from staff as well as some gifts which family members had arranged to leave at the hotel for me.  It is a great location as is very much in the heart of the city.   The staff were very attentive.  We had a situation where my wife had to be admitted to hospital which was very stressful.  The staff were kind and responsive and made a big difference to me.   We didn't get to try out any of the amenities but look forward to doing so on our return trip. ",5,2019,12,06
203,Afternoon Tea,"The Afternoon Tea in The Westbury was lovely with a very good selection of food for vegetarians.
I particularly liked the scones.
I always love the ambiance in the Gallery, it always feels so relaxed even though it's almost always busy.",5,2019,12,05
203,Birthday night away,"We arrived and checked in we were give room numbers but they were not ready so went out. Came back later and got keys staff not very pleasent just handed us keys never said anything.as we discovered she had given us keys for different room and never said. We used room service3 times for ice and had to go get it our selves.there were only toileteries for 1 person  and 3 people were in the room asked for more did not recieve . At Breakfast service bad had to ask for butter did not get, toast for 5 people got toast for 3  told us that only 3 of the 5 people had paid for breakfast lovely hotel but service not good very disappointed as. was looking forward to celebrating with friends.

203,Best Cocktails üç∏in Town! ,"We visited the Westbury hotel and after a short wait, we got a table in the cocktail bar. Our server, Laura was fantastic. She was super friendly and attentive. We received a mini glass of Prosecco while we waited for our cocktails to be prepared. Complimentary nuts were provided and we enjoyed the Christmas in Dublin ambience. All the team were beautifully presented, polite and friendly. We enjoyed a large Singapore Sling and  a Cosmo. Really enjoyed our visit and with the warm open fire and the warm customer service, we look forward to a return visit. ",5,2019,12,01
203,Fantastic Room and view,We stayed at the Westbury  for Thanksgiving.  Room was great on the 4th floor overlooking the street.  Only complaint was that the bars have people outside drinking till way past our bed time.  Room service was great and housekeeping really kept the room up.  Room had TV with a few channel but not really any movie channels per say.  Bellman were friendly and always helpful.  Desk staff were great.,5,2019,11,30
203,1 night stay ,"Welcoming staff and wonderful location. Attention to detail and friendliness of staff made our short stay truly relaxing. Car valet was also good value for money.

203,Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon tea was wonderful - the Festive Tea (about a month away from Christmas) featured some wonderful looking (and tasting!) desserts.  The scones and sandwiches were also delicious, and the tea selection was first rate.  Service from Remi and Flora was first rate and very professional.  Truly a wonderful experience!",5,2019,11,25

We so looking forward to a return tripüëå",5,2019,11,25
203,What a lovely business trip!,"Stayed here for one night for a business conference.  On arrival we were met by friendly and most helpful concierge staff member.  Reception staff were lovely and had heated flannels to freshen our hands.  Concierge took our cases to the room and asked if we needed him to show us around the room.  So helpful!  On arrival back to the hotel after dinner at an Italian restaurant ( recommended by the helpful Eddie) we ordered a bottle of wine with Adrian at the Sidecar bar and the. Decided to take it to our room.  He was so helpful and friendly, yet professional and offered to bring it to the room for us.  What a lovely stay!  Thank you. ",5,2019,11,25
203,Amazing 5* hotel üè®,"Where do I start, from the minute we stepped inside the door on Sunday we were looked after so well until we checked out on Monday. Nothing was too much bother.

A big thanks to Julian, Kiera, Remi, Shauna and Aisha who made the experience so enjoyable.  Hopefully see you all again soon.",5,2019,11,25

The hotel staff made me feel like a VIP every day, highly responsive to my needs.  I look forward to staying there again someday!",5,2019,11,25
203,Thanks,We stayed in The Westbury for two nights.  From the moment we got out of our taxi to be greeted by the concierge to when we left we experienced a first class service.  Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff we engaged with.  Every department of this hotel goes above and beyond the service required.  We will be back.,5,2019,11,22
203,Great Location!,This was a superb hotel in a great part of Dublin.  I loved being within walking distance to most attractions.  Restaurants on site were very good.  The staff was very attentive.  Light switches were a bit confusing but it added to the adventure of being in another country where things can be a bit different.,4,2019,11,19
203,Absolutely incredible,"What a beautiful hotel... incredible location. Service from staff is outstanding and the food in the restaurants is delicious. It is trendy without being ostentatious... beds must be like sleeping in heaven
I could not fault a thing. Will I be back... definitely. 
",5,2019,11,19
203,One night stay before out 5 night stay at Christmas,"We have been going to the Westbury for the past 23 years now. We have never had a bad experience at the Westbury and it is always a pleasure returning to Hotel. We are always so well looked after especially by Derek on the door who is now a great friend to us after all these years knowing him, Eddie on Baggage also an old time friend now and everyone else in the hotel. It is a home from home for us .We are now looking so much forward to our Christmas stay and meeting old friends that come in from abroad at the same time so we can meet up. Has to be the best Hotel anywhere ",5,2019,11,18
203,Awesome location!,"At the head of Grafton Street. Beautiful hotel and decor.  Friendly staff, excellent breakfast. Large room and bathroom. Concierge has tickets to hop on hop off bus. Delicious chocolates left for us each night.",5,2019,11,17
203,Exceptional,"Absolutely beautiful hotel at the base of Grafton Street. The service is what we will always remember. Our Valet meeting us at the cab, taking care of everything, handing me an umbrella in a light, light drizzle. Turn down service bringing extra water, room service was very quick and professional. Food all around was great. The bar is cozy and elegant. The bartender will give you a small glass of Prosecco while he makes your drink. All around fabulous service in the most beautiful of settings.  Nice room and bath too!  We stayed 4 nights and next time in Dublin, will stay here over the Weston (which is quite nice, good service, but more expensive but not better.)",5,2019,11,16
203,Location Location Location,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights to finish up our Ireland Vacation.  The service is top notch at this hotel and the location is fantastic.  You are right in the middle of all the shopping; restaurants; pubs (literally right outside the main doors) and just a short walk to temple bar area.  The service was excellent; the room sizes and amentities were not as great as our stays at the Hayfield Manor in Cork, The Killarney Park Hotel, or Dromoland Castle; but given it's a major city location we weren't expecting to get the same value as those other places.  the breakfast was plentiful as well which we got the Bed and Breafast package!  All in all a great stay!",5,2019,11,14
203,Dinner with Friends at the Westbury ,"Dined with a party of friends at the Westbury on Tuesday November 12, 2019. 

We were served a savory meal by our waiter : @Vadim from the comfort of the ambient and ample lounge area on the 1st floor facing the cosy inner-bar located on the same floor.

The dining experience was rendered even more memorable, through the efforts of Vadim, who attended to us throughout the entire evening. 

His savvy recommendations by way of main course, followed by dessert from the dinner menu, and drinks from the wine card, were a vivid demonstration of exquisite taste and knowledge of the savory delights offered by the kitchen, which helped to add to the poignant dining experience of the evening.

In light of the preceding, I would like to commend @Vadim for his efforts in making both our visit and dining experiences at the Westbury memorable and enjoyable.

Keep up the good work. We intend to return to repeat the delightful experience, once again. 

Regards

Femi",5,2019,11,14
203,The Westbury is THE place to stay in Dublin!,"Great location,,perfection...lovely hotel and cannot say enough about the delightful staff. Food venues with wonderful dining options and excellent service. Why would you stay any where else? I highly recommend the fine dining option at the Wilde, with a view of the city. Rooms are large and spacious and THE  most comfortable room and bedding we had while in Ireland. ",5,2019,11,14
203,Great Meal,Attended private dinner really good food. Salmon starter good really nicely cooked beef medium & good vegetables & nice plate of desserts with excellent staff & room with good atmosphere. About 40 attended a good night with round tables of eight which is good for chat,5,2019,11,13
203,Afternoon tea,"A friend and I visited the Westbury in Dublin for afternoon tea recently, I have to say it was fantastic from entering to leaving, the scones were the best I‚Äôve ever had, our server Shauna was delightful and the pianist made the whole experience a joy, highly recommend.",5,2019,11,13
203,Great stay and Service,"Stayed at the Westbury for a recent work trip and was overall impressed with the hotel.  Travel to Dublin often and rank it as a top hotel in Dublin. 

Location:  Great location right near SSG and Grafton street.  
Service:  Great services, the concierge was helpful, and the cleaning staff was great.
Room: Clean, not huge, but spacious, had everything I could need.  Even had a US outlet in case you forget your converter.  One small thing, I wish they had a power strip next to the bed.
Restaurants:  I only ate at Baffles which was good.

Overall a good stay.",5,2019,11,13
203,"The Westbury Hotel in Dublin, Ireland",The hotel was in a great location to walk around Dublin.  The staff made us feel very welcomed and they were friendly and informative.  The amenities were nice and the Christmas decorations were beautiful.  Our room was spacious and very clean.  The only downside was that they boil the water at times in the hotel and the cold water comes out extremely hot.  They should put a notice in the bathroom that this could happen.  I was taking my medication with what I thought was cold water and it ended up to be extremely hot and was melting my pills in my mouth as I tried to swallow the water.  My husband also hurt is foot stepping in the shower thinking it was set at the same temperature as the previous shower and only hot water was coming out of both hot and cold faucets.  Other that that the stay was wonderful.  We had high tea there and they were so accommodating for my husband's vegan needs with the tea.  My selection was what most people would love and it was delicious.  They did wake up calls on time for us and offered turn down service at night with a little candy.  Nice touches and the hotel overall was beautiful.,5,2019,11,12
203,Hotel,"great location and staffs are very pleasure and helpful. I will definitely highly recommended to others and return to this hotel once again for my next travel back to Dublin. Room are clean, staffs are helpful. ",5,2019,11,12
203,Very Nice But Dated ,"We stayed here twice in October.  The location is great for shopping - close to Grafton Street and all the great alleys to poke around.  The restaurants are fine- esp if the weather is bad.   But frankly the rooms are a bit dated -and in need of a refreshing.  Furniture dinged up , carpets stained.   Nothing that can‚Äôt be fixed.  Also - the staff is willing but there simply isn‚Äôt enough of them . Especially at check in time ( ie when the international travelers arrive) the front desk and concierge are mobbed!   Concierge attention was minimal and we did much better on finding recommendations for eating , shopping and exploring on our own.  ",4,2019,11,11
203,Superb,"We stayed as a couple this fabulous hotel, the reception and restaurant staff were amazing the food ambience, cleanliness and service was excellent.  Special mention to Thomas the concierge who was fabulous, his knowledge and helpfulness was second to none, I
We would certainly recommend this hotel for a great city break",5,2019,11,11
203,The Westbury Met and Exceeded my Expectations,"Stayed four nights to relax and enjoy Dublin, the Westbury's convenient central location and customer service exceeded our high expectations. Meals and drinks in the hotel different bars & restaurants were top quality.
The staff are well trained, professional, courteous  and customer centric, confirming its 5 star status.",5,2019,11,11
203,Marvelous Afternoon tea ,"My family and I went for afternoon tea last week (November 2019) to celebrate my mother's birthday and she is calling it her best birthday yet! 

It was such a special and unique way to spend the afternoon and an experience that none of us will forget.

We would particularly like to thank Remi who really made the day for us. He made us feel comfortable and relaxed the whole way and we can't thank him enough!

Can't wait to go back!
",5,2019,11,11
203,Birthday celebrations,"My sister and I visited the bar in the westbury for birthday celebrations. The bartender Leon provided excellent service, he was efficient and helpful and treated us to a delicious desert. The service was second to none and as regulars to the bar in the Westbury we love this place. Leon went above and beyond and we had a lovely night.",5,2019,11,09
203,My home in Dublin!,"I got back 2 weeks ago from my fourth visit to Dublin and third stay at the Westbury.  Each stay surpasses the last one in every way - room quality, attentive staff, outstanding service everywhere and the best breakfast around! Although everyone we encountered was amazing, I'd like to mention 2 staff members who stood out for their excellence - Guillaume Kopp (Front Office Manager) and Kleyton (afternoon tea in the Gallery).  Guillaume made sure we felt at home from the minute we walked into the hotel until we left 5 days later.  A true professional! Kleyton (sorry I don't know his last name!) served us tea in the Gallery, a Westbury first for my friend and me.  He was warm, friendly and attentive and made sure we lacked for nothing!! A real asset to your organization!  See you next October!!",5,2019,11,05
203,Great Hotel,"This hotel has an impressive lobby and excellent service. The main restaurant serves breakfast (tables of food or from the menu) and dinner. Dinner is quite expensive, but the food is tasty. The hotel bar is lovely and has a gorgeous sunroom. We were disappointed in our room. We got a deluxe king and it was very plain. It had a huge closet, but the bathroom was unexceptional. The glass shower ‚Äúdoor‚Äù only went half-way across and was a shower/tub combo. The toilet required multiple flushes. The shower was difficult to operate. 5 stars for the hotel, but 2 stars for the room.",4,2019,11,05
203,Exceptional!,"We recently had a wonderful stay at The Westbury.  The location was perfect as it was centrally located to shopping, pubs, St. Stephen‚Äôs Green, and walkable to major attractions.  The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable and made you feel special.  We will be back!",5,2019,11,04
203,Business Meeting,"The service is impeccable at the Westbury.  I planned a business meeting from out of the country.  The staff goes above and beyond.  The Westbury is an a fabulous location, walkable to everything you'd wish to do while in Dublin.  The concierge provided great recommendations for dinner.  Looking forward to going back as soon as possible.",5,2019,11,04
203,The best afternoon tea!,"We went to the Westbury for Afternoon tea for my sister's birthday. On arrival we were greeted by a friendly front of house member and shown to our table. We were served by a lovely waitress called Felicia who couldn't do enough for us over the course of our afternoon. She even organised an extra cake for my sisters birthday! Couldn't recommend it more, food was great and the team at the Westbury were brilliant but Felicia definitely made our afternoon even more enjoyable with her friendly nature",5,2019,11,03
203,Business Stay - Loved this hotel!,"This is such a beautiful hotel, it is like a taking a little step back in time. The atmosphere and ALL the staff were simply amazing.  The rooms are perfectly kept and bed was so comfortable.   I would stay here again in a heartbeat! ",5,2019,11,01
203,Dated Room with missing closet Door handle,"Overall I was very disappointed with the Westbury. Myself and my wife were really looking forward to it. She has done afternoon tea on occasions with friends and always mentioned she would love to stay. I had some meetings in Dublin and decided I would treat her to two nights away. I had emailed back Sofia T (who was hugely helpful) who sent me a drinks menu to put a bottle of Perseco in the room and I got an email back saying she was on leave and a link to another email was provided. I emailed this link with my request but when we entered the room there was no bottle waiting for us. On top of that myself and my wife were unimpressed with the room. It was dark, dated and fittings including the phone just didn't scream 5 star. I decided to bring this to Caroline's attention at the front desk. She apologised and offered a bottle of Perseco to the room but for me the moment was gone. I also mentioned I wasn't happy with the room and she brought me to another. For me it was only slightly better and after a long car journey I decided to head out with my wife and told Caroline to move our bags etc to our new room. 

We returned after a bite to eat in the city and when we got a good look around the room we really were amazed at how it could be offered to us in a 5Star hotel. I have attached a pic of a missing handle on the closet as you entered the room. As you can imagine we were unimpressed. In order for us to open the closet on that side we had to reach in and push the door from the back. For me this is unacceptable in a hotel room that is 5star and costs as much for one night. Also under the desk at the mirror there was a box on the all that was loose with wires coming out. not only was this aesthetically awful to look at but probably dangerous too. Infact on our last night the lamp on the desk blew and we had to call for someone to come and fix/replace the bulbs. Maybe this could be something to do with that box? Little small details like the wallpaper finish around light switch fittings looked amateur. The shower facilities were dated and as mentioned before it all didn't scream 5star. 

We have stayed in many places in Ireland and hotels with lesser star ratings have offered us much better rooms and amenities. Little things could be included. At the price one pays you could include maybe even a biscuit. In all we were unimpressed with the room and in no way reflects a 5star experience. The staff were super friendly and helpful, breakfast on both mornings was well presented and tasty but at the price per night it is very hard to overlook the rooms I am afraid.",2,2019,10,31
203,Great location,"Spent two nights here for a quick trip to Dublin.  The hotel location is perfect for visiting Dublin.  We booked through Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts program, which is supposed to have early check-in if available.  Unfortunately, our room was not available at 2pm, and wasn't available until around 3:30pm.  The staff at check-in (and throughout the hotel) were really nice - always willing to help.  We were upgraded to a ""studio suite"", with a large 4 poster bed.  The room itself was quite large, but the bathroom was tiny - warning for anyone over 6 ft., you will struggle to have a decent shower (and the bathrooms are tub/shower combo).  We had dinner at Wilde's on our first night.  It was also very good - great service, very good food and setting.

Unfortunately, our first night was horrendous in the room.  Our room was adjacent to Bruxelles, a neighboring bar/restaurant.  There was a loud rock band which played until after 2am, and even with ear plugs and Bose noise cancelling headphones, I could not sleep with the noise.  One of the worst nights I've had in a hotel.  We requested another room the next morning, and the hotel accommodated our request, giving us a similar room (with a similar tiny shower) - and we had a very quiet, restful night of sleep.

I think next time we will stay at the Merrion, as they have walk-in showers and are in a quieter location.  The Westbury location and service are fantastic, but I have to downgrade the rooms based on size of bathrooms/shower, and proximity to loud bars.",4,2019,10,30
203,Career Masterclass with James Sweetman,I often come here for events and meetings. It‚Äôs wonderful center location cannot be beaten! Great dining and bar options! I‚Äôve never stayed so can‚Äôt comment on rooms ect... but I‚Äôve always have a wonderful experience here.,5,2019,10,29
203,"Great location, friendly staff",I was expecting a little more elegance from a 5-star hotel but it's definitely nice and in a prime location. The room was nice and big with a large walk-in closet that featured a full-length mirror. Very friendly staff.,5,2019,10,28
203,Not a quality experience,"We have been at this hotel for two nights now. The first night, a wedding in the ballroom blasted music until 12:30 am, after we have been told it would end at 10:00 pm. The second night was dominated by boom, boom, boom, base from a near by club, until 3:30 am. This is totally unacceptable at this price. The employees are friendly and helpful.",1,2019,10,28
203,Afternoon Tea today 27th October 2019,"We had the pleasure of taking afternoon tea today in The Westbury and it was just perfect.  Service was professional, knowledgeable and friendly.  The setting overlooking Bruxelles Bar was just stunning and the selection on offer both savory and sweet was wonderful and the Westbury Blend tea good and strong.  We loved it and had the calmest and most endearing afternoon, thank you kera who showed us to our table and was so lovely and our waiters Remi and Scott who added superbly to our overall experience.  Thank you all and can't wait to come back.",5,2019,10,27
203,Great day in a great venue!,"We spent the afternoon in the Westbury yesterday for a girl‚Äôs catch-up. What a lovely day - even when booking lunch in Balfes and drinks in the side car bar afterwards the lady taking our booking was so helpful and chatted about our plans. 
We had a delicious brunch in Balfes which which is always amazing, especially the prawns and the Pecan torte! Staff were attentive even though it was very busy and while we were late to the bar there was no problem. It is one of my favourite places to go for either food or a drink! Can not recommend enough! ",5,2019,10,27
203,Evening in The Gallery,"I had an unexpected Sat night off work so I decided to meet 2 friends in The Gallery. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was cosy and welcoming and the lady who showed me to my seat was very natural and friendly. I need to mention our server Vadim though. He was so gentle, courteous and friendly and instead of standing over us to take our order, he would get down to our level  which I felt was very professional. He took the time to listen to our ramblings when we thought  we were being funny too!! But when we were leaving, he thanked us for being so friendly and that completely made our night. We had a wonderful relaxing evening.",5,2019,10,27
203,Ireland Trip,"Top notch hotel! From the time we checked in until we checked out we felt like we were royalty! Never before have we and so many employees make sure our stay was the best possible, and boy did they come thru!",5,2019,10,25
203,Never disappoints,"The Westbury is a wonderful hotel,in a perfect location for sightseeing,and shopping in dublin.it offers luxury,yet welcoming and relaxing ambience.staff are super friendly and efficient, treating all customers equally as important as the next.highly recommend to all,so looking forward to a return visit. Ps made an old NHS nurse feel like a celebrity.üòéüòÄ",5,2019,10,24
203,Could not have been better,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel as part of a special anniversary celebration. We were there for 7 nights in a beautiful, spacious studio suite with a 4 poster bed and comfortable seating area. All the staff ‚Äîdoormen, front desk, concierge, housekeeping and restaurant employees were top notch. As part of our package we had a full Irish breakfast that was very good and served in a lovely dining room. And did I mention that it‚Äôs location is absolutely perfect? Right in the middle of a beautiful part of the city and within walking distance to everything, it was still quiet enough to get a good night‚Äôs sleep. We can‚Äôt wait to go back!",5,2019,10,23
203,Westbury hotel,Currently staying in the Westbury hotel. Had their famous afternoon tea which was delicious. The staff were attentive friendly and on the whole lovely. I especially want to mention Erica she gave us her undivided attention she was outstanding. Looking forward to my next stay already.,5,2019,10,22
203,Another Outstanding Stay,"Cant believe it is over 2 years since we last stayed. The standards have even improved if that was possible. The staff are wonderfully helpful and friendly.
My only small reservation was the business centre. Only 1 Apple computer in a dark area. OK I'm over 70 but why not have decent lighting in a work computer work area. I had to ask the wonderful attendant to help me out with the unfamiliar Apple keyboard and just seeing the keyboard. This is a minor issue the hotel is outstanding.",5,2019,10,22
203,The perfect staying in Dublin,"The room was very welcoming, comfortable, very clean.
The staff were assertive and nice.
The hotel is in the center of Dublin, very easy to get to the attractions.
I enjoyed my staying and I will come back to this hotel for sure.",5,2019,10,22
203,Lauren,I had a lovely stay last month in the Westbury I was welcomed with all smiles at reception - one lady in particular who was so helpful and kind was a girl called Laura. She checked me in and gave me loads of things to do in the Dublin during My stay. Would love to come back soon !,5,2019,10,20
203,Afternoon tea,"Was just at Westbury with few of my friends for an afternoon tea. Was amazing experience, piano was playing beautifully. Was looked after by two girls Ieva and Felicia, they were both so friendly and helpful. We all felt so welcomed. Highly recommend this place and can't wait to come back here. 5 stars!",5,2019,10,20
203,Afternoon tea with Scott Roland,"Scott was the most fabulous host at The Westbury. Having stayed here before, I can thoroughly attest to his hospitality skills. He is attentive, polite and genuinely interested in the customer journey. He interacted with us regularly, and ensured we had the most amazing experience! üòçüòç",5,2019,10,20
203,Excellent ,"Lovely restaurant and ambiance. Would recommend to anyone. Service was brilliant, very chatty waiter, Scott Roland, who was an absolute pleasure. Recommended our drinks and served them with a smile. Will definitely be coming back!",5,2019,10,19
203,A very proper hotel,"The Westbury in central Dublin is well-appointed, comfortably furnished and with charming staff.  You arrive and are swept upstairs to a debonair receptionist and are shortly whisked to your room.  Not very large, it must be admitted, but as furnished as well as could be wished, and with a smart bathroom and I thought a very comfortable bed. Everything is done, within the constraints of a slightly boxy 1970s layout, to make the rooms as comfortable and personal as possible.   The views from the room are nothing special, but this is in the middle of a low-built City, it must be remembered.  Lots of eating options (NB Dubliners eat early, it seems, so don't come out at 10pm) -the spacious lounge offers bites and drinks, and there is a bistro and smart restaurant called Wilde.  This was, I thought, very good with excellent soup and salad and a great deal more to chose from.  It also offered, for a sole diner, a range of good wines by the glass.  Definitely the best Dublin hotel I've recently stayed in, and value for money.",5,2019,10,18
203,Really Enjoyable,"From the moment we checked in until we left, it was the most enjoyable stay we have had at a hotel.  The entire staff is professional and courteous.  The rooms are spotless and comfortable.  The food is delicious.  The location was perfect for walking to so many locations.  It was easy to see that The Westbury Hotel had made that extra effort in assuring you that your stay was luxurious and pampered.
Staying here was the highlight of our visit to Ireland.  We look forward to returning.  Thank You!",5,2019,10,18
203,A little treat,"Visited this wonderful hotel in July and was treated to dinner in Wilde for my birthday. Was back in Dublin last weekend and called in for the pleasure of tea and scones last Monday. Staff were so friendly and welcoming. Tea and scones were gorgeous. Would be a dream to stay here, everything so perfect. I'll hopefully be back!",5,2019,10,18
203,Wonderful Hotel,"The quality of the room and the service were exceptional. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! I was especially impressed with the attention paid to my child. This was a family vacation and it was important to me that he did not feel like he was tagging along on his parents' trip. The hotel staff definitely made him feel important, and that meant a lot to me.",5,2019,10,17
203,Afternoon Tea!,"We are in Dublin for a friend‚Äôs wedding and one of her events was afternoon tea at the Westbury. She had an area of the lounge reserved for her tea. The staff welcomed me to the Westbury and accompanied me upstairs so I would know exactly where to go. The tea was served by several staff, all of whom were so courteous and delightful, especially Felicia. The tea was immaculate with such delicious sandwiches and petit fours all served beautifully. This was a wonderfully enjoyable experience, and I highly recommend it. ",5,2019,10,17
203,Elegant yet welcoming to all,"The Westbury is right smack dab in the middle of where you want to be in Dublin.  You can walk to all the shops, pubs, Trinity College, just about everywhere you want to go!  There are lots of winding little alleys and streets, very photogenic!  The main dining area is always fun to sit and snack or sip in.  We ate at Wilde each morning.  Fabulous buffet with lots of variety.  Also includes hot cooked to order items too!  Our room was large and lovely.  This is the hotel I will stay at each time I visit Dublin.",5,2019,10,16
203,Wonderful stay!,I spent 4 nights at the Westbury and loved it! The hotel is in a perfect location and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. Breakfast at WILDE was very good and nightcaps at Sidecar were also good. The bed is one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. Room was lovely. The only drawback was the bathroom needed a bit of upgrading. I'd stay again for sure. ,5,2019,10,15
203,Location and Attention to Detail,My recent visit to Dublin was amazing in large part due to the location and attention paid by the staff at the Wesbury hotel!  I look forward to visiting again soon!  The room was well appointed and clean.  The staff was very attentive to my every need and they anticipated and offered additional amenities. Check-in was easy and I was escorted to my room.  I was pleased with the size and style of the room.  It was spacious and comfortable.  The linens and the beds made for perfect sleep and I was able to tackle the city well rested and ready to go!  The breakfast was excellent and so were the two dinners that I enjoyed in the restaurant Balfe.  I highly recommend this hotel! ,5,2019,10,15
203,Fabulous hotel in prime location,"My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel for a week.  We are frequent and enthusiastic travelers and although we have stayed at many fine hotels, none was finer than the Westbury.  The service from was absolutely top-notch.  It really seemed that everyone who worked there, including  at the bell stand, the front desk, the concierge, the chambermaids,  or the servers in all three restaurants, made an extra effort to be pleasant and helpful without being officious.  And did I mention the food?  The daily breakfasts were wonderful, as were  evening meals we had at Balfe‚Äôs and Wilde.  Afternoon tea was incredible and not to be missed.  We were traveling with several other couples and when we went to the Sidecar, the server brought small glasses of Prosecco for us to enjoy while we waited for our drinks‚Äîsuch an unexpected treat and further proof that the folks at the Westbury bend over backwards for their guests.  We would never stay anywhere else while visiting Dublin. ",5,2019,10,14
203,Too much attention?,"I‚Äôm not fond of turndown practices. Once the room is cleaned in the morning/afternoon, I like to think it‚Äôs my private space. I checked in to this hotel at 4:30 pm and assumed I could leave my stuff askew after throwing on some clothes for dinner. I returned at 8 pm to find the room practically rearranged. A load of things I had to undo: slippers in a plastic bag that I had to put back in the closet; a bottle of water and a glass on the tiny bedside table where my eyeglasses and my phone have to go. I didn‚Äôt know where the bottle of water came from, whether I‚Äôd get charged 10 euro if I drank it, or where to put it so it was clear I didn‚Äôt drink it.

I realize a notion of privacy is a ‚Äúfirst-world‚Äù problem, but I think these hotels need to present the option of refusing turndown service at check-in. They consider it pampering; I consider it annoying at best, and downright invasive in its most egregious form.",4,2019,10,14
203,Five Star all the way,"The Westbury is a beautiful property in an amazing location. I can't recommend enough. The lobby and restaurants are clean and have amazing ambience. The rooms are beautifully designed, with awesome bathrooms and comfortable beds.",5,2019,10,14
203,Perfect Location,"One can not ask for a more perfect location in Dublin.  The Westbury, is near fully booked on a year round basis.  We were able to walk to everything we wanted to see.  The rooms are immaculate, but on the small side.  The staff was superb and the concierges were extremely helpful and informative.  Our favorite place, to end our day of touring, was their pub located at the main entrance of the hotel.  There is some construction in the area, but the rooms were quiet.  There are many excellent pubs and restaurants nearby.",5,2019,10,14
203,Heather Skinner 'Hostess with the Mostess'. ,"It is always a cozy feeling going into a luxury hotel and being greeted so warmly by Heather. She brings a familiarity and an honesty to the atmosphere in The Westbury. She has got a great skill of inviting people in and relaxing them into such a stunning setting. My friends and I always speak so highly of her and she is great for the business. Compliments to her hosting skills and being so kind to my sisters and I, and to several friends who have been in there to have a night cap and to enjoy the consistently amazing and superb atmosphere from the Westbury. 
J.Wong",5,2019,10,13
203,Wonderful stay,"The westbury surpassed our expectations on a recent stay. I wanted to write a note to say thank you and recommend anyone on the fence to go ahead and just book. From the start...due to my wife‚Äôs recent injury the hotel was accommodating and allowed us change the date of our stay. Then, they still remembered that it was originally due to be a stay for our wedding anniversary and gave us a wonderful cake surprise. We loved the staff. Particularly the staff at the bar were fantastic and we spent too much time there in the beautiful surroundings.  This will be our go to hotel from now on in Dublin.",5,2019,10,12
203,Wonderful hotel & location ,"Wonderful rooms .. great service and so perfectly located. The concierge service is wonderful.. they are really helpful. 
I also loved the idea that we could have breakfast in the room ( since it was included in our room ) 
Would definitely stay there next time we come to Dublin. ",5,2019,10,11
203,Perfect location,"We had an enjoyable stay in The Westbury Hotel. Delicious food, the best pancakes we have had for a long time.  Wonderful atmosphere. We we however disappointed by the quality of our room. For the price we paid in a 5 star hotel we didn't expect to see stains on the furniture and water pressure was very poor in the shower. I couldn't wash my hair. Also, when we came back late in the evening feeling cold we wanted to sit by the fire and have a nightcap. We were told we could not sit by the fire as that area was closed because they didn't want to serve us there. There were a few tables marked ""reserved"" but no sign of people arriving. It is misleading. It was almost 9 pm and the  lobby was not very busy. We decided to sit by the fire anyway because we were paying guests. This is not acceptable for a 5 star hotel.",4,2019,10,11
203,Long Wait for Our Room,"We had a fantastic holiday in Ireland.  Unfortunately our last night at the Westbury was our only low point.  Our room was not ready at 3 pm and were told multiple times it would be ready shortly. The front desk was lacking in communication  and did little to ready our accommodations.  The front desk manager thought by offering us a drink would be an appropriate solution and stated the delay was due to late checkouts. We stated numerous times we were open to another room.  It finally took a supervisor walking past the desk to expedite our check in. 

Our deluxe room was located just above the the delivery garage creating ongoing noise and a sleepless night. 

This is my first TripAdvisor review  I felt compelled to write the review so others can think twice before selecting this ‚Äú5 star ‚Äú hotel.",2,2019,10,10
203,A Most Disappointing Visit,"We visited the Westbury twice over late August and early Sept. The staff were delightful & found us a lovely room with great outlook, but it went downhill badly from there on.
We discovered the air-con. was broken and with the sun pouring into the room all day it made for an insufferable night. The bedside light didn't work. Same for the desk lamp. The fridge didn't work (& we needed that for medication). The TV was malfunctioning. The phone message light flashed continuously & couldn't be turned off by the operator. There were attempts to rectify some of these issues by to no avail. Some 10 attempts to reach room service went unanswered - we eventually got there by going through the operator. The call then went through immediately, so no problem with being too busy. 

We chalked it up to bad luck but informed management on departure & again in their online survey. The hotel was most generous in rebating one nights tariff, but we would much rather have paid & enjoyed the promised comfort.
We returned some two weeks later and were greeted personally by the 'graduate manager' and shown to the same room. One assumed this was to demonstrate 'proof of action'. Extraordinarily, not one thing had been rectified. We didn't know whether this was an act of retribution or incompetence. Needless to say we moved to a lesser (functioning) room.
We laugh now about the somewhat Fault Towers experience but it didn't seem much fun at the time. Moreover it seems an amazing experience for an acclaimed 5 star hotel.
We are generally given to doing trip advisors when we have a great experience, and writing direct if unsatisfied. However having already spoken & written in the survey we felt this experience called for a special mention.",2,2019,10,08
203,Afternoon Tea,"This wasn't something I'd have normally done but was given a gift of a voucher for afternoon tea. We were sat by a window which was lovely as it was a cold & wet day outside and very cosy inside. Perfect spot to watch the world going past. Staff were very pleasant but didn't come back over to check in how things were or if we needed anything else & it was difficult to get their attention. It might have been nice to try a few different types of tea. The pot i had alone of one tea was big enough for 4 cups. Food was faultless & tasty, and fresh.",5,2019,10,04
203,Wonderful hotel in the center of Dublin,"The Westbury is a wonderful, well managed hotel with a well trained and friendly staff.  It is located in the center of Dublin but is still quiet and dignified.  It has a good combination of business people and tourists for clientele.",5,2019,10,03
203,Elegant hotel with top of the line service and breakfasts,"Perfect for a 3-night stay in downtown Dublin on our first visit.  Close to Hop On/Hop Off bus stops, St Stephen Green (park), pubs and restaurants.  Easy walk to Temple Bar quarter too.  Great location. The breakfast room and buffet were exceptional.  Staff was very friendly and professional.  One downside was the long wait for our room to be ready the day of our arrival, even though we asked for an early check-in. A pub was located right outside the front door to the right and a very good restaurant to the left if you don't want to eat in the hotel.",5,2019,10,02
203,As brilliant as ever! ,"I stayed again in this lovely hotel recently. It is truly exquisite. The staff are so friendly, the check in lovely, the room amazing, bed so comfortable. I love everything about this hotel. It is truly wonderful. I ate in the lobby this time and the food was really good, portions massive. I cannot wait to return. ",5,2019,09,30
203,Best hotel in downtown Dublin,Stayed at the Westbury for 3 nights on our Ireland road trip. Lovely hotel just a block of the main shopping area and many fine restaurants and attractions. Crisp immaculate rooms with all of the services of a five star hotel. We would highly recommend.,5,2019,09,29
203,Exceptional Venue,"We stayed in the Westbuty for a two night stay.  It is the perfect location for any trip to the City.  Very luxurious.  Very happy with our room.  Bed extremely comfortable and loved the pillows. Hope to return again. 
",5,2019,09,29
203,The Westbury is always my top choice when I come to Dublin,I've been to Dublin a number of times for business and The Westbury is by far my favorite hotel.  The location is great and the overall value you get is exceptional.  The staff also goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome.  ,5,2019,09,28
203,Decent but not spectacular ,"Hotel lobby is lovely. First room we were given the keys to was on the second floor looking out at a low adjoining roof and mechanical equipment. After asking for a room with a less depressing view we were given a room on the 4th floor with a similar type of view, though slightly improved by being higher up. The room is perfectly nice. Bed comfortable. Bathroom could use a renovation and LIGHTS. The lighting is so dim in the bathroom that it‚Äôs a bit absurd.  The lighting system in the room itself is overly complex and silly. Had one dinner at Wilde, the restaurant in the hotel. Food was ok though it should have been better at the very high price point. The first two breakfasts I ordered poached eggs.  The first day they came out with fully cooked yolks. I sent them back asking for softer poached eggs rather than hard cooked. The second set they sent out were almost as hard cooked as the first. Second day I didn‚Äôt learn my lesson.  Same thing. Received two hard cooked ‚Äúpoached‚Äù eggs on a single muffin half that was cold.  The edges of the eggs themselves seemed cold so I am assuming they prepoached a bunch of eggs and then tried to reheat them. The kitchen staff needs to learn to cook eggs properly if they are going to offer them on the menu. Finally, the music in the breakfast room restaurant was VERY loud day two. We complained as did the people at the table next to us. They said they couldn‚Äôt turn it down or off. Very unpleasant at 9:00 a.m.  ",3,2019,09,28
203,Best of Dublin,We really loved staying at the Westbury. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are very nice and helpful. The location is perfect too! We ate at Wilde and had a great dinner and the breakfast buffet was great!,5,2019,09,26
203,Elegance with great location,"Second time staying there. Beautiful hotel with excellent service and lovely breakfast available in a nice setting with table service. Right on Clifton Street, 5 minute walk to Trinity College/Book of Kells, very central spot. 2 double bed room okay but fairly basic and a bit too pricey.",4,2019,09,24
203,Afternoon tea at the Westbury with Shauna,"My family and I had the absolute pleasure of celebrating my sisters birthday with afternoon tea at The Westbury on Saturday. I can not recommend this lovely dining experience enough, the setting is stunning the food delicious and beautifully crafted and to top it off you take it all in accompanied by some beautiful music played by a lovely pianist /harpist. Last but certainly not least I know the whole party would like to join me in giving a special shout out and thanks to our lovely host Shauna for taking such good care of us on our visit. Shaunas customer service is top class, she went completely above and beyond to cater to all our needs including some tricky dietary requirements. Shauna`s presentation and service matched perfectly to the expectation and  standard of such a reputable hotel. Overall we loved our afternoon tea at The Westbury and will most definitely be back!",5,2019,09,23
203,A Birthday Afternoon Tea ...,"A memorable afternoon celebrating my daughter and grandson's birthdays in beautiful surroundings, with a sensation for the eyes and taste of danties accompanied with speciality teas that were a treat to try.  My daughter and grandson were also presented with special deserts for their birthdays .. which was a lovely touch.  All the staff were perfect being attentive but not overbearing especially Shauna whose easy friendly manner added to our whole experience.  Despite our best efforts there were still cakes left which we took away with us in a stylish cake box.  A perfect 5 star experience",5,2019,09,23
203,Lovely pre-baby treat,"My husband and I stayed in the Westbury as a little pre-baby treat. The room was immaculately clean, the staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was fabulous. We also availed of the parking service which was great. We really enjoyed our stay.",5,2019,09,23
203,Drink üç∑ on The Terrace,We went to The Terrace in The Westbury last evening after a show in the Gaiety. It is a ideal spot for a relaxing post theatre drink. The drink selection is first class and the service is excellent in luxurious surroundings. While we were having our drink I saw a friend posted on FB he was just finishing his 18th Anniversary meal in Shanahan‚Äôs on the Green. They dropped in and we bought them a drink to celebrate their Anniversary. A lovely night with good company in the nicest spot in Dublin.,5,2019,09,22
203,The Wonderful Westbury !,"My husband and I stayed at the Westbury in early September for three nights. The Westbury hotel rooms are wonderful - beautifully decorated, large rooms, comfortable beds, large bathrooms. The breakfast buffet was fantastic. The location is perfect - centrally located. But, the best part about the Westbury is the staff. Everyone at the Westbury is kind, considerate and worried about your welfare. We will be promoting the Westbury to all. Thank you all so much. Your staff made our already fantastic visit even more wonderful !",5,2019,09,22
203,Birthday afternoon tea ,"We had such a beautiful experience at the Westbury for my birthday. The attention to detail was really good; including a birthday desert which was a nice touch. 
The food was superb and the waiter Scott was so friendly and professional. 

We had a window seat booked but there was some miscommunication regarding this, and it was sorted as soon as we mentioned this. 
Would highly recommend!  ",5,2019,09,21
203,A welcome return ,"Maybe the 4th or 5th time I‚Äôve stayed here with family, always a wonderful touch of luxury in a superb location. 
Unfortunately on this occasion our visit was slightly marred by a technical issue in our room. However: the issue was addressed promptly with courtesy, professionalism, and customer service that goes with the five star attitude you receive at The Westbury. As such, thoroughly recommend a stay here, we will be returning as soon as our calendar allows!",5,2019,09,21
203,Gorgeous hotel in Dublin,"Impeccable staff, fabulous beds and wonderful amenities all around . Do not miss the afternoon tea ! The hotel is ideally situated for great walking expeditions throughout the city. Best part of the hotel is the staff. They will bend over backwards to provide for your every comfort . Truly an exquisite place to stay while in Dublin. ",5,2019,09,19
203,Excellent experience at The Gallery,"I am new in Dublin and my girlfriend (raised and born here) took me to the Westbury to work for a couple of hours while having tea and coffee. The place is is beautiful ‚Äî very well decorated with nice furniture and a lovely vibe ‚Äî but the best was the service, especially Remi and Cameron who made me feel very welcomed.

We'll be going back to the Westbury for breakfast and lunch soon, and so should you!",5,2019,09,18
203,Wonderful Hotel and People,"We just returned from a fabulous trip in Ireland and spent 4 nights at the Westbury Hotel in Dublin. My wife and I couldn't be more impressed with the entire hotel staff and fantastic service. Our entire experience, from the moment we arrived until our last day, was truly amazing!
A special big thanks to:
Patrick - Wilde Restaurant and entire staff
Patricia - The Gallery and entire staff
David - Bellman and entire staff

We will be back again!",5,2019,09,17
203,Excellent location freindly staff,"First visit to Dublin and chose the Westbury based on reviews on this site. Turned out to be an excellent choice. Staff were very helpful and friendly, room was clean and well appointed, spacious enough for the two of us. Meals at the restaurant and the lounge were also top notch. Would definitely repeat.",5,2019,09,17
203,The Westbury-- a true gem in the heart of Dublin,"The Westbury should be a destination for every discriminating traveler-- from the very professional and welcoming team members to the elegant ambiance and stellar drinks and meals..... it was a most memorable and enjoyable stay, and we look forward to returning every chance we get! ",5,2019,09,16
203,Great Location Great service Small room,"The service in this hotel is superb as is the location. 
The only problem, and it was a significant one, was the size and furnishings in a Classic King room. The room was small and there are few available shelves and drawers. It was painful to not be able to unpack and for the two of us having to live out of our suitcases in a cramped room for four days.
Summary: Paid top dollar for cramped, painful accommodations in a superbly located hotel with impeccable service.",4,2019,09,15
203,Perfect location but not so comfortable hotel ,"The location is just perfect! You walk right into Crafton street and in the middle of action. Can‚Äôt go wrong and never be board!  The hotel has an impressive lobby, decor, and variety of bars and restaurants indoor and outdoor sitting. Plenty of workers to assist the guests with their basic needs. Chandeliers are abundant and make the place feel and look fancy and absolutely a 4-5 start hotel. 

I have stayed here for business 4-5 times and have had variety rooms ranging from a single, to a queen, and even an upgraded suite. I‚Äôve found the beddings and large pillows very soft and comfortable. The bathrooms are tight and not easy to use comfortably as compared to US top hotels. But again the property is old and we all know Dublin is a tightly spaced city!  

The breakfast quality is very good. Continental or made to order selections are wonderful plus a full table service. The biggest disappointments for me are the smallest little gym that is around specially for such top end hotel. And only open at 7am. Which is really too late for the business travelers. I had to beg them to let me in early and they made some exceptions but I found it very annoying. The other option was to go across the street and pay ‚Ç¨10 per visit!! 

Finally, the cost of the hotel per night is very pricey.",4,2019,09,14
203,Fabulous Stay,"My wife and I stayed three nights at the Westbury to kick off a two week Ireland adventure. The stay coincided with my wife‚Äôs birthday. The Hotel was great; conformant, attentive and elegant. One evening after dinner out we stopped into the Gallery at the Hotel. Staff was great, ambience terrific and a trio that was marvelous. When Patricia, who was helping us, found out it my wife‚Äôs birthday she brought not only cocktails but a special treat with ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù on the plate. Great! Thank you Patricia and for that matter the rest of the staff at the Westbury! Above and beyond!",5,2019,09,13
203,Exceptional Service and Best location in Dublin,Westbury hotel is situated in the middle of the city center in Dublin and close to the best bars and restaurants. The staff are extremely courteous and friendly and help you resolve issues very quickly. Rooms are extremely comfortable too. ,5,2019,09,13
203,Outstanding Service; Outstanding Location ,"We had such an enjoyable experience at The Westbury in Dublin. The hotel, and our room, were very comfortable. The restaurant was adorable- the decor and ambiance felt cottage like. We were most impressed with the customer service. We keep kosher. Prior to our arrival Jack Fitzsimons, guest relations, reached out via email to ensure we were set upon arrival. We had prearranged to have a weeks worth of pre-made and individually wrapped and frozen kosher meals (local caterer) delivered to the hotel a few days before our arrival. We received confirmation of receipt and storage prior to leaving the States. Two meals were defrosted and ready to be warmed (double wrapped) the night we arrived. Jack went above and beyond to ensure we were taken care of, and we were most appreciative. The location of the hotel is amazing. Walking distance to most everything. Would definitely return. ",5,2019,09,12
203,Wonderful stay,"We are coming to the end of a fantastic stay at The Westbury. The breakfast, The Rooms, The staff are all amazing. The Lounge is such a wonderful spot to relax, or meet friends. A big thank you to Deborah at breakfast time and Derek at the entrance, you made our stay. We will be back!",5,2019,09,11
203,Kindness and attention to detail,"I haven't felt compelled to write a review in ages, but I could not let this moment pass.  My husband and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary and went into the Westbury for a glass of champagne, as we had done when we got engaged all those years ago.
The waiting staff, especially Shauna #5 made such a fuss about us, that I actually shed a tear.  It doesn't take much to be kind and thoughtful, but it can mean so much to the recipient.  Well done!!",5,2019,09,10
203,Perfect place for a special treat or celebration Lunch,"Had Lunch here with the family recently to celebrate a birthday. From the time we arrived the staff were so nice ,extremely professional, not pushy but helpful. The food was amazing , gorgeous presentation and ample portions. Not cheap but worth it for the experience",5,2019,09,08
203,Once again....FIRST CLASS,"Having stayed in the Westbury numerous times, our last stay was just as special as our first. From start to finish our experience has been absolutely first class and we could not recommend this hotel enough. Our last few visits have been made extra special by Adrian and Michael in the cocktail bar where nothing is ever too much bother for these guys. Looking forward to our best stay already.",5,2019,09,06
203,Loveliest hotel in Ireland,"We loved this hotel. And that says a lot because we are very picky and high maintenance. After a lot of research, I was told to stay here by locals. It is just our style: glamours, top level service, and great location. The entire staff was so gregarious and accommodating, they were always trying to make our stay even better. They reached out in advance and really dotted on us the entire trip. The location of the hotel was perfect. Close to everything. We walked to a lot of places. Loved loved loved it. Joseph Downing, one of the managers welcomed us as soon as we got there. He gave us his card so if we needed anything we could call him. As was Jack, another manager, made sure we had the top level of service when we had some issues. We also had a lot of help from Eddie at the concierge planning our trip. One of our favorite parts of the trip was planned through the concierge. We hired a driver to take us around Ireland (to the cliffs and castles etc) for an entire day! Our driver was Derek and we loved him so much. Over all could not be more pleased.",5,2019,09,06
203,"Nice property, great location","The Westbury is a lovely hotel and really well situated in Dublin. That being said, our stay unfortunately had some issues. The AC had weird noises and it was never really resolved. We had a VIP on the floor that caused delays with the elevators and noise. And, we could clearly hear the room next to us, which seemed odd for this level of hotel. The breakfast was very nice, if a bit spotty with service and the service in the bar was indifferent. The restaurant for dinner was great food, but the wait staff need to be trained not to say things like ""the year doesn't matter for the wine"". Didn't inspire a lot of confidence. So, all this to say it was a mixed bag. What I will say is that they went above and beyond to make it better, and I will be giving them another try in the future. I think we just had a goofy confluence of events, but overall it's a lovely property.",4,2019,09,05
203,Fabulous hotel with Grafton Street on your step!,"Finally got to stay last weekend. Beautiful hotel. Staff extremely helpful. Valet car parking ( extra but good value). Room very comfortable. A little small but we are talking dublin city centre. Very comfy beds and pillows. Peaceful and relaxing.  Windows have an extra covering for noise so very quiet and no sirens will wake you up! All the toiletries are top notch. Breakfast in the morning in the conservatory is stunning! Such an array of nuts, breads, pastries. Staff were excellent & efficient. Will def come back again soon. ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,2019,09,05
203,Wonderful Stay,"Stayed here for a special birthday on Sept 2nd , The Westbury is ideally situated right in the centre of town,  our bedroom was quiet with plenty of space, storage and a very comfortable queen bed  , the staff were professional, lovely, and very attentive.
We had dinner for 12 people in the Wilde Restaurant in the evening, the dinner group menu provided excellent food, with plenty of choice , the Heirloom Beetroot salad and fillet of beef especially note worthy.
Special thanks to The Westbury staff for a complimentary bottle of Prosecco and dessert cake on arrival and for birthday cake in the evening , you made my stay truly memorable for all the right reasons.
I look forward to staying with you again and have much pleasure giving your hotel 5 star status and a 5 star recommendation for anyone wondering if they should stay in your hotel , do . ",5,2019,09,04
203,September break.,This was my first visit to Dublin and we chose The Westbury because of its location. The service was excellent (apart from a minor problem with my washbasin) and the staff were helpful and courteous at all times. I would particularly recommend afternoon tea; the food and the service were better than I have experienced in the Ritz.,4,2019,09,04
203,Touching gesture!,"We enjoyed a warm and perfectly professional welcome for a reunion on a Tuesday evening. Fernanda and team, having heard of our special meetup, surprised us with a personalised, complimentary dessert! A joy from start to finish.",5,2019,09,03
203,Lunch in the Foyer,"The Westbury hotel is not cheap but it enjoys a great location just off Grafton Street, so like a lot of people, I use it on a regular basis for meetings when I'm in town. I had a chicken Tikka Wrap with salad recently and it was both delicious and healthy.",4,2019,09,02
203,Wonderful Hotel Central Location,"This is a beautiful hotel, tucked just away from the hustle and bustle of Grafton Street, but so close to it and local Dublin attractions. The welcome is warm and staff continue to be attentive, professional and helpful, from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave. Inside this hotel is elegant and modern, with the large chandeliers and grand staircase you would expect of a hotel of this calibre. It is spotlessly clean.The lounge area is roomy, very comfortable (we lounged by the open fire after a meal in 'Wilde' and each drank a courtesy glass of house champagne - wonderful) and luxurious in design. The terrace restaurant is airy and light by day feels intimate by night with soft lighting and a relaxed ambience. Our room (an accessible studio suite) was spacious, with a really comfortable bed, two soft velvet deep recline chairs, a table and chairs and an easy to use, but attractive bathroom with a walk in/sit down shower. At night when you return to your room, there is a special turn down with chocolates on the bed (Butler's Irish, hmmm, a different flavour each night), the soft lamps switched on and gentle music playing. This was a trip to celebrate a special anniversary and all of the staff made us feel very special and left us with very happy memories. All credit to the chefs, who create delicious, mouth watering dishes that are so prettily presented and the portions are generous, none of that one french bean and square inch of meat that you get in some 'nouvelle cusine' hotel restaurants, where you leave feeling like you need to get a bag of chips on the way home. We ate in the hotel restaurant on our anniversary night and the waiter was very helpful and politely attentive without being cloying. Though not cheap, this restaurant is not snobby. It is classy, but relaxed and we got the feeling it would be fine to order one dessert and two spoons! Breakfasts are just great, so nicely cooked and service is excellent. Decaf tea that actually tastes like a good strong cuppa. Porridge made with water was no problem at all and made to be just right, with a delightful plate of small dishes containing spiced sugar, raisins and a tiny jar of Irish honey on the side.The cocktail 'Sidecar' bar is gorgeous and again, the staff cannot do enough for you.Once you sit down, it's hard to get up and leave. Your roasted nuts are replenished without having to ask. Try a 'GIn Sling' you will not be disappointed. Altogether a brilliant experience, a lovely stay. The biggest thing was the attention to detail. We felt looked after. We would love to return one day. Thank you, Westbury.",5,2019,09,02
203,Great Afternoon Tea,"I went today for the Afternoon tea at Westbury Hotel. I've never felt more spoiled. Felicia and Sarah took care of us. Nothing was too much for them. The sandwiches were great, the cookies amazing...nothing to complain about. I can't wait to go back.",5,2019,09,01
203,Southern travelers,"This was an excellent hotel, location and staff! I would highly recommend this hotel. Enjoyed being able to walk to dinner and the shops were right out the front doors. I plan to stay at the Westbury when we come back!",5,2019,09,01
203,Exceptional drinks and service,"Great central location! Warm, inviting, friendly service! My highlight would have to be the visit I paid to the Side Car Bar where Adrian and Stefanie kept me company while I waited for my flight, their drinks and banter made my stay in Dublin! I'll be sure to come back!",5,2019,08,30
203,Not As Advertised ,"I spent a considerable amount of time researching hotels and decided on the Westbury. I also made sure I corresponded via email and phone conversation about how important this occasion was. I explained the importance of a beautiful room and most importantly the location of the room. I specifically asked for ‚Äúa pretty view‚Äù from our room and was willing to pay for it. However our view was looking at a crane and construction site. When I inquired about it, I was rudely told ‚Äúoh well it‚Äôs what you have‚Äù! 
Most disturbing though was the fact that after check-in at 1:30 (we knew we were early) we were told we‚Äôd be called when the room was ready but we could leave our luggage there and it would be in our room upon arrival. By 4:30 we still hadn‚Äôt received a call that our room was ready so we came back to check. We were told our room was ready and our luggage was in the room. When we got to the room the door was propped wide open with no luggage was to be found. 
We immediately called the desk and they insisted it had been delivered to the room yet it was nowhere in sight. A man named Ivan came up and said he‚Äôd delivered it himself yet it wasn‚Äôt there. Ivan went to check all security camera footage to locate our missing luggage. Come to find out, another bellman came and removed it thinking it had belonged to the previous occupant. After a lot of frantic worrying and wasting time, our luggage was finally located in an area for guests that had already checked out! 
To have all of the above happen our first few hours in Dublin on what was supposed to be ‚Äúour dream‚Äù vacation was a horrible start and a complete waste of our short time in Dublin. The Westbury absolutely did not live up to its supposed reputation of a five star hotel. In fact, in our experience it was anything but that and the way in which the whole debacle was handled was a cursory note with a box of chocolates and a bottle of champagne at our ‚Ç¨400.00 afternoon tea. The best part of our stay there was our server, Marta for our afternoon tea that was a very special thank you for friends. Think twice before booking this very expensive hotel, as there are other options in town. ",2,2019,08,28
203,Passing by,We were in town and went into the sidecar after a day of shopping and Heather the hostess was very accommodating for us. She was very welcoming and warm as it was our first Vist to the hotel. We will be back.,5,2019,08,26
203,TrueType excellent hotel. Lovely food and excellent wine - by the glass!,Truly excellent hotel. Very nice room and great location. Excellent breakfast choice.Lovely food at Balfe‚Äôs and excellent wine - by the glass! This matters to me as my partner drinks lager. I would stay here again.,5,2019,08,26
203,"Amazing hotel, staff and Food","We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights recently and I couldn‚Äôt fault it at all. The food was amazing we particularly enjoyed breakfast, the staff in all areas from checking in To checking out were amazing. Location was great with walking distance to everything, would recommend to everyone",5,2019,08,25
203,Not a five star Leading Hotel of the world,"Really disappointed with the room and with the size of the bathroom.
Not deserve to be a Leading Hotel of the world 
We booked a Deluxe room nearly 500 euros per night and requested a high floor room to get a quiet room and they gave us a room in the second floor facing to a street with works in progress.
This is not the room that we expected.",1,2019,08,24
203,The Ultimate Hotel,"This was our first time visiting Dublin and I cannot stress the fabulous time we had staying at the Westbury.  The staff, service, cleanliness, food and cocktails are beyond any other 5 star hotel we have stayed.

We had tour planned with Elegant Irish Tours/Paddywagon Tours (DO NOT book the through them!) long story short, we made a reservation, they never showed for a 7:15am pick up.  Joseph was with us the entire time waiting for them and when a few minutes past and they didn‚Äôt show, he immediately contacted them only to find out the bus left and was not coming to pick us up even though I had all emails from them.  Joseph immediately took us to the concierge, Thomas within minutes planned a fabulous day for us beyond what we expected! They got us transportation, explained to driver where we were going and exactly what we wanted to see and do.

I mentioned to Joseph I was looking for a specific brand of whiskey, within minutes not only did he come back to me with 2 stores that carried it that was close by, but also with pricing from each stores and offered for a staff member to run and purchase it........now that‚Äôs service!

Every time we left the hotel both Joseph and Kevin were there to accommodate us, I felt like we were family, not just a guest.

The hotel location is right on Grafton, so many pub, restaurants, variety of stores for shopping and centrally located for sightseeing.

I‚Äôm giving the Westbury Hotel 10 stars for their outstanding accommodations and service!

",5,2019,08,24
203,Ladies Day Out,"I recently spent the day in The Westbury with some girlfriends. We had the pleasure of dining in Wilde where we enjoyed fabulous service from the time we walked in & ordered a drink before our meal until the time we left after enjoying the most gorgeous food. We crossed the first floor of the hotel & entered a stylish bar called The Sidecar which was very busy, the hostess Heather was very accommodating & found us a table. Heather & the staff made us feel welcome & for the few hours we spent in the bar their service was fantastic, a lovely pleasant bunch too. For years now we have graced The Shelbourne while out in Dublin, no more the relaxed professional & fun atmosphere in The Westbury blew us away & we are looking forward to visiting again.",5,2019,08,23
203,Fabulous hotel in the heart of Dublin,"You will love this hotel right off Grafton Street. The property is beautiful with a wonderful art collection, rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the food is fantastic. The staff is more than accommodating from front desk, to conceirge, to the restaurants, to the chambermaids. I can't recommend it highly enough!",5,2019,08,20
203,"Lovely, professional and clean.","We stayed here for 3 nites. Our room except for someones sushi left in the fridge was immaculate. The rooms are large and spacious and quiet. The staff of this hotel is top notch. No ego or pretentious attitude. We were dead tired from a flying nightmare over 13 hours of delays, yada yada. But at checkin we were treated as nicely as if the Queen herself were checking in. Patricia from Portugal, who the next day served us High-Tea completely charmed my husband with her impeccable manners and professionalism. It was an extraordinary experience. Even for my red-neck cowboy who does not drink tea. Unless it has bourbon in it!  They accommodated him with no qualms whatsoever. In fact, she got him to go from being Mr Grumpy to being completely willing to stay and he admitted to me later he very much enjoyed himself. No small feat! This is a wonderful hotel with great art (check out their floral arrangements as it is high art too), good rooms size, cleancleanclean, and an excellent staff. In an excellent location.",4,2019,08,19
203,Dublin stay,"great hotel - great stay. i do recommend a lot staying at the Westbury Hotel. Greatly located, easy access to everything in the city. Easy access from/to the airport of Dublin. I recommend an Irish Breakfast - its just amazing. ",5,2019,08,19
203,Great Premium Hotel in heart of Dublin!,"This is a wonderful hotel in general - comfortable, luxurious, with a wonderful bar and many amenities.  Great staff as well!  Location is perfect - about a block off Grafton street, and walking distance from literally hundreds of bars and restaurants without being consumed by them.",5,2019,08,18
203,Stay at Westbury,Very friendly staff ... exceptional rooms....great location. Every experience here at this hotel has not disappointed. I visit my family every two years and ALWAYS stay at the Westbury. And the location can't be beat.,5,2019,08,17
203,Wonderful,"I loved this hotel.  The staff was so friendly and very accommodating.  Concierge was very knowledgeable.  Rooms were pristine with comfy beds and lovely turndown service. Location was excellent.  Mostly impressed with a trainee named Miguel, who checked us in and remembered our names throughout our stay.  He was only a young kid, but was so professional and pleasant!  Make him manager!!!",5,2019,08,15
203,Very good but not for everyone,"+++
The hotel is perfectly located in Dublin
The staff is very good and helpful
Excellent breakfast
Bed and bathroom are good

---
I find the rooms and the hotel in general a bit outdated, rooms could benefit from renovation
Internet didn't work on our floor; we informed the reception when we arrived, wasn't fixed by the time we left the next day. We got financial compensation, which was very nice, but we would have preferred wifi :-)

Overall I would say it's a very good hotel, a bit old fashion, but in my opinion it is overpriced; there are similar quality hotels, a bit further from the center that are a lot cheaper... I guess you've got to pay for the location.",4,2019,08,15
203,Another Great Stay,"This was the second time staying in Dublin and for the second time I picked The Westbury.  You can not find a nicer hotel with the location.  It's right in the middle of everything, which makes it so much easier walking the city.  It is a gorgeous hotel and has great little restaurants and bars within the hotel.  Will definitely be back soon.",5,2019,08,12
203,Special finale to a special trip,"From start to finish, the Westbury team did a wonderful job helping plan and deliver a special conclusion to our two-week family trip.  Everyone had a wonderful time, especially the kids.  I highly recommend booking the teepee if available and also letting the staff know about special occasions.  We were celebrating a birthday as well as just being in Ireland (reason enough to celebrate!) and the special welcome treats, wine, and personalization were an outstanding way to wrap up a fun vacation.  A special thanks to Marlyes on the reservations team; she was patient with a long list of requests (and too many questions along the way) and made it all happen flawlessly.  Such great service all around.  Highly recommend!",5,2019,08,11
203,"Afternoon tea, great service from Felicia ","Food was exceptional. Huge portions and a full hamper to take home. Lovely warm, friendly and attentive service from Felicia. 
Atmosphere is relaxed, deco interior design and jazz soundtrack.
We'll be back!",5,2019,08,11
203,Great hotel with a great location,"The Westbury was a great hotel with a great location.  After staying at some fabulous hotels during our 23 days in Europe, I gave this hotel 4 stars because it was just shy of being in the 5 star category.  I would definitely stay here again.",4,2019,08,11
203,"Of the charts, yet again!","Afternoon tea is always a treat and we love nothing more than coming back to the Westbury. By far, in my opinion the best afternoon tea Dublin has to offer. While the food and service are always flawless it‚Äôs the small thing like the team remembering you from your last visit and just engaging in general chit chat. We have been lucky enough to have afternoon tea with Felicia on more than one occasion and hands down she is 5 stars. She remembers us every visit and just makes the whole experience for us. An asset to the team. A job well done to everyone! If I could give 6 stars I would.",5,2019,08,09
203,Great location and service!,Right in the middle of where you want to be in Dublin. Nice rooms and great service as well. We didn't get to eat there as we were always out on the town. Some construction at the back entrance made it difficult but service was quickly there to help out. Would recommend for sure!,5,2019,08,09
203,First Class All the Way,"I have been to many five stars hotels where the staff are cloying and practiced at being nice to the clientele.  The staff at the Westbury are genuinely nice and really do enjoy their guests.  From the registration desk to the concierge to the wait staff, all are polished and happy.  We had a problem with lost luggage and the Concierges, Ashley and Lukas, were on the ball.  They called Aer Lingus and genuinely helped get the baggage of the depths of Dublin Airport to the hotel room.  This was not a simple lost luggage, this was a four day catastrophe of missing trains, cancelling future hotels, and extending a stay at this marvelous hotel.

The Side Car Lounge was the best.  The drink masters are fun, friendly and know their spirits.  Stefi and Adrian and the others were absolutely genius in the preparation of their elixirs and were lovely and welcoming with conversation and tips for Dublin touring.

Make this your only hotel in Dublin.  Irish laughter and five star treatment.  ",5,2019,08,08
203,Just shy of perfect,"This was our second stay at the Westbury and we had another great visit.  Perfect location, beautiful commun areas and great reception team, as one would expect from a hotel of that class and price range. We also appreciated our return being acknowledged at check in as well as by the general manager. Where this hotel falls a bit short are the guest rooms.  Very nice decor and perfectly comfortable and clean but the carpet, the mirrors and the bathroom (small) clearly date from a while back and are not on par with other properties of that caliber. The restaurant Wilde remains one of our favorite in Dublin.  We love the ambiance and the food, even though the service was a bit spotty at dinner and breakfast this time around.  Still, we would recommend and might very well be back on our next visit to Ireland!",4,2019,08,08
203,Afternoon Tea,"Had a fabulous afternoon tea with my Mother for her birthday this afternoon. 
Marta T, our server, was brilliant and incredibly attentive, making the whole experience so positive.  
She took care of us from the moment we sat down until the time we left.

Highly recommend!",5,2019,08,07
203,Pricey but good!,"Have just had my first trip to Dublin and couldn't have found a better place to stay. The customer service from all the staff was exemplary, the room comfortable and the public areas grand but welcoming. On top of that, an unbeatable location.

Difficult to tell if it's a Westbury thing or a Dublin thing but everyone was always smiling and helpful and went out of their way to ensure you were well looked after. I was checked in (and out) by Ashley who set the tone for my stay. She was personable, friendly and efficient and made me feel really welcome. 

The centre of the hotel is undoubtedly The Gallery, a large 'lounge' on the first floor that is everything you expect of a five-star hotel. Really comfortable sofas and chairs, glitzy lighting, helpful staff and a menu of light bites. A place that is comfortable to just sit, either in company or on your own. 

My room was on the fourth floor facing the front - you pay a premium for the view but it's worth it. Extremely comfortable bed, two easy chairs, a desk and chair, tv, a room safe (at eye level for a change), Nespresso machine and mini-bar. A brightly lit and modern bathroom. Minimal noise disturbance from other guests despite the heaviest hotel bedroom doors you've ever come across which were difficult to close quietly.

There was some slight noise one night from a nearby music bar but ear plugs blocked that out.

Breakfast is a real event, served in The Wilde Restaurant, where you are confronted by the enormous choice that lots of places offer these days. Except that the cooked part is done to order and of very high quality. As with everywhere else in the hotel, lots of staff on hand to look after you. 

As befits a hotel of this quality the concierge team was always extremely helpful.

Finally, a word about the location: it's just off Grafton Street, one of the main shopping streets in Dublin (and pedestrianised) and, as I found out, within walking distance of nearly all the main sights the city has to offer. 

A really lovely hotel that's worth saving up for!",5,2019,08,06
203,Yup,"Going to Dublin? If so, stay here for sure. Exit the front door- you're on Grafton St., the hub of the action of Dublin. Go out the rear door- you're in the midst of cool restaurants and pubs (like the Hairy Lemon). I'm sure glad I chose the Westbury over other hotels I was contemplating. Also, the bed was the most comfortable I've had in all my years of travel. Concierge service was thorough and knowledgeable. Room was kept immaculately, and bathroom products of the highest quality. Great choice when staying in Dublin.",5,2019,08,05
203,Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the experience,"We only stayed for one night on our way home from Canada. We were all very happy with the lovely welcome, a great room with welcome amenities. The dinner was well above our expectations in quality and service. This continued as the breakfast the next morning was lovely. Add this to a great location to see Dublin and we would definitely return again for a longer stay. The only downside was that despite air conditioning in the bedroom it was very hot in the night.",5,2019,08,04
203,Excellent service!,"The hotel deserves its 5 stars. The staff at this hotel is amazing.  Everyone is customer oriented and there to make your stay memorable. We initially had an issue our room. Inez the front desk manager and Jack the customer service manager took care of it and made it right. The breakfast is superb. The eggs are excellent and the salmon, fresh fruit and pastries are amazing.  We had a king deluxe room which was very spacious and comfortable.   One recommendation for the hotel is to update the bathroom vanity.  Also they should invest in better windows to soundproof the rooms. There are bars where you can hear them playing until 11 or 12 at night. You can also hear the trash trucks in the morning. Overall an excellent hotel. Location is very good, only minutes away by foot from everything. ",5,2019,08,03
203,Luxury respite in the heart of Dublin,The Westbury is an Oasis of comfort in the middle of the city. We enjoyed coming back to the tranquility of the hotel and staff after a busy day. You needn‚Äôt look for a better place to eat either. The room was spacious as well ,5,2019,08,01
203,Westbury,"The Westbury is in the heart of Dublin and in a great location.  You are paying for the location and the high end setting.  The rooms are SMALL but elegant.  We had some issues on arrival with adjoining rooms for our children, we did not get them.  Be careful what floor and room they put you in,  one floor looks onto the black tar rooftop- which is what we received, plus the fact that ours was near the elevator.  So we were very unsatisfied with the room cost/to view and placement.  We just were not thrilled with this hotel based on those issues.  The staff is great,  the location is great, the food is amazing.   It is very high-end and beautiful, just not the best family hotel.  This would be a great hotel for 5 Star couples!!  ",4,2019,07,31
203,"Great location, couple of problems","Had a couple of overnight stays. The rooms are large and clean. Great location, close to shopping strip. Couple of problems. On both occasions housekeeping knocked on the door early. Good luck getting a sleep in. Also the door cards stopped working. But worst...as part of a rail tour I received some chocolates shaped as a train. I had one of the pieces and went to dinner. Got back to find the turn down had removed the rest (the majority). Clearly had not finished with it. ",3,2019,07,30
203,Fair:,"Rooms: The hotel had great availability for rooms close to each other with before hand request. The rooms where gorgeous and spacious. The rooms decor was quite modern and was enjoyable to be in. 

Food: The breakfast buffet was exceptionally fair. Good food options, great pastries. I would expect that there lunch and dinner services are very very expensive. Not good for people who have paid for a large and expensive room and just was complimentary lunch and dinner. Some better hotels offer that, but this serperates this hotel from other hotels.

Staff: Was very quick and except-able services where offered there.

Problems: I already talked about the food but they also do not offer air conditioning. It becomes really hot at night and opening the windows does nothing.",3,2019,07,29
203,Westbury Hotel is A+,This hotel is right in the heart of downtown Dublin and is such a gem. The people working there are so kind and very helpful. They try to go above and beyond your expectations.  Rooms are gorgeous and  clean. I would stay there again in a heartbeat,5,2019,07,29
203,Perfect Location Plus All the Amenities.,"The Westbury enjoys a perfect location for sightseeing, shopping and entertaining friends and family. Breakfast is lovely. The pastry chef is superb. Afternoon tea was delightful. We had no complaints on the comfort of our room.",5,2019,07,29
203,Fabulous stay,"My daughters and I recently stayed at The Westbury and had a wonderful stay. The staff was professional, friendly and extremely helpful. Our room was luxurious and spacious; we also loved the amenities in the bathroom. We highly recommend the hotel and are looking forward to returning soon!!",5,2019,07,28
203,Great service and location,"This is a first class hotel in a great location.  Walking distance to the Temple Bar, Trinity College, the cathedral and shopping. The formal afternoon tea is a must do.  Rooms are a bit small, and its is possible to hear street noise late at night.",5,2019,07,28
203,Great hotel,"Great hotel in fabulous area of Dublin. Walking distance to shops, church, Starbucks and Trinity College. Good service. Restaurants pricey but there are many less expensive options in the neighborhood.",5,2019,07,28

203,Very Nice,"This hotel is very beautiful, and in an absolute prime location. We stayed 3 nights and enjoyed the turn down service as well as afternoon tea in the gallery. The only complaint we had was the AC really did not cool the room, and the room furnishings could use a refresher (Rips in furniture ect.) Also, we had a drink at the bar one night and the service was very slow. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay here.",4,2019,07,27
203,Great Hotel and Great Location!,We stayed at the Westbury for our first two nights in Ireland.  It was a great location to walk and see Dublin.  It was close to everything.  The staff offered exceptional service and we loved the made to order breakfast each morning.  They had great options and went out of their way to ensure you had everything you needed.  We also used the American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts and received an upgraded room and extra amenities.,5,2019,07,26
203,Over and Above at the Westbury!,"WOW, that's all I can say! From the room accommodations to the water pressure in the shower to the turndown service to the outstanding experiences in the hotel restaurants and bars, this establishment is doing everything right. I've never felt so valued at any hotel I've ever stayed at. The staff was incredibly helpful and attentive and the facilities were clean, fresh and comfortable. ",5,2019,07,25
203,Afternoon tea,"I had the most perfect vegan afternoon tea here this week. The food was incredible, the attention to detail was wonderful and the staff were truly amazing. They were so accommodating and welcoming. Highly recommend this as a midweek treat or special occasion.",5,2019,07,25
203,Exceptional Stay,"The Westbury Hotel is the best hotel in Dublin.  The staff go above and beyond to help and facilitate your needs.  They are all so polite, welcoming, helpful and friendly.

It was an absolute pleasure to deal with the staff in the Westbury Hotel and I look forward to dealing and staying at the Westbury Hotel very soon.",5,2019,07,24
203,Perfect stay at the Westbury! Highly recommended.,"This hotel was perfect and only added to our terrific stay in Dublin. Gorgeous room, wonderful staff, delicious breakfast, lovely lounge. The location is top notch...right next to Grafton Street, St. Stephens park, and a five to ten minute walk to most attractions.
We loved every minute and will definitely be back! Dublin is a lovely place made even more special by a stay at the Westbury! 
PS: The beds were so comfy we wanted to take one home with us!",5,2019,07,23

203,Amazing city centre hotel,"This hotel is just top class. We availed of the valet parking and it was definitely worth the extra few euro. We visited the cocktail bar and couldn‚Äôt fault the drinks, the atmosphere or the service. The room was a generous size for a city centre hotel and the reception staff were helpful and professional. But the best thing about this hotel is it‚Äôs location, it just couldn‚Äôt get any better. It‚Äôs right in the middle of the best part of Dublin City and surrounded by beautiful restaurants, bars and shops. I can‚Äôt wait to revisit again soon.",5,2019,07,20
203,excellent hotel in the middle of the city,the family wanted a short break. we agreed on Dublin. The Irish people are very hospitable and it was clear in the staff of the hotel.

203,Great location,"Fantastic location, very clean rooms, nice bathrooms.  Decor is a little unmemorable in rooms but great air conditioning and plush beds with robes, slippers...  Service was excellent.  Central to everything yet out of the Temple Bar area so we found bars and restaurants with more locals.  ",5,2019,07,13
203,Lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Just returned from a three night stay at the Westbury. The hotel is lovely, with top-notch staff and facilities. It's very convenient to all the sites in Dublin. We had a wonderful afternoon tea in the beautiful lobby and very good food (breakfast and dinner) at the Wilde restaurant. Our room was huge, with everything we needed, including a comfortable bed. Our favorite part of the hotel was the Sidecar Bar - Stephanie was our delightful bartender!",5,2019,07,12
203,Three days of heaven in THE WESTBURY DUBLIN,"We arrived on a Sunday and left the following Wednesday from beginning to end it was TOTALY fantastic. From our beautiful room to the staff not to mention the exceptional food our time in the Westbury was just amazing. Everyone was so friendly and helpful , great personalities with all the staff who had all the time in the world to help out or just have a chat.

203,Afternoon Tea,"Gorgeous hotel with a lovely area for having afternoon tea. Celebrating a friend‚Äôs 50th enjoying delicious sandwiches, scones and patisseries. Lovely atmosphere and friendly and helpful staff. Pre booking direct with the hotel was quick and easy. ",5,2019,07,12
203,Great Dublin Hotel,"Great location, great staff, great food, nice cocktail (gin) bar. I had a little trouble operating the in room coffee machine, and they did not have USB ports to hook up to charge our phones and there weren't a lot of plugs, but overall a great place to stay w/ easy access to everything.",5,2019,07,11
203,Perfect afternoon tea,"While stopping in Dublin, I went to the Westbury for afternoon tea. It was such a lovely experience and the food/tea were delicious! Marta T was incredibly kind and attentive. It was a great place to relax and unwind after a busy few days",5,2019,07,11
203,"Excellent customer service,lovely hotel","Stayed at hotel for three nights as part of a tour. The hotel is very nice. Rooms are spacious. Closets for hanging clothes, shelves to use for items. Bathrooms have a shower/bathtub. Breakfast is great with continental choices as well as menu. The outstanding feature though is the extraordinary customer service whether in the hall, housekeeping,front desk,dining area.",5,2019,07,09
203,amazing hotel!,"Everything was so amazing at this hotel- the room, the restaurants, the staff, the location!  We will definitely be back! We stayed for four days (after being in London as well), and could not have picked a better place to stay.",5,2019,07,09
203,"Nice, expensive hotel","We stayed at the Westbury for 1 night in July just before we flew home out of Dublin airport. The hotel is smack in the middle of most of Dublin's major sights, which are within easy walking distance. The place is stylishly decorated and luxurious, though the room rate is steep and neither breakfast nor parking are included in the price. The air conditioning system in our room did not work, and so the room was extremely stuffy the night of our stay. We were not offered any compensation for the inconvenience (i.e. breakfast on the house or waived parking fee), which was disappointing.  Overall I think this is a very nice hotel, though not really worth the price.",4,2019,07,09
203,Disappointed,"We wanted to end our CIE Tour with a luxury experience.  It cost $500 per night.  I booked 2 nights.  After one week in many hotels across Ireland, all excellent with internet/ phones and more, for the first time arriving in The Westbury, we had no phone working and no internet!  
We were trying to coordinate with another party staying at The Westbury in another room on another floor and had no way.  I had to go down to the reception twice and finally became irrate because we could have been exploring Dublin but instead are waiting in our room for internet to be hooked up and our phone fixed!!!  It was a seeming lack of any attention.  When I threatened to do a review on Tripadvisor,  only then they came to action.  
On the positive note, the beds are very comfortable and the location cannot be beat.
I received notes apologizing and a call the following day to make sure we had internet and phone service.  They had to put a new router in our room.  
It was very shocking at the ineptness and came so far below my expectations, esp for the price we were paying!!!  If they had offered a discount I might have restrained or at least could say they came up to their reputation,  but for that money, it is a joke.  There are so many great places to stay in Dublin.  We have stayed in the Merrion before and that will be our choice next time.  It was excellent but we wanted to explore a new place.  I regret that we did not stay at the Merrion this trip.  Avoid The Westbury if you don't want to be disappointed.",1,2019,07,08
203,Fantastic!,"This hotel was beautiful, rooms were immaculate and the staff was very accommodating and the service was excellent. Location was perfect with great pubs and shopping right out the front door in the nicest neighborhood in Dublin. Great classy hotel lobby to sit and have a drink in late into the night.. overall a wonderful experience.",5,2019,07,07
203,Not a good hotel,"Room not ready although check in time was on confirmation.
We had a Junior suite booked. this was in a dark corner at rear of hotel no view and opposite the elevator.
Very small bathroom with over bath shower. Only.
",1,2019,07,07
203,Beautiful Hotel in the heart of Dublin,"The Westbury is a beautiful luxurious hotel in a perfect location. Steps from the hotel is the best shopping, dining, pubs and parks in Dublin. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with great amenities. ",5,2019,07,06
203,Awesome Hotel,This Hotel is wonderful. Great service and nice accommodations. This hotel is located right in the center of Grafton street with a ton of pubs and entertainment. Beds are super comfortable. Hi tea time is a really neat experience and the service is incredible. ,5,2019,07,06
203,GBP 500 a night for this....,"Hugely expensive for a room with a view over kitchen exhaust fans, broken a/c, telephone that didn‚Äôt work, no TV controls and badly scratched furniture and soiled upholstery on chairs! Nowhere good enough for this price. So disappointing Westbury!",1,2019,07,06
203,Westbury Hotel Dublin,"Beautiful hotel in Dublin. It was my  first visit to Ireland, and  enjoyed it very much. Everything  was wonderful,  the comfort, the  courtesy, and the location.

203,Beautiful Hotel and Great Service,"My family and l spent a couple of days at The Westbury and it has been great!

The hotel is very elegant and perfectly located in the hart of Dublin. We particularly loved the flower composition in the restaurant.

As it was our first time in town, the concierge gave us tips on where to go and what to do, l must say, each team member on every department was always very welcoming and ready to help.

Breakfast and dinner in the main restaurant was great, the best Egg Royall ever! 

A special thank you to Lukas and Matheus for helping with parking, languages and forever having a smile and cheerful demeanour. It really goes along way. 

Thank you for all.

Cristina, Ugo and little Elijah.

203,Delightful stay in Dublin,"My granddaughter and I stayed at the Westbury for two nights and enjoy every minute.  We were given detailed directions to various venues and the attention of staff in all areas was superb.  From the front desk to the Concierge to  the folks who cleaned our room, we were greeted like family and made to feel comfortable at all times.  My only complaint while in Dublin? Driving on the left side of the road and those darling narrow streets! But the hotel was terrific!",5,2019,07,03
203,Very helpful staff,"My wife and I stayed here for two nights pre-cruise. The room was small but the bed was very comfortable. We both got good night sleeps after days of doing lots of walking. Water pressure in the shower was excellent, my only negative comment on the shower /tub was that the sides are very high and it made exiting a bit tricky. Location is excellent, right off of Grafton Street. We were able to walk to Trinity College, Christchurch, St Patrick's Cathedral and O'Connell Street.
the people working the front desk and concierge desk were friendly and extremely helpful. They took the time to mark a map of Dublin for us so we could find all the places we wanted to visit. The young woman at the concierge desk made several suggestions for pubs and restaurants.",5,2019,07,02
203,"Great location, excellent service","My friend and I spent 3 nights at the Westbury before boarding a cruise out of Dublin.  The hotel is in an excellent location for walking about the City.  It is very close to Trinity College, St. Stephen‚Äôs Park and the Tara Train Station if you want to venture out of the City.

The rooms are very clean and pretty. Every staff member from the greeting at the front desk to housekeeping is friendly and helpful.  

We had breakfast included.  They offered a full menu.  The food was excellent.",5,2019,07,02
203,The Westbury,Location is tremendous. We can not say enough about the quality of the staff and the comfort of the hotel. Every aspect of The Westbury exceeded our expectations. Room was up to date as was the bathroom. Towels are luxurious as are the bed sheets.,5,2019,07,01
203,Back at The Westbury,"We have stayed at The Westbury multiple times. It is an elegant hotel and is located right in the middle of the city. The morning breakfast is the best I have ever had. Employees are outstanding, particularly the staff at the front door. I must add that the rooms in the hotel are due for updating as they are looking and feeling ""old"". ",4,2019,07,01
203,Birthday celebrations,"I cannot say enough about the great weekend my family and I experienced at The Westbury.It was my birthday and we had a party with family and friends. We experienced exceptional service and friendliness.I would return in a flash and recommend this hotel to everyone.This was Irish hospitality at its best.Food drink service all excellent.
Thank you for a wonderful memory",5,2019,07,01
203,Afternoon tea at The Gallery,"Fantastic afternoon tea with family from across the world.  Celebrating a big family birthday.  Relaxed with lovely food and drink, Thanks to Marta T. And her colleagues for looking after us. Great setting.",5,2019,06,30
203,Outstanding !,"Elegant and classy hotel with excellent service from the moment you arrive. The bellboy was super helpful, checking in was smooth, spotless housekeeping, great concierge but best of all a manager that is on top of everything. We had an issue with the ac and Jack the manager went above and beyond to make sure that we were happy. 
The food and service at both restaurants was superb!
To top it all, the hotel is situated in the heart of the city within walking distance of many must go spots, restaurants and shopping.
Highly recommended!",5,2019,06,26
203,Fantastic Cocktail Experience,"My sister and I are cocktail enthusiasts who went to the Westbury to try the bar‚Äôs cocktails per the recommendation of a friend. It was a very classy environment with cocktails that did not disappoint. 

Our bartender Stefi made us her signature cocktail ‚ÄúThe Fletcher‚Äù which was easily the best cocktail both of us have ever had. 

Her knowledge of drinks, sense of humor, and professionalism were very impressive. Even if one is not staying at the Westbury, the bar is a destination in itself for a high-quality cocktail experience. ",5,2019,06,26
203,"Friendly, professional and a fantastic stay!","This is my first stay at the Westbury hotel and I have to say the professional standard here is exceptional and staff do a wonderful Job also a shout out to an Isabela at reception who made us feel very welcone. What really sets off this place is the location, it is in the heart of Dublin and everything is within close quarters and there's no shortage of places to have a quiet beverage with 2 bars just outside it's doorstep and there's plenty  of places to go if you fancy a shopping spree. The only draw back was that the room itself felt a little stuffy even with the window open however I did slept soundly and woke to a delicious breakfast. I hope to return again in the nearer future and perhaps stay for longer next time round. Thank you again",5,2019,06,25
203,Wonderful service,"My group and I had a wonderful visit to this beautiful hotel. Our waitress Erica was top class helping us choose the nicest desserts on the menu. She really knows her stuff.
Thanks for a lovely visit. We'll be back.",5,2019,06,25
203,Afternoon Tea at The Gallery,The afternoon tea experience is fantastic. Our server/host Ecaterina was perfect. The selection of tea varies and you have the option to try multiple pots of tea. I was able to substitute some of the finger sandwich options with ones on the kids menu. Plus you have the option to order seconds if you are still hungry. I highly recommend making reservations.,5,2019,06,24
203,Nice hotel in a great location,"The staff at the Westbury were helpful, friendly and knowledgable.  Our only complaint about the staff is that it took housekeeping two calls on two separate occasions to get them to bring requested items.  On the second call they were very quick to bring the items we needed.  The rooms were clean, the beds comfortable and fairly quiet at night although not particularly large.  The rooms were not as luxurious as  I would have expected for the price. ",5,2019,06,24
203,"Very comfortable, centrally located hotel with excellent service","My wife & I spent a couple nights at the Westbury in early June. This is a very well kept upper end hotel with outstanding service. The room was exceptionally clean & quite comfortable. The staff was very good. We set up a wheel chair rental with a local supplier & the hotel stored it until our arrival, brought it up to our room & assisted with unboxing, set-up & reboxing when our visit was over. The doormen were also extremely helpful. The location was our primary reason for selecting the Westbury, but the helpfulness of the staff was the strength of this establishment.",5,2019,06,23
203,"Lovely hotel, perfect location","This was the perfect hotel for our stay. Walkable to all the major sites, quiet, comfortable, excellent food and service. Staff very helpful. Would definitely stay here again if we return to Dublin.  A real treat. ",5,2019,06,22
203,Simply Elegant...,"I was in the UK for business and decided to extend my trip and take a solo trip to Ireland, since I had never been. I chose the Westbury on the recommendation of a colleague and LOVED it! It's pricey, but it's worth every single penny. The hotel is centrally located and the area is very walkable. Tons of restaurants, bars, shops, flower markets and of course, sightseeing. 

Check-in was smooth and I was immediately relieved of my luggage by the bell hop and given a hot towel and water upon arrival, which was refreshing after a long flight. Staff were very warm and welcoming. 

I would describe this hotel as classic, with simple and refined elegance. Everything from the classy lounge, soft music, gorgeous fresh flower arrangements, and soothing color schemes of the decor was simply perfect. 

The rooms are small for U.S. standards, but having traveled all over Europe, I am used to that. The room was well-appointed and comfortable. My room was facing Grafton street, but it was well insulated from any outside noise. My king bed had fluffy and comfortable bedding that felt so good to sink into after a whole day's worth of walking around sight-seeing. The bathroom is a bit dated, but the toiletries, shower pressure, and lighting were good and it was very clean. Turn-down service was lovely as well. 

I did do some day trips to go sight-seeing that left very early in the morning and well before the hotel restaurants opened and the front desk staff were wonderful with packing coffee and breakfast to go for me. 

I did treat myself to their lovely afternoon tea and thoroughly enjoyed the extensive tea selection, sandwiches, and pastries. The scones with clotted cream are just divine! I also did get drinks at the lounge and the servers were simply fantastic and great conversationalists, educating me on all things Ireland. 

This hotel is absolutely charming!",5,2019,06,20
203,The Westbury is a MUST,"My Girlfriend and I had stayed here for a weekend in Dublin. The location was absolutely fantastic. Extremely easy to walk to all the must see attractions... and the pubs. I have stayed in a lot of hotels but the Westbury went above and beyond to make you feel right at home. Starting from the doormen, to the check in desk, to check out, everything was phenomenal. I would rate this place a 5/5 and recommend to any friend. When you go you have to talk to Kevin the Doorman... he can brighten anyones day! ",5,2019,06,19
203,another great stay,"just spent 2 nights at the Westbury with my parents.  both rooms, although on the small side, were well appointed.  Really enjoy staying here, the staff are very attentive, the service is impeccable and the location, impossible to beat.  will definitely come back.  Again.  ",5,2019,06,19
203,Perfectly located with fantastic service and great breakfast,"A beautiful hotel well located in the heart of the city. A lovely welcome from the front desk, very experienced concierge, maitre d's and a special welcome team.  Wonderful cocktails at the stylish Sidecar Bar.  Large lobby that serves delicious scones and croissants in the morning and a classic English tea with all of the fixings in the afternoon.   Fantastic fresh breakfast each morning ‚Äì selection of fresh fruit, scones with clotted cream, delicious porridge and omelets, tasty Irish cheeses, fresh OJ and grapefruit juices. Large rooms with comfortable beds.",5,2019,06,18
203,Fanstastic Hotel,"We Went to the westbury for drinks with a group of 20 people - from the time we arrived we were greated with a very warm welcome by the concierge Kevin at the door who couldn't have been more professional and chaparoned us up to the side car bar. We were also greeted by Joseph in Guest relations who ensured we got to our appointed table and didn't want for anything.

The sidecar was busy but the staff were very attentative and the atmosphere was great - buzzing with people all having a good time. The extensive drinks list was very impressive and the Drumshambo G&T is highly recommended served in all its pomp and glory!

I can't recommend this place enough - a 5 star hotel with amazing attentative staff and we felt like VIP's from the moment we were greeted by Kevin at the door until we left several hours later - an abolsute must fro anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2019,06,17
203,Great Experience,"The staff was amazing and extremely accommodating to us during our stay. Everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful, we felt at times they went out of their to ensure all our needs were met. No easy feat with such a large party traveling together.",5,2019,06,17
203,Impeccable service,"My boyfriend and I attended afternoon tea on 15/06 and it was an absolutely wonderful experience. Every staff member we interacted with were more than pleasant and went above and beyond to create the highest standard of service. We chose the champagne afternoon and it was just incredible, delicious champagne, a vast selection of delicious sandwiches and pastries. Our waiter, Vadim was purely excellent and extremely pleasant to interact with. The beautiful surroundings only made our time there even more enjoyable. Will most certainly be back.",5,2019,06,16
203,Wonderful Hotel!,"Great location, beautiful hotel and the staff are wonderful! The room was comfortable and quiet. Would recommend this property to anyone wanting a centrally located hotel in Dublin - easy walk to most sites and restaurants. ",5,2019,06,15
203,Beautiful hotel but be mindful of what they advertise as accomodations,"I travel regularly to Europe and pay close attention to bed sizes.  This hotel offers double Queen rooms, this is what I rented and theses not what I got.  I got a room with 2 double beds and my wife had to sleep with our daughter given the size of the beds.  The hotel did nothing to accommodate this issue in any way except to offer to put a 3rd bed in the room. ",1,2019,06,14
203,Won‚Äôt disappoint ,First time in Dublin so we wanted to stay in a place close to attractions shopping and dining The Westbury is very well located and the hotel was top notch The level of service is apparent as soon as you walk in the door We felt like regulars immediately the rooms were good size and the restaurants and lounge were very good ,5,2019,06,13
203,"Great establishment, great service!!","This is a great hotel in a great location right off Grafton Street. 
We went to the sidecar bar for a few drinks and the service was fantastic. The bar staff Radoslav and Adrian were very friendly, super knowledgeable and even gave us some great info on what to do around the city. 
Cheers boys!",5,2019,06,13
203,Fabulous Spot,"Great place for a glass of wine just off Grafton St. Really comfortable, relaxing spot with nice atmosphere. 

Our server, Fernanda, was helpful with recommendations and the right level of attentive. Nice wine and G&T selection. ",5,2019,06,12
203,Perfect location!,"Just off Grafton Street in the heart of Dublin.  It was so easy to walk to most everything that we wanted to see.  Even though the pubs outside were open late, our room was quiet with very comfortable beds.  Breakfast was included with our rooms, and it was a lovely experience each morning.  I think that our group was in every bar and restaurant in the place, and we give them all high marks.  I also found the staff to be very warm and welcoming.  They went out of their way to help with every request.",5,2019,06,10
203,Not what really expected for a luxury hotel!,"Location is perfect!  Is in the heart of Dublin and everything is walking distance.
Service is quite slow and poor specially at breakfast and in Bafes bar. Breakfast is fine not to many options but pretty complete, but again you could wait 20 minutes for coffee or other 25‚Äô if you need your plate removed from the table.
Sidecar service is quite better but not amazing.
 Even I had a Superior Deluxe room, was basic, spacious, but very basic decorated and with a terrible noise every 20‚Äô and never knew if was from outside or from heater. 
TV options are terrible!!!!
But location is GREAT!!!",3,2019,06,09
203,Nice hotel - Horrible Bathrooms and Reception,"Very disappointed in many ways with this hotel. For the price they demand, they need to step up their game. To start with they have a strange side entrance that they require taxis to drop guests.  Not bad except that when we arrived on a Friday at 3pm there are no bell hops and I had to drag my suitcases up three steps and down a long hall to get to a point where I could use an elevator. When I complained at the check in desk, they tried to make amends by buying us a drink. A nice gesture. They explained that there are normally always people posted at that entrance. I accepted this explanation until upon check out there was nobody around to help me down the 3 stairs. Why can't they use the front entrance? The other problem was the lighting in the bathrooms. I understand LED bulbs are the way to go, but it was so dark and under lit my wife could not even apply makeup. Additionally for a hotel in this class, they should have a lit make-up mirror in the bathroom but did not. With so many choices in Dublin next time I am spending the money the Westbury demands, I will take my business elsewhere.",4,2019,06,09
203,fabulous hotel and location,"Off busy Grafton street but somehow managing to keep a peaceful setting. Elegant and welcoming, with very friendly and helpful staff everywhere you go.Rooms are spacious and quite( we had a deluxe studio) and staff is very attentive and dedicated to customer satisfaction.Due to its central location everything of interest is pretty much within walking distance.",5,2019,06,09
203,Great location and friendly staff,Ideally placed central location for all bars and shops. The hotel given its 5 star rating requires some modernisation of the rooms to keep up with the other hotels in the area with a 5 star rating. Leisure facilities would also be a good advantage. ,4,2019,06,09
203,Like going back into another world,"It truly was a 5 star luxurious experience and so central to everything. Everybody was very friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for you. However,  just one observation would be that maybe the people at the reception desk could be a little bit more knowledgeable. However, the concierge did help out with this. We had an amazing time here and have no qualms in recommending it to you. Come and see for yourself.",5,2019,06,09
203,Delightful afternoon tea,"Myself and my family visited the westbury today for afternoon tea, food was delicious and service by Vadim could not have been any better. Lots to choose from in a gorgeous setting. Can't wait to return! ",5,2019,06,08
203,Birthday drink,"Visited the Westbury upstairs lounge for a birthday drink with some family members. Having been there once before, I remembered it as spacious, relaxing and 'so civilised'! 
We were served by a lovely young waitress, Patricia, who on hearing that it was my husband's birthday, arrived back, after serving our drinks, with a delicious dessert and 'Happy Birthday' written on the plate.
Dishes of nuts had already been served with our drinks and as we were going on elsewhere for dinner, we didn't want to spoil our dinner, but how could one resist!
It was such a relaxing, pleasurable hour.
The Westbury lounge is a haven in the centre of a busy city and the lovely Patricia made our visit all the more special. We'll definitely be back :)",5,2019,06,05
203,Peace and tranquility in the heart of Dublin,"Pulling up outside The Westbury hotel and handing the car keys over for the valet parking service, we entered The Doyle Collection‚Äôs flagship hotel. Met with the gentle aroma of select botanicals in the air immediately put us at ease after a busy day exploring Dublin as we made our way to reception. The stunning interior design was immediately apparent, with original pieces of art from the family‚Äôs collection adorning the walls, fresh flowers and select pieces of furniture. 
This family owned hotel is just a stone‚Äôs throw from Grafton Street, offering an oasis of calm and serenity in the heart of Dublin.

We were promptly checked in and made our way to the fifth floor where we had been given a Luxury King Suite. The beautifully appointed room continued the luxurious theme with large windows offering views over the rooftops of Dubln and comprising a seating area with fresh flowers; sleeping space, open to a claw-foot bath area and separate bathroom.  

After taking a moment to relax we made our way to The Sidecar cocktail bar. This Art Deco space, which looks like a scene from The Great Gatsby is simply sublime. We ordered a couple of cocktails to be prepared by The Westbury‚Äôs award-winning mixologists and soaked up the wonderful atmosphere before heading into Wilde for dinner. 

Wilde restaurant continues the 1930s feel, with a Parisian twist, decorated with black and white mosaic floor tiles, rattan furniture accessorised with green soft furnishings and an abundance of greenery. In the good weather the large windows can all be opened to give guests the feel of alfresco dining. The food in Wilde was to die for. Beautifully presented with exceptional flavours, an extensive wine list and excellent service, this restaurant is first-class.

Suitably filled we savoured a final digestif in the serene surrounds of The Gallery before retiring for the evening. 

The next morning, after a restful night‚Äôs sleep we made our way to Balfes for breakfast. This all-day bistro offers indoor/outdoor dining and has the feel of an on-trend New York eatery. 

Our stay at The Westbury was flawless from the second we walked through the doors. From the knowledgeable, attentive staff to the d√©cor, it truly was an exceptional break and we checked out with a plan to return as soon as justifiably possible!",5,2019,06,05
203,The Westbury is an outstanding hotel,"We had the opportunity to stay in 525. It was a spacious suite with an abundance of natural light.  The king poster bed was plush and extremely comfortable for sleeping.  However, the best part of the Westbury is the staff.  Upon arriving from our overseas flight we were greeted by name by Evan on of the guest services staff. Check in was easy. Our room was ready. When we got upstairs there was a full lunch spread including small sandwiches, deserts and a bottle of wine. How cool is that? Latter on Evan offered to buy us a drink at the hotel lounge.  Which by the way serves the best small batch gin drinks.  After drinks he offered to buy our dinner at the upscale hotel restaurant.  Needless to say we have never been treated any better.  We recommend this hotel without reservation to anyone visiting Dublin. It is right in the middle of everything.  An easy walk to stores, restaurants, Trinity College and the museums.",5,2019,06,04
203,Dublin city centre stay,"Couple stay for 1 night. Unbeatable location. Nice welcome from valet service, reception and guest services. Lovely drinks in bar were complimentary as our room was not quite ready on arrival. Room service failed to show with ice as requested after 2 phone calls which was disappointing. Hoping breakfast makes up for this in morning. Overall plan to book again on next trip to Dublin.",4,2019,06,04
203,Lovely hotel in a great location,The hotel was lovely.  The decor and service were terrific.  The front desk and concierge were most helpful.   The breakfast was excellent and the dining room like a garden.

203,Top notch -deserving of all 5 stars,"One can't do better in Dublin than the Westbury!  Centrally located and beautiful. Immaculate rooms and public spaces.  The front desk and doormen are the first contact with a wonderful staff.  Enid, at the front desk was so helpful getting our room switched from king to twin when a relative was unexpectedly able to meet up with us in Dublin. I wish I noted all the room service folk's name-one never waits more than a very few minutes for any request including just a bucket of ice.  
If you are interested in a work out-which my son and I were-guests have access to a terrific gym across the street. 
The breakfast was FANTASTIC!  All the wait staff was gracious and quick.
We had drinks at the Sidecar.  My son and his cousin are whiskey aficionados and Stephanie was a remarkable font of information-aside from being very charming,funny and a rugby player (like myself) Her co worker Oisin was also on the spot!
Westbury-you are doing it right. Can't wait to come back to Dublin and stay.",5,2019,05,31

We arrived at 10:00 am and were delighted to be able to check into our room at that time.  We had a basic classic room, still expensive at about $1100 for two nights.  The room was nice enough, bathroom was tiny. The hotel itself is beautiful and the location is perfect.  Staff very attentive. ",5,2019,05,30

203,Pricey but worth it,"Stayed at the Westbury for 3 nights last week.  It was .org of our tour package and cost-wise out of our usual price range, but we‚Äôd loved every minute of it.  Location is excellent, felt quite safe free drive walking round the area.  The room was very comfortable with great amenities including bathrobes, iron and board, and a safe.  There was a mini bar but we were afraid to put our own stuff in as we weren‚Äôt sure we wouldn‚Äôt incur an expense if we‚Äôd took something out to make room.

203,Best Hotel Ever,"From the moment we booked the hotel online to the moment we left, the Westbury exceeded our expectations. We stayed in Dublin for 7 days and chose the Westbury for it's premium location in City Center. This was the best choice we made. We chose their transport service to and from the airport. We immediately received emails inquiring about our flight number, etc. so that they could pick us up promptly. We arrived before check-in time but the staff at the Westbury gave us a room upon arrival with no waiting. This was excellent as we were quite weary from the trip. Our beds were exceptional. The mattresses, pillows and comforters were all premium quality and one of the best mattresses I have ever slept in at a hotel. The entire staff was friendly, efficient and accommodating. Thomas, the concierge, was most knowledgeable and helpful. We received breakfast every morning during our stay which was included in our package. The choices were excellent and delicious. The hotel was very clean. The rooms were very quiet and we had no issues with any noise. The Westbury may be one of the more pricey hotels in Dublin, but as they say ""you get what you pay for"". We would definitely stay here again. This was an excellent choice. ",5,2019,05,20
203,Over the top,Very welcoming staff.  Extremely comfortable bed.  Excellent location for getting to Grafton Street and access to bus tours.

203,"Wonderful experience, family friendly Hotel.","My first ever trip advisor review... 
We recently stayed at The Westbury Hotel in Dublin for 6 nights (my partner and two children - 8 weeks and 3 years). From the moment we arrived at the reception desk the staff could not do enough for us. The warm Irish welcome to two very tired parents at midday was greatly received after an early start with two young children. When we got to our room there was two teddy bears waiting for the kids. A cot was already set up at the end of the bed for our youngest and the bed for our 3 yr old and been prepared with safety rails so he didn‚Äôt fall out. That in itself gave us peace of mind from the get go. 
Room service provided excellent choices for our toddler. The fantastic breakfast every morning almost filled us for the entire day . All the staff from doormen, concierge and wait staff could not be more helpful... the sight of two small kids in our party never put them off serving or accommodating us. They moved furniture to make room for a stroller, brought cushions to prop up the toddler... making our comfort their priority. I sent dirty bottles to housekeeping which came back clean and sterilised. All in all there was nothing they couldn‚Äôt do to help.
We ate in Balfe‚Äôs the day we arrived while waiting for our room to be ready (we arrived at 12.30). We both had delicious salads, generous portions. We never ate in Wilde. 
We stayed in the Westbury because it offered a very competitive rate and because of the location which is second to none, right in the heart of the city within walking distance of every must see attraction and literally on grafton street (and a short walk from the playground at Stephens Green). The other guests staying at the hotel were warm and friendly, mainly Americans we met when we stayed.
If you are looking for a recommendation of a hotel to stay in Dublin and have a decent budget then look no further!",5,2019,05,16
203,Book the Westbury - You will love it too!,"We loved the Westbury Hotel!  We stayed 5 days in April and would definitely stay again.  The staff are the best... friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and professional.  The room was spacious and nicely decorated as was the bathroom.  Housekeeping was efficient. Lovely towels and linens.  Breakfast was top notch with loads of fresh & delish choices and we enjoyed several visits to the SideCar bar.  The hotel is very conveniently located but there's always a cab available for trips too far to walk.  

PS:  Just one issue.  Ireland does not allow hairdryer outlets in the bathrooms.  We were not aware.  Although they supplied a terrific hairdryer there was no electrical outlet by a mirror.  Every other hotel we visited on our 3 week trip had electrical outlets by mirrors... (even the centuries old castles).  I don't know if this was a problem with our particular room, or throughout the hotel.  It definitely should be addressed.  I had to dry my hair with the benefit of a reflection from a black tv screen. :-(

Still---> Five stars for this hotel!",5,2019,05,15

203,Lovely hotel close to everything but our bathroom smelt of drains!,"We arrived at 11am from the airport but our room was not yet ready. reception said we will call you within in the 30-45 min, so I left my mobile did the call come no after 1 hour and 15min I called and was told your room is ready! 10 min after me calling a message to my phone arrived!

When you are paying for a top room at ¬£400.00 a night smell of drains! wow I wanted to complain but my wife said leave it if only she realised how much a night was! may Inc Breakfast but come on!

You sent me a questioner by e mail I filled it in did you reply no!

Nice room with a large screen and mini bar nice double bed plus every night they lay a sweet on your bed nice touch.

Our cleaner was top 10/10

Was it clean our room 10/10?

Location 10/10

But there is a problem with the reception Evon you got to learn more every time we asked her, she was not sure had to ask!  0/10

You are working in a top hotel.

Also, on day 3 the waitress that greeted us for breakfast wow what a false smile! bad 0/10 please don't make it noticeable if you don't want to work their leave!

This hotel would have got 5 stars if it was not for the room that had this drain smell.

Also, I agree with the other comment having a shower very dangerous to get out one wrong move! 5/10

Security in the hotel 10/10

Bar area and young waiter 10/10

Little noise after 11pm-4am as when you let the door goes it bangs!

Service was 10/10

Free news paper also did not arrive first thing! had to ask!

Breakfast cakes had a fly seating on them 0/10 should not happen.

The day before we were going home I said could I have a private Taxi to take us back to the Airport must not be a small van type taxi must be a saloon as I get ill in them if not a saloon she said not a problem we will make sure and you will be picked up at the back of the hotel guess what front hotel! and small van taxi arrived!  what is wrong with the front reception! I think you need training urgently!

If it was raining on the way out of the hotel they would lend you a umbrella and on your return they would give you a dry one 10/10 plus any help from the men by the side of the reception area nothing they did not know 10/10  Reception staff should learn from them!

If you can fix these items, you will have a perfect 10/10 overall.",4,2019,05,13

Calm, efficient and knowledgeable service, a little 'old-world' but comfortable and very welcoming. We arrived just after 5am from New York pleasantly surprised to find our room ready.

The room was very spacious, beds very comfortable and a luxury to settle the jet lag.
Concierge staff were particularly knowledgeable and proud of their city. We found their information and advice accurate and right for our needs.

We did not eat at either of the hotel restaurants preferring to  explore outside the hotel. As 2 Australians from Perth, we found the restaurant prices high, but Dublin is an expensive city by any standard.",4,2019,04,28

203,Great Hotel in Dublin.,"Stayed here with my wife on the run up to Christmas. Fantastic hotel. 

I have stayed in Shelbourne, Merrion, Marker and many others and I would have this at top of list with the Merrion for Dublin City's best.

Location is amazing, the lounge at night time is superb for just relaxing and listening to the piano.

Just off Grafton Street is perfect for eating out, shopping and seeing the landmarks.

Small mark reduction for small rooms and less than I would expect at this level for pool and spa. Overall though very very good experience.",5,2019,04,27
203,The good and the not so good!,"We stayed here for 9 days in a large suite that was close to $1,000 US per day and were anticipating a room and service of a certain caliber.  First the good...the staff in the hotel with the exception of the restaurant were first rate.  All of the guest relations and concierge staff were most helpful as were all my prebooking communications. I agree with another reviewer that if the concierge is not there the front desk staff don't know anything about the area but in fairness that's not their job.  
The location is very convenient and  walking distance to almost anywhere.  Shops, restaurants, sightseeing are all in easy reach.
Now for the not so good...the room was extremely tired and badly in need of renovation.  No drawer space for clothing. One closet couldn't open fully as it was blocked by a nightable.  The lowest and most uncomfortable couch I have ever sat on.  Finally the bath, one sink with chips, the tiniest corner shower also with numerous chips in the fiberglass base, and a wooden stand alone rack for the towels.  I must add that the room was extremely clean and the housekeeping was perfect as were the amenities.  
All and all we enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel making sure to request a renovated room.

203,Business Meeting,"We recently hosted a business meeting in the Westbury Hotel in the Kildare Suite for about 20 people.  It is a very central locations with excellent access from the nearby LUAS Green Line.  The hospitable and luxurious lounge area is immediately beside the conference centre and ideal for those who arrive early and desire refreshments.

I dread arriving early in the morning to a conference centre to get setup for the day to find that it is deserted and there is no support available to sort out last minute niggles.  Not so in the Westbury.  There were a number of staff available and all very willing to support in any way they could.  We needed extra chairs which we delivered immediately and I requested a coffee and scones to keep us going which arrived promptly.

However all was not perfect.  The Wicklow suite has a very basic projector (descends from the ceiling so it can‚Äôt be readily changed) and the smallest screen I‚Äôve come across in years.  As a result the images projected are pixelated and dull with detail unreadable.  I checked the other rooms and they all have up to date large screen TVs which you would expect in a venue of this calibre.  So, Come On, Westbury - update the Wicklow Suite.

Throughout the morning we were there the staff were most attentive, alway smiling and willing to help.   They are a credit the the Westbury Hotel.

We‚Äôll be back (but not to the Wicklow Suite, unless it‚Äôs been updated).",4,2019,04,24
203,Bad from top to bottom,"Upon check in we were first taken to a room that hadn't been updated in at least 20 years, that faced the roof tops `and back areas of adjoining properties--and not in a quaint way, and where you literally couldn't open the bathroom door because it hit the toilet. All for ‚Ç¨350. Needless to say we asked to be moved, upon which we got a lot of moaning about how full the hotel was and so we were put in a handicap accessible room, which wasn't a bad option, and we were told that though it was ‚Ç¨150, we wouldn't be charged extra. Seems this was another room that no-one had stayed in for a decade as the bathroom light didn't switch off and despite a technician affirming there was a problem, and our request that it be fixed when we went out to dinner, we came back and...you got it-- The light was still on, no-one had bothered to leave us a message that it couldn't be fixed, nor left word about the need to change rooms...again. Two phone calls later, they put us in a lovely, newly upgraded room, 2 doors away! We found the staff at the hotel to be genuinely bad. The person who originally checked us in didn't mention anything about bkfst location or time, or that it came with our room. She didn't know anything about a fabulous museum, The `little Museum, which is practically around the corner and tells the story of the city. At bkfst the first day, they had so many people, they couldn't accommodate everyone, and one of the guest relations people recommended incredibly mediocre food for dinner the second night. All in all, there have to be better options in this lovely city with so much to offer. `other than it's great location, `I can't understand why anyone raves about it.",1,2019,04,24
203,Wilde is terrific any time of day,"Dinner at Wilde on our last night in Ireland was extraordinary. Delectable choices, nice relaxed pace and elegant ambiance. We especially loved the sumptuous breakfast there every morning! It was motivation to get up and get going--lovely fruit, croissants, American coffee, lots of choices for anything at all. Lovely service. Perfection!",5,2019,04,24
203,Excellence in Hotel stays,"One of the best hotels I have stayed in. Excellent helpful staff. Location couldn't be better . Shopping at your door step .The best Pubs all around
You can walk to 70% of the attractions Dublin has to offer.",5,2019,04,22
203,Awesome location.  Pricey.,"This place is in the best location and is beautiful.  Warning to others with a four person family.   We have two kids 9 and 12.  We reserved a suite.  They will not allow more than three people in a room.  We had to get a second room for 300 euros.  Total cost 800 usd for one night.  

They say this is for safety.   After spending time there I would recommend apartments.   

Ireland is overlooked for us Americans because most Americans only travel to Europe a few times going to Paris or Rome. 

Ireland is awesome and the people are wonderful.  The best people we have ever been around. ",4,2019,04,22
203,Looking tired....,"The plus points; fantastic staff, perfect location, wonderful communal areas, breakfast was excellent! 

The negatives; bathroom was tired, loo roll holder and toilet flush handle both loose. I‚Äôve stayed at The Westbury previously and the rooms were lovely, but this time the room was not as I expected. I specifically asked for a quiet room but it was anything but...on my last day there was what sounded like maintenance being carried out above my room...the last and most worrying part of my stay was the bedroom door ...it didn‚Äôt shut properly and when I came back to my room I realised it was open during my absence! On another occasion a member of staff knocked on my door to inform me it wasn‚Äôt shut properly....",3,2019,04,22
203,"Nice stay, hotel, and staff","Stayed here for a night. All staff members were very nice and helpful. Would recommend staying for a trip to Ireland
Rooms were nice - not huge but as good as we had anywhere in our 10 day trip. Close to pubs, shopping, and the heart of the city",4,2019,04,21
203,"Top Notch Service, Awesome location","Centrally located, this top notch hotel with impeccable service is a great choice if you are visiting Dublin. Especially if you plan on booking some day tours from local tour agencies like Extreme Ireland which is really just 5mins walk away. The main shopping area along Grafton Street is just a stone throw away. Overall a really great stay with unforgettable experience. ",5,2019,04,19
203,Excellent Hotel,"We returned to the Westbury after having stayed there 20 years ago. It was every bit as wonderful as we had remembered. The hotel is beautiful, comfortable, and well located. The best feature of all are the kind and dedicated staff. Thomas in the consierge department was especially kind and helpful. On a future visit to Dublin we will definitely return and cannot recommend it enough.",5,2019,04,18
203,Afternoon tea for a special occasion at the Gallery,"We recently enoyed afternoon tea at the Westbury.  the service was excellent, particular kudos to Geovaney for his knowledge of the different teas available.  It was a lovely treat to try more than one of the tea options on the menu.
The ambience was very relaxed and we could have stayed longer than the 3 hours we were there if we had not had other plans.",5,2019,04,16
203,Westbury is the Bestbury,Another great stay at this beautiful hotel.   The service is excellent.   Easy restaurant and tour bookings through the helpful Concierge desk.   Can't beat the location either.   Easy access to everything in Dublin,5,2019,04,16
203,Disappointed,"The hotel is a little bit rundown. Check-in and out were uneventful. Bad internet connection. The concierge servbice was useful. The service at the main restaurant, especially for breakfast, was simply terrible. Really disgusting. Would stay somewhere else next time in Dublin.",3,2019,04,16
203,Beautiful Hotel,"Lovely rooms, Lovely staff and overall great experience. Highly recommend!
A great location to be in Dublin - in walking distance to everything. I was only there one night with work and the hotel made me feel extremely chilled!",5,2019,04,15
203,"Excellent hotel, great service","We stayed as a family of five over the Easter holiday period. We were delighted from start to finish by the standards of the hotel. The high quality breakfast ,well maintain rooms and extra little service touches were well received by all.",5,2019,04,14
203,"Cannot fault, great stay","A brought a party of 12 over to Dublin for the six nations. We were welcomed in so well. Check in was smooth and very friendly and really set the tone for our stay. Hotel is very conveniently located a few mins from the main shopping street. Room was warm, smart, clean and tidy. Bar area was great and private dining facility was superb. A would highly reccomend. ",5,2019,04,14
203,Perfect Afternoon Tea in The Gallery,"Absolutely perfect location for an amazing afternoon tea. Beautiful setting, excellent staff who go that extra mile. Delicious selection of  sandwiches, scones and fabulous cakes - a must in you are in Dublin!",5,2019,04,13
203,Christmas cheer,"Great location in heart of city. Staff very accommodating and welcoming. Balfes restaurant is more reasonably priced than main area up stairs but then it is a very comfortable place to relax and unwind. Rooms are comfortable all you need. Parking underground which is great. 
Very very busy Christmas week , great atmosphere about the hotel.",4,2019,04,11
203,Great Experience...as usual,"Staff at the Westbury make you feel so welcome and you get a sense they genuinely want to make your stay better and love what they do, hard to find these days!  Love the can do attitude and you feel nothing is a problem for them to deal with. ",5,2019,04,11
203,Westbury: A hotel of dreams,"I stayed at the Westbury for 15 nights on a lengthy business trip. I cannot say enough about the kindness of the staff here and their attitude to go above and beyond to ensure you have everything you need. The details here are everything. The beautiful aroma that fills the air when you go through the swinging door, the turned down sheets that await you at night, the chocolate on your bed, the soft jazz music that has been turned on for your return, and the recommendations from the staff on how to find a restaurant are just a few examples of how this place made me feel at home, countries away. The only thing to note is that the onsite fitness center is very small with not much equipment. If you need to workout you can go get a pass from the front desk and for 10 Euro per visit you can go to the gym across the street. 

I can't wait to stay here on my next trip! ",5,2019,04,09
203,Afternoon tea,Probally the best afternoon tea experience in dublin...brough5 my mother in law and even she laft happy which was no easy task..it is expensive but also worth every penny..we couldnt rate it highly enough,5,2019,04,07
203,"Beauty, Elegance, and a (seriously) Can't-Beat-It Location","If you can stay anywhere in Dublin, stay here!  The hotel will not disappoint -- it is so beautiful and elegant and has the absolute best location to get to know Dublin.  It is in the heart of Grafton Street and major tourist sites are just a quick walk away.  Honestly, if you stay here, you probably won't ever need a cab or a public transit ticket -- it is that close to so many sites.  All of our interactions with the concierge staff were very helpful and they will get you where you need to go.

The hotel has a beautiful high tea; I have a few food allergies and was particularly grateful/appreciative that the hotel lets you make substitutions (so many times high tea seems to be set, without any substitutions allowed). I was also impressed that (most times) when a doormen saw us returning, they would run to call an elevator and have it waiting for us --- doesn't get much more attentive or kind than that! 

My one teeny tiny recommendation is to swap out the garbage cans in the bathroom; the foot pedal just does not work and all you end up doing is knocking over the garbage can (every time) -- you really need to bend over and just manually flip the lid yourself (which may be challenging for the elderly or expecting).

All in all, we enjoyed every moment of our stay at the Westbury and would recommend it in a heartbeat.  The turn down service was lovely and it was so nice to return to soft music and a chocolate at the end of a busy day. When we first checked in the hotel brought a little welcome dessert to our room -- a very thoughtful gesture. It is also a very quiet hotel -- i don't think we heard our neighbors or city noises once. Oh, and it has a very comfortable mattress and really luxurious bedding.  If relaxation and a bit of indulgence is your goal (and a great location!), this is absolutely the hotel to book.",5,2019,04,06
203,Tops Family Stay,"For Dublin exploration and comfort, this hotel was tops for our family of grandparents, children, grandchildren .  Room accommodation with breakfast inviting, staff outgoing and helpful, range of restaurant options available.  Parked the car and set off on foot .",5,2019,04,06
203,Excellent hotel in the centre of Dublin,"Stayed here for business. Good sized room with a view and without any noise from the street. Excellent service at check in and check out. Had dinner in the hotel as well which was a very pleasant experience.
Good choice when looking for a hotel in Dublin.",5,2019,04,05
203,Details make all the difference,"You expect great things from a 4 star hotel, but it is the extras that really make the Westbury shine. taking our luggage in days before our scheduled arrival, customized breakfasts and coffees, sitting areas abound and they are all comfortable and give you some privacy. We departed very early and they had a breakfast bar ready to send us off with bakery goods and fresh coffee! Icing on the cake.",5,2019,04,04
203,LOVE this Hotel!,The bed and pillows are heavenly. I loved the turn down service and the chocolates were a beautiful touch. Breakfast was quick and delicious. Great location. Will stay here again on business when I come back. ,5,2019,04,04
203,Great hotel for Dublin stay,"We great Westbury is great location central to walking to museums and shopping .
Pubs are minutes away.
Great breakfast room and classy bar and restaurants.
Best part about the hotel is the great quality of service from the staff.
Front desk staff were really  professional and helpful. 
Highly recommend this hotel!
All American laundry is a block away and beautiful park less than five minute walk through the shopping area.",5,2019,04,04
203,"Great location, beautiful public spaces","My family enjoyed our two night stay at The Westbury. Great central location in Dublin. The public spaces of the hotel are absolutely beautiful and we enjoyed a dinner at each of the restaurants. The room was a suite and was quite large but it wasn't luxurious. I'm not sure if all rooms are done in the same way or if they will be undergoing a renovation but I did expect more. The bed was VERY comfortable. Most every employee we encountered was very friendly but we did experience one less than stellar employee interaction that left us feeling almost embarrassed. We were set to have dinner at Wilde's at 7:30pm and a friend was going to meet us in the lobby at 7:00 to have drinks before dinner. We asked for a table in the Gallery but were told it was full. The hostess suggested we go into the bar The Sidecar to have a drink. We had a 9 year old child with us and we asked her if it was ok for our daughter to be there. She said of course. We go to the bar and were told it wasn't a place for children (bearing in mind it is only 7pm) and to go have a drink in the Gallery. We let the host know the hostess at the Gallery said it is full and that she said our daughter was welcome in the bar. He leaves to check with the hostess and comes back to say fine but isn't happy about it. We let him know it's just to have 1 drink before dinner and to meet our friend and he's visibly relieved making it even more uncomfortable for us. The person who served us was very nice and the drinks were great but we certainly didn't feel very comfortable. When it was time for our dinner reservation we arrived at Wilde's and they were running behind so they asked us to wait in their bar-which seemed perfectly ok for us to be there with a child. If they're not going to be ok with a child in the Sidecar, it needs to be a policy so parents know not to take them there. There are plenty of pubs and bars that are ok with kids up to a certain hour or are not ok with kids at all but it is published on the door or on the website so people know in advance and won't feel embarrassed.",4,2019,04,04
203,short stay,We travelled with our parents and 14 month old for a short stay in Dublin.A travel cot was set up in the room on arrival along with a Westbury teddy bear.Junior was provided with a colouring book and pencils to amuse her during dinner in balfes. Overall superb location friendly efficient staff and a very enjoyable stay.,5,2019,04,02
203,Favorite hotel!,Absolutely love this hotel. Their customer service is second to none. Have stayed here many times and it just keeps getting better. Excellent wine and cocktails selection and food to die for! Looking forward to my next trip already.,5,2019,04,01
203,Exceptional facility to be avoided when busy,"This is a beautiful 1st class hotel in an ideal central location for Dublin city center. You could sense they prided themselves on premier service. Unfortunately it was a full house during both nights of our stay and they didn‚Äôt deliver premium service for us. I won‚Äôt go back and recommend you avoid it on weekends and busy times.

We arrived at the hotel after traveling for over 24 hours, arriving at Dublin on a transcontinental flight. Our travel concierge  had a relationship with the Westbury affording room upgrades when available, early check in, full breakfast, and an Irish whisky sampler. Being full, there was no early check-in for us despite a booking arranged as the first stop after arriving on an overseas flight.  So we were offered a complimentary coffee (breakfast service was over and lunch not yet started) and dozed in the lobby lounge chairs. After noon we needed medications from our luggage, which couldn‚Äôt be found initially. Our luggage and carry on bags had been delivered to our traveling companions room. Our room was ready about 2pm, one hour earlier than the standard 3pm check in. 

Our premium room had a view of the back alley rooftops and a badly stained chair. But we were at last out of the lobby chairs and able to shower, take a nap in the prone, and change clothes.  

We had to request our complimentary whisky sampler as it wasn‚Äôt offered or delivered until requested. 

While dining in the hotel, our traveling companions requested separate checks to be charged to our respective rooms when we first sat down for a dinner that we had reserved. That didn‚Äôt happen and it took nearly 30 minutes and management involvement to rectify once dinner was over.

Again, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a wonderful deluxe accommodation most of the time. It just didn‚Äôt deliver for us. A lesser class facility with motivation to provide requested services would have been preferable.",3,2019,03,31
203,Fantastic,"We stayed at the Westbury two separate times during our week in Ireland.  Arrived in Dublin and stayed 2 nights initially, then went to Galway for two days and returned for the final 4 nights of our trip.   They were nice enough to store the luggage we didn't need in Galway, which was a huge help, as we didn't have to lug so many suitcases around.  Tanya was extremely helpful with our booking via email and also on the phone.  We had a Studio Suite with a rollaway for the first two nights, which was very spacious and the rollaway was perfectly fine for our 15 year old son those nights.  The final 4 nights we stayed in a Deluxe Twin Room which had 2 queen beds and accommodated 4 people. Plenty of room.  The breakfast was well done and delicious, with a large variety of baked goods, scones, croissants, soda bread, pastries, yogurts, cereals, fruit, meats, cheeses, juices, and several hot entree choices (all included).  Service in the restaurant and all over the hotel was excellent.  Eddie, the concierge, was especially helpful and just genuinely pleasant and all of his restaurant recommendations were spot on.  The hotel is in the perfect central location to be able to walk most anywhere.  We even walked home from Aviva Stadium after a game (about 40 minute walk but on a nice night it's easy and safe and better than trying to take public transportation).",5,2019,03,30
203,First Class all the way around,The hotel lives to 5 star rating. It is located in a city center easy walking distance to lots of attractions.  The lobby has fresh flowers leaving a nice aroma upon arrival. The hotel staff bends over backwards to answer questions and make your stay great.  The hotel bar was very nice and the breakfast is good.  The bed was comfortable. My only complaint was weak wifi signal inside our room. Would stay here again in a heart beat,5,2019,03,30
203,Beautiful Hotel & Perfect Location,We recently stayed here during a week long trip to Dublin. The hotel was beautiful and luxurious. We had a wonderful dinner at WILDE one night and top notch martinis at The Sidecar. We will definitely try to stay here on our next trip to Dublin! ,5,2019,03,28
203,Beautiful Hotel ,"My daughter booked the Westbury Hotel in Dublin as a treat for Mother's Day.  We had a suite which was very spacious, clean , fresh and a four poster bed, very comfortable. The bathroom had lovely tolitries and overall very good, the only thing I would have liked  would have been separate shower , not in the bath.  The staff were very good couldn't fault them , very helpful and really looked after you. The breakfast was beautiful , great selection of continental and  an ordered cooked breakfast which was amazing . A lovely hotel, wonderful staff we really enjoyed our night of luxury. We had a couple of lovely cocktails, the bar staff were so nice , thank you!! Enjoyed by both of us . ",5,2019,03,27
203,Excellent hotel and service;central  location ,"Alas only stayed for one night but was very impressed. Excellent  service - unassuming.  Valet parking a great  bonus - thank you.   Loved the fact that our room had enough  robes,  glasses and cups to match  the  number of guests - why  is that such a rare thing? Sidecar cocktail  bar had a great buzz with excellent service and great G & Ts.  Can't beat the hotel for such a central location. I  will be back.",5,2019,03,27
203,Consistent excellence.,"It is my pleasure to write this review. This was my second visit to the Westbury Hotel, which is situated in the heart of Dublin city centre, a great location from which to explore Dublin. From the moment we arrived until we departed, there is nothing negative I can say about the place. A friendly reception team greeted us, the same team member Isabella dealt with us and remembered us from our last visit, a continuity that in most hotels today is absent. She was professional, friendly, personable and efficient - a credit to the establishment.

We went up to our room which was as per the last visit ‚Äì spacious, clean and in modern d√©cor. The king bed was so comfortable on the last visit that we were looking forward to sleeping there again. A plate of delicious sweet treats was then delivered to the room which was an unexpected but very nice touch.

As we had a dinner reservation in the hotel restaurant later, we visited the gallery for a pre-dinner cocktail and we served by gallery waiter Geovanny, who was knowledgeable, professional and efficient. Again the friendliness of the team of the Westbury was evident with staff available but without being intrusive. The cocktails were everything we had hoped for and great value for money. The gallery is a very attractive space that is up above ground level and feels both intimate and spacious at the same time.

It was then down to Balfes for our meal. Of note for remembering me, and for his professionalism was manager Marcin, who again reflected the ethos of the establishment with his efficiency and attention to detail. The food was delicious and the menu had changed since the last time, but there still was a great choice of dishes and what we had was very much up to standard. There was a very warm atmosphere in the restaurant and it is well laid out so your neighbours are not intruding on you, something again that I find is becoming rarer today. The pace of delivery of the food, its quality, temperature and presentation were all excellent. Marcin rectified a minor issue with my meal with grace and I am very grateful for that.

Returning upstairs to the gallery, we had plans to head out to the city for the remainder of the evening and planned to stay for just one drink. It was a Thursday evening and by the time we got there, the place was quiet so we headed into the Sidecar bar for a gentler period of time to let the food settle before leaving for the evening. Greeted by Adrian, seated and drinks and nibbles were promptly delivered. Well, the initial plans for the night were dismissed, as sitting by the fire and sipping our drinks in such a cosy environment meant that we spent the remainder of the night there. The star of the show was our server Stefany who was an engaging and entertaining individual to encounter and a real asset to the Westbury. We were introduced to the manager Julien who was at pains to ensure that our experience was a positive one. It was with regret that both food and alcohol and then tiredness meant that we had to head to bed.

Room service was delivered promptly as ordered the next morning and it was piping hot. It is such a treat to have the full Irish in bed, the perfect antidote to a night‚Äôs excesses. After a quick shower, it was regrettably unfortunately time to leave. Again, we were dealt with by Isabella who consistently provided excellent customer service, even offering us bottled water for our journey home.

Overall, I feel that the environment, food and beverage are all of an excellent standard, but what made the experience so special was the professionalism and friendliness of the multi-talented team of people from all corners of the globe with a positive work ethic and a collective objective to provide exceptional customer service. The Westbury management can be proud of these staff that we met, and the team behind the scenes who all contribute to wonderful customer experience. I look forward to my next visit without reservation.",5,2019,03,26
203,Great Hotel Choice in Dublin,"Loved everything about this hotel.  The location may be the best thing, but it was such a nice place to come home to after very busy days sightseeing.  It was beautiful, had everything you could want right down to the smell!  In fact I had to find out what fragrance they used and they helped me find it to bring home!  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,03,25
203,Great Experience,We recently stayed at The Westbury for St. Patrick's Day weekend and to celebrate a birthday.  The hotel is well appointed and immaculate.  The staff was top notch and bar service was excellent.  I would highly recommend staying here if you are in Dublin.,5,2019,03,25
203,Didn't live up to expectations,"Reading the reviews on this property, I had really high hopes for our stay.  However, when we arrived at 3pm to check in, we were told our room wasn't ready yet and we would need to wait ""a few minutes"".  After checking back 3 times over about 45 minutes, we finally just said we were leaving to walk around since we had no idea when we could expect to check in.
Once we got to our room, we were highly disappointed.  The room was very small and cramped.  The bathroom seemed like it might have been for a handicap accessible room because the sink was so low that we had to bend uncomfortably far to reach it.  The room also just seemed so old and dated, with the furniture all scuffed up and stains on the carpet.  We ended up changing rooms due to the fact that we were so uncomfortable.
I do have to say that other for the check-in process, the staff was top notch.  I want to thank Jack, the manager, especially, for his generous room upgrade to us and treatment during our stay.  The hotel just needs a bit of an upgrade (which I think they are doing by the looks of things) in order to be a great property.",3,2019,03,25
203,Great Staff. Great Location.,"Been a regular at the Westbury for the past couple of years and always enjoy my time there. Great place! Fantastic location for Dublin fun and the staff have always been fantastic. While there seems to be regular scheduled turnover of the employees, people like Ecaterina (lounge) and Daniel (bar) always make my stay enjoyable with their friendliness and professionalism. Looking forward to my next trip!",5,2019,03,24
203,Afternoon Tea on St. Patrick‚Äôs Day! ,"I‚Äôm a huge fan of afternoon tea so have enjoyed some great teas around the world, but Westbury‚Äôs afternoon tea is one of the best. My sister and I enjoyed tea here on St. Patrick‚Äôs Day. We were graciously given a spot by the window with a view of Grafton St. It was such a sanctuary on St Patrick‚Äôs Day. Wonderful, quiet ambiance. The food was excellent and inspired. The tea was delicious. It was clearly prepared with the proper temperature and steeping time. The service was super. I would highly recommend this tea if you‚Äôre in Dublin. ",5,2019,03,23
203,Great location but the staff is by far where you get your 5üåü,"Never have I had a stay that exceeded all expectations due to the staff. Phillip gave me two nights of amazing wine pairings in the restaurant, Wilde. Enough can‚Äôt be said for his extensive knowledge; you‚Äôre in exceedingly excellent hands! 

Across the way in Sidecar, an awesome first night of my stay with Oisin, turned into 3 amazing nights with, Oisin, Stefi, Adrian, and Giacomo. You have a gem in these 4 who can take the experience and hit it home. Personal touches at every corner from all 4. Oisin, Stefi, and Adrian all gave us sites to visit, tourist traps to avoid, and ways to make my experience truly authentically Irish. 

Bravo to this staff and kudos to the GM. You have gems in this group. ",5,2019,03,22
203,stunning hotel - fabulous staff,"This hotel is in a prime position just of Grafton Street.  Its perfect location for getting out and about in Dublin.  The Hotel is spotlessly clean , the breakfast is simply amazing. Lastly, the staff, I can not speak highly enough of them from reception, consierge, servers, housekeeping - every single one of them works hard and are so professional and friendly.  Would love to go back.",5,2019,03,21
203,My Stay at The Westbury,"The Westbury Hotel is conveniently located off Grafton Street.   It is an awesome hotel; clean, friendly and accommodating staff; excellent restaurants.  I enjoyed breakfast in The Wilde; afternoon tea is not to be missed.   I will stay at The Westbury the next time I am in Dublin.   Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,03,19
203,Scrumptious Afternoon!!,"Afternoon tea at theThe Westbury was simply  scrumptious! 
Delicious sandwiches, wonderful scones with jam & clotted cream and of course  pastries to die for!! 
We were a party of seven persons  and a good time was had by all.  

Thank you Westbury..",5,2019,03,19
203,"Love, love, love this hotel.","From the moment of checking in to checking out we were extremely happy with our stay here. We went out for dinner & explore and came back to our room to find the beds turned down, fresh water and glass on the bedside table, a chocolate and slippers placed beside the bed. In the bathroom the toiletries I placed on the the counter were gently placed in order on top of a towel! I‚Äôve never felt more pampered! üíó you won my heart. The cleanliness is A+++ and the room was lovely. Breakfast was delicious and afternoon tea was not only delicious but, beautiful. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly except one, but she must have be having a bad day. Wish I could find the delicious tea we had but, I‚Äôve had no luck! Irish whiskey cream tea. We loved our stay at the Westbury and would most definitely stay again! Thank you.",5,2019,03,19
203,"Amazing hotel, incredible staff, lovely visit","The Westbury exceeded expectations. They could not have been nicer. They helped us secure bus tickets, provided us with a babysitter at the hotel, helped organize a literary walking tour and were just all around amazing. ",5,2019,03,18
203,Amazing stay at The Westbury,"Just came back from spending three nights at The Westbury.  Hotel is absolutely beautiful, staff was amazing.  Great location in the center of everything. Close to all the shops, restaurants and pubs.  The sidecar lounge was incrediable, staff was extremely attentive and nice.  From the minute we pulled up to the hotel, we were greeted by friendly doorman.  We were checked in by Isabella, who could not have been nicer to us and was able to check us into our room early.  Which was great , due to us traveling around Ireland for the past 4 days prior.  She was super helpful and explained everything about the hotel to us.",5,2019,03,18
203,Excellent Customer Service,Staying at the Westbury was the perfect start to our visit to Ireland. We arrived at the hotel at 9:30 am and the front desk clerk informed us that our room was ready to check in. That was the best news! All the staff we encountered just made us feel so welcomed. I really appreciated the concierge finding an adapter for me to use while at the hotel. The breakfast at Wildes has something for everyone and loved our lunch at Balfes. The Westbury is in a fantastic location. Close to everything. We will definitely stay here in our future visits.,5,2019,03,18
203,Beautiful hotel in a great location,The Westbury is a great place to stay! Centrally located by great shopping and restaurants/pubs.This is where I stay when i come to Dublin. The staff is super nice and extremely helpful. The restaurants are great as well.,5,2019,03,16
203,Great hospitality in center,"We strolled into this hotel with our kids after the park  , we had a seat upstairs in the sidecar bar and it has to be said the service was excellent! , we were served by Adrian and another lady whose name I cant remember  ,they made sure our tired children were very well looked after and made sure all of the food we ordered came out in time ! we didn't have any cocktails on this occasion but we want to come back next time and try them as they look divine !",5,2019,03,14
203,"First time, not the last!","Went to The Westbury with three friends to celebrate my friend¬¥s Birthday. We had such an amazing experience, delighted with the atmosphere and the staff.

203,Made our stay in Dublin amazing!,"I have stayed at the Westbury a few times now. I look forward to returning on my next trip. This trip I went with my fiance. It was his first trip to Ireland and he really enjoyed the hotel. 

All of the staff at the bar were fantastic and the drinks were incredible. We returned a few times. Michael was incredibly welcoming and hospitable. Daniel made most of our drinks for us and we were both so impressed. Definitely some of the best drinks I have ever had! We are still talking about the drinks!

Stephanie was also amazing! She went out of her way to find us a snack long after the kitchen had closed. She was so kind and helpful. Stephanie really saved our evening and her hospitality made our stay!",5,2019,03,10
203,Westbury Hotel,"I chose this hotel primarily for its location, but was genuinely impressed by the friendliness, efficiency and helpfulness of the staff.
I really liked the decor and the ambiance in the lounge area.
Valet parking was very nice also.",5,2019,03,10
203,A fantastic experience,"Myself and three friends had afternoon tea last Sunday. The hospitality and service was fantastic. We were there for a mini hen party and the staff in the gallery made it a very special experience, going above and beyond for us. I'd like to particularly thank Ecaterina, her attentive service and wonderful demeanour really made our day! Thank you Ecaterina and everyone at the gallery. ",5,2019,03,09
203,Westbury Hotel,"I do stay in a lot of hotels in Ireland with work.While the Westbury is not usually in my price range. I did book it for a special occasion & it was worth every penny. Breakfast is really good. Location fantastic & staff very friendly. 
 ",5,2019,03,07
203,Amazing location and friendly welcome,"Love staying here because of the great location, fantastic lounge area and a wonderful breakfast. Just off Stephens Green and Grafton Street so amazing convenience for shops etc. 
I find the rooms a little on the compact side but a friendly greeting and warm welcome always expected. 

Turned up a day early compared to reservation and no problem whatsoever!!",5,2019,03,06
203,Outstanding,"Hotel is in prime condition. Very well appointed, stylishly laid out with forethought and class. Staff is outstanding and a true asset to the hotel. Clearly well selected and well trained.  Restaurants and bars a pleasurable experience and food and cocktails a strength, A very nice stay.",5,2019,03,06
203,Definitely worth a visit ,"This is my second trip to this hotel and from the moment we walked in the door up until we left we can not fault the place. The staff are warm and welcoming and nothing is too much effort. 
Lovely spacious hotel rooms and the comfiest beds. 
We booked afternoon tea in the gallery and it‚Äôs definitely recommended. The staff were very helpful. Offering recommendations based on our likes and dislikes. The scones with the clotted cream and jam I could have ate them all day. 
Breakfast spread was amazing. So much choice from hot food to cold meat platter, fruit and pastries. I had one tiny niggle. The twice we stayed at breakfast both times they forgot to severe is our toast and we had to ask for it again. But if that‚Äôs my only complaint then I won‚Äôt worry. 
I will definitely be back again. ",5,2019,03,06
203,Stunning hotel and fantastic staff,"wow... The Westbury is the perfect hotel when staying in Dublin. The location is second to none, right in the centre of the action on the respectable Grafton St and by the infamous Bruxelles bar. We were able to walk to all the cocktail bars, brown thomas, restaurants like the Bank and Fire... great location. The place is stunning, the rooms styled in the art deco theme, fine glassware in the rooms with huge, comfortable beds. All with nespresso machines, iron, hairdryer etc and Aromatherapy Associates toiletries. They kindly upgraded our room and brought a happy birthday treat to the room for my partner, lovely touches. Reception and Concierge were all so friendly. i can't recommend this place more.",5,2019,03,04
203,Nights Stay in the Westbusry,"Fantastic Hotel right in the center of Dublin. Staff are extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful. Everything about the hotel is excellent. Food was great, service was great, location is great and they went the extra mile to make our stay there special.",5,2019,03,04
203,Good location,"This hotel was a relief from where we had spent a previous night in Galway. As soon as the taxi dropped us off, we were treated by the bellman to take our bags. All the front end staff was nice and treated us well, and were extremely helpful. The room was very nice, I‚Äôd compare it to a nice Westin. The location was in the heart of Dublin, close to lots of bars and restaurants right out the doors. Shopping very close by and all the tourists locations in walking distance. Definitely a good hotel to stay at if you‚Äôll be in Dublin a few days. Restaurant on site was very good. It got busy late, as most eat very late there. ",5,2019,03,03
203,Extremely efficient service!,"This is my first time to Dublin, Ireland. I don‚Äôt know what to expect. 

But The Westbury gave me a great first day experience in Dublin.

I booked the hotel through Booking.com and I mistakenly put the wrong month! Instead of February, I clicked March. 

So, basically I showed up at the reception with no reservations! 

I was immediately assisted at the desk, given a room with the same type, with the same price, and they notified Booking.com so there is no additional charge for my mistake.

I am so glad I picked this hotel while staying a few days in Dublin.

A very friendly and efficent service indeed. 

I highly recommend it!

203,Exemplary; World-Class Service in a wonderful; comfortable true 5-star hotel.,"I have been all over the world, staying in 5 star hotels such as The Plaza NYC and the Ritz Carlton in Hawaii.  The Westbury Hotel have stood heads and shoulders above those and more in terms of welcoming and exemplary service across the board.  The best service I have ever experienced hands down.  I am just sorry I never stayed here before.  It is now my go-to hotel of choice.  Your staff make all the difference - it doesn't matter how big the room is or how comfortable the beds are - if the service is not good the rest doesn't matter.  You guys made a very emotional weekend that bit more easy.  Thank you.",5,2019,02,24

The lady that took care of us was Camille and she was so nice and gave me a complimentary birthday cake. It made me feel so special and showed the attention to detail and that the staff really wanted the patrons to have a wonderful time. I cannot wait to visit again.",5,2019,02,19

203,Amazing Afternoon Tea!,"This was a ladies day out to buy the ""dress"" for the bride for her big day! To celebrate the event the five of us had booked to have Afternoon Tea in The Gallery, upstairs in the Westbury!  Ecaterina was our hostess and she made us feel like celebrities, Our menu was explained in detail and our dietary needs taken into consideration. We had a lovely table near the large open fire. We were in awe when our three tiered afternoon tea arrived. The lower tier had a selection on sandwiches, Honey Baked Limerick Ham, Sundried Tomato Relish on Malt Harvest bread, delicious Truffled Chicken Salad on a Brioche Bun, Oak Smoked Salmon & Crab on Soda Bread and Free Range Egg & Chive white sandwiches. All the sandwiches were tasty and freshly made. 
The second tier was all enclosed in a spotless warm table napkin and what it revealed when opened was warm freshly baked fruit and plain buttermilk scones served with raspberry jam and clotted cream. Delicious. There was also a tiny lemon zest little scone. 
The top tier was amazing, a work of art. I can't imagine  the amount of work that went into baking and presenting such an array of mouth watering desserts, pots of vanilla mousse with blackberries and blueberries, tiny eclairs with a delicate hazelnut filling, tiny chocolate desserts and a lemon curd dessert. 
The highlight for the whole experience for us was when Ecaterina, our host,arrived at our table to surprise the ""bride to be"" with a specially made dessert from the chef! The dessert had ""YES TO THE DRESS"" in script writing,iced in a chocolate icing, across the bottom of the plate! What a surprise! It made our day. We were nearly in tears. Loved the whole experience, it was so personal, the food was delicate and delicious, the surroundings were comfortable and relaxing. The best part was the customer service by all staff especially our host. Well done, A day to remember. We will be back. Afternoon Tea is an experience not to be missed.",5,2019,02,16
203,Valentine's stay,"Stayed here with my wife for valentines.
The room was clean and the bed was really comfortable. 
We used room service and the food was excellent.
We were just expecting more of a wow factor for a 5 star hotel, that's why I'm giving this a 4 out 5.",4,2019,02,15
203,Luxury,We have stayed at the Westbury 4 or 5 times and it is a luxurious hotel right on Grafton Street. It has 3 different restaurants in it. It has a great room near the lobby and bar where you can sit and have drinks or appetizers. There are numerous couches and chairs in this room. The service at the hotel is great all around.  It is centrally located and withing walking distance to St. Stevens green. It is my favorite hotel in Dublin and definitely within the top 3 of my favorite of all time. ,5,2019,02,12
203,Great mini break,"Stayed at Westbury for a short mini break, hotel is exceptionally comfortable, staff made us feel like celebrities, the place is extremely well run. Service in restaurant Balfes is terrific, we will definitely be back.",5,2019,02,12
203,Excellent Service; Perfect Location,"So... this is a complicated review, but I hope it will be helpful to people. We absolutely loved The Westbury, but we had several issues that we think others can avoid by asking for certain things up front.  First, here is what we loved:
1. excellent location.  we walked everywhere and never needed transportation.
2. great selections for breakfast - book directly with the hotel and look for room rates that include free breakfast. its expensive if you pay for it, but delightful and fabulous if it's included in your room rate. In our rate, we could enjoy continental breakfast (fruits, pastries, nuts, yogurts, juices, meats) or order cooked breakfast from the menu (pancakes, eggs, porridges, outstanding made-to-order options) - all included.
3. coffee/tea selection was great as well - if you want American coffee, be sure to ask for ""Pot of Coffee""
4. The business center, although just a computer and printer, was perfect and i was able to print a bunch of documents, for free, and use their computer, which i appreciated since my wifi wasn't working very well (more on that later)
4. Service was outstanding at this hotel. (more on that later too)

So here is what we wish we would have done when we made our reservation: If you know that you will need good Wifi in your room, tell them ahead of time. Our room was at the very end of the hallway and had awful Wifi. However, when we called the front desk, they were very attentive and sent someone up to our room immediately to connect a portable hotspot.  it worked for a few minutes, but then failed too. Bottom line is that a more central room probably has better Wifi signal and they offered to move us (again, excellent service!) but we were already all unpacked and settled.

Second request - we should have requested a room that would be quiet. Again, we were at the end of the hallway (Room 402) and housekeeping goes in and out of the room next door repeatedly, all morning and afternoon. The slamming doors are loud and can be really irritating. Add to that - the room next to us was under construction and all morning long we had drilling and sawing and was so loud that we couldn't even have a conversation and I had to leave the room to take a business call. 

Finally, the food and drinks at this hotel are outstanding in the lobby and at Sidecar (the bar). Craft cocktails were fantastic and the food was really good in all venues at this hotel. But the true value in The Westbury is the top-notch service that the entire team delivers. Each time we raised an issue, they were responsive and tried to fix it immediately.  The business center, the front desk, the concierge and baggage teams - every person with whom we interacted was simply excellent.  And that's why I still gave it 5 stars despite our little mishaps! When we return to Dublin, we will stay here again.",5,2019,02,10
203,In the middle of the action,"This was my second stay at this property and, like before, it did not disappoint.  This time my wife came along and we stayed for five days. The hotel is situated in the center of the Grafton Street area which allows you to visit the major Dublin attractions by foot. There is a large number of hotel staff and they all are highly attentive to a guests needs. We booked a larger room which put us on the Grafton Street side of the property. This provided some nice afternoon sunshine in the room.  My only complaints are the room was a little tired and had a few minor issues that were annoying. For instance, the lights had on/off switches in the other room (counterintuitive) and a shower door without a bottom gasket that leaked lots of water  onto the bathroom floor.  The staff warned us about these issues which said to me they knew of the room problems but chose not to fix them. That seemed kind of lame. Still, overall, a nice property located right where the action is in Dublin. We would stay again.",4,2019,02,09
203,central luxury,Great place to stay if you appreciate a little luxury and history - its spacious and beautiful - but not uncomfortable with welcoming staff and a casual atmosphere with staff in the background if needed- great spaces to sit and meet for business and lovely ambiance and friendly bar staff in the lower bar (albeit a little pricey if your staying for a while!) ,5,2019,02,08
203,Brilliant stay! ,"Currently sat in the bar, which is as amazing as the rest of he hotel - Art Deco themed, which is a winner! Cocktails are consistently very good, which is very hard to find! 
Wilde Resturant is ‚Äògood hotel food‚Äô, it‚Äôs not fine dinning or tasting menu, but it‚Äôs a good menu, cooked well.
Rooms, are as expected for a 5* hotel. 
Breakfast is good, again nice for a change to be included, worth waking for.
Turn down is better than most. 

My only negative comment which stops my review from getting 5*, is the bar closing - most hotel bars will remain open while people are drinking? This one seems to close when the team decide, despite people being here (excluding myself). Very odd as everything else service wise is very attentive! 

Will be back, just hope bar hours have been extended! üòÄ",4,2019,02,06
203,lovely hotel excellent location,"The Westbury is a lovely hotel located in the heart of Dublin. The staff are very friendly and the rooms are comfortable, clean and very quiet. There is a great atmosphere in the bar area and reception/high tea area. We were also given a complimentary glass of champagne in the bar before ordering one of their many great cocktails! The breakfast was very good too. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,02,06
203,Pleasant experience,"I can't recommend this hotel enough. The Staff are extremely friendly and would help without any hesitation. I lost my phone in a taxi and 1 staff in particular went to great lengths to ensure my phone was returned to my home in England.  The location is perfect for many attractions and close enough to lively boozers if that's your bag (I certainly enjoyed this part). The room was clean and a good size, really felt at home. Will be returning soon and wouldn;t stay anywhere else other than the Westbury.",5,2019,02,05
203,First class Hotel,"We found this hotel on trip advisor , it is quite simply superb . Great location , the staff are all friendly and very professional , a trully stylish classy hotel . 5 stars . Old school elegance . Rooms are clean , newly refurbished and elegant , beds nice , bathroom was well stocked with 
fabulous aromatherapy products . Amazing Art Deco bar off the lobby , felt glamorous drinking cocktails in there and reasonable prices . Breakfast served in a beautiful dining room , with open fire and conservatory . The chef will make you anything you ask for . Splendid Egg Benedict . And the guest relations manager arranged flowers and chocolates as it was our annerversary . What a lovely touch . I can‚Äôt wait to revisit Dublin and there is nowhere else I want to stay .",5,2019,02,04
203,An excellent city centre hotel that had it all.,"We stayed here on a cold Saturday night as a treat. From start to finish, everything was great. Staff are attentive and helpful, and the hotel itself is very modern and luxurious. Definitely stay here again.",5,2019,02,03
203,Wonderful stay at The Westbury,"A fabulous hotel. Staff are so welcoming, charming and really want to give great service. I couldn't believe it when the housekeeper knocked on our door to see if there was anything we needed, such as more water. She was smiley and really genuinely want to give great service. Rooms are superb - didn't want to leave that bed. Great toiletries and lovely to have a coffee machine. Great location. Highly recommended.",5,2019,02,03
203,Rugby weekend,"First time I have stayed in this hotel. Great location in the city centre and the staff in the hotel are very good. We did however have an issue when we wanted to order room service on the Friday night and they could not provide what was offered on the in room menu.
After voicing my concern I did receive a call the following morning from Aine who was very apologetic and took the complaint very seriously. She also provided us with breakfast free of charge for both mornings. Nevertheless it was disappointing that a hotel of this ilk had this issue n the first place.

I also found it a little disconcerting to be asked to provide evidence of my hotel card key before I was allowed to enter the hotel when I returned at 2am after a very good night out!",4,2019,02,03
203,Great place to stay in Dublin,"The Westbury is central, very close to Grafton Street, is relaxing, has great restaurants, lovely staff. We could walk everywhere, eat at Wilde if we wanted. The food was lovely. When the lounge was full they always found us a table so we could enjoy a sun-downer. Great hotel.",5,2019,02,02
203,Excellent,"Stayed with my husband last night, everything was amazing. What an incredible staff you have, I have to give a special mention to some in particular who made our stay memorable and incomparable: Ellen and Alexis from the gallery who were superb for afternoon tea, Patrick,Adrian,Gabriel and Giacamo from the sidecar who could not have done enough for us. Cannot wait to return, counting our days until our next return. Will definitely recommend to my friends.",5,2019,02,01
203,Westbury Comfort,"I have stayed at the Westbury seven times now, all for pleasure visits to Dublin.  Every one on the staff has been friendly, helpful, and thoroughly professional.  I keep returning because of the care I have received there.  To give an example, on a visit last year, my flight landed early in the morning, and I was at the hotel by 8:30.  I didn't expect a room to be available that early, and it wasn't.  However, the manager addressed me by name and invited to have breakfast on the house.  Every interaction I have had there - desk, restaurant, bar, housekeeping - has been exceptional.  I plan to return in September.",5,2019,02,01
203,Weekend in Dublin,We've stayed at The Westbury about 6 times now and it is still my number #1 hotel in Dublin. The location is brilliant and the staff are excellent. The hotel has a lovely warm and welcoming atmosphere and the staff are always available for a chat. ,5,2019,02,01
203,Winter break @ the Westbury,"Great location and the staff were so friendly and accommodating, nothing was a problem, this resulted in a fabulous experience.  We had drinks in the cocktail bar where we had reserved a table I'd recommend this.  We only eat in the hotel for breakfast and this was fab especially the pancakes.",5,2019,01,31
203,Awesome hotel in Dublin!,"We were greeted by the staff right when we got to the hotel.  Everyone was so friendly and they upgraded our room for free.  Ivan took us up to our room where dessert and wine were waiting for us. The room was fantastic!  If you‚Äôre looking for a great hotel in Dublin, this is it!",5,2019,01,30
203,Afternoon tea in a beautiful setting,I booked afternoon tea with a few pals in January. The others had their babies with them. Great location. Comfortable couches. Staff were excellent. The sandwiches and scones were excellent but the deserts were hit and miss. Maybe we had enough at that stage. Overall a great experience for a special occasion.,4,2019,01,28
203,Disappointed ,"Having booked a one night stay as a birthday gift, I was looking forward to a wonderful stay in s five star hotel. We arrived at approximately 3pm and check in was quick and easy. On being advised that the room was upgraded I had great expectations . However the upgraded room was smaller than expected, although bright and tastefully decorated. I would certainly have been disappointed with the original room as the upgrade left me underwhelmed. The bathroom had a shower within the bath, not something I‚Äôm particularly fond of. The step up into the bath was very high and would be difficult for an older person or someone with difficult mobility. The side bath panel was warped and had seen better days and I discovered later that the temperature control was faulty. The covers for hot and cold were missing and the screws visible which made temperature control extremely difficult. 
But my greatest disappointment was in the hotel lobby areas. Although it was only 3pm we could not get access to the Sidecar bar, as it was too busy. The same with the main lobby area. This is extremely frustrating when you are already a resident of the hotel. Surely tables can be held specifically for residents rather than customers walking in off the street? The same situation met us Balfes  bar, no seats for at least an hour. At no stage during the booking process was I advised to reserve a table in any of the facilities. 
In the end we left and found somewhere nearby. We had a meal booked in a nearby restaurant and returned to the hotel around 7pm to exactly the same situation. We eventually stood at the bar in Balfes until one of the servers found us seats. 
I appreciate the hotel is busy which is terrific for their business. However a five star hotel should have facilities in place to cater for guests. Surely a residents lounge is not too much to expect????
Breakfast the next morning was exceptionally good with an abundance of choice and excellent service. We went early for breakfast as we were going for a walk around the city. On return around 10.30 the queue for breakfast was ridiculous , with many sitting in the main lobby area to eat. Again I would have been very annoyed if I had to face that. 
I‚Äôve stayed in numerous five star hotels and always felt valued and felt the extra cost worth it. However overall due to the lack of access to the facilities I have to say the birthday celebration was somewhat spoiled. It would have been lovely to sit in the hotel and relax, go for our meal, and return and have a quiet cocktail afterwards. Instead we never go to experience the cocktail lounge at all and the drinks in Balfes were hurried and anything but relaxing.
On a positive note I will say the staff were friendly efficient and courteous. 
I won‚Äôt be returning to the Westbury, I think there are plenty of other five star hotels around that can cater for their guests in a better manner. Sorry üôÅ
",4,2019,01,28
203,Amazing weekend!,We were spoiled by the amazing service.We felt really welcome from the first second.Ivan and Valentina in the reception were super kind and helpful.Special thanks to Ashley (concierge) who gave us a map and explained everything that we could do within the two days that we spent in Dublin. We will definitely come back.,5,2019,01,26
203,Great Hotel,"This hotel was beautiful and so conveniently located to Graffton Street for shopping.The staff were so accommodating, arranging a great tour to Castle Malahyde and then to Aqua for a delicious lunch.  The bars were beautiful and we had a wonderful dinner at Wilde.  Our room was spacious and very nice, but we could never understand the lighting system.  This is a great business hotel!",5,2019,01,25
203,Five star ,Fantastic located hotel center of Dublin everything about the hotel from relaxing area in lobby to spacious bedrooms breakfast is top notch with a great choice and properly the best fruit I have seen in a buffet in a while can‚Äôt wait  to go back ,5,2019,01,22
203,First Class in Dublin,"The hotel is located ideally in the City Center nd near to Trinity College, near to shopping areas (Graffton Street). Hotel has highest standard and caters for all customers demands. Recommend to stay in upper stories {.noise level)",5,2019,01,21
203,Paul and Katherine Smith,From the minute we entered the hotel we were treated like royalty from the concierge and check in staff our bags  were brought up to our room within 10 minutes the room was amazing lovely comfy bed coffee making facilities and all accessories were superb all staff could not do enough for us food and drink service was excellent  would highly recommend this hotel,5,2019,01,20
203,Fantastic Stay/Great Location!,"I had narrowed our search down to a few  luxury hotels. We have been to Dublin a few times before and wanted to try something new. The Westbury was our selection and a grand one it was. It was perfectly located to meet our needs. The staff was very nice and super accomodating. They assisted us with any needs and answered all our requests for assistance. The room was large and luxurious. We were very impressed with our stay and have passed our feelings on to several friends. The facility was very clean, bright and nice decorated with flowers. The staff also arranged for us to get a cab whenever we needed. This was a great stay and well worth looking into.",5,2019,01,18
203,My favourite hotel in Dublin,"This hotel has everything I love in a very good hotel. Really good rooms, fantastic breakfast all of the basics are really well done. The bar is an enjoyable Art Deco space to while a way some time. Lots of options on food. Staff who know Dublin well and offer water when you come in after a jog around Dublin. The hotel is perfectly located near everything you will want to do in Dublin.",5,2019,01,15
203,Always welcoming,"I have stayed here a few times now on business and have always found it a friendly hotel.  The food in Balfes Restaurant is lovely. The menu is not extensive but the quality has always been very good.

The staff are excellent and go out of their way to be both welcoming and helpful. The hot towel on arrival is a nice little touch after travelling.

The rooms are comfortable, clean and well appointed. Note if you forgot your phone charger like I did this trip then check out the mini bar, I kid you not.",5,2019,01,15
203,"Beautiful hotel, top notch service, horrible mattress","Let me start with the Pros:

-Every staff member is extremely friendly and helpful.  They went above and beyond!
-Very Clean
-Great Location!
-Spacious Room
-Delicious Afternoon Tea

Cons:
-The room was supposed to have a Teddy Bear Picnic in a tent set up in the room (travelling with two children).  It was not there.  We called to request it and were told it would be brought up shortly.  We left for the day and when we came back at 8:45pm, it still was not there.  A third call got it delivered and set-up finally.
-TV did not work upon arrival.  Two different people had to come to get it working.
-On-site breakfast was not great.  The continental breakfast was nice, but the traditional irish breakfast was luke warm and not the highest quality of meat.
***  BIGGEST concern:  The bed is NOT comfortable. If I am paying up for a 5 star hotel, I am expecting to get a good night sleep.  That did not happen.  The bed was very firm with no pillow-top or cushioning at all.  I asked if there was a solution and they assured me they would take care of it.  A second comforter was put on the bed under the flat sheet.  This did nothing to solve the problem.  I went out and purchased mattress pads for us for the remaining nights.  

I shared the concern with the bed specifically in the online survey from the Westbury.  It was addressed by an offer to upgrade to a suite, if available, on our next visit there.  Is that where the 5 star beds are?  I don't know that I can risk another $330+ a night knowing I may still not get a good night sleep.",4,2019,01,15
203,Excellent stay!,"We loved this hotel.  The location was wonderful, with pedestrian-only Grafton Street just out the door.  We chose a suite, which was generously sized and very comfortable.  We enjoyed the breakfast buffet, and found the staff more than helpful on every occasion.  Would happily stay again!",5,2019,01,15
203,Superb,"We loved our short stay here - the room was clean, comfortable & had everything you needed for a short stay.  The reception area and restaurants/bars are beautifully decorated & the flower arrangements really stand out.  All the staff we met were friendly & helpful.  The location is excellent for shopping/theatre/sightseeing.  We loved it!",5,2019,01,14
203,Free lemonade ,I went there multiple times and they give free lemonade. It was nice too. And I liked the hotel room a lot. The bar is nice too. The outside is nice too. It‚Äôs close to the theater too. It has a big breakfast buffet too.,5,2019,01,13
203,Great service and location ,"My first time in this hotel and I was impressed.
Fantastic location, in the heart of Dublin, so convenient for all the tourist attractions.
The greeting at reception was great, staff are friendly and very helpful.
Rooms are big and airy, lovely facilities with a large bathroom with all the toiletries needed.
They also supply an;tinted guide with fitness exercises to be on top shape.
Flowers arrangements in the lobby are exquisite.",5,2019,01,12
203,Outstanding service,"We visited The Westbury Hotel during a recent visit to Dublin. 

Just walking into the hotel is a joy and one can feel a sense of relaxation and friendliness throughout the building. 

The food and drinks were expertly prepared and served, but  what made it particularly  enjoyable for us was the warm welcome from Aine , one of the receptionists. 
She was welcoming, professional and knowledgeable and nothing was too much trouble for her. 
with such a warm welcome and excellent service we plan on returning when in Ireland again at the end of the month",5,2019,01,10
203,Great hotel,"Awesome stay, very comfortable rooms, helpful desk, great location!! Happy we stayed here and would stay again. Front desk staff was great and concierge was very helpful. Rooms were nice amd beds were comfortable.",5,2019,01,07
203,Deluxe - Over the Top -- Fabulous,"My daughter and I checked in on the 23rd of December.  We had been warned not to go to Ireland during Christmas Week.  I could not disagree more.  We had a fabulous time and everything was perfect.  The location, out the back for taxi's and out the front and you are in the middle of the shopping district.  Lovely flower ladies on almost every corner selling beautiful Christmas flowers.  
The windows in Dublin are fabulous!  New York has nothing on them.
There are several concierges at the Westbury and one is nicer than the next.
The breakfast service is impecable and consists of anything that your heart desires.
Our room was two queen beds and had adequate closet space and a lovely bath.
The restaurants in the hotel are just right with choices for snacks, full service, bar menu, and a lovely bar downstairs called Balffe.  What more could you ask for?
We found a lovely cab driver on our first day and we used him for the rest of our stay.
He can be booked ahead and has just the right about of information and suggestions.
Brian -- ask for him.  you won't be disappointed.",5,2019,01,07
203,Afternoon tea,"Myself and my partner went for afternoon here during Christmas and to say it was amazing would be an understatement! Loved everything about it, the food was stunning and the service was amazing. Best afternoon tea in Dublin!! ",5,2019,01,07
203,Ok,"Stayed over the New Year and were very pleased with the check in and the room was adequate for our purpose.  Bathroom was small

We had the breakfast in the hotel and on the last morning it arrived 3 times all being wrong

After a long day looking around the city. We found it hard to believe that they wasn‚Äôt an area for residents to sit and have a chat. I think the hotel are more interested in serving afternoon teas than catering for their guests 

Overall good location but lacking a residents specific area",4,2019,01,07
203,First Time Staying in Many Years - Better than Ever,"I stayed here with my family for one night in October 2018. We arrived up from Cork in our own car and with help from Google Maps with Navigation, made our way through the narrow backstreets around College Green and Grafton Street to the front side of the hotel. I ran into the hotel entrance hall and asked one of the porter staff to come out and help with the car - this hotel has underground parking, and they will take the car down there for you, and bring it up again when you are leaving. They unloaded our bags and took the car while we went back into the hall and up to reception to check in. This was my first time staying at the Westbury since I was a teenager (more than a decade ago now), and was delighted to see the reception/ground floor area was bustling and as spacious as I remembered it. The check-in experience were fantastic, and provided us with the keys to our two rooms. They also made a dinner reservation for us in the main restaurant because it was going on 9PM, and we were hungry. We had actually tried to do this ourselves online in the car on the way up, but the booking system on the website said it was full, but of course they had space for us as hotel guests.

Rooms: Both rooms were of type ""Classic Room 1 Queen Bed"", and were located two doors away from each other - note we had not requested them to be next to each other. Also, neither room interconnected with the rooms next to them. Both rooms were identical. This room type is the cheapest type of room - regardless of price though, the rooms were beautiful - very refined and elegant looking, with that luxurious feel, both the room and bathrooms. The room features tea/coffee making facilities, a fully-stocked minibar, complimentary Wi-Fi, and also good connectivity options on the flatscreen TV - USB and HDMI ports. As this was evening, the room had already been turned down, and there a lovely Butlers Irish chocolate left on the bed. Slippers were also on the floor next to the bed as part of the turn-down service. Complimentary water was also provided on the bedside, and on the desk area as well. The room also had effective air-conditioning that was easy to operate, and had been set to warm the room before we entered. The room also featured a Nespresso machine, but no pods as far as I could see. A safe, ironing board, and hairdryer were also in the wardrobe. Finally, the room also featured a nice seating area with two armchairs and a table with complimentary magazines. 
The bathroom featured a bathtub that container a shower-head, and several nice amenities from Aromatherapy Associates London.
Both the room and bathroom were exceptionally clean, and no issues at all to speak of. Fabulous rooms overall, very happy with them. Pictures of the room and bathroom are attached to this review. Note that the water, turn-down, and complimentary chocolates were provided on both sides of the bed in my parents room - I had my room to myself, and so these were only done on one side of the bed.

Dining: The main restaurant in the hotel is called WILDE, and as I mentioned in the introduction, the reception were able to book us in here when we arrived. The restaurant was indeed busy on a Friday night, I would say with a mixture of guests and locals, there were some spare tables for sure. We were promptly welcomed and seated. We were initially given only a tasting menu for whatever reason, but we asked for the A La Carte menu, which had a great, diverse choice of dishes. I had a starter of soup - I can't remember what soup is what unfortunately - I believe it was Celeriac. I had a Salmon fillet main course and a side of mashed potatoes, while the rest of my family had the Hereford Beef Burger. I had a dessert of Vanilla ice-cream. We ate quickly because we were quite tired at this point! The dinner was delicious, all dishes were nicely presented and very tasty indeed.
This is also the room where they served a lovely breakfast the next morning. I had some delicious porridge, and HOT toast, which always seems hard to get in hotels when toast is brought out from the kitchens, rather than toast it yourself. There was both a buffet selection for cereals, breads, pastries, meats, etc, while the hot dishes were made to order in the kitchen. It was a fantastic breakfast I have to say. The dining room in WILDE is very nice - far nicer than it was back when I visited when I was younger (not WILDE back then of course).
The lounge area across from reception also serves food, and my parents had an excellent club sandwich and chips there. Really nice views from both WILDE and the lounge looking down onto the street. Note that the lounge is very busy - my mother went in herself to ask for a table, and was turned away for not having a reservation. My father eventually joined her, and he went up for a table, telling the staff that they were guests in the hotel (my mother neglected to mention that), and they did at this point get a table - so if you're looking to walk in off the street be aware it is a busy place, and you might not get a table.
Pictures of the dishes are also attached to this review.

Location: If there was some award for best hotel location for anything in the word, The Westbury should surely be shortlisted. Go out of the hotel, walk for 30-60 seconds straight in front of you, and you are on Grafton Street. A 5-Star hotel less than a minute way from the middle of Dublin's main shopping street? It's why we chose the Westbury. With this of course you have easy access to St. Stephen's Green at one end of Grafton Street, and College Green with Trinity College at the other. Aside from Grafton Street, as I mentioned in the introduction, it is surrounded by lots of small side streets with shops, bars, and cafes on them. You really can't get a better location for any hotel in the world I would reckon. The only downside of that is getting to it by car if you are unfamiliar with all the narrow side streets, which is where the Google Navigation came in handy! Also note you can get the LUAS, which is the tram-system in Dublin, also from both St. Stephen's Green, and College Green, which will take you anywhere. You can also walk over the River Liffey to O'Connell Street easily from here - it's about a 15-20 minute walk - shorter if you are a fast walker.
There is also a taxi-rank rank outside the hotel on the opposite side to Grafton Street, which was very handy for me to get a taxi to Dublin Airport, which is where I was headed that day.

Service: We only really interacted with the reception staff, restaurant staff, and concierge/porters while we were in the hotel. All were very friendly and helpful - no faults at all. Especially the concierge/porter staff - I think they personify that age old expression in Ireland of 1000 welcomes! Just great staff.

Overall: Having stayed in other luxury Dublin hotels including the Shelbourne, and the Merrion, as nice as they are, it is really the location of the Westbury that makes it our 1st choice hotel in Dublin. A terrific stay, was delighted to return there after all these years and see that it's as great as it always was - better actually. I'm looking for an excuse to take me to Dublin for longer and so I can have a longer stay there. Easily recommended.",5,2019,01,06
203,Location and Charm,"This hotel is located right in the centre of Dublin in one of the laneways off Grafton Street. It is a few minutes walk from Trinity College, Dublin Castle, St Stephens Green and other attractions. The city has a pleasant low key charm and the hotel is right in the centre with many great quality restaurants and atmospheric pubs to choose from for meals. The hotel is quite lovely, it has a beautiful public area and also many choices for food and drinks. Our room was large and very comfortable and we had water, fruit and chocolates provided. I particularly liked the crystal glasses supplied for drinks -such a nice touch.  The staff were friendly and helpful, particularly the desk staff and concierge. We felt their  friendliness and wamth was quite natural. This hotel has a lovely old world charm but has been renovated and the hotel is kept in beautiful condition. If we returned to Dublin I would definitely stay again.",5,2019,01,06
203,excellence,"fantastic location, fantastic experience.pleasant and helpful staff.lovely room, great linen, clean bathroom, very festive atmosphere.lovely dinner in Balfes - superb steak.great service at breakfast",5,2019,01,06
203,First Class Customer Service!,"Even though I've reviewed this hotel from a lovely previous visit I had to compliment them once again. We had booked 2 regular rooms for 1 night before our flight back to the USA. As our rooms were not ready (we arrived a little earlier than check-in) we decided to have a cocktail in their fabulous Sidecar bar and wait. When my husband went to check on their progress they were still some issues with them and we would have to wait a little longer.

As we sat in the bar the Assistant Guest Relations Manager, Jack Fitzsimons joined us, apologized that they were still not ready, picked up our bar tab for all our cocktails and then upgraded us to a suite with a connecting room for our son! 

When we arrived in our fabulous suite a bottle of bubbly was chilling in an ice bucket! We felt totally spoilt and really appreciated the excellent care given to us....this is why we love, love, love the Westbury and can't wait to come back! :-)",5,2019,01,05
203,Probably the most central hotel in Dublin City,"Very centrally located.  Large and sometimes rather impersonal hotel.  

Some parts of the operation deserves it's 5* rating, but not all.   

Reception/Concierge staff are fantastic, friendly and helpful.  

Breakfast on both days was interesting to watch, as overworked staff tried to manage the breakfast restaurant and were sometimes overwhelmed and forgot things.   We watched as stressed out visitors seethed over missing milk and toast.   

The room was very well appointed and clean.   Everything you need for a comfortable stay.  There was a bizarre incident with a soiled facecloth which only Sherlock Holmes will ever solve because neither we or housekeeping could.  However the Housekeeping supervisor was very attentive in the circumstances. 

On both nights that we stayed there (weekend) we could not get a seat in the lounge as it was full with walk-ins.   I've no problem with that, but there should be an overflow area reserved for residents.   We did not like the bar, dark, with unfriendly, and very  rude barstaff.  The couple at the next table who were loudly effing and blinding were ignored by floor staff.   It was really awkward and slightly threatening.  Certainly not a 5 star bar.   It was an experience, but there are better 5 stars in Dublin City.   Location is their trump card here and they need never fear empty rooms as long as the Westbury is right on Grafton Street!",4,2019,01,05
203,5* Hotel and 5* Location,"I am a regular guest in The Westbury Hotel , Since I am new to TripAdvisor I think it‚Äôs fitting I leave a review of a place I stay at regularly. 

First impression of the hotel is wow because from the moment you pull up outside the front door of the hotel the service is second to none. The checking in process can be a bit slow at busy times but as soon as you get to your room it is all worth it. After checking in we were escorted up to our room by a very well presented and mannerly member of staff. The rooms are very spacious and the beds are probably the best I have slept in. 

Once we were settled in we decided to head out and do some shopping which is why I consider the location 5* because once you step outside the front door of the hotel you are literally on Grafton Street. 

When we returned after shopping a member of staff offered to take the bags to our car which I found fantastic as we didn‚Äôt need them in the room. 

That night we were unsure what we would do for dinner and after looking online at  different restaurants in the area we decided to stay in and order room service. As with most hotels you would expect that the room service wouldn‚Äôt be as good as going into a restaurant but this was different , not only was it the best room service I have ever received it was also one of the best meals period.

The only negative have about the hotel is the quality of the breakfast is only average but everything else from checking in and throughout the stay , the quality of service was top class the hotel is always spotless and any request no matter how big or small was never an issue.",5,2019,01,03
203,5 Stars and Can Walk to Most Dublin Attractions!,"We were able to walk to the North Side Writer's Museum, fantastic Temple Bar restaurants, local pubs and seafood restaurants, Trinity College, the Dublin Castle and many more!  Exceptional comfort and luxury in the heart of Dublin.",5,2019,01,03
203,Great location,"The Hotel location is great and looks majestic from the outside,. Gym small, no pool and absolutely nothing for children entertainment. My checkout experience was terrible and my bags were literally left on the pavement. Did not get the early checkin I requested and my room had an alley view and next to the lifts. ",3,2019,01,02
203,Perfect for pre Christmas Dublin visit,"This was our third visit to the Westbury we like to visit Dublin  before Christmas and stay overnight ,the Westbury is the ideal place for us.Good value ,good service and a good nights sleep.We would recommend this hotel to couples who want to treat themselves before Christmas.",5,2019,01,02
203,Christmas 2018 at Westbury Dublin,This was our 22nd year to visit the Westbury at Christmas and as always we had a brilliant time and all the staff are so friendly. After so long we know all the stall so well and it feels like a home away from home for us. Cant wait until we go back again. We are treated like part of the hotel whicj is wonderfull and thank you very much once again ,5,2019,01,02
203,Fabulous,"For a celebration with friends of old the Westbury is perfect. Staff are excellent, the ambience is amazing and especially at Christmas time it was just perfect. The good and drink was promptly served. A little expensive perhaps but we knew and expected it.",5,2018,12,31
203,Not  the best hotel in Dublin !!,"We stayed in hotel early December my husband and two daughters.

The girls were excited to stay at the hotel and had afternoon  tea which was very good. Not great value for the money. Much more expensive than London or Paris.

Firstly the rooms we were allocated were opposite the lifts,. I asked to move the rooms away from the lifts, they allocated us rooms on another floor.

The Rooms were tired with stained carpets, the TV must have been at least 10 years old. No WiFi in the rooms only worked in the public areas.

The staff were nice and helpful, we usually stay at The Conrad which is a much better standard hotel.

The stay for 2 nights is more expensive than a 5 star
Hotel in Mayfair.",3,2018,12,30
203,Lovely stay ,We had a lovely night away at the Westbury. Staff very friendly and attentive. Valet parking (25 euro for one night). It‚Äôs worth it. Room lovely and modern. Balfes cafe and bar downstairs is really nice. One major flaw is the breakfast. We got our breakfast sent to our room. Not worth the money. Was expecting it to be a lot nicer for the price. Better off going somewhere near by for breakfast. Other than that there was no other bad comments. It‚Äôs a perfect location for a night away in Dublin. ,4,2018,12,30
203,Afternoon tea,"Me and my friends had a lovely time in Westbury when we went in for afternoon tea after Christmas shopping. The food and drinks was absolutely amazing and the staff was exceptionally friendly, I've never had a better experience! Girl who looked after us (her name was Ieva) was lovely and so helpful, great at her job. 5 stars all the way, if I could give more, I would! Definitely visiting Westbury again, no doubt. Even if its just for a quick drink to brighten up the day with that lovely atmosphere staff deliver so effortlessly. Just perfect",5,2018,12,30
203,Ann,"I stay once a year in westbury ( Christmas gift from my son)
From the minute I go thru the revolving doors I feel special
The welcome at reception 
The room ( four poster bed)
The pillows.  Oh yes the pillows 
Every single member of the staff 
I can honestly say to anyone visiting Dublin stay at the westbury.  U will keep coming back
So central. U can shop till u drop and go bac home aka the westbury ( home for one night) and meet friends in the bar to top off ones visit",5,2018,12,29
203,Poorly sound-proof but with fantastic staff.,"First things first, the staff overall were really nice and helpful in everything. So nice and kind that it nearly breaks my heart to give an overall negative feedback. The amenities in the room are nice and the location is simply perfect. The cleaning crew does an excellent job, it is spotless clean. The beds are very comfortable as well. 

Will i visit again? No. The building itself is simply too old. You hear normal talking in the room next door. When at 530 the neighbours awake you will hear it. The heater in the room is a standalone one which is noisy as well, letting it run throughout the night is no option. So simply bring your earplugs if you want to stay here. 

Breakfast we have found is a bit simple for a place this expensive. Talking >300‚Ç¨

The gym, well the hotel probably needed to have some machines in a room to be able to keep-up a rating because that‚Äôs all it is useful for. 

Conclusion: Be greated by a fantastic staff but don‚Äôt forget earplugs (or sleeping pills..better both)

",3,2018,12,29
203,Glorious Christmas at the Westbury,"Perfect location, wonderful staff- always helpful, friendly and professional. They anticipate your every need. Rooms are tastefully decorated. Love the Nespresso machine in the rooms. Love the crystal glassware in the rooms. ",5,2018,12,21
203,Beautiful grand hotel in a great location,"The Westbury is a beautiful old hotel, which has retained it's style and glamour from a bygone era. 

The location is fabulous for accessing the cities fantastic restaurants, shops and historic sights. And the hotel is stylish and comfortable, whilst retaining its original style, including leather benches in the lifts. 

The service is quite impeccable, with the concierge providing great advice on where to get a last minute blow dry and manicure late on a Sunday afternoon. 

The rooms are well appointed, and of a good size. I found the bed very comfortable also. 

I had room service one evening and it was great food. 

I would find it very hard to find fault with this gorgeous hotel.",5,2018,12,19
203,Top class hotel - you MUST stay here,"My favourite hotel in Dublin for so many reasons :-) Service, quality of everything, eye to detail and always fabulous staff. Location is fantastic, rooms are very nice, bed is really comfortable and big  - and everything always immaculate. I'm a fussy eater and they always accommodate me. ",5,2018,12,19
203,very nice hotel and staff,We stayed at the Westbury for 2 nights in September. The hotel was very nice and the concierge was very friendly and helpful. The hotel was right downtown and close to everything. The food at hotel was good but a little expensive.,4,2018,12,16
203,"Great location, the sidecar bar is fantastic","Just back from a short visit to Dublin with my partner, we stumbled upon this hotel just off Grafton Street and what a great find. 
The hotel looks amazing and upon arrival the staff where very friendly, we had been shopping all day so we thought we had deserved a few refreshments. The sidecar bar is fabulous , we were unsure of what cocktails to order so Adrian a member of staff suggested a few very tasty cocktails, the service and hospitality the hotel and the barman Adrian showed us was fantastic. 
We will definitely be back ",5,2018,12,16
203,The Westbury in Dublin,Beautiful hotel with a great location.  5 stars all the way- from staff to dining to cocktails to room.  The common areas were beautifully decorated for the Holidays.  Wonderful warm feeling throughout the entire hotel.,5,2018,12,15
203,Perfection in the very best location,"Whenever we visit Dublin, this is where we would go. A real treat. Flawless. Was there on monday and the place was absolutely buzzing. What a wonderful christmas atmosphere. Problem is it's hard to leave the premises to go out in town, so tempting to stay put. Fantastic cocktails, nice bar snack menu (I had wonderful oysters). Food for lunch in Balfes is great. Service is top notch from start to finish. We also got lucky and were upgraded to a suite. With so many fabulous restaurants and bars within 5 min walk, it's just heaven!! Cant wait to return!",5,2018,12,13
203,A very pleasant stay,"We stayed at the Westbury for four days and were very pleased with our stay. The location is great and the hotel was nicely decorated for Christmas. 
Our room was large and very comfortable (despite some kind of ventilation noise). 
Breakfast is great and the Wilde is a charming setting. 
Just one point to improve was that when we arrived by taxi (back of the hotel), nobody was here to greet us and take our luggages. 
Overall, a great stay",5,2018,12,13
203,Afternoon Tea,"Went for afternoon tea here with my mum and sister. It was absolutely fabulous! Samuel from the gallery looked after us so well, we couldn't fault the service at all. We really loved the turkey and cranberry sandwich it was delicious! Would definitely recommend to a friend.",5,2018,12,13
203,Trip for the family,"Stayed here with my parents in October for rugby. We had a really great time for our first time in Ireland. Aine was really helpful on the front desk and helped us from check in to check out. The meal we had in Wilde restaurant was fabulous also, unfortunately I can‚Äôt remember our waiters name but gave us his undivided attention throughout. Would highly recommend to a friend and we will defiantly be back!! ",5,2018,12,12
203,Afternoon tea,"My daughter, and I had afternoon tea here last Friday, we had my little granddaughter with us, the food was lovely and there was a great selection to choose from both food and drinks,the staff were friendly efficient and very helpful and the ambience makes it a really special experience, this has become a Christmas tradition for my daughter and I and we hope to continue with it in this beautiful hotel.",5,2018,12,12
203,Felt like Kevin McCallister at the Plaza! ,"The Westbury was a pleasant surprise when we pulled up to the hotel. I felt like Kevin McCallister when he arrived eyes wide open at the Plaza Hotel in NYC in the Home Alone 2 movie. There was staff to greet us and a big Christmas tree front and center. The Westbury is an elegant hotel with an old-fashioned touch. The rooms are comfortable and cozy. But the bed! Oh, the bed! Laying on the queen sized bed was like when Ariel from the Little Mermaid joyously fell into the bed and pillows at Prince Eric‚Äôs Castle.  I slept like I didn't have kids (which I don't, so it was good sleep). Needless to say, I enjoyed the Westbury so much I'm comparing it to some of my favorite movies. Also, the breakfast was delicious and the location was perfect; right next to all the shopping and pubs. Enjoy your stay! ",4,2018,12,12
203,Perfect location,"Seconds from Grafton Street.  We had a lovely room, very large by European standards.  Always enjoyed our breakfast.  Lobby lounge is delightful after a busy day for a light meal and glass of wine.  The staff is exceptional.",5,2018,12,11
203,Outstanding property superior to all others in time - service first class,"The Irish know how to do a warm welcome, and we have stayed in many hotels across this fantastic city.  However for a busy rugby weekend we thought we would treat ourselves to two nights here.

We booked long in advance so the price was not eye-watering, and felt so welcome from the moment we walked in.  Dublin is beautiful when it puts on its festive jumper and The Westbury is no exception. 

We met a lady on the plane on the way over who lives part of the time in Dublin and she forewarned us how great the service is at this hotel.  She was not wrong.

The room was very comfortable and well looked after by housekeeping although a little in need of some redecs.  Apparently much of the hotel has already been done so we were perhaps unlucky.  The bed very comfy and the pre check in had made sure I was on a room nice and high up - just  as well as Ireland beat New Zealand in the rugby that day and it was pretty raucous in town that night.  But on the 5th floor it didn't disturb us.   The room toiletries were a slight let down - have certainly seen them in much lower rated hotels.

The breakfast is quite excellent and served in a beautiful room, Wildes. The Sidecar bar is great fun and does a mean Amaretto Sour.  

Finally the post check out survey - I completed this (predominantly glowing) and received an email within 10 mins personally addressing the comments I had made.  Another example of the great service experienced.

Don't think I can bear to stay anywhere else now when in Dublin,",5,2018,12,10
203,Business Trip,"The Westbury is well situated close to Grafton Street shopping, St Stephens Green and Trinity College. The rooms are traditionally decorated and comfortable. Breakfasts were excellent too. Service was very good; professional and friendly. ",4,2018,12,06
203,Fantastic,"Absolutely fabulous hotel. Well worth a visit. From start to finish nothing was a bother. Staff are all so friendly and go above and beyond  the call of duty. A special mention to Isabella on reception, Courtney, Cameron, Rems and Kiera in the gallery who were fantastic. Highly recommend a visit üëå",5,2018,12,03
203,The Sidecar Bar at the Westbury is a 'Must Visit' place,"Just back from a visit to Dublin, meeting up with friends at the Sidecar Bar for drinks. The bar has been upgraded from the last time we were there and what an improvement. It is now a must place to visit in Dublin. We were greeted by a member of the staff (Stephie or Stephanie??) who looked after our group all evening...a great asset. The range of drinks was excellent if a bit pricey but you have to experience the cocktails and the theatre of the place, real 1920s. We will definitely be back there on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2018,12,02
203,Exceeded our expectations.,"My Daughter and I have just returned from a 3-day break in the Westbury which is just off Grafton Street and is central for either sightseeing or shopping.  

We were given a very warm welcome on our arrival by concierge and at check-in.  Our luggage was stored until our room was ready.   We went out shopping and returned later for Festive afternoon tea served in The Gallery.   This was an amazing unforgettable experience.  We were allocated a window table and offered a glass of mulled wine as soon as we were seated.

The quality, quantity and selection of food was of a very high standard - both savoury and sweet.   My daughter was presented with a delicious Birthday dessert to mark the occasion!    This was very much appreciated, thank you.   We had dinner in Balfe‚Äôs which again was of a very high standard.   It is advisable to book in advance.

Our room was a classic twin which was spotless, looking out towards the back and we had a very peaceful night‚Äôs sleep.  Very comfortable bed, nice toiletries and complimentary tea and coffee provided.

Breakfast buffet was excellent with much choice and many staff to assist.  Hot food was made to order.

Taxis are plentiful but because of the heavy traffic we chose to walk to the train station for our departure.   

We can highly recommend this hotel and would not consider staying anywhere else on our next Dublin city break.",5,2018,12,02
203,Fabulous Afternoon Tea,We went to the Westbury for Christmas afternoon tea. From the moment we entered the hotel we were met with a warm welcome and 5 star service. Our server Freya was a pleasure and so helpful. The food was delicious and the wide selection of teas and coffee were lovely. The food combined with the festive ambiance made the afternnon a wonderful Christmas treat. I would highly recommend the Westbury afternoon tea. We will definitely do it again.,5,2018,12,01
203,10/10 Recommend,"My mom and I went to the Westbury for afternoon tea during her stay in Ireland. To say she loved the experience is an understatement. Samuel was our server and he was beyond lovely, making sure we were okay on food, tea and coffee throughout the two hours. That being said, the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. 

The sandwiches, scones and desserts were to die for! I would highly recommend afternoon tea in the Westbury to anyone and everyone who is thinking about having it while in Dublin!!! Thanks to everyone at the Westbury for making this a memorable experience for myself and my mom - we will most definitely be making this an annual tradition and coming back! ",5,2018,12,01
203,The best hotel in Dublin ,"Was on a short trip to Dublin

203,Excellent experience from start to finish!,"A group of us went for afternoon tea last Saturday to celebrate my sister‚Äôs birthday. I had heard great things about the service and it completely outdid my already high expectations. We were apprehensive at first, as it isn‚Äôt the cheapest option, but it was worth every cent. The food was so tasty and so fresh. The decor and the atmosphere were both absolutely divine. The staff went above and beyond to enhance the customer experience, despite being rushed off their feet. They even kindly packed up any leftovers for us to enjoy at home. (Not that there were a lot!) I would like to give a special mention to a lovely young girl Courtney. She couldn‚Äôt do enough for our table and I didn‚Äôt see the smile leave her face. Well done to the Westbury! Will be back in the very near future. 10/10.",5,2018,11,29
203,"Great city, great hotel. ","There are many wonderful hotels in the superb city of Dublin but I always choose The Westbury for business or family visits.

Impeccable service but always friendly. The rooms are very thoughtful in their detail in that you have everything you need, where you need it. 

Two things lift The Westbury above the others.

Firstly the location, quiet but oh so central. Out the front door for Grafton Street, St Stephens Green (and McDaids), out the back door for Powerscourt Centre, lanes, restaurants and individual shops. 

Secondly, the Gallery. Could sit there all day & all night and watch the world go by. They have got this space absolutely spot on.

One of my favourite hotels. Particy",5,2018,11,29
203,Best hotel in Dublin!,Fantastic stay at The Westbury!  Elegant hotel; true luxury ! Our family felt so welcomed and relaxed at this gorgeous hotel. Wwe gathered for a family holiday to celebrate 30 years of marriage; the Westbury staff went above and beyond our expectations to help us celebrate this very special time in our lives.  We can't wait to go back!,5,2018,11,28
203,Ecaterina,"We visited The Westbury on several occasions recently as a family to celebrate special events. We took our 9 day old with us to enjoy afternoon tea and all staff were fabulous but we wanted to give a special mention to Ecaterina who made us feel so at home and was so friendly to us and our family. Her warmth was so genuine and it‚Äôs because of staff members like Ecaterina that we would return again and again. We are usually fans of The Shelbourne Hotel but I have to admit the atmosphere and staff in The Westbury on our recent visits have completely converted us and we‚Äôve found our new favourite hotel. 

Thank you Ecaterina for going the extra mile, for your kindness and your genuine warmth, you made our visits so pleasant.",5,2018,11,27
203,Once again,"Back again for a lovely weekend. Taxi pulls up at hotel, helpful staff get cases in. Check in with charming front desk.

Went to the Wilde restaurant again and food excellent. Finished off with a few drinks in the bar and spoke to Flori. Full of charm and intelligence. Breakfast with pancakes. We always book a matinee at the Gaiety theatre just round the corner. For a weekend break the Westbury is hard to beat. The only downside is having to check out.",5,2018,11,27
203,Outstanding,"Where do I start ? From arrival to departure everything was absolutely amazing, well appointed room, great location but above all the staff make the experience special, there are too many to mention but I will name John, Eddie, Sophie and Stephania in Wilde. All willing to go the extra mile to ensure the guests are looked after.
From start to finish it was great. Thank you all, well done to management for having such a great team ",5,2018,11,26
203,Afternoon Tea at The Westbury Hotel,"Afternoon Tea at the Westbury is a truly sublime experience and was the highlight of our day trip to Dublin. The service was impeccable and our waiter Samuel was outstanding! We were a tricky table of 4 with an almost vegan and a couple of nut allergies but Samuel took it all in and we were presented with perfection on a plate and all delivered with such charm. The tea was a birthday treat for my son and my goddaughter who is currently studying at Trinity College and she returned to her Halls of Residence with the most beautiful box of all the items we could not manage to eat. I have already recommended the Westbury to friends visiting Dublin but I would encourage anyone planning a trip to Dublin to go there. A big thank you to Samuel for his humour, help and kindness I hope the Westbury realise what a gem they have in him!",5,2018,11,20
203,Christmas Afternoon Tea,"We would like to thank the members of ""The Gallery Team"" in the Westbury Hotel who served us a wonderful Afternoon Tea experience today. A special thanks to our server Camille for the warm and welcoming service.You made it a very special birthday celebration.
Many thanks.

203,"Posh, racist and out of touch","This hotel caters to the upper crust of Irish and international patrons.  The staff overall is pleasant enough, but they will not extend above and beyond service.  When we arrived, there was no bellman to help with our bags and when we passed by staff they did not offer assistance.  While we were checking in I saw that one Arab woman who just flew in was told that her room was not ready and she needed to wait.  When there was an Irish woman who was checking in was also told her room was not ready, the Manager came out and offered her tea and cookies while she waited.

The rooms themselves are underwhelming.  While clean, they are dated and small.  The showers have very poor water pressure.  You might as well be staying at any Westin or Marriott.  

One last comment was that my wife and I went out on Saturday night.  Upon entering the lobby, they had security that asked for our room number.  Security is a great idea in Dublin; however, we gave the wrong room number and didn't remember the room number.   Security initially laughed at us after I showed him a key to our room and said that I could have picked it up on the street.  I asked him to use his radio to call to the front desk to determine if we were actual guests and said he wouldn't do that.  We just went to the front desk and the head of security challenged us that we were actual guests.  After some back and forth, they looked us up by name and validated we were guests.  If this really was a 5 star hotel, they could have found a much more diplomatic way to validate us.  

I could never recommend this hotel to anyone and would actually encourage people not to spend money here.  They are classist, they think they are extremely posh and they lack decent service.  If you like that in a hotel, then please stay there.  For a country that is extremely friendly and has wonderful people, this hotel might have well been from another country and another time.",1,2018,11,19
203,Unique ecperience,"We had our first afternoon tea at the Westbury and  it was excellent. The service exquisite, attentive, And especially Klayton was so helpful that made it an experience we want to repeat. We were very impressed by the professionalism of the gallery team.",4,2018,11,18
203,The Gallery Team,What a great place!  We were looked after by Joshua who did a great job.  Place to recommend and we'll be back when we next visit Dublin. The quality of the food and personal attention were outstanding.,5,2018,11,17

Highly recommend to all of the afternoon teas in city centre.
Better than the Shelbourne nice ambience and experience.
Waitress served us Fraya 5 stars",5,2018,11,16
203,Customer Care awful,A five star hotel with zero customer service.   What was intended to be a nice gift was a most unpleasant experience for the recipients and myself due to the total incompetence and unprofessionalism of the management of the Westbury.,1,2018,11,15
203,Luxury stay,"This five star hotel was an easy walk to tour buses, pubs and shopping. Beautifully decorated with lavish furnishings. Top notch staff made the stay pleasurable. Highly recommend.Turn down service with a chocolate on my pillow was a nice touch.",5,2018,11,13
203,Great hotel!,"We visited on holiday from the USA for three nights.  This hotel is very nice and I cannot imagine a better location right off Grafton Street.  Late one evening we were in Balfes bar/restaurant, wanted to eat and the kitchen was closed, and our bartender cothin ran our order to room service for us while we finished our drinks.  This was great service and we were very appreciative.  All of the staff was very pleasant and everything was clean and well maintained.",5,2018,11,13
203,Wonderful Wonderful Westbury!,"I stayed in the Westbury last Saturday the 10th of November to celebrate my Wifes birthday. I have stayed in almost all of the 5 star hotels in Dublin and the Westbury tops them all! Their staff are second to none and are the hotel's greatest asset. I would like to give special thanks to Laura Fontana the reservations manager for making our stay so special...rose petal turn down, complementary treats on arrival and so attentive and knowledgeable during the booking process. We ate in the Hotels restaurant 'Wilde' amazing setting, wine and the food stunning! And what can i say about the lobby, there is no better place in Dublin to sit back sipping on a drink and watch the world go buy. We had a wonderful time and highly recommend the hotel to anyone looking for wonderful hotel experiance.

203,Graduation Treat,"On Saturday last,  and to celebrate our daughter‚Äôs graduation,  we treated ourselves to lunch at the Westbury Hotel. From the moment we arrived we were provided with an excellent service from very courteous staff. Like the service the food was also top class and delicious.

We were served by Kleyton who really added to the experience. He has a fantastic personality, and was extremely efficient. He is a fantastic Ambassador for the hotel.

We would highly recommend your hotel for this experience and we will return ourselves again in the near future.",5,2018,11,12
203,dated,"Great Hotel , but that was 20 years agovery dated interior in hotel and room , lots of pre 2000 brass and marble  , must have been amazing 20 years ago but now it just old ,Rooms are smal , badly painted and have stained carpetLight system in the room is impossible to figure outDoes not justify the price by far",2,2018,11,12
203,Coffee morning,"After attending the 11/11 memorial we looked for a place suitable for 6 adults and 2 children plus push chairs where we would be able to sit, relax and enjoy the experience . The hotel did it superbly. Comfortable settees/ chairs, plenty of space between us and other customers, excellent service and great coffee and scones . Young children were no problem and a little mess created by a two year old and a croissant was vacuumed up with a smile and no problem attitude . It is a gem of 5 star luxury and calm in the midst of a busy city .",5,2018,11,12
203,A very fine hotel,"Overall, the Westbury is a fine choice if you need to stay in central Dublin.

The location is phenomenal. Right off of Grafton Street. Couldn't be more convenient. The service is exemplary. The staff will always go out of their way to accommodate your needs. The lobby and bar are beautiful, and the maintenance is excellent.

On the minus side, prices are high and the rooms are on the smallish side. Likewise the bathroom was very small, with limited counter space. Rooms in the back can be a bit noisy if you want to keep the window open.

Breakfast is worth the cost. A beautiful spread in a very pleasant environment. Room prices on their website usually include breakfast, and can be a bargain.

The Westbury is a good place to splurge.",5,2018,11,11
203,Excellent standard and service,"The Westbury hotel in Dublin is ideally located in the best part of the city with easy access to all that one wishes to do and see. The staff make you feel very much at ease with their pleasant welcoming.
Excellent service and extremely friendly staff at all times of the day and night",5,2018,11,11
203,"Great location, beautiful hotel","We stayed here for 4 nights recently.  The hotel is in a great area.  Close to many restaurants, pubs, cafes, and shopping. The hotel is always bustling.  There are many options for dining and drinks within the hotel itself.  The breakfast, which was included in our rate, was probably the best breakfast we‚Äôve ever had at a hotel.  A really nice way to start your day. The staff here, too, are top notch.  We had a glitch at the earlier part of our stay and it was handled straight away.  
We stayed in one of the refurbished classic king rooms.  The changes are minor, but the new chairs, bedding, and headboard were very nice and gave the room a more updated appearance. The room was very clean and a decent size considering you‚Äôre in a major European city.  My reason for the 4 stars is the bathroom.  Very tiny and a bit outdated, which isn‚Äôt even my major grievance, but more so the tub/shower combo.  Just a nightmare to get in and out of, especially for my husband who is very tall.  And the tub itself is tiny. I inquired about a room with a walk in shower, but we would have had to upgrade to a luxury suite for another almost $200 a night.  But overall, the hotel is really beautiful and I‚Äôd venture to say one of your best options in Dublin. ",4,2018,11,11
203,Fantastic ,"I went to the Westbury Dublin on Thursday night to use the Business Centre.
The lady there was ever so helpful,

Thank you very much for all your help.

203,"Dated, Overpriced  and Untrustworthy!","Stayed at the Westbury with my family of 4  at the end of October 2018 for two nights.  Based on the price we paid for the room ( 2 double),  I had higher expectations regarding the appointment of the room.  Good size room but was very disappointed with the state of the carpets and especially the bathroom.  Mattress was very uncomfortable  and bathroom tiles looked dirty, with dark mold in grout lines.  It looked like it had been fixed several few times with bad caulking hiding cracks in tiles.  
However my disappointing review is not so much based on the state of the room but what happened after checkout.   I mistakenly left some new clothes that I bought in Dublin in the closet of our hotel room.  I called the hotel immediately that very same morning to report the items hoping that the items could be sent to me.  Unfortunately all items have gone missing.  We checked out at 6:30 am and I called the hotel at 11 am. By then the items had already been taken.  The hotel manager went personally to check but there was nothing there.  Obviously since it was only my family and the hotel staff who had access between those times, my only conclusion is that the items were taken by the hotel staff.   I sent an email to customer relations advising them of the situation, but i have had no response.   My expectations at the least would have been an apology.  This was a very disappointing  experience with The Westbury which they handled very poorly.  Needless to say, I will never stay with them again.",1,2018,11,09
203,Fantastic experience,"We booked the Westbury for our wedding anniversary and I have to say it was a fantastic experience. From the moment we arrived the staff couldn't be more helpful, parking the car, taking the bags and booking in at the reception was a pleasure. The room couldn't be faulted, everything that you would expect and more. Breakfast in the morning was an experience, fantastic staff, nothing was a problem and service with a smile. Our weekend was perfect, many thanks to all the staff and management teams for making it so. We hope to be back soon.",5,2018,11,07
203,Classy AND friendly all at the same time!,"World-class property in fabulous location for Dublin south side - but friendly personal service by every single hotel employee with whom we came into contact from front desk and concierges to doormen, restaurant staff and housekeeping!!

203,Five Star Service,We cannot fault the Westbury following a recent one night stay.  The staff went out of their way to assist and the facilities as one would expect are excellent.   The biggest surprise was Wilde's restaurant.   We would normally bypass hotel restaurants as there is so much choice outside but the meal we enjoyed there was excellent.    We will definitely be back and appreciate the service received.,5,2018,11,06
203,Understated Perfection ,"So wonderful to return to this bastion of perfection in central Dublin. Each moment of our visit was total elegance and a complete dedication to perfection.

203,short weekend,The staff at the hotel were very attentive and friendly.the food at the hotel was very good and plenty of it.the hotel is very dated and in need of a facelift in the bedroom and seating area.parking was expensive and should be included ias the 1 night stay cost 320 euro for bed and breakfeast for two.,3,2018,11,05
203,Dead Rabbit Experience and over night stay,"Fantastic night at the Westbury ! We attended the Dead Rabbit Experience and it was a great night the cocktails were amazing and the staff were great fun and really knew their stuff.. 
We always have a great time here its so central and the breakfast is wonderful.",5,2018,11,05
203,Excellent location,"This hotel is in a great location beside great shops, restaurants and bars. One of my favourite things was when I pulled up outside the hotel I didn't have to worry about parking, I was able to just pull up outside the entrance door and my car and luggage were taken care of. Afternoon tea was delicious. Even though the hotel is in Dublin city center, the room was very quiet. No noise heard at all, which was great :-) The only downside was that we had to wait about 25 minutes to get a table for breakfast. There were 4 of us and it looked like there weren't many tables for 4. Groups of 2 were being seated almost immediately, so in the end we separated into 2 groups of 2 so we could get seated quicker at a table for 2. If we hadn't split into 2 groups I've no idea how much longer we'd have been waiting for a table for 4 people. ",4,2018,11,05
203,Fantastic Hotel,"Went to Dublin to celebrate my birthday with a group of friends and stayed at The Westbury 

This hotel not only has a fantastic location but the staff are amazing, the food is wonderful and the rooms are top quality 

It‚Äôs a little expensive but worth every penny if you want to experience old school luxury and care",5,2018,11,05
203,Opulence is an understatement,"We received the most gracious reception upon arrival.  While we couldn't check in until 3pm, concierge took our bags and tagged them.  Concierge took our phone number so we could occupy our time having a relaxing alcoholic beverage.  Precisely at 3pm our phone rang.  We received our room.  Concierge brought our bags.  The only ""small"" complaint we have is the wardrobe is small and there aren't any drawers other than the night stands to place clothing.  Very clean room and the bathroom sparkled.  We used concierge for booking tours, shipping a package, getting transportation for odd times, and postage.  The concierge team is fantastic.  They never missed a beat and we never had to lift a finger.  Truly 5 star service.  We used the laundry service.  We thought this service was expensive until we found everything returned.  Shirts, (including t-shirts) were folded with cardboard (uniformity) and collar inserts over top button, just like a dry cleaner with request to have clothing set up for travel.  Located on Grafton, close proximity to pubs/taverns, shopping, restaurants.  Continental breakfast, fantastic with a great spread of cheeses, meats, whole grains, fruit, breads, sweet breads, yogurt.  Included, you can order items from menu, eggs, bacon, etc.  The staff for breakfast; top of the line.  We found all staff members no matter which department, very friendly as well as knowing how to make their guest feel like we are the only customer.  We highly recommend the Westbury and we would definitely return ourselves.",5,2018,11,04
203,Afternoon tea,"We had a very pleasant experience at the Westbury for afternoon tea and were served by extremely helpful staff. They were extremely attentive especially our waitress for the day Marta T.
Would definitely return.",5,2018,11,04
203,Excellent Location and Service ,"The Westbury is located in the center of Dublin, right down the block from Grafton Street. It is also within easy walking distance of all of the major sites in Dublin- Trinity College, St. Stephen‚Äôs Green, Merrion Square and The National Gallery. There are literally hundreds of restaurants and pubs within ten minutes of the hotel. The location is superb.

So too the service at the hotel was excellent. From the valet to reception, room service staff, the concierge, and the wait staff at breakfast, to a person, everyone at The Westbury was charming, informative and kind. Fabulous service.

Our breakfast was included with our room and it was excellent. A wonderful selection of cold items- pastries, fresh fruit, yoghurt- were available. In addition to the cold selection, the breakfast offered a lovely selection of hot dishes including pancakes,  eggs Benedict, a full Irish breakfast and additional hot dishes were available. Juices and tea snd coffee as well were offered. 

While we did not eat dinner in either of the hotel‚Äôs restaurants, we did have a lovely afternoon tea. The assortment of sweet and savory offerings was lovely.

My only complaint about the Westbury, and the reason it only received four stars as opposed to five, was the room. Our room was on the sixth floor and a very generous size. The room was very quiet. We looked out over Dublin. However the room itself is a bit dated, the rug could be replaced and the furniture and bathroom needed an update. And, most unfortunately, the bed was quite hard. As a bed is crucial to a hotel‚Äôs prime directive- a good nights sleep- this was a blow to the Westbury‚Äôs ranking in my mind. I also found the exterior facade of the hotel a bit off putting- it is quite blocky and looks like a throwback to the 1980‚Äôs. The exterior as well as the room decor need to be pulled into the 21st century.

With those two caveats-exterior and room decor- The Westbury provides a perfect location and wonderful service the heart of Dublin. ",4,2018,11,03
203,Unparalelled in every way!,"The Westbury Hotel is not only located close to everything but offers incredible service and spacious, comfortable rooms.  The staff (at all levels) go out of their way to ensure your experience is 5 star!!  I consider it my home in Dublin!",5,2018,11,03
203,Afternoon Tea at the Gallery,"I‚Äôve been to the Gallery twice now for afternoon Tea. The first time was for my wedding anniversary. The second time was for my birthday. Both times the food was delicious as well as the tea. When we went for my birthday one of the ladies that works there, Maria T was a wonderful hostess. She made sure we had everything we need. The service overall was great. Would highly recommend this place.",5,2018,11,02
203,Amazing Hotel ,"Absolutely amazing hotel, great rooms that were clean, modern and accommodating.  The Wilde restaurant downstairs was great and the food was incredible.  Very friendly and warm staff that were very informative for tourist information and suggestions for things to see.  Even though it was only for two nights, it was such a great stay. ",5,2018,11,02
203,Central but quiet,"Very good service. Exceptional location for tourist as lots of shopping and restaurants are nearby. But it was well hidden a block away from the crowds. My room was very comfortable and quiet. Felt luxurious. Exceptional breakfast with beautiful settings, very memorable. No parking available. Taxi stand outside.",5,2018,11,02
203,A good hotel ,"I‚Äôve been there twice and I‚Äôve left with the same impression. The concierge guy Derek ( I hope I remember his name right) made our stay unforgettable from the moment we arrived. He made us feel welcomed. Has a great attitude, very polite and a great sense of humour. He knows how to make guests feeling special. This hotel has the best breakfast, everything it‚Äôs so tasty and don‚Äôt forget to try the pancakes, so delicious. We had some issues with the room which to be honest it‚Äôs not very luxurious for a 5 stars hotel but I guess you pay for the location because it‚Äôs right in the city centre and short walking distance to Brown Thomas and all the good restaurants and bars . Lunch and dinner are also amazing here , best cocktails and amazing staff everywhere in the hotel . I think if they will improve the rooms and offer like a welcome letter with a little treat will make the hotel even better and more luxurious. I have to say that Joseph the guest relations manager is the right person to talk to if you are having any issues, he is way to professional and they way he deals with a complaint made me realise that this hotel it‚Äôs worth going back because there are amazing people who will do their best to make me feel like home . Thanks Derek and Joseph , see you soon ! ",5,2018,11,02
203,Beautiful Hotel in the centre of the city,I totally enjoyed our stay here in the Westbury. For location it is fantastic and right in the heart of Grafton Street which I love. So accessible to everything. The staff in the hotel are amazing and so helpful . We have to thank the Guy who is responsible for valet parking. He was so helpful and such a lovely man. Please pass on our compliments. The only small complaint I would have is the room was lovely but nothing amazing. The bed was very comfortable but It was the bathroom that surprised me as it was very basic and also the mirrors fogged up. Most hotels have the heated mirrors now so I was very surprised. Apart from that we really enjoyed our stay in the Westbury and would come back again.,4,2018,11,01
203,Divine Night in a Divine City,"We only had one night in Dublin and couldn‚Äôt have chosen a better location. We walked to everything!

203,Trendy spot,"A mere stone's throw from Grafton Street, this Dublin institution is well worth a visit if you can get a good deal. The rooms are tiny. Afternoon tea is recommended in the open lounge area to watch people come and go. Stylish hotel but a but pricey.",4,2018,10,31
203,Afternoon tea,A group of 6 of us had afternoon tea there on Saturday. Our experience was fabulous from beginning to end. We were looked after by a lovely lady called Ecaterina and she couldn't have been more friendly or helpful. The food and drinks were delicious and there was more than enough! The whole experience was really enjoyable and I'd highly recommend it!,5,2018,10,30

203,We love the Westbury,Best hotel and location in Dublin. From our first greeting at reception by customer relations we felt at home at the Westbury. A special thanks to Aisling Dougherty who took such great care of us. Breakfast and lunch were terrific in the Wilde restaurant and room service was excellent. The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. Can‚Äôt wait to return to Dublin and stay at the Westbury.,5,2018,10,30
203,WESTBURY IS THE ONLY PLACE TO STAY IN THE CENTRE,"This is a ""class"" hotel.

203,The Gallery @ The Westbury. Dublin's best early evening food and drinks venue,"Yet another amazing evening at the Gallery in The Westbury. I can't believe I've never written a review of this place before. Service is always excellent - yesterday we were served by Kleydon - he was outstanding; a great personality, clearly enjoying the work! The seating area is comfortable and even when full offers reasonable quiet and privacy. The menu in this area is short but it appears to me to cover most needs. The food is delicious.",5,2018,10,28
203,The most disappointing 5 star hotel so far ,"It was my first visit to Dublin & I booked this hotel thru AMEX FHR program while having the confidence that this is a 5 star hotel.

I arrived around 6pm, the check in took a bit of a wait and it wasn‚Äôt very smooth either as the intern who handled it knew nothing about the FHR welcome letter & no mention of the benefits I would had during my stay. Nevertheless I was told I had been given a room upgrade and it was at the end of one corridor. 

Before I went out for dinner, I noticed the tv was having all these frizzy visuals so I informed the front desk and hoping they could fixed it while I was out. Unfortunately the technician couldn‚Äôt get it any better & upon my return from dinner the assistant guest relations manager was telling me there‚Äôs nothing they could do that evening as the hotel was very busy & there‚Äôs absolutely nothing she could do in terms of changing room. I indicated very clearly that I‚Äôm more than happy to change to other room type even it‚Äôs a downgrade with a much smaller room but she insisted the hotel was 100% full so it was rejected.

I expressed my disappointment & dissatisfaction to her and she literally told me ‚Äúyou already received a room upgrade and the rock you‚Äôre in is very big & nice‚Äù, honestly I don‚Äôt think this is sth any hotel staff should‚Äôve said to a guest under any circumstances. That was purely inconsiderate & rude, it implies that one should be content instead as a room upgrade was offered regardless of the reported issue & plus the guest never requested an upgrade to start with. 
The tv might be a small issue to some but given the rates it charges & claiming itself a 5 star hotel, for sure that wasn‚Äôt something a guest would be happy about. On a side note that evening I found a used breakfast order on my bed after turn down service so that‚Äôs not very nice. On next morning the front house manager Rory caught me after breakfast & he was kind enough to show me to another room which I could move to, we checked the tv was all fine so I agreed to move. The new room on the 6th floor was very spacious, two big windows which lead in good natural daylight.

I had daily breakfast at their restaurant during my stay, it was a full buffet with hot items which one could order from menu. The full Irish breakfast was very nicely done but their egg Benedict was rather dry, I tried their porridge which was also good. Bread selection was generous but it‚Äôd be nice if salad was provided.

The hotel is pretty old itself with more than 30 years history, it definitely needs a room renovation / revamp as it‚Äôs very worn out and it lacks the modern tech features. Wi-Fi was poor everywhere within the property, both public area & in room. Location wise it‚Äôs just perfect, right in the middle city centre, easy access to walk anywhere & St. Stephens Green is just at the doorstep.

As part of the AMEX FHR benefit I was given a free dinner at their restaurant and the food was good, though the hotel charged me on the champagne upon check out while the restaurant manager told me it‚Äôs on the house.

203,"The Westbury Grafton Street, Dublin Ireland",Jack Fitzsimons was very helpful and so was the entire staff.  The staff at the breakfast were amazing and the food was very good.  The location was very convenient and close to everything.  The room was very clean and so was the bathroom. The lobby was very nice and in the evening we would hang out with family and enjoy.  We had a great time. My husband and I would definitely go back to that hotel.  ,5,2018,10,26
203,Outstanding Hotel,One of the best hotels we have stayed at.  The service and staff are outstanding. I would highly recommend the Hotel for any traveller.  The facility and attitude are some of the best in the world. The food at the hotel is also excellent.,5,2018,10,26
203,Afternoon Tea at The Gallery in Westbury Hotel,Afternoon tea at The Westbury is such a treat and a great experience. My daughters took me there for my birthday and I really enjoyed it. We had great service everyone was so pleasant and very professional especially Caterina who was exceptional. Truly scrumptious ‚ù§Ô∏è Can‚Äôt wait to go back,5,2018,10,25
203,Best place to stay in Dublin,"Terrific property, great location, and tremendous staff who greeted us when we arrived, sat with us at the lounge offering us drinks and helping plan our stay. Their recommendations for restaurants were all excellent and because they made reservations, we were greeted like returning customers. It is expensive but well worth the cost to get the larger rooms. Always ask for an upgrade. ",5,2018,10,25
203,Wonderful hotel!,"Very pleasant experience in Dublin. Large room, clean, pleasant staff. Great place to come back to after a long day exploring Dublin. Very comfortable bed. There was a delicious chocolate on the pillow every night, too.",5,2018,10,24
203,A wonderful treat,"I visited The Gallery recently to sample their afternoon tea and to celebrate my grandmother‚Äôs birthday. It was a truly wonderful experience. 
We were warmly greeted by the lovely Florrie who politely offered us a seat and a great deal of information about the service. 
We were served a delicious selection of tea and treats by the lovely Rems, who is truely a credit to The Westbury. He is so pleasant and extremely efficient.
I would recommend visiting The Gallery for its great food and terrific service.",5,2018,10,24
203,True five star experience,"Amazing hotel stay for a friends birthday, got a beautiful upgrade.  Staff so professional but not pretentious. Fantastic location in central Dublin.  Beautiful cocktail at the bar. Would absolutely stay here again.",5,2018,10,23
203,10 stay,"Was back in Dublin for my 10 stay this year.  The location of this hotel is fantastic and the service is outstanding.  Rooms are a bit small when traveling with my wife as there is not a lot of space in the standard room.

Located seconds from grafton street and many places to eat.

Staff at front door always ready to grab you a taxi and front desk staff will check you in and out with ease.

Bar staff at side car are amazing ( Eva and Michael) make my stays that much easier.
",4,2018,10,21
203,The Westbury‚Äôs Wonderful Staff,"The reason I return to The Westbury whenever I visit Dublin...the AMAZING staff. The majority of The Westbury team are hands down best in class for how to treat guests. They are so professional, so gracious and sincere. They truly bend over backwards to make your stay so memorable that you want to return again and again. Should you ever find yourself in the lobby lounge at The Westbury, do yourself a favor and ask to be seated in Marta T.‚Äôs section. So pleasant. So professional. Simply charming! She is one of those people you will remember long after you have returned home.",5,2018,10,21
203,A special start to our honeymoon,"Living in Dublin I've always wanted to stay here but could never justify it! Luckily we got married nearby and spent 2 magical days in the Westbury at the beginning of our honeymoon.

Staff were attentive and thoughtful. We arrived to rose petals the night of our wedding and champagne with our breakfast the next morning. When  we just missed breakfast the second day we were given the option of eating from the al le carte menu.

The hotel room is small but luxurious and the hotel itself is located in the nicest area of Dublin city, perfect for restaurants and shopping.

The hotel common areas are luxurious and comfortable - definitely give yourself time to sit upstairs and people watch from the windows!",5,2018,10,21
203,Delightful afternoon in Westbury ,"We had American friends over and afternoon tea in the Westbury with pink champagne was always on the list ; I had booked ahead and advised it was a special occasion! We were shown to our table - top left hand corner which I always think is reserved for VIPs - and that‚Äôs how we were treated ; our guests loved the whole experience with a birthday slice included 
I have never had a bad experience here ; thank you to all üòä",5,2018,10,21
203,How thoughtful and comforting,"Decided to meet a business colleague for a discreet drink/ meeting  in the Gallery. The stewarding, professionalism and set up was par excellence. 

The waiter was attentive yet discreet, the service was immediate.

Upon leaving for a late taxi, I inadvertently left my reading glasses on the table. But have no fear, Freya was here, and she followed us out to the front lobby, saving me a revisitation,  which would have been necessary though an
Inconvenience. 

Freya, you are a darling.

As I say, attentive and comforting.",5,2018,10,20
203,Average for top Price,"We stayed for 3 nights and had no internet. Really, I felt that nobody really cared. I could not get emails! Print off any airline tickets or try and book cars for Europe. I did not expect that. I am now in a tiny village in Holland and have internet a plenty?? We have stayed here for years and they did not even know that we were returning guests. frankly it is not good enough!!",3,2018,10,19
203,"Impressive Hotel, Great Location","We stayed here for two days at the end of our Ireland tour with CIE from 10/6 to 10/8.  We knew where it was, as we stayed in another hotel around the corner.  It is in a great location, walkable, or a short taxi ride, to many important Dublin attractions to include shopping on Grafton Street, or the Temple Bar area.  We also went to Bruxelles, which is right at the end of the block that the Westbury is actually on.  Bruxelles is a great pub for music as well as food, and is extremely convenient if you are staying at the Westbury.

The hotel itself has a number of good places to eat.  We had high tea in the main lounge area, called the Gallery, which is really pretty.  In that area is the Sidecar bar, which we twice visited. We also had dinner at Balfes, which when full was quite noisy, but served excellent food. Reservations definitely required.

Once, our party of four (2 rooms) came back from a long day shopping and seeing landmarks, and our rooms were not yet made up.  We told the main desk, and they said the rooms would be made up right away.  Two hours later, they were not, and again I notified the front desk.  So, they said it would be completed in about five minutes, but in the meantime, please go into the Sidecar bar, as the drinks were on the house.  That is what a quality hotel should do, and they did.  We had ""Sidecars"", and glasses of Jameson's, as well as appetizers.  

Another example of quality service: My wife did not like the room we were initially given, so no questions asked, they changed our room.  

I would not hesitate to stay here again, or at any of the other hotels that are also part of the overall Doyle collection.  The hotel is beautiful, and the service was extraordinary.",5,2018,10,18
203,Average hotel with convenient location,"I have stayed here numerous times, as the location is very convenient and close to everything.  The rooms are very small, as are the bathrooms.  Water pressure in the shower is quite weak.  The staff are very helpful and friendly which make it worthwhile.  There are 2 restaurants and bars onsite, which are nice for a night cap before heading up to the room.  ",3,2018,10,18
203,Not impressed ,"While the location is perfect, the hotel has definitely seen better days.  The rooms are very small and outdated.  The WiFi is terrible, we had to go into the hallway to get a signal and had to keep logging back on.  The gym is very small and not nearly big enough to accommodate the size of the hotel.  The food at Balfes was very good but not enough to compensate for the rest of the stay. Would not return.",2,2018,10,17
203,"Beautiful hotel, world class service, ideal location in Dublin!","From the moment we checked in, it was a 5 star experience.  The Westbury is so conveniently located right off of Grafton Street, within walking distance to Trinity College, Temple Bar and countless incredible restaurants.  The Concierge (Ashley) provided us with top notch restaurant suggestions.  The nightly turn-down service was a great bonus!",5,2018,10,17
203,Fantastic stay,Fantastic stay - most comfortable bed/pillows I've ever had at a hotel. I was very impressed with the staff (very friendly) and the accommodations (clean and modern). I would definitely return next time I'm in London.,5,2018,10,17
203,Ultimate Staff Service,"Huge kudos to the ‚ÄúGallery Team‚Äù  at the Westbury in Dublin especially ‚ÄúKleyton‚Äù! A patient, friendly, joyous guy with high people friendly skills / a delight to be served English Tea by him. Truly an asset to the hotel !",5,2018,10,17
203,Best Staff and Location!,"The staff at the hotel are beyond friendly and welcoming, they make sure you have everything you need. The lovely concierge desk were able to get us booked onto a tour that was initially sold out. They gave us some amazing recommendations of where to go. The hotel is located right in the middle of everything. You have shopping, cultural sites, great pubs and restaurants all within 5 mins walking of the hotel",5,2018,10,17
203,Simply The Best!,"We always choose The Westbury whenever we come home for a break. Simply the best hotel in Dublin!. The staff are so helpful, friendly and the location is perfect. Without doubt we will return to The Westbury when we come back to Dublin!",5,2018,10,16
203,Retired couple who eat out regularly,"The Westbury Hotel Bar food
We have eaten in the upstairs lounge and the restaurant on the ground floor,we have been going for about 40 years or more,we have never had a complaint,our favourite is the fish & chips which is served as it should be with professional staff with a beautiful location in Grafton st.Now the price!

For Tourists it is worth a visit,you will not be disappointed (enjoy)

203,Class and luxury and amazing service!,"My friend and I came to Dublin in the early week of September and had an amazing time at the hotel. The staff was always incredibly friendly and helpful. Shoutout to their amazing and beautiful bar called the Sidecar where Stefano and Stephanie were absolutely AMAZING bartenders! They have such skill and are so friendly and great to talk to. Stephanie made me some of her signature cocktails that she had been working on and they were delicious. Such a fun time watching them work and they are truly talented and great at what they do. Thank you Stephanie for making that night so special and truly a night to remember!!! Hotel is beautiful, no complaints whatsoever.",5,2018,10,15
203,The Gallery - Afternoon Tea at the Westbury,We had an excellent afternoon at the Westbury afternoon tea. Brilliant service from the very friendly staff especially Ecaterina. The tea and food were delicious and we were surprised with a birthday treat! Very relaxing afternoon.,5,2018,10,15
203,Class,"Impossible to find fault with The Westbury.

It has a very central location.  If you choose to drive they will valet park your car for ‚Ç¨25 a day.  It‚Äôs worth it.  Also, be careful for traffic wardens too as I got a ticket for parking in the taxi bay opposite the hotel for 5 minutes.  

Another word of warning, driving in Dublin city center needs a combination of Google Maps and luck!  It‚Äôs a shambles.  Of course, not the hotels fault.

The concierge term are very efficient and friendly.

The hotel itself is beautiful, decorated delightfully and oozes class.

The rooms are not massive but well appointed with a very comfortable bed.

The staff keep the rooms very clean and they have a nice turn down service.

Breakfast is in the excellent Wilde restaurant so is first class.

It‚Äôs not the cheapest hotel I‚Äôm sure but that‚Äôs a good thing if it maintains these levels.

We‚Äôll return.  ",5,2018,10,15
203,Expensive but good service,"We stayed at the Westbury as part of a tour package.  It was a treat for us as we would not normally stay at such an expensive hotel. Hotel prices in Dublin are high because off the demand I would guess...a thriving economy. The Westbury rooms were small but well furnished.  Bathroom towels very good. Shower  over the bath. Good size wardrobe with safe, ironing board & iron,  Coffee machine as in many hotels now but we never use them as we have never used them at home. Tea making facilities. Safe. Bathrobes.aircon worked OK but we took off the duvet as too warm  (yet aging another hotel with no alternative to a duvet) Good lounges and bar. Breakfast of a good standard was included. The staff are young, &  well trained to rectify things that go wrong .Hotel is well placed for transport and shops, sightseeing.",4,2018,10,14
203,Loved our stay at The Westbury!,"We recently stayed at The Westbury Hotel Dublin for seven nights. From the moment we arrived our visit was wonderful. We got to the hotel early morning after a long overnight flight and our room wasn‚Äôt available yet. While we had a delicious breakfast at Balfe‚Äôs (highly recommend) they got our room ready for an early check-in. Our room was spacious but cozy. During our stay we had trouble with WiFi. After trying, they were unable to solve the issue so they moved us to a new room. While we were out for the day the staff moved all of our belongings. We were not inconvenienced in the least. They followed up with a very nice note and a phone call. It was perfectly handled! Everyone from front desk staff, housekeeping, and the porters(especially Joe) were so helpful and friendly and they really added to our stay at The Westbury. The hotel is located near shopping, sights, and restaurants. A great location! We would stay there again and recommend to others wanting a luxury stay in Dublin.",5,2018,10,14
203,Dinner in Wilde,"Excellent everything! Service, food and wine were all great. Had dinner for 2 there recently. Plenty of options on the menu for even the fussiest of eaters. A wine list to suit all palettes. Nice cocktails. Suitable for couples or larger groups - unless you want to dance on the table. 

Wilde is now Dublin‚Äôs best fine dining experience in my opinion.",5,2018,10,14
203,Lovely hotel in perfect location,"We've been very happy with our stay at The Westbury, particularly the gracious service.  I would like to call out the great help I received from Michel (don't know his last name but he said he was Polish) who went out of his way to help me get a voucher printed when the printer I was linked to was out of ink.  I so appreciated his help and the fact that he stopped what he was doing to assist me.",5,2018,10,13
203,One of the best places I've stayed,"I recently visited Dublin the third week of September 2018 with a large, corporate group. We were booked at the Westbury and it is by far one of the best spots I've stayed at - they beat any Fairmont accommodation and hospitality I've been to across Canada.  It was incredibly busy but as a guest you were never made to feel like part of the crowd.  The concierge were busy around the clock but were so helpful - had there not be a ton of ppl in the lobby I would have loved to get more ""insider"" information about Dublin from them.  
We stayed on the 6th floor away from the elevators and never knew we had neighbours.  We had daily (sometimes twice) turn down service.  Breakfast was amazing and the service staff is one of the best teams I've witnessed.  Happy, bubbly and attentive. 
In terms of location - the best! We were informed by every local we me that we had the best spot.  Two pubs out your door step (McDaid's and Bruxelles with Kehoes up the road) and Grafton St. steps away.  St, Stephan's Green is about 5 min walk max. Trinity College is about 5-10 mins....15 min walk to Pearson train station.  15 mins to Liffey.",5,2018,10,11
203,Friendly hotel,"Just popped in for a quick coffee. Was immediately welcomed by a very handsome, elegant and polite young bearded waiter in the Westbury‚Äôs long tradition of hiring young men who look like Greek gods - I won‚Äôt complain. Quick attention, which is good 

Very drinkable coffee with nice complimentary biccie on the side. Pleasant atmosphere, no sense of being hurried along. Friendly staff, not snooty. Very well cared for toilets.

Perhaps the dim lighting might be raised slightly so that we can enjoy the tasteful de√ßor a bit more. I lost my car keys in the gloom. It‚Äôs so expensively decorated one would assume that they‚Äôd turn the lights up so we could see.

Lovely place though 

I‚Äôd have taken a photo but I couldn‚Äôt see far enough. I was dazzled when I got into the street.",5,2018,10,09
203,A Very Friendly Hotel,"This is a luxury hotel. One can correctly assume that it has the basics covered. It is clean, comfortable, safe, with all the amenities one would expect (except a night-light in the bathroom, which is almost illegal in Ireland).

What distinguishes the hotel are its excellent location, close to the main tourist destinations, and the friendliness of its very capable staff. In my case, I was not very well prepared for my stay in Dublin, but it didn't matter. We received excellent advice from the concierge staff. We had a fine time exploring Dublin, plus a few good meals at recommended restaurants that were probably better than ones I would have found using out-dated guide books (and they are out-dated as soon as they reach the press).",5,2018,10,09
203,Elegance in the city,This hotel stands above all others. It‚Äôs location is perfect. You can walk out the doors onto Grafton Street. Close to St. Stevens Green which was a lovely walk. The hotel and rooms were upscale and  elegant. The staff was extremely accommodating. We had both breakfast and dinner at the hotel and enjoyed them immensely.  Breakfast was fantastic. Highly recommend.,5,2018,10,07
203,Lovely afternoon,"Went to the westbury for afternoon tea for a birthday celebration. The food and service were both amazing. Ecaterina our main waitress and the rest of the staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a good afternoon. 
Would highly recommend. ",5,2018,10,07
203,Stopped for drinks,Great location to stop for a drink. The hotel is lovely and the bar is very nice. Lovely selection of wine. Wait staff was attentive. Especially when I asked if the nits contained soy for my allergy. He brought over the bag to let me look. Very kind. ,5,2018,10,07
203,Dark room and nowhere to sit outside our room,"Is an excellent location off Grafton street but quiet in our room.
We stayed for four nights.  The staff were professional, friendly and helpful. The room was beautifully serviced and the staff worked well around our jet lagged schedule.  Well equipped room.

We had room 526 which was not ideal as the window was on a side near the desk and with the lighting arrangement the  room was quite dark by the bed.   This issue was exacerbated as the hotel provided no space for residents to sit outside the room

My big issue with a hotel this expensive:  There was nowhere we could sit outside our room, for example when our room was being cleaned.   The hotel lacks a lounge.and the only area to sit we were told we would have to buy tea as they were busy selling afternoon teas.  We were told that we could go sit on a bench near the business center.

The hotel is in need of a minor rehab as is looking worn.  For example some of the signs in the elevator were half worn off.  In our room the phone message red light was flashing when we arrived.  I promptly told the hotel who said maintenance would fix it.  They did not fix this over the four days we stayed",2,2018,10,05
203,Beautiful service,"Went for afternoon tea at The Westbury on a Saturday, after hearing all the praises from friends and we weren't disappointed. Amazing service from start to finish. We were welcomed by a lovely young lady Ieva and brought to a beautiful table by the window. Our waitress Marta from Hungary went above and beyond! 

The food was more than what we expected and so filling: amazing selection of teas and coffees, fresh sandwiches and scones and mini desserts.  Such a nice treat! We will definitely come back to The Westbury on the next visit to Dublin. 

Kudos to the management for hiring the most lovely staff.",5,2018,10,05
203,Westbury,"We stayed at the Westbury overnight, and were very impressed with the service that we received as well as the overall quality of the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the hotel is ideally located in central Dublin.",5,2018,10,05
203,A Very Nice Place To Enjoy Dublin From,"Because of a terrible Aer Lingus delay, we checked-in much later than anticipated missing breakfast as we had booked the prior evening, and the reservation manager was not accommodating in offering lunch instead. However, the rest of the stay that resulted in 2 nights, was very fine. The Breakfast was Irish typical, nice. The extra mile was shown by the Concierge service that directed us to visit in addition to downtown classics a little half day tour of Howth. It is a very cute small sea port where we had a late lunch directly coming from the Irish Sea at Octopussy's seafood. Rooms are little small but this hotel is located in the heart of town that beats vividly even during the week. Concierge again was able to make a reservation to a very popular pizzeria. Sl√°inte !",4,2018,10,04
203,Great hotel in the heart of Dublin,"The Westbury Hotel has a great location for exploring Dublin, as well as for shopping.  The rooms are very nice, the staff excellent, and there are a nice selections of restaurants, all good.  Our overall experience was a very good one and when we return to Dublin, this is where we will happily stay!",5,2018,10,04
203,Perfect location and great staff.,"Everything you‚Äôd expect from a 5 star hotel. Located right in the heart of Dublin. Very good concierge staff. We got some great advise multiple times. They even went above and beyond when I left my camera in a rental car. The car had already been returned and they sent someone to get it. They even delivered it to me as we had breakfast. 
  The bar staff were also very fun. Can‚Äôt say enough good things about the people there",5,2018,10,03
203,Daughter‚Äôs 11th birthday ,Afternoon tea at the westbury to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs 11th birthday with the female relatives in her family. She absolutely loved all the fuss the wonderful Westbury staff made of her. They went over and above in the service provided and made my daughter feel like a princess. Everything was perfect and we will be back again!! Highly recommend this establishment. Thank you to everyone at the Westbury. ,5,2018,10,03
203,Fabulous Stay!!!,"Our first time in Ireland and we could not have had a better start than the Westbury!!!  From the wonderful service and friendly staff to the wonderful meals‚Äîwe had a fantastic time!!!  And so centrally located in Dublin!  Will definitely be back to Ireland, and back to the Westbury!!!
PS‚Äîwe went to the bar for drinks and appetizers, our waitress, Kiera, was among the best we‚Äôve ever had!!!  She was helpful and kind and just thoroughly enjoyed her job!  Top notch!!!‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",5,2018,10,02
203,A great start...,"My son and I traveled to Ireland to celebrate his recent graduation and our first stop was The Westbury in Dublin.  The location was perfect for getting around the City Center, everything was within walking distance.  The staff was friendly and the room was very nice.  The weather was unseasonably warm, and the air conditioning was well received.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,10,02
203,Excellent service!,"Myself and a friend decided to have lunch in Westbury in the lounge/ lobby on Sunday. We always love the decor, the cosy atmosphere and the food is really good.I would like to mention that Ecaterina looked after us really well, very smiley and attentive to details. Amazing service! We will definitely be back!",5,2018,10,02
203,"Nice hotel, decent location, terrible internet","It's a very nice hotel. As expected of a 5-star luxury hotel. Service staff were excellent and very courteous. Great location, as you can just step out of the hotel and onto Grafton Street and get some shopping and food quickly. One issue we had was the WiFi. Since they don't require any sort of authentication (that you are a hotel guest), anyone can hop on the WiFi and it bogs it down and makes it incredibly slow. We kept getting kicked off it and couldn't get some work done at the end of the day because of this. I think a system of putting your surname and room number should be implemented; like how other hotels do it.",3,2018,10,02
203,Lovely Weekend Getaway,"Understated Elegance.My partner and I stayed here for 2 nights at the end of September - a short weekend getaway to relax and visit some relatives.The hotel is very easy to locate (we took the AirCoach from airport to Kildare street and cut through to Grafton Street). On entering the hotel, we were immediately greeted and taken to reception for check in.Our room (Classic King) was located just off the elevators on the 4th floor, which I was concerned about at first, but you honestly don't hear anything outside - the room is very well insulated. The bed is to die for, by the way - super king with luxurious sheets and pillows! You're guaranteed a good rest on those beds.Breakfast was served in the Wilde restaurant (which, like the rest of the hotel, is beautiful) - fantastic choice of continental, as well as cooked. Eggs, pancakes, bacon, etc.We also sampled drinks in the Sidecar bar on both evenings, and can definitely recommend the 'Bertha's Revenge' G&T! it's a lovely little bar, but can get quite busy on a Friday night for pre-dinner drinks.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel for it's helpful staff, beautiful d√©cor and fabulous location.",5,2018,10,02
203,Luxury Hotel In A Prime Location,"We stayed at the Westbury after a 3 day stay at Adar Manor in Limerick.  I wasn't sure anything was going to compare to that experience, however the Westbury is a beautiful hotel and you cannot ask for a better location. The staff is second to none as they are respectful, helpful and very much interested in providing a stellar experience.  We will be back to Dublin, and will definitely be staying at The Westbury.",5,2018,10,01
203,Above and beyond,"Everything about The Westbury is 5 star/diamond (whatever your highest standard is measured by).Staff - super friendlyRooms - beautifulFood - deliciousLocation - couldn‚Äôt be better, in the middle of everything",5,2018,10,01
203,Beautiful Afternoon Tea,"I spent a lovely afternoon here with friends for afternoon tea. Everything from start to finish was spectacular. The setting is stunning and every piece of tableware was beautiful. We loved the Tiffany blue cups and plates!The attention to detail was excellent right down to the extra mini table for any teapots that didn‚Äôt fit on the table. We loved the whiskey Assam tea served with pouring cream and the melon tea! The highlight of the afternoon was our excellent server Kleyton , he was so lovely and friendly. He was very attentive but the service never felt overbearing. He‚Äôs an absolute credit to The Westbury. I came straight home and rebooked it as a present for someone else! Thank you!",5,2018,10,01
203,Elegant hotel in excellent location,"We started our honeymoon at the Westbury.  We loved the old world elegance of the interior, combined with the helpful professional staff.   Everything we wanted to see in Dublin was in walking distance.   The croissants were fabulous!",5,2018,09,29
203,A 5 Star Experience.....,"From the moment you arrive to the Westbury.  It is a first class experience.  The location, staff and hotel itself are AMAZING!!!  The Westbury is our first choice whenever we stay in Dublin.  We will be returning very soon and are much looking forward to it.",5,2018,09,29
203,My review,Fantastic hotel.  Ideally and centrally located to grafton street and other areas of interest.  Wilde is delicious and the sidecar is a great bar to hang out in.  Worth the price.  Just trying to get to 200 character minimum.  ,5,2018,09,29
203,Fabulous all around,"As other people have mentioned the location is unbeatable, within walking distance to everything in the city.  Located on Grafton St. it was wonderful to walk outside the door of the hotel and experience a very clean environment that welcomes you as you stroll along.
The service was impeccable.  We rented a car to tour the Northern Coast when we first arrived to Ireland and that night checked into the hotel.  We are from Canada and so driving in Dublin was unusual to us and a little nerve racking.  Due to construction and the fact that we didn't want to drive any further in the City we parked the car on a street outside of where the normal parking would be for the hotel.  This was no problem for them, as soon as we walked through the doors they took our luggage and when I told them where the vehicle was they immediately sent valet to retrieve it and park it for us. Throughout our week the service from the hostesses, maids, and front desk concierge were unbeatable.  A special mention for the lobby bar and Stefano who not only made exceptional martinis but also shared knowledge and history with us, which really topped off the evening",5,2018,09,27
203,Great location,"The Westbury can't be beat for the central location. The staff is wonderful,and very professional and helpful. However the room was very small and not a good value for the price.I normally would not pay this amount, but we were traveling with another couple who made the plans. Prices are high in Dublin.However, I can't say  enough good things about the staff. We were eventually upgraded to a suite, were given a welcome bottle of wine and a voucher for drinks.Lovely common areas.",4,2018,09,27
203,Back up to high standards,"We stayed at the Westbury in 2014 and were very impressed, but found it less appealing in 2017.  I‚Äôm happy to say it‚Äôs come back up to its high standard.  The rooms are lovely and comfortable, service is excellent but not overbearing, and the breakfast and tea are exceptional.  We arrived very early in the morning from the US and they brought a continental breakfast up to us since the dining room hadn‚Äôt opened yet.  The location is perfect, right on Grafton Street and steps from St Stephen‚Äôs Green and Trinity.  Highly recommend.",5,2018,09,26
203,Great Hotel & Location,"Always a pleasure to stay at The Westbury.  Fab location, friendly efficient staff members in all areas, great food & ambience.

On arrival the ever friendly & helpful Derek greeted us once again like old friends, always good to see a familiar face.

Old & new staff members in Balfes, met us each day with a smile & a chat.  The lovely Loredana looked after us so well...thank you Loredana!!!

Looking forward to our next visit...which will be very soon!!!",5,2018,09,26
203,Afternoon Tea,"We were treated to afternoon tea at The Westbury on our wedding day. We arrived still in our wedding attire and we were well and truly spoiled. Ekaterina was the name of our waitress, she was very polite and attentive a pleasure to have met her.
The afternoon tea was delicious with a lovely choice of sandwiches and sweet treats with champagne and endless tea in all different flavours. We had the best time on what was a very happy occasion. 
Thank you.",5,2018,09,25
203,"Westbury, Dublin, Ireland","Best hotel ever! Amazing staff and unparalleled accommodations.  Perfect location too...step out the door and you have pubs, restaurants, shops, everything within steps of the door!  Great restaurants on site, as well.  Wilde has the most incredible breakfast choices!",5,2018,09,24
203,Prime location,"My wife loves this hotel and we will be going there again next year. She has a point great location of Grafton St and close to Luas stop. Good restaurant Wildes which offers breakfast lunch and dinner and also lower floor restaurant, Balfes, which is good value. The bar and gallery are also very good for meeting friends and family or just chilling out.
The only issue I have is that your paying luxury hotel prices and i think the rooms, especially bathrooms are not up to that standard. The beds are good,all have temp control and coffeemaking machines just think they need updating. (My wife disagrees with me)",4,2018,09,22
203,Central Location,"Great central location for seeing the sights of Dublin, with many main attractions within walking distance. Public rooms, lobby and bar done up to give a swish city vibe, helped by the popularity of the hotel. Rooms good and quiet despite central location.  Quite pricey but you can see where the money goes. Would stay again. ",4,2018,09,20
203,Excellent hotel excellent service,The hotel is in a prime section and a great destination. Because there are 2 entrances we entered thru the back and where a bit confused where to go. The door man found us and led us to the 2 floor reception. Greeted by the desk clerk we were offered refreshing towels and bottled water. A nice touch. The room wasn't ready but were called when it was. The lobby is beautiful with a grand area for tea and a fantastic bar with great but expensive cocktail. To be expected. The room was a suite with a separate living area and bedroom. The furnishing weren't quite what I would have imagined but it was very nice. The bathroom was a touch worn down but not terribly so. All in all a fantastic hotel,5,2018,09,19
203,Afternoon tea delight,"My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon tea experience at the Westbury. We were warmly greeted by Florie Ghibaudo, Assistant Manager who showed us to our beautifully set table. All our servers were friendly and attentive and took excellent care of our every need. We were celebrating my parents birthdays and wedding anniversary. They were presented with two delicious treats in honour of their celebration which was such a lovely thought and was very much appreciated. We will continue to celebrate their birthdays and anniversary with our new tradition at the Westbury. We discussed our Christmas lunch plans with one of our lovely servers, Marta who was extremely helpful and after viewing the Wilde restaurant, we are booking our Christmas family lunch for mid December. Where better to celebrate in style. Thank you to everyone who made our experience so special. Best wishes, the Greene Family",5,2018,09,18
203,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location","The Westbury Hotel is in the perfect location in the middle of Dublin.  You have easy access within walking distance to upscale shopping, pubs, restaurants,  attractions, tours, etc.  It is a beautiful hotel with a very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  We would definitely stay there again!",5,2018,09,18
203,A great hotel in fabulous location,"At the end of our stay in Dublin, we had not been able to re-book in our original hotel, so our travel agent recommended The Westbury.  I am so glad we did end up staying in 2 different hotels bookending the trip, as we loved both!  The Westbury is right in the center of the city, and is an easy walk to many of things you would want to do and see.  The room was quite a bit smaller than we expected from the description for hotel of this caliber; however it was very attractive and of course immaculately clean.  We would definitely stay again but would do a bit more probing about the size of the room given the luggage we had with us.  If you want to stay in a gorgeous hotel in an ideal location, look no further.",5,2018,09,17
203,i have not words to say somthing more then excellent,"All the time I have good time there , amazing drinks and food , ambient perfect and relaxing, I love the afternoon coffee and tea, amazing cakes , still, elegance, refinement, is  all what you need and find in The Westbury, amazing staff",5,2018,09,17
203,Wish I had booked a room.,I was visiting Dublin over the weekend and a friend of mine had book a room at the Westbury.   We met up there for drinks and I immediately regretted not staying there it has this beautiful ambiance the staff were friendly and the drinks perfection.,5,2018,09,17
203,I Love This Hotel,"In 2015 we stayed at The Westbury after being cramped in a tiny little hotel in London.  We loved it.  But after London who wouldn't love the luxury and space of The Westbury.

When we planned to go to Ireland again this September, The Westbury was the only place we looked at for our Dublin leg and I hoped it would live up to our expectations.  It did.  I think we even got the same room for the three of us.

The Westbury is in an excellent location.  Right off of Grafton Street it is an easy walk to the Temple Bar area, and most of the local attractions.  For those that don't want to walk too far, it was a short cab ride.

The room was spacious, clean and very well appointed.  We had breakfast and drinks at Balfe's and enjoyed it.

Staff were friendly and helpful, making us feel welcome. Check in and out was very smooth and quick.

I can't think of a better place to stay in Dublin and plan to come back again!",5,2018,09,16
203,Best cocktails ,"I was with my wife last week in holiday and I decided to have some drinks in your famous Sidecar bar for our last night. We were greeted by the bartender, I believe Daniel is his name, he was preparing some great Martini for my wife and the best Old Fashioned that I have ever had.!!! I am sory we decided to go so late ! I would love to come back anytime !! ",5,2018,09,15
203,Charming,"Stayed at The Westbury August 18-21,2018.  We were a family of 4. As everyone says, the location is perfect!  We arrived very early from the US and as expected our room was not ready.  Our luggage was held for us as we explored.  We were exhausted from the overnight flight and relaxed in the lobby restaurant area.  Our room was ready earlier than check in, which was great.  Our room was spacious and clean.  It faced the alley where some construction was going on.  Our first night(which was a Saturday) we heard a lot of street noise as there was a pub right under our window.  The rest of the nights the noise was minimal. House keeping did a great job, especially with all our luggage taking up so much room.  Our second day we receive a noticed that the power company would be doing some work and that may cause periods with out power.  We left for the entire day so we didn't notice.  However, the next day we woke up to our room being very warm....much warmer than it was outside.  We made sure the A/C vent was not blocked and left for the day.  Upon our return the room was incredibly hot so we called the front desk.  They sent someone to confirm it was actually hot and we were using the A/C controls properly.  The woman confirmed the A/C was broken and offered us a portable fan.  The front called and asked if we wanted to sleep in another room for the night but the room was much smaller so we would have to leave all our luggage in the hot room and sleep in smaller beds.  This was not an option with 2 teenage boys.  We asked for another fan and they promptly brought it.  They also brought several bottles of water.  As this was our first trip to Europe, we learned that unlike US hotels, ice machines are not readily available.  The water was great that they gave us, but it was warm and no ice to cool it down. We found all the staff very friendly and helpful, the hotel beautiful and the location the best.  Overall we would stay here again and recommend it.  We would just make sure the A/C worked.",4,2018,09,14
203,Best cocktail bar,"Highly recommending the cocktail bar from this hotel! One the best drinks I ever had, were here, made by Gabriel!
Perfect ambience for going out for friends, but also for couples!
For anyone who is planning to visit Dublin, I suggest not losing the chance to sneak a peak in this place!
Fancy as well!",5,2018,09,14
203,Charming l Hotel,"I met my friend here for 2 nights this was my 3 rd visit over a 10 yr period, Still a lovely hotel with a great location, just walk out to all the shops, beautiful lounge area they have a great separate bar with snacks, our room was spacious with 2 double beds which were so comfy couldn‚Äôt wait to get in them. Reception staff amazing bar staff a little slow but would recommend this lovely hotel",5,2018,09,13
203,Excellent location and nice rooms,My husband and I stayed here for a week.   The location is ideal with plenty of restaurants and shops in the area.   The staff at the front desk are excellent.   The room was spacious.  The only change I would make to the room is to add more drawers for storage.   We received two bottles of water and a chocolate each day during turndown service which was appreciated.,4,2018,09,11
203,"Beautiful, Luxurious, Exceptional Service","We were thrilled to arrive at The Westbury and were met with enthusiastic, helpful bellmen. We were welcomed with opened arms and led to the front desk where we were greeted by an exceptionally professional staff. Our advisor at the desk was informative and efficient. She took the time to get to know us, knowing we were exhausted from our trip and she still managed to make us feel like she welcomed us into her own home. We were led over to the concierge desk where the gentleman took the time to book our visit to the Guinness factory and Kilmainham Gaol prison. (The prison is a MUST see if you visit Ireland so look for my review!). Everything at the front desk and concierge was seamless and we were given our keys to our rooms. We had three rooms booked and all three were near each other which we appreciated very much.

The rooms are beautiful, well appointed and clean! We loved the turn down service and the replacement of towels in the middle of the day. I love fresh towels daily and cringe when it is expected that we reuse a towel. There is a well stocked mini fridge and chocolates, fresh fruit, and water bottles are left each day.

The location is central to everything in Dublin and couldn't be more convenient. 

Breakfast was included in our package and we appreciated the vast assortment of cheeses, juices, bakery items, cereals, and the ability to order eggs, pancakes, etc which was all included in the price. The staff is attentive and caters to every request without question.

This hotel was our absolute favorite on our trip to Ireland. I wish all the hotels we visited were this exceptional!",5,2018,09,10
203,"5 star service, location, and facilities ","If you want excellent levels of service and the best location in Dublin, then book a stay at the Westbury hotel. We truly wanted for nothing, and the service was efficient, accommodating, and friendly without being intrusive. Its location is perfect, right in the middle of Grafton street with quick and easy access to restaurants, pubs and live music. Once in your room, you couldn‚Äôt hear any of this noise so proximity to the centre doesn‚Äôt affect sleep and relaxation. Breakfast is delicious and breakfast service is efficient. Great way to start the day with coffee/tea and the newspaper. Plus options for continental only or plus a hot breakfast. ",5,2018,09,09
203,Best fine hotel at hub of Grafton St!!,"The Westbury is a class act of a hotel. From the moment of reaching their doorsteps and a bellhop rushes to help you in, carrying to the checkin desk, to the multi-staffed reception desk, to the A+ concierge that told us the best of the best in everything we asked, I couldn't have been happier.  The included continental/full breakfast was great, with an overlooking view down on nearby Grafton Street. We also loved the bar for our champagne nitecap.  Very fine champagne was available too! For the afternoon tea crowd, the had a huge room with tons of guest eating a tower of yummy food, all were very happy. As we ate late lunches, we never had space for more food. Rooms were pleasant.  The best part? The hotel is steps from many famous pubs and top-of-line foodie restaurants like Fade Street Social and Market Bar, a uber short walk nearby. Never used a taxi or ride share as this hotel was so central to all the fun action for pubs and nice foodie restaurants. We'll stay there again when we revisit Dublin in the future.",5,2018,09,08
203,Marvelous Hotel in Dublin,"We stayed at the Westbury for two nights an couldn't have been more pleased. A first-class, comfortable hotel in every respect and the location couldn't have been better. We'd stay there again in an eye-blink.",5,2018,09,08
203,Nice hotel in good location,"Firstly, the staff was excellent here.  We arrived around 6 am and they had managed to have a room ready for us, which was amazing since we had been on an overnight flight and really needed it.  They were always helpful when we needed something.  Nice experience having cocktails at the bar one evening and a lovely tea one afternoon.  The food was really good.  Unfortunately there was a lot of construction going on at the time which was loud, and there was a strange stench by the lower level elevators which was off putting, the only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars. Also the location is excellent if you want to be close to everything. Overall a great experience.",4,2018,09,06
203,Excellent!!!!,This is a excellent hotel with lovely rooms and exceptional service. Breakfast was very good as was dinner at the hotel‚Äòs restaurant. This is an amazing location as well with excellent shopping pubs and restaurants all in the neighborhood! If you have an opportunity to visit Dublin this is a wonderful place to make your home base.,5,2018,09,06
203,Fourth time a charm.,"Another year, another great experience here. The staff was wonderful, walking distance to basically everything. Held our luggage for a week while we vacationed elsewhere. Upon returning every staff member remembered where we went and inquired as to our trip. Unfortunately I left without an answer as to where they get those bedspreads (new gray one) room 620.....Must have!!",5,2018,09,06
203,Excellent customer service,My fiance and I called into the Westbury on Saturday evening around 6pm for a light bite to eat. I have to compliment the service. There was a slight delay with our drinks which we didn't actually notice as we were chatting. The manager was so apologetic. At the end of the meal we decided not to get dessert. He asked us were we celebrating anything we said no but he still said he would give us a little dessert! It was such a lovely gesture and particularly as we are getting married soon and had just booked our honeymoon! We didn't get a chance to say thanks to him but wanted to spread the good word. Really impressive service from all the staff on the night.,5,2018,09,05
203,Enjoyable Stay in Dublin,"My family and I enjoyed 3 very enjoyable nights in the heart of Dublin. The hotel offered great service and location. Our two rooms were very quiet and comfortable. The staff were always friendly and accommodating. Breakfast buffet and menu offered a wide variety of very tasty options. The location is close to Grafton Street, as well as within walking distance of many attractions. We hope to return in the future.",5,2018,09,05
203,Elegant hotel in central Dublin,We enjoyed a two day stay in Dublin for business and pleasure.  The hotel is located very centrally and is a perfect spot for exploring the city.  It is filled with elegant charm.  The staff were incredibly attentive.  We had an issue with our room and the staff could not have been more helpful in resolving.  Sometimes solving the problem tells you the most about a property -- they were great.  Breakfast was lovely.  ,4,2018,09,04
203,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly","My son and I stayed at The Westbury in August.  Here's my experience:

The Good- best location and centrally located.  Who can ask for better, right off Grafton Street, within walking distance to just about everything, beautiful hotel, lovely staff and FANTASTIC bar with FANTASTIC drinks. Our flight got in very early (6am) and we arrived at the hotel around 7 am.  The staff did work hard to get us into our room, which happened around 10 am.  We were able to get some breakfast and walk around a very quiet Grafton Street, which was the only time it was quiet during our stay.   BTW, breakfast was a feast and not bad!  We discovered another restaurant on premise, Balfe's and they had the best fish and chips!

The Bad-the room we were in was ok.  Just ""ok"" and tucked into a corner next to the Fitness Room.  For some reason we could never get the room cool enough, and coincidentally we were there during a mini ""heatwave"".  It was hot, humid even with a fan (which the staff provided us).  We were also overlooking the back of the hotel and right next to a very loud bar which kept me up the first two nights.   It was still a good stay, and the staff was very apologetic....offering us complimentary drinks.  Which is why I know the bar is very good.  

The Ugly-parts of the hotel needed a bit of TLC, but for the most part, the common areas were lovely.  

If you are looking for something centrally located with pretty common areas, I would recommend The Westbury.",4,2018,09,04
203,Excellent stay,"I have stayed in several Dublin hotels but this is the best.  The staff were genuinely friendly and the breakfast was wonderful.  It's not cheap but I consider it value for money.  Location is perfect too, close to Grafton Street and St Stephens Green just around the corner.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,09,03
203,Mixed feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this hotel. We arrived around 9 a.m. after about 24 hours of traveling. Our room wasn't ready (and we didn't expect it to be), so we were offered the fitness center to freshen up before starting our day of site seeing. As soon as we returned from freshening up, our room was ready, so we were able to stash our bags and get on our way. So far, so good. When we returned in the evening, we tried the air conditioning, and couldn't get the room to cool. My husband called down to the desk for help, and they told us that it was as cool as it was going to get. No one came up to check, or to see if in fact there was a problem. We opened the windows, but it was still very warm and VERY noisy with the bar scene right below us all night, and then construction in the early morning hours. We got little to no sleep on top of being jet lagged and getting little sleep during our travels. We found out the next day that yes, in fact, there WAS a problem with the AC, and they moved us to a new room, which was great, but that should have been done the previous evening. There was no apology, no compensation for that first awful night. Yes, it's a nice hotel, and yes, it's conveniently located, and yes, the breakfast is very good, but I'm a crabby lady when I don't get a good night's sleep.",3,2018,08,31
203,Delightful afternoon tea,"Enjoyed afternoon tea here in the lounge. The welcome was professional and friendly and we were allocated a table window which was lovely. Our hostess then gave us a wonderful run through of the afternoon tea menu, including her personal recommendations. This showed her personal knowledge of the menu and gave a personal touch. She asked us if we were celebrating a special occasion, we were, but there was no acknowledgement of this at any point later in the afternoon tea (our waitress also asked). The tableware is gorgeous, table a little on the small side, chairs are sumptuous and the room decor is fabulous. 

To the food and drink, we enjoyed the sandwiches, and we were invited to just ask if we would like more if anything which starts off setting the price tag. The truffle chicken in brioche roll was amazing, the ham delicious. Enjoyed the scones with cream and jam. The top tier of pattiseries was not to either of our tastes however. We looked on in envy at another table who were enjoying macaroons etc. A selection including some chocolate pattiseries would have been much more to our tastes but I appreciate that‚Äôs personal taste. 

The tea and coffee kept coming and our waitress was lovely.

It‚Äôs a real treat and a memorable experience. Please add chocolates though...",4,2018,08,30
203,Wonderful Dublin Hotel,"the Westbury is a wonderful hotel , ideally located in central Dublin. The service is exceptional and the property is beautiful. it is truly a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of the world outside the hotel.",5,2018,08,29
203,Champagne Afternoon Tea,"The afternoon tea was a delight. Such relaxing surroundings and fantastic service. There was so much food, with the option to ask for more sandwiches, we rolled out of the lounge. The Nutella hot chocolate was particularly noteworthy and the cocktails, as always, didn‚Äôt disappoint. A wonderful way to while away an afternoon. ",5,2018,08,27
203,Fantastic Hotel,"I have travelled all over the world and stayed at the best hotels, and I rank The Westbury as one of the best. The exterior and interior have a sophisticated, sexy style with gorgeous fresh flowers everywhere! The side car, bar is amazing to hang out and drink and the restaurants were fabulous- especially the beautiful room inside Wilde. All of the staff were friendly and accommodating, and I liked that at night time they checked to make sure you were a guest- made me feel very safe and secure. My favorite part- the butlers chockates left on your pillow every night. Can‚Äôt wair to visit again soon!",5,2018,08,27
203,Cocktails heaven ,Really helpful barman who listens to your taste and makes heaven in a glass. Lovely surrounding close to the shops. Fantastic meeting spot in the centre of Dublin.  An oasis from the busy Street with cocktails to make you want to party ,4,2018,08,27
203,A fine hotel experience in the history heart of Dublin,"The Westbury exceeded my expectations as a fine hotel. The entire experience, from reception and concierge, the quality of the public spaces and room, the restaurant and bar, were exceptional. The public spaces are exceptionally well decorated. I want to especially call out the friendly staff at the afternoon tea and the bar.  The location is excellent - you're just feet away from Grafton Street, and a few minutes walk from St. Stephen's Park, Trinity College, or the Liffey River.",5,2018,08,27
203,Great Location ,"This is a big hotel in a great, central location for any tourist visiting Dublin for a few nights. It‚Äôs just off Grafton street (which is sadly over rated) but it does mean it‚Äôs a short walk to Trinity and all the surrounding cafes, bars and shops. 

Although it‚Äôs a big hotel it has managed to retain its charm and there is a nice relaxed, friendly vibe about the place. The bars and restaurants are all comfortable and pleasant. 

My room was a good size though the bathroom was tiny. The view from my room was roof tops and fairly grim but the room was quiet and the bed very comfortable. 

I had a couple of issues when I arrived and they were quickly sorted out and the staff bent over backwards to take of me and ensure my stay ran smoothly. 

I‚Äôd definitely recommend and go back. ",5,2018,08,26
203,Would stay again,"This is the 3rd time I've stayed here in the last year and it gets better every time. Very helpful staff especially the girls in guest relations. Light airy rooms. Good breakfast and loved the large gallery area for eating.

The only major downside was the wifi. Had none in one room, although they changed the router etc, I ended up having to repack and move rooms on the same floor (level 3) which had intermittent wifi so would have to go down to the gallery lounge to access good and fast internet. The issue comes if you need to work while you are on the road and can't do it in the quiet of your room. Their business centre consists of one tiny cubby hole with a desk-top computer and a printer that was not hooked up. This meant having to work in the lounge area which was loud as people are having their afternoon tea etc On one occasion, we were told that we could not sit in the gallery area as the tables were pre-booked for afternoon tea. There was no where else to sit.

I didn't have wifi problems before so perhaps it was just on level 3. Would stay here again but ask for a different floor.",4,2018,08,25
203,The gallery @ westbury,"I had an amazing time with my dad and my partner, we really enjoyed an afternoon tea for a special occasion! The two hours past in the gallery was brilliant, all the personal was attentive and pleasant. Especially, Ecatherina who was serving us, taking care of our table and give us all the attention we need. She help us to have a great time ! 
Thanks again to all the team",5,2018,08,23
203,Excellent Location for business and weekend breaks.,"I live in Dublin and regularly go to the Westbury for drinks and special occasions. We stay in the hotel periodically and could not recommend it enough. The staff are very helpful and nothing is a problem ever. It has one of the best cocktail bars in the city and the new restaurants are a great addition.If you are travelling for pleasure you are literally a 5/10 minute walk for allot of the cities main attractions. Grafton street and Dawson street which are great for shopping and nightlife are a one minute and 5 minute walk. Location, Location, Location!!",5,2018,08,23
203,5 star afternoon tea,The afternoon tea in the westbury is simply outstanding. The food is extremely well presented and tastes delicious. They have quite a large choice of teas and coffees also. Every memeber of staff we encountered were very helpful and friendly. A special mention goes to Ekaterina who went above and beyond on the day. She even brought us a small cake saying congratulations on your engagement. ,5,2018,08,23
203,superb location. Great service.,"Great Concierge service. I had back pain and Mr. Thomas made all effort to help me book an appointment at any spa. When everywhere was full, he was able to arrange a masseuse to come directly to my room. He was very efficient, helpful, friendly and resourceful. Thank you Mr Thomas!",5,2018,08,23
203,Perfect cocktails experience,I highly recommend the bar of this hotel. Had an amazing experience and the stuff was very attentive. Gabriel prepared us a wide variety of cocktails with different flavors I didn't know exist. Great for couples!,5,2018,08,22
203,Great Bar Service,We spent 4 nights here. The location is fantastic and the hotel is as expected for a Leading Hotel designation. No disappointments there.  The bar is beautiful and the service is outstanding.  We were served by Stephanie who had been on staff for about 3 weeks.  She makes you feel comfortable and is very attentive. The Breakast area is lovely as well.  This is our second time at this property and we will be back!,5,2018,08,22
203,Great service and location,"Staff was always friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet and menu offered a wide variety of foods.  The location is close to Grafton Street, as well as within walking distance of many attractions. Meeting rooms are available for both small and large groups.",5,2018,08,21
203,Exceptional Staff and property,"We spent the last two nights of our trip to Ireland at The Westbury to treat ourselves and what a treat it was!  The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are very comfy and well appointed and the amenities were top notch.  The hotel staff were amazing.  From check-in to check-out so friendly attentive and helpful.  I actually left a backpack in a taxi when we were going to the airport and the concierge must've called every taxi in the city because they found it for me.  The location was perfect as well - you are just half a block from the Gaiety Theatre and walking distance to the Book of Kells, Trinity College and Temple Bar.  It's basically on Grafton street so plenty of shopping abound as well.  The hotel is expensive, but definitely worth it as you will get what you pay for here.",5,2018,08,21
203,Great service,"The hotel is at the expected standards, the service is excellent especially when you meet professionals as Ecaterina, will probably just want the breakfast coffee to have a better taste. If not you can have a good one at Clement & Pekoe, one min away from the hotel.",4,2018,08,20
203,A fantastic hotel,"I recently stayed here for a weekend while visiting friends and was immediately impressed with the standard of the westbury. The decor is elegant, the staff friendly and my room had a wonderful view of the city. My friends joined me for an evening drink in the gallery and we were well looked after by Reena our delightfully chirpy server. It's central location drops you right in the middle of Dublin's happening nightlife. Will definitely recommend to friends.",5,2018,08,20
203,Excellent hotel property. Well worth the price,Hotel property and staff were first class.  We were able to check into one of our two rooms immediately upon arriving in the morning which was a great benefit. All staff members were very friendly and concierge desk was very helpful in booking excursions and making restaurant recommendations. Morning breakfast buffet was very good. Hotel has prime location near major shopping/restaurant district on Grafton Street.  Only complaint was that the wi-fi in one of our rooms was very weak.  Would definitely stay here again.,5,2018,08,20
203,Amazing deserts and service,"Great place to hang out and spend time with your family and friends. I've had a great time in this place with my brother which was visiting Ireland, thanks to Camila for your amazing service and Laura for your delicious deserts. I highly recommend the hot chocolate with orange and the chocolate.",5,2018,08,19
203,An enjoyable stay,"Very impressed by the excellent hotel guest service. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful, from manager to the door man. Good size room, clean and comfortable. Great location right off the pedestrianised Grafton Street and a few minutes walk to a nice park nearby for morning exercise. Overall good value for money.",5,2018,08,19
203,A+ Experience,"The Westbury is my choice of hope tells in Dublin.  It is half a block from Grafton Street ‚Äî where all the action is. Many sights and restaurants nearby.

The rooms are nice.  I wish there was a little more storage, but this is typical of many European hotels.  The beds were comfortable and the sitting chairs were very relaxing.

The lobby is an excellent place to meet friends and have a cup of tea or a drink.

Service at the hotel is outstanding.

I will be back next year!",5,2018,08,18
203,Exquisite hotel,"We chose this hotel based on a friend's recommendation.  It did NOT disappoint!!  We would stay there again without hesitation.  Fantastic service, allowed us to check-in early.  We didn't like the step in the entry way of the room they put us in (I would probably stumble in the night), and they were quick and more than happy to switch us to a room without a step in it.  The a/c was glorious, that is one of my major criterias in a hotel.  Much to my husband's chagrin, I set it at 16* and was cool and comfortable all night.  The location is outstanding, right in the middle of everything but also a quiet nook.  View was great - ask for a view facing the street.  Nothing to improve on this one!",5,2018,08,18
203,Luxury in the midst of everything,"This is an elegant hotel located just steps from the pedestrian shopping street, Grafton. Also easy walk to Trinity College and numerous other Dublin sites and eateries/pubs. 

The rooms are fully air conditioned and nicely decorated, though a tad small. They offer a very nice, full menu breakfast. Some mornings the wait staff wasn't that attentive.So give yourself a bit of time.

There is a very nice upper lobby (the lower lobby being basically a street entrance.) They serve drinks and light food there (with table cloths, of course) so we felt a bit uncomfortable just sitting there as one might in a traditional lobby.

Excellent staff at the front desk and the concierge desk. Very helpful.This is overall a terrific choice for your Dublin visit.",5,2018,08,16
203,Afternoon Tea,"I treated my 72 year old mother and her sister  to Afternoon Tea for her birthday  in The Westbury on Wednesday 15 th August .

From the time we arrived we were greeted with the warmest of welcomes, big smiles and the most courteous staff.

The afternoon tea was absolutely delicious and worth every penny. The whole experience was made even more pleasurable by our server Michael. What a lovely, attentive and polite young man, who effortlessly cared for us. He really is an asset to the Westbury .

In total, a fantastic venue, great ambiance and amazing food.
We will return.

203,Very nice indeed,"Stayed on a few occasions with my partner, not  a place to take the kids ! The rooms are very luxurious with nice bathrooms. Valet parking available under the hotel as you bang in the middle of Dublin and the pedestrian area. Nice foyer area where afternoon tea and glasses of whatever tipple you fancy are available (make sure you've plenty of room on the credit card for this). I've never had breakfast on the 2-3 stays firstly as I believe it to be quite over priced but more importantly I like to roam for breakfast in the morning. It's one of Dublin's most prestige hotels, so you will expect to pay the prices. The rooms are lovely and very comfortable, the interior is as you would expect and the staff look after you well.",4,2018,08,16
203,Comfortable and Relaxing Stay,I really enjoyed my stay. I usually stay here for a night or two when I arrive in Dublin on my way to Waterford. Everyone was so helpful and accommodating. The bar is also a lot of fun! We ate at the restaurant a few times too. I would recommend having dinner there one night in Dublin. ,5,2018,08,15
203,Afternoon Tea,"A couple of us enjoyed afternoon tea on Saturday and it was a most enjoyable experience. The service was excellent and the afternoon tea sandwiches, scones and cakes were also excellent accompanied by a wonderful selection of tea. While it wasn‚Äôt inexpensive at ‚Ç¨50 a head it was very gratifying to see a great crowd enjoying afternoon tea. ",4,2018,08,15
203,Exceptional Hotel that is just first class.,"From any perspective beginning with check in through the check out, this is a most congenial and exceptional hotel. Each and every staff person that we interacted with was genuinely courteous, helpful, facilitative, and did everything that they could to make us feel welcome and valued. This is a really first class hotel with a wonderful ambience and quality to enable a wonderful stay.",5,2018,08,15
203,Afternoon tea at the gallery,We were staying in another hotel in Dublin City for the weekend and heard about the westbury to enjoy afternoon tea. We enjoyed everything about the afternoon tea and it‚Äôs something we will definitely come back to enjoy again. Thanks to Sarah who managed to squeeze us in when the lounge was completely full. We even managed to get the best table beside the window. Wonderful experience.,5,2018,08,13
203,Afternoon tea at the Westbury,"Its literally perfect.  The food is amazing the setting is chic, and glamorous, but comfortable and inviting.  The staff is incredible.  I went by myself on a Saturday - without a reservation - they squeezed me in and never let me want for anything.  You get want you pay for and in the case of afternoon tea at the Westbury its worth every penny.  I've been twice and wouldn't miss it if I was ever back in Dublin.",5,2018,08,11
203,Afternoon Tea at The Gallery,"My Mam booked afternoon tea for us two for my 21st birthday. From arrival, the staff here were exceptional. Our waiter Rob was so helpful and friendly from the moment we sat down. As it was our first time for afternoon tea there, he explained everything and was so attentive with his service making sure we were topped up with tea etc. He even brought out a cake with happy 21st birthday written on it. He really made our experience special and we would recommend it to anyone.",5,2018,08,11
203,Interesting traditional afternoon tea,"The room for afternoon Tea is sumptuous and the service was excellent.  The sandwiches and scones were delicious however the waiter had to tell us what each cake was and explain what ingredients were in them, this was due to not a single cake being recognisible.  It is very nice having very fancy cakes but a meringue, chocolate eclair or victoria sandwich would also have been nice.",4,2018,08,10
203,Afternoon tea at the gallery,"We were there for afternoon tea for my birthday, had a great time, a very peacefull environment. Robbie the was the server for us that afternoon. His service was excellent and very helpfull. The overall experience was great, would recommend to others.",5,2018,08,09
203,Stephanie in the the Gallery Bar is an outstanding whiskey advisor,"One of the things that can make a trip truly outstanding is finding someone with more knowledge than oneself and a giving them the free range to be your guide.  That was the case with Stephanie who was working in The Gallery Bar in the Westbury on last Tuesday evening.  I described my tastes in whiskey and asked for her to pick an Irish Whiskey or two that would add to the adventure of my week long golf trip to Ireland.  First up was a Roe & Company selection followed then by a Teelings Single Grain.  The two were both outstanding but clearly different in taste.  In addition to offering fine advice, Stephanie was yet another example of the enthusiastic, engaging and welcoming Irish that we met throughout our trip. I will definitely choose the Westbury and the Gallery Bar on my next trip to Dublin.",5,2018,08,09
203,Drinks in the gallery,Stopped at the gallery for a few drinks after a gorgeous lunch in Wilde. It was a very busy Saturday afternoon but service was good. The drinks were lovely. This whole hotel is just stunning. Definitely recommend for a treat.,5,2018,08,09
203,Classic,"I have nothing but wonderful things to say about The Westbury. This hotel is in the best location in Dublin, which is walking distance to all the important attractions, shopping, and restaurants, but is also quiet inside the guest room. The room was impeccably clean, had a wonderful scent, and contained every amenity one could want. The bed was extremely luxurious and comfortable as well. Having A/C during a rare heat wave in Dublin was a Godsend! 
The food at the breakfast buffet was plentiful, fresh, and delicious as well as the wonderful afternoon tea. Absolutely delicious! Service left a lot to be desired at the tea because it was difficult to find someone to help. Also, we were told there were unlimited refills of the food, but when we asked for more, they wanted to charge per piece. There must be a misunderstanding between their policies and their service staff that needs to be redefined, but nevertheless we enjoyed our tea. Lovely hotel I would absolutely return to if ever in Dublin again. ",5,2018,08,08
203,Another Great Stay at the Westbury,"We were checked in by Mohammad and everything went smoothly.  We got a room and it was beautiful with great A/C and a very comfortable bed.  You can't ask for a better location as it is right off a very busy shopping street meant for pedestrians only which is Grafton Street.  They also called a taxi for me when we left to take us to the airport and the taxi driver's price was fair.  I think it was less than 25 euros.  We already knew from the last visit that their breakfast is exceptional.  All in all, this is our favorite hotel in Dublin not only because of its amenities but because of its location.  When we return to Dublin, there is no doubt that we will once again stay at the Westbury.",5,2018,08,08
203,60th Birthday Suprise,"Well what can I say- we have just returned from a 2 day visit to Dublin, with an overnight stay in The Westbury Hotel Dublin- did I just say ‚Äòa stay‚Äô - this is more than a stay! It‚Äôs a whole new experience in comfort, hospitality and attention to detail - not to be missed.! 
Thank you to managers Emer, Jack and Joseph for looking after us so well, restaurant staff, especially Daniel for exquisite service- food outstanding, wines very easy on the palate, our king suite was beyond comfort !

So if your looking for a hotel to spoil your loved one look no further !
Well done and thank u team WB!",5,2018,08,07
203,Afternoon Tea ,"We went to the Westbury for afternoon tea as a birthday treat. It‚Äôs a pleasant way to spend a few hours catching up and slowing going through sandwiches, scones and pastries. Various blends of tea are available and of course you can elect to have a glass of bubbles too. Sofas are very comfy and service is somewhat attentive. ",5,2018,08,07
203,Carlsberg don‚Äôt do afternoon teas...,"As I‚Äôm new to Tripadvisor, I‚Äôve not reviewed any of my regular afternoon visits across Dublin (where I was born) and Cambridge (where I now live). However, the Westbury is a constant favourite and one I feel cannot be topped! 

Visiting this magnificent hotel twice a year is now a ritual for my mother‚Äôs birthday and for the ultimate Christmas experience. 

What makes this an exquisite place for afternoon tea is the outstanding quality of food and the continued impeccable service of the staff who work there. 

In the many times I‚Äôve visited, the chefs have always catered exceptionally well for coeliacs and those with an intolerance to gluten. Furthermore, they prepared some incredible extra treats for my mother and sister when it was their birthdays! It was such a special touch!

If you want to be treated to delicious, mouthwatering food and an overall memorable experience, then this is the tea for you! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",5,2018,08,07
203,First class people at The Westbury,"I cannot fault the staff at The Westbury. I stayed with my wife to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Arantxa from the front desk rang me before I arrived, to sort out a booking query, and in doing so re-booked me at a better rate than had been available when I first booked. After the first night, we had an issue with the air-con in our room and Joseph, the head of guest relations, sorted us a replacement room in minutes, arrived personally to take our belongings to the new room, and because it was a lesser grade room, offered us complimentary lunch in Wilde's, complete with cocktails and wine. The cost of the meal was significantly greater than the difference in room price, but it was all done so graciously and sincerely that I had no doubt they were truly sorry our visit might have been spoiled. We also enjoyed champagne afternoon tea and some hearty breakfasts, and at all times, every one of the waiting staff we spoke to were happy, polite and knowledgeable, as were the concierges whose attention to detail was impeccable.
I'll be honest, I don't make a habit of using five star hotels, but if I did, I would certainly stay at The Westbury when visiting Dublin.",5,2018,08,06
203,Nice hotel in heart of Dublin,"We stayed 4 nights recently.  It is well located in the heart of Dublin, close to lots of restaurants, shopping, and pubs.  Hotel staff very attentive.  Concierge staff was excellent, especially Ashley.  Nice hotel pub called Balfe's where they can make a good martini.  Breakfast was good, suggest ordering the porridge and brown toast from room service.",5,2018,08,05
203,Perfect,"My wife, son and I spent two nights at this hotel and everything about it was perfect. The location just south of Temple Bar was a perfect location for touring Dublin. In addition to the hotel restaurants, there were many excellent restaurants within a few minutes walk from the hotel.The staff were all very helpful and extremely courteous from the moment we walked in the door to the moment we left. The rooms were large, clean, comfortable and quiet and the breakfasts provided were very good as well. In my opinion this is an ideal hotel when visiting Dublin for pleasure or business.",5,2018,08,05
203,Pluses and Minuses,"+Staff was extremely welcoming and helpful including the restaurants
+ Excellent Location for a ‚ÄúDublin Experience‚Äù
+ Very nice first class feel in public spaces
-Rooms are on the small side and miss high end finishes
-elevators are slow, tired and frustrating
-WiFi was barely functioning in the room
-Fitness facility was wholly unacceptable; clear there is zero effort",3,2018,08,04
203,10/10,"I‚Äôve stayed at The Westbury numerous times and it has always been great. This time , upon check-in we had a mix up with the room which shouldn‚Äôt happen in a hotel of this caliber so I was quite annoyed but after speaking to reception I was told I‚Äôd receive a call back from the Guest Relations Manager - Joseph Downing . He is the most polite and obliging man I‚Äôve ever encountered through my years of staying in hotels. He rectified our problem immediately and more. The following day Joseph approached me in the lobby, introduced himself and again apologised for the mix up, he is the definition of a gentleman. I cannot compliment him enough. He changed the entire experience from feeling disappointed to a fantastic stay and we will be back soon. 10/10 Joe and team.",5,2018,08,03
203,Great concierge in very comfortable hotel,"Ashley, our concierge  made out stay quite memorable. Not only did he make some excellent suggestion on great places to see and dine he also politely told us where not to go. If I were to cast the perfect concierge for a movie it would be him.
The hotel rooms are very spacious and nicely equipped.The included breakfast was very good with more choices than any one person deserves. We'd stay at the Westbury again.",5,2018,08,03
203,Exceptional service and experience. ,"I visited the westbury hotel with my girlfriend for a drink on her birthday. Entering the cosy terraced area, we were greeted by a very cheerful woman named R√≥is√≠n, through conversation mentioning to  R√≥is√≠n that it was my girlfriends birthday she went to great efforts to ensure that our first visit to the wesbury will most definitely not be the last. Not only is it great when you get exceptional service, yet even better when you feel special during a visit. R√≥is√≠n  we can‚Äôt thank you enough, you‚Äôre a gem.",5,2018,08,03
203,Great hotel in a great location ,We booked a superior room for 3 nights and found it to be very comfortable and had everything we needed. If there was anything which could have been better it was that the bathroom was a bit small in that the two of us could not be in there at the same time. The breakfast was excellent and was brought to our table rather than the all too common self service which I am not keen on. We also used the Sidecar bar each evening and can thoroughly recommend the cocktail menu. And the staff in there were very helpful and happy to do cocktails that are not on the menu.,5,2018,08,03
203,Attractive but noisy,"The central location of the Westbury is a big disadvantage if you want a good night's sleep. There is constant noise in the streets at night both at the front and back.
The decor of the hotel is beautiful and the staff very friendly and helpful. Nonetheless it is extremely expensve and taking into account the size of the rooms and  noise in the streets it is poor value.",2,2018,08,03
203,Very special hotel in best neighborhood in Dublin,We stayed here for three nights and wished we could have stayed longer. Our room was very comfortable and spacious and the lobby and restaurants were refined with excellent and friendly service. Breakfast setting is beautiful and was a highlight of our day. Location is perfect - close to the action but removed enough. The concierge staff was excellent and even made efforts to help us reclaim a bag lost by AerLingus after we had left the hotel!. We highly recommend!,5,2018,08,02
203,Great location!,"As noted by many, location is spot on for this hotel - short walk to sites, restaurants, pubs, Luas station. Most of the service staff (front desk, house keeping) were courteous and professional with the exception of the staff who was manning the concierge desk on my final night. Just remember that body language speaks a thousand words. 

Room is slightly small but comfortable. Room amenities were adequate but definitely not lavish as compared to a few other 5* hotels globally which I‚Äôve stayed. House keeping did a fantastic job with the cleaning and turndown service daily.  Had a room facing Harry St - can get quite noisy with the pubs playing music. Thank goodness they stop by about 11pm. 

Overall, it was a pleasant stay but have had better ones compared to the other 5* hotels in the world. ",3,2018,08,02
203,Best Stay Ever!,"To stay at the Westbury was one of the best decisions ever.  Great location in Dublin, great hotel and the service and kindness was refreshingly unexpected.  If we were to return to Dublin, we would definitely stay at the Westbury the entire time.  Cannot say enough good things.  A special shout out to Leigh and Joseph as well as other names I have forgotten for making our 50th anniversary special.  Thank you again.  You guys rock (as we say in the US)!",5,2018,08,01
203,"City Centre Location, Excellent Customer Service","The hotel is ideally located just 2 minute walk from Grafton Street but once in the hotel you immediately loose the busy city center feeling as the d√©cor and ambiance in the hotel make you feel relaxed. Added to this is the excellent customer service - from the second you walk through the door staff attend to your every need - taking your luggage, cold/hot towel on arrival, bringing your bags to your room, turndown service with a butlers chocolate. Throughout the hotel staff are friendly and willing to assist in any way possible.
Breakfast is a mix of a continental breakfast and an A La Carte selection  - the pancakes and eggs benedict are excellent while from the continental breakfast there is an abundance of fresh fruit and scones. 
Overall I would highly recommend this hotel - definitely worthy of its five stars - although there is no pool facilities in the hotel which is the only thing to watch for.",5,2018,08,01
203,Fabulous ,We stayed here recently and we couldn't fault anything. From the minute we came in through the door our luggage was taken. Fast check in/out. The beds are amazing - so comfy. Breakfast amazing with the mosdt delicious pastries. Cannot wait to stay again .,5,2018,07,29
203,OMG OMG,"Thank you for the best stay ever xxx 
I have stayed in some of the very best hotels in the world . NEVER have I had the service kindness that I had hear . 
Your staff are amazing your food is truly the best I have eaten. 
There is nothing wrong with this hotel it‚Äôs clean spotless. The rooms are super nice. As I said and will say again FANTASTIC. 
In the bar I was a bit cold the aircon was on so I asked if it could be turned down a little. Know problem it was done . And just to make sure I was comfortable the waiter brought me a beautiful shawl just in case . 
STUNNING service thank you 
When I go to Dublin again it‚Äôs the westbury for me , every time . ALWAYS FOREVER.",5,2018,07,28
203,Well located upscale hotel,"This hotel is ideally located just off Grafton Street. We had a  comfortable junior suite with a great bed, nice sitting area and a beautiful bathroom. A full buffet breakfast was included in our rate, which meant we could select from buffet dishes and also order off the menu. We also had a dinner in the hotel. Overall, the quality of the food was high. The main attraction of this hotel was the service, which in all departments of the hotel was exceptional.",5,2018,07,28
203,Excellent Service,"The service at the Westbury Hotel sets it apart from many of its rivals.  From top to bottom, the staff goes out of their way to be exceptionally welcoming and helpful. The building is older but beautiful and well-maintained.  The restaurants and bars of the Westbury are wonderful spaces to enjoy a meal or a drink. And the quality of the food was quite good. Worth a visit!",5,2018,07,28
203,Classic Hotel in Perfect Location,"Our family stayed at the Westbury at the start of a three week Irish road trip. The service was excellent, particularly the concierge. Rooms are not modern but classically elegant and the beds very comfortable. The location is walking distance to all attractions; Trinity College, the Liffey River and Grafton St shopping. We loved Balfes, for breakfast as well as evening drinks and oysters. Thank you for a lovely stay!",5,2018,07,28
203,Exceptional,Every single aspect of our stay was 5 star. This hotel has every attribute one expects from a top hotel. The service is friendly and attentive but never overbearing. The food is of the highest standard obviously from the finest quality ingredients. The location is the best in the city. I could not recommend it highly enough.,5,2018,07,27
203,Great location for work lunch !,"Met  here  for work lunch! Efficient staff...& lovely food..
Will be back! just  wish the steak was 'well done', as requested but it came out rare to medium! That was  the only complaint..! very clean & airy room with no loud music which is always a bonus!....",4,2018,07,26
203,The warmest welcome back,"We have had the pleasure of staying at The Westbury several times.  It always delivers.  This trip was the most special.  Our daughter‚Äôs marriage.  Joseph Downing made sure our trip began with a splash.  Thanks Mr. Downing.   Beds are super comfortable, breakfast in the Wilde is always outstanding, the staff is happy and accommodating.  We love The Westbury",5,2018,07,25
203,Exceptional!,"Recently stayed at the Westbury Hotel for 2 nights whilst in Dublin. Beautiful facilities and very welcoming staff.  We were celebrating our honeymoon and staff went above and beyond to make it a special occasion for us - dessert, romantic turndown service etc. Fantastic cocktail bar as well! Perfect, central Dublin location. Would definitely return!",5,2018,07,24
203,Tied and expensive,"We have stay 4 years in a row. Fantastic last 3 times as it‚Äôs a great location. This time air conditioning not working . Door handles fell off in 2 rooms . Charged $550 euro as they full with tourer group and there room rate $290 euro.so good old regular s us had to pay premium rate $235 euro more. We stayed week before and charged $390 euro then 5 days later rate went up $125 euro same room . Not consistent and don‚Äôt seem to recognise loyalty.shame as they have lost 9 persons that‚Äôs how many in our group and we all travel to Dublin yearly
must say staff are fantastic friendly and very helpful the concierge outstanding",2,2018,07,24
203,The Sidecar bar,"What a fantastic atmosphere and service we‚Äôve experienced. Our waitress Iva was truly professional, big smile and provided us with a 5*service. We will definitely recommend and come back. Thank you Iva!",5,2018,07,24
203,Exceptional Service,"Exceptional service, beautiful public spaces & guest room, amazing food & wine and focus on old school kitchen skills like presenting orange supreme at b'fast. We also thoroughly enjoyed the tasting menu at Wilde - a superb fish and seafood based menu with Champagne pairings.",5,2018,07,24
203,Elegance Overload,"I spent Christmas holiday alone in Dublin. I was so worried about being without family but the cab driver from the airport invited me to his home to celebrate with his family. I declined but reluctantly.  The Westbury has a beautiful Champagne dinner for families dressed in all of their finery and celebrating the magi of the season...year after year.  Even though I was alone, I felt welcome.  The hotel staff were especially attentive and brought me all kinds of sweets and treats and cards and presents so I didn't feel lonely.  The room was huge by European standards but. warm and comfortable for me.  Short walk to where ever...I even used the Marks&Spencer market for all my food needs.  Who else has a cranberry turkey sandwich sold only at Christmas?",5,2018,07,23
203,Luxury ,This hotel is in city center. It is clean with friendly service. You can walk to most of the city sites. It has an on site restaurant which includes breakfast. The food was very delicious with much verity. Lots of shopping and restaurants around. It has a wonderful bar. ,5,2018,07,22
203,Perfect ,This hotel has a very good location just in the center of the city . The lobby is very nice. The rooms also very good and the staff is efficient. Everything is really good in this place.

203,Great place for afternoon tea,"We are on a holiday in Dublin,we visited the westbury hotel for afternoon tea. The hotel and lobby area is amazing . Our waitresses Marta and Joshua was always there when we needed and they were always friendly and helpfull.And our hostess Edina explained the afternoon tea menu so passionately. She said the best tea in the hotel is the Grannys garden and she was right ! Everybody need to try the Westbury Afternoon tea at least once in their lifetime !! Amazing !Many Thanks",5,2018,07,21
203,Relaxing  restful break at the Westbury,"My sister and I come to the Westbury once a year for a short break in Dublin.  From the moment we arrive to the moment we leave we enjoy everything about this wonderful hotel. 
The elegance........the relaxed atmosphere created by the staff who are efficient and professional.",5,2018,07,20
203,Great location,"This was a lovely hotel in a great location.  The windows did not open so there was no fresh air. I enjoy fresh air.  

The food and drink were very good.  But the location is the best thing.

I would,staymjere again.

203,Business trip made luxurious,"Excellent weeklong stay at the Westbury while on business in Dublin. I arrived on a Monday morning after a redeye flight to find my room was ready at 11am, and I can't express how thankful I was to not have to wait for hours. Room was appealing in a classic sort of way, and was generally kept clean and well stocked with towels etc. I slept well every night and was sad to leave at the end of my stay!",5,2018,07,19
203,Great location,"We stayed three days in Dublin and found our hotel to be perfectly situated for seeing the city. Very comfortable beds and quiet room. Lovely breakfast. We came when there was a ‚Äúheat wave‚Äù going on, and everywhere, including the hotel, was having a hard time keeping things cool. Would definitely stay again. ",5,2018,07,19

203,Wonderful hotel and amazing location,"My wife and I had a wonderful weekend at the Westbury for our wedding anniversary. The staff could not do enough to make our stay a memorable one. The room was beautiful and remarkably quiet despite the central location.  We had dinner in Wildes Restaurant, the food was superb and the staff were warm and welcoming. It certainly lives up to its name as one of the finest hotels in Dublin. We look forward to our next visit.

203,Wonderful service and great location.,"We arrived very early 6/15, and they secured our luggage,  gave us coffee & juice. Providing us with information and directions we took a few steps onto Grafton street. The location is perfect to see Dublin.The room was spacious and very clean! Breakfast was excellent! The service from everyone  was terrific.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2018,07,16
203,Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon tea in the Westbury today was so enjoyable. Delicious food and unlimited tea and coffee. We had a table over looking Grafton St and from the moment we entered Marta T looked after us and made sure we had a very special day. 
I will definitely be back very soon. Perfect place for a special occasion!",5,2018,07,16
203,Afternoon Tea in The Gallery,"I booked afternoon tea in the Gallery through a loyalty reward I got from the Doyle Collection (truly my favourite chain of hotels). The reward was Afternoon Tea with champagne - absolutely free for both of us as a thanks for the many nights I've stayed with them. Because it was complimentary, I thought they might just give us a table at the back, and we'd get a lesser version of the usual afternoon tea. However, they gave us such a great experience. Truly truly terrific. They sat us in the BEST seats by the window and we had as much tea as we wanted, the waiters were so attentive. I should also say I booked it last minute and they made every effort to accommodate us. We loved it all so much we stayed a very long three hours. Such a treat. I highly recommend. The afternoon tea if you pay for it is indeed on the pricey side. But for special occasions, I would say this is worth it. We didn't want to leave. Thank you, The Westbury, for a fabulous time! We'll be back for sure!",5,2018,07,15
203,Afternoon Delight,"I had booked in for Afternoon Tea at the Westbury for 12.30pm on a busy Saturday afternoon. From start to finish we‚Äôve never experienced service like it before. A massive shoutout to Felicia who was our server, she was very attentive and very informative when it came to the various teas available (Ask for the Japanese Secrets that‚Äôs not on the menu!).

At ‚Ç¨65 per person for the champagne afternoon tea it is slightly on the pricey side but it was worth every cent. After casually mentioning to Felicia that it was for my girlfriends birthday she surprised us by bringing out a small desert with happy birthday written on it to finish off a spectacular visit.",5,2018,07,15
203,"Fantastic location, exceptionally comfortable.","This was the perfect place to stay to rest, get over the jet lag and begin vacation with a fresh start before heading out to the Atlantic Coast for the remainder of the trip.  Though my flight arrived early in the morning and my room was not yet ready, the staff expedited it to have it ready by noon as opposed to 3pm, and were able to provide a late checkout when I overslept (again, jet lag!) the next morning.  It was lovely to sit and have coffee/breakfast and read the paper in the lounge while I waited, before walking about a bit in the city to explore.

The location was fantastic, allowing easy access to Dublin's central attractions without needing to hire a taxi.  Also, despite being adjacent to Grafton Street with lots of street traffic as well as several bars/restaurants with outdoor seating which can get pretty noisy in the evenings, the windows were virtually soundproof (so long as they're closed!  Turn-down staff opened mine and I didn't realize it at first!) so you can get a good night's rest---this can be problematic at some locations, which I found out when I was researching places to stay.  Not many of the accommodations offer air conditioning (it's generally not needed), so if you find yourself in a stuffy room in the middle of a warm spell of weather, opening the window at night is a relief---so long as you're on a quiet street (which may be tough to find in central Dublin).  While the a/c wasn't as cool as I'd prefer, it was certainly more than adequate for keeping the room at a pleasant temperature while the windows were closed.  Also, as a solo traveler, I felt very safe.  

Finally, the room was very comfortable, and the on-site dining facilities provided exceptional service and menus.  The staff were accommodating, personable, and attentive and on the same hospitality level as staff at Fairmont locations where I've frequently stayed in Canada and the US.  

Though a bit pricier for most travelers, I expect, it is a perfect splurge if you're looking to kick off a vacation on the right foot or just want to decompress and have someone else (besides you!) take care of you after a long travel transit or during a long trip.",5,2018,07,15
203,"Nice location, and room","The location was great around the hotel, it was next to some great restaurants, and a little shopping area. The room was very clean, and had a pretty view. The rooms had large, and comfortable beds, with lots of space.",5,2018,07,14
203,Gorgeous hotel with great beds,"We had a very comfortable king room, a great bed, and a fabulous AC Unit...but not much of a view. The AC was key because Dublin was experiencing record high temps the two weeks we were in Ireland. The service at this hotel is excellent. The staff was outstanding in their efforts to accommodate us. The complimentary breakfast was outstanding. I would highly recommend this hotel. The location is great. Any easy walk to Grafton (shopping) and to the theater to see River Dance.",4,2018,07,12
203,Model customer service!,"Sometimes you have a great experience at a hotel  and then sometimes you have a less great experience but it is managed so well, that you leave a hotel with an equally wonderful impression. It was unusually hot in Ireland this month and the room we first were checked into was brutal. Jet lagged and exhausted I called-down to reception and Rory, one of the managers, sorted things out promptly and perfectly. Similarly at both the Sidecar lounge where we enjoyed drinks  and the WILDE where we had breakfast staff went above and beyond. Well located for touring around the city,the hotel is also well suited for families as it has a great sized double room.",5,2018,07,11
203,Very tired hotel but wonderfully located,"If you want to be right in the center of Dublin then this is the right choice as you can walk to most places, shopping, shows, Brown Thomas etc.

But and this is a big one the rooms and the hotel look tired and need a big renovation project. They charge ‚Ç¨450 for a small no fancy twin room and it is not worth the money in my book.

The staff however are friendly, professional and always welcomes you with a smile so you forget the old decor and the small room for a while.

The bar downstairs is nice for a drink, snacks or a last tipple.
Don‚Äôt think I will go back there when I am next in Dublin in September, will try the Merrion.",3,2018,07,10
203,Fantastic Place to Stay in Dublin!,"Our very first stop in Ireland-- we were tired after a long flight and driving in Dublin, and so glad we booked at the Westbury! This hotel is wonderful. Excellent service, start to finish. Kindest staff you'll ever meet--we really felt like they could not do enough for us.  Gorgeous rooms, comfy beds, luxurious bedding. We had dinner in the downstairs restaurant, and it was delicious. Breakfast buffet the next morning was perfect, too. Would love to stay there again. Thank you, Westbury Hotel for making our time in Dublin so lovely!!!!",5,2018,07,10
203,Luxury service and the best bed i have ever slept in,"We stayed in a luxury studio suite for 1 night on the 1st of July. 

Our suite was way bigger than I had expected with views across the city and big comfortable armchairs to collapse in. 

I love the DNA of Doyle Collection hotels anyway, i'stayed in all three of their London outposts through work and they all live up to the hype. I love their general aesthetic; it's comfortable luxury with a modern twist. All rooms are set up with plentiful sockets, usb ports, a powerful hairdryer and a nespresso machine - the essentials - but also tasty treats when you arrive, a chocolate on the pillow and free bottled water which is replenished daily.

I'd wanted to visit this hotel for a while now having a read a review of their 1930's fine dining restaurant WILDE. I'd also seen on social media that Taylor Swift had stayed there two weeks prior, (i think it has quite a reputation for hosting celebrities) although when I asked the bell-boy about her he neither confirmed or denied that was true. 

Pre-dinner cocktails in The Sidecar bar is a must. The head waiter looks a bit like Daniel Craig and will wheel out a Martini trolley and create you the ultimate SATC cocktail while you watch. I loved that we were served free 'taster' cocktails while we explored the menu and the bar snacks are next level.

We dined in WILDE that evening and it was every bit as fabulous as I had hoped. Marble tables, big green velvet sofas and on our visit there was an installation of flowers flanking the terrace windows which looked fab. I ordered a bottle of Whispering Angel ros√© which the waiter ensured my glass was topped up regularly and we hoovered fish of the day (dover sole) followed by a selection of desserts which we shared. The food is exquisite and european with a twist. I recommend booking a table by the large terrace windows - great people watching territory.

Next day we had an organised tour with Fab Food Trails. We met our tour guide in Balfe's after a full english breakfast (order the black pudding it is exceptional). She was fantastic and created an itinerary bespoke to our tastes. The tour we took was on foot and included some quintessential fashion boutiques - I recommend visiting 'Stable of Ireland for hand spun linens, Parfumarija for niche perfumes and just opposite there Paula Rowan gloves who we learned makes costume gloves for the likes of Madonna, Gwen Stefani and Lady Gaga. We also got to experience 'Klaw' on Temple Bar which is the kind of crab shack/oyster bar that needs to be seen to be believed. We were served fresh oysters and salmon toasts washed down with wine. Our tour finished at Trinity College not far from the hotel. In fact the hotel location is walking distance central to everything. Next door is Louis Vuitton and so it goes.

Overall we had the most incredible experience at this hotel and I probably wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin as a consequence.",5,2018,07,10
203,"First class, great location","Outstanding rooms and service. Buffet service was good, with nice options, although the servers were a bit busy, and could be more attentive. From the hotel you can walk right down to the main walking street (Grafton).",4,2018,07,09
203,Five star all the way,Can‚Äôt imagine there‚Äôs a better place to stay when in Dublin. The  friendly staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. The restaurant was excellent and room was superb.  Excellent location too... Highly recommend.,5,2018,07,09
203,The best experience I've ever had at a hotel,i can't say enough of how great my stay was. Everything was done to such a high level that I will now compare all future hotel stays to this one because the bar was set that high. The professionalism and friendliness of the staff as well as the building and room themselves made this an amazing trip. ,5,2018,07,09
203,Anniversary ,"So we stayed here for our second anniversary, and I cannot recommend this place enough. From check in to check out we were treated like royalty. It was everything that you would expect from a 5* hotel and more. It was the little extras that really made it for us. We booked afternoon tea and staff (especially Steve) made it an experience to remember. We were seated at the best table in house, with a beautiful view of Grafton street due of the occasion. We really cannot recommend this place enough. ",5,2018,07,09
203,It‚Äôs really a 3+ star hotel,"Great location. Very good bar and restaurant. Beautiful lobby area.

However we had to pay ‚Ç¨30 extra for 2 beds. We didn‚Äôt get the breakfast because we booked on hotels.com (out travelling partners did). The fitness facility was very poor (it‚Äôs 2018 for God‚Äôs sake, have a decent gym). Also, we waited for 20 mins to check-in due to a line up and only 2 receptionists but concierge just sat there watching instead of helping. Finally, I couldn‚Äôt get a response to several calls to bellman‚Äôs desk.

All in all, not worth ‚Ç¨490/night. It‚Äôs really a 3+ star hotel.

",3,2018,07,09
203,Poorly trained staff and small rooms,"Let me preface this by saying that my family owned a hotel in the same Fine Hotels group for years, so I have A LOT of experience with this type of property.
When you go into the hotel, the entry is a floor below reception. We asked the woman manning the downstairs desk where the elevator was, and she said it was only for guests. When we explained that we were checking in (hence the bags), she seemed stymied, then said we'd have to carry them up the stairs ourselves. We late discovered that there was an elevator ten feet to our left that we should have been allowed to use.
The room itself was mediocre. Visitors should know that this property is a block away from what is essentially Dublin's version of Disneyland; if you're into that, this is the place for you. If you want to stay somewhere that's not thronging with tourists and noise, not so much.
After checking in, we asked the concierge to help us with dinner at an Indian place. He recommended one, and offered to call to make a reservation. A full hour later, as we were heading out the door to the restaurant, he called back and said he couldn't get a reservation for us there. Then he hung up (!) No offer of finding an alternative, or of helping in any way. We ended up finding a lovely Nepalese place ourselves (Monty's) but  still. We also asked if he could help us get tickets to the Kilmainheim Gaol the next day; he said they were fully booked. I went online out of curiosity, and immediately got 2 tickets for a tour the next day (which was probably the best part of our stay in Dublin; not to be missed!) 
Breakfast was really poor for this level of hotel, the Irish porridge was downright Dickensian (not in a good way), the Chia pudding was inedible; really, everything we ate in the hotel was just bad.",2,2018,07,08
203,Simply The Best,"We stayed in room 607. A suite beautifully appointed. The staff in the hotel was top-notch. Professional and knowledgeable. The restaurants and bars superb. Balfe, Lounge Bar and Wilde great!  If you're lucky enough to be in the capable hands of Guest-Relations Manager Aleksandra Puskaric, sit back and enjoy the experience, because you then will understand what 5-star service is.",5,2018,07,08
203,business trip,"Great location, rooms could be bigger though. nice hotel not a 5 star though. Staff was great and very helpful. Close to everything, food was not overpriced and good selection. Afternoon tea was worth the price.",5,2018,07,07
203,Blended Let Down,"I have spent the past week pondering over this review.  I am trying to pinpoint what was wrong & how it can be rectified as I truly love The Westbury. I have stayed at this wonderful 5* hotel & reviewed it on a number of previous occasions but my latest 3 night stay was a let down. By way of background I booked with the hotel website & prepaid the full amount. I was unable to submit the Guest Feedback Sheet i received so I emailed the hotel & requested Room 633 having stayed there before.  I asked the hotel to note that i am a light sleeper specifically referencing that air conditioning units on nearby hotel rooftops was a no no. Yes, it's a city centre hotel but one would expect that Reception staff should know which rooms are 'quieter' than others. On arrival there were no doormen present, as has been on previous visits, but once we had taken our luggage out of the car a uniformed young man appeared & cheerfully took the car. We brought our luggage in & walked over to the ground floor lifts. Luckily we  knew what to do & where to go as there was no one to greet us. There were 3 beautifully uniformed girls clustered around the computer desk downstairs chatting among themselves engrossed on their phones, completely oblivious to us. While they were wearing Westbury uniforms I am 'assuming' they were actually working with the general check ins as they did not appear to be in 'work mode'. From previous visits I knew that we needed a hotel swipe card to access the lift up to Reception on the first floor - we interrupted the group to request same. The girl I asked looked at me 'blankly'. I persisted as I knew what I needed but from her reaction I could have easily assumed that I was in the wrong. She went off looking for a member of the concierge team & a gentleman arrived to swipe his card & allow us access to the lift.  Terrible first impression - completely underwhelming. Having arrived at this beautiful 5* hotel after a long drive full of anticipation & excitement we felt ignored. On to Reception where Muhammad checked us in. We found Room 633 & we were happy to unpack & finally relax.We went out to dinner arriving back to a wonderful surprise! There was a plate with a selection of desserts with a welcome note from the General Manger welcoming us & offering to look after our every need.  This was a lovely touch & we really enjoyed our treat.  Then we settled down for a great night's  sleep.  Well ... We now know that the  A/C units are located on the rooftops outside Room 633. These units shut down at 11.45 pm & restart at 5.00 am. Yes I was awoken at 5.00 am - I emailed the Guest Relations manager. Jack was efficient in his response & asked us to pack our bags & he would allocate us a different room later in the day. Breakfast was wonderful with wide selection of buffet and hot breakfasts befitting a 5* hotel. We packed up our bags & had a lovely day in Dublin. The Westbury is in such a great location right in the center of Dublin City. On our return Alexandra of Guest Relations accompanied us to our newly assigned bedroom. She turned on our room air conditioning, checked that we were happy mentioning that some of the A/C units were being relocated & it had been an issue.  She left.  When I looked out the window I realized that we were on the same side of the hotel just on a lower floor now nearer than ever to the A/C units located on the nearby roof tops. I turned off our own room air conditioning & I could hear the 'vrooom' - to be honest I really couldn't understand why we had been reallocated to this particular bedroom given the noise issue.  I rang Reception & arranged to meet Alexandra on the 4th floor. She showed me room 409 & arranged for the concierge to move our luggage again. This room was quiet & we stayed there for the remaining 2 nights. The bedroom facilities are good but this bedroom was more 'rundown' than 633. The bathroom tiles were cracked up near the shower head & it looked 'tired'. There were lovely toiletries, plenty of fluffy towels (including face clothes), weighing scales, really luxurious linen & duvet & pillows . However, there was no pillow menu or pillow spray. Whatever are you talking about you may ask. The previous night we had stayed in a 4* hotel which had a pillow menu & sleep pillow spray, complimentary bottles of water & welcome box of Irish handmade chocolates - I was really impressed as it was 'only' a 4* hotel so I suppose my expectations for The Westbury were high given it is a 5* hotel with 5* prices attached. Anyway let's look for more good stuff. The bed was SO comfortable & there were slippers & luxurious toweling robes plus Nespresso coffee machine, kettle, alovely selection of crystal glasses, magazines, complimentary bottles of water however there was no trouser press & the luggage rack was missing from the wardrobe - also noted by Ashley the concierge.  The Turn-down service is nice with complimentary Lily O'Brien choc &  the hotel's commitment to conserving water & to the preservation of the environment is commendable. To sum up let me say that this hotel has a wonderful location & the capacity to provide a 5* service. However, the staff are not all of 5* standard. Jen, possibly the worst member of staff I have encountered at the Westbury or any hotel ever, greeted us for breakfast with a growl then brought us a table in the darkest corner of the dining room from which we immediately asked to move - there were lots of empty tables. From her facial expression it appeared that she was not happy about this yet grudgingly moved us to the conservatory area. She then 'pitched' the menus on the table. She asked if we had stayed here before & when we said 'Yes we had', she said 'sure you know what to do so' turned on her heel & left. We then waited too long for someone to take our order. There was adequate staffing but no one seemed to know what's going on...  The predominant attitude of serving staff was it seemed to be a bother to serve us (with the exception of the blonde girl in the suit jacket  who was lovely the morning she greeted & seated us). The menu is extensive & food is excellent. Check out with Rory was a delight & our car was returned to us with a smile. So if I had to sum up my experience I would say the key issue is the staff - not all staff but key staff who are not up to standard. Facial expressions, body language, the non verbal language that speaks louder than words. Cead Mile Failte is the welcome and level of service that I expect but that I did not experience. My suggestion is that all staff regroup & ask themselves 'why are we here?' Then moving forward choose the verbal & non verbal language that leaves every guest dreaming dreams of their next visit to The Westbury with 5* in all aspects of it's service & delivery of same.",3,2018,06,30
203,Incredible stay!,"My husband and I took a beautiful trip to Europe in early June to celebrate our 10th anniversary - which included a three night stay at The Westbury in Dublin. (Our travel agent recommended the property, and she was spot on!) Of all hotels during our multi-city vacation, this was by far our favorite! The staff went above and beyond for us and the thoughtful touches to make our stay (and anniversary) memorable were fantastic. A special thank you to John at concierge for emailing with me and  arranging for a rental car for us last minute so that we could drive to the Cliffs of Moher!
We will absolutely return, and now seek out The Doyle collection whenever traveling. Thank you!",5,2018,06,30
203,Just out for the evening,"I like the Westbury, good staff. However, the hotel quality is declining on every visit. I like to treat myself from time to time with a few ouster‚Äôs. on this occasion they where serve warm not cold. I had to send them back. This is not a five star hotel.
",1,2018,06,30
203,Very nice hotel - best location,"We have stayed in central Dublin before and this is our favorite hotel. best location of any of the nicer hotels, and the service and level of finish is fantastic. the hotel has a great feel to it - when it is mid afternoon the main floor is very active with a great tea and cocktail service. the location right on Grafton Street and close to Trinity, Stephens Green, etc., makes this the ideal location. highly recommend this hotel over others.",5,2018,06,29
203,Dublin,"I had great stay at the Westbury Hotel in Dublin.  Wish I had more time.  It is located in the heart of Dublin, easy to get around.  Hotel has great service and very friendly staff.  When I go back I would stay at the Westbury Hotel.",5,2018,06,28
203,Good Location to See the Center,"Really good location just off of Grafton St. about halfway between Trinity College and St Stephen's Green. Access to the hop on/hop off buses is just around the corner. There is access off of Claradon St. that is easy to miss if you're not looking for it. This entrance is also where you will pick up a cab if you need it. 
The front desk staff and concierge were extremely helpful in offering suggestions for places to see and places to eat.
The room was immaculate. This is white glove treatment the whole way. The water pressure in the shower is a little on the weaker side. The one downside is you will pay for the service and cleanliness.",4,2018,06,27
203,Afternoon Tea Glee at the Westbury !!,"If you'er planning a trip to Dublin, you should give some thought to visiting this fine establishment. Set right in the heart of Dublin's finest shopping district, its perfectly placed for your stay, or for sure you should at least book their afternoon tea for a really deserved break from the bargain shopping chaos....it will prepare you well for round 2 post afternoon!!!
Its a bit pricey, ‚Ç¨50pp, ‚Ç¨65pp with a huge glass of Champagne but I can assure you, it is well worth the price for the following reasons...
Firstly, its the Westbury!! You cannot get finer in Dublin City...even Taylor Swift and her crew agree ( she was a recent guest when she played 2 nights in Croke Park Stadium )...and she sure looked refreshed for her 2nd gig...
You will be surrounded by beautiful interiors, soft lighting and music and the most wonderful of staff. We were served by the wonderful Marta, who took such good care of us, and organised a childrens afternoon tea for our littlest party member...making her feel really special. 
Our likes and dislikes were attended to with no problems and we were refilled as we desired with the most wonderful selection of teas. I tried the Irish whiskey cream tea...you should for sure order this, it is just delicious, and in reality, where are you going to get this again....life is too short to drink ordinary tea!!!
Im sure all the servers are equally as good as Marta, but if you are lucky enough to have her serving you, you will for sure feel very special indeed. 
You will see from the photos what AT looks like...its a feast to the eyes. Everything was meticulously finished. The pastry chefs really take pride in what they produce. They all taste as good as they look. Anything you dont finish they parcel in the most beautiful carry box for you to have at home later. 
I really cannot recommend this experience enough. It can be fairly booked up so if possible I would suggest booking in advance if you want to be assured of a table for a terrific tea-time treat!üíñ",5,2018,06,27
203,Great location ,The Westbury is right in the city centre - great location & lovely friendly staff - it's needing a bit of an upgrade I think  - air conditioning was poor although they brought a fan to the room - WiFi's also poor but we had a nice stay in Dublin it's a great place to visit ,4,2018,06,27
203,Just for drinks,"Six people meeting up for drinks before heading out on the town. Ages varying between 25 and 60 .. no better place than the Westbury. Service very good, fabulous ambiance, friendly atmosphere and drinks to suit all ages.. probably, no
.. definitely the place we always end up in dublin",5,2018,06,24
203,Perfect location in the center of the city. ,Arrived very early in the morning and was pleasantly surprised they had our room ready for us. Which was fantastic after a 7 hr overnight flight. The location is perfect just feet away from Grafton street where we found lots of interesting shops. It was very refreshing to see mostly small local shops instead of the chain stores you see in every mall in the US. Ate at Wilde for breakfast and also dinner. Everything we had was fantastic. Hotel device and wait staff where all superb.Great place to stay in the city. 5 stars. ,5,2018,06,24
203,Drinks in the city,"One of my favourite hotels in Dublin City.
The Terrace is a lovey place for a quiet drink or you can go to their cocktail bar which is classy too. The seating is superb and the staff are probably the best around.
A great place for a drink if you‚Äôre in the city.
Wilde Restaurant is fabulous.",4,2018,06,24
203,Excellent hotel with wonderful location!,"The hotel was fabulous but I was almost as enthralled with the superb location, right off Grafton Street! It is within easy walking distance of Trinity College and many great Dublin landmarks. The hotel itself is lovely with great service and amenities. I would recommend not paying more for ""front view"" as it was just buildings.",5,2018,06,22
203,A Great Hotel,"A luxury hotel in the heart of Dublin. We arrived early and our room was not ready. The staff apologized profusely and offered us drinks, etc.  The staff was highly professional and catered to its clientele. American Express handled our reservation that included a daily breakfast and a dinner at the hotel that was superb. We had an exellent stay at a excellent hotel.",5,2018,06,22
203,A Great Combination of Comfort and Luxury,"Stayed at The Westbury before embarking on a British Isles Cruise out of Dublin.  Great way to start the vacation.  This Hotel was perfect for us, location, decor, comfort and most of all, the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff.  We would book and stay again when the opportunity presents itself in the future. ",5,2018,06,21
203,Life saver!,"We originally booked a different hotel in Dublin, at 4 am when the club that seemed to be inside my hotel room was still going strong, I looked on line and thank goodness the Westbury had a hotel room available.  First thing in the morning we moved to the Westbury.  The staff was so welcoming and friendly.  They stored our bags, placed them in our room as soon as it was ready and sent me a text as soon as the room was available.   My husband and I were out touring the city.  The rest of our stay was excellent. They have great bell staff, front desk, concierge and housekeeping staff.  I would stay there again the next time I‚Äôm in Dublin.  And the best part. The rooms are quiet and the bed is heavenly!",5,2018,06,20
203,love love love,"This place was beautiful. The staff was so nice. I want to go back every day. Our room was small, but we got the ""cheap"" $360 room by the elevator. We were there for the first 3 days of our honeymoon and they did not disappoint! We got chocolates on our pillow, kind notes, and just, ugh, it was so nice! It was also a ""heat wave"" for Ireland when we were there and the AC was working wonderfully. The concierge was so friendly, even when I asked them 30,000 questions. They helped us book a few reservations and gave us great suggestions overall. I didn't want to leave. Also, Britney Spears stayed here so...bonus points. I only wish we had done their afternoon tea as well.",5,2018,06,19
203,"Nothing special, impossible to drive to!","I booked via TripAdvisor for 2 adults and 2 children, but was told a day before they couldn‚Äôt accommodate us in one double room and therefore we‚Äôd need to get two. We did, but finding the hotel driving into the crazy streets of Dublin was SO difficult. Painfully so. The air was broken in one of our rooms and a toilet had issues as well. Certainly not what I‚Äôd expect paying $800/ night. We stayed in a place for less than $200 the following night that was nicer. ",3,2018,06,19
203,Exceptional hotel and high tea,I cannot imagine a better location in Dublin. Steps to Grafton street. A few more to temple bar. Loads to see and do. Friendly staff. Good sized rooms plus walk-in closet. The high tea was wonderful. Ecaterina our hostess was thoughtful and kind. The price was great for the level of service and quality. ,5,2018,06,19
203,Best hotel ever,"The Westbury is the very definition of a classy, upscale hotel. I loves staying there. They have a beautiful afternoon tea, friendly and helpful staff, and the hotel itself is gorgeous. 

When we got tea, I had never had it before and our waitress took the time to explain it to me and recommend teas she thought I would like (she made GREAT recommendations). Also, when she found out it was our honeymoon, she gave us a piece of congratulatory cake. 

Due to some abrupt changes in our travel plans, we had to stay in the Westbury on two separate occasions in the same trip. There was two days between our first stay and our second stay. The staff remembered us. That‚Äôs not usual for hotel staff, since they meet so many people. They were SO personable and friendly. 

Also, their inclusive breakfast was AMAZING! They had a buffet and a menu. This hotel definitely deserved five stars and when we come back to Dublin, we‚Äôll stay there. ",5,2018,06,19
203,"Super Front Desk Staff, Tasteful, Calming Rooms","TommyZ and Joseph on Reception were so warm and kind, taking the time to firstly fix my phone (thank you Tommy!) and then discuss where we'd get the best experiences for our trip to the capital. They were a font of information and really helped us plan our short stay. The rooms were tastefully decorated with views of the city - depending where you are. The hotel is right in the middle of the action, but the excellent double glazing ensures you don't hear any outside noise. There are a number of food outlets, we haven't had a chance to try them yet.",5,2018,06,17
203,Wedding Night,"Very pleasant stay, staff very attentive and accomodating. Decor is ageing slightly in the rooms but faultless service level really made the hotel stand out. Breakfast was plentiful and the front lounge area is beautiful.",4,2018,06,17
203,Second visit,"I have chosen to write a second review as my first stay had encountered some issues.  I am glad to say the management do listen to the reviews.

Room was much better this time including more space and better water pressure in the shower.  This may have been a room issue last time.

The breakfast restaurant was better managed and staff were very attentive.  Food was again delicious but the staff were always present and helpful.

Bellhop‚Äôs and front door staff are the hotels best asset.  They help with anything and go beyond every time.

Bar staff again our some of the best and can make any drink.

I would recommend for business if in Dublin ",4,2018,06,17
203,"Very Nice Hotel, Top Quality Staff ","We had a very nice stay at the Westbury. The location is perfect for those wishing to wander around Dublin on foot or perhaps grab the hop-on-hop-off bus. For Thin Lizzy fans, the Phil Lynott statue is about a hundred feet outside the hotel door. Lots of pubs and restaurants nearby. About a ten minute walk to Trinity College and maybe 15 to the Temple Bar area. Also not too far from the famous Brazen Head pub, supposedly the oldest pub in Ireland, dating to 1198.

There was some construction going on outside the front door, making for some noise and awkward detouring, but this will certainly be short lived. 

The room was very nice, but had a few signs of wear and tear. Broken castor on our easy chair made it impossible to move, tub wouldn‚Äôt drain, broken latch on bedroom door, bathroom door insisted on opening by itself if not shut all the way. Stuff like that. Nothing too serious. They fixed the tub very promptly.

The staff more than made up for any room problems. Very nice and totally professional people. Very 5 star. The management, desk, and bell staff were great. The maintenance guy ditto. The manager had come up to personally apologize and make sure the room issues got fixed properly, which they were. Very professional, nice young man. My girlfriend travels a lot and has stayed in many high end hotels, and she was very impressed. 

The dining room at WILDE was nice. An excellent dinner was covered by an AmEx credit. Breakfasts there also included in our package. Food was good. The service was quite good, though there were a few language gap issues with the non Irish waitstaff. But ultimately respectful an pleasant.

The service out in the lounge was another matter, and did not measure up quite so well. Sat waiting for a second drink and snack for close to 30 minutes trying to get the waitress‚Äôs attention. But there was a nice (soft) jazz band playing that made the experience much more pleasant. 

All in all a very nice hotel. I‚Äôd certainly go back on my next trip to Dublin.",4,2018,06,15
203,5 Star perfection,"As a regular client,I have always been greeted with exceptional service and valued as a perfect customer. Evert inch a first class Hotel. Ideal location and perfect for all attractions of Dublin City.",5,2018,06,14
203,Hospitality culture & Management M.I.A.,"After having just landed in Dublin from our overnight flight, we arrived at the hotel around 9 am, ready to check-in.Expectedly, we were told that the room was not ready so we kindly asked to be advised via txt when ready and clean l while we went on to take a morning walk around town.
By 11 am, back at the hotel, the front desk started repeating the same standard speech without prior update with cleaning crew , announcing that they would try and possibly get a status from housekeeping some time later ( sic).. After another hour in the lobby around noon, I finally requested to speak to management: a ‚Äúguest relation manager‚Äù came, not to listen but to administer the standard ""check-in time"" speech without even bothering to hear specifics. When I suggested that we should at this point be offered  an alternative , superior room option & rate or that maybe the cleaning crew could be reprioritized, same standard script was repeated. At the same minute, we were advised by another party that the room had suddenly become available.
What is the saddest and worst in this instance is not merely the fact that the room was likely ready & clean earlier- not all guest wait to leave their room all at the same time- and that the front desk agent seemed to hesitate to inconvenience the cleaning crew with some ridiculous customer request for update ! It is the attitude and response from a so-called ‚Äùguest relation"" manager: not only was he speaking generically-without any specific fact or knowledge of the case- and with utter condescendence rather than empathy, he went further to suggest that we should have booked the room for the night before our flight arrival to address the problem‚Ä¶!  (another $ 350 for a few hours ?)
Then, adding insult to injury, when I asked him to have the general manager contact me later, he snapped back that the G.M. would ‚Äúprobably not be able to do that‚Äù: -not even pretending to try and check with his schedule, he just plainly let me know that there was basically not a chance that a G.M. could possibly speak to a dissatisfied guest like me‚Ä¶
Not only have we always been offered the basic respect and opportunity to talk face to face about our experience with a G.M. of leading hotels such as a Peninsula in Hong Kong, St Regis in New York or the Oberoi in Udaipur during our many travels around the world, never have we met such idiotic response & spiteful sense of Customer experience: if rules of check-in and check -out are pretty well known by the most average traveler, the most basically trained front desk agent or manager always tries to check if any special arrangement or reprioritization is available, esp. for a high capacity hotel in a country capital ‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt even bother referencing my Platinum Amex status as it was clear in that instance that premium service has always been replaced by a standard script for a staff that should not feel the need to even try and accommodate special requests or possibly disrupt their standard routine‚Ä¶
Additionally and not surprisingly, the overall design & d√©cor of the hotel and the superior room that we stayed in were lacking the most basic warmth, the TV had  very few channels available (only 1 American network, no CNN or MSNBC..) and most of the 20+ channels had quite poor signal reception‚Ä¶
The bathroom had surprising signs of aging for plumbing with rust and cracks for an hotel that looks like a relatively new construction (see pics attached). All of that at a nightly rate of $350 for a ""luxury"" room in Dublin seems quite unacceptable. The only real positive that I can see for this establishment is their central location‚Ä¶
The fact that an hotel G.M. would make a basic & clear standard or not even conceive of hearing a customer experience directly from one of his guest says a lot about the overarching culture of management & hospitality that he is supposed to inspire and represent  for its parent company, the Doyle Collection.
This crew obviously feel that they are allowing you to stay there and that the everyday standard procedures in any given situation are tantamount. Not trying to find ways to adapt, assess a situation and possibly try to accommodate a special request.
This is the opposite of a culture of hospitality and customer centricity that is so important to most successful Luxury hotel brands at global level -most of them where we have experienced with total satisfaction, from Ritz Carlton to Peninsula, St Regis, Four Seasons or Westin - understand so well and strive to deliver and improve everyday‚Ä¶
This is also a clear lack of poor hiring and management skills when a dedicated ‚Äúguest relation manager‚Äù should if anything, embody the ultimate customer advocate and guardian of the quality of customer satisfaction. Rather than the a condescending attitude and empathy of a robot..If anything, the guy barely belongs in the accounting back office or F&B stocking room.
I am surprised that the Doyle Collection or Leading Hotels of the World would associate their name with this type of day to day operations: either they don‚Äôt know what local management is doing or they have long given up on superior customer experience quality and any kind of global ranking in the leading hospitality industry that they boast on their website. In either case, it‚Äôs also a failure from their part that reflect poorly on their own brand equity , which we all  know can cost a lot in the long term beyond a reported case like mine...",2,2018,06,14
203,The staff try hard but the hotel is chaotic ,"See the pictures and judge for your self. Does this deserve a 5 star category? I had a trolley in front of my room all day long. The corridors looked like a warehouse. It was 4pm and my room was not cleaned yet. The breakfast order was forgotten.
Positive point: staff was very polite but not able to cope with the challenges it faced.",2,2018,06,14
203,First Class Elegance,"Our travel agent recommended The Westbury and it exceeded our expectations!
Location is perfect - shopping, easy walk to Trinity College to view the Book of Kells, great bars, a lot of food choices. The concierges on staff are brilliant - maps, advice, etc. Try the Sidecar Bar located in the hotel - easy to relax  & drinks are top notch. Morning breakfasts are lovely.  This hotel is the BEST.",5,2018,06,13
203,Class hotel and staff............,"Five star from the moment we checked in. Room was not ready and we were brought to the bar for complimentary cocktails!!!! It started with a glass of prosecco, followed by our cocktails. My wife was celebrating a birthday and a piece of cake was brought to the bar also, totally unexpected. The staff could not have been more friendly or professional. Ms Puskaric looked after us so well. It was a great introduction to the hotel.
Lovely hotel, no pomp but really customer friendly. Top class in every respect.",5,2018,06,11
203,Exceptional Vacation Experience,"My wife and I recently visited Ireland 6/1- 6/8. We stayed here and it was a very pleasant experience. Great staff all around exceptional service and outstanding food. Spotless rooms. We thoroughly enjoyed our entire time there. Thank you again and we are already planning our trip to come back next year for 2 weeks this time, instead of 1 .",5,2018,06,11
203,Fabulous Hotel,"One of the highlights of our trip to Ireland were the accommodations at the Westbury Hotel.  The location is superb since it's an easy walk to great shopping and restaurants that offer the cuisine of your choice.   The room was spacious and updated and very comfortable.  
The lobby area was unbelievable.  It was HUGE with small vignettes for just drinks or a light bite.  The staff couldn't have been nicer.  
There is a lower floor bar / restaurant area which we didn't sit but overtime we walked but their was a fun buzz.  
Special shout out to the manager Jack who was so accommodating and helpful.
Thanks Jack!",5,2018,06,10
203,Luxurious stay in a beautiful section of Dublin,"The exceptional service at the Westbury was displayed the moment we stepped out of our taxi and was helped with our luggage.  Everyone we encountered after that was friendly, helpful and made us feel welcomed.  The hotel is beautiful and within walking distance of great shopping, food and attractions. The hotel is a little pricey but worth every penny!",5,2018,06,10
203,"Westbury, great hotel1","BEAUTIFUL is not enough. This hotel has great staff and fantastic amenities. We were welcomed to our room by 5 delicious petit fours. Everything from the sheets on the bed to the toiletries in the bathroom all spoke highly of the attention to detail this hotel is so famous for. I wish we could have stayed longer, but it was the best part of a great vacation that ended far too soon.",5,2018,06,07
203,5 star Class Act,"We stayed as a couple for a few days off. From reception to the concierge the staff could not have been more helpful. Had a minor problem with our room, the Guest Relations Manager was amazing, sorted it all out with such ease and professionalism ""Thank You"". Excellent room and bathroom with all the necessary accouterments, great view from the room. Dining experience was equally good with very nice food and wine for dinner, the breakfast was a very pleasant start to the day. We have  recommended the Westbury to so many friends since from the US and Europe. Keep up the great team work, the Westbury is a standard to be admired and enjoyed.",5,2018,06,07
203,Wasn't impressed with the room for the price,"I've stayed at some of the top hotels in different countries and The Westbury was nice with great, helpful staff, but it was a little pretentious and the rooms were pretty blah.
The room was actually freezing upon entering as the AC was turned down way too low and was fairly small with a view of a couple of brick walls.
The lobby was nice, but we were told we had to go into the bar when we said we would just be having drinks and they then attempted to sit us in a table by the doors until we insisted on one of the empty other tables, there were people dressed in jeans in there and we were better dressed, so it wasn't anything to do with our appearance, so it was a little odd.
Overall it was a great location which is really what you're paying for and I'd give it 3.5 our of 5 stars, I would probably look around for somewhere with a better room for ‚Ç¨420 a night next time.",3,2018,06,04

203,A Treat For Family And Friends.,"The following review is well over due. I have had afternoon tea on three occasions in the Gallery since Christmas 2017. Christmas afternoon tea is a wonderful experience as the Westbury is decorated beautiful and there is a lovely atmosphere around, the chefs really do give the afternoon tea a Christmas theme with different decoration's on the pastries, they are a work of art and taste like more. I returned again in January for my friends birthday which she really enjoyed, as it was my friends birthday the pastry chef sent out a lovely slice of cake on a plate with happy birthday we where full from afternoon tea so the girl boxed it up to take home, lovely touch from the staff. My self and my sister had lunch in the Gallery Sunday the 27th of May 2018 and again we where not disappointed, we loved our chicken curry and the Blueberry Cr√®me Brulee was just divine complements to the chefs. All the staff are so welcoming, friendly and efficient in their service and provide good customer care. As a real treat  for my friend I have booked a overnight stay in July to enjoy a sleep over and breakfast.

203,Great place,"I‚Äôm a big fan of this hotel , the service is always good and the cocktails at the sidecar bar are worth the money. Adrian the bartender made our night , we got complementary olives and a nice birthday cake , hidden gem in Dublin !

203,Amazing afternoon tea,"I was invited to partake in afternoon tea with my sister at her place of work in Dublin on my first visit to Dublin.
The hotel was called ‚Äúthe Westbury‚Äù which was situated just off the busy Grafton Street shopping district.
Let me just start off by saying ‚ÄúAMAZING‚Äù, I have never been for afternoon tea, so I may not be in a position to say how good it is to other establishments, but I can‚Äôt see myself ever being spoilt with such delightful food, drink, views and most importantly service.
The food come out and I was taken aback with how beautifully it was presented, and boy did it taste as good as it looked.
The whole experience was heightened by the amazing service we received off the servers, Anastasia, Marta and Saoirse treated us like royalty, our cups were never empty, our cake stand seemed to just be full with all sorts of sandwiches and fine cakes, and always with a smile and great knowledge of everything they brought us, from tea to scones they seemed to know everything.
So thank you Westbury and the staff for giving me such a wonderful experience and making me feel special on my recent visit.

203,Brilliant hotel in the heart of the city,"Our visit to the Westbury was perfect from start to finish.  When we arrived we had our car parked for us and straight through to reception where we received a very good welcome.  Our room was really nice - very clean, everything we needed, decent toiletries, very good bed and bed linen.  We spent some time in each of the hotel bars after a busy day in Dublin - very relaxing and staff were very good/very attentive.
Breakfast next morning was superb, such a wonderful choice, again attentive staff and in a beautiful setting. Car brought round to the front of the hotel for us when we were leaving - a very hassle free stay!  Would love to stay here again.",5,2018,06,02
203,The Perfect Place to Start a stay in Ireland,"We spent two days and two nights at The Westbury Hotel. It was the perfect place to start our Irish vacation.

And the food at the Hotel is wonderful. I would highly recommend it!!",5,2018,06,01
203,Excellant Hotel to expereince Dublin from,"An excellent hotel with superb hospitality.  It's location is perfect to experience all that Dublin offers.  Near Temple Bar area, museums, and tourist assist locations.  Two great pubs right out its front door (may get noisy if window open), and Molly Malone statue around the corner (Where most bus tour packages round up to start).  One note: ",5,2018,06,01
203,"Just lovely, location perfect","A perfect hotel from which to base your stay in Dublin.  The location is fantastic, near everything, the staff is friendly, helpful and professional.  They truly go the extra mile.  Breakfast is outstanding.  Beds are comfortable and the restaurant Wilde was the best meal we had in Dublin, and we had very good meals.",5,2018,05,31
203,Not coming back...,"Well... to begin with, its is expensive considering what it offers. The air in our room wasn't working (it was SO HOT), and they reported a problem in tge bathroom that was totally ignored.
The breakfast waa rather poor, in a nice area but... and geeee the coffee took FOR EVER! We had to ask for it at least twice and it would come AFTER our food. Coffe is what you serve first for god sake...",3,2018,05,31
203,"Beautiful Hotel, perfect location.","We stayed in a family room at the end of a hallway.  It was peaceful, clean and very large.  The children still have the westbury bears and colored pencils that they gave us in the room a year ago.  The hotel had a charm that I enjoyed.   The breakfast was delicious and appreciated by the whole family.  We would return to Westbury in a heartbeat.  My 5 and 8 year old loved it.",5,2018,05,31
203,Beautiful Hotel with Excellent Location,"Stay for one night over the weekend while traveling in Ireland.  Beautiful hotel with a great location.  Staff is very professional and attentive.  Great bar/sitting area for people watching and conversation.  Breakfast was included in our rate and it was lovely.  You could order off the menu which is nice.  Only downside to our stay was the air conditioning unit didn't work and they brought us a fan.  It was rather warm and I would have thought we would have been offered a room change.  The bathroom was nice but small for the size of the room.  Didn't care for the amenities (soap, shampoo, etc.) otherwise it's a great hotel",4,2018,05,30
203,"Convenient location, comfortable room","Stayed here for 4 nights with my husband, who was on business. Our room was comfortable, with everything you needed.  The air conditioning worked great and the curtains helped with the sun and heat.  My only complaint was the shower constantly changed from cold to hot.  Once, I got burnt on my back it was so bad.  We did bring it up to the check in desk, who offered a free drink.... maintenance was supposed to have fixed it, but it happened another day.  This time with frigid water.  Management spoke with us on check out and have offered a suite upgrade the next time we go.  We will go back, as we enjoy the Sidecar and Balfes bars and also the location to Grafton Street.

Superb.
Venue  delightful  as always.
TWO hours of fun family & friends. Gifts  exchanged.  
Selection  of teas. Balance, Pink, whisky  to name a few.
Great  coffee.  Pastries.  Sandwiches.  Gluten free choices too.  Buzzy, busy hotel. Teddy  bear gift for New born to be. Attentive team so friendly too. Always loved. Here. Still do. Classy spot.  ",5,2018,05,28
203,Lovely Afternoon Tea :) ,"We had such a lovely time on Saturday. Marta and all the lovely staff made us feel very comfortable and welcome. They were really accommodating as we requested wheat and fish free selections which they provided without any hesitation.The food was beautifully presented and tasted even better. We even got a few extra sandwiches to fill us up. Go for the pink champagne & whiskey tea :). It would be really lovely for a special occasion. Thanks again Marta. Hope to see you again soon! We had a great time.

203,Afternoon tea,"I was for the afternoon tea at Wesbury. It was a great experience. The Sandwiches, pastries and cookies were AMAZING. Different flavors very nice combined. The presentation was very nice too. 
All the staff members were very friendly. Our waitress, Anastasia, was very helpful and she did her best to comply with our requests .
I really felt this was a 5* experience.",5,2018,05,26
203,A Dream,"This review is a little late.  I stayed at the hotel April 30-May 4.  I used to come here as a twenty-something for a cocktail never thinking I would actually stay at the hotel one day.  Since we have family in Dublin, we usually stay with them.  But I wanted to do something special for my daughter's 21st birthday so we stayed here for a few nights.  I spoke with the concierge in advance to let him know it was my daughter's birthday and to give him a bottle of nice champagne to have in our room.  They had the champagne ready for us after a day of walking Grafton St along with a card.  Then they delivered us a piece of birthday cake as well!  The service from each member of staff during the whole stay was impeccable.  You could not ask for a better location.  We especially loved the turndown service.  I only wish we had the chance to have afternoon tea.  Maybe on our next visit.",5,2018,05,25
203,Class - Comfort - Convenience,The Westbury was perfect for us.  The accommodations were beautiful.  The Staff was second to NONE!  Our dining experience was wonderful in the Wilde.  Quaint and quiet.  Delicious options and presented beautifully. ,5,2018,05,25
203,Location Perfect ,"The hotel is located by Grafton street central to the city and many shops and restaurants.  Easy walking distance to many sights as well as local transportation.  Staff all courteous and professional.  Room 419 was across from elevators / lifts w relatively spacious space for a non suite.  The only problem was it apparently was facing west and the fortunate fine sunny weather made the room very warm but the air conditioning was poor.  The room was too warm making sleeping significantly uncomfortable.  Their small fitness suite was barely adequate; however, a nearby fitness facility is available w discounted daily rates I understand (not used).  Their restaurants are decent w very attentive staff.  ",5,2018,05,20
203,Perfect location and impeccable service,"If you want to be able to walk to Trinity College, St. Patrick's Cathedral, shopping, dining, and other attractions, then this location could not be better. We were able to visit so many places by foot during our 3 day stay.
Afternoon high tea is a must. The service was the best we had in Ireland, and all of the sandwiches, teas, and baked goods were served on real polished silver! The servers and bartenders were great. We also visited another bar one late night called Sidecar. The mixologists there really knew their stuff.
Our only disappointment was our room, 269, location. It was literally across the elevator. We could hear noises and the lifts. However, Mr. Joseph Downing, a manager there, went above and beyond to make us as comfortable as possible. 

The excellent service from the staff is the number 1 reason I would give this hotel 5 stars. I look forward to coming back.",5,2018,05,19
203,"Location, Elegance, and Hospitality","The hotel was a home away from home for about a one week stay in Dublin.  Even though it has the glossy, polished appeal of a fine hotel (Leading Hotels of the World), the staff are extremely courteous, consistently going out of their way to accommodate guest needs.  For example, we had to change rooms because we found the bathtub/shower combo. was too cumbersome for us (people with fall risk), and they made switching to a very nearly identical room (save for the bathroom configuration, which was handicap accessible) a breeze.  

We were greeted with a complimentary full breakfast upon our arrival; the breakfasts in the Wilde restaurant are not to be missed!  For dinner, the other restaurants (Balfes and the Gallery) are worth a visit, but be sure to check out the surrounding eateries as well.  One of the concierges even made a reservation for us at a local hot spot, Fade Street Social (highly recommended).

Aside from the elegance of the hotel, which cannot be overstated (the proprietors of the Doyle Collection, of which the Westbury is a member, purchased Waterford crystal chandeliers that are hung in the public areas/salons), the location of the hotel recommends it the most.  The front entrance lies on a short dead end off of Graffton Street, and Graffton Street forms a comfortable connection between the Trinity College campus and St. Stephen's Green in a matter of a few blocks.  Dublin itself is a very pedestrian-friendly city.  

The rooms were comfortable, a little compact but probably standard for European and many American hotels of this caliber.  There were comfortable sitting areas in both rooms we stayed in and use of a Nespresso machine - great for early AM wake-ups!
The elevators even feature small sofas for your weary traveler's body. 

All and all, a great experience - one that made our visit to Dublin and Ireland memorable and comfortable.",5,2018,05,17
203,Excellent from start to finish!,"We stayed two nights in Dublin to begin our holiday. We could not have chosen a lovelier hotel. Great room and location. The staff were most welcoming upon arrival and exceeded our expectations. The location was excellent for exploring Dublin. 
Would absolutely stay there again.",5,2018,05,15
203,In the heart of city,"Stayed in for one night in the Westbury, location is the best you can find in Dublin city close to all city attractions in walking distance. Hotel staff really amazing and helpful. We    eat dinner in restaurant and food and service was one of the best. Breakfast was very good quality but could have more options. Definitely will stay again",4,2018,05,15
203,Excellent service,"Very charming place. Extremely well trained staff, world class food and excellent cocktails. One of the best hotels in Dublin. Location is premium- you are in the centre of the city! I would certainly recommend this place.",5,2018,05,13
203,WOW!  WOW!  WOW!,"The hotel is just spectacular!  We had a super comfortable room and bed,  Afternoon tea was just awesome.  I totally blew my diet but worth it.  Such history and elegance.  We were so sad we had such a short stay.  We'd go back for sure!",5,2018,05,13
203,Great location,"Nice hotel, good location - only downside is the size of bathrooms and low water pressure in the shower. 

Breakfast is great, nice choice of restaurants and bars; and in the middle of town.   Would stay again.",4,2018,05,13
203,Excellent in every way,"Beautiful hotel with beautiful rooms, fabulous location for exploring Dublin, staff could not be faulted, first class service from start to finish, wonderful Wi-Fi and love the personal touches. My husband and I just returned from our anniversary Ireland trip. The room staff sent us a complimentary Happy Anniversary dessert plus when we returned from dinner, our bed had rose petals and chocolates to greet us! After 32 years of marriage, I felt like a newlywed again. Thank you Mr Joseph Downing for all the welcoming details to make us feel special.",5,2018,05,12
203,In the Heart of Dublin,"Our stay at the Westbury was splendid.  Right in the center of all the action & sites.  We walked all the attractions from our hotel plus it's near tons of shopping & places to eat, local & tourist.  Hotel was elegant & rooms were above average.  Breakfast was delicious as well as evening cocktails.  Lots of construction at rear entrance but I am sure its complete & will make it even more convenient for guest.",4,2018,05,11
203,A near-perfect experience!,"We stayed 2 nights, separated by a cruise.  Loved this hotel.  Great service, friendly, helpful staff, great location in the city center just off Grafton Street.  Only issue was a late check-in.  We arrived early morning from the  US and had to kill many hours and then 1 room still not available at 3 pm official check-in time.  Likely the fault of late leavers but it would have been nice to be offered some complimentary tea while we waited.  Otherwise, a great experience and we will be back.",5,2018,05,11
203,"Amazing Staff, Location, Beautiful, best part of our stay in Dublin!  Do yourself a favor and stay there.  Period!","This review is overdue.  However, I kept the business cards of the management just for the purposes of being able to give a shout out to both of them while writing a stellar review.  Upon arriving in Dublin from San Diego, we were understandably tired and a bit worn out.  We arrived in the morning and had to switch gears in just a few hours to travel across town to see our daughter in a choir concert with her school in San Diego...obviously a remarkable experience.  We were weary from our flight, and our room wasn't ready.  Joseph Downing, the guest relations manager of this upscale boutique hotel, felt horrible that our room was not yet ready and had their restaurant stay open for breakfast, sat us down and comped us a lovely breakfast while we waited.  They took care of our luggage and made us comfortable.  Since we had to leave right after, we just washed up a bit in their lobby restrooms, which were outfitted with luxurious comforts and made us feel like new.  When we came back from our outing, our suite was ready.  It was sumptuous and inviting and spacious, with wonderful personal touches from the hotel. The bed was absolute heaven too...SO comfortable! Throughout our stay there, everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, from our first touchpoint at the front desk, to valets, to cleaning crew wait staff to management, stopped what they were doing, smiled, took their time to talk to us with great cheer, enthusiasm, helpfulness  and eye contact, and made sure our every need (and then some) was attended to.  I'm not sure my husband and I have ever had such GENUINE warmth and attention to our needs and we've stayed in plenty of very, very nice places.  The Westbury is also situated in a wonderful part of town, just off of Grafton St. with all the shops and fun strolling.  If we are ever back in Dublin, we will 100% stay there again.  I cannot recommend The Westbury enough.  Do yourself a favor..just stay there.  You'll be glad you did.  Shout out to Jack Fitzsimons too!  Thank you everyone for making our stay such a memorable one!",5,2018,05,09
203,Outstanding hotel with great staff,"We had two separate stays at the hotel that book-ended our vacation in Ireland.  Nice comfortable rooms with a great central location.  The staff was amazing throughout - notably Daniela from the Wilde restaurant and the front desk.  When the front desk learned that our toddler had lost some toys in the room of our first stay, they spent almost 10 minutes searching the lost and found area.  When they couldn't find them, they offered my son a new teddy bear instead (his 2nd one of the trip!).  Days later, we even got a call saying that they had found some toys (unfortunately, they weren't his).  We were so impressed that they even remembered such a minor situation.",5,2018,05,09
203,Luxury Hotel in Center of Dublin,"This was a tremendous hotel. The staff are amazing, the rooms are comfortable (10 ft ceilings!), and the location is unbeatable (right on Grafton St). Would stay here over and over. The only downside for me is the showers as you have a large step up to get into the bathtub and it is a half shower door.",5,2018,05,08
203,Luxurious and special,We loved our stay at the Westbury. The staff is excellent and service is very good all around. The room are very comfortable. We really liked the breakfast which was included - eggs to order - very good eggs benedict.,4,2018,05,07
203,Saturday afternoon lunch,"Great location, close to Grafton street, pleasant staff, great cocktail menu, food menu was interesting but unfortunately the food was rather bland and overpriced. I was a little disappointed as I had high expectations for this hotel ",3,2018,05,06
203,Dublin Oasis - Sidecar at the Westbury,"Have not been in Dublin for quite a while but remembered the peace and tranquility of the Westbury. Their Sidecar Cocktail Bar is a place to get away from it all and enjoy sedate surroundings with the best of service and such a variety of beverages, alcoholic and not, as the mood suits.We four spent quality time in a quiet corner and sampled a fraction of the menu card. Our server took even better care of the designated driver. A true oasis in the centre of town. A somewhat hidden gem in the centre of the capital.",5,2018,04,30
203,Great weekend in the Westbury,"Couldn‚Äôt fault this lovely hotel. The location is perfect, the room was great and the staff were just so helpful. Everyone was so obliging and friendly. Particular mention to the staff in the Sidebar with a special mention for Roisin.
Thank you all for a great weekend",5,2018,04,29
203,Birthday Celebration,"My mother and I stayed 13 April to celebrate her 80th Birthday.  The hotel surpassed all expectations.  From the moment we arrived at the hotel door the staff were exceptional.  The staff are happy and helpful.  I don't just mean you can ask someone to help you, I mean the staff appear out of nowhere to help with bags and direct you. They take the initiative to offer services, which was great.  I had advised the hotel of my mother's birthday and she was fussed over and treated like a queen.  The hotel was very generous.  We ate dinner in Wilde Restaurant which was lovely and returned again for breakfast the next morning.  While we enjoyed it we unfortunately couldn't give breakfast the time it deserves, as it is truly spectacular.  I could go on and on, and this is even before you consider the location of the hotel which is at the Stephen's Green end of Grafton Street.  There is an issue with roadworks around the hotel which is obviously not the hotel's fault but guests driving themselves should be aware.  We used the valet parking service which including overnight parking was ‚Ç¨25.  We are already looking forward to our next visit in November.  I would definitely recommend.",5,2018,04,25
203,Great experience,We stayed here a couple of years ago for a few nights with friends to watch the football. Admin staff were very helpful. The food was delicious and the breakfast was AMAZING! Rooms were spacious and beautifully decorated. Service was impeccable.,5,2018,04,24
203,If you are traveling in Dublin- Stay Here!,"My sister and I made a last minute decision to add Dublin to our Europe Itinerary and chose the Westbury from reviews. We were traveling with our sons(23 and 18yrs) and celebrating Borge their birthdays. The service and attention at the Westbury was impeccable. The team not only understands luxury client service- they deliver. Rory Rooney,front of House Manager ensured that anything we needed- was taken care of. 
Both boys had special Birthday  plates of desserts and wine waiting in the room for them along with a handwritten Birthday card.
The hotel team spent time helping us plan out visits and purchase tickets to local sites. Joseph Downing, Guest Relations Manager was also friendly, caring and professional .
Did mention that the breakfasts were amazing?And the hotel was perfectly located in the center of town- it was so convenient to go anywhere. 
This was a five star experience and we can‚Äôt wait to return to the Westbury.",5,2018,04,19
203,Bad Sound Isolation,"I stayed in Westbury hotel several times and each time I was not happy with sound isolation. From my room I could clearly hear my neighbors, the rooms next to the elivators are the worst from that perspective. Additionally, I find the size of the rooms and especially bathrooms quite small. On a positive side - the bed is great and I really enjoy free chocolates:-)",4,2018,04,19
203,"Great hotel, perfect location and friendly staff","Jack and the front office team were very helpful and ensured that our expectations were met right from the start.  The rooms are nice, updated and quiet. Restaurant staff is extremely friendly, and food is delicious.  This hotel has perfected the guest experience and we plan to be back each year.  Thanks so much!",5,2018,04,18
203,"Overpriced, Unorganized and Under Construction","Front desk manager Eimear was unprofessional telling us we were a ‚Äúno show‚Äù the night before  and informed us they were full up and didn‚Äôt how a room for us. Our room was prepaid!! She didn‚Äôt  check with her colleague who had been helping us when we checked in and was rectifying the situation. Hotel was noisy and under construction, room was ‚Äútired‚Äù.  Best part of the hotel was the Side Car bar with lovely bartenders.",1,2018,04,18
203,My second home and family,"I call The Westbury 'my second home', because I stay there at least twice a year. And I have been doing that since 2000.
The hotel is perfectly located, near Grafton Street and my favourite pub Neary's.
The rooms are very nice, everything you need is available. The woman and men from Housekeeping and Maintenance keep the room very clean and make sure everything workes, they do a fantastic job.
The breakfast in the restaurant is fantastic. And delicious. 
But what makes every stay so far sooo excellent, are the staff. From reception, congierge and doormen to the staff in the bar The Sidecar, on The Gallery and in the restaurant. 
Each and everyone always make me feel soooo welcome and they look after me extremely well.
I have not one horrible or wrong to say about The Westbury.",5,2018,04,18
203,Weekend stay,"We stayed as a family of 4 at the Westbury Hotel, Dublin last weekend.  Firstly, it has got to be the best placed hotel to see Dublin being about 50m off Grafton Street. Secondly, the staff were amazing. There was no hanging around or waiting to be served. Check in took a couple of minutes. Service in the restaurant and bar was polite and efficient. A big mention though to Jack Fitzsimons (guest relations) who met us on our arrival and made sure everything was in place. Thank you Jack for everything.
I would most definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2018,04,17
203,Faultless,"I think it is the first time that I have used faultless to describe a hotel. Sadly we only stayed for one night, but the accommodation, staff, atmosphere and location were all well deserving of the 5 star rating that they carry. Whilst certainly not cheap, the Westbury offers better value for money than other hotels in it's class in Dublin. To summarise, we shall most certainly return.",5,2018,04,17
203,Disappointing end to a enjoyable stay,"My family and I had an enjoyable stay here. However, I was extremely disappointed that a large sum of money (‚Ç¨325) was taken out of my account from the hotel without any valid reason. I rang the hotel upon discovering this alarming incident and was told I would be given an explanation as to why this happened. The money was returned to my account after 3 full days but I was not contacted as to why this happened. That is 3 days where I could not use this amount of money that belonged to me. I emailed The Westbury informing them about my unhappiness but received no reply. All I wanted was an explanation as to why such a large sum of money was taken from my account without my consent. It gives me the impression that customer service is not important to this hotel group. I was lucky I checked my account and notified the hotel as I am convinced this ""error"" would not have been rectified by the hotel unless I informed them. This should not have happened and it acts as warning to those considering to stay here.
",2,2018,04,12
203,Return visit,"Title says it all, we came back! Quality of stay was superb; room, service and amenities are truly excellent.  Every staff member was a pleasure to encounter and gave a great impression of the hotel. Wilde was the restaurant of choice for this visit with food and wine choice right up there. Great experience there and again all staff were attentive without being obtrusive.  Keep up the good work, the Westbury is a jewel in the busy City Centre.",5,2018,04,11
203,A fantastic experience as always,"We had a wonderful stay at the Westbury Hotel. We were welcomed with open arms. Every member of staff greeted us with a smile. All were fantastic but a special mention goes to Joseph who ensured that our stay was a memorable one. All aspects of the service was exemplary. Our room was perfect. 
We had dinner in Wilde. We had a lovely table. The food & the wine were excellent as was breakfast in the morning.
The location of the hotel is perfect with every amenity at your finger tips.
I would highly recommend the Westbury. In my opinion it is one of the best hotels in Dublin.",5,2018,04,11
203,Nice hotel...,"The Westbury hotel is perfectly located in the centre of Dublin. Everything you need is within short walking distance. Main sights like the Guinness factory, the zoo, St Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral, Temple Bar and more are approximately 20 minutes from the hotel (depending how fast you walk). On arrival the reception staff were very friendly, welcoming and keen to provide some hints and tips to make the most of our stay. The hotel states it is a 5* hotel but I would have to disagree, I think it‚Äôs more of a 3/4* hotel. There are a few things that could be improved in the rooms 1) The room had a desk but no desk chair which didn‚Äôt make sense 2) In room dining had a low table with one chair so my partner couldn‚Äôt eat with me 3) The corridors can be a little busy with guests when the bar closes at night or first thing at breakfast. The issue is the doors aren‚Äôt very sound proof letting the noise in which can be a problem if you are a light sleeper. 4) The rooms are looking a little tired and could do with a bit of a facelift. Overall I had a pleasant stay at The Westbury.",3,2018,04,10
203,Amazing hotel and employees!,"The Westbury was one of the nicest hotels we've stayed at!  The rooms and facilities were beautiful, but the hotel staff was even better!  Everyone was so nice and accommodating!  It is also a great location with restaurants and shopping within walking distance.  We had a wonderful stay!",5,2018,04,10
203,Evening Cocktails in the Sidecar,"My mother in law and I came in and were greeted with the biggest smiles from the three waitresses working on the Saturday night. The service was fantastic and the cocktails equally excellent. The waitresses (Roisin and Iva and sorry I missed the last name) all were able to guide me through ordering something to my taste and I left very happy with the promise of returning soon!
I hope the girls are working next time I come in as they had a fantastic dynamic that made the whole experience one worth sharing.",5,2018,04,10
203,Wonderful stay,We spent 2 nights here over Easter weekend as we started our trip in Ireland.  The staff was super helpful and kind with added touches like a chocolate Easter egg provided on Easter Sunday during turn down service.  Everything was well done and all the staff we came in contact with was first rate.  The location was perfect and made the city super accessible.  Everything was wonderful and after we drove around the country we wished we had returned for the final night of the trip.  When we booked the trip we decided to try a different area of the city for our final night and were so disappointed!,5,2018,04,09
203,Very enjoyable stay,"I recently stayed with a friend. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Upon arrival Tomasz, the concierge was very helpful with our bags and arranged for our car to be parked. We checked in and were delighted with our spacious and bright room. We went to the bar and enjoyed a lovely bottle of prosecco and ordered a few tasty bar bites. The bar has a lovely relaxing atmosphere and we whiled away a few enjoyable hours. On request, Keith at Front of House kindly booked Saba for our evening meal. After our dinner we enjoyed a few drinks back in the hotel bar. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was delicious and worth getting up for. Even though it was a short stay it was very relaxing and I'd recommended it. Thanks to all and hope to be back.",5,2018,04,09
203,Personal  service 5 stars,"USA  visitor who spent  4 nights recently at the westbury-  2 adults and teenage son. First time Dublin visitors and went on Amex platinum booking. City center location is excellent ,and rooms quite spacious . We booked bigger room luxury deluxe to accommodate 3 person and it was sufficient sized, the hotel is not very modern and could use a touch of update especially  electronics and the bathrooms. It is suited more as a classic  elegant European hotel. 
 I will say while we stayed there there was street construction directly in front of the hotel lobby which did  wake us up early one morning with loud banging ( and we were suffering from 8 hour time lag).  When we complained to front staff they immediately opened up extra room in quieter  area for our son to move into to get some needed sleep. 
Later  at the end of busy day of touring , we also relocated to new room which had been set up for us with treats and champagne on the house. 
The guest relations team went out of the way to relocate us to quieter room and we were very impressed with their hands on and personal touch. 
They had a genuine interest to ensure  our stay was top notch. We travel frequently and were quite impressed  with this personal touch  from the entire guest relations team 
I would highly recommend the hotel for discerning travelers who appreciate first class old fashioned personal service.",5,2018,04,09
203,Amazing!,"We stayed at the Westbury for one night for a short trip to see theatre performance. First class hotel, good old fashioned service. Excellent surroundings, immaculately presented. Wish we‚Äôd been there longer ti enjoy more of this beautiful hotel - we will be back! ",5,2018,04,09
203,World Class Service,"Absolutely fantastic service, fantastic staff who can't do enough for you. The hotel is world class. A truly unforgettable visit. The location is perfect in the city centre but the rooms are perfectly quiet. ",5,2018,04,07
203,Fantastic,"Stayed for a week in aug 2017 when I went to Dublin to run the half marathon.  Loved this hotel. It was our 3rd time and never disappoints.   Room was spacious, great breakfast buffet, great bar with nice fireplace and great drinks.  Restaurants were all fantastic too. Highly recommend.  One short block from Grafton street",5,2018,04,06
203,Dublin St Patrick's day,We had are first ever trip to Dublin for st Patrick's day stayed a the Westbury for 3 night the Hotel was fantastic we had a Bed and Brakfast deal. The rooms were top draw the staff we so nice and helpful. The city of Dublin was a lot more expensive than we are use to in U.K. But what a lovely city and with a Hotel like the Westbury it made it all weath the cost. Would I stay there again yes 100% like I say the was nothing to complain about. Food for breakfast was spot on what ever you wanted was there. Like I say if you go any were in Dublin you will pay the price locals know what it's like and don't hide it but like I say we had a great time and the Westbury Hotel played a big part to the well weath the expense.,5,2018,04,01
203,Excellent,Great stuff all round. Few drinks and spa treatments did the job. Got woken up but it was the loser in the next room's fault and not the hotel. I could sit in that bar all day (but am not allowed to) tks again mark & una,5,2018,04,01
203,An overnight stay,"My wife and I stayed in the Westbury thanks to winning a voucher to allow us to enjoy a bed and breakfast deal for one night last month. 
I have to say that from the time we checked in to the time we checked out we enjoyed nothing less than five star service.  Everything from the sidecar lounge to Wilde Restaurant-a superb Maitre d' called Patrick- all made our stay memorable.
Nothing was any trouble especially when our two grandchildren joined us for breakfast the next day culminating in a thorough gentleman offering to deliver our car from the car park.  That is what I call memorable service!",5,2018,03,30
203,Outstanding,"Love the Westbury. Friendly, welcoming, and attentive staff. Really nice rooms, although not large. Amazing beds. Showers a bit cramped. Great amenities. Very comfortable. Great breakfast. Loved the bar and the public spaces. Will defiantly be back.",5,2018,03,29
203,Classic hotel,"The Westbury is a really classy old fashion hotel with a hint of luxury and style. Conveniently located near Grafton street, Trinity College, Temple bar and Dublin Castle. It has old world charm with modern amenities.
The afternoon teas are really popular and it is better to book in advance.
The staff were very friendly and helpful",4,2018,03,28
203,5 star,"Beautiful hotel with amazing service!! Not cheap but you get what you pay for!  4 of us sharing deluxe twin room, beds felt a bit small for 2 but very comfortable! Nespresso machine in room, you can ask for fresh milk and they will bring up. Beds turned down at night and everything replenished... including tidying of room and chocolate in bed... air con not great but no other complaints!! Would highly recommend... great location as just off grafton st and short walk to temple bar..",4,2018,03,25
203,Excellent ,"Here for a short break but unfortunately caught a cold (flu) on arrival which took any energy to go anywhere or do anything away from me , but I have to say the staff were excellent in all areas and hopefully I can come back again ",5,2018,03,23
203,Afternoon Tea,"Had a wonderful experience with the afternoon tea at The Westbury. We had a nice table by the window and service was excellent. It was snowing the day of our visit so it was great to nestle in and watch the snow. The tea, food, and champagne were all great!",5,2018,03,22
203,Great,"We went for the early bird and it was very good value. I had the Burger, it was a little bland - nothing amazing but not awful either. . The starters looked  good to and the bread was very nice! The Dessert was lovely. Staff were very good. Nothing bad to say.",4,2018,03,21
203,Awful Stay,"I am writing this after waiting days for the General Manager to respond to my internal complaint but nothing happened.  So now, I want to make everyone aware.  Do not visit this Hotel.  It is pretentious and overpriced for the service that you receive. 

My husband and I decided to book The Westbury for our one year wedding anniversary.  It was our first trip together overseas and we wanted to stay at a location that would be romantic and upscale.  When we arrived to the Hotel (after a 9 hour flight) our room was not yet ready...totally understandable.  We decided to sit in the lobby and have a drink and something to eat.  Our very first experience was a hostess approaching us and telling my husband and I that we had to be done with the table within the hour because they had other reservations.  There were over 20 tables (I counted) available.  When the hostess saw that we were drinking and ordered food, miraculously we were able to ""stay and enjoy ourselves"".  

When our room was ready (I do have to say that they did so within the hour from our arrival which was nice) we went up and were welcomed with an amenity that was signed from The Westbury to help us celebrate our one year anniversary signed by Guest Relations.  How nice!  However, this amenity was actually sent and paid for by our friend back home from the States.  She sent the amenity to my husband and I and inquired about it two days later after I didn't say anything.  Joseph (a Manager from the front desk) called and said ""Your friends actually sent you that amenity"" without even an apology to accompany it.  How tacky!  I attached the photo of the note so that you can see that I am not mistaken with this.

The same evening, we went to their bar called The Sidecar.  When we arrived, we stood at the door for five minutes before someone acknowledged us.  They had ""reserved"" signs on four empty tables and told us that they could put us in a corner at a stool with no table in front of it.  The service was overly pretentious and non apologetic.  I understand that they were busy, but at this point, I was feeling as though my business was not wanted at all (after the a.m. service in the Lobby Lounge).  Finally I asked if we could sit in the room that is attached to the bar to be served.  They obliged.  Just not a great experience.  

The final straw was this experience.  We decided to try The Wilde (another bar/restaurant in The Westbury).  I will share, the service provided by the bartender on the evening of March 10th was incredible.  He was amazing and the drinks were incredible.  He alone helped save what poor experiences we had had up until that point.  We ordered cocktails, the cheese tray and oysters.  I woke up in the middle of the night sweating and not feeling very well.  The entire next day I was sluggish and not myself.  The following day was all out horrible.  I had a fever, shakes, and intestinal issues that I will not share.  I was incredibly sick.  I knew for certain it was the oysters.  It was the only thing that my husband and I didn't share.  In addition to the fact that it came on within 24 hours, the symptoms I had, and the fact that it only remained for about 2 days and then was completely gone.

My husband went down to the front desk to share this with them.  They said they would open ""an investigation"" and asked if they could sent a Doctor.  I was more than happy to accept.  However, after the Doctor came, the Hotel contacted us and asked that we pay the bill.  Please note at this point we hadn't asked for ANYTHING to be complimentary (not that meal, nor the room, nor anything).  However, we did expect that the ""in house Doctor"" offered would be based on the way that it was extended.  My poor husband, who was missing his dream vacation, dealing with his sick wife, had to discuss the matter of this bill on more than one occasion with the Front Desk.  They finally agreed to pay the 120 euros.

The next day came and I was still feeling very under the weather.  At this point, I hadn't been able to drink water or eat anything.  We missed half of our trip and paid for tours that we couldn't go on.  As we were checking out, Joseph (you see he makes his mark a couple of times) came up to me...not to check on me mind you...but to say that the Hotel was in no way liable or responsible for me getting ill.  And he had confirmed this with the Doctor.  #1) The Doctor was not permitted to speak of my health to ANYONE but myself and my husband.  This is HIPAA law.  So the fact that he was saying this was just to cover the Hotel.  #2) The Doctor told my husband and I that it could very well be food poisoning because of all of the symptoms but didn't feel comfortable making the final call because it had been 24 hours.  I respected that.  I personally believe it was the oysters, but in truth, it could have been anything.  I know this.  What I also know is that the Hotel did not need to come up to me to harass me as I was just trying to do my best to stand up during checkout.

We had another 9 hour flight that I was going to have to get through.  Joseph's last words just solidified that this Hotel and it's leaders have NO idea how to manage.  They cared nothing about my well being.  Just the fact that they had ""done me the favor"" of paying for the Doctor and also that they had nothing to do with the incident.

Vincent, who I am certain will reply to this TripAdvisor review because it is now public, never reached out.  I personally sent an internal survey where I shared all this same information and nothing.  

Do yourself a favor and do not stay here.  The pros of this Hotel are the housekeeping team and the one bartender in The Wilde.  The cons unfortunately outweigh anything good that happened.

Poor Management and Employees that are not empowered to help.  That is what you will get if you stay at this Hotel.",1,2018,03,20
203,Touch of class,"Stayed here to celebrate my husbands birthday. It was around Christmas time so hotel decorated beautifully. Lovely atmosphere. 

The food and service were first class although we were a tad disappointed with the size of our room giving the price of it - room was very small. 

Apart from that loved every minute of this five star hotel in a fantastic location of Dublin. ",5,2018,03,19
203,Outstanding as usual ,"We decided to have lunch here on Friday 16th March & then do some shopping, we ended up staying for quite a awhile longer as both the customer service & cocktails were amazing. We were served by the gracious Michael and Gabriel. Gabriel was able to say to me that I wouldn‚Äôt like a certain cocktail as it was sweet & he knew I wouldn‚Äôt like it. He was right. He made a cocktail up for me. That‚Äôs pretty impressive considering we ordered one drink previously. Attention to detail, first class. We stayed for a bit, left, did some shopping and returned. Michael is a credit to you, he kept a seat for us for an hour, greeted us like old friends when we returned. We were served by Iva on the floor, who was very friendly and nice. Normally we are served by Roisin, but she was off that night. A special mention for her though as she is genuinely kind who obviously loves her job.

We also ordered some sides, smoked salmon was delicious and so fresh, Caesar salad, to die for.

A must visit",5,2018,03,19
203,Mrs,"We had an AT at the Gallery. Everyone is so friendly, warm and the service is excellent. From the host Kate who explainded us the AT, to our server Felicia who has great knowladge of teas and great recommendations, a food runner Liam.
Such a great atmosphere and a beautiful launge.
Desserts are delicious and so tasty.
",4,2018,03,17
203,"Tatty, not a five star","I stayed at the Westbury this month for a business trip and have to say that I was disappointed. Check in was very slow as the lady on reception was a trainee and was not  very efficient and my room, an executive suite, was very tired as all the furniture had seen better days and the bathroom was a disgrace!

Checkout was also a labour of love and yet another trainee who did not know what they were doing. No receipt for my stay and when I wanted to complain about the room, she just said sorry and walked off!

The positives:

* Location
* Room was clean
* Good bar
* Breakfast",2,2018,03,15
203,Afternoon Tea,I decided to book afternoon tea for my mum's birthday and heard good reviews of the Westbury Hotel and I was not disappointed. The level of service and friendliness of the staff really made the experience lovely. The range of teas and pastries were also very impressive. I was mostly impressed with the atmosphere of the Gallery which was warm and and comfortable with a touch of luxury.,5,2018,03,15
203,Gorgeous hotel ,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The whole place is beautiful, service is excellent and breakfast to die for! If you‚Äôre visiting Dublin I would highly recommend this hotel. The only problem is you may not want to leave...",5,2018,03,12
203,City break,"Luxurious.  A real 5 star place. Great location in the centre of the city.  The main lounge area is one of the best I‚Äôve ever visited.  A great room.

Visited the cocktail bar where of course there is only one drink to have - a Guinness",5,2018,03,11
203,Friendly staff and beautiful rooms,"The Westbury is, in my opinion, the best hotel in Dublin.  Despite that there was construction on the street outside, I was never bothered by it.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming - I was checked in my someone new (Richelle) and she was  so nice and remembered me throughout the rest of my stay.  I was also checked in on by Aleksandra to make sure my stay was comfortable, and she was always so accommodating. Despite the fact they had a major snowstorm that shut down the city for the first two days I was there, I never felt the effects as a guest. I did order room service one evening (the first evening), but they were very timely in letting me know they had limited staff and that there may be a slight delay. I am someone who has no issue with delay, as long as I'm informed, so I think this was great customer service.  I didn't enjoy Afternoon Tea this time, but breakfast at Wilde everyday was phenomenal. The bed was even more comfortable than the last time and the room was impeccably kept.  The only slight hiccup was one morning when ordering breakfast, I ordered the ""Full Irish"" - which comes with an option for various egg dishes, pancakes or a ""Traditional irish breakfast"" with eggs, tomato, meats, etc. This caused some confusion, as I received the Traditional (I don't eat pork) when I ordered just scrambled eggs with it.  It wasn't a huge issue (I don't have an allergy or religious issue, it is just a preference to not eat pork), so I didn't raise it at the time and just ate the eggs, but I think that there is a Full Irish + Traditional Irish option in there, it was a little confusing, but that was only an issue if you are particularly picky or if you DO have an allergy or religious objection to pork on your plate. I will absolutely be staying at the Westbury again when I next visit Dublin, and fully recommend it as a fantastic stay.  It is more central than almost anything, but not in Temple Bar, so it is beautifully quiet at night.",5,2018,03,08
203,Stunning,Well its a beautiful hotel. The staff were helpful and even went looking for a special drink for me that I love. Enjoyed the food that was presented. Would have loved to sit in the bar for a while but we were at a private function.,5,2018,03,07
203,THE WESTBURY: SERVICE! AMENITIES! LOCATION! EXPERIENCE!,"My third stay at the Westbury was as excellent as the first two stays! I base my lodging choices on ratings/class, amenities, and location. The Westbury is highly rated on every travel advisory site, and there is a valid reason for that! The minute you pull up to the hotel you are, warmly, greeted, and the staff is eager to accommodate your check-in needs. They have a ""sense of urgency"" to provide customer service, and that is worth its weight in gold throughout Dublin! The hotel is beautiful, elegant, modern, and clean. The rooms are, equally, beautiful and clean. The LOCATION of the Westbury Hotel is SUPERIOR in the City Center. Grafton Street is a few steps away from the main entrance and has the best shopping, restaurants, and pubs. Temple Bar is a short walk away... Actually, EVERYTHING is a short walk away that you may want to see in Dublin. What sets the Westbury apart, in my well-traveled opinion, is the SIDECAR BAR! This bar has a, cool, 007/Great Gatsby feel, and the drinks are professionally crafted by well-versed barkeeps. Their cocktail menu is impressive with unique flavor combinations and high-end ingredients. My, personal, favorite part of the Sidecar Bar experience was the culinary expertise of a gentleman named, Adrian. My husband and I met Adrian during our 2016 stay, and I was excited to introduce him to my friends on my last stay. He is personable, professional, and enthusiastic about the art of cocktails! I own a food and beverage company with an extensive background in culinary arts. This man IMPRESSED ME! I will leave you with images of his whiskey-cocktail masterpiece that was created based off of my palate preferences. My name is Helen... This cocktail is named the HELEN OF TROY, and it will launch a 1000 ships of joy on your tastebuds! Thank you to everyone who served us during our stay. I will be back!",5,2018,03,06
203,Thank You Westbury,"We got engaged in the Westbury this weekend and I can't thank the wonderful staff enough for making our special day extra special!! The service was exceptional and everyone absolutely spoiled us rotten! From sending us cards and cakes to our room, to surprise champagne at dinner, we couldn't have asked for more. The food in Wilde was stunning as always and cocktails in the side car ended our night beautifully. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts to all the staff, particularly Emer at reception, and the restaurant staff who were almost as excited for us as we were!! I already can't wait to get back for our anniversary!",5,2018,03,06
203,Lovely Afternoon Tea,"Back in January we went to the Westbury and we had an amazing Afternoon Tea. The location was great and the table was facing Grafton Street. The staff were friendly, especially Tim and Felicia from the gallery.

After finishing the Afternoon Tea, Tim lead us to the bar and Stephen the bar manager offer us some wonderful cocktails.

If you are in Dublin I highly recommend this experience.

Thank you to all the staff for making this experience unforgettable!",5,2018,03,05
203,Luxury in the heart of the city,"Spent a most relaxing weekend in this luxuriously 5 star hotel excellently located just off Grafton St. Friendly staff, comfortable bed,lovely interiors and good breakfast combined with a very relaxing lobby for afternoon tea with views overlooking Grafton St makes this a unique choice for a weekend stay in the Capital.",4,2018,03,05
203,Water pressure terrible,"This is a beautiful hotel but expensive.  For this reason it was disappointing to have little water pressure and sub standard service in the restaurant.

This was my first stay at the Westbury but I had used the restaurant and bar on previous visits.  The rooms are beautiful but the bathroom was very tiny and the water pressure was non existent.  I can only imagine some one with long hair struggling to rinse out the shampoo!

The second disappointment was the breakfast in the restaurant.  Staff seem to excel at ignoring guests to be seated, served and given a bill!  At one point during breakfast no staff were present in the dining area for 10mins.

The bar however has excellent service. The well trained mixologists know their drinks and treat all guests with respect.

For the price the water needs fixing and a retraining of staff in restaurant.",3,2018,03,04
203,Wonderful stay to wait out the storm!,"Decided on the Westbury during the storm of the century and couldn‚Äôt be happier. The staff understood the curcimstances outside but made sure their hotel was running on all 5 stars inside regardless of the weather. The Wilde is a fantastic restaurant, Sidecar a great high-end bar, rooms are lovely, parking convenient. What‚Äôs not to love? Compares favorably to the other high-end hotels in Dublin and I‚Äôd stay here again if presented the opportunity.",5,2018,03,04
203,The Gallery Restaurant,"We've had a gorgeous meal at The Gallery Restaurant at The Westbury and I have to say we didn't had in long time such high quality service, provided by Paula & team in a friendly and professional manner. We've had such great time that our meal prolonged for a few good hours. Thank you for a great evening and for providing us with such great time. We will definitely come back.",5,2018,03,03
203,Everything was amazing,"Cocktails were delicious, wait staff friendly and diligent in ensuring cocktails were prepares correctly for my friend who has coeilac disease so it is extremely importance utensils and measured used arent contaminated with gluten which is very difficult esp when getting drinks while out",4,2018,03,03
203,Class Place,"Stayed at The Westbury hotel Dublin at weekend as part of the Ireland v Wales rugby international. The hotel was fantastic, the service was great and perfect location to get around Dublin. Great atmosphere in the several bars in the hotel. Breakfast was a delight all the staff were very helpful.",5,2018,03,03
203,Comfortable ,I stayed in the Westbury for 2 nights recently and I was amazed by the staffs attention to detail. The staff were friendly and welcoming. The food was exquisite. The hotel is located in the city center and i would consider it to be prime location. Afternoon tea was lovely. As for the hotel rooms they are tastefully decorated and comfortable. ,4,2018,03,03
203,Good as always ,"This was our sixth visit to The Westbury, but first with our daughter and son. I tried to get a complimentary upgrade, but nothing offered. To be fair Hotel was at full capacity I believe. However as before staff welcoming, Kevin warmly greeted us at the temporary Clarendon Street main entrance door on arrival and looked after the car and brought it back when we booked out. Breakfast was enjoyable, although some confusion with timings on Friday. I understand there is a plan to refurbish some rooms which I think is overdue as they are starting to look dated. Staff always go above and beyond, and we look forward to returning . To the large contingent of Welsh fans booking in as we left, we hope you had a great weekend in Dublin, it was a great game .",5,2018,03,02
203,"Lovely rooms, poor service!","Stayed here for a week away, rooms and the public areas (except the gym which was small, although partnership with gym across street for those who wish to pay for better facilities) were excellent standard as expected for a 5* hotel. 

However the quality of service received was very poor throughout the stay. From the restaurant(WILDE) where we received average food and sluggish service despite the lack of guests to the bar(Sidecar) which despite the table service and high prices we waited 45 minutes without any service having already bought several drinks that evening, despite this it was reasonably quiet.

Excellent location and good rooms,  however for a hotel with a reputation such as this  would expect decent service as a minimum. ",3,2018,03,01
203,Great location,This is a great hotel in the heart of Dublin. We have stayed here twice now and will surely return again. Rooms are on the small size but everything else about this hotel oozes 5 stars. It‚Äôs even in a great location to grab a bite to eat when shopping on grafton street.,5,2018,03,01
203,Amazing all roubd,"Stayed here for the rugby weekend & so glad we chose this hotel.
We were on an early flight & hoped for an early check in & Valentina the receptionist bent over backwards to ensure we could get into our room as soon as possible. 
The staff are all so happy & pleasant & really genuinely enjoy their jobs! 
The hotel itself is beautiful & grand & ideally situated for shopping, restaurants & sightseeing.
Breakfast was a joy. Food was amazing & service pleasant & efficient.
Our suite was beautiful, slight downside was noisy air con unit, but everything else was perfect.
Would definitely return if in Dublin - highly recommend ",5,2018,02,27
203,"Good hotel, centrally located","In Dublin for 4 days on business staying at the Westbury. Fairly nice hotel, good food, charming staff, good WiFi, comfortable bed.  Pretty centrally located; lots of good pubs and restaurants nearby.  Did not get a chance to try out the gym.",4,2018,02,26
203,First-class stay in a fantastic location,"Upon arriving at the Westbury, the receptionist was extremely apologetic that our room wasn't ready yet despite it being past the designated check-in time. We were just about to say that it was fine, and that we would come back later, when she ushered us into the bar for a complimentary drink while we waited for housekeeping to finish. We each ordered a cocktail, only for the server to return a few moments later with two glasses of Prosecco, telling us that there would be a short wait for our cocktails and they didn't want us to be sitting there empty-handed in the meantime. This extremely generous welcome set the tone for our stay, where nothing was too much trouble for the staff, and the room was a haven of relaxation. I only wish we'd been staying for longer...",5,2018,02,25
203,Breakfast here is exceptional,My favourite thing about hotels is the breakfast and this is the best I've eaten in years. Its really a great venue for meetings and also coming back late afternoon and having tea and cake to. Its a pricier hotel option in Dublin but a very special experience. Visited several times and always a great time.,5,2018,02,25
203,A few lovely cocktails üçæüçæ,A fine place to pop into for a cocktail if you‚Äôre in Dublin for any reason... or live here....Shops close - lovely staff- so welcoming.. üç∏üçπ highly recommended by us anyway - the place to go to relax and soak up Dublin ,4,2018,02,24
203,Wonderful Westbury,"A couple of nights stay in this central hotel. Service was very attentive, room was clean and well appointed. Lively bar on the ground floor. 

Not the cheapest hotel in town, but probably one of the best. ",5,2018,02,24
203,Excellent Hotel ,"Everything about our stay at the Westbury was perfect from start to finish. From our greeting at reception to our fabulous room it was simply top notch. 

We spent some time in the hotel bar which was very classy and Cathal in particular was an excellent barman. 

Breakfast was included in our rate and was just incredible. Will definitely be staying here again soon and can't recommend it highly enough.

For foreign visitors, the location can't possibly get more central.",5,2018,02,22
203,Great Hotel,"Spent a lovely night here recently. It was a belated Christmas treat that we've done before and are never let down here. The hotel is well worth its 5 star rating. Service, comfort and ambience are top class. Food in both Balfes and Wildes (breakfast) were top class and served efficiently and with a smile.
The hotel's location is perfect for visiting Dublin, beside the main shopping street and all amenities, with a short walk to the city centre.
I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel.",5,2018,02,22
203,Brilliant Hotel,"Been back to the Westbury many times excellent Hotel , very convenient for Grafton Street and a walk away for the shops and restaurants , very comfortable rooms with everything you need included , lovely food and a fabulous afternoon tea with Champagne .really look forward to our visits and cannot wait for next year . 
",5,2018,02,21
203,Very Good For Dublin,"Overall the standard of luxury hotels in Dublin is average. For location, The Westbury is number one. Service is excellent but the hardware (rooms, lobby, lifts) is just average. 50 meters to Grafton Street is the main selling point.",4,2018,02,19
203,Outstanding,"Stayed in the Westbury after a concert.  Central to everything.  Absolutely loved the Art   Deco furniture and fit out of this hotel.  My favourte hotel thus far in Dublin, surpassing The Shelbourne because the room was much bigger and more comfortable.  Bed very comfortable and room well equipped and very clean.  I simply loved the decor of this hotel and the breakfast room was beautiful.  Just had B&B here, Expensive, but worth the treat.  Staff lovely and unobtrusive.  Valet parking, which does cost ¬£25 extra to your bill.  You have been warned.",5,2018,02,19
203,"Perfect Location, wonderful staff","My husband and I booked 5 nights at the Westbury in order to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. We arrived to our room to find the bed strewn with rose petals and a delicious dessert awaiting us with a 'Happy Anniversary' message, a lovely touch. The room was complete with anything you may need, including a Nespresso coffee maker and selection of teas. The bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed ever and the bathroom perfectly equipped with luxury toiletries. Perhaps the most important thing of all though was the attitude of the staff. Every single member of staff that we encountered was extremely pleasant, helpful and made us feel very much valued guests. A couple of minor problems with the room were sorted out immediately on notification and entirely to our satisfaction personally by the assistant guest relations manager Eimear Gielty. Breakfast was delicious with a wonderful choice and, again, all members of staff greeted us with a smile and were immediately at the table to take our order, no matter how busy the restaurant. The location could not be any better, just off Grafton Street with just about everywhere within easy walking distance. We have stayed in many hotels throughout the world and The Westbury is easily the friendliest and most professionally run of them all. Next time we are in Dublin, there is no contest, we'll be staying at the Westbury again.",5,2018,02,19
203,Nice Stay,Modern and spacious.  No 1 location in Dublin off Grafton St and right next to endless list of top bars and restaurants particularly around Exchequer St and Powerscourt area.  Staff exceptionally friendly.,4,2018,02,19
203,Westbury - Very nice,This is a lovely hotel in a great location. The staff are very pleasant and the location is excellent! The front-desk staff is especially helpful. The breakfast is wonderful. The room was large and comfortable with a teapot for warming up!   I will be back!,5,2018,02,18
203,Perfection ,"I cannot say enough good things about our stay here... From Valet, to check in to everyone working here, 5 star service.... 
the rooms are big and very well designed. 
The restaurants on site all wonderful.
Afternoon Tea is a MUST.

In the city center so close to everything you want to see and do...

Please make it a point to book your stay here....",5,2018,02,17
203,Amazing experience,"I have recently stayed in the Westbury hotel and I was amazed by the quality of service as well as the design of the hotel and its overall ambience. I really enjoyed the room and full Irish breakfast the next morning. 
Staff members were very professional and friendly. Prior to my arrival I was dealing with Laura Fontana from reservations team who was very efficient with replying to my e-mails. Then I was assisted at check-in by a very lovely girl. Unfortunately, I can't remember her name - all I remember is that she was brunette with her hair in a sleek bun, not too tall. As I have requested a room service, breakfast was brought to the room by a blond polish girl who also was super friendly.  
Overall, It was definitely a 5 star experience. I would love to stay stay there again.",5,2018,02,17
203,nice place to stay,"Large rooms, very clean, with all facilities.
Good service at front desk with efficient check-in and check-out.
Great location in the heart of the city.
Disappointing buffet breakfast, not really at the level you can expect from this catrgory of hotels and for such a price...",4,2018,02,17
203,Location and Luxury,"We had a fabulous stay at the Westbury. We had a very smooth check in and our room was small but very comfortable. The beds were turned down at night and we had a great sleep. We also had breakfast at the hotel. It was very busy when we arrived but the breakfast manager got us some juice while we waited. The table for breakfast was extremely small for two people, there was no room for breakfast plates and pots of tea. It felt uncomfortable which ended up with coffee spilling all over the table. We had to reorder coffee twice before it arrived. 
Overall we really enjoyed our stay. A fabulous hotel in the heart of the city. ",4,2018,02,17
203,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here for one night January and had a thoroughly relaxed and enjoyable visit.  Staff were excellent - very helpful and efficient.  The room wasn't terribly big, but it was very comfortable. Breakfast was delicious: my only criticism was the fresh orange juice was all pulp - I practically needed a knife and fork to get through it.",5,2018,02,17
203,"Great hotel, as always","Stayed here for one night. This is one of our favourite Dublin Hotels. Central, luxurious, all round just plain excellent. Even the food in Balfes is top drawer. Staff are always happy to help and are pleasant.
Still recommended.",5,2018,02,17
203,Old world perfection,"Very present stay recently, last minute booking for a weekend and complimentary upgrade following special request in the notes when booking. Check in efficient and friendly, Sophia was very helpful. Room beautiful, spacious and lovely amenities including turn down service in the evening. 

Ideal location, endless shopping opportunities, fantastic cocktails at the lobby bar Sidecar and very pleasant breakfast. Secondary double glazing prevents street noise. Staff well spoken and immaculately presented, not stuffy but professional. Hat off to management and guest services, whole team is doing great work! Would recommend without hesitation and will stay again soon.

Special bonus points for lovely petit fours that had appeared in our room while we were out!

203,"High quality "" dependable"" city centre hotel","My wife and I stayed at this hotel last weekend. We have stayed many times before and too be honest the quality and service at this hotel has always been exceptionally high. From the staff behind reception to concierge and bar and restaurant staff the service and attention is second to none. Rooms are comfortable and well laid out but getting a little dated in some places. The food in Balfes restaurant and the breakfast room was first class. There are streetworks being carried on in front of the hotel at the moment, but don't let that put you off as the hotels has been able to work around it. It seems nearly finished anyway. All in all great city centre hotel will definitely stay again.",5,2018,02,12
203,Proud that this is Irish! ,"As head of function of a international company (Diageo) I'm lucky to travel and stay in some great hotels. Favourite by far being Langham Place in NYC and also the one in Mongkok in Hong Kong. Being Irish I was always proud of what we had on offer in Ireland but never fully appreciated it until the other day. I've stayed in Shelbourne, Westbury and the Merrion and the latter was always my favourite, this however changed on Saturday last. I'm on my maternity leave for the first time and wandering around town with a three month old I was suddenly panicking on where would be comfortable to feed her, I wanted somewhere comfortable but also somewhere that I could enjoy some good food and not worry about breastfeeding. The Westbury came to mind since it was always where I used to go for afternoon tea with friends. I was however a bit apprehensive, we don't have the best culture for breastfeeding here in Ireland and I wasn't sure how the patrons or even the staff at this dive star establishment would react. I needn't have worried at all, while Claridges had once infamously asked a breastfeeding patron to cover up Westbury was exactly the opposite. The staff were super attentive and made a point in seeing if I had enough water or needed anything. Their service and friendliness was so genuine that I ended up comfortably eating lunch and dinner (also drinks and tea) there in the space of two hours, while my child cooed at the great flowers and smiling staff. The food was delicious (try the spiced mackerel salad or the steak sandwich, follow it up with the baked alaska) and the atmosphere most welcoming.

Well done to Vincent O'Gorman and his staff.

203,Amazing!!!!!,"Stayed here recently and recieved the most warming welcome. From the second we got out of the taxi the door men were there to greet us. 
The lobby was amazing with a lovely relaxed and homely  atmosphere. Our check in was a breeze and the girl at the desk was a pleasure, and we even recieved a comp upgrade! 
Breakfast the next morning was out of this world with a beautiful selection of cold cut meats , cheese and fresh fruit. We also found the staff in the breakfast room to be most welcoming, and had a lovely chat with our server.
I would stay here again in a heart beat !

203,Relaxing mid week break,Trip with my 88 year old mother and 17 year old daughter. Convience of hotel to shops as mother not very mobile was main reason for booking this treat. Very relaxing and welcoming from the minute we arrived . The gallery is a lovely area to relax have a drink and meet my other daughter. ,4,2018,02,10
203,Excellent customer service,"I'll start by saying not everything went as smooth as I'd expect. At breakfast waiter forgot to take my order after taking my wife's, the table had to be steadied with a doorstop and we had some minor issues in room. So why am I giving it 5 stars, well for many reasons but mostly the way the hotel handled our disappointment. I truly believe that its easy to go online write bad reviews and then complain about the hotel etc, but i do believe in giving the hotel a chance to rectify the situation before assuming service is poor. In this case the hotel was excellent , Rory couldn't have been more helpful and the apology was so sincere.  I echo everything everyone has said, this truly is a magnificent hotel, excellent location, lovely bar area, rooms are superb and with customer service like I mentioned to boot I would definitely recommend",5,2018,02,10
203,5 star hotel with 7 star service,"Stayed recently at the Westbury, amazing staff, every level of the team were extremely friendly and always put the customers first,
Amazing team from the front desk staff to the cleaners, everyone was so helpful and willing to make your stay a perfect experience.
Fantastic stay will be back......",5,2018,02,10
203,Fantastic hotel in the heart of the shopping district,"The Westbury was hands down one of the best 5 star hotels I've ever stayed in.  Usually I find luxurious hotels are lacking service or helpful staff but I really can't find any major flaws in this hotels.

Upon arriving at the Westbury we did try to find the car park ourselves....I wouldn't recommend doing this!  Use valet parking instead (25 euro).  We ended up driving up Grafton street which I'm not sure if thats allowed but we ended up back at the hotel entrance again thankfully.

The hotel is located right beside Brown Thomas so it's perfect if you want to splurge on some high end luxury goods.

Check in was prompt, staff were friendly.  We were offered a bag porter and a tour of our room but because we were only there for 1 night (and in a rush for a show) we politely declined.

The interior of the hotel was stunning.
The room itself was spacious, clean with plenty of amenities.  A large comfortable bed and perfect pillows.
We ordered room service after attending our show and it was very fast.  
One downer was the mini bar was locked for some reason but it wasn't a big deal.

Breakfast the following morning was excellent. 
I will definitely stay at the Westbury again on my next visit to Dublin.  This was my first visit here but it will certainly not be my last.
Thank you very much for an enjoyable stay!",5,2018,02,09
203,Clinical,"The hotel reception cannot be faulted -
And I should be careful as I am still here -
But it‚Äôs attention to detail lacks the very important essential ingredient of personal service. 
We decided to have room service - until we saw the very very poor menu which is lazy and unacceptable for a purported five star hotel. The chef and the manager should hold their head in shame. That despite our plan to spend the evening enjoying the hotel‚Äôs menu, we sent out for a carry out. Certainly not how we planned to spend our anniversary. 
",3,2018,02,09
203,Exceptional  hotel in the city center,"Charming Hotel, very classy with A1 customer service.
Loved it very much here. Friendly staff, nice rooms with comfortable boxspring beds.

203,Great service and location,"This hotel is perfect for exploring Dublin, very well located just off Grafton Street. At times the main lobby/afternoon tea area is a little too loud and busy. Expensive but you get what you pay for in this hotel- food, service and surroundings are all excellent. Lovely decor and comfortable couches, recommend trying the cocktails at the hotel bar too.",5,2018,02,06
203,Relaxing weekend,From the reception staff to the telephone operator the courtesy and warm welcome extended was exceptional.  The location is central for tourist sites and transport access - with Trinity College at one end of Grafton Street and St Stephen's Green the other.  The hotel itself is luxurious with good sized rooms and very comfortable beds.  Although the breakfast and afternoon tea charges are too much the availability of cafes and restaurants within 200 yards of the hotel is extensive. Overall the customer service and the luxury we experienced was worth it.,5,2018,02,05
203,Disappointed,"Nice staff, very professional. very good bedding. Rich and good breakfast. Hotel very well located.
On the other hand, very disappointed of the room. Stains on the floor, the bedspread, the office chair. I reprogrammed the Nespresso because it did not work. Bad soundproofing (neighbors' noises at midnight and 3am). Poor quality of television, channels that do not exist (36 for Euronews etc ...)",3,2018,02,05
203,Best Hotel in central Dublin,I don't have one bad thing to say about this hotel. Great location to all amenities. Hotel facilities are excellent. Very child friendly also. Staff are courteous and professional at all times. 10/10.,5,2018,02,05
203,Westbury Hotel,"The hotel was excellent in all aspects, particularly its location, decor and service by the staff.The rooms and breakfast room were of the highest standard.  I would strongly recommend it to others and look forward to my next visit.",5,2018,02,05
203,Relaxing Afternoon Tea,"Well, what a way to spend a Sunday afternoon. We had been given a lovely present of a voucher for Champagne Afternoon tea which was a lovely treat. From the time we arrived in The Gallery, the staff looked after us so well. The afternoon tea was tasty and beautifully presented. We had a lovely full glass of Champagne and lots of cups of tea and coffee. There was plenty of food for both of us, we have good appetites, and we were offered more sandwich‚Äôs or scones if we had wanted them and we got replacement hot pots of coffee and tea also. There was also a really nice atmosphere and everyone around us seemed to having a lovely time too. I would strongly recommend it. ",5,2018,02,04
203,Top class ,"Stayed for 1 night only.
The staff make this hotel simply brilliant nothing is too much trouble and we were made feel extremely welcome from the great cocktails to the bottle of water given  when checking out at 0530 Sunday morning to go to the airport would recommend to anyone visiting Dublin ",5,2018,02,04
203,Relaxing Break,"Stayed at the Westbury this week, really well looked after. Lovely clean room, very friendly staff. Even when the people in the next room had TV full blast the staff sorted in 2 mins, apologising for any trouble caused!! Would highly recommend this Hotel. Perfect location also.",5,2018,02,03
203,Wonderful welcome at The Westbury,"Arrived at this beautiful hotel where we were greeted by a charming friendly receptionist . As it was 2 hrs before check in we expected to have to wait on our studio suite , yes we did wait but only 20 minutes. As we walked along Grafton Street my mobile rang to say our room was available . The suite was one of the nicest we have stayed in ,a 4 poster very comfortable bed, lots of luxurious little touches, all that anyone would require for an overnight stay. The bathroom was spacious and the shower had amazing water pressure which sometimes is sadly lacking in other hotels.
All the staff we encountered were friendly, courteous and helpful. Breakfast next morning was delicious I can highly recommend the eggs benedict and my husbands Irish fry was also very tasty. This was served by cheerful immaculately groomed staff.
I would definitely recommend this unquestionable 5* hotel to anyone travelling to Dublin who enjoys quality accommodation with tasteful decor and ambiance .
We cannot wait to return .",5,2018,02,02
203,GEARED 2018 Tea,"Arrived in Ireland in the morning and had booked a table for tea at 3pm. What a lovely hotel and lobby bar where the Tea is served. Such nice professional staff and the Tea was simply lovely.  Delicious tea sandwiches, pastries, scones just to name a few of the items. Plenty of food served to myself and two guests. The staff even asked Chef to substitute the seafood items since I do not eat seafood.  Just a wonderful and enjoyable relaxing time for friends to meet, talk in such a civilized setting. The Champagne was very tasty as well!!

I shall be back for Tea!",5,2018,02,01
203,Rob Breslin Knocked it Out of the Park!!,"After a full day spent enduring some shoddy, rude service in a nearby 5 star hotel, I retired to the tried and trusted Westbury for a pot of tea and a light snack. I was met by the most utterly professional, charming, polite, engaging and might I say 'resourceful' chap - Rob went above and beyond and I would be so grateful if somebody could pass on my sincerest thanks and I would suggest that your fellow hotels take a look at how a true masterclass in customer service is delivered. 

I'll be back and I look forward to meeting Rob and Stephen again soon.

203,Wonderful Cocktail Experience with a Friend,"Myself and my friend were out on Sunday night (28th Jan) and we wanted to just have a quiet drink before our Christmas party. We decided to go to the Sidecar Bar at the Westbury Hotel. We were greeted with smile straight away from one of the lovely female staff (failed to get her name). We took a seat and were given the extensive cocktail menu to ponder over. The lighting and the music really created a relaxed vibe and the open fire was a real treat. We ordered our gin cocktails and while were waiting the waitress presented us with a glass of prosecco along with some olives and roasted nuts. Such a nice touch. We both really enjoyed our cocktails and were really impressed with how friendly the staff were to us, making us feel very welcome. We were enjoying the experience so much we ended up being fashionably late for our party. I would highly recommend the Sidecar bar for anyone who wants a really good, well priced drink, in a relaxed environment with extremely friendly helpful staff. Thank you very much. Liz",5,2018,01,31
203,Absolutely first class experience ,"Had the pleasure of staying in The Westbury in December,from start to finish myself and my wife were treated like royalty from the minute we arrived. We were checked in by a  very friendly and welcoming man called Mohamed who greeted us on every occasion and even came to say goodbye after his shift. The hotel was out of this world and we hope to be back very soon.",5,2018,01,29
203,"Great Westbury,Very touching experience.","I was here in mid January 2018,to attend the sales meet. It was a pleasure to be here right from the 1st step, as soon as I reached the gentleman here cam running to take my luggage as the reception is on the level 1 and you enter the premise from the ground level.
The staff was extremely nice and humble to help me with the check in, getting aware of the nearby location. On my check out,It was so nice of the person at the reception to ask me for water bottle as I was leaving and I may need one on the journey. This was really touching. I wish I could remember his name,Tall,middle aged gentleman with a bald patch.
The rooms were clean and nicely planned, the food is amazing, the breakfast is very nice with a great atmosphere.
The overall atmosphere of the hotel is great.
The location is amazing, you are on the main shopping street which is the Graffton street,  with other major attraction like the Trinity College,St.Stephens Green and Temple Bar areas near by.
I wish to thank ""The Westbury"" team for their hospitality and wish them All the best for future business.",5,2018,01,28
203,Afternoon tea,Myself and my mother had afternoon tea here and it was amazing. I'm vegan and our server Eliana B was brilliant. We were absolutely stuffed and completely looked after. Not once did our cups run out of amazing coffee and the vegan food was delicious. Thank you again for the delightful experience ,5,2018,01,27
203,Perfect Weekend ,"I booked an overnight stay in the hotel along with afternoon tea for my girlfriend as a Christmas present.

Unbeknown to her I had contacted the hotel in advance of our arrival to inform them that I was planning to propose and the very helpful staff
(Arantxa) helped me to organise everything.

On arrival and throughout our stay every staff member we encountered in the hotel went above and beyond to make our weekend special in so many ways that it was a truly unforgettable weekend.

We stay in Dublin at least once a year and I can‚Äôt imagine we will ever stay anywhere else in the future.",5,2018,01,27
203,Always awesome!,My 4th or 5th stay and as always the Westbury does not disappoint. Steeped in history and old world charm but with a modern luxurious feel. Excellent service. Great location. Best hotel in Dublin by far.,5,2018,01,27
203,Noise,"Stayed recently in the Westbury.. hotel fantastic location rooms and food excellent.. stayed in a room facing onto Clarendon street and the noise from the street is unbearable. I can accept the noise from people leaving bars,but there seems to be an engine running at night it seemed to stop @5 am. I was offered another room at the end of the corridor but with the same view and noise.. I bought foam ear buds to get some sleep.
Another small gripe is the lobby area. Don‚Äôt think as a resident paying 5 star prices you will be able to sit there. The tables all seemed to be reserved,for non residents..
There is a bar but it‚Äôs more set up for table service but guess what,they are reserved as well. ",2,2018,01,27
203,World Class Westbury,Myself and my husband stayed here recently. We were attending a function in the city so the location of the hotel is superb. The staff on reception were very good.The room was so clean and had all necessary facilities and a few extra. The general atmosphere in the hotel heightened the excitement of our night out. The bed was extremely comfortable. We had the Irish breakfast which was pretty standard however the rest of the food at the breakfast was absolutely exceptional. Everything was so fresh and tasty. Again the breakfast staff were great. When we checked out the staff on this particular morning were part of what makes The Westbury the 5 star hotel it is. They illustrated the usual high standard expected but they were also able to have the little bit of banter with us about the night before. The bottles of water the gentleman provided to us very subtly was pure genius. I only wish I could remember their names.......maybe on our next visit. Would highly recommend the hotel.,5,2018,01,25
203,Terrible night's sleep,"I had high hopes for this hotel. It is centrally located, looks the part and the room was a decent size with a nice bathroom. Staff were polite and helpful.

Unfortunately, I had one of the worse nights sleep I've ever had in a hotel. Despite turning the A/C and everything else off, I was kept up all night by what sounded like dodgy plumbing - pipes rattling, water gushing, the full works. I only ended up managing to sleep for a couple of hours.

Definitely one I will be not return to when Dublin beckons.",2,2018,01,23
203,"Best location, very authentic and pleasant hotel","The Westbury is probaby one of the top-3 hotels in Dublin.
Very well located (only few meters from Grafton Street).
Very welcoming staff, comfortable bedrooms and halls.
Very nice furnitures and very clean, to recommend.
",5,2018,01,23
203,Love This Hotel,"This is a 5+ star hotel as far as I'm concerned. Stayed here with my husband for a business trip (with some fun too!) Beautiful Foyer with Gorgeous Fresh Flowers.  The restaurant and bar are first class in every way. Ambiance and decor, well made drinks, fantastic food served by the friendliest and most attentive servers.  Great central location close to shopping, pubs (of course), fine dining and historical sites.  The rooms are great and I especially loved the bathrooms for their abundance of shelves and drawers for storing all of my husband's and my toiletries.  I really can't say enough about this hotel and their amazing staff. Friendly, professional and warm. 
Wouldn't stay anywhere else!!!!",5,2018,01,22
203,Fantastic Hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel, right in the heart of Dublin City it is in Grafton St. beside St . Stephens Green great , i have mainly visited this hotel for meals or special occasions, shopping trips close to shops  , You will not be dissapointed service, food perfect.  Book in advance especially at busy times of year.",5,2018,01,22
203,Oozes class pty about the rooms,"Firstly the HUGE positives
- Location excellent
- Staff = wonderful
- Reception area/Dining is always amazing
- Car parking done by Valet is handy but not having access to car is slightly annoying...
Negatives:
When we arrived we enquired about an upgrade and we were told that one was available for an extra ‚Ç¨30. So we took it.
Now the room was perfectly fine except it looks jaded. The bathroom was small and the shower was in the bath with them hideous glass partitions !!! The bed was very comfy and the duvet delightful
I thought upon getting the upgrade that the room would be big and the view exciting unfortunately neither materialised !!
In summary I would certainly go back here again it reeks of decadence. However I would perhaps do a little more research into the room options...",4,2018,01,22
203,Central - pricey but if you want a swanky central hotel you can't get much better!,"Lovely hotel - it is what it is. We would't usually stay/eat/drink in somewhere as swanky as this to be honest - it was a parents anniversary. To me it is expensive, but if you are happy with the price, you won't get better location. Services in the hotel were excellent. At check in, the room for my parents wasn't ready - so as it was their anniversary, they got an upgrade! What more could you possibly ask for! Staff - lovely. Service - lovely.",5,2018,01,22
203,"Great location, wonderful hotel but rooms are only OK","Best luxury hotel location in Dublin only 50m from Grafton st and the back entrance has all cafe, shops and bars etc on the doorstep. The hotel is outstanding, breakfast room, service and breakfast menu is all excellent, bars are also outstanding with wonderful cocktails and brilliant service. Rooms are very good but in my opinion don't match the rest of the hotel, hotel has the WOW factor but the rooms don't. Average bathroom with poor water pressure and very average shower for a luxury property and the price you are paying. Ask for a renovated room my room was in poor condition and not cleaned at all. Dust, mould, leaking tap, poor water pressure and TV had poor reception.",4,2018,01,21
203,Beautiful hotel in the heart of the city,"We stayed here for New Year‚Äôs Eve for one night with breakfast included.

The hotel is in a fantastic location, right in the heart of the city. 

The exterior was beautifully decorated for Christmas. 

Staff greet you outside the hotel and take your bags to have them delivered to your room. Check in was very friendly and efficient.

Our room was clean, bright with all you could want - nice seating area, big comfortable bed, and a spacious bathroom. 

We came back after dinner to jazz playing in the bar - the decor and comfortable couches added to the great atmosphere. 

After a great night‚Äôs sleep,we had breakfast  in the hotel. Just like the rest of the hotel, it is beautifully decorated with efficient, friendly staff. 

There was a buffet of pastries, bread, fruit etc. as well as choice of whatever you would like cooked to order from a hot menu. I highly recommend having scrambled eggs - they were the best I have ever had. 

Can‚Äôt wait to stay again next time I am in Dublin.",5,2018,01,21
203,a wow customer experience,"this hotel was exceptional from the moment I called to book my room the reservation staff member was so attentive and on arrival we were greeted with a smile using our name.  The check in was hassle free as we were a little early the room was not yet ready no problem for us our bags were looked after by the staff.  We headed off on returning to the hotel all was in order and our room was a wow no other words to describe it was perfect.  Once in our room we received a call from the customer service manager to ask was all in order and to wish us a pleasant stay.  I will certainly be coming back to the Westbury, I am in business myself and will be promoting your hotel with my clients and my colleagues all in all a fabulous customer experience Thank you",5,2018,01,19
203,Amazing Afternoon Tea ,"We attended the Westbury on Saturday for afternoon tea and absolutely loved it .

The service from the staff was first class , the food was amazing.

The Nutella hot chocolate was out of this world .

It‚Äôs more all you can eat afternoon tea that the standard tea . 

Massive value and relaxation for your money .

Will defo be back regards Greig & Joanne Wilson",5,2018,01,17
203,Luxury in the city centre,"Always love coming to stay here. Feel at home from the moment I arrive in the door. 
Such a great location just off Grafton Street. The lounge area is just fantastic place to relax and have meetings. 
Back in a couple of weeks and looking forward to it already. 

",5,2018,01,16
203,Afternoon Tea at the Westbury,"While visiting Dublin, we wanted to find time for afternoon tea and the Westbury showed up on several top lists and it did not disappoint. The Westbury does Tea right, not pretentious or overly formal (you can dress casually) but still served in a formal setting complete with fine china and presentation. They have an online appointment system, but you can also check at the hotel for same day walk up reservations which we were glad we did. The afternoon tea comes with the tower of goodies including 4 sandwiches, scones/clotted cream and jam, and an assortment of sweets at the top/final layer. I liked that they allow you to swap or double up on sandwich choices for allergy or personal preference (Hint: they have PB&J). Also, don‚Äôt over stuff yourselves as they will gladly package your leftovers in a nice carry box. Definitely worth a visit if in Dublin. The price is a splurge but comparable to other formal teas in the area ",5,2018,01,16
203,Afternoon Tea,"Visited recently for afternoon tea. On arrival you are greeted and seated in a very nice setting, the staff are super friendly and explain whats included in the tea. The room and furniture are comfortable and you feel relaxed straight away. The sandwiches are delicious and have a variety of flavors. Scones, Jam and a selection of cakes are included. When we finished our sandwiches we were asked if we would like more which is very nice. The selection of teas and coffee is also super and i had the best flat white i have EVER had!!! loved it from start to finish, staff a credit to the hotel",5,2018,01,15
203,How things have changed.,"Having stayed at this hotel over the years , from one wedding to just staying over many times , I actually called my last review ‚Äú home from home ‚Äú.

While I had not stayed in a while , I decided to book this hotel for a couple of nights while my daughter came home for Christmas from over seas. 

We had to change rooms as the 1st room was very small and the bathroom was tiny , the 2nd room was one I never liked over my many times staying here so after a quick chat with the assistant front desk manager we were moved to a room 
I stayed in before which had a double bed I had asked for a superior twin but at this stage I let it go.

After a few other discrepancies I asked to speak to a manager who than went on to tell me the amount of staff the hotel
employed as was generally rude at this stage I asked to speak with the assistant manager or manger of hotel but we‚Äôre told they were not in , while I just passed them in the reception area than were told they were in a meeting. 

On leaving I was told my the assistant front desk manager that I most definitely would hear back from management, I am still waiting.....

On the good side concierge staff were as always professional and lovely and the Wilde restaurant was fabulous with wonderful staff the location excellent.

Front of house are their to see your stay is stress free and are your first point of call unfortunately for me this was not representative of The Westbury Hotel or the Doyle group.

",3,2018,01,12
203,Fabulous,Everything about the hotel was just so special. Loved the feeling of luxury in the public areas. The flower arrangements were fabulous. Staff were so well trained and had no problem with any request. Loved their uniform too. Breakfast brilliant - excellent choice of cooked options. All in all perfect from start to finish!,5,2018,01,09
203,Wilde restaurant,"I had a great lunch on the 30th of December in amazing restaurant Wilde :) The beef burger was delicious and the atmosphere was lovely. 
Special thanks to my server Ana. She was very friendly and she really made me smile. I also wish to say thank you to the restaurant manager Jan.
Thank you for being kind and profesional.
The restaurant staff really look at every detail! 
I will return for sure! :)",5,2018,01,07
203,Luxury in city centre,"Luxury in city centre Dublin, location perfect, safe parking, very comfortable beds and attentive staff. Nothing negative to say about this lovely hotel hope to be back soon. Close to shops, bars, restaurants and public transport if needed.",5,2018,01,06
203,Trip to Dublin,"Spent last night here and quite disappointed for the price. Nothing particularly wrong but may not have been suitable for the trip we had. Came up to see turner exhibition at national gallery and dine out so did not use facilities of the hotel. Added a guest which was facilitated at significant extra charge, a bed was added to the room but no extra towels, cup or glass and only one pillow, also drinks left in window sill by previous guests had not been removed. Good shower and very comfortable bed but noice from air conditioning which could not be turned off disturbed sleep. All Staff that we dealt with were pleasant and left luggage facility was useful. Just not great for the price but accept that this review is very subjective.",3,2018,01,04
203,Cocktails ,Called for cocktails during our stay in Dublin at the new year. Great cocktail selection to choose from. Bit pricey compared to regular bars in the area. But it is a lovely comfortable hotel bar in a great location just off grafton street. Will return. ,5,2018,01,04
203,Stay at the Westbury Dublin,"The Hotel is outstanding, the Staff are exceptional and make you feel comfortable and welcome.
We have stayed in the Hotel a few times now and wish to make it our annual get away, the over all word is ""Beautiful"" .. ",5,2018,01,04
203,Paul & Olive,"We had a really nice relaxing stay at he Westbury Hotel in a very friendly warm environment. There was a lovely Christmas atmosphere with some lovely Irish bars located close by.
We will making a return trip in the not so distant future!",5,2018,01,04
203,Festive Afternoon Tea,"A stunning setting for afternoon tea heightened by the Christmas decorations. Delicious food, expertly presented with great gluten free alternatives. 

The only downside was the table size. There was not enough room for the tea pots for our party, so when the food arrived things got a bit chaotic. I would have given a rating of five, but considering this is a five star hotel which regularly caters afternoon tea, overflowing tables should not be an issue. We were provided with a small side table, but certain items still had to be placed on the floor or peoples laps to accommodate the tiered stands. However I will return again. ",4,2018,01,03
203,Afternoon tea,"I was treated to Afternoon tea here as it is my favourite afternoon tea venue! The standard of food was, as always, perfect! The tea was nice too but I only got to try 1 this time as it was so difficult to get service. I had to leave me seat 3 times to call a waiter and we had to ask for cream 4 Times before it arrived. It was a disappointing visit because of this but on the up side we sat for hours chatting as it took so long to be served! We waited 40
Minutes from the time we were seated until our order was taken!! Hopefully it was just a glitch on the day and their service has not deteriorated.",5,2018,01,01
203,Weekend with family.,"Beautiful hotel, fabulous location, rooms small but nice, fabulous meal in the Wilde restaurant,  but breakfast was a disaster, area was too small & staff seemed to be under pressure, ordered gluten free but didn‚Äôt get it, food came out after waiting 40 mins & then it fell off tray, so left and went out to nearby area for food , one night for 4 of us cost 1.100‚Ç¨ & that did not include our dinner as we payed separately for that. So really I think it‚Äôs a lovely hotel but seriously over priced for what we got. ",3,2018,01,01
203,Central location,"Beautiful hotel inside . Room stayed in was a superior king bed room- disappointed in size of room as have  stayed in lesser stared hotels with bigger room and more modern. Staff were fantastic as nothing was no bother- second to none. Breakfast not impressed as minimal and quite squashed in the breakfast area. Nevertheless very central to Dublin life  and other eateries. Just think over rated. Would I stay here again - most definitely yes.  . Lovely looking down onto Grafton Street too.
Kettle plug at one side of room and kettle at other. Little coffee biscuit would have been appreciated in rooms too.",4,2017,12,30
203,Centrally located,"The Westbury is in a great location with easy access to shopping, restaurants and pubs. The hotel lobby is classy and the bed was comfortable however the bathroom was quite small with no seperate shower. Some of the fixtures in the room also required maintenance. The breakfast service was poor - we had to ask to have our order taken and coffee never came. Food was average - quite disappointed for a hotel of this standard/reputation. Concierge service was excellent 

",4,2017,12,30
203,Magical Christmas Stay at the Westbury,"My family and I decided to spend Christmas at the Westbury in Dublin and from start to finish our stay was sublime. The attention to detail, thoughtfulness and festive cheer made our Christmas Eve and Christmas Day truly magical. We had time to catch up in a beautiful festive setting and spent the time eating exceptional food and enjoying some of the best service we have ever experienced. We had three children aged 8, 6 and 3 and the room was a very special experience for them with a teepee tent and extra gifts from santa. When santa arrived as we sat for dinner their little faces were a picture of wonder and awe. 
I cannot recommend the Westbury highly enough for the perfect family Christmas. 
We look forward to our next stay.",5,2017,12,29
203,One of the best place to stay in Dublin,"The rooms are clean, lovely & spacious with nespresso  coffee machine. Breakfast is great and  lobby Ambience is pretty, always nice and busy, dining experience in the hotel is one of the best in town. Located at the shopping spots üëçüèªüòä",5,2017,12,29
203,Discovery weekend,"Wonderful Hotel.
Hotel is very closed to the Temple Bar place. Good room and services. Nice cocktails at the bar.
Lot of bars and restaurants near the hotel.
You can go by feet to the Trinity College to see the Book of Kells.",5,2017,12,28
203,Brilliant customer service ! ,We‚Äôve checked in with my sister on the 26th of December for a couple of night it didn‚Äôt start of very well but Gareth Ford really tried he‚Äôs hardest to make us feel welcome and comfortable he was extremely kind. The following day we had to change our room and Aleksandra Puskaric was extremely professional and looked after us to the highest customer skills. She made us feel welcome and made sure we were both happy. I will definitely recommend this wonderful hotel to friends and family not only for the perfect location but mainly for its brilliant team. Once again thank you. ,5,2017,12,28
203,Fab,"Fab hotel with best level of service and the nicest staff from reception to valet to bar and restaurant, would recommend this hotel to anyone, expensive but you get what you pay for. We love it and see you next time.",5,2017,12,25
203,Christmas Night Out,"We stayed here for my husbands Christmas work night out. The hotel is very decadent, our room was lovely but it was very warm. I had the air conditioning on but I couldn't sleep with the heat. Breakfast was scrumptious. This was our only meal in the hotel as we ate in a nearby restaurant. The cocktail menu in the hotel was extensive and reasonably priced.",4,2017,12,24
203,Ladies night out,"Brilliant hotel, great experience with my friends on night out. Cocktails amazing and free glass of champagne while we waited for them! Great ambiance, great attention to detail. Will definitely return",5,2017,12,24
203,Our Annual Pre Christmas stay,"We have been coming to The Westbury at Christmas and sometimes during the year for the last 21 years.
We have never been disappointed with any of our stays and we are so well looked after each time from the moment we arrive until we leave. We always look forward to the next time we will be coming back to stay again. It feels like home away from home for us",5,2017,12,23
203,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed here last October and it was amazing. The service was top notch, and the food was exquisite. Everyone who worked there were really friendly. It was also within short walking distance of the bar district. 

One small thing was that it was a little bit noisy one night.

100%",5,2017,12,21
203,Great hotel in a great location,Stayed here with family & friends.  The staff are so friendly and you are made to feel very welcome.  Location in the centre of the city is fantastic.  Rooms were very spacious with everything you would need.  We dined in their Wilde Restaurant and that was a fab experience.  Definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2017,12,21
203,Perfection,"I cannot say a bad thing, every time I visit, I‚Äôm treating myself. The bar is one of the best in the world. The oysters are always spot on, perfect temperature, quickly served from the kitchen. Gin martinis are Devine, made as you like. One day , I may just decide to live there.",5,2017,12,20
203,Great for high tea and light bites,"When I lived in Dublin I enjoyed coming here, with friends, to have high tea or to eat an appetizer, with a glass of wine. It's the most centrally located hotel in Dublin City, with beautiful rich decor and good customer service. I have not stayed overnight here, because I lived nearby, however I know this place well and I am disappointed by some of the poor reviews posted by others. 

- The bar in this hotel is sometimes booked out for a private party (not that common).  At these times you will NOT be able to access the bar, regardless of whether you are an overnight guest or not. You have alternatives, for example you can sit in the main lobby (beside the bar) and order a drink there. 
- Parking here can be tricky and complicated, for a new driver, because access and entry to the parking is on a very narrow one-way street. They have a valet service that can help you.",5,2017,12,20
203,Excellent,"Our party of 4 stayed at the Westbury for one night . Its our annual Christmas shopping day and evening. This was our 10th year without interruption. Some years we stayed in nearby hotels but keep going back to the Westbury. All 4 of us would be quite critical when it comes to choosing a hotel to return to but all are agreed that the Westbury is the best Hotel in the area for many reasons.
A bit pricey but ..........its Christmas after all.",1,2017,12,19
203,Inner city luxury,"From check in at this beautiful hotel we felt well looked after. The Hotel sits in the centre of Dublin, close to many points of interest.
The rooms are luxurious with a large cosy bed, delicious Nespresso coffee machine and excellent room service. Little touches were detailed and made all the difference. Room service brought cookies to our room for our son one evening which was unexpected and delightfully welcome!!
Can highly recommend this hotel.
The restaurant where we had breakfast is beautifully decorated and the staff cater to your every need. We indulged in coffee, juice, croissants, cooked omelette and rounds of toast and breakfast and felt that we had excellent value for money. ",5,2017,12,17
203,Very annoyed.,Booked in tonight had to park in another car park and walk back to the hotel. Went out for a meal and returned to the hotel at 21.00 for a drink to be told we were not allowed into the bar as it was full.  This has never happened to me in my lifetime. Horrified,2,2017,12,15
203,One of the finest hotels,"This hotel is simply divine. 
From the moment you walk in, you realise you are experiencing a hotel on another level. 

The rooms are beautiful and the service you receive is second to none - classical music was waiting for my return in the evening, bed turned down, chocolates..water by the bedside. You do not receive this sort of thing in any old hotel. 

The staff are polite and very helpful, all smartly dressed and well spoken.

Breakfast is absolutely delicious with fresh orange juice served in carafe in an ice bucket by the table. All hot and fresh, no help-yourself past its best hot buffet here (thank goodness). 

I visited during the Christmas period on a work trip, the entire hotel was decorated to the highest standard with the most beautiful floral arrangements and festive decorations.

We also held a meeting here in the conference suite. Again, wonderful food and service. Fresh pastries and hot drinks were available and hot soup for lunch. The room for this exceeded anything experienced for work ever before.

So yes, I'm still on the 'come down' from staying here. I imagine it will be hard to beat this superior experience and I will be unable to rate other hotels 5 stars on here unless they match The Westbury!",5,2017,12,15
203,Afternoon Tea ,The afternoon tea was fabulous. Our requests were catered for. Sandwiches and cakes were second to none.  Service was caring and attentive .  It was a family Christmas get together. We all had a great time. Thank you Westbury.  ,5,2017,12,12
203,Can I live here??,"Everything about this hotel is amazing. The staff went out of there way to make our stay feel special. As it was my birthday I received a beautiful little birthday cake with my afternoon tea and again at dinner. I also received a lovely little happy birthday card from guest relations to my room which I thought was very nice and thoughtful. The afternoon tea is to die for and we got the best seat in the house by the window. Our room was big, warm, and comfortable. We had dinner in Wilde that night, again this was amazing from start to finish. We absolutely loved everything about this hotel and our stay. We can't wait to come back every year for my birthday. looking forward to next year already. Thanks again. ",5,2017,12,12
203,A Hotel Full of Class,"I recently stayed at The Westbury with my son during a weekend away in Dublin. From the moment the doors are opened by the doorman you instantly feel you‚Äôre in one of the Leading Hotels of The World. There‚Äôs a distinctly classic/Art Deco feel to the hotel and this is definitely brought to your attention when you step inside the lift. On reaching our room we found it homely and very comfortable and it had everything you‚Äôd want in a room at a five star hotel.
The hotel‚Äôs location is a massive plus point. It‚Äôs right in the thick of the action but just set back enough that it doesn‚Äôt have lots of passing traffic. I‚Äôd thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a classy stay in Dublin. ",5,2017,12,12
203,Nicest Hotel Stay I've Ever Had,"I stayed in the Westbury for two nights midweek. The experience was exceptional from start to finish. When we arrived in the room there were welcome chocolates and desserts as well as a card from the guest relations team congratulating me on my graduation. The room was lovely, shower and bed phenomenal. We had drinks in the Sidecar bar that night, breakfast in Wilde and lunch in Balfes the next day, all were buzzing. I loved the Christmas decorations and the open fires throughout the hotel. The second night we had a family dinner in Wilde which was beautiful. We were a large table and had a lovely corner to the restaurant all to ourselves which was really nice and intimate. The views from the restaurant and the lobby of the corner of Grafton Street are fab too. This was the nicest hotel stay I've ever had. The staff were incredible, especially the guest relations team who helped my print my graduation tickets in a moment of panic and Derek on the front door. It's going to be very hard to stay in other hotels after how good this stay was.",5,2017,12,11
203,Expensive but deserves 5 stars,"Westburyhotel. Not quite on Grafton Street but nevertheless central and in the luxury category. Spacious, a muted elegance, helpful staff always on hand and prices to match. Rooms OK but not sensational. However well serviced with valuable turn down service at night. Main restaurant Wilfe, quite formal and expensive - expect at least 75 euros for dinner, but standards high. For breakfast 25 euros, better to try Balfes on the G floor. Terrace restaurant for lunch menu a bit limited. Overall they look after you and are helpful. If you can afford it then you will enjoy it.",5,2017,12,09
203,No better location,"Excellently located hotel just off Grafton Street and just round the corner from Brown Thomas. The staff are all very helpful and knowledgable. As two ladies on a shopping trip, we had booked a twin room - this was nice enough but really small and not nearly as luxurious as you'd expect for the very high price. All food was excellent, particularly the  breakfast, with loads of choice as well as some items cooked to order. As the day was running away with us, we ended up eating in the bar in the evening , and the food was very good here as well. Overall, the Westbury is a nice hotel but not good value for money, in my opinion.",4,2017,12,08
203,Natasha Murtagh ,"I stay at this hotel every year at this time of year and get in some Christmas shopping . Excellent stay again,your every wish is catered for and it is not over fussy. Breakfast is outstanding. Decorations gorgeous.
",5,2017,12,06
203,Presentation par excellence,"A party of 4 of us arrived for lunch yesterday, depleted from our original booked number of 12!!
We had a lovely lunch , table-d‚Äôhote, courtesy of a change of mind of the management, as the set menu had been intended, only for the graduates who were lunching with their families and was unintentionally presented to us.
Each course was worthy of being photographed it looked so good and tasted even better.
A definite must for foodies",4,2017,12,06
203,Afternoon Tea was AMAZING,"Afternoon tea was absolutely amazing!!! Lots of food given for afternoon tea, and the teas and coffees provided were equally as delicious!! Highly recommend.

Our server, who's name i THINK was Marta, was also very lovely and helpful.",5,2017,12,05
203,Fantastic location,"Stayed here recently on a birthday trip to Dublin and it was lovely, and it's location was brilliant, right at the heart of where we wanted to be, close to Stephens Green, Grafton Street and our favourite pubs",5,2017,12,04
203,Afternoon Tea not very impressive,"I had afternoon tea in the Westbury recently. I called up before I arrived to let them know that I would like the vegetarian option and they said they would make a note on the reservation. When we arrived, however, they asked if there any dietary requirements and I told them again. 

The vegetarian options were very tasteless. A quinoa wrap with veggies was very bland and tofu and tomato sandwich was also very tasteless. There was also a cucumber sandwich which was fine and a Waldorf salad sandwich which just tasted like mayonnaise. The sandwiches seemed like they had been made much earlier that day as the bread was curling on the edges and they were also quite cold and soggy in places. 

The sweets were tasty and the scones were very nice. However, we asked twice for raspberry jam instead of strawberry but the waiter did not seem to understand us and kept bringing more strawberry jam. 

I would recommend making tastier vegetarian options.",2,2017,12,04
203,Really nice little touches,"Stayed here for our anniversary. We brought our 3 month old and 1 year old so they could see the Christmas lights and vibes in town. We were given a beautiful room with a big comfy bed. There were 2 teddy bears waiting for our children which was so sweet. The Christmas decorations in the hotel were amazing and my son loved the tree with the giant Nutcrackers. We went out in the evening and when we came back to the room there was a tray of (amazing) cookies and glasses of milk. A really nice touch. Breakfast was great, we went for the continental and there was a great range of everything. The thing that I like most about The Westbury was definitely the staff. They were so friendly and made a big effort with our children. Think we're going to make a trip to The Westbury on our anniversary an annual event!",5,2017,12,01
203,The Gallery @ The Westbury Hotel - Enjoyable - Relaxed Afternoon Tea,"Went here for my Mothers 79th Birthday with my daughter. Choice of Sandwiches and desserts, scones lovely.  Would have like to sit at the window, but understand they are only for x 2 people.  When I booked I had mentioned it was a special occasion and it was only when the server overhead us talking that she organized a Celebration Birthday Plate, just little delight with ""Happy Birthday"" written on plate - nice touch. Been for afternoon tea a few times in various hotels, but always like it explained to me.  Had to ask for a hot tea, and replenish the cups.  Personally, I am not a tea drinker so a few sips of breakfast tea and I am done, would like to option to have a water included in the price of your tea, I know you can always order as extra but feel a bottle of water should be included. Always feel hungry afterwards too.  Service was attentive, staff pleasant, boxed the delights we did not finish.  ‚Ç¨47.00 regular Afternoon tea, there is also a Champagne tea if you require.",4,2017,11,30
203,Great location,"I spent one night at The Westbury on business at the start of the month. Is certainly a quality hotel, with attentive and friendly staff. I liked the fact that it was very close to the action around Grafton St and the centre of the city. 

My room was nice without being great. Bland interior and pretty mean with 'extras'. As others have mentioned, the mini-bar is very expensive and whilst there was complimentary tea & coffee making facilities it would've been nice to throw in a packet of biscuits or something! I slightly resented having to crack into the over-priced snacks. 

Breakfast was very good and the restaurant staff could not be faulted.",3,2017,11,28
203,Afternoon Tea,"What a fantastic time i had with my best friend last Friday 24 Nov 2017 we pick somewhere nice to start our Christmas Cheer every year and this year we decided to pick the Westbury, and we were not disappointed. From the moment we entered the Hotel to the time we left the service was brilliant. The Staff were so friendly and chatty and so very kind and they were beautiful turned out so well dressed. The food was fab and the a great variety of Teas and great value for money, again Thank you for helping me make memories xxxx keep up the great work xxxx",5,2017,11,27
203,Drinks and dinner,"Did not stay here but had dinner and drinks with coworkers who stayed for two nights.  Restaurant had excellent menu and wine selections.

Bar is fantastic.  If you like mixed drinks this is the place.  All bar staff are well trained and can find something you like.

203,Modern in great location ,"We stayed three nights at this deluxe hotel in central Dublin. The location is 1/2 block off a walking mall , close to Trinity College and the Book of Kells a must see in Dublin.
     The hotel is very modern inside with marble lobby  and large popular space for high tea ( book in advance as it‚Äôs always booked). Off the lobby is their high end restaurant, where we had many excellent meals with good service. 
       Our room was good sized, but not overly luxurious. The bathroom was decent , but not large . 
     The concierge was excellent!
For our first visit to Dublin this was a very nice hotel with good service and excellent location.",4,2017,11,24
203,Perfect!,Great welcome from staff as soon as we walked in the door.  Food was excellent in all the resturants at the Westbury.  Wonderful room service as well. The Gallery was a great atmosphere to unwind after a long day of exploring the great city of Dublin. The location was ideal easy access to all areas of interest and of course shopping.  Will definitely return next year,5,2017,11,24
203,Outdated facilities. Good service  ,"Wasn't overly impressed with the service either. It's just as expected from a 5 stars ""small leading"" hotel. The facilities are a disgrace, especially the gym. Knowing that Dublin is a rainy city, if guests have to use their own key to access, and no staff is ever there, why isn't  it a 24h gym? Also very small and equipment sucks. Very old TV in the rooms. No charger next to bed, and very pricy mini bar. ",2,2017,11,23
203,Very high service ,"Excellent service. Whether having a drink at the lounge or dinner in the restaurant, all staff made me feel wonderful. Maid service was very good with a very nice nightly turndown and refresh. Bed comfortable, sheets soft and good quality for a good night sleep. ",5,2017,11,23
203,Awesome ,"Went to the Westbury hotel today for festive afternoon tea with my friend.
We got ripped off by airport taxi man who charged us 55 euros (we paid 26 euros for return trip to the airport- make sure you ask for printed receipt that way dodgy ones are filtered out) 
Anyway moving onto the actual afternoon tea, staff were really good they placed us even though we turned up an hour early. There were difficulties but they  accommodated  us as soon as they realised we will be heading back to the airport in short space of time. They gave us extra matcha brownies and were just so lovely to us, one staff in particular was just amazing I wish I had asked for her name. Also wished I could have left more tip alas I was ripped off by the taxi man. 
Some of the desserts were totally out of this world and some were not as great but that one particular staff just made our experience so brilliant. She made sure that a taxi was booked for us from the hotel, advised us on when we should leave etc 
I would definitely go back again!! ",4,2017,11,21
203,amazing member of staff,On our first vist to the West bury we had a great experience due to your member of staff called Ecaterima she made us feel very welcome and was very friendly. thank you again to Ecaterima for our experience today.,5,2017,11,20
203,Afternoon tea,"Amazing tea selection, great service and really good food. Loved the turkey sandwich!! Thanks for a really great experience!
I would recommend the afternoon tea for everyone who are looking for a bit of a treat. ",5,2017,11,20
203,Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin!,"Great location, staff, interiors, bar & restaurant. From the personal greeting when we arrived, to hot towels to refresh ourselves upon arrival and the turn down service chocolate there was not a detail that was too small. My husband and I will stay here every time we come to Dublin, can not praise this hotel enough!!!",5,2017,11,20
203,Weekend Break,"I arrived at the Westbury completely jet lagged after travelling from Brisbane. I was staying in Dublin for the weekend before travelling down the country. The experience from beginning to end could not have been better. Even though it was extremely busy I never felt like just another guest to accommodate. The staff, who were of many different nationalities, were all amazing. ",5,2017,11,20
203,High tea with friends,"First high tea here and was a good experience. Staff were all very nice and helpful, great service. They made me a vegan and almost raw high tea as requested in advance as they said this was no trouble at all. My friends regular high tea looked very decadent and delicious. Great choice of teas too. Yes it is expensive, but nice as a treat:)",5,2017,11,18
203,A Great Stay at the Westbury,"We arrived in Dublin, from an overnight flight, tired and hungry. The staff did everything they could do to get us into a room as soon as possible.  While waiting, we had a fantastic breakfast at Wilde. We were soon in our room and able to relax for a bit before exploring the city. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet. My only possible fault with the room was the wifi could be spotty at times. Use the nightly turn down service, the chocolates are quite tasty. ",5,2017,11,16
203,Perfect hotel,"What a wonderful hotel the photos don‚Äôt do it justice it is far better inside 
Food and breakfast out of this world and rooms lovely we had an executive room  my cousin was in the presidential suite well this was something else size if someone‚Äôs house and it was so good Ihighly recommend this to anyone",5,2017,11,15
203,afternoon tea,"We had last Sunday afternoon tea in Westbury. We could not be happier with location, service, food...The girl who was looking after us,was excellent! her name was Marta. We will be back for sure :). Thanks",5,2017,11,14
203,So so!,"A beautiful art deco bar, convenient location, friendly staff and a lovely lounge for taking tea with auntie. You might think this would be enough, but sadly not! Intermittent wi fi, tiny bathrooms and a noisy nearby pub all meant that the experience to expense ratio was not good!",3,2017,11,14
203,Quality all the way,"Seldom do I write a review where I can't mention something where improvements could be made but the Westbury is just perfect.
Luxury, top class service, cleanliness, friendly professional staff, perfect location, beds with extraordinary comfort ..... the list just goes on and on.
I stayed here for 4 nights on a business trip, with my husband joining me for the final 2.
From the minute my taxi pulled up at the front door to the final minutes when the porter handed my husband back the key to his car which had been prepacked we were given star treatment.
One tip: get down early for breakfast as it's an experience to be savoured.
I'll be backüëèüëèüëè",5,2017,11,14
203,Fabulous time and service at 'afternoon tea',"My wife, Myself and daughter spent several hours this afternoon (November 13, 2017) enjoying 'afternoon tea'
Our waiter Rob provided exceptional  professional service. He's a gem. 
What a great time!
Thank you Rob and Westbury hotel.

203,Fabulous Dublin getaway,"I came from the States with a group of friends for a friend's birthday celebration, I could not have been happier with the location, ambiance, service, comfort or overall delightfulness of this hotel!",5,2017,11,13
203,Lovely cocktails,"We stopped in here for some post sightseeing cocktails and immediately wished we had booked for afternoon tea.

The lounge area was fabulous, staff were lovely & the drinks were great! I would definitely recommend.",4,2017,11,12
203,Excellent! ,"I had afternoon tea there and it was beautifully done! Great atmosphere. The sandwiches were delicious as was the tea itself. The sweets looked more like sculptures than sweets! The scones were also really, really good! The tea was very pricey, but worth it!",5,2017,11,10
203,"Beautiful Comfortable Hotel, Great Service","This is a wonderful hotel with all the amenities you would expect from a high end hotel. The room was large and although the d√©cor was more traditional, it had all the modern amenities. Bed was super super comfy (yes, two ""super""s!). Get the breakfast included in your rate, you will be very happy with it. It has a really sizable continental buffet (yogurts, cereals, pasteries, fruits, juices, etc..) and then you can from their entries cooked to order. It's easy to see what you are paying for here. And the location was great, we walked all over the place. I also want to note that on one of the days, we signed up for a day trip where we had to be at the train station at 6:45, but the hotel's breakfast doesn't start until 7am. When we went to the concierge desk the night before to see what we could do, he promptly did the following - asked if we needed a taxi to the train station and what time, asked if we needed a wake up call, and asked what we'd like for breakfast (we said just coffee and some pastries would be fine). At 6:15 the next morning, we came downstairs and our taxi was waiting for us, and on the counter were two to-go bags with pastries, yogurts, and fruit, and a tray with a coffee pot, 2 to-go cups, cream and sugar and stir sticks so we could make our coffees. At the train station, we ate our to-go breakfast and drank our coffee, and marveled in the crazy high level of service we got. THAT is what you pay for when you stay in hotels such as this. Really great stay. Would highly recommend.",5,2017,11,09
203,Luxury in the heart of the city,"We stayed for 5 days at the Westbury and had a great experience with the property and its lovely staff.  The breakfast was very nice (continental buffet + made to order hot items) and the afternoon tea was exceptional (The Art of Millinery Afternoon Tea).  There's turn down service and 2 complimentary bottles of water daily, which is a nice touch.  

My only complaint is there is no real lobby to lounge in. The seating is devoted to various restaurants and there's one sofa near the entrance (too drafty) and another one along the wall from the front desk.  Not sure what can be done about it, but makes it hard to meet anyone in the lobby.",5,2017,11,09
203,Beautiful hotel,We were traveling with an alumni group and spent 3 nights here.  The hotel was very nice and our room was beautifully appointed and very spacious.  The staff was very helpful.  Breakfast was excellent with a wide variety of options.  It was very centrally located so it was an easy walk to see the sights.,5,2017,11,08
203,A Wonderful Experience,"I stayed in The Westbury in October 2017 as the result of winning a competition.  It was my first experience of a 5 star hotel and I was quite apprehensive.  But from the moment I arrived I was treated with the utmost respect and kindness.  The first surprise was a warm cloth at reception to freshen my face and hands - wonderful after a 3 hour bus trip!  Reception staff were just lovely and made me feel relaxed and welcome.  Then the lift - there was a padded seat in the lift - wow!  My room was really lovely, not a great view but its city centre views and it was so quiet.  I could write for paragraphs about the room - coffee machine along with tea facilities.  Bathrobes to die for and a great bathroom.  If I could have fitted the bed in my suitcase I would have - only joking!!  I had the best night's sleep that night.  Dinner was sublime, with the most gracious staff. I felt so relaxed.  Breakfast was a joy - the cooked breakfast was cooked to order -real eggs  - buffet was only for ""cold"" breakfasts. I truly could have stayed there all morning. Even though I was only there for one night - I felt I had a real min-break and returned home refreshed and happy;  a feeling that stayed with me for a few days. I would love to return for maybe 2 nights and am saving up for just that, hopefully my sister will join me. To the management of the Westbury I wish to say I had a perfect stay; you have a staff to be proud of. Thank you, one and all.",5,2017,11,07
203,"Centrally located, lovely hotel","Attending a conference in Dublin, we scoured the options and came up with Westbury. We did not regret our choice 

It was centrally sited, just off Grafton Street which is part-pedestrian mall. Dublin is a very walkable city, nicely compact and pleasant to stroll in. We found the hotel to be a practical base to explore the city from. It was near the old quarter of the town, thus within minutes of Trinity College and St Stephen's Green. Restaurants were within easy reach, including the famous stretch that is Temple Bar. In fact, the grill at ground floor is renowned for good food.

We liked the rooms. Ours was a Studio Suite, though back-facing and on the 2nd floor, we did not experience any street noise. Furniture was pleasing to aesthetics -- neither too gaudy nor dark. 

Housekeeping ensured that our room was kept clean and smelt fresh daily. 

Wi-Fi was admirably fast and the speed, well maintained. Drops were few and these I presumed were due to the daily resetting of the main server. 

The lifts were quaintly furnished with sofas.

Would return.",4,2017,11,06
203,Majestic ,"What a grand hotel. Rooms were very well presented and very comfortable. The food was ample and of a very high quality. Maybe high priced, but I guess worth it for the experience. Good location close to all you would need in the way of shopping, eating and just walking around. ",5,2017,11,05
203,Nothing is cheap in Dublin but this was valuable!,"Have stayed here before three times and was never disappointed. Appreciate the details and very friendly and harmonic atmosphere which also seems to reflect on the guests. Nowhere seen so many smiles.

Breakfast was outstanding as a good selection of high quality food was offered.

It was another good experience- thanks!

203,Cocktails made to Perfection üç∏,"The Westbury is always my favourite place in Dublin for cocktails and relaxing! 
The atmosphere, service and staff throughout the hotel go above and beyond the competition! 
I particularly love the Sidecar bar with its 1930's theme, cost atmosphere and excellent staff üëåüèª",5,2017,11,03
203,Excellent,Great hotel and exceptional service from all the members of staff from entering the hotel to leaving we were made to feel extremely welcome and nothing was to much trouble. We will definitately stay here again!,5,2017,11,03
203,Posh place .... at a price,"Had a graduation celebration here mid-week. The meal and the service were excellent. We retired to the lounge area off the reception area on the first floor and enjoyed some nice cocktails. 
Overall, very impressive and stylish location. A real treat and perfect for that special occasion. ",5,2017,11,03
203,lovely long stay,Very accomodating staff. Great breakfast and bar. Bed was amazingly comfortable. Quiet except for street work in front. Windows have double sash though so noise not really much of an issue. But could still be heard. I was upcharged for a city facing room. So I got to pay extra for construction noise...ugh. I would say it isn't really a desirable view as streets are narrow and cannot see city wide anyway. Really enjoyed my stay.,5,2017,11,02
203,Best hotel in Dubs,"Elegant, from the moment you step inside with its grand sweeping staircase, to high ceilings ornately finished you feel you are in a special place. The staff glide around seeing to your every need in a polite, professional manner. Lovely cocktail bar offering a huge variety of beautifully executed drinks and lovey fresh nibbles. Rooms spacious and luxurious. Have stayed in other places in Dublin but this is so central for Grafton St and fine restaurants it us now our residence of choice when we visit.",5,2017,11,02
203,Overpriced.,"Good location, good service, pleasant and efficient staff, but when all is taken into consideration it is overpriced. It's getting to the point where paying guests are having difficulty in getting a seat in the lobby as a significant proportion are reserved for non paying guests who wish to ""swank"" it in the lobby of the Westbury.",4,2017,11,01
203,In the middle of everything,"The place is good for both, business and tourism. From the entrance you are welcomed by a very friendly doorman and soon you notice that everyone from hotel's staff is in the same manner: friendly and helpful. Check in was quick and smooth. The room was large and equipped with everything. WiFi signal was weak but stable. One area for improvement : the breakfast. The cost is not included in the room rate and you pay 25 EUR but the quality is not there: the food choices are poor, the omelette was terrible. Something has to be improved in this area, to have the almost perfect hotel in center of Dublin. Probably, the location is the biggest stronghold as you are close to almost everything interesting in the city.",5,2017,10,31
203,"Amazing service, very friendly staff.","Myself and my husband stayed at the westbury for a night in October. We were firstly welcomed by Derek the concierge who was so welcoming and helpful and parked our car. We checked into our room, on first impression the room appeared to be an older room which was a bit disapointing and the furniture appeared worn however the room had a very comfortable bed and beautiful crystal for beverages and the turn down service was a nice touch.
The bafle bar staff were so well trained, service was impeccable and it was a pleasure dealing with them. On check out we spoke to a very nice guy called Gareth, so helpful and gave us a nice send off. 
Overall our stay was a very pleasant experience and would like to return but I felt for the price of the room the appearance of the furniture and size of the room was slightly underwhelming. The service and the friendliness of the staff to help us with whatever we needed is what impressed us the most.",4,2017,10,29
203,Stay at the Westbury,We stayed at the Westbury for 3 days and loved every minute of it.  The staff are extremely helpful and very friendly.  Had drinks in the lobby which was amazing.  The rooms are clean and staff so friendly,5,2017,10,28
203,Dublin in style...,What a lovely experience to stay at the Westbury and enjoy their facilities......the outlets are simply gorgeous and service is of the highest level.....I can only recommend this stunning hotel for anyone wishing to enjoy the Dublin city center lifestyle....,5,2017,10,28
203,Great stay in Dublin,"Exactly what you expect of a 5* hotel.  The staff was great and the rooms and the common areas of the hotels were very clean.  The location was perfect for exploring the city.  They had good variety for dining/drinks.  Definitely a hotel I wouldn't mind spending a lot of time inside if I had been in Dublin longer.  I booked with a corporate rate so the value was top notch, but even if you pay the full rate I do not think you will be disappointed. ",5,2017,10,26
203,CITY BREAK,"Me my husband and 10year old daughter stayed at the westbury for 4nights. Our room was so spacious,we had a comfortable double four poster bed and a rollaway for our daughter.The room was cleaned to a high standard on a daily basis,turn down service daily tasty chocolates and complimentary bottle water daily.
The bar was so lovely and cowsy  the cocktails was so tasty and made to perfection.

We enjoyed afternoon tea at the gallery, simply delicious and outstanding service, special mention and big thank you to Tim,the gallery supervisor for your oustanding customer service and looking after us so well. Booking at weekends is highly recommended as it tends to get quite busy.

We had dinner at the wilde restaurant it was delicious,very fast and exceptional service.A++++
The Westbury is truly a 5star hotel located in a perfect position for touring the city,many shops and restaurants very close by.
From check in to check out everything was faultless, the staff are so polite and could'nt do enough for us. Thank you Nima at the reception for your oustanding service. This is our go to hotel when we are in Dublin.

BIG THANK YOU THE WESTBURY FOR MAKING OUR STAY SPECIAL.",5,2017,10,26
203,Afternoon tea.,"From first to last this was a brilliant afternoon tea. The place is lovely, the staff are great and we highly recommend the Westbury. Treat yourself. The little sandwiches were great and with fabulous scones and cakes to follow, we loved it.",5,2017,10,26
203,Home away from home,I went to this hotel recently to check out the dead rabbit cocktail event that was happening in the bar. The bar was a beautiful spot and the drinks were amazing! Adrian at the bar looked after me so well and made me feel very comfortable and at home. We also had a little bit of afternoon tea pre drinks in the afternoon in the Lobby where another great member Paula looked after as well... basically spoiled!!  Highly recommend.,5,2017,10,18
203,Westbury Hotel,"Great hotel, well located in Dublin, just off Grafton Street. Very pleasant and helpful staff, comfortable bed. The Marble Bar and adjacent lounge were top-class and the drinks were surprisingly reasonably priced. Didn't eat there and can't comment on the food. Our only quibble was the late servicing of our rooms, after 4pm both Saturday and Sunday. High class hotel, we would visit again with pleasure - probably worth 4.75 stars rather than 4!",4,2017,10,18
203,"Class and location, make the Westbury your best choice","My wife and son stopped into Dublin to celebrate Fathers day. Bucket list as an Irishman to drink Guinness with your university graduating son, on Fathers day in Dublin = done!

The Westbury has a certain class about everything in the experience. We had breakfast and afternoon tea during our 2 nites stay this past June 2017. 

I am not going to make it out as being perfect. It was bloody hot during our stay and with 30-degree celsius outside temps our first room AC did not stand to the challenge. 

What gives this hotel class is not that is shiny new but in how they manage a beautiful hotel with flaws. The desk manager was a true gentleman and exhibited outstanding world class customer service in how he handled the situation. We were given a new even nicer room with great AC without making our stay uncomfortable. I wish I could recommend him by name, he had a posh English accent, tall thin well dressed, ( saying this so management reading this)  gives him the praise he deserves. 

The location: I travel a lot globally. Location is always important for convenience and ease of stay. This hotels location is better than any other hotel downtown. It is a block away from main shopping street. It is near great restaurants and pubs, ( Hint, they are everywhere)

Perfect, no. Classy and made up for issues this older girl has, yes. Would I stay there again if travelling to Dublin, YES",5,2017,10,17
203,Top hotel in top location for Dublin ,"We stayed with family for 2 nights Saturday and Sunday. 
All hotel staff were friendly welcoming and helpful. 
Rooms were fantastic. Breakfast was excellent too. We ate out so can‚Äôt comment on the diners but the bar was packed on Saturday /Sunday evening with good spirits flowing.
Would highly recommend as right in the heart and never far from all the sights of Dublin.

203,"Still good, but . . .","We stayed at the Westbury about 3 years ago and I titled my review ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt be better.‚Äù  Sorry to say we did encounter some flaws this time around.  Hotel is still in a great location, breakfast and the lobby bar are great.  But one of our party had a plumbing issue that didn‚Äôt get fixed quickly and was not actually set right until the second attempt on a second day.  If she had not had access to other people‚Äôs rooms it would have been an even bigger issue.  We were disappointed since we had lauded the place to the whole group.",4,2017,10,16
203,Graduation Celebration,"I recently celebrated graduating college at the Westbury.  We had a fabulous table reserved by the fire which was just lovely.  The staff couldn't have been more attentive.  The personalised desert I received really was the cherry on the top and made my day even more special.  I would recommend the Westbury for any occasion, special or casual.  Every time I return to the Westbury I feel so content and relaxed, knowing that the wonderful staff can tend to your every need.  Thank you again so much.",5,2017,10,16
203,Restaurant Wild at the Westbury,"Totally charming environment with floor to ceiling windows, plants, linen, good acoustics, and excellent service. Though a fancy hotel business casual is fine in restaurant. Make a reservation. Salad of greens/squash/kale was seasonal and yummy. We both had Irish baby lambs chops. They were delicious. We split an entr√©e but chops are so petit it wouldn‚Äôt have been a problem to each have a full portion. The chops were served with extra spinach and no potatoes as we requested.  For dessert we shared an Irish Brie and an English Stilton goat, each excellent and portion size just right. The 20110 red Rioja reserve wine was a perfect match. ",5,2017,10,15
203,Will definitely return!,"Although we travel to Dublin often, for some reason had never stayed at the Westbury.  Checking in at 9:00am after the transatlantic red eye is typically something I dread.  The room is rarely available at that early hour and waiting for it to be ready is unpleasant to say the least.  The Westbury is different.  Since the hotel was sold out the previous night (not a surprise) we were treated to an amazing breakfast in Wildes.  The lobby is also the space where they serve afternoon tea, so there were multiple comfortable chairs and couches to relax on after our breakfast.  I even managed to get some work done since I felt somewhat refreshed after breakfast and coffee.  They accommodated our early check in request as best they could and once in the room, the bedding was luxurious and so, so comfortable.  Since the location can't be beat, we were able to shop and dine throughout the weekend without the need to take all that's needed for the day and were able to drop packages off as we went.  The bar, Wildes, draws a great crowd and everyone is so friendly!  Although I don't drink martinis it was great to watch the cart being wheeled around and specialty drinks mixed and shaken right at your table! Such a fun atmosphere!  Although we've stayed in all the best hotels all over Dublin, we'll definitely be returning to this one from now on!",5,2017,10,15
203,Staff arguing with each other ,"I met a colleague in The Westbury on 10/10/17. We were on the first floor and had 2 teas, 2 soups and 1 sandwich that came with a side order of fries, it cost ‚Ç¨45 which is expensive even for Dublin. While we were there the staff argued with each other, one lady in particular who seemed to be a supervisor was very aggressive with 2 of her co workers. At one point one member of staff (a lady from Turin ) was so upset that she began to cry. The attitude of the supervisor made us feel very uncomfortable.
There are much better 5 star hotels in Dublin. ",2,2017,10,13
203,Dan and Jess get married,"Superb service throughout for a very large and noisy group. Very attentive at all times and eager to assist. Bar service in Bafles excellent and doormen and night staff, excellent service. Check in friendly and checkout very attentive. Overall a great experience.",5,2017,10,13
203,‚ÄúWe would stay again!‚Äù,"There were 10 of us staying at the Westbury in Dublin and every one loved it. We all agreed that if we were to return we would stay there again. The location is excellent and the service was wonderful. All of our rooms were spacious and the beds very comfortable. The baths had plenty of room, the elevators were prompt and fast, and the continental breakfast in the lounge was lovely. The buffet in the restaurant was also excellent. It was a wonderful experience.",5,2017,10,12
203,Wonderful Afternoon Tea!,"I enjoyed a delicious afternoon tea in the beautiful surroundings of the Westbury hotel on Sunday, with my friend and her daughter. The staff and service was just fantastic and they made it such a special treat. The food was delicious, ham sandwich amazing, scones and cream fab and the favourite from the children's afternoon tea was the nutella hot chocolate!! Thank you Felicia and Ecaferina, we really enjoyed our visit and we will be back.",5,2017,10,11
203,Great hotel & great location.,"My husband and I stayed here as part of a work reward trip. The hotel staff were all very accommodating and very helpful in providing maps & directions and suggestions for attractions to visit and bar / restaurants. Everyone there went above and beyond and the service was amazing. No request was turned down or too much. 

The location is great and close to shops, restaurants and major attractions. 

While the hotel is grand and very clean / elegant, it could use with some updates to the furniture. It doesn't take away from how great this place is though.",5,2017,10,11
203,An oasis of calm in the centre of the city,"From the moment we entered the doors of the hotel , we were made to feel special and so welcome like we were visiting friends, the hotel lobby is infused with a luxurious scent that has the most calming effect on even the most stressed traveller , it's not just a hotel it's total experience .
The extensive breakfast is a reason to check in alone , and although the hotel was very busy the staff seemed to float about with perfect  efficiency .
The side car bar is like being transported straight to Manhattan , with an array of cocktails , should you choose one.",5,2017,10,10
203,Great service,"My stay at the Westbury hotel throughout my time in Dublin was wonderful. The highlight of my stay is the high standards of staff service at the hotel. The hotel itself was great as well with spacious and comfortable rooms, and also located conveniently near Grafton street.",5,2017,10,10
203,Grand Hotel !!,The hotel was amazing.. Great location to many attractions. It truly is a 5 star hotel with luxury amenities . The two bars were always well attended and hopping every night. The high tea was one of the best I've had in Europe. The restaurant offered a buffet or order from menu. The bedroom very clean and comfortable .,5,2017,10,09
203,Wonderful stay and location,"Arrival was streamlined from easy arrival in a taxi, through concierge greeting to the welcoming staff on reception.
The reservation was correct and i was addressed by name all the way through.
The lift is elegant wood and brass with a leather ""sofa"" in it and the bed room was easy to find.
The bedroom had plenty of amenities and we had a room at the back which is the quieter side of the hotel, however all the rooms have double glazing to ensure no noise gets in as it is after, all a city centre hotel. It is such a city centre hotel that is right in the middle of most places in Dublin that you would want to walk to.
The bed was so comfy it was a dream.
I stay in a lot of hotels but i must say that the staff in all departments of the hotel were the most smart polite and friendly I have encountered for a long time.",5,2017,10,09
203,High standards!!! ,"When we arrived reception staff were welcoming and booked us in promptly. We were met with a smart well maintained hotel dressed with beautiful flowers and the cleanliness was up to a high standard. 
We were given our cards and headed up to our rooms, cases arrived approximately over an hour later. Do improvement required there. 
The room we had was clean, couldn‚Äôt fault it, mini bar, tv, iron, ironing board, tea and coffee facilities, slippers, dressing gown and hair dryer , they have thought of everything, even  down to an umbrella, too much to list. 
Air condition is available in the rooms. 
Bed was comfortable, we had the kindsize room . 
Bathroom is clean, shower/bath, all condiments that would be needed are displayed lovely in the bathroom. Only downfall is the shower, not much pressure and not very hot. 
Considering the hotel is in the middle of Dublin town the room remained quiet
House keeping visit twice a day, in the morning and in the evening if your out they lay out your slippers, water and a glass by the side of your bed, bed covers pulled back and a chocolate o either side. 
Noting is too much and go above and beyond. 

Everything is on your doorstep, restaurants, bars and shopping galore .
I cannot fault  this hotel , very attentive and very clean. Standards are high.

203,Great Hotel in a Great Location,The Westbury is a nice hotel with a touch of modern and old world-style in a great location.  All the main attractions are within walking distance and there are plenty of cabs otherwise.  The bar and restaurant are lovely and the staff is friendly and helpful.  Excellent full breakfast daily.  The rooms are a nice size and the beds are very comfortable.  I'd stay there again!,4,2017,10,08
203,Heart of Dublin,Great hotel in the heart of Dublin.  The rooms are superb and the everyone was so attentive to our needs.  Little pricey but hey you get what you pay for and I loved it. The afternoon tea is amazing and I would stay here again.,5,2017,10,08
203,No car needed!,"My husband and I stayed at The Westbury in September. Its a great hotel in a fantastic location where all the action is. So many attractions in walking distance and if you need to go further afield there are plenty of cabs. Walk out the front door of the hotel and all you have to choose is which pub or restaurant you would like to dine at. Grafton Street nearby is great for shopping. The hotel bar is the place to relax and has great atmosphere. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The restaurant Wilde has a cold breakfast buffet and the hot breakfast is cooked to order both are good. We had dinner at Wilde on our last night the chargrilled spatchcock was so tender, so good. The room was nice and the bed very comfortable. We will stay at the Westbury Hotel again when we return to Dublin.",4,2017,10,08
203,Old dame of Dublin,"Felt it was a bit of an 80's throw back, staff very professional and friendly, rooms tired but bed super comfy. Gym a disgrace for a 5 star hotel, and although they offered a discount to use another gym .... please .... this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel . Afternoon tea ‚Ç¨47 with no champagne.. pricy ... there is definitely better in Dublin",3,2017,10,07
203,Excellent hotel in great location.,"Very nice, well-decorated and maintained; front desk staff was not very friendly. Excellent full breakfast daily. Good-size rooms, although carpet in room was badly stained and should have been replaced or cleaned. Would return to this hotel.",5,2017,10,07
203,Favourite Spot,"Myself and my (now) fianc√© choose the Westbury time and time again to celebrate special occasions - our birthdays, our Christmas night out etc.

We got engaged a few weeks ago and my boyfriend called the hotel with a few requests for the evening about dinner, reserving a window seat for drinks etc. All of his requests were honored and we had the most magical night. We always find the service to be impeccable but particularly on this occasion when numerous staff took time to come over to us to wish us congratulations and a celebratory cake was presented to us after dinner. 

We will continue to choose The Westbury to celebrate life's milestones but it is an even more special place for us now.",5,2017,10,06
203,Good BUT...,"This hotel is ideally situated in The Temple Bar area. We liked the lobby, hotel restaurants, and awesome staff...in particular one of the managers, Jack, the wait staff at their Gastro pub, and the housekeeping team...all bending over backwards to make our stay as good as it could be. The only serious issues that were out of the staff's control are the following. Some of the rooms are renovated, others desperately need to be. We started off with the former (unexceptable for the price) and switched to the latter (which was very nice). Lastly there was an event in the enclosed lobby bar that was filled by many non-hotel guests that displaced the hotel guests. This is a main area which is advertised on their website and I would think paying hotel guests should safely assume they would have access to such an integral part of the hotel. Overall good hotel with considerations of the latter cautions.",4,2017,10,05
203,Such restful break for Scones & Tea,"This lovely hotel beckoned us as we headed out to the airport. We stopped off at the Westbury for a cup of tea and scones as a last foray in Dublin before travelling home. Our first encounter was with a delightful doorman who was so helpful, carrying our bags up to the lounge for our break. 
Sitting in this beautiful, peaceful, well furnished environment was an absolute joy. The tea arrived promptly along with an 'americano' coffee which, disappointingly only filled half the cup and, when queried, removed was returned as before with the remark that this is how much coffee is served. This felt unnecessary. The scones were light, fluffy and delicious, obviously a talented chef prepared them. With just two pots of cream between the three servings it was a little thinner than expected though the serving of jam was more generous.
This was so nearly fabulous and with a little more care, it could so easily be so.
There is no doubt the strength of this hotel is the staff as the ones we encountered were polite, helpful, humerous and professional.",4,2017,10,05
203,very nice,Okay so the scones at breakfast may have been the best I have ever had. As for the hotel its just as nice and wonderful as you would expect it to be. The staff is very helpful they really go out of their way for you. I do not think I can ever stay anywhere else in Dublin.,5,2017,10,05
203,Excellent hotel in a great location,"This hotel is ideally located for exploring Dublin.  It's also very charming, with a great staff and excellent amenities.  Even though it's right in the middle of a busy part of town, the rooms are very quiet.  

Our room was large, and the bathroom had lots of space for toiletries for two people.  Getting in and out of the shower is a bit dodgy - might benefit from a bathmat.  

The breakfast is great.  The lobby bar is also very nice and was just what we needed after one busy day.  Note that on Saturday afternoon there is a busy tea service so you may not be able to get in.

The only issue we experienced was with the hotel WiFi, which was erratic in our room.  We were able to work around it but it would be nice if the hotel invested in making this more reliable.",5,2017,10,05
203,Absolutely Lovely,"We had spent a week of B&B's in western Ireland, which were lovely, but to arrive in Dublin and finally drop off a car after a week of sometimes stressful driving and sometimes not-so-nice weather in and around western Ireland and find yourself in this absolutely beautiful, gracious service-forward , centrally located Dublin gem was heaven. There are so many really great places to eat and shop and tour minutes away. We loved it. ",5,2017,10,04
203,It Does Not Get Much Better Than The Westbury ,"We arrived today from Paris and already from the greeting at the front door as we paid our taxi to the bags removed and carted to our rooms to the incredible welcome from Mohamed who was in Training to the rooms, to the lobby area this place if off the charts. Leading Hotels of The World is exactly that!",5,2017,10,04
203,Great Place to center your walking experience of Dublin.,"It was our Honeymoon and hands down a Five Star adventure. The staff knew their ""stuff""and we had two great dining experiences from their personnel favorites list. The Hotel's own restaurants, were excellent.",5,2017,10,03
203,Over 60?  This review is for you!,"I love breakfast and the Irish breakfast at the Westbury was fabulous!  We were there for four breakfasts a few weeks ago and I am still reminiscing about the kippers.  Sleeping at the Westbury was perfect.  The bed and pillows were luxurious, the room's temperature was constant, and it was quiet.  Having a glass of fine port next to a cozy fire in the Westbury's bar made for a nice ending to a day of touring.  My only concern for others who might have our room is the different levels within our suite.  There was an immediate step as you opened the door and three steps up to the bathroom.  If the bathroom was to be used during the night you would need to be very careful not to trip due to the lack of a night light or a lamp within easy access to the bed. The shower and very narrow tub were one and the same, so that would be a problem for one who might have had knee or hip replacement.  I would suggest packing a flashlight for many charming European hotels.  Still, the Westbury was a fond memory and hopefully we'll be back.",5,2017,10,02
203,5 Star Hotel very close to Grafton Street,The Westbury is a 5 star hotel that is conviently located off Grafton Street and within easy walking distance from Dublin city sites. The afternoon tea is a must. The staff is very accomadating and customer oriented.,5,2017,10,02
203,Tired and worn furniture,"Expected more from a five star hotel; although the bed was super comfortable and the room was very clean, the furniture unfortunately had definitely seen better days. Also could not figure out the many light switches that seem to control certain lights, but only if other switches were also engaged????? The sorest point was that the hotel charged us almost 100 euro after checkout, invoice via email...after 24 hrs waiting for a reply/explanation, we had to go back to the hotel to speak with the front desk. Although we had not made use of the mini fridge, we used it to keep some olives & cheese cold and they explained that every time we jiggled something inside this fridge, it registered a charge...not sure if we had returned, would the request for an explanation ever be answered. The charges were cleared in the end but it was really an unnecessary incident.",3,2017,10,02
203,Great Place - Easy to Get To,"When you check in early at The Westbury, they'll invite you to have tea in the restaurant area that adjoins the lobby - excellent way to wind down from the travel and get into the Irish spirit of things. Be sure to enjoy the full breakfast in another of the Westbury restaurants. Dinner was just as wonderful - Doer Sole Meuniere - as fresh as if you were on the docks.",5,2017,10,02
203,Luxury at it's best,"One of the nicest and luxurious hotels in Dublin. Every employee of this fine hotel was as professional as the next. They made sure every wish was granted. This is a must stay when in Dublin and lastly, the food is excellent as well.",5,2017,10,01
203,"Lovely Hotel, Lovely Stay","The Westbury was selected for us by our travel agent. Since we had been so disappointed by the agent's other Ireland hotel selections, we had low expectations when we arrived at the Westbury. WOW: Were we ever pleasantly surprised! The doormen were warm, welcoming, and so helpful. The lobby is gorgeous and the front desk staff exceptional. Although the first room we were assigned did not suit us, we were promptly moved to another room, which was absolutely perfect. The room was on the small side, but very well designed and extremely comfortable, and the bathroom was beautiful. Cocktails in the lounge were inventive and the breakfast (included) was the best we had in Ireland. The hotel's location can't be beat...in walking distance of shopping, St Stephen's Green, and Temple Bar. Despite the central location, our room was absolutely quiet and we had a great night's sleep. Thank you, Westbury!",5,2017,09,30
203,Business Lunch,"Ate here in September - had the express business lunch.

Absolutely superb.
Food served promptly.
Presentation first class - food was appealling to the eye. 
Mix of flavours and seasoning was perfect. 
Portion size was just right - enough to satisfy without creating an after lunch slump.

All courses served on one plate, so diners were not delayed waiting for one course to be cleared and the next to be served - ideal for those on a tight schedule who still want to eat real food that tastes superb.

Every bit the five star lunch.",5,2017,09,30
203,Very efficient and very friendly and helpful staff,I stayed recently at The Westbury. The check-in was already a very nice and pleasant experience as the receptionist was very welcoming and helpful. I was also supposed to meet a colleague in the bar and by accident went to the wrong place and ordered my drink. When I found out the drinks were without any problem brought to the other place which was downstairs and a very friendly person escorted us to the place. throughout my stay the staff was very friendly and did their best to help and make us feeling special. Definitely a nice and pleasant experience. ,5,2017,09,29
203,"Tea at the westbury, just fantastic!","We took our five year old daughter for tea for her birthday. The service was amazingly Ng, the staff totally attentive at all times, nothing was a problem, and we're all vegetarians. They had a super selection of sandwiches for veggies, the scones great and the chocolates based on hat designs, stunning.

Theybutterly spoiled our little girl, it looks expensive but it's actually Greta value.",5,2017,09,28
203,"Great location, fabulous staff and enjoyable comfort","The Westbury has a prime location with fabulous professional staff.  We had a very enjoyable, comfortable stay and I would have no bother recommending a stay in this hotel to my friends and family.  We will be back.",5,2017,09,28
203,High tea was amazing - guest rooms not as much,"We stayed here for one night and heard great things and had high expectations.  The high tea was lovely - and the best scone I've ever had in my life!  Loved the tea experience. 

The guest rooms on the other hand were not worth the $$.  The carpet in the room was stained, the footer sheet on the bed was stained - the bathroom was outdated and the faucet didn't sit over the sink, so there was water all over the place.  I was not impressed - at all.",3,2017,09,27
203,"Lovely hotel, great staff","I stayed in this hotel as we were holding a business meeting. I have to say that the location was great, the hotel is very clean and top class. I did think that the room price was high and if I was paying I probably wouldn't have paid it. However, I can't fault the service of the staff. They were very attentive for our meeting. I ordered room service and the food quality was very good and it was delivered when they said it would be.  The room was very quiet despite being in the middle of the city ",5,2017,09,27
203,Location!,"Cannot beat the great location of The Westbury. We walked everywhere. There are so many great choices for tours, pubs, restaurants, music, and so much more. The hotel itself was wonderful with great staff, nice rooms (not over-the-the-top but nice), and terrific breakfast. We would definitely return for another stay.",5,2017,09,26
203,Perfect Dublin Location,"This is a beautiful hotel with amazing decor throughout.  The dining room was fabulous and the bar was very cozy. The service was exemplary.  We were constantly asked if we had everything we needed and if we needed anything to please let the know.  The location is perfect, walk out the door and you have shopping, pubs and dining, right at your doorsteps.  Would certainly stay there again if we ever return.",5,2017,09,26
203,Afternoon tea ,"My daughter treated me to afternoon tea here on Sunday and what a beautiful experience it was , the staff were friendly and couldn't go enough to make us feel so relaxed and comfortable the tea and accompanying sandwiches and pastries were delicious , will definitely be back again . We decided to pop into the sidecar bar afterwards for a couple of drinks and again service was excellent and friendly and would highly recommend it ",5,2017,09,26
203,Back again,"Last year I was disappointed after a wonderful stay the year before. This year they exceeded our expectations. Thought we would give it another shot and are glad we did. Staff was wonderful, room kept clean during our stay. Held bags for us while we left Dublin for three days before returning. Will be back next year!",5,2017,09,25
203,Great Stay!,"The hotel is beautiful and in a perfect location, we could walk to everything.  Our room was very large and luxurious.  They were able to get us in to Balfes without a reservation and the food was the best we had during our trip to Ireland!  We have already recommended this hotel to friends planning a trip to Dublin and will stay here when we return!",5,2017,09,25
203,Dublin treasure,I have always wanted to stay at the Westbury as I had many business meetings here over the years. The experience was everything I had imagined and more. A must visit when in Dublin. A very romantic setting with exceptional service and attention to detail. Late night Kir Royals a must. ,5,2017,09,25
203,Great location and wonderful staff,"The real attraction of the Westbury is its location.  Close to Grafton street and easy walking to great restaurants and pubs.  Also close to many of the sights such as Trinity College.  As others have written, the rooms are not outstanding; for the price it was disappointing to see nicked up furniture, cabinet doors that wouldn't shut, dirty carpet, etc.  Our room was in the back and street noise at all hours was disconcerting.  But all in all we enjoyed it and were very impressed with the staff, (shout out to John, who helped us navigate the Irish rail website) who were all very friendly and helpful.",4,2017,09,24
203,Fantastic in Every Way,"Caught betwixt the flow of people and pubs and literary landmarks and finance instruments and the generous spirit that embodies the wonderful Irish folk and all those that come to the Emerald Isle, there stands The Westbury, singular at the top amongst its piers for every reason.",5,2017,09,23
203,Small lapses inconsistent with a Leading Hotel of the World,The Westbury is very conveniently located in the midst of Dublin's active dining/shopping/historic district.  It looks impressive with a grand entrance to the lobby and elegant decor. But on a recent business stay I experienced lapses in service. I arrived before the check in time of 3 PM and waited for the call that my room was ready. The call never came and at 3:15 I had to go back to the desk.  I was surprised on the first morning that breakfast was not included in my over 300 Euros room rate.  I can't remember the last time a hotel in Europe did not include breakfast.  For 15 Euros I ordered the continental breakfast and toast which never came before I had to leave for my business meeting.  When I tried to use their business center to print my airline boarding pass I was told that it was closed for refurbishment.  My room had taps on the sink that dripped and a poorly flushing toilet.  A single lapse is understandable but this pattern needs management attention.,3,2017,09,22
203,Luxury in Dublin,"It's expensive, but you get what you pay for. Our room was very comfortable and very well appointed. Everything you would expect from a luxury hotel is provided, and in addition, it is very quiet despite being located in the middle of the busy Grafton Street pub, restaurant and shopping area.

Thomas, the concierge, is terrific and he really helped to ensure that our three-night stay was perfect. He helped us with our bags, arranged dinner reservations, booked transportation, and gave us suggestions on what to see and do, plus walking directions to get there. 

Breakfast is included and is served in the hotel's dining room. Menu choices and service are excellent.",5,2017,09,20
203,Gracious Staff,"We arrived in the early evening by car and discovered that due to construction that there was no place to park our car.  The manager apologized for the inconvenience (parking was secured at a pay lot - the hotel had vouchers to rebate half the price to a reasonable 12 euros for overnight parking) and while my husband and brother-in-law were parking the car, my sister-in-law and I were ushered to the lovely bar for complimentary drinks.  The manager chatted with us about the art in the hotel and what could have been a bad start to our four day stay was turned around with courtesy and helpfulness.  This was a consistent theme throughout our stay - the staff was very well trained and helpful - with recommendations for restaurants and tours.  Lucas was helping us sort out tickets for the Hop On/Off Bus (a convenient way to get around to major points of interest) and insisted we tour the Prison and arranged tickets for us on the spot.  He was correct - the tour was one of the highlights of our time in Dublin.

  The rooms were very comfortable and elegantly decorated.  The hotel is steps away from Grafton street and it is an easy walk to many sights and restaurants and shops. We ate two meals at Balfies, the more casual restaurant on the hotel's ground floor and thoroughly enjoyed them.  Breakfast was included with our stay, and the breakfast room is charming and the service was attentive.  They have a nice assortment of cold items (breads and pastries, cereal, fruit, yogurt, juices)  on the buffet and a few hot items available to order.  
I would definitely come back to the Westbury if I return to Dublin.  This was a perfect way to end our two week visit to Ireland.",5,2017,09,20
203,"Best hotel in Dublin - clean rooms, great service, centrally located","This was our first time in Dublin and we picked the Westbury based on Tripadvisor reviews and its location. We arrived early at 7:30 am, tired and jetlagged. Kevin greeted us at the door and quickly helped us with the luggage. Rory helped us check-in. He could not have been more welcoming and accommodating. He quickly found us one (out of 2) room that would be available. He also ensured that
our breakfast would be covered the morning we arrived as we would not be able to take advantage of it the following day (due to an early morning tour).

The hotel is centrally located. The room is very well appointed. Breakfast was excellent. The service from the entire staff - doorman, front desk, concierge, housekeeping and restaurant, is impeccable. We would not hesitate to stay again next time we're in Dublin.",5,2017,09,19
203,"Beautiful hotel, bad service","This hotel is beautiful. The building, surroundings, and price (!) are certainly 5 star. But the service is not. I can't be bothered to go into it in detail, but I'd booked the hotel as a treat for my mum's 60th, and the attitude and ineptitude of the front of house staff threatened to ruin it. They seriously need to either fire a lot of their staff and start again, or get someone in to train them in actual 5 star service. Oh and don't expect your room to be ready when you get there - we arrived at 6pm and were told we'd have to wait. Not offered to sit in the bar with a drink and wait - just to wait. There were loads of other issues but I'll just say - if you'd like 5 star service, go elsewhere.",3,2017,09,18
203,Location Location Location ,"The Westbury hotel is located arguably within walking distance to just about everything within Dublin. This was one of the reasons as to why we chose to stay here. 
The rooms are of a good size allowing you to move around. However with bed being so close to the room's door, you do get hear a lot of noise coming from the corridor. 
The staff here are very friendly and helpful when asking them about places to go to. ",5,2017,09,18
203,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed for 2 nights at this lovely hotel.  Beautiful room, furniture and linens. Great location for walking to just about anything in Dublin!  Was very disappointed that a full Irish breakfast did not come with the room as most accommodations in Ireland do offer this amenity.  ",4,2017,09,17
203,Did not meet expectations,"I booked a luxury studio suite for my first 2 nights in Ireland as a treat for myself.  I arrived on a Friday at approximately 2:30 pm and was told my room was not ready yet and that they would call me when it was ready.  I was assured  that my luggage would be taken to the room for me.  I did a bit of walking around and by 4 pm I did not receive a call yet so I returned to the hotel to check on the room.  I was told that the room was ready and was given the key.  When I arrived at the room my bag was not there and after waiting a good 15 minutes I called down to front desk to request it.  The bag finally arrived another 15 minutes after that.  

First impression of the room was that it was spacious but it had a very strong odor of unpleasant deodorizer.  I mentioned this to the porter when he brought my bag up and he agreed that it was stronger than usual.  It was not a fresh smell but more like they were trying to cover something up.  I asked if the room was a smoking room and his response was ""we are a nonsmoking hotel but cannot control if people smoke"".  I was tired and jetlagged and decided not to press the matter.  I considered ordering room service instead of going out for dinner but sadly the ""room service"" menu left in the room did not contain an actual menu.  It was empty.  I called down to front desk and requested a menu.  I was told it would be brought up however it never was.  I decided to go out to dinner and skip the room service at this point.  I cannot comment on room service because I never used it.  I was in bed fairly early the first night because I arrived that day from an international flight.  I wanted to watch some mindless TV to help fall asleep but the TV remote would not work unless you stood directly in front of the TV and pressed the buttons several times.  It was useless.

On my second night I returned to the hotel at approximately 10 pm after an evening out and while trying to scan my room card to summon the lift I noticed what appeared to be a security man in a black suit eyeing me suspiciously.  Note - there is a set of elevators that require you to insert your room key in order to get the elevator.  This was not working for me.  Perhaps I looked suspicious to him.  After a couple of attempts I had to go around to the other set of lifts.  By the time I got up to the 6th floor and was walking to my room, I heard someone coming up from behind me.  Rather than open my door right as this person was behind me, I waited a moment for him to pass.  It was the older guy in the suit that I saw on the first floor.  It was very strange and I am left to ponder his motives.  I did not feel safe.  I got into the room and locked the door behind me.  

I paid a premium price for this ""luxury suite"" for two nights and feel extremely disappointed.  The service and room was not 5 star.  My subsequent nights in Ireland were at lesser star hotels but the service and genuine warmth I received from those hotels were far superior (and easier on my wallet) than the Westbury.  I really dislike having to leave a poor review but I just was not pleased with this hotel.",3,2017,09,16
203,Comfortable and Affordable,"Stayed at The Westbury because an other recommended hotel was not available. As it turns out, The Westbury surpasses all amenities and aesthetics as the other. We stayed at the other hotel on the return trip, which confirmed that The Westbury was far more comfortable, has a better breakfast food and venue, better beds, better view, less expensive, better location. Pretty much all around better.",5,2017,09,16
203,Cozy!,"One night at the Westbury was a real treat.  Well located if you want to shop, friendly staff but most importantly, the most comfortable bed ever.  Hard to get up in the morning when you are so cozy!   My only problem was figuring out how to use the coffee machine but that was solved quickly by a helpful staff member!",5,2017,09,16
203,nice hotel ,"very nice hotel. staff are lovely.
rooms are clean and modern. great location, next to all shops and amenities. lots of bars and restaurants to chose from and next to Stephens green which is great for a family stroll. 
look forward to returning soon!",4,2017,09,15
203,Great stay for 5 nights!,"My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights.  Its a perfectly located hotel right in the centre of everything on Grafton Street, though we did find it a bit pricey, we were quite happy with our stay. We walked to everything from St. Patricks Cathedral, to Trinity College, to the Art Galley, to the pick up points for the day tours, just everything is reachable within minutes. The reception staff, the concierge, the housekeeping, the restaurant staff are absolutely amazing. A special mention to Eddie from the bell desk, and Lucas from the concierge, so so helpful. I would stay here for sure again. Good clean rooms, only issue is the flush though.You have to really work 3-4 times on it to flush properly. besides that we don't see any issues with the hotel. The hotel is surrounded by loads of restaurants and bars and is a very lively place to stay in.Its located on Grafton Street which is also one of the shopping areas. We were here for a conference and even had dinner one night at one of their banquet halls and the food was super! would recommend this to anyone on business or holiday. The hotel even helps you out on the day tours etc.",5,2017,09,14
203,"Elegant, comfortable and classy.",What a wonderful hotel.  The manager was so warm and attentive that we felt like we had known him a long time.  Everyone really cared about us and our comfort.  It never felt programmed in any way.  The lounge is so comfortable and the service everywhere in the hotel was perfect!,5,2017,09,13
203,Don't Stay Here.,"After reading a lot of reviews here, we decided to book this hotel, and I'm sorry we did.  I'm giving this hotel the award for one of the worst hotels ever and here are all the reasons: We were driven the two hours from Belfast to Dublin by a local driver. He starts unloading our luggage even though no one came outside (bellhop, doorman, etc.). We find out that isn't the door for checking in, it's around the corner. Note to Hotel: post a sign outside! - We tell the front desk we're checking in (it's a little after 2pm) he tells us our ""guarantee time of check in is 3pm."" OK, we say, we'll leave our luggage and come back. Fast forward more than an hour, we stopped again around 3.30pm at the desk. You know where this is going: our room isn't yet ready. Seems since we booked a suite, and there are just a few, it's not ready. We laugh because the same guy made such a stink to us at 2pm that our ""guarantee time is 3pm."" The front of the house manager buys us a drink while we sit and wait (it was raining sideways so going outside wasn't exactly an option at that time). - Our room, ""the suite"" number 233, was just ok and here's why: the bathroom is solely made for just one person and a really small person at that. The faucet is positioned so far back from the sink that we had to put a wash cloth under the faucet so it won't splash and wet the entire counter. The flusher had to be jiggled a few times in order to flush just once. - This hotel advertises a gym. This hotel does not in fact have a gym! It has the tiniest of a room, with a huge useless pillar in the middle, and three machines that, of course, are thisclose. There is a huge 7-foot by 4-foot sign (yes, in that tiny room) advertising the gym across the street for a fee.  For a fee! The hotel claims to have a gym, then tells you to pay extra across the street. - We had to ask concierge on three separate occasions to re-confirm the car to the airport which we booked online when we made the original hotel res. No one called us back, or knew of anything when we went to the desk.  Mind you, we are holding the print out confirmation. - Anyway, another hassle: we go for breakfast and it's a tight squeeze, not necessarily a small space per se, but things are too on top of each other. We sit down and ask for coffee.  More than ten minutes later I get up, walk over to a few staff chatting with each and ask why I can't have coffee.  I actually followed her and did get the coffee. I kid you not, I did that two days in a row. The staff was always busy but doing what i don't know. - The location of the hotel is good because there are lots of restaurants, bars and shopping right there. The location of the hotel is also awful because the bars are right there. You can hear drunken revelers all night long. - One morning we came out of our room around 7am and the hallway was already filled with the vacuum cleaners and huge towel holding vats that they'll use to clean the rooms. Yes, I'm aware that the rooms have to be cleaned, I'm just not sure why the entire corridor has to be an eyesore the entire day long. - The elevator has a bench for sitting.  Nice touch, right? No, it's not. They didn't bother to take away the bar which is exactly where your head lands when you sit down. Note to Management: pick the bench or the bar but stop having people bash their head when they sit down. - I would never endorse this hotel and I'm sorry that I stayed. And, yes, while there I did tell them a lot of this.",2,2017,09,13
203,Great stay for 4 nights in Dublin,"My family of four recently stayed at the Westbury for 4 nights several weeks ago. Great service, great location, wonderful food. Agree with previous reviews that the hotel feels very luxurious and the service extremely warm and friendly. We would gladly stay there again.",5,2017,09,11
203,Great Stay at The Westbury,"Wonderful hotel: great location in central Dublin, high quality amenities, friendly helpful staff.  Room was very comfortable and very clean.  Very attractive bar/lounge area, much enjoyed late night drinks there.",5,2017,09,11
203,Lovely hotel in a great location,"From the minute we arrived, we were greeted by terrific staff, very friendly and always helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our accommodations, restaurants, and most importantly, the perfect location. Given the tempestuous Irish weather, I appreciated the proximity to everything, so I could duck in and out of the hotel while still enjoying the neighborhood.",5,2017,09,11
203,"Great Location, Highly Recommended","The best feature of this hotel is the location. It sits right in the middle of the city centre, you are comfortable walking distance to all the popular Dublin pubs, restaurants, and tourist attractions. If you have a car, they will valet it for you, another subtle but very important feature, since parking is very difficult to find, let alone driving through the very tight streets looking for any available spaces. As for the hotel, the staff is very nice and helpful. They provided a map and pointed out all points of interest, provided complimentary bottles of water on check out. Checking in/out was very quick, easy, and efficient. The rooms was clean, cozy, and the bed was very comfortable. If you're planning a trip to Dublin, The Westbury is an easy recommendation.",5,2017,09,10
203,Great location -- superb staff,"This was the first stop on a tour of Ireland. My sister and I arrived at around 7:30 am knowing that our room wouldn't be ready. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, trying to locate a room that might already have been cleaned and ready. They directed us to the restaurant where there is a breakfast buffet with a very nice selection of foods as well as a menu for full breakfasts. Eggs Benedict is awesome!  While we enjoyed breakfast, they came to let us know we could have our room as soon as we wanted. The room was beautiful with a king sized bed, while we needed a room with twin beds. Going back to the front desk, they could not have been more accommodating, especially Mary who was in training at the time our tour group was there -- getting us a twin room within within a very reasonable period of time.

The location of this hotel is wonderful -- allowing easy walking access to so many of the top spots to see in Dublin. I would definitely stay there again.",5,2017,09,08
203,Luxury ,"Lovely hotel, an icon of Dublin, theres a very luxurious feel to the place with classic furniture, decor and the rooms are lovely. It must have recently been redecorated as all a very high standard. Room even has a full size bath, fully stocked minibar and free bottled water - amazing how many hotels lack this.  Staff very friendly, brilliant location, good Guinness in Balfes the bar. My new fav hotel in Dublin fair city ",5,2017,09,07
203,DISAPPOINTING,"Stayed here after a recommendation from a friend.  Upon arrival were greeted by fantastic doormen who couldn't do enough to make us smile, then by warm and welcoming reception staff.  

However, things changed a little when we started to explore the hotel, it was very disappointing that one couldn't just sit and enjoy the lobby or take a drink in the lobby as the tiny bar they had was almost full. The lobby has been used purely for afternoon teas.  We asked if it was possible to have an afternoon tea but no they were fully booked for that so as a hotel guest it was a little disappointing that we were not prioritised for being hotel guests to enjoy the premises.  

The room we were given was pleasant and spacious, however the bathroom had black / mould along the sealant around the tub, and the bedspread was stained.  We asked house keeping to change the bed spread and they did.  We had a further issue with the room which we discussed with management and the female manager Emear, we spoke to was very helpful and moved us to another room which was very nice and no further issues, except for the sarcasm of the male manager when I check out about the problem we had, which took me back a bit. 

The bed and the pillows are among the most comfortable hotel beds I have slept in, and whilst the breakfast buffet is disappointing, very limited and not much choice, I will say though the Eggs Benedict from the a la Carte menu was probably the best Eggs Benedict I ever had. 

I would probably return here, but think that the hotel needs to review some of it's practices particularly around the afternoon teas, maybe have an area set aside for hotel guests.  Given the price it is to stay here, it is a bit of a cheek to exclude guests from hotel facilities.",3,2017,09,07
203,Arrogant and rude,"I recently stayed at The Westbury. Upon arrival i used the toilets and found them dirty. I passed this onto the receptionist. I left my wife to check in and asked for a table were I could conduct several business meetings. I had 4 different meetings planned. During the third a lady approached me and told me to move. I explained I was a hotel guest and was at the table I was shown to. Apparently that did not seem to matter. I said I would be a further 30mins. She came back 20 minutes later saying we really had to move as they were setting up for afternoon teas. I was now in the middle my fourth meeting. I had never been treated like this and certainly had never known a hotel to put afternoon tea before residents. This hotel cannot be seriously considered if you are looking to conduct business. To round matters off I was given a burnt breakfast the next morning. It is a few years since I previously stayed here. What has happened to this once great hotel?  It is now a tired and pale reflection of its former self. I made my feelings clear when I was checking out. A manager offered me a complimentary ""afternoon tea"". I refused thinking this was adding ""insult to injury"" given afternoon tea caused the problems. 
To be embarassed in front of existing and potential business associates is wholly unacceptable. Very poor management.",2,2017,09,06
203,Old fashioned service excellence in the heart of Dublin,"I am a regular at the Westbury, largely for business, but it has always been a fantastic experience.  There have been times when things have gone wrong, cold water for a shower for example, but what always keeps me happy is the staff's willingness to sort the issue out and go the extra mile.

The service is simply magnificent and the ambience and style of the hotel is old fashioned, but warm, cosy and so welcoming.

It's location has to be amongst the best in Dublin, right in the heart of the city, off Grafton Street and near the beautiful St. Stephens Green.  It isn't that far from anywhere in the city and you can be in the thriving shopping district or the scenic green within 2 minutes.",5,2017,09,06
203,Unpleasant stay ,"Stayed at the Westbury Sept.1-3  2017 and was very disappointed  with the room and service.  Here's why:  1) my room was directly across the elevator - asked to switch rooms but was told nothing was available except a suite which would cost over 150 Euro more so declined.  All night long I had to listen to people talking in the hall. They sent a ""trainee"" to deal with the problem who had no authority to do anything. 2) it took 3 flushes for the toilet to clear.  The trainee said the tank takes 15 minutes to fill!  Seriously? Not good - minus one star!  
3). Tried to turn on the TV and it would not work.  I called the front desk and they said someone would come ""straight away"". No one came.  The ""turn down"" attendant came so she tried too. No success so she took the remote control and said she would take care of it but really that was not her job.  Minus one more star.  4) took a shower and washed my hair.  Looked for a hair dryer - no hair dryer!  Once again had to call the front desk to get one.  Minus one more star.  5) on my second day there I left on a tour from 9:00am and returned at 4:00 pm.  All I wanted to do was put my feet up and take a short rest before my 7:00 dinner.  The room had not even been cleaned!  At this point I was pretty angry so once again called front desk and demanded it get cleaned.  They said OFTEN the rooms don't get cleaned until 6:00 pm!!! That's so ridiculous for a supposedly 5 star hotel.  Minus one more star.   The room was old and needed updating, carpet very worn out and drapes sag.  Would not recommend this hotel. I would suggest another hotel close by that begins with ""Sh______e"" ",1,2017,09,05
203,Great to be Back!,"We really loved coming back to the Westbury and it didn't disappoint. The service was excellent, the bed was very comfortable, the location is perfect, and breakfast was sensational.  When we were here last I swore that we would return the next time we came to the Dublin.  I plan for us to return again next year as well.  Everyone here does a great job and the housekeeping service went above and beyond for us.  The Westbury is still our favorite place to stay in Dublin.  We can't wait to we return!",5,2017,09,04
203,Exceptional Staff,"This is a hotel in transition -- they are in the midst of an ongoing, and badly needed renovation of the rooms.  If I were to base my review on the rooms alone, I would give the review a very weak three stars:  the walls of our suite had water stains, the toilet flush was coming off the wall, the carpets were sad, the safe was placed so high in the closet, that at 5 feet 7 inches, I needed a chair to reach it.  The bathroom lighting was so weak that I had to put on my makeup in another room near a window, and there was no plug for the hair dryer in the bathroom or anywhere near a mirror.  The pillows on our bed smelled as if someone had been sick on them.  I could go on...

What salvaged this stay for us was the exceptional staff.  Everyone we encountered, from the doormen to housekeeping, front desk staff to wait staff, exceptional concierge to helpful valets, everyone was friendly and went out of their way to be helpful.  Our funky pillows were very promptly replaced, and every other request we made (travelled with my husband, my mother-in-law, and our daughter) was responded to very promptly.

I hosted a large high tea at The Wesbury, and I felt that everyone I encountered on staff worked to make the event a success.  

When the renovation is complete, I have every confidence that this will be a great hotel.  Upgrading rooms only takes time and money.  But fostering a staff whose collective attitude is positive and works so tirelessly is priceless, and differentiates the good from the great.",4,2017,09,03
203,Excellent location ,"We had a lovely stay in Dublin and that is mostly due to two things: our choice of tour companies while in Ireland and this hotel. 

It is centrally located and allows you to walk to the main bus tour pick-up points, as well as several bus lines to get you to the main attractions. For example:

-Trinity College and the Book of Kells are a 5-minutes walk away.
-The Gaiety Theatre, where Riverdance is often playing, is only a 3-minute walk away.

The rooms have an old European feel to them but they are up to standards. Our bathroom looked like it was newly renovated, a plus.

The staff answered all of our questions in a speedy and courteous manner. Breakfast in the open dining room was simple but pleasant.

In summary, a great choice for visiting Dublin and the surrounding areas!
",5,2017,09,03
203,Great conference venue,"Good and efficient reception although they did mess up a colleague's check in.
Rooms also very good and conference facilities excellent. Didn't use the restaurants other than breakfast but the lunches provided in the conference rooms were very good. Would go again.
 ",4,2017,09,02
203,The Westbury.,"On a visit to Dublin yesterday and called into the Westbury hotel what a beautiful place, The hotel was very busy and  the service and staff are fantastic as soon as I walked in was asked are you okay sir, the bar was not opened ( not until 4 pm) but you can get service in the sitting area and  was well taken care off the decor in the hotel is top class they even have music which consists of a piano player so relaxing, Will definitely revisit in the near future had a really great experience well worth a visit, top class hotel.",5,2017,09,02
203,Excellent from start to finish,"Brought my mother for a special birthday treat and we received excellent service from the moment we were collected from the airport.
The Westbury is a beautiful hotel in a fantastic location. Our room was spacious with very comfortable beds and the Nespresso machine went down a treat.  We had dinner in Wilde's and the steak was amazing. 
Staff are so friendly and attentive, nothing was every any trouble. I will definitely return in the future.",5,2017,09,01
203,Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon tea at the Westbury is always a delight, from the deliciously decadent sandwiches, scones and pastries, the wonderful selection of teas and coffees, the exquisite presentation, and the ever friendly, courteous and wonderfully elegant staff. There are few better spots in Dublin to while away an afternoon than the wonderful 1st floor lounge with its comfortable elegance, unique ambience and eclectic mix of people. I always liken my visits here as akin to flying first class without actually ever leaving the ground. Afternoon tea in a fine hotel is always an indulgent treat to be savoured but nobody does it quite like the Westbury.",5,2017,08,30
203,Another fabulous stay at the best property around,"We travel to Ireland regularly and tour the country, always ending in Dublin. It is the best way to end a long road trip and the staff are always helpful and ready to help us to our rooms and take care of any needs we have as we regroup for the flight home. The concierge service assist in shipping our purchases home affordably so we don't have to struggle with overweight bags at the airport, and the tea service is a perfect and relaxing way to prepare for the trip back home to reality. 5 stars for the third time!",5,2017,08,30
203,Very Smooth Stay,"Went there for a business meeting. From check-in to check out the hotel was just great and comfortable. Easy access to a very decent complimentary wi fi. 
Great main restaurant serves really nice bkfast. 
Staff were awsome, friendly and smiling (Just what u expect from Irish folks)  
Catch of the stay for me was the next door Gym which compensated for the only flaw in the hotel which is the tiny ill equipped gym. ",5,2017,08,30
203,Perfect Location,"The Westbury was a perfect spot for a quick trip to Dublin. It's cenrally located but just slightly off the street so you feel out of the rush of the city. Lots of great sights around. The breakfast is super. The rooms are traditional but up to date and comfortable. The lobby bar which is a giant lobby area is fun and active. A great spot for lunch, tea or drinks.",5,2017,08,29
203,Afternoon tea ,We had a wonderful time having afternoon tea at the Westbury this weekend. In lavish surroundings with beautifully presented and tasty food the service was the icing on the cake. Adriana couldn't have been more pleasant or helpful explaining the different teas and how it all worked and accommodating my request to switch certain items as was jack who brought our beautiful selection of treats to us with a cheerful smile. I felt as if I were a celebrity being made feel so important and most definately will return again soon to treat my daughters to this magical experience. If you are considering visiting for afternoon tea I highly recommend it you will thank me afterwards. ,5,2017,08,28
203,Central location for an American Hotel,"I have stayed at all the major hotels in Dublin and each offers its own distinct character and pros/cons.  The Westbury is centrally located, in fact could not be more central if it tried, just tucked off on Grafton Street. The Lobby resembles any large upscale hotel in a major US City on a College Football Day. Groups of Americans meeting and looking for tickets to games/concerts/trips/tours. I lived in the US so am happy with this but some may find this a turn off. I guess Dublin is the first stop on the US tour of Europe.  The rooms are good, fine on space. The breakfast however is crammed into balcony type affair off the lobby and seemed full to the gills. The Staff were excellent as I did arrive last both days and was fed.  Overall it is expensive for Dublin, a bit charmless but central and handy.",4,2017,08,28
203,Afternoon tea,"Beautiful 5 star hotel , plenty of tea coffee and cappuccinos , excellent service , staff very attentive, and food was amazing and the best hot chocolate for the little ones üòäwill definitely return soon we really enjoyed our day 
",5,2017,08,27
203,Excellent staff and comfortable rooms,"We arrived at the hotel only to learn that our room was not ready due to the prior occupant having a family member hospitalized.  Hotel manager was extremely apologetic and offered us drinks and food at the hotel lounge.  The entire staff was incredibly service oriented and helpful.  Nobody would let us lift a finger and did everything they could to make our stay comfortable and welcoming.  Rory, the manager, in particular was fantastic.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin the next time we return.  Great hotel, great staff, great location...",5,2017,08,26
203,Promises a lot but the service is lacking.,"A lot of promise on arrival and some nice welcoming touches but the little things seemed to ignored. Blocked sink, poor cold water pressure, late room service (room made up at 4pm), unanswered concierge phone. These issues can be common with city hotels but it doesn't take much to look after the small things.",4,2017,08,26
203,Perfect hotel in perfect location,"The staff are superb, they even greeted my children with little teddy bears from the hotel! Service is excellent, food is wonderful and the location is ideal. Rooms are modern and well appointed and air conditioned. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,08,24
203,Afternoon tea ,Champagne afternoon tea. Incredible service with attention to detail. Great food which can be topped up if required. The ham sandwiches were delicious. You can make any substitutes if you have allergies or disliking to something in the menu. Also one of the best coffees I've ever had!  Def worth a visit.,5,2017,08,21
203,"Beautiful hotel, great service and good location","We were not able to check in our room when arriving the hotel because their cleaning was late on that day. The staff apologized and provided a room for us to freshen up before our room is ready. Each employee we met is so friendly and helpful and makes us feel we are special. 

The location is very good, walking distance to most of the attractions. 

We had three meals at hotel restaurants. Good service, great food, and reasonable price. Our room is spacious, clean and bright. Will stay here again when visiting Dublin next time.",5,2017,08,20
203,Afternoon Tea,"The Westbury afternoon tea was one of the best we've had across Europe.  The staff is excellent, the setting is very nice, they are very flexible with whatever you prefer to order, they will bring you more of anything without hesitation, and everything was great.  Highly recommend!",5,2017,08,20
203,Great location and service; average room,"- Great location , right on Grafton street, in easy walk of shops, scores of local pubs , restaurants and many key tourist attractions
- Excellent service; every staff member I met was highly professional
- Nice hotel building but rooms, whilst kept to a high standard are ageing and generally on the small side compared to other more modern hotels in Dublin 
- The gym is almost non existent, few machines, no proper free weights and small and old; they have some kind of relationship with a local health club however

",4,2017,08,20
203,Plush Accommodations in the Heart of Dublin,"You would be hard pressed to find a better hotel for service.  Location was perfect, just a block from Grafton Street.  Breakfast was in a lovely room with excellent food.  Room was very quiet with very comfy beds.",5,2017,08,19
203,Good location but disappointing room,"We were persuaded by an Irish friend to stay here rather than The Merrion mostly because of its location. We'll, the location is very good but the room we were allocated was like a shoebox. We'll decorated and with a front view (nothing special) but very small. Not somewhere you could really relax without tripping over things when you moved.
Everyone was very helpful and friendly but it somehow lacked whatever it is that makes the experience special. Here it was mainly the room.",4,2017,08,18
203,Superb afternoon tea,Booked afternoon tea as a surprise birthday treat for a friend on a Monday afternoon.  Had advised hotel of this and they presented my friend with a lovely cake with a birthday message which was a lovely personal touch.  The Gallery Room was beautiful and the surroundings lovely. Hotel was busy with diners so advise booking. Staff were very pleasant and attentive.  Food/beverages were delicious and staff advised you could ask for more at any time and they would replenish.   Afternoon tea was expensive but would highly recommend for a special occasion.,5,2017,08,18
203,"Location, Location, Location","I've loved visiting The Westbury since it opened its doors. Accommodation is as you would expect from a 5 Star hotel.  It's lounge is sumptuous, cosy & elegant.   Food & service is excellent.  Put your head in for a drink and enjoy the warm atmosphere of The Westbury.",5,2017,08,18
203,70th Birthday,Had my 70th Birthday Party at the Westbury. We stayed for 4 nights and had a wonderful time. Upon arrival on 9th Aug we were disappointed with our rooms - only a small window overlooking back of hotel very dark. We expressed our disappointment and very quickly were allocated 2 much nicer rooms. The staff are outstanding nothing is too much and they are so welcoming- we loved the area close to reception and the bar so full of life. We have stayed before and will stay again - Thanks,5,2017,08,17
203,Would go back in a second!,"The Westbury is smack dab in the middle of Dublin but you would never know it! It is about a 20 minute ride from the airport and it is located on a quiet side street. Very elegant but not stuffy and it is staffed with the nicest, most gracious people you will ever meet. The desk staff upgraded us to the Presidential Suite which was extremely spacious and well appointed. Our reservation came with breakfast which we thoroughly enjoyed every day of our stay. The concierge was extremely helpful with day trips and tickets. We would definitely go back - I hated to say goodbye!",5,2017,08,17
203,Beautiful hotel,"I've stayed at The Westbury a few times over the past year and on every occasion I have been looked after and welcomed back on my return, notably from Lorena on Reception- a true asset & wonderful ambassador for the hotel.
Rooms are really nice and luxurious, as one would expect from a luxury hotel. From the overall decoration and quality of furnishings/ fittings, it is obvious the significant investment which has been made in the hotel...it certainly raises the bar & one would hope other luxury hotels take note.",5,2017,08,17
203,Good central business class hotel,Perfectly decent hotel. Good location in the middle of town with the usual friendly Dublin staff. My room was next to the (small) fitness suite which meant that I was woken at 5.30am by an over eager user of the running machine - so that's a room to avoid. While everything worked and was pretty smart I think it's approaching the age when a refurb is needed. Lovely breakfast room though.,4,2017,08,16
203,"Great location, good hotel","Love the location of this hotel, if Dublin City is the main reason for your visit, then this is the hotel. As it's right in the heart of Dublin the area can be busy and noisy.
Food excellent, incl high tea and breakfast.
Room was in good condition
Lifts were good
Staff were good, some were great,depending on what area of the hotel.
2nd time I have stayed here and this trip gave me no reason no to return.",4,2017,08,15
203,Rooms slowly tired but public rooms and service very good,"This hotel is in a very central location and has good facilities, with a great restaurant and a good bar.

I wasn't overly convinced about the room, particularly the bathroom being a little small and with a weak shower, but I think this is a symptom of the hotel being slightly old.  However, none of this was bad, I'd just expect a little more in a hotel at this cost.

I would cheerfully stay here again.",4,2017,08,15
203,"Excellent stay, friendly people and location, location.",The staff from front desk to house keeping always cheerful and helpful. The bathroom was well appointed and clean. The rooms were pleasant and of adequate size. We stayed 9 nights and everything was lovely and efficient. The location is the best with many restaurants and shops around.,5,2017,08,15
203,Little piece of heaven,"Sublime! We were here for afternoon tea on Saturday to celebrate my aunts 80th. The staff were fantastic, they could not do enough for us. Impeccable in every way. They are a credit to you. The selection of teas and coffees, sandwiches and goodies were superb. It was a little piece of heaven on a Saturday afternoon. We will be back! ",5,2017,08,15
203,Afternoon Tea,"I would never count myself to be a technical person but I had to come on to congratulate the westbury on their impeccable service. We recently visited for Afternoon Tea as party of my daughters party due to Ben married next weekend. The staff here are incredible and the service simply outstanding. Our waitress Sarah for the day not only catered for our fussy needs of sandwich selection, she was able to remember exactly which tea or coffee we had and right on hand to refill when needed. The management sure do know how to manage a good team and it's so nice to see a smile on all your staff's faces!
Sarah you couldn't have made our day any more special than you did and we can't thank you enough! I look forward to returning to the Weatbuey for Afternoon Tea with my friends closer to Christmas and will certainly be asking for you!

Warm wishes,
Leanne",5,2017,08,14
203,Simply perfect,"What a wonderful place to stay.  I stayed with my three daughters and we simply have not come across customer service like it. The exceptional courteous and friendly welcome from the valet parking attendant wanting to take our luggage etc and making friendly chitchat about shopping. 
The welcome at reception very professional but warm and inviting. The room itself exceptional in its facilities, decor and a very good size. Although we didn't dine in house we had after dinner drinks in the upstairs lounge and once again customer service was to the fore, not overly attentive but obviously taking care to see we were not without drinks. 
It was a pleasure to stay with you Mr O'Gorman and your very capable team,  you have a first class hotel with first class standards and service, and I hope it long continues for you.",5,2017,08,13
203,Nice traditional hotel,"Good beds, nice food and very friendly service.  The hotel's location is perfect for shopping, visiting musea and many more.  From the airport of Dublin it takes not more than 40 minutes and it is easy to access. ",4,2017,08,13
203,Perfect location,Location perfect . The mezzanine perfect for a business meeting . Surtounded by quaint pubs to bring clients . Servive v good . A lovely blonde lady on reception most helpful . Highly recommend  for consistant standards,5,2017,08,12
203,Westbury - Great Location but some issues.,"The Westbury Hotel is right by Grafton Street, near St Stephens Square and the Trinity College. 
Porters, Housekeeping and Breakfasts excellent.
Dinner food and service average.
Classic Queen room #201 was pokey and right beside noisy Gym. 
Still a good stay, but some staff need to be a little less pretentious.  ",3,2017,08,12
203,Afternoon tea,"We visited today for afternoon tea. Got a fabulous table with a view of grafton street. 
The staff were excellent. The food and service were fantastic. 
Our waitress Ecatrina( not sure if spelling is correct) was professional, friendly and efficient. She could not have done more for us. Had young daughter with me and she also loved it & the fantastic service. 
5 star service, thank you.

203,Afternoon tea at the Westbury ,A very special thank you to the staff at the Westbury for a fab afternoon tea. Food was gorgeous and we were treated like royalty. All the staff were extremely attentive especially Tin who made us feel very welcome. I would highly recommend afternoon tea at the Westbury for anyone who wants to spend a special afternoon in the city.,5,2017,08,10
203,Concert in Dublin,"Nothing is too much trouble to the staff in this first class hotel.  We were attending a concert in the Aviva Stadium and the staff were happy to provide directions, provide details of public transport or arrange a taxi for us.  The rooms are spacious, spotlessly clean and very quiet.  There is a very friendly atmosphere within the hotel and, as stated, the staff are always available to assist in any way they can.  It is slightly expensive but it is an ideal hotel for that special occasion and worth every penny.",5,2017,08,10
203,Exceptional Service.  Comfortable Room.  Attractive Public Spaces.  But Not a Peaceful Atmosphere or Location.,"This is a very nice hotel with large public spaces and outstanding service.  Staff are exceptionally gracious and go far beyond what is asked for to accommodate guests.  My room was comfortable but the bathroom needed updating although the heated towel rack was much appreciated in Dublin‚Äôs damp weather.  There was a tub with rain shower but no separate shower stall so entering and exiting the shower required climbing over a high tub.  My room had plenty of lighting, a large desk and comfortable easy chairs.  In-room WIFI was fast and reliable.  There is nightly turn down service.  Breakfast was above average with a buffet of fruit, yogurt and breads and a variety of made-to-order egg dishes that were very well prepared. However, the dining room was unpleasantly crowded at breakfast most of the week because of a large pharmaceutical company convention.

My 5th floor bedroom had a large window that looked out over rooftops.  Soundproofing from the hallway was good but rooms on lower floors have windows that face directly into other buildings in the back or onto Grafton Street in the front, which is very noisy.   The hotel is in the city center, surrounded by bars and shops.  This makes for a noisy environment, particularly in the front of the hotel, which faces down Grafton Street with its rows of bars and hundreds of patrons standing in the street and drinking throughout the evening.  You would hear some of this noise if your room faces that street but my room faced the back of the hotel and for most of my week-long stay, it was quiet.  However, on my last night, a loud, thumping drumbeat from a party on another street continued past 1:00 AM until I called the front desk.  They were very responsive and after deciding it was not coming from Grafton Street, came up to my room to check it out.  I was told it was coming from a rear street and they would try to stop it.  Within a half-hour, it had quieted down.  

Whatever the annoyances, the exceptional service certainly compensated.  I probably would have appreciated the Westbury even more if I had not stayed first at the elegant, historic (and much quieter) Shelbourne a few blocks away.    I am giving it four stars only because I cannot rate it as highly as the Shelbourne.",4,2017,08,10
203,Experience in Dublin,"The Westbury hotel is a luxury hotel in the heart of Dublin.  Close to great restaurants, pubs, and tours; the perfect location.  The beds were comfortable and the turn-down service a treat, especially the delicious chocolate left on our pillows.",5,2017,08,09
203,Mrs Petric ,"The best place to go when you in Dublin ! The food is delicious and the service is perfect  ! Can't recommend enough 5* great selection of restaurants and bars , beautiful patio area with blankets when it's cold outside lovely selection of good wine plenty of healthy options in menu fresh pastries provided everyday !! ",5,2017,08,09
203,Enjoyable&special,"Myself and my husband stayed in The Westbury for one night over a busy bank holiday week end. 
The receptionist Jenny met us on arrival and was very friendly and personable; she was very attentative to our needs. Our concierge was also lovely and did all he could for us. We ate in Balfes after check in and enjoyed a lovely lunch. We had a lovely time overall and soaked up the atmosphere in town. 
We had a very pleasant stay, the staff were great & the location is a bonus.",4,2017,08,09
203,Ireland ,Bonny and I went through AHI travel. They did it all for us. The tour guide was fantastic. The hotel was first class and within walking distance to main attractions. Great people at the hotel. Seamed they could not do enough for us. ,5,2017,08,08
203,"Sidecar bar, something else.","Stayed here on final night of a minimoon round Ireland, we were blown away with the hotel, the staff and the ambience in the sidecar bar. A lovely lady and gentleman waiter brought us beautiful cocktails in a heavenly setting. I can't think of a nicer place to sit and imbibe. ",5,2017,08,07
203,Smiled the entire stay,"To The Westbury: Thank you! After 3 days up north that were great, you somehow topped it all and left us happier than we ever could have expected. From the moment we arrived we were greeted with the kind smiles of your welcoming staff. Never found ourselves with unanswered questions or wanting for anything. Afternoon tea was a wonderful experience. Our room was simply amazing. Comfy bed, lovely sitting area, wonderful view yet still quiet at night. I was disappointed to leave Dublin with only half of my must see list accomplished. There is only one solution to this problem... another visit to Ireland and another stay at The Westbury! Look forward to staying with you again in the future!",5,2017,08,07
203,Perfect location ,"Perfect location. Just off Grafton Street. Plenty of restaurants, bars and shops ""around the corner"". A number of the City monuments and attractions including the Temple Bar area and Trinity College within easy walking distance. Well equipped. Helpful and competent staff. However , rooms and bathrooms on the small side.",4,2017,08,06
203,Excellent afternoon tea,"Beautiful hotel in central Dublin.
Excellent service and food for afternoon tea - many thanks Adriana and Shauna!
Attention to details and careful to cater one's specific needs.
I'm normally not a fan of scones, but theirs are delicious. Very good teas.
Comfortable and relaxing environment, no 'uptighness'.
Perfect for a special occasion or a little bit of pampering.",5,2017,08,06
203,Mr,"Great end to our Dublin holiday at Balfe at The Westbury tonight 
Exceptional service from Gabriel our waiter who went the extra mile above and beyond our expectations - friendly and welcoming - perfect 
We will be back 
",5,2017,08,05
203,Fantastic,This is our 4th stay here. Absolutely perfect location and amenities.  Comfortable rooms. Great Bfast buffet. Awesome lobby bar and 2 great restaurants.  Great staff too. Highly recommend it a bit pricey but well worth it,5,2017,08,05
203,Great hotel in a fantastic location,"We stayed at the Westbury at the end of our Dublin-Galway-Dublin itinerary (side note:  the train to Galway is inexpensive, easy and just a bit longer than driving).  After small rooms at other hotels, the Westbury was a nice and luxurious way to end the trip.  Our room was spacious and nicely appointed, the staff was helpful and responsive and the friendly bartenders at the on-site bar make outstanding cocktails.  You cannot beat this location -- a block from Grafton but still quiet.  As a bonus for music nerds like me, the hotel is near the statue of Phil Lynott.  We will return to the Westbury.",5,2017,08,05
203,My hang out in Dublin,"Always love to  stay at the Westbury when in Dublin...(which is fairly often )
last week was no different. Just love to sit in the lobby with glass of wine in hand people watching. The hotel/staff/ambience are all just perfect.
 Kudos to a job continuing to be well done!",5,2017,08,04
203,Fabulous - Thanks To The Staff!,"This is the first place we stayed @ the beginning of a month's journey in Ireland & the U.K.. We booked the night before our arrival because our flight was getting in very early & we wanted to be sure we had the room.  Apparently, there was a miscue & the hotel thought we were a ""no show"".  Well, this amazing staff jumped right on it & had us in a room in no time.  They were really concerned that we might be inconvenienced in some way. It went uphill from there - they recognized us when we were in the lobby & asked if there was anything they could do to make our visit more enjoyable.  We were amazed by the fact they continued to check on us throughout our 6 night stay. We booked the room through Virtuoso (we use them or AmEx's platinum program which lists a room upgrade, if available, upon check in).  The hotel didn't have the upgrade the first night but called a day later & moved us into a junior suite.  Really lovely! Each & every employee from the front door to housekeeping is so well trained in this hotel & make every effort to make guests feel special. Joseph is the Guest Relations Manager who does a terrific job of making his guests feel welcome.  Rory is the Front Office Manager who we are still talking about.  WOW!  does he love his job.  We watched him interacting with guests & spending more time with us than he really needed to - an affable manager who wants everyone to be treated as special guests who will return again & again.  We most certainly will!
The level of service here ensures that guests will tell all of their friends when they return home.  We certainly did & can't wait to return - which we shall do!
Regarding rooms - we stayed in the standard room which really is fine.  A wee bit small as they would be in any city.  Of course, the suite was luxurious.  Could have moved right in.  There is a hearty Irish breakfast buffet with wonderful staff.  They even made me an iced tea each day! Our favorite treat was afternoon tea with champagne - don't miss it!",5,2017,08,04
203,Wonderful!,"We arrived here after touring Ireland for a couple of weeks and it was the perfect place to end our vacation. The level of service is like no other. Upon our early arrival, they noticed the ages of our daughters and gave them their own room connecting to ours at no extra charge. They basically received a king room to themselves. It's busy season too so this was an amazing gesture. The last few days here have been filled with the same kindness and hospitality. I wish I knew the name of the woman who cleans our room, she is the sweetest person. Derek who we spoke with before our morning trip to the Book of Kells was another stand out in my mind, so sweet...like he's known us forever. I could go on and on. The location is just perfect, near the best shopping and away from that awful Temple area. Trinity college is a short walk as are many of the sites that are popular with visitors.  There is a pretty little Catholic church almost next door where you can go for mass or have a nice breakfast and coffee in absolute peaceful quiet. There  are of course many great restaurants and the hotel can make reservations at any hard to get into place. It's simply one of the best, sad we have to leave tomorrow. ",5,2017,08,03
203,The best in Dublin,"We had a super stay in Dublin at the Westbury. Prime location, super friendly staff, excellent service. The room was perfect,tidy and clean. Nice breakfast, nice dining and a very nice Afternoon Tea. 
Will return here on our next trip to Dublin ! ",5,2017,08,03
203,"Excellent hotel, very helpful staff","Stayed three nights. Rooms spacious. Coffee, tea maker, , free Wi-Fi, safe in room. Supplied with very nice bathroom products. Combination tub/shower. Room checked daily. Kept orderly. Robe and slippers available. Bottles of water provided everyday. Staff very helpful. Out stay included breakfast which included ordering from a menu as well as an excellent buffet. Very high ratings for this hotel.",5,2017,08,02
203,Couple,"Very pleasant and friendly staff and great central location.
Stayed on top floor, heating/AC unit on roof was noisy at night. No health/spa facilities which you would expect for this caliber of hotel, rooms a bit small.",4,2017,08,02
203,5-Star Service and Accommodations,"Our first visit to the Westbury and this will be our hotel of choice in Dublin.  Joseph the Front Desk Manager and Mary Front Desk Agent went above and beyond to ensure our stay was memorable,  Our Guest room was luxurious and the breakfast room looks over a lovely street which leads to Grafton Street INCREDIBLE SHOPPING.  Trinity College and the Gaiety Theater just a short walk from the Hotel.  Fun Pubs an Dining This Hotel is truly in the center of everything.",5,2017,08,01
203,Amazing cocktails,"As a huge lover of cocktails, I went to the Sidecar Bar, ordered their special The Sidecar Signature cocktail, and really enjoyed it.

The staff is very friendly and polite - I know Iva, the waitress, and that's why I wanted her to make the cocktail. A barman Cathal helped her make it, great (and handsome) guy. I ended up having three glasses and a tray with nuts in front of me.

Five stars for a reason! :)",5,2017,07,31
203,A well deserved 5,"I booked a deluxe room for my mothers 70th.  As we entered the hotel the staff set the tone which was one of warmth and sincerity.  The room was upgraded and checkin was swift. 

The room was large albeit proportionally the bathroom could have been bigger.  The view was facing the front of the hotel and certainly no noise (3rd floor).

Breakfast was served with he same flair  and certainly you won't leave hungry and the setting in Wilde is bright and airy.

Yes it is expensive but as long as the hotel hits your expectations and in this case exceeds then it is worth it.",5,2017,07,31
203,Best city centre hotel in Ireland..,"The Westbury has been my ""home from home"" for almost five years now and remains my first choice for overnights in Dublin. Centrally located, it is convenient for shops, restaurants and most business venues alike. The rooms are decorated to a high standard although some can be a little small (which is to be expected when you are in city centre locations.) The gallery, bar and dining areas all tingle with a magical atmosphere, especially during the latter half of the week and there can be few finer places to meet for a pre-dinner drink at the Sidecar Bar for a touch of Gatsby in Dublin! Front of House, Food & Beverage and Concierge teams are all first class - they usually anticipate my needs, are prompt, courteous and efficient so well done all. The only minor downside is that the gym is a little small so if that matters to you, plan for another activity like a city walk. Highly recommended.        ",5,2017,07,31
203,great location,"location couldn't be better for shopping on Grafton street , great atmosphere in hotel but rooms were standard , food was fabulous , staff were so nice especially door man he recommended a nice cocktail bar , always wanted to stay here but wouldnt be up there with my favourite places to stay but we had a fab time",3,2017,07,31
203,An Experience!,"Another first class experience at The Westbury Hotel.  It is really a treat.

The staff is extremely helpful and friendly.  The fresh flowers in the lobby set the stage.

The hotel is a short walk from the excitement of Grafton Street -- pubs, restaurants, and more!

The rooms are a little small, but very nice.  I had a great bed plus two very comfortable chairs.  The desk allowed for work plus it had an American electrical outlet.

The bar was an experience.  Elegant is the only word for it!",5,2017,07,30
203,"Nice hotel, good location, poor service","This is a nice hotel in a great location but found service lacking for the price.  Check in service left a bit to be desired.  We ended up going back to lobby to get our own bags because they were not delivered to us timely.  Almost felt like since we may not have looked like we should be staying in such a nice hotel, since we had been traveling for quite some time before arriving, that we got service based on our appearances.  That being said, room was spacious but the 2 queens are really more like two doubles.  We had a maintence issue with the reading lights but apparently after 7 on Sunday you are out of luck.  I have never experienced this in all my stays in other high end hotels.  Good thing it was the bathroom that was flooding.  Location is great but doubt I would stay here again.",3,2017,07,30
203,Disappointing,Stayed at The Westbury to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary and while the staff were friendly our room was very disappointing. I had stayed at the hotel before and had a lovely room so that's what prompted my husband to book it. We were visiting family in Dublin and my husband booked the hotel as a surprise. My husband paid 400 euro a night for a deluxe king room and the room was shappy. There were stains on the carpet and chair and the bathroom was outdated with mold on the tub. We have stayed at numerous upscale hotels and have never had a room like this. We had a view of what looked like ac units and a garbage area and he booked it directly with the hotel. The door to the room was directly beside the bed which was awkward. When paying these sort of room rates you expect a better experience. We had to wait for the room to be ready which was annoying as we went in after normal checkin time. Sadly I will never stay at the hotel again.,2,2017,07,30
203,Beutifull 5 star Hotel,"Been to The Westbury Hotel few times before and this luxury hotel always delivers.
Beautifully appointed rooms with the most confy beds I have ever experienced.
Don't miss the opportunity to go for their afternoon tea, which is an institution in town.",5,2017,07,30
203,"Like this hotel, would definitely return","This is a lovely, very elegant hotel just off Grafton St. one of the main shopping streets in Dublin and close to Trinity College.  The rooms are super comfortable, wonderful beds and the breakfast buffet is huge with top quality Irish products, sausages, bacon, smoked salmon.. etc.  Also great bar and separate afternoon tea room in addition to the restaurant.",5,2017,07,29
203,adore this hotel,"Their afternoon tea is wonderful and our room was spacious and spotless. I sometimes meet people for coffee/business meetings in the upstairs lounge, staff are friendly and seem to respect privacy too.",5,2017,07,29
203,Met sightseeing needs,"Comfortable, clean, close to bars and shopping after sightseeing day. This may be a review for Dublin or Ireland as much as the Westbury, but we found the Irish people to be  warmer and friendlier as a whole than perhaps anywhere we've traveled. Must I leave a balanced review?  The only negative I can come up with is that the breakfast room is small and crowded relative to number of rooms.",5,2017,07,29
203,Beautiful Hotel,The Westbury is a grand hotel located in the heart of activity in Dublin.  Just a few steps off main pedestrian shopping mall and surrounded by restaurants and pubs.  Rooms are very comfortable and service was excellent.,5,2017,07,28
203,Grand enough ,"I stayed for 4 nights in this lovely hotel. The location was perfect, close to pretty much everything. The staffs were professional and courteous, the room was clean with a very comfortable bed and spotless bathroom. Ordered room service 2 nights in the row and the food was delicious. The only complaint was, once checked out, I sent an email to the reception inquiring about the charges in my credit card and received no response. Waited a few more days and sent another email, still no reply. What I received in the meantime, however, was a couple of requests for review. 

In the end, I had to contact my credit card company to dispute the charges,  which might or might be necessary. Why the hotel can't write a simple reply was beyond me. But other than the glitch at the end, the stay was enjoyable. ",3,2017,07,28
203,"Location, Staff, Quality","Having stayed on a few previous occasions, you could certainly get quality for a little lower price point in Dublin. But location is exceptional.Staff interaction very good. Food options in hotel ( Wildes/Balfes/Gallery ) very good. Extremely enjoyable experiance. ",5,2017,07,27
203,Amazing Service,"Stayed at The Westbury on the weekend of the U2 concert. 
While understandably busy, a couple of relatively minor issues had the potential to cloud our judgement of the hotel. 
Amazing service from Ashley on the concierge desk and Eimar in guest services not only resolved the issues, but ensured we'll return.  ",5,2017,07,27
203,Very HAPPY,"We had our LUNCH in this hotel last July 20 12.30 pm after our civil wedding, the hotel is GORGEOUS, ELEGANT and the STAFFS ARE VERY FRIENDLY especially the fello who is in charge to serve us in the restaurant . The restaurant's name is WILDE,THE SERVICE is Fantastic they looked after us really well.We REALLY ENJOYED the food very well presented and tasty. I HAD RIB EYE STEAK and the best steak ever. They gave us a memorable experience and was so FULLY SATISFIED  and thankful we booked there esp that day we got MARRIED",5,2017,07,26
203,Croke Park visit for U2,"Chose this hotel as is ideally located to be able to walk to Croke Park. There are loads of shops,bars and restaurants within minutes no taxis needed as is so central. We arrived at 1.30 our room wasn't ready until 3pm which we expected. We were able to leave our bags go and have lunch in Cafe En Seine then do some shopping. On return our room was ready we had a Queen room excellent facilities. Hair dryer,safe, full size mirror, Nepresso coffee machine, kettle, toiletries, bathrobe and slippers. We went to the concert and when we returned housekeeping had been that night and had left more toiletries and chocolates. The bed was the most comfortable that we had slept in for a long while. For breakfast we had a mixture of continental and full Irish both were excellent and the table was cleared away quickly. Wonderful hotel great location ",5,2017,07,25
203,An Elegant  Hotel in the Perfect Location in Dublin,"The Westbury is in an Excellent Location on Grafton Street. - near Trinity College, Upscale and Souvenir Shops, Gardens, Museums,  and Churches.  The Staff, Food, and Services are incomparable,  and the Rooms are well appointed and immaculate.  Highly recommend you stay here if you plan on going to Dublin.  We will be back!! ",5,2017,07,24
203,Elegant stay in the perfect location,"Just returned from a stay at The Westbury in Dublin. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi, we knew we had chosen the perfect hotel. The hotel itself has a contemporary elegance that was unmatched by any other hotel we stayed in on our 10 day vacation. The guest rooms are beautifully appointed down to the ""Waterford-esque"" glassware and the food in both restaurants was extraordinary. I cannot wait to go back!!",5,2017,07,24
203,Great Hotel but WAY overpriced!,"We only stayed one night at the Westbury before moving to the Intercontinental.  The location was great, the rooms were small but comfortable.  Service was impeccable and staff super friendly.  Not pretentious for a 5 star hotel.  I have to give it only 4 stars because it's way over priced, the rooms weren't really 5 star worthy and aside from the public areas, it's no different than a nice Hilton or Marriott property.  I'd recommend for the location but honestly, how much time can you spend on Grafton St?",4,2017,07,21
203,Fizz with a view ,I often pop in here to meet friends for a glass of bubbles. The view overlooking Grafton street is brilliant. Although pricey. A really lovely treat! Service is top notch and they have a great selection of drinks! ,4,2017,07,21
203,Nice Hotel in Good Location but Pricey,Stayed here one night for a business trip.  The service was top notch and the room was nice but not over the top (a little small but typical for Europe).  The rooms were clean and well appointed and while I did hear some noise from other rooms it was reasonable.  The hotel is in a nice restaurant and bar district so you can walk outside and find pretty much any type of food or bar you are interested in. I did not get to try any of the food service as my stay was short.  The price is a bit high but this might be typical for downtown Dublin so if price is not a factor this is a nice place to stay.,4,2017,07,20
203,Tea Time at The Westbury,"We had tea time at The Westbury.  It was fabulous, elegant and sophisticated.   Great tea selection, lovely sandwiches, scones and pastries.   The only thing that threw me off was when the reservations were made we were told there was a dress code and yet we saw people there in shorts and ratty tshirts.  I'm not sure why they allowed them in the room dressed like they were pool side.  I still recommend doing tea time at The Westbury and indulging in the surroundings, the tea, champagne, and treats.",5,2017,07,19
203,Beautiful hotel in great location,"Had a wonderful stay here. Such a gorgeous hotel with great staff. Room was fantastic, and such a comfy bed. The hotel is so close to main shopping area in Dublin, so no need for getting a taxi. Food in Wilde restaurant is delicious, and afternoon tea in the foyer is bliss. Worth a stay here. Can't wait to go back. ",5,2017,07,19
203,Brief Dublin vusit,"A great location. Great to arrive to valet parking. Very central, shops, bars, restaurants. The location is the best part really.
Hotel is nice. Rooms are a little on the small side. Breakfast of eggs Benedict was lovely. 
",4,2017,07,19
203,The 405 Euro Dark room,"Very disappointed with my recent stay at the Westbury, woke in the morning to find all electricity in the room was not working, called reception at 7.00AM  who said they would send someone to sort it.
No one came before I checked out at 8.30.
Just not what I would expect for a 405 Euro a night room excluding breakfast. Very poor.",2,2017,07,18
203,Great hotel!,This is a terrific hotel.  Gorgeous lobby and rooms with a location that cannot be beat.  The staff checked us in with warm towels and cold water after a long drive which was an unexpected treat.  Would definitely stay here again and I recommend it highly!,5,2017,07,17
203,AMAZING,"stayed on friday and saturday night. we had room 512 on the fifth floor which had an amazing view down grafton street. the bed was soooo comfy and the pillows were so soft. had an amazing nights sleep. we used the inroom coffee pod maker which was a great addition. the staff were so nice and friendly. breakfast was included in our rate and was top class. excellent choices, especially nice were the little granola pots filled with a fresh fruit puree, yogurt and granola on the top. yummy. had the full irish breakfast which was cooked to perfection. poached eggs were amazing. filled me up for the whole day. the staff were nice too, they could not do enough for you. 
the hotel is great for location, right next to all the shops, designer and non designer. walking distance to all the dublin attractions. short walk to trinity college which is nice to go people watching and see the old building.
hope to stay again soon!",5,2017,07,17
203,"Delightful tea, even better staff","Came here for afternoon tea with my wife, the food was brilliant the tea vibrant and tasty but above all else the staff were impeccable. Every single staff member greeted us with a pleasant smile and made us feel like we were dining on cloud 9.
Anastasi the girl serving our table was particularly good. Service like hers would really makes us want to visit again. Great customer service like this is a true commodity to any establishment. Be back for sure!",5,2017,07,16
203,5 Star Location ,"This was my second visit to the Westbury this year. The location in Dublin is perfect - in the heart of the city, definitely a 5 Star location. The hotel itself is lovely with super friendly staff. In room dining was good, nice menu, caters for a wide range of tastes. Breakfast was excellent.
Overall 5 stars! ",5,2017,07,16
203,Fantastic!,"Fantastic hotel! The location is the best, all the staff always smiling and efficient and great quality of food, rooms and service in general. They can add a Spa to their structure but a nice Guinness at their bar also helps to bring relax energy :) ",5,2017,07,16
203,Home Comforts,"Stayed 3 nights and 4 days as it was my birthday on the first day.
We had an early flight so was tired and were allowed to check in earlier than expected.
Received a complimentary bottle of wine and birthday treat to the room the next day and stayed in all evening on the second night as I was so tired and the hotel room was so comfortable. The food and breakfast was excellent, the hotel lounge  had a piano which mymusician son was playing and people and myself  were enjoying but unfortunately was told to stop playing  a more senior person.",5,2017,07,15
203,Nice hotel in the heart of Dublin,"If you are looking for a luxury hotel centrally located in Dublin, then stay at the Westbury. Was it my favorite hotel in Ireland, not really. While the decor was fresh/new and service was excellent, it lacked some of the charm that I had experienced at the older hotels in Ireland. It really is a lovely and romantic hotel. Great location near some good pubs and shopping. Comfortable room.",4,2017,07,13
203,Graduation,"Lovely place
We went here for a small celebration after my son's graduation. We had delicious bar food in very pleasant surroundings. The selection of deserts and cocktails were delicious. A small problem with one meal was rectified easily. All staff were very professional, polite and efficient. A delightful spot in the middle of a busy city.",5,2017,07,13
203,Afternoon tea in style,Had a fabulous afternoon tea with my friends recently. We were told it was a 2 hour sitting but we ended up staying a lot longer! The atmosphere and staff were just lovely! Hard to imagine you are in the middle of Dublin in there! Great attention and care. Even got more scones which were delicious! Pricy but absolutely well worth it for a special occasion or if you are new to the city!,5,2017,07,11
203,Lovely hotel,I was traveling alone to meet up with  family for a visit. This place was great. Great location. Nice room. Friendly staff. Safe. Great amenities. Near lots of the sights shopping & dining. A little pricey but worth it. I hope to return again.,5,2017,07,10
203,Most Delightful Afternoon Tea,"From the moment that we arrived we received very attentive care.  We were taken to our sitting area which was beautifully set with tea service.  This was a special occasion for my granddaughter who was celebrating her 16th birthday with this trip.  It was a delicious assortment of tea sandwiches, scones and desserts.  We started the afternoon with a glass of champagne which is an absolute must.  A special dessert was prepared for my daughter in law since she is allergic to chocolate.  While afternoon tea is very pricey  it is worth the experience.",5,2017,07,10
203,What on earth has happened at The Westbury?,"This is our 'go to' place when in Dublin for an event, it's our treat to ourselves and until now it has been consistently exceptional.  On this occasion we arrived a bit later than check-in time but our room was still not ready, so we left our bags at the desk while we visited McDaids just opposite - go to any 5 Star hotel anywhere and in this instance you would be invited to a lounge with a complimentary drink from the bar while you waited, so not a great start.  When we arrived back at our room we discovered that only one of our two bags had been brought up - I went to recover the other which had not been tagged at reception.  The Westbury serves what is probably the best toasted ham & cheese sandwich anywhere, this time though they committed the tomato jam and when I asked for an ice cream I was informed there was none - seriously, a 5 Star hotel in a city centre has no ice cream?  On previous visits there was always a choice of water in the room, still or sparking, but on this occasion only still.  This lack of attention to detail, less than stellar service was only to be compounded at breakfast.  We arrived for breakfast after 9, and we waited to be seated, and we waited, and waited. The lady in front of us was reduced to seeking out a member of staff, we were seated shortly after by a rather gruff individual who did not give you the genuine 'good morning' feeling, quite the opposite, and when I got to our table I had to clean crumbs and other remnants off my chair - this was a clear indication as to how breakfast was going to go.  I observed a waiter 'clearing' a table and his lack of interest in being there was evident and he either had no idea or had not been trained on how to conduct himself in a restaurant while in full view of customers, but his attitude was common throughout the breakfast staff.  When our breakfast arrived the plates were physically so large that the two plates could not fit on the table together with the tea & coffee pots, and the toast, without overhanging - it was a cluttered mess and not at all comfortable.  I went to the buffet in search of some nice cheese and smoked salmon - smoked salmon was not to be found, it had to be 'requested from the kitchen' and as for the cheese... Cheese slices arranged just as they come out of the packet! As though that weren't bad enough, the brie was a pile of melting gloop with only tongs to serve - no knife, it's like trying to serve soup with a fork.  The only member of staff who smiled in the entire room was the young lady serving us, the atmosphere was not a good start to the day.  So, that's what ‚Ç¨536 gets you for a night B&B in The Westbury.  Mercifully the doormen & concierge are still the great team as always but sadly this is no longer a value proposition and our night in a 5 Star Dublin hotel will be elsewhere - it's time for a change.",2,2017,07,10
203,Lovely hotel,"The Westbury is a lovely hotel conveniently located right off of Grafton street. The service is great with very professional and friendly staff. We arrived early in the morning, and were grateful to get a room around noon instead of the official check-in time. The food and drinks at the restaurants/bars are five star too. I'd stay here again, but for those who care about views I'd recommend letting them know in advance. Our room and a few of the rooms on the second floor have ugly views of their concrete balcony. For a 4 night stay it would've been nice to be able to see something else. ",5,2017,07,10
203,Pre our belond hibernia train journey,"Only for one night.  We had a delightful room not to good a view!  The staff could not have been more helpful.  We chose to eat in the Brasserie ,exactly want we wanted busy good food and helpful staff.  The only complaint was the air con,had to go and get a cardigan!  Breakfast inclusive which was excellent to.",4,2017,07,09
203,Great staff and location.  Small /so so room,"The Westbury is perfectly located in Dublin and I loved the service standards of this hotel.  From the moment you step out, the door man to the receptionist to the concierge, everyone was just absolutely wonderful.  Big warm smiles despite the amount of traffic that comes through this very popular and busy hotel.   I had a room on the 6th floor that had a view overlooking the shops below.   Loved the early check in and aromatherapy toiletries.  The room and bathroom were small but functional, the furnishing quite old fashioned (not my cup of tea), I can't say that I loved the hotel but I did really appreciate the smiley and good natured staff.   ",4,2017,07,09
203,Coldplay ,We had a wonderful stay at the Westbury. Great location and fabulous service. Special thanks to Jack Leach - keep up the good work. We will definitely be staying here again on our next trip to Dublin. ,4,2017,07,09
203,"Overpriced, tired rooms and slow service","Despite the 5 star rating, the decor in the room was a bit tired - nothing like the photos on the website.  Our window looked over a back avenue. The bathroom was tiny - you had to back over the toilet to close the door. The air-conditioning was permanently set on 16 deg but the room was hot and stuffy - a request to have it fixed on our first day was ignored.  The thick doors of the rooms slammed regularly making it a noisy stay.  The service trolleys and vacuum cleaners were permanently stationed in the hallways. 
The service in every bar and restaurant was slow and the waiting staff in the restaurant were surly.  Front desk staff were however very helpful with check in and concierge assistance. 
We wouldn't recommend it for the price.",2,2017,07,08
203,4 Nights with Children - Perfect Dublin hotel!,"The Doyle Collection made some new lifelong customers in us. We arrived on a Saturday morning after an overnight flight from Chicago on which our 5 and 8 YO daughters did not sleep. We were unable to check in until 2 but the staff were very accommodating and helpful. The room was spacious, well-appointed and bedding/pillows helped us transition to Irish time. 

The 2 characteristics that we appreciated the most were the:
  1) Location (as alluded to in other reviews) - centrally located 1 block off Grafton and easily walkable to St. Stephen's Square, Museum of Archeology, Dublin Castle and next to shopping along Grafton, Powerscourt and the Creative Quarter.
   2) Breakfast included was incredible and made the start of the day easy. There was a wide variety of choices at the buffet from tasty probiotic yogurt parfaits, fresh fruit/juice, salumi, and pastries. Additionally, you could order espresso, cappuccino, traditional Irish breakfast, eggs Hollandaise, omelet made to order or pancakes. At breakfast, our girls  said that ""this was the fanciest hotel we've ever stayed"" [at].

Finally, our last dinner was at Wilde (hotel restaurant) and the staff were extremely accommodating after there was some mix up in our food and delay that resulted in our 5 YO falling asleep at dinner.

We absolutely loved our 4 days at the Westbury and would return again. ",5,2017,07,08
203,Birthday Treat,My husband and I have stayed in the Westbury hotel in Dublin many times .The hotel never disappoints from the moment you walk in to you check out.Benedita at reception was so welcoming and great craic.We had a very small issue with our room and it was handled very professionally by the staff involved especially Eimear.Breakfast...delicious Cocktails...amazing  Staff....fantastic Experience...excellent that's why we go back again again and again.Thanks Westbury ,5,2017,07,07
203,Fabulous !,"I had some friends visiting from Canada and we decided to pop into The Westbury for a drink as it has been highly recommended. It did not disappoint! Right from when you enter the lobby, the hotel's fabulous interior gives an air of class and sophistication.

We headed to Sidecar, walking through the lounge. As we walked through, we were welcomed by staff at reception and a hostess at the lounge. Upon entering Sidecar, we were very impressed by the 'classic bar' feel of the place. The bar was lit up very well, showcasing the extensive collection of liquor available. Myself and my friends sat at the bar, where we were greeted by one of the barmen, who introduced himself as Adrian. We also received complimentary classes of prosecco served in delightful crystal coupe glasses and a selection of nuts. 

The cocktail selection was very good, with some modern twists on old classics. Adrian explained them all very well and gave us his recommendations based on our preferred alcohols. Each drink was delicious and very well presented. 

We thoroughly enjoyed our evening in the Sidecar and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drink and atmosphere. The staff are all so polite, a testament to the high standard of the hotel. This being my first time to the hotel, I will definitely be returning to experience more of what the hotel has to offer.",5,2017,07,07
203,excellent luxury night away,"My partner & myself work in the hospitality industry and we both loved our break away in this hotel, from the moment we arrived we felt welcomed by every staff member we met , Kevin on the door,Sophia at the front desk even the accommodation staff greeted us with smiles and good morning or good evening. The attention to detail is excellent and we have be telling everyone that they must visit this hotel. Prefect location, lovely atmosphere, friendly staff and the food was scrumptious.  I will definitely return again. Please please change nothing . The male manager at breakfast was fab as was Ana our waitress , my only disappointment was our room looked out onto roofs so no view but saying that it made it a quiet room so we had a great night sleep in it. Thanks for amazing break",5,2017,07,06
203,High Tea,"Today we had High Tea at the Westbury.  It had an amazing atmosphere and the food was delicious.  I recommend the Nutella Hot Chocolate!  eliana our server doted on us and the manager, Adil, ensured we had a lovely experience. ",5,2017,07,05
203,Exceptional,"Staff were professional, friendly and accommodating.  The location was great for us - easy to walk to shops, park, cafes and restaurants.  The hotel was very clean and quiet. We will definitely stay there again.",5,2017,07,04
203,Downgraded at Check In,"I selected this hotel based on their suites and the location. At check in we were told that the suite we booked was not available - maintenance issue. They explained that we could now have a twin room (2 double beds vs the king suite we booked). Or, if we wanted to wait a king room, but still even smaller than the twin room, ""may"" come available.  The twin room was 100 Euro less than the suite we booked and of course we wouldn't be charged for the suite we booked. However, I never would have paid 400 Euro for a twin room!!!  Management's handling of this really was poor. It was only after telling them of our disappointment several times did he offer to buy us dinner (which we really didn't want - but ordered something from room service). 

I've never been downgraded like this and still had to pay a ridiculous amount for a much smaller twin room. I would not stay here again, nor would I recommend it to friends. 

Book elsewhere. ",1,2017,07,04
203,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed here in the beginning of June.  it is a lovely hotel and we experienced exceptional service.  We had a great view of Grafton Street.  The location was perfect for exploring.

The mattress was super comfortable and we could have spent a look more time sleeping but there was too much we wanted to see.

The hotel was very busy but we didn't feel crowded or ignored.",5,2017,07,03
203,"Plush and elegant, great service and location","We were so impressed with our three-night stay at the Westbury! True elegance and luxury, great service and the best location in town.  We arrived on Bloomsday, and Grafton Street was hopping, but the hotel maintained its quiet elegance.  The lobby bar was an amazing retreat!  Breakfast was cheerful and delicious.  What's not to love?",5,2017,07,02
203,Afternoon Tea,"Recently visited The Westbury for Afternoon Tea with my Mother as a late Christmas gift. From start to finish it was exceptional! The service was top class and it was the nicest afternoon tea we have ever had, especially the truffled chicken! The 2 hours flew by, would definitely return! ",5,2017,07,02
203,Afternoon tea,"So my lovely friend booked us here for afternoon tea on Saturday as I was coming to visit. This was a luxurious, relaxing and enjoyable experience from start to finish. From wine and cocktails in the sidecar bar while we waited for our table to the delicious offerings when served our food. It has to be said though that the staff were a great part of our lovely afternoon. They were extremely courteous and attentive and made us feel so welcomed. This is a fantastic way to spend an afternoon in Dublin and I would highly recommend it!!",5,2017,07,02
203,Second stay here. Would recommend.,"This our second longish stay at the Westbury. We stayed for I think four nights two years ago. You simply cannot beat this place for location: it's literally a kilometre from all the major sights in Dublin. The staff are very friendly, courteous and go out of their way to be of assistance which you would expect from this class of hotel. The concierge assisted me in finding a number of things - all worked out really well. Plus a lovely fella! We had one incident where we had to move suites because of a water leak in the upstairs rooms which couldn't be helped of course. This was obviously a bit inconvenient (and we'd been packing and unpacking a lot during our trip) but the hotel did not charge us for that one night which we really appreciated as a genuine gesture and also the management offered us lunch (which we didn't avail ourselves of) and a bottle of wine (which did!). We had a very similar experience at the G in Galway the stay before this which wasn't handled nearly as gracefully unfortunately. On our last day we had some champagne and the truly lovely young woman in the bar brought us some farewell cake! This is a great hotel and the best place in our view to stay in Dublin. Genuine Irish hospitality. Highly recommended!",5,2017,07,01
203,First stay.,"This was our first stay in The Westbury. We found the experience an enjoyable one from start to finish. The hotel could not be in a more central position just off Grafton Street. The facade is very welcoming and the reception,one floor up from the street entrance, is well positioned and staffed by friendly,knowledgeable people.
Our room was a good size for a city centre hotel,with a very comfortable bed and excellent bathroom.
We used the residents lounge both before and after our evening out and it is a wonderful place to relax ,with very attentive staff.
Our breakfast in the beautiful  Wilde room was delicious with a wide range of hot and cold food available to meet all tastes.",5,2017,06,30
203,Outstanding service and location!,"Exceptional, outstanding service!  The location is ideal access to restaurants, pubs and shops.  Vibrant streets by both day and night.  The hotel staff went above and beyond expectations to meet all of our needs and special requests.",5,2017,06,29
203,Amazing cocktails,"We dropped in for one cocktail but were so impressed that we stayed for many more. You are paying premium prices here but it is really worth it. The cocktails are the best I have ever had, we were even treated to a complimentary glass of prosecco while we waited. 

We sat beside the fire in the bar and it made for a very pleasant evening. I cannot rate the experience highly enough.",5,2017,06,29
203,Stunning bar and service- I'll be back!,"I recently went to the Westbury for the first time and I was very impressed , the decor and ambiance in the sidecar bar is fantastic  ,I went there for my partner's birthday we sat at the Bar ,Daniel and Adrian took great care of us and made us feel welcome. We loved the complimentary Prosecco  while we waited for our cocktails , nice touch! The afternoon tea is a must  , we will be back again!",5,2017,06,29
203,Beautiful air-conditioned hotel downtown,Spent one night at this fabulous air-conditioned hotel before starting our Trafalgar tour of Ireland. Location is perfect in the downtown area right next to the walking street with much shopping and street entertainment. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel because there is an abundance of more authentic places to eat at just next door for much less. Taxi to/from the airport is about 30 euros. Do not take a bus from the airport to the hotel because it is a long walk from the bus stop on bumpy stone walkways. We learned our lesson. Get your Tax Free Shopping Fexco card as soon as you arrive at one of the retailers and use it all the time when buying merchandise. They do have other tax free shopping cards as well. You can get your tax back at the airport (it's 20+%!). They do charge about 6 euros fee for that.,5,2017,06,28
203,Amazing location and service!,"We enjoyed one night at The Westbury, and adored its central location from which we could walk to enjoy Dublin. The room and bathroom were clean, and the room was quiet.  The singular problem we had was that the air conditioner in the room wasn't cooling the room sufficiently.  Thankfully, the staff provided us with a fan that worked well to keep us cool enough to sleep after a long day of travel.  (To their credit, they offered to send someone to try to fix the unit, but we were too exhausted to wait for any repairs to be made.)

We left the next morning before breakfast was served, and were treated to two bags of assorted breakfast items, which was very thoughtful.",4,2017,06,27
203,A Cozy Nest in the Heart of Dublin,"The Westbury was a very clean and quiet place from which to explore the city of Dublin. The staff was extremely warm and welcoming. The amenities would be more than adequate for all but the most jaded traveler. On the breakfast menu , should you desire to have it brought to your room in the morning , was a quote from the famous Irish author Oscar Wilde : ""I have the simplest tastes. I am always satisfied with the best."" I'd say Oscar would be quite satisfied with his stay at this hotel. I was.",5,2017,06,27
203,"Great room , great time.",We recently stayed at The Westbury and really enjoyed our lovely room and the very helpful staff. All in all we loved Ireland but found Dublin just beautiful and the hotel was so central to all the sites that we wished to visit. Would recommend the Westbury if you stay in Dublin.,5,2017,06,26
203,afternoon tea  - delightful ,"The Westbury offers a really excellent city centre location, just off Grafton Street. The drawing room on the upper level is a great meeting place and the afternoon tea a real delight. Good service and friendly staff. ",4,2017,06,26
203,Incredible staff great location and stay,"5 star service!  The doorman, front desk ( Oisin) and others, Bar staff especially Iva from Croatia, and the great dining staff WOW Every person happy to be of service to you.  What an incredible team of staff.  The hotel is beautiful, perfect location for restaurants, shopping and St Stephens Green.  Its great if your traveling with older teens as they can walk around on their own in a safe area.
The rooms are typical nothing too exciting but again the staff at this hotel makes it an amazing 5 star experience. The only negative to this hotel is their showers.  I would not recommend it if you have any difficulty with knees, or stepping up or down.  The showers I felt were dangerous traveling with two elderly parents they could not access them safely.  I am not sure if there are different options but may be worth asking if this is an issue.
Breakfast was fantastic, ate in both restaurants.  Drinks at the bar great as well.   I would absolutely stay here next time. Great experience.",5,2017,06,26
203,Always a good choice,"I am a big fan of the Westbury. I travel to Dublin quite a lot and either stay at the Westbury or the Merrion. Normally it is only room availability that decides for me. 

The staff are excellent and the rooms are always in great condition and immaculately clean with crisp, fresh linen on wonderfully comfortable beds. 

The hotel is really well positioned being only a few steps away from the famous Grafton Street. 

I would highly recommend the Westbury. ",4,2017,06,25
203,"Great Location, Professional Staff","This hotel has an amazing staff and it's located steps away from Grafton street, pubs, entertainment and anything else you could possibly want to explore via a short cab ride in Dublin.  The amenities are beautiful and impressive and the bell staff attentive and efficient.  The rooms were not my favorite during our time in Scotland and Ireland but definitely fine.  We had come from a recently renovated hotel in Loch Lomond and so to be fair, anything is going to shine a little less when compared to brand spanking new.  This is a busy, bustling hotel in a busy, bustling city.  If you want high quality in a great location for exploring, this is a fantastic spot.",4,2017,06,22
203,Afternoon tea!!!,"Had afternoon tea during a hen party a couple of weeks ago. We had to wait a while to be seated but were eventually shown to a private room. Hotel staff were very polite and efficient and the food was delicious! Portion sizes weren't too big as they often are at afternoon teas. Half the party opted for the ""perculiar"" afternoon tea while the others had the traditional. Both were beautifully presented.Would definitely be back for afternoon tea if in Dublin ",4,2017,06,21
203,Overpriced very disappointing room,"Decided to stay at the Westbury in view of the hotel's claim to luxury, comfort etc.
Agreed pay a high price for a ""King Room with city view"" as it sounded worthwhile n terms of size and view..
However, the ""King Room"" was at the best as large as any average hotel room and the great city view was of a tatty office block across the road with noisy airconditioning equipment on the roof.
Both disappointing and very poor value for money!
",3,2017,06,21
203,Lovely visit to a beautiful hotel,Came to the Westbury bar for a few gin and tonics and sat in their lovely new open air area which was wonderful. Gergo was absolutely lovely AND remembered our drinks from the previous night (because we couldn't!) definitely a hidden gem and worth a visit!,5,2017,06,21
203,A Great Place To Stay!,"After reading other reviews, we decided to stay here! What a great location! Central to everything! A wonderful place to stay.
The staff was very kind, courteous and we had no problems whatsoever.  Our room was awesome and we were even asked if we wanted our bed sheets turned down nightly.  
We were always greeted with a smile on our face when entering the hotel and the staff helped us in any way possible.
Would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2017,06,19
203,Afternoon Tea at the Westbury,"I took my mother for afternoon tea in the Westbury on Sunday and from start to finish it was an amazing experience. I had already informed the staff that we were celebrating my mother's birthday.   So they made a fuss of her upon arrival.  The staff were amazing, in particular a lovely Hungarian waitress called Martha, she looked after us both so well.  The food was fantastic and plentiful.   The service was just the best.  We are now looking forward to planning our next visit.   Thank you to all the staff concerned",5,2017,06,19
203,"Great location, great hotel","We were staying in london and decided to take a train/ferry to Dublin.  Ferry was cancelled, and we were stuck in Holyhead for the night.  Called the Westbury and they said 'dont worry about it, we wont charge you for tonight'.  They didnt have to do that as we were past the cancellation cut off time.  Just shows how nice the people were.

Checked in, they couldnt do enough for us.  There were a couple small issues in the bathroom that needed maintenance, but nothing that affected us (more visual).

we had to leave very early to catch a plane (about 5:30am) so they even arranged a breakfast box for us to take with us without us even asking!  Great service.
And you cant get a better location, right in the middle of everything.",5,2017,06,14
203,Short but sweet stay,"We booked this hotel using one of the free nights we earned via the Leader's Club membership with two paid nights.   The free night was reserved for the most basic room category while we booked an upgraded room for the other two nights.   The hotel management upgraded all of our bookings to a Junior Suite, and it was a very pleasant surprise.   This is why we have come to love being a part of the Leader's Club.   

The location of the hotel is great.   It is right in the middle of Dublin and within walking distance to pretty much everything worth seeing.   Trinity College is just a few minutes away on foot. 

Our room is quite spacious, and it has a large sitting area.  Although we did find the bathroom to be on the small side with just a single sink and an awkwardly positioned faucet that was too far from the sink itself and the shower/tub is quite small as well.   It served our needs fine though as it was a rather short three-night stay.    Our room is very close to the elevator and as a result, a lot of noise could be heard with a lot of people coming and going even in the early hours.

All of the staff members are very accommodating and friendly.  They learned of our early departure for a tour around Ireland and offered to provide pastries in to go bags for our breakfast!  We did try the breakfast buffet and the quality was very good with a large selection.   For some reason, though, the front of house likes to seat people really close to one another.  We would have preferred a bit more privacy when dining.

All in all, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would most likely consider returning in the future.",4,2017,06,13
203,fine hotel in a great location,"We have now stayed at this hotel twice in 9 months.  It is centrally located and walking distance to just about everything of interest in Dublin.  If not, you are just a short cab ride away from wherever you want to go.  The rooms are luxurious and well appointed.  Service is very good.  The lobby can get a little crazy and the front desk can get backed up if there is a large group staying there (as there was both times we stayed).  That can make checking in or out a bit time consuming.  And the wait for an elevator can be frustrating )I only saw 2), so we just ended up taking the stairs most of the time.   These are the only reasons I wouldn't give this hotel 5 stars.  Other 5 star hotels have figured out how to expedite the check-in / out process and maybe they will too.",4,2017,06,13
203,Nice City Hotel,"Nice hotel in the center of Dublin.  The location was convenient to Grafton Street and shopping, Temple Bar area, Ha'Penny Bridge, etc.  The room itself was pretty small - I'd rate it a solid B (could use some freshening up / updating).  Breakfast was good, as was lunch at their more casual restaurant downstairs.  ",4,2017,06,13
203,The best hotel that I have ever stayed in. ,"I stayed briefly in this hotel earlier this month. My trip was cut short due to bad news. 
The hotel emailed me the day before to ask me my arrival time, which was early. They managed to get me an early check in. The room was gorgeous. The service was perfect. Location great. Bars and restaurants within the hotel were fabulous. 
Despite me being upset at check out the staff were genuinely lovely to me. 
I will stay here again. ",5,2017,06,13
203,Luxury in a great Dublin location,"If you are looking for luxury and a friendly staff in the middle of everything you could want to see in Dublin, the Westbury is a great choice.  Shopping and sights are right outside the door and the hotel has some great dinning and cocktail options.  The rooms are nice and everyone did their best to make our visit a special experience",5,2017,06,11
203,Good Location and Friendly Front Desk Staff,"The Westbury is located steps from Grafton Street and the common areas of the hotel have a nice, tasteful art deco flair.  The front desk staff are extremely friendly, professional, and helpful.  

The room was an average hotel room but nothing particularly remarkable.  The bed was comfortable (though two twin beds pushed together to make a king bed).  The room was rather noisy...I could hear the rolling carts from room service all day and night.  

Breakfast was served in a bright and beautiful setting and the food and coffee were good.  The service could be better at breakfast and employees should refrain from complaining about their colleagues within earshot of guests.  My advice: more focus on customers and less focus on sniping about colleagues.",3,2017,06,09
203,Wonderful Hotel-Wonderul Accomodations & Service,"This was our first stop in Ireland and what a wonderful way to start our trip. As most Americans, we arrived in the very early morning exhausted and unkempt. The hotel staff was fantastic and found us a room straight away that we could go and nap for a few hours before we hit the sights. It was a life savor! The room was lovely and the staff was courteous and helpful. The common rooms were beautifully appointed and the restaurant extremely good for dinner and the infamous Irish breakfast. Even more fantastic was its great location; close to shops and sights. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",5,2017,06,07
203,The best possible place for one night in Dublin,"We chose the Westbury based on the wonderful reviews, as well as the opportunity to enjoy an authentic afternoon tea experience with gluten free food options. Since we were only in Dublin for one night during a long layover, we are pleased we chose the Westbury. The location couldn't be better--we were able to maximize our time in the city and enjoy shopping, Irish dining, a visit to Trinity College (literally right around the corner), and a trip to the Guinness Storehouse, which was a must for my husband. The hotel itself was clean, and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. We ordered room service for breakfast to expedite getting out and about, and the food was mediocre. However, before hopping in a cab to the airport, we dined at Balfes, which I am SO happy about. My husband enjoyed an open-face salmon sandwich, and I was able to have gluten free fish and chips for the first time in years. We would 100% stay at the Westbury again when we return to Ireland. ",5,2017,06,06
203,My favourable experience with Westbury,"I can't remember how many times I have been staying at Westbury Dublin, it must be well over 10 times since I first started travelling to Dublin in 2013. The location is great, services are excellent, checking in and out is easy and efficient. Although the room rates are quite high, I still think it worth's  and I will definitely continue to stay here in my future trips to Dublin.",5,2017,06,06
203,Best Hotel in Dublin,"Our two day stay at The Westbury was a fabulous experience.  Staff was helpful, courteous, knowledgeable, and friendly.  The location is a short block from major shopping, restaurants, and entertainment.  Very comfy bed and a welcome place to stay after a long flight from the states.",5,2017,06,04
203,No Star ‚≠êÔ∏è can rank their standard of service!,"Having travel to numerous destinations and this being our second last on our itinerary, the warm and welcoming reception from doorman to reception desk was enchanting. This is not a modern nor clinical looking hotel, the lifts have tainted mirrors and a sofa too. Most importantly, the bed is so comfortable that you wished you could sleep in everyday.  Breakfast is top quality - must include if you have the budget. Amenities in the room totally adequate.  Housekeeping is excellent with room tidied up to 5star standards.  What impressed me most is that my mum passed away and I had to change tickets etc etc, the compassion I received from everyone of the staff was sincerely heartfelt and very touching (even the Conceige in the lift asked if there is anything he could help).  One young lady in particular help me with my airline tickets and hotel cancellation issue.  Thank you Sophie and everyone at the Westbury, my compliments to the management cultureüëçüëç",5,2017,06,04
203,Not Well rated Hotel !!,"The Hotel is not well rated, it should be a 4 * or 3 * category. It is well located and nice, but very far of  being a 5* Hotel,  and of course very expensive for the service you get. They even claim to be part of ""The leading hotels of the World"", from which I know a few and certainly this hotel should not be in that list. I stayed for four nights at the Westbury  in which I had to re activate my key cards for the room almost 8 times. In this 8 times I was forced to go to the front desk I never  found a person able to speak in Spanish or French, it is not acceptable for this kind of Hotel  not  to have bilingual  employees.  The lower  levels of the building have three restaurants / bars, but not a single lounge or place to seat as all hotels have !! the electrical part of the rooms seem to be very old.",2,2017,06,03
203,Five Star Hotel,"Stayed at The Westbury Hotel for two nights in May. After long flight, it was nice to get to hotel and be able to check in early and start our vacation. Front desk staff was excellent and extremely friendly. From the doorman to the concierge desk , you couldn't ask for better service. They gave great advice for things to do in Dublin and if you needed directions they were there to help. The rooms were five star. Hotel has parking . Just drive up and unload car and they valet it for you. Would recommend Baffles for a great Irish Breakfast to start your day. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2017,06,03
203,Centrally located off Grafton street,"Great hotel with extremely good service. Pricey but excellent location for walking to major sites. Call hotel directly for best prices rather than calling booking sites. When I called for info on booking, booking through them directly, by calling hotel, included breakfast every day. Not so with booking sites they charged extra.",4,2017,06,02
203,ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE,Came here last weekend for a surprise afternoon tea whilst on my hen weekend in Dublin.  I cannot praise this place enough.  There were 10 of us in total and the staff really couldn't do enough for us.  The service was impeccable which was impressive considering how busy it was.  The sandwiches and scones and cakes were all delicious and I cannot WAIT to return. Super special place!,5,2017,06,02
203,Lovely hotel,"We were recently there for one night - we arrived early on our flight from the U.S. and as a result sat in the lobby for the morning.  The staff was warm, welcoming, and efficient.  They offered us breakfast as our room was not ready.  The breakfast restaurant served a terrific buffet with served hot dishes, all delicious and nicely prepared.  The room was excellent, with a nice view over the city and comfortable surroundings.  It was quiet, the bathroom was large and well-equipped with toiletries, and closets were all in order with plenty of room.  The location of the hotel is also excellent, it is within walking distance of shops and pubs in downtown Dublin.  We can't find a thing to complain about other than one minor detail - they kindly offered us an upgraded room, but then we had a longer wait - might have preferred the choice for a smaller room with a shorter wait, as we were fairly jetlagged.  But all else was nice so we forgive that.. .",5,2017,06,02
203,Stunning afternoon tea,"Great staff who waited on us hand and foot - treated us like royalty.
Beautiful food in stunning surroundings.
Not inexpensive but a fantastic way to spend an afternoon.
The pink Prosecco certainly helped!

203,Beautiful Hotel,"As the title of this review states, The Westbury is a beautiful hotel. From the moment you enter, the surroundings and fragrance envelope you... The service is cheerful and accommodating, and the restaurant and bar are truly outstanding looking. The room we stayed in was lovely, but it could have been cleaner, which it wasn't. For $400 a night, I was expecting it to be spotless all-around. Hence the 'Very Good' rating.",4,2017,06,01
203,"Fabulous accommodations, superb location","The Westbury was our first stop on our whirlwind journey around Ireland. We stayed three nights at this central Dublin location and were not disappointed. The Westbury offered a convenient location to visit top Dublin sights like Trinity College which is home to the Book of Kells, Dublin Castle, Temple Bar, the Molly Malone Statue, the main shopping hub of Grafton Street, and just a few blocks from the Guinness Storehouse and Jameson Distillery.
Beyond the great location, the hotel did not lack accommodation or style. The lobby was gorgeous with luscious and intricate floral displays. Breakfast in the hotel was superb in the atrium like setting. I had the Eggs florentine and it was delicious.
The rooms were quite comfortable and clean, though the view from our room was just of rooftops. Each night they offered turned down service, with a great piece of chocolate and a bottle of water. 
The staff were friendly and extremely helpful in guiding us to fabulous dining options and sites around the area. 
All in all you couldn't ask for more as far as luxury, comfort, and convenience, but the price tag is a bit steep for the ordinary traveler. I stayed here on a study tour with our group, but could not personally afford to stay when I returned to Dublin with the husband. It was a real treat to stay at the Westbury.
On the return journey we stayed at the Jury Inn at Christ Church. See my corresponding review of the accommodations.",5,2017,06,01
203,We had one night in Dublin - The Westbury was Fabulous!,"We had traveled all over the east coast of Ireland over the previous 9 days and wanted to spend our last night in Dublin. We had stayed at the Westbury 8 years ago for 3 nights and loved it then. I still don't believe they greeted us ""Welcome Back to the Westbury!"" These people are good! We had a great room and the service is first class! They could not have been nicer! We will be back!",5,2017,06,01
203,Absolutely Phenomenal,"I have spent a good deal of time in Dublin, and this will hands down be the only place I stay for future trips.  The location cannot be beat, the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, and the accommodations are gorgeous.
",5,2017,05,31
203,Top notch,"Spent two nites at this hotel and were consistently impressed with the top notch level of service at every turn.  The staff shiwed a  genuine welcome and eagerness to serve.The breakfast service was superb, the concierge eager to help and the general staff quick to make calls for us, give suggestions and do whatever would be helpful.  The room was spacious and comfortable.  The location couldn't have been better.",5,2017,05,30
203,Afternoon tea treat,"Afternoon tea is served in the gallery, a bright and spacious area that was so welcoming and relaxing.  Staff are so pleasant, offering suggestions on tea selections.  A children's afternoon tea is also available which is well presented just like the adult version.  The sweet and savoury selections are beautiful to look at and delicious to eat.  I would highly recommend, lovely place to spend a Sunday.",5,2017,05,29
203,Best hen doo afternoon tea EVER!!! ,"As soon as we sat down all 10 of us, we was treated like royalty, the place is amazing everything about this hotel is unreal, they went above and beyond to make you feel comfortable, they made my drink just liked I asked pornstar martini (as I don't eat meat & fish) changed my sandwiches to what I liked, nothing was to much trouble at all, the staff are so nice and polite made us feel really welcome they defo get a 5* from me.... thanks westbury for a great afternoon. ",5,2017,05,29
203,They make you feel like Royalty.,"From the moment we got to the hotel my husband and I felt like we were vip's.  The staff was amazing, friendly, and efficient.  If we had a question we were helped right away and never felt like an inconvenience.  The turn down service was a favorite for me, and the bottle of water was always appreciated.  My husband and I never wanted to leave.",5,2017,05,28
203,Centrally located,"This is one of the better city centre hotels well located for most tourist attractions. 

The rooms are a bit bland and the bathrooms small which is why this review is not rated higher however the hotel is well serviced and the staff helpful. The all inclusive breakfast is decent as is the dining room at first floor level.

The hotel clearly is very busy with visitors from many countries.",4,2017,05,28
203,Great Location,"Hotel is in a great location and within easy walking distance to most attractions.   Hotel itself was very busy with lots of tour groups, a wedding and lots of people from all over in house.  Staff are very friendly and helpful on reception, concierge and in restaurant.  Rooms are nice albeit a bit on the bland side and bathrooms are small and dated.  Rooms at front of hotel could have more noise as closer to Grafton Street.  All in all a decent choice in central Dublin.",4,2017,05,28
203,Wonderful stay,"The staff and food at the Westbury were exceptional.  Their new ""outdoor"" cocktail lounge proved excellent for the mild weather.  Bale's restaurant is an excellent experience for food and outdoors as well.",5,2017,05,27
203,"Beautiful hotel, very friendly and helpful staff","We stayed at the Westbury Hotel for the first two nights of our two week family vacation in Ireland. It was one of only two bathtubs we saw during the entire trip. It was beautiful, comfortable, the staff tried very hard to help us with all manner of questions. They were great, every single person we encountered there. I will definitely stay there again.",5,2017,05,27
203,An oasis of calm and elegance,"Enjoyed a recent impromptu early evening visit to The Westbury Hotel situated in the heart of the city just off Grafton Street. Immaculate service throughout. Drinks in the lounge served by attentive staff. Beautiful meal served in the restaurant in a wonderfully elegant terrace setting. Food and wine spot on, immaculate service. Clearly the team get it right first time here - well done!",5,2017,05,25
203,"Beautiful hotel, treated like Royalty","Everything was great about this hotel except for the fact that the bathroom is tiny. Beautiful smell in rooms, sparkling clean , lovely ambience and very friendly and helpful staff . Fantastic location beside some of the best pubs in Dublin . Very difficult to leave . ",5,2017,05,25
203,Traditional Afternoon Tea - Fantastically Superb!,"Afternoon Tea at the Westbury Hotel was absolutely superb. The experience was so phenomenal from start to finish, including the reservation process. Truly one of the highlights of my 10-day trip to Ireland. They reserved an elegant table for me right next to the windows, so I had a great view of the hustle and bustle of Grafton Street below, and a nice proximity to a very romantic roaring fireplace. Oh so perfect. The service was just so fantastic. I was taken care of by what seemed like a small army of extremely nice and extremely helpful and professional servers. We had such nice little chats. Really a delightful staff. They also made great recommendations of all the great tea options, and I thoroughly enjoyed each tea I tried. You can try as many as you like. The champagne was wonderful and the food was quite excellent. Each tier contained multiple delights; so creatively conceived, fantastically executed, and beautifully presented. It was a perfect, charming, delectable food-tasting adventure. If this is the kind of thing you'd appreciate, then you absolutely must partake. Enjoy!",5,2017,05,24
203,Wonderful hotel,Just off Grafton street and in the middle of everything.  Very upmarket and the staff are delightful and can't do enough.  You can walk to pretty much everything that you want to see.  Although if you don't feel like walking the cabs are frequent and the Irish cabbies are a riot!,5,2017,05,23
203,One of the great Dublin City Centre hotels,"At first I though, maybe not worth it, but once inside the room and sitting on my bed with my nespresso coffee, I knew I was in a great hotel. The bar and lounge area are a must do for those into people watching. The breakfast is just brilliant. The staff were just so helpful and really made this an excellent stay.",5,2017,05,23
203,Gorgeous food,"Visited the Westbury for Lunch last week with a friend. It wasn't very busy and we had the one waitress for the duration of our lunch and drinks. Hopefully it was her first day as service was very bad, given the quality of the food and surroundings it was easy to overlook this, although I would definitely advise management to keep a closer eye on new staff members and ensure that better training is provided before serving.",4,2017,05,23
203,Irish hospitality at its best!,"The service is amazing, friendly and welcoming: Gareth and Sophie at the Front Desk -along with another colleague with a beard, I'm sorry I don't remember his name!-, and Lazaro at the breakfast. Smiling and truly caring about us, nothing was too much trouble. 

The property is beautiful and wonderfully located. No wonder it's part of LHW. The cocktails at the ""Sidecar Bar"" are sublime, all the breakfast choices were delicious... I only wish I could have your Westbury Chicken Curry recipe! 

Thank you for having us, I can't wait to return :)",5,2017,05,23
203,Great stay,"Stayed two weeks ago for a weekend of shopping and cocktails. Great check inn desk, plenty of staff willing to help. Nice clean room with everything you could need. Had a small problem with mini bar, mentioned to reception on passing. Came back to room a few hours later with problem resolved and had a lovely call from the manager Rory the next morning inviting us for breakfast. Lovely gesture. Staff in both bars wer fantastic and attentive. Great location. Looking to fit another trip in soon!",5,2017,05,22
203,Amazing,"From the moment we stopped outside the front door to the moment we left we felt totally special..Amazing staff.Smiling,polite and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble.If you want to spoil yourself then a stay at the Westbury is a must Our room was 439.So quiet..Our breakfast on Sunday morning was something special too.Freshly cooked and served to our table.
Just one little thing that ""rattled"" me was at 9.30am on Sunday morning as we were getting ready to go to breakfast we had a knock on our bedroom door from the housekeeping staff. She came in but apologised and said she would come back later. At 10.40am a knock came to the door again just as we were packing to leave.Yes it was our housekeeping staff again. Check out, i think is 12midday
We are looking forward to going back to the Westbury sometime very soon.
Thank you to everyone.",5,2017,05,22
203,Excellent Service,"I found the staff very friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble!  I always felt welcome and they really did enhance my experience.  Lovely hotel and amenities, and restaurants all great. Location is amazing,",5,2017,05,21
203,Drinks in town,"Called into The Westbury for a drink after a meal across the road in Beeftro last Saturday. There were some classy motors outside when we arrived. It was busy as usual but we got a seat on the terrace. It a relaxing spot for a quiet drink and a chat.
It probably one of the nicest places in Dublin for a drink. And the service and surroundings are five star. ",4,2017,05,19
203,I Cannot Wait to Return,"The mark of a good hotel? You don't want to stay anywhere else.

From the moment we checked in, my family and I, weary from a long day of travel, were made to feel welcome and secure. Our late night reception went flawlessly and a post midnight meal was not only delicious (get that beef stew!) but was brought to our rooms within a half hour of placing the order. 

Rooms were spotlessly clean and laid out to maximize space and comfort. Multiple outlets were available for electronic charging etc. and desk had ample drawer space. Wifi service was excellent. Bed was large, comfortable and linens were immaculate.

Bathroom was laid out well; however my only complaint was the shower head was not extended far enough from the wall, nor is the spray direction adjustable so you literally have to stand over the drain while showering. It's a little awkward. For those with ambulatory/balance issues, also be advised the tub/shower sides are high.

While we only stayed here for 2 nights I have become a huge fan & cannot wait to return. Management should be quite proud of their personnel team, as with any great hotel, true luxury is found in the warmth and competency of the staff. My compliments to all.",5,2017,05,18
203,Business trip,Excellent hotel in the center of Dublin. Nice staff and a nice restaurant. Standard rooms are big enough for a short stay. Good wifi and a Nespresso coffeemaker in the room. Hotel is siutated in an area with a lot of pubs and restaurants.,5,2017,05,18
203,hard to fault,"excellent stay, from the staff to the room very difficult to find fault. Very central but the double glazing kept out any noise
Breakfast exceptional with good coffee ( rare to find) and particularly good chocolate muffins. 
But certainly pricey.",5,2017,05,18
203,Celebrating our engagement!,"Decided to visit the sidecar bar to celebrate our engagement! Everywhere was spotless and all staff were so well presented and friendly. When we told the waitress our news , we were presented with two complimentary glasses of champagne and a plate of chocolates! To follow up the two glasses we had already drank. Very nice touch. Great place to relax and will definitely be returning. ",5,2017,05,16
203,Fabulous but pricey,"This is a really fab hotel. The room was spotless , The bed could have easily fitted 4. Fab food , excellent service throughout our stay. Beautiful surroundings ....I could go on. Can't wait to stay again.",5,2017,05,16
203,What's not to like?,Hard to fault this hotel except perhaps for price. If you like  breakfast you will be in hog heaven here with all the choices and quantity of staff to assist.  Staff is unfailingly friendly and helpful. ,5,2017,05,15
203,"Great Staff, Restaurants, Bar and Rooms!","Great Staff, Restaurants, Bar and Rooms!  Excellent location, great vibe, zero complaints.  We felt safe, welcome and at home.  We stayed here twice within a 2 week period.  I would definitely recommend the Westbury.",5,2017,05,15
203,Truly fantastic exeperience!,"My Mum and I spent the day on the Terrace yesterday to celebrate a birthday.  We visit the hotel regularly and have stayed a number of times.  The hotel is truly 5 star in every way from the luxurious surroundings, to the super super staff.  Every team member has a smile on their face from the concierge we met coming in the front door to the fantastic floor staff on the terrace yesterday :o)  I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a location for special occasion or even a night out, it ticks every box!!!! Thank you Westbury and your fantastic team xxx",5,2017,05,15
203,"Great hotel, great location","We stayed here for a conference and will be back.  We had a deluxe room with breakfast included.  Although not as new and fancy as one might expect in a five star hotel, our room was large and perfect for us.  The breakfast is great, with lots of interesting and well-prepared options.  Most importantly, the service throughout the hotel is impeccable.  Everyone is friendly and helpful.  This is a very well-run hotel.",5,2017,05,12
203,Afternoon coffee,Tipped in on a whim for coffee and a cake having not been in in about 20 years. Very impressed. Beautiful surroundings great service and good coffee and cakes. It could be a regular pitstop. The waiting staff were a true delight to deal with. Friendly yet unobtrusive. I will definitely call in again and possibly try a lunch. I often overlook the Westbury when looking for a coffee or lunch but I won't again. Thoroughly impressive. ,5,2017,05,11
203,Luxury hotel in superb location,"We loved staying at The Westbury, the best hotel in Dublin I would think. It  has a lovely spacious lounge/reception area, nice bar and beautiful decor. Food and drinks and service excellent too.
Huge comfortable bed, spotlessly clean bathroom.",5,2017,05,10
203,Consistent excellent service,"Stayed for a weekend break and were delighted with the hotel.  Unlike most hotel chains, the loyalty scheme with Doyle Collection really makes a difference and they do their utmost to offer an upgrade or something to recognise regular visitors.  The staff in the cocktail bar were exemplary, not many bars offer a small glass of bubbly whilst waiting for your cocktail!",5,2017,05,10
203,Wonderful Stay,"We knew we wanted a place to stay in the center of it all and the Westbury was perfect!  Within walking distance of everything we wanted to do and see.  The hotel is beautiful, the room was very nice, very clean, and up-to-date, while surrounded by a historic feel.  What food we had in the restaurant was good - especially the breakfast.  The hotel staff were incredibly attentive, helpful, and provided amazing customer service!  From the front desk, to the restaurant staff, the bellman, and the indispensable concierge.",5,2017,05,10
203,Attentive but not pretentious,"Just stayed here for three days while on holiday in Ireland.  Was a tad fearful when we pulled up that the hotel would be pretentious because it is fancy.  Could not have been more mistaken.  The service, from every single person we encountered was friendly, kind and ever so helpful.  When we experienced a few hiccups with our room, these were dealt with quickly and graciously.  The location of the hotel is perfect for seeing the sights, and there are lots of good restaurants within easy walking distance.  We got several excellent suggestions for pubs and music, and kind assistance helping us navigate every day.  And the high tea at the hotel was lovely.  Highly recommend the Westbury--it was a great place to stay in every way.",5,2017,05,10
203,The Best Chicken Broth and Noodle Soup,"I called in here - off Grafton Street in Dublin. Fabulous location, fabulous Concierge and a delightful dining/bar where I enjoyed the most delicious chicken broth. I had been told by a well travelled Dublin couple the Westbury does the best Singapore Slings. Something this couple tested out with another place well known for serving this drink. It was a wee bit early for me to have a Singapore Sling however I will return and plan to stay a few nights at what looks to be a wonderful hotel. ",4,2017,05,10
203,pleasant stay,My husband and I stayed here several days for a conference. we were treated with such kindness by the staff and in particular Oisean at the front desk.  The hotel room was clean and quiet and in the perfect area of Dublin to explore- right off Grafton Street. We hope to return! ,5,2017,05,09
203,A birthday stay,"This is definitely a five star hotel and you know it from the moment you book in or in our case drive up and the valet takes your car and your bags are transported in. 
The staff here are just exceptional. We had tea in the beautiful lobby with lovely relaxing music playing and later after coming back from dinner we had cocktails in the gorgeous bar. The bar staff are great fun and were teaching us how to make the drinks. 
Our room was extremely nice, exceptionally clean and had a lovely view over the city. We had breakfast delivered to the room which was delicious and were facilitated with a late check out. 
Just like check in bags were ferried out and our was waiting for us out front with the valet wishing us a safe journey home. All in all a great stay and I am looking forward to coming back again.",5,2017,05,09
203,Sunday afternoon in the Westbury,"We just called in for a coffee and a glass of wine after a day's shopping and we were treated like royalty. Seeing we had a baby in a buggy, the barman from downstairs actually went up onto the first floor to check if there was more room there! The staff upstairs were so friendly and efficient. The staff are a credit not only to the hotel, but also to the city! Washroom facilities were pristine! It was my first visit to the Westbury but hopefully will not be my last!",5,2017,05,09
203,Excellent place to stay when visiting Dublin,"Dublin is best enjoyed by walking around. And The Westbury is located in one of the best vantage locations off the Grafton Street. Grafton Street is a popular walking-around commercial hub. And then Trinity College, St Stephen's Green and Temple Bar are also accessible by walking around. I greatly enjoyed being able to explore Dublin on foot.

Westbury is a luxury hotel with decent amenities. Above all it provides a comfortable ambience to relax.",5,2017,05,08
203,Great location and beautiful hotel,"I love this hotel. The doorman took our car and was so friendly. The receptionist was even better. She discussed our stay at our last hotel and she made conversation with us. She was so pleasant and easy to talk to. 

The location was very good. It right off of Grafton street where all the restaurants and shops are located. The interior was beautifully decorated. The customer service was top notch. The room was clean and decorated very well. I love red chairs and nice pillows to compliment the bed. The coffee station in our room had nespresso machine! I was floored. 

We had a continental breakfast the next morning and it was delicious. The breakfast room was black and white and had feak ivy growing along the wall.. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,05,08
203,"Good location, all else lacking","I paid 300 GBP per night for a mid week stay early May 17. Unfortunately whilst the lobby area feels inviting, the amenities are seriously lacking at this hotel. With poor lighting, old and tired bathroom, average ventilation, and staff that didn't really know too much it was a miserable stay. The reception staff pointed me in the direction of the gym they have a 'deal' with across the street. The 2 euros saved on a one day visit did not feel like a  'deal' to me. Seriously different vibe to what the Westbury is promoting. My second (and last time) at Westbury Dublin.",2,2017,05,08
203,Excellent,"Great stay in the Westbury last weekend. Everything about the stay was what you would want on  trip to Dublin. Food was great, staff friendly and exceptionally helpful. The attention to detail in this hotel is second to none. ",5,2017,05,08
203,Breakfast treat with friends ,"I have met friends in The Westbury a few times over the last couple of months for breakfast and it has been a treat each time. 
We sat at the window seats upstairs but availed of the buffet breakfast in the restaurant for ‚Ç¨15. 
It is a continental breakfast ( variety of breads,cheese, meats, fresh juices, fruit,yogurt, fruits and pastries )with speciality teas and coffees.
The service is quick and friendly, and it's a perfect spot for a chat while watching the world go by. 
",5,2017,05,07
203,Gorgeous hotel with fabulous location,"this is truly a five star hotel-beaituful service, ambiance and the staff is very attentive,  The breakfast was included with our stay and was also very lovey.  The location on right off Grafton Street is really central and so close to everything.  ",5,2017,05,07
203,Wonderful Thanksgiving in Dublin,"My Dubliner (has lived in the states for years) boyfriend and I spent the fourth week of November in Ireland.  The first 3 days in Dublin we stayed at the Westbury.  It was decorated for Christmas, so it was quite beautiful.  The staff was as professional as any I've come across. Everything in the room was nicely done.  The location was perfect--right at the heart of it all.  The drawbacks were: the room was very expensive for how small it was and for some reason, it smelled like fresh cigarette smoke for about a 1/3 of the day.",5,2017,05,04
203,Still the best,"This is one of the best hotels anywhere. Staff are wonderful, welcoming and helpful. Location is excellent. Rooms are beautiful and provide a great nights sleep. Can't wait to return. This hotel is everything you expect of a hotel of this calibre and more. Highly recommended.",5,2017,05,04
203,Lovely afternoon,Spent a few hours here in the company of friends last Monday. We were seated on the small Sun Terrace just off the bar area. What really made the afternoon was the wonderful attention given to us by Deize.  What a wonderful bubbly person whose personality is infectious.  A huge asset to The Westbury. Will definitely return.,5,2017,05,03
203,Top-notch stay in Dublin,"Our stay here in late April was superb.  The check-in team was friendly and helpful - allowing us to check in a bit early after an overnight flight.  The rooms we booked were incredibly comfortable and quiet.  We had an outstanding afternoon tea with champagne that both my mother-in-law and I will remember for many years to come, and the breakfasts at Wilde's were cozy and well cooked.  You can't beat the location and the service was spectacular. ",5,2017,05,02
203,Heaven,"My husband brought me there for our 3rd year  anniversary , have to say I felt like I was in heaven , beautiful place,  quite relaxing  atmosphere, food tasted so good and the portions were big , got a dessert on the house plus two small boxes of chocolate (I'll never forget the good taste of them ) , and the amazing male waiter who gave the best service,  thank you for making our day extra special and will definitely return for my birthday! ",5,2017,05,01
203,Sumptuous and grandiose,"Beautifully placed in Dublin I could not, nor would I want to, find fault with this sumptuous and grandiose Hotel. We experienced evening cocktails in both the lounge area and the bar which were a delight. All the staff were great and it does make a difference in a 5 star hotel. Highly recommend for the experience and the location.",5,2017,05,01
203,A perfect afternoon tea,"Me and my partner had an amazing time. It's very clear that providing a great experience and service is important to everyone we met at the Westbury. We couldn't have asked for a better afternoon, we were incredibly well taken care of. The food was wonderful, beautifully presented and the flavours stood out. The wait staff were always checking in to ensure we had everything, the Ma√Ætre D' was also extremely pleasant. Overall a perfect afternoon, we will be back. Soon. And often!",5,2017,04,30
203,Fantastic weekend,Booked a spontaneous weekend away at the Westbury over the Easter bank holiday  and we were not disapointed. The suite we were given was excellenty and everything we could have wished for. Attentive but discreet staff/service. Just what you would expect from one of the luxury hotels in Dublin...would return in a heartbeat.,5,2017,04,30
203,"Lovely hotel, terrific staff, fabulous restaurants!","The Westbury was recommended to us by friends who have often stayed there, and it was a perfect choice for our family trip to Dublin.  Without exception, all staff went above and beyond to be helpful, even giving our granddaughter a teddy bear! The location is wonderful.  Every meal we had at the Westbury was on point.  The Tea is not to be missed!
Again, The Westbury is one of the finest hotels that we have ever been in, and I wish I could give it six stars!",5,2017,04,28
203,Above and beyond!,The staff go above and beyond to accomodate. The rooms are very clean and offer several luxury items to enhance the overnight experience. I inadvertently left my iPAD in the room and the staff called my mobile to advise they found it before I even realized I left it behind.,5,2017,04,28
203,Engagement,"I don't even know where to begin. I have been to the Westbury many many times, but as a surprise my now husband proposed to me in the Westbury. We had a beautiful suit for an over night stay ready for us. The staff were unbelievable and so helpful in every way for us during this exciting time. My husband also tells me how helpful everyone was during all his planning beforehand too! The Westbury will always hold a very special place in our hearts and look forward to visiting in the near future.",5,2017,04,27
203,Beautiful place and location.,"I've stayed here twice now.  I have stayed in other 5 star hotels in Dublin in the  past and I choose to come back here.  I was traveling with a girlfriend this time and I thought we would have a great time here as it is so centrally located and it is beautiful.  The only thing I would say about my stay this time is that I chose a room with two double beds and it was definitely not like the other rooms I've stayed in before.  It was a family room and pretty basic but it was clean and comfortable. It was in a wing that they probably like families to stay in so they can be loud and run around but that was not our situation.  I did not bring that up to the staff but when paying those prices I really don't think I need to complain   That being said, I still love the hotel and has a really great location.  I will go there again but I will be clear that I am not traveling as a family if that situation comes up again.  Staff very nice, service very good and the High Tea in the lobby is fantastic!",5,2017,04,26
203,Perfect,"The Westbury is now w our favorite hotel in Dublin. Old world elegance with all the modern conveniences.
The rooms are comfortable and spacious.
The staff is very service oriented, friendly and professional.
The food and drinks are terrific.
The location is the most convenient of all the hotels in town.
We will stay here on all future together trips to Dublin.
",5,2017,04,26
203,Afternoon Tea,"Went with friends for afternoon tea last July, food was of excellent standard and based off of NCAD students designs, very impressive. 
The wait staff were very professional in appearance and service. 
Gorgeous room and the china looked like it could be from Tiffany's Jewelers!",4,2017,04,26
203,High Tea,Beautiful hotel located just outside Grafton Street.  We decided to treat ourselves and parents to tea here.  Luxurious with beautiful place settings.  Server was wonderful and wanted us to experience a nice visit. We were celebrating my aunts 50th wedding anniversary and she was treated to a special dessert!,5,2017,04,25
203,Very enjoyable Lunch in the Fine Dining restaurant!,"Had Lunch for two people in the Fine Dining restaurant.The service was top class.The ambience was rich and restful.The food was delicious- in particular the Lamb cutlets and the apple tart and baked Alaska desserts,The decor of the public spaces in the hotel is fabulous.",5,2017,04,24

203,Top Quality Dublin Hotel,"The Westbury is in a quiet location just off Grafton Street and is a perfect location to explore the best of Dublin. The city centre, Temple Bar and Trinity College are all within short walking distance. There are taxis waiting outside that can take you to any sights further afield. The hotel has all the amenities one would expect of one of Dublin's top class hotels. The staff were polite friendly and helpful. We stayed in a deluxe room which was nice and spacious - although the view was nothing to write home about! The breakfast was excellent.",5,2017,04,24
203,Very enjoyable!,"Just home from a 3-night stay here and missing it already! From booking to checkout the staff here were excellent and nothing was too much trouble. The Afternoon Tea was wonderful and we thoroughly enjoyed it! We were lucky enough to have a window table which was really lovely! There was a tiny mix up with our order but this was resolved efficiently and we were more than happy with everything!
Our breakfast experience was also very enjoyable and the service was excellent.

There were a few minor negatives which is why I didn't rate 5/5! The room was a little tired. There were a couple of stains (possibly burn marks) on the carpet, and there were stains/marks on the wallpaper. The lampshade on the standard lamp was a little loose (tilted) and the bottom drawer of the bedside locker was coming apart. There was also a loose handle on one of the dresser drawers. All very minor but not quite up to the 5 star standard we were paying for! I'm sure we could have changed rooms if we'd asked but we were already unpacked and settled by the time we'd noticed and we couldn't face the hassle. On the plus side the beds were extremely comfortable and the housekeeping staff were very good.
The only other little niggle was that I was unable to get a glass of merlot. The barman showed me the one merlot they had, but when I ordered it they realised they'd run out of stock, which was disappointing. But I was offered a nice Malbec instead and the waiter was very apologetic. 
Overall we had a very enjoyable stay, the location the food and the hotel staff were excellent! Looking forward to going back again in the near future, hopefully to a nicer room!",4,2017,04,22
203,Perfect Location,"Excellent room, good Restaurant fine dining, Friendly Staff very attentive in addition to cleanliness of the rooms and Public Toilet in reception...We had a meal in the Restaurant on our last night and the service was very professional and friendly, we would recommend this Hotel for pleasure or Business, the area is full of somewhere to eat and Pubs a plenty, The welcome we received when booking in was very impressive. Highly recommended!",5,2017,04,20
203,Lunch @ The Bar,"We called into the hotel for a quick meal - was fully booked. , however they accommodated us in the bar . This meal was outstanding and the service attentive yet not intrusive.
Would recommend hotel to the discerning traveler visiting Dublin.
Well done and we will be back ....",5,2017,04,20
203,Great hotel in a superb location!,"The Westbury is snuggled away in the perfect location to walk to all the local tourist sites, bars and restaurants.  The staff was friendly and warm. The rooms are spacious and well appointed.  I would highly recommend it on all levels.",5,2017,04,19
203,Family visit,"The Westbury provides wonderful  service to its guests.  Every little  hiccup we had, was delt with quickly and with a little surprise ( cocktails, easter eggs) for any inconvenience. 
Room was on the small size. Beds were comfortable, room service was delicious. 
Location is great for exploring Dublin. Shopping,  dining are right at the doorstep of the Westbury.",4,2017,04,19
203,Favorite Dublin hotel ,I have stayed in the Westbury many times over the last 12 months and each time I am impressed by the welcome I receive from the excellent staff there. They make me feel at home and welcome me professionally every time. The hotel is in a great location to enjoy central Dublin whether on business or pleasure. It's my number one pick for a place to stay every time when I'm in Dublin. Highly recommended. ,5,2017,04,18
203,"Great cocktails, great staffüôÇ",Been here for drinks in the sidebar and have to say had a great night. Great cocktails too.. suits everyone's taste... not only that but the servers were friendly and engaging.. Iva our server only had a smile on her face and Deize was always on hand for anything we needed very attentive... will be backüôÇ,5,2017,04,18
203,Loved The Westbury!,"Service is what sets The Westbury apart. The Westbury staff are just extremely friendly and attentive to all your needs. I can't say enough as to how pleased I was with my stay at this hotel. 5 Star service starts the minute you drive up. If your visiting Dublin, look no further, this is where you need to stay!",5,2017,04,18
203,The Westbury in Spring Sunshine,"We had the pleasure of spending a lovely weekend at The Westbury in early April. 
Right from arriving The Westbury did the small things well. The doorman was friendly, helpful, the reception staff were courteous & professional. 
Our room was comfortable, spotlessly clean etc. but those are things you would expect from a hotel of this class. 
The location of The Westbury is absolutely superb. It is a huge selling point. Our room overlooked Grafton Street, full of life, full of colour! Those rooms may need triple glazing lol as the street life is loud, music to the early hours. 
We had breakfast included and it was reflective of the hotel. Food was great, huge selection, sumptuous in fact. 
The location is definitely a huge selling point but the staff, for us, were the reason why we look forward to going back to The Westbury. ",5,2017,04,18
203,Deserves its rating!,"Really nice hotel in a great location - near enough to have easy access to the shops, bars, restaurants and attractions in the centre of the city but still quietly situated as it is tucked away down a side street. Rooms very comfortable, staff very helpful. A special mention should go to Benedita at check-in. I stay in a lot of hotels and get used to the fairly mundane procedures you have to go through, so it takes quite a lot for a check-in process to stand out - but Benedita's helpful and friendly approach was excellent and really welcoming. They even managed to find a room well before the official check-in time. I'd thoroughly recommend this hotel, it deserves its high rating!",5,2017,04,17
203,I had not been in such a lovely hotel for a long time!,"We spent one evening and night at the Westbury -- arriving at 3 pm and leaving the next morning at 9 am -- and absolutely loved this hotel.  From the start, the staff greeted us with a big smile and was attentive to our needs.  The hotel is absolutely wonderful in everything: elegant, charming, with spacious rooms and great bathrooms.  The location of the hotel is perfect: smack in the center of Dublin, near Trinity College and the shoppinf streets. I had not felt that way in a hotel. I would strongly recommend it to everybody and look forward to going back!",5,2017,04,16
203,Great location,"This hotel is in a great location, just off Grafton street. Within a 20 minute walk you can cover may points of interest. This hotel is not cheap, however, it seems all of Dublin hotel prices are going up. The breakfast is done very well with an excellent variety and quality of produce.",5,2017,04,14
203,Now this is what a 5 star hotel should look like,"Stayed here while attending a concert in Dublin. 

Fabulous location, great concierge service.

Had a delicious whiskey sour in The Sidecar bar. Impeccable service.

The rooms are clean and spacious, the bed and bed linen is like sleeping in a little cloud. Fabulous toiletries and face cloths! And a turn down service, haven't seen one of those in a while.

Every part of the hotel we visited was sparkling. 

The breakfast room is gorgeous. The only thing that let our stay down was that while breakfast was good it wasn't fantastic, I have seen better breakfast buffets, plenty of fresh fruit but very few seeds and where were the stewed prunes? Hotel breakfast is not hotel breakfast without a few prunes! My husband said the only thing on his full Irish breakfast freshly cooked was the egg, the bacon and sausages had been sitting in a heated dish a bit too long and were dried out. Tea and coffee were copious and very good.",5,2017,04,12
203,A weekend treat...,"I wanted to organise a little treat for my mammy, just because she is so amazing and decided it had to be The Westbury...and what a perfect weekend treat it was. The hotel itself is perfectly located for a ramble around the shops and close to the theatres.  From when I made my enquiry, right through to departure we were impressed with all the staff we encountered and could not have asked for more.  In particular, Sophie on reception and Kevin on the door, both of which went out of their way. So friendly and helpful, and genuine.  We were waiting on by a lovely young waiter while we ordered our coctails, unfortnately, I cannot remember his name.  All in all, wonderful few days and we look forward to coming back again...",5,2017,04,12
203,Lovely hotel and fabulous staff!,"We stayed here recently for my wife's birthday,  great location off Grafton street, we had a delightful breakfast and afternoon tea. The staff are great , Adrian and Daniel at the bar looked after us superbly and provided some complimentary prosecco and a birthday plate , she had an amazing night!",5,2017,04,11
203,Warm lux hotel and excellent location,"My first time in Dublin for a long weekend. Location is perfect right near Grafton and other spots in the city center.
The room - superior king size with city view - was perfect and very well treated daily.
Staff - reception, restaurants, concierge - always very friendly, attentive and kind.
Daily breakfast and Saturday brunch were perfect.",5,2017,04,11
203,"DUBLIN - THE BEST 5 STAR HOTEL TO STAY "" THE WESTBURY""","I recently made a quick business trip to Dublin, Ireland.
Since it was a transatlantic trip and I was only visiting for 3 days, i decided to stay in a grand hotel.
My online search shortlisted three 5 star hotels to stay in. After an in depth review of all the hotels, I decided to stay at The Westbury which already had some pretty good reviews.

The reasons for my stay at The Westbury were:

1. Location- believe me it's everything! Everything in Dublin is within walking distance!

2. Clean and newly refurbrished bathrooms.

3. large spacious rooms- the larger the better.. The Westbury's rooms are twice the size of a normal hotel room!

4. Service with a smile.

5. The General manager responded to every review of his hotel online.- It shows that he cares.

Gotta say my choice was spot on and I was really comfortable during my stay.
Now I do spend a lot of time travelling and only write reviews about hotels that really impress me. 

What really impressed me about The Westbury is the service. Right from the front door, to the lobby/ reception to the housekeeping - everyone knows your name and you are always greeted with the famed Irish warmth.

The security manager at night is also more than willing to have a chat about the best and safest nigh spots etc 

The hotel is also frequented by celebrities and I happened to see Louis Walsh pull up in a black G wagon.

The bar on the left of the front door is also a great spot when the weather is good and as usual the service was impecable.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin!",5,2017,04,11
203,Very good all round,Hotel has an excellent location and most everything else is very well done. The Art Deco cocktail bar was a delight and the service excellent. One gripe is that the bathroom did not have a separate shower which is not what I expected at this level of hotel.,4,2017,04,11
203,Nice hotel and great location,I have stayed at the Westbury many times and it never disappoints.  The location is great for Dublin - right on Grafton Street so getting to anything and everything is pretty simple.  Rooms are nice and the restaurants all serve good food - albeit a bit pricey.  ,5,2017,04,10
203,Fantastic ,"Regularly go to this bar for drinks! Fantastic atmosphere, staff and surroundings! Sidecar bar is a must for a drink while in Dublin. Gins are exceptional. Thanks to everyone who works here. Will be back again.

",5,2017,04,09
203,BEST LOCATION FOR A LUX HOTEL WITH A SOUL,"I recently stayed at The Westbury on a visit Business Trip to visit Google. I normally stay at Luxury Hotels but tend to lean on the modern or hip. At my recent stay , what I loved about The Westbury is that even though it was a traditional luxury hotel , the employees and charecter of the Hotel has Soul . The location is ideal especially if you love to shop and explore Dublin for the first time. Its a walkers heaven. Every monring , I found myself looking forward to breakfast and on my way back from work , the BAR, had the best drinks and staff. I often found myself having a snack at the street level restaurant. The Concierge Staff was very knowledgable and hats off to them , for getting me a res at a top restaurant. THANKS EDDIE.",5,2017,04,09
203,Location location,"Staff are really fantastic here. Wonderful place for people watching and lounging around. We upgraded to a bigger room but wouldn't bother if I was staying again. Rooms are fine but bathroom was disappointing for 5 star. Would expect standalone shower rather than shower in bath format. We'd problems with our shower and the cistern which only became apparent the morning we were checking out. Brought it to the girls attention on departure but didn't get much of an apology. Again, disappointing for the price we paid. On the positive side, we loved the hotel, breakfast was fab and drinks when we came back to the hotel were great in the sidecar bar, Location is fantastic.",4,2017,04,09
203,The BEST breakfast!,"Fantastic, beautiful hotel with friendly knowledgeable staff (Eddie the concierge was particularly helpful). 
Lovely rooms and great location.
The breakfast was the best I have ever had and served until 11 which allowed for a lie in.
Cannot recommend this gorgeous hotel enough.",5,2017,04,09
203,Dublin Gem in City Centre,"The Westbury Hotel was the perfect place to land on our first trip to Dublin - casually elegant, friendly, relaxing and within walking distance of everything.  The  room  was spacious for our family of three, clean and fresh and tastefully appointed.  Everything about our stay was wonderful and I would highly recommend it.",5,2017,04,09
203,we were tempted to not leave the hotel!,"Second time staying in this beautiful hotel (we came from Scotland). Rooms are spacious and well appointed with small seating area and so comfortable that we ended up sitting chatting in the for a few hours each evening before heading out (we were two mothers and daughters). We were very pleasantly surprised with the arrival of complimentary wine and petti fours (I'd mentioned it was a special occasion). The breakfast is second to none and as well as a very tastefully set out buffet of fruity she, cereals, lovely brown soda bread etc you could have many things cooked to order. I was delighted with porridge made with almond milk, others with the eggs royale. The concierge Eddie couldn't have been more helpful with offers of assistance or tips on where to go. The main bar in the hotel and the more casual modern bistro Balfe are worth a visit. You really wouldn't need to step outside the door but if you do shops are 30 seconds away.",5,2017,04,09
203,Comfortable stay,"We enjoyed our stay. The entrance and common areas as well as bar areas are all beautiful. A bit on the expensive side for food and drinks but it is expected at a hotel. You will get far better value around the corner at one of the many pubs. The staff were very friendly and the doormen/porters are fantastic. Always smiling and full of advise. The room itself was a bit disappointing.  Not what you would expect for the price. We stayed in the king superior suite and I have stayed in far better. The bed was great, comfortable and big, they could offer a selection of pillows in the room but don't. There was some maintenance being done in the room next door to us which was noisy but only for about an hour or so. The room itself is rather basic, there was a coffee machine but there was no water in the machine or operating instructions so we just went downstairs and paid for coffee. The breakfast was a 8/10 and again the staff were great. I would recommend the hotel based on the staff and the bed. The rest is ok. ",4,2017,04,08
203,Birthday stay,"Have been to the Westbury on a couple of occasions.
We visited again on Sunday April 2nd. 2017 for a birthday celebration.
My children flew over from UK and we had a brilliant time.
I had one issue at the hotel, which was handled very professionally and efficiently.
The hotel staff were wonderful, the service impeccable ,and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, as we always do. The Westbury thoroughly deserves it's 5 star rating, and we will continue to stay there when we visit Dublin.",5,2017,04,08
203,Very comfortable hotel in a great location,"Booked a superior room, but bathroom very small and pressure on shower very poor. Complained, and was upgraded to a deluxe room. This room vastly improved with better furnishings and a far larger bathroom. Shower pressure still poor, and faulty kettle and hair dryer. These problems were all fixed very quickly and credit to the staff for acting so promptly. Very good cocktail bar, brasserie, and fine dining restaurant. Excellent staff and hotel in a perfect location for all amenities.",5,2017,04,08
203,Fabulous as always,My friend and I retuned to the Westbury after a five year gap and it felt like coming home. Everything was perfect and the beds were so comfortable we are both going to order the same mattress for our own beds. The breakfast was excellent and catered for every dietary requirement.. Thank you to everyone at the Westbury for making us so welcome and once again making our short stay so enjoyable. ,5,2017,04,08
203,Superior 5 star hotel in the best location in Dublin.,"We have previously stayed in the Merrion and Shelbourne and they are both superb hotels. However, the Westbury is every bit their equal but also is in the very best location in Dublin. Steps outside the hotel are fine restaurants, shops and welcoming pubs. It is a vibrant, popular part of town that you will surely visit. What better than to stay in the heart of it? It is now our preferred hotel in Dublin and we will be back again and again.",5,2017,04,06
203,Beautiful few days in Dublin,"Myself and my fianc√©e stayed at The Westbury for 2 nights, the hotel is outstanding. Lovely welcome on arrival, as soon as you walk through the doors the hotel has a wow factor. The decor in the hotel is beautiful. All staff were professional & friendly. We had cocktails both nights before dinner, would recommend drinks in the bar area, the atmosphere is very relaxing. If you are looking to stay in Dublin for a special occasion or a romantic night away, I would recommend The Westbury. The hotel is close to shops, pubs & restaurants, all in walking distance. We will most defiantly return, thank you for a lovely couple of days! ",5,2017,04,05
203,The place to stay,"Very well located in Balfe Street , this is the place to stay in Dublin. 
The staff were all very friendly and anxious to ensure our needs were catered to. 
Highly recommended if you re traveling with your couple.",5,2017,04,05
203,Awesome stay,"We checked in early and they gave us a ""resting room"".  It was full usage of a smaller room until our room was ready later that afternoon.  I have NEVER experienced such a GREAT perk.  Made our trip off to a great start!!",5,2017,04,04
203,Irish style of luxury,"Frankly speaking we have chosen The Westbury as it seemed to be the closest place to Phil Lynott statue. Upon arriving we found out that the statue has been broken by car months ago and removed for repair. 
So, there were no other opportunities but to enjoy the hotel facilities. And we did. 
Maybe the place itself looked too luxurious for just the rock n roll travelers but finally it worth staying there: just only Irish coffee at the lobby made us forget of everything else. Everything else in Ireland means both Guinness and Jameson: there are two pubs located within arm reach. For something very local there is Sheehan‚Äôs Pub just around the corner with delicious Irish stew (a special review will be followed).
There are at least three restaurants in The Westbury. Obviously for those who visited all of them the big sofas are placed almost everywhere: in an elevator and in the halls on every floor. A weary traveler could find a rest there having not reached his room. Late in the evening we saw a guy sleeping as a child on the corner sofa on the fourth floor and having holdall in his arms. But no needs to avoid a bed in the room: it turned out to very and very comfortable. As well as all other amenities.
A gym is for the health fans but not for us at that time. Please return Phil Lynott as soon as possible and we will be back for sure.",5,2017,04,04
203,Leisure,"We had a wonderful stay in the Westbury on Saturday night. This is our second visit and we plan to make it an annual event. What makes it enjoyable is the lovely welcome, great ambience and excellent staff in particular Deize & Joseph. We had dinner in Wilde and it was really delicious as was breakfast. We will be back again next year for our 3rd visit!
Mary",5,2017,04,03
203,One night only,"I stayed here last night. 

I love this hotel. Great rooms. Great service. Great location. 

Centered in the heart of Dublin City, you are but a moment's stroll from Grafton Street,  St Stephen's Green and St Stephen's Green Shopping Centre. 

I highly recommend it. 

Stay here. ",5,2017,04,03
203,"Love, love, love this hotel! :-)","We spent 3 nights at this fabulous hotel. Super, friendly staff. Bedroom and bathroom both very comfortable with everything you need for a stay. Our breakfast was included and what a delicious treat that was every morning!  They also have a gorgeous bar serving amazing cocktails.  The location is perfect to walk about the city.",5,2017,03,31
203,Afternoon tea at it's finest!,"Returned on my yearly March trip with my daughter, had afternoon tea at a few other venues in Dublin, but The Westbury is by far the nicest place to enjoy it, the food, service, location and general ambiance are just superb. Will look forward to returning again.",5,2017,03,31
203,Wonderful afternoon tea,"We enjoyed a superb afternoon tea in beautiful surroundings served by attentive, polite staff.Although the room was full, it did not feel in the least bit crowded. The atmosphere was warm, friendly and very pleasant.",5,2017,03,31
203,Excellent,"My husband and I stayed here a week.  This hotel is superb in every way.  The breakfast is amazing.  It is centrally located and you feel as if you are in a little village.  The high tea is something that you have to experience.  You feel as if you are royalty.  Everybody is friendly, upbeat and extremely helpful.  The food is simply wonderful.  The rooms are outstanding -- quiet, comfy beds and very comfortable rooms.  I wish that I could live here!!!!!",5,2017,03,30
203,Superior,"Thank you for another wonderful stay.  Superior customer service and accommodation.  This hotel Is beautiful, clean, and perfectly located. The service is always excellent.  Helpful and informed staff.  The restaurants are wonderful as well.  This is our family's favourite hotel. ",5,2017,03,30
203,One night stay ,"The Westbury is ideally located for shopping in Dublin based right in the heart of the city.

The hotel common areas are beautifully presented and the staff are very pleasant.

We didn't have food in the hotel but the afternoon tea area is lovely and if you were lucky to get a window seat you could people watch for hours.

We had booked a twin room and were given a double. Didn't matter much as friends we are used to sharing on trips away but no doubt this would be an issue to some people. We didn't complain about it.

Rooms are a good size and well presented however I think the 5 star rating relates more to the rest of the hotel than the rooms themselves. ",4,2017,03,29
203,Wonderful hotel,"Stayed for 3 nights during St. Patrick's Day festivities.
Upon entering the Westbury, it is dazzling. The staff are friendly, helpful and pleasant. Our room was clean, spacious and the beds were very comfortable. Exercise room is very small, but adequate. We had late night drinks outdoors at Balfe's several times. A person I assumed to be homeless wandered in and the waiter treated him very kindly and respectfully when asking him to leave. I saw this type of kindness a few more times in Dublin and Cork City and was touched and impressed. Also had drinks at the Side Car inside the hotel. I ordered a fancy cocktail. The others in my party were served their drinks and I was given a complimentary glass of Prosecco while waiting for my cocktail. The Westbury location is also excellent. Would love to stay there again.",5,2017,03,28
203,Unrivalled client service,I returned to The Westbury last week having chosen it due to the attentive staff. Second time round was just as good. The front desk staff (Alexandra and Sophie) are particularly welcoming and nothing is too much trouble. A very professionally run hotel.,5,2017,03,28
203,Amazing place to stay,"My husband and I have just stayed there for 4 days. 
Having had a very unpleasant experience on Tuesday, we can not rate the staff highly enough.

Joseph Downing was amazing. Taking care to ensure we were managing our shock and reassuring us that Dublin was a nice city and we shouldn't go home, which is what I wanted to do, but stay and make good memories. He was absolutely right.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure we were okay and had everything we needed.
Even staff who were unaware of our situation were attentive, remembering what drinks you enjoyed and where you liked to sit in the restaurant.

I will definitely be recommending it to friends and family and hope to return at some point in the not too distant future.",5,2017,03,27
203,Another superb afternoon tea,"Had booked a few weeks ago as knew it would be busy for Mothers Day and very glad I did ; obviously others didn't and were disappointed 
Warmly greeted asked what occasion was - Mother's Day and a birthday
Table just not ready but we were early-tired from too much shopping!!- but weren't kept waiting too long
Menu explained Champagne poured and then the food arrived which was exquisite  as always! And a birthday slice to boot! Advised table required in 2 hours but never hurried and always kept a discreet eye on things despite being very busy!
Always love the Westbury buzz and it never fails to disappoint us",5,2017,03,26
203,A Great Place For Brunch,This is a elegant hotel located in the heart of the city. We were there for brunch and the service was excellent! The food was very good and it tasted very fresh.The seating in the restaurant lounge area was very comfortable and airy. It had a nice street view from the large glass windows as well.,4,2017,03,25
203,Outstanding Dublin Hotel in Great Location,We booked a prepaid stay for five nights at the Westbury and we were not disappointed in any way.  The staff and service are absolutely first class and they expressed a real concern for our satisfaction.  The hotel is conveniently located so that you can walk to most of Dublin's attractions.  In every way they exceeded our expectations.  I highly recommend the booking with breakfast included as it was a world class breakfast experience which was a great start to every day.  We would definitely return here on our next visit to Dublin.,5,2017,03,25
203,Amazing Experience,"Wonderful customer service. Fantastic location in heart of Dublin.  Stayed here March 2017 didn't expect much but was pleasantly surprised! Sophie at front desk was a superstar. Took personal care of us and went above and beyond the call of duty.  Even helped us book things at another hotel!

Location is perfect! Even in the rain you can walk everywhere.",5,2017,03,24
203,An Awesome Experience Awaits,"A breathtakingly Beautiful hotel, perfectly situated in the heart of Dublin.  Immaculate, modern yet with character.  It even has a bench in the elevator .. and mirrors of course.  Bathroom has a scale too and great amanities.  The bed is ultra comfortable ... U don't want to get out of it.

I loved this hotel although it seems to cater to a more conservative, mature crowd.  But it's elegance n warmth of the staff dissipates any sign of ""stuffiness"".  I highly recommend it ... plus, it is so close to all things Dublin ... It is certainly worth a visit.  Enjoy!",5,2017,03,24
203,Great luxuary hotel in the middle of Dublin,"Really liked staying at this hotel - great atmosphere, great service and clean rooms. Unfortunately right outside my window was an AC unit which caused a constant noise. Otherwise no complaints. Would come back again.",4,2017,03,24
203,What every 5 star hotel should be...,"My wife and I stayed here back in Feb. What a hotel!! The staff were amazing, the building was amazing, the food was amazing, the bed was amazing, the room was amazing. As you can guess, we had an amazing time. The hotel is located fantastically. Right in the centre. Easy to walk anywhere. Great restaurants on your doorstep. But make sure you book on a Friday or Saturday night. Very busy everywhere.

The breakfast and the restaurant setting was the icing on the cake for us. Just perfect.

Cannot wait to go back again.",5,2017,03,24
203,Salubrious dining,"Had a grand breakfast in this luxury hotel in the centre of Dublin.  There is a fine choice of continental and traditional Irish.

The whole atmosphere was welcoming and pleasant. The staff were lovely throughout, helpful and cheerful. 

A marvellous opening to the day.",5,2017,03,23
203,As Good As It Gets,"Stayed here last week and the hotel was just superb, From the moment we pulled the car up to the front of the hotel to the moment we left everything was 5 star. We were greeted with a huge smile by the front of hotel staff who took care of the car and our luggage. Up the steps to reception and greeted by reception staff that make you feel so welcome. Thank You Caroline. We had contacted the hotel prior to the stay and the reason we were staying was a treat for our wedding anniversary. Nice surprise for my wife. Out came Lucia to wish us well and grant us a wonderful upgrade. The room was huge, Beyond our expectations. Large bathroom with wonderful powerful shower. Every mod con and amenity needed was in the room. Lovely turn down treat in the room when we returned after the show we attended finished. Breakfast was included and was also top notch. We've stayed in many 5 star properties throughout the world and The Westbury compares to any. We were genuinely sad to leave but already looking forward to our next stay in October for My wife's birthday. Big shout out to Anne and Andrea who helped us with the booking. I'll be in contact soon. Thanks Again.",5,2017,03,22
203,A  truly 5 star hotel,"My wife and I had a four night stay (it was a xmas present from our son ) he could not have plcked a better hotel in Dublin, the staff through out the hotel were first class in all areas . They did their utmost to make our stay most pleasurable.",5,2017,03,20
203,Beautiful and sophisticated! Great location!,"My husband and I stayed at the Westbury on two different weekends in early March (a total of 5 nights....when we arrived in Dublin and on the weekend we departed from Dublin).  Excellent, 5 star hotel!  First of all, we arrived from an international flight very early in the morning (6AM), and our room was ready, and we were able to check in and sleep for 5 hours before our sight-seeing began. The staff is helpful and professional, attentive to every detail.  The room was immaculate with high-end finishes, comfortable beds and linens, good lighting for makeup and for reading,  and very good shampoo and lotions.  The hotel is located right off of Grafton Street, so very central with good shopping and in a safe area.  Quiet, considering we were in a bustling city! Also, we loved highly the wonderful Irish breakfast (included in our rate), afternoon tea, and even dinner all right in the hotel.  The final praise I offer is that the hotel staff is also very honest.  Upon check-out, I accidentally left my iPad  on the counter and departed for the airport.  I was not aware of this until I went through security at the airport.  I was able to call the front desk from the Aer Lingus lounge, and they had the iPad and were able to mail it to me.  I had it back in my possession within 5 days of departing.  Above and beyond personal care and attention! Overall, this hotel, which is sophisticated and beautiful, more than deserves the 5 star rating!",5,2017,03,19
203,"Fantastic Local Spot! Not cheap, but well worth it.","This was the 2nd time we have stayed at this hotel and it did not disappoint. The hotel is clean and in a great location for shopping, dining and all of central Dublin. The full Irish breakfast is awesome!
Front facing rooms have a nice view of the surrounding neighborhood and the in-room coffee is very good.
While it is not inexpensive, I recommend it highly!",5,2017,03,19
203,Fantastic Place to Stay,"The hotel was great, perfect location and very good staff and rooms. Would highly recommend for anyone looking to stay in the centre of Dublin. Breakfast was especially great. Looking forward to returning one day soon. ",5,2017,03,19
203,Away from the hustle ,Very relaxing and great location just off Grafton street. Upmarket yet upbeat and the service is great. Had just a few drinks but the menu looks great. It's more expensive but not for the location and if your out for a celebration definitely a must. ,5,2017,03,17
203,very nice hotel,a very nice hotel and service... all was perfect... the hotel is big and friendly... i will go there again for business for sure. i liked the bar and restaurant for breakfast... The staff is perfect like a palace,5,2017,03,17
203,A wonderful place for morning tea,"On a recent visit to Dublin I called in at the Westbury for morning tea - it was a delightful break from shopping.  I only wanted a pot of tea and a sit down however I enjoyed not just my tea but some delicious Danish pastries, friendly and efficient service, an exceedingly comfortable seat, peaceful surroundings all of which evoked a sense of well being and sent me on my way rejoicing!   (I've rated 'sleep quality a 5 based on a previous stay a number of years ago)",5,2017,03,16
203,Excellent Service,"I had afternoon tea in The Westbury recently (18th March) for a special family event. It was my first time in the hotel and the most memorable experience was the customer service. The staff were phenomenal.  They made the experience for my family and I. 

We received plenty of tea, sandwiches, cakes and scones. I would recommend it for afternoon tea or even simply drinks.",5,2017,03,15
203,"Beautiful hotel, exceptional service","The Westbury is a beautiful hotel with attentive, friendly and knowledgeable staff.  They helped connect us to whatever we needed.  The location cannot be beat.  It was very clean and beautifully decorated.  ",5,2017,03,15
203,Overnight Stay at Westbury,Excellent Loaction in Dublin. Staff could not be nicer. Room was a bit small and perhaps starting to date a little. But this was made up for by the pleasentness of all staff we encountered during our stay. ,5,2017,03,14
203,Lovely hotel ,"Room was great, lots of nice touches, I did not use the bar or resturant as there is plenty of local authentic (and cheeper) alternatives right on the doorstep.  Location is awesome!
Very helpful staff.
On the high end of the price range, but not offensively so. ",4,2017,03,14
203,As you would expect a 5 star hotel to be!(except breakfast NOT included),"Stunning hotel in the heart of everything Dublin is about.Friendly and efficient staff and nice touches with turn down etc.VERY disappointed that given the high cost of the stay that no breakfast included.Specially as relative to the room rate,this would not break the bank to include!!",4,2017,03,13
203,Birthday cocktails ,Fabulous birthday evening in Balfes bar. Cocktails were outstanding with very friendly and efficient bar staff- can recommend the Manhattan cocktail however there is a wide range to suit all tastes ü§óüç∏üòâ,5,2017,03,13
203,Birthday celebration,"Just got back from a 3 night stay at the westbury hotel Dublin...what a beautiful hotel...the attention to detail is what makes this hotel..every member of staff we came into contact with were genuinely happy to help you,from the ladies cleaning the rooms to the restaurant staff!
We had breakfast whilst we were there and let me tell you it was delicious,nothing was too much trouble,everything cooked to order!Then lastly the LOCATION...most places were in walking distance..well done westbury will most definitely be returning",5,2017,03,13
203,Best thing about the Westbury Hotel Dublin - the people who work there,"My friend & I shared a twin room at the Westbury on Friday night.  Although we were only in Dublin for one night it was fabulous to be right in the middle of town but in an oasis of calm.  We held some of our business meetings in The Gallery coffee bar during the day and we also had a couple of friends join us on Saturday morning for a leisurely breakfast.

The Westbury is blessed with the friendliest staff of any hotel & it was worth the price for the comfort, convenience and general pampering received.",5,2017,03,13
203,Afternoon Tea - Wonderful Experience.,"We visited The Westbury hotel in Dublin for afternoon tea to celebrate my wife's 40th birthday in March 2017.

The whole experience was wonderful, from arriving, to the food and coffee it was all absolutely 1st class! 

The staff were so helpful and explained the menu in fine detail and could not do enough - constantly offering more tea and coffees. 

In all a great experience and would recommend this to anyone looking a real luxury treat.",5,2017,03,13
203,Faultless,"From the moment we arrived until the time we left I have to say our stay was faultless. All the staff we came across were very friendly and polite, the room was lovely and breakfast was great. We look forward to returning soon!",5,2017,03,08
203,The Royal Treatment,"We received The Royal Treatment as passing guests at the Westbury last night and I'd like to express my gratitude and pay my compliments to the staff.... It was my daughter's 6th birthday and we decided to pop into The Westbury for a fancy drink on the way to a show.. Upon arrival we received a warm greeting from the host and were chaperoned to a beautiful table upstairs.. In passing, I mentioned to the host that it was my daughter's 6th birthday.. he must have clocked her name when I was speaking to her because shortly after being seated, they brought out a little cake with her name on it!.. The staff made a real fuss over her and even gave her a beautiful coloring book and pencils too.. She was thrilled!.. Although our stay was brief, The Westbury was a Great Escape!

Thanks,

Robbie",5,2017,03,08
203,Stay at westbury,"The hotel is spectacular, staff are superb. They have meet all our requests. There are works beside our room, and the hotel staff moved us and upgraded to a brilliant room. Food in bistro and service excellent. Location is very near Temple Bar area. This is probably the best hotel experience my wife and I have experienced in 30 years of travel.",5,2017,03,08
203,Wonderful Westbury.,"Returning to this hotel yet again and loved the whole experience from booking to check out. The staff are so friendly and eager to please, the beds are so comfortable, the rooms are so clean and elegant. As for the cocktails....well I aim to work my way through the cocktail list in my next few stays. üòÑüçπI will be back soon. ",5,2017,03,07
203,Christmas disappointment,"We stayed here for Christmas . This involved staying Christmas eve and Christmas night. Having passed by the westbury during the festive season many times it was something I had always dreamed of and this year the dream was to become a reality. 

The checking in was exciting and the concierge staff were incredibly welcoming. There was such a buzz around the place and the decorations were really stunning. 

That is where the festivities ended. Prior to our visit, when booking I had liased with the 'christmas coordinator' and had been assured that there would be a real festive theme.  I can't help wonder what this person spent their hours coordinating as had it not been for the decorations there was not one iota of Christmas cheer in this hotel. Considering the exorbitant prices charged, a simple complimentary glass of mulled wine or dare I suggest they stretch to a mince pie....would not have gone astray. 

A beautiful piano in the gorgeous lounge lay idle and we couldn't help but wonder how lovely it would have been to have someone play christmas music, or even a small choir for some part of christmas eve or Christmas day, instead of the modern futuristic non-Christmas music which were piped through the public areas. It was quite frankly, depressing. Christmas morning breakfast was the low point. 

The absolute ridiculous price for Christmas dinner is something I won't even get into as I know it's the same in most hotels but to not include wine is just a disgrace. When I questioned the price of dinner to the person I was booking with in reservations she retorted ""you do realize this is a 5-star hotel?"". At that point I should have ran for the hills. 

The room was bog standard. I've stayed in more luxurious 4 star hotels many times. I would expect a twin room in a 5 star hotel to have two queen or small double beds. I hadn't slept in a single bed since my childhood so in that way and it reminded me of childhood Christmases at least!!

I have spent christmas in a 5star hotel in Cork city I won't name and there was absolutely no comparison. They are world's apart .....there we had open fires, mince pies and  mulled wine on tap, a Christmas tree in our bedroom, homely chats with the owner/manager, fireside christmas Carol singalongs with the other residents, a Christmas storytelling night...I could go on. 

My advice to the westbury would be to look around at what other hotels are offering , and to hire a Christmas coordinator who does celebrate Christmas (?). 

At least I have popped my Westbury cherry and I no longer look longingly at it when passing as I know now it is all just a facade beyond which lies a soulless mecca for irelands z list celebs. They flock in their droves and are possibly the hotels bread and butter, as regular Joe soaps like myself are invisible and inconsequential to the hotel. 
And for that reason I'm out. ",2,2017,03,07
203,Great cocktails!,"Met up with friends who we hadn't seen in a while. So we had a few drinks in the bar. Was very relaxed. Staff were very friendly and professional. They had extensive knowledge of the cocktail menu. The cocktails took a while to make but they were worth every second. 

Did I mention you get a free glass of prosecco  while you wait. Which was a very nice touch. 

Thank you for a great evening. ",5,2017,03,07
203,Celebratory cocktails,"We had ad a fantastic experience at The Westbury Hotel. We went in for cocktails to celebrate our sisters birthday and the service was first class. When we mentioned we were in Dublin to celebrate our sisters birthday the very pleasant server provided complimentary prosecco for the entire party of seven and a celebratory cake for the birthday girl. It goes without sayin that the cocktails were the most fantastic we've ever tasted. every member of staff we came across greeted us with a smile and were so pleasant and helpful, they really made our experience very special. If you are looking for somewhere special you won't go wrong with The Westbury, we'll definitely be back.",5,2017,03,07
203,Special treat,"Stayed in the hotel as an anniversary and birthday treat.  Could not have been better, magnificent hotel, fabulous staff a real treat.  One weekend in the Westbury is better than 4 weekends anywhere else!!! cant wait to return",5,2017,03,07
203,Top Shelf!,"I've traveled world wide for business and for pleasure. Staying in many 5 star fine hotels and resorts. The Westbury in Dublin gave me the ""Best"" customer service experience I've ever had. Highly recommended. *****",5,2017,03,06
203,Dublin stay at the Westbury,"From the moment we arrived at the Westbury we were greeted by friendly and very helpful staff. The reception staff  were so keen to make our stay was relaxing and enjoyable. Each time we entered and left the building the concierge on the door were very friendly and chatty. 

We would not hesitate to use the Westbury again. ",5,2017,03,05
203,Art Deco style 5 star Hotel in Dublin centre,"Art Deco style interior design hotel in the heart of Dublin city. Regarded as one of the most prestigious hotels in Dublin, the hotel has some very pleasant restaurants and a good bar upstairs. It is also one of the most expensive.",4,2017,03,05
203,Beautiful hotel and excellent service.,We actually were lucky enough to stay here twice recently whilst on business in Ireland. The hotel is very busy and the service is excellent. Beds comfortable and rooms spacious and quiet. Close to shopping street and easy to walk out yo bars and restaurants. Will definitely choose this hotel when visiting Dublin.,5,2017,03,05
203,Beautiful hotel,"Where to start.  First try drinks in Sidecar. There is a bartender there that makes a drink after his grandmother. Grandma P. It's a sour vodka and delicious. 

Then dinner in their main restaurant. The seared tuna starter is delicious. My favorite item however is a cauliflower side dish. HEAVEN!!!  An absolute must try. ",5,2017,03,04
203,Family Stay ,"We have stayed at The Westbury a few times throughout the past year. This most recent stay was a little disappointing -unlike previous stays, the rooms were 'tired' and not nearly of the same standard as we had previously experienced-however the price in fact was more expensive than previous visits. One will be more cautious next time of this! However the staff in the restaurant were excellent as usual and the food was delicious. ",3,2017,03,04
203,Shopping trip in Dublin,This is the best place to stay if you want to shop. I would recommend the westbury for The friendliness of staff everything about the hotel we thought was perfect and could not find a fault have to say my husband and myself nearly always can find something that is wrong but it most certainly a 5 star hotel. We ate in Balfes and in Wilde and again excellent service and food.Definately worth a visit.,5,2017,03,04
203,First time visitor,"A colleague recommended staying here and i was very, very impressed.  Will definitely stay here on upcoming visits.  The staff was great.  Rooms very clean and the bar was a delight.  The location just off Grafton makes it an excellent spot for any type of visit.",4,2017,03,04
203,Outstanding Service !!!,"In the little time we spent at this hotel, unfortunately only 2 nights, has led us to the conclusion that it is without a doubt the single best hotel experience we have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.
Our stay exceeded our expectations beyond belief. For us this trip had been planned for a while and definitely worth the wait. From the moment we stepped through the front door we were treated like we were royalty and nothing was a problem.
The location was just perfect, plenty to do and see in walking distance. The bed was super comfortable, the d√©cor stunning, but what made our stay was the staff. 
The service from the front door to reception and wait staff were all 5 star. Magdalina in the lounge was absolutely extraordinary!! We were served by her on both evenings, and the second night she remembered not only our names but also our drink preferences! Her knowledge of whiskeys and Irish gins as well as cocktail recommendations were spot on! We‚Äôve never experienced service like that.  
I could go on for paragraphs; it was clear to us that the whole team really enjoys working with each other. They treated each other with the same level of respect as the customers and went out of their way to help each other out.
The food/snacks in the lounge were amazing, the bar was incredible, and bartenders knowledgeable. 
We will definitely stay again. Thank you for making our stay so special.",5,2017,03,01
203,Wonderful!,"Our stay at The Westbury was a perfect end to our holiday in Ireland. Caroline at the front desk is so lovely and gave us a very warm welcome. It was my sisters birthday, when we returned from dinner we found a delicious birthday cake and card waiting for her. Our room was spacious but cosy and the location of the hotel could not be better!",5,2017,03,01
203,amaazing hotel,We stayed here for the weekend and saw the cirque de soleil show. it is very very central and right on grafton street so some excellent shopping to be done. Its near all the bars and clubs. the hotel could not provide you with more or do more for you. the bed is ultra comfy and the breakfast is excellent. they think of absolutely everything. staff are amazing too.,5,2017,03,01
203,Total luxury,"My husband and I had the pleasure of an overnight stay in The Westbury last weekend. We were met by a helpful & efficient parking valet on arrival.
Check-in staff were welcoming & helpful.
Our room was incredibly comfortable, with King size bed, nespresso machine, bottled water & latest magazines....all topped off with a view of Grafton Street. 
Breakfast was an absolute treat. Freshly brewed coffee, pastries, fruit, full Irish, pancakes...great selection! 
We'll certainly pay a return visit next time we're in Dublin.",5,2017,02,27
203,Fab.,"The friendliness of the staff is genuine.  From the moment we arrived in the carpark to the time we left, our stay was just fabulous.  We were greeted by a warm, professional smiling young lady at reception who booked us in.  All the staff we met were so friendly and helpful.  We had a meal in The Wilde restaurant that evening and it too was great.  Once again the staff were knowledgeable and helpful.The presentation of the food was excellent and the whole evening was relaxing.  The hotel is centrally located being just a stroll from Grafton Street, Stephens Green and a host of other places. Would definitely stay here again and again.",5,2017,02,27
203,Wonderful Westbury!,"When we first arrived at the Westbury, we were greeted immediately and made to feel welcome. Everyone on staff has a smile and is quick to help with anything you might need. The room was beautiful...everything was of high quality but somewhat understated so that you feel comfortable right away. We included breakfast with our reservation and were so glad that we did...the food is fresh. beautifully presented and delicious! The waitstaff is attentive and pleasant. We had the afternoon tea and it not only met but exceeded our expectations...we asked for a vegetarian option which was pleasantly received and executed. The food was beautifully presented on the 3-tiered tray and we actually started with one of the exquisite pastries on the top! We could have stayed for hours and would definitely recommend it for any occasion...we saw couples, friends, even a birthday party going on around us! Another day, we had drinks with some friends and again, lovely service and attentiveness. We would recommend the Westbury wholeheartedly because of the location, value, friendliness, beauty and dining!",5,2017,02,27
203,Great hotel!,"The Westbury is a quaint hotel in a fantastic location in Dublin. Every staff member we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful! We were able to walk everywhere. There are no shortages of pubs, restaurants and shops. Would definitely stay again!",5,2017,02,26
203,City centre perfection!,"Stayed here for one night - a 'freebie' via hotels.com.  From the moment we arrived we were struck by the attentiveness of the staff, who seem to have eyes in the back of their heads!  Check-in was prompt and good (well done to the new Portuguese receptionist!).

We had a superior room on the fourth floor;  I was a bit dubious as we were opposite the lifts, but the very heavy door kept out any noise, and indeed the was no exterior noise from the street below us.  In fact, the only slight quibble I have is that there was an interconnecting door (locked, of course) to the next room and we could clearly hear the film on the TV there, even though it wasn't up loud.  The room was very comfortable, as was the bed, and the bathroom was well-stocked with toiletries.

We had drinks in front of the fire in the lounge area, very comfortable, and then ate in Wilde's restaurant - pricey but very good.  Who would think of pairing cauliflower with pomegranate??  Delicious!

A nice touch was that when we got back to our room, there was a plate of lovely pastries and a birthday card from the management - I'd mentioned our joint birthdays when we were checking in, so well done for the staff noting this.

We ate breakfast in Wilde's, though there is a bistro downstairs as well.  Again it was a bit pricey, though freshly cooked and nicely served.  There's also a good buffet selection if you prefer the continental option.

The Westbury is ideally situated, being only a few yards from Grafton Street and the Powerscourt Town House, so you can shop and drop very easily. 

Would I stay here again?  Definitely!",5,2017,02,25
203,Overpriced coffee and minuscule scone,"Plush hotel in city ideally located for shopping and theater , and museums.  We called for coffee, but got half cold coffee, no sugar on table, and no hot milk offered.  The smallest scone I have ever seen was served- tasteless and vastly over priced.  It looked like a tiny piece of left over dough. .",3,2017,02,23
203,Fantastic Dublin Hotel ,"Margaret and I popped over to Dublin to the Film Festival.

We had a great time the highlight of which was an all too brief stay at the Westbury

Very centrally located this hotel has a beautiful Art Deco interior 

The cocktail bar is particularly impressive 

Our chauffeur dropped us directly outside and the concierge collected our bags and extended a very warm welcome.

Check in was faultless and our superior room was delightful

Cannot recommend the Westbury highly enough 

Bravo - we will definitely be back ",5,2017,02,23
203,Fabulous mini break,"Loved this hotel.  It was stunning, staff were attentive and could not do enough for you.  Concierge service was excellent.  Breakfast was delicious.  We were able to discover wonderful places to eat and drink we may not have found without their help.  We had a fabulous two days.",5,2017,02,22
203,Charming hotel,"Had a lovely short break for our daughter's 21st and decided to push the boat out and stay at the Westbury - and so glad we did. It feels like a small hotel and the service is really excellent but not stuffy. We don't usually bother with hotel breakfast, but this was included in the price and it was fantastic - the breakfast room is really pretty with a nice view down to Grafton street. 
There was a problem with the plumbing in our kids' room so they had to be moved, but it was very well handled. They were put into a HUGE room on the 6th floor and helped to move all their stuff. The manager left a hand-written note apologising for the problem and offering any help needed. Will definitely go back.",5,2017,02,20
203,Because You're Worth It!,"I was first introduced to the Westbury - when the US Embassy put me up there when I emceed an event for them at Dublin's Aviva Stadium.  

 Since that time, a number of different organizations have put me up at the Westbury, since I now ask for it by name every time I have occasion to stay in Dublin. 

Each time, I love the decor, the food, and most of all, the hospitality even more.  Staff members are becoming friends. The location is perfect to walk to St. Stephens, Grafton, etc. 

I love the Westbury  so much, that last week, when I was to be speaking for two days at the first  Dublin Tech Summit, I knew I would be in Dublin again - but didn't have a client springing for me. 

Even so, I simply knew I would be rested and ready and at my best form if I stayed at the Westbury.  So - egads! - I PAID MY OWN way to stay there. 

For me, the price was more than I can regularly afford.  (And psst, how can I become a brand ambassador and strike a deal?! because I am in Dublin quite often!) But, I breathed in deep and made it happen.   

I was upgraded to a suite and some gorgeous amenities were brought to my door. I was able to comfortably prepare for the event. Which was a great success! 

I would recommend The Westbury to anyone and everyone who was looking for a luxurious home away from home in the heart of glorious Dublin. 

Many thanks as always to the tremendous staff. Especially the incomparable Guest Relations Manager, Joseph Downing. 

Cheers to you all until next time. 
Kindly, Gina",5,2017,02,20
203,Amazing food and service ,Got a voucher for Christmas and went for some food last week. The food was amazing. I had the prawn cocktail for starter which was beyond delicious an the fish of the day for mains. The extra cauliflower an pomegranate was one of the nicest foods I have  tasted. ,5,2017,02,19
203,Fantastic stay at the Westbury,"We based our stay in Ireland at the Westbury for 8 nights and were very pleased! 
Wonderful staff--so helpful and welcoming. Evening turndown service and tidying up was lovely.
The room while a bit small was well appointed and comfortable. Loved the espresso maker! It was a great help especially on those early mornings when we were up before the restaurants opened.
We ate at Balfes several times and had mixed feelings about the service--sometimes very good others a bit slipping. But, the food was uniformly excellent and the prices were reasonable especially since this is a hotel restaurant in the city. 
The location of the hotel was great for walking around Dublin and there are loads of great restaurants and pubs literally outside of the the door!
My only criticism was of the bed pillows,not so comfy in my opinion. The bed was very comfortable however. Would def stay here again!",5,2017,02,19
203,Great Hotel,Stayed for one night only unfortunately. Best staff I've ever come across in a hotel.  Our room wasn't huge but it was classy. The restaurant and bar staff where so helpful and attentive. The price of food and drinks was expensive but the cost of the stay considering the standard and location of the hotel was very reasonable. Check-in and check-out was quick and they even let us leave our car in there car park all day while we shopped.,5,2017,02,18
203,westbury hotel,"First thing you notice is the warm smile which is short supply these days. That goes all the way too. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Hotel is very central , the rooms are spacious, clean and modern. Unfortunately I didn't get to taste the food in Westbury but the menu looks mouth watering. I would definitely recommend , the hotel web site dis't offer a room directly so I have to book through travel website and the rate was half compared to hotel website ,which probably is the only fault I could find. ",5,2017,02,18
203,Lovely stay in the heart of Dublin,"We had a wonderful evening in Dublin and our stay at the Westbury helped with the experience! The general hotel is lovely the bar and staff very friendly and knowledgable (try Carl's French 75 and Michael's Negroni!). Service is impeccable, room service breakfast was spot on. Hotel is in a great location to get to to the city's museums, shopping, eating and drinking areas. Room was good, very comfortable bed and the nespresso machine was a welcome sight! Our room I think though was in need of a refurb as the decor and finish was just showing wear, this didn't stop us enjoying our stay though in any way.",5,2017,02,17
203,Location location location ,"The only criticisms I give this Hotel are, sort out the key card issue it's a pain to customers and staff, I can't recall a time when the key card failed so much!
Also the kitchen staff need to keep an eye on quality as one morning I had a very obvious stale bread heated up for my Egg Royal. Which the breakfast manager was devastated about when I told him.
On a positive note 
Yep great location your within walking of everything, the atmosphere is just what we wanted. Local pubs just outside where tourist and locals mixed well.
Hotel clean, fresh and 5 star staff were professional and always available.
Suggest engaging with concierge as they are very helpful and not looking for the obvious tip that you feel in many hotels.
We had a suite and it was both spacious and nicely decorated, I would stay again.
",4,2017,02,16
203,"5 star hotel, 4 star room","Staff were friendly and welcoming, accommodated us on early check-in. Were offered a hot towel to refresh our hands on arrival which was welcomed.

Hotel generally is 5 star, with beautiful furnishings and elegant interior. Unfortunately we were given a room just about opposite the elevator (and outside the main corridor door which would keep out noise), which created some noise pollution for us with people coming in and out of the elevator and the music which is played in the elevator. The room we had booked was a superior king room, the bed was king size and very comfortable, but the room wasn't particularly large, and I wouldn't have said the amenities in the room would bring the room up to 5 star. It was, however, very clean and comfortable. 

Staff knock on your door early evening to ask if you need anything (turn down service, chocolates, water etc.) which is a nice touch though we didn't require anything. 

We didn't opt for breakfast and didn't make use of the restaurants attached as it was out of our price range so couldn't make comment on that.

A bit much to spend on what we got, but was nice to experience what the Westbury had to offer.",4,2017,02,16
203,Wonderful Location and Staff,We were in Dublin for a Birthday celebration and the location of the hotel was ideal and the service was outstanding. It was also an ideal location for shopping the Grafton Street area. The standards in this hotel are outstanding and i would certainly recommend spending the few extra Euro for the experience the Westbury provides.,5,2017,02,16
203,Above & Beyond Customer Care,"Everything from our warm welcome to our departure was of the utmost professional attitude. The staff was so informative, caring and helpful with our visit. They went above and beyound our expectations, from offering us a room to use while ours was being prepared to helping us find our way in this wonderful city of Dublin. Cheers to all at The Westbury!!",5,2017,02,14
203,Girls Trip,"The Westbury is a beautiful hotel, ideally located, with friendly staff and a lovely atmosphere.  We always love coming back - feels like home... but posher!! Room service was quick and friendly and breakfast in our room was a real luxury.  We'll be back!",5,2017,02,14
203,Great location and professional staff but the room needs some care,"We are family of 4 and stayed in a Deluxe Room with 2 queen beds. Spacey room, helpful staff and a really great location in the heart of temple bar. But the room was faded, especially the bathroom. The shower was not usable as it was impossible to adjust the temperature (it was either too hot or too cold). We asked have it fixed, which somewhat improved, but the shower head had a leak water was spraying everywhere. Carpet was worn and old. Also the wall must be super thin as we could hear everything (e.g. laughter, cough) we were woken up at 4am when the neighbour came home. Not really 5-star quality, and not rush to go back there again. ",3,2017,02,13
203,a special night away with a bit of class and luxury,"I booked an overnight stay in the westbury hotel as a little surprise for my husbands 40th birthday and I picked there because of its location and because I thought it would be a special treat with a touch of class due to the special day's celebrations that was in it.
The staff were friendly and helpful when checking in and happy to facilitate our late check out request with no problems.
Unfortunately once we got to our room our expectations took a serious tumble... the room was in serious need of an upgrade the furniture, the decor and the bathroom were all very dated and in places damaged. We even found hairs in the wash hand basin. Not wanting to ruin the evening we got on with our plans and had a good night out in Dublin city. 
We had breakfast in bed which was very good and delivered on time but unfortunately our late check out felt under pressured due to 5 different disruptions asking about room service etc. which was highly annoying when we only had one night away to relax from the children.
The one star rating is due to the fact that we chatted with the management the next day when checking out and they apologised and said they wanted to try make amends for this by sending a voucher for an upgrade should we book again which has never materialised. 
As a result i would find it very hard to recommend or consider booking the Westbury Hotel again for any occasion in the future.",1,2017,02,11
203,Old School Service,"I stayed at The Westbury for a couple nights whilst having meetings in the city. I was fortunate enough to be upgraded. In addition, the staff made a point of remembering my name and arming with maps and advice on what to do (between appointments) nearby.

The room was lovely and the bathroom perfect for my needs. The breakfast was amazing  - one of the best meals that I have ever eaten in a hotel.

In short, this hotel is pure class.",4,2017,02,10
203,A bit faded....,"I struggled with the rating on this one a bit. This was obviously at one time a beautiful hotel. Unfortunately it is time for a facelift. Nothing glaring just a bit worn ‚Äì e.g. large knob missing from below the check-in counter, spot on chair in room, lamp shade that was askew and no amount of juggling was going to fix it, black out curtain was detached at one end. I was also a bit taken aback to pull out a towel to find it had a hole in it - this one alone was a bit shocking for a five star hotel. I was a single traveler and they were very helpful in accommodating an early check in. I was also a bit shocked there as the closet space in my room was little to none. It was also a handicapped room with a very odd shower set up but beggars can‚Äôt be choosers when it comes to early check-in. Other than quibbles already mentioned the room was well appointed - robes, slippers, safe, keurig.The location is good as well providing a quiet night of sleep. As a solo traveler I always felt safe and liked the controlled entry at side door. I was facing an interior courtyard which while was not the most scenic also protected against street noise - much prettier at night than during the day. They have a super breakfast with plenty to choose from in both cold and hot options. I found the food in general to be quite good. However, the real saving grace of this hotel is the staff. Extremely accommodating and gracious. While I would stay here again it will not be my first choice based on other options at this price point.",4,2017,02,10
203,return visit,"As usual the staff  at the Hotel were superb from the time we checked  in until we departed. we have been staying at the Westbury for  over 20 yrs and have stayed at other Hotels , but is hard to beat the professionalism o the Westbury. We will be returning shortly.",5,2017,02,10
203,Afternoon ,"I expected a lot better the quality of the afternoon tea did not match the hotel decor and service. At ‚Ç¨47 each processed ham, mini scones and strange bread with cream on the top tier just isn't good enough. Much better at the Westin hotel and the shelbourne hotel . Disappointed. ",3,2017,02,09
203,The real deal; the standard by which a hotel should be run,"The Westbury is tucked away just off the shopping area of Grafton Street. It is an old-school, but not stuffy, hotel. Linen is lovely, rooms are quiet, breakfasts are good. But what sets it apart is its staff; I got a genuine hello from every one of them wherever I was in the hotel and nothing seemed too much trouble. I stay in loads of hotels for work and this rates amongst the best. ",5,2017,02,06
203,40th birthday trip,"My husband and I visited Dublin for the first time and stayed at the Westbury. It was a great location, wonderful service and very pleasant to deal with. I would definitely return and stay at this location.",5,2017,02,05
203,Post dinner drinks,"Dropped in last night for a drink after a meal nearby. The Terrace is a fabulous and a lovely comfortable setting for a nice quiet drink and a chat. The furnishings are amazing and it's maintained to the highest standards. The staff are immaculately dressed and provide a top class service which is second to none.
",5,2017,02,05
203,Faultless,"I went to the Sidecar Bar for some cocktails after a birthday dinner, and from start to finish the way in which the staff conduct themselves, to how professional and collected they are, it's really a pleasure to go here. I have to mention Magdalena, who went above and beyond on more occasions than this, and is a fantastic asset.

Thanks again for the 5* hospitality, I will be back!",5,2017,02,05
203,Weekend stay,Can't beat the location of this hotel! It also has several lounges/ cocktail bar so you can chill out in peace without all the crowds in the pubs. I personally can only take a few hours of crowds and then like my space!,5,2017,02,05
203,A Beautiful dream like hotel with amazing staff!,"I stayed in the Westbury Hotel last night for my Birthday. I have a strong love for this hotel as I had one of my first dates here and I have breakfast every Sunday in Balfes as its near my work place where I work most weekends in Brown Thomas. 

I must say I felt like a princess from arrival :) The staff in reception so polite and helpful. I was even given a hot face cloth on arrival needed for the current cold weather in Dublin.The whole hotel is immaculate and has a beautiful sophisticated aura about it! Its honestly the only place I feel comfortable wearing my Manolo Blahnik shoes. Tommy on reception was helpful in booking us a reservation at a nearby restaurant last minute.

The turn down service was a really lovely gesture for the bedroom. This was done by a really lovely girl named Alva a real credit to the hotel.The bedrooms are so comfy and my room had a great view of the convention centre. I loved the fluffy robes, slippers and the umbrella for the ever so temperamental weather in Dublin. My bedroom also had a beautiful desert saying Happy Birthday. It was such a sweet gesture.

After returning from a nearby restaurant we got to sit in the window seat and enjoy some great cocktails. The window seat is my favourite thing about this hotel as you can watch people passing by on grafton street.The 2 waitresses and waiter on last night that served us at the window seat they were so amazing.They went above and beyond for us. We received another Happy Birthday cake and 2 glasses of champagne complimentary. 

The Westbury is definitely my home away from home!Even though I live in Dublin I absolutely adore the hotel interior and its friendly hard working staff members. 

If you've read negative reviews on this about the hotel!These reviews give a false view of the hotel. Definitely go visit and see for yourself.

5 star service! 

Much love to everyone in the Westbury hotel and thank you for making my 24th Birthday magical. I will definitely stay again. But for now ill continue my breakfast tradition in Balfes and my weekend cocktails.

<3 Eimear",5,2017,02,05
203,Amazing,"Stayed recently for one night, to have a family get together prior to my sister and her family emigrating to Australia.
Everything at this hotel was just perfect.  Rooms, restaurant, breakfast just out of this world.
Its location just off Grafton St. is just so convenient.  We could not get over the friendly staff in all areas of this property.  
I would recommend this hotel, to everybody who wants to be pampered and stay in luxury.   Quite pricey but worth every euro.
Will definitely be back.   Thanks to Everybody.",5,2017,02,05
203,A Treat!,My husband and I had a lovely night here in early January. When we booked in were were upgraded as we were celebrating a special occasion. The receptionist was really welcoming. The room was lovely and spotlessly clean. The hotel is very centrally located in the city. I loved all the flower arrangements around the hotel and I can honestly say that every member of staff were very friendly. We had a beautiful breakfast the following morning and my one minor complaint was that the waiter arrived with my hot breakfast too quickly as I had just started to eat a selection of fresh fruit so I had to leave it as the hot breakfast was getting cold. He was  too efficient ! There was no problem storing our luggage while we shopped after checking out. I would highly recommend the hotel. ,5,2017,02,02
203,Well situated hotel ,A beautiful hotel that is perfectly situated in Dublin. Friendly staff and beautiful rooms. A great welcoming feeling from meeting the doorman on arrival to saying goodbye when departing. Breakfast was perfect in a lovely setting. Would definitely stay here again. ,5,2017,02,02
203,Fantastic location!,"It was our first time in Dublin and we were thrilled that this hotel provided not only a wonderful ambience, but the perfect location for all of our walking explorations of the city. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was not extraordinary, but it was clean, quiet, and comfortable. It overlooked the Westbury entrance and Grafton Street just beyond; which was fun for people wartching! Breakast (included) was amazing. Terrific service and a delicious variety of choices.",5,2017,02,01
203,A real treat!,"Stayed in The Westbury for one night before we went on holidays in Jan 17. Very impressive upon arrival with valet parking which the assistants were very friendly. Amazing location, that area of the city for both shopping and night life is brilliant. Reception staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. We were offered an upgraded room for ‚Ç¨40 which we took but would not bother if I were there again. We did not eat in the hotel as it was a flying visit but from first impressions I can't wait to go back!",5,2017,02,01
203,Fab cocktails in a classy lounge,"My girl friend and I went in for cocktails recently and had a wonderful time. The place is grand yet friendly and relaxed. Service is professional, prompt, and efficient. The cocktails themselves were perfect, expertly presented in crystal glasses. The little Prosecco tasters and assorted nuts while we waited was a very nice touch indeed. This place is well worth the extra few euros! Would recommend to all as a lovely treat.",5,2017,02,01
203,Westbury Caring,"This was my third stay at the Westbury.  Every staff member with whom I came in contact took exceptional care of me.  The manager in Balfes recognized me from a visit in January 2016 and greeted me warmly, thanking me for returning.  The location is excellent, with many great sites within walking distance and easy access to public transport.  ",5,2017,02,01
203,Excellent,"A wonderful welcome from the valet parking assistant followed by a very pleasant check in at reception. Very professional bar staff with a very impressive  drinks menu to choose from. The room was nice, the usual standard from a 5 star city hotel, not huge but very elegant in design and clean. The Westbury in my view has a fantastic ambience that is unrivalled by any hotel in Dublin. If I were to pick a flaw which by the way I would be nit picking about it would be that the mini bar is automatically locked if you dont give a credit card at reception. I do not carry my credit card with me, I simply use it to make online bookings, this is the first time I have had this issue in any hotel in which I have stayed in. I did wake up to get a cold drink from the bar only to find that it could not be opened, sure a simple call to reception would of sorted the issue but I was not in the mood to make calls at half four in the morning. Taking this all into account my stay was absolutely fantastic and each and everyone of the staff I encountered were so pleasant. Without a doubt one of the finest hotels in Dublin. Looking forward to a return visit.",5,2017,01,31
203,Stunning from start to finish,"Always wanted to stay at the Westbury.......we were not disappointed. From the cheerful and friendly staff that took our car to park, to the lovely chap who called the lift and the courteous and professional young lady on reception......we were indeed welcomed! Lovely welcoming and fragrant room, not huge but met all our needs,with a few extra touches that made it special, such as lovely stationary presentation and extra toiletries. A wonderful breakfast awaited us this morning, with super choice. A list of specially cooked items from which my husband selected a Eggs Royale, a delicious mix of salmon, poached eggs and Hollandaise sauce. My choice of porridge and pancakes were top notch and I believe the best I have had!  There was every breakfast choice imaginable to choose from.The breakfast experience was added to by our wonderful server, Niamh. A wonderful mixture of professionalism and a delightful customer approach......what an asset she is! We left this morning, vowing to return......",5,2017,01,31
203,Top Class Hotel,"This is a top class hotel, very centrally positioned within south central Dublin.  My wife often comes to meet friends in the lounge area, thought this is the first time we have stayed there.  The bedrooms and lounge area are fabulous, staff very courteous and friendly.  The Wilde restaurant was superb - lovely ambiance and food was delicious.  The staff were very attentive.  We were celebrating our anniversary, and they brought us a complimentary special chocolate cake, with ""10th anniversary"" on the cake.  This is really a lovely place to spend a special occasion.  Even if you do not stay, they do some terrific deals for mid-week dining.
You could probably spend most of your time in the hotel, with it's many amenities.  If you choose to venture outside, then the front entrance will take you to the many lovely side streets off Grafton street, which are great to see.  However, if you go out the rear entrance, and take a right that will take you to what I believe to be the best restaurants and bars in Dublin - around the William St South / Wicklow St/ St Andrew's St area.  We had lunch in Salamanca, a few drinks in Stags Head.  That night after dinner, we discovered a few new places - really romantic ""Stanly's"" wine bar and ""The Port House"" which is a wine bar also serving Tapas.  Both great finds. 
Will definitely return to the Westbury in the near future. ",5,2017,01,30
203,Overrated,"Made the mistake of booking hotel through e bookers whose rate for 1 night did not include breakfast .  Eventually noted on hotel website that breakfast was included for same price . E bookers didn't want to know about it .When booking into hotel we (both size 10 and 12 skinny overworked nurses ) explained our disappointment at lack of breakfast and was there anydeal they could offer us.....Blank no sorry !    Our ""superior twin room""  which was clean , small , 1 easy chair for 2 people , basic toiletries, was directly opposite the lift so you can imagine it wasn't quiet .    17.50e for tea and 2 slices of toast each for breakfast ..and had to.ask for butter and cutlery !!!!   Disappointing.",2,2017,01,28
203,"Unparalleled, anywhere","Arguably the nicest and most competent staff of any hotel anywhere in the world.  From arrival at the front door, I felt that every member of the staff owned my experience.  By personality or training, or both, there is a respectful engagement that complements this magnificent property.

My room was clean, well engineered, and smartly organized.  The George Smith furniture is great.  The Art books were more than decorative, they were complimentary to the room and interesting.  The bathroom was generous in size with hooks and shelves in all of the right places.  The linens, towels and amenities were beautiful.

Dinner at Wildes or afternoon tea is not to be missed. Again, the 5 star food is surrounded by a 6 star staff.",5,2017,01,28
203,Ann,"We had a very comfortable room great air con , no noise 
Wilde restaurant is lovely , the new decor and food fantastic . The Gallery and bar area are very atmospheric but can be very busy and difficult to get a table
It was a lovely experience and hotel is very central ",4,2017,01,28
203,Celebration Bubbles ,"Went to the lounge of the Westbury for a glass of champagne to celebrate collecting my engagement ring. The surroundings and luxurious  atmosphere of the hotel was so very special... but made even more special when the waiter brought out a congratulations plate with desert and chocolates, very thoughtful! Thank you! 
",5,2017,01,27
203,Great service,"This was my third stay at the Westbury in the past three months. The hotel is in a great location off of Grafton Street, central to many shops and restaurants. The staff could not be nicer or more accommodating, wonderful service overall 

The one issue I've had during each stay is that the wifi service has been quite poor- only one bar, maybe two at best. I thought perhaps it was my room location, but I've had the same issue each time I've stayed here. It makes connecting into the office/working somewhat challenging. ",4,2017,01,26
203,Wonderful Hotel,I have just returned from my first trip to Ireland. What a lovely hotel with staff that are extremely friendly. The hotel has a luxurious feeling without the same price tag. I will certainly be returning to the Westbury,5,2017,01,26
203,Exceptional. Fun and luxury wrapped into one.,"First stay and I loved it. The location is obviously exceptional. But more than this it's a luxurious but never stuffy place to stay. Great staff, fabulous bar and love,y food and room. I was very impressed and cannot wait to go back again soon. Well done Doyle collection. ",5,2017,01,23
203,This stunning hotel made Saturday night truly special,"Our Saturday night at The Westbury was a wedding anniversary gift from our daughter and her new husband ... and what a treat it was. This hotel is a classy and convivial oasis right at the heart of the action in Dublin city. From the moment Sophia warmly greeted us at reception, we were charmed by the staff, who were friendly, helpful and unfailingly courteous. Our fifth floor room was well-equipped, agreeably spacious and comfortable, it overlooked the front of the hotel and gave us a nice view down Harry Street to Grafton Street. The hotel itself offered tempting options but we were drawn by the call of the wild onto the teeming streets. There's a wide array of pubs and restaurants in the locality but we were exceedingly lucky to get a table at The Green Hen on nearby Exchequer Street. Fantastic. For all the excitement on the streets outside, we found peace and quiet back in our room, followed another agreeable culinary experience at breakfast on Sunday morning. Edal and his affable army of servers added to the 1930's charm of the refurbished Wilde restaurant ... how splendid to have grilled kippers once again!!! Checkout was followed by a Sunday morning stroll around the precincts of nearby Trinity College. As we headed home on the Dart, we made a firm pledge to visit The Westbury again and again.",5,2017,01,23
203,Weekend in Dublin ,We had a lovely stay at the Westbury 5 star service.  We had a slight problem with plumbing in bathroom  the hotel offered to move us to another room but as we were only staying one more night to much upheaval instead they brought us a bottle of moet Chandon and a free film which was much appreciated ,5,2017,01,23
203,Fantastic  experience!,"I stayed here on Saturday night with my husband and it did not disappoint! The room was lovely with a view out over Grafton street. The bed was super comfortable and when we got back to our room there was chocolates on our pillows and they even left the slippers beside the bed! The minibar wasn't working properly but a very friendly gentleman called Henry Kinch came to our assistance and got it working in no time, very friendly! My only criticism I would have is that at breakfast I would have preferred if our empty plates were taken away to make more room for clean ones and more food but that's only a small thing! Thanks again and we hope to be back soon.",5,2017,01,22
203,What a friendly staff!,"Fantastic hotel in a heart of Dublin! Well located but first of all decent, clean and stylish rooms and what is the most important extremely helpful, professional and non-abusive staff! The guys from the drink bar are extraordinary! Michal, Waldek and others make the difference! ""Lady P"" cocktail by Michal is a real must have drink. For a long time I have not experienced so nice place to stay! Worth every penny, although Cesar's salad or club sandwich need a little bit of improvement!",5,2017,01,21
203,"Fabulous hotel, outstanding staff in a super location","This is a super hotel just off Grafton Street. The friendly, helpful staff are the best I have ever met in a hotel. Fabulous cocktails menu and sitting having a drink on the first floor looking over Grafton street and south Anne street was magical. Big bonus was breakfast served until 11 at weekends - amazing breakfast too! Well worth a visit if in Dublin and we can't wait to return.",5,2017,01,21
203,Fab Cocktails,Only called in here for a drink ( as it would be rude not to!) The cocktail list is extensive and well worth a look. I had a peach bellini  which was lovely. Complimentary nibbles and beautiful surroundings...maybe a bit on the expensive side but sure youre on your holidays and deserve a treat. Staff were attentive and as we had to wait a while for our drinks got two small complimentary glasses of prosecco. Always make a point of going here when in Dublin and never disappointed.,5,2017,01,20
203,Anniversary,"The Hotel is a fabulous location with really helpful and friendly staff.  The breakfast is really good with plenty of variety and healthy options.
However the room I booked was ""Superior King front facing""...........costs a  little extra but as it was a special occasion........................
we were allocated room 214 which was indeed front facing BUT facing a brick wall.  Very disappointing I have to say as I was looking forward to having what I booked!!
When I brought it to the attention of reception, I was told that it was indeed front facing.............they were not interested in the fact that I was not happy it was facing a brick wall. We were there for 2 nights and so I was not happy.
I would be reluctant to stay at the Westbury again..........
On my return home I emailed the hotel.............15th January, and as yet I have received no answer to my email.............",3,2017,01,19
203,"A lovely hotel, beautiful decor, fab food and outstanding staff, but some refurbishment required.","Lovely hotel. Whoever trains the staff here deserves an award, as all the staff were outstandingly helpful and friendly. The first floor restaurant area is beautiful as is the original art and fantastic floristry on display around the hotel.  The food was lovely, including the afternoon tea, but you need deep pockets - quite expensive. Our room was lovely, but as a double I found it odd that there was no space between the two beds. The beds and pillows are very soft - too soft for my personal taste. There was plenty of lights in both the bedroom and bathroom but the overall level of brightness was low - there was no area suitably well-lit for putting on make-up
The biggest disappointment in the accommodation was the bathroom. My sister and I both struggled to turn the tap of the handbasin off and the mixer tap was actually really loose. The worktop edge to the handbasin was all chipped; not very safe or attractive. The water disposal was rather erratic and the water gurgled and glugged away in an odd fashion. The shower was not very effective or hot and twice could only deliver cool, barely lukewarm water. The Westbury is a lovely hotel, beautiful decor and great staff, but some refurbishment of the bathroom to our bedroom was clearly required.",4,2017,01,18
203,"Wonderful property, great location, unbelievable staff!","You can book a stay at The Westbury with confidence.  We were there for four nights over Thanksgiving of 2016.  

The location is perfect - have a car service take you from the airport and you'll be set - most everything is walkable (even the Guinness brewery, if you've got a bit of time) and you can always get a cab.  The hotel is well-placed right on a mail shopping mall.

It's a short and pleasant walk to the river Liffey and the Temple Bar are.  And very close to St. Stephen's Green and Trinity College - it's right in between, actually

Besides location, the staff is top notch - pleasant, knowledgeable, and helpful.

We stayed in Room 615 - a Luxury Studio Suite - great room - large and comfortable.  And included Nespresso coffee ;)

Book a room that includes breakfast - there's a Continental buffet and you can order off the menu as well.  The food was great.

The hotel bar, Balfes, was great fun with a great cocktail list.

We didn't partake in Afternoon Tea, but now I wish we would have :(

All in all, a great stay.   We will be back.",5,2017,01,17
203,"Cosy place, in a great location","We stayed in the Superior King suite recently. Just like other hotels of the Doyle collection we were not disappointed. The room was nice, with a good view (of the city). Staff were friendly. I will be staying here again on my next visit to Dublin.",5,2017,01,15
203,Excellent service but basic room,"The location of the Westbury is one of the best in Dublin just off Grafton Street. Valet service on arrival and departure was most helpful although costly at ‚Ç¨25 per day. Staff are most helpful, friendly and informative in every area particularly at the concierge desk. Breakfast was delicious, scrumptious fresh fruit, a great selection of everything you could ask for on the buffet. Hot breakfast had a varied menu, we tried different dishes every day & all were amazing, served to the table by lovely staff. The downside was the bedroom, while it had everything in it, the decor & bathroom is old & tired. Although the bed, sheets and pillows were luxurious and we slept well every night. A bedroom refurb would make it a perfect hotel. Overall though I would recommend & return to the Westbury.",4,2017,01,15
203,First class 5 star all round,"This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in over 40 years of travel. Everything was impeccable. If I had to choose the most impressive feature, it would be the Concierge service. I would email frequently requesting a tour, a service or some trifling question and never waited more than a few minutes fir a courteous, detailed response. Whoever is responsible for running this hotel needs a huge raise!!!! And I am  not related to anybody who works there:) a true no-holds barred 5 star.",5,2017,01,14
203,Birthday Suprise for my Wife,"Got to stay in the Westbury on Thursday 12/1/17 (2nd time in just over a month, returning the surprise my wife had given to me in December for my birthday).
This time the atmosphere was a bit more relaxed than the Christmas madness in December. None the less the level of service remained 5 star. I arrived early (my wife was gone getting her hair done and was under impression I had booked into a different hotel) and was greeted by the same receptionist as we had dealt with in December, again she was efficient, helpful and most polite. 
I was informed that the hotel were upgrading our room to a studio suite and to say I was pleasantly surprised and extremely grateful would be an understatement. The room was ready for immediate check-in and I was accompanied by Thomas the concierge with my bags to the room. Door opened and wow what a lovely room, 4 poster bed, very spacious, clean decor, large bathroom, TV, nice seated area. I had bought flowers and Thomas arranged to have them put in a vase in the room. Very pleasant and attentive man. 
After my wife finished getting her hair done, she was surprisingly shocked when I gave her the key cards for the Westbury, none the wiser she was going to be staying in a suite. On arriving back to the hotel, a nice treat awaited my wife courtesy of the hotel with a card from guest relations wishing her a happy birthday.
We had a drink in the sidecar bar which is very discreetly situated just off the lobby, and with the open fire was nice to relax in. Breakfast was lovely with a wide variety of options to eat. I had eggs florentine and it was cooked perfectly. I did express checkout and was emailed the receipt very shortly after departure.
Just like to thank the Westbury for another wonderful stay, faultless, a wonderful 5 star experience. Why look else where to stay when you have the Westbury. All the best for 2017 and continued success.",5,2017,01,13
203,5* indeed! ,"Stayed here with my boyfriend last weekend, the staff were so friendly and welcoming. Nothing was too much trouble, very helpful.

Our room was luxurious and spacious. Everything was replenished daily. 

We didn't have food or drinks at the hotel as it was in a superb location just off grafton street. Plenty of things to see and do within walking distance. 

I hope to stay with you again in the future. 

Thank you for making our stay so special. ",5,2017,01,13
203,Irish magic in the heart of Dublin,"I am staying at The Westbury as I write this review. I have stayed here many times in the
past. It is my home away from home when I m in Dublin.The service and attention are extraordinary. The rooms are well appointed and luxurious. Treat yourself to High Tea in the Gallery or fine meal in the Wilde restaurant. I hope to stay at The Westbury many times in the future!",5,2017,01,12
203,Oasis,"Incredibly well situated, comfortable hotel with excellent service at all levels. We were very impressed with all of the staff, who are very welcoming and helpful, as we were with the bars and restaurants. Breakfast in Wilde was delicious and varied. Wilde is a very beautiful art deco styled room, especially the garden/terrace section, where interesting lamps, high windows and greenery abound. I had many a well-crafted cocktail from the Sidecar bar, which is also a delight to look at, with it‚Äôs lovely collection of cocktail tools and glasses.  Overall, a great experience, right in the center of Dublin. ",5,2017,01,12
203,Beautiful indulgence,"This hotel has amazing service, all within luxury surrounds. The bar is especially lovely. 
The bathrooms and rooms were spacious and immaculately maintained. 
A highly recommended hotel for travellers to Dublin. ",5,2017,01,11
203,Afternoon tea has gone downhill,"Having taken my Mum for afternoon every few months to the Westbury for years, it's with regret that I note that it has gone downhill. The service was poor with only one waiter for the whole floor ( it was a week rather than weekend) and we were seated next to a mother and toddler group ( I have kids but I wouldn't bring them to afternoon tea in the westbury when you are looking for a bit of grown up time) so had a crying baby and jumping toddler who clearly would have preferred to be jumping around outside. So disappointed. This is the third time I have tried to post this review but TripAdvisor have not posted it so let's see this time....",3,2017,01,10
203,Very expensive without the magic touch,"Myself and my wife visited the hotel on Christmas for a night away. I dint mind paying over the odds for a treat if you are made to feel special which we were not. The staff at the check in were very friendly and I couldn't say any staff were rude. We got a wake up call that we did not want to get. The lobby was impressive but not somewhere you could sit down on a comfy chair and relax. The room was nice but not that impressive.   If I'm visiting a 5 star in future it will not be this hotel. In my opinion it is just a big busy hotel without the 5 star feel but definitely the 5 star price.
 You are paying for the location only",2,2017,01,09
203,It all ended perfectly in the end,"We just finished staying at the Westbury for Christmas and New Years Eve.
The Hotel was completely full and bustling with entertainment.
We had a slight hiccup and the beginning of the stay but the management were lightening quick to resolve the issue and the remainder of the stay was perfect.
We have stayed at the Westbury on numerous occasions so we love the location and the staff are always attentive and knowledgeable to say the least.
The updated Wilde's restaurant acts as your breakfast stop and fine dining in the evening, both are very well presented (see separate reviews).
If you fancy Afternoon Tea you must try out the Westbury, it is well worth the time.
We will return to Dublin again shortly and we will be staying at the Westbury.",4,2017,01,09
203,Pre authorised payments!!!!!!,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights over the new year & it really is a lovely hotel with lovely staff

There is however a major issue with them holding on to your money!!!!!
 We gave them a card to,pre authorise on arrival which they took over ¬£200 from, we paid the balance on departure(the 1st) BUT have still not had the pre authorised amount back, over a week later!!!!!!!!!
We have rang & emailed them but they have no acceptable answer as to why this has not been released back to us
This is a top quality hotel & it's disgraceful that they have this attitude towards guests money. We are now considering legal action against them to sort this",2,2017,01,09
203,Simply perfect!,This is my go-to hotel in Dublin for location and excellent service. In spite of not being very old it oozes old world glamour and sophistication. The staff are always so very friendly and the rooms perfect. The large bathroom is a pleasure in itself - I only wish our schedule wasn¬¥t so hectic as a bubblebath with tv would have been a treat. The valet service is fantastic and the highlight of this visit was the Christmas tree in our room. Breakfast is to die for. Thanks for a magic pre-Christmas visit!,5,2017,01,09
203,Old world class new world service,"Our first trip to Dublin and what a lovely surprise this hotel is.
It's old world and has a lovely feel about it
The staff are really friendly and helpful .The rooms are a good size, clean and quiet.
The central location is super and we are also enjoying great January weather, cool but sunny.

203,True 5 star,"This was a true 5 star venue. The staff was ultra professional, the facility and rooms were large, classy and impeccable. Breakfast was very nice weather you had it in the ""Wilde"" restaurant or out by the tea room. The lounges were very nice as well. The location was prime, right next to Grafton Street and walking distance from everything.",5,2017,01,07
203,Wonderful Dublin Hotel,Fantastically located hotel just off Grafton St. The staff were all exemplary. Friendly and helpful and very hospitable. Make sure to spend time in the public areas of this hotel. You won't be disappointed. Take tea in the foyer restaurant and then move on to the Sidecar bar for wonderful cocktails and people watching in a cosy but elegant setting.,5,2017,01,07
203,New Year's Eve,"I went to the Wilde Restaurant with my family and friends for New Year's Eve dinner. The table was decorated nicely with a small gold box containing party items such as party poppers to celebrate the New Year for everybody at the table. Although it was a special New Year's Eve fixed menu, the food was spectacular. There was lots of lovely touches such as complimentary cocktails and non-alcoholic cocktails for the kids in the group. For starters I had venison carpaccio which was perfectly prepared. Everybody was extremely happy with their main course. I had the fillet steak which was cooked to perfection. Between the starter and main course, there was a champagne sorbet and a raspberry sorbet for the kids. Then the dessert consisted of a chocolate molten cake to die for. There was also a rhubarb (for the vegetarians). The wine was also divine. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely go back.

203,New Years visit,"The Westbury was the perfect hotel for our visit.  Could not have asked for a better location.  Right in the center of everything, yet off on a quiet street.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Rooms are typical european small, but very nice.  We had 2 rooms for our family of 4.  Were able to put our rooms next to each other.  Clean, nicely decorated rooms.  We ate at both restaurants and had drinks in the bar and really enjoyed them all.  Would highly recommend The Westbury to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2017,01,05
203,Excellent staff and rooms,"This hotel exceeded my expectations when an issue arose with our original room. The noise level was unsatisfactory in our first room, and we were moved to two rooms side by side. The employees are the BEST at this hotel.",5,2017,01,05
203,Truly 5 Star,"Our second stay at the Westbury and hopefully not our last.  Staff go above and beyond to make the stay pleasant, relaxing and enjoyable.  

Our room was on the fifth floor with a great view of the city below.  Location couldn't be better.

Room very comfortable with everything that we needed ... including a complimentary birthday treat!

Our room wasn't ready when we arrived but we were well looked after by the guest relations manager.

Already looking forward to our stay in 2017!",5,2017,01,05
203,Dublin at its best! ,"Visiting Dublin  for a wedding late December and booked the Westbury as it was close to the wedding reception at a nearby hotel.  The attention received from all the staff was excellent - doormen, reception, breakfast staff and girls servicing the rooms.   The breakfasts were outstanding . The location of the hotel has to be one of the best in Dublin.  The ambience excellent.  Normally we rent a car however this time we didn't due to location.  Taxis not expensive.  Will return. ",5,2017,01,04
203,A real treat,"Spent a wonderful night here again this Christmas break, and hope we can do so again next year. I've spent nights in a few 5 star hotels over the years and this establishment is right up there. From the first encounter at reception to leaving, it oozes great customer care, delivered in a professional and courteous manner. The food in both Wildes Restaurant for dinner and breakfast was top class..I can't say any more, though we were unfortunately woken at 3.45am by the fire alarm (there was actually a situation with smoke seeping in from a bin set alight in the street) it was handled in a professional manner by all.
We'll be back...",5,2017,01,04
203,New Years Eve ,"It's been a few years since I stayed in the Westbury , great location if hitting the shops in Grafton street that is for sure .
On arrival we had to wait a while before being seen , receptionist was courteous but maybe pushed the loyalty card too much , and was just too false .
The superior Rooms are just ok we were given a free upgrade to for a room with a better outside view .
Balfes bar was not too busy and bar staff were attentive and talkative .
Breakfast was the worst part of the stay , they were labelling their fry up as a full Irish breakfast , why then is there a English muffin !. Breakfast tables are on top of each other .
Porridge was not great and cold .
I prefer the shelbourne for many reasons ! ",3,2017,01,04
203,Fabulous stay,"We had an top class stay in the hotel, there to celebrate our anniversary. We were shown to our room by the lovely guest manager and after we got back from a stroll around town, we found they'd added some really nice touches to the room. Everywhere was spotless, from reception, halls to the rooms. There's a modern bathroom in the room with everything needed, plenty of space and a super comfortable bed. My wife is quite sensitive about noise, light and even the pillows when she's trying to sleep and she found it all faultless. Top marks, top location, top hotel.",5,2017,01,04
203,Comfortable hotel in the city centre,"Excellent location and friendly service.The staff in the bar, reception and restaurant are very professional and courteous. Food at dinner and breakfast was excellent with an array of fresh produce. The hotel is very busy during the festive period with afternoon teas etc but the high standard is maintained. Beds are very comfortable  and ensure a good nights sleep. Nice buzz in the bar and excellent service in a busy venue.",5,2017,01,04
203,"Perfectly located, perfect service","Super-experience at the Westbury. The staff is exceptionally service-oriented, the hotel has 'grandeur' and is centrally located, close to Grafton shopping street, close to St. Stephens Green for a great morning run, ...",5,2017,01,04
203,Chic art deco style hotel in great location,"I planned to stay at this hotel but unfortunately my flight from London was cancelled due to fog. The hotel did not agree to refund the prepaid rate which I thought was rather harsh! I visited the hotel nonetheless for some tea after re-arranging my flight and staying at The Merrion. I was very impressed by the decor, location - near a buzzy district - shopping area and the staff. An ideal stay in Dublin would include a stay at Westbury combined with one of the more traditional hotels such as Merrion or Shelbourne. I loved the cosy feel of the hotel - I just wish they were a bit more generous with refunding my pre-paid rate when the flight being cancelled was totally out of my control!",4,2017,01,03
203,Last stop in Ireland,Beautiful Hotel in the heart of Dublin. On the expensive side at $300 + for one night stay. Spent Christmas night there and avoided a $180 per person dinner in the hotel by purchasing food elsewhere. Rooms were comfortable and quiet and the bathroom was elegant.,5,2017,01,03
203,Fantastic St. Pats Hotel,"We came to Dublin in March for St. Pats day and stayed at the Westbury.  It was fantastic and would come here again.  The location is unreal, in the heart of everything and truly 5 star.  We debated between the Westbury and the Four Seasons and went with the better location and loved it.  The staff are fantastic and the bar was awesome.  If you are used to a Ritz or Four Seasons I would recommend this property.",5,2017,01,03
203,As good as I remembered ,"It's been many years since I had stayed at the Westbury and the service has certainly not diminished.

A great location just off Grafton street with some great bars, restaurants and shopping close by, it was great to get to the end of a day and not have to go far to experience a bit more of Dublin.

The hotel rooms were very nice, comfortable and spacious.  One downfall was after asking if I wanted a wake up call I received it one the first morning but none thereafter.

Breakfast was a mini buffet and order what hot food you wanted off a menu.  I very much prefer this as particularly with eggs I'm not keen to eat eggs that are 'kept warm'.

The reception area and the bar were constantly busy and due to 'afternoon tea' bookings there was nowhere for the residents to go for a quiet drink or coffee, except out of the building which was not always convenient.  It was on the lead up to Christmas and a very busy time for the hotel. 

But on the whole, a great place to stay, friendly staff and fast service when needed. ",4,2017,01,02
203,Fantastic break over New Years the best hotel in Dublin,"5 star in every meaning , we stayed here for two nights with my wife and 16 month son and the overall stay was  fantastic from the moment we arrived by car to checking out  . The breakfast was one of the best I have had and thanks to a kind gift (a westbury bear) from  our one of your maids when we were checking out it made the trip even more special . Can't wait to return .",5,2017,01,02
203,Delightful Stay,"We have stayed at the Westbury a couple of times but not in the last few years.  From the moment we arrived, the staff at the Westbury excelled.  We had 2 interconnecting rooms which were not ready on arrival, the reception staff quickly found us a table to sit and offered us drinks.  The customer relations manager came over to apologise for our wait, this is how it should be done.  Our rooms were very comfortable, all the five star touches.  The kids had assorted complementary homemade cookies and lemonade delivered to their rooms in the afternoon, which was a lovely touch and much appreciated.  Breakfast in the morning was superb, great choice - eggs Florentine, chia pudding, great coffee.  Honestly, it was a wonderful stay and I can't wait until my next stay at the Westbury.",5,2017,01,02
203,Great Christmas atmosphere,"A family group took seven rooms on the 23rd of December and had a lovely stay.  Some of us had afternoon tea and others went to Balfes downstairs for dinner and all were happy.  Others enjoyed a few cocktails in the bar.  We were able to nip in and out to the shops for a bit of shopping.  Staff were excellent and seemed to enjoy working over the holiday period. Breakfast was particularly good.  Highly recommend a stay, especially at Christmas.",5,2017,01,02
203,Solid Hotel; Great Location,Spent 3 nights at Westbury Hotel over December 2016. Customer service quality was very good -- extremely friendly and helpful. Hotel location was great and central -- walking distance to all the major sights. Rooms were a little outdated but still comfortable nonetheless. Went to Sidecar bar which had great cocktails but they do serve nuts as tapas as heads up for folks with allergies. ,4,2016,12,31
203,"Beautiful hotel, great staff, excellent location","From check in to check out, we had a lovely stay. The staff were friendly and professional at all times, despite it being a clearly very busy time of year. I would not hesitate to recommend  this hotel and look forward to staying here again.

I had written a long review but trip advisor wiped the form when I logged in to submit it, forcing me to complete it again in its entirety. This isn't at all the fault of the Westbury but it does mean the hotel gets a short review instead of the detail I spent 20 minutes writing. I think trip advisor do this on purpose to skew reviews.",5,2016,12,31
203,Afternoon tea,"I was treated to Afternoon tea and it was pure luxury. Nothing could be faulted. The setting is beautiful, the service fantastic, the choice of tea and coffee like none I've ever seen and the food was all delicious! By far the nicest afternoon tea I've ever had! ",5,2016,12,30
203,Christmas Afternoon Tea,"My husband and I absolutely adore going for afternoon tea and he treated me to this at the Westbury on December 23rd for Christmas. Its my favourite place so far! 

We arrived early for our reservation but were seated without any trouble. We had a beautiful table by the window where we were able to watch all the Christmas magic. 
The food itself was phenomenal and plentiful. We took almost 3 hours to enjoy it but never once felt rushed. I tried a few teas but can highly recommend the Irish Cream Whiskey Tea which was so delicious. Just beautiful. My  husband had a nutella hot chocolate which he loved (I had one a few days earlier at a work thing, and it was phenomenal!). 

The staff were wonderful. We encountered a number of different members of staff during our long visit, and everyone was fabulous. One waitress was particularly wonderful, I wish I had caught her name. The service was impeccable despite it being the 23rd of December and incredibly busy. We were so well cared for and constantly checked on. 

We were given a little box of Lily O'Briens chocolates each when we were leaving which was just a delightful final touch.",5,2016,12,30
203,Afternoon Tea at its best. ,"Had the pleasure of a very grand and stylish Afternoon Tea in The Westbury recently. We were treated like royalty,  by friendly, professional staff. The Westbury simply gets better with age and its recent decor changes to its bar and restaurant are a joy. ",5,2016,12,29
203,Christmas break,The hotel is perfectly situated for getting around Dublin. The staff were very good and helpful. It was very busy but we enjoyed our visit. if you are a ight sleeper make sure you ask for a quiet room away from lifts and service area.,4,2016,12,28
203,Great base to tour the city!,"We loved it!  From the moment we checked in we were treated like royalty.  It is right on the heart of the city, walking distance to tons of pubs and shopping.  The rooms are beautiful and the service and concierge went above and beyond with everything.",5,2016,12,24
203,Excellent service,"My second stay at the Westbury hotel, had breakfast at Wilde and dinner at Balfes, both are extremely outstanding, my friends and I enjoyed alot.  

And a small incident happened during my stay, their CS solved it with no time with professionalism.  I truly appreciated it. Will definitely come back and stay with the Westbury. ",5,2016,12,23
203,Flying visit,"I came across from Glasgow on an early flight. Although I had booked a higher floor room, it wasn't quite ready, so I was offered the same standard room on a lower floor immediately . Bliss!
Staff were so helpful, and room service was fantastic. Food was piping hot, and very quick delivery. 
I checked out next morning with ease, and has transfer booked for me. 
Superb service in a beautiful hotel. Yes, it s pricey, but you get everything you pay for. I was alone, and felt safe, respected, and valued at all times. 
",5,2016,12,21
203,Christmas Afternoon Tea,"A gang of us book a girls afternoon tea every year in the Gallery as a Christmas treat.

The atmosphere in the Gallery is magical at this time of year and the decorations are fabulous. We had afternoon tea with bubbles and then stayed on for a few cocktails to catch up properly.

The food was, as always, top notch. Service was a bit slow this time but I imagine its their busiest weekend of the year.

Already planning a trip in January with my sister to beat the January blues! If you can get a reservation, go!!",4,2016,12,20
203,Romantic Xmas Night out,"Stayed at Hotel for a pre Xmas night out. Hotel was wonderful and staff were so friendly and helpful. The Hotel was really busy, but service and quality standards were still excellent. Hotel is in such  a great location too. One of my favorite hotels to stay in and will return.",5,2016,12,20
203,Wow and wow!!,"By far the best eggs in my life!! This restaurant was outstanding! The food was unbelievably fresh and delicious, the service was outstanding. I actually never left the restaurant for breakfasts. We always are in the hotel restaurant. Even if you're not staying at this hotel, you NEED to eat here!!",5,2016,12,19
203,Much Improved,"Stayed here a couple of years ago and although there were small niggles It didn't put me off returning again and I'm glad I did. The niggles have all been ironed out and the whole experience was first class. Had a superior room this time with super king bed and excellent sleep quality, housekeeping were fast and efficient and all the staff from the doormen to the check in desk, the concierge to the waiters were all fabulous. This is a lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin 50 yards from Grafton Street and in spite of being fully booked during our stay it was run like clockwork,
congratulations and thank you for a memorable weekend.",5,2016,12,19
203,"""Superb Stay""",Had a wonderful stay at the Westbury last week. From start to finish everything was superb.  The staff were extremely friendly and efficient and could not do enough for us! It was like entering a world of complete relaxation where we were absolutely spoiled in every way. Looking forward to returning very soon.,5,2016,12,17
203,OUTSTANDING SERVICE,"We came to Dublin for my Partners 30th Birthday on the weekend of the 9th December 2016 and it completely exceeded our expectations, the hotel location is perfect for shopping, bars and restaurants. The Guinness Factory was a a taxi ride away, as was the airport. 
The hotel was outstanding, from the concierge at the airport, from check in to check out. The staff could not do enough for you and the hotel itself is simply stunning. The rooms were bigger than expected and were cleaned three times a day (unless you pop the do not disturb sign on the door)! Room service arrived within minutes and the staff were always on hand to take your coat, bags or hold out your chair. On the Saturday evening we dined in the Wilde Restaurant and again the staff were on point and the food was fantastic. We had the most amazing weekend but The Westbury was the highlight and we look forward to our next visit.  ",5,2016,12,15
203,Total disappointment,"This is not a 5 star hotel.  Superior room is tiny.  Walls are paper thin, forced to listen to TV from neighbouring room for 2 hours. Staff were nice, Balfes was fine, but for the price, there must be better places. My first trip to Dublin, total disappointmentüòî",2,2016,12,14
203,What a buzzing place,"We were late for a meeting. So I arrived with my car at reception and Paul the Concierge ensured that the car got parked and the luggage taken care off. Great. 
The receptionist was very friendly and helpful and there was a great atmosphere around. Our room had a view towards Graffton Street, so we were in the heart of the city. 
The staff dress code is very good. 
The new breakfast room is a success, beautiful furniture, mirrors making the room big and the menue extensive. ",5,2016,12,13
203,Lovely hotel in a great location,"We recently visited Dublin for along weekend away with another couple. The Westbury hotel was a great find. Service was fantastic, the staff went out of their way to make each customer feel welcome. The hotel itself was very well presented and clean, with the rooms being extremely comfortable throughout our stay. This hotel is well worth paying a little extra for and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin",5,2016,12,12
203,Afternoon tea ,What a wonderful day out  .a walk down grafton street  amid the hustle and bustle  of the city at Christmas ..the  lights  are  gorgeous   .all the window displays are pretty especially Brown Thomas  it has to be seen ..really great ..then finish  your afternoon of with a pre booked afternoon tea in  the Westbury  ..I booked it early October  and was lucky to get a booking ..the hotel really has a luxury  feel as soon as you enter ..abundance  of staff  greeting you at every turn .. we got a table for 2 at the window   ...magical ..the variety of teas and coffees  was  amazing .. the sandwiches  so tasty  if you could call them sandwiches   ..tasty  small round  baps  with amazing fillings  and delicious  scones   jam cream ..and pastries  to die  for .and beautifully presented .pricey  but a real treat ..and allowing 2 full hours for each  sitting ..yes it's a 5 star hotel and definately  deserves it's 5 star rating ..what a lovely way to spend a Sunday afternoon . ..,5,2016,12,11
203,Enjoyable stay,"Excellent location.  Staff very capable,knowledgable and helpful.  Parking and concierge help with directions were particuularly helpful.  Quiet room even though centrally located.  Was busy time of year so some delays.",5,2016,12,11
203,Very disappointed,"Stayed in The Westbury on a 2 night shopping break , had expected much more from a 5 star hotel , very average 4 star is what I would rate this hotel as being .
We stayed in The Shelbourne last year, paid less money and there is really no comparison , The Westbury lacks in all aspects.  
Stayed in a Superior Twin room , was very disappointed with the room size,  it was tiny , 2 very small single beds , (although they were comfy)
Plumbing was an issue in the very small bathroom, the shower is in the bath , no hot water on the first morning from the shower,  I raised this with reception who sent maintenance to repair promptly, however pressure flow from hot tap in sink and shower was extremely weak with a trickle of water coming from the hot tap in the sink. 
I  was offered complimentary tea or coffee room service for the inconvenience of the shower, this arrived over 30 minutes after ordering and although there were 2 guests in the room only tea for 1 was delivered!! 
Breakfast was average , nothing spectacular, no 5 star experience. 
My biggest disappointment was that I left a phone charger in the room after checkout , when I emailed the hotel I was advised that I would have to pay for postage , and they would require a picture of the front and back of my credit card to process payment, seriously annoyed at this,  it would have cost no more than a couple of euros to post, after paying ‚Ç¨570 for 2 Ngts accommodation, I was insulted to be asked to pay for postage . 
Location of the hotel is excellent and staff were polite and pleasant, they are the only positives from my stay,  very disappointed and I won't be returning , if your looking for 5 star luxury in Dublin , stay at The Shelbourne there is no comparison.",1,2016,12,09
203,"Really nice hotel, great service, awesome breakfast","Very nice luxury hotel in the middle of everything in Dublin. I was in Dublin for a long weekend trip and this hotel was extremely nice. I arrived in Dublin early in the morning and while my room wasn't ready yet, someone from management greeted me, gave me a bottle of water, stored my bags, and guided me towards breakfast which they provided complimentary even though I hadn't checked in yet (very nice of them). I went out exploring for the day and they even called me when my room was ready. Food at the hotel was excellent and the restaurant they serve breakfast in was very cool and stylish. One half was a sun room that had vines everywhere and gave it a very homey but still really cool vibe. The beds are small by American standards and the King room does not include an American king bed (it seemed like a twin or full size). The lobby has a large sitting room that's very comfortable and serves an afternoon tea service (which I did not attend) but looked very nice. The location was great for a tourist exploring Dublin. The nightly rate for the hotel seemed very reasonable to me as well for the class of hotel. I highly recommend for anyone seeking a high end hotel with great service right in the middle of downtown.",5,2016,12,09
203,Splendid hotel with great service ,"It is simply different and perhaps in a way superior to normal international chain business hotels.  The Westbury is at the heart of shopping district with very elegant decoration.

The staff are very nice with a great human touch.  The eggs at the breakfast are so tasty and you should not miss them.",4,2016,12,09
203,Another 5 out of 5 visit!,"Always love to stay here. My Birthday visit again. Staff found out and I had a cake left in my bedroom and a Birthday card from the Hotel. In the Bar, Magdalena, one of the new staff asked for the reason for our visit and I mentioned my Birthday. Next thing I knew the chef had done a dessert for me and put Happy Birthday in chocolate on the plate! The rooms are lovely and the bed comfortable. The Hotel is situated perfectly for the City. Go take a visit. ",5,2016,12,07
203,Fabulous luxury hotel,"This beautiful characterful and fabulously interior decorated and designed hotel with its marble floors, gorgeous Chrystal chandeliers is one of the best in Dublin. It even smells divine as they use expensive scented candles in the reception areas.
The staff are incredibly friendly, polite and helpful (that's the Irish way) and nothing is too much trouble. Extensive breakfast menu with everything freshly cooked and to a high standard.
We ate in their bistro in the evening and the food was really good, nothing is cheap in Dublin so take plenty of money even a glass of wine in the hotel will set you back 8euro, but the food and wine is excellent and their lunch menu with homemade soup is beautiful.
The rooms are very comfortable and the most comfy hotel beds I've slept in, tea and coffee facilities but they're stingy on the normal tea (only one tea bag each per day) and no biscuits which I found odd, but if they feed and water you they're not going to get you spending in the bar!
Location perfect and up a side street very quiet considering you're in the centre of the city, literally 1 minute walk from all the best and designer shops in the capital.
I will definitely go back maybe nearer Christmas as all the lights were up but not lit. Can highly recommend.",5,2016,12,07
203,Dublin Xmas visit ,"Super hotel. From the moment I arrived at the door the staff just looked after me so well from checkin, concierge, bar staff waiting staff all are 5star üëå I'd a fabulous suite. The hotels location is excellent, super Xmas atmosphere in the lobby for me I'm definitely staying there on my next visit to Dublin. It's the best staff service I've experienced from a hotel in years, well done.",5,2016,12,06
203,"Superior, friendly hotel right in the city centre","The Westbury is an oasis of calm and luxury right in the middle of the commercial part of the city (Grafton street area). The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome and nothing is too much trouble. The hotel is very popular with shoppers for meals and afternoon tea but the staff take care to accommodate guests as a priority. We arrived by car to find the car park full but the doormen provided valet parking and we could go ahead and check-in. The rooms are small, as one might expect in a city centre hotel but are very clean and very comfortable. We had a family lunch which was excellent. Though the hotel is a bit more expensive than average it is worth the extra for the service and quality of food.",5,2016,12,05
203,"Luxury and comfort, it is always an absolute pleasure. ","I rarely go to Dublin without dropping by this fabulous hotel. The atmosphere is always relaxed and the staff are very professional. I love to sit in the luxurious voyer, order a drink and enjoy the ambience. ",5,2016,12,05
203,In the best two Hotels in Dublin,"Not a cheap hotel but worth every penny. You are in a small street jut off Grafton Street, the staff are amazing as nothing is too much effort. The room had one of the comfiest beds I have ever slept in. 

The entrance and 1 floor up to reception is very grand, this continues through the large lounge area. I didn't try but did see Afternoon Tea being served with the most amazing cakes.

Breakfast was nice and vast. There is also a very nice basement bar that almost sits on the street. Great for Late or an early pint of Guinness

Ther are always a steady stream of Taxis outiside..",5,2016,12,03
203,Long Weekend in Dublin,"This hotel has a perfect location, just off of Grafton.  The entire staff was so friendly, and couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome.  We stayed in a suite on the sixth floor, which I would highly recommend - extremely quiet. Bed was so comfortable, and the linens and pillows are very, very nice. We would also highly recommend the hotel bar, which has a cozy feel, good food and the best cocktail I've ever had (called the Devilshoof).",5,2016,12,03
203,fantastic,"There is something about the Doyle Group that just works, this hotel like others in the group is just well managed. The location is great and altogether a great experience. The breakfasts are fantastic too.",5,2016,12,02
203,Great Experience and a wonderfull staff,"The staff at this hotel is fantastic and makes us feel special. 
They are all without exception friendly, polite and genuinely concerned with customer service.
The conditions and location are Perfect as well.

",5,2016,12,01
203,Great Hotel w/ Outstanding Service,"The Westbury is a traditional, but very well maintained Hotel in the dead center of Dublin. While the Hotel was really good - the service was the exceptional part. I'm travelling a lot - but the service both at check-in and check-out, but also from the concierge was really, really great. I can definitely can recommend this Hotel. I'll be back for sure.",5,2016,11,29
203,Marcin made our night,"To whom it may concern
Last week I had an amazing night in the westbury.Everyone was so friendly and welcoming but there was one that really stood out.In Balfes the service from Andrea was excellent and the food was exquisite.Marcin was an incredible host and went out of his way to look after us extremely well.Many thanks for your great service 
Zelda Blount",5,2016,11,28
203,Weekend at the Westbury,"On arrival Friday afternoon we were greeted by staff assisted with baggage and effortlessly checked in. The room appointed a Superior King with front view was situated above the front door, third floor, a lovely view down Harry Street onto Grafton Street. The bed was extremely comfortable with sumptuous pillows, bathroom small but spotless and well appointed. The spa toiletries provided proved very popular. Room was very well equipped, with the exception of a standard lamp not working ( this was reported at check in and remained broken until we checked out, disappointing ). Breakfast served in the most glorious room was good, lots of choice and quick service on the Saturday morning. Sunday morning proved to be very, very busy, the staff managed admirably with an exceptional demand. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Westbury but the general feeling I experienced was a sense of two differing hotels, the bar areas tend to focus very much on passing trade, providing cocktails, afternoon teas and entertainment to anyone who enters the hotel. There appears to be no advantage to anyone who is resident in the hotel or any special treatment for residents in these areas. I must mention the staff, who are without doubt the most friendly, attentive, professional and helpful people I have ever had the pleasure of being a guest with. Thank you all for a lovely weekend. ",5,2016,11,27
203,Fantastic Location,"I stayed at The Westbury for a long weekend in Dublin.  Check in was fantastic - the agent was incredibly friendly and helpful and they were able to get me a room even when checking in at 10:00 am (very welcome after a very long flight from the US).  The rooms are really nice - very large for Europe.  Bathroom is small, but well appointed - nice amenities, robes and a blow dryer.  Beds are very comfortable.  Easy access to lots of plugs ins for the electronics - including one that has a built in converter for US electronics.  I chose the included breakfast option - food was terrific and very quick in the morning.  Concierge and doormen were all very helpful and friendly.  Check out was easy, quick and, again, very friendly.  Location is fabulous!  Easy walk to Trinity College, St. Stephens Green, College Green (lots of the tours leave from there), Molly McGuire, Temple Bar etc...  Also close to lots of fabulous shopping.

Only difficulty was trying to get a meal in the evening - they just did not have capacity for the number of people in the hotel and, as I found in most restaurants in Dublin, there is no offer of a table being available at some point (e.g. In 30 minutes).  Rather, you are told it's full up and that's it.  They were ultimately able to accommodate me in a lounge area - but a little begrudgingly.   

Overall, I highly recommend the hotel.",4,2016,11,27
203,World's Best Hotel,"There is nothing wanting about this hotel. The facility is beautiful, as are the accommodations.  There is no better location in central Dublin.  Above all, the staff are superb.  They excel at making guests feel truly welcome and meeting their every need.  We will definitely stay at  the Westbury on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2016,11,26
203,Lovely stay,"My parents stayed in the hotel for the weekend, when booking the person me was it a special occasion it was, my dad was 80 not long before.  My dad was delighted when they came back to the hotel after a night out to find a bottle of bubbly and a birthday card out for him and the towels made into swans. They really enjoyed their stay, staff were very welcoming and hotel is in the centre of the city close to everything. They would definitely recommended the hotel and would like to thank the staff for making it extra special. ",4,2016,11,26
203,Warm and welcoming,Arrived early - room found with no fuss.  Staff friendly and helpful.  Rooms clean and comfortable.  Great amenities with refurbished breakfast room and new bar area.  Fantastic choice of breakfast dishes beautifully prepared.  Spacious popular lounge and a position straight off Grafton Street so ideally placed for shopping and exploring.  Definitely a great venue for your visit to Dublin.,5,2016,11,24
203,Excellent hotel,"City centre location, exceptional staff and a warm welcome. D√©cor is very good  - in common areas and bedrooms. V nice bar with wide range of drinks choices. Breakfast room also very good. Would stay again",5,2016,11,24
203,Afternoon Delight,"Everyone should visit this hotel and have afternoon tea, with or without champagne! We were celebrating my sisters 60th birthday and it was a special day due to the food/choice of teas and of course the champagne. The staff are so attentive and helpful and we spent a lovely few hours in absolute luxury which was so worth the price. Relaxed areas to sit (not so close you can hear your neighbours) ",5,2016,11,23
203,"Rooms are luxuary except for the tv, excellent breakfast, very good service, great location in the center","I have had really a good stay. breakfast was excellent. crisp bacon, nice freshly baked eggs, crispy croissants and little nice breads. One of the best I had.
The restaurant in evening serves excellent food with very special desserts. Top!
The room is luxuary . Only I would say the tv is a bit aged and could be replaced with newer led tv's. Furthermore the location of the hotel could not be better for shoppers.
Only one request is to stop playing everywhere loudly this typical lounge music but ofcourse this is a personal taste.",5,2016,11,22
203,Wonderful night in Dublin,"We stayed here our last night in Dublin and could not have been more pleased. We had a wonderful rate which included lunch and a continental breakfast in the morning. The staff were so nice and helped us with whatever we needed. The bed was comfortable, the room was quiet and we even got upgraded! Would love to have the opportunity to stay there if we are in Dublin again.",5,2016,11,22
203,One Awesome Hotel,"Nov 2016 stayed three nights in room 608. OMG! What a great hotel, and a fabulous room in the heart of what's happening in Dublin. Seek no further than the The Westbury for the best. Biggest room and one of the nicest that we ever stayed in. Great staff. Huge and beautiful common areas. And everything Dublin offers is right outside the doors. Blocks of things to do, shopping, pubs and restaurants. And we were there the night the Christmas lights were lit on Grafton St. What a zoo but what a great time. Go and enjoy. You will not be disappointed. Get a room on the 6th floor if possible, Second choice 5th floor.",5,2016,11,21
203,Very mixed feelings.....but lots of things to improve. Too many,"Had a corporate event at the Rugby game New Zealand vs Ireland last week end, and because was on a saturday decided to take my wife for a nice week end in Dublin. My preferred choices for Dublin in terms of hotels are the Merrion and the Shelbourne.....and they still are this hotels. Definitely way better than The Westbury. Another level of hotels. Issue is that I tried to book very close to the date, both were fully booked, so my Assistant suggested The Westbury.  

The positives: nice staff, very friendly, very client oriented and helpful.  Nice lobby bar and restaurant, well attended, great that hotel residents have priority to get a table during busy times, good prices, nice food and great wine and drinks selection. Room service was good too. Ordered breakfast twice and was good and delivered on time.  Issue is that this positives.....are not enough for a hotel.....

Areas to improve
- my room: 401. ok clean, but dated. Furniture with scratches and definitely in the need of renovation
- the carpet is screaming for an in depth clean.  Dirty, and evidences a long time without a proper and professional carpet cleaning.
- room size is fine, nothing special, but ok for a week end stay. Toilett is clean, but water pressure is weak, very weak.
- very strange to see the safe in the highest shelf of the closet.....I am 1mt66cms high, and to put things on the safe needed ot jump on top of a chair.....if any guest is not 2mts tall is impossible to see what is in the safe. Very inconvenient.
- on Sunday morning, cleaning lady knocked on the door at 9:35AM....I was sleeping.....yes, I know......I forgot to put the ""non disturb badge""...but 9:30AM on a Sunday is way to early. If the hotel knew that I was checking out on Sunday, why knock on my door BEFORE I checked out ????. Just wait until I check out, and then clean my room. Extremely annoying. 
- Now the highlight of the week end: on Sat Nov 19th at midnight, the fire alarm of the hotel went off.....apparently a guest in another room was smoking. Can happen.....issue is that the way the hotel managed this on this moment was very bad.....people starting to leave the hotel, a disabled guest in the room next to mine¬¥s didn¬¥t know what to do, young parents with sleepy babies running in the corridor, a guest coming and telling us that it was a false alarm, people hesitating, my wife went down and nobody was at the reception, she comes back and tells me that guests were saying that was a false alarm, but........NOBODY from the hotel calming down people, no speakers system guiding guests (happened the same to me in Tokyo with a 6,5pts earthquake and the way the hotel staff managed the crisis made a huge difference), nothing.....really nothing.....after 10 minutes, alarm stopped and people a bit confused returned to the rooms. I would have expected a representative from the hotel walking the floor, checking that all the guests were fine and confirming that was a false alarm.  Honestly a very poor and bad crisis management.  The worst I experienced.....and I¬¥ve been in difficult situations like an earthquake in Japan or a tornado in Miami.  The day after, complained when checking out, the Assistant Guest Relations Manager (Aleksandra Puskaric) was very kind, apologized and offered a compensation for my future stay........

All in all, and independently of the alarm issue, a very well located hotel, in the best place in Dublin, in the middle of the city centre, close to pubs, restaurants and shops, with lots of small details to improve in terms of service and attention.",2,2016,11,21
203,Great hotel in central Dublin,"Great hotel, smack, bang in the middle of south Dublin City. Close walk to Temple Bar, and even closer to Grafton Street, a pedestrian shopping hub in Dublin. Hotel is very nice, friendly staff, and they upgraded us to a bigger room. We were very happy with out stay.",5,2016,11,21
203,Really brilliant place.,"The location is ideal - within a one to five minute radius(walk) you are in the heart of one of Dublin's finest areas: shopping streets, Temple Bar, St. Stephen's Green, shops, bars and restaurants. 

Ths staff are simply amazing: from the valet to the receptionists, to the manager, to the turn-down service team and the bartenders in the cocktail bar - they are all five star and are always at hand to help. 

The rooms are gorgeous and spacious! Toiletries are really high quality. 

Everytime I stay here I never want to leave. It makes you fall in love with Dublin and its people.",5,2016,11,21
203,Great end to the night ,After a long day on the tiles we hit here for a nice end of night drink.  We had a seat upstairs. Place was really nicely decorated for Christmas and staff are super friendly and efficient. Special experience even just for one drink ,4,2016,11,20
203,Excellent ,"One of the few hotels that is excellent all round. Excellent location for a city centre visit. Friendly, helpful and efficient staff. Very good room and equally good breakfast. We were made to feel really welcome. Excellent valet parking. The level of service makes this place stand out. A really good experience.",5,2016,11,20
203,Perfect stay on a very special occasion,"Guest relations will go to any length to  ensure your stay is as memorable as possible , so accommodating thanks to their wonderful manager.
From an early check in on a very busy Friday, to a wonderful surprise in the room to celebrate our special occasion...they made us feel so special as a family who had all gathered in Dublin and chosen the Westbury above all the other hotels in which to stay, for one special night. They were spectacular ! Worth the price.",5,2016,11,19
203,Excellent,"Great hotel and staff. Cant say enough good stuff about this hotel. Really felt staff went above and beyond. Rooms where great and very quiet, couldn't hear anybody else. Highly recommend having a nightcap in the bar. Breakfast was also delicious and plenty of choice.",5,2016,11,18
203,A hotel that oozes class.,"My wife and I stayed in the Westbury recently to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We both live in Dublin but I wanted to book somewhere that would make us feel like we could be anywhere but our home town and knowing the reputation of the Westbury, I figured it was a safe bet. It turned out our expectations were surpassed far beyond what I imagined. From the moment we set foot inside the hotel, we were treated so well and the staff were incredibly helpful throughout. The hotel has such a delightful ambience and once you walk through those doors, a feeling of calm takes over, - a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of Grafton Street‚Äôs busy shopping area.
As I had informed the hotel in advance of our arrival about the special occasion we were celebrating, they very kindly provided us with a beautiful bottle of complimentary wine and some lovely treats that were delivered to our room. 
Our room (Superior) was spotless, and came with with a very big, very comfortable double bed. The room also came with a wall-mounted flat screen tv and Nespresso machine (my personal favorite feature). The bathroom was perfect and very tastefully decorated. Dressing gowns and slippers were also provided for us. In some ways, it was a shame to leave the room at all. 
The standard has now been set and I would have no hesitation in booking The Westbury again. Granted, it is certainly one of Dublin‚Äôs more expensive hotels but after one stay, you will want to keep coming back for more.
The only regret we had (apart from not staying two nights) is that we opted not to have breakfast in the hotel the following morning!! Maybe next time‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
A special mention should go to Joseph Downing, the Guest Relations Manager, who does an incredible job and saw to our every need during our stay.
The Westbury has it all.",5,2016,11,15
203,Nice hotel,"Stayed here weekend 12/13th November 2016.
First impressions was fantastic, greeted at the door by the concierge, easy check in. The room as clean, bright and fairly spacious. The view from the room though was looking at extraction fans on roof tops, not the best view of Dublin.
Bathroom was basic, fairly small, and in my opinion didn't reflect the 5 star which the hotel is.
Lovely bed, soft pillows, and a chambermaid asked if we required anything extra (towels coffee etc) 
Breakfast in the morning was fantastic, it was very busy and professional, though a smile wouldn't of gone a miss. Being in the industry I understand professionalism is paramount but also a welcoming friendly smile which makes customers at ease is also as important.
In all , a nice grandeur hotel, centrally located.
Would i return? 
Yes I would if the price was right in reflection to what I have written above.

203,Beautiful experience !,"Highly recommend to everyone. 
Perfect location, Beautiful interior, 
Very professional and friendly staff, food outstanding ! This Hotel and The Wilde Restaurant have all what u need to have lovely quality time !",5,2016,11,14
203,Great location - questionable value for money,"It is a very old hotel. Noise is going everywhere. Door slamming and voices can be heard like with open doors. 
Fitness suite is very small, has one treadmill. 
Staff is trying to make up for all of this with charming attitude. ",3,2016,11,14
203,Perfect Location.....Friendly staff,"Beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin. walking to Grafton and all other points of interest. Very attentive service

Not too fancy but classy 
we loved it

203,Definitely the best in Dublin,"Wonderful hotel. Excellent location. Beautiful rooms. Extra comfortable beds. Brilliant and super friendly staff. Delicious food....and the flowers, the orchids - just amazing! Definitely the best place to stay in Dublin!",5,2016,11,12
203,Lovely Central Hotel,"Everything in this hotel was terrific. Staff was friendly and helpful, making very good local restaurant recommendations and reservations. Rooms were comfortable, QUIET, and fully kitted out. Breakfast had a great selection including a full Irish. I have no hesitation recommending the Westbury.",4,2016,11,11
203,Great ,"I am traveling for business reasons and I may say that the Westbury hotel is a perfect choice in Dublin. Centrally located, professional and very kind personnel, excellent breakfast.
I will visit this hotel again!",5,2016,11,11
203,"Pleasant, friendly and well located.","We began our first trip to Ireland here and were well pleased on all fronts.  Genuinely friendly staff, very helpful.  Nice rooms (we stayed there on both ends of our trip), but not the best of hotel rooms.  Still, quite good.  A bit pricey, but not outside the pale (0r the Pale).",4,2016,11,10
203,Afternoon Tea at the Westbury,I had a delightful afternoon celebrating a friends' hen over Afternoon Tea. The waiting staff were so attentive and the tea and presentation were impeccable! We had a great experience and I will definitely be going again.,5,2016,11,10
203,Lots of potential,"A lovely hotel. The tea was especially good. The room was good. Very luxurious. Staff helpful. The  problem is that the location listed on the web site is NOT the location for finding the hotel if you are driving (we were). The location for finding hotel is NOT Grafton - spent 1-2 hours highly frustrating driving on one way streets, only to find it was impossible to get there with the listed address. Others have had similar experiences. They DID send us truffles as an apology (and that does help)... however, I would ask they correct this problem and prevent it for future travelers, as it is a 4 star hotel trying to be 5 star,",4,2016,11,09
203,Not 5 star,"Our room was not up to a 5 star standard. Bathroom was in need of some talc,tiling was of a poor standard,  sink stopper did not work.tried to get a drink but took a long time to get served,very poor breakfast as we asked for a full Irish, had to go and look for milk and butter as none served, not worth over 300 Euro for bed and breakfast",3,2016,11,09
203,Westbury Hotel Dublin,Gorgeous hotel in a super location with very friendly and attentive staff. The atmosphere is always great when you reach the reception area and the rooms are very comfortable. I would highly recommend it. I'm already looking forward to my next stay.,5,2016,11,09
203,Exceptional 1 night stay,"Arriving early & very tired from our International flight, the check in Staff of the Westbury welcomed us warmly. 
The Lobby area was beautiful. Coffee service was offered to us as we waitied for our room to become open.
Our room was complimentary upgraded to a suite, #607, thanks to our Travel Agent in the USA! 
Very nicely appointed accommodation, great city views, and all the little guestroom ""extras"" that make your stay special.
Only 1 negative to mention. We were a couple traveling to Ireland to celebrate a special occasion. While the Westbury delivered exceptionally..they overlooked the fact our room was located directly next door to a family with small(and very loud) children. This was a bit disruptive in the evening, and then again very early the next morning. We were exhausted from traveling and did not contact Guest services to complain. My guess is they would have moved us, but we we just too tired to complain.
Westbury is in a perfect central location in Dublin. We would very highly recommeded this hotel and plan to visit again soon.

",5,2016,11,08
203,Wonderful Stay,"We really enjoyed our room a the Westbury. The location is ideal, the rooms well appointed and very comfortable. The staff was very friendly and really made our stay. We enjoyed room service and the on site restaurants as well. You couldn't find a better location as you are close to museums, shopping and dining.",5,2016,11,07
203,Wonderful hotel,"Located within a walk of just about everything in Dublin, this Grand Dame lives up to any expectations.  Join their club and stay two nights and the breakfast is on them.  It's worth the stay by itself!",5,2016,11,07
203,Dublin 2016,"Excellent hotel in a great location. Great staff, friendly and helpful. Concierge found car service at 330 on Wednesday morning to get me to airport after scheduled car service canceled. Easy walk to great pubs",5,2016,11,04
203,Amazing!,"This hotel is excellent for any occasion. If you are on a business trip, leisure or a honey moon this hotel is perfect. Close to mayor attractions of the city, clubs, pubs, malls. The staff is very professional. Rooms are great and clean. The Tea time is outstanding. Decoration is well maintained. Very satisfy with the experience. Highly recommended.",5,2016,11,04
203,Beautiful hotel ..comfy beds and great location ,"This is a lovely hotel , friendly staff ...the beds are very comfy ..for me for a 5*hotel bathrooms are a bit dated ..but over hotel lovely and location perfect ..next to bruxnells bar ..Ida on reception was really helpful ",5,2016,11,03
203,Excellent Stay,"Stayed for 4 nights by myself and can't say enough positive things . Very central to everything . The breakfast was fantastic as was lunch and dinner  .Very secure , comfortable rooms . The staff was very accommodating . Looking forward to returning .

203,They Bait & Switch,"Watch out for the mangement, they promise you one thing and deliver something different.

We had booked a luxury suite and when we checked in we were assigned a studio suite. They denied that they have a luxury suite offered at their facility. When we pulled it up on their website they told us that it was $800 a night for that room.  

Then to make the matters worse, they changed the complimentaary water in the room to cheaper one after 2days, same thing with the quality of the towels, and turn down service. the final night we satyed there we didnt even get a trundown service. They used to leave a few chocolates in the room the 1st couple of days then it was gone. We were supposed to have fresh flowers in the room, we had flowers but it was a few days old and it dried up after a day or so, they didnt even bother removing the dead flowers. When we asked for  replacement we got a pot of orchid plopped up in the room which had 90% dead flowers. ( I have Pictures of everyhting ) 

Aslo we were on the 6th floor in the lower 600's and for some reason the room service cart was parked out side out door in the corridor all the time. every time we stepped out  we had walk around the vaccum cleamer and the house keeping cart.

The worst was we were supposed to have a breakfast packge, when we finally got our bill, we were charged for the breakfast and the complimentary water for all the days we stayed there. (Over a week)

Be careful and double check everything. They are used to a clientale who are so wealthy that they dont check what they are paying for. It is overpriced and overarted. On the plus side,
The hotel is well maintained and the staff is friendly and helpful.  It was hard to see the cleaning staff literally on their hands and knees polshing the doors and mirros every few mins.",3,2016,11,01
203,Nice hotel good service ,"Good hotel very central close to lots of pubs and nice restaurants. Small rooms no view but good standard and really excellent service from staff and reception. 
Fresh breakfast and quick service 
Would recommend ",4,2016,11,01
203,Great experience in Westbury Dublin,"We really enjoyed our stay in Westbury Dublin, excellent service always with a friendly smile, convenient location and room comfort. The highlight is the breakfast experience and the warm lobby for a casual drink. Definitely a return customer .... ! Bravo!",5,2016,10,31
203,Excellent,We got engaged in The Westbury last Thursday night and the staff were absolutely fantastic to us. They did everything to make the night such a special occasion. Thank you all very much for your kindness and well wishes.,5,2016,10,31
203,Bucket list,"What a lovely hotel! Beautiful large room. Great bed. Easy access to city. Lovely churches. Close by shopping. Excellent bar, breakfast, and Balfes Bar Restaurant menu. Scallops to die for and excellent dessert cheese plate. Hope we can visit again!",5,2016,10,30
203,A very pleasant hotel,"The Westbury is a very pleasant and welcoming hotel. I stayed in room 541 for four days in late October. The room was spotlessly clean and well-maintained. The bed was a extremely comfortable. The shower had adequate pressure. The free wifi worked without a glitch. The staff couldn't do enough to help (although they did, wrongly, direct me to Heuston rather than Connelly to catch a train to Wexford ‚Äì I think I must have asked at a time when there were no Dubliners on duty). It's not cheap but the price is reasonable for the standard of accommodation and service. My only disappointment was the narrow range of choices at breakfast, particularly for those who don't eat meat.

I'm afraid I didn't warm to Dublin as a place and can't really see any reason to return. However, if I did find myself back there, I'd be very happy to stay at The Westbury again.",4,2016,10,30
203,Lovely Oasis in the Middle of Everything,"From the moment you check into this lovely hotel, you experience a gentle elegance with friendly staff prepared to meet your every need.

Oh, and the rooms are large and comfy too.",5,2016,10,30
203,Book direct!,"Word of warning folks, BOOK DIRECT!! We at staying on 1st Nov 2016 and needed a room with 2 Queen beds.

Nevertheless #excitedforthefivestarexperiece",5,2016,10,29
203,Wilde Restaurant,I am already a big fan of The Gallery in the Westbury for afternoon tea and was more than happy with the new addition of Wilde Restaurant.  This restaurant is very comfortable and elegant and offers guests excellent food (and food options !) in a well thought out space.  The service is friendly and polished.  Well done to Wilde on the space between tables ratio - an important but sadly often over looked element when it comes to 'comfortable dining' - bravo !  Likewise on the temperature of their wines - perfect !,5,2016,10,29
203,Oasis in the heart of the Action,"Service outstanding.  Really fabulous and informed staff.  Food exceptional, particularly for a hotel.

203,Perfect location,"Excellent location. Great location for shopping and entertainment in Dublin. Excellent food choices within a few minutes walk. Room not very big but very clean and comfortable. Excellent Bed, great nights sleep.",5,2016,10,27
203,"excellent staff, service and location",Dublin city is not very big so it pays to be in town. The Westbury is ideally situated. We took our two children and booked a room with two queen beds. There was a problem with our room and we were upgraded. The service was prompt and friendly. Breakfast is fantastic. Would recommend.,5,2016,10,26
203,Fantastic hotel.  What a treat.,Our stay at the Westbury was absolutely terrific.  We enjoyed it very much.  The entire staff was just amazing.  I cannot say enough good things about them.  Everyone there could not do enough for us.  The breakfasts were wonderful and the room was outstanding.  The location was wonderful also.,5,2016,10,26
203,"Location yes, Rooms no","Almost everything about this hotel is exceptional except the rooms. We stayed in both a studio suite and were moved to a suite (due to a cleaning issue). For the price, the rooms were underwhelming. They have a chain hotel feel. That is to say, they are clean enough with  comfortable beds but have somewhat of a generic atmosphere. I can be hard to please when it comes to room design and function - so maybe my issues wouldn't bother some guests ;) The hotel group could definitely look into the awkwardness of the furniture placement, lighting controls and showers. Overall the location is perfect, the staff is excellent and the breakfast is great. I",3,2016,10,26
203,Break away,"Stayed here with my daughter and had a wonderful time. It was the attention to detail that all the staff here had that have made me think back and say it merits a review. For reception,  for the complimentary birthday acknowledgment for my daughter, for the amazing breakfast in bed and  the afternoon tea. Offering umbrellas in the rain wishing us a nice day ...... honestly we have stayed in a lot of nice places but the staff here make it the fabulous stay it was. Congratulations to all concerned.

203,Fabulous staff and great location,We had a wonderful stay here. The hotel is a timeless classic and is in a great location. The hotel room was clean and well equipped. The food is wonderful and the staff were superb. Big shout out to Adrian who really went the extra mile for us! ,5,2016,10,23
203,"Fantastic location, accommodation was super and superb staff  Thank you we all had a wonderful stay - thank you","""The Wild"" restaurant in The Westbury Hotel is absolutely excellent - whilst on Grafton Street its tucked away - the food is amazing, service is fantastic and I can recommend the roast sirloin of beef for the Sunday Lunch.
All the staff go out of their way be it Rachel on reception, Ashley the concierge, Adil the restaurant manager, Aidan in security and Joseph Downing - everyone asks ""What more can I do for you"" - not can I help you, what would you like or what can I do for  you - I loved the MORE - ""What more can I do for you"" that they haven't already done.",5,2016,10,23
203,Expensive and Overrated,"I was wowed by all the comments and splurged on a visit here on the end of our Ireland trip.
The room was very small and the bathroom even smaller. 
It felt like it was simply a redecorated hotel room from many years ago with the tiny bathroom to match.

Location was excellent .

The gorgeous lobby area depicted in all the promotional material is the lobby restaurant/tea room and one is only able to sit there if they have purchased their breakfast or expensive tea etc which is great if that is what you are wanting to do but on the last morning when my husband was waiting for me he was relegated to a bench on the side which I thought was very odd.
Overall I would say this hotel is not worth the cost with smaller boutique hotels a better value with more charm.",3,2016,10,23
203,Delightful evening,"Hailing from San Diego, Los Angeles and Denver, we are not unused to good service as we travel the world. We popped into The Gallery at the Westbury to enjoy some champagne and ambiance. Our server Tin quickly made us feel welcome and exceeded our expectations. He thoughtfully surprised us with a graciously written list of suggestions of places to visit after hearing us discuss what we should do next. He is a testament to the high level of service one can expect at the Westbury.  ",5,2016,10,22
203,"Fantastic location, rooms, staff and restaurants!","We stayed 6 of our 9 nights in Dublin at the Westbury before moving for a business meeting. The Westbury definitely spoiled us for anything else! The location is fantastic - we were able to walk anywhere we needed to go in just a few minutes. The breakfast served in the Wilde restaurant was fantastic, and I was even able to have freshly prepared juice. Honestly, this was the best experience - we loved every minute! Would return here in a heart beat!",5,2016,10,22

Highly recommend!",5,2016,10,21
203,STOP PRESS: ‚ÄúWESTBURY  FIND CURE FOR THE HICCUPS‚Äù,"There can be no better situated or splendidly appointed hotel in Dublin. The Westbury is a modern classic, which made our experience all the more surprising. Where to begin? We made a third party reservation for our daughter and son-in-law as a treat on the night prior to their departure on honeymoon ... yes, they're newly-weds. First, we were informed (rather snootily, we felt) the booking could not be completed unless we faxed all our card details to the hotel (we mean all!) as the hotel had been defrauded in this manner in the past (nice touch). Advised by the bank not to so do, we contacted the Westbury again and were told the only other way to complete the booking was to visit in person. So we drove into the city that Saturday morning. It was highly inconvenient but we sucked it up for the kids! Despite our urging that this booking was to be in the name of the newly-weds (which led to the security hiatus in the first place), the name on the reservation and on the 'card' in the room was Mr and Mrs McGinty (our name) and not that of the happy couple (the new Mr and Mrs Statham). The fact that McGinty was misspelt (Mc instead of Mac) is trivial by comparison. The kids laughed it off (nice kids) but were a little frustrated when they were unable to order an early-departure breakfast to be delivered to the room prior to leaving at 0515 the following morning. They erred, it seems, in not trying to make this reservation until 10 pm, after they returned from the dining room. They were informed it might be possible at that late stage to provide a light breakfast to the room if somebody else in the hotel had already ordered one. That struck us as a little unusual for a top class hotel like the Westbury. That the happy couple were not aware of the 'rules' regarding room service may have something to do with the fact that no room service menu was in the room on arrival and then took some time to acquire. The room itself was beautifully turned-out so it feels a little churlish to report that the newly-weds were shooed-away by the panic-stricken maid when they arrived at 1835 (approx) and told to return in 15 minutes. They were touched to discover upon their return that the flower petals had not yet been sprinkled in the room! This endearing omission made clear the dear lady's determination to do her very best and the hotel's intention to do the same ... making the few errors outlined all the more surprising. To their immense credit, the Westbury contacted us within 48 hours and so sincere were their apologies, one suspects the hiccups we encountered are unlikely to be repeated. Classy!",4,2016,10,20
203,Ann C,"Looking for a treat for your kids or nephew & nieces highly recommend .Afternoon tea at the Westbury..excellent value..recently bought 2 8 yr olds, staff were excellent and very attentive and treated the ""young customers"" really well.",5,2016,10,20
203,Great location,"I visited the Westbury on September with my son for a long weekend. Lets start from the problems and finish with the positive; the taxi takes you to the ground floor and the reception is at the first floor. Without the room key you are unable to use the elevator and at the late arrival there is nobody to help you to carry the luggage to the first floor, welcome! Fortunately, we were lightly backed just for a weekend and my son was able to carry the bags upstairs, but seriously!  At the check-in, the good news were that they have been able to get us a room with two separate beds. 
Next morning I found out how dusty the room was; there were about a centimeter of dust in all bedside shelves, lamps etc (i'm dust allergic). In the bathroom, the sink drainage closer was broken and the tower hanged at a weird angle due to a broken tower shelf‚Ä¶ Again, five star hotel with a price tag!  In general, the whole bathroom should be updated.
For our early morning trip to Moher, I had asked for a couple of toasts as breakfast to be able to take some medication, and fifteen minutes before we were supposed to leave, nothing was brought! I called the reception, and ten minutes later I get a bag with coffee, some sweet pastry and a banana‚Ä¶no toast.
But.. 
The hotel has an excellent location at the old city of Dublin, thus you have a walking distance almost everywhere: restaurants, sites, shopping etc. The service is very friendly and they do try their best to solve the problems. I talked to a cleaning personnel, and our room was cleaned more properly, kind of. The breakfast was good and more than plenty, also the bistro downstairs was so great that we ended up dining there twice. Special thanks to the personnel there, they were very attentive!
So what is my final conclusion; despite of the problems, we had a great weekend in Dublin and the hotel personnel did make their effort to make our stay very pleasant. Now is up to the owners and the management to keep the standard up to the five stars without need of their personnel to try and cover up for the flaws.",4,2016,10,18
203,"Great hotel, great location","Checked into this hotel on a Friday with three friends, Stayed until Monday.

First impressions very good, Doormen took our bags and delivered them to our room.

Beautiful comfortable lounge with waitress service for coffee, tea, drinks etc also were afternoon tea is served which is excellent.

Lovely breakfast with everything you would expect.

Ate in the restaurant one night which was excellent, but there are lots of restaurants to try just outside your door which are equally as good.

This is an expensive hotel but you do get what you pay for.

What made our trip truly special was the Dublin people,  Everyone we met from hotel staff, taxi drivers, bus drivers and guides, bar staff   and shop staff  are the most friendliest in the world. What wonderful ambassadors for Ireland Thankyou each and everyone of you.",5,2016,10,18
203,Good place for Lunch,"The service here was very good, a little expensive for the food served, but worth it for style and Ambiance. The staff very attentive , well managed and trained. You will need to book as this is a popular place for both business lunches, and tourists",4,2016,10,18
203,Business 2 night stay ,Lovely hotel really lovely. They could not do enough for you as a guest. Highlights were the extremely comfortable beds and the cleanliness of the room and how quiet it was. I overlooked grafton street. The porridge was amazing. The parking valet parking excellent. Yes really nice. ,4,2016,10,18
203,Wish we could have stayed longer!,"Great staff, great location, and top notch accommodations.  Our 6th floor room was of a good size, quiet, and the bed was comfortable.  You can walk to just about everything in Dublin from the hotel and the staff was most helpful with directions. Breakfast was included; a nice buffet for my wife and my Eggs Benedict were excellent. The service was outstanding, attentive and yet discreet.  We hope to return.",5,2016,10,17
203,City break ,"Had a fabulous short stay in the Westbury  this weekend with some old  school/girlfriends.  The suite was perfect , our bedroom spacious and a seriously good shower   There was no noise from outside and the curtains darkened the room perfectly.  The staff were attentive from arrival to departure  .All food was beautifully  served and oh so tasty .We will return again , thank you !",5,2016,10,17
203,A different class üçÄüòç,"We stayed in The Westbury in Dublin city over the weekend for a Short city break. Relaxed, luxurious, and down right indulgent in every way and worth every penny. All credit to the staff, the service and attentiveness from start to finish was flawless. Special mention to our server on Saturday evening Josh. He showed a level of professionalism that other establishments would envy. Our return visit is already being planned üëçüèª",5,2016,10,17
203,5* Luxury ,The Westbury offers a fabulous experience in the heart of the city! Luxury treatment & would highly recommend!! Even the floral displays are breathtaking! The staff were wonderful. Can't wait to return. ,5,2016,10,17
203,I'll be back,"We stayed here for 3 nights while in Dublin.  This hotel is top notch.  I cannot say enough good things about the staff here.  They are all excellent..every last one of them was always looking out for us and asking if they could help.  Best staff I've encountered anywhere in the world.  The hotel is very nice, the beds are comfortable, food is excellent, and the wifi is fast.  I don't think I'd stay anywhere else but here now.",5,2016,10,17
203,Two-Night Stay for Business,I am a professional photographer and I was shooting a corporate travel trip from the United States.  I arrived very early in the morning on a flight from the US and the staff had my room ready and waiting for me to catch a quick shower and nap before embarking on a day full of shooting.  Breakfast on both mornings was excellent and the staff was very attentive.  I will return to this hotel on my next trip.,5,2016,10,16
203,Good Location / Nice Hotel,"We had 5 lovely and nice days in the westbury! The room were clean and beautiful. The view wasn't the best, but it was silent cause the room wasn't directly on the street side.
The breakfast and dinner in the hotel was always fresh and really good!
It was a lovely stay and i'm looking forward to the next one. :-)",4,2016,10,15
203,Loved our short time at the Westbury,"From the moment we got out of the car to the moment we left the hotel, we were welcomed with smiles and positive attitudes. The hotel was located in a great location within the city, which made getting to/from daytime sight seeing and going out at night a breeze. Our room was clean and well light and the Wi-Fi was spot on. I truly enjoyed the customer service which essentially sets apart hotels such as this - from the front desk staff to the passionate bartenders, this place was top notch. our parent's best friends will be traveling to the area in November and we have highly recommended The Westbury to them. ",5,2016,10,14
203,"Convenient, Comfortable Hotel in Heart of Dublin","After driving round the streets of Dublin as my sat nav took me somewhere else I arrived at The Westbury Hotel to a warm greeting from the valet who assisted with my bags and made checkin painless.

Reception staff were equally friendly and processed my checkin smoothly. 

Rooms spacious and well equipped good hairdryer, iron and ironing board and a kettle and Nespresso machine. Beds comfortable. When arrived back to room in evening they had turned down Bed and had lights on for me.

Went to breakfast at 9.45am and it was busy had to wait a 10 mins to be seated. 
Ordered scrambled egg and bacon with toast. Got one slice of bacon and a spoon full off scrambled egg. Don't think the breakfast is worth the money, unless included with your room. 

Enjoyed my visit but will avoid breakfast for future visits. 

",4,2016,10,14
203,Luxurious Location in the Heart of Dublin,"Had the pleasure of staying at The Westbury for one night in February 2016, and would go back in a heartbeat.

Combining the old fashioned glamour of a traditional luxury hotel, with fantastic service, and incredibly comfortable surroundings - if the budget will stretch, it's the place to stay.",5,2016,10,13
203,Wonderful,"We spent 3 wonderful nights at the Westbury during our Irish honeymoon this summer.

The location is perfect - just off Grafton Street in the heart of Dublin. The hotel was beautiful - modern with a Gatsby vibe if you ask me.

The staff was polite and provided high quality service throughout our stay.

Our room was nice and spacious, and the hotel bar was very impressive.

We definitely want to stay here if (when!) we visit Dublin again.",5,2016,10,13
203,Dublin - a Wonderful Welcome ! Such Fun! Don't miss it!,"Our quick flight from Aberdeen to Dublin was a pleasure - for the second year running.
Both airports excelled at assisting our reduced mobility status in a manner that most other destinations cannot or do not emulate.  Our appreciation is immense for the courtesy and efficiency we encountered,  including Are Lingus staff, Dyce staff (Martin) and Dublin staff at Special Assistance  (Avril,Rebecca and Geraldine).
This year the reception at The Westbury was exemplary - a welcome relief after a false start in 2015 with one incompetence after another. The central location just off Grafton Street was selected for convenience and incidental proximity to our favourite 'Trocadero' restaurant in nearby St Andrews Street.
Aleksandra Puskaric and Jack Fitzsimmons could not have done more to erase the previous 'Fawlty Towers' experience though unfortunately manager Joseph Dowling was out of town.  His entire team nonetheless demonstrated his firm leadership values and we appreciated the service lavished upon us by Rob in the dining room, Anna-Marie in room service, Keith in room maintenance and Claire in marketing.
Dublin itself was buzzing with international visitors enjoying the vibrant diverse cultural and retail enterprises which abound.  In 2015 we had been fortunate to meet  James Maguire, taxi driver, and happily were able to renew contact. He met us at the airport on arrival and having previously taken us north to Malahide and Dublin Bay - this time we headed south to Kildare Village passing the immaculate stud farms and estates then back over the spectacular Wicklow mountains to the city.
We cannot recommend this destination highly enough for a quiet simple refreshing and stimulating city break.",5,2016,10,13
203,Great location,"Loved our stay here.  Not really a classic building but a very good location on a quiet street.  Room was large and comfortable.  Very good service from front door, reception and housekeeping.  Breakfast service also excellent.  Only complaint is room was very warm and we couldn't figure out how to solve that.  We would return here.",5,2016,10,12
203,"Luxurious, with prime location & excellent service!","Nothing but positives about this property. Our flight arrived at 5AM and we arrived at the hotel before 6. They were able to accommodate our super early arrival, and we were in our room by 6AM. Gracious employees, from the front desk to the bar staff. Location was fantastic, as you are centrally located within Dublin. An easy walk to Temple area, north of river area, and you are right in the heart of the prime shopping district. As for the room, the bed was luxurious, the size was ample, and the amenities were what you would expect for a 4 star property. The workout room was small, but adequate. As for breakfast, we did not have it included and ordered a la carte. We also ate in the restaurant, which I will review separately.  I will stay at the Westbury again when visiting Dublin.",5,2016,10,12
203,"Business and Family Friendly, Great Location","This is a super nice business oriented hotel, although, it would also work for families with kids that are comfortable with travel.  The rooms are well done, the service is amazing.   The location is great for going out and walking around to the local tourist sites, shopping, restaurants, and the bars on Temple Bar (which is the name of a street ).

It is about 30 minutes from the airport.  I highly recommend using your GPS, we used Ways App, and it worked fantastically.  If you have not driven on the left side of the road, Dublin is a great warm up, the roads in city center are narrow, and most are two way, so passing is tricky.  Once you get to the hotel, I recommend walking, until you are ready for a drive out to the country.

The bar in the Westbury is a cool old bar, with a great ambience and drink selection.",4,2016,10,12
203,A bit of luxury in a central location,"We've just returned from a long weekend here and would be hard-pressed to find anything wrong with the  hotel. It is pricey, but the service, level of comfort and facilities are hard to beat. The valet parking is extremely convenient, and there are plenty of staff on hand to look after you.

The rooms are classic in style, lovely comfortable beds and pillows, plenty of storage. Our bathroom could maybe do with a bit of updating soon as it was showing a little sign of wear and tear, but it was well equipped, with good lighting, a magnifying mirror, nice toiletries and a good shower.

We particularly liked the Marble Bar, which had a fantastic selection of cocktails, and very helpful waiting staff, who were happy to give advice. We also ended our evening in the lounge, which was also very welcoming.

Breakfasts were a real treat, with a good selection of fruit, cheese, breads, pastries and cereal, and hot food cooked to order.

All in all, a very pleasurable stay, and one we look forward to repeating.",5,2016,10,12
203,Wonderful experience for afternoon tea,"My wife and I had tea at the Westbury and walked away so happy; service was impeccable, tea offerings and food was delicious. They also found out we were celebrating my wife's birthday and was gracious to gift her an extra desert. The corner table, which we requested, was very comfortable and we were able to soak in the beautiful atmosphere. Would return in a heartbeat.",5,2016,10,10
203,Location + Great Customer Service,"Every staff member was kind and courteous. The room was very comfortable, great pillows, coffee and bath amenities. Breakfast was included-a lovely buffet with fresh fruit, fresh breads/pastries/cereals, meats/cheese and/or you could order from the menu. Our host for breakfast, Mr. Ibnouzahir, was so warm and gracious. The location could not be better, right in the heart of Dublin. We walked everywhere. We cannot wait to return to our new favorite hotel!",5,2016,10,10
203,Our 'go to' in Dublin,"We've been to The Westbury before and couldn't find anything as centrally located that looked even close.

So very glad we stuck with this hotel. The lobby and gallery where they serve coffee and afternoon tea, is absolutely stunning. Our friends in other hotels came to see and regretted not booking in! 

The staff are welcoming, friendly and attentive. They want to help and make you happy. 

The breakfast is (as we remembered!) absolutely delicious and almost worth the trip to Dublin as a standalone feature! 

Full marks on all fronts - location, rooms, comfy beds, food, staff and cocktails! 

Thank you, The Westbury. We'll be back on our way back from our honeymoon next year! 

Lauren and Adam x",5,2016,10,10
203,Wonderful hotel in great location,"We stayed here for a long weekend in October 2016. 

The hotel itself feels elegant and luxurious, and we were given a lovely, warm Dublini welcome upon arrival. 

It couldn't be better located for things to visit in Dublin as well, which allows you to focus on enjoying yourself rather than getting from A to B. 

Breakfast was great and in the 'Grand Hotel' style - nice eggs Royale. 

Will be back for sure - loved it.",5,2016,10,10
203,Great cocktails ,"A group of us decided to drop in here for a few drinks and cocktails on a busy shopping visit to Dublin on a Saturday. 

Fantastic interior very nice and plush surroundings.  Excellent efficient friendly staff who were very knowledgeable oboist the cocktail menu. We had Great drinks out on the terrace. 

Fantastic location just off Graften street. 

Would visit again next time we're back in Dublin.

203,The best location in Dublin and the best service!!,"We always look forward to our annual visit at the Westbury.I've been coming for 25 years and can't wait to see my old friends the Les Clefs d'Or Concierges,Eddie and Tommy!!They run the hotel!! 
The breakfast in the restaurant Wilde is the best we have had in two months of travel. The Wilde is in the hands of the most amicable and capable Adil.
After breakfast just walk out to Grafton street!!

",5,2016,10,08
203,Elegance & luxury,"I adore this hotel & cannot WAIT to stay again!
From the greeting at the front door, to the beautiful reception staff.... One step inside this gorgeous hotel & you simply feel special!
Well done to your lovely and very well trained staff, they are a credit to you. 
I'm looking forward to my visit on December 13th! ",5,2016,10,08
203,Beauty is only skin deep; Avoid front facing rooms,"The design is five star, from the menus to the flooring. The food and drinks are great at Wilde. BUT the service overall was not five star. The last straw first: NO front facing-room is quiet because the bar noise from the street booms away through double-paned windows and ear plugs. On the second night of noise, after another complaint, we were told that we'd asked for a front facing room. I don't know about that but I do know that I'd requested a quiet room at booking, reiterated the request at check-in and was assured that they gave me one. So why give me a room two down from the elevator and facing the bars? I'd have paid more for a quiet room at check-in if that had been explained and the option offered, but it wasn't. Was eventually offered another room but, at that point, the night before an early AM transatlantic flight, we just wanted to bury our heads under pillows, take some sleeping pills, and ride it out. Next morning took advantage of a lull at reception to check out because time was tight and we were tired. Room key was supposed to be left active so we could grab our stuff from the room but it wasn't. Another two elevator trips to reactivate key and return to room, and then a ridiculous wait for a taxi due to miscommunication between reception and main entrance.

Death by a thousand papercuts: Before being seated at high tea we were ordered to sit on an uncomfortable bench while they prepped a (lovely) table. I'd have rather waited at the greeter kiosk than perched at the side of a busy area on a bench. Another time waited about 15+ minutes while waitstaff argued over what drinks we'd ordered in the Gallery. Just check with us! All we'd really wanted was a quick drink at the Sidecar Bar which was closed for an event with no warning. One drink was atrocious but no one inquired as to why it remained untouched. Replacement drink still hadn't arrived ten minutes after ordering it. Took the attention of the Captain to get that. Another dozen little things that make me entirely disagree with the five stars. Wouldn't return without a significant reduction in cost to match the value.",3,2016,10,07
203,Unparalleled Service,"Booked this hotel based on the reviews here. We were not dissapointed. 
We arrived early, so the room wasn't ready yet. The desk clerk, Sophie, arranged for us to have complimentary tea and coffee in the lobby while we waited. Awesome! 

The room was spacious, and the beds are super comfortable. Awesome! 

On the second night we got to the room and there was a nice note with Wine and a tray of deserts.

Alexandra made arrangements for our afternoon tea. We requested a particular place to have it and they set it up perfectly. Don't even snack before afternoon tea... its so much food! No Calories!... just kidding about the calories :)

The staff took care of every request, they even mailed all my postcards!

Keelin, our waitress in Wilde, where we had breakfast every morning was a total pleasure to talk to. She always knew what we wanted, always great to talk to, and always had a smile on her face! 
The full Irish, the sausage, the bacon, the eggs all cooked to perfection. The best place to be seated is in the terrace, with views of the areas brick buildings. 

Balfes is a great bar located within the hotel. Ask Nicos to make you a drink for whatever your tastebuds require. Great conversation! And these guys know the area. Remember they're locals!

The location cannot be beat. You can get to the main sights(Temple Bar, Trinity, St Stephens Green, Leffey) in about a 10 min walk.

Guinness, Phoenix Park, St. Patricks, Kilmainham Gaol are all a 8-10 euro cab ride away.

Grafton St is at your doorstep.

This hotel is surrounded by great bars and restaurants, from old to new and every cuisine. I recommend going in the alleys to discover something a bit ""local"".

Special thanks also to Tommy the concierge, and Ashley the bellman.

From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave, you will have found the most pleasurable hotel experience. These guys are people people. It's all about the guest. Its something you don't find at every hotel. I can't even think of anything negative to write about!",5,2016,10,06
203,"Not impressed, especially for the price","The hotel was very nice and the bar was great, but the rooms were average and the price was astronomical.  This was our big splurge for our european trip and it was by far the most expensive and our least favorite accommodation (out of five).  I feel like we were completely ripped off and could have stayed somewhere just as nice for much less.  I was attracted to it through a blogger that posted beautiful photos in a room that must have been an exclusive luxury suite, nothing like what we stayed in.  I also found the lobby staff to be very pushy and aggressive on multiple occasions.  They insisted that we check our bags when our room was not yet ready and abruptly separated me from my husband when I said I wanted to change before checking bags and going out.  They didn't even give me a chance to discuss what type of attire with him let alone give us a second of privacy to discuss.  Very odd.  At least we only opted to splurge for one night, I don't think I could have handled more than that.",2,2016,10,06
203,Nice and comfortable stay,"This is a wonderful hotel, though pricey given the other options around Dublin. The service is excellent, staff extremely friendly and helpful, and breakfast is plentiful and high quality. Just a few paces from Grafton Street, you can't beat this location.",4,2016,10,06
203,A good choice in Dublin,"We debated where to stay for our first visit to Dublin and we're very glad we chose the Westbury. As others have noted, it's perfectly located on the main, pedestrianized shopping street. But even if shopping is not your interest (and it's not mine), it's 5-6 minutes to Trinity College, 10 minutes or less to Dublin Castle and very close to the Liffey and Temple Bar area. In other words, you won't need to use cabs much, unless you visit some of the sights further from the center. 

We opted for what they call a studio suite and it was quite spacious, with an extremely comfortable kingsized bed, a sitting area and a wall of windows. The bathroom was much smaller, but adequate to the purpose, and the heated towel bar proved helpful to quickly dry some hand wash. The hotel did turndown every night, so clean towels were always available, along with two bottles of water.  

Our room faced the front and on our first night, we were dismayed to discover we could hear, loudly, the musicians who play in the street for money. The hotel staff handled it nicely and moved us to a comparable room the next day that faced a back street. That was perfectly quiet and we slept very well after that. We stayed four nights in all. The breakfasts were ample, with good food and friendly, efficient service.  

It is a pricey choice, but no more so than others in the category, and the location gives it an advantage few other hotels have.",4,2016,10,05
203,Just not good enough for the price,"When you enter from ground level there are no signs to tell you where reception is (hint, it is up the steep stairs on level 1), and so if the various staff milling around are busy, you are left standing wondering what to do.  After working out where the reception was, I then had to wait over 11 minutes to be served.  There were two ladies on the desk, and one took at least 13 minutes to check out one customer because she was very involved in flirting with him, and giving her opinion on all the local restaurants (surely a job for the concierge when someone checks in, rather than for reception staff when someone is checking out).  I am sure he will probably leave a 5 star review.  The other lady walked off to do ... who knows what ...? The concierge steadfastly refused to acknowledge the queue in any way.  So we waited, a queue of four people by the time I was served, all watching the reception lady flirt and no one else acknowledge us.  Finally the absentee reception lady returned, and greeted me with ""Hello"".  No apology for my wait, no welcome to the Westbury....  Check-in was slow and inefficient, and she even took a call halfway through the process with no apology again, just held up one finger at me (I suppose to indicate I should just wait until she was ready).  When I was finally allocated a room on the second floor I vaguely remembered from a past stay that this was not ideal, and asked if any other room was available, preferably one that was quieter.  The lady serving me (Sophie, a trainee) had no idea where the room was located, so wandered off (again) to ask the concierge if he knew anything about it.  He shrugged so she came back and assured me that the room was indeed very quiet.  
So, up to the room, which was small and overheated with a very stained carpet.  It looked out over the strange flat roof area at the front of the hotel which has various industrial units and large lights on it.  As soon as it becomes dark the orange floodlights are turned on to light the front of the hotel, and at the same time, my room - bright orange floodlighting seeping around the curtains (which have gaps around the edges and top).  Bring your eyemask.  Oh, and bring your earplugs as from 7:30pm until after 9pm, it sounded like they were refurbishing the room above me by dragging around furniture, drilling, and generally banging around.    
I did call down and was assured there was no work going on, and it must just be other guests settling into their room (?!).  On checking out in the morning (another 15 minute wait this time), I did mention the issues, and was told I should call later in the day to talk to guest relations.  Needless to say, I didn't.  What is there to say that I had not already pointed out to 3 separate people, none of whom apologised or acknowledged a problem?  I felt I had wasted enough time, and tried all I could to sort things out before leaving a 1 star review.  For the prices they charge here, this warrants a 1 out of 5.  I would not return and am very happy to tell anyone who asks not to stay here.",1,2016,10,05
203,"Very nice hotel, perfect location","I absolutely loved the location of this hotel.  It is a block away from the train, and Trinity University and near all the high end shops.  It is a pleasant walk to the convention center if the weather is nice.  The room was very nice and even had an American power cord plug which was a pleasant surprise.  The lobby and lounge is very nice and they do Tea service on Sunday's.  They offer complementary bottled water in the rooms which is a nice perk.  The King size bed was two single beds pushed together which could be an issue if you are traveling as a couple.",4,2016,10,05
203,Debbie from Pennsylvania,"Exceptional hotel, staff and services. Had the pleasure of dining in Balfes for Breakfast and Dinner. Excellent  food and service. Good location of hotel.  Close to museums, churches and Trinity College,shopping and Temple Bar area,and other attractions in Dublin. Thank you",5,2016,10,05
203,"Good hotel, but small details lacking","First things first: The Westbury is great. Fantastic location, beautiful lobby, friendly staff, comfortable rooms. But you're paying a heavy premium compared to Dublin's relatively affordable hotel market. Because of that, this review focuses on what I think of as the ""small things"" that really should be absolutely flawless at this price point.  For reference, we stayed 3 nights in a ""deluxe double"" -- aka two queen beds.

(1) The air conditioner made a horrific buzzing noise every 5 minutes at night. This occurred even if the unit was off. It seemed to stop sometime around 3 or 4am, but picked up around 7pm... meaning you were guaranteed a night of buzzing.

(2) Wash clothes were taken, but not replaced, during room servicing. As they don't provide bar soap, only body wash in the showers, we had to go hunting for more.

(3) Ugly carts in the hallways. Not sure why they have service carts permanently stationed in the halls.

(4) Terrible pillows. The beds were quite comfortable, especially compared to the other three hotels we stayed at during our trip around Ireland. But the pillows were flat, flat, flat. For nearly $400 a night, I expect a good variety of firmnesses, foam and down, etc. Very disappointing and something that you wouldn't experience at, e.g., The Westin with its focus on premium bedding.

(5) Small bathroom. The room was huge, but the bathroom was tiny. Found it to be an odd choice of square footage.

Now, for the good:

(a) Breakfast was very tasty, and included.

(b) Room was quiet. You could just, a tiny bit, hear the rowdy crowds on Saturday night outside.  But that was forgivable as Dublin had just won the All-Ireland match.  I'm shocked it wasn't louder!

(c) Staff was incredibly friendly.

Bottom line: my list of negatives may seem nit-pitcky, but frankly at $375-400/night in Dublin you should expect perfection. These issues detract from what I think of as the ""magic"" of a five-star hotel -- you should be transported away from reality into an experience where everything is perfect. The Westbury was good, maybe even great, but it certainly was not perfect. If you're looking for 5 star, I'd consider another hotel. If you're okay with the price and willing to accept 4 star experiences, The Westbury's location makes it a prime candidate.",4,2016,10,04
203,Great hotel in a great location,Just stayed 3 nights at the Westbury.  This beautiful hotel is centrally located to almost everything.  The Air Coach from the airport to the Westbury costs only 7 Euro and puts you at the top of Grafton street - an easy walk even on a rainy day.  The staff was very kind and helpful.  The rooms were comfortable and very clean.  The turn down service even featured Butlers chocolate.  I could not have asked for a better experience.,5,2016,10,04
203,"Fabulous location, luxury hotel in the heart of Dublin","Fantastic bars and restaurants and a lovely elegant ambience here. Staff are very helpful and friendly.
Hotel room was nice but pricey for what it was, expected our room to be more spacious but, nevertheless I would recommend this hotel as a luxury.",4,2016,10,04
203,Very Impressive,"Received a lovely warm welcome and the food was yum! The room was very spacious and very clean. Lacked a little atmosphere though, some music would have been nice to listen to in the bar. Will definitely return.",4,2016,10,03
203,Wonderful Stay,"This was our first time to Ireland - we stayed two days at Westbury and it was very nice, comfortable clean and top notch breakfast! The croissants were unbelievable!  Close location to downtown Dublin!",5,2016,10,03
203,Mary,"The service and staff are most pleasant,polite and helpful. The room was more than adequate for one person. Great size with a lovely comfy bed. At last a hotel with correct sized towels - luxury. The location is right on the doorstep for shopping , restaurants and theatre, which was the reason for my visit. I just wish hotels including this one would install walk in showers. This would ensure a safe and relaxed shower without the hassle of climbing in and our of a high bath. Overall a great hotel to visit and a nice experience if a little overpriced.   ",4,2016,10,03
203,Amazing service!,"We just spent 4 nights at Westbury.  We can't say enough good things about the hotel. The hotel is what you would expect from a luxury hotel. The service though makes the hotel. We arrived prior to check in and our suite was not ready. Fine by us, it was 9am when we arrived. The staff saw we were tired from the overnight flight and gave us a room to sleep in for a few hours.  Way to go above and beyond. 

The hotel is a member of the fine resorts program with American Express. Typically we have to beg to ensure that we receive all of our benefits but not here. They want through all of them with us.  

We ate breakfast each morning at the hotel and the breakfast is a nice buffet followed up with hot made to order food as well. The food is excellent and there is plenty of it. 

We also ate our complimentary dinner at the other restaurant in the hotel. The complimentary menu is a smaller version of the full menu but there are still plenty of choices.  

We did have drinks in the bar one evening. Good selection of cocktails and again great service.  

We can't say enough about the service.  The hotel facility is what you would expect from a luxury brand but sometimes these brands don't have the staff to match up to your expectation. That is not the case with the Westbury. Every employee we encountered was wonderful. Great job! ",5,2016,10,02
203,Fantastic Hotel,"This hotel really made my Dublin trip so much better.  It was nice to come back to every night.

I've read other reviews complaining about the room size but I thought the room was bigger than most hotels around the world.  I stayed in a ""studio suite"" and I thought it was a decent size.  The only thing I could gripe about is it really had no view, but a view isn't anything to knock a star off for.",5,2016,10,02
203,Great stay at the Westbury,"From the time we stepped out of the taxi we were greeted with warmth and professionalism. A doorman offered to take our bags to our room. Reception is located on the 1st floor and check in was warm and professional. It seemed there wasn't anything they couldn't do for us. Our deluxe double room(307) has 2 twin beds and is huge by European standards. Upon our return after a short exploration of the city we came back to find a lovely card wishing us a happy anniversary and a cake. Our luggage was already in the room as well. Each time we entered and exited the hotel, we were greeted by the staff.
Turndown service is very professional and we got chocolate on our beds. The windows are also double glazed so we didn't hear a thing from the street below. The room faced the back of the hotel.
As we had early day trips planned for the mornings we arranged for breakfast in our room in the morning and it came in two trays with pastries, juice, tea and jams and yogurts.

Pro
Staff are warm and friendly. Great service from all members of staff.
Toiletries from Aromatherapy associates are lovely to use and very calming.
Fantastic location Close to Graftan St with all the shops and restaurants near by.
Great in room breakfast of pastries, juice, tea and fruit for those mornings with early morning tours to the cliffs of moher, giants causeway and Kerry.
Nice hot breakfast in the Wilde restaurant that is brought to you and a selection of pastries, juices and fruit for you to select from.
Lovely big room (deluxe double room).

Con
Charged 2500 as holding fee upon check in. However this was cancelled a few days after we checked out. We understand it is the norm nowadays but the amount is more than what we paid for the room.
There is no power point to plug the hair dryer into in the bath room. This seems to be the norm in Ireland.
Air conditioner unit in the room makes running water noises even when off.
Parts of the bathroom like the tap and towel rack are loose and probably need maintenance.",5,2016,10,01
203,Elegant but pricey considering room size,"Recently stayed here for a few nights while on a shopping trip to Dublin, initial first impression was odd as you have to go upstairs to get to the hotel lobby!  My room was elegant but small and the bathroom felt cramped.  Breakfast service was very slow during the weekend, it improved during weekdays when the number of guests was reduced.  The breakfast area itself was very pleasant and the prettiest part of the hotel I thought.  Staff were very friendly and the location couldn't be better for sightseeing or shopping. Overall It was pretty underwhelming.",4,2016,09,30
203,Fantastic!,I recently spent a Friday evening at the Westbury with some colleagues and business partners for a few drinks. The environment was welcoming and comfortable despite being busy. The staff are supremely attentive and couldn't do enough to make us comfortable. Service was swift at all times during the evening. The cocktail menu has something for everyone although I particularly enjoyed the Nacional Daiquiri. The Espresso Martini was also good. Would highly recommend.  ,5,2016,09,30
203,A little bit of heaven,"We popped in for  a quiet drink here last week. The staff were very attentive and friendly, but not in your space, . Comfortable surroundings . The atmoshere warm and relaxed. Just a little bit of heaven in a mad bustling city",5,2016,09,30
203,A great hotel with a staff that makes it wonderful.,"My wife and I spent 4 nights here on a recent trip.  We were both very pleased with the hotel and the staff.  It was a place that really made you feel welcome and comfortable.  It is centrally located and any easy walk to many different sights, pubs, shopping and restaurants.  For trips further away, both bus stops and train stations are within walking distance.
This was our first trip to Dublin and obviously our first tie at the Westbury, but I would happily pick this hotel again.  It was truly a great hotel.",5,2016,09,29
203,Superb Afternoon Tea,"A delightful afternoon in the gallery sitting beside a window in luxurious surroundings with 5 star service. Karl Byrne and his fantastic team understand the real meaning of quality service and Paula was brilliant. Afternoon tea is an occasion and the menu is delicious and elegantly served. Last but not least, the wheelchair accessible toilet in the business centre is fit for purpose (not all places can say this). I'm already looking forward to my next visit ",5,2016,09,29
203,Elegant hotel,"Elegance mixed with comfort and a feeling of a very cosy, beautifully spec'd out hotel. From the lobby to the rooms, elegantly decorated.
Staff were professional and helpful.
Food was also very tasteful, with a variety of great choices.",4,2016,09,28
203,Nice location ,"Stayed here our first night we showed up early in the morning and the gave us a room so we could get some sleep before sightseeing! A huge thumbs up for that
Great location away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to walk to everything ",4,2016,09,28
203,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"I recently spent 2 nights at the Westbury and was very impressed from the start when the concierge greeted us on the street with a warm welcome and offered to take all 4 of our heavy bags. The hotel is very tastefully decorated with a beautiful lobby/afternoon tea area next to the gorgeous Gatsby style cocktail lounge where we indulged in some delicious cocktails from an extensive menu. We were even given complimentary champagne to sip on while we waited. The deluxe king room was very large and comfortable with a pillow top mattress and big fluffy pillows. The bathroom was very opulent with it's marble decor and bidet! Complimentary robe and slippers added to the comfort. The service was exceptional throughout our stay and complimentary breakfast at the Wilde restaurant had an amazing selection and delicious food. The only minor complaints I may have would be that the gym facilities were pretty poor for a 5 star hotel, and although they offer use of a neighboring fitness centre and pool you have to pay extra to use that facility. I would also have appreciated a pillow menu option as although I enjoyed the soft pillows, my partner had trouble sleeping as he prefers a firmer pillow. All in all though, a very enjoyable experience, I would have been happy to stay in and enjoy the lovely room and not see Dublin at all! ",4,2016,09,28
203,Midtown luxury and ambience,"Superb hotel smack in the middle of the city. I may not be totally objective as we arrived on my wife's birthday and the hotel upgraded us to a junior suite with a nice view over Dublin. We had afternoon tea in the Terrace lounge, and one tip there: If you are not very - very - hungry, the pastry tower for two is more than adequate for three and enough for four people. We were ten and three tower trays were more than enough. We all  also had lunch one day in the hotel restaurant, a very pleasant experience with exceptionally friendly staff and good food. No need to search further really.",5,2016,09,27
203,Lovely hotel but I can't justify spending that much,A lovely hotel with wonderful staff. You couldn't ask for a better location. For me personally it's over priced. I feel for paying around ¬£300 a night they could have given us breakfast and the WiFi was on and off. ,4,2016,09,27
203,Beautiful Hotel In Central Location,"My husband and I stayed at the Westbury Hotel for three nights on our first leg of a European vacation. We received a warm welcome from each employee we encountered and the friendliness and willingness to help continued throughout our stay. The hotel is centrally located right off the beautiful Grafton Street, near Trinity College, shops, St. Stephen's Green, pubs and restaurants. We especially enjoyed being next door to Bruxelles! The hotel itself was modern, elegant and very clean. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2016,09,26
203,Westbury is outstanding hotel experience,"One of the finest hotel experiences we have had. Everything was impeccable, especially the service. Room size and furnishings, bathroom amenities, overall cleanliness, breakfast food and service, concierge service, location were all excellent. Absolutely no complaints, would return in a heartbeat. This hotel could be used as an example of what service can be, friendly, efficient, fast, knowledgable. Made you feel at home.",5,2016,09,26
203,Best Bartenders in Dublin at the sidecar bar,Come and have a drink if you are near the Westbury Hotel. Check out the head bartender Michal and his staff Cathal and Adrian's talents as they dazzles you while they create masterpiece cocktails. Try their signature drink a Belvedere vodka martini or a Lady P for something different. You won't be disappointed. ,5,2016,09,26
203,FANTASTIC HOTEL,We stayed here for 2 weeks and we didn't have one negative thing to say. Everything was superb from the tiniest detail. The room was first class as was the food and the staff were excellent. Highly reccommend.,5,2016,09,26
203,Perfect location perfect stay,Found the best price with a combined air trip through Expedia.  The location of the Westbury made it possible to walk to most locations. The rooms have a safe and plenty of space.  Beds comfy.  Breakfast can be included in some bookings.  We found that no matter what you ordered it cost the same as the full buffet.  So eat up! Checkin were very stuck up.  We were there for a short time and didn't have much luggage.  We were not greeted kindly.  But that is their problem. I got the price I wanted and enjoyed my stay.  The staff in the breakfast area are helpful and knowledgable and happy to share their favourite sites in Ireland!,5,2016,09,26
203,"Oh yes - great location, beautiful hotel","Stayed at the Westbury on a business trip and was mightily impressed.  Excellent location in the heart of Dublin, walking distance to most things and a stone's throw from Grafton Street. Also beautifully appointed; rooms nice and spacious, dining areas excellent.  Staff also great, and the breakfast was fabulous. 
When I come back to Dublin, this place is definitely top of my list.",5,2016,09,26
203,Disappointed,"Stayed here last year in September and had no problems. This year went back with my daughter and had several issues. First and foremost we were staying for six nights and were checked out by the hotel twice prematurely. Everyday we arrived back at the hotel after long days of touring only to be locked out of our room. We actually had our bill slipped under the door two days prior to leaving. Every time we were assured the problem was taken care of and it was not. It culminated in our arriving back to our room on our last night and we had not received housekeeping. The list of little problems was endless this trip and did not make for a great experience. The final bill had a 25 euro charge added to each night that no one could explain and ended up being taken off in the end. We loved the Westbury in the past, but will be rethinking our stay there in the future.",2,2016,09,25
203,Slowwwwww service!!!!!,"Decided to go for a drink before retiring for the night!!! Sat and waited, and waited, and waited!!!!! The hotel is beautiful, relaxed atmosphere, however, we nearly died of thirst waiting to be served!!! Not what you expect of a 'top class joint'!!!!!!",2,2016,09,25
203,Exemplary and friendly service in the mezzanine level lounge,"Excellent and friendly service here last night when visited with two friends for drinks on the mezzanine level lounge. The drinks menu was very extensive and included a huge selection of fabulous gin cocktails, a few of which we tried. A fantastic waitress called Roisin was so lovely. On finding it was one of my friends birthdays, she brought out a gorgeous dessert (on the house). Exemplary. Not my first time here and won't be the last!",5,2016,09,25
203,"Perfect location, great overall","Stayed at the Westbury for 3 nights in Sep, 2016. The location is perfect, right off of Grafton St, shops, restaurants, pubs, sightseeing, all steps away.  Great service, rooms were impeccable. I would recommend to anyone, worth the price!",5,2016,09,25
203,Modern hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Beautiful hotel with excellent high end accommodations and service right in the heart of the best of Dublin's restaurants, pubs and shopping. Great place for a business meetings, lunch or tea. Recommend.",4,2016,09,24
203,Fantastic afternoon tea and brilliant service,"We were recommended the West bury afternoon tea so we decided to try it. The experience was well worth it all the way through. We can't praise the staff high enough - all of them were just brilliant and professional, always smiling and attentive. Big thank you to Deize, Mary and Rosa - you girls are awesome!! The sandwiches, scones and cakes were delicious and so many that we couldn't eat them all so had the remaining boxed to take with us. The choice of tea is extensive and the teas are lovely. We highly enjoyed our experience - a must try! Thank you!",5,2016,09,24
203,Great Hotel with great lobby,"We have been to Dublin several times before. This time we decided to stay in the Grafton neighborhood where all the good bars and restaurants are. We chose the Westbury because it is located in the middle of Grafton. Great decision.
Our room was large and comfortable. No sitting couch but there were 2 comfortable upholstered chairs. The here was a good flat screen TV however it did not have closed caption. The king bed was not as comfortable as we have found in most better hotels. The shower in the bathtub is a challenge because it is hard to get into the tub. Also getting out is tricky because the floor in the bathroom is lower than the bottom of the tub so you step down further than you expect, 
I found that the A/C did not blow the cold air far because it does not blow toward the bed., A small fan on the floor would have helped a lot to move the air all around the room. 
We had breakfast and dinner room service during our stay which we found very food.which was 
The lobby which is one floor above the street entrance is terrific. It has an extra large sitting area which offers both food and drink, It has 2 wonderful restaurants off the lobby and a nice bar just off the lobby as well. There is wifi in lobby and the guest rooms
The elevator goes to the ground floor street entrance. For safety you need your room key to get the elevator to go to the upper floors. For visitors there is a staircase to the lobby. The hotel has a garage but I do not recommend  driving yourself around the Dublin traffic.",5,2016,09,24
203,Excellent location,"Travelling with a friend, the twin beds we requested were very narrow in a very small room.  The room was very cramped though it had everything we needed. The location of this hotel is superb, close to sights, shopping and restaurants. We enjoyed the full and delicious breakfasts, included with our room rate. The service was great - all staff very courteous and helpful. Restaurants were very good.

203,"Great hotel, great location, and Michal Lis and The Marble Bar have the best drinks in Dublin","The Westbury is right in the middle of the City Centre, just a quarter block from Grafton Street, moments from countless pubs and restaurants (several of which are in the Michelin guide) and just five minutes from Trinity College.  The hotel itself is elegant and comfortable.  Rooms are higher end.  Service is warm.  My wife and I relied on the concierge for a breakfast, a dinner, and pre-dinner drinks, and we were never steered wrong.  

But I really wanted to write this review to praise Michal Lis, head bartender at the Marble Bar inside the Westbury.  I love a good cocktail.  I have a generous collection of bitters at home, cocktail recipes lifted from some of the best bars in the USA, and more liquor than most bars in New Orleans.  I have to repeatedly reassure my family that I drink responsibly, and much prefer quality over quantity.

Which brings me to Michal Lis.  At first glance at the bar menu, you'd never know that you've stumbled into the bar of a champion mixologist and bartender.  I don't use the word ""champion"" lightly.  He's gone head to head in competitions with bartenders across Ireland and Europe and won.  

We discovered that we were in the company of a master cocktail artist after the second night at the Westbury when my wife decided to cyber stalk our charming, generous bartender.  Google him - you'll discover it for yourself.

This is no ordinary hotel bar.  Just watch Michal make a martini, or an old fashioned, and you'll see impeccable technique and attention to detail.  You get a show and a fantastic drink, so long as you're paying attention.  

After our first night, I just told Michal it was ""dealer's choice"" on the drinks.  I never had the same drink twice, except when I asked for it, and I was blown away time and again.  ""Give me something with tequila.""  ""Let me try something with cognac."" Of course, my wife and I both ordered his award-winning drinks a few times.  

Michal and the rest of the Marble Bar staff are all friendly and cool.  I got to talk drinks with Michal every night, and he very generously pretended that I was remotely as knowledgeable as him.  It was a great nightcap every evening.  

The last night of our trip, my wife instructed Michal to bring out ONLY champagne cocktails, and that he could stop when she told him to.  Four drinks later, she declared her champagne cocktails the best drinks she'd ever had.  A slight blow to my ego, but I couldn't disagree.

I'm sure you get the idea.  After fantastic days exploring Dublin and eating world class food, we felt like we'd discovered the hidden jewel of Dublin every night.  It's well worth exploring whether you're staying at the Westbury or not.  Don't be afraid to start up a conversation with the staff or with Michal, and make sure to ask for his award winning drinks.",5,2016,09,22
203,"SLOW service, variable breakfast","We waited about 25 mins in a not busy breakfast bar for our food. On enquiring, we were told we would be served in 7 (!) mins. 7 mins came and went and on enquiring again, the manager spoke to us. She apologised and said the kitchen was busy as it cooked for several restaurants while acknowledging this was not acceptable. She offered us a free drink which was great, if rather late in the day. An earlier intervention - and initial advice of the likely delay would have been great. The oatmeal pancakes with fruit/honey were delicious while the porridge, alas was just acceptable - take a few lessons from Pret who make consistently great - and inexpensive - porridge!! Coffe was good too. So, largely good food but too long a wait - in a very good hotel.",3,2016,09,21
203,Last two days in Ireland,Great hotel.  The room we had was very comfortable.  I wish they had a rubber mat for inside the bathtub.  The location is super. There is a pedestrian way right on Grafton Street that has all kinds of shops and street performers.  The Side Car bar offers nice food choices and excellent service.  We were waited on by Adrian at the bar and Cathal  at a table.  They were both very attentive and personable.,5,2016,09,20
203,Wonderful Location in Dublin,"We spent a total of three nights at The Westbury, two nights when we first arrived in Ireland and then again the last night before flying home and had a very enjoyable time during both stays.  We had lovely rooms (273 and 233) and the people throughout the hotel couldn't have been nicer or more helpful.  We would highly recommend the hotel and also their restaurant, Balfes where we had excellent fish and chips and the best goat cheese salad ever!",5,2016,09,20
203,Business friendly ,I spent 3 nights at this well located hotel. The service was excellent and business traveler friendly. The lobby bar is relatively small (a good thing!)and a wonderful place to relax. Make sure to inquire about views from your Room-as there are limitations. ,4,2016,09,19
203,Don't stay here.,Stains on carpet and rust stain in bathtub. Terrible Internet service. Highly overpriced room. Furniture poorly laid out and condition. Confusion regarding rate conditions on check-in. Positives are location and breakfast service.,1,2016,09,19
203,Great location - Even Better Stay,Another great stay after 2 years. Recommend breakfast. Would not recommend driving as parking looked quite chaotic. Staff are great throughout the hotel with great perspective on orientation & restaurants. ,5,2016,09,18
203,Anniversary weekend,"We stayed at the Westbury for our 25th Wedding anniversary. This hotel is very close to Grafton Street and all the shopping anyone could want. McDaids on the corner is worth a visit if you enjoy a great pint of Guinness. They have a valet service for anyone with a car to park and the concierge is very helpful. 
The hotel is very nice inside and all the staff are very helpful and courteous. The cocktail bar is great and can be busy in the evenings. We only had breakfast in the hotel as we were dining elsewhere at night. The breakfast was great with enough options to suit everyone's taste. 
We had a wonderful stay and look forward to visiting again sometime soon.",5,2016,09,18
203,First class hotel.  Perfect location.,"The location is perfect. Great pub outside called McDaids.  The room was spacious and very comfortable bed.  Overall service was outstanding except for the waitresses during breakfast.  We had breakfast included with our room and it was delicious. However the service was lacking on both days.  It took a lon time before we were greeted at our table, no one asked if we liked our meals and never offered more coffe or tea.  Our plates were not cleared after we finished eating.  I was surprised at this level of service in a 5 star hotel.  All other service was excellent.  With that said, I would still highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,09,18
203,Another Successful Stay,"I visited the Westbury again just after Labor Day for four days.  I had a comfortable room on the second floor out in front.  The staff, as usual, was wonderfully helpful and pleasant.  I had a delicious Irish Stew in Balf's Pub on the ground floor.  The breakfast were quite delicious.  I had the full Irish breakfast most days -- you can't really get this at home!  The light and dark puddings (hagis sausage) were as tasty as ever.  Whatever type of eggs I ordered came out perfectly.  I just find the food in Ireland - especially eggs and dairy - much richer and more flavorful than what I experience generally in the United States.  The offices for my business meetings are only a block and a half away.  There are plenty of interesting restaurants and pubs in the area.  It's a wonderful place to stay.",5,2016,09,17
203,Clean spacious and convenient ,We stayed for a weekend in this lovely hotel. It's in the heart of Dublin so an excellent location for sight seeing and eating out. Spacious room well maintained with all bathroom amenities. Only criticism is my husband and I found the bed a bit small (it was a queen and it did say this when we booked). Breakfast was expensive so we tended to eat out nearby. ,4,2016,09,16
203,Tech Game,"Four nights here for the Ga. Tech v. Boston College game. Best location in all of Dublin. A fine hotel and well run. Great staff and in the middle of everything Dublin has to offer. It is not quite the Merrion, but it's location makes up for it. 
Had a great visit and a wonderful room. ",5,2016,09,15
203,"service, location and elegant value","The service was attentive, friendly and helpful and the room was modern and  generous size with multiple amenities and total comfort. Morning breakfast great value, selection and service. Location central to walk everywhere  ",5,2016,09,15
203,Great location,"Great location, very close to Trinity College.  Started with Excellent service at reception, followed by a complimentary tray of desserts and a bottle of white wine.  Received an upgraded room at check in.  Very clean room with lots of amenities and extras. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2016,09,15
203,Dublin Good location,"A very nice hotel located close to Trinity College and walking streets. All kinds of restaurants and stores you can walk to. The hotel rooms are very comfortable. The hotel has an excellent breakfast. 
",5,2016,09,15
203,Hotel for the wheelchair patron,"The visit to Dublin for a College Reunion was the first time my wife and I had ventured out of our home since her stroke 9 months previously.  I studied the city centre hotels that allowed us to be within walking distance of our destination.
The room was average, albeit smaller than expected for a facility that advertised wheelchair access.  I was unable to use the transfer device to move my wife from wheelchair to bed, due to there being no space under the bed.  So I carried my wife to the bed - great when I was 20 but not at 60!  I feel sure this could be easily rectified.  The shower room was a standard hotel room size with a chair to facilitate a shower.  A small ramp was present to allow access to the shower .  I did not try but I doubt that the transfer device would have been able to deal with this sharp incline.

The location at the top of Grafton St was excellent for our purposes. Good wheelchair access within the hotel. The hotel staff were outstanding in terms of transfer of luggage to the room, reception facilities and general courtesy.  On one occasion the restaurant manager came to our room to apologise for forgetting to bring breakfast.  This was a genuine error which he admitted - I was impressed.
The hotel itself with staff was a good experience but the room was not suitable for a person who is wholly wheelchair bound - small, incorrect bed for transfer and an unattractive vista over what I think were the kitchens. The shower room would need to be larger and the incline to shower is an obstacle.  It is not a wet room.

Dublin is Dublin and always overpriced but this was an outrageous cost.  440Euro for B&B and a further 25 Euro for overnite parking - this surely should be waived given that a wheelchair vehicle was a requirement. This  is the worst price  I have ever experienced in years of travel.  For this I expect perfection.

So, I regard that the Westbury needs to review wheelchair accessible facilities and aim to achieve the gold standard.",4,2016,09,14
203,Best location in Dublin,Great location off Grafton Street for shopping with plenty of great pubs all serving food. Also great chioce of restaurants all within 10 min walk. Great service in hotel with a lovely bar or if you prefer a lounge area where you can also sit with a drink. A bit pricy but worth it for a short break. Worth booking a car park online to make some savings. The St Stephens Green car park is less the 5 min walk from hotel,5,2016,09,14
203,Excellent Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"We recently stayed at the Westbury Hotel and were impressed with the beautiful building and amazing staff. This hotel is walking distance to many of the key spots in Dublin, making it the perfect place to stay.",5,2016,09,14
203,fantastic in the center of Dublin,What a great hotel.  every need taken care of promptly.  good food and drink.  over 200 employees taking care to see that your happy.  kind of expensive but the center of Dublin so you can simply walk anywhere you want to go.  we forgot something in the room on sunday and came back next sunday and they still had it waiting for us.  great place and very conscious about peoples food allergies.  they took great care of my wife.  look out the front window and you see pubs and shops and a bustling city.,5,2016,09,13
203,First class experience,"We chose the Westbury because it appeared to be in the center of everything, and it was. We walked to Trinity College, Temple Bar, the Liffey, The Dublin Castle etc. Many high end shops are nearby, as well as restaurants.   Our advice in Dublin is to park your car and walk.  There is valet parking.  Everyone was helpful.  Our room was comfortable and luxurious.  It was a splurge for us price wise, but worth it.",5,2016,09,12
203,Perfection on  every level,"My Husband and I recently stayed at this outstanding hotel in the heart of Dublin for two nights.
Our room was upgraded to a suite upon arrival and the front desk staff could not have been more attentive . 
The staff especially our concierge John and Ashley as well as the reception desk staff Lucy and Shelly were kind courteous and delightful to chat with offering many helpful tips for our stay in Dublin, including suggesting the some of the best restaurants nearby  The even arranged for a  horse and carriage ride for us on our second evening which arrived within minutes !! .The food in the less formal of the two restaurants(on the lower level)  in the hotel was superb, 
Our suite was magnificent and appointed with every possible amenity. There was special turndown service and the housekeeping staff attended to our every wish..
I would highly recommend this  exceptional hotel for your next stay in Dublin",5,2016,09,11
203,Great hotel in a fantastic location ,"Great hotel in a fantastic location that I recommend when visiting Dublin. It's right next to Grafton Street and a slew of nice restaurants. The room was clean but a bit dated. Our door was sticking and I had to smash it with my shoulder to get it open. They said it was that way because it was heavy. Anyway, it was very annoying. The room was nice but in need of update. Overall, it was a great experience. The Sidecar Bar was very cool for a drink. ",4,2016,09,11
203,"Lovely, as usual","We stayed for one nite during our holidays. The reception staff were excellent considering they were busy. Our room was nice but I hate stepping into the bath to have a shower. Good sized bedroom. Turn down service and chocolates was a nice touch, nespresso machine and full mini bar.  Room service was excellent, silver service ice cream with edible flowers and fruit, lovely. The bar staff were excellent as was lunch. We ate in the restaurant downstairs, perfectly cooked steak. Lovely. Comp water on checkout was a nice touch. I would recommend a visit as its a great location.",4,2016,09,10
203,Real quality and excellent location,"We enjoyed our stay at the Westbury.  Fantastic location to visit the city with everything on your doorstep.  The staff were faultless, the room was well appointed and very comfortable and we enjoyed an excellent breakfast.",5,2016,09,09
203,Great headquarters for touring Dublin!,"Attracted by the location and positive reviews, we chose this hotel for a family visit to Dublin.  The hotel and its staff were very positive experiences and we would recommend the hotel to others visiting Dublin and looking for a comfortable, clean and well located venue to walk the city.  Staff was very helpful and friendly and we wish to acknowledge their fantastic assistance when we left our passports in the room safe and they quickly had them transported to us at the airport.",5,2016,09,08
203,Fabulous hotel,"My husband and I spent our Anniversary in the Westbury hotel. The staff were all so helpful in every way. A lovely desert was left in our room when we were out wishing us a Happy Anniversary. What a lovely gesture. The bed was the most comfortable we ever experienced in a hotel. Everything about this hotel is first class from decor, staff and food to location. The variety on the menu for breakfast was fantastic and all of the food tasted just as good as it looked! Couldn't give it a higher recommendation. If you want a special visit to Dublin stay in The Westbury, it is unforgettable. We'll definitely be back.",5,2016,09,08
203,Pure Class,"Top tier stay, service, and location. Why not go for the golden egg and treat yourself to an over the top stay in the center of Dublin. Bad reviewers must be aliens who have experienced locations that don't exist on earth. I am not sure it is wise to get used to staying in a place like this. With that said, I hope to return someday.",5,2016,09,08
203,Top Notch,"Beautiful, charming hotel with an excellent staff.  Very good location for walking to pubs, restaurants, shopping and tourist sites.  Locals know exactly where it is - which is good because Dublin is a bit tricky to navigate. 
Bed was very comfortable, strong wifi signal, plenty of counter space in the bathroom, plush linens, robes and slippers.  We had a street view which was lovely but not loud.  
Great stay - highly recommend.",5,2016,09,08
203,Lunch treat,"I brought my daughter here for lunch which was a treat while we were in Dublin for a short shopping trip. We were delighted with our meals and the service was exceptional. 
Next time we might have the High Tea as it looked wonderful. ",5,2016,09,07
203,Anniversary Celebrations,"The hotel staff could not have done any more to make our stay as enjoyable as it was. Every t was crossed and i was dotted by the guest relations and turn down team. They really went above and beyond. 

The room itself was stunning. The bed was extremely comfortable and every luxury you could wish for was provided. 

The breakfast in the morning was impossible to fault. Their was something to cater for everyone's tastes and requirements and the setting was beautiful.

I would highly recommend the Westbury to anyone looking to stay in Dublin City Centre.",5,2016,09,07
203,Beautiful hotel,"after a long day it was wonderful to be welcomed with a gorgeous aromatherapy smelling towel to wipe our face and hands and ease us into the hotel. The check in was swift and fast and our luggage was bought to the room promptly. I was embarrassed as I didn't have cash to tip
And the porter impressed spin us that it wasn't necessary. 
The room was beautiful the carpets lush and the bed linen crisp silky and soft. Feather pillows topped of a besutiful bed 
The aromatherapy products in the bathroom a bonus with big fluffy towels to wrap yourself in. 
The aircon was fantastic and it was really hot and muggy outside so it was a bit of an oasis. 
I definitely would stay here again",5,2016,09,07
203,"A nice hotel, A great bar","The rooms were nice, modern, and the staff quite attentive and helpful. Great location right off of Grafton Street and very convenient to Trinity College, the GPO and Temple Bar. The hotel bar was quite enjoyable as well. We first went there just to meet some people, but ended up becoming regulars on our trip (even while staying at a different hotel), as we really enjoyed a break from the Guinness with some of their very nice cocktails.",5,2016,09,06
203,Great Staff small rooms,"The top items for this hotel is their Staff and location. As a top rated 5-star hotel I feel that the rooms are not up to par with the other hotels within this price range.  The rooms show minimum amount of style and individualization and are small.  It was difficult to work at the desk as the side chairs were tight up to the desk chair. If you want to minimize the amount of noise, ask for a room on the back side of the hotel (odd Numbers).  In the front you can hear the noise that come from the two pubs right outside.",3,2016,09,06
203,Our weekend at The Westbury,We recently spent three nights at the beautiful The Westbury hotel. Great location. Incredible staff. Very quiet room even though you're in a busy part of town. Less than a minute to Grafton Street with all of its entertainment.,5,2016,09,06
203,A classic...,This hotel is what it is... A classic with a great location & service. It's not entirely my favourite style as I tend to go for a modern designer hotel or a smaller boutique but we had a one night stay in Dublin and it was great. ,4,2016,09,05
203,Ireland trip,"It was our first stop in Ireland.  The front desk staff was exceptional!  Friendly, helpful and welcoming!  The restaurants they recommended were fabulous!  The location is right in the heart of everything but still quiet and very elegant!  It was a wonderful 3 nights!",5,2016,09,05
203,Excellent service & location - You get what you pay for,"Stunning hotel, excellent staff, excellent location. Breakfast left a little to be desired but the coffee made up for it! Beautiful! I would definitely return as I felt that the price of the hotel reflected the standard that is set here, prestigious and luxury.",5,2016,09,05
203,Great Stay,"The Westbury is probably the best overall hotel in Dublin in terms of location and level of service.  The location cannot get any better being a short walk from Grafton Street, St Stephens Green and Temple Bar area.  The level of service provided at the hotel is excellent. Everyone we encountered was friendly and focused on customer service.  Food in all the restaurants was delicious too. The only reason I cannot give 5 stars is the Wifi service was not strong in the rooms and kept booting me off of network. The wifi was fine in the lobby, but once we went to our room service was either not available or very weak.  This caused some issue when trying to stay current on work emails.  One other item that I was not pleased about is that there was not an electrical outlet in the bathroom that can support a hair dryer.  I understand it is common in Europe to not have outlets in the bathroom but it was difficult to dry my hair in front of a mirror above the desk in my room.  We did not book a front facing room and our room was a bit on the dark side, even with the curtains open, especially before daylight or when it was raining (which is frequently).  We would probably stay at the Westbury on our next trip to Dublin. I'll just pack an extension cord so my hair dryer can reach the bathroom.  ",4,2016,09,05
203,GT Game,This is a fantastic hotel. They really cater to your every need. From the bellman at the front door to the person on the desk to the people in Wildes for breakfast they are super. Make you feel welcome.,5,2016,09,03
203,A good weekend in Dublin,"Room was lovely. Very comfortable , clean and welcoming..Staff were very helpful. We arrived on an early flight and they looked after our luggage so we could go out unencumbered.
Breakfast was a bit farcical.We were directed to a table on the first morning and the service and breakfast were fine, if a little slow.
The following day dreadful doesn't really describe it. Little if anything in the buffet section, no orange juice. I asked if I could have some and initially was ignored and then - well I think they must have been waiting for the or ages to grow. The table service was slow and the food merely tepid when it arrived.
Part from that that it didn't diminish our overall enjoyment of our stay. We would certainly return.",4,2016,08,31
203,Overall a nice stay if a little disappointed ,"My husband and i stayed in The Westury for a 2 night stay at the beginning of August. We were very warmly greeted by the doorman and valet man who happily took our keys and promised our luggage would be sent to our room without delay. Check in was friendly and seemless and all the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. The room was nice, nothing too luxurious about it (considering 5* status & price) although the bed was very comfy. 

We left the Hotel on our first morning and were out of the hotel for around 4.5 hours only to come back for a rest to find our room had not been serviced. Was quite disappointed with this. About an hour later a member of staff came to the door to service the room which for us was a disturbance so we didnt bother. Then another hour passes and another knock asking us if our room had been serviced. I found this somewhat odd. 

Another sticking point for me was having to pay 25 euro per night for parking. Considering the room rate you'd imagine parking would be complimentary or even charge 25 euro for the two nights

Fabulous location, couldn't be better for grafton st and stephens green and the surrounds

Not sure I'd stay again to be honest but it was an enjoyable enough stay but those couple of points above have put me off ",3,2016,08,30
203,Beautiful Hotel Smack Dab in the middle of Dublin City Centre,The Westbury is an immaculate facility that is perfectly located off of the pedestrian area of Grafton Street and the beautiful St. Stephen's Green park. The staff was very friendly and brought a personal touch to every interaction. I actually felt like every staff member cared about my experience and comfort.,5,2016,08,29
203,excellent class hotel,"We found the hotel with ease after some good directions from the hotel. Pulled up out front of the hotel and were met by door man/concierge who welcomed us to the hotel. Took our bags in to reception for us and parked the car.
Checkin was smooth and felt very welcomed by the lady at reception who explained everything we needed to know.
We were given a room on the fifth floor overlooking the front of the hotel and even though the two bars out front were packed with early evening drinkers sitting out in the Sun we could hear no noise through the window
The room was very nicely decorated and seemed to have been refurbished recently. 
Room had everything you would expect from good 5 star hotel with excellent black out blinds, good tv and movie selection, mini bar, espresso machine, very comfortable pillows and bed, air con, etc.
Unfortunately we did not eat in the restaurant as we had made reservations else where. 
However we did have breakfast the next morning and although it was very busy we were seated quickly. Service was very good (we had a waiter called Sean...I think) and food was excellent. Check out was very efficent.
From start to finish we were well looked after and hotel is a real credit to the staff and management",5,2016,08,29
203,OVER THE TOP SERVICE!!,"I booked a girls trip to Dublin last minute and asked Amex platinum services for a recommendation: The Westbury.  I am so glad they did.  If you want the best food, finest bartenders, and most gracious service in town -- run do not walk -- to the Westbury!!!  The views are spectacular, rooms gorgeous the cocktails hand crafted and it is located right in heart of the City. A very gracious thank you to Paul and to Joseph and the entire lovely and lively staff for the hospitality, you made our trip.  Don't miss the Afternoon Tea or the expresso martini. A+",5,2016,08,28
203,Great Hotel,"This hotel was great.  Every aspect of the service was amazing, every detail was attended to, and there was staff everywhere smiling and waiting to help.  I'm not sure it had any local charm, but if you're looking for a great hotel with exceptional service, this is the place.  

The location is terrific, and the level of service and accommodations would be right at home as a fine hotel in NYC.  I'm so glad we chose The Westbury.",5,2016,08,28
203,Great Location & Beautiful Hotel,"The Westbury did not disappoint us on our 2nd return to this luxurious hotel.  We were met with a very friendly staff.  Although our room was not ready, our luggage was quickly secured so we could start our day in Dublin.  

The Westbury is located in a great location with easy walking access to great shopping and pubs.  A great variety of restaurants are also in the immediate vicinity.  Grafton Street is a short block away while Temple bar and OConnell Street are only 5-10 minutes away by foot.

The car valet went well out of his way adjusting our GPS and finding us a map for our next destination.

Our room was beautiful.  It was full of amenities and very luxurious.  Although we didn't eat or drink at the hotel's bars & restaurant this time, we enjoyed the restaurant & bar last year.",5,2016,08,28
203,The Potential is There,"I really wanted to love this hotel. This was our first stop on our Ireland/London trip and the least favorite of the places we stayed.

As many reviewers have noted, the hotel is perfectly located - close to Grafton Street and St. Stephens Green and within walking distance of many other key sites in Dublin.  The bell staff were always smiling and friendly and taxis were plentiful outside the door.  The windows were thick, allowing for a good night's sleep despite the energy and crowds just a few steps from the doors.  Food and service in Wilde (for breakfast) was wonderful.  And they even allowed me to charge stamps to my room so I could mail postcards.

But once inside the hotel, the service fell off quickly.  The front desk seemed utterly confused as to when our room would be available.  We had paid for an upgraded room and were given a handicapped room.  While it was very roomy, the layout was odd and the bathroom tiny and uninviting.  We did not receive turndown service one of the nights we were there.  I had a small personal emergency on the day we were departing and the front desk/concierge did not have anything on hand to assist me and instead sent me to a local drug store which was closed at the time due to the bank holiday.  Everything simply seemed ""off"".  

We loved Dublin but would consider another hotel on a future visit.",3,2016,08,27
203,After fade street,Yep we kept going and ended the evening here . Great hotel great staff martinis mixed at table very good . Cocktails galore and reasonable . Staff excellent always a pleasure to return here . You pay for quality and you get it here,5,2016,08,27
203,Great location and comfortable elegance,"I've stayed at The Westbury several times for business and always look forward to my stay as I know it will be pleasant and comfortable.  The hotel is in a fantastic location that allows you to walk and take in the sights, shops, and parks.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The only thing that seems a bit odd to me is I always have to ask for wash cloths after the first night.  For some reason they don't replace them.  But they are always quick to bring them when I ring housekeeping.

No reason to try a different hotel for me.",4,2016,08,27
203,"Nice drinks, rude bar staff. ","What can I say that the title doesn't already say. 
Had drinks here recently. Nice surroundings but bar staff were unfriendly and unhelpful. 
Drinks were good but pricey ++
The lounge is nice but lacks any charm or personality. 
There are better places to drink in Dublin ",3,2016,08,27
203,Top location in Dublin,I would go again if I visit Dublin. From Breakfast to Lunch to the evening BAR (Top IRISH Coffee :-) ) everything is top quality. For sightseeing and as well for shopping top located. Stuff and reception very friendly and always helpful. Room was very nice. Perfect for a City trip. ,5,2016,08,26
203,"Old world charm, great location",Beautiful lobby and sitting areas. Great location on lively Grafton St. Walking distance to many sites. Taxis readily available outside the entrance. Breakfast buffet and hot menu items delicious and served in a comfortable porch/lounge setting,4,2016,08,25
203,My new FAVORITE hotel!,"Wow.....what an amazing hotel!!!  Awesome location smack dab in the middle of Dublin with the beautiful little alleyways of shops, restaurants and pubs.  Walking distance to everything including Trinity College, St. Stephen's Green, Dublin Castle and many more places.  The hotel is large and beautifully decorated.  The rooms are lovely, clean and nice and quiet!  The lobby area is gorgeous with great sitting areas, restaurants and a great restaurant/bar called Balfes.  The staff could not be more helpful.  I can't wait to go back!!!!",5,2016,08,25
203,Perfect Balance of Luxury and Comfort Sprinkled with Great Service  ,"Location, luxury, service, ....oh, I could go on and on.  It was our second trip to Dublin, using our hotel as our base for numerous side trips. Frankly, we were so disheartened by another Dublin hotel ( HIGHLY recommended on TripAdvisor) during our first visit to the city, that we approached the Westbury with lack luster spirits . We figured we'd be fooled again. Our private driver from Galway pulled up to the hotel and our heart rate quickened. Could the reviews this time around be right? Could this be a real honest to goodness great hotel? Certainly its location was perfect. As we proceeded to check in and settle into our rooms, we all thought......Oh , thank the heavens, YES! This IS a great hotel. It Is beautiful inside. The rooms ARE lovely. The staff is both professional, efficient, respectful AND friendly!!! Undoubtedly it is due to the fine management of Mr. Vincent O'Gorman. This gentleman runs a tight ship yet never forgets to richly indulge his guests. Our every whim was addressed. I had his prompt personal attention when I needed guidance. The Westbury was magnificent. It was immaculate and lush. Our adult party of 6 were there on vacation and we really felt we were all treated with the utmost respect and graciousness. I write many reviews so I do intentionally observe how other guests are treated at hotels in case my own experience is an anomaly. Reception was impeccable to all new guests. As you might imagine, guests come in all types of interesting packages. Their needs were met. With the vast assortment of Dublin hotel choices available, even with ""great "" reviews, one could still bomb with a hotel choice. Trust me on the Westbury. Make it your destination residence while in Dublin. You WILL be delighted. ",5,2016,08,25
203,Old fashioned courtesy with a smile,"We stayed here the last weekend in July, with nine others, and from the minute we stepped out of the taxi the staff couldn't have been more helpful. The hotel was beautiful, full of white flowers,friendly and relaxed but with very attentive service. The room didn't have much of a view but was very central, well-appointed and we especially liked having both wine glasses and beakers, even in the bathroom, made from cut glass. Each room had its own iron and ironing board which saved having to summon one from housekeeping. The bed was huge and very comfortable and even though our room faced the lift there was minimal corridor noise.  We ate two breakfasts and one dinner in the hotel. My husband said the eggs were fantastic and I enjoyed the fruit and bacon with tomatoes. Service again was excellent. My husband knocked the table and some of my tea ended in my saucer and immediately a sharp- eyed waiter produced a dry one for me. It was a wonderful weekend's stay and we would love to return.",5,2016,08,24
203,Few days break,"This hotel was exellent service very friendly the room was lovely 
It was situated in a good location for my self & my daughter  love the. City of Dublin so much to do love the sight seeing  and the friendly people that made you welcome hopefully will be going again next year.",5,2016,08,24
203,3 nights in Dublin,"Hotel is very centrally located, with easy and convenient access to all sights. I would normally have given 4 stars, given that the facilities are slightly tired, but the staff at all levels - from check in, to bars to restaurants - was so good I had to upgrade to 5 stars.
can certainly recommend the hotel for either business or pleasure.",5,2016,08,24
203,Great location,"Booked at the last moment as had a business meeting on a Thursday morning early. Location is great, arrived at 9 pm shot out to Fresca Restaurant on Chatham St. The room was well appointed, shower was good and powerful and aircon quiet. Little things like pencils in the room rather than pens let it down a tad in my opinion but only nit picking. Breakfast was sumptuous and as we were in early fresh and hot. Location is the biggest attraction about this hotel and valet parking included. Will return. ",4,2016,08,23
203,Average Hotel,"An average hotel, with very attentive staff.  Hotel is located 17 minute taxi from airport, 6 minute walk to Temple bar district, 35 minute walk to Heuston train station (to Galway, Kilkenny), 25 minute walk to Connolly Station (get to Belfast).  Hotel is also 1 block from main pedestrian street. Rooms were quiet but unfortunately we had bad luck and got a room with a faulty AC which hissed even when turned off and did not work to cool room.  Bed is also 3 steps from door, which I found strange, bathroom was a little dirty, toilet fixture broken, faucet loose and hot water did not function correctly. Management was very nice and offered upgraded room to deal with faulty equipment and were very sincere and professional. Breakfast was great, although very busy at times, dinner was nice despite staff not being aware of fine hotels voucher program.",3,2016,08,23
203,Centrally located Gem,"We spent 4 nights at the Weatbury. It was a wonderful experience.  The staff was knowledgeable of all the city's ins and outs, and was personable and not at all pretentious. You were made to feel welcomed and pampered.  I had a problem with adaptors for my 3 prong American plugs, and they were able to get me two that fit. It was a lifesaver. They should be rated as one of the top hotels in Dublin.",5,2016,08,23
203,amazing,"went for 3 nights with a group of people, this was the 3rd time i have stayed at the hotel. great location, great staff and great breakfast.
close to all sights, short walk to temple bar. i would stay again",5,2016,08,23
203,Gorgeous,"Upscale hotel in very convenient location. Impeccable service. Lobby, gallery and rooms are well appointed.  Staff exceeded expectations. Very service oriented. Loved the marble/sidecar bar. Centrally located in Dublin. ",5,2016,08,23
203,Elegant hotel in a great location,"Just returned from a two-week family vacation in Ireland.  Began our trip in Dublin and stayed several nights at the Westbury.  Lovely hotel, great service, excellent breakfast and cannot overstate the great location of the hotel.",5,2016,08,23
203,Relax in bustling Dublin,"Despite the great location of the hotel, I feel comfortable and at ease once I am back to the hotel. We are just 5 minutes away from food, shopping and attractions. The city is very busy and it is very nice to have an easy hideaway almost at any time you like. Will come back.",5,2016,08,22
203,"awesome location, friendly staff",We stayed at the Westbury and from the time of our arrival until our departure the staff was helpful and friendly.  They had a great breakfast included with our room price and the location was great for getting around Dublin on foot.  I would recommend this hotels to others visiting Dublin.,4,2016,08,22
203,Five star at its best,"My wife and I had a lovely weekend break at the Westbury hotel from the 5th to 7th August to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary.
Sophie and Jason at reception were most welcoming - very helpful and accommodating, they immediately set the tone for what proved to be a memorable weekend.
Lovely room, excellent breakfast and nice meal in the Balfes restaurant. All staff without exception were very pleasant and helpful in a non intrusive way.
Great location central to restaurants and Grafton street shopping 
Would highly recommend this hotel to all visiting Dublin. ",5,2016,08,22
203,Ugly exterior offset by good hotel keeping,"The Westbury is a bit of a bunker building carefully concealed in the centre of Dublin such that its brutal appearance does not offend.

The first floor is where the action is with a sweeping and always busy space devoted to primarily a female shopping clientele nibbling and sipping according to the time of day.  Creates a rather affable atmosphere and service is prompt and efficient.

We stayed in a Luxury Studio Suite on the 6th floor with a rooftop view.  Very spacious and well appointed with good lighting, ample cupboard space and comfortable seating areas.  Bathroom was in black marble and disappointingly an over the bath shower (thought these had been banished to the dark ages).  However, shower had good pressure and a fine selection of toiletries by Aromatherapy Associates. Housekeeping was efficient and with a good attention to detail.

Only meal taken was breakfast at Wilde.  There were 7 of us, so it was a bit of a squeeze as this is a pretty small space.  The ""full Irish"" was excellent and service was friendly.  Only disappointment was the inability to deliver on the enticing juices from ""The Juicery"" menu.  Having been told that these would take time to prepare, they never actually arrived.

The hotel has an excellent collection of Irish art spread across the first floor and a spectacular Louis Le Brocquy at the entrance to Wilde with a fine protrait by Sir John Lavery near reception.

Staff were all unfailinly cheerful, helpful and professional.  We had a mountain of luggage which was delivered and collected very promptly.

As a bit of a carbuncle, management have done a very good job at delivering character despite its outward appearance, rather narrow corridors and a slowwww set of lifts.

To be commended.",4,2016,08,22
203,Afternoon Tea with Champagne,"If you are looking to do something really special, something indulgent and memorable then Afternoon Tea in The Gallery in the Westbury Hotel is your only choice. I treated my sisters and mother to Afternoon Tea to celebrate the 'Mammy's' birthday and it was a huge success. 

Every member of staff in The Westbury I've ever dealt with have been nothing short of wonderful - professional, warm and knowledgeable. On the various occasions I've been there the guests have ranged in age and attire - little children, 60 birthdays, hens, travelers in shorts, ladies and gentlemen who lunch in fabulous designs - everyone is made welcome.

Currently the pastry chef has taken inspiration from the NCAD designs and the menu explains her interpretation through pastries of some very interesting Irish talent.

When you have afternoon tea you are welcome to order as many different teas and coffees as you like throughout the sitting. I tried the Irish Whiskey and Cream tea, which was heaven in a cup, and my sister tried the peach oolong tea that we all tried as well - yes we are that table. The coffees were wonderful too. 

There was so much food that they packed the remaining cakes into a box for us to take home. 

The atmosphere is so relaxing and enjoyable that none of us wanted to leave so our lovely server checked to see if there was a table in the bar for us and we spent another two hours there talking and laughing. 

Again the service can't be faulted and the food and drink are simply perfect. 

It's location is perfect if you want to spend the morning shopping or exploring before hand and because its so central its simple to get home if you haven't the good fortune to be able to stay. 

My only word of warning is that this place is addictive.",5,2016,08,22
203,Very nice,"Very pretty top to bottom, the overall presentation, from the lobby to the room is absolutely gorgeous. Also, very helpful and accommodating staff members.  The hotel bars and restaurants were a delight. I also liked that there are a lot of things around the hotel to do.",4,2016,08,21
203,Elegant Hotel in a Great Location!,We stayed at the Westbury for three days and loved everything about it.  The location is right off of Grafton Street in the middle of the city.  Our room was beautiful and the amenities were top notch.  The staff were kind and helpful and the breakfast was superb! Treat yourself if you can.  This hotel is worth every penny!,5,2016,08,20
203,Location Can't Be Beat,"The location is priceless. You are smack dab in the middle of everything you want.
The hotel is very pretentious and cold.
The included breakfast and included lunch were lovely.
The concierge was very nice.
Check in did not go well. We were supposed to have early check in, if available. It was not and though they said they would make getting us in our rooms a priority, we sat, jet lagged, in the lobby, unattended to from 10 to 3... 
We were to have an upgrade, if available. It was not.
We were to have late check out...one room out of two for one hour...
The room and bathroom were very small.",4,2016,08,20
203,Will go back,"The Westbury is a great hotel, simply the finest in service.  The location in Dublin can't be beat and the dining is great with many options including a more casual bistro brasserie type restaurant and a more formal dining room, and of course also the Westbury tea.  Room was clean and updated nicely. The staff were tremendous in fulfilling your every need and they're enthusiasm and professionalism bring this hotel to its 5 star status.  When in Dublin I'll be staying there.  ",5,2016,08,19
203,Weekend away sans children ,"Very relaxing hotel in the heart of the City. Wonderful staff and very helpful reception. Best mattress on a bed we have slept on in a long while! Really enjoyed the cocktails we had in the ""Side Car"" bar. Really enjoyed the complimentary shampoo and conditioners being of a high end brand too. Lovely bit of luxury.  ",4,2016,08,19
203,Super Location with top service,"We stayed at the Westbury for a long weekend for visiting our son working in Dublin. We enjoyed very much the location, but most of all its ambiance. The staff is very professional and friendly and they give you a real comfortable feeling. Some small things were not completely perfect, but it didn't change from our overall positif experience. We would definitely recommend this hotel !",5,2016,08,19
203,Lovely hotel,"We recently stayed in The Westbury for a birthday weekend in Dublin.

We had an early flight in and dropped our bags at the hotel which was really convenient and allowed us to start exploring the city straight away. The hotel phoned us early to let us know that our room was ready early - this was much appreciated. 

The rooms was lovely; a nice traditional feel which is what we look for in a hotel. Fantastically comfy bed, lovely bath robes and a well stocked mini bar. 

The hotel was in the perfect location for getting out and about in Dublin and especially at night nipping out for drinks and dinner without having to go far. 

The breakfast was fantastic; a wide continental selection and a hot menu to choose from all served in the surroundings of the Wylde restaurant which was extremely elegant. 

I had informed the hotel that we were there to celebrate my husband's birthday and they very kindly delivered a rather indulgent chocolate cake and card to the room - this was a really nice touch and was not expected. 

This hotel gave our weekend away a touch of luxury.

We would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely go back.",5,2016,08,18
203,First time visitors to Ireland,"Wonderful staff and great location for getting around on foot. Beds were very comfortable, breakfast was delicious and would definitely come back and stay with the Westbury again. Bonus- bartender who makes martinis at your table for you looks like Daniel Craig!",5,2016,08,17
203,Perfection,"In the heart of Dublin's Town Centre, The Westbury makes a grand gesture, defining the service one would expect at a hotel.
Perfectly situated being a stone's throw away from Dublin shopping district, myself and my significant other were very very impressed.
 
The staff were very kind, friendly and accommodating - the service was second to none.
We did not dine/drink at the bar or restaurants at the hotel, but did utilise the room service. The quality of the food is why superlatives are necessary in the English language.
 
Everything was perfect. I couldn‚Äôt praise it enough. I won‚Äôt be able to stay anywhere else in Dublin after this experience.",5,2016,08,14
203,Service plus,"First visit to Dublin, ideal location, easy walking distances to many attractions and restaurants.  However the hotel's restaurants and bars were most inviting: the ground floor brasserie was great for a quick casual meal while Wilde on the first floor was worthy of repeat visits.  The martini trolley in the bar was wonderful offering a range of options for your evening aperitif.",5,2016,08,13
203,Westbury Hotel - A great experience!,"We stayed at the Westbury for 7 nights in May 2016. Great location and centrally located. We walked everywhere - so many restaurants, bars and shops close by.  Staff was professional and friendly. We had a wonderful buffet breakfast every morning in their beautiful lounge area. Their restaurant was going through a remodel and re-opened  just as we were ending our visit. Our room was clean, quiet, had all the amenities and was adequate size. Enjoyed our stay.",5,2016,08,13
203,great place to stay,"This hotel was in a great location, it was private, the staff was friendly and professional, the rooms were clean and a good size.  We had a handicap room and it was on a low floor (which never happens in US), it was well adapted for a handicap individual with good thought to their needs",5,2016,08,12
203,Perhaps the best hotel in Dublin City,"One of the Best Hotels in the World collection, and for good reason. Property is kept immaculate, with excellent areas for business meeting, whether in a conference room, at the lobby bar/cafe or the restaurant. Conveniently located within walking distance of many attractions in the city. It is a little pricey, though",5,2016,08,12
203,It is a 5 star,"It's a 5 star by Irish standards for sure!

Not a knock against Ireland, but as an American...the Westbury offers the style and amenities found in most standard American hotels....however, it does these things in awesome Dublin, in a fantastic Location!!!

Shopping, restaurants, and pubs within steps...great options at that!  The view toward Grafton St in the morning is beautiful.

Exit out the back door to go towards the market and the Temple Bar area.

If you want an air conditioner, this is the place.  Stay at anything lesser, and you may get a small fan...not a joke, that's standard in Ireland.  

Very friendly service!",5,2016,08,11
203,Best hotel ever our favourite,Excellent hotel staff are brilliant so friendly n welcoming even to kids can't wait till our next stay .our little fella luvs goin der..and there so friendly to him.so relaxing .last went for my birthday n the left a little sumthing in our room such a nice touch.had a luvly time..,5,2016,08,11
203,One night in Dublin just for fun,"My husband and I decided to go to the Westbury for lunch and then decided to stay the night. It‚Äôs a magnificent hotel right in the center of Grafton Street and next to  St. Stephens Green.  
We had a wonderful lunch and at night we walked around Grafton Street. We came back to BALFES bar for a nightcap. Ceil (aka Cathel I think) was the best bartender I have ever had! He recommend a gin cocktail which was absolutely the best. The next morning we had a wonderful breakfast which was included in our rate and  once again the service and food was impeccable. 
I also met Emmett one of the Mangers about 2 days later as I was showing my friend the hotel for future stays. Emmett greeted us so politely and spent some time talking about the hotel and surrounding areas. Been a Dublin native myself I felt very welcomed and had a truly ‚Äúgrand‚Äù time. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who prefers luxury accommodation and attentive staff. I hope to see you all again when I visit my homeland in the future.",5,2016,08,11
203,Loved the Westbury!,"We loved everything about the Westbury - location, service, friendliness of the staff and room accommodations.  Breakfasts in the morning were wonderful as well! Highly recommend if you are traveling to Dublin.",5,2016,08,11
203,Luxury Hotel in the middle of Dublin,"We stayed at both the Shelbourne and the Westbury, and although I preferred the Shelbourne, the Westbury is also very nice.  Rooms were nice, but not very large.  The bathtub was almost impossible to step in and out of because it was so high.  They have free WiFi and a business center with free computers for guests.  The feel of the hotel is very modern and I just didn't get the feeling that I was in Ireland the way I did at the Shelbourne.",4,2016,08,10
203,Great central location and great service,Really enjoy staying at this hotel. Walking outside to central shopping area and being so close to everything is great. Ambiance is a little old world with lovely afternoon tea lounge perfect for drinks and snacks too. Restaurant good and we had included breakfast which was excellent - even got a la carte coffee if requested and gluten free well catered for. A comfortable stay for the third visit and would stay again.,5,2016,08,10
203,Almost 5 stars,"Great location, excellent staff. Wi-Fi was hit & miss, however by our 5th day they did rectify this.

The major frustrating thing with this hotel is the lifts. One of them was completely out of action for more than 24 hours. The other one is so slow, we had to resort to taking the stairs (10 flights) on more than one occasion. Not on for a hotel charging AU$700 a night! ",4,2016,08,09
203,Dublin weekend.,"We booked in here as the Shelbourn was full and although at first I was disappointed, the location and friendliness of the staff soon made up for it. The rooms are just a little dated but very comfortable although more toiletries were limited, when two people are in a room there only appears to be enough for one. Staff in the dinning area were generally helpful although service was slow and afternoon scones with our Earl Grey never appeared and when we pointed this out it was almost shrugged off by a male member of the serving staff who only said ""Oh, we will not charge you for them then""!!!!",4,2016,08,08
203,A Gem in Dublin,"I came here for business as it was within walking distance of the office. The Westbury has a certain presence to it... an heir of high quality and great service even before walking into the lobby. The front desk staff were all very pleasant and very accommodating. The hotel itself is right in the heart of the Grafton St area, so in terms of location, there is nothing else you can for. 

The room itself was nice, albeit nothing overly spectacular, but it was clean and everything worked. 

The breakfasts were pricey, but keep in mind I was here on business so that did not really affect me. The selection and service were excellent.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone - business or pleasure.

Thank you Westbury!",5,2016,08,07
203,AMAZING Afternoon Tea,"We booked afternoon tea for my friends baby shower. I can honestly say I have never enjoyed an experience more. From the moment I arrived I received a genuinely warm welcome from the staff. I was early but was seated at our gorgeous table. Beautiful table setting included white linen, divine china and stunning cutlery. 

Whilst I waited for my friends I ordered a pot of Irish breakfast tea. Such a refreshing flavour. I sat enjoying my luxurious, elegant surroundings watching the world go by. 

Then we moved onto the Afternoon Tea!!  Oh my days!!  Firstly, we had a few dietary requirements but our server was so obliging. Then it arrived üò±. The sandwiches were divine!!!!!  A selection of egg, ham, chicken brioche roll, smoke salmon and crab. All taste sensations. The next two tiers were scones, and pastries. Absolutely incredible. We had a selection of teas and coffee from their vast menu. Yum!

Our server, I'm afraid I don't recall her name, was a dream from start to finish. So attentive and polite but not pushy. I wish I could recall her name as she deserves the recognition. 

We were all sad to leave as it really was a perfect afternoon.  Thank you Westbury Dublin, you gave us a wonderful experience we will never forget. ",5,2016,08,07
203,Afternoon tea,Booked afternoon tea for the mother and sister to celebrate the Mother's birthday. Upon arrival the waitress went into a lot of detail about what was on order. There was unlimited teas and coffees and the food was only amazing. To say I was stuffed for the whole day was an understatement and I didn't even finish it all. Would 100% recommend at the top of my lost The Westbury for afternoon tea,5,2016,08,07
203,Afternoon tea,"Celebrated my birthday recently with afternoon tea at the westbury
Had a great time staff excellent and very helpful
Well worth the cost to be treated with luxury for the afternoon
Needed a long walk when finished to move all the cakes ?
Catered for special requirements with no hassle
Tip book in advance it gets very busy
",5,2016,08,06
203,Pictures of the room not truly reflected,"My husband and I travelled to Ireland for the first time for leisure and stayed at the Westbury for three nights and the Conrad for one night. We chose to stay at the Westbury longer because it is supposed to be a 5 star hotel and of all the glowing reviews. We like to stay at different hotels when we are abroad not traveling with the kids because we like to try out different hotels. I have to say, I was not very impressed by the hotel. First of all, the location and service of the hotel is perfect. So if location is what you are after, go for it. Now the rooms. We picked the superior king room. We stayed in room 429. The pictures on the website looked great, but the rooms are not truly reflected by the photos and are in desperate need of a facelift. I mean, the grout in the bathroom is discoloured, the toilet and the sinks are old and don't work very well. The drain in the tub is gross. And while the hotel is non smoking, there is smell of smoke in the hallway of the 4th floor which infiltrates into our room. Also, when we arrived, the vanity kit was half used and some of the toiletries were missing. In retrospect, I wonder if someone was in the room before us and probably requested a room change. To put things in perspective, the non-renovated room at the Conrad, which is a slightly lower star hotel, is in better condition than the room in Westbury. I know the hotel conditions in Europe are usually not as good as in North America because the hotels are older, but I feel that I have stayed at many hotels all over the world and given I have stayed at two different hotels in Ireland, I am able to make a fair comparison. I guess I was expecting more given the website description of the hotel, the reviews, and the price, and have felt that it has been a let-down. To the manager of the Westbury, I think once the rooms are upgraded, I am sure your hotel will be wonderful again. But if it stays this way, people will start going else where. ",3,2016,08,05
203,The Gallery Bar,"My wife and I are always very impressed with the service at the gallery at the Westbury but this evening was a level above. We arrived at 22:30, half an hour after the kitchen had closed, and ordered a few cocktails and dessert. Despite the fact that the chef was on her way out, once she got our order she stayed to prepare two absolutely delicious dishes for us. The apple tart and creme br√ªl√©e were outstanding. The service is impeccable, the staff are attentive and friendly. This is one of the best places in Dublin for an evening with your significant other.",5,2016,08,05
203,Great 5 * Hotel,"Great Hotel, right in the center of Dublin.
Good bedrooms, good breakfast and good service.
Very well located.  Nicely decorated. Confortable rooms and beds, delicius breakfast.
They have everything you could expect from a 5 * hotel",5,2016,08,05
203,Ideal place to stay when in Dublin,"Confession; I've stayed here lots of times. So I'm both well versed in the establishment, but maybe a little biased. After all, I keep coming back !

Firstly, the Westbury is, in  my opinion, the best location to stay in Dublin. One small caveat; not so great if you have a car. Although there is concierge parking, it is quite hard to get to if you're not local, and the car park is tight. But by taxi, ideal. Great pubs and restaurants close by, in the middle of the city centre's nicest area, plenty of shopping and culture in a stone's throw. 

Service has always been great. Warm welcome from the desk. The only quibble I have is that the rooms are getting a little tired. Don't get me wrong, the standard is still what you'd expect from such an establishment, but newer peers have the advantage with newer fixtures, if not with location and quality of staff. Rooms size is generally good, suites are well positioned and quite quiet and of a good size, beds comfortable and you get little things like a bottle of water and turndown service chocolates which are always nice. Towels are good, robes and slippers provided naturally. 

Continental breakfast is pricey as you'd expect from any hotel of this standard, but they do an amazing omelette whilst Balfes is a great choice for a lunch or low key dinner. 

All in all, thoroughly recommend.",4,2016,08,05
203,Price of afternoon tea advertised on the website not honoured at the hotel,"Having moved to Dublin 18 months ago, this is one of my favourite haunts for a drink at the bar or a snack after a day's shopping. Having also experienced the wonderful afternoon tea, I was happy to treat a leaving colleague to a voucher for two for the afternoon tea. On the day of booking, I had seen this advertised for 55‚Ç¨ per person for the champagne afternoon tea, however I was rather disappointed and left feeling a bit cheated that if I wanted to book, it would have to be at the new price of 59‚Ç¨ per person as they had not ''had a chance to update the website yet''. Having asked the lady on desk to speak with the manager expressing my concern at the advertised price , he was not willing to budge and was happy for me to take it or leave it. It's more the principle and I could have taken my custom to The Merrion or The Shelbourne, but I did book in the end as I didn't want to disappoint my colleagues after we had got the money together for our departing colleague   , but please can you update your website or indeed honour the advertised price,  as in the uK this would certainly be deemed false advertising! I would have expected a bit more from a high end hotel really and for this aspect of customer service , I feel disappointed and would rate the service as average. 

",3,2016,08,04
203,Wonderful experience,"We loved our stay at the Westbury. We were greeted warmly by the staff upon arrival and the service was wonderful from that moment forward. They helped navigate our car through busy streets made worse by construction and made our two young daughters feel quite at home. After a long day, you won't regret staying at the Westbury. It is a first class experience from start to finish. ",5,2016,08,04
203,Afternoon Tea,"We had just arrived in Dublin and wanted a relaxing tea experience, which we found at the Westbury. The sandwiches, sconces and desserts were just delicious and more than plentiful. We couldn't finish them and brought them back to our hotel with us. Most of all, we loved the atmosphere and the service, which were both exceptional. We were not hurried and spent several hours enjoying our teas. The service was truly amazing and the servers so pleasant and accommodating. We found exactly what we had been looking for - a special place for tea in a warm and welcoming environment. ",5,2016,08,03
203,My 50th birthday treat,This is a 5 star hotel make no mistake - The breakfast was the one of the best - lots of choice at the buffet or you could choose to eat from the menu.  There was a lovely seating area to have afternoon tea although we didn't get chance to do this but would have loved to  - The restaurant attached to it was fabulous - had a great evening there.  The staff couldn't have been any more helpful - Would love to go back here - ideally placed for shopping on Grafton Street and only a 10 minute walk to Temple Bar.,5,2016,08,03
203,Outstanding ,"Very nice hotel with awesome hotel staff.  Located on historic Grafton St, close to the Dublin Castle, Guinness Brewery and Brazen Head, the oldest bar in Ireland!! Excellent food and plenty of nearby shopping. Anything I've needed, has been handled.",5,2016,08,03
203,Pure luxury,"What a great experience my two days at The Westbury was. Location can't be beaten, staff are so friendly and give a genuine Irish welcome to all. They are all so pleasant and helpful and most importantly, well trained.
 I had booked a Luxury King Suite but on arrival was upgraded to a magnificent Luxury Four Poster Suite with a four poster bed, separate lounge, dining area and underfloor heating. My little granddaughter was most impressed! One morning I had breakfast in Wilde's and the eggs Royale were cooked perfectly and the second morning I went to Balfe's for breakfast, which was again a good experience. However, what can I say about the Westbury afternoon tea? This is a ""must do"" experience in Dublin, and was simply magnificent. The quality of the cakes and pastries is fantastic and the whole experience, which takes hours to enjoy fully, is amazing. However, next time we will share one afternoon tea, because there was simply too much food! They did pack us up a lovely box for my friend to take home though. It's an expensive experience at ‚Ç¨118 for a Champagne tea for two but it is such a wonderful treat. 
I will be returning soon, this time with my mother. My only wish would be that there were more suites with a walk in shower. This time it will have to be the King bed luxury suite as it is the only one with a walk in shower for her. ",5,2016,08,02
203,Fabulous,This is a great hotel in a perfect location for a Dublin city break. Absolute comfort and friendliness makes you feel that you very much on holidays. Would love to stay in the Westbury again in the future.,5,2016,08,02
203,Christmas delight,"Stayed over Christmas New Year period for an anniversary.  Great room, suite.  Very spacious, well worth the expense.  Breakfast was a problem, too busy and had to be seated outside Restaurant.  Dinner was good, but restaurant was very quiet, possibly deemed expensive.  Very central location for shopping.  Impossible to get afternoon tea, as booked out since October apparently - would be good if hotel reserved a number of spaces for residents ..... Not clear that they do, we asked a couple of times over our several night stay.",4,2016,08,01
203,Worth the splurge!,"We stayed two nights a The Westbury Hotel with a large family group traveling together.  The Hotel's interior is lovely and they have a hint of a wonderful scent wafting through the main lobby.  Our room was very nice - the bed was comfortable and the toiletries in the bathroom were top shelf.  There was no dresser in our room (but given our short stay we didn't really unpack) and the closet had plenty of room.  We ate breakfast and had late night cocktails in the main lobby area, serviced by the Wilde Restaurant and both were fabulous.  There are additional dining/bar options but we didn't try them.  Location is great - right near Grafton Street shopping area and Trinity College. Highly recommended if you want to splurge!",5,2016,08,01
203,My Birthday Treat.,"I stayed at the Westbury hotel with my husband and sister and brother in law as a very generous birthday gift from my sister. The hotel is centrally located and we were able to take in the sights and sounds of Dublin quite easily. The staff in the hotel are very attentive and efficient, special thanks to Thomas the night manager for looking after us so well. The food is exceptional and the staff are very well informed and excited about the menu! Breakfast is sensational as is the afternoon tea, I was spoilt and I loved it, I can't wait for my next visit.",5,2016,08,01
203,Near miss,"First stay July 2016.  The Westbury is a nice hotel that falls a little short of expectations and well short of representing good value.  The common areas are quite nice and well-kept and the dining options are solid (try Wilde).  But the bed was half collapsed and the maids were excessively noisy every morning.  The location just off Grafton may appeal to some but we found it quite tedious to deal with each time coming and going.  Although the shortcomings aren't overwhelming, at the price it simply wasn't up to par.",3,2016,08,01
203,Centrally placed and great food.. but,"Just back from 4 day break in Dublin staying at The Westbury hotel. Central, convenient for shops, bars and city centre points of interest, it has all the ingredients for a wonderful weekend. And indeed it was. A great city, with wonderful museums and tours to make you realise how little we knew about it and its history.

In terms of the hotel it was, I am afraid, slightly disappointing. Nothing drastic, but having stayed in many top rated hotels, it has to go some distance to meet the standards of others. We had a suite, which should unquestionably have the highest standards of service and facilities. It didn‚Äôt and while there were only minor issues, collectively they start to paint quite a dull picture:

‚Ä¢	The TV remote control wasn‚Äôt working and the picture was very poor.
‚Ä¢	One of the air conditioning units only blew out warm air
‚Ä¢	There were no slippers in the room
‚Ä¢	Intermittent flannels in the bathroom
‚Ä¢	The milk for the tea and coffee was either soured, or worse still, solid.
‚Ä¢	No biscuits given with the tea and coffee facilities. No fruit. 

Elsewhere, the bars in the hotel were OK, but again, very poor snacks accompanied drinks. Third rate peanuts which would have been better left entirely than bothered with. 

The food in the restaurant was excellent. Cannot be faulted. Good knowledgeable and efficient waiting staff, and if one had kissed the blarney stone, so much the better.

Concierge good and obliging although they advised us incorrectly about the availability of Kilmainham Gaol tours, which we luckily ignored and went ahead booked anyway. Again nothing drastic, but it would have ruined my trip not to have seen the gaol.

Overall, a wonderful city and a fine hotel but improvements are needed if it is to consider itself one of the leading lights in Dublin hotels.",4,2016,08,01
203,#1 Hotel in Dublin,"I'm not sure words can describe how wonderful our recent stays were with The Westbury. My fianc√© and I spent a few nights here before heading west for our wedding ceremony and then returned for a night before flying out. The service at this hotel is second to none. They were efficient, friendly and went out of their way to be accommodating in every possible way. They gave us early checkin on arrival after sending us to a complimentary breakfast while we waiting a mere hour and a half for our room to be ready at 10 in the morning. Amazing! The room was lovely and clean, and they sent up a complimentary bottle of wine with a congratulations that evening and a bottle of champagne on our return after the nuptials.We are so glad we chose the Westbury to be part of our travels that week, it truly added to what was already an amazing Ireland experience. Thanks to all, especially Rachel at the front desk for all her help!",5,2016,07,31
203,Afternoon tea ,"Afternoon tea booked by my hubby for my birthday . Staff and surroundings were exceptional . We were lucky to get window seat, such a treat.
Pastries were designed by NCAD and were almost too pretty to eat!!. 
I also received a special birthday treat and we got the pastries boxed up that we couldn't finish ",5,2016,07,31
203,Excellent,"We have been fortunate to stay in many great hotels around the world, and on the whole The Westbury ranks up there with the best of them.  Our room on the 6th floor was beautifully quiet, simple and stylishly decorated.  Service overall was exemplary, the lounge was beautiful and calming and the position, tucked away up a side street off the main beat in Dublin is perfect. One small thing which could have been done better is for the room to have been cleaned in the morning. After returning from a morning out, the room had not been cleaned which was frustrating as we wanted to relax (the ""please clean my room"" sign was out).  However overall excellent and we really enjoyed our stay at The Westbury.",4,2016,07,31
203,"Great Location, Good Hotel","Dublin is a very walkable city, and The Westbury is well positioned for walking to the major tourist spots. We especially enjoyed the nearby park for walks/runs in the morning. 

Rooms -- a little on the small side, but is is a city hotel. Biggest issue was broken AC. The hotel claimed we had it set to heat, which they then ""fixed"" but we were sweating each night even with the window cracked open. Finally, we asked to be moved to another room. They gladly accommodated and we soon discovered how lovely a nights sleep could be!  Bathrooms are nothing special - mediocre shower inside the bathtub, but all was adequate. FYI, a king bed room is really two single beds pushed together. Not much room to place suitcases and clothes either. 

Service was really good, at both reception desk, restaurant, and bar. The full breakfast was very good, albeit a fairly limited selection. Try their Juicery juices. Very good!

A good stay in Dublin, just demand a room with proper air. Also, Powerscourt Centre behind the hotel is a neat shopping/restaurant area. Don't miss the area on the backside of the hotel!",4,2016,07,31
203,Thank you for great experience.,Over all we really enjoyed our experience today in the Westbury hotel . I would like to say thank you to Daniel from the bar. It was a great experience. Thank you for chocolates :).We will be back again. Thank you Jacek and Ania.,5,2016,07,30
203,Great way to top off a holiday trip,"Stayed at hotel at end of golfing trip for some R&R before returning to US.  Enjoyed good location, friendly staff, high quality finishes, good food (esp breakfast).  Will stay at Westbury next time in Dublin whether for business or pleasure. ",5,2016,07,29
203,A wonderful experience,"We stayed at the Westbury for 7 nights. The location was perfect for visiting Dublin's city center and taking tours from there into the countryside. Our room was quiet and large with a cozy sitting area, generous closet, nice amenities (including the Nespresso machine which we enjoyed). The large lobby area downstairs was a perfect combination of elegance and comfort. It was perfect at the end of a day to enjoy ""tea"" or a meal there. The staff could not have been more friendly and accommodating. The bar off the main hall was cozy and lovely. We enjoyed all the restaurants and room service that the hotel offered, and it was all first rate! We would highly recommend The Westbury to all our friends and family.",5,2016,07,28
203,Stay and conference,"Very nice hotel with helpful staff. The location is excellent if you want to explore Dublin and the rooms are large, clean and nice. I would recommend the room service burger. Possibly a little expensive for what it is but the open foyer for coffee and breakfast in the morning are both worth it (very nice coffee).
Conference rooms are ok, very typical of a nice hotel.",4,2016,07,28
203,Loved this hotel,"We ended up at the Westbury by accident.  Long story, but we needed an extra night, so ended up with 2 nights at the Westbury.  And boy are we glad we did.  What a lovely property.  We ended up loving it.

I had heard the rooms were small, but ours wasn't. It wasn't huge, but certainly adequate.  It was beautifully decorated, and nice bathroom.  

The service was superb, except for the length of time to have someone get our luggage.

We enjoyed breakfast, which came with our room package.  
The location was fabulous.  We did not hear any street noise.  Great hotel.  Highly recommend it.",5,2016,07,27

203,A Dublin Favourite üíñ,"Having stayed as The Westbury for three nights late June 2015 with my sisters,I made a point to return and stay the first weekend of August. The Westbury is ideally located off Grafton Street and very easy to navigate your way to with prompt valet parking. In addition to the superb location,the rooms are well appointed and the luxury of the gallery lounge is impeccable. The hotel boasts a great atmosphere of excellence, one of Dublin's finest hotels! The staff,service,food and accommodation are all of superb quality. During both stays I enjoyed food in the Wilde restaurant,the Gallery lounge, Balfes, room service and afternoon tea,all of which was beautiful and full of flavour. The Westbury is a fantastic hotel, full of quality and charm in a wonderful location üåü ",5,2016,07,27
203,Falling Stars,"First Impressions make lasting impressions. My wife and I stayed in 10 different hotels/inns while traveling about Ireland and I can honestly report that the Westbury was at the bottom of the list as it relates to service especially since it is ranked as a five star hotel by many. When one has an issue in such a place, it is not unreasonable to expect it to be solved - reported mechanical air conditioning issue twice - never resolved, not even the offer of a fan. While the hotel is nice and in a great location, when paying top dollar - service is not only an expectation, it is a must.",3,2016,07,27
203,Location can't be better and that's just the start,"From arrival to departure - we had an awesome experience.  Absolutely best hotel we've stayed in Dublin!  The service is impeccable from check in (which included hot towel service  for everyone) to check out every staff member you come in contact with are courteous and extremely professional.  Rooms are good sized and nicely appointed including complementary Nespresso. Our rate included breakfast which consisted of a continental buffet as well as an a la carte hot entr√©e menu.  Wonderful food!  The Westbury could not be more perfectly placed. You walk out to the center of Grafton Street.  You can walk to most Dublin attractions from the hotel.  Oblivious not the cheapest hotel in Dublin but WORTH every penny!!! 

",5,2016,07,26
203,Weekend in Dublin,"We spent a night in the Westbury during a weekend in Dublin. The hotel is fantastic, so we'll kept and 5 star service from everyone from doorman to reception to accommodation staff and restaurant staff. Although the building must be difficult to maintain given its age this is not visible anywhere. The rooms are not huge as this is a city Centre (right off grafton st., definately one of the best located hotels in Dublin) location but they are great rooms. Well furnished, nice bathroom and excellent bed!! I would recommend this for any stage in Dublin and is a match for any of the other 5 star in the capital. When driving the sat nav gets confused when Westbury entered, put in Clarendon st. ",5,2016,07,26
203,Elegant in the heart of the city,"Thank you Westbury for the attention to detail especially in service 

The property is stunning and a nice quiet spot in the Center of it all. 

My only suggestion is more searing in the lobby area there is nothing other than the dining venues!",5,2016,07,26
203,"Westbury Hotel, Ireland ","Older hotel, but very much maintain . The staff was great  and very helpful.

To stay there is very expensive, but we wanted have a great place to stay. I don't believe you'll make a mistake by staying there. ",5,2016,07,26
203,Faultless,"Beautiful hotel in the perfect location to make of the most of a short break. Staff could not be more helpful and the interior is spectacular. Could not fault for a special occasion. 
Food and cocktails in the attached bar looked great but sadly never got to try. 
It was one of our parties birthday and they surprised her with a special desert waiting in her room. 
Fantastic stay all round ",5,2016,07,25
203,Not enough For the Price,"The Westbury Hotelnin Dublin is located in a busy, historic and lively section of London. Within walking distance are famous Irish pubs, eateries, local shops and historic places of interest.

The Hotel staff are top notch: knowledgable, smiling, and seemingly ever present without being overbearing. The breakfast buffet and menu is great quality.

With so much to commend it, the Hotel comes up short. The rooms are small and narrow. I never quite could figure out how to manipulate the many light switches. 

The Lobby is clean and bright, and the staff excellent. However, there are no places to sit while waiting for guests. The only seats are located in the restaurant.

The Westbury has much to commend, but with the expensive price for a room and these shortcomings, the Westbury comes up short.",3,2016,07,24
203,"Lovely hotel, lovely service","My husband and I recently spent 2 nights at The Westbury in Dublin.  Everything about The Westbury is top-notch. We enjoyed High Tea, a room service lunch, dinner in Balfes restaurant and breakfast in the main dining room.  All of the meals were excellent in every respect.  Great service, lovely table seatings and atmosphere, and very good food.  The Irish Breakfast was particularly delicious.  Our room faced a busy street and pub and we were concerned about the noise, but the double windows completely blocked the street noise, so no problems there.  The bed was very comfortable.   We appreciated the HDMI hookup for the TV, so we could watch our downloads on the TV screen. (Why don't all hotels provide this!)  The Concierge service was excellent.  They arrange a dinner at The Bank, car service and transfers, and our Hop On Hop Off tour.  Everyone on the staff went the extra yard.  Pricey, but absolutely worth it!",5,2016,07,24
203,Superb ,"At the moment I had arrived st the hotel I was well looked after! From then I was only called by my name from every member of staff which I had not even met until then. 

I was going out and the guest services ten had noticed I had an injury on my leg and I was stopped and asked if needed any help or advice so was given appropriate directions and tips. Once I got back I was met by the hotel manager who personally wanted to know if he were able to help with anything. Next morning I had an envelope slipped under my door with a kind nite from the guests service manager wishing my prompt recovery together with 2 x local transportation tickets so I could save my leg from getting worse - the point is, the attention to details is the key to success... Being to many 5* properties over the world over the past few years made me realise that what does the place is the people!!

Rooms deco are beautiful, public areas buzzy and cool, breakfast superb

I will definitely be staying there next time I am in Dublin 

Well done to you all ",5,2016,07,23
203,Great hotel fantastic location,"Love this hotel, it's hidden just off Grafton st. Great for shopping and a great Christmas time atmosphere for a weekend away. 
Great service and lovely rooms. 
It's always a treat to come here for a treat. Preferred city centre location and now that the four seasons is no longer in Dublin this is probably the best alternative. ",5,2016,07,20
203,Best luxury in Dublin,The location of the Westbury can't be beat.  Literally steps from where you want to be in the heart of old town.  The service was impeccable and the hotel top notch.  The bar was closed for the evening I stayed but the gallery lounge was warm and the staff very attentive.  When having trouble finding the valet front of the hotel the staff came around to the back alley entrance to meet me because I was so flustered and made me completely at ease.  You simply can't beat the staff and the friendliness and helpfulness at the Westbury.,5,2016,07,20
203,home from home,"I was in Dublin for one night launching my book I'm Not One to Gossip But.......and the Westbury was located just up the street from the launchvenue(Bruxelles). I booked in for one night with my partner  and was much impressed with the  quality, friendliness and can do attitude of all the staff from  doormen, reception, restaurant and customer service. Everyone was  not only helpful but smiling and extreely engaging.Nothing was too muich trouble. As I  would miss supper because of the launch  it was suggested we should afternoon tea. It was splendid, beautifully presented and the waitress very sweetly organsied the packaging of the cakes we couldn't consume which were delivered to our room. A really class hotel.",5,2016,07,18
203,Disappointing,"Reception service was very poor and not what you would expect from a hotel of this supposed quality. Outside of reception however, the service was very good. 
Rooms were comfortable rather than outstanding.
Excellent location apart, I would not recommend this hotel if you are expecting five star quality & excellence.",3,2016,07,18
203,Incorrect information from reservations desk,"We were assured that the suit (at great expense) had a separate toilet / WC. When we got to the room - this is not the case. The toilet is in the bathroom, there is a single basin and the shower in tiny. The check out time is 12h00. The check in time is 15h00. We arrived at 09h30 off a cruise ship and no effort was made to get us the suite before 15h00. So in spite of suite guests waiting - no effort was made to make up the room quicker than usual.",1,2016,07,17
203,Lovely Hotel in a Great Location,What a wonderful stay -- the hotel is tucked away just off of Grafton Street.  It has a large lovely lobby where you can enjoy afternoon tea or an evening glass of wine.  All of the staff was so helpful and attentive and the concierge most helpful with all of our questions. Rooms were a nice size -- we were 2 ladies traveling and just went with the twin room.  We also took advantage of the inclusive breakfast and it was beautiful to start the day on the porch with the buffet or Eggs Benedict.  We walked to everything from the hotel or there are taxis waiting right outside.  I like to stay in nice hotels - The Westbury is definitely staying on my list!,5,2016,07,15
203,Excellent hotel,"Stayed at the Westbury for 4 nights after attending a wedding. Very impressed with the hospitality and friendliness of the staff.
Great location and within walking distance of local attractions especially Temple Bar area.
Will definitely return!  Irish hospitality is not a myth!",5,2016,07,14
203,"Nice , clean and excellent service hotel in a great location ... but got some drawbacks","Excellent location! 
The hotel staff supply great hospitality , the rooms are big , quiet and clean. 
Gym is small but nice. 
somehow ... even after asking for service , the temp in the shower could not be set .. it was either medium or too high. 
Wifi in the rooms :  medium quality and does not fit business needs.",4,2016,07,14
203,Didn't pay attention to detail,"Stayed at this hotel at the beginning and the end of our trip to Ireland, June 2016. On our first night the room was fine, beautiful and clean. When we returned to this hotel on the last 2 nights in Ireland before returning home to Florida we were NOT happy with the upkeep of the room that we were in, Room 433.  As you can see, from the photos, this room was in need of  cleaning.  After unpacking, and getting settled, slowly but surely these areas that were so neglected were discovered by me and my husband. There was black mold and peeling paint right over the bed/my husbands head. There were YELLOW water spots/droplets all over the ceiling in the bathroom and the carpet had stains all over the room! All this was brought to the attention of the hotel manager and the front desk staff when we checked out. They were apologetic and expressed their concern for the poor condition of this very expensive hotel room.  The manager even sent me a letter of apology and stating that we will be eligible for an upgrade the next time we visit the Westbury.  But, as I stated to the management, for the prices of these rooms in this FIVE STAR hotel, their staff should be more aware and attentive of what needs to be cleaned and repaired in the rooms. Next time, I will definitely say something immediately wherever I stay!",4,2016,07,13
203,One of the Finest Hotels in Ireland,"I am very confident as someone who has worked in the hotel industry for many years that The Westbury Hotel is one of th finest Hotels in Ireland. From Arrival to departure everything was completely flawless. I would say that the d√©cor, service from the staff, warm friendly welcome and food quality is 10 out of 10. We dined in the new Wilde Restaurant and it was fantastic. Amazing ambiance, food and the service team were brilliant. The only disappointing aspect of the stay was having to leave. Thank you.",5,2016,07,13
203,Great Irish Hospitality,"My family and I stayed at The Westbury for 6 nights while we vacationed in Dublin.  The total experience was wonderful.  We arrived in Dublin at 5:00 a.m.  We had reserved a room for our arrival morning and it was held for us without any issues.  The hotel staff was always friendly and helpful.  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  
One of the best selling points about the hotel is its great location.  Go out the front door and you are on Grafton street--a combination of Times Square and Fifth Avenue.  Exit out the back door and it's a short walk to a plethora of retail stores, restaurants and pubs.  
If you can afford the price of a room at The Westbury, you will enhance your visit and your enjoyment by staying there.  My family was completely pleased with our stay and our interaction with the hotel's employees.  We would highly recommend it for your visit to Dublin.",5,2016,07,13
203,Nice hotel near Grafton St,My stay at the Westbury was very pleasant.  The hotel is a one minute walk from Grafton Street (for those looking to shop).  The room was comfortable and spacious.  The breakfast was nice with a wide variety of foods.  Overall no major complaints.  The rooms could do with a little updating but that didn't impact my experience and I would return here if I were to ever return to Dublin.  It was also nice to always have 2-3 taxis in front of the hotel because it didn't require advance planning to go somewhere.,5,2016,07,13
203,A trip down memory lane. ,Just returning home after a day trip to Dublin. When my mother was alive but not fit for too much shopping she would sit in the Westbury as I went forward and back to the shops in Grafton street. We usually had lunch/ coffee etc. And mam was content to sit there on her own watching the world go by. On my return she would have little stories or thoughts to share about what had happened while I was away. Today I brought my daughter to lunch in the Westbury for the first time. I cannot recommend the staff highly enough. They were both efficient and friendly. The lunch was tasty and good value for money. Aoife our waitress was lovely. We are definitely going back for afternoon tea before the summer is over!,5,2016,07,13
203,Elegant and Superb,"The Westbury is a top notch hotel in a wonderful European City. My wife, Beach Bum Travel Concierge Lisa Zwissler, and I stayed here for three nights while attending a friends Wedding in Dublin.  It was exactly what we wanted with a classy and elegant yet comforting environment. 

The room was excellent and surprisingly large for a standard room in a large European city. The bathroom was equally large and accomodating. Our stay included Breakfast and it was excellent and well worth the cost.

I absolutely recommend this hotel.",5,2016,07,12
203,Wonderful stay at the Westbury,"We stayed two nights in the Westbury and from the moment we arrived we felt at home.  The staff were warm, welcoming and efficient.  The room was great and we slept very comfortably!  I would highly recommend the Westbury.",5,2016,07,10
203,10th Anniversary,"Enjoyed a lovely stay in The Westbury. The staff were very friendly and couldn't have been more helpful. Breakfast was excellent with alternatives for special dietary requirements. The room was comfortable and very clean. The hotel is in an excellent condition and well worthy of it's five star rating. Location could not be better for enjoying a city break in Dublin. The hotel acknowledged our tenth anniversary with a welcoming chocolate dessert in our room and a welcome card. It was a nice gesture. 
Thank you! ",5,2016,07,10
203,Outstand Hotel in Every Way!,"We spent 3 weeks in Ireland. We started and ended our trip in Dublin. We stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel at the beginning of our trip. It had incredible staff, but the building and rooms were average... So for the last part of our trip we changed our reservation to the Westbury and am I glad we did.

This place is 5 stars... 

The hotel itself was in a great location, right off of Grafton Street. So you had easy access to everything, yet a very quiet sleeping experience. 

Our room was in great condition and exceptionally large.  We did have a suite, but it was so spacious and a cost only slightly higher than the Fitzwilliam standard room, which was unreasonably small.

And the hotel had a great breakfast, a really good restaurant Balfes... And an oversized lobby where you could sit for drinks, snacks or a light meal... The front desk was extremely friendly and eager to accommodate your requests.

We had a great time our five nights there. I would highly recommend this hotel",5,2016,07,10
203,Miss,We visited for afternoon tea as we were assured it was outstanding ... Upon arrival we were seated at the bar despite asking for a table when we enquired about this we were told we would be seated when a table was available ... After an hour and a quarter we left and passed the same members of staff having a nice chat together ...next to many empty tables it seems the staff have a tendency to forget customers ...won't be visiting again ,2,2016,07,10
203,Lovely Luxury Hotel,"We visited The Westbury for a special occasion weekend as a couple. It was everything you would expect in a luxury hotel - room and amenities were great, staff very helpful and food options good. We treated ourselves to the Afternoon Tea which is an absolute must! Great location just off Grafton Street so was in the middle of everything without feeling really busy.",5,2016,07,10
203,Perfect on all levels ,"I stayed in a twin room with my son. The hotel is beautiful and lived up to my expectations. The service lived up to the five star rating. The only difficulty I had was trying to get to the hotel as there were road works and my sat nav kept telling me I  had arrived . I found a car park close by and walked to the hotel. I spoke to the staff and felt that it would be as easy just to leave my car where it was ! Unsure if the exact coordinates are available ! 
The hotel however was faultless and the food in the bar was outstanding. 
The hotel is expensive but that is the whole point ! It was a treat ! I have booked to attend again in October !
",5,2016,07,09
203,Beautiful Hotel,"Great hotel in a fantastic location. Just a short walk to lots of local tourist spots. I do highly recommend this hotel. 

I stayed with family and a young child was travelling with us and the staff couldn't be more helpful.",5,2016,07,09
203,Favourite place for cocktails !!!,"I don't usually give 5/5 but the Westbury does provide that  extra touch of class .....
Myself and my wife love nothing better then to climb the stairs,turn left ..get shown to a table and order two gin cocktails ....exceptional service .....great service....would only highly recommend ",5,2016,07,09
203,Superb afternoon tea,"The Westbury certainly lives up to its reputation. We had afternoon tea which was simply wonderful. The location is perfect, in the middle of a bustling city yet it remains an oasis of calm. Beautiful decor, amazing staff & divine food. Will certainly return for a longer visit next time.",5,2016,07,06
203,Nice lunch,"My wife and I  went to the Westbury for lunch and I must say we had a very plesant time. 
The waiting staff could'nt do a enough for you. The meal was excellent and very reasonably priced. I would highly recommend it if you are in Dublin.",5,2016,07,05
203,"Great location, excellent service","Stayed here for one night on business but cannot find fault. Not surprising that this is classified as one of the ""Leading Hotels of the World"". First, the staff made me feel very welcome with true Irish hospitality from the moment I arrived. The location is unbeatable being right in the centre of the city with multiple good quality restaurants (we ate in Beeftro's on Balfe Street and had a really good fillet steak) and some great local pubs (Bar Bruxelles, McDaid's, Sheehan's and Neary's) within walking distance as well as easy access to most of the tourist venues that anyone would wish to visit. From a business perspective, the meeting rooms are large and airy with lots of natural light and all the facilities that could be needed. The bedrooms are not huge but are beautifully appointed with all the amenities and comforts (I was in Room 408) and I can report a great night's sleep in a very comfortable bed! Very good common areas and lounges serving delightful afternoon tea or just a lovely area to watch the world go by. Breakfast - a traditional Irish one, of course - was delicious and how lovely to have it served by waiting staff rather than a buffet (other than for juice, fruit, cereals and pastries). I am sure the area around the hotel can be noisy in the evenings/night so would recommend a room either high up or to the back of the hotel. Not cheap but worth every Euro if only for the location and the friendly, professional service and just about 30 minutes (‚Ç¨25 taxi fare) from Dublin Airport.",5,2016,07,05
203,Home again!,"Reviewing my stay last year is a very ""Deja Vu"" affair, as I am greeting again by Staff-as-Friends-as-Family to my favorite hotel in the world: The Westbury.
From Fionn's warm ""C√©ad M√≠le F√°ilte"" to Concierge Tommy's kind hug (and his and Concierge Ashley's indefatigable patience re my too-many bags) to Joseph Dowling both remembering me and recreating his signature hospitality in his Gallery via the newly (and fabulously) recreated Wilde to Magda and Derek and Mariza doing their professional best with extraordinary kindness to Head Concierge Eddie doing his usual best (i.e., singularly spectacular care, with genuine enthusiasm and attention to detail) ... The Westbury has welcomed be back to Dublin ... again.
So much so, I've booked another night!
No Fairer City.
NO better hotel ... in Dublin and, likely, the world.
Hope to see you here sometime, too!

Last year's review:

203,Perfect location to see Dublin's bars and restaurants.,"Our first time to Dublin, we choose a hotel that was close to the center of town.  Very friendly and professional help from the entire staff.  The lobby was beautiful and very relaxing, the rooms were nice and had everything we needed but nothing special (I'm always looking for something special) and the view out toward the rear of the hotel was ordinary.  Just my opinion, the hotel bar didn't do anything for me, but there are so many to get to just outside.

What wasn't ordinary was the location, we stayed four nights and thought to slowly expand our adventures further and further out each day.  We always ended up just a 12 minute walk from the hotel, we finally gave up and realized that most of the good stuff was just outside our room.

They did live up to five star service with their attention to detail and friendliness.  Even as we were driving off in a taxi to the airport at 4 in the morning they had delivered coffee to us from their kitchen while sitting in the taxi, now that's service for you.

Thank you for the wonderful time we had staying with you.",5,2016,07,04
203,excelent meal,"had a meal there last weekend and have to say that the food was delicious 
a nice menu with some interesting impressions of classic dished .presentation and taste were excellent 
service was very good and flexible and attentive",5,2016,07,04
203,Great staff,This has to be one of the best hotels in Ireland. The service is top notch and the comfort and space is just what was required for a relaxing break. Food was good and there are plenty of restaurants around to choose from.,4,2016,07,02
203,Nice but not great,This is a pretty good hotel but I wouldn't call it outstanding.  The rooms are comfortable but bathrooms are small and could do with modernising.  The location off Grafton Street is a real plus also. The staff are pleonasm without being overly proactive.  My colleague and I had flown 24 hours from Australia via Dubai and arrived at about 1pm on a Sunday.  Rooms weren't ready which is ok but maybe an offer of somewhere to freshen up or a suggestion as to where to go in the hotel to wait would have been nice...,4,2016,07,01
203,very nice hotel in an excellent location,"Travelling on business, but did all the tourist things. Very nice hotel in the centre of town, easy walk to shopping mall, trinity  library and temple bar. Taxi or bus to the Guinness factory for a good day out.",4,2016,06,30
203,Old World Charm in a  Modern Setting,"The hotel is grand and located just off beautiful Grafton St. The bar is charming, and the wide-open spaces feel is welcoming after a hard day shopping. I came in to dodge the rain and ended up transferring from Temple Bar to this grand lady of a hotel. It was a wise choice. The rooms are comfy, the beds inviting and the staff genuinely welcoming.I got a great rate becasue I asked for it.  I loved the breakfasts. Truly a treat and a gem of a hotel.",5,2016,06,29
203,"Nice, Modern Hotel in the city","The Westbury is a lovely hotel.  It's clean, modern, and the rooms were nice.  Unfortunately we had just arrived from a smaller city and the staff at our previous hotel were absolutely amazing, so the Westbury paled in comparison.  The staff and rooms were nice, but nothing special; possibly because it was a larger hotel and there were more guests to attend to.  It just seemed a little expensive for an average experience.",4,2016,06,29
203,Wonderful,"What a lovely hotel, and with a perfect location.
The staff was flawless - so pleasant, courteous, and very helpful.  The first room we were given had a problem with the air conditioner which we didn't notice until late in the day.  We reported it and were immediately assured we would be moved the next day. So, the next day we did a little wandering around and when we returned to the hotel around 1:00 we had been completely moved and settled into another room. Great!!
Breakfast was included with our room and although none of us are morning people, we made a point of getting up for breakfast every one of our 5 days stay. Yes, it was that good and the setting so nice. It was both elegant and relaxing.  
We were very pampered  the entire time. It was a wonderful experience in a beautiful hotel.",5,2016,06,28
203,Afternoon High Tea,"Celebrated a friends birthday by booking a high tea experience in the Westbury hotel in June 2016.  Booked table for five of us and arrived on Saturday 18th of June in the afternoon.  The experience was wonderful, the staff were excellent and very attentive.
We had booked the champagne high tea and the champagne was Mo√®t and we had a choice of rose or regular.  The sandwiches and pastries were all freshly made and tasted delicious, there was an extensive selection of teas and coffees and you could change from tea to coffee at anytime and try different varieties. Before we left we were given a small box of chocolates. Wonderful way to spend an afternoon and to celebrate a birthday with friends.",4,2016,06,28
203,Westbury,Amazing hotel.. Staff so pleasant & helpful.. Cocktails fab.. Food divine .. Wonderful Location... Breakfast to die for.. Will defo be back .. Bed so comfortable and spacious room .... In centre of Dublin,5,2016,06,27
203,Perfect for Cocktails,"Met some friends, in the midst of the Ireland game being played, and decided to go somewhere quiet for drinks.  The Westbury was just perfect, sophisticated, service was excellent and the mojitos perfect.",5,2016,06,27
203,Superb Service,"Our stay at The Westbury was wonderful.   The staff is exceptional, providing service which is professional, courteous and also personal.   Being upgraded to a spacious corner suite was a real treat.
The hotel is perfectly situated on Grafton Street, within walking distance of all major attractions in Dublin. 
We will definitely be staying at The Westbury on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2016,06,27
203,Great location and staff,Stayed for two nights and found the room very spacious and comfortable -  great bed and pillows. The room was spotless and all bathroom amenities were good.The staff were very friendly and helpful on check in and helped us find a great restaurant. The location was ideal for shopping and sight seeing as within easy walking distance from many places of interest. I would definately stay again.,5,2016,06,27
203,Great hotel in heart of Dublin,"Stayed for 2 nights and it was very enjoyable stay. Hotel staff is friendly,helpful,always looking to help. Rooms are spacious and beds are fantastic, all linens are top notch. Morning breakfast which we had included was great. excellent selection on the breakfast buffet plus any other food can be ordered from the kitchen .Great service and always a smile. Next time in Dublin I will just book this hotel again and again.",5,2016,06,26
203,Great hotel in great location!,Stayed here pre and post a tour. Good hotel but wasn't overwhelmed. Great location and everyone was nice and welcoming. The breakfast was nice and the hotel was a very modern. They helped us celebrate an anniversary and style and helped us with breakfast to go boxes since we left early for a flight. ,4,2016,06,26
203,Very well loctaed,"Stayed here just for one night with my Mum in a superior twin room. Room beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. Service was impeccable from doorman, to breakfast and housekeeping. So well located in the heart of Dublin. Will return",5,2016,06,25
203,brilliant location,"Great experience all round. Superb rooms very clean and well appointed. Nespresso machine was a plus. Service superb.
Location is very central on Grafton street, Disney store around the corner if you are on  business and need that take home gift. 
Arranged a late check out for 15h00. They charge 25% of the per night cost and quickly arranged",4,2016,06,24
203,Great Dublin location.,"Really wonderful experience. Well maintained,clean rooms with an excellent bed. Best feature was the really great service, courteous to a fault. An excellent location in the heart of Dublin, surrounded by activity, shopping, pubs and restaurants. it was slightly pricey.",4,2016,06,22
203,Terrific!,"My wife and I enjoyed our recent stay at the Westbury Hotel enormously. We are fairly well traveled and found the hotel a lovely spot with much to recommend it. Our room, if not elegant, was spacious, bright, and nicely appointed. I recommend the hotel for many of its features: its efficiency, staff morale, attention to detail, excellent breakfast and food at Wilde, knowledgeable and attentive guest relations director (Joseph) and accommodating concierges. The hotel's ideal location seemed central to everything you'd want to see and do. We had every sense that our well being mattered and that the hotel was conscientiously looking after us, personally.",5,2016,06,22
203,Good holiday ,"The hotel was excellent with good ambience .It was located in the heart of the city.The service and the staff is very courteous .We had a fantastic stay at the hotel making it a memorable vacation.
The food served also awesome. Overall we had an amazing time at the hotel.",5,2016,06,20
203,Beautiful Restaurant in Fantastic Location,"The Westbury offers everything you need with excellent service, beautiful decor and it is in the heart of the city. I used the gym one morning which was small but had the basics covered in terms of machines and weights.",5,2016,06,20
203,Second visit - over priced,"I am writing this review while still in the hotel. This is our second stay in two weeks (we started our Ireland trip in Dublin, made our way around the country, and have returned to Dublin for two nights before our flight out).

This is a well placed hotel with a very responsive staff.  It is perfectly placed in the city center, outstanding breakfast, and acceptable WiFi.  Our first room was quite nice, but our second is far less than ideal (see the picture posted),  We paid extra for a ""Front View"" of the city and from the second floor have only the roof of the lobby and a 100,000 watt light shining into our room all night (and, the room is much smaller than our first and less well appointed).

This was a busy weekend, so this room was $600 a night - for that, you should be able to have a dark room at night.",4,2016,06,19
203,Afternoon tea,"What can I say about the Westbury? Exquisite attention to detail, service is spot on. Excellent quality. If you can't finish the staff will parcel up your goodies for you to bring home. Thoroughly enjoyable experience-I have been several times and it is pricey but is oh so worth the visit.",4,2016,06,19
203,Suite was just ok,"Just back from 2 days R&R with husband and son. We had booked a suite as there were 3 of us and it certainly was not as nice as the last one we had and if I remember correctly it was more expensive this time. . Lounge area very small and the plumbing for the whole hotel obviously goes through our room. It was very noisy and kept me awake on the two nights until all,the guests had gone to sleep! I do love the Westbury, it is a beautiful hotel and certainly will return but not to that room!",4,2016,06,18
203,"Gorgeous, Clean, but some service issues....","Overall this is a beautiful hotel in a great neighborhood.  Easy to get to pubs, food, shopping, transit  -you really can't do better

Some small issues to note-
-When checking in, we got to our room and it was no less than about 90 degrees (F) in there and the AC was broken.  We went to the desk for a new room and they just couldn't figure it out.  They apparently ""assign"" rooms to people ahead of arrival and flexibility was not a strong point, but after about 30 minutes, we got another room
-Oh great,  the AC is working well, but we figure it's slightly better.  By bed time the room had warmed to 91 degrees -the desk seemed ""confused"" when we told them
-Upon returning after day tours the next afternoon we found a repairman in our room, he'd just fixed the AC (I guess there really was an issue) and shared it was a broader issue.  Not sure whey they tried to act like nothing was wrong at the desk
-Finally have some AC and after a quick shower fire up the hair dryer, which starts sparking!  Holy cow!  I call the desk and they seem confused (seriously!?) and ask for a new one  -they say they'll call back.  I eventually borrowed from a friend in another room after a 45 minute wait.  The next morning on the way out (7am) we drop the sparkler off at the front desk and ask for another to be brought up.  That night we return and STILL no hairdryer?  After a third call down, we had one in 5 minutes. Not sure why this was so hard of a task.
All in all- small issues, but theme of lack of accountability/ownership at the front desk. They're VERY nice and helpful on other things, but the real issues are what matter",4,2016,06,17
203,Ireland 2016,"We visits the Westbury for two nights on the 12-13 of June. The hotel is beautiful, very close to shopping and pubs. Check in was delayed as our room was not ready, even though we had requested an early check in. We dropped our bags, had some hot breakfast in the dining room and explored the city for the afternoon. We received a text a few hours later that our room was ready for us. Our room was on the 3rd floor (311) and looked out over the back street. Pretty non descript but it was quiet, which was nice. Furnishings were high end and the room was very clean. We had an early tour booked the next day and returned late so basically we were looking for a comfy bed and a hot shower. Westbury had both. I must specify that we never got to fully experience this lovely hotel because our visit was so short and our itinerary was tight. I must give kudos to the breakfast staff, who were quite busy and very sweet. Also, the trainee, Jason at the checkout desk who was so helpful when he heard we were going to Cork. He wrote out specific restaurant and site recommendations for us and even provided extra water for our train ride! Much appreciated!",4,2016,06,17
203,Excellent Service,"Made last minute reservation at Westbury when our plans in Ireland changed and required us to be in Dublin early.  Everything was excellent, starting with the valet who took charge of our rental car and arranged for Avis to pick it up at the hotel.  The concierge was very helpful, especially when we bought food for the plane ride home and needed it refrigerated.  He took care of it and had it ready for us at check out.  The hotel's location is great, just off of the main streets so that you are nearby but away from the noise and bustle.  I would definitely choose this hotel over other 5 stars we stayed in in Dublin. ",5,2016,06,16
203,Smooth Operator,We spent 2 nights at the Westbury in early June.  Good spacious public rooms and bedrooms and in a great location in the main shopping and eating area.  We were able to walk everywhere. Had a problem in the middle of the night caused by another guest leaving the bath running but the management responded promptly and the following day the Customer Services Manager met with us to offer his sincere apologies even though it wasn't their fault.  Look forward to staying there again.,4,2016,06,16
203,Very Comfortable Stay,"The Westbury Hotel is very conveniently located in Dublin, set back slightly from the busy Grafton Street.  And as has been said before, the staff are extremely well-trained, from the people at reception to the waitresses in the dining room at breakfast. 
    We had a deluxe room on the third floor in a very quiet section of the hotel; it appeared to be a connecting annex .  Considering the street noise at night on the front of the hotel, this room was a very good choice. The beds were very comfortable and there was very good storage space.  My only disappointment was the small size of the bathroom.  
        We did not eat at the hotel except for breakfast which was one of the better hotel breakfasts we've had in years of traveling.",4,2016,06,16
203,Fantastic,"Very friendly,attentive hotel in the middle of Dublin.the staff takes the extra time and effort to look after the guests no matter what the requests. Try a bit of afternoon tea before heading out for a pint or dinner.
",5,2016,06,16
203,Nice Hotel,"The Westbury is centrally located;we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go.  The rooms were nice sized, very clean and quiet.  The staff was professional, friendly and efficient.  The breakfast was very nice.",5,2016,06,15
203,Fine Hotel,"We wanted a nice hotel in Dublin within walking distance of the major sites.  This is the place.  The location was perfect.  While our room was a bit small, it was very nice nicely appointed and immaculate.  Service was superb.  The staff was extraordinarily friendly, gracious, and well-trained.  They went out of their way to make sure the needs of their guests were met.  The breakfasts (included in our room rate) were without question the best we had on our trip across Ireland...and that is saying something.",5,2016,06,15
203,The Staff really make this hotel,"We traveled to Dublin for Bloom and decided to treat ourselves to an overnight at the Westbury Hotel. We experienced truly wonderful staff throughout the hotel from the moment we arrived the valet staff to care of our luggage taking it to the room and parking the car.  I had asked for a quiet room and it was the furthest from the lift at the end of the corridor - we did not hear a thing.  We enjoyed cocktails in the bar, but I was a little disappointed with mine - I felt it was not strong enough. I really enjoyed the breakfast, the room was bright and airy and the choice was excellent. I had fruit, Eggs Benedict and finished up with a mini cake which was gluten free.  Whilst there was not a table with Gluten Free foods options, staff indicated that they could get me anything that I wanted and they delivered.  When I settled my account at reception, my car was waiting for me outside and the valet staff gave me directions on how to navigate the one way systems.  Would recommend the hotel.",5,2016,06,15
203,"Without exception, the staff make this hotel what it is, they were fantastic","I arrived by car around 5pm on a Friday evening feeling a little stressed as google maps was directing me through the pedestrian area!. I had to phone the hotel eventually to get the correct directions. The valet staff gave us a warm welcome, took care of our luggage and parked my car. The room was very comfortable, the beds and bedlinen was of excellent quality. I was a little disappointed with my cocktail, a cosmopolitan - it tasted a little weak and I am not a regular drinker. For me the best part was the breakfast. The area and ambience of the area was fabulous. As a coeliac, I sometimes find it difficult to be accommodated  at meal time. The staff were great. I had eggs benedict and my mom had pancakes. I wanted to finish off my breakfast with a pastry and after asking the waitress, she provided me with two mini cakes, they were beautiful. I found the staff here very accommodating.  When I checked out, my car was brought around for me and the valet gave me instructions on how to navigate the one way systems.  Would highly recommend the hotel.  The staff here have genuine interest in their guests.",5,2016,06,15
203,Amazing hotel,What can I say about this hotel is amazing the staff could not be more friendly and helpful had a girls night away at the weekend had the high tea outstanding and the young man that served us was so professional and could not do enough for us.the staff also booked our table for dinner and we were given umbrellas to take out with us as it was raining.the door staff were amazing putting our bags in the car for us we all felt like royalty will recommend this beautiful hotel too everyone and will be back soon the only place to stay in Dublin üòçüòç,5,2016,06,14
203,Daughter's Birthday,"Have stayed here many times, this stay tops the lot. My daughter has autism and it was her birthday treat and boy did they pull out all the stops. Lucy got a beautiful card and lots of treats from the staff which were left in the room and a testament to her stay in her words 'the best day ever', thank you Westbury ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,2016,06,13
203,Lovely Hotel in the heart of Dublin,"My family and I spent one night at The Westbury after landing in Dublin.  The Hotel is centrally located near all the sights we wanted to see in Dublin.  It is an easy walk from the hotel to Trinity College, Temple Bar, St. Patrick's Cathedral, The Guiness Experience and many, many more.  We walked for hours and explored alll the city had to offer.  Upon our return we had a wonderful dinner right across from the hotel at the Beeftro.  The rooms are very large.  My family of 4 stayed in one room and had plenty of room to spread out.  The walk in closet was perfect for stowing all of our luggage.  The rooms are  very nice and I would highly recommend staying at this hotel.",5,2016,06,13
203,Perfect Time and Place in Dublin,"We ended our weeklong ""luxury"" celebratory trip (2 College grads) in Dublin. The Westbury was the perfect place to end it. No better location to be in Dublin. Staff was excellent. Special shout out to Adrian and Michael, 2 of the concierges who went over and above. Definitely will be back if we make it to Dublin. One last note that I wish I knew was that if you're driving in, do not use google maps or similar. Get directions from the hotel as mapping ignores the fact that the street address of the hotel is not accessible by car. ",5,2016,06,09
203,Great hotel in a great location,"The westbury was and is an icon in dublin. i like to stay there for business and private trips simply because it has a great location and everything to offer one needs when staying at a hotel.

the bar and the restaurant are very good and breakfast simply delicious. will stay there again.",4,2016,06,07
203,Fantastic service and friendly staff,"We have just  returned from a 3 night stay at the Westbury for my Husbands birthday.
We could not find fault with anything, and I travel regularly for my job and experience many many hotels.
The welcome on arrival was friendly and warm, the location is superb, really central to everything. The breakfast in Wilde's restaurant is according to my Husband the best he has EVER had at any hotel.
I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and we will definitely be back. Thank you",5,2016,06,07
203,loved my stay here,"we had two nights here..  It was lovely, the beds were 'fall into and sleep deep'.  I had a water pot for tea and a lovely bath.  Perfect!  We had delicious and well served breakfast in their new breakfast room.. I would stay again~",5,2016,06,06
203,Perfect,"The hotel was wonderful and do close to everything. The staff was warm, welcoming and knowledgeable. I would recommend a stay here to everyone. The check in was easy and they watched our bags so our day was available to us. On the check out they did the same so we could take the train to Howth. We will come again for sure!",5,2016,06,05
203,Afternoon Tea,"I cannot praise this visit highly enough. From the moment we arrived the staff were so pleasant and helpful. The meal was incredible. I am Coeliac so it can be hard watching other guests enjoying things. But I had my 3 tier cake stand laden with sandwiches, fresh scones and sweet treats on top. The whole experience will always stay with me. Expensive but for a special treat please  try it.",5,2016,06,04
203,One word : fantastic,"The staff, all of them, made my stay a memorable experience
Will use it as a comparison in the future
Had minor issue to report at reception, they listened, apologised and then someone from customer service came to talk to me, just great
Room was ok, but who cares when staff are so nice
Breakfast was very good, although getting capuccino was a lengthy affair",5,2016,06,04
203,a great stay in dublin,"this hotel could not have been in a better location....in the heart of it all along with great five star services, this was a great stay...high tea in the lobby was delicious and well served...the lobby is usually filled with guests creating a fun scene...",5,2016,06,03
203,Lovely hotel with lovely staff!,We stayed there for 4 days with my family. We truly enjoyed our stay there. Our hotel is clean and comfortable to relax to after a long day touring Dublin. Breakfast was delectable. The staff is very friendly and always acknowledges us. The location is central to everything. Nice shops around. Unforgettable visit!!,5,2016,06,02
203,Below average,"Stayed here for 2 nights. The location is the only thing good about the hotel. 
The room was way to small for a hotel that claims 4/5 stars. 
Overly busy the staff can't manage at all. 
Food is average nothing special at all. Breakfast was normal- poor service due to crowds. 
Advise u to look elsewhere.",1,2016,06,02
203,"Amazing, but...","Five star five star luxury amenities, incredibly comfortable beds/pillows/linens. We I promised our room at three but did not get it until 4:30. The bathrooms are quite small and dated given the price of the hotel.  We stayed at several B and B's with significantly more updated bathrooms.  Our A/C did not seem to work and we complained the first morning as it got quite hot overnight and opening a window was noisy.  They said yes would look into it. We came back night 2 and it was still warm.  The following morning we complained again.   They said they would look into it. We came back from days activities and it still is not fixed.   We requested a new room at that point. They said they were full and could not move us and gave us a fan for the room.  They offered us a nightcap for our trouble we requested that our laundry be done instead as we were going to be on the trip for 2 weeks. and had planned to launder our clothes. Without hesitation they agreed to do our laundry. They next day they moved our room. I was disappointed in how long it took them to address the problem, but once they addressed it they were over-the-top with their customer service. ",4,2016,06,02
203,Anniversary Afternoon Tea,"I took my wife here during a recent anniversary trip to Dublin, wow.  The service was attentive, the food plentiful and delicious!  We were offered the opportunity to take away what we couldn't eat which we thought was unusual as most places would just clear away the leftovers, nice touch.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for afternoon tea although I'm not sure I could justify staying here overnight.",5,2016,06,02
203,Definitely Not a 5 Star Hotel,"While the guest relations manager and many of the staff did an excellent job, the hotel is old, shabby, desperately needs renovation.  The biggest problem was housekeeping.  Our first room was too dirty to consider sleeping in.  Our 2nd room was better but housekeeping needed to come back to clean some parts of the room that were ignored.

Front desk, concierge both made small but annoying mistakes and although polite, were not on par with what you'd expect from a 5 star hotel.",2,2016,06,02
203,Short Stay at the Westbury Hotel,"We stayed for three nights at the Westbury in late May. The main reception and lounge area of the hotel is very grand and has an iconic feel to it. We were travelling as a party of three as we had our 8 year old daughter and had requested a family room. When we arrived we were told the family rooms were all booked out but had been upgraded with an adjoining room so our daughter had her own room but we could keep an eye on her through the connecting door. For an eight year old going on eighteen she was delighted to have her own space. The rooms are of a good size and very well finished, coffee and tea facilities in each room and fully loaded mini bars. The hotel is right in the centre and its 30 seconds into the heart of the shopping district, they have two different restaurants and the main lounge which did the most wonderful afternoon tea. (Would recommend you try it, it was lovely) we ate in Balfes the brasserie restaurant and had a nice meal. The staff all look lovely and we're very happy to help when we asked for it, however one waitress called Zita who worked in the main restaurant covering breakfast deserves a gold star ( that's what my daughter said her manager should give her anyway). She really went out of her way to make sure our daughter was made to feel welcome, and connected with her.",5,2016,06,02
203,Beautiful afternoon tea,"We had a lovely afternoon tea on a beautiful summers day. We sat in the newly renovated restaurant area only just reopened. The service was very attentive mostly. We were not offered the option of take home of leftovers which is an option seemingly from other reviews. With the generosity of the serve, you will no doubt have leftovers, so remember to ask. A real treat and lovely way to share our significant birthday. ",5,2016,06,01
203,"Great Hotel. Would go back, but not 5 Star","I enjoyed staying at this hotel 5/29/16 - 5/31/16. Friendly and helpful staff, nice quiet air conditioned,clean room, great location, great breakfast. I would go back. However the downside is I did not get to check in until 4:30 pm, poorly run business center taking over an hour to even print out my boarding pass and one employee at reception desk who had an attitude with me when my hotel key didn't work on day two. Normally these would be minor issues, but since I paid more than $2,300.00 for just two nights total for the two rooms I would expect a little more. The price you pay matters.",4,2016,06,01
203,Beautiful ,"This hotel is pure luxury. It's beautiful inside and out, just looking at the decor kept us entertained, lots of detail to take in. Rooms are extremely comfortable, myself and my husband loved the pillows, we looked hard but can't find any as good anywhere! Staff are friendly and very professional. We had one meal in the restaurant and it was delicious, the atmosphere was very relaxed and we took our time. The location of the hotel is fabulous and we found it pretty central for getting around with everything within walking distance. I would definitely recommend and visit again. ",5,2016,06,01
203,First First to the Emerald Isle,"I travelled to Ireland with my sister for the first time, and I was incredibly thrilled with our hotel, the Westbury.  The location can not be beat.  It is centrally located in the heart of the town, and you almost feel like you are on a movie set, it is so quaint. Throughout the entire the stay, the hotel staff from the front desk to the restaurant was TOP NOTCH!  The rooms were very well appointed, and the beds very comfortable.  I will be back to visit this Country and definitely will stay again at the Westbury.  I promise you, luxury, friendliness, cleanliness and an overall enjoyable experience!",5,2016,05,31
203,Very poor,"Staying in room 540

Long queue at desk

Room was like an oven when I entered.  Complained but was told engineer checked the air conditioning unit on the roof and nothing could be done as it was broken. 

Mini bar was locked. Complained and explained it was a group  booking but they insisted on taking a credit card. They then apologised saying they'd made a mistake and they then opened it.

Couldn't open the window even slightly to let some air in as the secondary double glazing was in the way.

Cigarette burn marks on the side table despite it being a no smoking room.

Shower controller had bits missing and was very wobbly.

In their defence they brought fans to the room, offered me a free drink and a room exchange.",1,2016,05,30
203,afternoon tea a real treat,"Went to westbury for afternoon tea. Exceptional service. Made to feel very welcome and relaxed in beautiful surroundings. Every thing was delicious and varied selection. The childrens afternoon tea was nearly as big as the adults. Only recommmendation would be that they had an option of having a more savoury that sweet tray as you cannot finish all the beautiful pastries.A box is given to take home anything not eaten.

A lovely treat",5,2016,05,30
203,"Great location, beautiful rooms, delicious breakfast","We spent one night at the Westbury. It's located on a quiet street just a block away from Grafton St. It's surrounded by fabulous restaurants, cafes, shops, pubs, tourist sights, etc. The feel of the hotel is very warm and welcoming as you enter, and this continues up into the rooms. Our suite was gorgeous - well-chosen furniture, divinely comfortable bed, and bathroom amenities you would actually want to use. The rainhead shower was lovely (shower tap a bit confusing to figure out) and having an additional powder room was very convenient. Other bonuses: safe is large enough to fit a laptop, easy to use A/C system, soft lighting, plugs near bed, other plugs with North American adapter built-in. The breakfast set up was lovely. Low tables and couches were a bit awkward for dining, and the tables were a bit small, but the food was excellent and the atmosphere of Wilde was very calm and relaxed. Appreciated how hot food was made to order, not served at the buffet. Buffet was well supplied and very fresh. Check-in/out were easy and the staff was very friendly. Front and back entrances to the hotel made it convenient to explore in either direction. ",5,2016,05,29
203,Exceeded Expectations ,"""Gracious"" is the adjective that best describes every aspect of our stay. The staff, the service, the accommodations, the amenities, all exceeded our expectations. This was our first visit to Dublin. There is no question where will stay on our next. ",5,2016,05,29
203,Loved this Hotel,"Two nights not enough, a beautiful hotel in the best location. The staff were very helpful and pleasant. A cake and birthday card was delivered to the room for me on arrival which was a nice gesture. 
Breakfast was very good and the rooms were lovely. The bed was so comfortable we did not want to get up each morning but there is so much to see and do and so many bars to try we made the effort.... 
Hope to return to Dublin again and would definitely stay at The Westbury.",5,2016,05,29
203,Loved it,The location is amazing and the staff was very nice and helpful. The breakfast was wonderful and we also enjoyed the restaurant downstairs. The wifi worked very well as did the television. The only problem was the thinnest of the walls. We were woken up by the baby next door every day and could hear people's full conversations.,5,2016,05,29
203,"Rooms are tired, overpriced.",This is not what we are used to when we have stayed at an American Express Fine Hotel....well except for the price.  The common area of the hotel arewell done and the staff is nice but the rooms are worn and the bathrooms need a complete overhaul. It is also in a very touristy part  of town which may appeal to some or may not.  It is aggravating to me that given the amount we are spendings he bathroom toilet doesn't completely flush even after they sent someone to check.  Disappointed.,3,2016,05,28
203,Great venue,"The hotel rooms, lobby and dining areas are the epitome of luxury and comfort.   The staff are super friendly and helpful.   The quality of the food is also excellent.   One drawback was we had to pay ‚Ç¨25 for parking on-site, which was the most expensive for any other hotel we stayed with parking facilities in Dublin.   You would pay this fee to park at the hotels near the airport for a week.   The quality of fitness/leisure facilities in the hotel were certainly not that of a 5 star class but this is the only area that the hotel falls down.   Otherwise it is a magnificent venue for staying in Dublin City Centre. ",4,2016,05,26
203,Gorgeous spot in the heart of the city!,"The Westbury Hotel was beautiful. The rooms were well appointed, if not a little generic.
We had a larger suite, which made it very comfortable. Well appointed mini bar, and snacks. Loved the restaurant Balfes, and the outdoor patio! Would definitely go back again.",4,2016,05,25
203,Excellent Place to Stay in Dublin,"We enjoyed everything about The Westbury, especially the people who worked there. The concierge, the doormen, the wait staff...everyone was friendly and excellent at their job. The rooms were clean, modern and included very nice amenities. We'd go back in a minute. ",5,2016,05,24

203,Great stay at the Westbury for my daughters communion,From when I arrived at the front door to when I left it has been the best experience you could imagine.the staff from the from desk Caroline was brilliant and the concierge Eddie john Lucas Fionn Ashley and joe were so helpful in making my daughters day very special.thanks to Rory for such a warm welcoming and Joseph too.the food was excellent in balfes and the staff too.this is by far the best hotel in Dublin,5,2016,05,23
203,Very nice hotel and great location ,We stayed here for three nights while in Dublin. The service was excellent and hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. The rooms are a good size but the bathrooms are quite small  (pretty common anywhere in Europe) and could use some renovation. All in all this is a hotel that oozes old world charm.,4,2016,05,21
203,The Americans are coming,"One of the truly great hotel in the Capital. Our group arrived early in the morning from the airport and were welcomed in with open arms. The service was amazing and they could not do enough for us. Our rooms were not ready, but the staff put our luggage away safely so we could rush out to play golf.
Three days, not enough to really take in this hotel's location, so close to all things Dublin.",5,2016,05,19
203,Great Stay!,The Westbury was fantastic. My husband and I stayed for 1 night while on vacation. We had a wonderful room and the staff was very accommodating. The hotel is centrally located with access to tons of restaurants and shopping. Overall a Great Hotel.,5,2016,05,18
203,One Nigh at the Westbury,"Met at the desk by Rachel who exceeded all expectations on this crowded, very busy Sunday. The check in process was fast, efficient and professional. Greeted warmly after check-in by Joseph Downing who welcomed us and recommended places to visit, eat and shop. I'm a very frequent visitor to Dublin and while I initially years back picked The Westbury for it's location, I return multiple times every year because of it's service excellence.",5,2016,05,18
203,What a lovely place for our honeymoon!!!,The Westbury in Dublin is a beyond gorgeous hotel with a perfect location for walking around the Dublin city center. We were treated by the staff to a tiramisu like dessert and congratulations for our marriage as we are newlyweds! The bed was soft and the bathroom was very nice. Definitely get the breakfast with your stay! It was so yummy! I really can't say enough nice things about this hotel as long as you can afford a bit of luxury on your vacation.,5,2016,05,17
203,"One of the best, surely","We decided to stay here for our 8th wedding anniversary weekend and at first it was a disaster. The best restaurant in the hotel, Wilde, which we had booked well in advance for our anniversary dinner, was closed for renovations and nobody bothered to warn us before we arrived !

Fortunately Lucia sprang to the rescue and sorted this and many other celebratory arrangements out. She organised our flowers and other nice anniversary touches - thanks Lucia.

Its a great hotel in the old style - full of old world charm but with a 5 star touch. Its got an imposing reception/ foyer incorporating their Gallery Restaurant and meeting/gathering place. A nice place to spend time. 

We were very restricted in our choice of bookable rooms but got a superior room ""on line"" for around ‚Ç¨400 per night. The room was rather small - we would have preferred a larger room or a suite but they had none for sale, either on their own website or on the third party apps.  Pity as money was no object for this special trip.

Now for a couple of bad bits - minor really. The bedroom was small as I have said, the pillows were very balloon-ey and the bed was uneven. The heated towel rail did  not work and the minibar was a ""pay as you go"" unit with no ""guest storage"" space - a shame in an hotel of this quality. For their prices one would expect a proper mini bar.

Our room was at the front of the hotel and was therefore noisy - due to the pubs outside in the nearby street, an unavoidable problem but if you stay, try to get a room thats away from the pub area, especially if you stay at the weekend. Lucia did offer to change our room but by then we had already suffered the problem and were installed so we declined - it just needs bourne in mind if you are staying.

Unusually for Dublin, the room A/C worked fine and the Internet was fast and free. The room was well amenitised but as I have said, small for our tastes.

In conclusion - a very good hotel with excellent service and friendly staff - the problems we did have were put right where possible by Lucia and Manager Joseph Downing also substantially discounted out account because of the problems we encountered and that was a nice gesture.

We will be back.",5,2016,05,17
203,Superb Hotel,"I've stayed here a few times recently and it's now my destination points hen visiting Dublin.

This is a lovely luxury hotel right in the center of Dublin. Great for shops, culture and restaurants. 

The hotel rooms are lovely, some of the standard rooms are a little tight but beautifully appointed and the beds are superb.

The lounge area and bar is a great place to chat and relax and the breakfasts are delightful.

There is a lovely bar/restaurant downstairs called Balfes and great for a relaxed drink or dinner.

The staff in the hotel are second to none and are always helpful and always wanting to help.

I can't wait to be back and intend to spend some more time exploring Dunlin from here.",5,2016,05,15

Always spot a celeb here !! 
Could not fault this hotel ",5,2016,05,15
203,Superb Service ,"As you would imagine this hotel is gorgeous. Beautiful decor, great rooms, lovely bar and dining areas. 

The really winner for me and what sets this hotel apart from the rest is the absolutely outstanding service. All members of staff were fantastic, they take customer service seriously at this hotel and it was much appreciated. A very happy customer! 

A small negative, the 'gym' is a very small room with very limited facilities. But The Westbury is still close enough to St Stephens Green for a good running spot. ",5,2016,05,15
203,Great stay,"Very attentive to detail. We came off our transatlantic flight and went to straight to the hotel. Even though we couldn't check into our room yet, the hotel allowed us to leave our bags while we walked around Dublin. Great stay.",5,2016,05,13
203,Fantastic Hotel in the Heart of the City.,"Hotel was absolutely fantastic, the room had everything we wanted and more. It was my friends' birthday and I asked the hotel to maybe pop something nice in the room and they went above and beyond. They had a balloon, a dessert with 'Happy Birthday' inscribed and a card. They really make every effort to make your stay feel 5 star. ",5,2016,05,13
203,Fabulous Hotel,"We stayed four nights in the Westbury Hotel and could not have been more
pleased.  The location is perfect, very convenient to sights and restaurants.
And the service is impeccable.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The
Assistant manager even sent a birthday cake slice and greeting  to our room. In
addition the breakfasts were quite extensive and very tasty.
We will certainly be staying there again as we recommend it highly!

203,Amazing Weekend in Dublin at the Westbury,"We took a short trip to Dublin over the weekend and decided to stay at the Westbury, which was a great desicion. The hotel is eczellent, such as the staff. Rooms and especially the beds are very comfortable. Next time in Dublin we'll be there again!",5,2016,05,10
203,Luxury in a great location,Central oasis to relax in between sightseeing. Rooms spotless with every amenity. Bars and restaurants in the hotel all excellent. There is a taxi rank right outside. The hotel is in walking distance of the main shopping area and the temple bar area.,5,2016,05,09
203,Superb Hotel,"I organised a trip to Dublin for 4 persons.  Three of the group had never been to Dublin. After 4 nights at the Westbury we could not praise it enough, from the moment we arrived at the hotel front door/ reception/ breakfast/ bedrooms, the hotel and staff were all par excellence.
The location is perfect.",5,2016,05,09
203,FIRST CLASS AMBIANCE AND TOP NOTCH TREATMENT,"From the moment we got out of the taxi we were greeted like long awaited friends or family returning home from  a long trip!  We we treated so well and with such professionalism it made it very difficut to leave to go home.  Here are the best tips: Get a room on 3rd floor or higher and on the corners as they seem larger.  Balfes restaurant had excellent food and the wait staff were super cool.  Also, there is not too much noise from surrounding bars as the windows have excellent sound proofing and all you hear is laughter which is wonderful. ",5,2016,05,09
203,Exceptional service from all staff,"Stayed here for 3 nights in May. The outstanding aspect of my stay at this property was the exceptional service and warm welcome from the staff as soon as you arrive at the front door. The guest relations team and in particular Jack and Alexandra delivered excellent customer service, particularly when there was a problem with the A/C in my room. Upon arrival Jack the Assistant Guest Relations Manager presented me with his business card, I thought this was a nice touch to give a named point of contact. 

I was staying on an American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts rate and this was specifically recognised at check in and all the advertised benefits were made available. The room itself was spacious and comfortable with good wifi. The only issue with the room was the very high temperature due to a faulty a/c unit which could not be repaired. The guest relations team dealt with this exceptionally offering an upgraded room or a cooling fan and even sent up a complimentary bottle of wine. 

The location of the hotel is ideal for guests visiting Dublin for business or leisure, it is ideally located right in the centre of town close to many shops, bars and restaurants. The on site restaurant Balfes was really good and the staff were excellent at dealing with my food allergy to gluten. There is also a great bar on site with a good cocktail menu. 

I would definitely choose this property again and would not hesitate to recommend it.",4,2016,05,09
203,Beautiful hotel,"The hotel is absolutely lovely, it has been done beautifully and the d√©cor is very clean and smart. The staff are extremely welcoming, helpful, friendly and the doormen are very willing to help you. The rooms are lovely and spacious, beds were very comfy. The toiletries in the bathroom are Aromatherapy Associates and are absolutely lovely. The only bad thing I could say is that one of the lamps in the bedroom was missing a light bulb so we could not turn this light on which we would have liked to. We would definitely come back to this hotel and would recommend it to others.",5,2016,05,09
203,What a Place!!,"On arrival the valet took our car and the concierge took our bags.  We were greeted at reception with hot towels and very friendly staff.  Our suite on the 6th Floor was just amazing, four poster bed, sitting area & a lovely bathroom within inbuilt TV.  The service was top quality, every member of staff courteous and friendly.  Even small things like the concierge remembering we asked for a taxi to the Zoo and then asking us how our trip had went later on was a nice touch.  Breakfast in the Gallery was lovely, food good and views of Grafton Street.  We had evening drinks in Balfes bar and also in the marble bar.  The marble bar was beautiful & the cocktails were fantastic, whereas Balfes has more going on i.e. More people/food etc.- just depends what you wanted.  My wife particularly liked the turn down service in the evening, the sweet left on the bed etc.  We also had a nespresso machine in the room which was a pleasant change to standard tea/coffee facilities usually found in the room.  The beauty about this hotel is its location, we ate in a different restaurant every night and all within walking distance. 

Overall would highly recommend to any couple looking a special romantic getaway.",5,2016,05,09
203,Just wonderful,Stayed here 6th of May for 2 nights as a good friend is leaving us to go to Oz. There was 11 of us in total and we book 6 twin bedded rooms . From the moment we arrived we knew our stay was going to be a good one . Check in was efficient and we was then approached by Jack who enquired about the purpose of our stay . We informed him and he kindly offered to lay on a couple of bottle of champagne for us in the evening ( how lovely) and my friend also received cakes and a hand written letter in her room . Rooms were clean and spacious and the beds very comfy. Staff were just great and the wonderful. Joe who was so knowledgeable and friendly( proper gent) was an added bonus . I loved this hotel and everything about this hotel and I cannot wait to return.,5,2016,05,09
203,Shirt weekend break,"Nice hotel but not worth the money! I've stayed in much cheaper more luxurious hotels over the world! Food and drink well over priced for What you get & ‚Ç¨30 for a breakfast! Says it all!
Very dated and some areas looking tatty! 
Will definatly choose a better hotel next time!
Room has everything you want, but attention to detail needed! Bathroom lights did not work, safe battery's were flat, coffee machine was broke & remote control batteries dead, & pay to view movie system broke for whole period I was there even though an engineer tried to fix it",3,2016,05,08
203,Beautiful afternoon tea on a sunny Dublin Sunday,"Went to afternoon tea in this beautiful hotel as a birthday present from my sister and I was massively impressed! We were served really excellent quality food by the very friendly and efficient waiter, Tim, and thoroughly enjoyed every minute. It was very relaxing and worth every penny. When compared to my experience of afternoon tea in the Shelbourne, this was FAR SUPERIOR. Cheaper, better quality sandwiches, scones and desserts, better service and a more relaxed environment. Would strongly recommend the Westbury if you're thinking of afternoon tea in Dublin and will be back again myself! üòä",5,2016,05,08
203,Excellent hotel in the  centre of town,"The Westbury is  located in the heart of Dublin and is  centrally located within easy walking distance of the main attractions. The staff is particularly welcoming and somehow or other seemed to remember our name every time they greeted us or asked if they could be of assistance. The Guest Relations Manager managed to book a table on very short notice in Dublin's most well-known (and most expensive) Michelin -starred restaurant, but suggested that we might dine better and in a  more relaxed (and less expensive) restaurant. Accordingly he managed to change the booking and we had a great meal. Our room was quite large with a four-poster bed and the only minor drawback was that the bathroom was a bit on the small side (albeit well-equipped).
All in all, an excellent choice.",5,2016,05,08
203,Fantastic Location!,"The Westbury is our choice hotel when returning to Dublin for a short break or special occasion. Everything about the hotel is pure class and you are always treated with the utmost respect. Brilliant altogether!
Brian R",5,2016,05,06
203,Impeccable detailing makes this top notch hotel,"I went to Dublin for a weekend jaunt from Toronto and was suggested to try the Westbury as my hotel.

Coming from a background in hotels (the Fairmont chain) I love a good place but mostly I am wowed by the ""little things"" that make a stay extra special. The Westbury has this in spades.

Firstly, coming off a plane having not slept all night and fighting a 6 hour jet-lag, I did not think it possible to get into my room before the traditional 3pm check in time and as it was 10am, I was simply going to leave my bag and brave the city on no sleep. The friendly and attentive staff at the front desk, championed by Rory, ushered me into my room immediately with no hesitation and his genuine approach to how I was feeling and did I want to see a doctor was so kind and very much appreciated.

The hotel has the most exquisite lobby lounge and is a perfect place to cozy up on one of their super plush sofas (in velour/chenille no less) and treat yourself to some delicious scones and jam and cream. The Irish Whiskey Cream tea is a must!

The following day, Rachel at the front desk, so kindly helped me with my navigation and suggested 2 great places (Dublinia- a viking/Medieval experience and the ""Winding Stair"" for dinner). She also told me about ""Darkey Kelley's"" a famous Irish pub with fantastic ceilidh style music that was exactly what we were hoping for during our stay.

Generally, the Irish people are generous, kind and extremely friendly. Everywhere we went we were treated with such patience and smiles that it made it a very sad departure indeed.

The rooms at the Westbury were stylish and spacious with a very lovely bathroom and shower.

I am not sure when I am getting back to Dublin, but if you want to treat yourself to a true BOUTIQUE experience with no fake frills just impeccable styling and pedigree, do not hesitate to stay here.",5,2016,05,05
203,They strive to please,"This was my first stay at the Westbury. Staying four nights while visiting Dublin. 
The location is brilliant, close to shops and dining. 
The high tea at the hotel was a pleasure in all aspects, a beautiful setting, wonderful food and tea. They cater and welcome children for high tea and my girl of 8 says it was the highlight of her trip. Rooms were spotless and comfortable. 
The price for the stay was hefty however I believe this can be justified by that fact that this is the best location in Dublin and the service was up to par with what I have experienced at prestigious 5 star hotels elsewhere.",5,2016,05,05
203,WESTBURY IN DUBLIN IS AN EXCELLENT HOTEL,"I have stayed in Dublin a few times but this is the first time I had stayed at the Westbury. It is well worth the stay. The location just off Grafton Street is fantastic, It is central to everything. The Staff are all professional, helpful and high quality. From the moment I was greeted on entry to the departure I was provided pro-active and helpful assistance. Nothing was too much trouble. The rooms are lovely, clean and very comfortable. The food was great. ",5,2016,05,05
203,The best hotel in Dublin,I've stayed at the Westin as well and The Westbury was better.  They customer service is impeccable.  They make you feel like you are staying in a boutique small hotel but you have all the amenities and facilities of a larger hotel.  The breakfast was superb.   I was traveling with 7 adults and an 18 month old and everyone enjoyed it including the 18 month old that got his own Westbury teddy bear.  As far as I am concerned I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in Dublin. ,5,2016,05,04
203,Outstanding Hotel,Luxurious hotel in the ideal location in Dublin.  Service was outstanding.  Included breakfast in the morning was delicious and included a nice buffet with fruits and pastries along with a made to order menu with multiple hot items.  Only issue was that the A/C was not very powerful.,5,2016,05,04
203,Simply the best in Dublin,"I recently had the strange opportunity of staying in 3 of Dublin's so called best hotels in the space of a week - first night the Merrion, second night the Fitzwilliam, and third night the Westbury. And, hands down, without question, the Westbury is simply the best. The others aren't even in the same league - at least my experiences weren't. My reviews on the Merrion and the Fitzwilliam can be read on their respective profiles, but to summarize: the doorman at the Westbury should teach all the others. He is there when you need him, and not when you don't. He knows when to step in, and when to step away, and he always has a smile, even on the dreariest of days.  I know he's been there a while, but it's evident why.  He's just really great at his job. The check-in staff were welcoming and chatty in a non-pretentious genuine way. A real welcome. The room was easily 3 times the size of that in the Merrion or Fitzwilliam, and the furnishings, while far less fussy than the Merrion and warmer than the Fitzwilliam, were simply far more luxurious than both.  The bathroom was relatively speaking as large, and was clean and as luxurious as the room.  The a/c worked, the room was quiet, and I woke up wanting to stay another night, not escape as I did from the others.  Lunch in the Gallery was fabulous. The staff weren't too numerous and hovering unnecessarily or judgmental, and the ambiance was a bustling Dublin in the background. Ordinarily I would have booked the Westbury for my whole stay, but it wasn't available for my first two nights, hence the stays at the other two. The only upside to the stays at the other hotels is a whole new appreciation for the Westbury and confirmation that it is simply the best in Dublin.",5,2016,05,03
203,Perfectly located hotel where service shines,"As a local, I often use this hotel for business meetings, lunches etc but thought that an overnight stay was well overdue. The location is superb and I would recommend it for that alone to anyone visiting Dublin. It has all the polish you would expect from a hotel of this standard.However, as I always say, the difference between a good and a fabulous 5 star hotel is service, service and service. The Westbury excels here. Firstly there always appeared to be enough staff around and they all smiled constantly, Their approach was natural and welcoming without any over the top formality. They handled a particularly busy breakfast sitting with great professionalism. We had some of the best pre dinner cocktails in the bar followed by a very relaxed dinner in the gallery. It all just seemed so effortless in the best sense of that word. I will continue to recommend this wonderful city centre haven to friends and colleagues. Well done all.",5,2016,05,03
203,Amazing cocktails,"We arrived in the late afternoon and sat in the bar area, we had just dropped in for a snack but ended up staying 3 hours. The most amazing and skilled cocktail mixologist, whose name is Michael, awaits you. Wow! Such skill. He made perfect Manhattan's. 
I ordered the Caesar salad with anchovies, perfect, my husband had the pear soup, beautiful and it was served with lovely artisan brown bread.  We will be back very soon.",5,2016,05,02
203,I'll Be Back.,"Just spent two nights in this first rate hotel, an excellent location right off Grafton in the heart of Dublin. Well-known pubs, The GPO, Temple Bar, Merrion Sq & St. Stephen's Green all within walking distance. The rooms are spacious & luxurious with no detail overlooked with even an umbrella in the closet. Minor complaints: slight room noise through the connecting door and noise from the room above kept us up one night into the wee hours (That's on me, though. I should have called the front desk). Odd because any hallway noise was undetectable. Also, the heating/cooling system was inconsistent (I like it cool at night). That said, the breakfast is excellent and reasonable (why waste valuable daylight looking elsewhere?). Finally, I must say that I stay in hotels all the time and the service at TW sets the standard for others to follow. The staff is friendly, courteous, can't do enough for you and more importantly seem happy to do it. Well done, Mr. O'Gorman.",5,2016,05,01
203,Afternoon Tea,Incredibly professional staff in a beautifully situated room. Superb selection and choice of food (including vegetarian) provided. Staff helpfully packed up the uneaten pastries in beautiful white boxes for us to take home. Wonderful experience,5,2016,05,01
203,"Great Service, Excellent Location","This hotel is located just off Grafton Street, in the midst of shopping, restaurants and nightlife. The room itself was spacious and had a Nespresso coffee machine as well as standard kettle. The bed was comfortable and the shower and toiletries were decent. Balfes restaurant in the hotel is a great spot for brunch. Staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a comfortable and pleasant stay.",5,2016,04,28
203,The perfect Dublin hotel,"Up until about 12 years ago we stayed at different downtown hotels in Dublin.  Then we stayed at the Westbury and have stayed there ever since.  It is a fantastic hotel with excellent customer service, perfect amenities and central location to the hub of activities in Dublin.   Only on one accession was there a short difficulty with the air conditioning and we were pampered as special guests for the remainder of our visit.  Highly recommend this hotel  ",5,2016,04,27
203,Dublin X3,"This is our 3rd time to Dublin and the Westbury never disappoints. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff are delightful. If you have the opportunity to stay here you will not be disappointed. The location is optimal, just of Grafton street and steps away from everything Dublin has to offer. ",5,2016,04,27
203,"Service, Comfort, Quality, Value and all in abundance.","There can be no doubt that the Doyle group of hotels have a class product.  This is without question or venue of choice when we come up to Dublin and require to stay overnight in the city, yes driving to the hotel itself can be a challenge depending upon the hour of the day, but form the moment that you hand your car keys over to the ever-courteous doorman and climb the stairs to reception you are cocooned in a place of comfort and relaxation.  From the warmth of the smile at check-in to the 'can't do enough to help you' attitude of every member of the team that you meet during your stay, you are made to feel unique and special but in a non-suffocating way - you're staying with your 'other family'.  The rooms are well appointed, we prefer going for the front facing rooms, the amenities as you would expect of a hotel in this category, and the beds are sublimely comfortable with gorgeous crisp white linen.  Breakfast is an absolute delight, with an array of fresh items through to the full Irish (but no potato cake?), however our hidden pleasure is getting back to the room late, perhaps after a concert, and getting the room service with a toasted cheese and ham sandwich - it is decadent heaven, and that's a new level for a toasted cheese sandwich to achieve, you will not be disappointed!
One other distinct advantage of this hotel (there are many if truth be told) is that just yards from the door is McDaids - the place in Dublin for a proper pint of the most famous dark beer in the world.  How can it get any better...",5,2016,04,26
203,Lovely,"An excellent location, with a wonderful room was the perfect tonic for the bustle of Dublin Christmas shopping.  Slightly spoiled by the lack of seating for residents in both the bar area and also in the lounge.  Breakfast was good when we finally got served, but the staff were definitely overworked and prone to mistakes.",5,2016,04,24
203,4 stars,"My sister and myself visited here for my birthday treat from All the family.
It was a lovely hotel , but needs attention to their health and safety in some areas, especially in bedroom area.625' they will know when they read this review .I will say no more.
 There are little details that need attention on all areas
We had a drink in hotel .the second stay of our evening 21st couldn't be more obliging ,third evening 22nd attention not the best. 
Thank you to Joseph for sorting out our  a problem . 
BUT We did enjoyed our stay thankyou.

203,"wonderful few days escape, with service to match the star rating","My partner and I stayed at the Westbury for 3 nights over a short holiday from London.  The service was exactly what I would expect from a nice 5star hotel.  Check in was fast, efficient and professional. We hired a car with help from the wonderful concierge staff and were able to extend an extra day with little-to-no notice without any trouble.  Breakfast was very adequate, although quite expensive. (shame the dinning area was under refurb)
The room was clean, spacious and turn down service was intuitive and very welcome after a long day.
If you utilise the hotels valet service (25 euro) you may not be advised of the cost unless you specifically ask. *This is common in many 5star hotels*
Thank you to all staff, I would definitely stay again",5,2016,04,24
203,A great hotel but stay slightly spoils by renovations,"What a wonderful hotel right in the centre of Dublin and fantastic surroundings. The place isn't cheap and you will pay 25 euros if you want the full Irish breakfast (if not included in your room rate). But it stood up to its 5 star rating. On the downside we were located on the second floor above a room that was being renovated. Hammer drilling started at 8:30 on both Friday and Saturday and while I appreciate work needs to be done we weren't told of the disruption. We didn't spoil our stay with a complaint but we did mention when checking out and the receptionist seemed oblivious to the fact that any work was going on or may have caused disruption. 

I would definitely stay again and it was extremely nice to be in the heart of Dublin. Perhaps the hotel management can wake up to the issue that we didn't want waking up with such a racket at that time.",4,2016,04,23
203,Top class hotel.,"Great Hotel, enjoy !

We have just returned from a weekend in the Westbury Hotel, Dublin and feel this is a great hotel. 

If you have already booked or are about to book, you would be hard pushed to get a better one in Dublin. Just rest easy and enjoy. 

First, the location is absolutely perfect. It is only 50 yds from the middle of Grafton Street (great area for shopping, Brown Thomas, top quality store, only 2 mins walk away), it's also very close to Trinity College, the popular Templebar District, St Stephan's Green and only 10 mins walk from the GPO and O Connell Street.  The Westbury is indeed the ideal base to explore the city

Now the Hotel itself, .......well this just exudes class, the lobby is excellent, very well decorated with a hotel check-in which is fast and efficient. 

The staff, from those that welcome you at the front door and reception, to the cleaning and bar staff are all warm and welcoming. They are all so pleasant and everyone of them extremely helpful. You get the feeling that they genuinely appreciate you staying in their hotel and that is always a great sign. 

The rooms are nicely appointed, though be aware the rooms may have different sizes of beds depending on the grade of room you opt for. The basic room with the Queen size bed is indeed small bed, at about 4'6"" wide. Still it is extremely comfortable, but be prepared a small one. The room is very clean and nicely set out. 

The bathrooms are nicely set out. Our room had a step in (bath) shower, this was good quality and water pressure. 

The Westbury has very good and free wifi for its guests, this works throughout the hotel and effectively in the bedrooms. The rooms also have coffee making facilities, good hairdryer, robes, slippers and a good room safe. 

The breakfast is absolutely fantastic, there is great choice of food and its of the highest standard. The staff here are particularly good and their attentiveness is second to none. There is buffet facility with fresh pastries, natural freshly squeezed juices, fruit and cereals and then a menu for cooked breakfast, quality teas and coffee. Breakfast served from 7am to 11am at the weekend.

We had a slight issue during our stay and the staff were excellent in terms of how this was handled. We were very impressed and satisfied. I would commend Rachel on the front desk for her help in this regard. She dealt with the matter, immediately and very effectively, ensuring our experience in Dublin and the Westbury was enjoyed to the full. 

Top quality hotel.",5,2016,04,21
203,Just lovely ...,"Perfect location, friendly helpful staff without being over bearing, main areas and bar really very nicely done.
We had a large room which was very clean and beautifully decorated, good nights sleep!
It's a very special place that makes you feel cosseted and special.",5,2016,04,21
203,"Best Full Irish Breakfast, Excellent Pool for Swimmers","The ""Full Irish Breakfast""  at The Westbury  is the best hotel breakfast I have ever had.  Smoked Salmon, Scrambled eggs, sausages, toast - wonderful.  The guests look quite elegant and what i noticed most is that people are actually talking to each other. Its a great introduction to Dublin after a night flight from across the pond.  My room was well thought out and small details made all the difference - delicious caramels, a well lit bathroom and truly comfortable bed. For swimmers, the Westbury has a deal with a gym right across the street. They gave me a bag with a lovely fluffy town and some slippers and I crossed the road to a great lap pool that i had to myself.  The perfect cure for Jet Lag.  I will never stay anywhere else in Dublin. Superb hotel.",5,2016,04,20
203,OMG!!,"The Westbury Hotel is beyond words!!  My tour was originally scheduled to stay in another hotel, but due to unforeseen circumstances, we were upgraded to the Westbury!  I am so happy we were!!!  Starting with the liveried doorman, who helped me out of the car, I knew I was in for a good experience!!  The lobby is adorned with wonderful crystal chandeliers, and even the light fixtures in the halls exude luxury.  Every employee acted like all they wanted was to make me happy!  My room was so beautifully appointed and comfortable.  While we were out for dinner, the room attendant came into my room, replenished the snack bar and the towels, picked up the room, straightened my things, turned down my bed, and put a chocolate on the pillow!  Rarely do I enjoy a night's sleep like I did that one.  The next morning, we departed Dublin, but I  truly hated to leave the Westbury!!",5,2016,04,20
203,Nearly Brilliant,"Stayed here on business. The location is perfect, just off Grafton Street right in the heart of South Dublin City. It can't be beaten for location.
The staff are VERY welcoming without being at all overbearing - they have customer service very well pitched here.
The main areas are very nicely done and the bar is beautiful. Very knowledgeable, friendly mixologist.
Balfe's Brasserie was fine with a pretty decent steak. Expensive, though.

The room was fine, small but about average for a city hotel. Nicely decorated and clean!

The only let down was the housekeeping. they tried to enter the room 3 times before 9am which was irritating as it was the first ""lie in"" I'd had in a long time!
Also on leaving and entering the room each day there were housekeeping carts and laundry right outside the room in the corridor - not a great impression.

Otherwise for location, staff, and main areas it's excellent.",4,2016,04,18
203,Mum and Dad were so well looked after,"I booked the Westbury for my parents who were celebrating an anniversary with a trip to Dublin. From the moment our car pulled up outside the front door until the time we left every single member of staff went out of their way to look after them. The room was beautiful, the location cannot be bettered and I understand the breakfast was out of this world! Thank you for making my parents feel so cossetted and special.",5,2016,04,18

Great location to eat, walk about, grab a taxi, 15 minute or less walk to train station, 5 min walk to our bus tour pick up area (Molly Malone statue). Room service and onsite restaurant very good. Wife had a business trip and I came with her.",5,2016,04,14
203,Amazing Moet Afternoon Tea,"As soon as we arrived we were shown to our window seat.  We were told we had the best seat in the house & we certainly did. A young lady explained the menu to us & did say that if there was something we didn't like we could substitute if for something else.  We were asked if we would like our Moet or Tea first, we opted for the bubbles first.  There was a great atmosphere in The Gallery, lots of people in for Afternoon tea & also lunch.  So I would suggest book well in advance as this is very popular.  So the Afternoon Tea arrived & our Tea.  Everything about it was delicious. There was a good selection of sandwiches & when one of the waitresses saw that we have nearly finished the sandwiches, she asked would we like more. We refused as we still had two tiers to go.  The scones were still warm, they came with clotted cream, butter & jam to the side. The beautiful colourful desserts were saved until last & they were just amazing.  So many flavours. We could not finish it all, you had the option to take anything you didn't finish home with you & it would all be wrapped up in a lovely box.
When we paid the bill, it was ‚Ç¨55 per person, we both received a small box of Lilly O'Brien chocolates with 5 sweets in it.  I think this is a really nice touch.
I would highly recommend Afternoon Tea in the Westbury & I do hope to go back some day.  All the staff were very friendly & professional.
Certainly",5,2016,04,14
203,Westbury Hotel spring 2016,"The accommodations at the Westbury were very nice.  While my room was as expected, my friend had a room with a strange odor and she was moved immediately.  The staff responded to all of our concerns over our visit (5 days) with great concern and care. When things went wrong, they were corrected immediately.  The staff was very friendly and helpful and my visit was very satisfactory.  The on-site restaurants and bars were well attended and pleasurable.  You can't beat the location and we were able to walk to most meeting places and many of the sites to see.",5,2016,04,14
203,Simply the best,I have stayed in The Westbury for 2/3 day breaks a number of times in recent years. I absolutely love it. The staff are extremely friendly and attentive. The food is always top quality ; I like the relaxed ambience of the Gallery when dining. I had need for a firmer mattress than is their norm because of chronic lower back stiffness. I had moaned about this on a previous visit but Mr Vincent O Gorman contacted me at the time and resolved everything. This time I slept like a baby. I strongly recommend this hotel.,5,2016,04,12
203,"Perfect Retreat, Superb Service, Accommodating Staff","We decided to return to The Westbury, which is located right on Grafton Street and in the heart of Dublin. When we arrived, which was rather early, they quickly accommodated us and had the opportunity to unpack, refresh ourselves and enjoyed our extended weekend in Dublin. We loved the staff and the friendly atmosphere. The new dining room (which was under construction) is fabulous. We will return!",5,2016,04,11
203,Mini  Moon,We stayed here for a weekend break as we had received a gift voucher as a wedding present. I mentioned this when reserving  and thought no more about it. On the first evening the turndown team had sprinkled the bed with petals and left a dessert on a plate with congratulations in chocolate on it. Also they wrote a lovely card wishing us a happy life in the future! such attention to detail and all the other small fabulous things meant our stay here was wonderful relaxing luxurious and 100 % enjoyable. Loved everything about it! It is expensive but you get what you pay for .. or your gift card pays!,5,2016,04,11
203,The best in Dublin!,"You simply cannot fault this place. From the minute you walk up to the front door, there is nothing they will not do to make you feel welcome. 
Our stay was fabulous and the staff were amazing ( with a special mention for Cathal in the Marble bar ) who went out of his way to ensure we were well looked after on a very busy Saturday evening. We will definitely be back.",5,2016,04,11
203,Great hotel and location,"My wife and I had a great experience staying at The Westbury Hotel. The  hotel personnel were fantastic, starting with the Doormen, Reception, Maid service and Restaurant personnel, all made us feel very welcome. The hotel is located near several main points of interest. We will return to The Westbury and we definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2016,04,11
203,Perfect Hotel for a weekend stay in Dublin,"The Westbury Hotel  is perfectly located for a weekend in Dublin, you're in the heart  of the city, close to sights, shops and restaurants. The restaurants and bars within the hotel were excellent however the hotels crowning glory is their staff. Everybody we spoke to and asked something of was charming and helpful, 10/10. The only reason I failed to give the Westbury full marks was that I found the room a little stuffy especially at night and the lighting was subdued, I like a brighter room.",4,2016,04,11
203,Superb Service in the Heart of Dublin,"Booked two rooms for a family stay and three nights in Dublin. From the moment we arrived the staff could not be more helpful or professional. Special mention to Magdalena, Assistant Guest Relations Manager, who did more than we could have asked for in arranging our rooms and ensuring we were satisfied. Our rooms were clean, spacious and very comfortable and well equipped. Loved the addition of Balfes Bar and Restaurant to the hotel, and we both drank and dined there on a number of days. Again, the staff were both responsive and very helpful. There is a level of service  and attention throughout the entire management and staff that was simply exemplary and one that sets a bar for all LHW properties. I typically wait a few days afterI return from a location to post so I can be objective. I so enjoyed the stay that I have already booked for a future visit next month.",5,2016,04,10
203,Fantastic staff,"On a girly weekend, wanting to have a nice lunch and coffee, but also wary of time for our flight home. The staff were so friendly and aware of our needs to pay bill asap. Would definitely visit again, food and service was outstanding.",5,2016,04,09
203,Absolutely superb in every way!,"Stayed at the Westbury for 7 nights. Due to the length of our stay we chose a Luxury King Bed suite. We chose the non-cancellation rate that included breakfast. I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel. The room was very spacious, every amenity, the breakfast was absolutely delicious with a very wide variety of offerings. Every single person we met who worked there was polite, helpful nothing was ever too much trouble. However, I must give a very big shout out to the concierge. We spoke to them several times a day whether it be for sight seeing advice, dinner reservations or just general questions. Ed, Ashley and Tom of the concierge need to be commended for a job very well done. Especially Ed..... We were visiting my daughter who is studying abroad there. Ed told my daughter if she needed any additional help after my husband returned to the States she is welcome to stop in and ask. If that just doesn't say it all as to what to expect from this hotel I don't know what does. I wish I could give the 10 stars!  ",5,2016,04,09
203,Wonderful Stay!,"Highly recommend The Westbury. The staff are so friendly and helpful. 
We needed a last minute dinner reservation for 14 people and the concierge went out of his way to find us one, even though it was Saturday night. 
Location is perfect, right in the center of town",5,2016,04,08
203,Cocktails üç∏üç∏üç∏,"We came here for cocktails on a Sunday afternoon before we got flight home, Omg fantastic, well worth the price!!!! We were staying at the Clarence (won't be again, definitely here next time). 
It was total luxury and sets itself apart from all the other hotels in Dublin. I loved it. ",5,2016,04,08
203,Wonderful stay,"My husband and I had a lovely stay at the Westbury for his 30th Birthday. Location is great just off Grafton street and St Stephens green with its shops, bars and restaurants and temple bar a short walk away also. Nothing was too much trouble from arranging balloons in the room before arriving, a surprise cake as well as being met on the door and also being given an umbrella when we said we were going on a trip to Wicklow mountains national park. Lovely room, very clean and modern. Would upgrade to a front view  room next time though as we just looked over the back of the hotel but not in the room much so not a problem. Lovely Brunch and breakfast at Balfes the trendy bistro joined to the hotel. Great for an evening cocktail too. Very friendly staff. Many thanks for making my husbands 30th one to remember ",5,2016,04,08
203,Dental Reunion,"The room was on the small side, but had everything it promised. 
Great central location for Dublin with very helpful staff who knew the cities attractions,.
Breakfast was a delight with a great choice no matter what your preference.
A well deserved 5*s.
",5,2016,04,07
203,Great Location,"We stayed here for two nights in March. The lounge and bar area are both lovely. Afternoon Tea was great, I would particularly recommend the children's Afternoon Tea. The location is superb, the staff friendly and accommodating as well as being a lovely hotel in itself!",5,2016,04,07
203,"Wonderful service, great location","My husband, two children (ages 12 and 15) and I stayed for 6 days at the Westbury Hotel the week before Easter.  We were first time visitors to Ireland, so we had a number of questions for the concierge.  The concierge desk was wonderfully helpful, assisting us in renting a car and suggesting what we should make sure to see when we took side trips from Dublin.  The staff overall was very friendly.  We didn't eat meals other than breakfast in the hotel, but the breakfast buffet was extensive and very satisfying.  We also very much enjoyed the cocktails in the bar.  The rooms were clean, comfortable, and quiet.  The location of the hotel couldn't be much better if you want to be near the city center.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,04,06
203,Best Hotel in Dublin ,"The Westbury is the crown jewel hotel of Dublin. Everything from A to Z is done with perfection. There is no detail that is left to chance from the attentive staff and superlative service to the spacious, clean and comfortable rooms. Additionally,  the property is located in THE prime location for shopping and dining off of Grafton Street. The building itself is set on a quiet street, yet steps from all. As a travel industry professional of over 20 years, I have stayed in some of the best and most exclusive properties in the world. I would rate The Westbury amongst the very best! ",5,2016,04,06
203,Afternoon Tea with friends,"We went to The Westbury for a friends birthday celebration for afternoon tea. This is a real treat! The lounge was alive with atmosphere as lots of groups gathered for a mouth watering afternoon tea. We shared 3 between 5 of us. Lots of beautiful desserts, sandwiches, scones & wraps washed down with a tasty glass of champers. Staff were excellent very friendly couldn't do enough for our group. A few hours of celebrity treatment and well worth the money we paid for an afternoon of sheer bliss. ",5,2016,04,06
203,A wee overnighter,"Excellent overnight stay in an amazing hotel. So close to Grafton Street & the city centre. 
Hotel staff excellent & most friendly especially concierge door men who even programmed the sat nav on departure. 
Room very clean, warm & impressed by nespresso machine. 
Highly recommend & hope to be back. ",5,2016,04,05
203,Pretty damn good,"My first time in Dublin and thus was a great place to stay. Great location, room was great, bed was comfortable, staff were good (we checked in and our booking had somehow disappeared -  the front desk staff fixed things for us immediately with no fuss at all) nice bar area - absolutely no complaints at all and have recommended several times since. Many thanks for a great stay.",4,2016,04,05
203,Lovely place to spend an afternoon,"I had some friends staying in this hotel for a 2 night stay, I came into town to meet them for some retail therapy and then to sit and chat and generally catch up as we do not see each other often enough.
After our shopping we headed to the lounge in The Westbury for coffee and snacks and a few drinks. We only intended staying a short while here, but as we were looked after so well we just stayed here to catch up.  Some of us had sandwiches, Salads, soup, and everything was lovely.  We then had a few drinks and we were able to put everything on a tap which made it simple for us all to fix up at the end.  The service was great, and the staff were all lovely and very attentive.  Next time we hope to try the Afternoon Tea as it looked lovely.
I would highly recommend this hotel to meet your friends/family any time.",4,2016,04,05
203,Wonderful Stay,"Stayed here on a recent Sunday night and found it to be so welcoming, friendly and customer focused in a beautiful location and with fantastic rooms and common areas. All topped off by a superb, and comprehensive, waiter served breakfast. End to end a great experience.",5,2016,04,05
203,Lovely hotel but...,"Was here for a business trip. Gorgeous hotel and rooms and conveniently located. I have a complaint with the front desk- twice I asked for wake up calls after I was offered and never heard a peep either time. The second time, I nearly missed my flight home, no joke! I was stressed out about it while checking out and was told By front desk to cheer up. I wasn't really in the mood, as I was quite literally the last person on my plane. Next time I'll just set my cell phone alarm I guess!",3,2016,04,05
203,Perfect location,"The Westbury is a very nice hotel in the perfect location in Dublin.  Just steps from Grafton Street, it felt like no landmark or restaurant we wanted to visit was more than a 15 minute walk.  We stayed in a deluxe king.  The room was a nice size and the bed was very comfortable.  Turn-down service was a nice surprise.  We ate dinner at Balfes one night- it was quiet, the staff were attentive, and the food was delicious.  The staff at reception were very helpful, gave us a map on the first day and arranged for a cab to the airport upon departure.  The only issue we encountered was the water temperature in the shower was very fickle both days.  In the middle of showering, the temperature would suddenly become scalding hot or freezing cold.  Also, the wi-fi signal was not always strong enough to connect with my cell phone, but my boyfriend's computer connected okay.",5,2016,04,04
203,Excellent hotel brilliant location,"Our room was a suite and it was definitely worth the extra money. Very big, immaculate. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was excellent, so much choice. The location of the hotel is superb the centre of the shops bars and restaurants. Have stayed here five times in all and would definitely return.",5,2016,04,04
203,Great stay,"Very friendly, great location, luxury and very comfortable. Highly recommend. The rooms are great and of a high standard, the area at the front on the hotel. Staff are particularly helpful and breakfast at Wilde was delicious.",5,2016,04,04
203,Weekend in Dublin,"Great Hotel, central location ideal, service and quality very good
Highly recommended.
Dublin is very special to us, the people the welcome, the taxi drivers, the waiters all very helpful and cheerful, the whole experience.That is why we are regular visitors over the past 50 years,.
This was our golden wedding anniversary and the only way to celebrate this was to go back to Dublin, we visited on our honeymoon 50 years ago , beat that folks!!!.",5,2016,04,04
203,Martin H. Belfast.,"I stayed here with my wife on Saturday night having stayed many times before. The level of service by all members of staff was exceptional. We tried the new Vamos cocktails and they were amazing. Later we dined in the hotel restaurant, Wilde and found both the food and staff fantastic. There was a lovely atmosphere throughout the hotel. Sunday involved afternoon tea and people watching. All in all a truly memorable experience and one to be repeated hopefully soon. ",5,2016,04,03
203,Wonderful restful luxurious stay.,"Staying in the Westbury is a great treat. It's welcoming staff makes one feel so special & nothing is too much touble. They communicate with you in a happy, relaxed, honouring way. They are  wonderful. The location is superb and the valet parking takes all stress & strain away. Magnificent.",5,2016,04,03
203,Like the song........Simply The Best..........better than all the rest........<3,"From the moment we walked through the doors of the lovely, stunning, exceptional, Westbury Hotel in Dublin, we knew we had hit the jackpot, because my 2 kids (20yrs & 24yrs))didn't complain,!!!!they were seriously impressed(& we have stayed in great places-4/5 stars around the world & they just loved this place. Every single member of staff were wonderfully attentive from the door men to the managers, Irish eyes-& others-were always smiling, no request was too trivial to attend to, they always had time to stop & chat which is rare in these times!! Everywhere was spotless, endless mirrors in the bathroom(never knew I had that bump there!!!) endless toiletries , sparkling white fluffy towels, Cosy, comfortable, spacious, quiet beds/bedrooms, adored the morning papers delivered to the door & souvenirs of Easter 1919 celebrations-impressive colour schemes down the wide corridors, amazing food especially at breakfast(put on 2kgs-ugh!!) lunch & dinner !!! Everyone was very sensitive on hearing about the death of my brother whose funeral was on holy Thursday & spoilt us rotten. The list goes on & I could write a book on how happy the whole family were to stay in that fantastic hotel. A million thanks to everyone!!!  ",5,2016,04,03
203,Fabulous ,"Amazing hotel. Brilliant rooms and great service. Breakfast wonderful. Great location in heart of Dublin. Luxurious. Only slight gripe tea could have been hotter at breakfast but selection of breads, local cheese and jam more than made up. ",5,2016,04,02
203,Great Location,"Had a relaxing two day break - just what we needed after our travels around Europe.  Service was great and room was very comfortable.  Hotel is quite expensive but great central location.
We would stay again.",4,2016,04,02
203,Just OK.,"The staff at the hotel were all excellent, very friendly and helpful. The food was nice , the public areas were lovely. Unfortunately the luxury suite (number 527) just didn't feel very special. The size of the suite was perfect but it was quite run down, the door between the living area and bedroom was hanging off it's hinges, the room in general just looked very tired. For the price we paid we were expecting luxury and unfortunately were left feeling disappointed.",3,2016,04,01
203,Just Ok,"Not bad. Staff are so welcoming. But from someone who wanted to treat themselves I didn't feel very satisfied. There is no wow factor. Just felt like any other hotel to be honest. Not worth the money I'm afraid. 
There was food on one of the seats when we arrived to our room but it didn't dawn on us to complain as it's so little an issue but in hindsight these things should be highlighted when you're paying through the nose for your room! 
Also the shower ran hot and cold. We only discovered this the morning of check out after a one night stay so we didn't bother mentioning it. 
Not what you'd expect from a 5 star hotel at all. ",3,2016,03,30
203,Amazing ,Booked afternoon tea here  and wow what a fantastic 3 hours we had . The service was the best I've ever had . The afternoon tea was plentiful and delicious . The gallery was an absolute stunning room . The bar area was fantastic. Whenever I'm back in Dublin I wouldn't hesitate to return here . ,5,2016,03,30
203,Average,"The word is indexes average! Would be a good 4 start hotel hotel but they havent mastered the 5th star yet. Reception lady greeted me on arrival but i could see her bare feet on the other side of the desk! When i joked about this she said they are strongly advised to wear heals for work all day (ouch!) pool and gym are the night disappoinyment ever! When i complaints about this, they said Its called a fitness room, not a gym, to ser expectations! 5 star? Pool is inexistent, they tell you to use the gym across the street. The rooms are warm and tired, dont get fooled by the lovely pictures taken 10 years ago!
My advice? The merion or the shelbourne",2,2016,03,30
203,Third visit.,"My third visit in 8 months and again I'm more than happy with the standard and excellence of this Hotel.
Helpful staff, and the best location in Dublin make this the best place to stay.
The room was perfect and the check in was a pleasure. Hope to return again.
",5,2016,03,29
203,Almost Excellent !,"I loved this hotel, its location, friendly staff, superb lounges, restaurant and bar.
The only item stopping me giving an excellent revue was the relatively minor problems we encountered with the safe and the coffee machine in our room, neither of which worked despite staff being informed.",4,2016,03,29
203,Luxury stay,"We recently stayed here on Saturday 26th March. Myself, husband and our daughter. The atmosphere in the hotel from the moment you arrive is 5 star.   The hotel is in a great location. Staff are so helpful and friendly.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Dublin. Our room was lovely and spacious our daughter was delighted with her milk and cookies in the evening.  The breakfast the next morning was lovely. Overall a lovely relaxing stay only complaint was it wasn't long enough... ",5,2016,03,29
203,Westbury Hotel,"We stayed at the Westbury over the Easter weekend, it was the perfect location, close to all the events that were taking place.  Staff were excellent , friendly and very efficient.  Breakfast was excellent. Well done to everyone who works there.",5,2016,03,29
203,Always very pleasant,"Visiting The Westbury is always a lovely experience. We stayed twice recently and both times found the rooms to be very comfortable and the staff very friendly. Magdalena on reception checked us on on both recent occasions and was lovely. Offering bottles of water on check-in is also a very nice touch. 
The public areas are very well maintained and the hotel looks great. We had dinner one night in Balfes and found the food to be great quality and the staff were also great.
Dublin has it's fair share of nice hotels, but for me the Westbury just has a certain vibe and atmosphere that is so welcoming and relaxing that makes it my favourite. The location is also great - right in the middle of town. I will keep staying at the Westbury any time I can when I am in Dublin and happily recommend it to anybody else.",5,2016,03,28
203,5 star treatment,Can not fault this hotel in any way.  From the moment you walk through the door you get the 5 star treatment.  Hotel's location is excellent... Dublin on your doorstep.  The staff are very professional and friendly.  Rooms are beautiful.  Would highly recommend staying here.  Will be back!,5,2016,03,28
203,"Amazing Hotel, Location and Staff","Every aspect of the hotel was amazing.  As we arrived late the security agent greeted us and checked in with us every day to ensure we were having a good time.  The front desk staff and concierge helped us plan all of our activities quickly and efficiently, even on Easter weekend when the whole city was packed.  The door staff were knowledgeable and friendly.  The location was perfect, right on Grafton Street.  Afternoon tea was delightful.  And the rooms were luxuriously appointed and well maintained.",5,2016,03,28
203,Lovely Hotel in great location ,"Stayed here for 3 nights over Easter weekend and had a great time. 

Really friendly staff, room was a nice size (bathroom ok - a bigger bath would have been good). Bed was really comfy, turned down every night with chocs on the pillows.

Best thing about the stay was the afternoon tea which we enjoyed on two of our 3 days here. Really lovely atmosphere and service, great Nutella hot Choc and lovely fresh food. 

Basically a good hotel, right in the middle of town, close to shops and only a short walk to Temple Bar which was made extra special thanks to some really nice friendly staff.
",4,2016,03,28
203,"Central location, nice but small rooms","The hotel is very central within easy walking distance of a lot of sights. It was a bit difficult to find in the car. The hotel has kept a lot of its charm however our room was quite small which would probably be ok for one person but was a bit tricky with two people and two suitcases. The gym isn't worth writing home about, quite disappointing for such a large hotel. It felt like (and quite possibly was) a previous bedroom not used as a gym. Very limited machines and equipment that could do with an upgrade. Parking is available however be aware that this costs 25euro a night (something we weren't informed of until asked to pay on check out).",3,2016,03,27
203,Great hotel,"Ive stayed in the Westbury twice, great hotel. Staff are very friendly and the whole experience is very special. I would definitely recommend however make sure not to book a room on the side of the building facing a bar as it can be extremely loud and i did not get much sleep. I told staff the next morning and they were very kind and  gave me a free breakfast as a apology. I will definitely be returning!",4,2016,03,27
203,Highly recommended... ,"Lovely hotel. Had an issue with original allocated room, I then replied to a welcome email I received with my concerns and within 20 mins I'd had a tel call and my concerns dealt with and when we went to pay for afternoon tea on the Sunday it had already been taken care of as a good will gesture! Excellent customer service all around.",5,2016,03,26
203,The only way to experience Dublin Life in Luxurious Surroundings with Doyle Collection,"From the moment I arrived I was welcomed with a hearty Dublin reception. The door staff were professional & efficient. On arrival at reception (whilst I was only dropping off my car and luggage) as I was a few hours early were proactive in ensuring I received the Doyle Collection welcome. Dining in the Gallery and in the bar (who service the best apple martini) was prompt. I was disappointed that I missed breakfast at Wildes restaurant due to work commitments. My room was spacious, airy with lots of reading material and two table top books I fell in love with Lanvin and McQueen perfect for a fashionista like me. In my opinion the Westbury has and always will be the artery of hospitality in Dublin intertwined with the trademark that is synonymous with this independent group - Professionalism, Tradition and Luxury. You haven't experienced true Dublin hospitality unless you step inside this establishment whether that is to dine in Balfes, Wildes ( who serve an energy packed breakfast partnering with BodyByrne ) The Gallery or their relaxing Marble Bar. Thank you Mr OGorman and the team - this certainly is the heart of Dublin life for me since I first stepped through the doors in 1995 as a student new to Dublin for my birthday (Afternoon Tea)",5,2016,03,26
203,Exception Hotel,"Excellent Hotel, very friendly and attentive hotel, second to none. Would highly recommend a stay at the Westbury. It is located in the center of Dublin and everything is on hand just outside the front door.",5,2016,03,24
203,Proper Hotel,"Great weekend for anniversary made in part from the people, service and comfort of the Westbury. Completely central, surrounded by shops and shopping centres, 15min easy walk to the Temple Bar area or things like the Book of Kells in Trinity College. Very helpful and pleasant staff and people, you're guaranteed a craic or a life story. Balfe restaurant and bar has good food, pleasant surroundings. Recommend the afternoon tea in the hotel, it's a hot spot for locals and tourists alike. There are multiple eating places within a few minutes walk, we tried the Thai, Saba, just around the corner among others.  The room we had was not massive but not small either and more than adequate as hotel rooms go and had all the features and comforts you‚Äôd want. Some things can be expensive but we splashed out for special occasion.
The Westbury doesn‚Äôt skip on customer services or attention to detail - it‚Äôs a proper hotel. Recommended.",5,2016,03,23
203,Work to be done,"Well, staff was excellent and very friendly, concierge was extremely helpful, good choice of food for breakfast. 
Room was very specious.
Location is that you can not be more central to the center of the city.
For my opinion there are some issues; furniture is dated, worn out and needing some refurbishment. Hotel is stuck in 80's with carpets in corridors and rooms. When we arrive in room there was a dump smell inside (probably because of carpet washing). Toilet bowl tilted, water pipes exposed, repairs done poorly so it can be seen easily. 
This can not be 5 star hotel, because only staff works on that level",3,2016,03,22
203,beautiful hotel and facilities,"Stayed for the first time when there was a rugby international on and the Scottish team were staying. You would not have know it, the service in the bar, restaurant and for breakfast was excellent. Not forgetting the reception for check in/out and the valet parking. The rooms were spacious and the turn down service at night excellent with all used towels replaced etc. Our only niggle was that on both mornings our cooked breakfast was cold and had to be replaced. This was done extremely efficiently but whereas I could have accepted once as an oversight twice in a row was very poor.",5,2016,03,22
203,Exceptional staff.  Beautiful hotel.  Perfect location.,"From the moment we arrived, staff was anticipating our needs and available to assist.  Everyone was welcoming and accommodating.  We were able to exchange money at the front desk during check-in.  Our bags were promptly delivered to the room and the gentleman reviewed the features of the room, so we could settle in easily.  Our room was clean and quiet and the beds were very comfortable.  We enjoyed the nightly turn down service.

We had dessert the first night at Balfes.  The manager was attentive and friendly.  The following night, he extended us a warm welcome when we decided to have a late dinner at Balfes.  We were impressed that he remembered us, as well as our dessert order from the previous night.

I was working while on vacation (yes, I know) and had no issues with the wifi in the hotel.  I was able to quickly log on and had a strong signal.  I utilized the business center the day of our departure to print out boarding passes.  The business center is easily accessible and user friendly with Apple computers and Canon printers.

The hotel is perfectly located for walking to restaurants (including Starbucks for those of you with a similar daily habit), shopping, and attractions (ie Trinity College for the Book of Kells, museums).  We only used a taxi for the transfers to/from the airport.  The valet staff quickly ordered a taxi for us upon our departure and we waited no more than 3 minutes for it to arrive, during which one of the valets stood with us and graciously engaged in conversation.

The Westbury Hotel in Dublin was the middle stop, in between London and Edinburgh, during a 10 day birthday trip for my Mom's 82nd birthday.  She was very comfortable, felt catered to and spoiled, which is exactly what I wanted for her.  I am looking forward to returning to Ireland soon and will definitely stay at The Westbury.",5,2016,03,22
203,Great location,"I love staying at The Westbury when in Dublin. Firstly the location is very central, access to shops and restaurants near by. The rooms are nicely decorated and the beds are comfortable. The staff are very good, the bar has great cocktails.

Although it is pricey, it is worth it.",5,2016,03,21
203,3 star hotel masquerading as a 5 star,"This hotel is beautiful to look at and the location is ideal. Unfortunately the walls are paper thin you can hear the people in the next room cough. The toilet takes about 15 minutes to flush and sounds like the shower is running. It is very noisey. When you turn the TV there is a speaker in the bathroom that also kicks in and starts blaring what's on the TV.¬† When I called down to learn how to turn it off I was told that there was no way too. That if it bothered me to shut the bathroom door. 

We requested two wake up calls one at 530 and one at 545 as well as a cab to the airport that accepted credit cards. I never received either wake up calls, called down to make sure the cab was there in the morning as we were now in a major rush. We almost missed our flight, the cab didn't accept credit cards. As I am trying to get checked into our flight my husband is running around looking for a bank machine.....not really the service you would expect when paying $650 a night for a room!!!!!!

Would definitely not recommended this hotel.",2,2016,03,21
203,Wonderful Westbury,"Just got back from 6 nights at the Westbury. Wonderful hotel Everything was 5 star as you would expect from a 5 star hotel and without doubt the best hotel in Ireland, never mind Dublin   Nothing was too much trouble Breakfast was included and first class. We had champagne afternoon tea on the second day and because we were attending four concerts on four nights we took advantage of room service meals which was also excellent. We will be back ",5,2016,03,19
203,"Nice hotel, good location","Stayed for 2 nights in March. The hotel is as you would expect of a establishment with this rating. We were in a rush to check-in so skipped the niceties of hot towels etc. Found the service a bit hit and miss, on the one hand reception were very accommodating of an odd request to freeze an ice pack for my partners back, however when we called reception as we found we had some missing toiletries we were surprised to find they couldn't help (asked for a comb) not too much to ask for really...?",3,2016,03,19
203,SMALL BATHROOMS/DATED ROOMS,"Hopefully this review can help others 
Recently stayed at the westbury hotel with my boyfriend. the location is fantastic if you like to walk to your destinations this is the place to be. great restaurants all over the place as well as shopping malls. the hotel lobby was gorgeous however if you are staying in their standard rooms  do not expect much the bathrooms were extremely small in my opinion. We have traveled to many other places in Europe in this has been by far the smallest bathroom. The rooms were ok the seats were stained but on a good note it was EXTREAMLY CLEAN!!! (LOVED THAT) i do prefer a clean place than a small bathroom anyway but its good to have both. Good job to the cleaning crew!

The rooms are the only down fall at this Hotel.

I would like to acknowledge Flavio (Bar guy) he was impeccable very professional yet making us feel very welcomed i had the privilege to drink his own creation called Ipanema drink (AMAZING!! BEST DRINK EVER) 
 
The employees were all amazing great job guys! The guys on the front entrance were also very helpful unfortunately i didn't get their name!",4,2016,03,17
203,"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!!!!!","What a treat to stay right in the hub of activity off Grafton Street. This hotel is in the perfect location, has professional and personable staff and lovely rooms.  The lobby is spectacular and always bustling with visitors, locals and business people alike.  We did not, regrettably, do high tea but it looked wonderful and was full every afternoon.  We had breakfast included which was fabulous and very convenient for those mornings we took tours and left down the street VERY early. We could pop in and take a quick breakfast with us.  The staff was exceptional but I MUST give a big shout out to John at the concerige desk.  He is phenomenal !!!!!! He was so accommodating, helpful, professional funny and witty!! As John is who we dealt with a majority of the time ALL of the staff at the Westbury are fabulous. Our front facing room was lovely but the bathroom is a bit small. I highly recommend this fabulous hotel and hope I am able to return in the future, thank you Westbury!!",5,2016,03,17
203,Afternoon tea delights,If you are celebrating something special or just want a break from shopping afternoon tea at the Westbury is a must.  From the time you get there until you leave it is an experience.  Dietary needs are catered for and the range of teas and coffees is excellent.  To add a little something Mo√´t can be sipped (not included in the price of afternoon tea but very reasonable). The staff were very welcoming and were on hand to make for a very pleasant visit. Finally the ambience and decor enhanced the experience. Highly recommend.,5,2016,03,17
203,Great Hotel,A true Five Star  nicely located in the Heart of Dublin. Hotel staff extremely competent and friendly. The Hotel is luxurious and offers all you can need at a reasonable price. Rooms are large and clean. Most of the Dublin attractions can be easily reached by walk.,5,2016,03,17
203,Over priced and average,"Hotel was in good central location, however for price the price found the room basic, i was very unimpressed with the cleaner entering our room at 10am to tidy after our departure even though check out wasn't to 12. ",3,2016,03,16
203,Large luxury hotel in great location,"This large hotel is situated in a prime location in downtown Dublin.  It has very large public areas and offers a number of in-house dining options.  The staff, for the most part, is very responsive and helpful.  I docked the hotel ""one dot"" for inconsistent service -- an offered bed turn down scheduled for 7 pm one night wasn't attempted until after 8; another wasn't even offered until after 9.  By the third night, we were ignored altogether.  The first morning we were woken by a maintenance worker who wanted to unclog a sink (wrong room).  Reaching the front desk by phone, too, was sometimes a challenge -- waiting over 10 rings in the evening is not ideal. The deluxe room was spacious enough, just a little frayed around the edges (literally) -- carpet by the door was lose, a desk lamp never worked.  But the wifi was strong, breakfasts were good, and ""nightcap"" offerings were tasty.  Overall, a very good experience, just not a great one.",4,2016,03,15
203,The only hotel to stay at in Dublin,"A hotel with excellent standards, very good breakfast, charming staff and a great position in the centre of Dublin. We wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in Dublin on our rather infrequent visits. The little special touches that welcome us back are much appreciated.",5,2016,03,15
203,Never disappoints ,"Great service levels at this hotel , the staff are friendly and efficient , from check in with Patrick through to housekeeping , and maintenance who fixed our safe within 10 minutes when we were about to go out for the day .

The food at the hotel is good lots of local produce - breakfast in Wilde was great , dinner in Balfes was excellent and Sean went out of his way to get our ""free drinks"" from the bar upstairs brought to our table in the restaurant .
Nothing is too much trouble here , customer service levels are top notch .
I've stayed before and I will be back .",5,2016,03,15
203,Very Nice place to stay,"Hotel staff is very cheerful & helping, location in middle of city all the things at your disposal, Food was very tasty and service was very quick, you can move around and see the Best of Dublin, Cheers to Stay",4,2016,03,14
203,Wonderfully relaxing venue,"This hotel is just wonderful: Situated in the very centre of Dublin, the rooms are very well equipped, quiet and perfect for spending a relaxing night. Breakfast is delicious and the staff is more than very attentive! I would go there even for a family trip!",5,2016,03,13
203,Beautiful & Clean Property,"We stayed as a couple only a few weeks before Christmas and already the hotel was beautifully decorated for the season.  We arrived very late at night and found the staff to be most welcoming as they attentively and efficiently checked us in to our comfortable, spacious, clean, and lovely room.  We had stayed at a sister-property in London that was not up to TA reviews and while that visit came as a huge disappointment and shock, we were admittedly a bit concerned as to what the stay at the Westbury might bring.  You can only imagine our relief!  
Our rate for the king room included daily breakfast in the newly refurbished restaurant, which isn't only trendy, but serves up an assortment of buffet pastries (which my husband enjoyed) while one peruses the menu.  I was unwell and only took breakfast for one of our three mornings there and while I didn't eat much of the pancakes with fresh berries, but will say that it was delicious and ""freshly made"" with care.  We also felt that our server was most professional.  If I frequented the area or lived there, this is a restaurant I would love to make a regular breakfast place.  Do try it! 
The hotel itself is situated in the heart of everything--Grafton Street, with St. Stephen's Green, Trinity College, River Lifey, Temple Bar, and much more--all right there or within easy walking distance.  We had no need for any type of public or ground transportation, with the exception of to/from the airport.  The people of Dublin are incredibly friendly and we found the city to be safe, clean, and easy by foot whether day or night.  It's a beautiful city and returning to our comfortable room at the Westbury each night made it that much better.   
Unfortunately I didn't think ahead to reserve afternoon tea, though it did look lovely and next time I will remember to think ahead.  When in Dublin again, we will stay at the Westbury once more.",5,2016,03,13
203,Five star luxury,"We stayed at this hotel for four nights . It's situated just off Grafton Street in the heart of the shopping centre . The hotel is wonderful and the rooms are decorated in muted colours with great bathrooms and top of the range toiletries . There is a turn down service where the beds are re made ready for you to have a great nights sleep . Bottled water is placed on the bedside cabinets and we had the use of a Krups Nespesso machine with a variety of coffee pods .
Staff are welcoming and polite . We landed at 8am and arrived very early but to our surprise the room had been made available and we were all settled in and unpacked ready to explore Dublin . 
",5,2016,03,12
203,Luxury and great location,"We stayed in a deluxe room and it was lovely, big, beautiful furnishings, clean and very comfortable. The location suited us perfectly, 5 minute walk to Temple Bar, surrounded by shops and restaurants.  The concierge made our restaurant reservation before we arrived and the recommendations were excellent.  We did not eat in the hotel at all but the bar staff were very welcoming when we had a drink.  The bed was very comfortable, the only 2 things to improve are the TV quality and the slow draining of the water in the shower.  The quality of the staff was impressive, all very helpful and polite.  We would stay here again and seek out hotels in the same group. We weren't looking for value, we were looking for luxury and we got it.",5,2016,03,12
203,Dublin City Centre Break,"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of The Westbury for their care and attention during my recent stay.  My mum broke her ankle on the first night of our visit, Mother's Day, and the hotel provided a complimentary wheelchair, which allowed her to  continue with all of her plans.  Joseph Downing, the Guest Services Manager, Ashley and Rachel on reception went out of their way to be accommodating, were always on hand to help with our plans, arranging for a doctor to attend my mum and even a personal shopping experience with the local department stores! 

Due to my mum's restricted circumstances we spent more time at the hotel than we had originally planned and enjoyed every minute of it, from Breakfast in Wilde's, Afternoon Tea in the Gallery and dinner in Balfes and the Marble Bar.  The food was all delicious, the staff were attentive and helpful and we would highly recommend the Vamos cocktail!

Thank you again to the staff for making what could have been a stressful few days go much more smoothly.",5,2016,03,11
203,Great location,"My wife and i have stayed at the Westbury a few times now. Never had any problems, rooms are nice, breakfast options very good and staff are very helpful. 
Had some nice lunches too, oysters & chilled sauvignon, great!
Ideal for shopping and surrounded by lots of bars and restaurants, its just a great location.",5,2016,03,10
203,Lovely Night in Dublin,"This hotel is simply beautiful. The staff were more than accommodation,friendly and helpful from the lovely doormen to the cleaning staff. I booked this hotel before an important meeting and informed the reception desk of this so they placed me in the quietest part of the hotel. I had also sent an enquiry before about parking and they replied to me very promptly. I had a wonderful nights sleep-the bedding was lovely and incredibly comfortable. It was the cleanest hotel I've stayed in for a long time. The facilities in the room were great-lovely TV,good selection of channels ,nespresso machine in room with pods and lovely mini-bar if you want to indulge-everything you could need was supplied. Due to being caught for time I didn't get to dine in the hotel but I'll definitely be back to enjoy that pleasure.",5,2016,03,08
203,Fantastic Hotel,The hotel provided a wonderful experience.  The room was lovely and the staff was friendly and helpful.  I enjoyed breakfast in the restaurant almost every morning and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.,5,2016,03,07
203,Another great visit,"Took my Dad here for his 80th Birthday. Have visited here many times as it is one of the best hotels in Dublin. The rooms are excellent, the staff are really helpful and friendly. Tried out the afternoon tea sat by the fire. As the Hotel found out he was 80, they put some cakes in his room with Happy 80th on it. The staff for afternoon tea brought him a cake with 80th on it and even the barman got him a cheesecake and fruit. Great staff, great venue. The one to stay in.",5,2016,03,06
203,Lovely hotel center of Dublin - went for Biz but would return for pleasure!,"Lovely neighborhood and on a sleepy/late Tuesday evening, the concierge had a restaurant keep kitchen open for us.  HE also walked me to a nearby ATM to get Euros out for cabbie..great service and so friendly.  I was upgrade to a suite which was huge and so comfortable.  The claw-footed tub was amazing.  thanks for making a tri-city EU biz trip relaxing and delicious!",5,2016,03,04
203,Westbury exceeded my expetations,"I only stayed at Westbury for 1 night, but I will certainly make a reservation at this hotel next time I am in Dublin as well. Very friendly, helpful and proactive staff, nice rooms and a very nice lunge area. I did not get the chance to use the other facilities, hope to do that next time.",5,2016,03,03
203,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent hotel, great location and superb service.  Only downside is small gym, but even with the small gym, I would go back there in a heart beat.  Room service was phenomenal and location, location! its right off Grafton street so its close to everything.  ",5,2016,03,02
203,staff service,Great location ...above all great service: My husband lost a sentimental hat at a nearby restaurant and concierge/ bellman Eddy actually went to the restaurant personally to retrieve the hat and valiantly tried to refuse the tip!!! That is amazing in this day and age. Can't say enough about the service..... top notch!,5,2016,03,02
203,Superb city stay,"I know i couldn't have picked a better place to stay for my short city break.  Superb in every way, staff, room, facilities, food, comfort, location, accessibility..  A wonderful stay!  I am already planning my next trip..",5,2016,03,02
203,Our Stay at Westbury,"We stayed at the Westbury for 5 nights this February.  It is a beautiful hotel!  The concierge staff was beyond helpful when our luggage was lost.  He took care of checking on it for us so we didn't have to keep calling.  The staff greeted everyone in a friendly way, and the hotel was very clean.  Our room was nice, we were only able to get two twin beds for our stay though.  I was there with my mother so two full beds would have been nicer and more comfortable especially for her.  All in all though, it was a great experience. Great location right off of Grafton St. right where all the great shopping, restaurants, and pubs are. ",4,2016,03,01
203,"Great location, delicious breakfast, reasonable rooms","We enjoyed our brief weekend stay at The Westbury. It certainly feels like a luxury hotel, from the service right through to the facilities.

The location can't be beaten - right off Grafton Street for shopping, and within easy access of all that Dublin has to offer.

We were slightly underwhelmed with our room - small, on a lower floor and with a view of a wall outside our window - but it was clean and well maintained. 

We enjoyed a number of cocktails at Balfes bar at the bottom of the hotel. Service and quality could not be faulted.

Breakfast was delicious, with a selection of high-quality produce, which we thoroughly enjoyed.

Overall, The Westbury is definitely a good choice in Dublin and full of the Irish charm that one would hope to find.",4,2016,03,01
203,Top location and great service,"I returned last night from a one night stay at the Westbury with three friends, and we all had nothing but good things to say about the hotel. We booked two double rooms and were on an early flight, so had requested an early check-in in advance. The rooms weren't ready when we arrived, but the staff took our contact details and during a lovely brunch down the road from the hotel, we were pleasantly surprised that both rooms were available quite some time before the stated check-in time, which was a huge help and greatly appreciated.

The service was brilliant all round, everyone from the front desk, concierge to the housekeeping staff went out of their way to be as helpful and friendly as possible. We had breakfast the next day at the Balfes brasserie and experienced yet more wonderful service and great food. 

The location was absolutely brilliant, very central and close to lots of shops, caf√©s, bars and restaurants; and just close enough (but not too close) to the Temple Bar area. The rooms were as you would expect for a hotel of this standard, but I must give a special mention to the beds/mattresses which were so so comfortable. The wifi was also really good.

All in all this was a great hotel, a stretch compared to our usual budget but worth it for a weekend treat.",5,2016,02,29
203,A little let down - more 4 star than 5!,"Stayed here with a  group of friends at the weekend - we were so excited - while our rooms were fab with expresso machine in each room - I was amazed that we had to climb into a bath to have a shower - 5*??
Breakfast the next morning - the restaurant was full so we were seated in an open area (where they normally serve afternoon tea) this wasnt a great experience - we had to keep asking for everything - cutlery, warm toast, warm tea - the breakfast room where continental buffet was - was all a bit messy - nobody managing it and people approacing buffet from all sides - no signage to direct
All in all I would feel that the sister hotel of the Westbury - The River Lee in Cork while a 4 start offers much more in the way of 5 star service - The Westbury - Over promise and under delivered - The River Lee - under promise and over deliver!",3,2016,02,29
203,2 day stop over in Dublin,"I chose the Westbury due to its location and it was the right choice. It is very close weather you just want to stay around Grafton Street, St. Stephens Green, but it is only a short walk to Temple Bar, O' Connell Street. In fact anywhere within reason. The hotel it self is very good and the staff are outstanding. Great Irish breakfast. I would recommend that you chose a quite room. I found everything great even the business center ",5,2016,02,29
203,Excellent Service,"The service in the Westbury was excellent before. It has however reached an even higher standard over the past year.  From the moment we arrived in our car, all the staff were exceptional. Variety at breakfast seems to have declined slightly.",5,2016,02,28
203,Mini Break,"I recently stayed at this hotel with my sister. We decided to book a mini break Wednesday-Saturday. The hotel has a very central location and you are able to get to all sites around the city easily without having too much noise from the streets in the evening or too long a walk. You are a 10/15 minute walk from Temple Bar and central shopping area. After looking through many hotels and seeing lots of them there this is definitely the best if you wish to be central. We booked using booking.com who has the best available price at ¬£479 for our 3 nights. Stated you had to pay on arrival. Simple we thought. When checking in at the desk the staff member took the information and stated it was ¬£500 (in sterling) which was ¬£21 more than was stated on our booking. We asked why this was the case and no explanation could be given. I'm not sure if this is down to bookings.com not including the exchange rate or not but just be careful on that one. However, I would not hesitate in staying in this hotel again.",4,2016,02,27
203,Excellent,"A very nice hotel in the center of the city. Nice atmosphere, friendly people. Delicious breakfast and a wonderful lobby. The room was comfortable, nice. The persons in the reception have excellent ideas for dinnin",5,2016,02,26
203,Wonderful location,"Gorgeous hotel, wonderful staff and a great location right in the heart of Grafton Street.  Rooms are delightful, spacious and with wonderful comfortable beds!  Afternoon tea overlooking Grafton Street is delightful",5,2016,02,24
203,Just wonderful,"Have absolutely loved my stay here on a business trip.  The service quality is rarely found these days, food was fantastic, great facilities for business meetings but also just a lovely place to stay.  My room was a little noisy (party animals in the streets ;) )at the weekend but that's the same in any city centre hotel and probably some earplugs would have done the trick.  Would definitely return here next time I come to Ireland. ",5,2016,02,24
203,Never disappoints!,"I continue to love this place.  Right in the city center on Grafton Street, effortless luxury - not pretentious, just comfortable.  Only thing I discovered this time is that room 600 is a bit squished up on one of the higher floors next to what appear to be the very large rooms - so it is in a bit of a corner - not quite as lovely as the others I have had!",5,2016,02,24
203,First trip to Dublin,"Well what a lovely hotel with equally lovely staff. 

From the moment we rocked up at the doorway we were made to feel very special. We had gone on a birthday night out and it started with an early arrival to the hotel. They had rang us prior to I guess confirm our arrival and what time we expected to land. At this point they told us we would have the first available room, and guess what, we arrived before the check in time and was shown directly to our room (no waiting for the room to be available.) 

So on arrival, a very polite man took our case and walked us to the check in desk. A quick register process and we was off to our room. The room was great. It wasn't the largest room I've stayed in but it was plenty big enough. It had a large bed, two easy chairs and a coffee table, a writing desk with all stationary, a nice sized tele and all the bits n pieces you need. There was a mini bar that wasn't excessively expensive and a kettle with coffee etc. To my partners delight there was a hair dryer in the room. The bathroom was lovely with a large bath and a large basin inset into a large top spanning the depth of the batroom. There was also lots of goodies set out including a really nice soap. 

On top of this there was a couple of pairs of complimentary slippers and fluffy dressing gowns.

The view was above the roof tops so a reasonable view across the city.

The location was maybe a 5 - 10 minute walk from the Temple Bar area.

All in all a great night out.

Acid test would I stop here again..........hell yeah. Well done The Westbury!!!",5,2016,02,23
203,"The Winsome, Wonderful, Winning Hotel","I concur with all the glowing 5 star reviews of this hotel so I will add to those. The moment we entered which was last Saturday we felt the ambience and  the good will. This permeated throughout the hotel. All the staff were the essence of warm-heartedness and kindness particularly those in reception, dining room and those who minded our luggage. What really stood out was their innate, instinctive capacity to be pleasant and personable. They didn't need training, upskilling or courses in the art of virtuosity. It was a  natural to all of them and it was nice to see it and feel its value. 
Breakfast was simply the best ever... the choices were supreme; the healthy options couldn't have been better. I enjoyed their chia seed pudding, fruit compotes, wholemeal breads, all kinds of fruit salads, nuts, seeds, porridge. My husband would love to know the origin of the rasher, sausage and pudding... the taste was of purity with no salt or additives. Definitely no cheap mass produced stuff here. He savoured the banana bread, seed cake and chocolate loaf. We did not eat a meal until next day -such was the contentment in our stomachs!  What more can I say? It was simply magnificent from every sphere so a thousand thanks to you all and certainly we will be with you again...",5,2016,02,22
203,Excellence as Standard,"Having just returned from a long weekend in Dublin, staying in The Westbury, I reflect on how much the friendly, accommodating team made our weekend. The relaxed, yet utterly professional way each and every member of staff go out of their way to provide exemplary service is refreshing and leaves you wondering why all other hotels cannot do the same. Well Done Westbury Team from Sue & Kev (Shropshire)",5,2016,02,22
203,Very expensive,We stayed for 3 nights our room had a dirty chair in it room our room was nicely presented the first day we arrive but deteriorated as the days went on we dined in the Wilde restaurant and food poor service over the top we ordered a bottol of water waiter mixed it up with a table nearby never got water would not go back over all to expensive.parking is crazy I would say a rip of the 3 nights cost me 1500 euros ,3,2016,02,22
203,One Of The Best,"Great located city centre hotel with excellent ambience, service and food. Has to be one of the best city hotels I have enjoyed in over 30 years. Staff soo friendly and accommodating, it is they who make the grade soo high. Very much recommended and I will definitely return. ",5,2016,02,21
203,Business ,"Stayed this week in the Westbury hotel Dublin. Check in was very good , permitted early check in which was handy as our group had been traveling from Manchester early. On Arrival the staff will help with anything.  Our group got coffee / tea while check in was completed. 

Rooms nicely decorated 

Mini bar / kettle / coffee pod machine 

Tv : you can hook in HDMI from laptop if required or USB for any hard drive 

Resturant & Bar : staff very polite 

Lobby area excellent for relaxing or having a chat with business 

Breakfast : opt in for full resturant 

Best breakfast service and staff are always there to hand 

Location : city centre / 5 mins away from St Stephen's Green    

We will return again ",5,2016,02,21
203,Superb hotel very central,"Warm welcome on arrival. Great room and nothing was too much trouble for the team. Centrally located so ideal for all sightseeing, couple of local pubs just on the doorstep, did not visit these. Had food in the hotel restaurant, so refreshing to see a menu with interesting vegetarian dishes... Fish and meat were all local and could not fault. Breakfasts - nice buffet and extensive choice of cooked food, all arrived quickly and was piping hot... Highly recommend this excellent hotel... will be back",5,2016,02,20
203,Great place to stay,"There is everything to like about this hotel.  The location, service, food - it was all excellent.  We will definitely stay there again and will recommend it to our friends.  My only regret is we didn'tt have time to enjoy an afternoon tea well, maybe next time üòÄ",5,2016,02,20
203,Amazing attention to detail,Fabulous hotel. Can't fault it. Rooms were so beautiful (we had a four poster bed (chocolates and macaroons on arrival)) and the communal areas were buzzy and interesting. Staff couldn't do enough. Wonderful hotel. Loved it.,5,2016,02,19
203,An amazing experience,"We visited this hotel for St Valentines Day weekend, we had a wonderful meal in the Wilde Restaurant. The food was excellent and the attention to detail and manners and service from Josh (our waiter) was just fantastic and made us feel very special. The WIlde Restaurant Manager was als very attentive and made our evening even more special.

Rory Rooney the Front of House Manager was extremely efficient and ensured our every needs were satisfied  

I would strongly recommend the hotel to anybody who enjoys high quality affordable  service.",5,2016,02,19
203,Very noisy,"My husband and I stayed here on Wednesday 17th February. 

At 1.09am we were woken by two women arguing in the room next door. I called reception who sent security up promptly. They knocked on the door of the room next door and spoke with the arguing guests. However this made absolutely no difference to the noise. I rang back again and was told that security were on the corridor monitoring the situation. The loud noise and fighting continued for another 40 minutes until one of the women left the room. 

The major problem was that even though all rooms were not occupied, the hotel had allocated us to an adjoining room!!! This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. At ‚Ç¨255 room only for the night we expected much more than this. Surely these rooms should be for families only?

At 9.30am we were rudely awoken by the front desk to offer us a late check out until 2 pm. Quite a waste of time given that we were once again women out of our sleep!!! 
I ordered breakfast to our room. 40 minutes later, it hadn't arrived. I rang again. Our order had been forgotten and was sent up this time. 

Unfortunately we had forgotten our toothbrushes. We rang to request 2 complimentary disposable ones. 1 hour later, no sign. We called reception again and they arrived a few minutes later. 

Upon checking out, I asked the receptionist what was hotel policy for guests who had been woken by noise which was confirmed by security. She checked with the manager who said there was none. She said however that our car parking fee of ‚Ç¨25 was waived. I told her that it didn't matter as I would be writing a review on trip advisor to which she smiled and gave me her card to offer a room upgrade next time we stayed. This hotel leaves a lot to be desired. Although the price of food and drinks is very expensive, they were beautiful at all times. When you retire to your room however, the opulence of downstairs is merely a memory. The arguing and fighting from the room next door was horrid and very off putting. However, the customer service from putting us in an adjoining room in the first place to being shabby overall was the worst thing for us. Lots of smiles and chit chat from staff but that was where it ended.",2,2016,02,19
203,Fabulous Champagne Afternoon Tea,"We arrived a half hour early but there wasn't a problem we were seated straight away by a very polite girl. She explained the menu & options to us & then gave us time to decide. She ordered exactly what we wished for ,which was different to the menu due to our dietary requirements . A guy delivered our afternoon tea delights & went through what each treat was . Our tower of food was fabulous & very filling .We had beautiful fresh sandwich fingers , scones ( 2 plain & 2 fruit each) with jam & clotted cream & extremely tasty pastries on the top tier . The treats we didn't finish were placed in a 'doggy box' to take home. We spent around two and a half hours at the Gallery and felt relaxed but it had a lovely buzz about the place. It was very busy so book in advance so you won't be disappointed.",5,2016,02,18
203,why can't they all be like this .....,"There are only 2 hotels in Dublin which feel 5 star and this is one of them. Unlike the other one, residents aren't completely crowded out of the lounge area here by the 'afternoon tea ' crowd. It is slightly annoying when you can't find a seat but commercially, we guess, its understandable. That's the only tiny negative in an otherwise exemplary stay. 
Really wonderful staff make staying here a real pleasure - nothing is too much trouble and they make you feel like their most important guests. 
Since our last stay, new beds appear to gave been installed that have to be the most comfortable we've ever slept in.
Superb staff, great rooms, fantastic location ...why can't they all be like this?",5,2016,02,18
203,Excellent experience,"Stayed at the Westbury for one night. Check in and check out very quick - very polite and helpful staff. We got an early check in as we arrived in the morning - excellent as we had been travelling since 5:30 in the morning and it would have been terrible to wait until 3pm - their advertised check in time. Good and abundant breakfast, quiet and spacious room as requested. I can recommend it and would go back.",5,2016,02,18
203,50th birthday,"We stayed here to celebrate my 50th birthday. The hotel is in a great location close to lots of bars and restaurants.
The room was nice and the hotel is impressive. 
We had drinks at the marble bar and at Balfes. 
But we prefer to go to the more traditional Irish bars like sheehan's, which is just at the end of the street.
We will certainly consider returning sometime in the future. 
",5,2016,02,17
203,Pretty close to Five Stars - minor short comings,"The service was first rate at The Westbury.  I arrived early and was able to check into my room right away.  In fact, every staff member I encountered throughout my stay was eager to answer questions, provide assistance and send me whatever item I was in need of, from a sewing kit to extra coffee.  

While I was anticipating a larger room for a ""King"" room, I was comfortable (despite my disappointment) .  I was placed in a city view room - which I would recommend against.  The music from clubs goes on until 2:00am and can be heard clearly within the room.  

The bed was excellent for sleeping.  The mini shower was a bit unusual - the more I travel the more I realize Americans like big showers.  However the water pressure was great and the staff made sure all toiletries were well stocked.  The amply sized bathtub was fantastic for a soak.  There was no electrical outlet in the bathroom, which was odd - one has to dry their hair in the main room.  

The room could have used a few instructional cards:  It was a challenge to figure out how to use the coffee maker as well as the many light switches one encounters upon entering the room.  There were also some cosmetic issues that should be attended to: the desk in my room was worn and scraped up, and the outlets were also loose from the walls.      

Additionally, the restaurants within the hotel could use some customer service training.  I received slow and/or rude service in all but the Balfes.  The staff there were very friendly and accommodating, and the food was top notch!

Note:  The staff downplayed the gym at the hotel.  It contains all necessary equipment, but does only have just one piece each.  Check out the gym first before you go to the location next door...it is likely you will have the gym to yourself!",4,2016,02,17
203,Absolute luxury and outstanding service,"Myself and my partner stayed in the Westbury on Sunday 10th January and the experience was superb from start to finish. 

We arrived at the hotel 2 hours before the check-in time and were lucky as our room was ready and we could check-in early. A great start! The girl, Claudia, on the check-in desk was extremely helpful and we were given bottles of water and hot towels to freshen up, a nice touch. 

Our room was fabulous, we were in a suite on the 6th floor with a 4 poster bed. We had informed the hotel it was a special occasion and there were treats waiting for us in the room when we arrived. The facilities in the room were top class, a nespresso machine, free wi-fi and a TV in the bathroom! 

We went out for a meal in the city and came back to the Marble Bar for drinks. It is a lovely bar with a great atmosphere. When we got back to the room house keeping had been in to turn down the beds and much to our delight there were swans made of towels and rose petals on the bed, a touch of class! 

Breakfast was delicious the following morning with a great choice and we had a fantastic spot at the window. 

All in all we had a wonderful stay and would go back in a heartbeat. I want to try the afternoon tea next time! Every staff member we came in contact with (reception, housekeeping, bar staff, doormen) were really friendly and helpful, which makes a difference and gives this hotel an edge. I cannot recommend the Westbury enough.",5,2016,02,17
203,Beautiful central hotel,"Staff were so attentive from our arrival to our departure.Food was lovely,had a huge bed and air-conditioning.We also had a nespresso machine in the room.Very clean..Well worth the money..We will definitely be back",5,2016,02,17
203,"Friendly and helpful staff, good restaurant, very comfortable rooms...all centrally located.","We had a great welcome when we arrived and throughout staff didn't just wish you a ""great day"" but did that little bit extra to solve little problems, give advice about the city, or just have a bit of a chat. It's rare to find consistently  high standards in a biggish hotel like this.
Rooms are a good size with big comfy beds and well appointed bathrooms.
The restaurant is excellent. Good food, well cooked and good vegetarian options. The breakfast menu is equally good.
All this slap dab in the middle town.",5,2016,02,17
203,"Service excellent, rooms only ok","The Westbury Hotel couldn't be better located if you're after a prime central Dublin spot. Close to the shops and restaurants of Grafton Street and a relatively easy drive in a cab from Dublin Airport (the taxi driver thought the traffic was terrible - try London mate!) which costs ¬£25-30. The welcome at the hotel was excellent, the kind of standard you'd expect in a ""premier league"" five star hotel - professional, courteous, helpful. The room was small but pleasantly furnished, but fell down badly on the quality of the bathroom - shower pressure awful and wouldn't work at all if the room next door was using theirs, water either boiling hot or freezing, shower was over a bath with a fabric curtain past its sell by date etc etc. The bathroom overall was no better than a premier inn. Breakfast the next morning was great and served to order rather than an awful buffet. Overall, it was a 7/10 for me. Service, food and location let down by the room.",4,2016,02,17
203,A great place to stay in Dublin,"Pros:
--Great location!  The lobby, bar and rooms were all well appointed.
--Beds were very comfortable
--Continental buffet was varied, filling and delicious. 
--Staff was very accommodating.  For example, our waiter in the Hotel Bar helped us find a place for dinner and even researched for vegetarian options at the place he suggested.

Cons:
--Like many 5 star hotels, they have adopted using those multi-functional light switches which are just confusing to use.  It turns out to be a poor customer experience since who wants to spend their time figuring out which switch works with which light?

--There's no outlet to use the blow dryer in the bathroom.  You need to blow dry your hair in your bedroom in front of your desk.

--The shower was great...except it had one of those half-doors which is never quite enough and more water than not ends up on your floor.

--In my ""Pros"" section, I mentioned their great staff.  Well, we did encounter a rude German waitress when we got the breakfast buffet.  My friend asked her for the bill and she didn't understand her.  When she repeated her request, the waitress replied ""I didn't understand you.  You had food in your mouth"".  Did my friend have food in her mouth?  Probably.  However, if you choose to work in the hospitality industry, it means dealing with the public and being hospitable.  End of story.",4,2016,02,17
203,"Great hotel, but watch out for the room categories","We stayed for three nights over Valentines.  The hotel has an amazing location - central to everything we wanted (Grafton St, Trinity College, Buses from College Green, Tara St rail to Howth).  The staff are friendly and the lobby areas are large and comfortable.

Check in was fine and they made best efforts to accommodate our early arrival - there was a brief attempt at an upsell to a suite which I'm not a fan of.

We initially had a problem with the ""deluxe room"" we booked.  On arrival to 435 we found a Superior room (as described on the website), and not the deluxe room as t had none of the facilities as advertised on the website.  On complaining to the front desk we were told it was a Deluxe room because it was bigger.  This is false advertising and a cheap trick as its not just a room size that is different (furnishings, bigger tv etc).  This was resolved by a complimentary upgrade, and the front desk seemed very familiar with the complaint (only one wing of the hotel has the new deluxe rooms).  I'd rather have just had a smooth arrival with the room I'd paid for than an hour of lost time on a long weekend break.

The room we were given (Luxury Studio Suite) was great.  Quiet on the 6th floor and immaculately serviced by housekeeping (twice daily).  The Nespresso machine was a nice touch for an early morning coffee.

We had breakfast in the Wilde on Sunday morning.  It was very busy but the service was good and the buffet kept me nourished whilst waiting for the excellent Irish breakfast.  Orange juice from a carton rather than freshly squeezed though (I always see that as a 5* hotel marker).

We also had drinks in the Marble bar after dinner out one night which was a fun place to relax and digest.

Dublin has so much to offer and The Westbury puts you right in the heart of it; just make sure you get the room you booked.",4,2016,02,17
203,Life is for Living!,"Myself and a friend decided to catch up in the grandeur of the The Westbury Hotel yesterday and treat ourselves to some Afternoon Tea. (My friend required the gluten free option which they brought without batting an eyelid - believe me if this is what you need you wont be disappointed ! ) 

We had a glorious time . Starting with a cold glass of Moet , we then tucked into 3 tiers of the most delicious sandwiches and little pastries along with a pot of Darjeeling and a pot of Mint tea.

We were looked after at a polite distance by the very charming and professional staff who sent us home with some leftover pastries and complimentary chocolates all wrapped up in a lovely white Westbury cake box.

The hours just fell away in these luxurious surrounding and I am here this morning already wondering when I can get back!..

Thank you to you all!",5,2016,02,17
203,5* Brilliance - great place to stay and also socialise!,"From the time we landed at the front door, we were treated like royalty which is a really important first impression.  All staff from the bar lounge area, the concierge, Joseph, Vincent, Rory, Daizee et al are professional to their core. Attentive without smothering but you knew they were always nearby.  It was a great experience, brilliant location in the city centre within easy reach of shopping/dining/drinking venues!",5,2016,02,16
203,Disappointing,"Booked the Westbury hotel for our wedding anniversary. Central location and anticipation of high quality service for our short stay, were primary reasons for booking this particular hotel. We found the service to be lacking and had a few disappointing incidents which took from our time away. Have not given negative reviews in the past but this hotel was unsatisfactory and did not have the high standard of service you would expect from a 5 star. Would not visit again.",2,2016,02,16
203,Top Class Afternoon Tea,"Myself and my friend met for an indulgent Afternoon Tea today in The Westbury Hotel, just off Grafton Street in Dublin. The service was truly wonderful, attentive and friendly. The food was beautiful, really tasty sandwiches, scones and desserts and the presentation; china, cutlery etc was top class. 
The comfy sofas and armchairs in such plush surroundings made everything feel special.
We could have as much tea as we wanted and my friend's champagne came complete with a fresh strawberry in the glass. Brilliant selection of teas, coffee, hot chocolate and we couldn't eat everything so we were sent home with beautiful carry out containers full of the goodies we couldn't manage along with divine Lily O'Brien chocolates!  
A brilliant treat for catching up with the girls, can't wait for the next time!",5,2016,02,16
203,Lovely hotel Base to explore Dublin ,"The hotel is very nicely decorated, the bar lounge area is stunning, breakfast here is delicious and service impeccable. The only critique I have is although the rooms are very clean, modern and comfortable they're not very chic, the rest of the hotel is very chic and we'll designed so it would be nice to see that through to the rooms.",4,2016,02,16
203,5* excellence!,Had afternoon tea here with a close friend during the Valentines weekend.   Everything was excellent! Friendly and well groomed staff that knew exactly what they were talking about. Great ambience. Clean. Fresh and delicious food. Comfortable. Will recommend. ,5,2016,02,15
203,Afternoon Tea - Fab!,We went for Afternoon Tea at The Westbury over the weekend and we really enjoyed it. The food was delicious with lovely flavours in the sandwiches and pastries. The staff were courteous and friendly and the ambiance was great. Would recommend! ,5,2016,02,14
203,Classic & King?,"I'm not too sure what the difference between a classic & king room is - maybe it's the bed size which was very comfortable - but ""superior"" seems to be just another word for ""standard"". There was nothing jumping out at us to justify the cost of our stay except that this was 5 star hotel. The breakfast the next morning was only okay. The plates were so hot - maybe to try heat the food while in transport to the table. Mushrooms were cold & the rest of the food was barely warm. I wouldn't have liked to have paid the ‚Ç¨16 to have it as an extra!",3,2016,02,14
203,Top class,"Had a business meeting in the lounge area of the hotel. It's a magnificent venue to meet someone. Plenty of staff who appear immediately and understand service. We had teas, coffees and scones, beautifully presented, with cream, jam etc. Just out of the oven taste! There's plenty of space so business can be done. Well, it is 5 star! ",5,2016,02,14
203,Still one of the best,"Stayed here recently and if anything the hotel has got better. We booked at the last minute on the hotels own web site and received a discount. The service and attention to detail is amazing. Food, rooms, and service is top class. One thing I think was over the top was the parking fee ( ‚Ç¨25 ) for one night.

203,Best location with outstanding service...,Love everything about this hotel. Clean spacious rooms..best hotel breakfast anywhere in Europe yet!.Great location close to shops..lots of great restaurants and pubs.highly recommended. While here do the hop on hop off bus and the guinness tour...all fun and a great experience.,5,2016,02,13
203,Great place and wonderful concierg,We were two couples and both enjoyed our stay.  The concierge helped us with our rental car problems. In fact they worked directly with the rental car company to solve. They also had adapters when ours did not work for us to borrow.  We arrived early and our room was ready!!! A very welcome surprise.  The room was very comfortable.  Everything about the hotel was great.  ,5,2016,02,13
203,Great for a family of 5 in the heart of the city,"This is one of the hotels that we splurged on during our trip to Ireland. Glad we did! We're a family of five and at least half the time we have to get two rooms. Most places max out at four people per room. I called the hotel directly, and they were able to fit all of us into a single room (which saves quite a bit of money). Very nice place, great location. We used this as our base when visiting Dublin and we were able to walk to everywhere we wanted to visit.",5,2016,02,11
203,Very nice hotel,Overall this is a very nice hotel located in Dublin city center next to Grafton Street.   Upon arrival we were greeted by two friendly bellhops who were more than helpful guiding us to the front desk. The check in was easy and quick.  The room was clean and spacious and house keeping did a great job.  Breakfast at Wilde was great as was dinner at Balfes. My only critique is that the lobby/lounge does not have a proper bar.  It is set up like grandma's stuffy parlor for afternoon tea. Perhaps this Tea culture is wasted on me but I would rather sit at a bar and have a cocktail.,5,2016,02,10
203,Another lovely stay,"Charming, efficient staff who make you very welcome. Lovely decor, comfort and style exudes from every corner. This is our second excellent stay here and every bit as good as the first. 
We dined at the bistro where we had a delicious meal, beautifully cooked and presented. The entire weekend is as good as it gets.",5,2016,02,10
203,Amazng afternoon tea,"What a treat.  More expensive than other afternoon tea offerings in Dublin but worth every single penny.  After filling up on some rather delicious sandwiches, scones & pastries we sat and absorbed the wonderful surroundings while supping on our third pot of tea and began to notice how well the staff treated everybody that entered the building, including the children.  They clearly understand what good customer service is.  I can't recommend this place enough.",5,2016,02,10
203,Faultless,"Loved this hotel, friendly,efficient staff at all levels of service.excellent food and drinks. Ideally located for shopping,sightseeing,theatres,restaurants ,bars and music. This hotel has it all,can't wait to make a return third visit",5,2016,02,10
203,"Posh hotel in the best shopping area of Dublin, Grafton Street","Got in late to Dublin, but Hotel was great about arranging car service from airport.

Upon arrival, check-in was smooth.  

After traveling for hours, we saw that the bar was still open and wanted to get a bite & drink before heading to bed.  However, when we attempted to flag a server, they said they would get our order and never returned.  After waiting around for 10 minutes, we got the hint.  Headed up to the room to order room service.

We were booked in a suite and its Huge.  Large living room & bedroom.  The bathroom was smaller than expected with only a single sink.  Room had a fancy Nespresso (I have one at home, but this one took me a little longer to figure out how to use).  There's a stocked minibar, if you need a snack while waiting for room service.  The sandwich from room service was delicious.

The best part of this hotel is the convenience to the shopping, restaurants, etc.",4,2016,02,09
203,5* ,What's not to like truly 5*. Deceptively modern exterior- however grand and impressive interior. Staff friendly but yet professional. Centrally located to main shopping district with good transport links. good value for money will definitely recommend ,5,2016,02,09
203,shopping trip,"We picked this hotel for our shopping trip in December because it was so close to Grafton Street. The hotel bedrooms are very good and lived up to its expectations in every way. 

We did not dine in the hotel as we were meeting friends elsewhere for dinner, but we would definately return to this hotel again.",5,2016,02,09
203,Husband 40th birthday,We visited the westbury in January for my husband 40th birthday treat! And it was just amazing! The staff were fantastic! The hotel is so clean! And its location is just perfect! Will definitely be back again!,5,2016,02,08
203,Excellent dinner,"Had dinner here last Friday night (4th Feb) with my uncle and auntie who were staying at the hotel.

Slightly apprehensive; I thought it might be a big, soulless corporate, fancy dan type of place but my concerns were unfounded.

Vey nice, atmospheric restaurant; very friendly service and most importantly, great food.

Not the cheapest restaurant but you wouldn't expect that but if you want great service and top notch food, then give it a try.

Lovely scallops and prawn cocktail to start; very, very good perfectly cooked steak and fantastic chips for main.  Good wine list and not stupidly priced either.",4,2016,02,08
203,Amazing,"We had a fantastic stay at the Westbury right from the time we arrived at the door until we left in the car. There was a lovely 'feel' in the place.All the staff without exception were wonderful, extremely courteous, friendly & helpful. I would like to mention in particular Joseph who ensured that our stay was all it could be. Also Rory and Deize who made us a lovey coffee on Sunday morning. The room was really nice - comfortable bed & lovey big soft towels.
I am looking forward already to going back. Thank you everyone for making our stay such an enjoyable experience.
",5,2016,02,08
203,Staff so friendly,"Location is perfect, ate in the restaurant and the food and service was excellent . The staff overall couldn't have been more helpful . I would definitely stay here again loved everything about it. Breakfast was also very good.",5,2016,02,07
203,Disappointed ,"I don't mind paying good money for a good hotel room, but ‚Ç¨530 for a night in this hotel was a big mistake. I could have had just as good a room in a premier inn for a fifth of the price. The bathroom was old and knackered, draw front were falling off cupboards, the TV must have been one of the first LCD's ever produced.

To compound this, when I expressed my displeasure to the hotel staff on checking out, they said that they will get maintenance on the issue, and would I like a complimentary bottle of water. How exactly is that supposed to help me? 

The hotel rooms i this hotel are poor, substandard 3* at best.",2,2016,02,07
203,Nice ,"Stayed a night and found the hotel to be nice. Has a grand feel and the staff were very attentive and helpful. 

Found the room a little dated and not quite 5 star level. 

Great location. 

I am sure if you are staying here you will be happy enough, I just did not get that 'wow, this is a place to remember' feeling. ",4,2016,02,06
203,Local feel but 5*,"One of my favourite hotels when travelling on business. Staff are really friendly and will go out of their way to help. Bathroom was a bit too small this time in proportion to the room, but manageable. Shower was a bit temperamental too, but don't let it put you off. Top hotel in a fab location.",4,2016,02,04
203,AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING STAY 5* plus!,"I can honestly say this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The location is fantastic and the rooms are absolutely gorgeous. But what makes this hotel is the staff and the service they provide. This was a surprise weekend away for my boyfriends birthday and I decided to email the hotel in advance to see if they could help me to arrange something extra as a surprise. I was blown away by the response, not only were we upgraded to a truly beautiful room but when we arrived, there was a cake and also a bottle of wine. The person I have to thank for this is Magda in guest relations, she was absolutely superb and by the end of our email exchange I felt like I knew her. The food in the hotel was gorgeous and the bar is stunning. 100% we will be back to stay at the Westbury. I cannot thank the hotel and Magda for their excellent service and for a truly fantastic stay.",5,2016,02,04
203,Great Location and Service,"This is my second stay at the Westbury.  I returned because of the extraordinary service I received on my previous visit.  Every staff member with whom I came in contact was extremely courteous, friendly, and interested in ensuring that was valued.  Thanks to all for a great stay.",5,2016,02,03
203,January Weekend,Excellent Hotel in a great location.fantastic for shopping (great shops) ..all of the staff were very friendly and helpful ...clean and well serviced rooms... good food.... couldn't have been better for a weekend break,5,2016,02,03
203,Stunning hotel staff not great,"Just went into the hotel to have a few drinks as we had been in town 
We waited at least 7 mins until someone gave us a drinks 

It wasn't busy at all
Waiter was very young didn't know much about the cocktails
So I just said I would have a glass of prosecco 
Was easier 

Just thought it would have better service considering it was a fancy hotel 

When we asked for the bill it took ages for him to bring that too

Wouldn't go back",4,2016,02,01
203,Perfect location for a city break in Dublin,"We stayed in The Westbury as a treat for my daughters birthday. We wanted something central as we wanted to park up the car and not use it until our drive home. This hotel is in the perfect location (just off Grafton St) for shopping, dining, socialising and more. From start to finish I could not fault anything about the hotel. 
We were welcomed by a lovely young lady at reception who was very informative about the hotel facilities and surrounding areas. Check in was easy and our room was ready early as requested. As we were celebrating a birthday the receptionist wished my daughters a happy birthday and they also delivered a little birthday cake and card to the room for her that afternoon, a lovely touch! 
We will most definitely stay here again, its pure luxury and super relaxing. I would live here if I could :)",5,2016,02,01
203,Fantastic stay!,Stayed here the weekend with a group of friends and had the most fantastic stay. The staff in very department from the door men to reception are both professional and friendly and could not do enough to help you. We were made to feel special from the minute we arrived to our departure. Brilliant location and very comfortable rooms with beds that are so cosy it's hard to leave them.Cannot wait to return. ,5,2016,02,01
203,Ladies who lunch,"Yesterday Sunday four friends enjoyed a beautifully presented tasty lunch
The young man who served us was courteous and attentive 
The restaurant was buzzing and was a wonderful place to spend a wet dreary Sunday
Will certainly return soon",5,2016,02,01
203,Fantastic !,Visited Dublin last weekend and had drinks at the Westbury. Wonderful quality and service. Really sorry we did not opt to stay here as we were very disappointed with our other hotel . Hopefully it will be The Westbury next time!,5,2016,02,01
203,In the centre of things,Stayed here mid week in a twin room.  Room very small but the beds were really comfortable.  The breakfast room was lovely and the staff were friendly and efficient.  Would stay here again as it's location can't be beaten.,4,2016,02,01
203,Fabulous Service and Location,One of the nicest hotel experiences from start to finish.  The location is great although by car it is a little challenging but that is due to so much road works.  To be a few steps away from Grafton Street and St Stephen's Green is just the perfect location for a Dublin city stay.  The welcome from every member of staff was warm and friendly and we were refreshed with a hot towel as we checked in.  Our room was ready for an early check in - bonus - and we were taken to our room where everything was explained to us.  A very spacious and airy lobby area with plenty of dining and drinking options.  Although comfortable and luxurious there is no stuffiness which made our stay very enjoyable.  Complimentary bottled water in our room and also on departure which was a lovely gesture.  Would definitely recommend a stay here.,5,2016,02,01
203,Very Enjoyable stay,"We had a fantastic stay in the Westbury Hotel. The staff were very friendly and the hotel has a lovely relaxing ambiance. Our room was lovely, spacious and well presented. Highly recommend a stay in this perfectly located hotel.",5,2016,02,01
203,Outstanding,"Stayed just one night as in Dublin for a concert as a birthday treat.

Hotel is stunning- could not fault any part of it. All of the public areas are beautiful. Location is perfect- literally steps from Grafton street shopping and walkable to lots of other attractions. Staff cannot do enough for you- so friendly and genuine. 

Very highly recommended and worth the money.",5,2016,01,31
203,Old world elegance in centre of Dublin,"The location of this hotel is excellent right in the heart of the city, near all the main sights, restaurants and shops.  The staff were really welcoming and helpful.  The food in the main restaurant was excellent and good value.  The brasserie (The Balfes) was not as good, neither the quality nor value for money.",4,2016,01,31
203,"Excellent Guest Services and location, location","What can I say - warm towels at check in. After a long flight, this is wonderful. Reception was very professional and personable.  The hotel was full when I checked in so I ended up across from the elevator the first night. I was up most of the night due to the noise. The bell hop was extremely helpful and timely in bringing up our bags. Since it was late, he even insured we had enough bottled water for the night. The next morning I requested a room change and no issues what so ever. I received ample apologizes for my first night experience. Our bags were moved for us - all we had to do was pack and go enjoy our day. The beds are heaven on earth. We did have a dirty cover which I took off only to be put back on as is. And there were no wash clothes. If I would have asked it would have been corrected. The stay included breakfast which was ample and very good. There were many choices. In fact one morning we had to leave prior to when breakfast was served downstairs- the reception took our order which cannot include hot foods but still choices! It was delivered to our the next day timely and very good selection of food.  The restaurants are very good at the hotel including service. The concierge service was excellent. When we went to collect our bags, we were walked to the taxi stall and ensured we were good to go. The location is excellent with taxis outside if needed. There are so many shops and restaurants close by.  We got up early one day and walked to Saint Stephen's Green. It was a great way to start the day! I had to do laundry one day which was very close. I used All American Laundrette. To get to the hotel we took a taxi around 30 euros cash only but the bus stop is not that far away and cheaper.  We enjoyed our stay so much we even thought about changing our plans. If you are looking for a relaxing and no worries stay this is the place. You may find yourself spending a bit too much time at the hotel! We will be back for sure.",5,2016,01,30
203,"Great location, great service","I spent 1 night at the hotel in a business trip.
the staff was punctual and ready to help. you get every service you would expect from such kind of hotel.
quite room, comfy bed, all amenities in the room.
location is just great, right over the commercial area and less than 10 minutes walking distance from temple bar area.
breakfast is relatively good, with good selection and good quality.
I would definitely recommend this facility, especially given a price that is not too high if considered the hotel style.",5,2016,01,29
203,Pleasant stay,"Trip started well, we pulled up and the concierge rushed over, opened the car door, took out our bags and couldn‚Äôt have been nicer.  We went to reception to check in and told our room would be ten minutes so we had a drink in Bafle‚Äôs, service was great in there and when we went back our room was ready. First impression of the bedroom was excellent the d√©cor was lovely bed was amazingly comfortable and of course having a Nespresso machine is a bonus! I wasn‚Äôt however impressed with the bathroom, after staying in the Merrion and Fitzwilliam Hotels the Westbury‚Äôs bathroom was the worst; it was small and definitely not 5 star, this let the room down. We then had a pre dinner drink in the Marble Bar and it wasn‚Äôt so pleasant, with other tables having excellent service and plates of complimentary nibbles being placed on there plates, we were continually ignored until finally  pointed it out to one of the numerous bar staff that had walked past our table into the storeroom behind our table. To me it  was not acceptable service, the bar manager apologised and said we had been overlooked but when 5 or 6 bar staff had walked passed your table I do not take that as an excuse.  We then went to Bafle‚Äôs for our evening meal which we had not booked a table and it was a completely different experience.  The staff could not have been nicer, the staff, service and food were excellent 5 star! After staying at other five star hotels in Dublin I don‚Äôt think I will stay at the Westbury again, yes the location is great, the d√©cor in the hotel is fabulous, but there is definitely better service and rooms in other 5 star hotels in Dublin.  I will however be back to Bafle‚Äôs restaurant!",4,2016,01,29
203,Pleasant surprise,"Stumbled into the the Westbury as part of a tight hoping trip, for a night an a half, which was prepared in a haste by the travel coordinator, so didn't know what to expect. 

As the title discloses, were pleasantly surprised.

The hotel is dead in the lively center of Dublin, where it feels like no one ever sleeps. Shopping, dining, and clubbing is within a short walking distance, 
Staff, from the door men, through reception to the cleaning team were courteous and  professional.
The rooms were clean, spacious and well equipped (loved the Nespresso machine).
Breakfast wasn't included in my room fee, but the cafe at the ground floor served a a couple of nice (but pricey) alternatives.",5,2016,01,28

203,Tops !!!,"Recently visited for afternoon tea but on a Sunday at 3pm is probably not the best decision especially when we a party of 7' Inc 3 very young children

The main foyer was full but we were advised to go to the Restaurant Oscar Wilde were they served light food.

We were created by very pleasant and helpful staff whom brought us to a very quiet table. The room was not busy but I welcomed the choice of table as in aware that 3 young children can be an annoyance to others.

Our waiter was pleasant, helpful and informative, took our order and drinks were dispensed promptly.

We ordered 2 juices which took a good 20 mns to arrive, but were well worth the wait. They were fresh, light and balanced in flavor.

For the boys we ordered a burger, chicken bits and steamed broccoli. All were beautifully made using great ingredients. The burger was fresh, well cooked and topped with good cheese. The chicken bits were equally as good and encased in Panko crumbs. The broccoli for our 6 month old was cooked nicely, not too a la Dente. 

The mains for the grown ups were TOPS !!!

The chicken Caesar was beautifully made with a nice strong well balanced dressing and the addition of the whole anchovies was a good touch. The burger again was made from very good lean quality ground beef and garnished nicely. Finally the Club Sandeich was a classic of classics, again well executed.

Desserts were simple but good.

Only gripe was the cost of a glass of Pinot @‚Ç¨12, which was a tad overpriced.

Ps...great place for a sombre quality lunch especially if you have young children.",5,2016,01,27
203,Excellent,"I stayed in this hotel for two days. Simple perfect: clean and comfortable. My room was big. Staff always helpful. All the main point of interest are at walking distance.
I traveled with a colleague with a little girl and all the staff was very careful to her needs",5,2016,01,27
203,An amazing Hotel,"The Hotel is just off of Grafton Street ,about halfway along it and down a wide side street ,there is a flower stall there during the day so easy to find.
The entrance is very impressive ,big revolving doors manned by  doorman resplendent in a livery of top hat and greatcoat ,a very amenable gentleman full of humour nad very helpful about various things in Dublin.
Reception is through the doors and up a short flight of stairs and to the right ,very handily placed as after booking in the lifts to the rooms are the other side if the room.
The rooms were ,to me ,a bit on the small side ,everything you could require was in it but there was not a lot of storage to pack the cases away.
The hotel amenities were beautiful, a big lounge ,plenty of soft seats and sofas ,low tables and plenty of people waiting on and you never have long to wait for anything.
The main advantage was that the hotel location was slap bang in the middle of all the action ,Templebar and the shopping centres and St Stephens green etc.
Five star Hotel it certainly it is  and five star staff to cater for all your requirements .
Everything was as you would expect in a five star hotel ,including the price! If I was to visit Dublin again I would visit there again or at the very least visit the lounge for a break from shopping !",4,2016,01,27
203,Fantastic location and brekkie to die for,"Stayed here for my hubby's birthday last week. The location alone sells this hotel its so great being so close to grafton street. The hotel itself is beautiful and the staff are so friendly and inviting. Our room though I though a little small it was more than adequate for our needs. The breakfast was delicious and I always judge a hotel by the breakfast too, and this was top notch. 

I also like the touch of bottled water at check out and again at check in. ",4,2016,01,27
203,Lovely afternoon tea,"Classy place, polite staff and doormen . Love the deco and the atmosphere.A bit expensive indeed, which doesn't really justify but its a nice experience for every now and then. Just don't forget your purse =)",4,2016,01,26
203,Luxury hotel in centre of Dublin,"Central hotel within walking distance of hundreds of bars and restaurants and the Temple Bar area. Luxurious hotel with friendly staff who want to help. Large rooms with great design and style, and comfortable beds. Did not eat at the hotel but restaurant looked like it had a good choice and looked very nice, breakfast was next door at a linked cafe that was beautiful.",4,2016,01,26
203,Grand,"The trip, it was my partners birthday and there was a treat left in the room - so started off well as for the hotel... It was great it is well located, good sized cosy rooms with turn down every day done to a great standard. The bar was insane, we spent alot of our time there with the staff being great - made us very very welcome. The food was to an excellent standard to and what I expected of this hotel. The decor of the whole hotel was impressive - being a massive art deco and marble fan. My only main issues with the hotel was the showers, the temperature was never constant ranging from freezing, luke warm to boiling hot, no reasonable temperature; not being able to adjust room temperature and the pillows, I'd recommend asking for more, they become very flat. ",5,2016,01,25
203,one of the best in the world,"stayed three nights for our anniversary and from the moment we arrived every member of staff made us feel welcome , room was excellent , breakfast each morning was brilliant and would keep you going all day , great areas to relax around hotel with full free wifi , and lovely bar area to relax in for a quite night cap , a must visit for any ones bucket list",5,2016,01,25
203,Fabulous Hotel,"Stayed at The Westbury 2 nights from 22nd-24th January and it was everything I expected and more. Fabulous location, amazing service and the attention to detail was second to none.  The staff could not be more professional and helpful.  Room was lovely and spotlessly clean.  Would highly recommend this hotel,",5,2016,01,25
203,a perfect 5 star,great location in the heart of dublin with top class service to match from you enter until you leave.  We had a fantasic stay here and cant wait to return for a weekend break .The breakfast was excellent as well,5,2016,01,24
203,"Everything as it should be, and more","Sometimes, people just manage to make everything better! We booked a cheeky weekend away for ourselves, and every person we encountered in the Westbury seemed determined that we should enjoy ourselves as much as possible. From the genuine smiles of the doormen, to the unfailingly courteous housekeeping staff, everyone managed to strike that perfect balance between professionalism and friendliness.

We were greeted at reception by Rachel, who started our weekend on the perfect note. Hot towels were offered, along with chilled water, so we could almost literally shed our 'real' lives, and begin our mini-retreat. She was even able to offer us ""a wee bit of an upgrade""!

The room was perfectly appointed. Immaculately presented, with a fresh fruit platter (so much more attractive than cupcakes!), robes, slippers and copious quantities of soft, fluffy towels. Small touches really stood out - a large umbrella tucked into the wardrobe along with the full ironing board; adjustable reading lights as well as softer table lamps; and a Nespresso machine as well as the traditional tea facilities. 

We didn't eat evening meals in the hotel - the city centre was too much of a draw - but after enjoying the breakfast on two mornings, I'd respectfully suggest that the weighing scales in the bathroom should be a 'by request' item! The continental buffet contained very high quality pastries and an honest to goodness ""selection"" of cakes! Fruits, cereals, yoghurts and so on were all perfectly on point. My husband had the Full Irish from the cooked menu (cooked to order) and was almost childlike in his anticipation of another one on our second morning. Again, every staff member was superb - professional, prompt and attentive.

Finally, a quick word on the cocktail menu in The Marble Bar. Such a joy! The drinks are surprisingly good value - far less salubrious bars in town are charging as much if not more for mixed drinks, and with nothing like the luxury we enjoyed here. The Rose Pedal (a twist on a Hendrick's G&T) deserves a special mention. Crisp and refreshing, with just the right amount of kick. I couldn't help but have a second!

We only stayed two nights, but left feeling more refreshed than we have in months. I'm already crafting reasons to justify a return trip!",5,2016,01,24
203,Excellent customer service,We spent a night in The Westbury as a special treat for my husband's 30th birthday and were spoiled rotten from the moment we arrived. It was the perfect location for a special treat and the best night's sleep I've had in months. Thanks again to all in The Westbury who never fail to disappoint,5,2016,01,23
203,What a five star hotel should be! ,"This is a fantastic hotel in prime location. 
The service is second to none and you feel looked after from the moment you step in! Can't recommend this place highly enough! 
We stayed in a king size superior room and although small has all the facilities that you would expect in a five star hotel! What does it for me is the wonderful decor and ambience of the bar and restaurants, it has a 20's feel and opulence about it! ",5,2016,01,22
203,Ireland Spring 2015,"During the final stage of our tour of Ireland, we staying in Dublin and at the Westbury.  This is a very fine hotel, with great amenities (loved the shampoos and soaps), and helpful staff.  The rooms are a bit tight, but have all you need; the beds are comfy.  There was no view to speak of from our room - just a building straight across.  We stopped in the bar one night for a nightcap - rather uneventful, the pubs in town are much more fun.  We didn't eat at the hotel, there was just too much selection elsewhere, and it didn't really have a 'local' vibe.  The hotel is in a great location, with easy access to Grafton Street for shopping, a short walk to St Stephen's Green, and a brief walk to the Temple Bar area.  While the hotel was very nice, it's very very expensive, but I didn't think it was particularly worth the expense to stay here.",4,2016,01,22
203,Good Old Fashioned Service,"We stayed for a weekend in January with a large group of friends.From the minute we walked into The Westbury the service was exceptional. We arrived mid morning so we knew our rooms were not going to be ready but we checked in and our luggage was stored for us. Mr Downing appeared and gave us all maps and took time to run through the city and answer our questions. We then had a lovely late breakfast in Balfes. When we arrived back at the hotel later all our bags had been taken to our rooms, very efficient as we were a party of 10. The rooms were spotless and the turndown service was a lovely surprise.  Good free WiFi too. Over the whole weekend the hotel provided a superb level of service, from the reception to the restaurants, the housekeeping, lounge staff and concierge. This, along with the great location, makes The Westbury a fantastic place to stay in such a interesting, diverse city. Our only regret is not sampling the afternoon tea, we will just have to come back another time!",5,2016,01,21
203,Luxury in the heart of Dublin,"A better location to enjoy what Dublin has to offer would be hard to find. Step outside and you'll see the iconic McDaid's pub ...watering hole of Kavanagh, Behan and many other literary greats..The shops of Grafton Street are a stone's throw away. All in all, The Westbury is a treat to be remembered.",5,2016,01,21
203,Very nice stay,"We stayed here the first weekend of January for a long weekend .
Lovely hotel with a turn down service- a little annoying to be asked at 6.30 whilst dressing if it was convent to do turndown.The first night the bottled water not replaced which seemed a little mean to me.
Comfy beds and pillows which meant a very good nights sleep.
We had the Irish breakfast and it was ok. The second day breakfast was a more muddled affair with slow service and food stuffs and juices on the buffet area not being replaced.
The hotel is in an excellent location, the staff are very good and we were looked after very well.
I would certainly stay again.",4,2016,01,19
203,Centrally Located Hotel,"Just visited The Westbury Hotel for a 3 day weekend, arrived and was swiftly checked in, just before dinner time we discovered that there was slippers but no robes, we called housekeeping and this was quickly rectified.  Replenishment of the tea and coffee in the room was poor. We ran out of coffee on the second day and only by leaving the little coffee chest open to draw the maids attention to it was it fully filled up. The tea situation was not much better, no Irish breakfast tea replaced during my stay ended up on my last morning having some sort of fruit tea, now this might seem picky but this is a five star hotel!!!  I expect better. We stayed on a room only basis as breakfast was astronomical in my opinion. We found lovely little eateries for breakfast nearby at a fraction of the cost. Location of hotel is fantastic and rooms are nice.",4,2016,01,18
203,The standard all other hotels have to meet.,From the doorman opening the taxi door to bidding us a safe journey home when we checked out The Westbury delivered a delightful experience at every turn. A quality hotel that goes the extra mile as standard.,5,2016,01,18
203,Fabulous Dublin Experience,"This was without doubt the best Hotel experience I have ever had . Wonderful luxury , helpful caring staff, location, location, location and a most amazing breakfast . I availed of their 30th Annivarary Suite sale and our 
 accomodation was magnificent suite 425 at a price that was only marginally above many lessor hotels and if im lucky enough to stay there again il request the same room . From the doormen to the receptionists waiting staff and housekeeping , nothing was too much trouble and my wife and I had a most enjoyable time .",5,2016,01,17
203,Five star,"I will come again next time i am up from Alicante.real five star with very helpful staff who do thier best to please. They have very good free wifi, with a good signal. In centre of city with a taxi rank outside.  Bar waiter service very good.Try it you find yourself in Dublin.",5,2016,01,17
203,Luxury in dublin,"My wife and I stayed here for a Friday night in January. Excellent location, excellent comfort, and first class service. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Yes it is a little pricier than other places, but I really believe it is money well spent. We had stayed in the Shelbourne in December, and this beats it hands down.",4,2016,01,16
203,Impeccable Hotel,The Westbury is perfectly located and the service is impeccable.  We stayed for four nights. In addition to visiting sites in Dublin we took day trips traveling north and south of the city to see major sites in Wicklow and the the Boyne Valley.  What a wonderful hotel to  return to   each day.  The breakfasts are outstanding - be sure to include it in your stay.   The lobby is a beautiful placebo sit and have tea or a snack.  Rooms are wonderfully appointed and comfortable.  We will return ...why try anything else when this is perfect.,5,2016,01,15
203,Geniune 5 star hotel,"This is a grand hotel with the quality of attentive service you would expect from a proper five star hotel.  It is right in the centre of Dublin and to make it better I was upgraded, my room was large and luxurious.  I thoroughly enjoyed my three day stay and will be staying there again.",5,2016,01,14
203,Back again and glad to be here,"During the past 7 or 8 years we have been visiting friends in Galway and our final stop before we fly home has always been Dublin. About 5 years ago we started staying at the Westbury on a regular basis and have never looked back. The Hotel is located right in the heart of Dublin with easy access to Grafton Street and all the sights you could want. The staff is fantastic, from the moment you check in you feel as if they have read your preferences and made sure everything is covered. The Hotel has been updated recently and it shows nicely. We chose to stay in the King 1 bedroom Suite which was located on the 6th floor and very nicely appointed. It has a lovely separate living area, bedroom area and bathroom which gives it a homely feel. We always have a least one ""Afternoon Tea"" at the Westbury which is a must, add a glass of Champers and you're all set for a wonderful afternoon. We will be back again in Dublin shortly and we will be staying at the Westbury without doubt.",4,2016,01,13
203,Best Service,"I am giving this hotel a five because of the outstanding customer service. Yes the rooms were clean, rooms are nice, but the service was awesome. From start to finish everyone was so cheerful and happy to help. 
The work out room is small but they do have good apples to eat for post work out. Not to mention amazing healthy fruit blends for breakfast. 
Location is really fun and in the heart of Dublin. ",5,2016,01,13
203,"Great, but not perfect","We stayed in a 4 poster suite for 3 nights at the weekend. The hotel is nice, perfectly located and the room was lovely. The bed was really comfy and the bath products and towels were of a high quality. 

It was so lovely that the hotel send a little cake and card for my partners birthday, it was very thoughtful of you so thank you for that! 

The unsung heroes of this hotel are the housekeeping team. They were fantastic and we loved the turn down service, they really reinforced the 5* accreditation of this hotel.

A couple of niggles, our key cards stopped working twice (I kept them away from my phone as I used to work at a hotel so know the drill) and our hotel room door did not shut properly, you had to shut it and then pull it until it clicked (room 339 I believe) which is a bit worrying when you were going out for the day. I was a little disappointed that we did not have breakfast included in our rate, as I believed that this was standard procedure for a hotel of this calibre, however there are plenty of lovely bakeries and caf√©s nearby. 

Overall, we loved our Dublin trip and The Westbury was a perfect base. Housekeeping are fantastic here, I just feel like this hotel was missing the certain spark and pizazz to make this a really special place. ",4,2016,01,13
203,First class hotel!,"We stayed at the hotel at the end of November 2015. We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel - it is clean, comfortable and spacious. Service was also of a high standard - with complimentary chocolates being offered both evenings. Also a very good concierge service, all of the gentlemen were helpful and friendly. 

The lounge/sitting area is very comfortable and could have stayed all afternoon drinking cocktails! Did not sample the breakfast nor dinner therefore cannot comment on meals however did see a couple having afternoon tea which looked delicious. 

A wonderful stay. Location of the hotel is brilliant, central to everything. Highly recommended",5,2016,01,12
203,Great location for city break,"Service at the westbury hotel is second to none from the moment you drive up to the door until the moment you drive away.
The lounge and bar is well situated but the prices are quite high. The location is brilliant as you literally step out the door and you are within walking distance of all the best shops and restaurants.
Breakfast at the westbury is something else with an unbelievable selection  of cold and cooked food and as with every thing the service is brilliant. Unfortunately room 328 where we stayed had a very badly stained carpet, not what you expect from a 5 star hotel",4,2016,01,12
203,"""Had a lovely weekend""","Westbury Hotel is by far my favourite hotel to stay in Dublin. It has a great location for shopping and enjoying Dublin city centre yet was very quiet and relaxing. Staff and managers both were attentive, efficient and helpful. ",5,2016,01,11
203,One night in Westbury,Very pleasant stay. Managed to get checked in at 11.15 as we had early arrival in Dublin. Great to have a base for the day shopping so early. Had lunch. Initially told the table by the windows were booked for afternoon tea but a very nice waiter said we could have the table if we could be finished in 45 minutes. We were only having a snack and were delighted to agree as the view out on to Grafton strret was worth it. Lovely breakfast also. Served til 11 so as you can make the most of the morning.,5,2016,01,10
203,Balffe restraunt,"Staff helpful and attentive. Meal okish  could have been larger and hotter. Menu confusing ,surly it could be laid out a bit more user friendly. Stake very good sauce very good. Fish so so. Potatoes lumpy. What is with this fashion here and other places too of little jars for some dishes .I like my apple crumble on a dish easily accessable no slates little microwaveable jars or pieces of drift wood .Plates and dishes please.
overall quite ok.",4,2016,01,09
203,Perfect location! ,"Recently stayed at The Westbury Hotel for 4 nights as part of our family Christmas vacation. This was our first trip to Dublin and despite being a Platinum Marriott member I decided to branch out and selected The Westbury based on its prime location and positive internet reviews.  

We arrived from the airport at 930pm on a very rainy New Year's Day.  Check in was smooth and friendly and the concierge was quick to assist us to quickly get our luggage from our taxi and out of the rain. 

Unfortunately for us, we arrived on the one day of the year when the famous Dublin pubs and restaurants close at 10pm.  In fact, just about everything in Dublin was shut but all four of us were very hungry.  A call down to the concierge sparked a determined effort on his behalf to find us an option for a late dinner. The hotel even offered to keep the kitchen staff back a few extra minutes beyond their scheduled 10pm close to accommodate us but instead we chose to take a walk and try our luck.  In the end a Nandos located around the corner did the job.

The hotel itself is well appointed in a traditional and charming style.  Our room was more than spacious enough for the four of us and (crucially for my two teenagers) the room's wifi worked very well.  Beds were very comfortable too! 

Hotel staff were very friendly and attentive. Turn down service was offered each night and although we never used it, we gratefully accepted the daily chocolates and they were delicious! 

The location of this hotel is excellent. Located just off Grafton Street and easy walking distance to Trinity College, local attractions and the famous Temple Bar area. 

All in all a superb hotel experience coupled with prime location and there is no doubt we will choose The Westbury Hotel again on out next visit to Dublin.",5,2016,01,09
203,Superb environment and service,"From the moment we arrived, the attitude of the staff was amazing. The concierge went out of his way to assist us with all our needs throughout our stay. The chocolates delivered during the turndown service were not only delicious but a nice touch. We had one issue with our room not getting cleaned in a timely manner. We told the manager and immediately had the room cleaned and a call from the guest relations manager. She invited us to the bar for complimentary drinks or offered to send wine to our room to apologize. I think that a sign of exceptional service is not that there are no mistakes made, but how management responds when there are issues. They responded quickly and the drinks were very thoughtful. We will definitely stay at this hotel again!",5,2016,01,08
203,Best Afternooon Tea! - Pricey - but worth it!,"Myself and my OH visited The Westbury for Afternoon Tea on New Years Day, and when I heard the price (45euro pp), I was taken aback and skeptical, but it was an EXPERIENCE, and absolutely worth it.  In short, the food is scrumptious, the beverages are incredible, I've never seen such amazing staff, and the setting is breathtaking.

The Food:
Couldn't fault it.  I don't even eat ham - yet enjoyed the ham sandwich.  There was turkey in a brioche roll - and it was divine! My OH doesn't like egg, and loved the egg sandwich! The scones and treats were beautiful! The presentation was gorgeous.  We were even offered additional sandwiches - which has never happened to us before, and is great for me because I usually find afternoon tea too sugar heavy and crave more savoury!  We were delighted!
We were also allowed switch between whatever drinks we liked - which again we were never offered before! So I'd a lovely sampling of Nutella Hot Chocolate - followed by coffee, followed by regular hot chocolate!  Delighted with life!

The Location / Setting:
The Westbury is located just off Grafton St. in Dublin (one of the main shopping streets), and we were sat in a huge window that looked out onto it! We had a beautiful spot, but I think any table there would be gorgeous - it is so well designed, you wouldn't feel too close to any other table.  The decor is beautiful and the whole ambience is very relaxed but opulent.

The Staff:
I've never experienced the like! They were so friendly, warm, professional but genuine too.  

We both agreed, it was a great treat, but definitely worth it, and we would recommend it to anyone!  We were sent off with the bits we couldn't eat in a little box, and they insisted on giving us hot chocolates to go! We felt amazing afterwards.  So it was more than food - it was an uplifting experience!",5,2016,01,07
203,Birthday celebrations.,Really enjoyed my stay.We got to check into our room at 11.30am.Hot towels were provided at check in.The room was very comfortable and location is fantastic.Cake and a birthday card were sent to the room which was a lovely touch.,5,2016,01,06
203,"I have the simplest tastes, I am always satisfied with the best.....",""" I have the simplest tastes, I am always satisfied with the best.."" Oscar Wilde.   I am confident that Oscar Wilde himself would be very satisfied that the main dining room in the Westbury hotel is named after him! Unfortunately Wilde the restaurant was closed for renovations during my recent stay in the Westbury but breakfast in The Gallery was superb, delicious.My sisters and I were on our annual Christmas shopping trip to Dublin. The warmth of Westbury welcome awaits each guest at the front door. The Valets meet and greet and one is instantly a valued guest.Reception attend to every detail efficiently and ensure that each guest is enveloped in a relaxed, luxurious aura for the duration of their visit. We enjoyed every moment. Our room was perfect, cosy, immaculate, divine beds. Housekeeping staff are so helpful and so kind regardless of request. Residents are always priority in The Gallery and bar which is a huge relief on a busy Saturday afternoon when weary shoppers need respite and sustenance stepping off Grafton Street. Stepping into the Westbury is the ultimate treat at Christmas time, the decor, the ambience and most of all the wonderful staff. The Westbury is simply the best in Dublin, Oscar Wilde would agree!",5,2016,01,06
203,First Class!,"We booked the Westbury as a special treat for my birthday & Wedding Anniversary! From the minute we arrived in our car at the front of the hotel and it was whisked away to be valet parked we knew the first class service that was in store! The check in was busy when we arrived but we were immediately noticed by a member of staff and assured that he would get someone to take care of us and in minutes they did! Our room was beautiful and comfortable and had complimentary deserts to denote our special occasions! The location is the best in Dublin for those who enjoy being at the heart of the city, shopping, restaurants and great nightlife all at hand - we had no need for a taxi or car all weekend! The staff are so friendly yet professional I simply cannot say enough for them! A great hotel for a special occassion, it is a little on the expensive side but worth every penny! Look forward to visiting again!",5,2016,01,05
203,Superb hotel in the heart of the city,"A few days in Dublin over New Year was made special by staying at the Westbury.  The hotel has a lovely lively buzz about it, with a busy cafe and bar next to reception.  The room we had on the 4th floor was comfortable, dark and quiet, which made for some long lie-ins after a Guinness or two.

What makes the Westbury really special are the excellent staff.  The standard of their service from start to finish was absolutely top notch and I'd like to offer a particular thanks to the head barman who looked after my wife's brooch when she lost it in the White Marble Bar on Wednesday night.

My brother recommended the Westbury to me and I will be very happy to pass on his recommendations to anyone looking for a top hotel in Dublin.

One point for improvement - sort the lifts out.",5,2016,01,05
203,"Great atmosphere, perfect location to everything and dreambed's!","This hotel is perfect for a romantic weekend, quiet, but still in the heart of everything.
You gonna love these beds and their breakfast served with kindnes!

Just outside you find the pubs and smal nice restaurant's. This hotell is not suited for shopaholics because you find everything within 10minutes of walking:-)

Do not go to Guiness ...just one big tourist machine with no authentic feeling left....all you see is digital signage and speakers. Take a hop on an off bus ... Walk the streets and see the parks and historical places. Enjoy the food, pubs and shopping.",5,2016,01,04
203,A Fantastic Stay! - A true 5 star hotel,"We stayed in The Westbury Hotel during Christmas this year.  Check in was on Christmas eve, the hotel was crazy busy, which provided a fab atmosphere.  Check in was smooth, friendly and efficient and we had been upgraded which was really lovely :o) 

We also enjoyed Christmas dinner in the hotel on 25th, one of the best meals I have ever eaten! The team was so friendly and efficient on the day, it was a lovely experience.

I can't say enough great things about this hotel and its staff, service and dining, but one thing I can say, ""The Westbury Hotel is a 'true' 5 star hotel in every way"".

Thank you to the team for looking after us, we look forward to our next stay and would recommend this hotel 100% for anyone travelling to Dublin!",5,2016,01,04
203,Luxury treat,"We enjoy on occasions visiting this Hotel for drinks whenever in the City. This time we decided to treat ourselves to an overnight stay. This really is a lovely Hotel in every way. From the tourist / visitor point of view it's right in the centre of the shopping district near Grafton St. For a luxury 5 star stay it's a delight. The reception was friendly and helpful, the room was luxury, and the breakfast in Wilde's restaurant next morning was top class. In every way this really is a Hotel to be proud of itself. The staff cannot do enough (without being overly intrusive), and the stay was just made an experience to (hopefully) be repeated.....enjoy.",5,2016,01,03
203,3 nigh New Year break.,"Great location, hotel beautifully decorated and furnished, excellent food, lovely towels and toiletries and every member of staff could not have been more professional, helpful and friendly.  If being really picky, the toilet in our room was very low down which would be difficult for some people to use and could do with more lighting in the room but lack of light seems to be something experienced in a lot of hotel rooms.  Although a little on the pricey side, would most certainly return to this lovely hotel, well worth the money.",5,2016,01,03
203,Disappointing Breakfast Service,"This hotel is stunning, there is no other way to describe it. The welcome out of the taxi, the escort up the steps to reception (he man was gliding rather than walking!) and the check in experience were excellent. We were early so happy to leave our bags and go for lunch. They offered to call us when our room was ready but we said it would be fine as we wouldn't be back any earlier than the normal check in time. 

The room was absolutely superb but there had been a slight mix up with the bags we left so rather than them being in our room, we had to call down for them. Not a big deal as these things happen.

However, the little niggles started from here. There is a large area outside the bar where food, afternoon tea and drinks are served which is lovely but whilst we got a table no problem (bar was full), we did observe residents being told there was nowhere for them to sit unless they were willing to wait which I wouldn't have appreciated. We came back from dinner and decided to have a nightcap and still could not get into the bar but got a table outside without any issues. The next day we tried the bar twice and couldn't get a table even though we could see empty tables. My husband spoke to one of the supervisors as he wanted to surprise me with a bottle of champagne the next day before we left to end a great weekend. He was told that tables could not be reserved but he would be on duty so would make sure we got a table. The next day he was not on duty, there were tables reserved but we were able to sit at the bar.

The worst part was breakfast on the 2nd morning. We were being given complimentary breakfast as we were staying for 2 nights but the restaurant could not cope with us and everyone else who qualified for the offer. 
We came down and were told there would be minimum 45min wait for a table which would have taken us past the time breakfast ended. We talked about it and I went back and asked if we could eat our breakfast in the seating area and were told by the only person without a name badge that he would check with his collegue but then went back into the restaurant and started clearing tables. 2 couples were then seated in the seating area for their breakfast while we were left standing. We decided to not have breakfast and go out instead after we packed and checked out. When we went to check out I spoke to the lovely man helping us and he got the Guest Services manager to help us. We explained what happened and he spoke to the restaurant manager who all of a sudden was able to give us a beautiful table next to the fire and could provide anything off the breakfast menu even though it was now past the time it was due to end. The food was wonderful.

We sort of felt that the staff seemed under a lot of pressure in the restaurant and the seating area outside. Instead of them appearing like swans elegantly going along and paddling furiously out of sight which is expected in that bracket of luxury hotel, they were more like pigeons where you could see them running about aimlessly.

Would certainly return but would not have breakfast, would have been quicker but not as good if we had gone to M&S.",4,2016,01,02
203,Old Charm ,"Lovely hotel right in the centre of Dublin close to all the shops and attractions. The hotel is lovely inside and full of charm, with the foyer full of people enjoying the famous afternoon tea in front of the open fire. Check in was swift and we enjoyed a lovely cocktail whilst the staff brought our cases to the room. We ate in the restaurant in the hotel which was excellent. The staff at the front door were the most helpful I have ever came across always stopping for a chat and giving excellent directions (they even gave us umbrellas as they rightly predicted a rain storm). When my partner and I could not get a reservation in a local restaurant, the front door staff even managed to get us a table in the Wilde restaurant at 22:00!! This is the service that really makes the hotel 5 star. 
We also drank in the bar which was very cosy serving great cocktails and whiskey. I will definitely stay in the Westbury next time I am in Dublin City.",5,2016,01,02
203,disappointing,Booked in for 2 nights between xmas and new year and have to say we were most disappointed with the quality of service.  The hotel was busy but that is no excuse.  We ate in the gallery part on both evenings and it took nearly an hour for our meal to arrive on one of these evenings. Breakfast was ok - the selection of buffet was average.  Our experience on second day for breakfast was bad.  We were shown to our table and after 20 minutes of waiting had to go and find someone to serve us.  It was very chaotic on this particular morning.  We asked for newspapers in the morning which never arrived in the room.  On checking out we stood in the foyer for 30 minutes for our car to arrive with no explanation as to what the problem was.  After speaking with Adam he told us that the car was blocked in and we could wait in the restaurant and he would call us from there.  Why were we not told of this instead of standing around for so long. The rooms are fine and quiet and beds are very comfortable. However the poor quality of service during our visit was disappointing.  I don't think we will return to this hotel because of that,3,2016,01,01
203,Great Location.... Great Buzz,"We recently returned to the Westbury for a weekend stay.

The hotel continues to be the best location in Dublin for a weekend stay, with easy access to all the top shops and restaurants and a great buzz in the mezzanine / bar area.

Worth looking for special deals as the standard rate can be expensive.",5,2016,01,01
203,Little Details Matter,"The Positive
We are in a Luxury Suite, 1 King Bed from before Christmas and just after new years. The space is large and has a balcony type space.

The bed is comfortable, the large freestanding tub is nice and there is a separate toilet room which makes sharing the bathroom easier. 

Room service is fast and friendly, faster than any service you'll get in the city. Maid service is fast and efficient. All food servers are friendly as are the maids. 

Needs Improvement

We were locked out of our room twice (our key cards failed). The first time I waited in line 10 mins. Second time the concierge had to come back to my room to key us in with a master key.

We asked to book a taxi for the following morning because we had to catch a tour. We were told by the front desk, you don't need to. We were told come down to the front door at 6 am and a line of taxis will be waiting to take you (we had a 6:40 meeting time for a tour group). We came down at 6 am and there were no taxis. I asked if the doorman could book one, he said no need to, there was one coming right back. About 6:10 I said I was going to ask the front desk to call a taxi, the doorman told me he would do it. The doorman came back at 6:15 and told me that it would take half an hour for the taxi to arrive (this waiting time plus the time of the drive would make us miss our tour). A taxi showed up that another family had booked and we pleaded with him to take us the ten min drive. He reluctantly agreed. I tipped him almost 40% for helping us. Tip: If they tell you to not book a taxi for the morning, insist that they book you a taxi. 

The day of the tour we requested a wake up call at the front desk. There is no clock radio in the room. No clock anywhere. I have never stayed in a hotel without a clock radio and alarm by the bed. The wake up call was 15 minutes late, luckily my internal clock woke me up at the right time. When I mentioned that there was no clock radio and no Ipod docking station in the room at the front desk as was promised on the website where I booked the room, the young man behind the desk told me that previous guests didn't like the clock radio. He was making fun of me for the amusement of the young female desk agent standing next to him and pretended to take a note about it. The young woman was the woman who checked us in on arrival and was always polite and instead of looking amused at his behavior she appeared shocked.",3,2016,01,01
203,Two December nights at the Westbury in Dublin,"My wife and I are just back from the Westbury, our Hotel of choice whenever in Dublin.

This trip was to get some relaxation in before a busy start to 2016 and the Westbury did the job perfectly.

From the moment we stepped up to the front door the staff delivered a service which was professional, but more importantly warm and friendly, and sincere.

The Hotel location is perfect, the room was lovely, but as I've always said its the people at the Westbury who make the difference. A special mention to the team at Balfes who always make it a real pleasure to wine and dine there.

Looking forward to returning soon.",5,2015,12,31
203,Wonderful experience,I visited The Westbury in December for afternoon tea with family. It was a very enjoyable afternoon with the Christmas atmosphere in full swing. The food was superb & I could not fault the staff & service. This is worth booking for a special treat.,5,2015,12,30
203,Exceptional stay,"This stay was exceptional.The hotel was very busy and even so everything just flowed,from the time we arrived to the time we left. Upon arrival which was very early we left our bags and phone number, to receive a call when our room was ready. We received a very nice room on the fifth floor with views of Grafton Street, very very quiet which is always a plus.The bed was very comfortable and the atmosphere in the hotel was full of  Seasonal cheer. The Westbury Hotel is a hard act to follow. Looking forward to next time.

              ",5,2015,12,30
203,Perfect post Christmas treat!,"First time staying here for a night.  Found the staff at check-in to be very pleasant and chatty.  Weather was awful when we arrived and we almost blew in the door but no-one batted an eye!  We left our bags as had arrived early, did some shopping and returned to the hotel about 3.  We had booked a table in the lounge and were looking forward to enjoying a glass of wine there and we spent a couple of hours whiling away the afternoon, chatting and people watching.  The lounge was completely full at any given time with parties coming in and partaking in afternoon tea and drinks.

Our room, on the 3rd floor was on the small side but perfectly formed, decorated and spotlessly clean.  Bathroom was impeccable with the usual toiletries supplied and luscious big bath towels.  Beds were extremely comfortable.  Everything worked perfectly and shower, although in the bath was divine.

Breakfast was very good with the usual cold buffet and we were provided with a menu offering a selection of hot food, e.g. full Irish breakfast, pancakes, eggs benedict, etc.  We did try the pancakes but felt they were not the best we have every tasted.  Also the service at breakfast was slightly haphazard and slow.  I felt there were too many guests all with differing requests and too few staff on.  However, we were not in a hurry so we didn't really mind but it might annoy someone who was in a hurry.

Of course the location is fantastic and given the wet and windy day that was in it was great to be able to be able to offload our shopping with ease.

As a real treat I would definitely stay here again and it can't come quick enough!",5,2015,12,30
203,First Class Hotel in The Centre Of Dublin,"A very welcoming Hotel With friendly staff. It is a large Hotel but does feel very ""homely"" as well.  The location is also excellent for Shops, restaurants & night life. It was a shame that during our stay they were decorating the breakfast room, therefore breakfast had to be taken in the main lobby, a little chaotic at times but the staff did as best they could! There is a great well stocked bar.",4,2015,12,30
203,best location amazing,"best location on Grafton street 
lovely staff , so helpful and friendly 
the restaurant/bar at the entrance is the best place to have a drink and smoke your cigar

I will definitely stay there again anytime I visit dublin",5,2015,12,30
203,Wonderful Christmas stay!,"This is a lovely hotel in a terrific location - just off Grafton Street.  So easy to walk anywhere.  The staff was extremely helpful and pleasant with any and all requests! We really enjoyed our meals in the 2 restaurants on site.  The room was really nice as well.  They really go all out with holiday decorations!

Other reviewers have pointed out the subpar fitness center.  It is very small, with only 1 treadmill and other cardio equipment.  My husband and I like to run side by side on treadmills, but this wasn't possible here.  But one could bike while the other ran. Not the end of the world!

Overall a lovely hotel and terrific stay.  The staff is wonderful!",5,2015,12,29
203,Exceptional hotel,Ideal location for a girly shopping trip. Staff and hotel were amazing and we will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Dublin. Brown Thomas just around the corner was a bonus and there were also some trendy cocktail bars nearby including house. Food in hotel was also very good and I can't wait to come back. ,5,2015,12,29
203,A Relaxing Trip to Dublin,"I was in Dublin for a short visit, and had a night at the Westbury. The hotel is elegant and the staff friendly and hospitable - I wasn't happy with the first room I was offered, but the receptionist moved me to an alternative very quickly. The rooms are big and comfortable, bathrooms well appointed with lots of thoughtful touches.WWilde's was a good place for dinner and a glass of wine, but I'd recommended breakfast upstairs to enjoy the full Westbury experience.  ",5,2015,12,28
203,Great Experience,"The Westbury Hotel is centrally located to restaurants, pubs and shopping all easily accessible and convenient. Staff was knowledgeable and very accommodating.  Our room was lovely and we were able to enjoy restful nights.  We had one minor complaint:was that it was a bit difficult to find because our GPS did not recognize the address that we had been given.  However, once we found the hotel we parked the car for 4 days, so it ended well!",5,2015,12,25
203,Very stylish,The hotel is perfectly located in the city center. The room is large and bright. Service excellent. The breakfast was very good and there are lots of choices in the buffet and you can top it with meat option,5,2015,12,24
203,"Location, Comfort, and Modernity","This was an excellent hotel, and beautifully decorated for Christmas. Though my room was not ready at check-in, when I did settle in, it was comfortable and spacious. The room had two double beds, similar to hotels in the United States, so I highly recommend it for those who prefer to stretch out before bed. For this tired traveler, the ability to get a good night's sleep was much appreciated. The location was perfect, as it was just off of the major shopping area of Grafton Street, and was a short walk to the Temple Bar district (close enough without being in the midst of the nonsense). St. Stephen's Green was also only a few steps away. The last time I was in town, I made it to The Westbury for tea. A special experience. This time, I did not make tea, but I am pleased that I was able to stay overnight.",5,2015,12,24
203,xmas stay,"This hotel is a bit of a mixed bag.  I booked a studio room, and was then told that I would have to pay an extra  25 euro for a roll away bed. So I downgraded my stay to a twin room.  What a strange policy. To lose over 100 euro, for the sake of 25 euro. But that is their policy apparently... The check in was a little stressy as I could not remember my pin for my new credit card, and the jobsworth receptionist would not let us check in without a credit card,  as I had left the pin the car, so I had to pay by visa debit before I could get to the room. It was a bit ridiculous, as they had our bags, and our car,  so where were we going?

Next I wanted to book a table in the Wilde restaurant.  Despite calling 10 times the night before, and 6 times the next day, no one answered the phone.  So how much business was lost during that time?  I have never had the experience of a hotel not answering the phone. NEVER.  

Needless to say, by the time I got through, I was told that the restaurant was fully booked, and only when I said I would be resident, a table was made available.  However the restaurant was, at best, half full, the entire time we were there, so it was not fully booked, and again, if I had not pushed it, and told them of my stay there, another booking would have been lost.  A half full restaurant turning away business is a strange business model.

The meal itself was delicious, we had the festive xmas menu. But again here, no vegetables were brought to the table, for the main, and we had to ask for them. We were told that it is not standard practice to bring vegetables with the main course. Really?  Again, I have never heard of this.  The vegetables were listed on the set menu.  They were not very appealing, granted, described as  'braised vegetables', evoking memories of canteens and their tasteless veg, but nevertheless, not even a potato, was delivered to the table!  By the time we got them, we had finished our mains.  However the food we did get was delicious, and well worth the price.  

Breakfast was chaotic the next morning.  A 10 minute wait, at 10am, naturally, as at xmas, most of us are  on holidays, and want a late breakfast.  So why the breakfast can't be extended to 11 or 12 at peak times, is a mystery.  I have stayed in hotels, (not in Ireland, of course!), where breakfast is extended to 12pm at weekends.  Also, my friends had to check out early, and despite breakfast being advertised as starting at 6.30, they were told it would not be until 7. Even though this was too late for them.  I advised them to come down at 6.30, and they would have to see to them. 

When the breakfast eventually appeared,after a long wait, after the wait to be seated,  the eggs benedict had gone hard from being kept under a grill, and had to be returned, since a runny egg is the signature of eggs benedict.  The rest of the breakfast fayre was the usual buffet, with nothing special to commend it. No chef cooking eggs to order, or anything extra to differentiate it from a three or four star hotel.  Nothing special in other words.

The concierge service is fab.  Just pull up, and they take your car and park it for 25 euro per stay.  But the Shelbourne Hotel does the same, so this is not a unique service.  But the guys taking the cars, are so friendly, and welcoming that they are the best PR the hotel could have.  Lovely guys, who impressed me enough to give a good sized tip.   

The last surprise was the request for a late check out. It was complimentary until 1pm, but then 25% of the cost of your booking to stay an extra 2 hours until 3pm.  I guess this is to deter late check outs, but then why bother, as an extra 25% for the room would have added a hefty cost to my bill for an extra couple of hours. Either offer it for a reasonable price, or don't offer it at all.  

All in all, I enjoyed the stay.  It is great to be able to step out onto Grafton St, for shopping, and having a very pleasant memory of afternoon tea, years ago, I will definitely return again.  I didn't even try to book afternoon tea, as no doubt that would have been 'fully booked' too.  So I will return.  

But given that there is no spa, pool, or other 5 star services, the hotel needs to up its game on the customer service.  It is unacceptable to have to phone 16 times simply to book dinner!  To end on a positive note, I was on the fifth floor and the view was great!  The room was lovely, very clean, comfortable beds, and the bathroom well appointed. Take out the weighing scales though, the temptation to weigh myself proved too much, so when I eventually steeled myself to stand on it, it told me I had lost a stone. A lovely thought, but not possible, lol!   And full marks for making wi-fi easy and hassle free to access.",4,2015,12,24
203,Elegant Hotel in perfect location,"The Westbury in Dublin is an excellent hotel It is a bit tricky to get to by car, and when I arrived, the Valet must have been on break. There was literally no one at the front of this very busy hotel at noon on a weekday. I had to park my car illegally, walk up the stairs to the lobby and ask someone to find the valet. OK, now that I've gotten that out of my system, everything else was outstanding. It is in the best location I could imagine if you are a tourist. It is right in the middle of the best shopping district in Dublin, blocks from Trinity University and many other interesting places. The room was small by US standards, but very elegant. I would go back.",4,2015,12,23

203,Beautiful luxurious hotel,"Excellent hotel. 5 star service from the staff and the room was small but perfectly appointed and comfortable. Breakfast also had everything and was delicious. 
tip: If staying in a room by the lift there is quite a lot of noise from people",5,2015,12,21
203,Revisit after 25 years,"My wife and I stayed in the Westbury Hotel 25 years ago around the Christmas time. 25 years later and we booked in as I had some business to do in Dublin. Even though the car park was full the concierge was over like a flash to my car and he found a parking space for me. In the car park I met the night porter who was about to start work and he was a really nice guy who offered to carry my suitcase even though he hadn‚Äôt started work yet. Every time I passed him that evening or the following morning we had a few words which is nice when hotel staff take time to be friendly. The reception staff was very professional with big smiles something you don‚Äôt often see anymore in hotels of this quality, they offered complimentary water and newspaper. The bedrooms are excellent with all the mod cons you would expect. The following morning I had to leave early for Belfast so I missed breakfast. However my wife took great pleasure in calling me on route to say that I was missing a fantastic breakfast as she sat overlooking Grafton Street from her table. Hopefully it won‚Äôt be another 25 years before we get back to The Westbury.",5,2015,12,21
203,Global service leader who helped make a wedding really great,"Stayed at the westbury for a wedding.
Had a tremendous time.
The level of service across the team , from the moment I was greeted by the door man to the late night manger who I checked it with was excellent, warm, friendly, attentative and professional.
The food served at the wedding was of a really high standard , which I think is hard when serving 100 plus people at once, it really felt like you'd ordered an individual dinner.
The hotel has a great location, and a good quality Finnish in terms of room spec and decor, the rooms are a bit small (but it's in a city centre) , the gym is a bit basic , and it's a bit expensive , but all these bits are off set by the great service and standards of the hotel and its staff. ",5,2015,12,21
203,Mixed Feelings,"I stay in hotels a lot so perhaps I view things from too many different perspectives.  This hotel was GREAT in many regards but average or sub-par in others, so perhaps a detailed listing will help best.

The top pro has to be the location. This hotel is in the heart of everything and I cannot imagine a better location for a family looking to hang in Dublin proper for a few days.  I would similarly describe the staff as a plus, though I would caveat that by pointing out  that the staff is often besieged.  I worked with the concierge team a lot and found all of the team to be professional and helpful. The hotel benefits from this talented group.
The hotel is beautifully decorated, so that has to be described as a pro as well.

The cons are awkward.  First, the gym is crap, to be fair and blunt. They do offer a visitor deal at a local gym but I expect better from an elite hotel.  The food offerings can only be described as minimalistic.  Again, they were renovating Wilde while I was there but I can only write about what I experienced, and none of it was all that good.  
Besides being sparce, the rooms lack the accoutrements that I am used to seeing in other top hotels around the world.  They could do better.

So let me sum up by saying if you are looking for location, this may be your best spot.  I would look at the Marion if staying in somewhere small was acceptable, as it tops the Westbury on several fronts.  I will ultimately give the place another chance, it is a great location and there are a lot of positives.",4,2015,12,20
203,"Great food, pity about the 'service'","Myself and friends treated ourselves to Afternoon Tea to celebrate Christmas. We booked The Westbury Afternoon Tea, ‚Ç¨45 per person. The presentation of our table, the delph, the cutlery, all were lovely and the food was great, really fresh and well selected plus they cater for vegetarians. Here is the not so nice part....we were asked 5 times by the same waitress if she could get us anything else, listing in the same order, 'tea, coffee, cappuchino, hot chocolate'. To say this was interruptive and annoying when we had already said we were ok is an understatement. However, we had to ask for water 4 times before it came. It seems that if you are spending extra, you will be served but ask for a drink of water and you are literally ignored! My friend also queried something about her food, the waitress just never came back.... I'm getting a little tired of this treatment in Dublin at the moment. Westbury, you need to try harder or train your staff in proper Customer Service.",3,2015,12,20
203,Westbury Hotel,"Stayed one night only , rooms excellent very friendly staff I love when you pool up your helped with your bags and they park your car. 
Breakfast is excellent my friend and I do this every year and do our Christmas shopping the hotel is so comfortable we never have any reason to look else where 
Look forward to next year",5,2015,12,20
203,Disappointing,"I stay in this hotel at least once a year and it usually lives up to its good reputation. Attentive, efficient, pleasant helpful staff , good food and drink, good accommodation and all in pleasant surroundings This year unfortunately this year was really disappointing. 
I arrived into a reception having made my booking on line to be told that i had booked a room only ( I hadn't ) and that if I wanted breakfast I would have to have it in Balfes. (totally missing the point of why I stay in the hotel in the first place) The girl at reception was so busy upselling that she didn't look into the fact that I had said I had booked in room and breakfast . My wife said that breakfast was included as complimentary on the website .I had to go away and look into it so as not to make a scene, it made me feel like a cheapskate pushing for a bargain . That's not what I would expect from the Westbury even if I had made a mistake which I hadn't . When I checked it out and saw I booked everything correctly , the same girl asked for my booking number another opportunity for her to embarrass me . After challenging her she finally said that there was no difference in the price and that breakfast was included ...again missing the point the issue was not price! That sorted I went to the bar we had 4 glasses of wine two each and were charged for the bottle , I let that slide rather than have more hassle and thought it was a genuine mistake. I went out for food and returned back to the bar that evening and ordered Captain Morgans and club orange. I got a drink which wasn't Captain Morgans, so on the next round I specified that I wanted Captain Morgans and to make sure that I got the correct drink . I didn't get it and when i challenged the barman he tried to suggest that it was...then eventually agreed that he had made a mistake he apologised more than once ...but really do you make the same mistake twice after having being corrected.  (He had to leave the bar to get a bottle of Captain Morgans which would make me doubt the mistake)  While I was in the bar one customer had to return his food because it wasn't cooked through, he eventually left because the replacement food took too long. Another man had drink spilt all over his clothes ..this is not the Westbury that I am familiar with.Oh and when I went for food lunch in Balfes i asked for a steak sandwich ...I was told they had no steak ...so not the greatest of breaks for sure. Oh and the password for the free wifi didn't work on either my phone or my wifes. I think there is a training issue here which will no doubt be costly I use the hotel a lot for business meetings during the day my recent experience has tarnished my view of the hotel.",3,2015,12,19
203,Fantastic ,Best location for a leisure stay and lovely hotel would return. As the hotel is at the top of grafton street I was able to do my shopping and return to the hotel to drop off then back out. Although not the cheapest hotel in Dublin it is worth that bit more for the level of service and location ,5,2015,12,19
203,Shopping trip,"Very disappointed on arrival to find mini bar had not been refilled and contained an almost empty bottle of wine.  We informed  reception who apologised but the mini bar was not restocked during our stay. We attempted to get a drink in the bar on both nights.  On the first night the bar was full of dirty glasses and the washing did not seem sufficient as we had to return one glass with lipstick stains.  On the second night we were not allowed into the bar because it was being used for a private function. On asking ""is there else in the hotel were we could get a drink"" the hostess replied ""No"".  I did expect to be able to get a drink in a 5* hotel but not on this occasion.",3,2015,12,18
203,"Convenient location, good service, great food","As you'd expect from the Westbury, it delivers across the board.  Don't miss the chance to enjoy tea in the lounge and bar.  The pavlova is heavenly.  Loved the gin cocktail menu, too.  Prices are elevated, but no more so than you'd expect from a city hotel of this caliber.",4,2015,12,18
203,Fantastic location,"Luxury hotel in the center of everything.
It located at the center of city center.

You will like the food and the service its excellent.

You have everything near you specially shopping and pop's.
 
The problem is rooms  have not good view.",4,2015,12,18
203,Amazing experience!,"We brought my sister for afternoon tea in the westbury for her birthday and had the most amazing day. It was our first time having afternoon tea and it did not disappoint. The food was beautiful but most of all the staff were so lovely and helpful. We were looked after by our lovely waiter Tin, who really made our day. He was so attentive and helpful. I cannot recommend afternoon tea at the Westbury enough it's defiantly a must if your staying in Dublin.",5,2015,12,17
203,Wonderful stay and Celebration,We stayed here and had two superior rooms over two nights in order to celebrate our son's 18th Birthday. The hotel is beautiful and perfectly situated directly off Grafton Street. The rooms were lovely and spacious. Everyone treated us like royalty from checking in to greeting us at the door. Our breakfasts were delicious with a wide range of choice and we had the Festive Afternoon tea too which was incredible. Thank you to everyone concerned in making it a stay to truly remember. we hope to return one day as Dublin itself is a wonderful and welcoming city.,5,2015,12,16
203,Really great experience,"From the moment we arrived last Saturday, things couldn't have been better. Such a  warm welcome at Reception and friendly staff throughout, they really are a class above other 5* hotels in the capital !!

Even the queue for breakfast the next morning was handling extremely well, despite the majority of hotel guests arriving for breakfast at 10.30!!!

Well done to the General Manager and his staff. We will definitely be back.",5,2015,12,16

Pubs all full of young people having fun . Westbury mixed age, perfect!",5,2015,12,15
203,Overrated ,"Perhaps the worst five star I've ever stayed at. The gym is a joke rooms small. Lobby has no place to sit unless you purchase something b
Common areas nice but unlike other hotels being a guest does not guarantee access to them 
It does have a great location and friendly helpful staff",2,2015,12,15
203,"Great location, good service","The Westbury is in a great location and all the must-see sights, within easy walking distance. A taxi from the airport to the hotel will cost around 25-30 euros. 
Service at the hotel was friendly and efficient. Bar and restaurant prices were as you'd expect for a superior establishment. I loved the gin cocktail menu.
We had a twin room, and it was adequate and comfortable. 
The only minus being that for the three days we were there, the third floor, where our room was located, was full of housekeeping carts throughout the day and night, making it look untidy.",4,2015,12,15
203,Afternoon Tea,"My partner and I visited The Westbury for Afternoon Tea, we didn't book and so just turned up. 

We wandered upstairs and over to the dining area, unfortunately we were told that they were fully booked, BUT we could still have afternoon tea in the restaurant. 

We were taken to the restaurant, which was new and were catering for the over flow for Afternoon Tea. We had a lovely table by the window and thoroughly enjoyed the tea and with a pleasant service.",5,2015,12,14
203,Dealt with problem well,"The staff member who dealt with the noise problem from another room was excellent.
The hotel was going through problems with renovation of restaurant and breakfast was not as comfortable as usual.
I understand the new restaurant is now open.
Not as good as last year but i'm sure this was just bad luck",4,2015,12,14
203,Amazing,Stayed here recently with my daughter sister and 2 nieces has to be the best hotel I have every stayed in staff are all fantastic hotel is spotless clean would highly recommend it friendly relaxed atmosphere sand right in the middle of grafton street so handy for shopping and 5 mins from the luas line to dundrum,5,2015,12,12

203,Thanks a million Westbury,Chose Dublin and the Westbury Hotel for our 40th wedding celebration. From the doorman on arriving to leaving  this trip has left us with happy memories. On learning of the reason of visit Paul Gaynor front officer manager and all his staff went that wee bit extra to make it special. Cannot fault hotel in any way from our suite to breakfast to afternoon tea the service was exceptional. Thank you Westbury and all staff to making our visit to Dublin something my wife and I will remember with fond memories and we would highly  recommend the Westbury to anyone who likes that feeling of being a special guest,5,2015,12,09
203,Xmas in Westbury,"We really love this hotel.  Our first time to stay at xmas time as it was my husbands birthday.  From the moment we arrived we felt very welcome.  Hotel was decorated with lovely xmas tree in foyer, would make a great photo for an xmas card!
Derek chief car park attendant was great and a lovely person.  He took all shopping, suitcase etc and placed everything in our car.  He parked car when we arrived outside and brought it back when we were leaving a great service.
Next time we hope to stay longer as one night not enough!",5,2015,12,08
203,5 Stars All The Way!,"Perfectly 5 Stars, not over the top, not stiff, not uncomfortable.
Perfect location in main shopping area and a short walk from Temple Street Area.
Very professional, friendly, knowledgable and humble staff.
Great service everywhere.
5-star rooms and facilities.

Will be back for a long stay.",5,2015,12,07
203,"Lesson Learned - if you have a problem, give them a chance to fix it.","I have stayed here five times in the last year and half. Obviously I love it.  When I arrived this time - tired from a lot of travel  - I was disappointed because the main restaurant was being renovated.   I typically get breakfast there.  Not a big deal, but I like their breakfast.  I was tired and disappointed so I began to look for other problems.  You can always find problems.  Fortunately, Rory the Front of the House Manager asked me about my stay.  He listened to my minor complaints and apologized and I felt better.  I also started to look for things I liked - there are plenty - comfortable, clean rooms, a friendly, helpful staff, great food, fantastic location. 

Lesson learned - give them a chance to provide hospitality - you will be happy you did.",4,2015,12,07
203,Exceptional!,Our stay couldn't have been more enjoyable.  We picked a 5 star Hotel for a reason and they more than lived up to it.  It was the best location.  Great rooms.  Staff - EXCEPTIONAL!  Couldn't do enough for us.  Joseph Downing the Guest Relations Manager is superb!  The staff in the Belfres restaurant went out of their way to know how long our stay was and what we liked.  Not to mention the food and drinks in Belfres were excellent!.  The Door men were great too.  Getting our car was always quick and never complicated.   If we were to go back to Dublin theres only one place we would stay and that's the Westbury. ,5,2015,12,07
203,Afternoon Tea at the Westbury,"Afternoon tea was had here during a most miserable and wet afternoon in Dublin. The pastries, sandwiches and scones were of a very high standard but the teas stole the show ‚Äì between us we had 4 teas, Darjeeling, Earl Grey, wonderful peppermint and astonishing Tangy Lemon. A very relaxing and comfortable way, and place, to escape the vagaries of the Dublin December weather",5,2015,12,06
203,Luxury at its best,"We stayed three nights at The Westbury Hotel in Dublin.  From the time the bellman took our luggage at check in until the time he loaded them in a taxi when we checked out, our stay was outstanding.  The location is perfect for Dublin.  We were upgraded to a suite with our American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts booking.  Our suite was very nice and comfortable.  We ate breakfast every morning at the hotel and its was delicious.  We had dinner one night in the hotel which was very nice and very good  Every afternoon we had drinks in the bar with appetizers.  The staff was overly friendly and helpful in all our request.  Overall a great stay at The Westbury  Hotel in Dublin.",5,2015,12,05
203,Simply the best in Dublin,"I have stayed at the Westbury many times over the years but only came to really appreciate it when I was forced to stay at another property for the last several visits to Dublin due to my company's global vendor policy.  Hands down, the Westbury wins for elegance, charm, service and amenities",5,2015,12,03
203,Luxury I could get used to!,"We spent a lovely girls' weekend here in October and felt pampered throughout. Rooms were beautifully furnished with loads of extras such as bath robes, quality toiletries and a nespresso machine. We ate in the bistro one evening and through the it was good value for money. The location is fantastic allowing very easy access to shops, restaurants etc. Loved the service at Brown Thomas who delivered our shopping bags back to the Westbury where staff had left them up in our rooms! Very impressive! The staff are wonderful, friendly and attentive. Can't wait to return",5,2015,12,02
203,Afternoon tea delight ,"First time having afternoon tea (anywhere) and I must admit it was a great experience. 
Friday the 27/11/15 myself and the hubby called into The Westbury after a long day of shopping . Naturally we were exhausted  but found almost an oasis of relaxation SO CLOSE to grafton st.
We had no booking , but we're seen to a table within a few minutes of entering . 
We must admit the experience was made special by the young man who looked after us. Shane( a young man from castleknock,  as he told us )  brought us out our afternoon tea , before explaining to us what lay before us very well.
Shane was hassled into taking our photos and then offered us a complimentary replenishment of our tea/coffees.
He seemed to genuinely be enjoying his work and seemed very attentive. 
overall ' my first afternoon tea was a very relaxing , amazing experience. 
We will be back x",5,2015,12,01
203,Overnight stay at westbury,we loved our stay at the westbury.  The concierge were so helpful on arrival and this was followed by a warm welcome at reception.  Lovely atmosphere In the hotel.  We were in Dublin to shop on Grafton St and the location of the westbury was so convenient.  Our room was lovely.  All the staff were friendly and more than helpful.  Breakfast was superb!  We really enjoyed our night at the westbury and will definitely be returning in the new year.,5,2015,11,30
203,Great central location for Dublin,My friend and I recently spent 4 days in Dublin.  The Westbury Hotel is situated nicely just off Grafton St.  The hotel staff and comfortable room made for a pleasant stay.  Great options for dining too.,5,2015,11,30
203,Afternoon Tea,"Brought my 90 year old Mum for afternoon Tea as an early Christmas gift. Staff superb-from doorman who got the lift, to girls serving tea. Service excellent and lovely and warm for mum. Fare excellent as ever. Well worth the cost for the experience!! Thank you Westbury.",5,2015,11,27
203,Simply Perfect in Every Way,"I arrived to The Westbury quite early in the AM, based on my flight arriving almost 90 minutes early. The front desk could not have been more accommodating. They allowed me to check in early to my room, so I could take a quick nap and feel refreshed. The staff, and concierge (Tommy in particular) were outstanding. The room rate included a full Irish hot breakfast, which was delicious!. The location is terrific, right on Grafton Street near all the shopping and restaurants. I plan to return to Dublin and will not go unless I can secure a room at The Westbury! Truly a pleasurable memory made in such an iconic Dublin landmark.  ",5,2015,11,27
203,Fantastic Hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Great Hotel if you are looking for something special. This is on the high-end of expensive but worth it if you have the money. Staff are friendly and efficient. Rooms are excellent and the facilities are quite special.

You are made very welcome by all. We had breakfast on one day and that was well presented an servers in the lobby/lounge area. We went to the restaurant Balfes on the ground floor and the waiter was excellent, he knew his G&T's.... Overall a great experience and a lovely hotel, but quite expensive. Be prepared.... ",5,2015,11,27
203,Heaven!,"Thoroughly enjoyed our recent overnight stay.  Pure luxury and staff were so kind and helpful. We will definitely be back - it is well worth it.  A definite treat.  Central location - everything was superb.

Lovely stay and would deffinatley return. 
",5,2015,11,25
203,Over night stay,"This hotel is an iconic Dublin landmark but that's about it. The lobby is great and the location but the rooms are terrible. They are old, carpet needs changing, woodwork is from the last century by the looks of it. There are far less expensive hotels in Dublin with far superior rooms. The hotel clearly has only location going for it. The rooms are too small and very dated. They are in need of an extreme revamp. 
      
      ",3,2015,11,25
203,Luxury,"Fab hotel, on a great location. Everything from the moment you pull the car to the door on arrival until your departure is looked after so well. There is nothing I would change! It was our second time staying and we will be back.",5,2015,11,24
203,Very expensive for what was on offer,"I attended a wedding, there were mishaps during the evening which should not have happened for a five star hotel.  The room was called SUPERIOR and I would call it ADEQUATE.  Breakfast service was appaling.",2,2015,11,23
203,Absolutely Beautiful.,"This Hotel is very well known and rightly so, the atmosphere when you walk through the door is great. The staff are very friendly, courteous and helpful. 

The rooms are absolutely gorgeous with very comfortable beds and are very well furnished. They come with bathrobes and slippers, free wifi, great bathroom amenities, a large TV and a nespresso machine. 

What more could you ask for? 

The breakfasts are very tasty. Although, a latte will hit you with a ‚Ç¨4 price tag but they're delicious. 

Overall, great hotel!",5,2015,11,22
203,Afternoon Tea at The Westbury,"We visited the Westbury for afternoon tea and just loved the whole experience , the environment was beautiful ,the food delicious and the staff were lovely . Our waitress  took customer care to a whole new dimension when we carelessly left a mobile phone on the table she chased after us to Grafton St. to return it . Very much appreciated indeed. It was a really special afternoon and a wonderful treat . Strongly recommend this for an oasis of calm and a spot of decadence during a shopping trip !!",5,2015,11,22
203,Wonderful Hotel!,"I loved my visit to Dublin and wished I had a longer stay at the Westbury. It's a beautiful hotel, centrally located. The room was wonderful, good lighting, great large bathtub, nice common areas. I got a really good rate on my room including breakfast. However, if I didn't have the breakfast included, I would have eaten elsewhere as I thought the breakfast was way too expensive. There's a bistro on the first floor that I really enjoyed for lunch and drinks and would probably do that for breakfast since I'm not much of a buffet person so it's never worth the $35-$45 these hotels charge. And there are plenty of great restaurants serving breakfast in the area too. 

The staff was very friendly and I had a wonderful stay! I can't wait to go back!",5,2015,11,21
203,"Beautiful Lounge, perfect location","I am a frequent visitor to Dublin and have stayed in most of the major hotels but it was my first to stay actually stay in the Westbury. For years I have loved the Westbury because I think it has one of the most comfortable and atmospheric lounges to have a drink/afternoon tea/cocktail in the city centre.

Check in was smooth and friendly. Our room was very comfortable and clean, possibly starting to become ever so slightly worn in certain areas (bathroom obviously has had a few layers of touch ups over the years) but it was never the less extremely clean.

Certainly this is a fantastic location and the hotel did not disappoint, I will look forward to returning soon to soak up the comfortable welcoming atmosphere at Christmas!",5,2015,11,20
203,Excellent Experience,I spent a week at the Westbury and loved everything about my stay.  The facility was exceptional and the staff was wonderful.  We used Dublin as our home base and traveled from there each day to explore Ireland.  It was a great way to see the area and the Westbury was a home away from home.,5,2015,11,17
203,amazing afternoon tea,"What an experience!Afternoon tea at its best.Throughly enjoyed this experience.No other hotel does it as good as the Westbury.On entering the hotel it was awesome. Beautiful and delicate decor.Really posh but yet gives one the feeling of  belonging.Staff were friendly and very helpful.Great choice on menu.We had tea served in an elegant silver pot with all the trimmings.Sandwiches,scones and the most unique array of delicious cakes imaginable.Perfect spot for a special meeting or ron de vu.Thank you for this lovely experience.Will most definitely be back soon.",5,2015,11,17
203,ABSOLUTELY FIRST CLASS,Ideally situated hotel in central Dublin. Beautifully appointed hotel with plenty of excellent staff. Nothing too much trouble. Continental breakfast very good value @ 15 euro. Pre theatre dinner was delicious. Can highly recommend for city break.,5,2015,11,17
203,Up there with the very best....,"From the minute you arrive the service is fantastic. Every single member of staff is attentive and pleasant. From the flower arrangements to the decor & rooms, everything is just luxurious.
The food was all spot on. I highly recommend this hotel. Location is perfect. Will be trying other hotels in this group and hoping they are up to the same standard.
The Christmas decorations are very tasteful too.",5,2015,11,17
203,An exceptional stay,"I've travelled to Dublin twice for business now, and was pleased to stay at the Westbury for this most recent trip. I had heard wonderful things about the hotel from business colleagues, and everything they said was true. The hotel is possibly the best hotel I've ever stayed at. Looking for anything to complain about in this review would be picking nits for the mere reason of trying. There was truly nothing about this stay that I could find to complain about. I will happily stay here on all my future trips - business and pleasure.",5,2015,11,16
203,Disappointing wedding experience.,"To anyone who has booked or is considering booking a wedding for the Westbury hotel may wish to reconsider. 

Firstly, the bar staff were inexperienced, but their effort was top notch. They consistently ran out of drinks and were having to run between different bars in order to have enough supply - something that senior staff should have noticed in advance.

Secondly the waiting staff completely forgot about vegetarian meals. There were two vegetarians sitting at my table. Myself and the other non-vegetarians were finished our meal by the time they got served. The waiter when asked about where the meal was consistently said ""it's on the way"". I would not call a 25 minute wait ""on the way"".

Thirdly the candles, which were placed in a stand in the centre of the table, were dripping wax down onto our table. At one stage wax dripped into my dad's glass of wine, and I'm sure he wasn't the only guest there that something like this happened to. Not one member of staff noticed or seemed to pay attention to it despite guests reporting it. The height of rudeness from the staff here.

Fourthly the cocktails were absolutely disgraceful. My dad had ordered two mojitos for my mother and sister. He nor I didn't think they were made to a good standard but gave them to my mother and sister to taste, just in case. They were revolting. He brought them back to a member of the bar-staff to which he/she agreed they were not made to a satisfactory level. My father had paid with cash but to make it easier for the bar member he said just credit the cost to his hotel room. Upon checking out the next morning we noticed that the bar member had never credited the charge to the room. When telling the ostentatious receptionist the story of what had happened, that member of staff did not believe us as it was not in the ""Westbury's policy"" to refund a cash transaction by crediting the charge to the room. 
I assume it is also not part of this so-called ""policy"" to have customers waiting for meals, rude and ostentatious staff, extortionate prices, revolting Guinness.. I really could go on and on.

All in all, my experience at the Westbury was dire. If Tripadvisor allowed me to award 0 stars for this review I would.

I would like to end on a positive note though and since I do have to award a star for this review that star goes to the young members of the bar staff. They were inexperienced but that is not their fault. Yes, they made mistakes but there was no manager in sight to help them. They gave 100% of their effort to satisfy customer's needs and they are a credit to Westbury. The rest of the staff that I dealt with during the weekend could definitely learn from them.",1,2015,11,16
203,Enjoyable night in Dublin ... January 15,"This hotel is ideal for a stay in Dublin.. It is in a perfect position for shopping on Grafton Street... We stayed part business and part January sales... It was awful weather but felt completely at home once we had arrived.. warm, cosy.. lovely tasty food although we only had a snack and breakfast here due to short length of stay .. Perfect for sightseeing of local attractions ... near theatres also ... great location ...",4,2015,11,14
203,Fabulous afternoon tea experience,This  truly was a five star experience. The staff were very friendly and attentive. The afternoon tea  cakes and savouries were delicious and very fresh. The atmosphere was cosy and the table was beautiful laid. Every detail was attended to. Will definitely be back.,5,2015,11,13
203,Omg!! Amazing!!! ,"Wow is all I can say! Stunning hotel. Amazing breakfasts, doormen, great lounge!!
We loved staying here. We only ate breakfasts in the hotel. Delish!! Black pudding, sausages, and the eggs are to die for! Plain sunny side up and you could lick the plate! The hotel is in the heart of all the shopping etc. At night if you walk around at night, there are homeless teenagers walking. Around a couple blocks from the hotel but you could literally just go to the pub right outside the hotel and not have them accost you. I found them to be quite harassing. But they are a few blocks away. Apparently celebrities and famous rugby players stay at this hotel. ",5,2015,11,11
203,Wonderful Night in Dublin,"My husband and I stayed here our first night in Ireland. It was so elegant and richly appointed. The location is perfect for a short stay. We were able check in at 9am after a long overnight flight, eat breakfast and sight see. Definitely worth it!!!",5,2015,11,11
203,Not a true Luxury hotel,"The best thing about this property is location - fabulous. The staff were pleasant. My room needed some touch up - woodwork chipped and scratched, paint peeling in some spots.  Breakfast room was packed and staff had trouble keeping it picked up and tables cleared. Dislike the design of the property, public space seemed very dated to me. I was here for 2 nights because the Merrion was sold out. Very glad to transfer back to that hotel for my last 3 nights in Dublin. Comparing the two - the Westbury is a 4 star and the Merrion true luxury at 5 stars.",3,2015,11,11
203,Fabulous!,Stay two nights in November and had a great stay.  Staff really friendly and breakfast excellent.  Great location situated just off the main shopping area off Grafton Street but set back from the road so you can get a good night's sleep,5,2015,11,11
203,Luxury,"We spent one night in The Westbury, what an amazing experience, the hotel is located off Grafton Street, very luxurious hotel and every amenity you can think of to hand. A real treat for that special occasion.",5,2015,11,10
203,Wow,"The Westbury has to be the best hotel I have stayed in by far. Every element of the hotel is elegant and beautiful, and the staff friendly and professional. The rooms were homely and the beds big and comfy. I had a luxurious nights sleep every night and woke up to a tasty continental breakfast. The location is perfect as well, right in the heart of the city with plenty of cosy Irish pubs around. You get what you pay for when staying at the Westbury. Will definitely be returning soon.",5,2015,11,10
203,Simply delightful,"I visited here in November 2014. Everything from the moment you step foot in the Westbury just exudes splendour and quality. The staff are polite, friendly and professional. The rooms are clean, stylishly decorated and grand. The nespresso coffee was the perfect way to start every morning, the bathroom facilities were perfectly acceptable, if not a little dated, but the bed one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in.
The location of the hotel is great, with everything within walking distance, especially if shopping is high on the agenda.
Definitely a must if you're looking for a place to stay in Dublin, as long as you aren't on a budget.",5,2015,11,10
203,Great spot for afternoon tea,"A little spot of calm just of Grafton Street - we popped in for afternoon tea. Very nice. Excellent service, very comfortable and reasonably priced given how expensive the hotel is. Try the spiced Gin and tonic too.",5,2015,11,08
203,"Luxury, luxury, luxury",High end luxurious hotel.  Suites are very spacious and have very good quality linen and amenities.  Well situated just off one of the main shopping walk ways in Dublin and within walking distance of Temple Bar area and other sights.  Certainly priced accordingly but worth returning to in future.,4,2015,11,08
203,The chocolates. The afternoon tea. The elegant comfort.,"I'm fortunately that when I travel for business to Dublin, I'm allowed to stay here. I'm afraid I've become completely addicted to the kind people and wonderful service. The rooms are quite nice with wonderful bedding. The bathing facilities remind me I'm in Europe (no full tub) while still making feel pampered and relaxed. And the night turn-down service with a chocolate on the pillow -- if only I could get that at home!

Every problem I have ever reported has been handled gracefully and professionally. (For whatever reason, I keep leaving things that they have to mail to me -- subconscious desire to return?) The hallways can get a bit noisy nearer the elevators but that's true of so many hotels. What amazes me is that even though I'm not there frequently (maybe twice per year), several of the staff remember me and are happy to chat. And even the staff that has no clue who I'm smile and are always so good at making me feel welcomed.

The location in wonderful -- though plan on taking a taxi to bring you with your bags. The hotel dining is good for lunch or dinner. It is wonderful for an evening drink -- partially once I learned I could get two small scones just to finish my nibbling for the day. The ""lite"" breakfast is plain and good; the buffet breakfasts are fabulous (and I fear fattening).

Treat yourself! Enjoy. Work with the staff if you run into any problems and I'm sure you'll have a delightful time.",5,2015,11,07
203,Brilliant city centre luxury hotel,"Helpful, friendly staff, superior double room with two firm, roomy queen beds; walk in wardrobe; great shower in large bathroom with everything provided; robes, slippers and chocolates; lightbulb changed and extra tea and milk on request.  Breakfast and afternoon tea a bit pricey but lovely alternatives at the Kilkenny and KCPeaches on Nasau Street. Got the Hop on, hop off bus to several very interesting, historical sites. Close to shops and lots of cafes and restaurants.",5,2015,11,07
203,"Good hotel , great location","I recently stayed at this hotel on my last night in Ireland. I chose the hotel primarily for its location as we only had limited time in Dublin. It came down to a choice between The Merrion and The Westbury . I knew people who had stayed at both , but went with The Westbury because of location. Overall , I would say that I was a bit disappointed in the hotel which seemed a bit ""tired "". The room was perfectly adequate , ready when we arrived , extremely clean , but there was an underlying feeling that the hotel and rooms needed an update . earlier in the week  , I stayed at the River Lee Hotel in Cork , which is part of the same hotel  chain , and that hotel had a much better feel. That said , the service was great and we spent very little time in the room - we arrived at lunchtime and left after breakfast the next morning. If you had limited time , I would recommend this hotel as it is close to everything . Would I stay there again - if I had limited time undoubtedly yes. Special mention to the concierges who were extremely helpful.",4,2015,11,05
203,Probably the best Dublin has to offer,"If your looking for delightful excellence in Dublin, look no further.  There may be a better hotel in Dublin (I haven't stayed in all of them), but it's hard to see how.  A little expensive on the weekends, but if your looking to treat your significant other to a little luxury in Dublin, you can't do better.  The location is unbeatable.  It's located a half block from the best shopping in Dublin, a few blocks from Trinity College, the literary pub crawl, the national museums...everything.   My only fault was that the concierge couldn't figure out how to buy tickets to the Book of Kells online (Ticketmaster), which should have been in his skill set.  The restaurant was excellent and actually reasonable for breakfast for what you get.  Just a lovely weekend.",5,2015,11,04
203,Perfect place,"In the heart of Grafton street, this little gem of a hotel holds its subtle spot. I have stayed on 3 separate occasions now and I love it! It's a trendy hotel in the middle of all the hustle and bustle and somehow it's quiet and comfortable. The bar is charming and great for a coffee and hot chocolate! Great place to stay during winter! ",5,2015,11,04
203,Wonderful Westbury,"After a trip hiking through the Scottish Highlands staying ""rustic"" accommodations we were in heaven when we hit our beds in the Westbury. The staff were beyond helpful, our concierge, Eddy, was the best. I would stay there again just because of his level of helpfulness and friendly professionalism. Can't wait to stay again!",5,2015,11,04
203,Birthday Weekend Delight at the Westbury on Grafton Street!,"What does every woman want for her birthday?  Shop til she drops then a short stroll to her hotel where she can bathe is luxury, relax in a thick towelling robe until it's time for birthday dinner.  Well let me assure you that The Westbury hotel looks after all these desires and more.  My daughter and I stayed here for a weekend treat for my birthday.  There was a delay checking in so I was treated to a  delicious hot chocolate (or any complimentary beverage of my choice while I waited).  Our room was large with luxurious bed linen, duvets & a pillow menu.  I had bad car accident a number of years ago & need a very low pillow. A hotel accommodation assistant arrived with a variety of pillows and I choose all of them with no hassle at all.  My daughter arranged a birthday 'plate' surprise and this was waiting for me on my arrival.  The towels, robes, slippers & toiletries were deluxe.  The 'ionic' hairdryer left our tresses silky & smooth.  The breakfast was simply amazing.  Anything you can think of was available.  There is a price to pay for luxury but there was nothing left to chance.  The staff and management here are on duty 24/7 and their goal is to keep all their guests happy.  We had a wonderful  break and marvellous weekend and I would recommend this hotel to anyone who has a 'special' occasion on the calendar because I certainly felt 'special' on my visit to The Westbury for my birthday.  Thank you one and all and especially Joss with his lovely smile.",5,2015,11,02
203,Wonderful! A wonderful place to stay!,"Service was exceptional and the food exquisite. I've travelled all over, but I've never received finer treatment or a better breakfast. Located right on Grafton St this is the place to be, a pedestrian district with shopping, food, and entertainment just a few blocks away. Only downside is it is difficult to navigate the streets of Dublin to get to it. I would definitely stay here again (and again and again).",5,2015,11,02
203,Overnight stay treat,"One of my best friends treated me to an overnight stay at The Westbury. This hotel is so relaxing. We had afternoon tea and cocktails upstairs and then headed out for dinner at a nearby restaurant. The hotel is located right in the heart of Dublin's buzzing city. Just a stones throw from Grafton St. The bedroom was very comfortable with a lovely big bed. The staff were very nice, although the doorman was a little dubious of letting us back in come the wee small hours of the following morning but once we presented our hotel keys he laughed.",5,2015,11,02
203,If you like the Best...,"We could not have been any happier with our hotel location! The Westbury is right behind Grafton St. and very centrally located in Dublin. The hotel, itself, is beautifully decorated and very clean. It has a newer, more modern feel than a lot of the other hotels. The front desk and concierge were very polite and helpful. Our room was clean and spacious with a very comfortable bed. 
I do want to note that it is hard to access with all the construction on the streets. Our driver wasn't familiar with the area and we were in the car an extra 45mins until he flagged down a taxi driver for help. 
By the way, any time we told locals where we were staying it was a very positive response we got. :)",5,2015,11,01
203,How do they do it?,"My wife and I have just spent 4 great days visiting Dublin. Even in late October, the weather was dry and warm! The city is undergoing much road renovation, we assume in preparation for the centenary of the Easter 1916 uprising.

What made the visit special was the choice of hotel. The Westbury Hotel, has the very best location in the city, you are never more than 10 minutes walk from any major site of interest.

The property lives up to its 5 star rating, the property exudes luxury, but in a comfortable easy environment. The staff, whether front desk, concierges, housekeeping, and food service, are one of the very best we have ever experienced. At least as good as the famed Four Seasons hotels.

Bedrooms and bathrooms are fully stocked and immaculately cleaned. The only point of comment is that the Nespresso machine could have been replace, it was 'tired'.

We look forward to our return. I agree with others, that a front facing room, on an upper floor is the one of choice.

Well done boys and girls of The Westbury, and the management that makes it happen.",5,2015,11,01
203,Amazing,"We stayed in the hotel for a team building exercise through work & received a free room upgrade which was amazing, the room was clean & welcoming and big!!! Breakfast was fantastic and the staff were very friendly and polite. I would recommend this hotel to all! ",5,2015,11,01
203,fabulous,This Hotel is absolutely fabulous.  The rooms are wonderful and spacious.  The staff are very nice and helpful.  The location is excellent for waling to Grafton Street shopping and many sights.  We had a wonderful time.,5,2015,10,31
203,Awesome in the Heart of Dublin,Great Hotel; convenient access to Grafton Street and local attractions.  Staff and amenities well beyond satisfactory!  The Gallery was a great place to end any day's adventure with a beverage and a bite.,5,2015,10,31
203,True 5 Star Hotel,This hotel has an excellent location in the center of the city of Dublin. It is very accessible to the local sites as well as to shopping (right off the main shopping street). The hotel staff is very friendly and goes out of their way to make sure everything meets your expectations. The rooms are very comfortable as well. Best hotel in Dublin as far as 5 star is concerned.,5,2015,10,30
203,Lovely hotel,"Rooms were lovely, atmosphere calming. Right in the hustle and bustle of Grafton Street area, so close to all the excitement, but quiet and calming inside the hotel. 
Sit at the bar for a drink- the staff are incredible! We had several charming evenings just talking to the staff, and Micheal, the head of the bar area, has a gift for fabulous cocktails! 
The staff at this hotel always seemed to be ready to help, and gracious about anything we could need. The concierge, the housekeeping, the servers, were all top notch.Lovely stay.",5,2015,10,29
203,Another great weekend at the Westbury,"We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night. Dinner at the Trocadero on Fri and a concert on the Sat night were the reason for the visit but as usual with the Westbury the hotel becomes the main reason for the visit and the rest become the excuse for going there!
Everything just feels comfortable, the service is consistently good, the location cannot be beaten and the breakfast remains the best hotel breakfast I have had, anywhere!
",5,2015,10,29
203,It doesn't get better for comfort and location,"My wife and I had business in London and then Belfast so we decided to extend our stay to include a 3 day weekend in Dublin. We travel extensively throughout Europe but this was our first experience with Dublin. As always, I first look at the Silver Amex site to book a hotel and the Westbury caught my interest of the three hotels recommended. The location, lobby and room image looked quit
inviting so I booked a junior suite.
When in London for business, we stay at the Marleybone Hotel as our company office is in that neighborhood. We are treated very special there and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that both hotels were part of the Doyle Collection.
Upon check in we were totally impressed and felt very comfortable with the hotel lobby. I immediately knew this was the right hotel to stay when in Dublin. We were able to get the Amex upgrade to a suite and again, immediately felt comfortable. The room was clean and perfectly appointed with great taste.
But the best experience we had was with lobby staff (especially the concierge
 staff). I knew it was going to be a busy weekend in Dublin and called ahead to get help with dinner reservations. Ashley immediately knew what I was looking for and personally called me back to let me know where and when he had made dinner reservations. All were perfect for what we were looking for.That is good service. 
What more could be said for ""Tea"" in the hotel lobby. The hotel wait staff are  beyond friendly and professional.
Additionally, unbeknown to us, our Irish business college was a friend of Vincent, the hotel manager and we were pleasantly greeted with a bottle of Champagne and food goodies that just completed the special feeling of the hotel.   

",5,2015,10,28
203,A great Place to Stay,"This is a true 5-star.  The lobby/lounge is great, the breakfast solid and the neighborhood the best.  They offer tea, which we didn't do, but looked nice.  Service is excellent and the concierges are very knowledgeable.  You just can't go wrong.",5,2015,10,27
203,Location Location Location,"Loved this hotel! Beautiful rooms, great service, and the best location! It is right of Grafton Street which is in perfect proximity to everything.  I would highly recommend as a splurge hotel on your vacation to Ireland!",5,2015,10,27
203,Average - At Best,"Stayed here for four nights over the October bank holiday weekend.  I had booked it months in advance, a ""superior room, with king-size bed""

I would say their standards have finally sunk about as low as the Conrad on the other side of Stephen's green.  It was the weekend of the Dublin Marathon, so perhaps they were overwhelmed with high-occupancy levels over an otherwise off-season weekend, but to say they are off their game is an understatement.

We were given a room, 229, opposite the lifts.  It had an occupied adjoining room where we could hear our neighbours' phone calls in intimate detail.

The room itself is rather small - I wonder what standard size is to the Doyle group.  The fittings in the bathroom had worn from their housing, so the sink area was constantly awash, consequently the floor also.  

Their staff, while mostly pleasant, have a defensive ""its not my fault, I don't set the policy"" dismissive learned off by rote.  Woe betide the paying traveller who raises an issue with them.  

We left with the distinct impression that ""caveat emptor"" is the new policy they are referring to.

Won't go back.",3,2015,10,27
203,wonderful hotel,"a wonderful place to stay while visiting the city , the room was absolutelly fantastic , everything looks good and spotless, you will feel like a king in this hotel!!
it's been a pleasant holiday , thank you very much to everybody",5,2015,10,27
203,"Very smart, very comfortable","The Westbury has a great location, just off Grafton Street, two minutes from the beautiful Brown Thomas store and other central sights and shops. It is a confident, smart hotel, with good service, nice rooms, comfortable beds. I've stayed when I have had breakfast in the main restaurant of the hotel and that was super; I have also stayed and been directed to the adjacent brasserie restaurant for breakfast, which feels for less special. The lounge area near the hotel reception desk is large and feels a little impersonal for it. The bar food available here is fine; quite expensive for a snack or sandwich, but perfectly nice. There are plenty of restaurants nearby.",4,2015,10,27
203,Weekend at the Westbury,"Beautiful hotel, smiling friendly staff - so helpful, excellent rooms, comfortable beds. Went the extra mile for us when had a problem with tickets for a show in Dublin.  A lovely sense of calm about the hotel for a hotel in the city center.",5,2015,10,27
203,Extremely nice!,"The food, staff, and rooms were wonderful! The staff really seemed to care about our experience and did everything they could to make us as comfortable as possible- they even brought us better pillows when we asked! They made sure we had our complimentary water every night and would check in every day to see if there was anything else they could do. It is a bit pricey, but well worth it, plus the location is fantastic in the shopping center of Dublin. I would absolutely come back and stay here again.",5,2015,10,27
203,Wonderful Hotel - Always enjoy my stays!,"The Westbury is always a joy to stay at.  The service is wonderful from the doorman, front desk, the bar, and room service.  This trip I was especially pleased by the delightful room service delivery - I had a late dinner and the gentleman who delivered the food was nice to chat with.",5,2015,10,26
203,Superb Again.,"Stayed in this great hotel in July for two nights and had to do a review as I thought the place was excellent. Stayed again 20th Sept and it was once again an absolute pleasure to stay here. The staff make the stay a pleasure as they are very friendly and again Derek the Concierage was as helpful and friendly as my last stay. Looking forward to March for another stay, well done again.",5,2015,10,26
203,Luxury and location!,Beautiful hotel in a great location.  Rooms are clean and well appointed.  We had breakfast included in our rate and it was a perfect relaxing way to start each day.  There's a lovely little bar on the first floor with outdoor seating that was the perfect place to have a drink before heading out to dinner or before going to bed.  We loved staying here and recommend The Westbury to anyone visiting Dublin.,5,2015,10,26
203,Fabulous Location and Wonderful Customer Service,"Had a wonderful stay recently at the Westbury and the staff here were part of the reason why.  Andrea and Julia from housekeeping were great---Andrea dropped what she was doing to get another room cleaned quickly as the room we were initially given had a loud, thudding noise coming from the roof making it impossible for us to stay in.  She saw the difficulty we were having and tried on her own to get the head of housekeeping to okay her cleaning a similar room so we could finally get some much needed sleep.  That was above and beyond and was very much appreciated by us as it was 3:30pm and we were exhausted after having been up all night on the transatlantic flight.  Eddie was an outstanding concierge who brought our bags to the initial room and, when he heard the noise, said ""You can't stay here---that noise will make you crazy""!!  He could see how tired we were and set about getting an alternate accommodation. Lucas and Paul at the concierge desk were great as well.  And we must mention Joseph Downing, Guest Relations Manager.  This man was our hero and accommodated needs before we even knew we had them.  He really was one of the best managers we have ever encountered anywhere---his style, professionalism and courtesy were appreciated and will long be remembered by us.  If you stay at the Westbury and have any concerns, contact this man and you will be taken care of for sure.  The location was fantastic and restaurant recommendations in the area spot on.  The room was a studio suite and gorgeous---spotless with a large, luxurious bathroom.  We switched from the Merrion one week prior to our arrival due to some construction going on next door and were very glad we did.  The breakfasts were lovely and drinks in the bar divine.  I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Dublin and will certainly be back for our next stay.  Thanks to everyone for making our first trip to Dublin so wonderful.",5,2015,10,25
203,Well worth the price and great location,"In July we did a tour of Ireland and The Westbury was our first hotel/ - WOW this is a beautiful hotel, great staff whom were very helpful and helping out of country visitors. Even after staying at 7 hotels, this hotel is the one we would highly recommend.The location was prime spot as it was a close walk to many destinations and a close walk to the on - hop off drop. Quiet hotel and spacious. Many stores, restaurants and pubs outside the hotel.",5,2015,10,24
203,"Great location, very nice hotel","We stayed here three nights to round out of weeklong stay in Ireland. On our first night, we were out in a room on the second floor right outside the elevator. It was so noisy all night and we could barely sleep. The next morning we raised our concerns with the front desk and they moved us to a room on the fourth floor far from the elevator. Was a great (and necessary) change and we appreciate the hotel accommodating us. However, given that so many rooms were empty, I wish we would have started off in a room that wasn't in a sub-optimal location.   Nonetheless, the hotel is clean, upscale and well run and the location cannot be beat. ",4,2015,10,23
203,As close to perfect as possible,"My husband and I travel quite a bit and have had stayed at many luxury hotels, but our recent stay at the Westbury was remarkable.  From the very comfortable beds, to the quiet (despite being smack in the middle of the Grafton Street action!) to the lovely lounge for afternoon tea, we enjoyed every minute.  But most notable was the extraordinary service, especially at the front desk and the bellmen.  So helpful, cheerful, and yet not obsequious.  Just wonderful.",5,2015,10,23
203,Superb,"We stayed here at the start and the end of our trip to Ireland. 

The hotel is hidden in a bit of a maze of one way streets, but is ideally located for exploring Dublin. The entrance is impressive and reception appeared to be staffed by an endless legion of attractive, professional staff.

Rooms are spacious and well stocked with everything you could want, the concierge was helpful, cocktails in the marble bar were  awesome and breakfasts were huge and excellent.

Only two minor gripes. On our first trip we were in a rear facing room (311) which was very stuffy due to the way the air con was installed. On our second trip we were in a front facing room (410) and it had a different configuration which was much better. 

Secondly, we commented after our first trip that we found the turndown service a little intrusive. The hotel apologised and advised us to select the no turndown service when we checked in for our next visit. Which we did. And they still turned up to turn the room down. 

Both minor and neither would stop us from recommending or staying here again.",5,2015,10,23
203,Disappointed,"We stayed at the Westbury on our last night in Ireland, after a 2 1/2 week trip around the island.  The hotel and the staff were great.  Our room was disappointing.  I expected a much nicer room for the price.  The wifi was so bad I couldn't even check in for our flight from my computer.  I had to use my phone to complete check in.  I hate to leave such an average review but if you are expecting a luxurious room you may be disappointed.",3,2015,10,22
203,Location and service made a perfect experience,"I stayed here for a full week and this is one of the best hotels I ever stayed. Very nice structure, location is perfect, staff is brilliant and always happy to help.
I had a problem with wi-fi one night and called the reception. They offered apologies for this and after 5 minutes trying to solve the issue they just offered me a different room ""after they are positively sure that the wi fi was working there"". They eventually upgraded me to a room in a different floor, working wi-fi and called back next morning to check if everything was working properly.
Breakfast and meals are superb!

Pros:
Staff quality and attention to details
Structure
Room

Cons:
Gym is tiny!!!",5,2015,10,22
203,Wonderful service in a perfect location for walking,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Westbury as part of a large group. The hotel is in a terrific location, with great shopping, food, pubs, and theater all within a few blocks. Our room was comfortable and clean (with the best hair dryer I've ever seen in a hotel room). The restaurants had great food with impeccable service. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2015,10,22
203,Excellent,"Amazing location, great staff and a super hotel. If you're looking for the best spot to stay that's convienant to all things this would be your place. A really wonderful hotel. Grafton Street at the end of the street and temple bar a quick walk from the front door. üëçüëç",5,2015,10,22
203,Grand finale in Dublin,"We ended our 8 night Ireland vacation with three nights at the Westbury Dublin. I expected the location to be ideal, which it was. I was pleasantly surprised when all other aspects of the hotel were just as fabulous. We ate at every restaurant. The food and service were terrific - good for gluten free also. We were departing the hotel early for a day trip to Northern Ireland and they packed us a continental breakfast to go for each of us - we just asked the night before. The rooms are plush, many with unique street views. They were having a lot of trouble with key cards de-activating when I was there; got in the habit of stopping by the front desk to reactivate BEFORE going to my room.",5,2015,10,21
203,"Pure Class, Loved Every Minute","We booked this hotel for our wedding anniversary August 2015 - travelling from London en route to a family party in Cavan and then visiting family in Glengarriff, West Cork.  We had such an amazing stay!  On arrival we were upgraded to a suite!  Thank you so much!  Not just any suite but the Presidential Suite!!  We thought this sort of thing happened to other people so we were just so happy and delighted.  Our daughters were upgraded also to a deluxe twin.  This hotel oozes charm and class.  It is hidden away in central Dublin behind Brown Thomas and straddling the South William Street area which is alive and kicking with trendy bars and restaurants.  Loved having champagne in the Westbury's Marble Bar and all the staff were delightfully friendly.  The breakfast was a feast in such a beautiful room.  We have stayed at the Shelbourne but the Westbury is up there with the best in Dublin, totally exceeded expectation.  Loved signing for drinks ""pres suite"" ;-) !!  Thank you, thank you, thank you Westbury Dublin for a memory we will savour forever.",5,2015,10,21
203,Unauthorized charge on bill,"Beware of the ""international conversion margin"" they put on your bill without your permission! My husband and I ordered tea and scones in the lobby of The Westbury Hotel on August 22, 2015, while waiting for my in-laws to check in after their flight from the States. The server never bothered to ask my husband whether he wanted to pay in Euros or USD, but automatically processed the amount ($32.61) on our credit card in USD, which incurred an extra 3.5% conversion fee. The wording on the receipt-- ""the cardholder has chosen to pay in USD""-- makes it sound like they actually gave us a choice of whether we wanted to pay in Euros or USD! From what I understand, this fee goes to the merchant for the ""convenience"" of allowing you to pay in your home currency. After this experience, we always insist, without being asked, that we want to pay our credit card in the currency of the country we are visiting. Being generous with two stars because the tea and scones were good.",2,2015,10,21
203,Westbury Hotel quick trip to Dublin,"I was extremely happy with my stay at the Westbury Hotel during my recent trip to Dublin. The hotel is centrally located allowing for easy access to all of the city sights. Hotel staff was very knowledgeable and provided great recommendations. I highly recommend the afternoon tea at the hotel, you will not be disappointed!!!",5,2015,10,21
203,Wonderful stay,"Stayed a total of three nights and loved it. Staff was wonderful, bed was comfortable and room was clean. Loved the turn down service each night and bathroom amenities. The restaurant Balfes was great sat outside under a heater and they provide beautiful blankets for your laps. The best part is their menu is Gluten free which was great for our friends.",5,2015,10,20
203,Good hotel,"Overall good hotel at great location but not living to its reputation 100%

Positives:
-Location
-Clean
-Polite staff
-All necessities in the room
-Great beds and pillows
- Nice toiletries 

Improvements:
- Rooms & bathroom small for price
- Housekeeping goes round rooms at a weird time of the day (6pm?), knocks and comes straight in. I was in the bath while they came in and out. They came yet another time while I was out (8pm). I feel this time is  inappropriate time and violation of privacy
- Too many towels for the sake of the environment",4,2015,10,20
203,Great but could be Greater!,Have stayed at the Westbury on numerous occasions. Great location so much always going on off Grafton Street. Not the best of rooms this time but the greeting from the staff upon arriving and the warmth upon leaving is always that bit special. Had to send my breakfast back because it was lukewarm but didn't ruin my stay and handled very well by staff. Main floor area is just the best in Dublin and just love chilling over a drink late evening when the crowds disappear. Main area can get busy made a mistake a few years ago in booking my staff in for a Christmas meal and stay but we were unable to sit in the lounge which I had boasted to them about so coffee and sandwiches had to be taken in bedroom as packed with seasonal shoppers. ,4,2015,10,18
203,Great Hotel - Problem Resolution at Its Best,"The true mark of excellent service is how a hotel addresses a problem.  The Westbury exceeded expectations in this category.  When we had a problem with our accommodations, the Assistant Guest Relations Manager, Adam Harrington, stepped up.  He not only corrected the situation, he did it in a way that enhanced our stay and made us want to return to the hotel soon.  
The Westbury Hotel, a five star hotel, has a great location and is only steps away from the heart of Dublin and many key tourist sights.  It has several nice restaurants and bars and there are many within a few blocks of the hotel.  The staff is friendly and the service is great.  After our room problem was rectified, the new room was excellent and clean.",5,2015,10,18
203,Perfect spot. Great stay.,"The Westbury was a perfect place to start our vacation. Excellent experience all the way around. Room was very comfortable and well appointed, with a great view of the city. Wonderful service. And a prime location from which to explore Dublin. ",5,2015,10,17
203,Best in Dublin,"All my research paid off as this was an excellent hotel in a great location. The Jr.Suite offered just the right amount of extra space we were needing by this point of our vacation.  The people working here were like all the other Irish people: nice, polite, cheerful and friendly.  What more could you ask for? Highly recommend.",5,2015,10,17
203,"Perfect location, Great service - will enhance your stay in Dublin","The Westbury exceeded my expectations.  I knew it was in the city center, but it was absolutely in a perfect location.  It was situated on the key tourist street with shops, pubs, and historical locations to visit all within 5 minutes of the hotel.  The staff was phenomenal.  We arrived at 5:30 AM, which we knew was very early.  We were able to complete the paper check-in process and wait in the hotel until the local shops opened up.  While waiting, a person with cleaning responsibilities asked us if we wanted coffee or tea... unbelievable!  We were given bottled water by the front desk too.  Our room was available to us by 11 AM, 4 hours prior to stated expectations.  The staff offered many suggestions for sites to see, pubs to visit, best places for music, etc.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay just due to the staff, but also loved the room.  Very  modern, clean, with many extras.  One extremely positive thing about our room was how quiet it was.  We were situated facing the busy public area with the shops and pubs, and we were not able to hear anything on the street late at night, which was a problem at another hotel we stayed at in Dublin.  ",5,2015,10,17
203,a beautiful citytrip,"Dublin is a very beautiful city with friendly people the stay in the hotel makes it complete. The location of the hotel is perfect for shopping and the Hop on Hop off is very near so you can visit many beautiful places in Dublin. The Temple bar district is nearby for good pub food and restaurants with lovely Irish music.
One off the best city trip we have done.",5,2015,10,16
203,great location but I am not impressed,this hotel for sure is one of the best located in Dublin and it strives to offer very high standards. On first sight it appears to be luxury. This time I was disappointed of the cleanliness of my room. I think what I personally start missing as someone who travels a lot is that I as a guest am valued. In the big chains I feel more and more like just beeing handled as an item surrounded by standard processes.,3,2015,10,16
203,Excellent hotel,"Perfectly clean, excellent staff, great food. This is a perfect location to tour Dublin. Do visit the Library in Trinity College Dublin where you will enjoy one of the Worlds best collections, I would recommend people stay here.",5,2015,10,15
203,"Exceptional service, great location","Hard to say enough great things about this hotel.  Comfortable, quiet rooms and the location on Grafton street could not be better.  The staff is very helpful, and gave some great recommendations for restaurants and things to do.  From breakfast to the chocolates on my pillow when I returned to my room, thank you ",5,2015,10,14
203,a little pricey but worth it,"We normally stay at their sister property in London (the Marylebone Hotel, also a great place to stay) and decided to try this hotel out because we like the Marylebone so much.  While a little pricey it is in the heart of Dublin, near Trinity College and within walking distance of most of the sights.  Our room was spacious and comfortable and the hotel is very quiet (something that is a important to us). It is also a short walk from the 700 bus in from the airport (get off at the Trinity College/Grafton Street stop and walk down Grafton (which has pedestrian traffic only). It's easier than the 747 bus which requires 2 additional buses to get to the hotel.",5,2015,10,12
203,Westbury never fails,"We have visited Dublin on a regular basis & wouldn't stay anywhere else.  Not only is the location ideal, the friendly staff make every stay pleasurable and they cannot be more helpful.  Highly recommend the Westbury to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2015,10,12
203,Perfect Hotel and Ideal Location,"Love this hotel.! So much Charm and the location couldn't be better. Walk out the door and its a shopper's Paradise. Walk out the side door and you are ready for the history tour. So close to Trinity College and all the night life  Pubs one street over. It is situated for the best of all worlds. The hotel itself is gorgeous, one of the top hotels in Ireland. The staff is warm and friendly. and are so informative and yet couldn't be more professional .  I have already booked my family for another trip. Can't wait to return.",5,2015,10,07
203,Perfectly tailored experience,"Staying at the Westbury is like living on Grafton Street. You are always moments away from  the designer shops, Stephen's Green and the street performers.

The hotel is serene, beautifully decorated, luxurious yet welcoming, and the staff treat you like royalty. Service is excellent. The full Irish breakfast is freshly cooked - no buffet here! Could sit in the Gallery all day having cocktails/coffee and watch the world go by.

Afternoon tea is a special treat worth doing. They offer gluten-free and nut-free versions, and they will box up your remaining cakes and scones beautifully if you can't manage it all.

Ask them to arrange a sleepover... gummy bears, marshmallows, teddy bears and movies make the stay special for your little ones as well.

Possibly the loveliest hotel stay I have ever had.",5,2015,10,06
203,Perfect location for strolling around Dublin,"What a great hotel, is the perfect location, just off Grafton Street with excellent shopping and great bars close at hand. 
The full Irish breakfast is brilliant, definitely sets you up for the day ahead. Staff are very helpful and eager to assist, will stay again on our next Dublin visit.",5,2015,10,06
203,Home away from home in Dublin,"My aunt, a fellow traveler and myself have just returned home from a 15 day odyssey traversing all of Ireland.  Our initial home base was the Westbury Hotel in the heart of Dublin.
We stayed two nights on the front end of the trip at the Westbury and followed our journey with two final days in Dublin before heading back to the states, again at the Westbury.
  The hotel is centrally located, tucked neatly away just off the busy and ever popular pedestrian Grafton Street. 
 Upon arrival, after a long 8 hour flight, our welcome was warm and inviting---from the doorman and staff, who effortlessly took control of our luggage, to the staff at the front desk--we felt as if they were all genuinely happy to see us entering their hotel.
  We were quickly checked in, offered complimentary waters.  As it was still quite early, our room was not yet ready but our bags were taken and secured, we were offered a call alerting us as to when we could come back to the hotel and given a map of the city.
Hungry we set out on foot in search of a wonderful bakery, The Queen of Tarts.
  The mobile phone I had brought from home was not working, so the ladies at the desk quickly directed me where I could go to purchase a new phone.
After enjoying a tour of the city on one of the numerous hop on / hop off buses, we returned back to the hotel around 3PM and were escorted up to our room.
   The Westbury is an elegant hotel but that does not equate to haughty or stuffy.
This hotel is as gracious as the Irish people---truly happy to welcome you into their hearts.
 The room was warmly inviting and stylishly decorated.  The AC was working great but we could opt to crack the windows had we prefered---the rooms are quiet with very little street noise filtering in--a joy to any weary traveler. 
A very modern and stunning bathroom with plenty of space was a delight for the three woman sharing its space.  My only complaint, and this is with all the hotels we encountered during our travels around Ireland, is the lack of plugs in the bathroom. In order to dry and style hair, one has to search out an adequate plug out in the room and this may or may not be near a mirror or adequate light.  This also requires turning on room lights therefore negating any peaceful sort of rest for those still in the bed.   But I discovered that this is considered a safety issue.  There are a few hotels that do have  permeant mounted hairdryers actually in the bathrooms, but 9 times out of 10 one is left to seek a room plug.
  We ate breakfast each morning in the hotel's dinning room The Wildes.  Breakfast consisted of a plentiful ""cold"" buffet or the option to order ""hot"" items from a set menu.
Great coffee, tea, eggs, bacon (Irish bacon), porridge, sausages, pancakes, pastries, fruit, juices, toast were all fresh and expertly prepared and served by a friendly, informed and attention detailed staff.
 High tea is offered each afternoon, with reservations highly recommended, but as we had had lunch out each day, we simply opted to have a cup of tea or afternoon cocktail in the elegant yet modern seating area which overlooks the people busy Grafton Street.
  The room we had upon our return to the hotel at the end of our two week long journey did not have an AC that worked nearly as well our first room so we did have a warm two evenings yet still felt as if we'd returned home after a long journey--welcomed and content.  On our final morning, as we had to rise at 5 AM in order to shower and head to the airport, we were greeted by cold water in the shower--all three of us were met with a cold brisk shower so we suspected that perhaps the hot water may be cut off during the nighttime hours--or it simply could have been a fluke--since we were leaving we did not report the lack of hot water--yet overall our stay at the Westbury was indeed a delightful positive.
If I eventually find my way back to Dublin, the Westbury will be, once again, my home away from home.",5,2015,10,04
203,Good hotel with central location,"Top notch hotel with central location in Dublin, near many shopping and walking only streets.  Comfortable king bed and good customer service. This was our fittest hotel on our trip to Ireland and we'd do it again. A bit pricey but worth it. ",5,2015,10,04
203,Excellent centrally located luxury hotel in Dublin,"We stayed at The Westbury for two nights in September 2015.  We were upgraded to a suite, which was very large and luxurious.  This is a 5 star hotel all the way.  The Westbury is located just off of Grafton Street which is a main shopping and dining area.  Walking distance to many main attractions including Trinity College.  Taxi cabs are readily available in front of the hotel for travel to the airport or other attractions.  We had a memorable dinner at Balfes Brassiere and Bar.  We had an outside table and experienced the energy of Dublin, while enjoying a delicious meal and properly made cocktails.  I highly recommend The Westbury not only for its great location, but also for its excellent service and friendly staff.",5,2015,10,03
203,Lovely hotel,"This hotel is just lovely and plane beautiful. Staff is really friendly and treats each guest in a proper manner. In room dining is excellent, I think one of the best food you can get in Dublin. Location is perfect just in the middle of Grafton Street ! I have been here a few times and never had the slightest complaint. ",5,2015,10,03
203,Friendly and attentive Westbury staff ,I enjoy the Westbury Mezzanine because it's sumptuous seating and attentive staff make business meetings a charm. I've used the Westbury baggage holding area when merely passing through Dublin because the doormen always offer to check my bag when I approach from Grafton Street. The ten euro tea for two is a really sterling silver service that I offer to visiting Americans who often have sampled nothing beyond iced Nestea products. The Westbury offers the real deal with a smile and that is why I've camped out on the mezzanine for the past 12 years.,5,2015,10,03
203,Wonderful Experience,"After a long day of travel, it was a pleasure to find the Westbury lived up to the Internet reviews.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  We were in our room in no time flat.  The room was comfortable and nicely decorated.  We had cocktails in the Marble Bar and the bartenders were so friendly and helpful.  The only other meal we had at the hotel was breakfast and it was delicious.  The location is great for shopping and very close to Trinity College.  ",5,2015,10,01
203,Business Breakfast,"I am Dublin based and would never think of going to the Westbury for breakfast, however, my brother was here on a business trip and invited me to join him for breakfast.  Great move.  I was really impressed, the breakfast room was absolutely full, tables all set with white starched table cloths looking crisp and clean.  Staff were friendly and efficient, seating us with ease and taking our drinks orders.  The menu was wide offering things like Chia Pudding to Grilled Kipper Herrings.  I chose Eggs Florentine with Hollandaise and Spinach and enjoyed every mouthful.  Coffee was good, juices cool and fresh and toast crisp and warm.  A great early morning adventure in my home town.",5,2015,09,30
203,Excellent location and general service,"I traveled with work for a few days in Dublin. the hotel is located in the city center, few mintues walk from Grafon Street. the hotel staff was lovley and even when I arrived before checkin time, I waited only one hour - they were fast response.
The doorman of the hotel , is one of the friendliest I have ever seen and always helpful - and it reflect on my personal athmosphere after a long flight or working day. 

Please note, that the reception is located on the 1st floor and not on ground floor, so going up the stairs maybe tricky if you don't have help with your laguage. once you are a guest of the hotel, you can enter the elevator on the ground floor with your room key. 

also, any other services that you wish to have besides what you order are rediciously expensive (for example: 20 Euros for breakfast !?! ).",5,2015,09,30
203,An Ireland Hotel Above the Rest,"The Westbury Hotel was recommended by our travel agent as a pre-extension of our tour. This was our first time visiting Ireland. Westbury's location in the heart of Dublin was perfect we could walk to many places or catch a bus. I was most impressed by their attention to details Waterford crystal glasses in rooms, turned down service with a truffle to greet you after a busy day sightseeing. Every staff member made you feel like you were their only guest. Next visit to Ireland we will be staying at Westbury and based on this experience will try other Doyle hotels. ",5,2015,09,29
203,Excellent Hotel - Exceeded my expectations,"My wife and I stayed at the Westbury 2 weeks ago with our 9 week old twins. The hotel staff where amazing and extremely accommodating. They upgraded our room so that we would have more space with the twins and also had beautiful teddy bears for each of them as gift for their stay.
That evening we ordered food in the lounge area and they surprised us my getting the meal send to our room and gave us a complimentary bottle of wine. It was an amazing experience of kindness and good will from the hotel. The Westbury goes above and well beyond to make your stay a great experience. 
The room was an amazing suite with plenty of room and really relaxing. 
Also having twins the hotel was located in the ideal location for getting to Grafton Street. We also had a double buggy and it was easy to navigate around the hotel and access the street. 
This was a great experience for our first night away with the twins and one we will never forget. I would like to thank the hotel for the great first night away with our twins.",5,2015,09,29
203,Excellent,"The Westbury is an exceptional hotel. We had one night at the Westbury upon our arrival to Dublin form the States, and prior to our return to the States after a 15 day self driving excursion around Ireland. It was so nice to have the welcoming relaxed atmosphere that the Westbury offers after a long plane trip and a wonderful experience in a welcoming friendly country. They were very accommodating upon our arrival both time, even at 5:00am when we left for the airport. ",5,2015,09,28
203,Excellent - again!,"So I get to stay at the Westbury again. I travel with work, and end up eating on my own on a Sunday evening. All I want is great food, healthy food, served by a warn and smart waiter. And it happened again! First time I thought it could be a coincident, now second time, still the service, the atmosphere and the food is just great! They tailor make the size of courses, they are super alert without being annoying, they are warm and welcoming and they look after me in a distant and very warm way. Just the way you want it when you dine on your own. Last time the waiter went out to get me an adapter (not his job at all, and of course the food+ service were amazing). This time they taylor make the portions to me understanding that I am not into a large cheese plate on my own. The wine! The wine is great, needless to say any more. Please visit the bar/the restaurant The Balfes at the Westbury!",5,2015,09,27
203,Nice hotel in a perfect area for walking,"Good hotel but I think they gave us their worst room. Big spot on the carpet and I asked for a clean coverlet and extra pillows ( seems as if all of Ireland sleeps on very flat pillows??)Anyway, the room attendants were very quick to come and the desk clerks were very helpful especially the concierge. Lots and lots of great places to eat and drink. Close to St. Stephane's park ( which is glorious)and close to Trinity College. ",4,2015,09,23
203,EUR 480 for small & average room,"Too expensive, room very small and noisy, basically no window, lights in the room didn't work. The hotel location is good, but I won't come back. Breakfast was good, great Cappucino and Bircher Musli, but that's probably not enough for  EUR 480, excluding breakfast of course.",1,2015,09,23
203,Amazing stay at the Westbury,"Genuinely a stay here is out of this world. Friendly helpful staff, luxurious accommodation! you feel like the president all day and night. The location is absolutely brilliant and I am still trying to convince my other half to move in! Each time we visit, the staff remember us and welcome us and we've been surprised with an upgrade at no extra cost! It's a very special place",5,2015,09,21
203,In the Heart of Dublin,"The Westbury Hotel was recommend by our travel agent, and was a wonderful choice.  It is centrally located within walking distance to many of Dublin's attractions.  The rooms are spacious with many amenities, and all staff members we encountered went out of their way to be accommodating.",5,2015,09,20
203,Location Can't Be Beat!,"Recently stayed here at the beginning and end of a 10 day tour of Ireland. The location is in the center of Everything. Pubs, restaurants, and great shopping on Grafton Street are all within easy walking. The hotel is well maintained. The rooms are pleasantly decorated with king size beds. Very fast Wifi was easily available. The staff was excellent, friendly, efficient, and helpful. In fact, the doorman remembered us on our return after 10 days! The buffet breakfast was excellent. There was much variety, and the scrambled eggs were very delicious. We were delighted with our stay!
",5,2015,09,19
203,"Lovely hotel, unbeatable location.","I haven't stayed in the Westbury for years but a recent visit makes me think I might be here again more often. First let's get the glitch out of the way - on arrival, the front parking area of the hotel - which is very limited - was totally full so I proceeded to drive down into the hotels underground car park. We unloaded our luggage, thinking we had nothing to do but get an elevator to reception. But the elevator can't be called unless you have a room key so we had to drag our baggage up the narrow stairs to reception. When I pointed out this shortcoming to the lady that checked us in, she seemed disinterested and eventually I had to request that it be brought to the attention of a duty manager. Later that evening we got a handwritten apology from Guest Relations, so while we had a poor arrival, it was very well handled by the hotel. I would guess that we should not have parked ourselves and that we were just unlucky that the hotel concierges were very busy at that time. The rest of the stay was excellent. Our room on the 6th floor was truly a haven of luxury - huge in size, with a four poster bed, sumptuous fabrics, carpeting and furnishings, it really was a gorgeous room. The bathroom was equally well fitted although it was a surprise to see no separate shower. Checkout was the opposite of check in - a concierge took our key and luggage and had the car brought to the front door with all the luggage already loaded. Keith on reception had us checked out in no time and provided bottled water for our onward journey - it was a lovely stress free way to depart. We'll be back!",4,2015,09,19
203,Westbury home away from home,"I have stayed with the Westbury Hotel roughly 10 times.  This particular trip I was not able to stay the entire week due to the hotels prior bookings.  This was the first time I've had to stay at another hotel in Dublin.  I was a bit unhappy about having to move hotels for one night because The Westbury is quiet, centrally located to restaraunts and shopping.  The staff is exceptional and the overall feeling when staying at this hotel is quaint and secure.

The only disappointment was the change in the room service menu.  It is very limited on choices.

Otherwise, this is the only hotel I prefer to stay in when traveling to Dublin.",4,2015,09,18
203,A marvellous few days in Dublin,"The Westbury was everything we could have hoped for in a city centre hotel. Beautifully maintained and elegant, with impeccable and efficient staff, the hotel certainly lived up to our expectations. We enjoyed every moment of our stay.
      ",5,2015,09,17
203,Beautiful great city center hotel,"We stayed at he Westbury with our adult kids for one night while flying out of Dublin.  The Westbury is a terrific property.  Service was top notch, the rooms were exquisitely decorated, and all at a somewhat reasonable price.  The only downside of the Westbury is that since it is an old hotel, the bathrooms are small.  Overall for a European hotel the room was very spacious.  The Westbury's location could not have been better.  Located right in the City Center EVERYTHING was easily within walking distance.  My only regret is that we only had one night at the Westbury.",5,2015,09,17
203,Very Enjoyable,"What we expected and more. The Staff are excellent in every way, very courteous and offer great service. Room and public areas very luxurious. Breakfast offered a great variety and all options top quality. 
Looking forward to out next visit",5,2015,09,17
203,Does not fully meet expectations from a luxury hotel,"A fair rating would be between 3,5 rather than 3 but I was disappointed by this place (especially when the hotel is a member of the Leading hotels of the World) although there are some very positive points: great location, very nice staff, comfortable beds, very fast wifi,.
But at the end of the day it looks like a rather standard high level business hotel where you do not see specific efforts to make you feel good or feel home.
Here are some details that I disliked:
I had a very large suite but with a very impersonal and ""cold"" decoration
The lobby is noisy with loud music which is absolutely not necessary. So are the elevators
There are only 2 elevators that you may long wait for if it is a busy time.
You have to queue to be seated for breakfast!
Bed turndown does not include closing curtains
No linen on the floor next to the bed
I could hear the TV from the next room almost all night. Maybe that was exceptional due to a deaf person in that room but anyway
The air conditioning was very strong (16¬∞C) and it took one hour before I stopped freezing. Why not choose 19¬∞C as a standard?

So, nothing very serious but several non fits to my definition of a luxury hotel.",3,2015,09,17
203,Will never stay anywhere else while in Dublin!,"Love, love, love the Westbury! The staff are friendly, helpful and professional. The suite we stayed in was beautiful and the king sized bed was luxurious. I agree with other reviewers when they say that the onsite restaurant is one of the best in Dublin. We ended up eating there  three times because the food was so delicious.
The location can't be beat!! The Westbury is in the middle of everything! So many fun pubs, restaurants and great shopping within minutes. We walked everywhere except to the Jameson Distillery and the Guinness Factory but both places were just a short inexpensive cab ride away. The Westbury was truly a five star experience. I can't wait to go back!",5,2015,09,15
203,Always delightful,"Its my 3rd  stay at the Westbury...I alway enjoy the ultimate experience of Irish welcome classy , and sophisticated yet  , friendly , and warm... and at the heart of Dublin social life .. The lobby is alwaya full of buzz .. The service is perfect evryone is always happy to help any guest which makes efficient for a business stay as well .. The gym
Is small but the plate of fresh fruits there brings the touch of ""welcome"" which is the landmark of this  ,albeit not cheap , hard to beat superb property... ",5,2015,09,15
203,A quick stay,"From the moment that we pulled up at the door and the doorman Derek said let me take your keys until we checked out and there was Derek again with my car again it was service at the top of world. All the staff were welcoming and very helpful and afternoon tea a great treat. We are already planning a longer stay.

To the manager excellent - one the top hotels around the world",5,2015,09,15
203,5 STAR,"A love;ly 5 star experience, Rooms are lovely and in house restaurant is very good. Very close to shopping street and night life. You should at least treat once by staying there. Little bit expensive but its totally worth",5,2015,09,15
203,You get what you pay for,"The Westbury is everything luxury digs should be, with the extra added attraction of being centrally located to virtually everything important in Dublin city.  We walked everywhere except the Guinness Storehouse, for which we used the Hop On/Hop Off bus.  Service at The Westbury was impeccable and of the kind that you really thought they wanted to be helpful.  They were, in all regards.  It started at the front desk where, because we had booked through American Express Travel, we were told our room had been upgraded and that we would have a free dinner in the hotel restaurant, Balfes.   That dinner turned out to be one of the best of our five day stay in the city.  The room was large and beautifully appointed, and we were greeted with a bowl of fresh fruit and bottles of spring water.  As it turned out, wi-fi service was a little spotty, the TV remote (when we watched) was balky, the Nespresso machine was clunky to use and the bathroom faucent only dribbled out water, but these were nits against the comfort of the bed, the nice shower/bath combo, the view out to the city, the splendid breakfasts (included in the room rate) and the overall comfort of the place.  The location cannot be beat, and neither can the service.  Everyone is well trained and sincere about customer service.  Would stay there again in a heartbeat, even though it is a definite splurge.",5,2015,09,14
203,A terrific experience in Dublin,"On September 5, 2015 I arrived at the Westbury with several friends after a long flight from the US.  We were on a golf holiday.  I was excited to see that this was the same hotel my wife and I visited for the U2 360 show at Croke Park.  The facility, location and staff are exceptional.  My friends had never experience a Doyle Collection experience and we are all seasoned travelers.
I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there in the future.  I will plan on trying the Washington DC hotel on a future business trip.",5,2015,09,14
203,Great hotel with a great location,"Came here for business/vacation. Place is centrally located to many shops, pubs, and restaurants. Friendly staff. Clean rooms. We had a queen sized bed, but the room felt a bit cramped. Maybe I'm just used to the U.S. Sized rooms. Would definitely recommend. ",4,2015,09,14
203,Afternoon tea at the Westbury,"The afternoon tea at the Westbury is well worth a treat. Staff were lovely and friendly. We stayed over two hours and they were not rushing us to move at the end so could have stayed longer. Got fresh tea several times along with a beautiful arrangement of four selection of sandwiches, two types of scones and five different desserts. It was my birthday so they gave us an extra dessert tray saying happy birthday which was a lovely touch. Really enjoyable experience.",5,2015,09,13
203,Great Location Great Hotel,"We stayed at the Westbury during our Ireland Tour.  The hotel's location is very central and very close to museums, landmarks, shopping, restaurants and pubs.  The hotel has all the amenities expected of a five star hotel and the restaurant offers wonderful food.  The rooms are well appointed and the staff very friendly and service oriented. We found Derek to be very friendly and helpful as well as very knowledgeable of Dublin.  He is a definite asset to the hotel.  Overall our stay was wonderful and the Westbury will help make our trip to Ireland an unforgettable experience.",5,2015,09,12
203,"Great location, beautiful hotel","We arrived last Saturday to Ireland and stayed at the Westbury in Dublin the first 2 nights. It was centrally located, had a wonderful lobby to have cocktails in and made us feel at home. The staff were always a tremendous help and went out of their way to be friendly.  Overall a lovely hotel and I would highly recommend!",5,2015,09,12
203,Great Location,"Room was not huge but very comfortable. Breakfast cooked to order and good! Prices in Dublin are high but Westbury good value for money.

Staff were pleasant and helpful.

An excellent location for a couple of days exploring Dublin.",4,2015,09,11
203,The Best in Dublin !,"Having stayed in numerous Dublin hotels claiming to be 5* I have to say that The Westbury is by far the most superior.  The Westbury is modern, clean, central and the service of the staff is second to none.  I've been fortunate to stay in many hotels throughout the world and am confident that the Westbury is of true ""world class"" status and by far the best hotel in Dublin. ",5,2015,09,10
203,Fantastic Hotel and Location,"Stayed over UK late bank holiday weekend.
Arrived mid afternoon and bags taken from taxi. Check in pleasant and bags arrived in room when we did. Good sized room with lovely 6 ft bed but no view. Full Irish breakfast was cooked to order which is a definite plus from usual buffet of luke warm food. True 5 staff accommodation. Only niggle was in room safe was showing low battery and did not work. Reported to reception and room attendant who was there to turn down but not repaired during stay. Would return if price was competitive.",5,2015,09,10
203,Excellent in terms of location and staff,From the moment I arrived the valet took care of my car and luggage and the friendliness and efficiency  of the staff was outstanding. My room exceeded expectations and I could not fault it in any way.,5,2015,09,10
203,Not a great day for a hotel,We have stayed here on many occasions in the past. It is a great location and generally very good. On this occasion however there were major issues. First the elevators were out of order at 9am this morning ( why not fix them overnight ). A tough walk from the six floor with dodgy knees. Then could not get into breakfast despite the fact that there were many emptied but uncleared tables......maybe untrained or short of staff. For this type of hotel with its rating just not good enough. ( by the way I use hotels over 100 days per year ),3,2015,09,09
203,Loved this hotel,"The moment we walked in bleary eyed from our red eye flight from the states, the staff were over the top accommodating. My biggest fear was checking in so early and being turned away but our room was available so we went straight to it to rest and recharge before starting our vacation. Unfortunately I was ill most of the trip but hanging out more in the room than I should have was not a bad thing here, nor were the hot whiskeys which was the only imbibing my stomach could tolerate.",5,2015,09,09
203,First trip to Ireland,"Started our trip in Dublin and stayed at this amazing hotel, perfect location - middle of everything.  You can walk everywhere from here - Grafton St, Temple Bar, St. Stephen's Green, Trinity College.  Will definitely be back!",5,2015,09,09
203,Ideal location with impeccable service,"Have stayed here numerous times now for work reasons (one leisure) and you can't quite get a more ideal location especially if you're a tourist. Adore the staff (cleaners etc. included),their service and they're extremely helpful too. Fantastic breakfast & dinner. The bar is excellent for lunch and for a nightcap and there's lovely hotel views with fabulous interiors. A great spot for Afternoon Tea and a spot of shopping. Nothing I could at all fault.",5,2015,09,08
203,After dinner drinks,"We went here last night after a meal out for a drink. The staff are great and the surroundings are fabulous and extremely comfortable, it's an ideal place to relax with a drink or coffee after a meal. I must admit The Westbury is one of my favourite hotel.
Their afternoon tea is the best. Try The Westbury next time you are in the city.",5,2015,09,05
203,The Westbury Hotel Dublin is the best!!,"We stayed at the Westbury Hotel Dublin for 5 nights in August 2015.   Its central city location makes it an ideal choice for those wanting an immersive inner city experience.  
Its close to great restaurants, bars, parks, music venues, shopping & transport.

We asked for & were given an upgrade from an already beautiful room by Joseph Downing, the hotels guest relations manager.  What a stunning suite we were moved to, pure luxury. With follow up phone calls from Joseph to check if we were happy with the new accommodation.  Above & beyond the call of duty, but besides being a stunning hotel, amazing service is what they do best.  If you intend to visit Dublin & require Hotel accommodation do yourself a big favor & try the Westbury...You will not be disappointed.

203,City center perfection,"Location, location, location.  5 star right off Grafton, perfect.   Clean hotel, nice rooms, make sure you at least get a front facing room so you have a decent view.  Taxis always available for those dinners with high heels that are to far to walk.  About 7 to 10 euro to get to a restaurant a little over a mile away.  Nice simple breakfasts in the morning for 15 euro with coffee and juice.  Shower/ Tub is a little small for a guy like me and the water gets everywhere, but other than that I really have no complaints, I would definitely come back and stay.  Pubs literally as soon as you walk out the hotel.  McDaids, although they really don't care too much for tourists.  Sheehans around the corner was more tourist friendly.",5,2015,09,03
203,Outrageous Pricing,"My husband and myself received a present of a voucher for the Westbury from our adult children & partners and they felt we'd get a couple of nights plus Afternoon Tea in the hotel.(The amount of the voucher was ‚Ç¨400.00).  Wrong. We stayed on Thursday last 29th August and did not have enough in this voucher for one night. The price to stay on a week night was ‚Ç¨460.  That breaks down into ‚Ç¨230 per person for one night B&B.  Is anyone else really cross and resentful about this? Because we are both seething that these prices are being charged.  Yes of course the hotel is very comfortable - ( turndown service included wine and macarons), but nothing more than you would expect from a five star premises. We did not have the wine as we had been out at a Show for the evening. Remember we were not in a suite and had a superior room - this was all that was available on booking. Our room was not large, and the en-suite bathroom was quite compact. We are not at all new to five star hotels and don't mind paying a little bit extra for the added luxury they afford. But this level of pricing is mind-boggling and has just left us both seething. It is clear that this premises is geared towards the elite niche. Does anyone else think this is outrageous?",4,2015,09,03
203,Superb lodging in central location,We reserved two rooms for three nights in late August based on the hotel's location and recommendations by other reviewers and were quite pleased.  The rooms were excellent with luxurious bath and bed linens.  Service was excellent with the concierge making transportation and tour reservations.  We were pleasantly surprised with the bar food menu and quality of food,5,2015,09,02
203,Great Hotel & Location,I spent 4 nights here and was most impressed with the property and the location. The staff were friendly and very knowledgable and able to help with any questions. The breakfast catered for all tastes. I highly recommend this hotel and would certainly stay here again ,5,2015,09,02
203,Great Hotel for Families,This hotel was amazing. Located in the heart of Dublin. Walkable to all shopping areas and surrounded by restaurants.  Room were very spacious and clean. Excellent service as expected.  Minutes away from all sight seeing in Dublin. ,5,2015,09,02
203,Excellent hotel. Superb service,"We stayed there only one night but wish we had stayed there longer. The hotel was excellent in every way. Both the lobby area and the room were tastefully decorated. The staff was one of the best I have ever encountered in my extensive travels. The room was clean and quite spacious. Even though it is located in the heart of Dublin the sound proofing was wonderful. The restaurant was also excellent in service, food and value.",5,2015,09,01
203,Three very enjoyable days in Dublin,Excellent 5 star hotel. The service was outstanding the staff were very anxious to please. The public rooms were very comfortable and well furnished. Food was well priced considering the standard of the hotel. This is a hotel I would be very happy to return to.,5,2015,09,01
203,Old world charm,I visited with my wife and another couple for coffee and scones. The Westbury has a beautiful old world charm with hints of Art Deco here and there. There was air of opulence  which made for a very pleasant environment. Although we only had coffee and scones we were treated to silver service. Not the cheapest place but I suppose if you want a bit of style in the centre of a major city there will always be a premium.,4,2015,09,01
203,Great Location,"The hotel is in a great location in the heart of everything.  You can walk anywhere in Dublin.  The hotel has a nice hip vibe.  We enjoyed Trinity, shopping, eating, watching rugby with the locals, drinking at pubs, and met very friendly Irish people.",4,2015,09,01
203,afternoon tea,"I popped in to meet a business colleague and we had afternoon tea. It came with lovely sandwiches, scones and clotted cream. I had the coffee-lovely and plenty of refills,My colleague had Earl grey tea and was happy with it,",5,2015,09,01
203,Brilliant location,"Just spent three nights at my favourite hotel in Dublin. Staff extremely helpful and friendly. Rooms as always immaculate with slippers, robes, complimentary bottled water & nice Butlers chocolate treat left on your pillow each night!  Yum. 
However I do have one bugbear THE INTERNET CONNECTION!!!!  We were on fourth floor and lucky to get any service. Hope management look into this as proved to be tricky to make arrangements to meet up with family & friends while home for long weekend. 
Still my favourite hotel. Close to Gaiety Theatre & amazing pubs and restaurants. No need to hire car at airport. Everywhere either easy walking distance or amazing taxi and transport available directly outside the hotel. Enjoy‚ù§Ô∏è",5,2015,08,31
203,wonderful,"This hotel never seems to disappoint. The service, food and rooms are always fabulous. I especially love people watching in the restaurant especially if I have one of their wonderful baked alaska's in front of me",5,2015,08,29
203,Amazing experience! ,"You know you are probably going to have a fantastic time when the taxi driver who picks you up at the airport commends your choice of hotel and so the adventure began! We pulled up outside the Westbury to be met by the concierge who immediately whisked our luggage inside. It was 10am and obviously our room was not going to be ready but we were presented with complimentary bottles of water and a map of Dublin at reception with the promise we would be texted as soon as the room was ready so we could go and ""explore"". At 2.30 we returned to the most amazing suite with all our luggage already there waiting for us. The bathroom was to die for with built in ""tilevision"", his and her sinks and an amazing range of toiletries that were replenished daily. This is the only hotel I have ever stayed in with proper wrap around bath towels! The 6ft bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in at any hotel. In all the room was beautifully appointed and absolutely spotless. We returned later, after another trip into Dublin, to a beautiful complimentary chocolate mousse set on a plate with ""Happy Anniversary"" piped on in chocolate. Attention to detail is a feature of this hotel. They had emailed me three days before departure to check requirements and I had mentioned in my reply that we were celebrating our 25th Wedding Anniversary. Every night at about 6.30pm a member of staff would come to ""turn down"" the bed for the night which involved complimentary chocolates placed on the turn down and complimentary slippers placed by the bed. We didn't dine in the hotel because it is so central that there were too many other places to explore but we did have the most amazing cocktails in the Marble Bar. In all this was the most amazing experience. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. On departure the concierge whisked our bags away again and hailed a taxi from the rank right next door to the hotel for us. We did not want to leave. We will be back! ",5,2015,08,29
203,Beautiful!,"The best location in Dublin. Right off Grafton Street. This modern beautiful hotel was perfect for our stay in Dublin, the staff was accommodating. We loved the restaurant so much we ate dinner there both of our nights. Our room was beautiful and quiet. We really hated to leave. Thanks to American Express Travel for suggesting this Hotel.",5,2015,08,28
203,Top notch place to see all of Dublin from,"Pricey but the staff were great, and the rooms, meals and location were top notch.
Close to everything city center but amazingly quiet.  Breakfast were really great Irish tradition items and healthy choices as well.",5,2015,08,27
203,"Traditional, great location, some limitations","My wife and I visit dublin often and have tried a number of hotels. The Westbury is pretty good overall. It is located in a prefect spot - just off Grafton street in the center of Dublin. The suite we had was very nice. The hotel has a good set of services - small gym, a few areas to eat or drink and overall good service. 

I give it four stars as we had a problem getting room service one night as they were busy (said they had just received a big order and could not help for at least thirty minutes), which was surprising so we opted to venture out instead. The water flow was also a small problem to the shower/bath but not insurmountable. ",4,2015,08,27
203,Great place to stay in Dublin,"We've stayed at other Doyle Collection Hotels before with excellent results so expectations were high.

Fortunately we were not disappointed. The location is excellent with in easy walking to a number of attractions, bars and restaurants. The room was very nice and clean and the beds were quite comfortable. 

Best of all was the service. We were only there for one night but everyone we interacted with was very friendly. The bar drink prices were very reasonable as well",5,2015,08,26
203,THE WESTBURY DUBLIN IS PURE LUXURY,"My second stay here and it lived up to memories and expectations.  One of the great city hotels that wraps you in its luxury the moment you walk through the door.  Well-trained and helpful staff, superb rooms, lovely ambiance in the public areas.  Cannot recommend The Westbury highly enough and would definitely stay there again.",5,2015,08,26
203,Always a delight knowing I will be staying at Westbury!,"Well run, well maintained, well managed hotel.  Third stay in 5 years and the hotel keeps up its appearance.  Lobby is well lit, clean and welcoming.  Security features on elevator (must have room card to access).  Professional staff at front desk, bell desk, housekeeping.  Scuffs, chips and paint scratches taken care of promptly.",5,2015,08,25
203,Luxurious!,"Let me start by saying that we drove here with a navi and still had a really really hard time finding it. Somehow the address and that actual physical location are a disconnect. Whatever aggravation we had disappeared as soon as we pulled up and the valet greeted us and wished our bags away before we could blink. The staff is beyond helpful and friendly. The hotel is immaculate and I couldn't stop admiring the fresh flowers. The location (once you find it) can't be beat. The bartenders are great - we enjoyed many an Irish coffee in Ireland, but they were probably the best here, I must say and know you've found a treasure when locals frequent the bar/restaurant too. Enjoyed seeing the high tea in the afternoons, but we didn't try it. Would love to stay here again!",5,2015,08,25
203,Luxury,"I visited the Westbury hotel back in April along with 3 of my friends. Everything was perfect the staff couldn't do enough for you, the rooms where very a really good size and the food was second to none. Absolutely fabulous hotel. I will definitely be returning in the near future,.",5,2015,08,24
203,"Fantastic hotel, deserves it's 5*. ","My favourite hotel in Dublin. I stayed here for my birthday.  Front desk staff were amazing and very welcoming. They delivered a bottle of wine, chocolates and a birthday card to our room when they discovered I was celebrating my 30th birthday. Rooms were comfortable and breakfast was lovely. Can't fault this hotel. ",5,2015,08,24
203,"Great location, great hotel","We stayed here for 1 night upon getting to Ireland and 2 nights at the end of our trip.  In both cases they upgraded our rooms (one night to the Presidential Suite!).  It was amazing.  The other two nights were also to a suite that was spacious and very comfortable.  In Dublin, you are walking distance to most major attractions (there aren't many aside from the Guiness Storehouse and Trinity College...and a lot of old cathedrals.  But you are also close to some of the best pubs and the center of the downtown area.   Also, a really great and attentive staff.  Loved this hotel.",5,2015,08,23
203,"Top class, old school, five star hotel!","We stayed here for three nights and we really loved it. Can't wait to go back next summer! The hotel is just top of the class. The staff are very friendly, there's a personal touch like calling you by first name not Mister or Miss. The room is clean, cozy and spacious. ",5,2015,08,23
203,Classy hotel with excellent breakfast and great location!,"The rooms are really nice, with high quality beds. Great breakfast buffet, and nice afternoon tea in the lobby. The restaurant in the ground floor is ok, but not at the level of the hotel. For a weekend in Dublin, I doubt there is a nicer hotel with a better location. Highly recommended!",5,2015,08,22
203,Location Location,"Wonderfully situated in nicest part of city with restaurants and bars on all sides.
Rooms are tasteful and comfortable. You can walk to most attractions from here including the Temple Bar if that's your thing - be warned very crowded. Staff are very professional and friendly.  This is an upmarket hotel that has a beautiful foyer and gallery for tea and coffee and people watching. A very pleasant feel to the overall hotel. Only suggestion would be to allow for people to do own toast as ours were soggy (breakfast)",4,2015,08,22
203,Best Location In Dublin? I Think So.,"Dublin is a city of expensive hotels, similar to prices in London, Paris etc.  That said, if you want a hotel that's in the centre of where the action is, then the Westbury is for you.

A posh hotel with excellent staff and lots of nice extras.

Beautiful public rooms, nice bedrooms and a good breakfast.

Situated on a side-street, just off the pedestrianised Grafton Street.  Near to Trinity College, just around the corner from the Gaiety Theatre and about a half mile from the famous O'Donahue's Bar.  Lots of restaurants nearby.",5,2015,08,21
203,Keep coming back to Westbury Hotel,"This was our third stay and it always impresses.  The staff are wonderful, friendly not pretentious.  Rooms are fantastic - bathrooms clean and comfortable, and beds are luxury.  Now that we know Dublin, we realize that the location is perfect - close to Trinity, Grafton, St. Stephens Green and all of our favorite restaurants are just out the back door!",5,2015,08,20
203,Sheer luxury as always!,"Have stayed here multiple times and have never been disappointed! 

Excellent service, spotless and well appointed rooms and in the perfect location.  You definitely get what you pay for and I would highly recommend it to anyone! ",5,2015,08,20
203,Luxury and convenience in the heart of Dublin,"We visited family in Dublin; they arranged for our room at the Westbury. We stayed three nights. Positives: The bed was king sized, high quality and comfortable.  The room was on the Henry Street side, air-conditioned and quiet. The staff were courteous and solicitous, the room always clean and well-maintained. This was our first experience with a Nespresso machine; great luxury!  A light breakfast was included in our room package and was spectacular, with fresh fruit, plain yogurt, the best croissants we ever had, heavy whole grain bread with jams and unsalted butter, and tea and coffee. Located off Grafton Street in the middle of Dublin shopping and tourist activity, near Trinity College. Negatives: though water pressure was good in the shower, pressure in the sink was not and it was necessary to keep the door open to ventilate the bathroom during the shower. Internet was free but weak and spotty; in fairness our family told us this is a Dublin-wide problem.",5,2015,08,20
203,Luxury with pure class.,"Whilst not cheap the Westbury is in a fabulous location for shopping or sightseeing. We were given a lovely upgrade to a suite with a roof deck- see photos below,  and the staff are very friendly. Before we arrived I was emailed to ensure all the details were correct on my booking and any preferences I mentioned were noted. 
The rooms are classic and very clean with luxury fixtures and fittings. I am looking forward to sampling the breakfast tomorrow morning! 
So far my first impressions of the hotel and Dublin are excellent. 
I would definitely stay here again if I have the opportunity, and will be recommending it to my friends.",5,2015,08,19
203,Fabulous hotel ,"This is one of the nicest hotels we've stayed at and it's so close to everything,  just off Grafton Street in Dublin,  friendly staff and very spacious rooms..a modern hotel with an old historical feel,  would definetly plan on staying here again!! ",5,2015,08,19
203,This has to be the best place to stay in Dublin!,"My wife and I so much enjoyed our three days at the Westbury.

The hotel is wonderfully situated in the heart of Dublin. 

The staff is friendly and full of great sightseeing and dining suggestions.

Our room was spacious and had a beautiful view out of the front of the hotel.

We'll definitely come back!",5,2015,08,19
203,It Really Doesn't Get Much Better than This,"Disclaimer: I was in this hotel less than 24 hours. I spent one night here before flying back to the United States but I strongly considered missing my flight to stay here a little longer. And when a hotel is almost subliminally persuading you to abandon your return trip back across the ocean, you know it has to be good. Folks, ""good"" is a bit of an understatement. Everything about The Westbury Hotel is high class, from the valets greeting you on the street to the glasses in the rooms that I think cost more than I earn in a year.

In fact, the only bad part about The Westbury Hotel is, according to local lore, the location for any drivers who come here. I gather it is not the easiest hotel to get to by car but if you're along for the ride and going to be walking everywhere, fantastic! Let's lace up our shoes and see what the hotel has to offer...

Turns out, quite a lot, though again, I'm only going off of about 16 hours of residency here. Because this is Dublin, the valets have umbrellas at the ready for anyone arriving or departing. In fact, once you step inside the lavish ground floor, there is an umbrella closet to your left for guests coming and going. Nifty!

A bank of elevators sits on the right, while a grand stairway is immediately in front of you and in front of another set of doors. Up the stairs rests the front desk and some of the friendliest hotel staff you will ever see in any corner of the world. Seriously, the gal who checked us into our rooms was awesomely efficient and nice. She was also quick to get one room ready so that the bellmen could drop our suitcases off while the other room was cleaned (we got there early).

While all this was happening, I turned around and took in one of the most opulent lounge areas I have seen. Coming here in the afternoon/evening for a drink is something you have to do, not just to ""be seen"" but to also peruse a pretty extensive cocktail menu. We actually stopped by for a before-dinner-drink and a nightcap, later on in the evening. By this point in my trip out here, I was a walking zombie, and I credit their scotch selection with keeping me motivated and hydrated to continue my wandering. Also, the little trio of nut selections they offer was a tasty supplement.

There looked to be a restaurant directly opposite the front desk but I never got the chance to stop in for a meal. If it is anything like the rest of the hotel, I am going to guess the waiters and waitresses are all unicorn herders, while the kitchen is entirely operated by magicians and enchantresses. I guess what I am saying is the degree of professionalism here is seemingly unmatched.

Anyway, we made our way over to the elevators and hopped aboard the one that came down. And then I noticed the bench in the elevator. I mean, yeah, the hotel does not have that many floors, but if for some reason you need a quick 11-second nap, there is a bench in the elevator you can crash on. This is officially awesome.

The hallway of the floor was quiet, plush and inviting. And so were the housekeepers. Literally, every maid we passed said ""hi"" to us and offered to get us anything. I'm telling you, the level of service and accommodating eagerness is staggering (in a good way) here. Later on, someone would come by to offer to turn down my room and even though I said I was fine, she still gave me two mints for my pillow! That woman gets my own personal MVP honor for my brief stay here.

My room was like a little slice of Nirvana. The bed gave me the best night's sleep during my trip, and the facilities in the room were just... nice. Everything, from the provided glasses and umbrella, to the modern bathroom and the welcome hum of the air conditioning made what little time was spent in the room reassuring, comfortable and seductive in that it was tempting to neglect my flight out the next morning.

If I can rightfully give a 5-star rating on a limited stay here, then the people in suites coming for a week at a time can probably offer up a 17-star score. The Westbury Hotel deserves all that praise, and then some. It really does not get much better than this.",5,2015,08,18
203,Perfect,"It's my 10th stay at the hotel and I love it.  From the concierge to the housekeeping staff, the service is superior.  We had afternoon tea and you certainly get what you pay for.  Being vegetarian, I normally receive the humble cheese and lettuce sandwich as an alternative, but the Westbury alternative was a wrap which actually contained quinoa, which is every grain lovers' fantasy.  We were given fresh tea constantly and were each presented with a box of chocolates at the end of our tea.  The rooms are comfortable, stylish, and most importantly, spotlessly clean.  The shops are right on your doorstep but it's not a noisy hotel.  It was hot when we arrived so the air conditioning was great.  A special mention should go to Balfe's Restaurant where the food is excellent and staff are all fantastic.  The Westbury feels like home every time we stay and we cannot wait to return.",5,2015,08,17
203,Heart of Dublin,"Really great stay at the Westbury! The staff was very friendly and catered to all our needs. Located in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Dublin,it was an easy walk too all the pubs, shopping and restaurants. The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. There was a bit of a heat wave while there and had the front desk send a fan too our room as there is no ac in the rooms. I doubt you will find a better hotel in Dublin than the Westbury.",5,2015,08,16
203,Can I just live here please?,"I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff has done everything they can to ensure our comfort and happiness. I suggested to my partner that we cancel the rest of our holiday and just stay here in this very civilized hotel!  The rooms were quiet, comfortable, spotlessly clean. The breakfast was perfect as was the wait staff. ",5,2015,08,16
203,The Westbury Hotel and Staff Were Fantastic!,"From our arrival to our departure, the Westbury Hotel Staff went out of their way to make sure our holiday in Ireland was fantastic!  This was our first visit to Ireland and was a short notice decision to travel, so we really didn't plan much before we arrived.  The Westbury Staff (Lukas was great) helped and advised us on tours, times, and sites to visit throughout Ireland.  Our room was great and we enjoyed the Westbury Restaurants & Pub, especially after a long, fun day of tours.  They were a great place to plan the next day's adventures!  We had the best time ever!  The Westbury Hotel is perfectly located to enjoy Dublin!  Thank you again for a Great Holiday!    We will be back!  Bill & Susan (Houston, Texas)",5,2015,08,16
203,One of the best hotels that we have ever stayed at!,"My family and I stayed here at the end of our vacation in Ireland. From start to finish, this hotel and their staff were the wonderful! From the perfect location where everything was a short walk away to their drinks and food. Just impeccable!",5,2015,08,15
203,The Ultimate,"Stayedbat the Westbury for 3 nights on arrival in Ireland.  Everything about the hotel, restaurants, staff could not be faulted.  Everything was to our liking and staff could not be more helpful.  If we return to Ireland we would definitely stay at the Westbury when in Dublin, the location is perfect.",5,2015,08,15
203,One of best hotel in dublin,"Really is very amazing hotel start from location in Main Street and close to many shopping area,resturant and coffee or sweet
At the gate is close to it is the amazing different flowers 
The hotel have great breakfast with excellent service 
The room is big and you have free internet with coffee machine nespresso with daily refill
The parking also is free
Stephen park is walking distance and really you will enjoy the butty of nature
The people is so kind and one of very good city that you want to visit again ",5,2015,08,14
203,Great stay,Thanks to all the staff at the Westbury on Monday night for making our stay so wonderful.the food was great in balfes and the staff wonderful too.a great hotel in a great location .a special thanks to Laura john Ashley and Paul for all they did for us.look forward to staying there again,5,2015,08,13
203,The Westbury - to be sure!,"We chose The Westbury to spend the last 4 nights of our 3 weeks travelling in Ireland, and it proved the perfect choice. The location is excellent, just off Grafton Street, although it was tricky to find by car. The staff were very friendly and obliging, the facilities were excellent, the breakfasts spot on. WE really enjoyed our time there and would not hesitate to stay again if we are ever lucky enough to be back in Dublin.",5,2015,08,13
203,Great location and service - could do with reflecting the times,"This is one of the best locations for a hotel in Dublin.  Just off Grafton Street and round the corner from St Stephens Green - so perfect for the sights and shopping.  There are also great staff throughout the hotel.  Friendly, helpful and professional.  The rooms are nice (but nothing special), with king size beds, fast WiFi, Nespresso Machines and lovely Aromatherapy Associates Amenities in the Bathroom.  The Lounge has lots of big sofas to flop into and enjoy Afternoon Tea and good for time with friends, or business meetings.  The Bar however is a bit dated and nothing special.  There is a lovely, new Brasserie Restaurant on the Ground Floor, but the main restaurant is dated (I believe its about to be updated).  The Gym is also small and very tired.  Overall, its a good hotel, but it seems a bit stuck in the past - there is nothing original, or inventive to make it memorable.  Luxury Hotels used to be stuffy and all had the same formula.  Many have dropped this approach in recent years to reflect the tastes of the modern Guest.  The Westbury needs to take a look at its competition and come up to date with the times.",4,2015,08,13
203,Great!,"What a perfect location!  Very nice rooms and so comfortable. Slept well (too well?) with the blackout curtains.  Fresh, cooked to order breakfast. Only negative was that a few staff seemed uninterested, and didn't always follow through. 
      
      ",5,2015,08,13
203,Very nice,"We stayed three nights at the Westbury. It's a very nice hotel with very comfortable rooms. The staff was super friendly, and it's in a great location. We ate lunch at the bar a couple of times, and it was surprisingly good. The breakfast was pretty good as well. No complaints!",5,2015,08,12
203,Wonderful Stay,We really love this hotel. As it was our second visit we were not surprised by the friendliness of the staff which is wonderful to see. Everything was perfect from the room to the breakfast. The location in Dublin cannot be beaten. We cant wait to return. Thank you to all in the Westbury who made our stay so wonderful.,5,2015,08,12
203,Weekend break,Excellent hotel in a central location. The staff were wonderful as they were friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. They managed to get us a table at a very popular restaurant on a Saturday night at very short notice which was fantastic. The room was of a very high standard and the bed was one of the comfiest we have ever slept with-we got a brilliant nights sleep which is always the case when you stay away. Would highly recommend The Westbury and should we visit Dublin again we would stay here again.,5,2015,08,12
203,"Lovely Hotel, great location, walk to everything","Gorgeous hotel, excellent breakfasts, perfect location, friendly staff, very accommodating, would highly recommend for a romantic stay. Room was comfortable, wifi was good throughout the hotel. I would go back and stay here again. Fashionable and modernhotel in the heart of the tourist part of town",5,2015,08,11
203,Luxurious friendly hotel,"Our friend was competing in the Dublin half Iron Man last weekend so we booked here with another couple for a one night stay. We arrived on an early flight to Dublin, however the hotel were very happy to look after our luggage and agreed to call us once our rooms were ready. We took coffee in the beautiful seating area by reception and with friendly service and quality drinks we immediately began to relax.
The location is extremely central, perfect for tourists roaming without a car. The rooms are of a fab standard - traditional in style with good quality fittings and accessories. I was impressed by how superbly clean everything was, nothing had been missed, literally everything was pristine. The bed was wonderfully comfy to the point that I didn't want to leave it in the morning. Breakfast was served by super friendly staff and was again high quality with a fab continental selection too.
Everyone working in the hotel was warm, friendly and helpful and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Excellent stay! ",5,2015,08,11
203,FANTASTIC,"Called into hotel and had afternoon tea and sandwich. It was absolutely to die for. Great ambiance about the place and staff very courteous and helpful. Nothing too much.
ONLY thing I requested to have a higher chair and was told at 1 10pm that I would have to wait until,2pm, . I have two arthritic hips  low chairs difficult to manage. Disability discrimination, find this most unacceptable of a 5* these days!",5,2015,08,11
203,You will NOT be disappointed!,"The Westbury Hotel provided a beautiful stay from start to finish.  The hotel is elegant and impressive from first walking into it.  The staff was so gracious and attentive.  The rooms were immaculate, comfortable and spotless.  They offer turn down service and the staff was so professional with every interaction.  The hotel is located in the perfect spot.  It is right off of Grafton Street and an easy walk to so many great pubs, restaurants and all of the shopping.  We were right near the hop on bus and centrally located in the nicest part of Dublin (in my opinion).  However it was really easy to get to all other areas too.  I know the hotel is a bit pricey, but worth every penny!",5,2015,08,11
203,"Ideal location, oasis in the heart of Dublin's shopping area","In early August, we stayed for five nights at the Westbury Hotel.   This was my third trip to Dublin but my first time staying at the Westbury. In short, I would recommend this hotel over all others I have stayed at. The two primary reasons I would recommend the Westbury would be the very central, yet quiet, location and the very accommodating staff. Arriving from Boston on an overnight flight, we took a city bus to Trinity College and it was an easy walk to Grafton Street and to our hotel. Dublin is an easy, walking city and we took many strolls--towards Temple Bar, back towards Merrion Square but everything was easy to get to from the Westbury.  If needed, we could drop off a shopping bag or pick up a sweater. 
A friendly and accommodating staff can make a nice difference when trying to navigate a city and everyone at the Westbury was willing to help with any questions. Whether it was asking about changing money, suggesting dinner recommendations, or getting a tutorial on the in-room espresso maker, every staff person was friendly and more than willing to assist us.  As others have noted, the rooms are lovely and spacious. And even with the central location, we found the nights to be quiet.
In addition to staying at the Westbury, we'd recommend dinner at Dunne and Crescenzi Casa, live music at O'Donoghues, a beer at Peruke & Periwig, and the tours at St. Patrick's Cathedral and the self guided tour at the Guinness Storeroom, just for the view at the top.",5,2015,08,11
203,Luxury,"A wonderful hotel with amazing staff very friendly relaxed atmosphere and the d√©cor of the room was outstanding.
Breakfast was amazing the display of food was fabulous .
The hotel location is so convenient to city centre shopping and restaurants. 
There was plenty of parking and it was secure.
I was there with my sisters and the room was very spacious.
Would definitely recommend it.     ",5,2015,08,10
203,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed a total of 6 nights at The Westbury and thoroughly enjoyed it. Our room was spacious and well equipped and the bed was very comfortable. We had a package that included breakfast and it was delicious. We were able to visit a self service buffet for juice, fruit and pastries and then could order a cooked selection from the menu. It was so filling that we never needed to eat lunch. We highly recommend staying at The Westbury Hotel!",5,2015,08,09
203,Very enjoyable stay,Lovely and comfortable rooms. Great accommodations. Eddie and Lucas at the concierge desk were always helpful. The hotel breakfast provided a great great way start to the day. Monica and Gary did a super job attending to all of the patrons in the hotel dining room.,5,2015,08,08
203,Exceptional Service at a First-Rate Hotel,"We could not have been more pleased with our stay at the Westbury.  The staff is exceptional, especially Joseph, the General Manager, who went out of his way to make our stay memorable,  He made sure we had a room that met our needs, sat with us to outline sites worth seeing around the city, and spent time sharing with us some of his own experiences.  A truly delightful, knowledgeable, thoughtful, and humorous man.  The rest of the staff, including everyone at the front desk and the concierges, were also wonderful, helping me contact local people in Dublin whom I needed to reach, ordering a cab to get us to the airport on time, etc.  The facilties were excellent.,  A beautiful suite with plenty of room.  Breakfast in Wilde was very good as were casual dinners and snacks in the Gallery.  The location of the hotel could not be better with restaurants and shopping right at the front door and within walking distance to most sites. I recommend the Westbury highly.",5,2015,08,08
203,most comfortable hotel,"stayed one night at theWestbury hotel and wished it was for longer. everything from the room to the downstairs lounge where we enjoyed a drink was excellent .being so near to the action on Grafton St. it was a remarkably quiet and restful experience, and the staff attentive and helpful. will definitely return to this hotel again ,having stayed at several others over the years  this one gets my top award for position, comfort and cleanliness.",5,2015,08,07
203,Outstanding!,"We stayed at the Westbury for three nights on our first visit to Dublin and it was perfect. The hotel exudes a welcome atmosphere of intimacy, comfort, friendliness and professionalism. The only difficulty experienced was getting out of an extremely comfy bed in the morning but once that was achieved we were rewarded with a sumptuous breakfast served by welcoming staff who typify the understated yet detailed attentiveness of the service at this hotel. Could not be more centrally located for the plentiful shops, restaurants, bars and tourist sights that Dublin has to offer.",5,2015,08,07
203,Stunning as always,"Love this place so much. Feel special from the moment I arrive. Gorgeous reception area when we had breakfast. Great cocktail bar too. The location is amazing too as this hotel is nestled behind Grafton Street and close to fantastic bars and shops. The checkin and checkout , concierge service is super efficient. My second time to stay but I am already planning the next visit!",5,2015,08,06
203,Super hotel! ,Excellent hotel and staff! Lovely little surprises in room. Children were treated in a very special way. Doublw deluxe room was very spacious. Stayed in other hotels in Dublin but this one is the best.,5,2015,08,06
203,"Location, hospitality and a little noise","This is a really nice hotel, in an ideal downtown Dublin location.  The service is great - Eddie at the concierge desk proved especially helpful.  We had two rooms on the 4th floor for three nights.  The rooms were clean, well appointed and of a standard size.  The black out drapes were exceptionally effective; no annoying gaps.  Bath sheets on a towel warmer, super stocked toiletries, lovely pressed linens and chocolates at turndown.  This is going to sound petty, and I can't believe I haven't read anything about it in other reviews but, the bedroom doors are extremely heavy - great in a fire situation - absolutely awful for sleeping.  They slam shut with such force, your head rattles just a bit.  And they slam until midnight and start up again at 6:00am.  Perhaps, we thought, we are being sensitive?  While having tea (lovely!) at the hotel one afternoon, the guests at the adjoining table were also surprised at the door slamming noise.
So, to lower the rank of The Westbury over something that is no doubt a great safety measure and maybe a bit of a personal concern does not seem right.
Would we stay here again - absolutely - but with noise canceling headphones and perhaps a request to be at the end of the hall and not in the middle.",5,2015,08,06
203,Well Deserved Break,"My husband and I spent one night in the Westbury Hotel mid-week.  It is a beautiful hotel with a fantastic location.  When we arrived our car was whisked away and our suitcases taken and delivered to our room.  Check in was quick, no hassle.

We had booked a room with a view of Dublin and it was so nice.  The bed was very comfortable with duck down pillows, we slept very well.  The room was spotless as was our bathroom with tasteful toiletries.  We had asked for extra pillows and they were there on arrival.

We had breakfast to our room which was delicious.  We didn't eat in the hotel other than breakfast.  Check out was faultless.  Staff incredible, they really want to please.",5,2015,08,06
203,A terrific week at the Westbury,"Well, staying in their top suite probably helped that we had a great time at the Westbury and in Dublin.  The Westbury's location is fantastic with so much in close walking distance.  We had any number of nice restaurants to choose from.  Trocadero was our favorite.

Our room was remarkably quiet even facing the mostly pedestrian street.  It had two sets of Windows to deal with exterior noise and we never heard a sound from the adjacent rooms.  The room was fresh, clean, and very comfortable.

We enjoyed the on-site bar and restaurants.  We had considered both the Merrion and Shelbourne hotels but have no doubt the Westbury was the best for us.  We look forward to a return visit.",5,2015,08,05
203,Most wonderful family experience!,"We recently came back from a trip to Ireland and spent the first three nights at the Westbury hotel.  Aside from the rooms being quite large and nicely updated the common areas spaces were also beautifully appointed and had lovely views of downtown. The food was exceptional and the staff was more than accommodating to our 
dietary needs and requests. The best part of our stay was the incredible hotel manager Joseph. He was so knowledgeable of the area and made us feel welcome and at home. He also won over our 10-year-old with his wit and wisdom. When my parents came to stay at the hotel Joseph spent over 30 minutes with them making sure they knew where to go and what to do while in Dublin. Joseph and his staff are really exceptional.
",5,2015,08,05
203,Great Location,"Central location. excellent service.
We had problems getting a good wifi signal. the Hotel Manager personally came to the room to review. 
We were celebrating a special event and the hotel acknowledged this with excellent room service",5,2015,08,05
203,Starting to loose its sparkle,"I will start by saying that when in Dublin I will only stay in the Westbury. It is a fantastic hotel in an unbelievable location.

The good:
Wonderful location
Delicious afternoon tea
Fantastic breakfast
Great drinks menu and an inviting bar with a very personable service
Valet parking in central Dublin was very very convenient

The bad:
The guaranteed 3pm checkin is not guaranteed. 3.50pm in our case
25 minute wait for our bags to be delivered to the room
The room was quite small and the bathroom was tiny. 
The room was lacking personality.
I couldn't decipher why our room was a superior room. ",4,2015,08,05
203,Great location,"The Westbury is well located in the centre of Dublin (somewhat challenging to drive to at present with all the road works).  Doorman excellent friendly and helpful. Check in somewhat slow but polite.  We had two rooms both really rather small for 330 euro per night, but I suppose its a city hotel.  Afternoon tea really outstanding and the team here are clearly very well trained, a very nice way to pass the afternoon. The location is unbeatable.",4,2015,08,05
203,Good hotel and very central,The best part about this hotel is that it only 100 metres or so from Grafton Street and just around the corner from Pizza Stop. The rooms are quite spacious as is the bathroom. The breakfast is quite substantial and the young lady who works in the restaurant is an absolute gem. I didn't get her name but she was blonde and would have came from central Europe.   ,4,2015,08,04
203,"Location, Location, Location","Have stayed in The Westbury a number of times and you just cannot beat its location if in centre of Grafton Street. It is just fantastic in terms of having access to shops, restaurants etc while in Dublin.  Service is impeccable in The Westbury especially the staff. Every staff member that you engage is highly trained in customer service.  Rooms, while some can be small, are spotless clean and laid out well. The lobby area is a hive of activity and atmosphere and if you look closely you can spot the odd celebrity! A very nice location to enjoy a pre-dinner drink/afternoon tea etc.  The Westbury is a very warm hotel and you can tell very obviously one that is a traditional meeting place for family and friendly which adds to the ambience. Always my 1st choice if ‚Äòover nighting‚Äô in Dublin town.",4,2015,08,04
203,Glamorous and Comfortable,"Located in the heart of the city, this plush hotel gives you elegance and comfort. My party of 5 were looking forward to the niceties of a good hotel, coming from some cute B&Bs. We found the hotel that we all wanted to bring back home, and that's the Westbury. Gracious, full concierge services, luxurious beds, great service. We couldn't ask for more, until we signed up for afternoon tea and were overwhelmed. Loved, absolutely loved our stay in Dublin. The Westbury was a major part of that.",5,2015,08,04
203,The best in Dublin,"My wife and I took my mother to the Westbury as a birthday treat. It's many years since we've stayed there and we have tried all the major hotels in Dublin over the years both for business and pleasure. We have used the lounge many times over the years even when staying elsewhere as it is by far the best facility anywhere in Dublin for atmosphere and service. The place oozes class and backs that up with superb service whether you're just having a sit down, a drink or something to eat. Not cheap, but you know that before you book. Others charge similar prices without delivering the same level of service. It won't be as long before we're back.",5,2015,08,04
203,First stop in Ireland- Warm welcome,This is our first stop in the emerald isle and what a welcome we have got. The food is to die for and the hospitality is exactly what you expect from the Irish- AWESOME! This hotel is pure luxury and we are enjoying every sec of it,5,2015,08,03
203,Birthday stay at the Westbury,"We just recently stayed at the Westbury Hotel on Sat night 1st Aug 2015
A day,night and morning to remember nothing we asked was too much, the staff were so courteous and very professional and offered to help with anything we asked,fabulous suite and gorgeous cosmetics in the bathroom,the suite was extremely spacious and we really enjoy the red wine Punto Final Malbec,we will definitely return and spend more than 1 night,thanks for such an enjoyable time",5,2015,08,03
203,Top,"A very nice hotel. Staff is really on the top. Location is on the top. Rooms confortable but could be a bit refreshed. Restaurants and food excellent. Breakfast also. The best hotel for family holidays.

      ",5,2015,08,03
203,The Best!.,"Stayed here for two nights last week, and it was superb. The Concierge Derek was very helpful and friendly, the reception staff were a delight and the bar staff were most helpful. The position of this fantastic Hotel is perfect. We have stayed in many five star hotels and this is the best one. Attention to detail is important and that combined with helpful staff are the major qualities of this hotel. How nice to be given bottles of water on arrival at the reception and then again on our departure, only a small detail but leaves a good impression. Some of our friends went to the restaurant and they raved about the food and service. We will be back to Dublin in September and there is only one place we will be booking Well done, a pleasure to stay there.",5,2015,08,02
203,Worth the Money!,"We don't often stay in top of the line hotels.   But we wanted to stay in this area in Dublin, and decided, on the recommendation from our travel agent, to stay in one of The Leading Hotels.   Worth every dollar.  From check in, to assistance in getting dining reservations, to directions, to ""can do attitude,"" to a luxury property, I would definitely stay here on my next trip to Dublin!   ",5,2015,08,02
203,Great treat for our wedding anniversary!,"This is indeed a luxury 5 star hotel! The service is very friendly and attentive - they will help in any way they can.
The food is what you would expect; get a seat at the window if you can. The breakfast room is a great way to start the day too. The setting is just beautiful and Balfe's restaurant is a great place for a bite to eat or a cocktail.
Our room had a few issues; the hot water in the shower was too hot and I reported it on the first morning; it was still too hot the next morning. There was some black mold on the AC unit also which was a little disappointing and the experience of the room took a little away from the overall experience. Apart from this I would still highly recommend this hotel - it's an experience I look forward to repeating!",4,2015,08,02
203,First stop in trip to Ireland - Westbury Hotel downtown Dublin,"We arrived in Ireland and rented a car. First experience driving on the left and a bit challenging as we headed out of the airport. Once at the Hotel - it's in a great stop and walking distance to a number of great pubs/restaurants. Very nice hotel, service and food on property as well. Don't drive downtown, easier to walk or take the DART train.",5,2015,08,01
203,Very good overall! Oversight on details makes it short of being Excellent!,"The Westbury Hotel is one to which you will always return. Centrally located in Dublin's Grafton Street and beautifully laid out, this hotel possess a relaxed charm and that places you at ease.  Perhaps it is the friendliness of the staff that helps to create this atmosphere. Balfes restaurant was a good choice for a late super of Organic feta salad, mixed beetroot & pickled daikon, grilled gambas and a glass or two of Dow‚Äôs White Port.  The Westbury Hotel lives of the the standards one expects from The Doyle Collection.  The bonus was the absolutely perfect full Irish Breakfast.  However, the lack of lustre of the bedroom, which is a 'bit tired', means The Westbury Hotel, Dublin do fall short of excellent.",4,2015,08,01
203,Quint and central Dublin,"I think the first thing that impresses you is the over all friendliness of everyone on their staff . 
The rooms were clean and what you would hope for after a long flight
I recommend Balfres for a pleasant dinner which you can enjoy in jeans and golf shirt.    
Also around the corner is the equivalent of a Starbucks called Butlers Chocolate Cafe on Chattam Street and up the block is the Temple Bar (shopping)",4,2015,07,31
203,Outstanding Hotel,"Prior to coming to Dublin, I looked up various hotel in Dublin and found out the past reviews of the Westbury Hotel were dead on. This hotel is beautiful, clean, and has outstanding service, along with an excellent location. We arrived earlier than expected to the hotel at 5:15am and they immediately  check us in early to our room. This gave us time to sleep a few hours and still have a full day to explore Dublin. The staff are all very help and respectful. I would highly recommend everyone to this hotel. It is definitely worth the money!!!!!",5,2015,07,31
203,Wonderful stay,"Visited Dublin for a long weekend,stayed in a suite with my husband and two children..bed was a four poster bed which was soooo comfortable.Exellent service at all times, free bottles of water when you want it from reception.Great location.",5,2015,07,30
203,Dublin's own Crown Jewels,"This is a new favourite hotel in Europe, seamlessly blending old world hospitality with cutting edge technology and amenities. It also has a location that puts most other hotels to shame so you can venture out on foot and explore all of Dublin at ease. The staff are wonderfully well trained, genuine and warm, the food, especially at breakfast, is beautifully presented and our suite made it hard to leave on those frosty mornings.",5,2015,07,30
203,don't arrive early,Stayed at this hotel and unfortunately arrived  before check in.  We were told that a room would be ready soon.  Two hours later after camping out in the lobby I asked for a manager.  She told me our room would be ready within an hour. I was becoming annoying and could tell the staff was avoiding me but I complained again and then was told that we could go to the room.  Room had no view but I was happy to rest a few hours before heading out.  Hotel is a good location but the place needs a good pressure washing and has a major pigeon problem.,3,2015,07,30
203,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed! ,"My adult daughter and I met in Dublin and stayed at The Westbury for three nights. We both loved the hotel and agreed it was one of the most comfortable, clean, friendly hotels in which we have ever stayed. The Westbury is warm, inviting and elegantly comfortable. We enjoyed the food and cocktails very much. The bed was extremely comfortable. The location superb. We will definitely be back! ",5,2015,07,29
203,Comfortable and excellent service,"Excellent location on Grafton St. We stayed twice during out stay in Ireland.  The first room was cozy and quiet.  We were upgraded on the second stay and the room was larger but on a noisy side street.  The breakfast and bar were first rate.  Very congenial staff, we enjoyed out stay.",4,2015,07,29
203,A great choice,"Loved the guest services pre-arrival contact.  Confirming that we were arriving early on check in day, we were fortunate that a room became available .. a very welcome accommodation.  The staff was was friendly and helpful and the room was nicely appoionted and comfortable.  Location is perfect for access to everything - sights, shopping, restaurants - and we were so glad to have chosen the Westbury.  No need to look any further on our next trip!",5,2015,07,29
203,Very customer focused,Thoroughly enjoyable stay.  The room was spacious with smart decor and tea/coffee making facilities and the bathroom was well equipped with good quality toiletries.  The lift interior was a little tired for the quality of the hotel but the employees were extremely friendly and customer focused and made the stay special. ,5,2015,07,29
203,Disappointing ,"After a few months travelling in Asia I was looking forward to returning home with a short stop in Dublin on the way home south. During my trip I had stayed in a number of 5‚≠êÔ∏è hotels, this was definitely the most disappointing. The room we had was average and very noisy. There was a family staying next door whom we could hear their conversations clearly throughout the evening. From 5am or so we had the constant noise of delivery and refuse trucks to keep us awake. To add our woes we left a brand new (and expensive) sweater, still in its packaging, behind when we checked out. Rang the hotel and was told that house cleaning found nothing... draw your own conclusions. ",2,2015,07,28
203,Exceptional Service and Quality,"I recently stayed at The Westbury Hotel, Dublin in July 2015 with my wife and 10yr old daughter.
We stayed in a Luxury Studio Suite, 4 post bed room. Everything about the Hotel was amazing, from the size and amenities in our room to the wonderful staff who at all times went out of their way to look after us.
Special mention to the staff in Bafles Bar (part of The Westbury Hotel) for their superior service and Mocktail making skills for our 10yr old daughter! 
We'll be back!!",5,2015,07,28
203,"Beautiful high end hotel, great location.","We stayed here at the end of our trip to Ireland and it is all that it says it is. Our room was beautiful and quite comfortable although it could use more closet space and the bathroom was a tight fit. The location is great, you are a short walk from most everything, stores, restaurants, tourist attractions and pubs. The staff was very friendly and helpful to all of our needs.They could use more seating in the lobby area, there is none! We were in Ireland for our Anniversary and they decorated our room with towel swans, rose petals and chocolates. There was a beautiful card from the staff and a slice of cake. All of this made us feel very special. This is truly a hotel that cares for its guest. I recommend it and hope your stay is as wonderful.",5,2015,07,27
203,Excellent Hotel and Service,"We spent one night here in July and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Due to some electrical problem in the room which we had booked we were upgraded and received royal treatment!! All of the staff were excellent and we want to particularly complement Adam Harrington on the professional and courteous manner in which he dealt with the situation. The ambiance of the hotel is lovely; our room was beautiful and the food, both breakfast and dinner, were memorable. We are already looking forward to our next visit.",5,2015,07,27
203,"Lovely hotel, great location, excellent service",We stayed at The Westbury for two nights upon our arrival in Ireland and for one night prior to our departure. This is a lovely hotel in a great location with beautiful rooms and excellent service. The staff could not have been kinder or more accommodating! This was a special trip for my family (3 generations traveling together) and I was so pleased with our stays here. I would like to single out Joseph for his attentiveness and thoughtfulness during our stay. Thank you!,5,2015,07,27
203,Nice Location in the Heart of Dublin - Traditional Hotel,"Despite a number of technical and service issues, we would return because the management was quick to take responsibility for mistakes, and put its money where its mouth was.  This is one of the three top hotels in Dublin... Shelbourne, Marrion, and Westbury are considered the top hotels.  The location of this property is excellent for tourists.  Breakfast is good, and rooms are relatively okay...but older in furnishings and style.  My recommendation is stay in a suite.",4,2015,07,26
203,The Pot of  Gold at the End of the Rainbow,"Ireland is a land rich in history and culture and the Westbury hotel provided accomadations that suited all our wants. The hotel is very modern and city-centered. Located on Grafton Street which is the shopping center in Dublin, the hotel is about a five minute walk from Trinity College and the city center. The rooms were very spacious with elegant bathrooms. If you are a luxury traveler, or just looking to splurge for one night, the Westbury is the best place in Dublin. I also learned that the Westbury is a part of the Leading Hotels of the World, so you can be assured of first class service, rooms, and ambiance.",5,2015,07,26
203,Great first stay on our tour of Ireland,"Two couples toured Ireland for a music-based exploration of the Republic. After landing in Dublin, we drove to our first stay, at this hotel. This is a tough place to find by car, even with a GPS, so if you are driving please work out EXACT driving directions before you depart, as the GPS will be of limited value. Service and quality of room accommodations are first rate, as they should be at this price. Also, the location is near ideal for walking through Dublin. Concierge was quite helpful. Only downside was the lack of seating in the lobby. The desk indicates that you can sit in the restaurant area, but the restaurant staff didn't seem to get that memo. Did not feel welcome unless ordering something. Downstairs pub restaurant was a delight, with great food and outdoor seating available. ",4,2015,07,26
203,Great hotel and great location,"One of my favourite hotels in Dublin and my 'unofficial' office when I'm in town as it's so central for having meetings. The staff are great, the food good and the rooms are lovely although somewhat compact ‚Äî understandable, given the location. Mattresses a  bit too soft for my liking but other than that, couldn't fault it.",5,2015,07,26
203,Grand hotel with good service but thin walls,"It's a lovely facade and the feeling continues as you ascend to the reception area and are greeted by friendly staff.  However the walls are quite thin (making it too easy to hear neighbors' TVs or even snoring).  The included continental breakfast really is just toast.  Very nice location, just off pedestrian-only Grafton Street.",3,2015,07,25
203,Great location and great hotel,"We stayed at this hotel when we first arrived in Ireland.  It is centrally located and has everything that you need.  Very nice lobby and dining areas.  Perhaps a bit too formal for families with kids, but we were welcomed with open arms.  The hotel expedited the cleaning of a room for us at 9:00 a.m.   Service was perfect.  Very well run hotel.",5,2015,07,25
203,Worth Staying at Westbury,"It is without hesitation that I would recommend the Westbury Hotel to travelers.
We recently stayed there from July 14th to July 22nd.  The hotel is located in the perfect spot for easy access to many restaurants, shopping, public transportation such as the DART and Luas (both easy to navigate). Most everything you wish to see while in Dublin is withing walking distance.  The hotel staff is friendly and professional and willing to assist you in anyway possible.  We plan to return to Dublin and without a doubt stay at the Westbury!",5,2015,07,23
203,Wonderful Westbury,"Such a great experience from start to finish of our weekend stay at The Westbury.  Beautiful, spotlessly clean hotel, great location to all the shops/ bars on Grafton Street, an ideal base to explore Dublin.  Staff are really friendly and helpful, my mum is so hard to please when it comes to hotels haha but is still raving on about this hotel, needless to say we will most definitely be back before Christmas :-)",5,2015,07,23
203,Stunning elegance in the heart of Dublin,"We only stayed for 2 nights in the Westbury although I wish we'd stayed longer. It is a classy hotel, that has an old-world charm about it. Its location is perfect for exploring Dublin and doing shopping. Rooms are comfortable and very well kept with a good toiletry collection. The bathroom could do with a renovation - we did signal some problems with the taps but nothing was done during our stay. Breakfast was nice with a pleasant service, but at rush hour it was hard to get a waiter, so perhaps reinforcing that team might be a good option. Some more variety at breakfast might also be a good idea, i.e. you have a large selection of breads but not such a wide choice of fruits/yoghurts. The restaurant is interesting too but service can be a little too slow. Unfortunately a drunk client was making noise in the hotel lounge so we did not enjoy our drinks there and when we (and other hotel clients) complained to the waiters they explained that there was nothing they could do. The bar scene is interesting with nice plush leather chairs and a fine selection of spirits. Would definitely stay here again. Generally speaking it is a pricey hotel. General comment: do some renovation and reinforce the staff at peak hours.",4,2015,07,23
203,Great luxury hotel,This hotel is very nicely decorated and central. All features feels very luxurious. Staff is service minded and breakfast was great. Would defenitely stay here again if I go back to Dublin. The lobby is very nice and you feel very welcome by the personell.,4,2015,07,23
203,a perfect base for dublin,"About 5 years ago our son was coming home to Derry for Christmas and between boarding and arriving home lost his passport. To get a replacement we had to drive to Dublin on the day after boxing day .at the passport office he was asked for proof of his departure date which he didn't have with him.all the internet cafes in the area were still close so we had to go into the westbury where one of the staff allowed us to use their computers to download and print his documents.as a result he was able to get his passport issued that day.
Ever since this we have tried to call into the westbury for coffee or a drink when in Dublin as it is such a beautiful place.
As a great for our 40 th anniversary we decided to book into the westbury for 2 nights and it was wonderful. The location is great; you can walk out the front door straight on to Grafton Street and the crowds of shoppers and out of the back door you are in the middle of many restaurants and bars.
While the location is great the hotel itself is wonderful-well equipped spacious rooms,comfortable restaurant and bar areas, and really helpful attentive staff.
Cannot praise the Westbury too highly.we had a fabulous time and can't wait to do it again.",5,2015,07,22
203,Very Nice Hotel,"This was a very nice hotel but it had a few downs. We had to move rooms twice because of noise. The first time they moved us, they moved us right in front of the lifts. The service was amazing. The room itself was quite big but the bathroom was quite small. The bathroom was not very clean. The breakfast was really good. The area is very nice. Right next to a shopping street and close to the St. Stephen's Green Luas station.",4,2015,07,21
203,Excellent location and great service,This was our second stay at the Westbury.  The location is central.  The rooms are fresh and trendy with all the amenities.  The value is excellent.  We will definitely stay here on our next trip to Dublin.,4,2015,07,20
203,Amazing,I stay here while on business and they are so nice. I would say this is a luxury hotel. Very clean. Wifi works great. The restaurant down stars has terrific food. Right in the heart of down town so you can walk anywhere. One time while staying here on business I got quite sick. They brought tea to me through out my stay and got me in touch with the nearest dr for the terrible cold I had.,5,2015,07,20
203,"Great location, great service","Had an overnight stay at the Westbury in Dublin. Its location is Grafton Street (although it's actually just set back from the main thoroughfare on Balfe Street) and if you're coming from the airport by bus its a 5 minute walk from the bus stop at Trinity College.
We arrived early but on check-in we were told our room would be ready shortly. By the time we had a coffee in the beautiful and airy lounge we were set to go.

We had a deluxe room which was beautifully appointed,very comfortable and equipped with everything you could need for your stay (luxury toiletries, hairdryers, slippers, robes, more towels than it was possible to use on an overnight stay, free wi-fi and even an umbrella should the weather be a little on the damp side)

Breakfast was included on our stay and offered a wide range of options.

Every member of staff we encountered during our stay, without exception, was friendly and helpful. 

The location of the hotel is great - step outside and you're on Grafton Street. Turn left and you're a short walk from Trinity College, O'Connell Street and the Temple Bar area. Turn right and you can walk up to the beautiful park at St Stephen's Green (and the tram system if you need it). There are lots of restaurants and bars in very close proximity as well as lots of individual and unique shops.

Overall a great place to stay.",5,2015,07,20
203,Perfect location !,"We stayed for 3 nites at the Westbury in Dublin. What a beautiful Hotel in the center of everyting on Grafton Street, yet away from the maddening crowds ! Staff was very friendly and helpful. Beds very confortable and very nice rooms.",5,2015,07,20
203,Perfection in a hotel!,"My family and I were in Dublin for four days and The Westbury was our home away from home. Every single detail, from the greeting at the door, the lovely tea, turn down service and every other interaction was sheer perfection. When in Dublin again we will definitely be staying here again.",5,2015,07,19
203,Excellent service ,"This was my 2nd visit but this time with the family whereas previously had been on business. It was the exceptionally welcoming team that stuck with me first time round and we were treated to the same again on this visit. Being there for the European rugby quarter final Leinster v Bath there was much chat and banter about the forthcoming game before and after! All the staff remembered us. The room was fantastic and a few little extra treats welcomed. Breakfast has the biggest spread of breads and pastries I've ever seen. City centre location meant incredibly easy access to Grafton St , the Liffey and Dart station to Lansdowne Road but despite this no night time noise meant a good nights sleep. Will definitely return ",5,2015,07,19
203,luxury stay at the heart of Dublin ,"You cannot go wrong with this hotel.  it has a central location off grafton Street. 
The rooms are beautiful and clean. 
the staff are professionals and  hotel amenities are at a high standards. 
Another top Dublin hotel. ",5,2015,07,19
203,Top class 5*,"I can see why this hotel is in top 5 of 172, it's top class, customer service is second to none, very efficient very friendly. Hotel itself is perfect and have no faults it's bright airy comfortable, and spacious well worth it's 5 star status , if you get a chance it's a must visit, so central for shopping and shows, from the moment you step inside the door the staff take over and make you feel your the only guest they have, TRY IT , it won't disappoint ",5,2015,07,18
203,Westbury Hotel exceeds expectations,"We found ourselves in Dublin a day earlier than anticipated and quite late at night. After several attempts to secure a hotel for the night, we called American Express to see if they could help and grabbed what was available.  We were pleasantly surprised to see the location Amex choose for us. From the moment we pulled up to valet to our checkout two days later, each and every person we interacted with made us feel like royalty. Our dinner at Balfes was outstanding in taste with impeccable service. We opted to turn in our rental car early as the location was in walking distance to everything. What a fabulous way to end a ten day excursion in Ireland. ",5,2015,07,18
203,Beautiful hotel in the most central place in Dublin,"Fantastic hotel and very relaxed with the most amazing staff imaginable.  Perfect Irish hospitality.  Just wished we had stayed longer.  We arrived after 4.30pm and our room was not ready.  However the young man at Reception asked us if we minded to wait in the Lounge bar and someone would get us some drinks and as soon as our room was ready he would let us know.   This indeed he did after about 20 mins.  We were asked if someone wanted to take us to our room - we were happy to take ourselves.  Our son and daughter in law were in one room, us in another.  We had booked two double rooms.  We were unable to gain access to our room but no problem as a member of staff was on our floor when we entered the fourth floor and once checked our details soon let us into the room and someone within five minutes soon returned with new key cards.  Very nice and comfortable room with a lovely bathroom, even with a pair of novel bathroom scales!!  The whole feeling of the room was welcoming and comfortable although our room was actually a twin room not a double.  If we had stayed longer we would have asked for this to be changed to a double and am sure that the hotel would have done so within minutes.  We went out for dinner outside of the hotel and then returned prior to going to 3 Arena.  Upon entering our room, we found a huge basket of fruit with a note - however, not sure it was for us as it was addressed to someone else but marked for four people.  However,  gratefully received whether it was for us or not!!  One of those things I am afraid and it happens though I must say the staff were so incredible I could not fault anything even though there were a few mistakes - I can forgive them - for their wonderful genuine hospitality - Cant wait to go back and hopefully next time nothing will go wrong!!!  Breakfast was very nice and again staff very good.   Cannot recommend this place enough and it was spotlessly clean too.",5,2015,07,18
203,"Friendly staff, great location","Fantastic location central to most hot spots in Dublin. Room was clean, comfortable, well-sized and staff was very friendly. Only downside was the walls were thin so it was a tad bit noisy. Would certainly stay again. Breakfast was included with our stay and well done. ",5,2015,07,18
203,Short stop in Dublin,"Our family made a short stop in Dublin during a long family European vacation, and our stay at The Westbury was the most enjoyable of the entire trip.  The facilities were exceptional, and the staff was exceedingly friendly, helpful, and professional.",5,2015,07,18
203,Great location to walk around Dublin.,"This is a really nice hotel. It truly lives up to its 5 star rating. It has all the amenities you would expect with terrific service. The food was great;  the public rooms cozy and warm and a great bar to sit and relax.
The rooms were good size and very clean and well maintained. 
If I was going back to Dublin, this would be my first choice to stay.
Be forewarned..there is a lot of construction in the area, not much noise but detours..and the street out front is a pedestrian street so its hard to find the front door to unload..when you do find it you will be glad you did.",5,2015,07,17
203,The Best Hotel in Dublin!,"This place is amazing.  We loved everything about it.  First of all, the staff was very nice.  Michael was very helpful.  The bed was one of the most comfortable beds we ever slept in.  You can sit outside at the cafe and people watch.  Best of all, you can spend the day on Grafton Street without having to cross the street.  Breakfast was very, very good and the interior is gorgeous.  You cannot beat the location.  When we come back to Dublin, there is no question where we will stay again.",5,2015,07,17
203,Wow! Just wow!,"This might be a biased review since this was my first stay in a 5 star hotel. However, this was an absolutely faultless stay from the second I walked in the door to the second I left.
Staff are brilliant. Tremendous customer service in all areas. Even the small things like being handed an umbrella on my way out when it began to rain instead of running back to my room, utterly great!
We ordered room service one night, and although there is a small surcharge the food was delicious and delivered promptly to our room.
Rooms and hallways are lovely. Huge bed which was incredibly comfortable! A nice big TV, bathroom full of nice little toiletries, coffee and tea machines, umbrella, dressing gown and slippers, minibar, etc.
Location, again is brilliant. You're never more than a couple of minutes walk away from anything. 
Overall would highly recommend this hotel to anybody visiting Dublin...absolutely superb!",5,2015,07,16
203,Westbury is a great palce to stay in Dublin,The Westbury is in a great location - right off of Grafton Street. They really do have exceptional service. The Balfes Restaurant downstairs is great. The bar was very nice as well. Maid service was exceptional. Very central location.,5,2015,07,15
203,Family Fun,"We picked the hotel for location. On arrival the staff where excellent. Our room was average and certainly not 5 star standard. 
However staff and food are great and you really cant beat the location.
We also done a visit to Dublin Zoo. Can highly recommend",4,2015,07,15
203,"Amazing Hotel, First Class Service and Great Location","The Westbury Hotel offers a first class, five star experience in the heart of Dublin city.  We stayed for a weekend and were spoiled from start to finish, every employee we met offered us a warm genuine welcome and really looked after us.  Martin in Wylde Restaurant especially is such a professional and an absolute gentleman.  We loved the guest rooms, the beds are so comfortable it was difficult to leave!!  And the food was delicious at breakfast and in the restaurant, we will definitely be back!
I would absolutely recommend The Westbury Hotel for a extra special memorable experience in Dublin",5,2015,07,14
203,Good decent sized rooms and modern furnishings,"Rooms were well furnished and the bathrooms are very modern. The hotel is very conveniently located right near the Temple Bar district; which is perfect for tourists who wish to experience this iconic region of Dublin.

I can't comment on the quality of food here as we did not experience it, but the rooms were very satisfactory.",4,2015,07,13
203,Fantastic 5* for cocktails and service,"Well worth a visit and highlight of a trip to Dublin.

Surprisingly competitive price wise for drinks when compared to Temple Bar.

Lager cheaper than Temple Bar and a fantastic range of cocktails to treat the lady in your life.  Good ambience, fantastic cocktails (worth trying the chilli martini for something different) and excellent service.

Earned a few brownie points into the bargain and girlfriend has a new favourite cocktail.",5,2015,07,13
203,Comfortable and well-located,"Spent three nights at the Westbury as part of a tour, and we were well satisfied.  As others have noted, the hotel is centered amid all the upscale shops, pubs, and eateries anyone could wish.  Short walks bring you to Trinity College, museums, theaters, historic buildings, and some of the loveliest parks imaginable.  There is also much 'street theater' (buskers, mimes, musicians), so much of Dublin's youth and tourist flow seemed to gather right there.  In spite of the constant human stream at the doorstep, security seemed good, with roomkey-activated elevators and discreet but observant eyes at the entrances.  Staff were efficient and polite, and quick to offer help or to answer questions.  Turndown service had lots of little extras (slippers left by the bed, chocolates on the pillow, bottled water, music to greet us).   Our sixth-floor room was at the end of a long hall, and provided a silent night and a great view.  The room was spotlessly clean and nicely decorated.  There were electrical outlets compatible with both US and UK plugs, which were very convenient and much appreciated!   The bath was very clean, with lovely toiletries (but I never quite figured out the shower temperature controls, which seemed a bit random...).  Wi fi access was not immediately intuitive, but ultimately worked well for checking email and basic browsing.  A fine home away from home.",5,2015,07,13
203,"Top Location, Top service","Located on a small turnaround just a few yards from Grafton St in the heart of Dublin, so it is quiet [great sealed windows, great views] but so convenient to walk to St Stephen's Green, River LIffey, Trinity, Temple Bar, and everything nearby.  But the service is top notch and the place looks warming and welcoming.  Very fine breakfast.",5,2015,07,13
203,Consistent Quality,Stayed for just one night.  Excellent location.  Staff were very attentive.  Room was well appointed and had everything we required.  My only complaint would be that there was no air conditioning and the room was extremely stuffy and warm which resulted in poor quality sleep.  Breakfast was a lovely experience and everything was top quality including service.  Would recommend for a city centre experience.,4,2015,07,13
203,Unfriendly Customer Service,"Waited hours for our rooms to be ready and staff was irritated when we inquired about it. Generally unfriendliness of staff. However, this hotel is in a good location all within walking distance of many restaurants & shopping. Rooms were nicely appointed and very clean.
      ",3,2015,07,12
203,We were treated like VIPs...,"I booked our stay at the Westbury at the last minute, standing in the baggage claim area of Dublin airport.  We were at the end of a 3 week vacation where we had stayed at 6 different places. The Westbury turned out to be the best of the lot. 

Much of the impact of the Westbury (for us at least) is based on their great service. We are normal hard-working folks who save up all year for our vacation, not celebrities or wealthy people, yet the whole time we were at the Westbury, they treated us like VIPs. We kept wondering if they had us mixed up with someone else. It was that good. (I'm still sitting here thinking that they had us mixed up with, say, hotel reviewers).

We had booked a room that had two queen beds. When we checked in, we found out that we had been upgraded to a suite, which turned out to have a living room in one room and a king bed in the other. It had 1 1/2 bathrooms and a tub big enough to fit two people. Even though this is a busy area with a lot of foot traffic, we never heard any sound from the street.  I still don't know why we got upgraded, but I wasn't about to question it.  The porter met us at our taxi and carried our bags upstairs, then brought them up to the room after we checked in. He disappeared discretely without hovering for a tip (US hotels should take note of this!).  Then the housekeeper showed up with some chocolates, and showed us some of the room amenities (heated towel rack for instance).  Later when we asked the front desk about a good place to eat dinner, the gentleman called about five places, got us a reservation, then pulled out a map and told us how to walk there.  We had a lovely evening out, walking through the temple bar area. The next morning when we showed up for breakfast, we were led to a big beautiful table at the window, which is notable because there were three of us and the table seat 5.  

Listen, there are nice hotels all over Europe, but not many of them treat customers as nicely as this one does.  Every single employee at this place seems to have received consistent training on how to treat customers, because our experience was very consistently positive.

The hotel is also well located - the Book of Kells is five minutes away, and Temple Bar is at the doorstep.. Our taxi from the airport was 27 Euros (plus 3 for using the tunnel).  It's about a 45 minute drive to the airport by the way.",5,2015,07,11
203,Good Choice,"I stayed at here for 3 nights in the first week of July when I decided to go to Dublin for an extended long weekend. The location is excellent - not only because of its front door access to Grafton Street, but the fun and hip restaurants and bars located at the back of the hotel on Drury, Castle Market and others.

Service at the hotel is friendly and efficient. The breakfast at Wilde was very good where the service was prompt and friendly.

I had a room with an excellent view of Grafton Street and as noted by other reviewers, I never heard any noise coming from the street. The room appears to be recently refurbished and well supplied with amenities. There also is a new comfortable bed, as there was a survey in the room asking for feedback. My only comment would be that for a high end hotel, better maintenance is required. The desk, entry closet, bathroom drawers - all have chips and scuff marks on them. Even the paper lining in the bathroom drawer had stains on them, which I felt was not appropriate for a hotel of this quality. Also, I would suggest that they get better quality towels.

Other than those minor issues, you cannot go wrong staying at The Westbury.",4,2015,07,11
203,Great location...,The Westbury Hotel is off Grafton Street. You can walk to everywhere. The rooms are spacious. Air conditioning could be better in summer.  Valet parking was very helpful. We did not try the restaurant at the hotel because there is so much choice all around.,5,2015,07,11
203,Gotta Stay at the Westbury,"My wife stayed at the Westbury late June.  We returned since we had a great experience 3 years ago.  This trip equaled our previous visit.  The service was extraordinary.  I lost my US driver's license.  The hotel staff worked hard calling all the places I had been that day in Dublin.  No luck .. but the effort went above and beyond. The lobby is an excellent place to chill after site-seeing, before going out to eat, or for a nitecap. Very relaxed atmosphere and the service was very good.  The rooms were very comfortable, upgraded ... and well cared for.   The hotel is extremely well situated off Grafton St -- is a busy, active, and fun walking mall.  The hotel is also right next door to one of my favorite pubs in Dublin McDaids. Gotta go there too.",5,2015,07,10
203,Lovely hotel with great service,"We stayed for three nights here. The staff were very friendly and offered to assist with anything you needed. The room was average for a five star hotel as it was not very big but was clean and modern. The bar at the hotel is quite nice but only go here if you have plenty of money to spend as it is much more expensive than your average pub. The only issue I had was when we checked out the hotel took payment when the funds were still on hold from check in which meant more than twice my bill was unavailable on my card (luckily I had sufficient funds to accommodate this), most hotels would only take full payment once so this was a little concerning. It's been 4 days since checkout and I am still waiting for the balance to be returned.",4,2015,07,10
203,"Tired rooms, good location!","Great location right near Grafton St. so it's a good choice when in Dublin but it could be so much better if the rooms were a bit larger and just as important if they were updated and maintained better. On the plus side, along with the location there is a good breakfast service and very nice lobby and common areas. Overall disappointing because of the room quality. Please do some high quality renovations on those tired guest rooms.",3,2015,07,09
203,Introductin to Dublin,"The Westbury Hotel was perhaps the best location we could have chosen to stay in Dublin.  It is located in the heart of the city center, right on Grafton Street.  Trinity College is a couple of blocks from the hotel as is Dublin Castle, the Irish Historical Museum and many other sites.  The staff is extremely helpful and knowledgeable so we were able to locate our destinations, good restaurants, and some of the best shopping.  I would stay at the Westbury Hotel again.  I overwhelmingly recommend it.",5,2015,07,09
203,Perfect location. GREAT HOTEL!!!,The moment we walked in we were welcome. EVERYBODY was very nice and friendly. Our stay was very comfortable and the location was within walking distance to everything. Would TOTALLY come back here again!,5,2015,07,09
203,One of Dublin's Best Hotels,"Wonderful full-service hotel in the heart of the city just off Grafton Street.  Nicely appointed rooms and baths.  The staff was very helpful, attentive and friendly.  Stayed two nights, and enjoyed both a double room and family suite.  Hotel is within walking distance of every tourist site so we never used a taxi or bus.  Part of ""Leading Hotels Of The World"" consortium.  I don't think you could find a better hotel than this one.",5,2015,07,09
203,Outstanding hotel,"My boyfriend surprised me for my birthday by booking us in to the Westbury. As soon as they found out it was my birthday they upgraded us to a suite and sent a birthday card and selection of desserts up to the room for me! The staff were so friendly and helpful and the suite itself was absolutely gorgeous. We had a wonderful time here, so much so that we didn't want to leave! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone :)",5,2015,07,08
203,The Best Hotel in all my travel experience,"I hardly know where to begin.  This hotel is modern and slick, with good old fashioned service that I have never seen the like before.  My daughter was quite ill one night, the chef stopped his work and made her some applesauce.  You only get that kind of service at home.  As we were leaving the management lined up to enquire after her health and to suggest clinics.  Afternoon tea is a must!!  If you about to go out to sightsee or shop, ask at reception, they keep bottles of water there for you.  Amazing.  Rooms large, beds divine, great bathrooms.  Should I ever go back to Ireland, I will only stay here.",5,2015,07,08
203,weekend break,"What can I say, excellent all the way.Staff friendly and helpful, room clean and tidy with everything you want (coffee machine, kettle, different coffee and tea's, tv,but be warned movie channel is not free ,and bbc catch up.free WiFi). You don't even have to take your cases up to your room. one down side Dublin is very expensive, on lots of things.",5,2015,07,08
203,A mix between luxury and poor functionality,"I have mixed feelings about this hotel. On one hand, I was delighted by the whereabouts and general look of the hotel, by the room and the bed (the most comfortable I ever slept in!).
On the other hand, for a renowned 5* hotel, with huge prices, I was very disappointed with some aspects, all in the bathroom area: the sink was draining slowly, clogged, and the tap was too short and it was hard to wash your hands; the ventilation in the bathroom wasn't working; no toilet brush; only a fixed shower head, with no mobile option, so the shower cap was a must.
They should really work on these aspects, as they are very important for a good stay and for their image.. 

ROOM: The room (2nd floor, no balcony) was very spacious and well equipped. It had a king-size bed with wonderful pillows, a big wardrobe with shelves and hangers, a table with 2 armchairs, a desk, a mini-bar, a coffee machine with a selection of teas. The draped were very thick and blocked the light very well, enhancing a good rest.
The bathroom was very large and had a bathtub & 2 sinks, plus a bidet. The shower head was fixed, not ajustable, so using the shower cap is a must. The bathroom ventilation didn‚Äôt work.
They also provide an iron and ironing board, shoe cleaning products, bathrobes & comfy slippers.

SERVICES: Room service came everyday, made the beds, emptied the trash, changed towels, supliment toiletries if needed. Every evening, someone came to prepare your bed for sleeping, leave some chocolate & water if needed. WiFi signal is excellent everywhere.

LOCATION & PREMISES: Very central, just near Grafton Street, you have numerous shops & pubs near by, a mall and a park.

BREAKFAST: Small buffet area, food looking good (pastry, cereales, butter, gem, fruit salad, coffe, juices, yoghurts; some salmon & noble cheese). No vegetables, regular cheese or charcuterie; scrumbled eggs weren‚Äôt available everyday. Supplementary, you can order √† la carte, with payment.",4,2015,07,08
203,"Great stay, lovely place few complaints. ","Stayed here for 4 nights on our trip to Ireland. The location is perfection, the rooms are wonderful, great food. Staff is very accommodating. Two complaints I had, which was the showers are not built for tall people. Surprisingly this was the only place on our trip to Ireland I had this problem. So if your over 6 feet tall, be prepared to do some leaning in the shower. Also I asked the front desk what I should do to get some bottles of water and  they told me to call room service and they would bring some up. I was not expecting to pay roughly 5 euro per bottle of water upon doing so. Other than that, a fantastic place with wonderful rooms. ",4,2015,07,07
203,Best hotel in my view..... ,"Stayed here quite a few times now and I have to say it's my favourite hotel anywhere in the world!! There's something so special about this place.....! Staff are so attentive but not over the top. The attention to detail is wonderful and the location is second to none..... Fabulous staff, food, rooms, location, just beautiful. Only thing I don't like is that I can't give it 6* on here!! Cannot recommend this hotel enough..... Other 5* hotels could take a lesson from this magnificent establishment....... ",5,2015,07,07
203,Amazing Service,"Visited the westbury in Dublin for 3 nights, service excellent, customer care amazing and nothing is not too much trouble. Very clean, very well maintained and def was a 5 star.  Food was really nice and lots of options xx lovely restaurant next door as well.  Very impressed will be returning",5,2015,07,07
203,Great Hotel,"My family stayed at the Westbury June 29 thru July 3 - what a great hotel.  Rooms were great, food was excellent, staff was friendly and extremely helpful and the location to everything Dublin is awesome.  If you are planning a trip to Dublin you can't go wrong with the Westbury Hotel.",5,2015,07,06
203,Loved it!,"My husband and I recently visited Dublin and stayed at The Westbury! We were so impressed with everything about this hotel. The staff was incredibly helpful and kind. The location is perfect for shopping, sightseeing, pub crawling... You name it, it's in the perfect place! We definitely would recommend this hotel!!!",5,2015,07,05
203,Fantastic hotel,"From the moment we arrived to our departure this hotel and its facilities are top class
Nothing was too much trouble from topping up milk and tea in the evening to placing two bottles of water in the car for our journey home when we were leaving
It is the best hotel in the area, we have stayed in most of them over the last few years
The west bury will be our hotel of choice going forward",5,2015,07,05
203,Mixed feelings,"The hotel occupies the corner of a narrow right-angle alley. I drove here but had to depend on valet parking to take and return the car. One end of the alley opens onto Graftin, which is off limits to cars. If you want to shop there, the location is good. It is also only a couple blocks from St. Stephen's Green and maybe 10 mins walk to the Liffey. We never needed a taxi or the car. Last, there are many fine restaurants within a 5-min walk.

But this is true of most comparable hotels.

The atmosphere inside is relatively generic-business-hotel. Nothing particularly ""Irish"" about the interior. I loved the owners' Cork property, but that is a new-build and this, I Think is more of a remodel that limited what they could do. 

The breakfast staff and kitchen were not very strong. Confusion reigned. E.g., one Irish breakfast came without eggs. A novel error. Stick to the buffet. 

The bar also had only generic offerings.",4,2015,07,05
203,Poor Service,"At the end of our last evening after a fab theatre visit we had a nightcap before bed. I was refused putting the cost on the room when we wished to retire because I had checked in with a Debit Card. I was told that I had already made payment for the room at check in, I had not been aware of this and received no receipt. I tried to pay for the night-cap with the same card but was unable to do so due to connection failure. This happened at least 4 times and involved the waiter, the supervisor and reception staff. The waiter and supervisor were very apologetic, the reception were totally indifferent.  The reception would not help so to overcome the problem I had to suggest exchanging sterling into euros to pay cash (I had euros in my room but not enough on me). The money was exchanged without any advice as to the exchange rate and no receipt for the exchange was given. I paid cash for the drinks and no receipt was given. I was treated in a very offhand manner at reception. It took almost a half hour to resolve this problem and our mood which had been happy and relaxed was now very unhappy and agitated at the treatment I had experienced. 
If I had used the mini-bar I would have made the payment whilst checking out and I cannot see the difference between the two scenarios. I choose to use a Debit Card rather than a Credit Card and this should not give you the right to treat me as a thief not to be trusted to pay his bill. 

I will not return to your hotel and I will be sure to warn anyone I can to stay away from your hotel.",2,2015,07,04
203,the perfect location,"this was a clean, nice and perfectly located hotel. You could walk right across the street and be where no cars were allowed and see street performers both day and night. there were wonderful restaurants not even a block away. There were three places to eat in the hotel itself. downstairs was a wonderful little pub that we had a fantastic lunch. homemade soups, salads, of course wonderful fish and chips, and fresh berries and cream for desert.  Breakfast was upstairs and was also delicious. the open area in the lobby had a fireplace in the corner, sofas, chairs and tables that you could order drinks and food. it was a bit pricey but if you were too tired to go out and only wanted a little something it was perfect.",5,2015,07,02
203,Amazing Hotel,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Westbury in January last, beautiful hotel, the staff were absolutely amazing and the service was truly impecable from the time of booking until we left. It was a very memorable stay which we hope to repeat in the near future. We would highly recommend this hotel the only trouble you might never want to leave!! and of course the location is perfect in the heart of Dublin city.",5,2015,07,02
203,Luxury in Dublin,My husband and I stayed at the Westbury for three nights at the end of June 2015 on our visit to Dublin.  Westbury is pricey but if you are looking for a luxury stay then its worth it.  Located on Grafton Street which is a pedestrian area with shops and pubs.  Within walking distance of St. Stephens Green.  Cabs right out the lobby door if you need one.  Service excellent.  We had breakfast there two mornings in the restaurant and the full Irish breakfast is very good.  Pricey but good.  Some people had the breakfast included in their rate but we did not so keep that in mind when booking.,5,2015,07,02
203,Best stay in Dublin,This is by far one of the best hotels in Dublin and truly is a five star experience. The facilities themselves are clean and grand with a modern feel. The restaurant has good food and the waiting staff are great. Along with this the rooms are clean and the decor is great. The neighbourhood itself is A+ and The Westbury comes with great views and provides an enjoyable and easy walk to central shopping and restaurants in Grafton street and the area! Overall the stay was great and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an luxury and convenient place to stay in Dublin.,5,2015,07,02
203,"First stop, Dublin!",This was our first stop on our European Vacation. Centrally located in Dublin..beautiful and safe neighborhood. The hotel is exquisite and the employees lovely and helpful. Had three children at/above 16 years old - two rooms and beautiful accommodations.,5,2015,06,30
203,Top tier hotel in a great location.  Unsurpassed concierge service.,"My wife and I spent 4 nights in a Four Poster Bed Studio Suite which turned out to be one large well-furnished and nicely decorated room.  There was abundant space for clothes storage and the HVAC worked perfectly. The mini bar was well stocked and offered competitive pricing. The bed was ultra comfortable.The only negative was a very, very small bathroom with a single sink and step-over tub/shower combo.

We found the location to be absolutely perfect with a huge selection of pubs/restaurants/shops in the immediate vicinity.  Grafton Street was within 50 meters.  Trinity College was an easy 10 minute walk ( 1/4 mile)

Breakfast was great with a cold buffet and hot food individually prepared and served.

The level of personal service was uniformly high.  Special thanks goes to concierge Eddie whose friendly professionalism added so much to our stay.

We would definitely choose the Westbury if we were to return to Dublin",5,2015,06,30
203,The Westbury - Great Location & Excellence Service,"I stayed at the Westbury from 6/22-6/26 for a business trip. The location can't be beat. The hotel is right on Grafton street. This street has great pubs, shops and street entertainers. In addition it connects in one end with St Stephens Green, where you can hop on to the Luas ( light rail ) and at the other end with Trinity College. In addition its EASY walking distance to the Temple Bar area.

The hotel is elegant, with beautiful appointed rooms, and the staff is super helpful, without feeling stuffy.  

I joined their loyalty program Discovery and with that I got extra amenities in the bedroom including newspaper. WIFI is Free!

My accommodations also included a light breakfast which was perfect to start the day.

I liked the hotel so much, I'm planning to bring my husband on my next business trip so we can spend a little time visiting all the attractions",5,2015,06,30
203,When One Wishes To Spluge in Dublin,"The Westbury has a terrific location, close to some of the best shopping, restaurants and theatres.  The decor is that of tasteful, yet understated elegance.  The large tea room is a must after a day on the town to have a drink before contemplating the evening's affairs.  Our room looked right up the street, yet was completely silent to the traffic as one would expect.  I also don't like to be bothered and the hotel gets things done that need to be done without my involvement.  I also like that they give you a choice of morning paper, a nice touch.",5,2015,06,29
203,Could not fault,"I recently stayed in the Westbury on a Friday night.  From the time that i checked in, to the time that i checked out, i could not fault the hotel, the location or the staff.  I will definitely stay again!",5,2015,06,29
203,A city hotel of charecture and charm,A good if expensive place to stay in Dublin. Highly recommend the breakfast without doubt the best I have had in a hotel. Staff very helpful and the lounge was a good place to come back to after visiting the site.,4,2015,06,28
203,Afternoon drinks ,"What a fab hotel. We only came in for one drink but we were seated in the most comfy couches and we all felt so comfortable and relaxed we were still there a few hours later. 
The hotel has a beautiful relaxed comfortable atmosphere. The staff are very polite, helpful and so attentive. 
I would love to stay a night here to experience everything else the hotel has to offer. 
before going to the Westbury hotel we went to another 5 star hotel for afternoon tea. But after experiencing the impeccable service of the Westbury we will definitely be returning to try it out here. 
Thank you the Westbury for a lovely afternoon ",5,2015,06,28
203,The Westbury - Dublin,"My wife and I had five very wonderful nights at this hotel.  The location was perfect for access to the Gaiety Theater, Shopping & Restaurants. Great rooms and the food was super. We would stay here the next time we visit Dublin.
      ",5,2015,06,27
203,Facility and staff match the location - excellent,"We walked everywhere and this is the perfect spot... even when we talked to ""Dubliners"" and they asked where we were staying, they would nod and say...""great location""... close to shopping... sightseeing... public transportation... restaurants... bars... 

Staff were the BEST part of the trip. Concierge proved better than TA! we just relied on him....

Beds (and we're picky as we travel weekly) were soft with great pillows and quality bedding

Gym.. SUCKED... hot sweaty hole with old equipment. Don't bother. We work out 5-6 times a week normally and only went once.

Food ...5 star

Excellent value for what you pay... COMPLETELY satisfied",5,2015,06,27
203,I will definately be back!!,"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights - Although a little on the expensive side, it was money well spent and i would definately return. It is pure luxury.
Bedrooms were beautiful and spotless. Staff were friendly and very helpful and the location is spot on.
A great hotel worth visiting",5,2015,06,26
203,"Love, Love, Love the Westbury","The Westbury offers everything you would expect of a 5 Star Hotel! 5 star hotels carry an expectation of being a bit stuffy and over the top, but this was sheer luxury with a home away from home vibe. Great location, clean quiet rooms with comfy beds, and tastefully decorated and spacious rooms. 

The staff were extremely welcoming, and could not do enough to help, from check in to check out; especially the concierge staff who took care of our luggage each time. Shopping, nightlife and theaters are all on the doorstep of this prime location. 

Breakfast offered something for all tastes, from smoked salmon or full Irish to fresh fruit and yogurt or warm pastries. Afternoon tea is not to be missed in the Gallery and the Marble Cocktail bar is classy! We also had dinner at the hotel's Balfes restaurant, which had a relaxed family-friendly atmosphere, and their menu catered for all tastes and appetites... definitely a good alternative to eating out in the city.

Each evening our covers were pulled back, individual choccies placed on our pillows, dressing gowns laid out, as well as slippers, little touches that all add up to a great stay. 

All in all, a solid choice for a perfect Dublin stay, highly recommended. The Westbury is a wonderful hotel overall and we will not hesitate in returning again in the very near future!",5,2015,06,26
203,Convenient Location,"My husband and I treated ourselves to the Westbury, post a 15 day Ireland Tour. While we were nicely greeted by the Porter at the front door when we arrived, we did not find the check in person overly welcoming. That said we were impressed as we entered our beautiful, comfortable clean room. The bedding was nice, the pillows inside the lovely linens were yellow and looked dirty, and I couldn't get past it so slept without a pillow. The location drove us to the Westbury and we were not disappointed. Great night life into the wee hours of the morning, excellent shopping and pubs. Our room was about four floors above all the action, we were not disturbed by the music because the hotel had a second set of window which served as a noise barrier. ",4,2015,06,24
203,Top notch in every way,"From the moment you arrive you are greeted with a smile. Beautiful hotel, great location and excellent staff. Room service meal was outstanding. Everyone goes out of their way to make you feel special especially the wait staff in the dining room.",5,2015,06,24
203,A disappointing finish to a perfect day,"My review appears to have disappeared into the ether this evening so I will attempt to re-write it.  Myself and my sister checked in swiftly as we were on our way to my daughter's wedding in The Merrion Hotel.  On arrival to the bedroom we found it was a double rather thank a twin as booked.  Now I love my sister but am not prepared to sleep with her.  Reception assured me that this would be changed before our return that evening.  Following a wonderful day of celebration we returned to The Westbury and had a drink before retiring to our twin room...not so, STILL a double.  A quick call to Reception and two male staff called to our room.  It was late - around 2.30am.  They asked if I REALLY wanted the bed separated as it would take approx. 40 minutes to do so.  Now in my world, a twin room has two beds!!  Back down to Reception where apologies were given and an offer of a free drink.  It took 30 mintues before we were able to get to bed.  I was very annoyed at this stage as as approx. ‚Ç¨370.00 for the night one would expect better service.  Next morning we had breakfast and then attempted to return to the room only to find the key card was no longer working. It was only 11.10 at this stage. Back to Reception, more apologies.  On checking out I was asked if I had enjoyed my stay at The Westbury.  I found it incredible that no complaints had been logged for the morning staff to note.  More apologies ensued and the car parking charge (‚Ç¨25.00) was cancelled and an offer of coffee along with an assurance that a member of management would contact me via e-mail regarding this matter.  Guess what, to date - nothing!!.  What a disappointing finish to what had been up to then, a perfect day at The Merrion.  It really took the edge off the day - something that will never be corrected.  Would I stay at The Westbury again....never,  would I ever recommend this hotel to anyone.... NEVER!!!!",2,2015,06,23
203,Excellent Choice!,"I can't really add much that hasn't been said. Great location, clean quiet rooms with comfy beds, beautiful modern decor. 

All in all, a solid choice for a perfect Dublin stay. Highly recommended!

The food at the hotel was good, even if the service was a tad slow in bringing out our food. ",5,2015,06,22
203,Top quality hotel with service to match.,"We spent a long weekend at the Westbury, situated in the centre of Dublin but tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Grafton Street. 
All staff really helpful with a warm welcome at the front entrance and then concierge and check in staff with a genuine interest in making sure your stay exceeds expectations.
The rooms are tastefully decorated and spacious.
The afternoon tea is not to be missed and the Marble Cocktail bar is classy.
They even coped with an impromptu proposal for marriage by one of our group by providing us with a private area of the bar. A memorable occasion in a memorable hotel
Special mention for Stephen Maher who went the extra mile to make our special weekend.",5,2015,06,22
203,Perfect !,"Can't fault this one for location, service and quality of room.  Was a real pleasure to stay here.  Loved every minute of it.  Staff were terrific - friendly, caring and a joy to deal with. Would definitely stay again, worth the extra price.",5,2015,06,22
203,Perfect Dublin Hotel!,"We loved staying at the Westbury. Very modern, tasteful, and comfortable with excellent, personable service and a delicious breakfast. It was a relaxing oasis conveniently located with the hubbub of Dublin just outside the door. We needed a doctor while we were there, and the front desk was quick to direct us. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,06,21
203,Not all we hoped it would be....,"This is a hard review for me to write because I was really looking forward to our visit to the Westbury. Loved the website photos, and felt the vibe of the hotel seemed inline with what I was looking for (good service, upscale surroundings, ambiance). We sadly, did not have the quality of experience that we expected from a hotel such as the Westbury.

The Westbury was one of four hotels we stayed at during a recent trip to Dublin. For the price and quality we expected from a hotel of Westbury's caliber, we were extremely disappointed. Of the hotels we stayed with in Dublin, Westbury was the least friendly/welcoming of all and executed the poorest service.

Booked through Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts. Arrived at the hotel, were not greeted by the doorman but eventually found our way to the front desk. The elevator on entry floor requires a room key, which we didn't yet have. Wrestling heavy suitcases up the staircase wasn't the way we'd envisioned kicking our time at the Westbury off. Upon approaching the front desk, 5 people were behind counter, 3 of them looked directly at us and then immediately went back to what they were doing while the other 2 didn't even bother to look up. After another minute of not being acknowledged, I stepped a few inches closer and said excuse me. Someone looked up but didn't smile or say anything (very peculiar) and blankly looked at us. I proceeded to state we had a room and would like to check in. From the time we walked in the door up til check in, not one person working at the Westbury ever said ""welcome"", smiled or made any effort to make us feel welcome. They actually seemed somewhat put out by having to check us in. Despite there being multiple agents working and no other guests at the desk. At this point it was 2:30 and we were told our room was not ready and told to wait in the gallery. The gallery was very busy and had a great vibe so we welcomed the opportunity to sit. When we checked in with gallery host to get a table, of three ladies at the host stand, not one of them smiled. We actually began to joke about trying to get the the stoic staff to smile. We informed them we were waiting for our room and one of them gestured toward a table for us to sit at and later, upon our request, brought menus. Seems like she would have given menus to us at the time of seating since we had said we would like to get drinks/lunch. We had requested the front desk let us know when our room was ready, and showed them where we were sitting (one of the outer tables in front desks line of sight). Service in the gallery was fine, no effort to be friendly or welcoming whatsoever but not at all rude. Waitress was not interested in customer experience or providing the superior level of customer service you would expect from an upscale establishment. 2 hours later, after lunch and a bit more waiting, we finally went over and checked in again. At which time we were told our room was ready. This was disappointing since we had specifically requested the front desk inform us when the room was ready as we had somewhere to be and were hoping to freshen up and change beforehand. I had to ask waitress for our check 3 times over a 25 minute period before finally getting the check. It's great she eventually brought it, but at this point, from the time we had walked in the door, everything felt like work. Not what you come to a hotel marketed as a luxury hotel, to do. Before heading up I asked my brother to
I quote about the FHR package as nobody has mentioned us being an FHR booking or outlined the amenities. In previous FHR bookings, I've received a letter or voucher outlining where we could dine, where to go for the included breakfast etc. The front desk told him the outline was in our room already. It was not. This wasn't the end of the world but was slightly inconvenient since we were in the dark about the food & bev credit and dining options. When we arrived in our room (family room with two queen beds) the unspectacular continued as we discovered our only window faced the back of a building. We had requested a front-facing street view so we called down to double check and see if any view was available. We were told that two-bed rooms were only on the back side of the building and do not have views available. Fair enough, but it seemed odd nobody would have told us this at the time the request was made. 

I had high expectations of the rooms based on the online photos. I loved the decor and picked the Westbury because I believed it to be a top notch, high end hotel in Dublin. We were again underwhelmed. The good: the rooms was spacious and had plentiful toiletries and a coffee maker with quality pods. The bad: the room was completely run down- carpets stained throughout room, furniture was banged up and chipped, some dirty areas on walls (that when I wiped with a wet cloth, easily came clean), chipped paint, blanket on end of bed had snags all over it. The icing on the cake- beds left much to be desired- sagging/very broken in. Hotel appears nice from pics but is aging and in need of TLC, if marketing itself as a luxury property. Obviously, the location is prime and it's a fine place to stay, but for $400+ a night we expected more. Of the four hotels we stayed at in Dublin (others were The Marker, The Dean, The Westin) Westbury was the most run down, the least welcoming/friendly, and hands down had the poorest quality of service. Our takeaway was that the Westbury has a bit too pretentious of an approach toward their guests for an aging hotel with lackluster service.

** I will say that we had two great meals at Balfes and that my lunch in the gallery was great. Unfortunately, there are too many places that provide great food, and service, to spend time and money in a place that seems to have better things to do than tend to guests. I think a big let down was the staff taking he marvels perhaps too seriously for a hotel who's aesthetics couldn't quite justify the attitude. If we had it to do over again and I could get my money back we would stay elsewhere and only visit the Westbury/Balfes for a meal, tea or HH. This is disappointing as I work for a Dublin based company and was hoping to find a new home away from home in the Westbury.",2,2015,06,21
203,Dublin's Finest,"I just returned from 7 days in Dublin, and The Westbury was our home away from home. I highly recommend the wonderful hotel. While it is a beautiful place, centrally located to All Things to See, Do and and Eat in Dublin, The Staff make the Hotel. Every need was met with complete professional cheerfulness , spotless housekeeping , and the lovely Irish attitude of wanting to make your stay perfect. We received a overflowing fresh fruit bowl upon arrival, and marvelous Irish made Chocolates with our Turn Down Service each evening.It was a real joy to return to our room each evening, after a long day on tour in the countryside of Ireland. Please, Stay at the Westbury, you will not be disappointed.",5,2015,06,20
203,Perfect Location,"location a stones throw from the main shopping street in Dublin, this hotel could not be better located. Rooms are spacious and well equiped, and although located so centrally, could not hear any street noise from the room, would stay here again without hesatation",4,2015,06,19
203,Pleasantly surprised,"On several counts

The lobby dining area had surprisingly good breakfasts and lunches.  I mean we expected good food, but the food was delicious, really wonderful

Staff was helpful and incredibly friendly. Super nice

Rooms are very good.  Not great, but very nice

Can't beat the location and proximity to everything

We'd return",5,2015,06,19
203,Wonderful Westbury,"Stayed here fore two nights. Plush modern surroundings which are elegant and classy. THe rooms are comfortable and well sized and equipped. The breakfast couldnt be faulted and the hotel comes with a large amount of things to do such as high tea, spa and many places to dine. situated off the main shopping street in dublin makes it one of the most easily accessible places in dublin to stay in. 

I loved staying here!",5,2015,06,19
203,Great location beautiful hotel,Great hotel near many famous sites. Walked to trinity college and temple bar area. Stephens green is nearby. large enough room for a family of 4. Staff was helpful. Conceirge was able to respond to my emails about the area since I was coming from over seas. We rented a car as we were leaving Dublin since the area is very congested with many one way narrow streets. ,5,2015,06,19
203,First class hotel,Rooms were lovely and comfortable. The staff were very helpful. The doorman even came to find us a couple of blocks away to help us find our way to the hotel.  Many of the streets around the hotel are blocked off to traffic and there was quite a bit of road construction going on.,5,2015,06,18
203,If you're looking for over-priced convenience...this is the place to stay,"The Westbury is extraordinarily convenient for traveller's to Dublin.  It is however very over-priced...rooms varying by ‚Ç¨150/night  Breakfast is ‚Ç¨25...hard to justify when it isn't anything special...an Irish Fry  (eggs, toast, black pudding, white pudding, mushrooms, rashers and or sausage with a roasted tomato for good presentation) doesn't cost anywhere near that to prepare...other expensive places might charge ‚Ç¨15...and less pretentious ones nearby ‚Ç¨8.95.  

The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows.  The room was spotless and quiet.",3,2015,06,18
203,Best Anniversay Ever!,"Last weekend, my husband and I celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary at the Westbury.  It was the last day of a 23-day trip through the United Kingdom and Ireland.  I cannot thank the Westbury enough for making it such a special occasion.  The dessert in our suite with Happy Anniversary spelled out in chocolate was the ""icing on the cake.""  From the warm welcome and congratulations upon our arrival and the absolutely beautiful suite to the perfect location on the popular Grafton Street, it was the perfect setting to celebrate.",5,2015,06,17
203,Pure luxury,"We stayed in The Westbury as part of my 40th Birthday celebrations.  I was so looking forward to this as on many occasions we have had refreshments in the beautiful lobby area and on occasion, afternoon tea.  Suffice to say we were not disappointed.  From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty.  We were treated to champagne and handmade mini desserts on arrival.  The breakfast was divine.  I had French Toast with bacon and warm maple syrup while DH opted for a full Irish.  Even the atmosphere in the dining room was perfect, with no request too much.  We went for a walk the following day and I stopped in at a shop next door - when I nipped back in to leave my bag in our room, a member of staff took it from me in reception and told me to enjoy my day.  On our final day we went out for a walk around and it was sunny out so a member staff handed us water for our walk.  All in all a fantastic trip.  We will definitely return again to The Westbury - we cannot recommend it highly enough.",5,2015,06,17
203,Great location perfect hotel,"I cannot say enough about this hotel. The location is perfect, rooms are small but beautiful and the common rooms are elegant and gorgeous. Service in restaurant is a bit slow but we had high tea and it was amazing. The lavender crime pastry was incredible.",5,2015,06,16
203,Wish we were there right now!,"My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Westbury.  The concierge staff was excellent.  The location is perfect.  Our dining recommendations were also perfect. It helped that we had near perfect weather as well.  We were within walking distance to St. Stephen's Green, the Guinness Storehouse, and downtown pubs and cafes.  We even walked back from the Aviva Stadium.  One of the concierge staff helped us procure football tickets.  A highlight was sitting in the lounge in the evening looking out through the picture windows as the lights came on in the city enjoying wine or coffee and dessert. Can't wait to go back.",5,2015,06,16
203,great service,"The staff were very friendly and helpful, they couldnt do enough to help and nothing was a problem. It's a great place to stay and lovely touches like bed turned down, chocolate on pillow, slippers by the bed. It's a great location, just off grafton street.

203,"Location, Location, Location","Great location, spacious rooms, really good wifi, and hot showers!  First class all the way!  This was our first trip to Dublin and we couldn't have stayed at a nicer place.  Had everything we were looking for!!!",5,2015,06,14
203,Elegance Personified,"The Westbury is one of the Leading Hotels of the World, and this showed from the minute the taxi pulled up at the entrance.  Our bags were taken by an enthusiastic (if a little over the top) bellboy, who escorted us to the reception desk in the lobby on the first floor, where check-in was quick and professional.  The hotel has been extensively refurbished in recent years, and exudes sophistication in a classic, yet contemporary way.  The lobby/lounge is spacious and an inviting place in which to relax, whilst the hallways to the rooms are generously proportioned ‚Äì even the lifts had seats in them, a very thoughtful touch.  

Our standard room on the top (6th) floor was of the usual size for European hotels but was exquisitely decorated and furnished, with a decent enough view over rooftops.  Classical music was playing softly in the background, and I received an email practically as I walked through the door welcoming me to the room.  Complimentary mineral water was placed in the room alongside the tea and coffee, with wifi being fast and free.  As one would expect, the room was spotlessly clean, right down to the bedspreads looking freshly laundered ‚Äì I find they usually look fairly well used in many other hotels of a similar standard.

The bathroom was on the small side, and there was no walk-in shower or anti-steam mirror (two things any good bathroom should have, in my opinion), but it was perfectly adequate with nice amenities by Aromatherapy Associates.  If I have one small criticism (or perhaps three if you count the lacking two items previously mentioned) it was that the water pressure fluctuated quite regularly when I was taking a shower. 

Breakfast was very good ‚Äì an extensive buffet selection of continental and bakery items, with hot items available to order from the menu, all served in an attractive restaurant area with a relaxed business vibe (if there is such a thing!).  The waiting staff took time to explain the set-up, and we were made to feel genuinely welcome with all interactions with the staff.

There is no doubt that I would stay at The Westbury again if in Dublin.  Perfectly located in the centre of the city, professional and polished staff, understated modern elegance throughout ‚Äì all the ingredients are prime for a great experience.",5,2015,06,12
203,Nice spot in Dublin - good spacious rooms,"I was here on a business trip for one night.
Reception staff were efficient and welcoming.  The room was spacious and well appointed.  I found it hot and the aircon did not adequately cool it.
Breakfast in the morning was a light option - perhaps a bit too light considering the price
Overall a quick visit - would recommend for a treat.  Plenty of eateries and pubs around.",4,2015,06,12
203,Excellent,Wonderful room and a great location. I always enjoy visiting Dublin and enjoying some warm Irish hospitality. I'm delighted to say I wasn't let down on this occasion. Would certainly see myself returning,5,2015,06,12
203,Much better options in Dublin,"I stayed at the Westbury for 4 nights for business, as both the Marker and Merrion were sold out. As an LHW property, this should be a much better hotel, but it's not. Everything about it says tired, dragging and mediocre. 

When I arrived, no one greeted me or offered to take my bags to the front desk, which was a problem as it was up on the first floor and only one elevator was working. This was a problem my whole stay and took the stairs to the fourth floor each time, partially for exercise, partly out of frustration. My room faced the entrance and I had to keep the curtains fully closed because of the lights. 

The room was worn, the bed sagging and the bathroom minuscule. Overall, a really poor experience, not made any better by the location. I really couldn't wait to get back to the Marker the following week. ",2,2015,06,11
203,disappointed....,"We had high expectations for The Westbury and unfortunately what might have been a nice stay was tempered by problems at the start. The good:  great location, lovely common spaces, very helpful concierge, well appointed rooms, good breakfast.  The bad: small rooms, poor customer service from front desk staff, understaffed at breakfast.  Hard to shake off a bad start. We had two rooms - one for us and one for our adult son.  Short summary - the A/C wasn't on in our room but it was in overdrive in his. Bellman told us to give it 10 minutes to kick in. After 30 minutes of waiting for it to start working we called the front desk and they said they'd send in maintenance. Never came.  (We were in a bit of a hurry as we had dinner reservations but didn't want to unpack until we knew it was working). Visit to front desk.  They are on their way.  Never came.  Finally asked for a new room and got one - that was smaller.  Really???  From then on it just seemed as if the property wasn't up to the standards of what I'd expect from a ""Dolye Collection"" hotel. Hard to shake off a rocky start. Wouldn't return and wouldn't recommend.",3,2015,06,10
203,How a hotel should be run,"I chose this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and location. It has surpassed expectations in every way and believe me, I have high expectations. We arrived early and were shown to our room immediately. It was spacious, well lit and well equipped. The view was a little disappointing but I had asked for a quiet room so it was ok. Besides which, the location of the hotel is so central that we overdosed on good views anyway. Service was exemplary. Every member of staff was genuinely pleased to do his/her best. The recommendations from the concierge were very good. This is a 5 star hotel without pretentiousness, you get what you pay for. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. They pay great attention to detail, and to a discerning traveller it is the detail that makes the difference .",5,2015,06,09
203,A very good  choice ,"My wife  managed the art of choosing hotels  ect by TripAdvisor, learned her way  through  overratings and petty  complaints. We came  for  a week  in Dublin and we did  well choosing  the Westbury. Let's  tick the  boxes :location -it's right  in the middle and  with  easy access to most of  the  attractions. Room was very  comfortable size wise  and  amenities. Service as expected from  a five  stars  hotel -with  a smile  and  friendly manner. Concierge services deserve a special  mention for  good  advice and helpfulness. ",4,2015,06,09
203,A great hotel and experience,"Dublin is a warm and friendly city and staying at The Westbury makes sure you realize this even more so.The Westbury's location is perfect. In staying in a hotel that Is a member of the Leading Hotels of the World, you have a high expectation of excellence and The Westbury meets and exceeds these expectations.
We requested a change of suites,as a we were given a handicapped accessible suite in error. As the hotel was fully booked, we were assured this would be corrected by the next morning, True to his word, Mr. Adam Harrington,asst. guest relations manager, had made all the arrangements and had our bags moved to the new suite promptly and offered his profound apologies for this inconvenience. He adjusted our bill with a partial credit for the first night and sent champagne and strawberries and a most gracious note to our suite. We only requested that our suite be changed, Mr. Harrington went above and beyond to make up for any inconvenience we had experienced. Mr. Harrington is a most valuable of the Westbury team and a true gentleman.
The staff of the Westbury greeted us as if we were royalty and the only guests at the hotel. We noticed that this is how they greeted and treated every guest.
Ashley, a concierge, handled our e-mail questions before our arrival and arranged for a car service to pick us up at Dublin airport and transfer us to the hotel. We met Ashley at checkin and he was gracious, friendly and most knowledgeable.
Every member of the Westbury Hotel team is dedicated to making sure each guest feels welcome and is treated with the highest respect. We will always remember a wonderful stay at The Westbury and how they made a birthday and anniversary celebration even more special. We look forward to returning to Dublin and especially to The Westbury Hotel",5,2015,06,08
203,Excellent experience !!,"We celebrated our 10th Anniversary here. From arrival to check out , every detail was positive. The car was parked for us , bags taken to room, very quick check in, friendly and helpful staff and the room itself was immaculate, spacious and although facing onto Clarendon street, there was no ambient noise whatsoever.  There is not one detail which I could fault this hotel on. We hope to stay there again in the future. Thanks for a great experience!!!",5,2015,06,07
203,Fantastic!!!,"Beautiful.. Me and my husband loved this hotel it was beautiful. The staff wonderful, the rooms elegant and its in a great section of the city center. Lots of stores, pubs, and pastry shops so many sights within walking distance. 5 star for sure would definitely stay again  fantastic!!",5,2015,06,04
203,Perfect!!!,"Westbury Hotel is a gorgeous upscale hotel that reminded me a bit of the Fairmount Copley Plaza in Boston, but I think the Westbury is newer.  Everything was luxurious.  We arrived early and our room was actually ready for us.  The room was good sized with an extremely comfortable bed and finest linens.  We enjoyed breakfast here very much too, scrambled eggs with smoked salmon.  Probably the best we had in Ireland.  The hotel is very conveniently located.  I am not a good walker and could walk to just about everything.  I loved this hotel and highly recommend it.",5,2015,06,04
203,Excellent hotel in a fantastic location,"I surprised my fianc√©e with a night in the Westbury. Staff were very friendly and welcoming. Room was great, clean, spacious and comfortable.

Highly recommend and I would stay again for a special treat.",5,2015,06,04

The pubs around the area were great with good food and music.  We were able to stroll around at night feeling quite safe.,5,2015,06,03
203,Excellent location and attentive staff,"I've stayed at the Westbury twice, once three years ago alone and recently with my family of 5.  The first stay was faultless and 5 star worthy.  The last stay of three nights had a few hiccups that were eventually handled.  The location is excellent, right off Grafton and in the middle of Dublin.  The hotel is well appointed and the staff is very attentive. On our last stay we had two rooms.  I had booked a superior king room for my wife and I.  We declined the first room offered as we had just arrived from the US, were tired, and the room was right next to the elevators.  We were quickly moved to a quieter room.   Unfortunately the air conditioner did not work the first night in the second room.  I complained to the front desk as we left for breakfast and indicated I would like it fixed before we got back that afternoon.  We got back to the room at 6 PM only to find that the AC was still not working.  There was no note from the hotel or any indication that anyone had checked on it.  Maintenance was sent up and he confirmed that the AC was not working at all.  He told us that the AC system in the hotel was scheduled for an upgrade this summer, but that in the meantime there were certain rooms that just didn't have adequately functioning AC.  He offered a fan that would blow air over ice stored inside the fan.  We declined and asked for another room.  The situation was starting to get ugly until the excellent intervention of one of the managers, Adam.  He got us quickly to another room with excellent AC, gave us a bottle of wine, and offered to buy a round of drinks for the family.  The rest of the stay was great.  I'd go back in a heartbeat.",4,2015,06,03
203,elegant and comfortable,"Great location near Grafton street, good restaurants around and great shopping, also close to the green - which is great for summer nights.
Rooms well appointed but city small.
Beds on wheels make easy cleaning, but can be irritating to live with!  Lean on the bed to get dressed and see what happens.  Also, why the need to tuck the duvet in with Japanese bound feet tightness!",4,2015,06,03
203,Wonderful hotel in a perfect location.,"The Westbury is located just off Grafton Street, in a perfect spot easy to walk almost everywhere you would want. The staff are friendly, and the service overall was fantastic.

Niamh on Reception was so welcoming and friendly and excellent at her job. How lucky were we - upgraded to a suite..and it was fab. Robes and good quality slippers in room and nice glass bowl of caramels. Cocktails in the bar and selection of nuts..ingredients for a great appetite. We dined elsewhere. I was so looking forward to the breakfast.,,and it didn't disappoint..we got a lovely seat in the window.

The hotel itself is very smart and impressive.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful, so no issues here at all.  I stayed in a Superior room, which was typical of the standard of rooms you see in this category. The only reservation I have is, I would say this is a very solid 4 star, if that's what you're after, then this is the place to be.",4,2015,06,01
203,"Trendy, sophisticated, and worth the price.","We stayed twice at the Westbury on our Ireland vacation:  on arrival, spent 2 nights in Dublin, and on our way out we overnighted there prior to our flight.  Both times, we encountered superior service and a great atmosphere.

The hotel is very central in location, with walking distance to every major attraction (Guinness Storehouse is a long walk, everything else is quite close).  I would find it hard to find by driving, so would not recommend renting a car while seeing the sights in Dublin.  We rented a car the day of checkout for a weeklong stay in the country, and had a taxi take us to the city Hertz counter.  This worked very well.

The hotel gave us an upgrade to a Jr Suite on our second stay, prior to leaving Dublin, which was a very nice touch.

Tip: I would have breakfast at their restaurant once if you don't have B&B included.  Otherwise, its probably expensive to have breakfast there every time and you can find many places to eat immediately outside the hotel for a better price (but not the same upscale experience).

The hotel lobby sitting area is very popular for afternoon tea, and every seat seemed to be taken.  This is a place for locals to come for tea or coffee, which is definitely a good sign.

The concierge was more than helpful in helping us secure dining and collect our thoughts for the week ahead.  They gave us water for the drive on our way out and answered all our questions.  I would stay here again.",5,2015,05,31
203,Lovely central location,"What we liked best about our recent stay in the Westbury Hotel was the magnificent central location and just loved having afternoon tea in their first floor lounge !!

Also the concerige gave us some great recommendations for mighty fine Italian restaurants in the city centre",5,2015,05,31
203,"Great location, but not worth the $","We stayed at The Westbury for two non consecutive nights.  The first night we paid a rate of over 400 euros and our room was not satisfactory.  The carpet had stains, the shower leaked, the bathroom was oddly configured and the room needed to be updated.  We were disappointed with our stay.  The second night we paid a lower rate about 375 euros and our room was beautiful - spacious and nicely appointed.  I'd give the first night two stars and the second night four stars, so I'm putting in an average of 3.  

The hotel lobby is lovely and the staff is friendly.  We had dinner in the lobby bar and the food was good and the portions were large. Tip - if you are driving, the front entrance is very difficult to find because it is located off a one way street.  If you enter from Clarendon street it is much easier.",3,2015,05,30
203,Favourite Place for a Relaxed Drink before Dinner,The lounge upstairs in the Westbury is our favourite place for a very relaxed drink before going on to a restaurant for dinner. Lovely soft seats. Warm and cosy. Excellent staff. Terrific range of drinks. Top place.,5,2015,05,30
203,This Might Be The Best Hotel We Have Stayed In,"We were in Dublin for a meeting. Never having been in Dublin before, I wanted a hotel that was within walking distance to the meeting and very near the main attractions. The Westbury filled the bill.

Hotels in large city centers are not inexpensive, and that was the case with the Westbury, but the pictures and reviews made it appear to be worth it. Everything turned out better than expected.

The staff were all fantastic - polite and efficient. The reception went smoothly. Our room was beautiful and faced Grafton Street (more on that later). The furnishings were truly first class, the room had two very comfortable chairs, a table between them and a hassock (perhaps also called a footstool). The desk had multiple outlets for both 220 and 110; even the desk chair was comfortable. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom, as was the room, immaculate. Lots of plush towels, soaps, conditioners, creams, etc.

The main area of the hotel and the hallways were beautiful. There is a great sitting room just off the reception area that has wonderful windows and very comfortable seating. You can have meals and drinks served there as well. The dining room for our breakfast was also off the reception area. The breakfast was great - the most tempting offering was a full Irish breakfast - you have to try it. You also had your choice of other menu selections all cooked to order. There is also a wide selection of juices, pastries, meats and fish (really good smoked salmon), fruits, breads and cheeses.

The housekeepers did a really nice job. The room was kept perfectly clean, and the bed was turned down at night, along with chocolates, and the room refreshed. The Concierges were very helpful. Directions and advice were all spot on. You have to take advantage of their knowledge. The doormen and other staff were all very nice.

The hotel has a small exercise facility which is kept in good shape - if you would like a more extensive collection of machines and a pool, the hotel provides a free membership to an exercise facility across the street.

As the Hotel faces Grafton Street, you have some of the best shops in Dublin within a short walk. Window shopping at its best! We went to a play at one of the main theaters just a block away. St. Stephens Green is one block away and has beautiful gardens. We saw many different birds, ducks, geese and other waterfowl. The best was two swans with four very young cygnets. It is a relaxing walk around the Green. Trinity College is another nearby place to visit - make sure to see the Book of Kells. 

There is a hop-on hop-off bus that takes you around to all of the major attractions Dublin has to offer. While there are a few of these companies, we used the ""green bus"" as it had the most frequent buses. The Concierge can provide help with day trips. You might like the tour of the Blarney Castle and the city of Cork, and the Cliffs of Moher. Both of these tours include other stops as well. Other day trips include boat trips, Shannon, Belfast and other interesting destinations.

You have to go to at least one Irish pub. Some have live music. Ask the Concierge for advice as there are many around.

All in all - the Westbury may be the best hotel we have visited.",5,2015,05,29
203,Pure Luxury,"You feel pampered the minute you walk in the door.  The doorman was very friendly & helpful,  the desk staff was very welcoming.  The lobby sitting area was like being in a lovely fashinable home.  There is an area around the fireplace that made us feel like we were at home, warm and intimate.  I took a picture and sent it home.  Our room was quiet and comfortable, well appointed in every manner. 
The lobby was buzzing at cocktail time and we were waited on by a very dedicated group of young people.",5,2015,05,29
203,Great Location,"My wife and i had short break in Dublin, we both thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Location was great for bars, restaurants and shopping. Food was great too, some nice seafood for lunch. Rooms were fine and staff were pleasant. Recommended !",5,2015,05,28
203,Excellent Location,"The location is perfect for a weekend break as everything is on your doorstep. We walked everywhere during the day. We also used the buses to the airport as the bus stop was only  afew mins away with light luggage.

The rooms were well furnished if a little smaller than expected. We chose a standard double which had a back street view, but that was not an issue as there were not many classic views from the hotel as i understand.

We had breakfast on the first morning. Good choice not exceptional. Lovely decor. However it was rather expensive and we actually had breakfast at the pub next door on the second morning which was as tasty and satisfying if you like a full english breakfast and less than half the price.

I recommend the Cream Tea/ Afternoon Tea as was an excellent and the perfect way to start the weekend. Pricey but unusual to have such a top end well polished service in a hotel which was not particularly expensive.

Service in the hotel was adequate, not exceptional. 

I would recommend to other travellers based on location, and I had an excellent break in Dublin whilst based at the hotel.",4,2015,05,28
203,Trysor y Ddinas ('The city's jewel'),"My friends and I had travelled from North Wales to Dublin for a weekend get together where we could enjoy everything that the beautiful, yet historic city had to offer. Although we were spoilt for choice when it came to bars and pubs, we couldn't help but wonder what 'The Westbury' had in store... Eventually, curiosity got the better of us, and so we paid a visit. 
We were greeted by the assistant night manager, Colum, who was utterly charming, along with his colleagues who were exceedingly polite and couldn't do enough for my friends and I. 
The relaxed ambience of the hotel was exactly what we wanted at the end of a lively night in Temple bar, somewhere where we could chat, unwind and get away from the hustle and bustle of the city for a short while. 
When we were ready to leave, the ever so polite assistant night manager offered to arrange a taxi home, and thus took care of everything for us. 
Classy and sophisticated yet warm and welcoming... We will definitely be visiting again soon. 
Diolch yn fawr iawn. (Thank you very much.)",5,2015,05,27
203,Great stay at the the Dublin Westbury,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed staying at the hotel May 4-8, 2015. The service and food were excellent.  We ate in all three restaurants in the hotel and enjoyed every meal.  We also felt the staff were very welcoming and helpful. The location of the hotel is unbeatable, just a very short walk from Grafton Street but we were never bothered by any outside noise.",5,2015,05,27
203,Great location- unremarkable service,We loved the location of the hotel and the overall quality. The service at reception was less than accommodating. One of the elevators was down and the offer to show us to our room was rescinded when the next person walked up to check in. Not a big deal but wasn't exactly top tier service.,4,2015,05,26
203,Great location. ,"We stayed here as a surprise present for my husbands 30th birthday on April bank holiday weekend and stayed in a four poster bed luxury suite b&b. Upon arrival the hotel is beautiful, very classic elegant feel. We had tea and lunch in the main reception soon as we got there as our room wasn't ready, the food was very good. The room was nice with a good view but i didn't feel it felt like a luxury suite at all and definitely not worth the price, there wasn't anything special about it which was disappointing as it was for an occasion I wanted to pay more to have something extra special this was a let down. Nothing left in room for my husband on arrival acknowledging it was his birthday, again disappointing after reading other reviews. The hotel is in brilliant location however! Right off Grafton St which was definitely the nicest part with lovely shops, big green down the road, perfect for city break. First night we ate at the Wilde restaurant which was outstanding, great service. Breakfast also served here which had a great selection no complaints there. First night the room next door was extremely noisy at 1am so had to request reception to deal with which they did immediately and it stopped. Second night we ate at the Balfes again a faultless meal. Overall it is a lovely hotel in great location however didn't live up to my expectations. ",4,2015,05,26
203,The perfect getaway.,"I stay at the Westbury hotel twice a year and always look forward to it because I know it's going to be wonderful. It's like Christmas! It's that special. The staff are incredibly helpful and patient while the accommodation is stylish and very comfortable. The breakfast is one of the best I've ever had, with trendy healthy options.  It's one fault is that everyone else loves it too, making it difficult to get a seat in the lounge!",5,2015,05,26
203,Truly 5 Star,"Arrived in Dublin for first portion of two week stay in Ireland and spent the first two nights at the Westbury. This is truly a five star hotel in a fantastic location of Dublin - in the heart of shopping, Stephens Green, and Temple Bar (funky area with many pubs and restaurants). Everyone from the doorman to the bellmen to the reception desk clerks to the restaurant waiters seem to go out of their way to please, and John at the concierge desk (who has been there for years) is absolutely the best - if you need anything or help with anything, talk to John and he will make it happen. Beyond the service the rooms are also superb, and includes robes and slippers, and the nightly turn-down service is over the top. Breakfast was included in our rate and both the buffet selection of breads and fruit as well as the egg dishes were also 5 star. Not sure why anyone would want to stay anywhere else if in Dublin.",5,2015,05,25
203,Great Location,"This is a very good hotel, superb location and amazing staff, from reception to room service, they could not have been nicer, friendlier or more efficient. Room a bit small and annoyingly only had one bedside table but was well decorated and pleasant to sleep in. If you can afford it, upgrade to a bigger better than standard room but overall this is a great base in Dublin and despite the hotel being huge and a chain, it is surprisingly personable. ",4,2015,05,25
203,Dissapointing start,"Arrived at the Westbury to our 'city view' room, which we had paid extra for... To a view of a dirty flat roof!! Room changed on request to 1 floor above, marginal improvement. New room had large , obvious carpet stain & no working phone. Staff very pleasant & helpful but at over 300 euros per night per room ..need to up their game.",3,2015,05,25
203,Central Dublin Hotel,"Wonderful welcome and very helpful staff, very central location just off Grafton Street and near St Stephens Park etc. Breakfast excellent and variety of bars and restaurants within hotel and nearby. Would love to come again.",5,2015,05,22
203,expensive but great location and service,"The hotel is in an excellent location, you have 5 min walk to trinity collage, restaurants and it is in the center of the shopping area.
The hotel has a great lobby area and a beautiful bar so it is perfect for business trip.
The rooms are big and very nice, and the service is superior.
The only bad thing is that is expensive, I found a deal for 350 euro a night.",4,2015,05,22
203,Enjoyable experience ,"Myself and my family came to this lovely hotel last Saturday for afternoon tea.
We have been here before and found it now to be completely different.
However sometimes change is for the better!!!
We loved the new style of afternoon tea it was much nicer and we also have to give a mention to our young waitor Shane who made our afternoon tea a wonderful experience. 
A very smiley face greeted us before he explained our array of afternoon tea in great detail.
Hats off to the hotel for a lovely day out for the family and we really do love the new afternoon tea.
We will be back again",5,2015,05,22
203,A Superior Experience,"The Westbury Hotel is a beautiful high end facility.  The staff are attentive, helpful, pleasant and professional.  The location is ideal- close to Grafton street in the City Centre and within walking distance to a number of the sites this pedestrian friendly city has to offer.  The rooms are wonderfully decorated with many little enhancements.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars (if there was a 4 1/2 star option I would have chosen it)  is that the superior room was on a little on the small side compared to other similar types of hotels we have stayed at.  So if you need more space you had better plan on securing a suite!",4,2015,05,21
203,Best service in the best location,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.  Its gorgeous, its comfortable, its right in the thick of things. 
The best part though is the service. Never have I met such nice, friendly, helpful people at a hotel.  Not just the front desk staff either, doorman, bellhop, random staff person I grabbed to ask directions...
I will stay there the next time I'm in Dublin.

Please note: 
Free, fast, in-room wifi.
There's an ATM, a pharmacy and a Starbucks within a block.  
They sell Hop-On Hop-Off tickets at the Concierge desk.
The breakfast is fantastic, if on the pricey side (Duh, its at a hotel)",5,2015,05,21
203,Smack dab in the heart of Grafton St,"Stayed here for our final night in Ireland. The Westbury is in an excellent location, right off Grafton Street in the heart of all the shopping and restaurants! The hotel itself was very nice, staff were very helpful and the room was very clean. Exactly what you would expect for the price.",5,2015,05,21
203,The Westbury Hotel,"Visited Dublin on 5/9/2015 and stayed 3 nights at The Westbury,  The staff were extremely nice and the location was excellent.  The hotel was nicely appointed.  There are 2 really nice pubs right next door and several really good restaurants within walking distance.",5,2015,05,21
203,Great hotel,"The Westbury is a beautiful hotel, in the ideal location in Dublin, and has wonderful (large!) rooms.  It is worth a little extra money for the location alone.  My friend and I stayed there, in separate rooms, upon her recommendation as she had stayed there before.  The rooms were perfect, and it certainly had an eye for cleanliness (housekeeping even folded one of my shirts I'd left strewn on the bed).  The only reason I wouldn't give it five stars is that the staff experience was inconsistent.  The restaurant staff (in both Wilde and The Gallery) were borderline rude, and not friendly or particularly courteous.  I've been a server, so I am generally forgiving, but I do except exceptional service from a hotel of The Westbury's caliber, from all sides.  However, the concierge desk staff defined exceptional service.  Lukas was particularly wonderful, attentive, friendly, and gave me one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had (and I'm in customer service, so I don't say that lightly).  Between him and the location, I would stay at The Westbury again--but simply avoid the restaurants inside if I had to.  I could find a much better experience right outside the doors of the hotel for breakfast or tea.",4,2015,05,20
203,Wonderful Ideally Located Hotel with Impeccable Service,"We stayed at the Westbury on our first and only night in Dublin kicking off a 6 night Irish tour. We arrived off an early overseas flight and though our room was not immediately ready (we arrived at 10am!) the staff made us feel incredibly welcome, stored our bags and contacted us promptly once our room was ready.  They were able to make the accommodation well before the appointed check in time which while not expected was greatly appreciated. My first impression with the hotel was how phenomenally nice the staff were, from front desk to bell and concierge.  They truly have assembled a great team and have great and consistent training. Once we were checked into our room we found it top notch.  We were in a King/Four Poster room that had great windows, a large sitting area and nicely furnished bathroom with TV, tub and shower.  Nicely impressed. As we were only there one night we didn‚Äôt get a chance to dine with them but as we were heading out I hoped to catch a last pint in the entry level bar which looked inviting and exciting. Alas, by the time we got done out on the town another drink wasn't in the cards and we retreated to our room for a wonderful nights sleep. We did have breakfast on the way out which was lovely and found the front desk and bell staff to be equally impressive on the way out and as on the way in.  Highly recommended.",5,2015,05,20
203,A wonderful stay!,"The Westbury Hotel was a wonderful part of our trip to Ireland. We spent four nights there and the staff was very friendly and efficient, the restaurants and bars were outstanding. We could not have asked for better treatment, from check-in to check-out. A great example of Irish hospitality.",5,2015,05,20
203,Afternoon tea,"Had afternoon tea here on a Saturday afternoon. Absolutely 10/10. Excellent and attentive service, food was incredible and the drinks were limitless. Gorgeous atmosphere and we had prime location by the window. Will definitely be returning.",5,2015,05,20
203,Good location,"My husband & I stayed at the Westbury Hotel for 5 nights.  It was our first stay in Ireland.  The location was handy being right on Grafton Street and easy walking distance to most landmarks.
Breakfast was included in our room rate.  The buffet area was very small considering the number of people that it was catering for.  It would have been nice to have more fresh fruit available.  There were also hot dishes included in the breakfast rate, which was good.
The gym was very disappointing.  Aside from the old fitness equipment, it was far too small for the size of the hotel.  When I was there the water cooler had run out of water and there were no towels left.   
The staff were very polite and the rooms were spacious and clean.",3,2015,05,19
203,Five Stars ... times 10!,"I first stayed at The Westbury in 1988 ‚Äì and, in 20-plus subsequent visits to Dublin, I‚Äôve never stayed (or thought of staying) anywhere else.  That loyalty has always been returned tenfold ‚Äì at least ‚Äì by The Westbury‚Äôs Management and Staff. 

Thanks, this time, to Barbara Casanova for her personal note of greeting ‚Äì and the sumptuous gift of sweet treats.

However, as has ever been the case: The Concierge* Team, Wait Staff, and Housekeepers make The Westbury THE hotel in Dublin‚Äôs City Centre. [And that‚Äôs sayin‚Äô somethin‚Äô.]  

A longtime corporate educator who taught Leadership, Management, and Customer Service to C-level staffers of Xerox, IBM, Donnelley ... superlative service always trumps luxury, price, and even location. [That, too, is sayin' somethin' ‚Äì many of the world's best busking musicians, musicians, shops, restaurants, and churches are with minutes' walks of The Westbury. I recommend, even if you are planning to stay at the airport or outside the city centre: Revise your itinerary!]

*BEST of all: EDDIE ‚Äì a constant of the Concierge Team for all my visits (and since before my first). Last year (after a several-years‚Äô absence), Eddie greeted me from memory by name and with a hug, This year, he did so again ‚Äì and went to extraordinary lengths to ensure this visit (albeit one of my briefest at under 24 hours) was my BEST ever. THANK YOU, EDDIE!

To Tommy, Ashley, Adam, Aiden, and ALL the Concierge Team: I appreciate you!
YOU make The Westbury‚Äôs Five Stars twinkle ‚Äì always in person and forever after my stays. 

Go raibh mile maith agat

Beannachtai.

203,Outstanding Hotel with wonderful service and terrific Ambiance,"Upon arrival doorman handled luggage and it was delivered seamlessly to the room upon checking. The room was very clean and well appointed. It was very comfortable. The bar/lounge area was inviting and very comfortable and the food selection was excellent. In the evening, there was turndown service which went above expectations in replacing any used towels etc. the staff was very professional and always had a smile and we're aiming to please. We liked the hotel very much and its location by Grafton Street was perfect.",5,2015,05,17
203,beautiful hotel,I stayed here on a recent trip with my husband. We had a great time having afternoon tea in the gallery and having dinner in the restaurant. The hotel itself was magnificent. We were really impressed with how friendly all the staff were and no request was to much for them. they really went above and beyond for us. We wont stay anywhere else in Dublin we will be back as we loved our stay. keep it up,5,2015,05,17
203,fabulous experience,"Partner and I were in Dublin for short break and when we arrived to check in were told the hotel had upgraded us to four poster deluxe suite - such luxury! The decor, space and comfort were such a treat! Staff were really friendly and helpful and the atmosphere around the hotel was vibrant.
Really enjoyed the stay.
",5,2015,05,16
203,Fabulous,I spent 2 days here with my friend  . We were treated like royalty. The staff are superb. Any request was mangaged  so easliy. Afternoon tea a recomendation .A special mention to Mr Joseph Downing for making our stay so special. I will not stay anywhere else on my next stay in Dublin,5,2015,05,16
203,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here for one night last Tuesday. The staff were very helpful, my husband walked off with the ticket for our luggage but they couldn't have been kinder. They understood my predicament and helped in a very kind and friendly fashion.
The hotel is in a great area for foodies and if you want to shop you will be in heaven.
The breakfast is varied and freshly cooked..no hot buffet cooking under lights.
Would definitely go back.",5,2015,05,15
203,Lovely hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay here for one night. Very attractive, lovely service as the front desk, nicely appointed room, great location on Grafton street with lots of local pubs around it. Liked the food and service in Bafles restaurant. Morning breakfast was excellent in a beautifully appointed room with great food.",5,2015,05,14
203,"Elegant Hotel, Terrific Location","The Westbury staff is friendly and very helpful.  The water bottle at check in and check out is a nice touch, as is the chocolate on the pillow at night.  The hotel is in a fantastic location close to the top of Grafton Street and within walking distance of most of the major attractions in the city center.  The WiFi was very fast.  The gym is just a guest room converted to a workout room with free weights and a few old machines.  It is adequate for a work out, but could really use some new equipment.  Still, this is a wonderful hotel in a fantastic location for tourism.",5,2015,05,13
203,Excellent all-around,"Nothing to complain about here. Free wi-fi, quiet rooms, great breakfast, and in walking distance to everything downtown. 
Check out the Berlin cafe just outside the rear entrance for your coffee to go.",5,2015,05,13
203,5 stars,"What an incredible hotel, from the moment we arrived the vallet parked our car and reception  brought our bags to the room. This set the tone for a great weekend. This is an expensive hotel but it is well reflected and justified with its 5 star status. Rooms are big and well equipped and finished to a high standard. Afternoon tea and cocktails are a highlight of the hotel. Its' location is also perfect for a night out in Dublin as it seems to be within reach of everything. I would definatly recommended this hotel for a special occasion. Can't wait to go back.",5,2015,05,13
203,The Perfect Wedding Venue! Amazing Staff and Hotel.,"We booked our wedding after staying a night in The Westbury in 2012 - we loved the hotel and the staff there and knew we would be in good hands on our wedding day.

From first contact with Lindsay in The Westbury I really felt looked after. We weren't sure if The Westbury would be interested in hosting our small wedding of 40 guests on a Saturday, but they didn't bat an eyelid. I was a little overwhelmed trying to arrange our wedding in Ireland all the way from Australia but because of Lindsay, it was a breeze. She put together a package for us based on some key things that I wanted on the day which was fantastic - it just made things so much easier.

We stayed in The Westbury the night before the wedding and were so well looked after from the second we checked in. Joseph, the Guest Relations Manager personally welcomed us and ensured we were well taken care of. The Wedding day was absolutely perfect, I couldn't have dreamed of a more perfect day. Joseph, Lindsay, Majek and all of the staff who looked after us on our wedding day were absolutely fantastic - ensuring everything went perfectly right through until the end of the night. The staff are so thoughtful, they placed fresh water & little treats in our room so we would have something nice and refreshing to nibble on/drink when we popped up and down from our room throughout the day. Every one of our guests commented on how efficient and attentive the staff were, the quality of the food served and how beautiful and elegant the hotel is. 
The food was absolutely perfect and served so efficiently - some of the guests commented that it was the best steak they had ever had and all cooked to perfection.
The hotel is immaculately kept, so clean and so elegant. We had a suite while we stayed and it was beautiful and spacious.

I can't say enough how grateful we are to The Westbury and its amazing staff for making the most important day in our lives so perfect. I cannot recommend The Westbury highly enough as a Wedding venue, leisurely stay or business trip, no matter what the purpose of your stay with them, you know you are in good hands and will be looked after.

A huge thank you again to Lindsay, Majek, Joseph and all of the staff at The Westbury for taking such good care of us and our guests on our wedding day and for really going above and beyond to ensure our day was absolutely perfect!",5,2015,05,13
203,Westbury -May 2015,"This is an excellent hotel with a great location in central Dublin.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The rooms were comfortable and exceeded my expectations.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and business associates
              ",5,2015,05,13
203,Great staff.,"The staff really make the Westbury here, it's location is a little too close to very busy traffic, the cocker he mentions it is one of the busiest streets in Ireland ,unfortunately they do not mention this when booking.

Nevertheless it is a beautiful city styled hotel .
We really enjoyed it traffic aside.

The food is styled simply but cooked very well . A lot of restaurants in Dublin claiming fine ding believe it is the presentation that matters ,they clearly do not understand fine dining as it is about taste and flavour, many other restaurant we visited had flavourless food or poorly seasoned showing the insecure chef.
Maturity is present in all areas of staffing at the Westbury.

Would return.",4,2015,05,13
203,Superb!,"Being met by a top-hat wearing concierge team member at street level, just started off our wonderful experience at The Westbury Hotel. We arrived earlier than check in allowed, but were given water and a place to stow our luggage. 
The Westbury is perfectly located for a short stay in beautiful Dublin. Our room didn't have the most spectacular view (far from it actually) but we loved the amenities, lots of lovely toiletries, nespresso machine, turn down service and on it goes...
The Marble Bar served as a warm nightcap spot after dinner, also with great service. 
We're glad we stayed and would highly recommend if staying in Dublin.",5,2015,05,12
203,So thoughtful,I haven't stayed here yet myself but my two sisters and my daughter and my niece that just made her Cummuntion  yesterday are there as I write this. All my niece wanted for her cummuntion was to stay in a posh hotel and they decided on the west bury. My daughter skyped me too see the luxury they were staying in. Looks fab but really why I'm writing this is they  sent up milk and cookies and a teddy with a west bury jumper on it for her and a bottle of wine free for the girls. A little jesture that didn't cost a million but will stay in my nieces memory for years to come. Well done to all.,5,2015,05,10
203,amazing afternoon tea,my family treated me to an afternoon tea at the Westbury hotel recently. 5 of us thoroughly enjoyed every minute and every morsel.  we had so much food we had to bring some home and staff kindly packed the remaining food in lovely carry home bags - no bother at all.  Copious teas and coffees served all during the afternoon and it was great fun experimenting with the various teas and coffees. Def a cut above any afternoon tea Ive had  to date - a special afternoon tea for a special occasion with a lovely glass of champagne. !,5,2015,05,09
203,Hits the Mark Again,"This was my third stay at The Westbury Hotel and it was everything I expected.  Early 10:30am check-in (as requested); reservation made for dinner at excellent local restaurant Fire (by Timothy the Master Concierge) and directions to all the local sites.  Lunch at Baffles the second day of our stay was great and we were able to dine el fresco and people watch. On departure, a van for four people was arranged...with all our suitcases and golf clubs.  This is a grand old hotel (one of the two lifts was out of order for a couple hours), but it's the people that work there that make it special. Kudos to General Manager Vincent O'Gorman and his brilliant staff for making this one of the best hotels in Dublin and the world!",5,2015,05,09
203,Wonderful Hotel!,"My wife and I had stayed at the Shelbourne Hotel on our last visit to Dublin, and had concluded that it had to be the best hotel in town.  But that was before we stayed at the Westbury for five days this week.  This is not intended to berate the Shelbourne -- an excellent hotel -- but rather to sing the praises of the Westbury.  Close to Grafton Street and most of the must-see places in Dublin, the hotel is elegant, yet very welcoming.  Staff are attentive and friendly.  Room was very well appointed and although our room did not have a great view, it was quiet and comfortable.  And the food!  Some of the best hotel food we have ever experienced.  I rate it as high as possible.",5,2015,05,08
203,Pure Class,"What an amazing hotel. Central city, classy, friendly, top quality food and drinks, I slept like a baby. Its a luxurious oasis away from the helter skelter of a crazy Graton street. I'll be back for sure.",5,2015,05,08
203,Our first trip to Ireland,"The Westbury was a great location in Dublin! Staying on Grafton street made it easy for us to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go. Beautiful hotel lobby, very clean, warm and accommodating staff. We stayed in a Superior room. Our rate included a wonderful breakfast too. If I stay in Dublin again, this hotel will be where I book! ",5,2015,05,08
203,Relaxing ambience,"Had coffee with friends on a wed and came back for lunch with my husband on a thurs... Couldn't fault the service, all the staff were so welcoming and helpful. I enjoyed my salad and my husband enjoyed his rack of lamb. The meal was made special because of the relaxing ambience. Visited this place more than once and will come back again no doubt...",5,2015,05,08
203,Perfect Location & Delicious Food!,"The rooms are beautiful, the bed is really comfortable and the hotel was in walking distance to everything we wished to see. We highly suggest ordering the oysters - the presentation and the taste were phenomenal. 

Other reviewers mentioned that you could check-in early so we were hoping for similar luck when we arrived in the morning after a long red-eye flight...but that wasn't the case, we had to wait until the official time to check-in. I wanted to call that out so others don't have the same expectations.",5,2015,05,07
203,Great Location and good value,"This hotel was perfect for us. It was right in the middle of everything. The rooms were spacious and the amenities were great. When I go back, I will stay at the Westbury.
All of the best attractions were within walking distance. The up and coming dining/restaurant strip was right around back.",5,2015,05,06
203,"Ideal location, great service!","My wife and I stayed here for one night at the start of a 10-day tour of Ireland, so this was our first experience with Irish hospitality.  The Guest Relations Manager, Joseph Downing was incredibly courteous and engaging, and extremely knowledgeable about Irish history in general, and Dublin history in particular. He set out a good agenda for sights to see in Dublin, most of which are nearby this perfectly-situated hotel.  Luxury shopping just outside the door, not to mention the Book of Kells and Temple Bar within an easy walk. Our room was well-appointed, breakfast was first-rate.  There is a very comfortable and welcoming lounge area near reception, and what looks to be a nice bar, though I did not get to take advantage of it. I highly recommend this hotel, especially for foreigners in Dublin for just a night or two, and I highly recommend you seek out Mr. Downing to provide some context and background on the city.",4,2015,05,06
203,Great location,"The Westbury seems to be something of a Dublin institution.

It really is located perfectly whether it be for a business trip or for leisure. It was a little bit dated for my liking but I'm sure it is to other people's taste.",4,2015,05,05
203,Wonderful,"We stayed at The Westbury for 2 nights in April. We arrived at the hotel at 8.45am expecting we would be leaving our bags and have to return later to check in. What a surprise - a room was available on the fifth floor. The staff were very pleasant and professional, the room was clean and with everything you could expect, coffee machine, nice toiletries, free bottled water and a nice view down to Grafton Street. We will definitely return!",5,2015,05,04
203,Nicest hotel in Dublin!,I stay here every year with my mum! We have an absolute amazing time - wonderful staff who couldn't be anymore helpful. Great atmosphere and best location for a night out in Dublin! Pure luxury! Can be expensive but worth every penny!,5,2015,05,04

203,Top class,"We stayed in Dublin and went to punchestown races , the location and ambiance of the hotel was superb next to all the great shops the huge lounge is so comfortable , the rooms were first class maybe could do to be a bit bigger but short of re buliding the hotel nothing you can do , would deff stay again 
We ate in baffles the bistro downstairs - excellent and not too expensive ",5,2015,05,02
203,Wonderful,"Had a nice stay here. Joseph Downling, guest relations manager, greeted me as I checked in. After hearing of the long travel time I had, he sent an Irish coffee to my room! Greatly appreciated. There was a bit of a mix up in whether breakfast was included in my rate. I felt this took longer to fix than it should have. The overall ambiance and location certainly overrides this inconvenience. 
Rooms are beautiful and again, location is the best!",5,2015,05,01
203,Exceptional Service!,"This hotel is centrally located to everything.  There was not one reason to rent a car, or even take a cab.  The hotel is beautiful, clean and the staff will knock your socks off!!!  The hotel is definitely upscale, (especially at tea time) but it does not feel stuffy or uptight at all... rather quite the opposite.  
Upon entrance in our room we noticed the room was warm... we assumed it was because nobody had been in it.  So we turned the air on and went out to explore Dublin for a few hours.  When we returned the room was actually now hot.  Our air conditioning was broken and the room temperature was unbearable. We called the front desk and they sent up a service man within 15minutes.  He examined the problem and told us the air was broken and told us to open the window and he would send up a fan.  (we weren't very happy with this option, it was VERY warm in the room)  Fifteen minutes later a lady arrived with a fan and told us this was a Dyson fan and it would help and offered to send up a portable A/C unit.  We agreed to that but werent thrilled with the idea.  We asked to switch rooms and were told that they were booked.  Then our savior came!!  Adam came to our room and said they would be switching our room for us!!!  He said the room was WAY too hot and he would be happy to switch us.  He had us call the front desk when we were ready and he would send someone up to help us with the transition.  Ashley came to the room when we were ready, insisted to take our luggage without us helping, moved us to the fourth floor where the room was nice and cold, light music was playing, bed was folded down.... it was WONDERFUL!!  Ashley also stayed to help us plan our next day travel events, went above and beyond to find us the right tour for us, recommended restaurants for the nights dinner... he was amazing!!  Adam called us after we got settled to make sure we were happy and to see if he could send up some drinks for us.  Within minutes we were delivered a nice cold beer and wine!!  I have been in the service industry for fifteen years... and I have to say these gentlemen made a very bad experience, an exceptional one!!!!  It is very rare that people go out of there way anymore... its much easier not to.  BUT, it is obvious these men love what they do, and would not stop until we were truly happy!!! BRAVO  to your team, we were extremely impressed with the service we received!!!!  Thank you for making our final stop in Ireland an experience to remember",5,2015,04,29
203,Anniversary made special,"Recently stayed at the Westbury for my anniversary. Delighted with the welcome from all the staff. Had lunch in The Gallery and Bafles and both were very good. Pleasantly surprised by the turn down service. So convenient to the shops and restaurants
Looking forward to going back",5,2015,04,29
203,Very enjoyable stay,We stayed for one night in the Westbury in November 2014. It was lashing rain and I phoned ahead to be sure to get a space in the car park.  We pulled up at the door and we were immediately looked after with our luggage brought to reception and our car parked for us.  The staff at reception were extremely friednly and our room was ready even though it was only midday.  Despite the awful weather we have a wonderful stay at the Westbury.  Our room was spacious and clean and the bed very comfortable.,5,2015,04,29
203,nice,"My husband and I spent two nights.  Great staff, room large enough, clean and nicely furnished.  Nice linens and bed comfortable.  A pleasant experience and would stay again.  Staff truly are among the best.  Lots of nearby places to eat, shop, plus a grocery store about a block away.  Hop on / hop off bus convient.",5,2015,04,28
203,The best afternoon tea in Ireland,"I can't say enough good things about the afternoon tea at the Westbury. We have been to the Shelbourne, Merrion, Savoy etc and nothing beats the Westbury. The sofas are comfortable, the sandwiches and scones are amazing, the service is six star and nothing feels rushed or too much trouble. Just love this hotel. Can't recommend the afternoon tea with champagne enough.",5,2015,04,28
203,Weekend break!,"My husband and I enjoyed an excellent weekend at The Westbury and were not disappointed.

The staff at reception right through the complete mix of positions were absolutely charming.  Very efficient, helpful and in fact they all seemed to enjoy their roles and all had smiles too.

The breakfasts were amazing.  Great choice of produce and my husband was delighted to be served his favourite fish 'turbot' for breakfast!!!

Our first evening meal in the restaurant was very tasty, but we were disappointed that there were so few people eating there! Lacked atmosphere, even though the rest of the hotel was buzzing.

Our second evening meal was in the bistro balfas.  Lovely food and great choice of wines to choose from.   David who was in charge was excellent.  Very knowledgeable and welcoming.  He was most efficient and his staff also very pleasant too.  In fact when we were boarding our taxi yesterday, David spotted us and came out to say 'goodbye'

It's lovely to stay in a hotel where the customers are looked after so well.  Well done westbury!

Next time we will most certainly book afternoon tea.  Looked fabulous and I'm sure tasted fabulous!

Our only niggle was that the bedroom was far too hot and we struggled a bit with the air conditioning.  ",5,2015,04,27
203,Afternoon Tea,"A group of friends recently enjoyed afternoon tea in this hotel. It was absolutely fantastic. Food, service etc. was excellent. We decided to finish off the afternoon with a drink. I ordered a Bacardi + Coke and 2 Gins (Cork Dry) and 2 Schweppes tonic waters, only to be told that they didin't stock Bacardi (offered Havana or Captain Morgan instead), Cork Dry Gin or Schweppes tonic. Not good enough for a five star hotel. Needless to say we didn't stay for a second drink.",4,2015,04,27
203,Excellent location,"Had an overnight stay in a front facing room. Location is fantastic for walking to main shopping area and a 10 min walk to temple bar. The service from doormen, reception and waiting staff was second to none. Breakfast was an array of delights, so much to choose from. The only problem we had was the difficulty in getting to the front of hotel to check in. Dublin is a maze of small one way roads and we just got lost. We also didn't expect to pay 25 euro to park there but perhaps this is the norm in Dublin. ",5,2015,04,25
203,Excellent,Amazing week spent with my boyfriend. Perfect location as well. Walking distance from a lot of interesting places. Services received from the staff was impeccable. Turn down service was lovely with the chocolates. We really hope to return one day.,5,2015,04,23
203,Weekend break,"This was our first time staying here and came via other reviews. The rooms were glorious, very sumptuous and relaxing. The hotel lobby was a bit empty and not clear where you should go.  The location couldn't have been closer to the shopping centre and close to popular tourist locations.  We would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,04,23
203,St Patricks Weekend Trip,"Lovely hotel, friendly helpful staff (also helpful by e-mail before arrival), excellent central location with shops on the doorstep, five minute walk to temple bar, trinity college and close to lots of other main attractions.",5,2015,04,23
203,First Rate: I will be back!,"I loved my four nights at The Westbury.  The staff could not have been better.  Extremely attentive and helpful.  

The room (#400) is at the end of the hall and is grand.  Great four poster bed and while there is not much of a view (the rather ugly roof of another part of the building) the light floods the room and makes it warm and comfortable.  

If you are the kind of person who works from his room from time to time, this room can be a bit noisy during the day, as it is near a door marked ""emergency exit"" but in fact it is used by the cleaning staff to get to the service areas and you hear them going in an out all day as well as hearing the sounds of the cleaning cart (bottles, clanking).  But at night it is blissfully quiet.  
The concierge staff is fantastic and oh, did I mention the location, which could not have been better? In particular, for a guy who was new to Dublin, as I was - this was perfect.  But for anyone, really,  it is close to everything and so convenient. 

I heartily recommend it and I will be back.",4,2015,04,23
203,Location location location ...,"Besides location, this is a lovely old hotel full of helpful, friendly people and charm.  The rooms are small but attractive and comfortable. If the weather is bad there are several nice restaurant in house and there are world class pubs within dashing distance. I'd return anytime. In fact, I've been going there for over 30 years!  SlaiteüçÄ",5,2015,04,22
203,Short but very sweet! ,"Just had a flying visit to Dublin and stayed at The Westbury Hotel  - I only  wished I could  have stayed longer.

Room was excellently  equiped, the nespresso  machine wasn't  working but within 15 mins of me informing  reception this it was sorted.

Staff were extremly friendly, this hotel really is a 5 * , I've  stayed in many but this place does deserve their stars.

Location was perfect, I don't  think it could  have been any better especially  if you are looking to stay in the heart of the shops / bars / restaurants.

Breakfast  wasn't  included and we thought  30 euros pp was expensive  considering the room was 300 euros, Other than that no complaints. 

100% will stay there again.

",5,2015,04,22
203,Lovely,"I can't say enough positive things about our stay at this hotel.   The staff was wonderful, the rooms spectacular and the location was perfect. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin.   You walk out of your hotel to the heart of the action. ",5,2015,04,21
203,Nice hotel,"Great location, walking distance to everything: food, the sights. Nice clean hotel. Breakfast was great...we had the breakfast included with our room. 
Good service, friendly and helpful staff. Well done",4,2015,04,21
203,Great location but service needs improvement,"I stayed at the Westbury with my husband for one night in January 2015. While it‚Äôs a beautiful hotel and the location is hard to beat, we were disappointed with the service during our stay. The car park was full when we arrived and little assistance was provided to suggest an alternative parking arrangement. This was an unexpected and unpleasant start to our stay when we were expecting valet parking.  We made our way to the Stephen‚Äôs Green car park ‚Äì luckily we knew how to get there ‚Äì and then back to the hotel. The front desk staff were not particularly sympathetic and said the car park is first come, first served so there is no guarantee. Given how inconvenient and stressful it can be to find alternative parking in the city centre, I think this should be explained to customers in advance. At a minimum, the hotel should  have a better way of dealing with this when it‚Äôs busy. In our situation, we had to go looking for a doorman to see what was going on as there was no-one visible in front of the hotel.
Later that evening we were having a drink in the hotel lounge and the waiter spilled a bottle of tonic water on my husband. I completely understand that accidents happen but it‚Äôs how the staff respond to these situations that reflects the customer service mentality.  This situation was most disappointing as he barely apologized. When I mentioned it to the waiter when he came back to take another order, he responded in a very unfriendly manner that if it was a problem we could send him the dry cleaning bill. I know I could have asked to speak to a manager but we really didn‚Äôt feel like making a fuss ‚Äì we just wanted to relax and enjoy the lovely surroundings.
About a week after my stay I received an email from the Westbury asking for my feedback. I spent about 15 minutes filling in a detailed survey, taking the time to point out things that went very well and the areas where I was disappointment. I received no response from the hotel acknowledging my feedback.
Our overall impression is that it's beautiful hotel and a fantastic location, however the staff seem a little complacent about customer service. I think on my next stay in Dublin I will try one of the other five star hotels such as the Shelbourne or the Westin.",3,2015,04,21
203,Best service ever!,"We visited the Westbury yesterday for cocktails and what an experience, it was probably the best service we've ever had in any hotel. The staff were absolutely amazing, as were the cocktails, in fact we were so impressed that we went back again today for another visit.
If we thought the service was good yesterday it was even better today, the staff are among some of the friendliest we've ever met, from bringing us snacks to even complimentary chocolates.  This is one hotel we will definitely be returning to on our next visit to Dublin !",5,2015,04,20
203,Returning customer but a little disappointed!,"We always used to stay at The Westbury and haven't done so for a while as we have tried other hotels like the Shelbourne and the Westin.  In the past it was always our favourite hotel to stay in whilst visiting Dublin and although still a great hotel in comparison unfortunately we were a little disappointed. 
When we pulled up at the front in our car it took a little while before anyone came out to greet us and the concierge was not wearing the usual hat etc that makes you fell like you have pulled up to a 5 star hotel!
We were staying for 2 nights and our room was quite small and the view wasn't greg so we asked if we could pay for an upgrade however, we were told the hotel was full although we could change the following night if we wanted to.  This didn't seem worth us emptying our suitcase to then have to change room the next day for one day only so we didn't bother.
I just thought the hotel should have contacted us to apologise in some way and ws disappointed that they didn't !
Other than that the bar was great and the staff in there made great Apple Martinis.",4,2015,04,20
203,"Would be excellent, except for room temperature","Lovely hotel in heart of Dublin, right off Grafton Street.  Staff are very attentive, warm and welcoming.  Breakfast is really top shelf, with a la carte options plus nice continental spread.  Only suggestion would be to improve cut fruit selection.  Also had high tea on afternoon which was really lovely.  Rooms are nicely decked out with modern decor and good size quality toiletries.  Only major complaint was room temperature.  We stayed in two different sets of connecting rooms on the second floor.  Both had no cooling what so ever.  We mentioned our concern after the first night, but to no avail.  Too bad, otherwise we would definitely stay her again.",3,2015,04,19
203,Excellence at the Westbury!,"My husband and I stayed here for our 3rd wedding anniversary. When we first arrived at the hotel staff were more than welcoming, pleasant and extremely helpful! We were checked in promptly. Our room was beautiful and very comfortable and there was also a little surprise from the hotel team waiting in our room for us.The location of the hotel is so central in the city and everything is within walking distance. Overall our stay was very enjoyable, the staff here are always at your service which is a comfort. We would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone to stay in. ",5,2015,04,19
203,Great experience,Stayed at the hotel for a week.  A great location in center of Dublin near all the key attractions!  Really enjoyed the stay and our sumptuous breakfasts and friendly service.  Will definitely go back to this hotel!!,5,2015,04,18
203,Great Hotel and Perfect Location,"We only had a long weekend to visit Dublin and I'm so glad a friend recommended we stay at The Westbury. It's quiet despite just being steps off of Grafton Street, Dublin's amazing pedestrian only
thoroughfare that's chock full of great shops. And it's a close walk to some great sites, restaurants and pubs. Funny enough, our favorite turned out to be Bruxelles which was right next store and had great food, drink and company.

We had a superior room with it's comfy bed and pillows, Irish Linen, bathrobes, marble floored bathroom, free wifi, 24 hour room service which was a blessing after a late night about town and then a fabulous breakfast buffet. Also there's an outdoor cafe, nice bar and even a fitness center.

This is a true 5 star hotel with a wonderful 5 star staff. We'll return, hopefully soon.",5,2015,04,17
203,Luxurious,"We enjoyed our short stay in this luxurious hotel. All the staff were extremely helpful and couldn't do enough for us. Our room was of average size but very tastefully decorated with quality furnishings. The public rooms were very spacious and their breakfasts and afternoon teas were delightful. We never had a full dinner there so cannot comment on that. There are just three aspects that prevent me from awarding five stars: the price is high so you would expect a fair amount of luxury anyway; the second of the two lifts was out of order for our stay and whilst recognising that maintenance is necessary it made a big difference in a busy hotel and could perhaps have been completed overnight; and it is an extremely difficult hotel to reach by car. It advertises itself as being on Grafton Street whereas although it is only 100 metres off, if you are driving in from the docks for example you would arrive at the wrong side of pedestrianised Grafton Street and despite seeing the hotel you will need to take a very long circuitous drive across Dublin's one way systems to get there maybe 15 minutes later. Suggestion : if driving then phone the hotel and ask for the name of the small street on which it is actually located. Put this in your Sat Nav to avoid frustrations. Talking of frustrations they left two very small bottles of plain water at our bedsides which we assumed were free but were shocked to be charged a hefty price for them on our departure - at least hefty relative to the small cupful they contained - a bit cheeky given the room rate. On the other hand the WIFI was free and efficient. ",4,2015,04,17
203,Great location and very comfortable,"Stayed in a standard room for night.  Very comfortable room with all the expected inclusions liken well appointed bathroom, robes, slippers etc.
Has a feeling of quite a functional business like hotel, very efficient.  We were woken up by alarm at 3 in the morning but have been offered a voucher for afternoon tea as a no apology which was appreciated.",4,2015,04,15
203,Great location for business,A classic hotel in the centre of Dublin for exploring the local streets.  Great marble floors give this hotel a cool and classic feel.  Rooms are reasonably sized and the bathrooms are exquisitely clean and equipped,5,2015,04,14
203,Superb stay!!,"The hotel is easy walking distance to all the main activities. For foodies the location is perfect. The only mistake we made is we hired a car at the airport. We should have hired the car when we were leaving Dublin for the rest of our Ireland Holiday. You do not need a car if staying at this hotel. Our experience it is quiet, well maintained with exceptional service.",5,2015,04,14
203,"Wonderful hotel, honest staff","I recently stayed at the Westbury Hotel back in February 2015, and had a wonderful stay.  Stay was very pleasant, and the hotel was clean.  It wasn't until after my stay that I learned how wonderful the employees are at the hotel.  I left an envelope of money (a lot of money) and some prescription pills on one of the beds, which the cleaning staff found.  I received an email from the Accommodation Team Leader of the hotel, saying that she found the items.  She personally mailed it back to me.  All of the staff are very honest, and I have absolutely no reservations on staying at that hotel again.  Well done, Westbury Hotel!",5,2015,04,14
203,It's the little things that make the difference,"Travelling to Dublin for a night with my husband and young daughter we were tossing up between the classic style of the Shelbourne and the modern opulence of the Westbury and the Westbury has proven to be the most amazing choice. 
On arrival our suite wasn't quite ready so we took a walk and were called within half an hour to say the room was available. Once upstairs the room was beautiful, fresh and clean and an amazing welcome pack of gourmet chocolates, biscuits and drink was waiting for us with a hand written note by the lovely Barbara who was our check in host. Next to the note was a beautiful 'Westbury' teddy bear for our daughter. What an amazing touch and welcome for our family. 
Later a fruit platter and water brought to our room...
Amazing service and amazing place. Thank you Barbara and the Westbury. ",5,2015,04,13
203,5 Star Excellence,Five Star service at it's best.  Perfect location for being in the heart of the city and plenty of bars / restaurants nearby.  Room was perfect in terms of comfort / cleanliness and space. I couldn't find fault with anything,5,2015,04,13
203,First rate hotel,"My daughters and I spent 3 nights at the Westbury. It was outstanding. Great service, great location, beautifully decorated, comfortable beds, etc, etc. Particularly given the price (which was, I thought, incredibly reasonable), this was simply an incredible little hotel. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2015,04,12
203,Rename it The BESTbury...The Westbury is THE finest hotel in Dublin!,"Recently stayed at The Westbury for four nights over Easter holiday.  The property is lovely in the best location close to wonderful places to dine and shop.  The service from the professional staff cannot be beat.  Everyone we encountered was ready and happy to please and always with a smile on their face.  Siobahn and Eddie both helped with questions prior to our arrival, Tommy and Laura from front desk as well as Adrian at the front door were the epitome of professionals.  I wish I'd written down all of the names of the staff who we met because they were all just fabulous.  The property is kept spotlessly clean, we noted staff shining the bannisters when we left bright and early one day!  We had two deluxe King rooms and although they were slightly different in layout from one another, they were both spacious with delightfully comfortable beds.  The bathrooms were large with very nice products (shampoo, lotion, etc.)  We had advance purchased rooms with hot breakfast included and couldn't have been happier with the delicious spread that was put out each day. The continental was more than enough (juices, cereals, yogurt, fruits, cheeses, coldcuts, pastries, rolls, etc.) but we indulged in delicious hot selections as well (eggs with potato cakes, crepes, etc.).  The buffet was kept well stocked all throughout the appointed breakfast hours.  Most mornings we were the first ones there as we spent each day driving to other parts of Ireland, but on the last morning we slept in and got to breakfast towards the end and despite much larger crowds (I guess most people sleep in on vacation!  Ha! We are normally on the go!) none of the trays were picked over or empty-the staff was always monitoring to make sure all the choices were available (the sign of a well managed dining room!).  We had cocktails in the lovely lounge one evening and it was very pleasant and comfortable.  Room service for dinner one night was also excellent.  One of the nicest ""extra"" touches were the Wesbury bears that they brought for the kids!  So adorable and even though my ""kids"" are really young adults, they both loved their bears with their little Irish sweaters!  What a sweet keepsake! My daughter also celebrated a birthday while we were at The Westbury and we found a scrumptious chocolate egg full of little chocolate candies with a Happy Birthday card for her when we returned one night.  These are the types of things that make you remember a hotel and trip with fondness.  We are fortunate to live near Boston where there is another Doyle collection hotel so we know from that experience that this exclusive chain is stellar.  Kudos to management at The Westbury in Dublin.  I will recommend this hotel to everyone I know as it was a wonderful stay in every way.",5,2015,04,12
203,Location,"The location of this hotel is perfect couldn't be closer to Grafton St. The staff greeted us warmly when we arrived and our car was taken away for parking. Check in was very smooth and friendly. The room was decorated very well and lovely touches with the water and toiletries provided - much more generous than other 5 star hotels I have stayed in. Only two reasons I left a little disappointed - firstly, I was asked which newspaper I would like for the morning and made my choice but none was delivered and secondly, the bed was two single beds attached very poorly which left a big dip in the middle of the bed and led to an uncomfortable night's sleep. Both issues were raised after I settled the bill at check out and was told it was noted so that it wouldn't happen again if we chose to return.",4,2015,04,12
203,The Westbury is Dublin's jewel in its crown,"The Westbury is so centrally situated in Dublin and the d√©cor is beautiful, rooms very comfortable and  kept immaculately clean and staff are wonderful.  Mouth watering food and service in restaurant exceptional - well worth a visit.",5,2015,04,12
203,Gluten free Afternon Tea - service did not meet standards set previously,"Having previously been to the Westbury for afternoon tea I was very much looking forward to another treat at the Westbury.  Unfortunately, it appears that standards have slipped since my previous visit to the hotel.  When I go to a five star hotel I expect five start service.  On this occasion this was not delivered.  Our server did not indicate what was part of our afternoon tea when it arrived, which is usual course of practice.  Personally I would prefer that the sandwiches were also part of the afternoon tea cake stand but there seems to have been a move away from this at the Westbury.  Service was slower than usual, and we had to look for our servers several times, which is unusual given that normally five star service dictates that the servers are constantly available to you.  Some of the service was clumsy, when tea arrived at our table.  
Although the service was not up to standard, I could not fault the standard of the food.  The gluten free options were generous and tasty.  However, on this occasion the service left a lot to be desired and therefore was not good value for money.",3,2015,04,11
203,Great Location 5 star lobby but more like 4 star rooms.,Really great location right in the centre of Dublin. It is slightly set back from one of the main shopping streets so no noise. The lobby area and staff offer 5 star service although the rooms are nothing special (compared to other 5 star hotels). They are adequate and have everything you could need but in reality are more four star. Hot breakfast was not included in package and was EUR 25 but was delicious. They also offer a more continental cold breakfast. Always plenty of taxi‚Äôs outside. I would be happy to stay again although I feel you could get better value elsewhere. Nevertheless it enjoyable stay. Free WIFI was a nice touch.,4,2015,04,10
203,Excellent!,We loved The Westbury.  It's located just off of Grafton in a central location.  The rooms are immaculate and the beds were comfy.  We loved the turn down service and the chocolates.  The sitting area  next to the reception desk is elegant and we enjoyed our continental breakfast there each morning.,5,2015,04,08
203,Great place to stay in Dublin,A big family trip for the Easter weekend and everything at the Westbury exceeded our expectations. Check in smooth and doorman/conceirge we just fantastic - nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was great with good prompt service. Location is fantastic with all places you need in central Dublin in walking distance. Highly recommended.,5,2015,04,08
203,Brilliant hotel,"The hotel is located in the heart of the city and a footstep of Grafton street and walking distance away from transport, shops, restaurants etc. The hotel overall was brilliant, very luxurious, quiet and modern. The staff where always of great help and countless times willing to help us whenever needed. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this hotel to everyone.",5,2015,04,08
203,What an amazing hotel,"Arrived at this amazing hotel, we pulled up, our car was taken for us and parked, bags were taken from us and brought up to the check in desk, the hotel was just gorgeous, with such friendly staff.  The location of the hotel was in the heart of Dublin which was great.  The rooms, bar and overall hotel was just gorgeous and we will be coming back to this hotel in the future.
thank you for such a lovely stay ",5,2015,04,08
203,Enjoyable stay...,"The hotel was quite nice, the rooms were clean and updated but the hotel itself was a little bit tired. The location was superb and the service fulfilled all of your needs. A really enjoyable stay for anyone that wants to visit Dublin!",4,2015,04,06
203,Certainly one of the very best hotels in Dublin,"Not my first choice initially, but I booked it, and once I arrived, I was so happy I did. Right off Grafton Street, and near Trinity College, this hotel has amazing staff and service, from the front desk, bell staff, concierge, waitstaff, I mean they couldn't have been any better, and that's hard to say normally.

Worth every euro.",5,2015,04,05
203,"Nice hotel, great service and convenient central location","The hotel is centrally located, off the main pedestrian shopping street, walking distance to most central areas of interest. The service is great, friendly and helpful. The room was clean, very nice and comfortable. Membership in their loyalty program gives you free wifi in addition to other things.",5,2015,04,04
203,Excellent location,"The location of this hotel was excellent for all activities.  Otherwise, I would only give this property an average rating.  The front desk staff was not particularly friendly or welcoming.  I will say that the bell staff and chamber maids were more accommodating and friendly.  The decor here is average and I was not a fan of the revolving door entry.  Our room was clean, but seemed a bit dated.  We did appreciate the mineral water and in-room tea service.  I can't quit put my finger on it but, I just never felt comfortable here.",3,2015,04,04
203,Incredible experience,"I stay in hotels every other week for work, and this has been one of my all time favourites. Not only is it a beautiful setting with great amenities and a stellar location, it has all the advantages of a luxury hotel but with a super-friendly, helpful and approachable staff too. The food here is exceptional, and small things like full-size hair dryers, great shampoo, quiet rooms and large tvs really make the difference here. Cannot recommend it highly enough",5,2015,04,04
203,Perfect location and exceptional service,"We stayed at the Westbury Dublin for a weekend in March. The hotel was excellent with an extremely high level of customer service from first arrival, check-in by Kimberley, right until departure, check out by Niamh. Tommy the concierge was particularly helpful and polite. Indeed all the employees were. 

The room was exceptional, fairly traditional decor but with a contemporary twist and decorated to a high standard. The bed was big and comfy. The bathroom was a good size with lovely complementary toiletries and the shower was powerful. 

Some good additional extras included coffee machine, a full sized hair dryer, reasonable sized table and seating area, plenty of wardrobe space and a full length mirror.

The location of the hotel is perfect, although just off Grafton Street it is tucked away enough to be quiet on a night. There are two bars near the hotel main entrance, but again no disruption from them. We didn‚Äôt use the Marble bar however the adjoining Balfes bar / brasserie provided a pleasant environment for a drink. 

We had breakfast each morning which was exceptional. Superbly cooked Irish breakfast in a pleasant restaurant was a perfect way to start the day. They also had a continental buffet which had some excellent pastries and delicious fruit juices. 

For a sightseeing visit the location is perfect. It is a short walk to the castle, main shopping areas, St Stephens Green and the Temple Bar area . The hotel is a  5 minute walk to the nearest hop on, hop off bus stop which can be used to get to other attractions.

Overall the hotel is in a perfect location and the experience during our stay was exceptional.",5,2015,04,02
203,"Great location, good rooms, but lounge unwelcoming unless you order food or drinks.","The location of this hotel is hard to beat with Grafton Street right next door.  It is a little hard to find, especially if you are driving, but after a few nights it starts making sense.  We arrived early, after a transatlantic flight and the room was not ready.  No problem, let's hang out in the lounge for a while...Oh well, the seating at the window from the brochure had a reserved sign and all the other seating areas were really set for food and drink.  You cannot sit in the lounge without having a waitress asking you if you want to eat or drink something.  They should really make the lounge more welcome to guests.  If not for the lounge, I would have given a better rating.",3,2015,03,31
203,convenient hotel in the heart of shopping district,"Our team stayed in Westbury dublin for business purpose and we like the facility of their conference rooms suitable for our purpose. Very convenient location as it is located in the middle of shopping district which seems to be the high end brands. Breakfast buffet selection isnt much but they will serve you a nice full irish english breakfast. Dublin is a very small city and most of the buildings only have 4-5 flrs, if you are coming from city like Dubai, NY or Hongkong, DO NOT expect much, nothing much to do but if you are coming on vacation, best to visit country side such as Malahide and Carrie.Do not expect customer service too, waiters, receptionist do not really smile",4,2015,03,31
203,Expect better,"I am in Dublin frequently and have previously been to the Westbury for tea where the service left a lot to be desired. 

Decided to try staying here and was totally underwhelmed. 

The location can't be beat for a tourist wanting to walk around Dublin, for a business person it is a pain as it is difficult to get taxis and takes awhile to get to the hotel in the morning because of all the road restrictions. 

The check-in staff should get remedial training as they were surly and did not even try to be accommodating to reasonable requests around early and late checkin/out. 

 ",3,2015,03,31
203,Wonderful Hotel in Downtown Dublin!,"This hotel is perfectly located for exploring Dublin. It is right in the middle of most of the big attractions. Within 15 mins or so you can walk to the river, Trinity College or the Green. The hotel is also peaceful and quiet for its location. The rooms are clean and modern. I can't wait to stay at this hotel again.",5,2015,03,29
203,Another 5* visit,once again the Westbury delivered. Arrived at 12 and our room was ready. Luggage delivered while we had lunch. This was a birthday treat so lovely tray of delights awaited us along with a card!! Cocktails lovely at 5pm special thanks to Colm in the bar for dealing with a spilt drink and that embarrassment with great sensitivity! And replacing the drink!! A lovely 24 hrs as always! Do go you won't be disappointed,5,2015,03,29
203,Nice hotel,Great location. Rooms small but clean and well appointed. Staff very helpful and eager to please. Makes a difference. Beds turned down at night with lovely choc and water placed by bedside. Rooms way too hot though. Air conditioner noisy. Would stay there again though just for the location - nice for a city break.,4,2015,03,29
203,Luxury hotel at great location,"The westbury hotel is located at a great location, right in the center of Dublin, friendly staff, bathroom equipped with all you need. The only downside I experienced was that the sound isolation was poor and voices from inside the hotel ( next room's tv, people talking at the corridor).",4,2015,03,28
203,Fantastic Hotel,"Just had a lovely stay at the Westbury for my sister's birthday.  Fantastic hotel in every way.  Wonderful location for shopping etc, beautiful room and very helpful, friendly staff.  Will return again for another stay for sure.",5,2015,03,27
203,"Afternoon tea,a delight!","My daughters recently brought me to the Westbury for afternoon for Mothes Day.It was a delight  from beginning to end.You have to book in advance and I would recommend requesting a table by the window.The staff were very helpful and plesent and could not do enough for us.The savoury section was delicious and we ate everything,this was followed by warm scones served with jams and cream.Yummy!!
The fancy selection followed then,everything looked too pretty to eat but we struggled on and tried a few things,again all were delicious.
As we were all full and happy it seemed a shame to leave all the lovely cakes that were left so the waitress kindly said she would box them up to take home.
I would recommend this experience to anyone who has not tried afternoon tea before.",4,2015,03,27
203,Westbury Doublin,"The location was perfect for shopping and restaurants.  Our room was very nice and included a breakfast of choice from the menu.  We had an issue with our reservation that had been prepaid, but the front desk worked it out for us with no problem.",5,2015,03,25
203,An excellent and welcoming hotel for those who want to enjoy their stay in Dublin,"We spent three days in Dublin last week, the first two being Sunday-Monday, and then again on Thursday. Why did we go back? Easy answer: Every reason you can think of. The facility is centrally located in Dublin where the fun and culture is. A short walk to anywhere from great food and taverns, to Trinity and the museums. The staff are extremely friendly and professional, welcoming and spontaneous. Top flight. The rooms were well cared for and well stocked, nothing amiss. The beds were extremely nice, which is difficult for me as I suffer from sever back problems. The food. Great breakfast and very consistent quality. Nice selection, friendly waitstaff. The concierge personnel were helpful and knowledgeable too, making plans for us and advising what the best course of action might be when choosing among several options. While prices were quite high on the first two nights, that was simply because it was just before St. Patricks Day on Tuesday. When we booked for Thursday, we paid only 1/3 the price so you really have to be mindful of what's going on in Dublin when you book. Prices will be based upon supply. It's no different than anywhere else, but it can get pricey for those traveling on a budget at busy times. We didn't try the amenities so no comment can be expressed regarding those. I would not expect quality to be any different however. We definitely plan to return on day and look forward to seeing the friendly faces once again.",5,2015,03,24
203,Truly 5 star,"The Westbury is located in the centre of Dublin, just off Grafton Street. Perfect location to enjoy all Dublin has to offer. 
This is truly a 5 star hotel, as opposed to somewhere that might have once been.... Excellent service, rooms are well equipped and of a very high standard.
Highly recommend!",5,2015,03,22
203,Just superb,"What the perfect way to start a visit to Ireland. The hotel staff is wonderful and helpful. The rooms are well appointed and very clean, very nice. It is quiet and relaxing. It is at the center of everything, Grafton St. is right out the door. When I return to Ireland we will start in Dublin for the opportunity to stay at the Westbury!",5,2015,03,22
203,Luxury,"Nicely centrally located, a 5 Star luxury. Fab rooms & lovely bars. We stayed here & had afternoon tea which was very good. We weren't sure whether to go for one or two. If not big eaters definitely have only one to share or u will b too full. Nice selection of Teas & Coffees & Excellent service. Stay was comfortable too. Parking s available too which is handy. Seen they were opening ""Balfes"", should try it soon. ",5,2015,03,22
203,Buzzy,"Dublin has some fine hotels.  The Intercontinental is great but us too far out of town, the Shelbourne is great but lacks public areas that are not bars and the Merrion is a nice treat but maybe a bit too genteel.  My favourite particularly for leisure is the Westbury.  It is slap bang in the middle of the Grafton Street area, close to some great pubs such as McDavid, great restaurants such as Dade Street Social, has great Irish staff (especially Niamh at reception), great Irish ownership in the Doyle Collection and has a great buzz at all times.  What sets it apart is the lobby/cocktail area which is spacious, well appointed and a great place to relax and people watch.  More of a leisure than a business hotel but a great place to stay.  Only nit, thin walls!",5,2015,03,21
203,superb location,"We stayed 3 nights and couldn't fault this wonderful hotel. The location is amazing just off Grafton Street and within minutes walk of pubs, restaurants as well as Trinity College and St Stephen's Square. All the staff were outstanding and welcoming. The Hotel has beautiful d√©cor and the King room was very spacious with an extremely comfortable bed, which is what you need after a long day of sightseeing.",5,2015,03,20
203,Pure Excellence...,"if you want to stay in a 5 Star Hotel in Dublin then the choice is very simple, Look no further, choose  ""The Westbury"". 1st Class in every way. You really will not be disappointed. Our room over looked the front of the hotel & for us it was perfect.",5,2015,03,19
203,Home away from home,The Westbury is my home away from home when visiting Dublin from Boston. Warm welcome home from long time staff members Eddie and Tommy. Exceptionally convenient location with top shelf staff across the board. Enjoyed a fabulous meal in the Gallery. Wouldn't think of staying anywhere else !,5,2015,03,19
203,Comfiest bed ever,"This hotel is lovely, the rooms are clean, spacious and the beds are very comfy and very large, the staff are excellent and very helpful and check in and out was a breeze. 

Only small criticism is that the valet parking can take a while to collect and take your car from you. ",5,2015,03,18
203,Best hotel in Dublin,"We travel frequently to Dublin and, over the years, we have tried all the top hotels there including The Shelbourne, The Conrad, The Merrion and The Fitzwilliam and I have to say that all of them are very good. However, The Westbury stands out as the best hotel in the city. We cannot fault anything...the staff are superb throughout the entire hotel....friendly, helpful and it is certainly 'service with a smile'.  The rooms are luxurious, quiet, very clean and the beds are extremely comfortable. Of course, the location of the hotel is superb too.

The Business Centre is excellent with fantastic (new) Apple Mac computers.

Breakfast is always excellent and, although it is busy, especially at weekends, the staff handle everything so well and service is very prompt.

There's always a great buzz in the hotel, whether at the first floor lounge or in the bar/restaurant Balfes (food is great there too!) 

Last year we had to make last minute arrangements to stay in Dublin (due to family bereavements) and both times were extremely busy times  in Dublin with hotel rooms in short supply. I cannot thank the management at The Westbury enough for accommodating us and looking after us so well at difficult times.

We cannot fault this hotel and it feels like ' home away from home' for us now.",5,2015,03,18
203,A Perfect Afternoon Tea,"This is a hotel with service and an experience which is second to none. If you have someone in your life that deserves that special treat, this is the place to bring them. Definitely would give this 5/5.",5,2015,03,17
203,Excellent choice in Dublin.,"One week stay, family vacation for March break. Superb location, nice blend of contemporary and traditional design elements. Stayed in a large luxury suite with connecting room for my twins, which was an excellent option for a family of four. Very good value compared to other European capitals. Would not consider staying anywhere else in Dublin. Will definitely return.",5,2015,03,17
203,Perfect Location,Stayed here for a girls weekend and what a great location! Lots of great pubs and restaurants within walking distance. Hotel was very luxurious but because of the location worked perfectly for our weekend.,5,2015,03,16
203,Excellent location and brilliant customer service,"I stayed at this hotel for two nights for a little city break.

We checked in late on Friday night. Check in was nice and smooth by a very friendly gentleman. 

We stayed in room 537 and this was a great size. Two single beds pushed together, desk and great coffee machine. The beds were very comfortable with lots of pillows. The bathroom was a very good size but sadly the shower lacked any pressure so we had to have baths.

The hotel is very well decorated and the lovely fire in the main area was great to sit by. We didn't eat in the hotel but there were many good choices on the menu.

The location of this hotel is great. Close by to Grafton Street with many bars and restautrants. The shopping was also very good.

I'd love to return to this hotel.",4,2015,03,16
203,Outstanding accomodations,"The Westbury is in the city center, very close to  Grafton street. The rooms are very elegantky appointed, with first class toiletteries and plush linens. The hotel staff makes you feel like royalty. For such a nice and first class surroundings, the hotel is a great value, comparable hotels can be twice the cost elsewhere. The flower arrangements in the lobby were exquisite. I would definitely choose the westbury for a romantic stay in Dublin.",5,2015,03,15
203,Mothers Day Lunch - 5 stars,"Superb afternoon at The Westbury. Lunch in Wilde. Wait staff could not do enough to cater for us. Three of us ( my mam and Iand my baby son). Food excellent. Great menu and wonderful service.
We then went to the lounge area for a glass of wine. Very relaxing surroundings with a great buzz, again fantastic staff. 
Looking forward to my return visit!",5,2015,03,15
203,below par,"this hotel is well below its 5 star rating and while it has elegant public areas the bedroom was large, half lit, lacked socket points in the right places, had a slightly stained carpet ... the bed was comfortable ... the extras in the room minimal ... restaurants and food is average ... staff are very alert in greeting and helpfulness, but not always so good at delivering, forgetting and somewhat slow ... its strengths are is location and the sense of space ... though unless you get a good price this may not be good enough given its so-so quality in too many departments",3,2015,03,15
203,Wonderful location excellent service,"Great location  . The marble bar and lounge on the first floor are really nice and have nice views onto the hustle and bustle of grafton st .food is good , drinks well made .  Rooms are nice not fantastic but they lack nothing either. It's all about the service here ... It's excellent . Very well trained staff who seem happy in their work .. Always around when you need them but never intrusive .. A very pleasant stay and we will definitely return . ",5,2015,03,13
203,Wonderful stay,"I've stayed in the Westbury a few times now and each time has been just as good as the time before.

From the moment you arrive you are treated so special. Our room wasn't ready however we were offered complimentary tea and coffee. We opted for the bar but it was still a nice touch.

The rooms are fabulous. Spacious and clean. The bed could not be more comfortable. I didn't want to get out of it.

Will definitely stay again.",5,2015,03,12
203,Wonderful weekend at the Westbury,"Arrived on Friday 6.3.15, and from the minute we arrived the staff took over looking after us.  They did a great job, very helpful, accommodating and friendly.  The room was fab with comfortable and practical furnishings.   The bowl of chocolates was a nice treat!! We were well advised as to restaurants in the area but chose to dine at the Balfe restaurant in the hotel for dinner.   This was after the really tasty breakfast in the hotel dining room, where once again nothing was a problem for the friendly staff.  The marble bar staff were on top of their game, attentive and efficient at all times. Without doubt this is one of the best hotels both my wife and I have stayed at and we definitely hope to be back.",5,2015,03,09
203,Excellent experience,"I was in Dublin with a friend for a shopping trip and we stayed one night in the Westbury.  It was a perfect stay.  Shopping on our doorstep, friendly and helpful staff and very comfortable rooms.  We were made very welcome and nothing was any hassle to the staff.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,03,09
203,Best Location,"The Westbury as the best location . Right on Crafton Street, this 5 star Hotel is offering good service.  Nice lobby restaurant, small Gym but ok, good room service, Comfortable beds, Will go back. ( it was my 4th stay)",4,2015,03,07
203,"Well located, great service","Stayed at the Westbury x 2, very good both times, excellent service from the moment we entered. Rooms well appointed, comfortable beds. Bathroom facilities excellent. Stand out person for me on both visits were the gentlemen helping with directions, storage of suitcases etc they were great. Would definitely stay again. ",4,2015,03,06
203,Business weekend taking in the Rugby,"The Westbury is a great place to stop. Refinement in a central location, perhaps more suite to the older generation or those seeking a touch of classic style. Excellent attentive bar service throughout the evening in the Marble Bar. I didn't make breakfast but was told it was good.",5,2015,03,05
203,Would highly recommend both for location and comfort.,"The Westbury is in a perfect location-close to Trinity ,the National Museum and National Gallery.The hotel itself is comfortable and understated with helpful service .Beds were great ,as was breakfast-altogether a very relaxing stay.",5,2015,03,05
203,birthday girl,"Visit was a birthday treat for a dear friend. We enjoyed all our time in the hotel. It is so convenient. We found all of the staff very helpful,courteous and welcoming. Have no hesitation returning or recommending to others.  A very enjoyable experience. ",5,2015,03,05
203,It's magically delicious,"Sorry, couldn't help the Lucky Charms reference.  I really liked my experience at the hotel.  It's centrally located, but on a quiet street.  Bed was comfortable, temperature control was great.   I was initially greeted at the front desk by a very friendly staffer.  He quickly processed my reservations and asked if i needed help with any plans.  I told him i was looking for live music and he game me some ideas in the neighborhood.  The workout area is a little sparse, but adequate.  I did not eat at the hotel, but the dining/lobby area is very luxurious.",4,2015,03,03
203,Top rate hotel,"If you can afford it,then this is the place to stay in Dublin. Great rooms,fantastic lounge and bar.

My only moan is it is almost impossible to find by car. Best stop a taxi and get them to guide you in!!
Return ,yes when the rugby crowd are back in town.",5,2015,03,02
203,Wonderful Westbury,"We travelled to Dublin after a 15 year absence!  The purpose of our trip was to celebrate my Husband's birthday, I chose to book the Westbury having read a number of glowing reviews.  We could not be happier, our stay was wonderful and simply one of the best Hotels we have stayed in. The Hotel is luxurious, beautifully decorated, the staff friendly and attentive, and the location could not be better!  Arrive hungry, the Full Irish Breakfast is a must!",5,2015,03,01
203,BEST HOTEL IN DUBLIN,"We have stayed in a few hotels in Dublin over the years ,until we found the westbury and now we will not stay in any other hotel we just love it, from the minute you get out of the car until we leave we can say with hand on heart  its the best hotel we ever have stayed and dont miss breakfast 10 out 10.
              ",5,2015,02,25
203,Friendly staff,"Have just returned from our 2nd trip to this hotel. The hotel has Comfy bed , great atmosphere,  excellent service and helpful staff . The room was spotless well done to the housekeeping staff.  cant wait to go back again !",4,2015,02,24
203,"Fantastic hotel, staff and location","Great location and facilities, will definitely stay here again on return trips to Dublin.  Staff very friendly and not at all overbearing.  The location is superb, close to all the sites in Dublin, and also some great restaurants and bars.",5,2015,02,24
203,More expected,"Stayed over a weekend for convenience and on the basis the Westbury is supposed to be something special. Its not. Coffee machine didn't work, wrong bill at checkout and the price of breakfast at around ¬£22 forces you to go outside. The saving grace is the lovely lounge bar and the location off Grafton Street but due to Dublin's punative one way system it is on the wrong side of St Stephen's green if you want to drive north without your relaxed weekend being trashed by poor signage. Park on the south side and walk. Staff are nice and helpful although one senior be-suited front of house figure was clearly more at home with women than men, ignoring me twice for women behind me.",3,2015,02,23
203,Birthday stay!,"Had a wonderful stay. Arrived to a beautiful dessert platter in the room saying happy birthday to my husband, lovely touch! Room was beautiful, quiet and bed was cozy. Staff welcoming and helpful. The only downside was the accommodation staff literally roaring at the door in the morning and the evening for service. Slightly OTT! ",4,2015,02,23
203,Old world charm,"Stayed 2 nights in Jan for our company conference. The facilities are good but the hotel is v charming,  oozing old school glamour..
The best part is the wonderful lounge with loads of elegant seating and groups having afternoon tea, small meetings and relaxing after shopping on nearby Grafton st. It is the best city centre hotel for your shopping trip. The food was good but not amazing,  the service was good at the front door and desk but not so great in the main restaurant. I know it can be difficult serving such a large group but courtesy goes a long way.... Small gripe really.
Overall a pleasant experience.",4,2015,02,22
203,Amazing!!!!,"Literally can't sing this hotels praises enough!! Here for my birthday trip away and from start to finish it was just fabulous!! The hotel itself is stunning! The staff were lovely and went out their way to make you feel welcome. Our room was just beautiful and we arrived to a handwritten card and beautiful little cakes as a gift for my birthday. I thought this was a lovely touch as I had arrived that day from the malmaison in belfast where the birthday wasn't acknowledged and we paid roughly the same price and the hotel (not the staff) were anywhere near in the same league. The location of the hotel itself is brilliant, right off grafting street and I actually looked forward to coming back each night and seeing the hotel! Overall I can't rave about this hotel enough and will be back again ",5,2015,02,21
203,"Definitely  ""one of the most leading hotels of the world"".","My husband and I stayed here for our minimoon break. We were absolutely blown away by the hotel. The luxury, care and attention were phenomenal. My husband was amazed that someone took our bags on arrival, delivered them to our room and gave us a quick demonstration on how everything worked and showed us where things were. I, on the other hand, couldn't believe that the rooms were serviced twice a day - once for cleaning and later to set up for bedtime! Wonderful, beautiful place, we really do hope to return one day!",5,2015,02,21
203,Excellent in every way,"We stayed in the Westbury for a number of nights around our Wedding - we were getting married nearby - and it was an absolutely fantastic experience. 

From the minute we arrived, the staff went to every effort to really make the stay special. They gave us a lot of extra attention, with some really thoughtful additions and gifts. 

Our room was superb, and the breakfasts were delicious. Overall, it's just a really great hotel, in a great location. 

Above all else, the staff were exceptional in every way. Thanks to all there for making our stay really memorable and special.",5,2015,02,20
203,Great Hotel,"The Hotel is ideally located within the centre of the city, ideal to access Grafton Street for a stroll or shopping. 
Valet service excellent. The Hotel is tastefully decorated and the staff appropriately friendly and helpful. 
Bedroom are clean and very comfortable",5,2015,02,19
203,Visitor from Belfast,Staff fantastic throughout.  They made an 'ordinary person ' feel welcome and special in a 'posh' hotel.  Lounge was just lovely to sit in with a coffee.  Bed was super comfortable. Just loved my stay and would definitely want to go back.,5,2015,02,19
203,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Came with our family of five to Dublin for a few days and we stayed at The Westbury in two adjoining rooms. We had a great time and the VERY 'central to everything' location certainly helped us do lots in a few short days. Additionally the entire staff is wonderfully friendly and accommodating. It's an international group, but they all have a typically Irish warmth and helpfulness. Ashleigh at the concierge desk was terribly nice, warm and helpful and Eden in reservations made sure we had the right rooms to fit all of us. Ida made sure our room was ready as early as possible after arriving from the U.S. The tea with scones was terrific and the lobby is a comfortable place for tea or a drink or a meal. We'd recommend The Westbury and we'll stay again.

One note about tea. A proper tea is served with leaf tea and a pitcher of hot water to mix the tea with as it brews and gets strong. The last time we travelled in England, we were surprised that few establishments remembered to bring the hot water. At The Westbury the tea was served most correctly with hot water, great tasting tea and fresh scones with cream and jam. Not to be missed and worth the trip.",4,2015,02,18
203,Excellent old world style with modern rooms,"Really enjoyed a 4 night stay in this excellent hotel. It's located just off Grafton Street and right near Trinity College. The rooms, while small (by US standards, not by European ones) are modern, clean and well appointed. The lobby and entry scream old world charm and with excellent old world service to match. The breakfast (and cappuccino) is EXCELLENT! There is valet parking ($25 Euros per day) and I'd highly recommend Sheehan's pub on the corner for good food and drinks.",4,2015,02,18
203,Enjoyable stay,"We had an enjoyable stay at the Westbury as always. The menu in the Gallery has been changed since we last visited and the food there is much improved and is now excellent. However, prices of food and drink have taken another inflation busting leap ( inflation rate is well below 1%) and are extortionate. Prices are now mostly quoted to the nearest 50cent ! The staff everywhere are very pleasant and helpful. There is a wonderful atmosphere in the Gallery. Our room was very average, and the furniture, carpet and bathroom are really showing their age. There is excellent soundproofing from outside noise but poor soundproofing between rooms. The coffee machine in the room is excellent. All in all a nice stay so long as you can shrug off the feeling that celtic tiger inflation is starting again, along with all its well rehearsed problems.",4,2015,02,18
203,"love, love, LOVE this hotel!","I cannot say enough great things about this hotel.  I cannot think of a better location in Dublin.  You can walk to anywhere you would need to so easily.  The hotel staff is some of the best we have ever experienced during our travels.  I wish I could remember all the names but Lindsey at the front desk and John at concierge really stood out to us.  There is free internet and it works great.  The rooms are spacious and the beds very cozy.  The congierge helped us plan activities and make reservations at one of the best restaurants on valentines day when we realized we should have planned ahead because no reservations were available.  We had the most delicious breakfast in the restaurant there (must try the eggs benedict!)  and another delicious breakfast in the main lounge area on the lobby floor.  A taxi from the airport shouldn't be more than 30 euros which is a nice surprise compared to other cities.  Right outside the hotel there are 2 really great authentic pubs unlike what you will find in temple bar.  The only thing we did not love about the hotel was the room service.  The food really was not up to par compared to the rest of the hotel.  The menu looks so delicious but we ordered the crab, cheese plate, tea, caesar salad, ham sandwich with fries and I would not recommend anything but the fries unfortunately.  But not to worry there are delicious restaurants downstairs and so many choices within quick walking distance!  It is rare that I will use the toiletries in the bathroom but these were amazing.  I seriously cannot think of a reason not to stay here- it made our time in Dublin SO awesome!",5,2015,02,18
203,"Beautiful Hotel, Noisy Room","This hotel was very well located for the city centre and the staff were all very friendly and helpful.

The room was well appointed and spacious with everything one could need for a trip away.  The conference facilities were well considered, and the catering was delicious.

Sadly my room was very noisy on the night of arrival.  I called reception to ask if I was above a club or bar and was told no, but that someone would come upstairs to investigate.  No one did arrive and the noise continued through the night.  In the morning I went downstairs and discovered that I was in fact above a bar.  Fortunately the next night was quiet, but this did leave me out of sorts for my trip which was business related so I needed to be firing on all cylinders.

From that perspective therefore, it was disappointing because in every other respect it was a lovely place to stay.  I would stay again but would specifically ask not to stay in that part of the hotel.

The average review is purely reflective of the poor night of sleep I had - in every other respect the hotel was outstanding.  I think for the price per night, I would have hoped to sleep better than in a cheap Premier Inn where you have a good night of sleep guarantee!",3,2015,02,18
203,Lovely hotel,"We stayed here for the weekend only but it was a nice stay I have to say. rooms are spacious, with huge bathrooms. Staff very friendly. We had a dinner in the restaurant on one night and it was excellent. I would highly recommend this hotel. thx",5,2015,02,17
203,Sheer Luxury,"We had the pleasure of an overnight stay at this fabulous hotel and the service we received on arrival including the valet parking, the staff on reception, the waiting staff in the lounge areas and the helpful commissionaire who provided advice regarding places to visit in thae area were totally friendly and professional. The bedrooms were beautifully appointed with all the facilities at hand, thoroughly clean and spotless. It was a total pleasure to have stayed in this top class hotel and one we can confidently recommend when visiting Dublin.",5,2015,02,15
203,Center of Dublin,"If you go on vacation and want to stay in Dublin, you have to stay at the Westbury Hotel. They have an excellent service, reasonable cost, excellent food, excellent accommodations and they are close to the heart of Dublin. You can walk few meters to see all beautiful things that Dublin reserves for you.",5,2015,02,14
203,Excellent 3 night stay,I stayed at the westbury hotel with my friends for a long weekend trip to Dublin. We had arrived on an early flight and check in wasn't until 3pm. We went to the hotel to drop off our bags but we were pleasantly surprised that our room was ready and we check in. The room was very clean and spacious. The staff were very friendly and happy to help with anything we needed. Towels and sheets were changed everyday on request and a turndown service was offered. We were all very happy with the service provided and will most certainly be coming back to this hotel when we visit Dublin again. Thank you.,5,2015,02,14
203,Exceeded expectations,"Subject: The Westbury Hotel
Location: Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland, Europe
Title: Lived up to expectations and more!
ID#: 253363062 

For our first trip to Dublin, we wanted to be in the heart of everything, and the Westbury looked like the perfect spot. We arrived too early for our room to be completed, so we stored our luggage, had a walk about and settled into a comfy sofa in the lobby for a lite bite. The room not only was ready much earlier than they originally said, but they had upgraded us to a junior suite. 
The bed was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom was spotless.
Our plans were to stay one night, then tour around Ireland for the better part of the week, then return to the Dublin for 4 more nights at the Westbury 
Upon our return to the Westbury, not only did they greet us like old friends, but they upgraded us above our other room, with a beautiful, full suite, a gift plate of sweets and savories. We even had a view over the rooftops of Dublin. Once again, we had turn-down service with sweets and water, with clean towels and foot mats by the bed. 
The concierge service was excellent, mapping out our destinations, transportation, booking just the right restaurants, concerts and theater. 
I must say that the service was superb. And the location within walking distance of all the major shops and Trinity College, whose library is a must see for any bibliophile. 
The Westbury Hotel did, indeed, surpass our expectations.",5,2015,02,12
203,Stunning,"Well I don't have much time so this will be short.. Simply stunning!! Checkin was great, hot towel also!!! Nice touch! Had dinner in Balfes.. Lovely menu and a nice atmosphere, surprisingly busy for a Tuesday. Room was lovely, Bath/Shower combo not ideal but that's ok! Breakfast was stunning!! The staff could not do enough for you, great to see that the hot breakfast was not buffet! Lovely eggs bennidict, the lobby area looks beautiful but didn't get to use. Amazingly central! ",5,2015,02,12
203,Wonderful,"What a fantastic Hotel. You feel at times your the only Guests , and that's down to the Staff. A bit late reviewing this Hotel . We went to Dublin mid December and spent 3 Nights here. Great location , We had a fabulous time .",5,2015,02,11
203,Beautiful relaxing 5* stay,"Beautiful stay in this gorgeous hotel! We stayed on a Saturday night, in a fabulous studio suite. Checked in early and the room was ready! Such pleasant staff. Amazing huge room, seating area, robes, it was so comfortable. Loved the bed, big tv and remote controlled curtains were so handy!! A lovely fruit bowl was brought to our room too! Such a relaxing stay. Breakfast the next morning was beautiful, fresh and tasty with great service. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we were sad to leave such surroundings! Definitely want to return. ",5,2015,02,11
203,Lovely stay,"I stayed in The Westbury for the first time last month. We had an exceptional booking experience with Ida, who was very helpful and quick to respond to all queries. Our room exceeded expectations. I booked one room for four people and had concerns it might be a tight squeeze. It was huge, so I was absolutely delighted. The bathroom was quite small, however. I was very impressed that our room, as requested, was available for an early check in. However the level of service on check in with Keith was very poor. I received the keys and was directed to the lift....no details on breakfast or any services in the hotel were given. Breakfast was very nice the next morning and service was prompt. Lovely to deal with so many Irish staff in general. Overall a great stay.",4,2015,02,11
203,Fantastic stay!,"Although difficult to find this place definitely exceeded our expectations. From the boys who parked the car to the ladies at reception everyone was so welcoming. Room was amazing, One of the nicest we have ever stayed. Ideal location for a trip to Dublin. As we only stayed one night we did not have a chance to eat in the restaurant here but the menu sounded amazing. Thank you for a great stay. Hope to be back soon. ",5,2015,02,11
203,The best,"Highly impressed with all aspects of hotel....staff on front desk are excellent..cant do enough for you and are chatty and helpful Location is  unbeatable .We will be making this a regular city break,TY",5,2015,02,09
203,Nice Stay,"Stayed only the one night recently. Very comfortable room with pleasant staff. The public areas are immaculate and very nicely appointed. Great food, friendly staff and very close to just about everything.

Just two small things against. For some reason we were told there was no Bacardi which seemed odd for a large property like this and though the breakfast was in the large part lovely, my full Irish was left under the grill too long and was well done on top which I never like.",4,2015,02,08
203,Superb ,"Just arrived back from a 2 night stay at the lovely Westbury and what a great find.  As I'd informed the hotel that it was my husband's birthday celebration, we were delighted to receive a room upgrade and a lovely chocolate birthday plate on arrival. The hotel is in a superb location to explore Dublin city centre and has a great little irish pub on the doorstep. 
On our first night we came accross The Chameleon Indonesian Restaurant near Temple Bar and would highly recommend it. Great food and a quirky little place. 
On our second night we stayed at the hotel's main restaurant and were not disappointed. All four members of our group were more than happy with our choices and although the deserts were not quite up to the same standard, overall the whole evening felt very special and well worth the money. A night cap in the hotel lounge completed a perfect stay in a very special hotel.
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Westbury to anybody and we can't wait to visit again.

203,Cozy hotel in Downtown Dublin,"The location of this hotel is quite convenient and there are lot restaurants and pubs, if, only if you don't drive. It would be your nightmare if you tried to drive to the hotel. I spent almost 2 hours just being trying get to the location, with a rented Hertz GPS, google map on my iphone and Waze with real traffic, I just could not do. This area has all the traffic tools you can name, pedestrians, students riding bicycles, motorcycles, taxies, buses, all coexisting in very small  and short streets, the lane could be merge with no sign with in about less than 10 meters, you have to know exact what you do before your turn so you can get into the right lane, coz, no one would let you go, and you cannot find a place to stop to check the road, if you missed, you have to go back to whereever you need and have another try again. The whole areas seem to have been recently re-planned, non the GPS from Hertz nor the Google map could point the correct direction. I finally giving up and parked my rented right wheel nice Audi A6 in another garage nearby. 

The hotel quite nice and modern considering the location and the surrounding. The room is not very tiny small. However, the shower space is really small and with my size, a 6 ft average built cannot fit myself into the space to move free. You have to consistently pay attention to not hit the glass on the side which only covers half of the tub on which shower installed. Another thing  to mention is(not sure if this is common in the EU) the hot and cold water are from separate faucets, cannot have comfort running water which is really a shame.",4,2015,02,05
203,It just never stops getting better,"There are very few words left for me to describe the Westbury . The one word that stands out is SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE . I spend most of the year traveling all over the world and have become very critical of the types of places called ""hotels"", what I have seen in Asia or the Usa or the Middle East are just labels on buildings calling themselves hotels .... PERIOD

The Westbury is a hotel in the true sense of the word. It is based on you the customer . Whether the cocktails and superb seafood in the newly opened Balfes or the international ever pleasing reception staff or the 7 star chamber maids --- you are always made feel important and that your custom matters ---- if you do not stay in this hotel you are missing out .",5,2015,02,04
203,A gem in the centre of the City,"I was at the Westbury for burins and stayed one night. 

The Westbury is pleasantly located in the City Centre without the inconvenience of it. You will have available, bars, hotels, shops and restaurants nearby. Yet the location remains quiet. The room was a double with two king size beds. The comfort was sublime. The size of the room enormous and I had a preferential business rate at ‚Ç¨150. The breakfast was lavish. The staff very courteous and helpful.
I use hotels on an average 10 times a year for various length of time and have done so for the last 15 years. This is one memorable experience and will use the Westbury again.",5,2015,02,04
203,Excellent but expensive,"The staff were. Joy to meet each one greeted you when they meet you.    The room were beautiful and kept up to a high standard . While we were at a show our room had being redone and fresh towels replaced on racks.
The only problem I could say is the breakfast at 29.50 euro was. Bit steep and the 20.00 to place your car I the garage I feel is out of line .",4,2015,02,03
203,Class,"We stay here every Christmas for a night or two and it is just top drawer ,location ,staff and atmosphere this hotel has everything .We normally would go out for something to eat but this time we were unable to get a reservation so we ate in the Hotel itself .....unreal there is not a restaurant like this in Dublin if you are a steak eater....this is the best in Dublin and great value too .... We were lucky that we couldn't get another restaurant as this is the best around..",5,2015,02,03
203,Westbury hotel,"Brilliant location,  lovely friendly staff. A lovely oasis of calm in the centre of Dublin. Very convenient for shops,  restaurants and bars.  Convenient for Gaiety Theatre where we went to""Moll"" Loved it. ",4,2015,02,02
203,Small Bedrooms...,The personal concierge service and the Nespresso coffee maker in the room is a nice touch.Yes the Westbury is in a good location for visiting Dublin. But that's not enough to justify the 5* price tag given the small size of the bedrooms. You can get a room twice the size for half the price at any one of half a dozen 3* & 4* hotels also around Dublin's Grafton Street. The Westbury's ok but I'd rather more room for my buck.,3,2015,02,02
203,"Fantastic staff , location , beautiful food!",My husband & myself spent two nights in the wonderful Westbury hotel every single thing from start to finish was excellent the friendly staff to the fantastic food to the beautiful room the attention to detail was outstanding & the staff make the hotel top quality with there excellent customer service!!!! ,5,2015,02,02
203,Great weekend,"Just got home from a great weekend at the westbury.,location of this hotel was amazing .
The moment we steeped out of the taxi the front on house staff were amazing well mannered  could not do enough for us. .
Rooms were very well very comfy beds 

Can't wait for our return. Thank you westbury team . Mr and mrs ashley",5,2015,02,01
203,Great Hotel in a great location,"We arrived at the hotel very early in the morning and were greeted by the porter who took our bags and showed us to reception. The receptionist was very pleasant and advised us that one of our rooms was ready and if we left a phone number, she would call and let us know when the other became available. We decided we would take all our luggage up to the first room and go off to find somewhere for breakfast. Our rooms were Superior rooms with a Queen bed and were of a standard you'd expect of a 5* hotel - The only problem was we couldn't find a master switch and had to switch off each light individually. The bathroom had a bath with a shower over, which was really quite feeble but the toiletries were lovely, so made up for it. The hotel is centrally situated and within 5 - 10 minutes walk of everything we wanted to see. Would definitely stay again if we return to Dublin",4,2015,01,31
203,Short Break,We stayed in the Westbury for 2 nights recently and have no hesitation in recommending this 5 star hotel. We had dinner the first night in the hotel and is was very good. Breakfast in the mornings are excellent. What I liked about the hotel was the staff were extremely friendly without all the fuss that some 5 star establishments have which put you on edge. The location is great being next to Grafton Street and minutes away from Trinity Library and several other places of interest. We will be back.,4,2015,01,31
203,Night away,"Stayed in the Westbury hotel on 30th January. The hotel is in a great location just off Grafton street which was useful to access all the local restaurants, pubs and we went go the Gaeity theatre. The facilities are of a very high standard and the staff were excellent. It's a 5 star hotel so prices are in the upper quartile. A real treat. ",5,2015,01,31
203,Magical,"As we arrived the porter took our suitcases and we were shown inside, it was like stepping back in time in the most magical way. The reception was beautifully decorated with chandeliers and flowers. The staff are an absolute credit to this hotel, all seem very happy to help and with a cheery smile which makes you instantly feel warm inside.

Our room was very clean and a good size. Including dressing gown and slippers, not forgetting the chocolates every night! Very peaceful and not a sound could be heard from other rooms or corridor and I am a light sleeper! 

On leaving the hotel, reception took our bags until we were ready to leave for the airport. The hotel is in a perfect location close walk to everything. Taxis are right outside the hotel if you need one.

I would recommend anybody this hotel without a shadow of a doubt, book now! ",5,2015,01,28
203,"Great location, beautiful hotel.","Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin! Front door leads you straight onto Grafton Street and a short walk from the back door leads straight to Brown Thomas. Butler's chocolate on our pillows each night. The pillows were the comfiest we've ever had! 
Coffee machines in every room were a lovely touch. 
Attention to detail by the hotel made this a wonderful stay. ",5,2015,01,27
203,Lovely Dublin Hotel,"The Westbury is tip top on all fronts.  Great location, rooms, restaurant, etc.  One of the best things is the staff.  Very professional, reliable, and organized.  I somehow lost a cuff link for a shirt that I planned to wear the next day, and I asked the gentleman that hails cabs where I could purchase another set.  To my pleasant surprise, he offered to bring a set of cuff links from home that I could wear that day and when done leave it at the front desk when I checked out.  Fortunately, I found the missing item so I did not have to take him up on his offer.  Try getting that kind of response in London or NYC.  I have stayed at the Westbury a half dozen times over the last ten years, and it is the best.",5,2015,01,27
203,Lovely birthday weekend!,"I picked this hotel for my hubby's birthday weekend. The location was fantastic. The room was clean, very comfy beds/pillows! Give it a go, you will not be disappointed. Thank you Westbury, we will be back!  ",5,2015,01,27
203,"elegant & classy, we will be back","my partner and i travelled here as a small get away.  The minute we landed in dublin everyone was so kind and pretty much like tour guides, pointing out where we should visit and where not to go (never been to dublin before) 

at the hotel we were met by a concierge who immediately took our bags and tolled us where to go for check in. 

we stayed in a junior suit, very spacious and loved the partitions to separate the living area from the bedroom. the bathroom was heaven. 

we had one meal in the westbury and couldn't fault it, the restaurant was quiet and the staff were so quick and tended to everything we needed. 

a credit to dublin and made our experience very memorable. 

thank you",5,2015,01,26
203,"Perfect location for all shops, restaurants and bars","We were really looking forward to our weekend away in the 5 star Westbury Hotel, on arrival we were greeted by a member of the car valet staff, he was friendly and walked us into the hotel. However, inside the front door was like a building site, the noise from grinding the floor was terrible. We could hardly hear the receptionist, check in was quick and our bags were taken to our suite,and coats hung in the wardrobe. Our room was clean and fresh , the bathroom was luxurious. Mini bar well stocked, a bowl of jamesons chocolate on the table and bottles of complimentary water which was a lovely touch. We were wakened the first morning by a member of housekeeping staff who let herself in to the room without knocking ??. The breakfast was delicious and the waiting staff were polite and helpful. Although after breakfast on day two we decided to sit in the gallery to read the newspapers, when a member of staff set a reserved sign on our table, she said that it was only there for when we left, the same lady came   back over and said the table was needed for 40 mins time. That is fine but being residents where else are you supposed to sit?? We found this a lot over the weekend! All and all the location is perfect for all amenities  but for a 5 star hotel I think the reserved system is an insult for residents, who sometimes have to sit along the side and wait for a seat when nonresidents can reserve seats",4,2015,01,25
203,"Fantastic Location, Great Staff, Lovely Rooms",Stayed here for one night on a business trip but would definitely stay again. Staff all very efficient and friendly.  Room lovely and the location just off Grafton Street can't be beaten. Doorman at door adds to the overall ambiance of the place.  Very smart and formal.  So if you are looking for something a bit special in Dublin stay here.,5,2015,01,24
203,Annual conference in Dublin,"On arrival to the Westbury, I was greeted by a very friendly, well presented and professional valet parking attendant who unloaded my luggage and promptly arranged for it to be transferred to my room. (room was ready at 12!!) My car was parked. My room key was ready and I began to meet my European colleagues whom had been arriving all morning. The hotel was warm, clean and all staff were extremely friendly. My room was perfect- clean warm and very comfortable. 
I was hosting our European conference here and I needed everything to go smooth. The business centre is second to none. Meeting rooms to suit all sized groups. Screens and projectors (or large TV screen) in every room. Coffe and home made cookies were on time every day and the food in Balfes Restaurant was exceptional. Day one, service was slower than I would have liked as we only had 45 mins for lunch but from  day 2 onwards we pre booked our lunch choice and it was ready when we arrived.
We spent 4 days at the Westbury and I am unable to find fault with the whole experience. For an unforgettable conference choose the Westbury.
5 STARS!!",5,2015,01,23
203,Poor suite quality,"I stayed at a suite 525 , there was a continous noise coming from heating and also from water system in the middle of night although heating switched off. I reserved the expensiest s√ºite in the hotel after presedential one but you gave me the s√ºite next to the elevators, you always hear the noise of elevators and the housekeeping staff preparations around there. The room saloon is big but bedroom is too small morevover there is no bidet or shower tube in the bathroom. This was the worst s√ºite I ever stayed, very very bad designed. On the other hand Dublin is a cold place the hotel heating is just a noisy air condition once you turn off the room is cold once it is open you can not sleep from the noise",1,2015,01,23
203,"Central, lovely but....","A fantastic location, just steps from Dublin's pedestrianised Grafton Street. The lobby is a lovely place to relax, but it's a shame that the music does not match the decor or ambiance for such an establishment. The staff are efficient and polite and food very tasty, but there was a bit of a wait given every seat was filled and there was a error on every food bill. 
Afternoon Tea is a real treat, no ifs, no buts! The bedrooms are pleasant, and in keeping with the hotels genre, but unfortunately on this stay there was maintenance work happening near our room in the early hours. The breakfast room is lovely, but the arrangement of dead flowers that greeted us at reception looked awful and didn't inspire a feeling of freshness. The buffet is nice, but the porridge was horrendous, so we were not charged for breakfast. The hot breakfasts and juice looked great, so would opt for that if staying there again. Would stay again, but they need to up their game a little!",4,2015,01,22
203,Excellent,"Just back from a stay in The wonderful Westbury hotel, the newly renovated Balfes Bar is a great addition to the Hotel, something the hotel needed to compliment the rest of the establishment. Staff as usual were very attentive, can't wait for my next trip!",5,2015,01,22
203,Happy to return,"Ireland is our go to holiday location & when staying in Dublin The Westbury is the place to stay. The location is top notch, the staff wonderful. You can see why The Westbury is popular with business people, those who want to have afternoon tea.",5,2015,01,22
203,anniversary afternoon tea,"booked afternoon tea to celebrate our 2nd anniversary
we booked it the day before and voiced our dietary requirements which they were all too happy to organise for us
we were seated in the lounge area near the window watching the world go by on grafton street.
to start with we ordered an irish breakfast tea and a nutella hot chocolate. delicious. the tea didnt get too strong by the 3rd cup at all. the hot chocolate was very smooth and full bodied. then the sandwiches came out. a tray consisting of egg mayo (with chives) and smoked salmon mousse on soda bread - we didn't have the meat or chicken ones. they were absolutely fabulous. fresh bread and flavoursome toppings. we were able to ask for more which is unusual for afternoon tea
the next tea i tried was sweet chai darjeeling - really complimented the desserts - again didn't get too  strong the longer it brewed. my husband had a normal hot chocolate - again very smooth. the dessert plate had big plain scones and fruit scones - warm - crusty on the outside and slighty doughy and soft in the middle- as i prefer - and not dry at all. there was a selection of 3 jams - strawberry , raspberry and blackcurrant along with thick clotted cream and butter - all delicious.
the desserts consisted of a chocolate ganache with strawberry pieces with a top layer of lime mousse,
coffee cream eclair, mille fueille set with strawberry and hazelnut sponge along with a white chocolate shell with salted caramel covered in milk chocolate. All incredible and you could taste every individual flavour. different to the usual fayre of macaroons and cakes the sweets were of a  considerably high quality patisserie standard

as it was our anniversary they had also organised a slate with happy anniversary written on it with chocolate and a pistachio based dessert with raspberry white chocolate mousse and covered in white chocolate - scrumptious and a nice touch

apart from the wonderful food the venue is really lovely and the service was brilliant
our waiter ( valentine) was very attentive and nothing was too much trouble - very polished.
viktoria was front of house and again very professional and friendly

would definitely recommend the afternoon tea here
i appreciate it is a bit pricey but well worth a special occasion
excellent staff and service and the food pretty amazing as it should be for a 5 * hotel
would definitely consider staying here next time in dublin",5,2015,01,21
203,The best luxury hotel in Dublin,One of the best hotels in Dublin!  If you looking for a luxury and romantic getaway it's the best hotel in town and just in the centre of all the main attractions in Dublin! Food is to die for and staff is very helpful and amazing,5,2015,01,20
203,Thank you Siobhan,"Stayed two nights for our 40th wedding anniversary and mentioned this on booking. The first night we were left with a tray of sweets and congratulations on our anniversary. On our last night we had dinner in the Wilde restaurant which was excellent and again the staff had a little tray for us with a note about the anniversary.

The hotel itself is an oasis of luxury at the top of Grafton Street and gives easy access to all the shops. We had drinks in the bar and the staff were very professional and the lounge seems to be the place to sit and watch the world go by. We don't take big breakfasts so went to Bewleys for tea and toast.
Throughout our stay all staff were superb. The only downside was two days were too short.",5,2015,01,20
203,Amazing,"My wife and I had celebrated special occasions in the Westbury for many years but had never actually stayed in the hotel.  With her 30th coinciding with the Westbury‚Äôs own 30th celebration we decided to put that right and book a suite for a night as a special treat.  Upon check in, we were greeted with the news that we had been upgraded to the Presidential Suite.  We didn‚Äôt quite believe it until we arrived outside, put our key in and opened the double doors.  Wow!  We were like giddy school children walking from one room to the next.  The lobby opened into a huge dining/living area with its own private bar, guest wc, remote control gas fire, entertainment system, huge couch and chairs, a chilled bottle of champagne and some macaroons and other treats.  Our bedroom was similarly massive with huge TV and an ensuite with his and hers sinks, huge shower, and a bath with a TV embedded in the wall.  After that there was a huge dressing room with private steam room and sauna!  After about 10 min, there was a knock on the door.  We figured it was someone coming to say that a mistake had been made ‚Äì no, in our excitement we had left one of our suitcases outside and another guest was letting us know!  Breakfast the next day was top notch and we left feeling on top of the world.  Thank you and well done to the Westbury for giving us a memory for life.  For anyone looking for somewhere to stay in Dublin, if you can afford it, stay in the Westbury.  It is the classiest hotel with the best location (better than the Shelbourne or any comparable hotel), tucked away in a street off the main shopping street and a stone‚Äôs throw from the best restaurants and bars.",5,2015,01,19
203,Great experience,Wonderful location in the heart of Dublin. This is a delightful place to stay particularly because of the staff who could not be more helpful. We returned here recently after a gap of 21 years and it was as excellent as we had remembered it. Hope to return again and well before another 21 years!,5,2015,01,18
203,Very good but expensive hotel in the centre of Dublin city,"My family bought me a night in town for Christmas and we all stayed in the Westbury Hotel (9 people). We had absolutely no complaint about the hotel itself and certainly its location was wonderful. However it was extremely expensive at ‚Ç¨200 per room just for a bed, it would have been an extra ‚Ç¨40 each for breakfast I was informed. So basically we paid that price just to sleep. Ok the rooms were spacious, bright and clean as were the bathrooms, and maybe we should have tried to negotiate having breakfast included at that price  with nine of us staying there, but as I said it was a present for me so I had no chance to bargain! Also we went into the lounge to have drinks and were amazed that they could charge ‚Ç¨30 for two lattes and two gin & tonics! Needless to say after our meal at another restaurant we just went to a local pub for some drinks! So overall, for anyone visiting, just be aware that you pay top dollar for the pleasure of being just off Grafton Street! With people with lots of money for shopping and entertainment I would highly recommend this hotel - staff were very pleasant and helpful too.",4,2015,01,14
203,Simply Amazing,"Yet again my visit to the Westbury was simply amazing. I am a solo lady traveller and I can only say that the staff at the Westbury are just so professional so friendly and just cannot do enough for their visitors. From the minute you arrive at the main door to the moment you reluctantly check out you are treated with such wonderful care and attention that you just want to keep going back. I travel alot and have stayed in all the 5 star hotels in Dublin and in my opinion the Westbury is number one....its simply amazing. The rooms are just wonderful and so well maintained and breakfast is just a glorious abundance of delicious food so don't allow anyone to tell you any different. Their main restaurant is so beautiful and the staff there and on the gallery work very hard to ensure you are served with the highest quality of food and in such a pleasant manner so ignore all those silly picky people who say otherwise. If you want to visit Dublin and stay in a truly wonderful hotel with amazing friendly staff then just book the Westbury you certainly won't regret it as it's just 100% bliss.
Thank you so much to everyone at the Westbury.
Geraldine Kearney",5,2015,01,13
203,Amazing stay with a toddler,"My husband and I stayed at The Westbury with our toddler-age son and the overall experience was excellent. The staff was more than accommodating, especially Sean, one of the hotel's valets. Sean went above and beyond to help us with our rental car, give directions, restaurant recommendations and answer any questions we had. Everyone was warm and inviting and made us feel at home. The location of the hotel was ideal for sightseeing and traveling with a little one - you can walk out the door to beautiful shops and restaurants! We hope to visit Dublin and The Westbury again soon! ",5,2015,01,12
203,Great Irish Coffees,"Room was small for a 5 star hotel but clean. Nothing special but no complaints either.
The location is the key, it's right in the middle of the city centre
Staff were friendly and helpful
Irish Coffees on the lobby floor in the evening beside the fire - they were excellent, probably the best Irish coffees in Dublin
Car Parking is best left to the concierge - the car park is underground and it's extremely difficult to park in.",4,2015,01,12
203,Disappointing ,"The location is fantastic, but the rest of our experience was pretty average in the hotel. I stayed here with my husband this weekend. The service is slow and the friendliness of the staff is very hit and miss. The room was dated and unimpressive for the price. The breakfast is very limited- the menu and the buffet. Very little cheese/meats in the buffet- very small buffet area. Slow to get an order for coffee. The porter helping us with our bags to our taxi when we were leaving was the friendliest member of staff we met. Wouldn't stay here again. Over rated and over priced, wouldn't recommend. ",2,2015,01,11
203,Central Dublin Hotel,"The Westbury is a class above the typical downtown hotel. Our only complaint was that we had to go outside to get to the informal restaurant connected to the hotel. This was a minor inconvenience in the cold December weather, but otherwise an insignificant factor to our overall enjoyment of the experience. Convenient to all downtown attractions and shopping. We would certainly stay there on our next trip to Dublin!",5,2015,01,11
203,Westbury dublin,"Just stayed for one night. Room was nice, a  lot of lovely extra touches, bath robes, crystal glasses, nespresso  etc. The staff were extremely helpful. Had a couple of drinks, pricey but worth it for the atmosphere. Didn't dine here so can't comment on the food. Would ask for a high room. The hotel was a bit too warm for my liking. Really lovely hotel break for a treat.",5,2015,01,10
203,"Perfect location, outstanding service","Staying in the Westbury over the New Years period was a joy, The service was outstanding, wide range of traditional and healthy breakfast options,  and the location couldn't have been better - only 100m from Dublin's premier shopping street.",5,2015,01,10
203,Excellent location !!!,"We spent 4 nights at this hotel . 
The location is more than great , located in the center of Dublin close to all the main attractions and shopping areas !! The facilities are very sufficient . The lobby bar has great atmosphaire . 
The prices at the bar and restaurant i believe are too high and overpriced !!!",4,2015,01,10
203,second visit this year,"Just a fabulous place to stay. Rooms are nice, beds are perfect and the location is next to graft on street. I did not get lost finding it in the car this time, but the one way roads in there are tricky. Except for the Merrion, I think this is the best hotel in Dublin. The Concierge is outstandingly helpful.",5,2015,01,09
203,"Great room, great location and great staff!","From the moment we arrived we knew we had made the right choice!  The staff were so friendly and welcoming.
The warm hand towel was much appreciated after our long journey from Cape Cod    
The location ,just off of Grafton St., was just perfect for dining, shopping and just being able to experience Dublin at Christmas.  The room was lovely, and there was plenty of storage room for all of our clothes and luggage
There were Butlers chocolates  complimentary bottled water left in our room daily
The housekeeping service came into our room twice a day and the room always left spotlessly clean with new towels , shampoos etc., as needed
All in all a fabulous experience!! We would rate this a 5 star hotel, and we look forward to our next visit to Dublin and the Westbury!",5,2015,01,09
203,"Westbury Hotel, Dublin, Ireland","Had a wonderful stay at the Westbury Hotel for Christmas and New Year, spent 13 nights there and I have to say it was wonderful.  The hotel is so central in Grafton Street near everywhere you want to visit in Dublin.  The staff are fantastic.  The food is great, rooms are so comfortable and cosy. It's like a home from home. I would highly recommend the Westbury.

203,holiday stay,"We loved the location, couldn't be better.  The first room was great, modern, but had no view.  They moved us to a view room overlooking the Leffey.  Thank you.  I particularly like the modern decor of the rooms. 
  Service was excellent.  Unfortunately, the water-pressure was low,  this could be better.  But on the whole we had a lovely stay.",4,2015,01,07
203,Comfortable; central location,"The accommodations at the Westbury were very welcoming. I did not hear much noise from the other rooms or the street (with the exception of a marching band playing in the shopping area a block away). The room temperature was easily controllable and water pressure fantastic. I was able to walk to many of the things to see and do in Dublin, and there were plenty of good restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk. Plus, the room had a US plug by the desk. And the turndown service included chocolates- nice touch. ",5,2015,01,07
203,Lives up to reviews,"We are just back after spending 3 nights at the Westbury. The location, rooms, food, restaurant and bar facilities were all excellent but the service was outstanding. The few small issues we had on arrival to our room were immediately resolved and nothing seemed too much bother to the staff. It does come at a price but well worth it.

We thoroughly enjoyed our break and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for time out from the hustle and bustle that is Dublin.",5,2015,01,07
203,Lovely but pricey,"Having visited Dublin hundreds of times and walked up Grafton 
Street on match day, I always wanted to spend a night at least in this hotel. For Christmas my wife took me here and we really enjoyed the break.
We arrived at the door and the concierge took our car for parking which was a bonus in this city; and the room was really beautiful I have to say. However, now that we are home and back to work, I look back and have to say it was an awful lot of money for what you get. I reckon you could stay somewhere just as beautiful but much less costly. You would, of course, not be on the Main Street which is the real,beauty of this place but I could take that. I am glad we experienced the hotel and it was gorgeous but I would save my pennies in future and spend them elsewhere. In Dublin, they'll not go far anyway!!
In short; great idea and superb location but not really value for money. Ticked off my list now!!",5,2015,01,06
203,An average experience overall!,"Was really looking forward to my one night stay in the run up to Christmas. Although the staff were excellent, from the front desk to the Valet parking people to room service, the overall experience was not 5 Star. My room was on the very small side but was well laid out. The bathroom was ridiculously small. There was not room to swing a cat. The tap was so close to the marble that a proper hand wash was out of the question. The shower was good but again far too small. I had a terrible nights sleep despite having all possible windows open as it was far too warm in the room.

The breakfast to the room was lovely and I really enjoyed it. 

I would say that the number of Christmas functions / parties on in the hotel left the place down I thought. A friend visited me at the hotel with a new baby and having to push through throngs of smokers at the entrance to the hotel is not ideal. Before going for dinner elsewhere that evening my brother was to come in to the hotel for a pre dinner drink. I asked in the lounge which of the two bars would be best to meet him in and was told that ""with all the functions we have tonight you would be as well off going elsewhere for a drink as both bars will be extremely busy""!!!!! a guest staying in the hotel should surely have access to the hotel facilities! So that irked me. 

Do not think I would stay here again even though the location is excellent and the staff were lovely. I must be getting very fussy in my old age.",3,2015,01,06
203,Great location and service,A party of 6 stayed at the Westbury over the Christmas period and found the hotel to be excellent in many respects. Very smart rooms and very relaxing bar areas. The location is superb in relation to bars and restaurants and shops.,5,2015,01,05
203,Fantastic Stay - 30th Birthday,"We visit this hotel on special occasions and It never ceases to impress. The reception kindly left a a selection of sweets on a plate (happy birthday written in chocolate also) in our room for us arriving. 

The overall location, atmosphere and professionalism of the hotel
Is next to none - The Shelbourne is probably a very close competitor! ",5,2015,01,04
203,Great city hotel,Great city hotel this hotel is a touch of class.the rooms in this hotel are just wonderful .The staff are very friendly and helpful.This is a   great hotel for a city or shopping break so close to everything,5,2015,01,04
203,Great hotel in the perfect location ,"The hotel is in a great location and the staff are so helpful. However, you are unable to just walk into the bar- you need to book a table via the restaurant. 

If you do manage to get into the bar, there are great cocktails and again lovely staff.

To add, the location is right by all the shops and restaurants- you wouldn't need to get a taxi any where. 
 ",4,2015,01,03
203,New Years Eve Stay,"Picked this hotel because of the good reviews from others and wasn't disappointed. Lovely place and feels really special soon as you walk in.Staff really helpful and friendly, check in not until 3 but given our room at 1 which was perfect, unfortunately I had a sickness bug which I still have 3 days later so didn't see any of the famous Dublin nightlife, thankfully the room and room service for my wife was excellent, so thanks for an great stay and would definitely return.",5,2015,01,02
203,Stayed with Tauck tours in October,"This was one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. The location is amazing, right off Grafton street and within walking distance of so many great pubs, eateries, shops and sights!
I have to say the pillows were the most comfortable of any hotel we stayed in. I wish I could order them for my home!!",5,2015,01,02
203,Another Great Experience,"My partner and I stayed at the Westbury again this year on the run up to Christmas (23 Dec).  This is our 3rd Christmas to do this and has become one of the highlights of our festive season.  From the moment we arrived this year we were made feel very special.  The welcome we received as we drove up to the hotel - to the help we got to load up the jeep to go home on Christmas Eve was exceptional. Our Room was beautiful - very fresh and extremely comfortable.However, this year the exceptional service came from the Manageress of Balfe's Restaurant.  We returned to the hotel after  after a long day/evening shopping (and some festive cheer!) - we were tired and hungry and even though the kitchen had officially closed she had no problem in looking after us really well. We enjoyed a beautiful meal, some drinks and thoroughly enjoyed the remainder of our stay.  So well done and thank you.  Guaranteed,.....we will be back again,  Geraldine and John (Wicklow)",5,2015,01,02
203,Overnight stay at the Westbury,"I needed a restful break after a long drive and boat trip and before a very hectic Christmas week. The Westbury provided just what I needed. Comfort, stress free stay and high standards in all departments. Especially friendly and helpful staff. Thank you.",5,2015,01,01
203,Brilliant,"I have stayed at this hotel for years and all the staff are lovely and kind. I stay there by myself, girlfriend and family so I find it a hotel that all kinds of people can stay at. The rooms are lovely and I have stayed in the new part a few times and it is beautiful and then the food is lovely as well. If I ever had a problem there the staff were able to sort it out straight away. If you are thinking of staying there I would definitely recommend staying there. ",5,2015,01,01
203,Enjoying Dublin in comfort,"Perfect location to walk the city. Very comfortable hotel with excellent service and attention to detail. Although five stars luxury, we felt that our family room was good value and would definitely stay again on our next visit to Dublin",5,2015,01,01
203,Brilliant break (again!),This was our fourth visit to The Westbury and the staff were once again perfect. The location is ideal for the Grafton Street shops and local restaurants. I'm looking forward to returning to the city and hotel very soon!,5,2015,01,01
203,"Plush, Pretty and Perfectly Placed","We stayed at the Westbury as one of the last hotels we visited on our trip to Ireland. This hotel has a great location and is nestled into a bend of a street so it's not noisy or too much hustle and bustle about. The staff was very friendly, helpful and courteous. The rooms were beautiful and comfortable. Definitely would stay there again.",5,2014,12,30
203,"Excellent location, attentive staff","We spent 2 nights at the Westbury recently.  It is very centrally located for both shops and places of interest such as museums.
All staff were friendly and professional and service was excellent.
We had 2 evening meals in the Wilde restaurant.  Choice is from the all-day menu or from a short set menu offering 3 courses and a glass of prosecco for 40 euro.  Overall we found the food to be of very good standard, well-presented and reasonably priced.

The bedroom was average for this class of hotel with the most comfortable pillows I have found in a hotel for some time - top marks from me as I am a pillow freak!

A little surprising that there was not a power shower but the overbath shower was perfectly adequate.

My only complaint is that the Westbury has a very late check-in - 3.00pm.  The hotel is very well staffed in other departments:  perhaps a slightly larger housekeeping department would allow for earlier check-in.

Overall a very good experience but there were a couple of negatives.  (l)  the overbath shower was adequate but not the power shower which might have been expected.
(2)  A VERY late check-in of 3.00pm.",5,2014,12,30
203,wifes 40th birthday,"Stayed for 1 night for a shopping trip for my wife birthday
Amazing hotel ,with the best most helpful staff of any hotel i have ever stayed in 
we had lunch in Balfes restaurant which was fantastic before going shopping ,Our room was lovely with plenty of space on the 5th floar ,great atmosphere in the hotel ,its a special place",5,2014,12,29
203,The friendliest hotel in the world.,"We stayed here for a short break over Christmas, when the hotel is closed to non-residents.

Nothing's really too much trouble here, the staff are the friendliest I've encountered in a hotel.

We had an upgraded room, with a four poster bed.

We stayed for the Christmas dinner, with a champagne reception. The 5 courses were exceptional. In fact, I could not finish my cheese course.

The location cannot be faulted. I can fall out of the door and into McDaids, or I can walk the 90 seconds to John Kehoe's pub.

It's not the cheapest, but you really do get what you pay for. This must be my 3rd or 4th visit and there'll certainly be future visits.",5,2014,12,29
203,Christmas cocktails ,"Visited a couple of days before Christmas for cocktails, lobby was decorated to the usual elegance and warmth, cocktail were amazing, no extra charged for makers mark. Cocktails were served in crystal glasses. Plenty of nibbles and no issue to request for olives. Really nice couple of hours on comfy chairs.",5,2014,12,28
203,A brilliant Christmas!,"My husband and I stayed in the Westbury from Christmas Eve for 3 days and we had a wonderful trip. In Dublin Hotels are closed to non-residents over the festive period so there was tight security at the main door. We had a smooth check -in and were upgraded to a bigger room. We unpacked and savoured the buzz of Christmas Eve in the Grafton St area. On Christmas Day we breakfasted and had a long walk around and empty Dublin and then had the Christmas meal in the restaurant. It was expensive but good, however, a little too much in quantity  for my taste but none the less good. All the time we stayed in the hotel the staff were as ever delightful and we will definitely be back. Dublin is effectively shut for Christmas and even on Boxing Day or St Stephen's day as the Irish term it there are few shops and restaurants open. All in all a great relaxing time.",5,2014,12,28
203,Business trip,"Great location, great hotel, great staff, all in all very good! From the moment the concierge greeted me upon arrival right the way to check out, I haven't got a bad word to say about the place. The service in the bar, lounge and room service was very good despite the hotel being fairly busy. Must come back soon but next time with the family.",5,2014,12,24
203,Perfect location,"Great hotel located just off the main shopping street, delicious afternoon tea, stylish bar and very comfortable rooms. Very helpful concierge and staff........Perfect place for a nice and relaxing break before Christmas.......very enjoyable experience ",5,2014,12,24
203,Piper,"The Westbury is not only in a prime location but offers the upmost impeccably service in all areas. The resturants offer a diverse selection to satisfy any palet.
I so enjoyed everything about The Westbury, location to all the amazing attractions, pubs, shopping, history.
Can't wait to go back.",5,2014,12,23
203,Fantastic hotel and the staff are the best part,"I recently proposed to my girlfriend in the Westbury and the staff were fantastic at helping me arrange it. Particularly Joseph and Eanna. They could not do enough to make sure that it was a perfect occasion. I could spend this review talking completely about the excellent staff. The hotel is situated off grafton street and is an easy stroll to the shops, pubs, restaurants and main tourist attractions. The food in the restaurant is excellent. I loved sitting in the lobby area up the stairs and simply watching the people come and go. I cannot rate this hotel highly enough!",5,2014,12,23
203,a great position in Dublin,lovely hotel albeit a little tired. terrific position smack in the heart of the shopping centre. lovely staff extremely helpful and a good breakfast as well. worth a visit when visiting Dublin you will be made welcome.,4,2014,12,22
203,Fantastic location...,The best in central Dublin and what a central location. The only thing is that their afternoon tea could be better. The toilettes at the lobby are dated and not up to standard. Otherwise the stand out apart from location was the friendly and efficient service.,4,2014,12,22
203,Excellent location,"We stayed 6 night ,arrive very early in the morning  the hotel was beautiful decorated for Christmas , it was elegant and stylist .we have a small breakfast  at the lobby that was ok (good coffee) At the check in we ask for upgrade that include in the package that we buy with American Express no body have any information about the offers , the hotel  was booked so we never in the 6 days have the upgrade  and nobody cares!!! .the room  was small but comfortable and include a nespresso coffee marker and supply of water..
The mattress was sagging in the middle so after 2 days reporting the problems we were change to another room 
The good thing about this hotel is the location close to everything, just in the pedestrian Street Grafton Street  close to many shops, restaurants and pops.
We paid 25 eu for a taxi from the hotel to airport",4,2014,12,21
203,"Glitzy hotel, perfect location","We spent three nights at the Westbury in November just as Christmas lights were going up in the city.  Its location is perfect and the hotel itself if beautiful, comfortable yet smart and stylish, I loved the lights in both the large lounge and the bar, where it was a treat to relax with a drink at the end of the evening.  We were on a room only basis, we had meant to have breakfast one morning in the hotel but there were so many good eating places within a few steps that we didn't get around to it.  One niggle, we arrived at 2pm on Friday afternoon after lunch at the wonderful Bewleys, our room wasn't ready so we left our luggage and went off for an open top bus tour to familiarise ourselves with the fascinating city.  When we got back we went up to our room (600), I felt like a cup of tea and my husband a coffee from the Nespresso machine.  I noticed there were only two regular tea bags, we would have to share one the next morning! My husband couldn't get the coffee machine to work.  The lead of the machine went down behind the (empty) fridge, it was switched off, so he switched it on and it still wouldn't work.  He called housekeeping and someone arrived after about 30 minutes.  He pulled the fridge out and explained that the pipe at the back of the fridge was turning the coffee machine off!! He adjusted the fridge so it shouldn't happen again. My husband was also disappointed that the tv guide said  that Sky Sports 2 was included but he was not able to access it, the number in the guide was sports news. Not quite the 5 star experience we were expecting. Apart from this however we enjoyed staying at the hotel, we loved the complimentary chocolates each evening,we would recommend it the Westbury.
Apart from these hiccups we really loved the hotel and would recommend it.",4,2014,12,20
203,Business Charity Lunch - Good food and service - Recommend,"Was invited as a guest in a business charity event. Traditional Christmas lunch, starter soup then Turkey/ ham dinner, Christmas pudding then mince pies and coffee/ tea. Enjoyable and recommended. Service efficient. Good location and hotel looked very prestigious / quality.",4,2014,12,20
203,Westbury Christmas Magic,My mother and I stayed in The Westbury Hotel over night. From the time  we drove up to the main door and my car was whisked away for valet parking...until we left the hotel at mid day the following day it was a great stay. The staff are exceptional in their welcome and it seems their aim is to ensure the guests enjoy their stay. The atmosphere is very Christmas and plenty of people milling about. A perfect place to stay and pop out and see the lovely lights on Grafton Street. The breakfast was very nice too. Very relaxing and value for money.,5,2014,12,19
203,"A great hotel, with capacity issues","I stayed at the Westbury with my husband two weeks ago for my birthday.  Most of the experience was very good: the staff are second to none in courtesy, kindness, good humour and care.  The facilities are very good, king bedroom bed and bathroom were very comfortable. The food (breakfast and room service sandwich) is excellent.  I have a few niggles on the costs of extras (drinks in bar, room service sandwiche, coke from minibar...) but the main reason why I have docked two points from this review is that the hotel has real capacity issues. (Note to Tripadvisor, you need to allow a grade between Average and Very Good!!)
The capacity problem manifested itself in us being unable to have a quiet comfortable, sit down drink back at the hotel after an evening in the National Concert Hall, because the Bar and Gallery were packed.  Very kindly staff found us a corner of a low table at which another, not very happy couple, were already sat, and a little later we were able to shift to a slightly more comfortable seating when another couple left.  However, we ended up expediting our drink and heading to our room, when we were in the mood for another couple of drinks had we had the comfort there.  I understand the hotel allow outsiders into both the Bar and Gallery, and it may be kinder to their staying guests to give them access to a reserved area?  
The second example of capacity creaking at the seams was breakfast, when we (and many more guests)  had to wait for 10 minutes at 10.30 am for a table.  We were parked by very apologetic hostesses at a low table in the Gallery, which appeared to be set for breakfast, but ""reserved"".  10 minutes later, we were able to have our delicious breakfast, but the wait was a big no-no for me.
I had written a previous review outlining the above in more detail, and titled ""too busy"".  I decided to withdraw and replace it (Tripadvisor does not allow editing) after the very genuinely caring follow up from the Hotel management which my review gave rise to.  I have not changed my rating (and in both cases I would have liked an option between ""average"" which is really unfair, and ""very good"" which would be equally inaccurate), but I have rendered my comments, I hope, a little more objective.
I sincerely hope that the Westbury take action on the issue of capacity.  While it may be seasonal (December is a busy period), it really lets down an otherwise excellent hotel, more to the point, it lets down customers who have paid a considerable amount for an experience which may be marred at some periods of the year.",3,2014,12,19
203,Wonderful Hotel,"Just returned from a wonderful stay at the Westbury for my birthday. The hotel is beautiful, and the staff are so efficient, friendly and welcoming. The attention to detail is superb and the customer service is second to none. We had dinner at The Wilde restaurant (there were 14 of us) and it was delicious. The breakfast next morning was equally delicious, pity I couldn't do justice to it! I would definitely recommend this hotel, it is situated in the heart of Dublin's best shopping area, close to National Gallery, Stephen's Green and lots of traditional pubs, little coffee shops and boutiques. Must come back sometime and try the afternoon tea which looked lovely.  A truly memorable stay!",5,2014,12,19
203,Stay at the Westbury,"Booked the Westbury for a Christmas shopping trip. Great hotel in the center of the shopping district; good quality beds, clean bathroom and very comfortable. 
It seems to be a hot place to be so the lounge and bar were packed with non-residents. No place to have a drink..",4,2014,12,19
203,Hotel in Dublin,"Wonderful service in a very civilized hotel hidden away just off Grafton Street in Dublin.  Location is great near the best shopping and bistros in Dublin.  Lovely open area on the Lobby level where you can lounge with tea or coffee or a Jameson Irish Whisky.  Very nice large rooms and very quiet.  And the service is a step above in Dublin.  Wi-Fi, breakfast and one dinner included in the Platinum Travel program.",4,2014,12,18
203,Christmas Afternoon Tea,"I brought my elderly parents to the Westbury for the most wonderful seasonal afternoon tea on Tuesday.   The Gallery was wonderfully comfortable and elegant .  Our space was both private and quiet while still providing us with a lovely window into all that was going on around us.  The service was attentive and very professional.  The staff were both polished and friendly.  The food was beautifully presented and tasted every bit as good as it looked.  The 'slim' mulled wine was a lovely touch as was our parting gift of chocolates.

Our day out  just couldn‚Äôt have been better.  It was the perfect christmas treat for my parents .",5,2014,12,18
203,Superb in every way. Five stars.,"I've stayed in dozens of Dublin hotels and The Westbury is hands down the finest hotel in Dublin. Not just because it looks gorgeous, not just because the rooms are beautifully designed (modern yet cosy), the key reason is this: the staff, without exception, are professionals of the highest order. I don't where or how they are trained, or what the secret is, but no other hotel in Dublin or London, Sydney or Rome or Paris matches the gorgeous balance of solicitude and first-class service delivery that's evident at every level in this hotel: reception, room-service, concierge and so on. I only wish that there were more Westbury hotels and I wish (and hope) some of London't alleged 5-star hotels might study the Westbury model. I can't afford to stay here as often as I'd like, but if I could, I'd make no other choice. A superb hotel.",5,2014,12,17
203,What a Gem! Unpretentious Luxury in the heart of the City.,"Normally I end up staying out near our offices in Sandyford, but this time opted to actually enjoy Dublin for a few hours and stay in the centre.  I plan to always stay here in the future!  What a truly lovely hotel in a wonderful location.  A few steps from Grafton street (like about 50 metres),calm, stylish, traditional, unpretentious luxury.  It is a real haven - delightful staff, lovely room, great food.  One thing to check (if you are there on business) is whether your rate includes ""light"" breakfast or a real hearty slap up ""Irish"" full breakfast!  I was a tiny bit disappointed to realize that mine included a continental breakfast when I had been looking forward to the full monty for days!!!!  I could have upgraded it of course, but in fact I didn't have time to do so.  Having said that, it was a 5-star continental breakfast - beautifully served in the gallery bar area.  And real tea leaves in a teapot with a tea-strainer.  Long time since I experienced that.  This goes down as one of the best hotels I have stayed in anywhere and I can't wait for the next excuse to go to Dublin!",5,2014,12,17
203,Splendid,"Super central location off Grafton street.
Very well decorated, with great taste.
Nice bar, deep house playing, for an informal meeting or just a drink, with friendly staff and a great choice.
Recommended.",5,2014,12,16
203,80th Birthday Celebrations! Wow!,"Stayed at The Westbury the last four days of November for my husband's 80th birthday. My family joined us there. 
From the special welcome awaiting us in our room to the wonderful champagne reception in the lounge - it was a celebration fit for a king!
Great praise must be given to Louise Doyle who arranged all this behind the scenes. 
Those staying at The Westbury and those staying at The Croke Park were most impressed. 
I can't speak highly enough of the excellent service we all received. Certainly 5*. 
Finally, a special mention for Andrea, Ida and Niamh who enhanced our experience with their attentiveness. 
If you have a special occasion coming up The Westbury is for you. 
Well done and thanks for the memories. ",5,2014,12,16
203,The feel of Christmas in Dublin,"The Westbury is a great place to stay around Christmas time. A certain magic fairy dust seems to be sprinkled on everyone. From the wonderful door men, concierge and housekeeping staff. Everyone seemed to be filled with a bit of extra sparkle on this stay. The food as always was terrific and everyone goes out of their way to deliver on the Five star promise.",5,2014,12,15
203,A special occasion at the Westbury,"To celebrate my parent‚Äôs 40th wedding anniversary, my family and I had booked them into The Westbury Hotel last weekend for 2 nights. 

We had carefully chosen this hotel for such a a special occasion and the Westbury did not disappoint. From the moment they checked in on the Friday afternoon, they were so well looked after by all the staff. Not only did they get an upgrade to a beautiful deluxe suite, but they were also treated to a bottle of champagne on ice, rose petals in the room and petit fours with a congratulatory message.

Each member of staff was friendly and courteous and nothing was a problem. A particular word of thanks must go to Joseph, the Guest Relations Manager who was so helpful in organising this surprise weekend for my parents and making sure that everything was ‚Äújust right‚Äù.

The location of the hotel could not be better being so adjacent to Grafton St and the Christmas atmosphere at this time of the year was simply magical.

I would highly recommend The Westbury hotel for its luxurious surroundings and warm ambience in the heart of Dublin city.

Thanks again Joseph and all the Staff in the Westbury for making this stay such a wonderful experience for my parents, we look forward to returning soon!

203,Afternoon tea,My daughter treated me to a champagne afternoon tea here on Saturday 17th and it was a lovely experience.  Staff were extremely friendly and attentive my only complaint was the the absence of the piano player or some type of Christmas music,4,2014,12,15
203,Weekend stay in City Centre,"Myself and my husband recently stayed in the Westbury Hotel in Dublin, to get some christmas shopping in. The hotel itself must be the most centrally based hotel in the city, just behind grafton st street flowers. It stands out as a 5 star hotel right from check in as you a greeted warmly by the door staff and helped with your bags up the stairs to the reception. Before we arrived we had received a email to ask us our estimated time of arrival - I told them about 1.30pm but explained that there was no panic with the room and that we would be happy to have a look after for a hour if it was not ready. But of course, it was ready for 1.30 - nice touch! The room itself was beautifully furnished, lovely soft interiors, quite small in size, but had full bath, king size bed and sitting area. This place is all about location! It is not the type of hotel you come to relax with a book in the foyer with a glass of wine - this is the place you go if you want to treat yourself to the shops, a good cocktail and a classy night out the town. The hotel was full of buzz, mini groups and parties, full of glamour! We had a fully cooked breakfast in the Wilde Restaurant the next morning - TOP class. The continental selection was vast, service was excellent and the cooked breakfast was generous, high quality and extremely tasty. All in all - this place is pricey, but if you have the cash to splash, you get great quality service and a location that just cannot be beaten!",4,2014,12,15
203,Best location in Dublin. Top top hotel.,"My wife and I stayed here to celebrate our anniversary, and we were blown away. This is a very classy hotel, with super friendly staff - hotels like they used to be. There is nowhere better to base yourself to explore Dublin - you are walking distance from all the best shopping, restaurants and pubs. The only drawback is if you're interested in the gym - its pretty small, and the equipment could be improved.",5,2014,12,14
203,"Good location, nice standard but not giving it away.",Enjoyed the stay.  Staff were great. Food in Bar was nice.  Room was fine but not exceptional. Valet parking helped. Good central location for Grafton Street and walking distance to Theatres and Temple Bar,4,2014,12,14
203,Fantastic experience - another world!,"From the minute we arrived in at hotel reception it was clear we were somewhere special. Everywhere in the hotel there are little things which make this a wonderful hotel to stay in. We were presented with hot cloths on arrival. All the staff were very helpful, no request was any trouble or problem. In fact all the staff were very friendly and you we were greeted warmly by everybody there. The room itself was luxurious and comfortable and I had one of the best night's sleep of my life. For breakfast there was a huge choice in the buffet and everything looked so good! In conclusion a beautiful hotel with great staff in such a central location, will definitely be back, hopefully soon!",5,2014,12,14
203,"Amazing service, friendly staff","Myself and my 3 sisters were initially weary about the price of afternoon tea but a beautiful hotel, and the lovely manner and smile of the young Irish man who explained our sandwiches and desserts to us made the experience well worth it. We will be back",5,2014,12,13
203,Elegant,"Everything about our one night stay was perfect. 
Checking in was a doddle, complete with a welcome hot towel - nice touch!
We were upgraded thanks to Amex to a sumptuous room, which was tastefully styled and with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.
The lobby area was, again, styled beautifully with comfy and functional chairs and sofas with a roaring fire at one end.
The staff were well organised and helpful to the correct levels. 
I can't fault it.
Thank you for a lovely stay.
Would be my first choice if I come back to Dublin.",5,2014,12,12
203,Great location,"Stayed at this hotel in November and the location is excellent, right beside Grafton Street and in close proximity to a huge selection of bars and restaurants.  The room was very comfortable and without any noise so sleep quality was good.  The only complaint is the extremely long wait on both mornings for breakfast.  On Sat. morning we arrived for breakfast at 10.40 and were informed there was a short wait (approx. 10 mins). We were finally seated at 11.30 and had food served by 11.40 (1 hour wait for breakfast is not acceptable).  On Sunday morning the wait wasn't quite so long (about 20 mins).  Some people were offered the option of having breakfast in the lounge on Sunday but that wasn't offered to us.  Food on both mornings was very nice.  
Excellent location, comfortable rooms and good food but the breakfast service needs to be sorted out.",4,2014,12,10
203,Overnight Stay,"My daughter Michelle booked us into the Westbury on Sunday last as a surprise having  attended the Andre Rieu concert in the O3. We found it very difficult to access due to the one way system and ongoing roadworks in Dublin plus the lack of signage provided by Dublin City Council didn't help. A phone call to the hotel and we were put on to the concierge  section and a very helpful gentleman guided us in. We are deeply thankful to him, he was very patient and extremely helpful. The staff on duty were very welcoming and the porter who delivered our cases was very helpful. The hotel is very plush, full of people and there was a great buzz in general. Our room on the 5th floor was very comfortable, the bed was nice and high and we had a god night's sleep in it. 
The only issue that we had was the cost at ‚Ç¨240 for the night was pretty saucy and that did not include breakfast. Breakfast was an additional ‚Ç¨50 for the two of us and to be honest we couln't justify spending that amount of money for this.
Overall it was an experience, staff were very friendly and helpful, the hotel is very nice, well laid out but the expense could not be justified.",4,2014,12,10
203,Good stay,"stayed there for 3 nights when i was in Dublin in the month of april last year, location good ,food nice ,comfort superb .best part is the lane out side the hotel has everything from breakfast at 6 am to late night party ..",4,2014,12,10
203,Top marks - yet again!,"Stayed at the Westbury for our fourth time - it never disappoints. Had a lovely cocktail in the bar on Saturday night and the breakfast on Sunday was as good as ever - lots of choice and nothing is too much trouble for the staff. Have to give a special mention to Joseph (guest relations manager) who spoke to us on check out - I had mentioned our room was slightly noisier than usual - we stayed in room overlooking grafton street this time but on previous times had been at the other side - he apologised and explained the windows are quadruple glazed to keep the noise out. We will be back again next year, the atmosphere, staff and attention to detail are second to none in the westbury. Even when fully booked on a busy pre Christmas weekend they still make everything look effortless. ",5,2014,12,07
203,Absolutely love this place. 10/10!!,"Here again this year for my Birthday. Beds are very comfortable, rooms quiet and the service is 2nd to none. Hotel looks great decorated for Christmas. Felt well looked after and nothing was too much trouble. I will be back soon.",5,2014,12,06
203,"5* worth it, some issues don't spoil overall experience","Location is good, in the centre of town, right next to their version of London's Carnaby Street.

Restaurant is the bees knees, and the cafe in the basement is top notch.

some small issues with the room being ready on time, and then giving us a twin room instead of the requested double was a little side distraction.

conceirge was brilliant, the front desk gave us a map which was helpful.

in a word: BOOK",4,2014,12,05
203,The best location in town,I picked this over the 4 seasons due to the reviews on here.  I have it 4 stars not 5 because it's a drop out dated in the rooms.  I had a nice big suite biggest room I've ever had in Europe.  I paid for a taxi to and from the airport other wise ZERO need for one. This place is steps from everything.  When I come back I have a feeling the 4 seasons might be a drop more upscale but I WILL stay here.  Loved it.  ,4,2014,12,04
203,SHEER LUXURY,"We have stayed at this hotel many times, but never during the Christmas period.  Christmas Afternoon Tea seemed like something we should experience, we were not disappointed.  We were made to feel really welcome, the staff very attentive, sadly we couldn't get through all of the food. The hotel was beautifully decorated and there was such a buzz about the place from shoppers relaxing after a day in the city, the Irish know how to shop, we have never seen so many shopping bags departing with guests each morning from the hotel.

This has been a new experience for us and I would urge other travelers to give it a try, it certainly puts you in the festive mood.  We are already making our plans for next year.",5,2014,12,04
203,Night away in Dublin,"The hotel is lovely, the room was spotless and very comfortable. There were lots of lovely touches which really made us feel spoiled, and a reminder that we were receiving 5 star service.
The staff at check in were excellent and very welcoming and accommodating. The concierge was fantastic, he went above and beyond to assist us when we had trouble finding the hotel by car. I fail to find a fault with this hotel.",5,2014,12,03
203,Top class facilities and excellent location,"Having stayed here a number of times previously, it was great to see that the standards had not dropped. The staff were very helpful and good humoured. We had an excellent breakfast in the Wilde restaurant. The hotel is perfectly located, beside Grafton Street and St Stephen's Green (where the new Christmas Market is located). We had an issue with some late night noise from the Bar below due to prolonged moving of furniture, however this was quickly dealt with and the Customer Relations Manager Joseph Downing ensured we left as happy customers.",4,2014,12,03
203,Disappointed,"My husband & I come to Ireland twice a year to visit family and friends. We booked into the Westbury hotel for a night out with my college buddies because of it central location & the excellent reviews it had received. Upon arrival we were directed to the check-in desk and even though there was only 1 person ahead of us and tons of staff wandering around we were made wait for 7-8 minutes to check in. Once we got served, the young lady helping us couldn't confirm if our room was prepaid or not. She wanted to run the full amount for the room on my credit card. After we persisted it, she eventually called over a supervisor and it was discovered that the room had been prepaid and our credit card should only be run through for incidentals. Once we got to the room it was small but perfect. 
After a great dinner out, we returned to the hotel with another couple to have a nightcap in the Gallery. However, the young lady at the top of the stairs told us we couldn't. In fact she was quite insistent that we would have to go downstairs to Balfes. I got the impression we weren't the right sort for the Gallery even though there were 3 dot.com millionaires in our party of 4. 
We did go downstairs to Balfes as instructed and had a great experience as the staff were very welcoming and efficient. The next morning when we went down to breakfast we were told there was no space for us again. We were told we could go to the Gallery or we could stand and wait for 10 minutes. We agreed to wait in the Gallery for a table in the main restaurant and we were directed to a dirty table that still had the remains of someone's breakfast on it. Ten minutes later they did come and get us. When seated in the main restaurant we were surrounded by empty, dirty tables that were not clean during the 35 minutes we spent in the restaurant. The cooked breakfast was very nice but the continental breakfast was very basic and not 5 star quality.
On check out we had the same chaotic experience as we had with check in. No one knew who was next in line. Once we got to the desk the gentleman who helped us was very kind. After check out we headed downstairs to get our car that was valet parked. We had called 15 mins ahead as instructed but still had to wait for 10m on the street before the car appeared. I know none of the things I mentioned here are really big things and you could easily brush them off but together they ruined our stay at what we hoped would become our home away from home on future trips.",3,2014,12,03
203,Possibly the loveliest hotel I've ever stayed in,"My mum and I spent a couple of days at the Westbury.  I had never heard of it before I booked it.  I picked it over the Shelbourne as its website confirms that it has tea making facilities in its bedrooms whereas the Shelbourne's website does not mention this! We actually only spent one night there but we arrived early on the Thursday and found our room was available straight away.  We didn't have to check out until 12 noon the next day so it felt we'd really had a long, restful break by the time we left!  We had afternoon tea in the lounge on the first day and then breakfast in the Wilde restaurant and a drink in Balfes the next day.  All of which were excellent. The location was fabulous and our twin room was quiet, clean and comfortable.  But by far the best thing was the staff - they were all young, friendly, happy and super-helpful. Only one small point - the wifi was a bit patchy in our room although strong in the communal areas. I would say this is possibly the loveliest hotel I have ever stayed at.",5,2014,12,02
203,Great location,"The recent stay was a bit disappointing! Firstly, I had to pay for parking and this is certainly not the case with many similar quality hotels in Dublin. Also, this was not the case in the past. Secondly, when I enquires if it was possible to get a late check-out , one to two hours, I was informed that it was no problem but the cost was ‚Ç¨50. Thirdly, I asked if I could at least leave my car in the car park for  approx two further hours after check out, again I was informed that it would cost me ‚Ç¨3.80 ( I think!) an hour extra. I queried this and stated this wasn't the case before.....response was that it was a busy period! Not happy and doubt if I'd stay there again.",3,2014,12,02
203,You could not find a better location,"For a weekend visit in a city, I always try to find the best location. You always tend to walk a lot between shops, restaurants, theatres and sights. If you want to drop off your shopping bags or freshen up for dinner you really do not want to spend half an hour in a taxi going to and from your hotel. This was my main reason for choosing the Westbury and I could not have made a better choice. Located just off Grafton Street, a few minutes nice stroll to either St. Stephen's Green, Trinity College or the bustling (at night) Temple Bar area you simply can not find a better location. And the hotel itself definitely earns its five star status. Excellent service, nice spacious well kept rooms. We were told that the restaurant at floor level was good but we hadn't time to try it this time around, but we will certainly return.",4,2014,12,01
203,5 star experience,"My husband and I are on a 3 week UK trip/honeymoon. We booked this hotel on the ferry over from Wales and got an unreal deal on the presidential suite (thanks tripadviser!). The room was awesome as I am sure all the rooms in this hotel are. The staff were helpful from the second we pulled up in our car to the second we left. The location is perfect and within walking distance of shopping and lots of pubs and restaurants. It is about a 10 minute walk to the temple bar area. The staff made it super easy for us to get our sight seeing started. You can buy the hop on hop off tickets right at the front desk. Breakfast was delicious. My only complaint is that the water in the shower pretty much went off during one of my showers. It came back on and was only low for maybe 2 minutes. Hopefully this is not normal! 
Overall we love, love, loved our stay! Can't wait to come back and spend some more time in Ireland.",5,2014,11,28
203,repeat visit,"Returned to Dublin so stayed at the Westbury again.

As previous visit, very nice welcome from doorman and reception team. Very professional and friendly.

Room top notch, with comfy bed, good linen and nice fluffy towels in bathroom.

Popped into bar for a nightcap on first night and barman was also very pleasant.

Breakfast was to usual high standards, with nice welcome, good service and good continental selection.

Overall a great place to stay, right in the city centre and all staff seemed happy and pleased you stay there.

Will definately stay here again when in Dublin",5,2014,11,28
203,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"Our first time in Dublin and this hotel made a perfect first impression!  Beautifully decorated - Xmas spirit was everywhere when we stayed there.  Location, as many have said already, was superb.  We managed to walk everywhere from here.  We covered Trinity College, the Brazen Head pub, Guinness Storehouse - all on foot from this great starting point.  The bedroom was on the small side but compensated by the huge bed.  Am not a huge fan of a shower in a tub but small price to pay for an otherwise hugely comfortable stay.  The reception and other staff were very helpful and happily extended our checkout time on request.  We also had afternoon tea in the hotel (Westbury champagne tea) which was just perfect in a perfect setting.",4,2014,11,27
203,Excellent its a must,"Ok it was a little pricy but as this was a treat for my sisters 40th I decided why not.We did have an issue with no twin room on arrival but this was fixed promptly and then followed with an apology in the form of a hand written letter by the manager which I thought was an excellent response. Having stayed in many hotels I would have to say this was the best by far for everything.Food was beautiful, staff super and the room was of a high standard. I would most definatly stay here again and would advise anyone to stay. Prime location a true gem.      ",5,2014,11,27
203,Weekend Stay,"Myself and my partner celebrated our anniversary here a few weeks ago. We had the most fantastic stay and I could not fault a single thing. From the moment we pulled up outside to checking out, we were looked after so well. The staff were fantastic, a special thanks to Louise (duty manager), who showed us to our room and could not have done more to make us feel more welcome or relaxed. We enjoyed a few drinks in the gallery, our room was amazing and such a great location. We had a beautiful breakfast the following morning too. This was my first time staying in The Westbury and it felt like a once in a lifetime experience, but I will definitely be back. Thanks to all for a magical time.",5,2014,11,26
203,first class,"this hotel is continuing to uphold old fashioned values of quality and service which some of the newer trendier hotels miss by a mile . Room quiet,well appointed,enormous comfortable bed,all usual facilities and excellent bathroom . Staff efficient courteous and helpful .

Nice rooms with a tasteful interior. A pleasant experience with very professional and friendly staff,5,2014,11,25
203,"A very good choice and, a few comments","I recently enjoyed a three night stay at the Westbury and would like to share my experience.
The Westbury is in a top location, near to all the major city sights which was a big plus for me having never been to Ireland before.

ROOM:
The bed was very comfortable and the room was large; with lots of space to spread.
A couple of issues with the room though.  
I did find the controls for the lights hard to reach from the bed, and had to get myself up to turn on the lights. This was largely to do with the bed being so huge so can't have it all I guess!
The bathroom was a let down here.  I had to step into a bath to shower, and found it very unnerving to step down from such a height.  Evidently I was not the only one, as you could see cracks in the wall tiles, where the towel rail meets the wall.  Previous guests had obvioulsy grabbed hold of the towel rack to ease themselves down onto the floor.  One way to remedy this may be for the hotel to install some grab rails at that end of the bath.
I did ask at reception when checking out if the hotel had rooms with a walk-in shower and was advised they do, so if you are not too steady on your feet I suggest you make a request one of those rooms.

RESTAURANTS/BAR:
I enjoyed a drink or two in the Marble Bar on the evenings I was there.  Top bar staff on the Sunday evening; the barman remembered my drink (and indeed others in my group) after that first night.

The brekfast restaurant was swift in seating people and staff were quick with tea/coffe/toast.  There is enough variety on the continental buffet if you don't want anything cooked.  I alternated between that and having a cooked breakfast.  

RECEPTION AREA:
There are very few places to wait if you arrange to meet others at reception to go out.   Although there appears to be a lot of tables and chairs nearby, they are used by the restaurant for meals and usually had 'reserved' signs on them. There is a large ornamental table taking up a lot of room near to the reception desk.  Maybe this could be turned that area into a meet/greet place, with some chairs or couches.  Just a thought.

STAFF:
The reception staff were doing an admirable job when we arrived which was obviously a very busy period with people checking out from Saturday evening stays, and those arriving wanting rooms.  Our flight had us arriving too early to check in as the rooms were not yet cleaned. No matter, we went for a walk around the city while the concierge took care of the luggage.  It was all delivered to the rooms when we returned. 

The business centre computers (two) are in a booth and very cramped for space. There is hardly any room to put any paperwork down if you need to read somthing while using the computer. One staff member (Eden) was very obliging when my colleague was having trouble prining somthing and went out of her way to assist.

In short all staff that I encountered, from the conceige/s, to reception, to the restaurant and bar staff, all provided very good service throughout my stay.",5,2014,11,25
203,Westbury does not meet the Bar in client services and customer care.,"I love to stay at Leading Hotels because staff of the hotel's are proud of their remarkable properties and happy to provide great experiences and wonderful customer services.   The Westbury, this evening did not meet the high bar set by other The Leading Hotels of the World.

Like many business travelers,  I have a hectic schedule that has me arriving to great cities in late hours and hungry.   Given the days a year a travel a try to avoid eating in airports, airplanes and hotel rooms.   

The last place I want to eat, is my room when there is a beautiful and well appointed lobby I could sit in wind down.   My request to have a late night nibble has never been a problem at any other Leading Hotels of the World.   I've had lat night snacks in the lobby's of the Crillion in Paris, The Charles in Munich (very lovely),  the Villa Magna in Madrid. Every time the team has been gracious and hospitable,  and I've had a love late night snack to relax after a long day.

NOT THE WESTBURY DUBLIN. 

Shortly after my arrival at 11:45PM, I asked the barman and waitress if I could order something small eat with my spring water.   They said policy is no food service after 10:30.   I ask the night Manager Mr. Finnigen if it were possible if I could order room service in the lobby since the hotel was only offering Bar service only with no snacks.   Mr Finnigen said that  would be impossible because food could only be ordered and consumed in the rooms during non-consession hours.   He was very clear those are the rules and he would not consider making any allowance to a guest request.   

To make sure there was no confusion asked if I could order from my room and bring down to which he  said firmly and abruptly  ""all food is to be ordered and consumed in the room during non-concession hours...those are the rules"".   He made it clear that he had no intention letting me eat in the lobby.

Unfortunately I must say the Leading Hotel's of the World mark is not a sign universal great service and pride in customer care.",2,2014,11,24
203,Can't wait to head back,"Opulence and grandeur wrapped with a comfortable bow...
Decorations for Christmas are beautiful but subtle not overloading visually...
Toilets were gleaming
Best coffee I have ever had in a hotel bar
Outstanding staff who are obviously trained to a very high standard from doorman to management. Well done to all 
",5,2014,11,24
203,Make the music stop,"This is an excellent hotel in a fantastic location.  It's 4 star, friendly, clean and everything you would expect in a fine urban hotel.  Except they have one major issue to fix....   The music piped in through this hotel is terrible.  Not just bad, but noticeably grating.  Like the music they torture prisoners with.  Like the background music in Rollerball (1975) that's loud and never stops and eventually leaves you feeling stressed out.  By day 4 I was running through the lobby with my fingers in my ears.  ",4,2014,11,24
203,excellent,"Stayed here on 22nd November and thoroughly enjoyed the whole ""experience"". From the valet parking on arrival until check-out the words ""customer care"" were fully demonstrated. There was a minor blip with the door keys and this was sorted out very quickly and with lots of humour! The hot towels on check in really hit the spot and were appreciated very much.",5,2014,11,24
203,"The Westbury , always a pleasure. ","I get few chances throughout the year to get into the Dublin city centre and a visit to The Westbury is always in my itinerary & it never disappoints. I stayed on the 22nd of November with my wife for s a day of shopping and some relaxation. Upon check in the staff were as usual professional, courteous and friendly . We had a pleasure of meeting the guest relations manager Joseph , he had plenty of advice for the best places to shop and made us feel that we were  getting the VIP treatment, he had plenty of good suggestions and couldn't have been more helpful. We had lunch in Balfes, the new addition to the hotels food offering and we were very impressed with both the menu options and the food when it arrived was excellent. The Westbury will quickly become part of our pre - Christmas traditions. Thanks to all the staff and we are looking forward to our next stay ",5,2014,11,24

203,The ideal hotel in Dublin,"Jack & Joan
Our friends recommended the Westbury and they nailed it! Beautiful spot just off Grafton Street in the middle of Dublin's happening downtown. Great rooms, restaurants and bar in the Hotel. The staff could not have been better: recommended Fade St. Social for dinner.....packed and full of energy.....one of the top 10 restaurant experiences ever and we're restaurant groupies.",5,2014,11,20
203,Great accommodations with perfect lcation,"My son & I stayed at The Westbury for three nights in October.  From check-in until we left, the service was perfect!  We has a large, beautiful room with a well appointed and expansive bathroom.  The location is ideal for shopping and visiting museums and attractions such as Trinity College.",4,2014,11,19
203,Fantastic stay at the Westbury,As usual the Westbury Hotel and staff was as welcoming and comfortable as many times before.  The Christmas decorations are worth going to see alone but add to the magical experience in their own right.  The Saddle Bar is a fantastic place to retire to just before bed.  My husband had the gym all to himself and made good use of it.  I just read the lovely Irish magazine beside the bed before making good use of location for a spot of shopping and later on a concert.  Will be back again.,5,2014,11,19
203,The only the place to stay in Dublin,"I arrived late, tired and wet after a horrid train journey. I was welcomed by the receptionist who offered me water and organised a taxi to get me to dinner that I was late for as quickly as possible. He even reminded me that there would be a brolly in the wardrobe for me to use! Lovely room in excellent condition. Breakfast was excellent although the service was a little bit slow because it was very busy. Perfect location with all the shops of grafton street just a stone throw away",5,2014,11,18
203,Good Hotel in a great location,"Had a brief stay earlier this month.  The room was good, but small and beginning to look a bit tired.  The breakfast and location more than made up for this, and were great.  Staff were very accommodating and friendly.",4,2014,11,16

6pm, I think.  What a wonderful space, overlooking Grafton Street. Great seating. Superb choice of good food and wine.  Great service.A great space to rendezvous with groups of friends or just on your own. for every occasion.

Simply one of the best hotel lobbies in Dublin and Ireland.",5,2014,11,15
203,home from home,"my husband and myself stayed a night at the westbury  recently and it was so enjoyable. from our check in we had such attention, As my husband is in a wheel chair i was so thankful for all the help from staff even in the dining room where he was helped to cut his food as he has only the use of left arm. Our room was.excellent and ticked all the boxes for disabled person . We hope to return in the spring again .I would like to mention Joseph Downing guest relations who greeted us on our arrival. this hotel is so convenient to Grafton St which was good for me.

203,Just ok,"Stayed here with my mother for a weekend while we went shopping and to see a play.  I just felt for a hotel of its calabar and what we paid it could of been better.  The room was basic very basic and looked out onto a grubby rooftop.  

When we were check in out we were almost charged for extras that we never incurred and no real apology was made for that.

We also had afternoon tea on evening. The hot chocolate was delicious but everything including the sandwiches were a ridiculous price. 

All in all not a horrible experience but no little extra touches to be found which would be nice considering how much your paying.",3,2014,11,14
203,Welcome back 'old friend',"First time in Dublin, first time in a Westbury hotel. This is a charmer that made me feel at home straight away. Friendly staff, even when you arrive at 11pm. Close to main pedestrian mall, shops and historic areas such as Trinity. Business staff very friendly and did my urgent copying free (although Apple computers need an auto scrubbing of your web browsing history- found someone's email in box open when I logged on). Bed was large and comfortable- although don't need the posts (see photos) as there are no curtains or wenches in the bed- only makes the room seem smaller. Bathroom wasn't large step in shower) but had all a bloke needs, even an extendable mirror so I can see my face when shaving. 

But strange Irish design flaw saw the only light switch for the bathroom stationed by the apartment entry! None by your bed or on the outside of the bathroom. Weird, especially for an older bloke who has to get up 4-5 times a night.
 
I'm coming back to Dublin to see tourist sights, and will stay here- so comfortable its like putting on your favourite gloves or old shoes. For example, no bain-maries for brekkie, fresh cooked eggs etc.",5,2014,11,13
203,Superb Experience,"Stayed here for one night during our honeymoon before catching a flight from Dublin airport. Can't say enough about this hotel other than it was simply incredible. From the initial meet and greet of the doorman, to the friendly welcome of staff and the manager, this hotel met our expectations and more. The hotel is perfectly located for access to Dublin's best shops and restaurants. Our only regret is not staying another night. ",5,2014,11,12
203,Warm & Friendly,"From arrival at the curbside to check in, the staff were very warm, friendly and most welcoming. The Concierge (3 of them) was most helpful and cheerful, and very informative. I particularly enjoyed afternoon tea, drinks and dinner in the lounge area off reception; the gallery. The hotel is perfectly located in the centre od Dublin. ",5,2014,11,12
203,Room not ready for 6pm check in! ,"Waited 1.5hrs for check in and did not get much explanation except repeatedly being told it would be ready soon and ended up waiting 1.5hrs when we wanted to sleep before going for dinner. We were exhausted as this was the last night of our visit after a hectic few days so were looking forward to a nice hotel haven in the city centre...and then opted to skip dinner plans to take a nap which ruined our evening plans. Great location, nice rooms but no proper air con in balmy July summer so we have x4 fans humming on the room floor we had to angle and co-ordinate which wasn't ideal for such a high end property. Some noise coming through from the busy bar/club next door also which was surprising. Would we go back and stay-probably not. ",2,2014,11,11
203,Two Separate Stays in Sept. that could have been better,"My husband and I stayed here twice during a month long trip. First visit was better than the second.The hotel is in a great location for walking to restaurants, shopping and catching the buses. The hotel lobby and bar area are very grand, with staff that were attentive and very service oriented. No complaints there.  Rooms were not very spacious and the bathrooms were very small. Staff at the front desk were pleasant, but not very well informed about the rooms or some of the hotel services. We had reserved and prepaid for a king room, but at both visits we were given a queen room. We asked at check in on our second stay and were assured that our room had a king size bed. The manager on duty had the same excuse both times ""refurbishing and not sure what type beds are in the room"". What? How hard would it be to make a list so you could refer to it when reviewing reservations and assigning reserved rooms. Both times, we were left waiting and uniformed in our room for 45 min while the manager scrambled to find us a king room after promising she would correct our situation in just a few minutes. Very poor service not to call us and keep us updated on the delay. Both times we had to initiate the contact with the front desk to ascertain what was happening with our room. And then we had to wait another 30 min after that to get to our new room. At the second stay, our room had malfunctioning air conditioning. Front desk gave us incorrect info on how to operate the air cond. After struggling with no air for a couple of hours, maintenance was finally called to our room only to discover that front desk was quite wrong about how to operate the air. He said it was a new method and apparently not all staff were aware. Really? All of this hassle could have been avoided with a detail oriented hotel lay out and some important informational daily updates for the front desk staff. Also,front desk also gave us incorrect info re laundry services that nearly made us miss the daily deadline. They should absolutely know about every service since they are point of contact for guests. Our last day there, we had to put up with constant hammering and banging, cords and open electrical panels all down the hallway while they worked on the hotel's air cond system. This hotel is not inexpensive and we were very disappointed in the level of service from the front desk staff and manager. The room we were finally given on our second stay really should not have been rented out given all the noise and upheaval going on with the air cond system. It was just one too many mistakes from the front desk staff that could only make us conclude it was poorly managed. They could take a lesson from the food and beverage staff. They are spot on.",3,2014,11,08
203,Nice cocktail but ..!,"Was here Friday night after work for a cocktail, it was a nicely made manhattan however the morello cherry was very dry and didn't add much to the drink unfortunately, that being said it was made exactly the way I asked. I felt like something small to eat and decided on the Dublin Bay Prawn salad , I was very disappointed, the salad came in a regular small tumbler glass, with mainly ice berg, some of the tiniest prawns I have ever seen with  2 large prawns cut butterfly on the top and on a side a small scoop of almost brown avocado. I was so disappointed. We won't eat here again, a pity as the lobby area is stunning and so beautiful.",3,2014,11,08
203,"Location excellent, but too pricy","Stayed 4 nights. Location is perfect. Everything within walking distance. Hotel is 'old school' if that's what you like- the music, carpets etc. Very good service. Room was large, but dated and bathroom was very small. Room was very clean. Wifi hardly worked in the room which is annoying. Price is very high I felt for the quality of property ",3,2014,11,06
203,Lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Excellent, centrally located hotel.  Attentive service and great restaurant recommendations.  Wifi was a bit unreliable, but otherwise great experience.  Check-in and check-out were quick and efficient, and the rooms were comfortable.",5,2014,11,05
203,Perfection,Conveniently Located just off Grafton Street.  Beautifully decorated with lovely furniture and decor. Rooms gorgeous. Staff exceptionally polite and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble and they are always so pleasant. Lovely atmosphere and when I come to a Dublin again I would like to stay at this hotel.,5,2014,11,04
203,Wonderful accommodations,"We stayed here for 4 nights and had a splendid stay.  The room was comfortable and the service staff took great care of us.  It's very convenient if you are looking to stay downtown near the attractions  - Grafton Street, Trinity College, etc.  A bit pricey but worth it.",5,2014,11,03
203,Westbury Hotel  Dublin,Once again we found our stay at the Westbury Hotel amazing in every respect. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful; the rooms and facilities were first class; the ambience of the hotel is fantastic; the food excellent.  I would not consider staying in any other city centre hotel in Dublin other than the Westbury which I why we continue to come back time after time.  The staff were brilliant and at our request very kindly arranged restaurant reservations for us at two excellent restaurants.  Had a wonderful weekend and look forward to our next trip back to the Westbury. ,5,2014,11,03
203,Great hotel,"Just returned from a two night stay on the wild package,four of us celebrated a friends 50th birthday and I can not say how helpful and welcoming the staff were, a special mention to Mathew who took great care of us on both nights making our meal a fabulous experience.
Having stayed at the hotel on two previous occasions I can highly recommend the hotel.",5,2014,11,02
203,Perfection!,"My family and I recently stayed at the Westbury for one week while visiting our daughter who is studying abroad. The Westbury is everything anyone would want in a 5 star hotel. Comfort, great dining, and amazing service. The staff was so friendly and helpful from the doormen right through to the fabulous housekeepers! The gallery with its warm fireplace and cozy couches was elegant , the food delicious and the service impeccable. The location cannot be beat, right off Grafton street where you can shop, eat and just watch the world go by... great fun yet the hotel is a very peaceful oasis to return to after a day of exploring the magical city. We cannot wait until we return , hopefully very soon!",5,2014,11,02
203,A gem in the center of Dublin,"My wife and I stayed at The Westbury on the advice of an Irish friend on our way to a plastic surgery meeting at which I was faculty.  The entire experience was perfect--an excellent staff, lovely accommodations, perfect location in walking distance of everything we wanted to see. I would stay there again without hesitation.",5,2014,11,02
203,Birthday trip,"The Westbury Hotel is a fabulous facility in the centre of Dublin where you feel really special. The staff are very friendly, helpful and respectful and the service excellent. The rooms are fresh, simplistic and comfortable and the gallery and bar areas opulent and luxurious. Our two night stay with friends was a treat for my husband's 60th Birthday and we all loved it!",5,2014,11,02
203,Wonderful hotel,"Everything about this hotel said 'classy'. This is a very classy hotel, from the elegant young ladies serving in the bars & restaurants in their chic  black dresses,to the helpful & friendly front desk staff & the housekeeping was second to none as befits a 5star hotel. We will definitely be back.",5,2014,11,02
203,Amazing,"Stayed here last night and I have to say what an experience. We loved everything. Our room was lovely, from all the mirrors, excellent lighting, separate shampoo and conditioner, proper hair dryer, proper hangers, iron and ironing board, robes, slippers, nespresso coffee, heating controls the list goes on. It's all the attention to all the little details that makes it special and I cannot wait to return. This is only the second hotel I've stayed in in Ireland that I want to return to, it's truly 5 star. The staff were also fantastic Louise and Tommy. I don't know how they remember your name!! I would love to stay for a week! Mind you after the breakfast this morning you'd be a stone heavier. ",5,2014,11,02
203,Fabulous staff and service,"We chose The Westbury Hotel as we got engaged and wanted somewhere lovely to celebrate. There were so many staff who made our stay so fantastic..Joseph, the guest relation manager, Louise, the duty manager. Keith on reception, a real natural ambassador for the hotel. Marta in the bar and Robert and Yola in the restaurant really stood us as they gave us excellent service. We enjoyed our stay v much and wanted to thank everyone.",5,2014,11,02
203,Fabulous,"From the moment we drove up to checking out it was a wonderful two night experience . Keith at front desk took care of our reservation He was very professional and friendly making us feel very welcome , he is a great face representing the Westbury hotel . 
Room was fantastic beautiful fourposter bed and the best pillows I've ever in my life used... Toiletries in bathroom were of top  quality and the turndown service was an added bonus.
Breakfast was a five-star service with a beautiful buffet...
Little extras like bottled water when you check in and out also at the turndown service nothing seem too much for the staff at the Westbury Hotel everybody we came in contact with was courteous and had a smile on their face
The location of this Hotel is in the heart of Dublin city and is easy access to every part of the city
Overall We will be definitely returning to the Westbury Hotel Dublin",5,2014,11,01
203,Truly great experience! ,"I will certainly be back. The location, the professional staff, the quality food, the relaxing and quality decor, all add up to the exceptional experience! Remember to keep the windows closed, otherwise you will be woken by delivery trucks in the morning! Once closed you're in a heavenly cocoon. Don't think about it... Book it. ",5,2014,11,01
203,Lovely Hotel and friendly staff,This is a great hotel situated close to Grafton Street. Staff are friendly and helpful which is very refreshing. Other 5 star hotels could learn a lot from this establishment. Had a few teething problems with room but sorted immediatly. Nice little touches for kids including a teddy bear. Breakfast although 25 euros  each was very nice. I highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying in it again. ,5,2014,11,01
203,Great place for a family stay,"From first moment staff couldn't have been more helpful
Lovely breakfast
Great room
We had a suite with our teenage son 
This worked well 
Lovely roof terrace with view of city. 
Beds a bit soft for my taste great bathroom

Bar really nice with good service and great guiness 

We could walk anywhere we wanted from here
",5,2014,10,31
203,"Great location, friendly service","The hotel is located in the heart of Dublin, right in the middle of a great shopping, pub, and restaurant area. Staff are friendly and helpful. The bed is soft and super comfy. Turndown service is classy with turned on classical or jazz music. The bathroom is clean and has good amenities. The lobby area is gorgeous and serves great drinks. I found the wall to be pretty thing. Got a room by the elevators and I could hear people coming in and out all night, including someone in the room next door. A couple of things that the hotel can improve on...

1. The gym. It is tiny. It has one piece for each equipment (i.e. one treadmill, one rower, one set of free weights which go up to 20kgs, one elliptical, one bike, and one universal weight machine). Luckily, the gym is not always busy. Speaking of which, I am not sure why it opens from 7am to around 10pm. There is nobody monitoring the gym anyway. And when you travel on business, sometimes you just can't make it back to the hotel by 10pm and 7am would be too late to work out if you have to be ready for the office by 8am. Apparently, there is a gym behind the hotel that you can use for 10 euros a day. You will need to specifically ask the front desk about this. I accidentally found this out by talking to a front desk person. Not sure why the hotel doesn't offer this for the guests for free since the hotel's gym is so tiny anyway.

2. The included ""light"" breakfast. Our rate included light breakfast. Well, when I checked in (twice in two weeks), no one bothered to tell me it was included. I found this out through a coworker that it was included. With all my travels, generally, the person checking you in will go through what's included in the rate. Just didn't happen to me or another person I was traveling with.",4,2014,10,30
203,Overpriced...,"Overall nice hotel, but definitely not worth the price... The rooms and especially bathrooms are quite small (I burned myself on the heating rack for towels!) with suboptimal lighting. We received a 'light continental breakfast' in the lounge which was extremely basic. In the conference rooms a good temperature was hard to manage and trying to open a window the blinds fell down as they were only attached with some velcro! Due to unexpected circumstances I had to check out 1 day earlier and informed the staff as soon as I found out in the early morning. They did not want to waive or discount the cancellation fee which I found very surprising considering we were there with a group of 15 people, staying already for a couple of days and using the conference rooms etc.

Overall I had expected much more, so feel rather disappointed and would not return or recommend this hotel.",2,2014,10,30
203,Perfect location,"Stayed in Westbury for 3 night in July. Had a great time. The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times. The room was good but we upgraded. The location is perfect for shopping and exploring the city. We didn't eat at the hotel, mainly as the room service menu is very small but with so many options around that are open into the night maybe there is not much call for a more extensive menu. If this place had a pool attached it would have been perfect. All in all a great stay and I would stay again.",4,2014,10,29
203,Amazing experience,"Stayed in Westbury  on Sunday night , the hotel and staff were amazing we  were made  feel so welcome and nothing was a problem . The hotel is spotless and food was excellent . Hurry and book your stay I can't wait to return . Michelle ",5,2014,10,28
203,Lovely!,"We stayed at the Westbury recently for one night before our tour and for two nights after.  We can't say enough about the hospitality of the staff, the beauty of the hotel and the central location.  When we returned after 11 days, Adam at the front desk remembered us and asked about our tour.  When our Nespresso machine didn't work (not sure it was the machine - more likely it was the operator!), housekeeping offered us complimentary coffee without being asked and even brought us two pots.  It's perfectly located for exploring Dublin, a great place to re-group after seeing all of Ireland and we highly recommend it.",5,2014,10,28
203,"Location, location, location","8 of us spent the weekend at the Westbury for our 25th wedding anniversary. The hotel is excellent and sitting in the lobby is very relaxing. The staff were efficient, polite and friendly. The location could hardly be better which obviously drives the price. Would I stay there again, no, I feel that other hotels not that far away represent far better value. Was very disappointed that for the price breakfast was not included. Don't get me wrong it's a great hotel, just very overpriced due obviously to it's locale, but next time I'll go somewhere else, may have to walk a little more but that's ok.",4,2014,10,28
203,Wonderful Weekend in Dublin,"We stayed at The Westbury from Friday 24th to Monday 27th October. It was our first visit to this splendid hotel and will definitely not be our last!!
Luxurious surroundings and super attentive staff!",5,2014,10,28
203,Conference facilities,Having run a conference in this hotel in April and October - I must say there was no comparison between the two experiences.  In April the Event Manager was not particularly interested in our needs and only for a young lady called Lisa who volunteered to look after us on the day we would have been left to our own devices.   Well the good news is that things were a lot different in October as we had Stephen who is the Event Manager Co-ordinator in the Westbury and he looked after our every need and no need was too petty.   Enjoyed working with Stephen and thanks Stephen for making the difference.   If I could make one criticism this time the air conditioning was not great it was either on fully and wherever the vents were the people sitting under them were freezing and when it was off the room was too warm - so it would be great if they could have a temperature gauge that would work properly attached to the Air Conditioning.   The room had also being refreshed with a nice new coat of paint which gave the overall feel of a newly decorated warm room.    Stephen thanks again you were superb and nothing was a problem for you.,5,2014,10,28
203,Wonderful place to stay,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.  Made to feel like I was the only person of any importance in the hotel, fantastic service, food lovely, rooms very nice, Location perfect,  never saw a member of staff not smiling, not cheap but excellent value for money.   Cannot wait to return",5,2014,10,28
203,"Great room, great area...","Was a great stay at the Westbury. Great location to pubs, shops & food. I was even able to find great coffee in the area. 
A few things though that you wouldn't expect from a 5 star. The service in the restaurant was not great - it was slow & the only word I can think of is 'meh'. The gym is woeful, & I had to pay 10 Euro to go across the rd. If you are not going to supply a decent gym at a 5 star, at least get the guests a free entry to the gym. The service from reception & the concierge was great though!",3,2014,10,28
203,Wonderful!,Beautiful hotel! We loved every minute of our stay here. Hotel lobby was incredibly luxurious and rooms were lovely and incredibly clean. Perfect location for exploring Dublin. Would really recommend. ,5,2014,10,27
203,Outstanding hotel in a perfect location,"Staff is first-rate, rooms are well appointed.  Location is ideal for seeing Dublin's attractions and getting around largely on foot if desired.  Overall, an excellent experience.  Definitely will return.",5,2014,10,27
203,Luxurious weekend getaway in heart of Dublin,"This was a weekend trip to get away from it all, see some live music and just relax. The Westbury staff contacted me in advance to see if there was anything we needed on arrival. Check-in was efficient and friendly, the room was clean and spacious. Breakfast choices were extensive, the staff there could not have been more helpful or eager to assist despite the restaurant being extra busy. 
This is not the cheapest hotel by any means, but not stupidly overpriced for the level of service provided - overall good value I think, and I would use the Westbury again if I am in Dublin.",5,2014,10,27
203,Enjoyable experience,"Just got back from our stay at the Westbury, what a stay, from the moment we approached the entrance to the moment we stepped inside the service was amazing.. The staff were so friendly, we went up to our room and promptly followed by one of the porters, Tommy  who showed and explained the room 
facilities to us, nothing was trouble. The room was spotless as was the whole hotel. The Bar staff were exceptional, I had a cold and one of the Bar staff offered to make me a Hot Toddy, I declined as I was enjoying the Blackcurrant Bellini's. We didn't eat at the hotel so I am unable to comment. I would recommend this Hotel it was clean, tidy and the staff warm and friendly.",5,2014,10,27
203,The Gallery,"Recently visited for Afternoon tea, Everything was superb from food to it is possibly one of the best in Dublin, The staffs provided excellent service and the lobby area is a peaceful haven. Will return soon.",5,2014,10,26
203,Best Hotel we have ever stayed in,"We are not, I suspect, the type of people who would normally use a five star hotel, but this was a very special time for my Wife and I.  For the first time in any hotel, the experience was 100% perfect from the second we arrived to checkout.  We couldn't fault a thing.  What made our visit extra special were firstly all the people who work at the Westbury, and secondly, all the little surprises - a nice fruit bowl for example, little petit fours at night and rose petals on the bed - we really did feel special, and we will remember this for a long time.

In conclusion, I would just say that I would rather save for longer and stay at the Westbury for a couple of nights than have some other breaks at lesser locations.  The Westbury is worth it.  I have given a five star rating for value not because our stay was not expensive, but because it really was worth every penny and more than what we paid.",5,2014,10,25
203,Got Engaged at the Wesbury - WOW!!,"A few weeks back I booked the Westbury as was planning to pop the question to my other half... needless to say a nerve jangling experience!

I wanted to book somewhere really nice and St.Stephens green is a special place for us so the Westbury was a natural choice. I had called earlier in the week to let them know what I was planning and that I was hoping it would be an extra special occassion. From this moment onwards I simply couldn't have expected the lenghts the team in Westbury went to to help me out. 

I received a call from the guest relations team on the morning of check in. All very discreet and professional. The guest relations manager was exceptional and offered advise on where to go in the area and things to do etc. They planned every detail meticulously. Upon checkin I was immediately advised that our room was not ready (it was of course ready but wasn't part of my plan!) so All of the team were advised to tow this line which they did diligently. 

Without wanting to bore on the fine detail, the hotel team had our room laid out fabulously when we arrived back from our ""walk"" -  champagne on ice, rose petals in the room and exceptional service from every last member of the team. 

Needless to say the room was stunning (you'd expect as much in the Westbury) but it did surpass our expectations. Every little detail was looked after and the guest relations manager (I can't speak highly enough of him) was exemplary and really helped ease my nerves early on and post her saying yes his team looked after everything in a really professional and discreet manner. At no point did we feel like we were being fussed over or intruded on but anytime we mentioned we'd got engaged we were congatulated by name by the entire team, this only served to make the weekend even more special. 

I had called a number of hotels to see what they could offer and explained the situation to them, some did acknowledge it and offered to ""make a note"" for the team, others outright ignored this information. The fact the westvury were so engaged was what made me pick there but i could never have expected the level of treatment we received. 

Something tells me the Westbury had become our new ""special occassion"" place from now on.If you need some where that will step up on a special occasion, book the westbury folks. 

Thank you so much to Joseph, Guest relations team and all the Staff in the Westbury. 

Cheers, 
Patrick",5,2014,10,23
203,"Excellent service, excellent location","Wonderful hotel in the heart of the city.  We walked everywhere we needed to go, only needed a taxi for to and from the airport (about ‚Ç¨25).  Lovely staff who were very attentive and polite, and seemed to be smiling at all times. They were very inviting and eager to help us find great places to dine with children. It's the little things sometimes...like the staff regularly offering complementary bottled water and checking in to make sure that we were very happy with our stay.  The rooms were decently sized and very comfortable. Housekeeping staff was lovely and made sure we had everything we needed. We stayed for 3 nights with our two children and felt comfortable.  It's within the city centre, but set back enough where the street noise doesn't bother you.  Also, wonderful for shopping as it's steps away from Grafton Street and the shopping district. Overall, great stay!",4,2014,10,23

203,Failte Ireland Fam Trip,I had the honour to be invited on the fam trip to Ireland with our first night at the Westbury Hotel In Dublin. The rooms were spacious and clean.

We will definitely be back.",5,2014,10,21
203,Great Hotel and Even Better Location,"The Hotel is in the center of the city and next to a major shopping street, Grafton Street. It is also close to St. Stephen's Green which is so beautiful talk walk around and see everything. I loved how the hotel is a surprise and when you walk in it is breathtaking. It is a true luxury hotel but I felt so comfortable there. I would stay here every time I am in Dublin.",5,2014,10,20
203,A wonderful week in Dublin,"My friend and I loved staying in this absolutely beautiful hotel.  Central to everything - shopping, after hours, pubs, theatres and much much more.

203,Such a classy hotel,"We stayed here with our kids last spring and the hotel was the highlight of the trip! The staff could not be friendlier. We took an overnight trip and could leave our luggage at the hotel free of charge. Aside from that, they were so nice to the kids, spoiling them with chocolate and other goodies. The location is perfect on Grafton street and the rooms are perfectly decorated with Irish charm! I would definitely go back!",5,2014,10,19
203,Great location,"A little touristy part of town.  Great tea lounge and breakfast.   Room is spacious.  small issues fixed quickly - blinds broke, missing intl plug adapters.   Wifi signal good.

203,Cannot wait to go back!,"Perfect hotel from start to finish. Nothing was too much trouble. Staff excellent. We stayed in a superior twin room. Lovely, clean room and beds are extremely comfortable although lighting in room could be improved as it was dimly lit. Room service was excellent. Food was delicious. Enjoyed the cocktails in the bar. The lobby area was beautiful and very relaxing. On a very stormy evening with strong winds and rain and on leaving our hotel to get into a taxi to attend a concert, staff made sure to use their umbrellas to keep us dry walking us from the hotel doors to our taxi. Lift was very slow though in arriving to our floor, so we had to take the stairs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back again.",5,2014,10,19

203,Luxury Stay,"What a beautiful hotel!  We had excellent service, from the front desk to the maid.  One day we were back in our room when the maid came by to clean.  We told her that we only needed towels and oh, the little chocolates that they left for turndown service.  She smiled and brought us a handful.  Sometimes, it's just the little things that make your stay enjoyable!  It was also great to be right on Grafton St.  We walked everywhere from the hotel.",5,2014,10,18

Great location, right off of Grafton Street and near St Stephens Green.  The hotel is kept up extremely well; super clean and fresh.  One of the best hotel experiences I have had.  Only ate at Wilde for breakfast; excellent continental breakfast. A la carte food was also superb.  Bafles Restaurant (next to/attached to hotel) for breakfast and dinner; also excellent. Highly recommend this hotel and the restaurants.",5,2014,10,18
203,A great hotel,"The Westbury is a very elegant hotel located right in the center of Dublin. It's got a competent friendly staff, the facilities are what you would expect from a 4 star hotel and the location couldn't be better if you are looking for pubs, restaurants, shopping and sightseeing destinations all within a few blocks.

From the moment you step in the doors and mount the double staircase to the reception area, this hotel takes you back in time to an elegant, first class experience.    The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff are wonderful.   The breakfast room is tucked away on the main floor and serves up a wonderful spread!!   You can order a la carte or be content with the full continental spread.    The bar area is hard to miss with the enormous chandeliers that reflect the many mirrors located throughout.    Truly a wonderful experience for tea in the afternoon or drinks in the evening.   It is located just off Grafton street so the world of shopping is right outside your hotel.    Definitely a great place to stay in Dublin!",5,2014,10,15
203,first class Service.,"Ive had lots of lunches and dinners in The Westbury and the consistency of service is always 100%

The lunch was delicious, staff so courteous, and they brought me out a gratis dessert which was a fantastic and unexpected touch. The waitress was fantastic and couldn't do enough even though it was extremely busy and booked full.",5,2014,10,15
203,Great Hotel,"We stayed here on 2 different stays inOctober. Both stays were excellent. The breakfast s were wonderful and the dinners at Balfe's was fantastic. The staff was superb. Paul at the front desk was especially. attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. The only criticism I have is that the bathroom is poorly lit. We had 2 different suites and the lighting was consistently poor. Ther was no mirror for my wife to blow her hair. The hotel supplied a small one when asked. Additionally, it seems that most hotels do not supply enough power outlets to charge your devices. A simple inexpensive power strip would work well. However I assume that the hotel will catch up eventually in the digital age.",5,2014,10,13
203,Fantastic,"Elegant setting, excellent staff and a great location!  Room was spacious and well appointed.  The bed was comfortable.  Everything was very clean.  Friendly turn down service.   Helpful concierge - thanks John!  The only possible thing they could improve, in my experience, was access to room service, which seemed to have very limited hours that were not convenient for business travel.",5,2014,10,13
203,Staff was unequaled,"Perfect location, beautiful room, but the staff is world class!  This hotel (once we found it - call for directions if you are driving - GPS and maps will not get you there) was perfectly centrally located to everything we wanted to see and do in Dublin.  Could not have asked for a better location.  Ashley at the concierge desk - my hero!  And the sweet young man David who checked us in..  so helpful.",5,2014,10,10
203,Lovely staff,"The staff at this hotel were exceptionally kind, warm and attentive. The room was proudly kept, with very comfortable beds.

The in-room dining is of high quality, and the cafe/bar area makes delicious scones with clotted cream and jam!

Beds were comfortable and we slept soundly.",4,2014,10,10
203,Great Pick in Center City,"This was one of the best hotels we stayed at on our 7-night tour of Ireland. The hotel was luxurious and everything we needed was either a phone call away, or in our room. The location is great; right off Grafton Street. Everyone at the hotel was extremely nice, helpful and cheery. They all wanted to know about the places we visited on our trip! On top of that, our rate for a queen bed was around $250, which is a value for such a top-notch hotel. I would highly recommend the Westbury!",5,2014,10,09
203,Beautiful Hotel,Stayed here for our wedding anniversary. Definitely a beautiful hotel in a wonderful location. Everything about this hotel is first class. Staff are welcoming and helpful. Room was beautiful. Cant wait to return. Highly recommended,5,2014,10,09
203,Only one step away from Pubs and Shops!,"This hotel offered me one of my best experiences in terms of business travel. The check-in was quick and my room was ready at 07.15 am, which was great for settling down before going to work and have a first cup of coffee in my room. Breakfast was included - amazing choice in the continental area, beautiful restaurant and great choice of different breakfast menues.

The room was spotlessly clean, very spacious with very nice (new) and comfortable furniture and there was a small lounge to sit down and relax. I had a twin bed room and a spacious shower cabin with bath tube and lots of space for my toiletry! Even a bathrobe and bathing shoes were provided! 

The service was awesome. In the late afternoon, room service is made again - providing complimentary water bottles and Butler's chocolates as a munchee before dinner! Very friendly and helpful staff - even when you're in your room and you do not wish that your room is done, you will receive a Butler's chocolates!

Location: perfect location, only 5 mins walk away from famous Temple Bar area, but also many pubs and restaurants are located in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. St. Stephen's Green Shopping centre and St. Stephen's Green park are only few steps away, as well as famous Grafton Street for your shopping experience in Dublin. Everything is close to this hotel and within walking distance.",5,2014,10,09
203,Great Hotel - Great Location,"We were with a tour group and that group chose this hotel.  It was truly a beautiful hotel, the food was excellent and it was centrally located so that we easily walked to many restaurants and places of interest.
      ",5,2014,10,08
203,The Westbury Hotel Dublin,"This was a business trip (conference) so mainly work, but the hotel was spotlessly clean, the staff were friendly and very informative about Dublin when needed (day off) the bedrooms/bathrooms were large, clean and very comfortable, the girls who cleaned or serviced the rooms were really friendly and never intruded on your personal time. A lovely central hotel in the heart of Dublin.   ",5,2014,10,06
203,Definitely staying here on my next trip to Dublin!!!,"Loved it!  The combo of charm, service, location, and price make this a winner!  We were on a long trip and stayed in Dublin twice: Four Seasons for 4 nights and The Westbury for 1 night.  Rooms here are a bit smaller than at the Four Seasons, but they were stylish and comfortable - perfect!  The staff were delightful and responsive.  The bar and restaurant are charming and beautiful. The location is FAB - right off of Grafton Street. And the price was great!",5,2014,10,01
203,"Balfes @ The Westbury for Sunday Brunch, a relaxed high quality experience, highly recommended","After watching an Iranian movie called Willow and Wind at the Irish Film Institute we wanted to have brunch at Cafe Novo at the Westbury Hotel in Dublin, Ireland, which we visited a few times over the years.

To our surprise the name had changed to Balfes. That wasn't the only thing that was different. It had been renovated and there were some menu changes too. For example there was no longer French Toast on the menu.

The renovation was a success in our opinion and looked good. It had now a nice contrast in black and white, dark chairs and comfortable leather sofas.

The atmosphere was good with a lot of families with young children, who were very well behaved.

The staff recognized us immediately, but they were very busy. They were attentive, though, and always there when we needed them.

We ordered during Sunday brunch four chai latte, two fresh orange juice, one Eggs Benedict, one Eggs Royal, blueberry pancakes with bacon and maple syrup and mixed berries with champagne sabayon. Everything was fresh and delicious.

We paid 55.50 Euro, ca. 71.90 USD.

No matter if it's called Cafe Novo or Balfes we are going to be regular guests in the future again and again.

Would we recommend this Bistro to a friend? YES!
Would we again visit this Bistro for lunch / brunch in the future? YES!",5,2014,10,01
203,5 star hotel doesn't quite get it,"Firstly, the room was amazing, huge and beautifully finished. 

However:
- there was no hot water in the morning (on my birthday) so I had a cold shower (the shower temperature control is broken but reception didn't seem to care)
- they didn't leave any water in the room and Dublin tap water is pretty grim; and
- for the second time running they didn't both to deliver the morning paper. Apparently this is because the conceirge has to go and get it in the morning from a nearby shop, which he doesn't bother to do until after 8am when I checked out.

I mentioned the above when I checked out and the remark from the reception was ""it's not quite good enough for a 5 star hotel is it"" (but nothing further offered)

I agree wholeheartedly, buck your ideas up Westbury.",3,2014,10,01
203,Superb,"Best hotel to stay at in Dublin...it ticks all the boxes..location service, size and comfort of room, friendliness and helpfulness of staff. We have stayed here seven times this year and it's always our first choice of places to stay. Would highly recommend this",5,2014,09,30
203,"Lovely hotel, great location","We were greeted by the manager and found all the staff to be friendly,  courteous and helpful. The rooms were lovely, and the Wilde restaurant was excellent, along with wonderful breakfasts. The central location made it easy to walk to sites like Trinity College. Great hotel value.",5,2014,09,29
203,Classy Hotel,"This was my second stay at the Westbury Hotel in the space of six months.  Each time has been an enjoyable and comfortable experience.

The Hotel is centrally located just of Grafton Street and is classically styled with lots of wood panelling.  This instantly creates a feeling of warmth.  The rooms are extremely comfortable from the beds to the seating area in the room and contain a personal coffee machine to make the experience that bit more enjoyable.  The only negative comment I have is with regard to the lighting arrangement which you need a PhD to operate with any certainty.  The bathroom was excellent with exceptional toiletries and continued the classic style.  

Breakfast was also excellent without being too expensive with the choice of various cooked breakfasts and/or a continental breakfast.  I recommend the full Irish breakfast particularly the white pudding.

This really is a lovely hotel and my hotel of choice when staying in Dublin.",5,2014,09,29
203,Could not be better,"Extremely friendly and helpful staff, faultless service, very good room service, comfortable and clean rooms. I hadn't heard of the hotel before my visit, but was hugely impressed by it, throughout, and will return when next in Dublin.
      ",5,2014,09,29
203,Great Hotel - great location - great service,"What can you say great location, service was awesome, room was great. It's pricey but you get what you pay for.  

Ordered room service and mentioned the iced tea was lemony so he brought us new ones even though we said all was good just different than used to. 

Loved the bathroom and bed was huge.",5,2014,09,28
203,In the Heart of Dublin.,"We stayed here one night before going to another hotel in the city and I wish we had stayed all 3 nights at this property -- our other 2 nights were at the Four Seasons.  Not that the Four Seasons wasn't lovely, but it was not in the heart of Dublin and we had to cab it everywhere from that property.  The Westbury is just steps away from Graffton Street shopping, wonderful restaurants and a great spot to take in the locals and get a real feel for the city.  The hotel is hip and chic at the same time.  Upon arrival you are greeted with warm towels that were sprayed with Eucalyptus and this was a nice welcome after 5 hours in the car.  Our room was wonderful and large and the beds were wonderfully comfortable.  The nice surprise in the room is that all the gasses are waterford -- a perfect touch for being in a luxury hotel in Ireland.",5,2014,09,28
203,Saturday night stay,Stayed here with a friend recently as we were attending a function in the city. From the minute I arrived the service in the hotel was remarkable. After alighting the car I made to walk up the steps with my overnight case and was immediately assisted by one of the hotel staff. I explained I wanted to leave my bag with reception as I was going to meet some friends before checking in and the doorman said he would look after it for me so I didn't have to queue at reception. On arrival back at the hotel to check in the room wasn't quite ready so myself and my friend were treated to a glass of cava in the bar while we waited. The room was small but well appointed with very comfortable beds and a nespresso machine in the room. On checking out we stayed for a cup of coffee in the gallery. All the staff were a pleasure to deal with and the decor was beautiful. Definitely a 5 star experience.,5,2014,09,26
203,Heart of Dublin,The Westbury is a excellent place to stay to explore Dublin. The rooms are large and comfortable. The staff is extremely nice and helpful. Great breakfast and nice lounge areas. Perfect location for walking around the heart of the city and a great comfortable place to come back to after a long day sightseeing. Will definitely stay here any time we are in Dublin!,5,2014,09,26
203,Great location and service. Excellent Dublin hotel.,"Like others have noted, the Westbury is just about perfectly located. This is a key issue in choosing this hotel. It is just off of a side street from Grafton Street (literally less than 100 yards from Grafton St). Very easy to walk to shops, restaurants, pubs, and tourist attractions. Grafton Street is a 2 minute walk. Trinity College is maybe 5 minutes away. Another 5 minutes from there to Temple Bar area. Also convenient to a pick up/drop off location for the ""hop on, hop off"" city tour. This was our first time in Dublin and the staff at the Westbury were all top notch. Professional yet friendly and helpful. 
It has an older and stately appearance from the outside yet is modern and upscale inside. Check in was efficient. Our room was nice (even large by European standards) and had a very nice well lit bathroom. Food was excellent (we only had a breakfast there, not a dinner). FYI, Bewleys right around the corner from the Westbury has an excellent breakfast and a nice coffee and expresso bar. At the Westbury, a very extensive wine selection at the bar. I found a French blend that was really nice. Just what you'd expect from a high end, centrally located, big city hotel. Very clean, staff excellent (concierge got us a table at a great restaurant on a busy Saturday night) and all an excellent stay.
The only things I would nit-pick...
No wall sockets in the bathroom (so you have to go to front room to blow dry or use curling iron, etc). 
A/C system not easy to figure out. We eventually did, but maybe an instruction card would be helpful
They were doing work on the floor below us and there was banging/drilling going on at times during the day (one day pretty early). We mentioned this at check out and ""poof"" we got a free breakfast.",5,2014,09,25
203,A warm welcome from the best hotel in Ireland,"I had the great pleasure of staying here on the final night of my trip to Ireland, which was the only highlight of our trip. We were greeting by the doorman how came to our aid with umbrellas, and our bags were swiftly taken away and we guided up the a grand staircase to the Reception. Kimberly who checked us in gave us a very warm welcome and she is very passionate about the hotel and Dublin. The room was superb, with a very large four poster bed, lovely pillows and sheets, very clean and very well appointed. We had lovely welcome Whickey Chocolates - a realy nice touch. The lobby bar was fantastic and has a great ambiance in the evening with live music. The best meal we had in Ireland was the breakfast the next morning, there is an extensive breakfast buffet for the cold items and a menu for all the hot items which is served at the table - which is very luxurious compared to the standard hotel buffet.  We were greeted in the lobby by Aidan after breakfast and he gave us suggestions on what to see and do in the short time we had until we had to go to the airport. I wish more hotels would learn from the Westbury, this is a hotel that are doing it right, we were welcomed and cared for by everyone which is a sign of great management. We will defiantly be back, and I am looking forward to returning to the Westbury in Dublin",5,2014,09,25
203,A perfect stay,"Our stay at the Westbury was a lovely way to end our trip to Ireland. The ambiance, ammenities and location can not be surpassed. The staff was gracious and welcoming at all times. We highly recommend the Westbury.",5,2014,09,24
203,Excellent hotel stay and visit,From the moment we walked in to the moment we departed we were always greeted with a smile and a hello.  Assistance was always offered regarding any tourist attraction or location we wanted to know about.  Great location!!!!  The room was lovely and the bed super comfortable.  Will definitely be back for another visit!!!,5,2014,09,22
203,"Nice hotel, perfect location","Conrad Hilton is often quoted as saying that the three most important things about a hotel were location, location and location. On that score The Westbury could not be better - it is perfectly located on a quiet side street just off Grafton Street and within walking distance of pretty much every major attraction in Dublin. The hotel is very nice too; our room was large and tastefully furnished, with free wifi and a spacious bathroom. The breakfast buffet at the Wilde restaurant was adequate though not overly generous; there are more choices available a la carte. There is also a small but pleasant gym. Staff was very friendly and generally helpful (although upon our arrival - with quite a bit of luggage - the bellboy seemed more keen on sharing restaurant tips with other guests than on assisting us - I had to walk up a flight of stairs to find someone more interested; but that was a one-off).

Our only major complaint was about the lack of closet space in the room - are people expected to bring just a single change of clothes? We wound up literally living out of our suitcases that we placed on the floor - there would have been plenty of room for additional cabinets or closets; the only available cabinet was ridiculously small and also meant to house an ironing board (which we took out immediately so as to be able to hang at least a couple of suits and dresses). Poor planning!",4,2014,09,22
203,Perfectly located hotel,"We stayed 4 nights in a studio suite with a four poster bed. The room was spacious, with a sitting area and large closet area and separate elevated area for the bathroom. Everything was perfect, the hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to everything you need.
We stayed with a baby, so they had a Westbury teddy bear in his cot which was sweet.
Food was very good, both in the restaurants at the hotel as well as room service. We also had the afternoon tea, which was a great experience!
Service throughout the hotel was amazing. We would definitely return.",5,2014,09,22
203,Dublin stay.,I was a young student when I last visited Dublin. Now I'm 41 and my friends decided to send me back to see if I can remember any thing. I can and this hotel helps a lot. Great location for a turist and the most helpful front desk I've seen ever. The knew what I needed before I asked and always helped with the info needed an a big smile.,5,2014,09,22
203,Central Location,"This was a nice hotel. It was large and posh and the staff at the front desk was very helpful. They upgraded our room for us to a king because of our honeymoon, but the only complaint with the room was that it had a handicapped shower. It made it difficult to use the shower because it was on flat ground, the same level as the rest of the bathroom floor. The drain really couldn't keep up and it basically flooded the bathroom each time we used the shower, so we had to make little towel dams to keep the water from going onto the carpet. Kind of a pain... The shower was also the type that has the track in the ceiling, so there was NO place to hang any towels. It was hard to store/hang anything in there. The shower itself lacked places to put shampoo and soap, minus one small little soap dish. Not really convenient. Or romantic for showering together... cramped and annoying. Other than that, the room was really nice. It had big comfy velvet chairs, leather benches and chairs with a nice little breakfast table. They had a fridge, this was the only hotel we encountered with a fridge, but the mini bar took up the entire thing so we couldn't even use it. Also, the mini bar was RIDICULOUSLY expensive. Almost sickeningly so. But we got a bottle of complimentary water to split between the two of us....so that was ""nice."" On another note, they had an in-room Nespresso with coffee pods, electric teakettle, cups, saucers, sugars and milk. That was really nice and convenient and the coffee was excellent. We have one at home so it was especially comforting. The robes are very comfortable as well. They had different outlets so you could plug a regular standard U.S. plug in without an adapter. That was really convenient. Also had a nice hairdryer. The TV channels were better than the others at the hotels we had previously  been to and they left nice chocolates in the rooms for us that were very good. A few complaints I did have were we could not find the hotel. It is almost impossible to drive yourself there. I would highly suggest trying to take a taxi. We rented a car upon our arrival in Ireland and were instructed to bring it to the hotel and it would be picked up there. We just had to park and walk to the hotel because we couldn't figure out how to navigate the streets. The concierge had to draw us a map and somehow we found our way there and were very glad to be rid of the car. It was not worth trying to drive it through Dublin, especially when it was all under construction like it was for us. The breakfast they had was just alright, nothing special. They always had to have us sit in the waiting area because they didn't have enough tables. It was odd. The biggest complaint I have is how difficult it was for them to change out our towels. I understand that it's standard to have them changed once daily, but with our shower situation (no way to hang the towels, having to use extra to keep the water from going everywhere) we needed extra. We were also walking a lot and showered usually twice a day. We would hang the sign on the door for our room to be serviced and they would just flip it around... I had to go to the front desk for towels after several attempts at asking the room service ladies to bring us extra. However, the location is perfect. You can walk all over the place. It's a great hotel other than a few of those minor issues. Wish it had a pool, though. Also, I think the walls are paper thin because we literally could hear everytime our wall-neighbors sneezed. Maybe they just sneezed loudly, but it made it annoying when we were trying to sleep and we kept getting awoken by hallway noises.",4,2014,09,21
203,"Great Location, Excellent Service, Nice Rooms","I stayed at the Westbury for five nights. Upon walking into the room I was pleasantly surprised. My room was large and well appointed. Nice bathroom with everything you need - even a make-up mirror! The room was quiet at night and the bed was very comfortable. The staff could not have been more helpful. Rather than check the box for room service within a half hour, I requested a specific time and my breakfast arrived at the time requested. The staff is focused on excellent customer service and the concierge was fantastic. They will do everything to make your stay enjoyable. 

I travel a lot for business and stay in many hotels around the world. The Westbury ranks with the best. I will definitely stay here again. ",5,2014,09,21
203,Nice Hotel Great location -WIFI needs help,"We stayed at the Westbury right in the heart of all of the action. The staff was very friendly and helpful through all of the week long stay. The rooms and the entire hotel are well kept and comfortable. The only issue we had was the use of WIFI in the rooms. If you are in the lobby no problems, if you are in the rooms, good luck. I would still recommend this hotel if location is important to your trip.",4,2014,09,19
203,The Westbury Experience,A wonderful experience from arrival to departure.  Excellent professional friendly staff who deal quietly and efficiently with every request.  Always a smile!  This hotel has one of the best locations too.,5,2014,09,18
203,Watch out for the continental breakfast,"The hotel room and staff were excellent and the location is perfect for seeing areas near Temple Bar, Trinity College and St. Stephens Green.  However, coffee, toast and a bowl of pooridge turned out to be a very expensive breakfast (21 euros).   That ordering a bowl of pooridge off the menu would cost 6 euro was clear, but the surprise came when the check arrived and we leared that by accepting an offer of coffee and toast as we were seated we had ordered the 15 euro continental breakfast too.  I can't even say whether the continental breakfast is worth 15 euro because by then we needed to leave to make our flight  and did not have time to see what is included in a continental breakfast.",3,2014,09,17
203,Beautiful hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon and the hotel was really nice and the staff was exceptional and attentive! The room didn't feel small, and on the first night of our stay they surprised us with a dessert plate that said ""Congratulations!"" In chocolate and a bottle of wine!  We did have the hot Irish breakfast with the continental breakfast and that was really tasty but keep in mind it's a bit pricey. There were other reviews that talked about bar noises from the street and to avoid a room by the elevators, we had room 346, which faces the street with the bars and was next to the elevators. Not sure if it was because we were so exhausted each night, but we had no issues with noise from the bars or elevator! Only tip I have is the bathtub/shower on has half a wall so the floor of the bathroom gets pretty wet and slippery! All in all we had a great stay at this hotel!!",5,2014,09,15
203,Staff friendly/Room Just Okay,"Someone had referred this to us as one of the best hotels in Dublin.  Reading some of the positive reviews and comparing to our experience, I am a bit surprised.  We stayed there in early September 2014 for 7 nights.  First off the hotel is hard to find.  It is located off of Grafton Street, but if you follow the GPS, it leads you right to the back of the hotel.  It is confusing until you figure out that you need to make a left at the end of the street and the another left and you will be directed to the front of the hotel.  After 7 hours on a plane, and trying to cope with driving on the opposite side of the road, it was not as easily obtained as one would have liked.  The most positive part of the stay was the staff.  They were very friendly and helpful, especially the concierge desk.  Both Ashley and Lukaz were wonderful with recommendations and helping out with any questions we had.  Most of the wait staff were friendly, except a few we had who either were absent for periods of time or seemed irritated.  The continental breakfast was very good.  They had an excellent selection.  The rest of the food I would only give it 3 stars as it was edible, but really nothing beyond just okay.  Our room was a decent size.  The bed was like a trampoline.  It is probably the worst bed we have ever slept on.  If you moved just an inch, you threw your partner all over the place.  The pillows were not very soft and the non feather pillows were literally like rocks.  The bathroom was annoying.  I hate the stupid tiny trash can you have to press your foot to open and it barely opens and you can barely put anything in it.  Why?  The sink's knobs turned forever before water came out and when it did it sprayed all over the place.  The toilet took forever to refill so you could flush again.  The toilet paper was like sandpaper on your rear end. The shower had a half glass wall over a tub.  My husband who is 6 feet tall found it cramped and not high enough for him.  Plus, water splashed everywhere when you showered. The hotel seemed a bit disorganized.  When we arrived they had the wrong information on us.  They gave us a key that opened the wrong room.  They charged us incorrectly for parking; literally three times the amount.  But they were nice about correctly everything.  The hotel lobby is pretty.  The noise level in the lobby and restaurant is pretty high. The room staff keep a clean room for you.  There is a coffee maker in the room which is convenient.  The location of the hotel is perfect off of Grafton Street.  Easy access to a lot of the attractions and some great shopping.  If this is the best Dublin has to offer, I'm a bit let down.",3,2014,09,15
203,Perfect !,"Quite simply the yard stick that all hotels should try and emulate! We stayed in this hotel when we got married in Dublin. We received an upgrade out of the blue when the staff realizes what the occasion was. The rooms are fantastic. The food is excellent. But the best part is the staff. The word professional wouldn‚Äôt come close! The hotel is in a perfect location in the nicest part of Dublin. With shopping, bars and restaurants on your doorstep. I will 100% be returning to this amazing hotel",5,2014,09,14
203,A Beautiful experience in the heart of Dublin,This was a first trip to Ireland and I selected this hotel due to positive reviews on trip advisor and the location. My daughter and I could not have been more pleased with every aspect of The Westbury. The rooms are very spacious and clean.  Everyone from the restaurant staff to housekeeping were extremely friendly and helpful. The level of professionalism displayed by all members of the Westbury staff certainly make this hotel experience one to remember. I have and will continue to recommend this hotel for those going to Dublin.,5,2014,09,12
203,"Wonderful hotel, great rooms & staff.","My wife & I were guests of this hotel in September 2014 for 4 nights.  I could not have been happier with this hotel, their staff were wonderful, helpful & friendly.   I'd have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.  It is located in a perfectly central city location, close to great shopping, parks, pubs & restaurants.  I cannot wait to come back!  John.  St Kilda Melbourne",5,2014,09,11
203,Happy I chose the Westbury over the Merrion,"Sooooo, we were using Trip Advisor to choose between the top two hotels in Dublin and the decision was between the Westbury and The Merrion. 

WOW - am I happy I opted for the Westbury. It was central. Like REALLY central and we had a blast walking all over the place. Plus you're right in the center of Grafton so you really can't beat it for awesome food options like Carluccios and Little A$$ Burrito.

Turns out the Merrion is waaaay out there (over a km walk from major attractions) and we found out when we went to visit for lunch. You can check out that review here: yelp.com/biz/the-cellar-‚Ä¶

We had a great suite overlooking Grafton and they helped to make it special with a fruit basket, bubbly and tasty desert on our first evening's arrival. Definitely opt for the studio suite or above - the added room was excellent. Though do watch your step hopping out of the shower! (It's quite high up.) 

The only downside of the Westbury was Wilde The Restaurant. While we never tried it for dinner (just far too many incredible options in the Grafton area) Wilde for breakfast was quite underwhelming for breakfast. The Irish breakfast my husband order clearly sat under the heat lamps in the kitchen for far too long. And, getting a side of toast seemed to be a Herculean task. The lady managing the place could use a good happy pill too. Her attitude was....lacking positively, let's say. 

Added bonus to the Westbury: talk with the bell hops and door men. At first they seem the epitome of professionalism (and they are),  but spend a few moments chatting and they will give you both the local and insider tips for exploring Dublin.",4,2014,09,10
203,Excellent hotel,"We stayed here for 4 nights in September and had a wonderful time.  Excellent hotel, staff who couldn't do enough for you.  Good facilities, spotless, spacious, quiet and very well located within walking distance of shops, attractions.  Would definitely go back.",5,2014,09,10
203,Top Notch,"We stay often at luxury hotels and the Westbury in Dublin is one of the finest we've stayed. The building is not particularly charming nor is the decor, but it was super comfortable AND the service was impeccable. Five stars for great service, friendly, accomodating, ready to help with a smile and no attitude - at all.

Also, the location is great, nearby walking to everything, even the Guinness brewery was a one mile hike(go to the Gravity bar at the top for the view).

We stayed in a Deluxe King with poster bed, it was on the top floor with a decent view and the room had a very comfy bed and two sitting chiars to relax, plus the bath room was very clean and shower modern. The only nit is we would've preferred a little table to put our toiletries as there is room in front of the standup mirrors.

Top notch, would definitely stay again.",5,2014,09,10
203,Excellence with unobtrusive high Quality Service,"The Westbury gives you everything a 5* Hotel should, Welcome with hot towels at Reception was just what we needed after a day of travel to get there.  Room excellently appointed with lots of lovely touches especially the turn-down service with chocolates, water and classical music in the background. Only problem in our room was the noise of air-conditioning outside (we faced the rear of the hotel)
We were so happy with our stay that we have already booked to come back again in November",5,2014,09,10
203,A Elegant and Convenient Hotel,"The Westbury Hotel is located one-half block off Grafton Street in Dublin's busiest district. You are in the very best location and a very elegant hotel. Our room and bathroom was spacious and the staff was so very helpful in locating taxis, maps, train schedules, and places to visit. We stayed in late August and highly recommend this lovely hotel.",5,2014,09,09
203,Great hotel in the middle of the city center,"I loved my stay in the Westbury. Great location, great 5-star service and although the room was small, it had everything I needed for my business trip. Definitely recommend this hotel for both business and leisure travelers!",5,2014,09,09
203,Best location,"We were in London for the first time and a friend recommended the Westbury.  After touring the city, this is the best location and the ammenities and staff were fantastic.  The only thing missing is a decent fitness center and spa but we were only there for 3 days.  They do have a  very smll ""fitness center""   The hotel is fantastic and the room that we had was great.",5,2014,09,09
203,Classy Hotel,"5 Star hotel, perfect location.  The service is as you would expect and are paying for.  Cant say anyone knew my name by the end of our 2 night stay but I would imagine if I returned once or twice more that would be the case.  Travelled with my 3 year old daughter who was delighted with the colouring pencils and activity book she got - this was a lovely touch.  Breakfast was just delightful - pancakes made fresh and everything else under the sun!!! Rooms were nice. I didn't have a view of anything only the back of some buildings but I expect you could pay for a better view.  In terms of charm and character you couldn't get better!!! The Christmas decorations were up. I was in heaven and my little girl was on cloud 9!",5,2014,09,08
203,Location cannot be bettered but rooms are disappointing,"My mother and I stayed at the Westbury over a long weekend in August and despite my excitement (having seen the excellent reviews when we booked), I was disappointed by our stay.

The hotel is tucked away just off Grafton Street so for a central hotel that's right in the heart of the city it can't be bettered. We had a great check in experience; a very nice lady sorted our details, we had hot towels to wipe away the airport and with the beautiful lobby it was all feeling good. We'd arrived early so our room wasn't ready which was no problem at all, we left our bags with the concierge Tommy, who was a delight and showed us various places on the map for a bite to eat, to catch the tourist bus etc. 

When we got back later in the day and checked into our room, we found it was fairly small and actually pretty basic for a five star hotel. Yes the toiletries are nice but there's no ipod dock, no (free) snacks (most places these days have a biccie at least) and our tea selection had only camomile and green tea. The cable for the kettle only just reached the plug which meant having it perched precariously on the edge of the shelf to make a drink - a disaster waiting to happen there.

We stayed in room 625 and I wouldn't recommend it. It's right next to a housekeeping cupboard with it's own service lift so we were woken each day by a god awful clanking and banging from the lift and the door banging as the maids went in and out. We never received our newspapers and my bed was broken so I slept in a hole. We asked at reception about the papers and were promised them the next day but still nothing. As we'd spent so long unpacking, and couldn't be bothered to repack, we didn't ask to change rooms and to be fair, I'm sure the hotel would have made amends there so I can't whinge too much about that one! I'd check though when you arrive if your room is next to the service lift or housekeeping cupboard as I presume it's the same problem on all floors.

Other aspects; the wifi was free and reliable, there's a taxi rank right outside the door so you can't fail to get a cab when you need one and the staff are very nice. There are loads of cafes round about for breakfast and plenty of restaurants too. The Gaiety Theatre is less than 5 minutes away and you're surrounded by shops.

I would probably stay here again as the location is just superb but if you're expecting real 5 star class - for me the Westbury doesn't quite have it.",3,2014,09,08
203,disappointing.  will not book again.,"When we arrived we were really excited by the beautiful lobby, central location and helpful concierge service.  However, our room was disappointing.  It was noisy and the toilet did not work.  We would not stay here again.  I would look at The Merrion or the Schoolhouse Hotel as other options.",3,2014,09,06
203,Classy hotel off Grafton St,"This is a first class hotel with excellent service, spacious and well equipped rooms, and a very attentive staff. There are two nice pubs practically right outside the front door and the pedestrian- only Grafton St has many shops, restaurants and pubs. A moderate walk will get you to the Temple Bar area if you want additional shopping and nightlife. The Westbury is a great hotel from which to stage a visit to the fun and exciting city of Dublin.",5,2014,09,03
203,First class,"The highest quality facilities and services were delivered on everything. Situated very conveniently for walking to the main city centre activities, shopping and restaurant areas just outside the hotel. Highly recommended. The only difficulty was trying to get to the hotel entrance in a large car due to the complicated Dublin one-way system and the very narrow streets which confused the car Sat Nav system--but once arrived using a street map the valet parking service took away any further hassle on arrival.",5,2014,09,01
203,Oh dear,"I raved about this place in a previous review, but feel compelled to write an update following a number of subsequent visits, which have now probably exhausted my patience with the Westbury.  Most of the rooms, on a standard rate, are actually very small (think Manhattan small), and two of the past three visits have had bathrooms which require some contortion to close the door and reach the bath.  The 'inclusive' breakfasts have been downgraded to eliminate any real choice and the service in the lobby bar at breakfast is unnecessarily formal given that it's basically tea and toast.  The staff in the rest of the hotel are excellent, but it doesn't overcome some significant shortcomings.  The gym is appalling for a 5* hotel and there is a supplementary charge to use a neighbouring one.  Without fail, there is an error in my bill or in keeping track of my loyalty program details and they are never resolved quickly.  The final straw was the very poor state of the sheets on my last stay which had large tears in the edges; exposed when I had to do my own turn-down....",2,2014,08,31
203,Great Dublin Hotel,"Our stay at the Westbury was excellent.It is conveniently located with great walking access to restaurants, Temple Bar area,and siteseeing.Concierge staff was great.The only issue was one slightly rude bartender, everyone else was extremely pleasant and helpful.",5,2014,08,30
203,WOW ! Great Stay Great Location,"From check in to check out everything was perfect. our room looked over the front of the hotel, the service was great. rooms were on the smaller size but very well maintained, location location location. we walked out of the hotel and was in the middle of all the amazing things Dublin had to offer. we really enjoyed our stay.",5,2014,08,30
203,The best location,"Decided to stay at Westbury based on the good reviews in tripadvisor. The hotel had exceeded our expectation, helpful staffs, cozy and spacious room and there is an espresso maker in the room! The hotel has the best of location, right in the middle of Grafton Street. Highly recommended!
      ",5,2014,08,29
203,The best of Dublin,"We stayed 2 nights at the Dublin Westbury. The staff at the hotel is friendly, professional and make you feel very welcome and special. The room we had was very nice and clean. The front desk staff is 5 star. We will stay at this hotel when we return to Dublin. Walking distance to many Dublin attractions and parks. This is a 5 star facility and when you stay there you understand why they are so rated.",5,2014,08,28
203,Excellent - Touch of Complacency,"We spent 2 nights at the Westbury and it is truly is an outstanding hotel in every sense. The staff are an absolute credit to the hotel, their level of service is excellent, they make the difference between an ordinary hotel and a 5 star hotel.

Our room was comfortable although tight and the mattress needs replacing and the bathroom door needs adjustment, we were on the 2nd floor and had a wonderful view of adjoining buildings roofs (note my sarcasm) so, clearly you should request a higher floor with a view of the City.  

Now having arrived in Ireland after staying at the Shangri-La Paris, nothing and I mean nothing was ever going to compare with the fabulous Shangri-La but, Westbury was what we needed after a hectic time in Paris, a 'rest' and that was achieved. 

One of the problems I've come to realize when you use someone like Qantas for hotel bookings, irrespective of the fact you're paying top dollar, the hotel sticks you in one of their worst rooms, so it's imperative you question the reception on checking it on the type, location and be prepared to upgrade if necessary. 

We normally do, however, the receptionist in this case assured us it was a good room with a view??? That wasn't the case and I was too exhausted to raise the matter after actually accessing our room.

The quality of the food was good even tho the main restaurant was closed for renovations, the only problem with serving food in the lounge is the tables are to 
low to manage a main meal, ok for finger food but, certainly not adequate to eat a main meal.

Other than a couple of negatives, we would recommend the Westbury.",4,2014,08,27
203,Superb...great experience!,"My wife and I spent three days at The Westbury in early July as the first stop in our Ireland and UK vacation.  From the moment we arrived, we knew it would be special experience as the welcoming staff and beautiful rooms were beyond our expectations.  We were placed in a studio suite that did not have much of a view, but was a large and well-appointed room.  

The concierge pointed us to excellent meals throughout or stay, and our only complaint is that we were unable to stay longer to fully explore his list of restaurants.  As far as hotel must-dos, we would highly recommend the Westbury's Afternoon Tea; it was superb in presentation, taste, and sophistication.  

If we were to ever visit Dublin again, we would undoubtedly stay again at The Westbury.",5,2014,08,26
203,Can't wait to return,"We loved our stay here from check-in, to check out. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are gorgeous and the staff go above and beyond. We felt so pampered from the moment we arrived to the moment we reluctantly left. Location is brilliant, I cannot recommend The Westbury highly enough!",5,2014,08,26
203,Excellent Hotel in every way,"The location is excellent, the service is excellent, the food is excellent and  various dining options are available. The standard of hotel cleanliness is excellent and all of the staff are very helpful and friendly.",5,2014,08,26
203,failed expectations,"We visit Dublin at least three times a year and this is the first time we have stayed at the Westbury and not our usual Brooks hotel, and what a mistake we made.
Check in was pleasent with the hot towels and that which really sets the tone that we will be really well looked after, but everything ended their.

I used the loos soon after check in and the Gents was very smelly, not good.

Our rooms were disappointing, not what you would expect from a five star, more like a dated 
four star, very underwhelming.

1, Our tv was about an inch uneven on one side on the wall which gave us the impression that they didnt care.
2. Our wall sockets were coming of the wall.
3. the handels of the drawers came off in our hands.
4. their was not nearly enough coffee supply with the espresso machine.
5. We had one shower gel portion for two people, not nearly enough, ordered more in the evening before dinner, woke the next day and had to re order at 8am...not happy.
6. dressing gowns were like sand paper, a little softner used may help.
7. no comment cards available in rooms.
8. did expect a five star to have a walk in shower, and the shower head was not ajustable, quite frustrating.
9. back entrance to hotel was beside bin area and delivery port which had a very bad smell and was littered with over flowing refuse sacks, not really what the customer a future customers want to see.
10. i thought the express check out option was very impersonal, most businesses are hungry for feedback, not this one.

Basically if you are thinking of splashing out a premium on the hotel i would think very carefully and price around some very good four stars for a considerable bit less with much better facilities and attention to detail........i will be going back to my usual in future.",2,2014,08,25
203,Wonderful Westbury,"Fabulous hotel in the centre of Dublin, gorgeous decor and superb facilities. Welcoming staff in a luxurious hotel, definitely worthy of its 5 star status. Had an amazing time in Dublin made even better by staying in this beautiful hotel.",5,2014,08,25
203,"Marvelous, but not #1","The Westbury was every bit a 5 star hotel in many aspects, but disappointing in others.  First the amazing:  Hot hand towel presented to you at the reception desk while checking-in (refreshing!) extremely courteous staff, gorgeous public rooms and lovely afternoon full tea, can't-beat-location just off of Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green, a block from the Gaiety Theatre where Riverdance performs, a couple of blocks to Trinity College, and an easy 15 minute walk to the Temple Bar area.  The rooms were less attractive than the Merrion and a bit scuffed around the edges.  I opted for a more expensive front-facing view room, and the A/C was broken!  The manager told me maintenance had gone home for the evening, but provided a fan.  I awoke with a stuffy nose, I assume from the drafty fan, but headed out for my day, having been assured the night before the A/C would be fixed that day.  It was not.  And no front-facing rooms remained.  However, true to a 5 star hotel, the manager came up and escorted me to a back-facing room (view of St. Patrick's) and offered it to me for the next three nights of my stay.  It was a $675/day suite with a separate living room with flatscreen TV, king bedroom with flatscreen TV, and a queen's bathroom complete with a claw-foot tub from which to watch a bathroom TV.  So that quite made up for the inconvenience!  Typically room service was prompt, though a few times waiting for an ice bucket (you have to have ice delivered, as there are no ice machines) ended up being 20-30 minutes.  WARNING ABOUT IRELAND BATHROOMS (ladies, especially) -- There are no blow dryer, curling iron, or steam roller outlets by the sinks or mirrors in bathrooms!  Even in 5 star hotels!  There are only small outlets that will take electric shavers for men!  How infuriating and impossible is that?!  If you are lucky, you will find an outlet by a mirror perhaps over a desk, but my suite didn't have a mirror over the desk, it had the flat screen TV!  And I'm speaking of regular outlets into which you can plug an adapter for those devices above.  It was a feat trying to style hair with no mirror.  The staff told me ""it is dangerous to have outlets by water, so they are prohibited in Ireland.""  Ireland, I love you, but come on, step into the 21st century!",4,2014,08,25
203,Afternoon Tea,"We were recently celebrating a special anniversary, so on a whim decided to pay a visit to the Westbury Hotel (just off Grafton Street in Dublin).  We waited a few minutes and a lovely waiter (Valentin)came over to us and asked would we be joining them for food or just drinks.  We said we were only going to have a drink so we were seated and told our order would be taken shortly.  We noticed most people around us were having Afternoon Tea so we asked for that menu.  We opted for the Champagne Afternoon Tea. Our table setting was changed around and our champagne was brought out.  This was soon followed by our tea and sandwich selection, which was then followed by a delicious selection of pastries and warm scones,complete with clotted cream and jams . At ‚Ç¨48 per person it is slightly expensive but for a special occasion it's worth it.  At no time were we rushed, the waiter checked on us every so often to ensure we were happy with everything.  We could not eat all the cakes, so they were carefully boxed and given to us to take home, along with two lovely boxes of Butler's Chocolates.  Would definitely recommend this for anyone looking to do something different for that ""special"" anniversary or birthday etc.",5,2014,08,25
203,Great 24 hours,"Lovely Saturday into Sunday at the Westbury as always.
Room not ready when we got there but did get a promised call at 3pm the tail end of a lovely lunch where nothing was a problem!
Room good and quiet as requested
Beautiful strawberry daquari as a round up after dinner
Breakfast a good balance between self service and waiter service.
Always lovely to arrive and always sad to leave. Will be back",5,2014,08,25
203,Central and very welcoming,"Westbury hotel

When Choosing a short stay hotel in Dublin it had two meet certain criteria , location had to Central and  had to be large enough to cater for our needs in dining and relaxing.
The Westbury seemed to be able to offer both.
The location is aboutt he best you could wish for , it's off the main shopping street in Dublin , easy strolling distance to the main area of bars ( temple bars) and very central.
This was important to us as we only had a couple of days on a break with myself and wife , the kids were being spoiled by there aunt so we wanted to make the most of our  ""free time"" in Dublin.

The hotel appears to be fairly small from the entrance but opens up once your get to reception one floor up, theres a large area adjacent to the reception where afternoon tea seemed to be popular, 

The rooms were not overly large nor overly small, and provided everything you need, and would expect from a hotel of this rating.

We ate in the resturant ""Wildes"" and found it fairly good, probably a little traditional for our taste but that's  very much personal choice. The food was cooked well and we enjoyed our meal. 
We used the main bar and enjoyed the skills of a very experienced cocktail bar man.
In general the staff were really pleasant , I felt as though they genuinely wanted you to enjoy the hotel and that it mattered to them. 
 
In summary we pretty much loved our stay, the location meant that we felt as though we were in the hub, the levels of service were excellent , the hotel represented good value. 
",4,2014,08,24
203,Definitely a 5 star experience,"Loved staying in the westbury.  No taxis needed, everything you might want to do is within walking distance.  Spent a lot of time in the cafe novo, sitting outside drinking wine, eating, drinking cappuccino and chatting to other residents, watching the world go by.  Fairly expensive but you get what you pay for. We were there as a couple, but family and friends based in Dublin, so they joined us many times in cafe novo",5,2014,08,23
203,"Location, location, location","Cannot fault this hotel, that made us feel so welcome from the second we approached its doors. Service is impeccable, rooms are just right & well, I do not think it can be beaten for location. Literally seconds stroll from one of the main shopping streets in Dublin. Pubs, restaurants, theaters, shops, museums, everything is within walking distance. This just made what was such a special trip home all the more so.",5,2014,08,23
203,Outstanding,"3 nights of sheer bliss. What a great hotel in a great location in a great city. It's a little expensive but you get what you pay for. The staff at the Westbury are an absolute credit to the hotel, without them it would be an average 4 star. They give it the 5th star. Rooms are well presented with an extremely comfortable bed. The turn-down service in the evening is a lovely touch. Everything is clean and spotless. The bathroom, although a little small has everything you need. We were on the fifth floor and the views across the city were fantastic. We had an amazing four days in a wonderful city. This hotel was the icing on the cake. Thank you.",5,2014,08,22
203,"Nice rooms, Good Restaurants, Great Location",This is the place to stay in Dublin ... walking distance to many attractions - just off the Grafton Street shopping and a few blocks from Trinity College. Catching sightseeing bus is easy and walking to many restaurants as well as beautiful parks. Have stayed in several Hotels in Dublin - this location is the best for shopping and available transportation.  Food is the restaurants and service were very good and the lobby desk people were very helpful.,4,2014,08,21
203,Hospitality. So much hospitality.,"In a way I am sad that we stayed at the Westbury as I have now realised what a great hotel could be like and I suspect I am going to be in for total disappointment at every other hotel we stay in from now on. From first booking the hotel (dealing with Gillian who was incredibly helpful) to our arrival with two small children totally jet-lagged, everyone was so friendly, welcoming, and hospitable. The receptionist we spoke to upon arrival took pity on us and magicked up a temporary room until our room was ready so we could crash for a few hours. This made a huge difference as after a few hours of power nap and freshening up we could get out and actually enjoy the city. Someone seeming to be senior welcomed us to the hotel in person giving the kids coloring pencils and coloring pads. The rooms were great. We had interconnecting rooms as promised by Gillian, and the kids room had a couple of Westbury teddies waiting for them on the beds. 

The little touches; hot towels and water bottles on arrival, the Butlers chocolate on the bed at turndown (that was actually so delicious we went and bought more of them for gifts!) together with the incredible staff and perfect location are the things that transform a hotel experience and are the things that make this hotel special. This is not a budget choice, but it is a great choice.",5,2014,08,21
203,The Best,"Great location, excellent facilities and superb service.  You may not consider this hotel because it's one of the most expensive ones in Dublin.  But the price is not outrageous and it's really well worth it.",5,2014,08,21
203,Joanne,"We had the most wonderful stay in the Westbury Hotel. Could not fault it. From we stepped in the door until we left we had just one complaint. Beautiful room to the front of the hotel. We stayed 3 nights Bed & Breakfast. We had an evening meal on  the Monday night. Staff from waitresses to reception to concierge were excellent & courteous. We found the  seating by the window in the front lounge, where we ate our evening meal quite uncomfortable.Otherwise everything was excellent.",5,2014,08,20
203,Outstanding hotel! Great staff!,"Just one back from staying two nights here and we were really impressed. We hadn't had the best journey as my eldest had been ill the night before and so we were all really tired when we arrived. When we first arrived we were told that our room wasn't ready yet ( I think something might have happened to the room?) which normally wouldn't have been a problem but we were ready to drop.
The lady who was looking after us ( her name was Louise Doyle we found out later) was really nice and kind.  We were offered an adjoining room instead of a room with 2 doubles (2 adults, 2 kids) which was perfect for us and the rooms were beautifully decorated. Immaculate and modern room with nespresso machine, seating area, plenty of room. 
 She really looked after us and even arranged for the kids to have some cookies and milk which went down a treat!  We thought it might have been a bit noisy as we were overlooking the street but this wasn't a problem at all. Comfy beds and  air conditioning, no outside noise.
It's 1 minute from Grafton St do right in the centre of things.
We had a rate which included a ""light breakfast"" which was served in the gallery lounge- this was tea or coffee, fruit juice, yoghurt, fruit salad, a croissant and a ""bran"" bread with jams.  My youngest wasn't keen so they let him get a pastry from the full breakfast restaurant.
Very friendly, bend over backwards, attentive staff.
Very nice hotel, , would dream of staying anywhere else if we go again.
Highly recommended!",5,2014,08,19
203,Great Hotel,Our family of four recently stayed at the Westbury for 2 nights.  It was a wonderful experience and an extremely nice and convenient location.  If you can swing the bill we highly recommend it.  Loved the chocolates at night!,5,2014,08,18
203,"Great service, great location","My parter and I stayed here for one night . We could not fault anything for our stay. The service is outstanding, the rooms are large and have a beautiful d√©cor.

If your questioning wether it will be money well spent to stay here then I would say don't even question it. 
From start to end the experience was fantastic. Worth every cent!!!

The location especially is great, just off the Main Street and very close to restaurants, pubs and shopping.

I would recommend this hotel to everyone!!!! ",5,2014,08,18

203,Excellent hotel. Superb service,"I recently stayed here overnight on a business trip. I have stayed in all the other five star hotels in Dublin but the service here was the very best I have received . Nothing is too much trouble and the staff are extremely helpful and professional . 
The only downside is that it's difficult to get to the front door with a car . The one way system is a nightmare. That said I rang the concierge who stayed on the phone and guided me through the Dublin streets . Like I say ... Great service . 
I look forward to returning here again ",5,2014,08,17
203,"Friendly staff, several service problems","Ideal location and friendly staff.  However, we were misinformed by the concierge desk about visiting Kilmainham Gaol, a primary tourist site, and about the relative availability of taxis that accept plastic (supposedly they exist, but we didn't find one and had to walk 45 min back to the hotel after an abortive visit to the Gaol -- very frustrating).  Worse, our wakeup call never came, causing us to nearly sleep through our flight home. ",3,2014,08,17
203,"Convenient, comfortable, good value","As others have noted, the Westbury is in an excellent location and has no downsides.  It is comfortable, with very good dining and exercise facilities, large rooms and reasonable rates. A great launching pad to pubs, restaurants, parks and museums.",5,2014,08,16
203,Great Location,"For me the thing that made this hotel very good was the location as it is just off Grafton Street and a great base to explore Dublin as it enables you to walk everywhere.  It is a bit difficult to find so definitely make sure you have a sat nav but once you arrive the staff and valet are very helpful.  We stayed in a suite with four poster bed, the room was big and the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was a bit pathetic regarding the size and the shower over the bath tub.  The breakfast was good but we would recommend skipping the hotel breakfast and going to Bewleys.",4,2014,08,16
203,Ita,"We could not fault this hotel. Great food.excellent comfort & staff exceptional.
We loved the Wilde dining room where we had breakfast every morning. The cleanliness of the rooms & hotel generally. Only one complaint. The seating. Chairswindow in the Lounge where we ate an evening meal were not too comfortable.",5,2014,08,15
203,Splendid... but don't try driving to it,"This is a top class hotel with comfortable rooms, good restaurant, city centre location just off the main shopping area around Grafton St and prices to match. Wonderfully central if you come on foot, another story if you come by car as we did, through a baffling maze of narrow one-way back streets (they have limited underground parking). My advice: take a taxi",4,2014,08,15
203,"Location,Location,Location","This hotel is a classic. Opulent,high end service and a fantastic central location. It is pricy but worth it! 
Parking is limited in Dublin so finding a hotel with underground (thought tight) parking is useful. From this base you can pretty walk everywhere. 
Decent cocktails in the bar and then onwards to a Temple Bar restaurant. The rooms are adequate and clean.",5,2014,08,14
203,"excellent hotel, excellent location, excellent manager staff.","Excellent. Manager staff very professional. I had a problem in my room and it was managed by the staff in the best and quickest way.

203,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at this gorgeous hotel last weekend on business. I was a little nervous this would be a snobby hotel given its status as a five star hotel popular with tv personalities etc. How wrong was I :) From entering the beautiful foyer after being warmly greeted by the concierge Derek, a complete gent I might add, the reception area is bright and welcoming as are the girls on the desk who promptly asked where we had traveled from. On our reply 2 warm wet towels were produced to freshen up while she booked us in. The rooms are fabulous, large and spacious with air con, huge TV, Wi-Fi etc. The Butlers Chocolates and a personalised welcome note from the manager served as a nice touch as-well. The toiletries are L'Occitane brand, luxurious and pretty presented along with warm towels in the well light bathroom. The restaurateur was beautiful in the sense it was more like a huge sitting room with a choice of sofa type seats or comfortable armchairs and not a  TV in sight which I was so glad about. The food is amazing and the restaurant staff are so attentive and helpful, not once did I have to pour my own glass of wine, a treat I could gladly become accustomed to. Breakfast was an experience too, with such a good choice of hot food from Full Irish  to kippers. The Continental Breakfast option had a wonderful display of may different types of cuisine, beautifully set out in style to the side of the eating area.Check-out was prompt and courteous. It was my first time to visit this beautiful hotel but it will definitely not be my last :)",5,2014,08,13
203,Great location but pricey,"This hotel is located in a great place and have been many times, it is one of my favourite hotels in Dublin. Would recommend this place for anyone. The staff are very friendly and the food is lovely too. Stay here and see for yourself!",4,2014,08,13
203,Elegant but Comfy,Really gracious hotel with warm friendly staff. Excellent location - you can walk almost anywhere in Dublin in 20 -30 min or less. Hotel had excellent nearby restaurant recommendations. Turn down service was like having a full room fix up.,5,2014,08,12
203,Luxury in Dublin,"Excellent hotel in Centrally located Grafton St.  Rooms are very well appointed - beautiful bed linen, very comfortable bed, all the expected amenities of a luxury hotel (warm towels, bathrobes, slippers, l'occitane toiletries, Nespresso machine, decent wifi connection).  Two good restaurants and a comfortable bar and lounge area.  Great service!!",5,2014,08,12
203,Quality,"Second hotel of our recent Dublin visit, not cheep but the quality speaks for its self as soon as you enter the lounge and bar areas.

203,Location and quality,"Had a lovely stay here in Dublin! This place was great. The staff was friendly all around and constantly checking to make sure we were taken care of. Sean at the front consistently gave us tips and was always greeting us. 
The location is ideal and walking distance from almost all of the major attractions as well as many pubs and restaurants and a huge shipping center.
The rooms are only so so. The water pressure is poor in the shower and the bed shakes easily but I would highly recommend this place to anyone!",5,2014,08,11
203,Great Hotel Centrally Located,"We travelled to the Dublin for 3 days from May 31 to June 2nd for a business trip with my husband's company..  The room was spacious and the hotel staff was amazing.  We loved the fact that the hotel was centrally located to dozens of restaurants, bars and fantastic shopping.  Great access to tour buses.  Great place to stay in Dublin.  We will return.",5,2014,08,10
203,"Great hotel, in a very good location for Dublin tourists.","Very good hotel, right off of Grafton Street. Lots of shopping, restaurants and sights nearby. Very friendly and accommodating staff, that go out of their way to please.

Standard room was very nice, though not particularly large (especially the bathroom, pretty small) but nicely appointed and comfortable. And just a note (as it can be hit and miss in Ireland) did have air conditioning in the room for those days where it happens to get just warm enough to need it.

Wonderful hotel that I'd highly recommend.",5,2014,08,10
203,"Excellent hotel, perfect location","Stayed here four nights on a leisure visit to Dublin. Really first rate, five star service from all the staff. The location just of Grafton street is excellent. Good bars, restaurants, lounges. The ordinary rooms are a bit on the wee side; if you can afford it, spring for the upgrade to the deluxe rooms, which are large, with four poster beds, large bathrooms with two sinks, very nice.",5,2014,08,08
203,Perfect birthday celebration,"Had the pleasure of staying here for two nights to celebrate my partners birthday and everything about the hotel was perfect! 
Located perfectly on a side street a stone throw away from O'Connell street (the spire)  and over the road from the temple bar area, The Westbury is the perfect place for getting around on foot! 
You have no problems whatsoever with noise so a good nights sleep is peaceful and easy! 
The rooms are very well presented with a stunning bathroom including soaps, shampoos ect and great facilities tea, coffee and monk bar including a turn down service! 
Upon arrival the reception staff couldn't of been more friendly! They welcome you with maps, fresh towels and a nice ice cold bottle of water with the choice of a complimentary paper outside your door each morning, not only that then lady on reception gave us some fantastic recommendations of were to go and the best way of getting there! 
The lounge and bar area are very impressive with a breath taking chandelier, the cocktails in the hotel are fab and very reasonable in price! The staff in the bar are immaculate and extremely professional! 
Would recommend using the local tram to get around the city much easier then the hop on hop off bus gets you there much quicker, if you are heading back to the airport the 747 bus is down the road from this hotel for transfers. 
Finally I would just like to thank everyone at the hotel for making our time away such an enjoyable one! 
 ",5,2014,08,08
203,Excellent,"Arrived for an overnight stay, checked in quickly, room was sumptuous. View not great but thats not the hotels fault! Very comfortable, no issues with aircon as mentioned in previous reviews. Breakfast arrived hot and on time. Wonderful hotel, excellent staff. One small gripe, despite following the large sign to the Car Park we could not find it. Parked in the College of Surgeons, only actually found the hotel car park on the way out that night on foot.",5,2014,08,07
203,Excellent hotel. Tough to drive to,"The hotel is a 5 star in every dimension. It is a bit hard to find from the airport with one way streets and traffic. Took a couple passes. Inside it is as good as any 
  Prices are fair the concierge is excellent.  Perfect central location.",5,2014,08,07
203,One of The Best,"From checking-in to departure this hotel offers service of the highest quality.  The staff are unfailingly polite and helpful; the rooms spacious, light and airy - the bed so comfortable.  Location simply cannot be beaten - right in the heart of Grafton Street.",5,2014,08,07
203,Very good hotel - excellent location,"Hosted a major event here last year and have only got around now to reviewing the hotel.

Staff were excellent and rooms, food and hotel professionalism was greatly appreciated.

Can recommend this for business and pleasure as it's very well located.

(The only off putting aspect concerning location is its proximity to city centre pubs, as some patrons may find this a little intimidating.)",4,2014,08,07
203,Friendly Service!!!,"The hotel is in the middle of town so you don't need a car to get around. Exceptional service was provided by every staff member we met. Lovely room everything you could possible want. We had a nice view down the main street.
      ",5,2014,08,07
203,Arnaque √† la carte bancaire !,"Unfortunately my guest experience of 6 nights in the westbury hotel is very bad, because of the way we have been treated. First, I would like to precise we did not reserve our trip on a booking site. At our arrival, we have been asked to give our credit card for a pre-authorization, which is very normal, but the woman at the front desk took the card, and took note of the three numbers on the back of the card!! Without our authorization!! We gave our card, trusting her, and she took note of the three numbers! The procedure of pre-authorization supposedly did not work (but we think it is wrong, and asked our banker, who confirm our credit card is working well), and we finally had to pay half of the sum.
On our last day we came on the front desk to pay the rest of which was due, and how badly surprised we were to find that 207‚Ç¨ have been took on our credit card‚Ä¶without our authorization! We did not, at any time, give to this woman, or nobody else, the authorization of taking some money directly on our credit card without us being in the front desk to tape our code! It completely is an illegal procedure ! It ruined our trip in Dublin!
This hotel, in the advertisement, speaks about ‚Äúpersonal relationships and trust‚Äù, supposedly ‚Äúbuilding it business‚Äù‚Ä¶ I have never read such a wrong ad!
I travel for many years, I have been in many countries‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs the first time I am so badly disappointed with the way I am treated in a hotel.",1,2014,08,06
203,Luxury Hotel,"From the moment you arrive until the time of departure, you will experience excellent treatment.
Would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to feel valued and it's convenient for shopping, restaurant and bars.",5,2014,08,06
203,Perfect for business and pleasure,"I just finished a 7 night stay at the Westbury, the first 4 days on business and the rest on holiday.   From check-in to check-out the staff could not have been more helpful. The room was clean and the turndown service was great.  The complimentary wifi was reasonably fast and reliable without the hassles or daily registration some hotels subject you to. The concierge gave some spot on restaurant recommendations.  The breakfast included with my rate offered a wide selection for a good value.   Needing a break from Guinness, on the last night I discovered the Marble Bar on the lobby level, which served up excellent cocktails.  I'd like to give a special shout out to Sean who seemed to work just about every job in the lobby at some point during my stay.  ",5,2014,08,05
203,"Beautiful hotel, great location","The Westbury Hotel is a welcoming and comfortable hotel with accommodating and friendly staff. It is located in the city centre, about 30 minutes taxi drive from Dublin Airport.

It is wonderfully located in the centre of Dublin, with most sights and shopping just minutes away (by foot). It's not the sort of hotel you'd go to for beautiful window views, but it's great to see Dublin city in just a few days and for shopping (it's just off Grafton Street, one of Dublin's more pricey shopping areas).

The staff are friendly and accommodating, but the rooms are a bit too standard to really call it a boutique hotel or to have that waw-factor. The food is excellent and affordable, though the Wilde Restaurant was absolutely deserted at dinner time during my stay (Wednesday evening).

All in all I would recommend this hotel for sheer convenience and comfort, despite being in a more expensive price bracket. Only minor disappointments were the slightly outdated or unimaginative interior (complete with sticky doors and drawers) and technology (phones, television (""multimedia centre"" - not really) and worthless hairdryer).

Few interesting points:
Rooms are air-conditioned (easily adjustable)
No balconies - windows open slightly
Sound insulation nearly nonexistent, despite claims of extra noise reduction (if you are a light sleeper, best to ask for a more isolated room)
Complementary wifi, newspaper and bottled water.",5,2014,08,04
203,Great location,"The best thing about the hotel is the location. Very central and within  walking distance to most attractions. The room is definitely luxurious with great sheets and pillows - a bonus after travelling over 24 hours. The concierge and housekeeping are great however the staff at checkin weren't overly friendly which was disappointing. Didn't eat at the hotel as a bit pricey. Would stay again if I could get a deal or promotional rate as when travelling solo it can add up. Loved that it was close to the airport bus also, it made it very easy to get from airport to hotel",4,2014,08,04
203,Great Location,"Just returned from a 2 week trip to Ireland, beginning in Dublin. We spent 3 nights here and loved it. The location is great for proximity to so many restaurants, stores, shops and pubs. The staff could not have been more attentive and accommodating and the room, although a teensy bit small (not unexpected in a big city) was very comfortable. Meals in the hotel were tasty, but a bit pricey. If you stay here and need a taxi, ask the concierge for Arthur. He drove us to the airport to pick up a rental car and then gave us written directions on how to leave the airport and head to Waterford.

Would not hesitate to return to this property.",5,2014,08,03
203,Disappointing,"We stayed here on a recent overnight trip to Dublin and although the location was great as it's in the city centre and plenty of shopping and close to the theatre, the hotel itself was slightly disappointing.I,ve been fortunate enough to have stayed in 5 star hotels abroad recently and this 1 just doesn't match up on the luxury stakes.The superior double room was really very basic and the double bed seemed a bit small!! Although the pillows were lovely .Breakfast was rather expensive at over 25 euro per head and wasn't included in the room rate. The main restaurant was also closed and the cafe within the hotel was mediocre. On the plus side though the staff were lovely, helpfull and friendly",3,2014,08,03
203,Visit to Dubl√≠n,"We were recommended The Westbury and were very satisfied, plus thankful to friends who sent us there. When visiting again would definitely return. Felt very welcomed during our stay. It also has the advantage of being walking distance to Manu sities se wanted to visit. An all round s√∫per  choice.",5,2014,08,02
203,All around excellent choice for a hotel in Dublin,"We stayed at the Westbury in early July 2014 and we really liked this hotel.  We arrived in Dublin in the AM after a flight from New York and went right to the hotel. The people at the hotel took a few minutes and had a nice room ready for for us right away and so we were able to get going on our Irish vacation.  The room was clean and comfortable and the staff could not have been more accommodating and professional.  The consierge made numerous nice suggestions for dinner and other things.  The best thing about this hotel is its location.  It is walking distance to virtually everything one could want in Dublin.  Grafton St. shopping, pubs, Temple Bar, St. Stephens Green and many other things.  I will definitely try to stay here again when I get back to Dublin.",5,2014,08,01
203,Central and Luxurious,"This is our second time staying in The Westbury and i loved it even more second time around. It is a real treat for my husband and I to stay in such a nice hotel but we felt welcomed by all the staff as soon as we walked up the street! It has beautiful, comfortable decor and the room was faultless. 
Considering it was only ‚Ç¨20 extra for a room with breakfast, it was amazing value, one of the nicest we've had in a hotel with an huge selection on the menu.
You cannot get a better location than The Westbury... shopping, bars and restaurants all beside it.
We can't wait to find an excuse to stay there again soon!",5,2014,07,30
203,Two night Easter stay,"We stayed here Easter Monday for two nights. We booked in for afternoon tea which was good, but not as good as I had expected for a 5star hotel and for the price we paid. We opted for the champagne afternoon tea which was nice. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as there seemed to be a little confusion with our booking which was disappointing. 
Whilst I enjoyed my stay I would have expected a little more for 5star. Room was nice, but a little small for our liking. Location is fantastic. Win walking distance of the shops and temple bar.",4,2014,07,30
203,Nite cap,We went to the west bury for a night cap last night after dining in Saba . We only had drinks but there is something about this hotel that makes it special . The bar man was at tentative and friendly .  The service was excellent and overall expierence was very good . We will definitely return,5,2014,07,30
203,Great hotel in a great location,"Great stay, love the hotel
Beautiful room
Love the location
The lobby area very inviting, the staff at bar were great and friendly
24 hours room service and pay per view tv , two things that I love to have in a hotel room
      
      ",5,2014,07,30
203,Wonderful hotel,"Stayed at the hotel for 7 nights and everything was perfect. Great location, excellent service, staff really helpful. A very elegant hotel. Very good breakfast and a beautiful bar, where besides having a drink, very well prepared dishes are served.",5,2014,07,29
203,What an experience,"From the moment we checked in every member of staff was very polite, courteous and extremely helpful. The bedroom was extremely well presented and most of all extremely clean. Will definitely be back!",5,2014,07,29
203,Best hotel in Dublin!,"I have stayed at The Westbury several times and have been provided exceptional service each time. The hotel is as nice as any I've ever stayed at, and the staff is wonderful. To top it off, the location cannot be beat! I would highly recommend anyone visiting Dublin stay here.",5,2014,07,29
203,Lovely service and great location,"We really enjoyed our 3-night stay at the hotel. The rooms were very nice - clean, well appointed and large. The hotel is very well-located - walking distance from most attractions like Temple Bar, Trinity College, Dublin Castle, etc. The service was warm and friendly. The concierge made multiple restaurant recommendations and each of those were bang on. I also liked how they replenished drinking water bottles, without us having to constantly request for it (as was our experience with the hotels in London) and handed us bottles of water whenever we stepped out in the sun.
Dublin was experiencing unusually warm weather when we were there, so we felt the air conditioning could have worked better.
Nonetheless, I would certainly stay here again, if we were ever back in Dublin.",5,2014,07,28
203,Great service and location,This was our second time returning to the hotel but our first with our 3 week old baby. The minute we arrived the staff were really helpful. Valet parking is brilliant. This allowed me to check in while the valet unloaded the car and my wife stayed in the car feeding. As soon as I got through a very prompt check in we were able to go directly up to the rooms and the bags were then brought up too. This made it very easy rather than having to stand in a queue with a crying baby. I was on business but my wife stayed in the room a lot of the day and was looked after well by the hotel with bottles of water being brought up whenever she needed any. Breakfast was once again very good. We didn't get to use many of the other hotel facilities but check out was also very swift and once again the valet had the car ready and packed by the time I had left the lobby. Made for a very smooth transition from the room to the car for the baby. Thank you,5,2014,07,28
203,Elegantry...,"Stayed here for a total of 5 nights, very elegant hotel from a vintage era. It's tucked back in a corner, which proves to provide a quieter stay than say some other hotels on the main strip with drunken people passing by and being loud. One particular hotel staff, Mr. Gaynor, was incredibly nice and helpful to us throughout our stay. As a matter of fact, most all the staff was, We also arranged a rental car on the spot with absolute ease with the help of the concierge. 

-Pro's

Quiet, elegant, good service, location.

-Con's

Air conditioner stopped working efficiently the second day, the heat was pretty brutal. We had to ask several times until finally the solution of a swamp cooler was brought in to remedy it. We left for other parts of Ireland of a few days, when we came back we were given a room with a perfectly functioning air conditioner so this may have been an isolated incident.

The Irish stew from room service could use some work.

Con's being said, I would definitely stay here again!.",4,2014,07,27
203,A great start to a great vacation,"The Westbury was our first stop in a fourteen day vacation. The staff is very professional, the location is almost perfectly situated, the food in the lobby was very good, the bellman always addressed me by my name and the concierge service was right on! While it was not number one in our visit had we not stayed at Harvey's Point the Westbury would have won hands down!",5,2014,07,26
203,No air conditioning,"Checked into room and went to meeting shortly after.  the room was lovely.  there were 2 fans in the room and when I returned to my room at 23:00, I discovered the air conditioning didn't work.  When I complained they brought up a machine that turned out to be a heater!!.  I changed rooms the next day but no recognition of my repeated requests for a refund for the evening were addressed.  I was traveling with 6 other people all who complained how loud the AC was.  Other than the temperature, it's a lovely hotel",3,2014,07,26
203,A great bit of luxury at the city center,"Our much anticipated stay was delayed by the second room not being ready. The room our family shared for a brief time was very clean, pleasant, and had a lovely bathroom. While waiting, most of our group did some shopping, since no pool was available in the hotel. The Wilde Restaurant was not available since we arrived on a Monday-(only open Fri. and Sat.). Other than that we had a enjoyable experience, and everyone slept well in the comfortable beds. The service at the desk and the doors was very good. We were surprised at the many restaurants and pubs within a short walk of the hotel. A great hotel worth investigating longer than we were able to do.",4,2014,07,25
203,Wonderful stay at the Westbury!,"I am writing this review while still at the Westbury. We arrived on Monday for a five day stay at the Westbury. Our choosing this hotel for our first trip to Dublin was based on excellent reviews from other travelers and I thought I should add my piece. I am traveling with my husband who is on a business trip.

Although part of the Doyle group this hotel is not like a chain hotel. It has a very boutique like quality, a part of the Leading Hotels of the world. Not overly large, it is beautifully decorated with fresh flowers everywhere. The service has been impeccable, we have tried the restaurants, the bar and everything else in between! We have a superior room, and it overlooks the street which is nice. The room is not very large but comfortable enough for two people. The linens are high quality and the bed and pillows very comfortable. The bathroom is a little small by American standards and shower was not the greatest I have seen, but that was not a problem at all. The bath products are very good quality. There is a gym in the hotel but no pool.

They have a Nespresso coffee machine as well as an electric kettle and tea bags which was great since we are tea drinkers. Of course the location is not to be beat. Pubs and restaurants at the doorstep. Very vibrant in the evenings with music and laughter everywhere. We were blessed with excellent weather though! Shopping at the doorstep and a short walk to Stephen's Green ( Park ) where you could sit and have a quick sandwich as well as feed the ducks! 
Dublin is a small city and most places are walking distance from the hotel which gave us a chance to explore things that were not necessarily very touristy.

Overall a wonderful experience, great service, friendly staff and a beautiful hotel. Highly recommend to everyone. If possible try the afternoon tea in the hotel lobby/restaurant. They serve wonderful sandwiches and pastries as well as Moet Champagne!  A big thank you to all at the hotel and to Joseph Downing, the guest relations manager for the wonderful chocolates delivered to our room.",5,2014,07,25
203,Beautiful hotel with excellent service in a good location,The rooms here are beautiful and the service was very friendly and efficient.  The location was great for shopping and dining and an easy walk to Temple Bar.  The only time we needed a taxi was to go to Kilmainham Gaol.,4,2014,07,24
203,First Rate Hotel & Staff,"I recently visited Dublin, Ireland for the first time for work.  The Westbury Hotel is very nicely located in the city center and has really nice rooms and very friendly staff.  I had a really great visit to Dublin and the Westbury was an important part of that good experience.  Highly recommended.",5,2014,07,24
203,Great hotel. Fantastic location.,"The Westbury staff was extraordinarily pleasant and helpful. Our room (jr suite) was huge with two double beds, large bathroom, extra amenities w heated towel rack and Nescaf√© coffee maker a nice touch. The location off Grafton St was ideal for us. Shopping and pubs right outside the front door. ",5,2014,07,22
203,Perfect hotel in perfect spot,"Unfortunately we only had a one night stop here at the Westbury, on our way to and from! But it was the perfect place. I was so impressed by everything the hotel had to offer. Next time it will definitely be for longer, if the purse strings allow!  ",5,2014,07,22
203,Amazing Manager,The hotel is well situated and if you are on an upper floor it is very quiet.  The breakfast option included in the price is a very good value. Large assortment of fresh options.  Joseph the manager is exceptional and a very passionate historian who was able to guide our itinerary and make dinner suggestions.,5,2014,07,21
203,"Great location for business, shopping or leisure in Dublin","The Westbury lived up to its five stars! You're wonderfully located in the centre of the Dublin culture, the luxury of The Westbury and convenience of the city. Upon its  entrance is The Solomon 
art gallery (great find!!), and a beautiful quaint arcade where hand made lingerie and wedding gowns may be found and this is before one enters the Westbury's magnificent lobby. I had a wonderful 2 night stay. Room service was average and I'd recommend eating out. Staff are extremely pleasant and friendly. I felt more welcomed here than I had done on a previous visit to The Merrion Hotel. Will definitely return. 
",4,2014,07,21
203,Wonderful Hotel,"Our stay was wonderful with the hotel condition, staff, facilities and location second to none.
The Westbury Hotel is all about providing a very high standard. If you want to feel special and be treated exceptionally well, this is the right hotel. it is not cheap, but it is value for money.",5,2014,07,21
203,"Fantastic hotel, perfectly located","When you explore an international city like Dublin, one of the keys to getting around is being able to walk out your hotel front door and have access to everything you want. The Westbury is ideally located for those who want to walk the streets of Dublin or take a taxi or bus or catch a tour. On top of that, every person working there were so helpful, friendly and always asking us if there was anything else they could do for us. Whatever we wanted, we just asked and it was done quickly an without fuss or inconvenience to us. And when we did have one issue regarding a ""lengthy"" afternoon tea that was not to our total satisfaction, it was quickly addressed to our complete satisfaction (which the the true sign of any good service provider). 
This is not for those looking for a cheapest hotel rates in Dublin, but when you factor in the location and quality of the rooms, it is money you don't mind spending. We enjoyed our 4 nights and would definitely go back.",5,2014,07,21
203,"Lovely hotel near city center, see note for driving to this hotel.","This is a really lovely, though a bit pricey, hotel. It's right off of Grafton Street, in the heart of the city. It's within easy walking distance of Trinity College, St. Stephen's Green and the big shopping district. 

We enjoyed a lovely stay, with a comfortable bed, ample, excellent quality towels and bedding, turn down service. All the staff were pleasant and polished, some even friendly. We arrived shortly after 9 am and the strove to get us into at least one of our rooms as soon as possible, even calling one of our cell phones to notify us that one of ours rooms had become available earlier than the 3 pm check in time. We were in our other room by 2 pm. They stowed our bags before the rooms were ready and gave suggestions for easy touring for the morning while we waited.

****Drivers should be aware that the hotel is NOT on Grafton Street (hotel location actually denotes the neighborhood and a pedestrian zone ""Grafton Street"" which extends from Suffolk/Nassau Street to St. Stephan's Green) but is in fact between Clarendon Street and Balfe Street. If you are driving to the hotel, you'd do best to have your GPS destination be Balfe Street, which is a short (mostly) one-way street that curves toward the hotel entrance and valet.",5,2014,07,21
203,First Day in Dublin,"We arrived from the airport from all night trip.  We arrived at 5:30 A.M. and discovered that our room was not ready (which was very understandable).  We worked with two gentlemen from the night crew.  They helped us setting up a room at the earliest convenience.  They also supplied us with coffee while we waiting, directions to any nearby cafes (including their own), and helped us with getting phone service in Ireland (we are from the U.S.).  All in all we had a great impression of the hotel and its services.  We took a morning nap, explored the city in the afternoon, and spent a restful night in our room (available at 9:00 A.M.).  The accommodations were excellent and well worth the cost.  The location was also excellent.",5,2014,07,21
203,"Wonderful location, very enjoyable hotel","Loved the location, right in the heart of the city.  Lovely rooms.  Excellent service from all staff.  Breakfast is pricey, but otherwise definitely feel the hotel rooms and experience were worth the cost.",5,2014,07,21
203,"Location, Location, Location","From previous experience, when you want to be at the very Centre of Dublin, the Westbury offers everything you could possibly want, with the best shopping, dining and cultural walkabout - Trinity, National Library, National Museum - all on your doorstep  ",5,2014,07,21
203,The best of service,Our stay at the Westbury was one of the most enjoyable experiences we have had in a hotel stay in ireland. The service and general attention to detail of all the staff we encountered was a credit to the hotel management.,5,2014,07,21
203,Would score higher but for the service,"Room and public spaces get 4.5*. I know it's an over used phrase but the Westbury really is in the perfect location as you can walk to pretty much all of the major attractions and there are lots of restaurants within a 10 minute walk in any direction. The public spaces are attractive and elegant and the room we had was quite large for the price and well appointed.
Service 2.5*: We arrived from the airport at 2:00 fully aware that check in is listed as 3:00 but just wanted to drop our luggage, have lunch and stretch our legs after a long flight.  After lunch and a walk we headed back to the Westbury at 4:00. The women at reception said the room was still not ready and went into the office to ""check with her colleague"".  When she returned she walked straight past us without a word and proceeded to help another customer. There was another women behind the desk so I asked her about our room. She looked at the computer and had a very confused look on her face and did not seem to know what to do so she went and consulted with the first women I had spoken to. Finally, 10 minutes after I first inquired about the room they finally figured things out and gave me the key. Before getting on the elevator I pointed out that our luggage was sitting in the corner by concierge. I was told it would be brought right up.  Our luggage was not brought up until placing a call 30 mins later and then brought to room 10 mins after that. 
Lastly, After finishing breakfast at Wilde's the 2nd morning the waitress's brought the wrong check twice before getting it correct.
Also, a note for you tall folks out there, at 6'4"" I was too tall for the shower (my head was right at ceiling level and needed to duck under the shower head.",3,2014,07,20
203,Nice Hotel but difficult to reach by car,"The hotel is very nice with relatively large rooms and a beautiful lobby.  The staff were warm and friendly, especially the doormen.  But it is difficult to reach the hotel by car so plan your attack ahead of time.  The car's GPS system kept trying to send us the wrong way down a very narrow street overrun by pedestrians.  After wandering fruitlessly around, we finally tried Google Maps, which got us to the hotel through every crooked alley in Dublin.  On the plus side, the hotel is very well located for walking.",4,2014,07,20
203,Perfect location,"This is a wonderful hotel! Perfect location - right in the heart of Dublin with many attractions and stores within walking distance. Great breakfast and friendly, helpful staff. 
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the water pressure in the shower is a bit too weak for my liking.",4,2014,07,20
203,"Awesome location,  great hotel","You can't beat the location of this hotel. The surrounding area is filed with shops,  restaurants,  and pubs. As I walked around the city I couldn't understand how people justify staying elsewhere.

The hotel itself was very clean and welcoming. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. Room could have been a bit larger,  but tge size was fi e. There is no doubt that I will be staying here when I return. 

Do yourself a favor and book this hotel. ",5,2014,07,20
203,Really fantastic! Great location & rooms,"A friend and I were actually staying at another hotel, when early one morning we stumbled upon the Westbury when looking for somewhere to have breakfast early one Sunday morning. We wandered in, and after being wowed by the reception area we headed into the restaurant for a coffee. We ended up having breakfast there, and promptly enquired if there was availability. After being told yes, we promptly went back to our original hotel, packed our things, and moved straight into our room at the Westbury. The hotel we were in originalynmessed up our room, and we had requested a twin share room, however we were presented with only one queen sized bed. The Westbury however was a completely different story. The room was HUGE, with 2 king sized beds each. The room is furnished and decorated to an excellent level, and the bedding is gorgeous. I will only ever stay here when I visit Dublin again. A must! In a fantastic location, in the lovely area of shops and cafes.",5,2014,07,19
203,Big Hotel,"The hotel itself is ideally located right in the center of Dublin.  Within walking distance of all attractions.  Our rooms (two different visits in the same week) were clean and comfortable.  The staff is courteous and mostly efficient.  The continental breakfast, which was included with our room, is perfect and served in the very comfortable lobby atmosphere.  The bathrooms were new and well stocked.  And, if you are a coffee/tea lover, there is a espresso machine in the room, with ceramic cups to serve in. Wonderful chocolates were offered with the evening turn down.  All in all, a great place to stay in Dublin.",4,2014,07,18
203,Thoroughly recommended,"Great location just off Grafton St. which is convenient for seeing Dublin.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Comfortable and clean room which was well equipped.
The sight seeing bus is a good idea for getting a feel for the city and your ticket can be used for 2 days.",5,2014,07,18
203,"Top Class Hotel,  5 Star service. ","My Wife and I stayed here for a night last November on our way back from a trip to America. Quite frankly,  I could not recommended it highly enough. It was an amazing stay. The location couldn't be better. Right in the heart of the the city.

Its luxurious, comfortable and has a lovely bar with great cocktails. However, without doubt what sets this hotel apart is the service. The warmth and  friendliness was just exceptional. I have been lucky enough to stay in 5 Star Hotels all over the world and in fact was returning from a stay in one in the U.S. but The Westbury is as good if not better than any I have stayed in.",5,2014,07,17
203,A very nice place to stay.,"I was on a tour with Tauck Tours and we stayed at the Westbury. It was lovely. The staff was wonderful and very professional. Our rooms were really nice. Now I will say that if your looking for a beautiful view, you might get a view of air conditioners on roof tops like we did. Did we care, no! The view of the sun setting and the tops of the churches were fine with us. The lobby is beautiful, the High Tea was great, food in both restaurants was very good. I enjoyed the breakfast buffet. You are in walking distant of attractions, restaurants, shops and parks. It was a lovely hotel and again, I was on a tour, so I am unclear what our room rate was. If you planning a trip to Dublin, please check out the Westbury Hotel and if you stay there, I hope you will enjoy it, as I did.",4,2014,07,16
203,Positively Lovely!,My husband and I had a wonderful stay at The Westbury. The hotel is perfectly located; within walking distance of all that you will want to see and do. Breakfast was delicious and the staff delightful. Cannot imagine that anything better. Highly recommend. ,5,2014,07,16
203,Magical Hotel in a Magical City,"This hotel is, quite simply, superb.  Salubrious surroundings, accommodating staff and a perfect location are all factors that contribute to a wonderful stay in the heart of Dublin.

Situated in Grafton Street, excellent restaurants, bars and shopping are just a stone's throw away and the hotel bar/lobby area is the perfect place to rest your feet after a long day walking the cobbles.  Myself and my partner enjoyed (several) cocktails there before heading out in the evenings and they were excellent.

There were so many little touches that made our stay in The Westbury memorable.  We will most certainly stay here again and I really can't recommend it highly enough.",5,2014,07,16
203,Fantastic and Polished,This is a great hotel.  The rooms were top-notch and comfortable.  The lobby is a very stylish and a great place for a drink or a bite.  Service all around was superb which to me is the most important aspect of a hotel stay.  In particular top marks to the concierges who made great dinner reservations and really took time to help me get situated in Dublin.  I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to even the fussiest luxury hotel aficionado!,5,2014,07,15

203,Beautiful hotel ideally located,This is a sumptuous property with great attentive staff and ideal location - between two pubs - j sheehans for classic Irish comfort food and Bruxelles which has live music and is a joy to fall asleep to later. Steps away from grafton st for walking and shopping also very near to temple bar - the cafe bar boutique hot spot. The hotel serves a perfect cappuccino and croissant inclusive breakfast and the concierge goes out of their way to be attentive - my only criticism is that the rooms need some improvement - less than great bed - surprisingly so and outdated plumbing in bathroom - minor complaints in an overall splendid stay - check the view fr room 418- can't be beat!,4,2014,07,11
203,Perfect,"Stayed here May 2014 for my birthday, booked a deal which including a suite room, breakfast, afternoon tea, jo Malone massage and personal shopper at Brown Thomas.

The hotel is ideally located in the centre of Dublin although I'm sure we walked the long way round everytime we returned lol.

The staff were very friendly, a warm welcome or goodbye was always given as well as very friendly porters helping with luggage to and from the car.
The rooms were comfortable and well equipped, the four poster was great and assured a gd nights sleep.

Breakfast and afternoon tea was fantastic and again the staff were great.

The hotel is very big yet it seemed like you got that personal touch and were very welcome.

I'd definitely stay here again the decoration is great and oozes class",5,2014,07,10

203,A Luxury Weekend,"Very hospitable service, they upgraded our room free of charge. Faultless maid service in room, good location with some nice nearby pubs, gorgeous breakfast, helpful staff, luxury bar area and a great weekend in Dublin! I would seriously recommend going to the Guinness storehouse! Killmainham Gaol was worth a visit but go as early as you can as the tours get booked out and you may end up waiting for quite a while. Also be careful booking a taxi to the airport through the hotel as we were overcharged; possibly by the high caliber of the hotel. 
Overall, it was a very enjoyable and delightful stay and we would definitely return. 
Tip: Put blackcurrant in your Guinness because it tastes lovely!",5,2014,07,08

203,Comfort and customer service is a priority at the Westbury,"I was at the Westbury for a work conference and stayed at the hotel for 4 nights.I was really impressed with the level of attention and customer service at the hotel. From the concierge to the housekeeping to the restaurant staff, everyone was helpful and pleasant to speak with. The hotel property is maintained well and clean. Occasionally we could hear the guests in the room next door. But we still managed a good night's sleep. The hotel is centrally located near good restaurants, bars, and shopping. Historic landmarks and museums are within walking distance. You will truly enjoy your stay and feel comfortable  when you are at the Westbury.",5,2014,07,07

Very attentive staff from bell hops, concierge, front desk, housekeeping. Rooms were very comfortable, clean and well appointed. Wouldn't hesitate to go back again. Only advice if driving: call hotel and have them guide you in. With recently changed traffic patterns due to downtown road work and maze of narrow one way streets, it is a difficult hotel to drive to, but well worth the effort!!",5,2014,07,06
203,Westbury Dublin Great!,"We stayed in three different 4/5 Star hotels in Dublin during our two week Ireland holiday and Westbury was our favourite.

203,Excellent hotel in great location,"Just returned from a 4 night break at the Westbury.  Room was very clean and very quiet given the location.  The location just off Grafton Street is perfect for exploring central Dublin on foot.  The staff were all very helpful, would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,07,06
203,Good hotel in a great area.,"We enjoyed our 3 day stay at the Westbury. It is located in a great area near Grafton St. Its a walkable distance to Temple Bar & St. Patricks.
The Front Desk/Concierge staff was very accommodating and helpful. Good recommendations for casual places to eat nearby. The room was large, comfortable and clean. 

The only downside was that very loud music could be heard and vibration felt from a wedding reception in the ballroom below us after midnight until 2am. Even though we did request a ""quiet room area"" in our advance reservation. We wrote an e-mail regarding the late night noise level, but did not receive a response.  Also, the service in the afternoon tea area was not that great.",4,2014,07,03
203,"Amazing hotel, excellent staff!!","We loved the Westbury.  Rooms are beautiful and clean.  It is centrally located and the staff is amazing.  24 hour room service and if by chance in the middle of the night you decide you need a bottle of Champaign, no matter what staff number you dial, it'll be at your door. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin. 
They also have a great relationship with the taxi drivers, so you'll have amazing service from them as well.",5,2014,07,03
203,Excellent Stay,"I personally would prefer staying in The Westbury hotel for the location and services. You would love to come back to your awesomely cleaned room with a smile everyday from work. With the services and complimentary services, this hotel is worth the amount we pay.",5,2014,07,03
203,Terrific Honeymoon,"The Westbury Hotel was an amazing location for our visit to Dublin. We wanted a central location that would give us the opportunity to walk wherever we wanted or have easy access to public transit. We arrived very early (7am), and they were very accommodating. They recommended a local pub for breakfast and called within an hour to let us know that our room was ready. We had nightly turn down service with the tv set to classical music which set a romantic mood. The concierge services were phenomenal. The hotel restaurant was delicious, also. We had dessert each night while sitting in the beautiful lobby. 
It was a phenomenal experience.",5,2014,06,30
203,Wonderful hotel,"The Westbury is a great little hotel in the heart of Dublin. Staff are very friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was included and offered an excellent selection.

203,Exceptional personal service,"Slipped into the Westbury last night with a couple of friends after eating elsewhere. We sat near the restaurant and ordered a bottle of wine. The young male waiter was extremely professional in his level of service, perfect level of attention (not to much and not to little).  He must have noticed us raising our glasses to wish Happy Birthday because he returned with a complementary plate of miniature desserts on a decorated plate.   Really nice touch! 
Well done Westbury

203,Perfect Hotel for Dublin,"Felt very lucky when we arrived at The Westbury. It was the perfect location, just off Grafton Street, and the amenities were outstanding. Plus a wonderful and friendly staff! The rooms were very nice and up to date, with a very nice bathroom. The public rooms were very spacious and were located on the first floor up, so the window provided the perfect spot to watch all the action outside while enjoying a quiet glass of wine. The concierge did a great job in recommending a lovely dinner spot. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2014,06,25
203,Comfiest bed ever!,"I stayed at the Westbury Hotel recently for 4 nights, and I had a very pleasant and comfortable stay. The rooms are not very large, but have all the amenities you will need for a comfortable stay including bathrobes, slippers, free Wi-Fi, wake-up call, US plugin connections etc. It took me a while to figure out the Nespresso machine, but once I did, I couldn't have enough of the free expresso in my room. The bathrooms were very well laid out, all marble, although the tub is a little deep and might be hard for some people to get in and out of. The rooms are a little small for a 4-star hotel, but there were several nice touches to the room like turn-down service, free chocolates, bottle of water.
The bed was large and very comfortable, and I loved the background music that was turned on in my room when I checked in.
I did have one small issue with the first room that I was given, I came back after dinner and the room was very hot! I called the front desk and they promised to have someone come and help me ""turn on the AC"". They called in about an hour, and told me that they had found out the AC in the room was broken and moved me to a different room, which was great.
The Westbury is a great option for someone who wants to be in the middle of everything in Dublin, a clean, comfortable stay. Although the prices are really high, I think you get great service and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I could get spoiled with people offering to open doors, call elevators and carry luggage for you! I am really looking forward to staying at the Westbury again on  my next visit to Dublin.",5,2014,06,24
203,Peace and Quiet,"We had just flown in from Edinburgh where we were kept awake in a noisy apartment.  Accordingly, it was wonderful to arrive at this hotel with double glazed windows which means you cannot hear a single sound, even though the hotel is situated right the busiest part of Dublin.
 Also the food and the service is great, and the staff are wonderful.",5,2014,06,23
203,Clean and Modern Facilities and Exceptional Service,"Most everything in the Westburry was five star, from the restaurant, to the service to the clean and modern rooms and facilities.  The Westburry is everything a luxury city hotel should be and is probably the best place to stay in Dublin.

Our room felt very clean and all the decor was up-to-date. The beds were comfortable and the top quality blinds helped to block out light so we were able to sleep longer. However, the room, like many hotel rooms in Europe was quite small.  The bathroom was an acceptable size, except the shower felt uncomfortably tiny and we could hear our neighbor's TV from the bathroom.  Also, while we were there, our AC wasn't working and neither were other's on the second floor.  They brought us a fan, but for those who prefer colder temperatures, it could be uncomfortable.   I was happy with the quality and amenities in our room, including the turn down service and complimentary bottled water.  

The Westburry had some of the best service I've seen at a hotel.  Everybody was very friendly and eager to help.  The concierge was very responsive to any problems we had.  We once called and requested a toothbrush which was brought to us within 45 seconds of our call.

The hotel restaurant, Wilde, was very good for breakfast.  They offered a large buffet with many selections as well as unique menu.  I would recommend the avocado toast.

Overall, I had a very good experience at the Westburry and plan to return!",5,2014,06,21
203,"""Oh, my--very swank!""","I'm a fan of small, friendly, quirky hotels, but I will make an exception for The Westbury. It's large, still friendly, but definitely not quirky. In fact, this Dublin Hotel could be located in any large, metropolitan city. Every amenity you might wish for is here in abundance. The room, though not large, was well-appointed, recently decorated, and extremely comfortable. I had a lovely night's sleep all three nights I was there, and that's what important when you're traveling. I like to be on a higher floor (and if you know Dublin, you know buildings are NOT tall there), but the second floor room presented no problems at all as far as noise level. The huge, glossy lobby with truly stunning fresh flower arrangements also had cozy corner tables and plush sofas and arm chairs, some by expansive windows overlooking the streets of the city. I found the desk staff to be businesslike yet quite approachable and always willing to help. I needed to re-book a transcontinental United flight in Business/First Class. This was done with a minimum of effort by the competent concierge who did NOT want to accept a generous tip for his efforts. I left one anyway, which he said would go into the common tip drawer to be shared by the concierge staff at week's end. Very nice of him. Breakfast was both sinful and plentiful, typical of the best Irish hotels. The fresh fruit was beautifully presented in small, perfect, seedless slices. Scones and chocolate croissants were light, flaky, and heavenly. Fresh juice and yogurt parfaits were cool and refreshing. It was perfectly suited to a busy time schedule, as you serve yourself. Coffee was strong and flavorful, frequently replenished. Real cream and Irish butter added to the luxury of a delightful morning repast. None of this luxury comes cheap, but if you want a first-rate experience, look no further than the Westbury. One final note:  After dining out on the road so much, I was ready for room-service one evening. If you are an American craving a taste of home with an Irish accent, go for the Angus cheeseburger and fries. Again, it won't come cheap (with a nice tip and room service charge, it ran me 30 Euros), but the ridiculously thick, juicy patty on a sweet, brioche-style roll with all the trimmings and steak-cut crispy fries on the side  was almost...well, let's just say I was glad to be alone as I ate so no one would be distracted by the ""yummy"" sounds I couldn't help making! It even came with a fresh flower in a vase, which I put on the nightstand to remind me of a spectacular meal. If you visit the Westbury, I am confident you won't be disappointed. It's well-situated near Trinity and is a quick walk to a plethora of luxury shops, pubs and dining establishments. And do yourself a favor--spend 30 Euros on the cheeseburger. I promise you won't regret it!",5,2014,06,20
203,Style but no substance,"Interesting hotel, quite amazing bar, spacious great service and a lovely entrance with welcoming staff.

Central location in the heart of Dublin too

Rooms distinctly average - plush, perhaps but not stand out.

Breakfast - oh dear service with a snarl and SLOW

Improve the rooms and then yes",3,2014,06,19
203,What we needed!,"At 6 a.m., the end of a flight from Oklahoma USA, we needed a place to crash. Though our room wasn't yet available, the friendly staff provided more than we needed (couches, food, directions and info, etc.) during our hours-long wait.

203,Nice experience,"Friendly staff, helpful and cheerful.  Location is excellent for shopping, restaurants and pubs.  Taxis always available and presentable.  Lobby very , very nice , rich furniture, and quite accommodating . Free internet and drinking water .",5,2014,06,14
203,"Scones and tea, tea and scones","Having stayed at the Westbury Hotel, I believe it has to be one of the best located hotels in the Dublin city centre.   It is commensurate with other Leading Hotels of the World (all five star properties), in terms of both service and decor (as well as amenities), yet  not in terms of price.  Even taking into account the somewhat miserable Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate, the Westbury, while pricey, is a better value than other five stars I have stayed at in other countries.

The rooms are lovely, with quality linens and elegant but contemporary decor.  The bathroom is clean and modern.  I was upgraded-twice!-to an awesome, spacious suite (don't expect or demand this as hotels upgrade based on availability and/or loyalty programs, etc; many hotels don't upgrade).  This was done by the nicest, most professional manager I've met in my travels-Joseph Downing, guest relations manager.  He, as well as all staff encountered, was friendly and gracious.  I was even given an ice pack for my back while I had delicious tea and scones (I regret not having the full tea- it is supposed to be wonderful-but had already pigged out on one in London!).

If you get a chance to stay at The Westbury, Dublin, I would highly recommend.",5,2014,06,13
203,Not up to Standard,"I was looking forward to treating myself to a luxury weekend at a 5 star hotel in the middle of the city. I had visions of a large comfortable room with all the little lovely extras of other five star hotels I have stayed in ‚Äì one of my favorites being the Merrion ( who were full that weekend).

I was greatly disappointed.  All the rooms in this hotel are in need of a major refurbishment.  At nearly Euro 300 per night one would expect a certain standard of accommodation. This was sadly lacking in all aspects except a good bed and a nice view. The double room was small, the windows were dirty, the furniture extremely tired looking. The dark somber woodwork was chipped, the ice bucket was tarnished and there were no shelves for one‚Äôs clothes.

The small fridge was poorly stocked and one could not accommodate a jug of fresh milk which I had to request so that I could enjoy a cup of tea. They had those awful little milk punnets you get in 2 and 3 star hotels.  The coffee machine did not work properly.

The bathroom was tiny with ( horrors!) a shower over the narrow bath which is my pet hate.

I went to have a look at the Deluxe Room ( I had the standard Superior Room) and it was huge- drab looking with again a tiny bathroom with a shower over the bath!

So here are the positives:  The place is very central and just off Grafton street very convenient.  The lounge area is lovely and large- has lots of atmosphere and the service is somewhat slow but very friendly. There is a charming bar off the lounge which can get very full over tea time where the public come for their famous ‚Äòhigh tea‚Äô which looked inviting.  There is also a coffee bar/ light meal restaurant on the street level next to the main entrance. It is very light and airy with very friendly service. The cups are a bit small and the coffee slightly too bitter for my taste, but a good enough place to have a light breakfast or lunch.  I did not taste the food however so cannot comment on that.

The staff at this hotel are all very professional , warm, friendly and helpful especially the Assistant Director of Sales, Ken Lyons who could not do enough for me when I complained bitterly about the room as well as Guest Relations, Lindsay White, from a free glass of wine , coffee to a late checkout. Kudos to them for trying to please me as best they could and to make my stay more pleasant. However the fact remains that this hotel is overpriced and just NOT up to standard. I certainly would not stay here again until they have refurbished the place!",3,2014,06,13
203,The Best Hotel in Dublin,"We would never stay anywhere else in Dublin. What a lovely hotel, on the best street in Dublin. Close to St. Stephen's Green, and Trinity College. A very safe area, and right off of Grafton Street. The hotel is very clean, safe, and away from the rowdy parts of Dublin. Would definitely stay here again, and have recommended it to friends.",5,2014,06,13
203,Absolutely faultless!,"My stay at the Westbury was exceptional! Every small detail was taken care off (We even got some birthday chocolates & a handwritten card)! Staff were extremely pleasant and professional.

The room was modern, clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was impeccably designed. The minibar was big enough to stash two bottles of wine also!

But most of all, the location is brilliant. The ability to step out of the hotel straight onto Grafton Street was extremely handy. Although expensive, a stay at the Westbury is a great treat and my experience was perfect!",5,2014,06,13
203,Great Hotel and Fabulous Location,"Located on Grafton Street, which has a fabulous shopping area, pubs and diverse restaurants. Walking distance to nearly all major attractions in Dublin.

 negatives-bathrooms would benefit from a walk in shower rather than having to try and hurdle a very high sided bath!! Bfast staff need retraining!",4,2014,06,12
203,Relaxation all the way,"Having stayed at The Westbury on a few occasions the standard is as good as ever. It is exactly what it says, a 5 star hotel. Location excellent and parking at the hotel is an extra bonus (worth the ‚Ç¨20). Relaxing in the foyer in the evening is just what you want after walking around the city. Highly recommend a stay there but not the cheapest hotel. Worth going for that special occasion.

203,Rather disappointing . . .,"I wanted to be sure that our first trip to Ireland would be special, and I made sure that I booked a 5 star hotel for our comfort.    Honestly, I would rate this hotel as a 3, or a 4 at best.    It is overpriced for what you get, and you even have to pay $15.00 for a continental breakfast which I find ludicrous.    The room was a bit cramped, though set up lovely, and comfortable.    

Sadly, it is not worth the money each night.    ",3,2014,06,12
203,I'm betting that it's the Best Hotel in Ireland,"My husband and I stayed here two nights and though quite expensive it was so worth it... 
The best location... The best breakfast by far... Eggs and Omlettes cooked to order... the Continental breakfast was certainly enough. Our room rate included the full breakfast. It was booked by our travel agent and we were very happy with every amenity....
We arrived early in the day so was advised by the concierge to have lunch at a nearby cafe with outdoor seating... Our room was ready when promised.",5,2014,06,11
203,Genuinely a home from home,"A business colleague of mine and I stayed at The Westbury recently and were really impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. We were quite late arriving but the person at the arrivals desk was totally unphased and had everything already prepared to make our check in fast and easy.

We did not eat in the hotel that evening so are unable to comment on their main restaurant but we did breakfast at the hotel in the secondary one. The service and professionalism was superb. We were seated promptly and provide everything we needed by the waiters. I have eaten in many restaurants where the waiters seem to have developed that 'far away stare' where I am staring straight at them and frantically signalling them but the look through and past me without seeing me at all. This is not the case at The Westbury. Every time I looked up someone made eye contact with me and came running across.

I was also impressed that when I asked for the bill in the restaurant they brought it with the credit card machine ready to take a payment. It makes so much more sense than leaving a piece of paper and then coming back later to take payments.

The hotel is in good condition and of habitable proportions. The bathrooms are well appointed and spotlessly clean. The views are over the rooftops of Dublin which is more interesting than picturesque. It is well placed for Grafton Street and St Stephen's Square.

I will definitely return there and would recommend it to any traveller visiting Dublin.",4,2014,06,11
203,Great spot in Dublin,This was a nice location. We enjoyed walking many places in Dublin from here. The accommodations were modern and comfortable. We felt like this was a nice transition back into the modern world after a week in quaint and remote Irish villages.,5,2014,06,10
203,Excellent hotel in Dublin,The hotel is very good situated close to The walking street and shopping area and with many excellent restaurants within walking distance. The service from all staff are outstanding and the rooms provides very good comfort.,5,2014,06,10
203,another great stay at The westbury,"I love staying at this hotel in Grafton Street, it is so near to everything, and all the staff are lovely, all the porters greet you like long lost friends, the beds are comfy and include everything you need, I just could not get the hang of the coffee machine. This is my favourite stay in Dublin City.",4,2014,06,10
203,Delightful!,"This is a delightful hotel in a fantastic location.  Just off Grafton Street, it's an easy walk to so many places: Trinity College, the Abbey Theatre, etc.   My room at the hotel was comfortable and well appointed.  The staff was friendly, helpful, and attentive.

Be sure to have afternoon tea or a meal in The Gallery.  The rustic brown bread that came with my meal was honestly some of the most delicious bread I've ever had.  The whole meal was excellent and relaxing.

There were only two things that were less than excellent.  The wifi in my room was not great.  However, staff came up to work on it immediately.  They offered to move me to another room, but as we found a spot where the reception was decent I chose to stay where I was.  The other part that was a bit disappointing was the wait staff in The Gallery.  There were times when I felt like they were purposely avoiding looking at diners trying to get service.  I found, though, that while they didn't always look my way, if I spoke up as they walked by they were very pleasant and efficient.

I will most certainly stay at The Westbury again the next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2014,06,10
203,Amazing Stay,"I absolutely loved our recent stay at the Westbury.  I was extremely happy with the location off Grafton Street and between Trinity College on one side, and St. Stephen's Park on the other.  There are tons of places to eat and shop within a few minutes walk of the hotel.  The staff greeted us warmly and were very helpful throughout the week with whatever question or need arose.  In particular, Hazel was a gem to work with from reservations through our stay.  The hotel is beautiful, and has a gathering room for afternoon tea or drinks.  It looked like Dublin society was meeting in the gathering room in the afternoons. Our room was elegantly decorated, quite, and comfortable.  When I return to Dublin, I will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,06,09
203,1st Class,"This is a very nice hotel.  Beautifully decorated & polite, friendly staff.  Hard to find!  Happened upon it purely by accident & one of the staff actually got in car to direct us to front of hotel.  Clean rooms & comfy beds.",4,2014,06,09
203,Class right in the city,"The hotel was easy to walk to from central Dublin.  Grafton street has little caf√©s and convince stores to take food or snacks back to the room.
It was very clean and elegant.  Turndown service is around 6 pm so if you turn in early, put the DND sign on the door for privacy.  The room had plenty of outlets; even one that took US style plugs. And there was one that took USB plugs took. An adaptor was handy, but not necessary. 
 The staff was professional, kind and helpful.  The concierge desk was most helpful in answering questions about getting around.  There is a queue of taxis outside most mornings so getting around that way is quite easy (albeit more expensive than the bus).",5,2014,06,08
203,"Staff are lovely, five star all the way","Arriving by car at the Westbury is a bit trying. It took us several drive rounds before we found the front of the hotel. Once there, they take your car and park it for you. At check-in our room wasn't ready but we were offered an upgrade if we'd wait half an hour. We were happy to accept that. Meanwhile we had tea and scones in their lounge. Everything about the hotel and staff is top class. Our only complaint was the pillows. They were feather and no doubt the best quality but they were so uncomfortable. I ended up using a cushion from the chair to put my head on! I probably could have got the pillows changed if I'd asked. We ate dinner in their restaurant and had the best steak I've ever had! Breakfast on both mornings was excellent. They don't expect you to go to a buffet, they bring it to the table. All in all a lovely hotel.",4,2014,06,08
203,Great location and Fine Staff,"Well if you have the money and want a great location and fine service "" this is the place"". Claudin was so very helpful with info about the city of Dublin. The food was wonderful and the service grand. This was the start to a 14 day tour of Ireland and we could not have started it at a better place. Rooms are fine.",5,2014,06,08
203,Special hotel for a special occasion ,"We stayed here recently to celebrate our engagement. We were warmly welcomed and treated to petit fours in the room. The room, although quite compact, was beautifully decorated and comfortable. I did find that the air conditioning was not so efficient, but that was easily solved by opening the window. We didn't eat in the restaurant but enjoyed a few cocktails in the lounge bar. The location was excellent in one sense,  but it was difficult to find the car park due to one way systems around the city centre. We parked in Stephen's Green and were given a special rate on presentation of our hotel invoice. ",5,2014,06,08
203,Excellent hotel choice,"From the time I arrived until the time I departed I was treated royally. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff of The Westbury (including to trying to retrieve the coat I left on my arriving flight). The accommodations are beautifully furnished and exceptionally comfortable. The hotel is located only a short walk from St. Stephens Green, a large array of restaurants and shopping. Despite the hotel's proximity to shopping and restaurants, the well appointed hotel was quiet allowing for a good night's sleep. This hotel is a great find. I will definitely return to The Westbury!",5,2014,06,07
203,friendly perfection in the heart of Dublin,"if this Hotel was rated on its location alone, then it would get a perfect score every time.  However the perfect score that this hotel is entitled to is not solely because of its location, it is because everything about it is just wonderful.  Very friendly and knowledgeable staff, pleasant rooms, great dining options, a really excellent lounge that serves as perfect space to wait for guests, eat afternoon tea, have an evening drink. 
Special mention must go to the Doormen who can answer any question thrown at them, greet you by name (how do they do that?), offer advice and are generally all round helpful.  
I stayed 5 days and wished it could have been longer!",5,2014,06,07
203,Top notch Hotel,"This is a wonderful hotel in a central location of Dublin. It is right off Grafton Street in the heart of things. The service is attentive and helpful. The room a little small but more then sufficient and so well appointed. The room we were in was a bit warm and we asked the system be checked. They did so promptly and it was more a difference in what we wre used to as all systems were a go. They did offer a different room and/or a fan. We opted for latter rather then move so the warm room issue, while not fully resolved , was manageable. Great bar area to sit and relax with an Irish coffee at end of day.",4,2014,06,05
203,Fantastic hotel in the heart of wonderful Dublin,"We stayed at the Westbury for 2 nights at the beginning of our CIE Emerald Supreme tour.  The Westbury was an ideal place in every way. 
Our room was spacious and exceptionally well furnished.   The king bed was firm yet comfortable. 
Bathroom was large; shower was as good as it gets. 
Breakfast was great; service in the dining room and at the front desk was prompt,  courteous and typically friendly (Irish style).
Location is oerfect- near Grafton Street and numerous fun restaurants.
We give the Westbury an A+ and would be delighted to stay there again,",5,2014,06,04
203,A different class of hotel!,"We stayed at The Westbury for 2 nights as part of our wedding celebrations and I'm so thankful we chose this hotel as it really added to our celebrations. I can't think of a more luxurious and beautiful hotel with professional, thoughtful staff.

Upon check-in we were upgraded to a Suite which was such such an unexpected surprise and boy was the room amazing! Of our entire honeymoon (which also included 5* hotels in America & Mexico) this was the most fabulous room with the most comfortable bed! 

We did breakfast in bed the first morning which at nearly ‚Ç¨30 per head is not cheap but it was lovely to relax in our room and the food was hot, well presented and most importantly tasty. We also indulged in the champagne Afternoon tea which was equally as good. Finally, I don't think I've ever has a good cocktails as I have had in their bar.

Equally as important, we found all the staff to be very friendly which really added a lovely touch to our stay. In particular, Joseph Downing made sure we had a great start to our honeymoon and helped my husband arrange a few extras things to be our room upon arrival.

If you are looking for a top class hotel right bang in the city centre you can not go wrong here. I'm already planning a return stay during the summer!
",5,2014,06,04
203,Classic luxury hotel with every detail thought of,"This is one of those classic luxury hotels, where client service is impeccable (concierge greets you by your name when you call-in to request a wake-up call), every detail in the room is thought of (including video inputs for the TV, a USB plug to charge your phone, a turn-down service, etc.)
The staff is extremely professional and attentive to your preferences, always trying to help and to make you feel comfortable and taken care of.
The rooms are impeccably clean, including the bathrooms, despite the age of the hotel, and everything is extremely well preserved.
The beds are very comfortable and the added amenities of the Doyle Collection are a treat.
Location wise, you can't get any better than this in Dublin.",5,2014,06,03
203,Absolutely wonderful!,"We stayed here for three nights in May 2014 and had a great time.  The hotel is located in the heart of Dublin with Grafton Street right outside of its front door.  The staff is very friendly and the food is to die for.  When we return, we will absolutely stay at the Westbury Hotel.",5,2014,06,03
203,A Dear Green Place on a Saturday,"As most reviewers seem to agree, this hotel is in the perfect situation for a short visit to Dublin. many sporting and other venues are within easy reach, especially with the excellent Dublin public transport system. Our room was 4 1/2 star only because the decor was  a little on the tired side and we felt that the premium additional room charge for a Saturday night (‚Ç¨120) was on the high side and hard to justify. However,that was more than compensated for by the friendliness and efficiency of the staff and the food. Wonderful breakfast and, in the Cafe Novo, possibly the best fish and chips I have ever had!",5,2014,06,02
203,Return after 20 years,"I was pleasantly surprised in my return to The Westbury Hotel after 20 years. The Westbury was always perfectly positioned as a very short walk from restaurant, pub, entertainment, and shopping options but now the options are much more numerous and varied as the area around the hotel as seen significant revitalization. In addition to the great location, the hotel staff know the real meaning of customer service. This classy and safe property is the perfect home-away-from-home in the center of Dublin!",5,2014,05,31
203,Very nice,"Great location in Central Dublin. Very good welcome from doorman and reception staff. All staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful.

Room exceptionally clean and well equipped. Bed comfy and good quality bed linen.

Only had breakfast at hotel both days and continental was great. Lovely granola and good quality pastries. Fancied the full Irish breakfast, but trying to be good at present.

Free wi-fi a bonus as well. Too many top end hotels rip you off on wi-fi, but included here, so nice touch.

Will be in Dublin again in a couple of months and will definitely stay here.",4,2014,05,30
203,Great Dublin Hotel,"The Westbury is a great hotel in Dublin.  Starting with the location, it is near Trinity College, shopping zones and many great old pubs of Dublin, surrounded by restaurants as well.  The condition of the hotel is top notch - good quality bedding and amenities.  Staff all around was top notch - pleasant, helpful and never had to wait for anything.  I would definitely recommend the hotel as a leisure or business property.",5,2014,05,28
203,Wonderful stay,Felt so at home staying here the hotel the food the service could not have been better can't wait to return here for the afternoon tea such good value for money great location also right where I wanted to be ,5,2014,05,28
203,Always superb,"Whenever we're in Dublin, The Westbury is our home away from home. It is consistently top-notch in service, accommodation, food, and location. I've reviewed this property before, and am happy to say it is still #1 on my list of favorite hotels.
Thank you to all the staff - they are professional, always courteous, and very polished. (Good management!)
See you next time we're in Ireland....",5,2014,05,28
203,Superior hotel for business trip,"I stayed here will colleagues for a business trip. We had bed and breakfast accommodation. The staff were very welcoming and friendly. Would highly recommend this hotel given its central location in Dublin, just off Grafton Street.",5,2014,05,28
203,Perfect Location,"I had a 4 night stay at the Westbury.  We were located on the second floor.  The hotel room was squeaky clean.  I'm rather particular about cleanliness, and I have not one complaint; there was an attention to detail with room service that you don't often see.  
The room was quiet too.  Even though it was right on Grafton, and rooms all round we never heard anyone. 
The linens were very comfortable.",4,2014,05,28
203,Amazing Stay in Dublin - Top Notch Service,"Our stay at the Westbury was amazing and I would highly recommend it to anyone! Check in was fast and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. This really means a lot since we were travelling with our 10 months old.

We booked the Westbury hotel through Amex's FHR program, and we were upgraded to a studio suite upon check in. The studio suite was spacious, clean and well decorated. Bathroom was enormous. A couple of the converter outlets did not work and when we informed the front desk, they delivered two brand new plug converters up to our room right away. Everything I requested on the phone was always done right away, I never had to call and remind them. (i.e. baby crib)

Our stay was amazing and I would totally come back, even without booking through Amex's FHR program, I think this is a hotel that's worth the splurge.",5,2014,05,28
203,Next time in Dublin it'll be here!,"This weekend has been in and around our 10th stay and by far the best at The Westbury. We stayed 2 nights, hubby, myself and kids for the obligatory One Direction concert.

The attention to detail had improved greatly. The breakfasts were superb, as were the staff.  One particular staff member Shannon stood out for us, he was friendly, attentive and very good with the children both in the restaurant and the bar. Shannon was pleasant at all times , 5* for him alone.

Yes I would highly recommend, no other 5* around can touch it and yes I will return. Thanks for reading.
",5,2014,05,26
203,Grafton Street location for Great Shopping,"We were looking for a centrally located hotel in Dublin to meet family. The Westbury turned out to be good for that but also great for shopping and getting around. The rooms and bath are spacious. The food at the included breakfast is very good. The services are impeccable. The location is the big thing. The Westbury is tucked in just off Grafton Street, the main shopping Mecca in Dublin. It is also an easy walk to St Stephan's Green and Trinity College. The relatively new LUAS tram line is right next to St Stephan's Green. The Gaiety Theatre is just down Grafton Street. It is an easy walk to Connolly train station. More expensive than most Dublin Hotels, but worth it.",4,2014,05,26
203,Will Definitely be going back,"We were up from Donegal for the night to see the Liverpool play and stayed one night in The Westbury. I always thought the Westbury would be very expensive but my husband said once you added the price of breakfast the Westbury cost the same as other hotels in Dublin City Centre. The entrance was gorgeous and the door man was very friendly, The stairs up to reception and the surrounding area was charming. The staff at reception were delightful. (I always thought that the Westbury was very posh and am ashamed to say that I thought the staff were going to be snotty) They were so easy to have a chat with and not at all snotty or rude. The room was nothing to write home about but was clean and did the job. Breakfast the next morning was lovely. There was a lovely and impressive selection for breakfast. My husband ordered a fry and was made fresh for him!! We were served by a lovely, friendly, funny yet very professional man named Shannon. I need soya milk and find not all hotels supply it so always bring some with me. I was mortidied having to bring it with me but Shannon made me feel so relaxed and made a friendly joke about it. For anyone that does use soya milk The Westbury do have soya milk. So all in all next time we want to treat ourselves we will definitely be returning to The Westbury Hotel.",5,2014,05,26
203,Great apart from the musak,"This is a top hotel and the facilities and service are hard to beat.  It is my usual choice for business trips to Dublin.

On my recent visit the main restaurant was closed and so I dined in the gallery.   The food was very good apart from an overcooked dover sole which went back and was quickly replaced with a different dish.  The service was actually excellent and the waiter could not have been more helpful or attentive.   I did not enjoy the over intrusive musak, however.  It was awful.

I will still go back but will avoid the gallery for dining in future.",4,2014,05,26
203,Room too hot!,I have stayed here about three times now and find the hotel very central for shopping / dining etc.  staff are excellent.  My only problem was the a/c did not cool the room which forced us to open the window.  Noise from outside was horrendous! A disco was in full swing until after 3.00 am and was just outside the hotel. I kept lowering the temp but no luck.  I was treating my mum for her 80th birthday and we had a break weekend except for lack of sleep which was a pity.,3,2014,05,26
203,Allan Blyth,".Excellent hotel and staff from Chris and Mauve in the dinning room to Lukasz,Gerry and Eddie in the concierge and Zaiga and Rachel in reception.
You ask them a question and they assisted you nothing was ever a problem. Food was 1st class,room clean and cleaning staff excellent and the small touch of a sweet on your bed and bed turned down is perfect, will promote this hotel to anybody visiting Dublin. You are able to park your car and visit the city from the hotels vacation. We only used the car when we travelled outwith Dublin. People say you only get what you pay for and this hotel did not disappoint. You should definately have afternoon tea it is fabulous.",5,2014,05,25
203,The top hotel for central Dublin,"Really quite hard to fault.  The staff in the lobby at breakfast service are a bit slow.  The beds are a touch soft for my liking.  That's about it.  The rooms are nicely appointed and a fair size.  The staff at the front door and front desk are exceptional as are the bar staff in the evening.  Ask the concierge for restaurant recommendations; he hasn't steered me wrong yet.  Location wise, this is right off Grafton St, so perfect for business and pleasure.",5,2014,05,24
203,Our annual trip to the Westbury,"My wife and I love a long weekend in Dublin, especially if we stay at the Westbury. From check in until check out and everything in between the staff cannot do enough to make your stay special. Fantastic location, hotel maintained to a good standard. Very clean and comfortable rooms. This was our third stay at the hotel and we will be back soon for a fourth.",5,2014,05,24
203,central charm,Excellent location - as soon as you walk in you feel instantly relaxed and important! beautiful high teas and excellent cocktail bar - ay time of year.  Rooms are good with comfortable pillow and quiet.  Breakfast was excellent in swanky restaurant.,5,2014,05,24
203,Great hotel,"The Westbury is a great hotel in the center of Dublin with a great atmosphere, staff and dining experiences. 
I highly recommend it for your stay whether you are in Dublin on business or pleasure.
staff are friendly, hospitable and knowledgable.",4,2014,05,24
203,Wonderful staff!,"The people that were on staff at the Westbury Hotel were some of the nicest people I have ever met. One particular staff member, Jane O'Conner, helped me even on her lunch break to find my lost purse I had left at an ice-cream shop in Dublin. I would stay there again in a heart beat!",5,2014,05,23
203,Luxury and Location,We really loved our stay at this grand old hotel with a perfect location in the heart of everything you most want to see in Dublin.  The staff was wonderful and our room was very comfortable with every amenity.  We were greeted with warm towels at Reception and it just got better from there.,5,2014,05,23
203,great hotel,"Doyle Collection flagship hotel and did not disappoint. excellent hotel, perfect location, no problems.  This is how a hotel should be run.   I have been very impressed with other hotels in the Doyle collection and this one is the nicest.  The location could not be better. Food, service, and decor beyond expectations. You will not be disappointed. Great hotel!",5,2014,05,23
203,So Glad We Stayed Here!,"Westbury Hotel lived up to all the excellent reviews I read here, including that of david939. The location couldn't be better. The service was so efficient. When the bulb in the bedside reading lamp blew, when the hairdryer was faulty, a replacement was sent within minutes. The staff -- whether in the lounge, dining room, or housekeeping -- were so friendly and helpful. Took an interest in your daily outings and always made you feel at home. Our favorite concierge-cum-doorman, Tomasz, was such a sweetie. Can't think of anything that was not satisfactory. We stayed nine nights. It was home away from home.",5,2014,05,21
203,"Location, Quality, Service...","The hotel is very reasonably priced, service and facilities are excellent, and the hotel's location is excellent - off Grafton st which is a great shopping and bar area. Trinity college is walking distance and Luas (train) is closeby as well. ",5,2014,05,21
203,Afternoon Tea and scones at its best!,"If you care for a civilized cup of tea, second flush Darjeeling for example, to help wash down the scones with clotted cream and jam, this is the place to have it!
Impeccable!
Friendly and knowledgable service throughout.
Always a pleasure to be here!
",5,2014,05,18
203,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed 3 nights. Rooms were small but adequate (after all you are in a big city and space is at a premium) Staff was friendly and helpful, more than happy to assist you. Lobby is beautiful and huge! This is where you can have afternoon tea (starting @ 1:30 PM) or just a sandwich, beverage or dessert. We did the tea which was excellent, the best scones we had in Ireland!. This was during the week, the lobby seems more crowded on weekends. Breakfast was also a treat, the buffet had absolutely everything you could imagine and you can also custom order your breakfast.  But several others complained about slow service. We did have trouble getting the attention of the waiter staff at times. Good location to walk to museums.",5,2014,05,18
203,Best hotel in Dublin,In the centre of Dublin beside grafton street and st Stephens green. 5 min walk to temple bar and the theaters. 5 star in every way. Concierge take your car and look after parking. Luggage left to room. We were upgraded without asking to a exec suite. It was a huge room with 3 Tvs  and the height of luxury. All this without breaking the wallet. Top class,5,2014,05,18
203,Slum it with the famous!,"Afternoon tea in the Westbury is a salubrious affair.
We were ushered to our seats and were promptly brought a ¬†glass of chilled champagne.

It's served in a beautiful plush area. Girls in black dresses and neat figures heap attendance on you. We spotted two famous people, an actor and a politician.

The food comprises of decrusted, delicate sandwiches on white ¬†and brown bread served on a silver platter. 
The way I should be served everyday!

The cake stand was preceded by a melt in the mouth white chocolate mousse served in a small glass bowl.

Now the cake stand was to die for, delicious, delicate cakes and melt in the mouth scones.

It was a lovely,sunny afternoon and the place was full.

Go spoil yourself (50‚Ç¨ approx per person).",5,2014,05,18
203,SUPERB!,I've stayed in many hotels but I must say this was one of my favorites!  Hotel is beautiful with so much attention to detail!  Location is excellent and within walking distance to upscale shopping and restaurants!  We visited during the holidays and the hotel was decorated very elegant with beautiful flower arrangements everywhere!!  LOVED this hotel!,5,2014,05,17
203,"WONDERFUL HOTEL, HAPPY PEOPLE!","We stayed this past week at the Westbury Hotel in Dublin.  The hotel is situated in the center of the busy Dublin streets, with easy access to stores and restaurants right outside the front door.
   The first thing we noticed as we entered the lobby are the magnificent flower arrangements.
The lobby, restaurant and bar areas are beautiful. Everyone is happy and accommodating, and the staff is always smiling.  We knew immediately that we had chosen the best place to stay.
  Our large suite room was delightful and had  a super comfortable bed. . Every morning we received chocolates and every evening we received  turndown service, also with a smile. 
   We met our friends each evening before dinner in the large bar and lounge area. As a non drinker, I asked Shannon, the bar tender, to make me a non- alcoholic drink called an egg cream.
( no eggs involved) . He was more than happy to do so,  and it was delicious. We all had a great laugh about it.
   The concierge service was excellent here, more so than in other 5 star hotels where we have stayed. Nothing we asked for was too small or large for them to accomplish. 
   We would definitely recommend this hotel and would  stay here again, for sure!",5,2014,05,16
203,Very nice stay,"We spent 5 nights here on the first part of our visit to Ireland.  The hotel as others have said is very centrally located, and we walked where ever we wanted to go.  The shopping was impeccable, and there were many pubs and such to choose from.  We enjoyed the quietness of the hotel, which was a surprise to me since it is right in the middle of everything!  The staff was very friendly, and extremely helpful when we had questions where to find certain places.  I would absolutely stay here again if we ever return to Dublin!!",5,2014,05,14
203,Hard to fault for the price,"We stayed here recently for one night before heading to Galway.

The first thing I noticed were the professionalism of the staff. A guy at the door made us feel very welcome and made a joke about the weather, seeing as we'd just been heavily rained on, this was well timed and took the edge off the fact we were dripping wet.

Inside we were offered towels to dry off, and once again a very courteous and traditional 'Irish' welcome from the front desk (guy with strawberry blonde hair, forget his name).

Our bags were brought up to our room and we were informed sincerely we could ask for any advice or assistance whilst in town, we too the up on this offer and they helped plan our evening including table reservations.

The room was modest but the bed super comfortable, they also had free water and WiFi in the room which was a nice touch as many places still insist on charging for both.

I didn't eat at the. Restaurant, though did notice a lot of people taking afternoon tea, looked very nice. The location is spot on, couldn't get more convenient for bars and restaurants or shopping, a nice couple of pubs straight opposite too if you want to try the black stuff.

I'd definitely come back if in Dublin again and would recommend to family and friends. Think we paid around ¬£140 for the night, room only. Decent value versus alternatives.",5,2014,05,14
203,Everything good about Dublin & Ireland at The Westbury,"Ive lived in Dublin all my life and cant believe that I havent stayed in this mecca of opulance and luxury before. I ve stayed in so called 5* Hotels all around the world but none that possesses the sheer elegance, service and utter luxury of the Westbury.
We stayed in a suite for 1 night at the end of April. It was a Sat afternoon and it was lashing rain when we arrived. As we pulled up the 2 door men ran to our car as they opened their umbrellas. They were so friendly and welcoming, we felt like stars. The room was totally equisite with 2 42inch flat screen TVS, very large and comfortable sofas meant that our plan to hit the town was met with some debate as we wrangled over the idea of a night on the tiles or a night of wallowing in this pit of luxury.
Food was excellent, practically on Grafton street but no noise whatsoever from the rooms. We didnt have our young kids with us but noticed how friendly and accomodating all the staff were with the young families most of whom were British & American.
All I can see is that as Dubliners we are so lucky and proud to have this gem in our city. Cant wait to go back. No matter where you are from you'll love the Westbury.",5,2014,05,14
203,short stay in Dublin,"we booked our room through American Express and got a competitive rate with lower stared hotels.   We arrived at noon and they had our room ready.  Our room was fantastic.  Large, clean and very comfortable. Breakfast was included and was really, really good - pastries, yogurt, fresh fruit, ham, cheese, juices, coffee and tea. i ordered eggs a was really pleased.  We had tea one day and it was exceptional.  

The concierge was always helpful and very friendly. In fact we joked that everyone was really sincere and yet very friendly (only found one person in four days in all of Dublin that wasnt super friendly and helpful)  We got a late check out at 2PM.",5,2014,05,13
203,"Amazing staff, beautiful property with a great location.","This was our first time in Dublin and we were so pleased with The Westbury.  The location is prime, you can walk almost anywhere you would want to go.  The property it's self is beaufiful and the staff was impeccable and attent to all our needs.  We were celebrating our 28th wedding anniversary and had a special treat and card delivered to our room which was very much appreciated and yummy.
We ate breakfast in the restaurant only once and it was ok, nothing special but adequate. 
We enjoyed The Westbury so much that on the end of our stay when we returned back to Dublin we cancelled our origianl reservations at a B & B near the airport to stayed our last night in Dublin with The Westbury.  A special thanks to Colum at reception, he was very helpful and pleasant.",5,2014,05,13
203,Top class 5 star hotel,"WESTBURY
Very  nice hotel right in the center of Dublin. If you need to be in the center of Dublin, just a few minute walk from the main attractions there is no better hotel. I cannot find any negatives with this hotel not even if  I try hard. We were in a superior room (that is the standard choice) , it was quite large and big enought with two queen beds, 2 armchairs, a table and a desk with good space around them. Service at reception and in general was perfect and always with a smile. The staying had the feeling of the old English hotel when  there was high detail in small things",5,2014,05,13
203,Great hotel,This is a wonderful hotel with great facilities and staff who are very accommodating. The hotel is very central to Dublins many historical sights and walking is very easy. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff. The rooms are spacious and well equipped. We had a great experience.,5,2014,05,10
203,Top shelf service and unbeatable location,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Westbury for 4 nights.
The staff lire all could not have been more helpful. The hot towels and cold water on arrival after 
10 hours of travel were very welcome. The door staff are a wealth of tips and knowledge.
The room was very clean and wow the turn down service was amazing every night.....a complete room redo.
The downstairs bar is great....nice patio with heaters to watch the sites.
Of course this is all amplified by the location on Grafton Street which means shopping and restaurants are never more than a brief walk.
We look forward to another stay.",5,2014,05,09
203,Experience the best.,from the minute you arrive until you check out you get excellent service. i was given an upgrade on my last visit and the room was perfect. I always try to stay in The Westbury and even though this was a last minute trip they gave me a fabulous room and the entire experience was lovely.,5,2014,05,08
203,Relaxing stay,"One of the best hotels I have stayed in. Room faultless - very comfortable bed and a good nights sleep. Central location, staff are superb. Check out McDaids pub next door, great Guinness. Will come again.",5,2014,05,06
203,Not a 5-star,"Good points: pleasant to the eye, staff service very friendly, fancy coffee maker in room, bath robes and slippers.

Bad points: The thermostat in our room was not functioning properly as the temperature was always on the unpleasantly warm side even when we set the air conditioning at the lowest possible temperature. We had to open windows. Staff gave a polite excuse saying they were not prepared for warm days in Dublin... Also the food at the restaurant's hotel is overpriced.",4,2014,05,06
203,City break,"Fantastic from start to finish. Excellent service, location couldn't be better and quantities superb throughout. Would definitely revisit. Beds lovely and comfortable so a great nights sleep. If you want shopping,  sightseeing and to be in the heart of everything dublin has to offer,  you won't get much better than this.",5,2014,05,06
203,Service is fantastic,"Service was fantastic, booked online and got an email thanking me for booking and asking me what else they could help me with. Room was lovely although could do with a little touch up but not that would put you off. Would def stay again as hotel & staff were excellent only issue would be price of breakfast... Too expensive x
",5,2014,05,05
203,"Excellent, lovely birthday weekend","This hotel is right in the centre of Dublin, however it is amazingly quiet! 

Set just off Grafton Street, this hotel is complete luxury! Went there for my boyfriends 30th birthday and not knowing where to stay, after months of research I came across this gem!

Everything about this hotel is amazing! From the service, to the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, to the extra touches such as bottle of wine and cake platter for a birthday surprise! The rooms are large and airy, and have a modern style and are fitted with high class furniture!

We stayed for 3 nights and wished we were still there! Not a hotel I could afford to stay in every night but for a memorable break, this is the one you need to choose!",5,2014,05,05
203,A Very Pleasant and Convenient Stay in Dublin,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights (Mon & Tues) in a Superior Room (Queen Bed) during April 2014.

‚Ä®‚Ä®LOCATION: ‚Ä®The hotel is very conveniently located just steps away from Grafton Street.  There are numerous sights and shopping/eating establishments within walking distance of the hotel.  If the Grafton area is what you are looking for then this hotel can't be beat.  It is also a relatively short walk away from the Temple Bar area as well.  

Getting to the hotel was easy as we took the Aircoach from Dublin Airport where you can get off at Trinity College and walk the short distance to the hotel.

‚Ä®SERVICE:‚Ä® The level of service at this hotel is excellent.  We were warmly and promptly greeted at the door upon our arrival.  Reception was well staffed, extremely pleasant and efficient. This high level of service was extended to every other staff member that we encountered as well including housekeeping, doorman and porter staff. 

ROOMS:‚Ä® I cannot recall exactly the room number we had but it faced out onto Harry Street and Grafton which was merely steps away.  Street noise was minimal to non-existent.  The room itself was quite clean and well laid out.  The bathroom is small but has everything one would need including strong water pressure.  

‚Ä®DINING:‚Ä® We did not eat at the hotel given the multitude of available restaurants in the area.  However the dining area at the hotel looked expansive and well staffed.  

‚Ä®Overall this is a very, very nice hotel that provides a very high standard of service and is located in a convenient and pleasant area. We would stay here again and recommend it to friends and family.",5,2014,05,05
203,"Great location, great staff","The first thing to say about this hotel is its wonderful location - it‚Äôs right in the centre surrounded by plenty of pubs / restaurants and right off the main shopping high street. Despite this it doesn‚Äôt suffer from surrounding noise or rowdy passer by‚Äôs and actually feels secluded. Wherever you wander to during the day, its easy to pop back and even through the maze of small streets, easy to find.

Upon arriving by taxi from the airport (which at eight in the morning took a good half an hour and ‚Ç¨35) the door man, in true Irish friendly style, took care of the bags and showed us to reception. Interestingly this is on the first floor rather than directly in the doorway but overlooks the lounge / bar area. One of the first things to impress is the modern interior - clean and very tasteful it continues throughout the hotel and gives a modern sophisticated feel which is amazing.

The check in process was fantastic. The staff were super friendly and upon reaching the desk we were offered warm towels to refresh our hands and face - a fantastic touch I‚Äôve never seen elsewhere. Despite arriving over six hours before the official check-in time they promised to rush the room to be ready. After being offered bottles of water we left our bags and went for a wander to get our bearings, only for thirty minutes later to receive a call letting us know the room was ready. We picked up the key and our bags were ready inside waiting.

The room was very clean and everything present which you‚Äôd expect. The bed was very comfortable with wonder soft pillows. A Nespresso coffee machine and every possible toiletry made the room nice and homely. There were a few aspects which became frustrating by the end of our stay - the air conditioning was very ineffective. Located beneath the window in the corner of the room it failed to chill the room even on the lowest setting and its effect was concentrated away from the sleeping area. The TV was also very frustrating - despite having a good choice of channels the picture quality was poor and having to navigate through the clunky slow pointless menu every time you turned it on or changed channels was a pain. And as for the lights‚Ä¶aside from the fact they‚Äôre pretty dim, working out which switches did which lights and the combination they all had to be switched in order to get the bathroom light working‚Ä¶well I‚Äôm not quite sure we had it sussed by the time we checked-out. These were small points though so hardly ruined the experience, and the in-room magazines and complimentary water was a nice touch.

The lounge area on the first floor was a great place to relax during the day and evening. There was an open fire and the large windows overlooked the busy streets below. Service was attentive with a good range of reasonably priced drinks available from the bar. It was never overly busy, but it was while sitting here that it became apparent quite how ‚Äòfamily orientated‚Äô this hotel is. By far a criticism, but there are many more families with young children running around than I‚Äôve experienced in other hotels of this level, so just don‚Äôt expect the corridors to be silently quiet and there to be no atmosphere in the communal areas.

Throughout the hotel there is free wifi and credit where its due, it is one of the best connections I have had in a hotel. Consistently fast and reliable, and no need to navigate through landing pages every day etc. Other hotels could do well to take some lessons from the Westbury here!

The hotel‚Äôs friendly staff are definitely one of its selling points, but there are still a few elements I think which could be ticked to really fulfil the five star criteria in my eyes. During the course of our stay it was clear that more door staff would be welcome. On numerous occasions we saw other guests struggling with bags and frequently no one was around to ask questions etc. It‚Äôs probably not helped by having to go up to the first floor each time, but being a busy hotel makes it feel necessary. Also it was a bit disappointing to see service trolleys continually in the hallway on our floor; not as if they were busy but because that‚Äôs where they are stored. Whenever exiting the lift you could be sure to see them stored to the side rather than hidden away which was a bit of a shame. Also within the room, a small number of fixtures on the wall were loose or ‚Äòwonky‚Äô and the start of ‚Äòmould‚Äô forming around the edge of the bath.

For a visit to Dublin I would recommend this hotel. Small things mean it‚Äôs not quite there as one of the best places I‚Äôve stayed, but its central location, super staff and, for me, beautiful interior make it a great home from home.",4,2014,05,05
203,Great location! Excellent accomodations!,"Unfortunately our stay was so short that we didn't get to utilize all of the great amenities. We arrived to the hotel at 6:30 AM after flying all night from the USA. The staff made sure that our bags were delivered to our room once the room was ready while we were out exploring the sights. We came back from our long day of exploring to find chocolates on our pillows, relaxing music playing in the background and a very comfy bed to rest our weary heads. Unfortunately we had to leave town that next morning but we'll definitely stay at the Westbury on our next trip to Dublin! Highly recommend!",5,2014,05,04
203,Impeccable - in a league of it's own,"This hotel is amazing.  The attention to detail never slips wherever you are in the hotel. This is a grand and impressive place but you feel at home - no stuffiness here just a totally great experience.  What makes this place though is the staff!  Hats off to the HR team at this place - well done.  From the minute you arrive you are welcome and there are no grumpy faces, just unprompted help and friendliness which is hard to find in my opinion.  
My room was huge and had everything you could need.  Breakfast was fabulous - can highly recommend the scrambled egg and the baby mushrooms.  It was a great, stress free start to a busy business day.
The hotel even call before you arrive to confirm arrival time and ask about special requests.  If I was staying for leisure then I would ask for a larger bathroom but travelling alone it was not an issue as had everything in it you could want. So don't take that as a criticism just and observation - rooms are going to vary.
Well Done the team at The Westbury - I shall definitely return.",5,2014,05,04
203,"Location, location","The location is worth staying here along with service.  Front desk staff helpful.  Rooms clean, large & roomy.  Walk to nearby Grafton street easily, under 3 minutes.  Trinity college & Guiness super close.    If driving, tough to get to due to lack of familiarity with Dublin's one-way streets----ask for directions.  
Will return.",4,2014,05,04
203,Very enjoyable,"We had a very enjoyable stay at the Westbury, as always. Breakfast is especially good. A front room  overlooking Grafton Street is nice. The staff are friendly and helpful. We enjoy afternoon tea, however, the price of this is exorbitant, and represents poor value  in comparison to many other 5 star hotels in Ireland, where the quality is at least as good( some offering 'top-ups' when sandwiches etc. are finished ).",4,2014,05,03
203,Very central location!,"I was only in Dublin for about 24 hours in-between stops on a business trip, and I decided to set up base at the Westbury based on other reviews.  The location is very central - just off of Grafton Street and a short to comfortable walk to many other sites: St. Stephen's Green, Trinity College (both ~5 min); St.Patrick's, Dublin Castle (~10 min); Guinness Storehouse (~20 min).  The staff was very welcoming when I arrived, and the concierge handed me a map and helped me plan out a sightseeing route to maximize my time.  I only take one star off because the room was a little worn and not in keeping with the loveliness of the rest of the hotel.  But, that wouldn't discourage me from staying again!  I especially recommend this hotel if you are only in Dublin for a couple of days.",4,2014,05,02
203,Are you having a laugh ?,"As a guest at the Westbury as we speak, after being recommended by a friend to stay here We dragged our luggage in after a long trip with no assistance . That being cleared up by a lovely and helpful Rachel from Guest relations  and after being charged extra to stay in the room we thought we had booked  in the first place , we arrived in our room to find no separate bath tub , but hey, we didn't complain . We were just relieved to have a bed . A cool drink from the mini bar might be nice but hang on the drinks were all room temp ? The fridge must be out of order . Silly us, it's not a refrigerator , it's a cupboard that looks just like a mini bar, is stocked with cola, beer , soft drinks and , wait for it , golf balls not even let alone cold . Warm drinks . You can order ice though as Hazel the harried offered . Movies ? If you can get reception in the first place lucky you , our second night the whole system is down . 5 phone calls to reception later we were informed maybe tomorrow . Well tomorrow we will be gone and had we known the standard was as it it is we would never have stayed . The hotel for us is supposed to be a well deserved and definitely well paid for haven. The Westbury is such a disappointment . And by the way Lindsay thanks for nothing, I actually feel sorry for Hazel.",3,2014,04,30
203,Very comfy night sleep at the Westbury,"Stayed for two nights recently at the Westbury.  Perfectly positioned in the heart of Dublin.  Everything is in walking distance.   The Hotel itself is grand and luxurious.  The staff are friendly and welcoming.  We had some cocktails at the bar and found them to be expensive and served in very small glasses, although the bar Manager did explain, it was a normal measure compacted into small glasses.  We had a very comfortable sleep  and a fabulous Irish breakfast the next morning.  Will definitely be staying here again",4,2014,04,30

203,Not a 5-star hotel!,"We were very disappointed in this hotel, especially as it is part of the GHA program and it has so many good reviews on Tripadvisor. The best part of the hotel is the staff and how they will go out of their way to help. But the hotel room was worn and definitely not a 5-star hotel quality. The light system is extremely confusing with it being difficult to figure out how to turn on just the bathroom light -- when it was by the front door! The glasses and linen were nice but the appliances in the rooms were worn. When I expressed a lack of enthusiasm for the room at check-out, I was told that the hotel is making room by room upgrades and I should have said something sooner so that we could have been given a different room or a free breakfast or something. When we make a reservation at a 5-star hotel, we expect all of the rooms to be of quality standards! We were there for 4 nights and I would have expected to have a high quality room for all of the 4-nights! This hotel was definitely not worth the money that we spent on it and we would not return!",3,2014,04,29
203,Great Stay,"I booked two rooms. One on the hotel website and the other on booked.com. both at he same price. The entire hotel was very impressive hotel in a great section of Dublin. Rooms were spotless. Staff was very helpful and professional. I can't imagine a better hotel

203,Highly recommend this hotel,"The Westbury is a truly spectacular hotel. The hotel itself is set just off Grafton street which makes it excellent for shopping and walking distance to bars and restaurants. 
The rooms are spacious and very cosy, I has two of the best nights sleep there. 
The staff get gold stars from me, they are all friendly, helpful and bent over backwards to make us feel welcome.

I really enjoyed my stay here and will definitely return.

203,Well located and comfortable hotel,"First time here, loved the location right in the middle of everything on Grafton Street near a beautiful St Stephens Green park (1k lap around for jogging). Good quality continental breakfast, beautiful lounge for meetings or just relaxing a bit. Nearby Trinity College, St Patrick's Cathedral and the Church of Mount Carmel where St Valentine's rests are.",4,2014,04,28
203,Easter at Westbury,"From the doormen to the reception staff, concierge, wait staff, The Westbury is hosted by competent, courteous, knowledgeable people with a gentle Irish wit.  The physical plant is impeccably clean, and the location near Grafton Street is near everything.  ",5,2014,04,28
203,Lovely Stay in Dublin,"Our stay at the Westbury was wonderful.  The location and service were exceptional.  The rooms were spacious and very comfortable.

203,Wonderful Westbury!,This was our second visit to the Westbury and we had a fantastic time. The hotel has had much praise but what stood out for me was the housekeeping. On arrival our room was ready (even though we were early) and was always cleaned by the time we got back after breakfast. When the beds were turned down in the evening the room was cleaned again (not just a quick flick!) and we were left delicious chocolates. The Westbury is situated in a great place to explore  Dublin - we really enjoyed our stay.,5,2014,04,26
203,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed at the Westbury over the Easter holidays. As soon as we arrived I knew we had booked a fabulous hotel. The staff at the Westbury make you feel so welcome from you second you arrive. On arrival we received a lovely hot towel for our hands, and check in was hassle free. As we approached our room a lady had arrived to see if we wanted our bed turned down for the evening, she also offered us bottled water and left us chocolates. When we entered our room I was really surprised at how spacious it was. The bathroom was immaculate, with plenty of towels, flannels and toiletries. No shortage of hot water throughout our stay. The room itself was again immaculately clean with tasteful d√©cor. Bathrobes, slippers, nespresso coffee machine and lovely crystal wine and water glasses made the room feel a little more luxurious. On the second evening after being out all day we decided to have a drink at the bar before bed. Again a lovely pleasant member staff took our order, and then returned with nuts and pretzels. Checkout was quick, and we were offered bottled water for our journey home. 

I have been raving about this hotel all week, and cannot wait to return to the Westbury in the future. Excellent hotel, excellent staff and excellent location.",5,2014,04,25
203,Great location! Welcoming and friendly hotel,"We decided on the Westbury because of its location.  We were not disappointed.  The location provides easy access to tour operators, points of interests, pubs and restaurants. And, our stay at the Westbury hotel over four days was exceptional.  It is a 5 star hotel.  Our room was comfortable, clean and quiet.  We enjoyed a delicious breakfast in the Gallery one morning and the last night in Dublin we had dinner in the hotel's caf√©. We were pleasantly surprised both at the high quality of the food and the very attentive server.  We loved Dublin.  And like Dublin all of the staff working at the Westbury were friendly, helpful and very attentive.  We would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,04,25
203,"Excellent stay, stylish and modern hotel conveniently located off Grafton Street","Fantastic experience. It is a Stylish, modern hotel conveniently located off of Grafton Street. Beautifully appointed rooms, we stayed here at the beginning and end of our Easter holiday in Dublin. Lobby is great for tea in the afternoon and quite the jet set scene in the evening. Excellent coffee shop which serves healthy breakfast fare. Great for business and leisure travels. Concierge gives great food and entertainment recommendations. All in all I would stay here again when in Dublin next.",5,2014,04,24
203,Wonderful Westbury,"Cannot fault this hotel.  We had a large room, super-comfortable bed, and the service was excellent.  Right on Grafton Street, you just need to step out and down a short walk to be among all that Grafton Street has to offer, and very close to St Stephens Green.  Plenty of restaurants, cafes and bars to choose from.  Perfect location, wonderful hotel.",5,2014,04,24
203,Sublime hotel in Grafton street,"Were you dreaming of indulging yourself in luxury? Look no further, the Westbury will satisfy all of your wishes!

The staff are all super friendly and helpful, and the breakfast is a feast. Located right in the heart of Dublin! ",5,2014,04,24

203,Fabulous Dublin Vacation,"Stayed at The Westbury Hotel for a week over Easter.  I have been a Tripadvisor user for years, but finally joined as felt I needed to review this hotel!  I have travelled all over and stayed at many nice hotels and resorts and have to say this ranked right near the top!  We travelled with our young adult daughters and had called the concierge (the entire team deserves kudos for all their wonderful recommendations and quick follow ups) months in advance to plan an itinerary.  They recommended Wild Wicklow Tours (awesome reviewed separately) and the rail tour to Cliffs of Moher - highly recommend both!  Every restaurant recommended was wonderful!  My daughters stayed in a standard room and we enjoyed a wonderful suite.  Housekeeping was wonderful, quick and came twice a day.  It was over Easter so a lot of young adults on holiday enjoying the wee hours of Irish hospitality - woke us up a few times, but  we were on holiday, as well, and able to sleep in!  We enjoyed the afternoon tea one day and it was great!  Highly recommend!  Ate at the hotel restaurant and it was wonderful, too!  Front desk and bell staff were quick to help and friendly!  The one and ONLY negative was the fitness facilities - as mentioned in earlier reviews - incredibly small with very outdated equipment.  If you are determined not to miss your regular workouts I recommend knowing before you go that running outside or using the discounted rate at the gym across the street is your better option.  I only used the gym once as was having much too fun enjoying the Irish culture myself!  The location of this hotel cannot be beat!  In the heart of the city and walking distance to many, many attractions, pubs, shops and restaurants!  Wonderful holiday and I would return in a heartbeat if I ever went back to the same place - but, too many other places to visit first!  Thanks Westbury for a fabulous holiday with our family! Cheers!",5,2014,04,23
203,Fab stay in The Westbury Hotel,We have recently returned from a one night stay in The Westbury Hotel in Dublin.  Our experience from start to finish was excellent.  The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.  We stayed on the 6th floor facing out towards Grafton street and towards  St Stephens green.  We had a fabulous room in fact it was a suite.  It lived up to everything I was expecting from a five star hotel. The food was first class and the service also.  We will definitely be returning soon.the location of this hotel is excellent with easy access to all amenities. I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody thinking of visiting Dublin.,5,2014,04,23
203,Everything is perfect. The best smoked salmon in town,"Little to say about this luxury hotel. Everything is close to perfection. Spacious, silent and super-equipped rooms, a tremendously convenient location (on the golden strip Grafton Street, but not in the noise of the street), near St.Stephen's Green and Trinity College. The service is superb: our group did a late check-in coming from Italy and we got a finger-food dinner near the fireplace (at 11 pm which is not so late for Italy, but dead night for Ireland) that was simply delicious and perfect. The breakfast is state-of-the-art and the piece of cake is the fresh, juicy and tasty smoked salmon. Of course when you pay a 4-star price, you get. But not always work like this, these days. So, book with confidence.",4,2014,04,23
203,Excellent hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Almost everything in this hotel is 5 stars: the staff is great, the location ideal, the amenities beautiful, the rooms large and bright, the breakfast fantastic.

203,THE WESTBURY HOTEL WINS for 5 STAR EXEMPLARY SERVICE,"I thought about writing this review for a while but felt compelled to do so after my ""back to back"" stay here and at  5 star  sister hotel in London  last week.  I do love both hotels but the Westbury wins hands down.  The welcome, the friendliness, the ""cannot do enough for you during your stay "" . Every member of staff greeted me with Mrs Cronin  down to the valet parking on arrival . Amazing !!  Our room was spotless , perfect with all requests including  hypo allergenic in place.  I want to stay in a hotel that makes me feel welcome , special , valued and  goes to the trouble of reading my GHA profile .... And they did !!  Joseph , the guest relations manager is out there , concerned about and taking care of HIS guests ~ NOT hidden away in some office.  Rachel McNamara , guest relations assistant manager looked after the booking and stay  at The Westbury hotel . She personally handled everything  in an exemplary  and professional manner. It is wonderful to have a hotel to escape to that is luxurious , centrally located, has amazing cuisine and a service second to none ..... and all that without getting on a plane. A little oasis in Dublin ! Thank you Rachel for taking the time to look after us. You are a gem and it was a truly amazing experience.",5,2014,04,21

203,Great Frist Night in Ireland,"After a lot of research I decided to book The Westbury thanks  to the reviews on TA. I am happy I did. After a long night of flying we arrived at the Westbury. Unfortunately our room was not ready, but that is not the hotels fault at all, since we flew in early. We only waited about 30 min and then were pleasantly surprised with an amazing room upgrade! The room was beautiful, large (separate living room and bedroom) and the bathroom was VERY large  (a separate room for the tub). The bed was very comfortable and the shower was perfect. The location of the hotel is perfect for taking a walk around Dublin to check our some local sights. Just a warning, the workout room is TINY and has pretty old equipment in it, I would suggest just walking/running outside. Lastly, we got VERY lost trying to get to the Westbury from the Dublin Airport, either get a GPS or have VERY good detailed directions to the hotel. Overall the service, the room, and the location could not have been better. This is a perfect place to stay especially after a long day of flying!",4,2014,04,18
203,a truly wonderful hotel experience,"I just returned home after a week long stay at the Westbury in Dublin.  I chose this hotel for two reasons: the location (right off Grafton St); and the excellent reviews it received on this site.  I was visiting Dublin for the first time after many years away and as such had very high hopes for my stay.  I was not disappointed.  My stay at this hotel was one of the highlights of my trip. Everything about this hotel is truly exceptional: the location (as expected); the staff; the beautiful room; the food. I could continue to elaborate but suffice to say this is a true gem.  One example: I met the Guest Relations Manager, Joseph Downing, while asking about a day trip to the riding stables in Brennanstown.  He not only arranged a driver for me, he made sure I had apples for the horses! Thank you Joseph for ensuring that my stay in Dublin was truly memorable.
Ps this may sound silly but Holy Cow the shower in the bathroom was absolutely awesome!!  I wish I could transplant it to my house in Santa Barbara!",5,2014,04,17
203,Exceeded Expectations!!!,"We had an amazing stay- were treated wonderfully.  There was a minor issue with our room and we were upgraded to an amazing suite.  Great for families and couples.  TOP NOTCH Westbury- really!!  Wonderful

203,Mother's day 2014,"For Mother's day this year I decided to treat myself to an overnight break away from my children. The Westbury Hotel is fabulous. My room was large and luxurious and very comfortable, with a great view of the city (Room 602). After a lovely lunch in the bar I headed down Grafton Street for a little bit of shopping. I had every intention of going out to dinner, but as the room was so nice I opted to order room service and enjoy a movie in my comforatable child free surroundings. I slept great the bed was perfect and the next morning I travelled home feeling like I had been away far longer than 24 hours. Who knew you could have a holiday 3 miles from home! I will definitely do it again - maybe for Fathers day!",5,2014,04,16
203,A Disappointing Experience at a Group Function....,"We didn't stay here, but we attended a medium-size group function and were very disappointed with the overall experience.

The Westbury is an impressive place to visit, extremely well-located, comfortably appointed, and so on. We were here for the annual dinner of a professional body which deliberately rotates the location where it brings its members together once a year. Somehow this place didn't work - the pre-dinner cocktails area was extremely narrow and excessively noisy (the old ""hard surfaces"" problem!) and the dinner-tables were too tightly packed, with not even enough space for side-plates.

The food was, putting it mildly, very AVERAGE - let's record that only the ""Lemon Meringue Sundae"" dessert got approving noises at our table, with Starters & Mains being very forgettable. Our Servers were certainly pleasant, but the overall delivery was, being totally fair, SLOW!

Sampling a venue like this through a ""Group Function"" is of course simply taking a ""snapshot"" - the picture that emerged for us on the night was not a good one!",3,2014,04,13
203,"Afternoon Tea - efficient, elegant and relaxing","Travelled to Dublin by train and treated ourselves to afternoon tea in The Westbury. The staff were fabulous and even though it appeared to be booked out the staff did their utmost to accommodate us and we were not disappointed. It was a bit expensive  (‚Ç¨48 each) but that included a glass of champagne and more food than we could ever eat. The staff were fabulous - attentive and efficient. I would highly recommend a visit to this very elegant hotel. It is a long time since we stayed in The Westbury but after our recent afternoon tea experience, we are planning to return very soon.",5,2014,04,13
203,Everything a five star should be,This hotel represents everything a five star hotel stands for. From the moment we arrived they really went out of there way to make our stay memorable. In my opinion this hotel represents Irish hospitality at it's very best ,5,2014,04,13
203,Very likely the best hotel in Dublin,"This is a beautiful hotel but much more importantly, the Westbury understands service and every single member of staff I met was impeccable in manner and courtesy. If only more hotels bothered to train staff in the art of solicitude, then more hotels, like the Westbury, would be A1. I hope, however, with the success of the new (re-staffed) Westbury, prices don't go up and prevent people like me staying again on a budget between 120-150 Euro per night. If prices stay as they are, and great reviews from happy people keep pouring in, the Westbury ought to be full every night of the year and remain a cheerful hotel: with a rare balance of luxury and kindness and an atmosphere fuelled by the contentment of not only the the people who stay there, but the staff too, who are (I noticed) often thanked profusely by guests and much deserved.",5,2014,04,13
203,Couldn't have asked for more!!,"My family recently spent 3 nights at the Westbury. We were treated with the utmost respect and as honored guests. Arriving at 8AM from an overnight flight, we were able to get into our room by 9AM. From the first desk clerk, to the last doorman who helped us with our luggage, they staff if the Westbury was fantastic. The room was clean, spacious, comfortable. Location was fabulous. We walked to nearby restaurants for dinner every night. Would highly recommend this hotel for visitors to Dublin. ",5,2014,04,12
203,Location Location Location,"The Westbury hotel is in a perfect location.  Close to Trinity, the hipster restaurants behind the hotel, central to the best pubs and a short walk from Temple Bar (you have to see once).The rooms are quiet and peacefull to rest up for the busy day you can have working and then checking out the surroundings (historical and other).",5,2014,04,12
203,Beautiful but busy spot,"Lovely hotel. It is in a great location, lovely rooms, great food but it is fairly busy. It suits for a city centre break but don't count on it being relaxing! 
The staff were really nice and very accommodating.",5,2014,04,12
203,Great experience!!,"I hardly ever write reviews but I felt I needed to in this case. I visit Dublin about twice a year because my son is there for 6 years. I usually stay at another hotel but it was full this trip so decided to give the Westbury a try. I was not sorry!! There was a bit of a mix up with the room I booked so they graciously gave me an outstanding room on the 6th floor ( the top floor) for the duration of my week's stay. I did not expect that at all. The customer service in general ( breakfast staff, concierge, cleaning staff) was exceptional. I travel a lot so I have a lot of hotels in my 'repertoire' to compare to. Your hotel is certainly near the very top. Thank you for making my trip memorable!!!",5,2014,04,12
203,Always enjoyable!,"Stayed here on a night away with partner. The hotel is 5* and does not disappoint. The room was well finished, and spotless. It was a birthday celebration so we were treated to an upgrade of front facing room and a birthday desert treat when we returned in the evening! The gallery is fabulous and anyone could sit here all day, enjoying the fine service. The breakfast is 5* in every manner. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for something special.",5,2014,04,12
203,Central location and smart,"I stayed at the Westbury for one night on a recent business trip.  The hotel is smart and has a good ambience - there is nice lounge area on the first floor.  The hotel towel on arrival is a nice touch, and I love the benches in the lifts.  The staff were friendly and helpful (for example, the receptionist spent some time with us explaining the local area on a map).  The central location means it's only a short walk to experience some traditional Dublin nightlife.  The room was OK - the furnishing felt a little dated, but was well-equipped and I slept comfortably.  Overall, a very good stay and no real complaints.  Not great in terms of value for money, but all hotels in Dublin seem expensive.",4,2014,04,10
203,Exceeds Excellence,There are no words to describe how special my stay was at The Westbury.  The staff cannot do enough to assist and always with a welcoming smile.  Location is prime and facilities are excellent. D√©cor A+,5,2014,04,10
203,Right in the heart of it all,Have just come back from a weekend in Dublin - this hotel couldn't have been better located ( just off Grafton St ) or more welcoming. From the moment we checked in they couldn't do enough.  From a hot towel on arrival to a bottle of water when we left.  Looking forward to my next trip to Dublin and staying at the Westbury.,5,2014,04,09
203,Noisiest hotel ever!,"Reception is good and professional with a very pleasant lobby / bar area. Unfortunately the bar serves lacklustre Guinness compared to any bar in the city.
The bedrooms are simple spacious & clean with good amenities. 
The main problem with this hotel is the level of noise both internally and externally, it is incredible....
- 01:00 Lots of noise coming from the bedroom above.
- 02:24 Three taxi parked outside with radios blaring!
- 03:55 Truck unloading to a store opposite.
- 05:15 Street cleaner or trash collector outside.
- 06:12 First of multiple bedroom door banging.
- 06:25 Car horns outside

So, a terrible nights sleep particularly when combined with the poor pillows on the bed. Looking at trip advisors reviews I am struggling to correlate the high level of ""excellent"" ratings with my first experience here! ",2,2014,04,09
203,Great hotel in a great location.,"Have visited many times and I still believe that this is the best value for money hotel in the centre of Dublin.  Location is excellent and there is underground parking.  We were on a B&B package, 2 rooms, and asked that one should overlook the front street as it was my mother-in-laws 85th birthday and they could relax in the room when tired of shopping.   They were given a free upgrade to a junior suite and were given some lovely deserts as a treat for supper. Hotel is very clean and no issues what so ever regarding room, service or food.",5,2014,04,08
203,Fabulous hotel in a great location,"Just returned from a lovely break with my partner at the Westbury. As soon as you walk in, it feels like a special place. Or room was beautifully decorated, quiet & the bed was extremely comfortable. I am taking off a star for the shower which was terrible, a trickle. But other than that it had everything you would expect from a five star hotel.  Loved the Nespresso machine!
Any staff we met were polite & helpful. We did not eat at the hotel so I don't know what the food was like. 
All in all, a lovely, luxurious break away from it all. Would love to go back again. ",4,2014,04,07
203,Is there a better city hotel,"My wife and I stayed for 7 nights in a deluxe room,the hotel is perfectly located in the city centre.
We have stayed at city hotels all over the world, but have yet to find one that beats the Westbury, it has a relaxed charm, with very caring staff ,for which nothing was to much trouble.
The food; breakfast  , and diner were first class, they even arranged a birthday lunch surprise for my wifes sister, who was not staying at the hotel, but lives in Ireland.
We shall be returning on our next trip to Dublin.

203,Fantastic hotel - top honours,"simply faultless service at this hotel - makes for a memorable stay 

the location is fantastic with plenty of bars and restaurants nearby 

the staff - could not do enough and were really friendly 

the rooms are excellent - large and modern warm and silent .... perfect 

breakfast excellent - would love to stay here again some day",5,2014,04,06
203,Good location but expensive. Should be 4 not 5 star,"My wife andI stayed at the Westbury in April. We had often seen the Hotel on our trips to Dubin but had never stayed there. We left our car at the door and it was valet parked, I,m funny about my cars and as it was new I didn't like giving it to a total stranger to park,but I wasn't given an option. We were met at reception by two very friendly staff and given hot towels for our hands.
Our room was average in size for the 4 Star hotels we normally stay at. It was clean. It had a flat screen TV which for the room was quite small, an Nespresso machine but no instructions on how to use it, a safe, minibar, iron and ironing board. The bathroom was average in size but they didn't leave out shower gel with the toiletries( some 4 star hotels even give you toothbrushes). There were bathrobes,but no slippers.there is no pool,spa and only as all gym about the size of two bedrooms.
The hotel prices were excessive, ‚Ç¨29 per person for breakfast and ‚Ç¨20 per night for parking!
This hotel is in a good location and we enjoyed our time there however it's unlikely we will stay there again as you're paying 5 star prices for a good 4 star hotel. There are other hotels nearby offering better value.

203,Couldn't be better,"Have to endorse all the earlier great reviews.  Location was central and convenient.  Staff were all attentive without being intrusive or overbearing.  Room was comfortable, with great amenities.  Restaurants and bars were good, but neighborhood is full of great places to go.  Unreservedly recommended.",5,2014,04,02
203,Above and Beyond,"We stayed at the Westbury for 3 days on March 17-19. Being the bold but naive Americans we are, and being first-time visitors to Dublin, we decided to drive to our hotel from Shannon on St. Patrick's Day. Bad idea. After going in circles for 3 hours because of blocked roads, one way streets and 500,000 merry parade goers, we got within about 3 blocks of the Westbury, parked the car, unloaded our luggage, and trekked through the narrow streets in search of our sanctuary. Upon arriving safely albeit flustered, we checked in and headed straight to the lobby restaurant and bar.

After the hostess seated us and took our drink order we were approached by the manager on duty, Chris Weir. We must of looked out-of-sorts, because he immediately inquired if we needed anything. After explaining the fact we had abandoned our car several blocks away and asking if it would be okay for the night, he laughed politely and said, ""uh, not likely, let's go get it now, it probably won't be there in the morning."" Long story made bearable, Chris helped us find our car and personally drove it throughout the throngs of people and back alleys to a safe spot in the hotel garage. He refused a generous tip, but suggested the best of the dinner menu for that evening. We of course ordered his suggestion and had one of the most amazing meals in all of Ireland during our 10 day stay.

The room was fabulous and the Spa was first class. We explored the city and pubs at length over 3 days, but always looked forward to getting back to the Westbury for afternoon Tea overlooking the town centre. The accommodations, the food and the service were among the best you will find in any world class city. If you are visiting Dublin, you owe it to yourself to stay at the Westbury. And when you go, please say hi to Chris for us.

203,Superb,"The very best part of this hotel is the service and the staff, in particular the concierge, doormen and front desk. Nothing was too much trouble. The service is genuine, staff want to connect with you and most impressively they anticipate your needs. Room was fantastic, food is outstanding and the whole stay was effortless. Claudia, our babysitter was brilliant and even brought a little gift for our little one. You would find it very hard to top this hotel in terms of service, location and over all experience.",5,2014,03,31

203,Great all the way around.,This hotel was absolutely great and you can't beat the location.  We were here over St. Patrick's day and even with the massive crowds on Grafton Street our room was very quiet.  From the doormen to the front desk & concierge the staff could not have been nicer.  Free wi-fi in the rooms was an added bonus.  I hope to make it back here again soon.,5,2014,03,28

203,Clean and convenient,"This hotel is right off of Grafton street in Downtown Dublin. It's centrally located to many restaurants, pubs and shopping. It's within a 10-15 minutes walk to the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) as well as the other rail connector. The rooms were clean and comfortable.  The first room I was in was very loud. It must have been next to the laundry room because I heard water ""swishing"" all night. The front desk accommodated me quickly by finding another room and moving my clothes, luggage and other personal belongings while I was in my business meetings. The customer service was great, the front desk, concierge, and restaurant staff were all very nice and accommodating.",4,2014,03,26
203,A stunning place,"Having spent the week end at the Westbury Hotel In Dublin, i have to say that this is a stunning place.

from the moment we arrived every single member of staff we encountered was very amazing, they remembered us and made sure that everything was perfect.

We had  a beatifull suite on the 6 floors overlooking the front of the hotel, we could see Grafton street from our window.  The room was very spacious, light and confortable, the bathroom was also great, for the tv lover there was one in the bathroom too!!!  Tea facilities and a nespresso machine were also available in the room and I should also say that the interent was free and worked very well.

In the morning we went down for breakfast and even though the hotel was busy we received a very personal service. The buffet had a very good variety of sweet and savoury items and the cooked breakfast was well tasty, the staff was very attentive and looked after us extremely well.  We felt so confortable to be hotel that we found it difficult to go and about!  I would had been happy to sit in the gorgeous armchairs in the lounge and just read the paper with a drink.

overall and amazing staying!",5,2014,03,26

203,URGENT PLEASE SEE BELOW--NO 1 HOTEL,"I live in the Middle East so I am used to 5 star hotels, however, as a frequent world traveller, I have to say that I have NEVER EVER experienced the level of service and customer care that I have experienced and observed during my current stay at this hotel. The attention to guests by all and I MEAN ALL staff at all levels is just AMAZING. If you visited here before and thought it was good YOU MUST VISIT again as it is now even better. I do not have the words to describe to degree to which the service in this hotel has been elevated.... If you stay in this hotel YOU WILL NEVER stay in another hotel again.... BRAVO TO THE NUMBER 1 hotel in Dublin",5,2014,03,26
203,Fantastic Experience!,"This was my first trip to Dublin, and I took an extra day between business meetings in London and Dublin to visit the city.  The hotel location is convenient, and the staff amazing.  I had a wonderful time, and really appreciated all the help and guidance I received on how best to enjoy my day in Dublin.  The hotel also recommended a fabulous restaurant for dinner and secured a last minute reservation for me.  Terrific time and hope to return.",5,2014,03,26
203,Middle of the night calls make for a poor sleep!,"The Westbury is a beautiful hotel, but I left feeling disappointed with my own personal experience. I booked online and asked for a double bed, and when I checked in the receptionist asked me again if I wanted a double or twin beds and I said double. I left my luggage and returned to the room much later that evening to discover it was a twin room, I went back downstairs changed keys and had to drag my luggage to another floor for the room requested. The TV was formatted to the wrong screen size so all of the images were skewed on the screen. This sounds a bit like knit picking I realize! But the main problem was that i received 3 calls during the night with no one at the other end, from 1am-4am. I called reception after the second call and asked for nothing else to be put through and could not leave the phone off the hook because of the dial  tone",2,2014,03,25
203,How can any other hotel compete?,"We booked the Westbury for an away weekend and we both really needed to relax. I must say the standard of service was outstanding. I have stayed in The Park in Kenmare, Parknasilla in Sneem, The Europe in Killarney and had drinks in Adare Manor but the Westbury has beaten them all with the friendliness and ambience. From the most helpful concierge on my arrival, the graceful receptionists and the porters.  We dined in the Novo bar and Marius was totally fantastic.  A credit to Romania! Thanks also to Derek who saw us leave on Sunday and spontaneously offered to keep our bags while we went round town.  Definitely, definitely we/I will bee back and I have also advised a trainee hotel manager (was in another hotel last night) to book and visit the Westbury to see how it's done!!!",5,2014,03,25
203,Brilliant again!,"Lovely stay at Westbury again. My nephews and niece were with me at check in but we're not staying- Thomas included them in the warm hand cloths welcome; all very impressed! Maurice in the Gallery accommodated my last minute request for a space for a family drinks get together
All in all great time as always!

The staff were so helpful and attentive and the hotel itself is just pure luxury and well worth spending an extra few pennies on. The breakfast was outstanding and I will be recommending this hotel to my friends and family for sure. ,5,2014,03,24
203,fantastic anniversary stay,"Just a huge big thanks to all the staff at the Westbury, but in particular Hazel and her colleague at reception, for their warm welcome, and in making  us feel very welcome  and  sorting out a problem cause by last minute.com with the reservation. They more than sorted it out and went above and beyond the call of duty .We had a fantastic stay, and look forward to a return visit.",5,2014,03,24
203,Overnight stay @ The Westbury Dublin,"my husband and i have just come back from an overnight stay at the Westbury, Dublin and it has to be said that after a month of looking forward to this trip at the popular 5 star hotel we were left feeling quite disappointed when faced with reality. Upon arrival we were told our room was not yet ready- despite arriving at 2pm in the day. The lady at reception took my mobile number and suggested we ""walk around"" for a while and when our room became available she would give us a call. We took this opportunity to grab some lunch and browse Grafton Street. However 2.5hours later we still had no phone call from reception informing us of the room availability so we went back to enquire. The new lady at reception provided us with our room keys immediately with no explanation as to why we had not been called as promised. Our room was a lovely space on the 3rd floor , bright and airy , bathroom was a little on the small side but other than that it was very nice. Our frustration quickly began to grow however as after having waited over 3 hours to be given our room key , when we eventually tried to get into our room the electronic key cards did not work- during our stay at the hotel we had to visit reception twice to have these cards reactivated, i believe we were not the only guest who experienced this problem as i saw another couple grapple with their cards trying to gain entry to their room on our floor. As we wanted to enjoy our night in the Capital we quickly tried to brush these errors off and continue to have a nice time. We decided on having a drink in Cafe Novo - when no one came to our table to take an order, my husband approaced the Austrailian waitress and asked for a glass of rose - without even turning round to face him she called from over her shoulder ""we dont do rose by the glass"" and then walked into the kitchen area without so much as a glance in our direction. While i found it strange they didnt offer rose by the glass, we accepted defeat and ordered some Champagne, i was however annoyed to find that half an hour later a lady was sitting at the tables outside having none other than a glass of rose brought to her with lunch!!!!!!!???? Lastly we asked the hotel a month in advance to book us a table at the best indian in the town that they could reccommend, we were assured by Concierge that we had been booked a table at the award winning Jaipur on George Street- which we were- but if this is the best indian in Dublin there is little hope of the rest! To think that the Westbury would send well paying guests to such a dive is unthinkable! the decor was dated and old, my starter was wrong, there was an old radiator lying aimlessly at the bottom of the stairs and we could barely get a waiters attention to order some wine. All in all we were very annoyed with the stay at the Westbury, we had so looked forward to it for a month before our stay and we had heard great things from family and friend who had stayed before. While i am sure our experience was a one off, it was enough to ensure that our next time in Dublin will be spent at The Shelbourne.",3,2014,03,24
203,A very pleasant weekend,"This was an excellent weekend experience with friends.
We were a group of 6 senior adults.
Location - almost perfect
Public Rooms - really spacious and well appointed. Staff here excellent, a very attentive waitress provided tea, while waiting for friends to join us before going into Breakfast.
Rooms - Well appointed, but maybe a little on the small size for a Superior defined room.
Food - only had Breakfasts, but again a very high quality.
Staff - Maybe the best part of the stay, all incredibly friendly and helpful. My wife and I travel the world quite a bit and I would put this team up as one of the best ever encountered.

203,Excellent Service,"From the start to finish our stay was exceptional!
The staff from the door man, to the front desk, to the housekeepers and the restaurant staff were all extremely courteous, professional, genuine and accommodating. 
The location is simply the best as you are right in the center of all the action while being ever so slightly on a side street so you don't hear all the action.
The mattress, linens and pillows are of exceptional quality which enabled us to skip jet leg since we had quality sleep:) The continental breakfast was delicious! Fresh fruit, fresh croissants, a wonderful chees selection, fresh juice, homemade granola with yogurt and the perfect coffee! We were so content and full that we didn't eat lunch:) 
One of the highlights was when we would enter our room to turn down service at the end of a busy tourist day;)  Butlers chocolate on the bed, water on the bedside table and classical music playing added a little fanciness to the day and was the perfect welcome to wind down.  
This is The Place to stay in Dublin!",5,2014,03,23

Didn't get to stay in the hotel unfortunately. Maybe Elaine G and I will next year.",5,2014,03,20
203,St Patrick's Weekend,After the hectic street activities it was great to come back to a warm welcome and a sumptuous bed to fall into to boost your energy levels in readiness for the evening entertainment.  I would highly recommend the Marble Bar to kick start your evening with friendly staff and wonderful cocktails.,5,2014,03,20
203,Birthday weekend,"Had a fantastic weekend at the Westbury treated like royalty It was my birthday on the 17th St Patricks day had a champagne afternoon tea a great time experience LOVELY 
All the staff were great cant wait to go again WELL DONE ALL
A special thank you to the staff at the Nova for making us feel so welcome ",5,2014,03,19
203,Nothing too much trouble,Just got back from 5 days at the Westbury over the St Patrick's Week-end. Everything about the Hotel was First class. My Review will be fairly short as I had NOTHING to complain about only excellent service and accomadation all round. The staff have a freindly style and nothing is too much trouble. they were only too happy to explain anything about the hotel and to offer tips on where to go and how to get there. If you want 5 star treatment then you cannot go wrong . You only had to ask about something or want something doing and  it was done at a level of 110 % Could not speak too highly about this Hotel Thanks for making our trip for my 65th Birthday very special  ,5,2014,03,19
203,Excellent Stay,"Location of the hotel was just perfect, 1 minute from Grafton Street, however nicely tucked away so quiet once inside.  The lounge area on the first floor was beautifully decorated, the staff were welcoming and efficient.  Overall a fantastic place to stay.",5,2014,03,17
203,Pure luxury in an Amazing City!,"We popped in for a drink after a meal in Dublin. And everyone was so lovely & professional, from Colin at the front desk to Darren at the marble bar. 
The marble bar was so exquisite & relaxing. Great atmosphere, exactly what we wanted. 
Hotel is just so beautiful on the inside, I will be back.",5,2014,03,15
203,Spoilt in Dublin,"I was brought here for  my birthday ! What a treat !
Had a fantastic room and really enjoyed the friendly ambience and helpful staff!

The room was amazing and I have never slept so well in a hotel!
Fantastic breakfast the next morning ! Superb
Will definitely be back!",5,2014,03,15
203,They made it special,"I recently stayed in this hotel and I'm glad I returned again , upon checking in the very pleasant receptionist asked was it a special occasion ,, I said actually its my birthday ,, 
Checked into to our bright and nicely decorated room ,, a few minutes later the manger sent up a lovely selection of handmade chocolates on a plate saying happy birthday !! A really nice touch ,, 
Went out for dinner that night and came back and rose petals were on our bed and a bottle of champagne ,, what a lovely surprise ,, staff were so attentive and welcoming ,, especially Joseph who greeted us upon checking in ,, what a nice guy !! 
Thank you to all the staff for making it a special day ,, will return soon,, flowers in reception amazing ,,",5,2014,03,15
203,Wonderful 1st Night in Ireland,"I landed in Dublin's airport at 6am after having flown overnight from the States.  I didn't sleep at all in my tiny coach seat so needless to say I was delirious when I arrived at the Westbury.  I didn't expect for my room to be ready given the early hour but the front desk attendant must have recognized my travel weariness because she offered me another room that was slightly more expensive but available immediately. I took the room and proceeded to take a fantastic power nap on a very comfortable bed for the next two hours.  Between the nap, shower and change of clothes I was a new woman ready to explore beautiful rainy Dublin.  

The room was lovely.  Very simple in design and d√©cor and had a great view of Grafton Street.  The bathroom was nice but on the small side, especially the shower.  Little tricky getting in and out and a little on the narrow side but I managed.  

The concierge had great recommendations for things to see and do and he found me great little spots to have lunch and dinner that were walking distance from the hotel.  

The best part about this hotel is the location.  You're right in the heart of everything.  Just steps outside front door is the best shopping Dublin has to offer.  Most of the popular sights are easily walkable in 15 minutes or less.  

Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and accommodating.   I would definitely recommend this hotel if you find yourself in Dublin and are looking for a solid 4 star stay.",4,2014,03,14
203,In Dublins Fair City,"We have just  had the Best Hotel Experience Ever, The Westbury has always been on our Bucket List of Dublin Hotels,and it lived up to our dreams.  From the moment we made our reservation we always felt we would be looked after, and we were.
The accommodation was first class! the staff Genuine and so Helpful from the reception staff, the porters, always giving you tips on where to eat and drink. The service and quality of the food at breakfast was second to none. It was my husbands birthday and this was mentioned at booking and the staff organised a sweet little surprise for him, so toughful and it made his day.
Can Not Wait to go back, on the doorstop of everything, why can't every Friday be a Westbury Friday, Hope to see you all again very soon.",5,2014,03,14
203,Don't Arrive Early,"My wife and I arrived at 10:15AM after a transatlantic trip to Dublin. I requested a room as early as possible so we could get some sleep. My room wasn't ready until 2:45PM. With nowhere to sit in the lobby, we were left to wander about the lobby like transients. To make matters, we watched as another handful of guests were checked into their rooms without delay. I spoke with the night manager about the poor welcoming we received and was told to speak with guest relations in the morning. Seems a bit odd I have to speak with guest relations...aren't all hotel employees part of guest relations. The room was nice and the location is great but the service and complete lack of empathy was horrendous. If you plan on arriving early, don't expect anyone to assist you in any manner that will require more work than in minimally required. Next time, I will just sleep in my car in the parking lot. The Westbury Hotel in Dublin has the worst customer service. I would have stayed at the Westin like I had on my prior trip but it was completely booked. Skip the Westbury and stay at the Westin.",1,2014,03,14
203,"Great location, great staff, great food",We had the pleasure of staying at the Westbury on Valentine's night  and we had a great time. The room was lovely (we had upgraded on arrival) and we found all the staff to be very helpful and friendly. We ate in the hotel restaurant and the food was excellent but it was the entire dining experience including the excellent service that made our stay all the more enjoyable. The hotel is in a great location.,5,2014,03,13
203,Best 5 Star in Town!,First stay in a few years at The Westbury was so enjoyable. Reception staff so slick. Concierge Eddie was so helpful. Afternoon tea is best in the the country. Service and food impeccable. Staff uniforms so smart. Breakfast is a real wow. Continental buffet has everything and A La Carte hot breakfast refreshing to see. Bedroom was superb. Great Bath and quiet nights sleep even though you are in the centre of town. Thank you and see you again soon.,5,2014,03,13
203,What a wonderful stay,"We arrived in Dublin last month and had a wonderful time in The Westbury Hotel in Dublin.
The room was spacious and ultra luxurious with everything a lady could wish for! 
My friend was on a healthy diet and we had mentioned this and the mini bar temptation to one of the managers. When we got back to our room a gorgeous fruit hamper was awaiting us. We felt truly spoiled and looked after throughout our stay.
The service and staff were warm and friendly and highly efficient.
This was one of the best times either of us have ever experienced - highly recommend it. ",5,2014,03,11
203,Amazing,May i just say how wonderful.the Westbury hotel is. I had the opportunity of staying for 2 nights last weekend and as a solo lady traveller i just couldnt fault this fabulous hotel. From the minute i landed i was treated so well and i never felt uncomfortable or awkard and to say i was given top class service is an under statement the service was just amazing. Thomas on reception was just so nice and so helpful and the conceriege was just a dream and as for the service i received on their terrace well it was pure amazing. My breakfast in the restaurant on both days was excellant and the waiter was just superb he couldnt do enough for me so if anybody has read negitive reviews about this amazing hotel just ignore them as i have travelled all over the world and the Westbury is definitely a five star plus hotel and the staff couldnt do enough....it was so good i am returning this week with my sister in law...i just cant wait...well done to the fabulous Westbury.Ger Kearney,5,2014,03,11
203,Wonderful stay at the Westbury in Dublin,"This hotel could not be in a better location right in the heart of the City with lots of shops, bars & restaurants on the doorstep.  This is a very comfortable hotel with a great restaurant (Wilde's) and very pleasant attentive staff.",5,2014,03,11
203,"My birthday treat, wow","I booked at short notice The Westbury, Dublin.
We arrived very early in the morning and was greeted by a lovely reception lady Hazel. 
This young lady was so professional and personable.
The location is perfect for anything in Dublin 
First class, don't stay anywhere else.",5,2014,03,09
203,A bit sloppy,"Hotels of this standard, five star, and this price need to make sure that they deliver an exceptional experience and The Westbury seems to me to need a firm hand. 

The outside of the building is not that prepossessing but the staff welcome at the door and reception desk was both warm and professional. The inside is lovely with a bright, atmospheric lounge and a more intimate restaurant; it is also apparently one of only two hotels in the Republic that is no smoking throughout. The groundfloor bistro is quirky and chic with attentive staff as well as good food. The bedroom (we were charmed into paying for an upgrade by the receptionist) was massive and well decorated. The buts started in the room: the coffee machine did not work, there were no biscuits and no fresh milk and we had arrived late in the evening and did not want the fuss of complaining; the room was also unbelievably hot and I am someone who is always cold.

Breakfast was deeply disappointing. We received a very off hand greeting from the girl on front of house that would receive a rapid reprimand from Michel Roux were she part of his Service tv show, were then despatched to a table in a dark corner in the back, surrounded by the detritus of other people's uncleared breakfasts and had to semaphore for a waiter. A couple who arrived after us were taken to a nice bright table near the window and served straight away. The buffet contained an array of tempting offerings but toast arrived burst and the presence of uncleared tables all around was a very effective diet aid; we did not linger.

The Westbury emailed to ask what I thought of my stay and I emailed them telling them; I received back a cursory email saying they regretted not meeting my expectations and hoped I would not be deterred from staying there in the future; guess again!",3,2014,03,09
203,The best hotel we've stayed in,"The Westbury hotel was a delight to stay in. Accommodation and facilities were excellent - supported by fantastic service right from arrival by the staff, most notably Colum at checkin, Ashley the concierge and Jo in the gallery. We found Colum extremely helpful on arrival, Ashely was always on-hand and extremely helpful and Jo provided fantastic service for our very enjoyable afternoon tea. All in all a fantastic hotel, in a great location with some of the friendliest staff.",5,2014,03,09
203,Afternoon tea,A brilliant place to sit back and unwind after an afternoon in the city. This hidden gem just off Grafton Street in the heart of Dublin City offers an unforgettable experience if you are staying or just dining. A professional (most of the time) staff serve to precision. Elegance is key here.,4,2014,03,09
203,Great location and very good hotel,Overall a really great stay at The Westbury. The location is fantastic and means you are in the centre of it all. Facilities and services were all very good. A few little grumbles e.g. eggs at breakfast weren't soft and at ‚Ç¨25 you would expect them to be but nothing that would prevent me from staying again if we visited Dublin or recommending it. Overall a very good hotel and an enjoyable stay.,4,2014,03,09
203,Excellent all round experience,"After ten years of visiting the westbury the hotel continues to offer an efficient welcoming comfortable experience in a superb location for the centre of Dublin . Friendly staff and a great lounge to relax in after business meetings, particularly as a woman travelling on her own. Room sizes are generous and consistent unlike some competitor hotels. Food high quality. ",5,2014,03,09
203,Disappointed- location saving grace,"Service- excellent but the waiter Juan [---] let the over all standard of service down at breakfast.
Breakfast- nicely presented limited standard choice. Toast arrived burnt and with out butter about 10 mins before cooked breakfast. Eggs Benedict was not edible. Ordered two coffee got one tea and one coffee.
Biggest let down was the very very DIRTY HIGHCHAIR. When I asked for another I was told that was all they had which leads me to believe that they were all as dirty as each other. I could not put my child in it.
Room- although clean I found a little dated and basic. Problem with sound on T.V. Asked for mini bar to be emptied for the storage of medication, the fridge was emptied but was warm and therefore useless. A small portable one was provided and was not fit for purpose. Relied on ice packs to ensure safe and stable storage.
Overall service good. Bed comfortable but small. Carpet clean. Great location for shopping.",4,2014,03,08
203,Great hotel in the right location,"The Westbury Hotel is conveniently located in downtown Dublin just off Grafton Street. If you look on Bing or Google Maps, note that they don‚Äôt have it in the correct location. It is indeed off of Grafton and not on Grafton Street. You can find it tucked into the corner of Balff and Harry Streets.

The Westbury is an upper end hotel in a fantastic location with great amenities. I stayed for a week on business in a room with a single king size bed. The room had heat and A/C, a flat screen TV with movie options, a decent size desk, small table with two chairs, minibar, tea kettle, coffee maker, selection of teas and coffees, full size bathtub with shower and heated towel rack. Other amenities included:

‚Ä¢	Hair dryer and makeup mirror
‚Ä¢	Shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and body wash
‚Ä¢	Robes and slippers
‚Ä¢	Iron and board 
‚Ä¢	Shoe shine and sewing repair kit

The room was very clean and fairly quiet with noise from other guests coming from the hall almost non-existent. My colleague, who had a same class of room, and I both had the same impression about the mattresses. It was comfortable enough but had a significant divot on one side from previous guests and probably should be replaced. 

There was access to free (and fast) wifi as well as ports where you could plug in if you wanted to use a Cat5 connection. The room also had UK plug formats but there was one US plug format near the desk. Better to bring a plug adapter.

The hotel has a large lobby where you could dine or just sit and have a drink. They also have a restaurant this is open daily for breakfast seating and only open for dinner seating on the weekend. Service at the hotel was exceptional. I was asked by several people upon checkin if I needed help with my bags and they checkin process was very efficient. At checkin, I was also given the option of getting a choice of two newspapers delivered to the room daily. Nice touch! I did have a small issue with the lock on my door. They didn‚Äôt manage to get it fully fixed during my visit but it wasn‚Äôt for lack of trying. I also had an issue with an odd buzzing sound coming from a panel in the ceiling. It happened occasionally and once again they tried to get it fixed and although it was better by the time I left, it never did get fully resolved.

We had breakfast daily in the hotel restaurant and the menu offered a good mix of items. The continental breakfast was exceptional and the a la carte options were excellent.

The location really can‚Äôt be beat. Lots of shopping and restaurants and pubs of all kind on Grafton Street and in the area. A 5 minute walk up Grafton brings you to St. Stephen‚Äôs Green, a large park. Also beside the park is the start of one of the LUAS tram lines. A 15 minute walk the other direction takes you to the shores of the Liffey, Temple Bar area and another LUAS line.

Business will bring me back to Dublin several more times and I am looking forward to my next 
stay.",4,2014,03,08
203,Afternoon Tea,"We booked in for a lovely high tea after shopping. All the members off staff where very helpful and friendly especially Colm and Valentino. We had a great view onto Grafton street in a  beautiful relaxed seating area,we enjoyed every asplex of the food from the sandwiches to the sweet treats, it was a lovely end to great day, can't wait to go back !!",5,2014,03,08
203,Really nice experience,My boyfriend recently surprised me with a weekend to Dublin and a stay in the Westbury. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a comfortable classy weekend away! Right in the centre of everything! We were greeted by the lovely Rachel who was so helpful and friendly. She recommended the most scrumptious  tapas restaurant!! Our room was fab! So plush and clean! Will definitely be back again!!,5,2014,03,08
203,Very nice,"Great location,great comfort,if I had one thing to say it would be that the bar staff were very stand offish and reluctant to accommodate your needs as the night got young.(around 11.15).otherwise great hotel and would return again",5,2014,03,07
203,High ambition hotel with weaknesses,"I stayed there for one night for business. Room was really nice and staff was friendly. 

However, I was a bit dissatisfied because: Toilet flush was not working, lights difficult to switch off (main switch does not operate all lights, other switches difficult to find), Nespresso coffee machine was not working properly and TV set had big pixel errors (square shaped, 1x1 cm). I'd say, the hotel's high ambition was not fully met in my case.

My colleagues reported they were satisfied with their rooms.",3,2014,03,07
203,Luxury in the middle of Dublin,Great experience at the Westbury. From the moment we checked in the staff made us feel welcome and whatever we needed they got for us. The rooms were well-appointed but not gigantic for a standard queen-sized bed. You're not going to get scenic views of Ireland but the fact that you're right next to Grafton street is worth the price of admission. There are plenty of shops/restaurants nearby.,5,2014,03,06
203,Lovely hotel,"A beautiful hotel and a great location. The fitness center was a bit small and the equipment was half broken, not what I expected from a luxury hotel. Other than that it was a great stay. Breakfast was very tasty and the afternoon tea looked very relaxing in a beautiful seating area.",5,2014,03,06
203,High tea ,"We booked in for a lovely high tea after a lovely day shopping. Colm in reception was very welcoming and the food was outstanding. All the members off staff where very helpful and friendly and it was a lovely end to great day, can't wait to go back !!  ",5,2014,03,06
203,Beautiful Hotel within an Amazing City,"My girlfriend and I were in Dublin for the weekend, although we didn‚Äôt stay at the Westbury we wish we did. We came into the westbury hotel after I proposed to her. We decided to treat ourselves to a bit of luxury. 
The hotel was just so beautiful and relaxing. My evening was perfect, as were the staff members. Colm at the desk who brought us to the bar was so welcoming and professional. Then Darren at the bar was just a delight, so friendly. The bar is such a wonderful & soothing place for what we needed. We will most defiantly return for a minimoon.",5,2014,03,06
203,Two things distinguish this five star hotel from other Dublin hotels.,"I stayed at the fabulously located Westbury recently, and it has all of the luxuries one associates with a 5 star in Dublin, e.g., beautiful lobby, sumptuous and very clean rooms in restful colours, exceedingly comfortable beds, nespresso machine in room, giant bath sheets, nice toiletries and valet parking.  The two things that stood out for me, however, were the staff and the breakfast.  I had the breakfast sent to the room, and the sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs and pastries were absolutely first class. This should be a given, of course, but hotels rarely deliver when it comes to breakfast.  The staff were personable, smartly dressed, helpful and attentive, without that rather annoying, √ºber-formal, ""hotel"" attitude.  Loved the staff, I will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,03,05
203,Great location in a lovely city,"We stayed at the Westbury to celebrate our recent engagement.  Upon arrival we were greeted with a friendly smile and quickly checked into our room (610).  The room was well appointed although a little smaller than we would have hoped.  The Westbury is in a fantastic location and this really helped getting around the City.  I had made contact with the hotel to let them know of our engagement, to which I received a note back to say they would try and do something special to mark the occasion.  Regrettably, and despite emailing the hotel during the stay nothing materialised.  We took breakfast on two occasions, once in the Wilde restaurant and again in our room.  The breakfast was very nice and the staff were very attentive whilst in the restaurant.  On Saturday evening before venturing into the city we took the chance to have a couple of cocktails in the Marble bar.  The atmosphere was great and the staff were really helpful in choosing a lovely cocktail.  Service was excellent.  On our final day we had a small issue with the shower in our room and no water for about a minute.  Upon checking out we decided to point out the minor hiccups we had during the stay.  The receptionist then introduced us to Joseph.  I have to say that I appreciate that some times things go wrong but I judge on how these things are rectified.  Joseph was attentive and showed genuine concern for not achieving the high standards that they like to give.  We were made to feel valued and listened to.  Joseph resolved our problems in a very professional manner.  In short an excellent hotel ideally situated with a really passion for getting it right for the customer.  I would definitely stay at the Westbury again. ",4,2014,03,03
203,Excellent hotel that deserves it's high ratings,"When in Ireland, I frequently stay at The Westbury, and I am always happy with it. Service is great and very friendly, rooms are nice and modern, and beds are comfortable. A really nice hotel that I recommend.",5,2014,03,02
203,Afternoon Tea,"My sister and I enjoyed an afternoon tea here and both pretty much shared the same opinion on everything.¬† First impressions were mixed.¬† We were delighted to get a window seat overlooking the bustling Grafton Street and the whole setting met our expectations but we were very disappointed to see that the cups and saucers were plain white cups like you'd get in any coffee shop.¬† We assumed fine china would be a basic part of an afternoon tea.¬† I know it sounds petty but it actually took from the whole experience and it's something so easy to rectify.¬† Once we got over this annoyance, we chose the breakfast tea and the full selection of choice of sandwiches, scones and pastries.¬† I have to say, as sandwiches and scones go, these were gorgeous.¬† However, we both felt the sandwiches might have been made with a while, with slightly hard edges and the egg had seeped through to the outside of the sandwich in parts.¬† We both absolutely loved the scones, they were our favourite part.¬† We weren't totally gone on all the sweet treats but that was mainly down to personal taste.¬† The tea was fabulous also, as were the staff.¬† They were professional yet really friendly and down to earth.¬† We really enjoyed the experience and never felt rushed.¬† We were there for about two hours on a busy Saturday but felt totally relaxed and pampered when leaving.¬† The final issue is the price, it's more expensive than its competition but because of the few (easily rectified) disappointments, we felt it was overpriced.¬† This may be why it had availability when we rang when two of its competitors had none.",4,2014,03,02
203,Great hotel!,"We had a great weekend in this hotel, clean and modern! very polite and helpful staff! Breakfast was lovely, a good selection of foods! Central location which we wanted and within walking distance to most attractions! Would recommend and stay again! ",5,2014,03,02
203,A little bit of heaven!,"It was actually August 2010 when we stayed at the westbury for almost a week to celebrate our engagement! It was the most gorgeous hotel in a super location! We are going back this April with our new little baby and I just cannot wait!!! There is just something so special about this hotel and its location.. You won't be disappointed, book without hesitation :) ",5,2014,03,02
203,Fabulous City Hotel,"We arrived very tired late at night after a long road journey. The Staff were wonderful. The Manager was in reception and we were too late to order food off the lounge menu so he arranged for the Waiter to bring the room service menu to us. We ate in the lounge with a nice bottle of wine. The bedroom was very comfortable with an espresso coffee machine, we had never used one before, it was very good, we even ordered one when we got home. The reception staff, the waiters and the porters were exceptional. The Porter parked the car in the car park and returned it to us when needed. It is so close to all Grafton Street shops and St Stephens Green. Highly recommended even bottles of water for journey when we left.",5,2014,03,02
203,The westbury,"Great rooms, helpful staff and lovely afternoon tea. This hotel is situated on Grafton Street and close to St Stephens Green so it is very easy to find. Lovely hotel with a feeling of luxury throughout.",5,2014,03,01
203,The best!,"From the moment we arrived we knew we were in safe hands. The greeting by the doorman was warm and friendly. He helped us with our luggage to Reception, chatting all the way. Thomas checked us in very smoothly again with a very warm welcome. The warm towels were an added bonus. We then met Joseph, Guest Relations Manager who showed us to our room. Have to say Joseph is the face of The Westbury and made our stay very memorable. He soon found out our 4 night stay was to relax and find good old fashioned local pubs. He produced daily lists for us of different pubs to try. Each were fantastic and served the 'good pint' we were after!  He even managed to get us a table for Afternoon Tea and left a note in our room that the reservation was made. 

Afternoon Tea, breakfast and of course the cocktails at the bar were all first class. Service in all these areas was also faultless. The bartenders make a mean espressos martini! 

This was our 6th visit to Dublin, but our first to The Westbury. Have to say we have finally found our Dublin hotel. Can't fault the location either! 

Perfection.",5,2014,02,28
203,Looking forward to our next visit!,"Our trip to Dublin was made all the more beautiful and special because of our wonderful accommodation and exceptional service. Our bedroom was well appointed and had a good sized bathroom. 

Joseph, the PR manager, along with the rest of the staff, provided excellent, warm service and great travel advice.

Highly recommended! 

Vijay and J√∂rn. 

",5,2014,02,28
203,5 star service all round,"Myself an three of my friends stayed in the Westbury for two nights at the beginning of February. We experienced 5 star treatment throughout our stay in the hotel. We arrived on a busy Friday evening, the streets were full of excitement due to the upcoming rugby match. The location was perfect we were moments away from all the best shops and restaurants, which allowed us to soak up the amazing atmosphere on Grafton Street. The rooms were extremely relaxing and once you closed the door you could switch off from the hustle and bustle of the streets, with absolutely no noise from outside. The staff were extremely helpful throughout our stay and nothing was too much to ask for.    We decided to have afternoon tea after a long day of shopping, I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of afternoon tea. The only complaint I have is the simple fact that I couldn't have stayed longer. I am already looking forward to my next visit to the Westbury.",5,2014,02,27
203,Excellent,Just back from 4 nights in The Westbury Hotel. Could not fault a thing about the hotel or staff. The suite was spacious and very clean.  I also like  the fact the the hotel does not charge for the use of wi-fi as other 5 star hotels in Dublin do. We did not get a chance to eat in the restaurant but did have some bar snacks which were excellent. We will be back!,5,2014,02,26
203,TOP CLASS HOTEL,"This is a top class hotel right in the centre of Dublin, superb staff who make you feel very welcome and valued. You have to pay a premium for this service but I think it is worth it. Will stay again.",5,2014,02,25
203,Home from Home 3 ( kindness),"As a regular client of the Westbury this time my stay was  just to put my head down in the evenings. My son was having surgery so coming back late in the evening the staff could not do enough for me weather it was room service or just a friendly chat after coming in from spending a long day at the hospital. Each morning they filled a small bag filled with yummy cakes for the kids in the hospital , how many people can say that about a 5 star hotel. This is way it will always be ""My Home from Home"" the above says it all. This is my 3rd review over a 3 year period the other 2 reflect on the hotel amenities but I think it's very important to see this side as it shows what a caring and very taugtful staff they have, my son has round 2 surgery soon and with no dough the kids in Crumlin will look forward to the yummies from the super kind staff at the Westbury.  From my son and myself thank you.",5,2014,02,24
203,Poor start but handled well,"We had a really disappointing start to our stay in the hotel as we had organised an early midday check-in but when we arrived at 2pm our room wasn't ready. We said that we would go and have some lunch while we waited for a call to let us know the room was ready. They were also aware that we were going out for dinner at 6:30pm as their concierge had booked this for us. We returned at 4pm to be told that our room was now ready even though they never called to let us know. Upon check-in we were presented with a gift voucher for a complimentary dinner or lunch during our 1 night stay. They already knew we were going out for dinner but had failed to let us know of the availability of this lunch voucher before we went and paid for lunch elsewhere. I was annoyed at this and after speaking to one of the managers they did their best to get us a different gift of equal value. A business can always be judged on how well they handle mistakes/confrontation, and I can safely say that the Westbury did a brilliant job at this. The room was lovely, although I don't really like the large soft pillows on the bed as I find they offer no support (that's a personal preference though). The general vibe of the hotel is brilliant. Staff are friendly and incredibly helpful. The breakfast was one of the best I have had for a long time, and the location is fantastic for exploring Dublin. Will definitely return and after speaking to the manager have been assured that all the small details will be looked after",4,2014,02,23
203,Brilliant,Stayed for 2 nights as part of my partners birthday celebrstions. Hazel checked us in and was more than friendly. The room was beautiful and very clean and spacious. Dana turned down the room each evening and was very nice to chat to. Breakfast was really delicious. Thank you Shannon for excellent 5 star service. I liked the fact that the restaurant manager Chris was clearing and resetting tables. He seemed very relaxed with the restaurant team. On checkout Colum was very friendly. We were sad to leave The Westbury. We had a brilliant stay and loved it very much,5,2014,02,23
203,Excellent Stay,"The staff was very kind and polite. The room was incredibly comfortable, especially the bed- I wanted to bring that home! The location was great, we walked to a lot of the big sights. It was also a convenient surprise that there were American plugs in the room. I do wish there would have been some meals included, but the teas and coffees provided in the room helped.",5,2014,02,22
203,"Very good Hotel, great location","The Westbury Hotel is perfectly situated in the center of Dublin. 
The hotel is very nice and the service is great. Breakfast is a bit pricy for European standards but fresh  and lots of variety. The rooms are very nice and comfortable just the beds are too soft for my taste. There are plugs for all standards, US, Europe and of course local. 
I'll come here again.  ",5,2014,02,22
203,Location ! Location ! Magical Experience,"I  had a romantic Valentine's weekend here with my husband last week and it was an amazing hotel in a fabulous location - right on Grafton St ,so handy for popping to  shops or eating out etc.
Staff make everything seem effortless and so welcoming and attentive without being over intrusive. Just right! Room was spotless, peaceful and so comfortable.Lovely chocolate treats and water delivered each night and coffee machine in room was so nice.Bathroom was a bit small and dated but perfectly clean and functional.
Only small gripe was breakfast was just too expensive to justify so we sampled breakfasts in many other nearby locations- (we like value for money!!) Prices otherwise(drinks/dinner etc are perfectly fine and in line with expectations for any 5 star hotel-well worth it for the comfort , luxury and location. Its an ideal romantic break or luxurious treat  for shopping with the girls location. Well done all! Keep up the good work!We'll be back soon!

Oh and one other tiny thing! My husband says please change the lobby music before we do come back ! It is not at all relaxing!",5,2014,02,21
203,"Excellent Location, Beautiful Rooms, and Friendly Front Desk....","January 2014 - The Westbury is definitely the place to stay in Dublin, centrally located, within steps of Trinity College and the main shopping area (Grafton Street).  The rooms were beautifully appointed and the front desk staff was amazing, constantly offering us water to take on our journeys and answering any and all questions we may have had.  I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to everyone.  The only complaint I have would be their wait staff in, The Gallery; not very pleasant nor accommodating.  Afternoon Tea was a big disappointment.",5,2014,02,19
203,"""A beautiful, tranquil and elegant hotel complimented by genuine and faultless staff - a real gem in the heart of Dublin""","""Stayed here with my boyfriend over Valentine's weekend & honestly can't speak highly enough of the hotel and in particular the staff. From the friendly welcome upon checking-in, to the fabulous room complete with hand-made Irish chocolates, to the sumptuous 3 course dinner & a breakfast feast fit for a queen the following morning. While the hotel itself is beautiful, the staff really are the crown jewel here - Daniel, the restaurant manager when we had dinner - couldn't do enough for us and was fantastic when I informed him that I'm both gluten free and lactose intolerant. I had my choice of courses & they worked around me throughout the meal. The finishing touch was the chocolate covered strawberries after dessert - which were dipped in gluten free chocolate so I could have them as well. Would highly recommend a stay here and will definitely be going back.",5,2014,02,16
203,Good experience,"Really enjoyed our stay here! Hotel is very plush. The rooms are very comfortable and beds are amazing, decor is very tasteful but the rooms are a bit on the small size! Breakfast was fantastic a huge selection and we'll presented! Staff very friendly",4,2014,02,16
203,"Excellent staff, location and service....","I recently stayed in The Westbury for a romantic one night stay(valentines treat) & from the moment we arrived , we were treated to the kind of service you expect from such a highly rated hotel. From the helpful doorman to the very efficent receptionist , we hadn't book a meal and the receptionist pulled a few strings and got us a last minute reservation in the brilliant Fade Street Social.From start to finish the staff couldn't do enough for us . The room was spotless and decorated to an extremely high standard & the in room Nespresso machine, meant tasty coffee on hand anytime. After our meal we came back to the hotel and had a few cocktails in the main foyer , the mojitos were particularly good , maybe to good.......... but the huge breakfast we had the next morning helped with any sore heads from the night before. My wife had the pancakes and I had a full Irish breakfast along with some scones and jam , this is how breakfast should be , plenty of choice and everything had a unique little twist , we were served by Shannon ( a very helpful and efficient waiter ) he had everything under control and waited on us hand and foot. Overall I can't fault our stay & I would highly recommend The Westbury , you will not be disappointed with any aspect of this hotel.",5,2014,02,16
203,True 5 Star Luxury in Dublin,"Arrived on Friday afternoon, greet by a smartly dressed door man followed by Rachel who took us to our room and gave us some great tips for the evening. The gallery was a really nice space and we truly enjoyed our afternoon tea followed by a glass of bubbles before getting ready for dinner. The staff throughout the stay was very polite the service was exceptional.... Breakfast was a delight and a great way to end a wonderful night in Dublin.",5,2014,02,16
203,Just amazing,Stayed for one night over the weekend. Friendly staff on check-in and the room was just great. The food was superb in Wilde restaurant and the cocktails in the marble bar were yummy. Will be back soon! ,5,2014,02,16

203,Excellent location,"Absolutely perfect location in Dublin. As a member of leading hotels of the world I received a free upgrade to a suite which was excellent. You get a real five star feel from this hotel. Parking is the only issue, small car park that gets very busy and as a result you have the expense of the car park at the Stephens green shopping centre. ",5,2014,02,14
203,Good location,Very practical location and comfortable hotel. I was there for business and they made everything effortless - from taxi to restaurant suggestion. the hotel itself is very comfortable with wifi and table to work in the rooms.,4,2014,02,14
203,lovely stay,"had a very nice stay at the Westbury. staff was very helpful and made me feel welcome. location is great right at the heart of the city and close to great restaurants, shops and historic centre. I would definitely go back

203,City Centre Luxury,"I am a regular visitor of The Westbury Hotel and just after returning from a night there.As usual it met my high expectations of a 5 Star hotel.My deluxe room was top class with luxury bathroom products, loads of large fluffy towels ,bathrobe +slippers and a comfy king size bed.Turndown is an added extra.Nothing is a problem to the professional staff.

203,First class service,"Stayed for 3 nights with friends and found the overall service from the staff to be exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble. The hotel itself offers a very high level of accomodation and is centrally located so that a short walk is all that is required to reach most Dublin Landmarks. The cost of everything is on the high side, but you pay for what you get. This is our fourth stay and we will be returning.",5,2014,02,11
203,Simply the best hotel I've ever stayed in!,"Oh my goodness I could gush about The Westbury all day long. I simply loved this hotel. It is superb and they truly understand the term ""luxury"" the staff were incredible, the concierge was amazing, the food was fantastic, the bar was beautiful. It was truly a perfect luxury hotel. It has all the extra little touches that make a hotel a proper 'luxury"", I've stayed in a few ""5 star"" hotel and that term means nothing, the difference between 5 star and luxury is great and The Westbury has luxury in spades!",5,2014,02,11
203,Fantastic Stay,"Five Stars - Great location and helpful staff! Travelled with rest of my team for an offsite and had a wonderful time here. Service was really a pleasant surprise. Strongly recommend whether you are travelling for business or pleasure.

203,3 Night stay at Westbury,"My wife and I stayed for 3 nights in February 2014 at the Westbury Hotel and have nothing but praise for this magnificent hotel and all of the truly dedicated staff that we encountered. We have stayed there on numerous occasions over the past 30 years and have never been disappointed.  We would highly recommend this superb hotel to anyone looking high quality accommodation in the heart of Dublin with well trained, friendly and caring staff together with wide ranging facilities for all their guests.",5,2014,02,10
203,Fantastic and welcoming hotel,"I was staying at The Westbury last week, as I was completing some training in the hotel. As a 'complimentary guest' I can not comment on value for money however, regardless of the fact I was a 'comp guest', the staff treated me with absolute courtesy. 
Brilliant service, lovely food (try the oysters!) and just a simply welcoming feeling throughout the whole hotel. Could not be in a better location, it is just off the main high street.

Thanks to everyone at The Westbury! I pray I will be back :)",5,2014,02,10
203,Excellent Stay for Our 35th Wedding Anniversary,"We pick a different city every January to celebrate our wedding anniversary and this year chose Dublin. The Westbury Hotel had been recommended to us by a friend and we were not disappointed at all.
The Westbury catered for our every needs and more, they treated us exceptionally well and would return without a second thought, Thank you for a special time.

203,5 star excellence,"This is truly a world class 5 star hotel the staff were genuinely friendly and caring the atmosphere was relaxed unfussy and professional with a touch of real class. We had breakfast in the hotel and I can honestly say it was the best hotel breakfast we have ever had, dinner in Cafe Nuevo was fantastic the whole package, location, cost , performance ,and food... FIRST CLASS ",5,2014,02,10
203,Perfect,"Best  by Far.
I stayed last week with a group of friends in this wonderful hotel.The service was second to none with lots of extra touches .The staff were friendly and very professional and appeared with chairs when required in the lobby to seat our large group.The breakfast was super and served in a  beautiful room. This was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in",5,2014,02,08
203,NEVER FAILS TO IMPRESS,"The Westbury Hotel is our favourite Dublin hotel. It's the best located hotel in Dublin, close to top bars, restaurants and great shopping. There is always a lovely atmosphere here, with friendly, welcoming staff who are always eager to assist you. We have stayed here 4 times now and have never been disappointed.

203,Superb!,"We stayed at the Westbury on Saturday night, thanks to Anne Synnot who was an absolute pleasure to do business with, with swift replies and Welcoming manner, you knew you were gonna have a great stay before you even arrived, unlike some hotels where you could be forever waiting on an email!

The food in the evening was delicious and so was the breakfast! Staff 
were friendly and happy to help you. As to location, I could not think of a better spot, you're on Grafton street and that's where all the buzz is. Looking forward
to our next stay!

Regards
Egle Useckaite",5,2014,02,07
203,Very little room for improvement,"The location has to be the most obvious advantage of the Westbury. Dublin city center area is very walkable and the Westbury is at the heart of it all. The rooms are nice, large, comfortable with several nice amenities. The food is the only area i could hope to improve, but there are so many great options near by that there's no reason to eat in the hotel anyway. The staff was wonderful. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,02,06
203,5 Star treatment,"Booked the hotel for a special night away with my husband for his birthday. We were upgraded to the most beautiful room. The staff on reception were amazing and helpful. After dinner at a nearby restaurant we returned to the hotel for cocktails and had a fantastic night. The bar staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was the nicest breakfast, highly recommend the eggs benedict! On our departure our receptionist from the evening before remembered where we were dining and asked how the venue was etc. Very impressed she remembered us as the hotel seemed to be very busy. Oh and we had a lovely suprise the evening before with a desert plate left in our room with Happy Birthday. Very sweet. Cant wait to go back, its location and luxury surpassed all our expectations. ",5,2014,02,06
203,excellent,"We stayed for 2 nights. Dined in the restaurant on 1 night with friends. Food excellent and service very efficient. All staff friendly and helpful. Gallery is large and bright, very nice to sit to have a drink before dining. Location extremely central.",5,2014,02,06
203,My favourite Hotel in Ireland!!,"We have stayed here before and i'm happy to say this time was as good as if not better than the last.  We stayed in December 2013 and again last weekend (Feb 2014)
On both occasions we found the staff to be superb, never in my life have I been welcomed by such friendly genuine staff. Rachel in particular was fantastic, our room was upgraded and we were offered late check out the next day. 
Everything about this hotel screams class and the little luxurious touches (chocolates in rooms, nespresso machine, valet parking etc ...) everywhere make for an unforgettable experience all round. 
The breakfast the next morning was so good, huge choices for everyone and the restaurant staff were superb.
The location is brilliant for shopping, restaurants etc ... can't wait to come back!",5,2014,02,06
203,Best hotel ever,"I stayed here with my family and we loved it! The location was fantastic, the room was spacious, clean and well maintained and the staff were great. The nespresso machine and turn down service we unexpected luxuries! Couldn't ask for any more.",5,2014,02,05
203,10/10,"Faultless, perfect. On arrival was greeted by the concierge who parked the car for us. We were greeted by the manager Joseph at reception who welcomed us with hot towels for our hands and(nice touch).Ashley then brought us and our luggage too our room which was a large luxurious suite. Ashley assured us he was just a phone call away if we needed anything. The location was perfect in the heart of Dublin, shopping, bars and beautiful restaurants. ""Salamanca"" is just around the corner some of the best Tapas id ever had. Temple bar is 5 minutes walk away and has great nightlife.
All in all. Perfection.",5,2014,02,04
203,Top Service and Location,"I booked through the GHA program, which worked very well.  The staff was superb.  I have never had such a good welcome and such intelligent attention to my needs.  The location couldn't be better for central Dublin.  And the hotel is beautiful as well.  ",5,2014,01,31
203,Couldn't have been better!,"The best location in Dublin- I literally cannot fault this place. We stayed one night- 25th jan and were greeted at reception by Hazel who was absolutely wonderful and very helpful when we requested a room change ( as beside lift shaft). She also checked us out and truly does her job excellently and extremely professionally. Every staff member we encountered from concierge to restaurant, was friendly and down to earth. We were even spoiled with a selection of sweet treats on return to our room that night by way of an apology for the inconvenience of a room change- and it was no inconvenience at all, it was simply our preference. The rooms were immaculate and the turn down service a nice touch. Would highly recommend this hotel!!",5,2014,01,29
203,The Gallery at the Westbury.,"I organised a 20 year reunion for a relatively small group, in The Gallery at The Westbury Hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed the few hours we spent there, sipping wine and chatting in such a beautiful, comfortable, luxurious room. The staff were all fantastic, professional, friendly and helpful. I have been back on numerous occasions to enjoy the ambiance. My only regret is that I haven't stayed there yet! I definitely plan to make frequent return visits. It is a wonderful experience spending time in the Westbury Gallery lounge.",5,2014,01,28
203,No complaints at all,"Location, value, service, comfortable are all simply excellent.  Every aspect of the service was first class.  Also stayed at the Merrion during the same trip.  The Westbury is better if you are looking for more services and options, the Merrion if you are looking for more intimacy.   Westbury is better if you want to be right in the middle of everything.  ",5,2014,01,28
203,one for your bucket list,"just returned from what i would describe the best hotel in IRELAND
my wife and i were given a present of two nights in a deluxe room last weekend
on arrival and  to check out it was the best experience we have ever had in a Dublin hotel
having stayed in many hotels in Dublin over the last twenty years.
why i never stayed there before i don't know but i will definitely be going back
to all reading this i do not pretend to be a rich person who through his money away
but it was a wonderful experience staying at the Westbury Dublin",5,2014,01,28
203,excellent,"I must say that our over night stay was very enjoyable ,I just wish we could have stayed longer. We breakfast in our room and it was the best we have had anywhere. All the staff were very friendly and helpful .  We would love to make a return visit in the future.",5,2014,01,27
203,Fit for business,"Right in the centre of the city, well-decorated rooms, very friendly and well-trained, helpful staff; OK food with limited variety at breakfast with really bad coffee, incredibly small but still functional gym (with access to a next-door fitness club on a ‚Ç¨10 daily rate).
      ",4,2014,01,27
203,A very happy engagement,"After popping the question that morning the Westbury made our day so happy. Hazel at reception informed us of our complimentary upgrade and all the staff made us feel so welcome. After a day around Dublin city we arrived back to a complimentary bottle of bubbly and deserts from Niall, the general manager. We were overwhelmed and the hotel and all their staff really made the day so special. We will definitely be back and really appreciate the lengths the staff went to make our day.  ",5,2014,01,27
203,"Great hotel, top service","Stayed here for a couple of nights for work recently.  Was upgraded to a suite, which was a great treat.  Staff all very friendly and I am very grateful for the upgrade.  Room was quiet, clean and well appointed.  The breakfast buffet is also top notch.",4,2014,01,26
203,Just incredible - love this place!,"Location was fantastic! 
Staff were even better! 
And to top it off our Superior room was HUGE and very beautiful. 
LOVE LOVE LOVE everything about this hotel, made our trip, thank-you so much to The Westbury, even had the Manager personally ask us about our stay on check out, i cannot recommend this hotel enough!",5,2014,01,22
203,One of the best hotels I've stayed at,"I can't speak highly enough of this establishment. The hotel is located right on Grafton in an almost perfect location to much anywhere you'd need to go.

The room was perfectly clean, as you'd expect, and the staff was much friendlier and more polite than I've seen at most hotels. They were almost obsessive with keeping all of the hospitality items fully-stocked, whether it be the teas or the soaps; if the soap was even opened, you'd see a fresh one already waiting.

My one knock was that the 110V North American and 220V EU standard wall outlets weren't working, but they brought up a converter/surge protector with extra outlets for us to use.",5,2014,01,21
203,Perfect location,"The Westbury is a great hotel. The location couldn't be better, the hotel is right in the middle of Dublin's key attractions and best shopping streets. The hotel itself is beautiful, and its best asset is its staff who were always ready to assist and were tuned in to the needs of their guests above all else. Being there in winter was wonderful as the central gallery and bar areas were a little quieter than normal, and presented a beautiful spot to sit and read (and drink ... and dine) as a solo traveller, without feeling at all out of place. The hotel is beautifully furnished in public areas and the rooms and the bathrooms in particular were a highlight. Congratulations Westbury, I will be back.",4,2014,01,21
203,Exceeded expectations,"Couldn't have been more pleased with our stay @ The Westbury.  The hotel was not only beautiful but the staff was wonderful as well. If you're looking for a special place to stay at while you're in Dublin, look no further. Perfect location.  Close to City Centre, tons of shopping, restaurants, and pubs. Should you need any advice or help while your there ask for Tommy or Eddie @ the concierge desk, both were so helpful.",5,2014,01,21
203,Fabulous Service/Integrity,"Have stayed at this GREAT hotel a number of times!! Best time was when the computer system mad a GRAVE error and booked by a $750 suite for $75......they honored the mistake withount batting an eye.....grat service, great location great accomodations....if there were a 6 Star rating....i would easily agree!!!!",5,2014,01,20
203,Really excellent,"Mum and I nada two night stay at the Westbury.  From the moment we arrived, we felt welcome.  The hotel has a comfortable, plush, without being too posh, feel.  Everything was of good quality, the room, the food, the cappuccinos! ",5,2014,01,20
203,Home from home 2,Having stayed at the Westbury many times I find it to be welcoming and friendly but yet professional . The bedrooms have had a makeover to a more modern feel but yet still keeping the old but new world feel. The only fault I would have is they really need to upgrade their movie channels they are slightly outdated. As for location you are near great shopping theatres are wonderful walks around the city and fun nightlife and as many restaurants for all different tastes. The Westbury for me is my home from home and have recommend I have recommend many friends who now have become regulars here also. You may notice I put good for sleep quality this is because you are in a city hotel and noise is unavoidable. ,5,2014,01,20
203,Everything screams 5 star,"Just got home from a wonderful stay at The Westbury - and if I could give it 6 stars I totally would! Fabulous location, beautiful room and exceptional customer service means I won't ever stay anywhere else in Dublin again. Thank you to every member of staff, from reception to concierge, to doorman to the chambermaids who all made us feel like royalty! Extra special thanks to Gillian who arranged a little birthday surprise and card in the room for a member of my party - she loved it!",5,2014,01,19
203,Exceptional,"You have not had a proper hotel experience unless you have stayed here. It is the best Hotel I have ever stayed in. The food, service and comfort is second to none. Breakfast in bed was so nice and the waiter who delivered it to the room was very accommodating and attentive. Stay here and you wont be disappointed",5,2014,01,19
203,Stayed 15th January 2014 Fabulous,"I have just stayed at this hotel and was blown away by how good it was.
Brilliant, fabulous, attentive,helpful‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
I could go on, the check in was effortless with a hot towel on arrival.
Rooms had every thing including iPad/pod/phone charger and brilliant Nespresso coffee machine, no instant sachets!!!!!
The most comfortable bed and pillows.
The restaurant was superb, staff delightful.
I would stay here again and again.
Thank you Westbury for a lovely stay and showing how it should be done. 5 stars.",5,2014,01,17
203,Westbury Dublin 2014,"

My girlfriend & I just came in to price a weekend in the hotel and we we‚Äôre immediately blown away with how beautiful everything was. We spoke with a guy ‚ÄòColum‚Äô at the front desk and he was so welcoming, professional and helpful answering our questions. He invited us to have a drink in the Hotel‚Äôs Gallery and the staff there were just amazing. We were then greeted by ‚ÄòJoseph‚Äô the guest relations manager who was such a gentleman. 
We were sad to leave but we can‚Äôt wait to return and actually stay at the hotel as we couldn‚Äôt have been happier during the time we were there.

203,Great Service!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here back in March 2013. The hotel was beautiful and the rooms were modern and updated. Though the service was great as far as the concierge/front desk/room service, we felt that the service at the Marble Bar was to be lacking. (We assume it was because we were considerably younger than most of the people staying there, most were getting service while we were ignored on two separate occasions) We ended up spending a lot of time in Cafe Novo because their service was so much better and their staff was great! They really helped make our entire experience memorable.

But the main point about this hotel is the location. It was perfect! We walked everywhere because it was in the middle of everything!! We only took a cab to get to and from the airport and to go out to Wicklow for a day trip during our 10 day stay. We would absolutely stay here again.",4,2014,01,14
203,Simply superb!,"Stunning service from the moment we checked in to the moment we left. Great location, fabulous room, amazing afternoon tea. Loved every minute and would thoroughly recommend, we had the best time - staff are exceptional.
      ",5,2014,01,13
203,Most Comfortable Bed,"The hotel is in a great location and is a beautiful hotel with the most comfortable bed I think I have ever slept in. The blackout curtains in the room made it almost impossible to get up we were that cosy!  The Lounge staff are very slow and that is the only negative thing I can say about the hotel. It wouldn't put me off staying here again, but they do need to pay a little bit more attention to everyone in the Lounge area and not just concentrate on the Afternoon Tea clients. We had three bottles of Champagne and Sandwiches in our group which cost more than an Afternoon Tea, but we had to really work hard to get served and waited over half an hour for a Coffee without so much as an apology.",4,2014,01,10
203,Christmas luxury break,We stayed at the Westbury the weekend before Christmas. We had a fabulous time there. I can only highly recommend it. From arrival to departure I can only praise the hotel. The staff were friendly and welcoming. The rooms were fabulous. The atmosphere in the Gallery was second to none. The breakfast catered for every taste. The location is perfect. The Christmas decor was lovely. My children loved the whole experience and can't wait to stay there again. ,5,2014,01,10
203,A haven in the heart of the city!,"We as a family, stayed in the Westbury for a night after New Years and had an amazing time. The location of the hotel is perfect, its fantastic to walk out the door and be right in the centre of the city. Our rooms were beautiful with a view of Grafton Street and the turn down service was a lovely treat. Breakfast the next morning for me was a highlight, there was nearly too much to choose from and we never felt rushed to vacate our table. The complimentarty newspaper added to what was a very relaxing meal.
The staff really make the stay here exceptional, constantly smiling and helpful. They had a room ready for us immediately, despite our early arrival, and provided some great recommendations of places to eat.
All in all I don't think I could visit Dublin again and not stay in the Westbury, we were spoiled throughout our stay. I only hope I can afford it next time!",5,2014,01,10
203,Ideal location and very comfortable,"I stayed in this hotel for just one night on a quick trip to Dublin. This hotel is ideally located off the main shopping street of Dublin (which is a no car zone) but just slightly off the street in order to be quiet. Rooms are quite spacious and very comfortable. The ratio quality to price is extremely high in this hotel, there is really nothing that bothered me during my stay and I am looking forward to coming back.",4,2014,01,10
203,Year End at the Westburry Hotel,"Stayed at the Westburry Hotel in Dublin at the Year End of 2013 with the family (2 adults and 2 children) and it was a very enjoyable stay. Fantastic location (right in the centre of Dublin and next to the main shooping and F&B area), the facilities are quite nice and specially Staff are all very professional and friendly.  ",4,2014,01,10
203,Outstanding,"I stayed in the Westbury for 1 night on New Years Day. The staff were exceptional from the moment I stepped in the door. My room was of very good quality and exceptionally clean. I stay in hotels a lot and this really was outstanding , very impressed. ",5,2014,01,10
203,Amazing Hotel that I would highly recommend,"This hotel met every need we required, I'm very choosy when it comes to hotels after staying in some of the best in the world.  The 2 night stay was booked as a surprise for my partners birthday celebration, his first visit to Dublin and he guarantees me we will return to the Westbury. To help celebrate my partners birthday nothing was too much trouble, every request was met by a high level including providing a birthday cake with lit candles and a waiter to sing happy birthday.
The staff were amazingly friendly and help made our stay a very enjoyable one. We ordered champagne breakfast in bed  alongside a breakfast that isn't normally offered, eggs Benedict... Truly delicious!. We also had champagne afternoon tea in the gallery that was lovely but could have down with extra cakes. The feel of the hotel was lovely and relaxed not loud or over crowded.",5,2014,01,09
203,Great family trip,"Stayed here for a couple of nights in the new year with my partner and baby. We really enjoyed how in the centre of the city the hotel is and despite this all 3 of us had a great nights sleep with no noise from the outside. The room was great it was spotless and really spacious, the cot we had requested was all set up in the room when we arrived which is great when you arrive with a tired baby! They had also left a little lamb teddy for my daughter in the cot which was a nice touch.
Throughout our stay the staff were very helpful and couldn't do enough to help us and they were always full of smiles and chat to my daughter even if she wasn't always in great form! 
We couldn't find fault with the food or any element of our stay and would love to return in the not too distant future.",5,2014,01,08
203,Lovely relaxing night in the city,"After a busy run up to christmas myself and my husband decided to treat ourselves to a night in the city over christmas and as its so close to Grafton St we chose the Westbury Hotel. When we arrived at the hotel there was a lovely christmasy atmosphere with a big christmas tree greeting us at the top of the stairs. The staff at check in were very friendly and even showed us to our room. The room was lovely and very comfortable, I was just sorry we weren't staying for more than one night. I love the bathroom products they use they smell fab. 
When we booked our stay at the hotel we also booked afternoon tea which I am so glad we did it as it was really busy the day we were there and the atmosphere was great. The table we had was also great for people watching!! The food was lovely and all the sweet treats came out in a hat box which was really different but great presentation. We washed it all down with a glass of bubbly!!! 
The next morning at breakfast there was a great selection to choose from and we really enjoyed it, we were full until dinner. Will definitely be back and would recommend this hotel to any family and friends that are looking for somewhere to stay in the city.",5,2014,01,08
203,Doesn't Live Up to the Hype,"The Westbury purports to be one of the world's leading hotels, but frankly we were underwhelmed.

I'll start with the positives. First, the location is absolutely perfect if you're visiting Dublin. Just off of Grafton Street (the city's high end shopping district), it is less than a block to great shopping and perhaps a 5 minute walk to many great restaurants in Dublin. The room we booked, a Deluxe, was spacious enough and very clean. Turndown service was the most impeccable and thorough that I've experienced - including straightening the washroom, setting out slippers on a foot-cloth, turning down the bed and leaving chocolates. Made all the difference when we returned from dinner each evening.

Additionally, both the Cafe Novo restaurant and the hotel's bar were very enjoyable. Cafe Novo served us a nice brunch - we both enjoyed our food (including a delicious scone that you should order!) and the price was very reasonable. The bar serves great cocktails - the Grey Gentleman was my favorite during our stay.

Now for the not-so-positive parts. First, the bathroom floor was freezing. Perhaps this would be fine at a lesser property, but we both noticed every time we walked in. The lobby, the halls, and the guest rooms are all just a bit... shopworn. Walking into the lobby feels underwhelming given the hotel's reputation and marketing, and the guest rooms feel the same. The furniture in our room was dented, etc. Nothing about this hotel feels especially nice, and while our stay was adequate, it wasn't anything to brag about.

Finally, the absolutely bad part - the ""gym,"" if you can call it that. We went down for a morning workout and walked into a room the size of a guest room which literally has no heater in it. The majority of the equipment in the room is completely broken, and it appeared someone had left a mess as a result of some sexual activity on the floor. There was what was supposed to be a basket of fresh fruit, but it contained a single rotten apple. Not the experience we expected to be paying for.

Frankly while the Westbury was OK, I wouldn't stay there again or recommend it to others. The Conrad, The Merrion, or others are better choices.",3,2014,01,07
203,Great experience,"The hotel's location is perfect - just tucked away on a side street off grafton street. We arrived by car and there is a valet service. It costs 20 euro for overnight parking.

The hotel's interior is very aesthetically pleasing. It's luxurious and classic. Upon check-in the lagu was very pleasant and we were given hot hand towels for refreshment.

We had book a standard double and it was a good side, perhaps the bathroom is a little on the small side. Again the interior was elegant, creams with nice furntiture. There's an nespresso maching with plenty of refills but ours didn't work very well - we didn't complain though. Bath products were from aromatherapy associates. Crystal cut glasses in room also. Bed linen was of great quality. There's also a turn down service with butlers chocolate.

We enjoyed having drinks in the gallery and bar area, they are pricey though!

Continental breakfast is 15euro pp but there's lots of selection.

This will be my new hotel to stay in Dublin - well, as long as I can afford it!",5,2014,01,05
203,Excellent location,"Of all hotel locations I would rank the Westbury #1.  The hotel opens into a short, quiet (for the neighborhood) lane that runs 20 yards and flows into Grafton street.  
But what makes this hotel great is the lively neighborhood that runs 4 blocks west from the back of the hotel (which is easily accessible) this neighborhood was fun, safe and more established then the temple bar area.  
From the Westbury you are a 5 minute walk thru this neighborhood to temple bar.  3 minutes from st Stephan's green.  5 minutes from trinity college.  
The hotel is well appointed, with friendly staff.  This is a classy city center European hotel, not to be equated with a Four Season in a resort location.  That's not fair.  
For a well traveled couple in their late 30s that appreciates a good pub and very good food, this hotel was perfectly located.  
",5,2014,01,04
203,Christmas Afternoon Tea at The Westbury,"When I ventured into the Westbury in late November to make a booking for a Christmas afternoon tea treat, the first Saturday available was post-Christmas, Saturday December 28th....the charming wait staff laughed not unkindly with me as we contemplated thoughts of ""what recession?!"".  
Five weeks later, our first foray out of the house since Christmas Day, after a couple of hours of not altogether focused sales shopping we arrived at the hotel.  All afternoon we watched as hopeful afternoon tea drinkers without bookings were turned away.  Dressed for Christmas, the gracious hotel lobby was warm and welcoming, glamorous and inviting.  A selection of families, couples, girlfriends were all ensconced at tables, laden with linen and silver and hatboxes of sweet treats.
A classic afternoon tea cost ‚Ç¨42 per afternoon tea and included a selection of 4 sandwiches, a sorbet, scones with jam and cream, 12 pastry treats and coffee or tea.  One afternoon tea is more than enough to be shared by two moderately hungry adults.  The wait staff were charming and discreet, they managed to sound enthusiastic when explaining each mini course that was coming our way, regardless of the fact that they had probably said the same thing hundreds of times over since the Christmas season began.  One tip - I suggest that you ask for them to hold off serving your tea/coffee until they are ready to bring the food, our tea had turned to stew by the time the freshly prepared sandwiches were brought to the table.
The scones were warm and the perfect petite size, the sweet treats were mini works of art, colourful and plentiful, we couldn't finish everything despite our most valiant efforts.  
At no stage did we feel rushed or that our table was just part of a long chain of reserved afternoon teas throughout the month of December.  Looking around, we could see that all the other diners seemed to be having the same relaxing, enjoyable experience, happy to be out and part of the glamorous scene, inclusive but not intimidating.  We lingered, not anxious to leave long after we finished eating and drinking.  
I am almost reluctant to recommend this wonderful Christmas afternoon tea experience because it means we will likely have to book in September this year! everyone should go to the Westbury at Christmas, if not for the afternoon tea but to savour the atmosphere and to leave your cares behind even for a few lovely hours with your favourite people.",5,2014,01,03
203,The best hotel of our trip,"We stayed at four different 5 star properties during a tour of Ireland and this was our favorite.  It is very well located down a side street just steps from wonderful restaurants, pubs and shopping, but you are not disturbed at all by noise or traffic.  The rooms are a bit small, but very well maintained, nicely appointed, clean and comfortable.  Our only problem was figuring out the lights and not having the proper converter to charge our phones.  The hotel loaned us a proper converter and we got the hang of the lights after a couple of days.  We had the buffet breakfast most days which included a good offering of traditional breakfast foods in the upstairs restaurant which had large windows looking out over the street.  However, the staff is what makes this a 5 star property.  They were genuinely interested in assisting us in any way that they could and if one person on the staff was unable to help, they very quickly took us to find someone who could.  This was without a doubt the most attentive, friendly and accommodating staff we encountered on our entire tour.  We will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,01,02
203,Return to Westbury,"As a post-Christmas treat we decided to go to Dublin for New Year's Eve. We arrived in the early afternoon and from then on it was a lovely experience, even better than I remembered from a few years ago. The car was whisked away on our arrival and returned very promptly on checkout. Checkin and checkout were seamless. All staff were welcoming and helpful.

We had dinner in the Wilde restaurant, it was absolutely delicious. The menu was interesting and different with lots of choice. Breakfast was very good, a great selection on the buffet as well as made to order cooked foods.

Our room was very comfortable and clean. There was no annoying outside noise.

I hope to return again in 2014.",5,2014,01,02
203,Just the Best,"Visited here for weekend over December period . Outstanding service . Welcome note in room and a birthday card for our daughter with little cake treats ! The atmosphere is just wonderful and there is no other way to celebrate a trip to Dublin for a special occasion ( and even if there's no occasion) than to stay at The Westbury hotel . It exudes elegance , charm , warmth and all in the spirit of delightful informality.",5,2013,12,31
203,Fabulous!,"My family and I stayed at the Westbury in early July 2013. The location is wonderful, easy to walk to all sorts of restaurants & shops. The staff was great, very attentive to all of our needs and very helpful when trying to figure out the types of tours we wanted to go on in the city. The doormen were also very polite and patient with us when we asked them to take a bunch of pictures! Ha. The bar in the lobby has great drinks, but quite pricey. The rooms were very clean and well maintained. We stayed here for three nights before moving on to the countryside. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for great service in an unbeatable location.",5,2013,12,30
203,Afternoon tea.....check first!,"Treat weekend in Dublin, recommended to go for afternoon tea as a lovely experience at The Westbury Hotel.
Not as good as anticipated Im afraid!
I'd printed off info just 2 days before we went to The Westbury, saying champagne afternoon tea was 36 euros.  
We booked, welcome was lovely, venue is very relaxing and lovely to look out of the windows........BUT the price had gone up to 48euros for the Xmas special teas!  

If you like cakes, its fine, not much savoury content (4 finger sandwiches).  Cakes were limited in choice.  We'd had afternoon tea at Gleneagles 2 weeks before which had set an excellent benchmark with a real feast for ¬£26 - lots of savouries as well as a huge selection of cakes.  Im afraid in comparison, The Westbury was much more expensive, and less choices offered.

Disappointing if planning this as a real treat.",3,2013,12,29
203,Fantastic,I wanted a special weekend away with my husband and the Westbury was the perfect choice. The staff are courteous and extremely professional. Even though it was a busy weekend in the lead up to Christmas and there were many people checking in there was no waiting around. In the evening the bar was packed but the lovely hostess had a table as soon as she found out we were residents...a lovely touch. The location is super. Rooms are small but perfect and I can't wait to stay here again!,5,2013,12,28
203,Perfect hotel,Perfect Dublin Hotel. Everything we could want and more. Staff excellent especially Ashley who booked us into a great restaurant at the last minute with great patience. Made our anniversary even better.,5,2013,12,27
203,"Great location for sight seeing, shopping and dining.","Beautiful hotel in the centre of Dublin with warm and friendly staff. There were however some downsides to our short stay ....  housekeeping trolleys and vacuums abandoned everywhere, cocktail served in chipped glass, low pressure shower and tap. The room was nicely furnished but small .... bathroom was cramped. Light switching solution meant you had to get out of bed to operate the lights. Overall very mixed feelings about our stay. ",3,2013,12,23
203,4 star not 5,"This is a 4 star hotel not a 5 star, have stayed at the Bristol hotel in bristol uk part of the Doyle collection and they are very similar, that is a 4 star and rated as such. Location excellent and rooms pleasant. Would stay again overall very good hotel.",4,2013,12,22
203,The Westbury gets better and better!,"This was our second visit to the Wesbury. We stayed 3 nights over a weekend to celebrate my 50th Birthday. We stayed in 0ne of the Four Poster Bed Studio Suites.
A beautiful room with lovely views towards Grafton Street and over south Dublin. The armchairs, with a lovely footstool, are without doubt the most comfortable I've tried!
The hotel was very busy in the run up to Christmas with seats at a premium in the public areas. The hotel keep some seats reserved and as residents we were always found a seat in the bar - a nice touch that many other hotels could learn from.
Breakfast was as good as I remembered it, good buffet, excellent A La Carte menu and friendly service. 
From check-in to departure the staff were friendly and very helpful. Every single member of staff that we encountered seemed genuinely happy to be working there, I've never experienced that in any hotel before.
A perfect location for a special weekend.",5,2013,12,21
203,Big Thanks,"I just wanted to say that their customer Service is best I have scene !.. I had left the hotel and forgot our passports in the safe. We did not notice till the next morning that we had left them there and we needed to get to the airport to catch an international flight. I call them panicking and they were very professional on the phone with me and told me I had nothing to worry about and they would send someone with the Passports and meet me at the airport... who does that ?? I am so blown away by the quick thinking front office person, that made us not miss our flight. I wish I knew her name, because I would love to commend her. She had an accent and came from the EU somewhere.. Seriously, I have recommended this hotel to everyone and would stay here again when I come back to Dublin... 5***** for this alone !",5,2013,12,19
203,Comfort and quality,"Stayed for a single night and found the hotel, location and staff to be superb. 

The room was a good size, decor was pleasing to the eye. You had that feeling of quality without being too stuffy. Food in the Bistro was also excellent.

Would recommend to others!",5,2013,12,19
203,Too Many Small Niggles,"First stay at The Westbury and chose it because of it's central location and on the recommendation of friends. First niggle was finding the place by car. The one way system in Dublin is a nightmare, one wrong turn and its a good ten minutes to get back on track and because The Westbury is bang in the center of the action its like finding a needle in a haystack but when you get there the welcome is warm and efficient. The Rooms are good with comfy beds so sleep quality is high and they are well insulated with all the expected comforts but second niggle was the shower which was more like slow drizzle than a shower. When I'm paying ¬£250 a night I think a decent shower is a must. Concierge service was excellent and staff all very attentive but third niggle was breakfast which was below par for five star and not included in the room rate. Would I go again?................maybe but I have the feeling there may be better alternatives at these prices.",3,2013,12,18
203,Memorable 2 nights stay in The Westbury,Just returned from 2 night stay in this beautiful hotel.  My husband and I were celebrating our Ruby Anniversary plus it was also my birthday on the first day there.  The staff made it so special with little treats sent to the room also birthday card.  Breakfast was excellent.  Service impeccable.  Cocktails were very good. Could not find anything to complain about.  Will definitely return as the location is superb.,5,2013,12,18
203,Five star stay five star location,"Stayed here a couple of years ago and found it disappointing. Had heard it had been done up and given it's central location, tried it again
From start to finish our stay was wonderful Very welcoming helpful staff at check in, our room ready ahead of time. The room very tastefully decorated in neutral hues with a great bathroom and very comfortable bed.
The common areas were beautifully decorated for Christmas with excellent people watching going on. Residents were given priority as there was high demand for this central location. Wonderful cockails

We had lunch at Caf√© Novo downstairs, tasty balanced menu, trendy decor, helpful staff and the best value fish and chips ever!

Breakfast the next day was freshly cooked and very tasty. The croissants were as good as one would get in Paris. 
The hotel was full on this Saturday before Christmas but we were made to feel like special guests
My hotelier husbad found the hotel to be without fault as did I
A true five star experience in the heart of Dublin
We will be back",5,2013,12,18
203,Fantastic,"Love this hotel.  The whole experience from start to finish was simply wonderful.  The staff were attentive, experienced and welcoming, room was spacious and comfortable, location perfect - the breakfast was good too.  So if you deserve a treat, or know someone who does, make the Westbury your first choice.  We will be back.",5,2013,12,17
203,A little disappointed,"Location perfect, staff lovely, slight delay in checking in, but a busy time. Room nice real nice but was expecting more for the price. Bathroom was small and the silicon around the bath needs to be replaced, a funny colour.",3,2013,12,16
203,"Fantastic location, great cocktails",From the doorman greeting me by name to the fab cocktails at the bar. The location is brilliant. I enjoyed my stay here. Everyone was very helpful. My room was a bit noisy but that was the only downside.,4,2013,12,15
203,great hotel,"i stayed here few weeks ago for a week end with my girlfriend,service was impeccable from concierge to housekeeping ...everyone very helpful and friendly
 the room was beautiful and very large....the bathroom WOW....!! breakfast was good as well definitely recommended .",5,2013,12,14
203,Amazing!!!,"We stayed here for the weekend and from the moment we arrived we were made to feel most welcome
We were a family of 4 with a 4 year old and a 1 and a half year old.
Concierge took control of our car at the door, which was fab at the hotel really is in the centre of dublin and with the one way system we struggled to find it! So someone parking the car was a blessing!!! 
Check in was most easy and our room was huge!!!  The added touch was a teddy lamb in the childs cot, she has yet to put it down!!!
Staff all incredibly friendly and can't help enough! Breaks fats time was fine for us though with 2 small children we were in both mornings around 9am
Location is smack bang in shopping land  
Really cannot rate it high enough
In this world you really do get what you pay for and this hotel is a prime example of that!!
Will definitely be back!",5,2013,12,14
203,Really enjoyable stay,"Spent a weekend here with my wife and we had an excellent time. From the moment you pull up and the concierge takes your car keys to park the car to the moment when he gives them back to you at the end of your stay and your car is waiting for you the whole experience is great. Staff are extremely polite, friendly and helpful. Rooms are of a very high standard with excellent housekeeping. 
The only poor thing we experienced (and I was aware it was probably going to happen based on other reviews here) was the breakfast on Saturday morning. We had a 30 minute wait for a table and then the service was very slow as the staff were overwhelmed. We just went down an hour earlier the following morning and had a wonderful breakfast instead.
Would definitely recommend it and obviously it's location to Grafton Street makes it very popular with the ladies too!",5,2013,12,10
203,The Westbury is so consistent!,"The Westbury is hard to beat and definitely the best place to stay in Dublin.  The welcome and friendliness of the staff is second to none together with the location, room amenities and comfort of the hotel.  Breakfast was excellent and I'll definitely be back on my next visit to Dublin.",5,2013,12,09
203,A quality hotel in a great location!,"Came over for my Birthday. Right in the heart of the city. Rooms are perfect and beds are amazingly comfortable. Service is superb and cannot be faulted. Coming back soon, has now become our favourite hotel in Dublin. Afternoon tea available but my recommendation is sit in the bar and do some people watching. Service excellent- Lenka behind the bar and Sara in the lounge.",5,2013,12,07
203,"A bit more costly than most but much much better in service, location and ambience!",Have booked in visiting authors and stayed myself twice now. Ireland can be proud of the Westbury. The perfect place for tourists and locals who want to be in the heart of Dublin's fair city. The service is top notch and the rooms very comfortable. The lounge is wonderful for relaxing or entertaining. Staff all friendly and courteous. I'll be back!,5,2013,12,07
203,Another Great Stay at The Westbury,"During my visit to Dublin last week, I again stayed at The Westbury Hotel. It was just for one night but would have loved to stay longer.  It was my friend's birthday and she was delighted to find a birthday card and treats in the room on arrival.  The hotel never disappoints and we had a great evening.",5,2013,12,07

our stay so memorable.X",5,2013,12,06
203,Luxury in the City,"Stayed here with my mum, aunt and sister for a shopping trip.  Found the staff to be exceptionally friendly and helpful.  Room was lovely, plenty of space with the extras you expect from 5 star - nice Nepresso machine, turn down, chocolates on the bed.  We all arrived by train/bus so didn't have to worry about parking.  It is perfectly located for city centre shopping.  We didn't eat at all in hotel, so can't comment on the food.",5,2013,12,06
203,Fabulous!,"Stayed here recently for a romantic getaway. Availed of Afternoon tea but didn't have any other meals there

We really enjoyed outlet stay. The hotel has a classy vibe, the staff are dressed at a very classy level too which helps set the atmosphere. For tourists visiting Dublin, the location is perfect.

Rooms were spotless, fresh and vet comfortable. Wifi was complimentary (as it should be) and there was no charge for the valet to park your car. (Although there is a parking charge)

The bar is cosy (grab a seat by the fire)

The only constructive comment was the service during afternoon tea was a little bit sloppy (it was very busy) but given out leisurely approach to the occasion it didn't effect our enjoyment.

Highly recommend.",5,2013,12,05
203,Overpriced,"I recently had afternoon tea in this hotel with my husband and found it to be way overpriced for what we received.Especially as it is a lot cheaper in another 5* hotel around the corner.When I expressed my disatisfaction with the price for a very small afternoon tea to the waitress her attitude was of indifference.Not the sort of service or experience you would expect in this hotel.
Very disappointing.",2,2013,12,05
203,Perfect location,"We stayed in the Westbury whilst we were Christmas shopping in Dublin.The obvious plus side to this hotel is it's location right in the heart of Grafton street but we were worried that this might also be it's downfall(noise wise).Our rooms were overlooking two pubs with a lot of people outside but once you closed the windows you couldn't hear a peep!The rooms  have an understated elegance with a badly needed Nespresso machine.The breakfast was very good with a good choice of cheeses,quiche,smoked salmon etc..The only thing that could be improved on is the flavour of the full Irish.This hotel is a gem and we are already planning our return trip!",5,2013,12,04
203,wow this is what 5 stars should look like,"I had one night at the Westbury on business in November 2013 and wish it could have been longer.

203,"Great location, Great Staff","My husband and I stayed at the Westbury for three nights while enjoying the end of our vacation in Ireland.  It is in a great location - close to everything, but tucked away on a side street.  The bar was a little too upscale for what we wanted (we were more focused on pubs and than clubs) but the hotel itself was beautiful.  On our second to last night, my husband came down with a significant fever.  The staff was amazing!  The overnight desk clerk came up to check on us and made sure we knew he could call a doctor.  It was a great stay and I would definitely return!",4,2013,12,03
203,"Glad tidings of comfort and joy, revisited!","Nobody does comfort , joy, elegance and serenity in the heart of Dublin quite like the Westbury! Quite simply the best! On arrival our car and luggage were swept efficiently away. We were offered hot towels at reception while we checked in with the wonderful receptionist ,who handled all our queries and needs so capably throughout the whole weekend. Our room was perfect, roomy and spotless. Housekeeping attended generously to our every need. What a treat it is to step out onto bustling, sparkling Grafton street!It is an even bigger treat to step back into the magnificently festive surrounds of the Westbury hotel. The bar staff are discreet and very friendly and serve the best cocktails in town. Breakfast in the dining room is delicious, from the bircher meusli to the granola to the pastries and divine fresh fruit, we tried it all ! Throughout our whole weekend the Assistant Guest Relations Manager regularly appeared with a friendly smile , assuring us  that the Westbury staff genuinely care about their guests..Check- out was as efficient and painless as check -in . Despite the fact that the hotel was extremely busy,(it being a rugby weekend) each member of staff did their utmost to make us feel so welcome and very special. The Westbury is unbeatable for comfort, service  and a great Irish welcome. We have already booked our next trip!.",5,2013,12,03
203,Elegant superbly located City Centre Hotel,"Our over night stay in the Westbury last weekend was a really great experience. I have visited the hotel on a few occasions over the years for lunch, coffee, drinks....however It was my first time staying there and I was really impressed.The elegant 1st floor lounge and the newly decorated bedrooms were spacious and relaxing, decorated in beautiful  muted grey tones. I was marking a birthday celebration and was very pleasantly surprised to find in our room a  lovely bottle of wine and petit four mini desserts waiting for us.Service was really good overall with fabulous personal touches. The hotel had a great pre Christmas buzz all around and is unbeatable for best location in Dublin (tucked away just off Grafton Street) for shopping... (The  shops in the Westbury Mall and Powerscourt centre are definitely worth a browse .",5,2013,12,03
203,Great Location and Excellent Service,"Arrived around 13.00 with my wife. Check in was speedy and courteous. Room was standard size but well fitted out. Room had tea & coffee making facilities along with flat screen TV, hair drier, iron and board, fridge & free in-room safe and free bottled water.
Had breakfast each morning which was excellent and also had one evening meal in the lounge which we thoroughly enjoyed. We also had coffee mid morning and also afternoon in the large beautifully decorated lounge.
We would have no hesitation in recommending the Westbury Hotel.",5,2013,12,02
203,What a Fantastic Hotel in Central Dublin,"We have stayed at several hotels in central Dublin but now only stay at the Westbury as it meets all of our requirements.   It's location is right beside the Grafton Street shopping area and walking distance from anywhere else we want to go, such as Arts Centre, St. Stephens Green and Nassau Street, not to mention the many fantastic restaurants such as Trocadero, etc.

On arrival, give your car keys to the Concierge for safe underground parking, reception is exceptionally customer focused and make you feel special.  The rooms are high standard and very comfortable with all one might need.   

A change made this autumn was to extend the Dining Room evening menu into the Lounge area which was a great move as far as we were concerned.  Both normal Dining Rooms have an excellent range of dishes and great service.   

Overall an excellent hotel which I reccommend to any of my friends visiting Dublin. This hotel has location, atmosphere and style.

Coleraine",5,2013,12,02
203,Not up to standard,"In a difficult to reach location, the room was just about standard. Car parking was full, not included and overpriced. When asking for directions to the hotel through the one way streets was recommend to rent a GPS from hertz. Staff were dismissive of parking issues and were unable to help with an hour early check in after a long trip to Dublin. I'd recommend the Fitzwilliam for a much better experience in the same area of town after a recent visit there.",2,2013,11,30
203,Inexplicable Service,"The Gallery in the Westbury has been a favourite of mine for many years as a good place to have morning coffee, a light lunch, afternoon tea or early evening drinks in the centre of the city.  My most recent visit was last Tuesday.  The Gallery was less than a third full and it was lunchtime.  My friend and I ordered drinks and then I asked if I could have a plain chicken or ham sandwich.  No was the response.  Apparently I was only 'allowed' to have a club sandwich, no other kind.  I was also told that I could also have a bowl of soup, a scone or something from the lunch menu.  I did not want any of these things, I just wanted a simple sandwich.  After such a reception I didn't bother to order any food.  Perhaps we were just unlucky with the service but it was very disappointing - I will go to the Shelbourne or Westin in future.",2,2013,11,30
203,"I love it!!,","Beautiful and  great hotel. Everything was espectacular, the decoration, the reception, the staff, the room, I recomended because is difficult to have all the attention you need been satisfied for people being well prepare. I had a wonderful stay.",5,2013,11,28
203,"Stunning hotel, wonderful staff.","My fiancee and i stayed here for three nights in November to enjoy a city break in Dublin. We decided to pay a bit extra for a hotel and reading online the Westbury seemed to fit the bill. We were so glad that we did as this was one of the best hotels we had ever stayed in. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel so welcome, and nothing was too much trouble for the staff, who were attentive, professional and most importantly so friendly. Every person who we came into contact with would smile and say hello.

The interior of the hotel was superb, we had afternoon tea in the gallery, we had drinks in the marble bar, and had a meal in the restaurant, and the food, drinks and service were all excellent and all in luxury surroundings that you would expect from a five star hotel.

Our room was also top notch, it was nice after a long day in the city to come back to your room in the evening, and the sheets had been turned down and there was a bottle of water and slippers by the bed. And in the morning you could have a coffee from the nespresso machine and order a (huge!) full irish breakfast to the room knowing that when you went out for the day your room would be impeccably clean when you got back.

On checking out we both agreed that our choice of hotel had made our city break special and if we are ever in Dublin again we would not hesitate to book at the westbury again.",5,2013,11,25
203,A little disappointed,"Stayed last saturday night with a large group of colleagues and friends.
I thought from our initial greeting it was going to be wonderful.
It was for the most part but unfortunately on Sunday morning we had to wait for almost an hour for a table for breakfast,
Yes it was busy but a hotel such as the Westbury should be able to cater for the numbers.
There were no bowls available for fresh fruit and it was all a little rushed.
However the staff couldnt have been more pleasant but I feel a little let down",3,2013,11,25
203,one night getaway package,"As a very special treat my husband and I booked a Wilde experience stay at the Westbury. The attention and the hotel itself is just fabulous and the location is perfect. 
The only downside was the dinner which was included in the package price.
The menu was very limited on all course choices and the servings were small and inadequate. The waiter took great pity on me when he saw the look of disappointment on my face as I looked at my starter, he offered bread. Which I may say was gratefully received and devoured. The food was tasty but not enough of it at all to justify the price tag of the night, especially when you can walk out the door of the hotel and within 3 minutes can avail of a myriad of good restaurant deals.  needless to say the restaurant was very quiet and I for one would not return to eat there for that price tag. We enjoyed our break but were disappointed with the food.",3,2013,11,24
203,"Lovely hotel ,really enjoyed our stay ,","We did a 1 night stop in the westbury booked via Amex and it was a really nice hotel.

We had afternoon tea which although pricey at 30 euros a head if you have done an Amex booking is delicious ,sandwiches are beautiful ,fresh etc Etc.in a lovely lounge area.
Rooms are lovely ,great big bed 

Only gripe we had to catch an 8 o'clock flight but breakfast is not served until 7 o'clock,can't even order room service until 7 .....????",5,2013,11,22
203,Fabulous,"What a hotel!! Only stayed one night but would've loved to have stayed longer! Fantastic staff  - incredibly helpful and always with a smile on their face. The location of this hotel is second to none in Dublin. The room was a little smaller then I expected but wasn't really an issue as because of the location and the fantastic areas within the hotel why would you want to ""hang out"" in your room!!?

Had dinner in the bar and the food was wonderful and the chef was so obliging to strange requests!!

Fab Fab Fab..... a 5* hotel at the top of it's game!! Might have been my first stay but most definitely won't be my last! I look forward to returning to this gorgeous establishment!",5,2013,11,17
203,"Great Location, wonderful customer service.","Stayed here some time ago with my two children and my friend. We got the train to Dublin and walked to the hotel. The foyer is up a small set of stairs from street level and was rather tatty looking and didn't appear 5 star!    Even though we looked like we had been living on the strees by this stage we received a warm welcome and were offered hot towels (with orchids palced on top!) upon arrival. Our bags were taken to our room, and even though we had no cash with us and couldn't tip the porter he was totally gracious. Customer service to me is the key, and we certainly had no complaints there. The room was perfectly clean and comfortable. New slippers, soft bed linen and an espresso machine in the room. No sachets of Nescaf√© here! The extra glazing on the windows prevented much of the street noise although the view wasn't particularly pretty. Quality toiletries in the bathroom and a telephone in case you needed to call reception whilst in the loo! 
We all had the best sleep ever in the king sized beds (of which there were two in the room). It really was blissful after a long day of shopping and sight-seeing. 
Breakfast next day was just mediocre because the deal I got didn't include a cooked breakfast so we ate in the public area where there was tea/coffee/wheaten bread/croissants/jam available. I think we maybe missed out on other things because we were down later than others. 
I would stay again because of the wonderful central location but more importantly, the great customer service which is a deal-breaker as far as I'm concerned.",4,2013,11,17
203,Excellent. Absolutely Excellent,"I stayed here on business for 2 nights in November 2013. The location is superb. Easy to get to if you have a sat nav in your car. Parking is not a problem and I'm talking the very centre of Dublin City. The location cannot be matched and definitely cannot be beaten...... The pedestrianised Grafton Street is outside the front door. It's the main shopping street in the country. 

The room was on the 4th floor and was spacious and what one would expect from a 5 star hotel. Wifi is free throughout.... Rooms comes equipped with what you would expect. The restaurant was excellent and Dinner was super. Afternoon tea is very popular here and again I found it top class.

The staff in this hotel make the place that bit extra special. There is a homely feel about the place and it is fantastically decorated for the festive season. 

Breakfast here is as good as I have ever had anywhere. 

Can't rate this place highly enough. Hats off to the Westbury.",5,2013,11,16
203,Not a 5-Star Hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the start of a tour featuring 5 star hotels.  Modern & hip but music was too loud throughout the hotel, i.e., lobby, elevators, etc. Food in restaurant was mediocre. Location was hard to drive to as it was in middle of pedestrian shopping area. Not impressed at all.",3,2013,11,15
203,Westbury Hotel 5* Luxury,"We stayed in the Westbury on a 3 Day City Break in November and it was 5* Luxury all the way.
The check in time was 3.00pm but having requested an early check in before arrival we were told the earliest it would be available was 1.30pm. We arrived at the Hotel early at 12.00pm and obviously the room wasn't ready so they took our luggage we checked in and they said they would ring us when the room was ready. We went down to Cafe Novo in the Hotel to have a coffee and 10 minutes later the mobile went and the room was ready.
The room was large airy. warm, big windows, modern and spotlessly clean. There was a huge flatscreen TV, very comfortable furnishings, the bathroom was large and had two sinks. Our luggage was already in the room waiting for us.
The concierge supplied us with local maps and excellent advise on which attractions were worth a visit and details of the best ways to get to them.
Every time we walked into or out of the hotel doors were opened for our passing, every member of staff greeted us as we passed and their demeanour was always cheery.
Every evening the bed was turned down, slippers and robes left out, a chocolate left on the pillow, a fresh bottle of mineral water and crystal glass left by each bedside.
All toiletries and all refreshments were replenished every day.
Breakfast was a triumph of a Hotel Breakfast. A continental option offered a ridiculous selection of cheeses, meats, quiches, yoghurt's, fruits, juices, cereals and pastries.
The Hot Breakfast had a plethora of options too from a Full Irish with a generous selection of the usual favourites through omelettes, muffins, waffles, pancakes etc etc.
We tried both the Hotels Restaurants and I will be reviewing them separately but suffice it to say they were both excellent.
Finally was the Hotel Cocktail Bar where we sampled probably a few too many exotic multi-coloured versions of liquid heaven but again the ambiance was perfect, the staff knowledgeable and effusive in their helpful manner. The free nibbles were almost a meal in themselves.
Location wise the Westbury is perfectly located for the main shopping drag of Grafton Street and very central for most of the main attractions which all seemed to be only a short walk away.",5,2013,11,15
203,Could not be bettered!,"Had a lovely weekend here, truly comfortable, luxurious and welcoming hotel. Friendly attentive service, great food and cocktails, I have never stayed in a better hotel in Dublin. We enjoyed the location, perfect for a short break in this great city. Can't wait to go back!",5,2013,11,13
203,Very enjoyable,"Stayed one night on a business trip and must agree this is one of the better hotels I have stayed in.  It is well situated, has character and the service is excellent. The room was very well appointed and very comfortable with a massive bed made for lounging in.  My only complaint is that I had an early flight to catch in the morning so couldn‚Äôt indulge myself more.  The staff were attentive without being sycophantic and seemed genuinely pleased to assist.  It will certainly be my prime choice for my next visit to the lovely city of Dublin.",5,2013,11,13
203,"Excellent stay, Perfect Location","Stayed at the Westbury this past weekend for 3 nights and was not disappointed.  Service was excellent, our suite was well appointed and spacious.  Location could not be better.  Situated just off Grafton Street and only a short walk to Temple Bar.  Also very close to Trinity College and multiple ""Hop on Hop off"" bus stops  Afternoon tea in the plush hotel lounge was wonderful and be sure to grab a drink at bar in front of the fire place.  

I would highly recommend the Westbury for your trip to Dublin and we will return on out next trip with out hesitation.",5,2013,11,12
203,An impressive 5 star experience,"I booked this hotel for my husband and me for one night as part of a reward to us (all work related :-) Before we arrived I contacted the hotel, telling them our story and shortly after we arrived, we received a lovely fruit basket and a personalised ""Well Done"" Card for my husband. That was a very nice touch and definitely made us smile. 
Our room was small but gorgeous. The bed was to die for. Our view was right onto Grafton Street so considering that this is a city hotel with limited views, the hotel once again delivered a promise to give us a good room with a view.
We didn't get to spend much time in the hotel as our event was happening in Dublin Castle but the little we saw was fantastic. The staff was always smiling and wherever possible addressed us with our names. These small touches are so important, so again, well done to the hotel.
The breakfast was amazing. If you don't feel like having a fry then you can eat your heart out on the impressive buffet.
We would definitely return to the Westbury and maybe next time we get a chance to have a proper look around this fabulous hotel!
Thanks to all at the Westbury!",5,2013,11,11
203,Great location and splendid breakfast!,"Just spent 5 nights at Westbury on a business trip. The location is fantastic, as it is right on Grafton street which has lots of shops, pubs and cafes. This allows for some after-work entertainment without needing to travel far.

The highlight of my stay must be the breakfast at Cafe Nova. I looked forward and enjoyed it as they served the most wonderful spread - perfect scones and pastries, cold cuts and fruits, and a delightful hot breakfast menu from which you can choose from grilled fish of the day, minute steak, full Irish breakfast, waffles, omelette etc.

My only grouse is the soft bed and the turn taps (hot) and (cold) in the room. Can never seem to get a good mix of hot and cold water. However, the room was cosy and from my room (620) I had a gorgeous view of Dublin city, which looked especially beautiful at sunrise.

Definitely recommend this hotel for the business traveller.",4,2013,11,10
203,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. Amazing service!,"I stayed here for two nights on business. From the moment I stepped foot through the door the service was impeccable, everyone was exceptionally polite, helpful and professional. 

The hotel is in a wonderful location, right in the centre with lots of shops and restaurants nearby.

The hotel is extremely comfortable, well decorated with a lovely cosy lounge area. The room too was very nice and had everything I needed; clean, quiet, nice little touches like chocolates and Nespresso coffee. Wifi was included.

I ate in the hotel several times and was very impressed with the standard of the food, the continental breakfast especially was lovely with homemade scones, breads and a large selection of fruits etc. Room service was also a very high standard which it often isn't even in good hotels. 

Overall a wonderful 5*hotel. I don't know about staying here again.. I want to move in!! :) ",5,2013,11,10
203,Lovely hotel,"Had a weekend here from Friday to Sunday 
The hotel is positioned in a lovely quite street just behind the main shopping area a mix of bars and lovely restaurants 
The staff are very attentive and polite,rooms clean and large enough to be comfortable 
A little expensive in the bars .
We will return the this little Gem
  ",5,2013,11,10
203,The only place to stay in Dublin?,"My wife and I have stayed at the Westbury on previous trips to Ireland. The Westbury never disappoints. Wonderful location, excellent and courteous staff, very comfortable rooms, and all of the amenities one would expect from a hotel of this caliber.
The restaurants are excellent, the service is very attentive.
The housekeeping staff does an outstanding job of room prep., not just for your arrival, but without fail every day.
The location puts you within easy reach of everything Dublin has to offer.
There are a number of good hotels in Dublin, but once we began to stay at the Westbury, there is just no other choice.
We will be staying here again next week before returning home to New York as the Westbury always makes you feel at home. It is our portal in and out of Ireland.",5,2013,11,09
203,Make sure you have GPS,"We enjoyed our stay at the Westbury. It has a modern feel in both the decor and ambience. Lobby and bar area are quite large, very accommodating for a cocktail or simply relaxing after your day. Rooms aren't large but give you adequate space. We liked the coffee machine in the room, although it wasn't working. Bathroom was very spacious and the decor is updated.

Here's what you need to know, while the address says Grafton, the property sits a half block off of the main area of Grafton Street. The website doesn't list a specific street number, so make sure you have either a very detailed map or GPS and just be prepared that even with these, you won't be able to find the hotel. The property is surrounded by one-way streets and trying to drive around the block is easily a 20 minute event. 

With a brand new GPS we made it to within a 2.5 block area. We walked the final few blocks to the hotel and the kind gentleman/valet went back with us to the car and successfully navigated the one-way and blocked streets for us.  This level of service is what earns the Westbury a spot in the top tier of hotels. 

",5,2013,11,08
203,Perfect location but don't expect much for service,"Pros: Was here for 7 nights for a business trip. The hotel is in an excellent location - it is situated just next to Grafton Street where it is the main shopping district in Dublin) and you can find shops and restaurants. The rooms are great. They are spacious, modern and plush. There is a night down service. 

I had some issues with housekeeping did not much replenish my water bottles regularly. Perhaps they saw that i had self purchased a bottle of mineral water but again so what? Just do your job and give me the bottle. The weather is so dry and I just need to drink more water!
Again, the hotel sells itself as a five star hotel but you just dont feel like it is a 5 star hotel. There is no facilities such as a gym or pool or spa. You gotta hop over to a small little gym opposite the hotel. And staff at Cafe Novo was not particularly polite no smiles nothing. Similarly for front desk. I was given twice wrong info on the charges for late check out. Was quite unpleased with the service - will feedback to my corporate team which manages our corporate hotels.

If i am here in Dublin again, i will head for the Marker Hotel.",4,2013,11,08
203,Excellent Service,"Entering the Westbury is a delightful if euphoric experience especially  in the lounge area upstairs;  this is a delight.  The staff members were graciousin every possible way; there was a graceful elegance all round.  We were there for afternoon tea and on being seated I was told immediately ' Sir, we need the table for 5.30pm'.  That was both unexpected and unwelcome especially for a hotel of this calibre; it was mid week!  The fare for the afternoon tea was well presented and well explained yet the service far outshone the quality of the food.  As I am unable to have white flour I asked for a brown scone which they did not have; no problem; I then asked for some brown bread; I had to ask a second time and was landed with two big chunks of bread a  different yet wholesome experience to the refinement of the sandwiches earlier. However the brown bread was stale.  You have a great deal going for you; some more consistency would be welcome please be gentle with us who look  forward  so muchto giving you our custom without putting a curfew on our stay.",3,2013,11,08
203,Luxury,"I wanted somewhere special to take my daughter before she emigrated to Australia.Well the westbury certainly fitted the bill,I cannot think of any negatives it was great thank you to all the staff for making our stay perfect.The beds were so comfy I felt like I was sleeping in a cloud!",5,2013,11,07
203,Always love staying here,"Even though I live in ireland. I'm a regular visitor to this hotel. I love the beds and service. From booking a room to check out the staff are great. Never a fuss and always do their best. 

The rooms are great, especially the suites. Spacious, modern and plush. I wish my own bedroom was like their rooms sometimes. Also one of the very few hotels with Air-con. (I'm weird, i like cold rooms, most hotels are far too warm).

The bar is a great place to enjoy the finer end of alcohol. trending but never too busy. Try the cocktails.",5,2013,11,07
203,Excellent,"originally I was booked into the shelbourne hotel (st Stephens green) but received an email 5 days before departure explaining that they had to move me to the westbury hotel 
We'll lucky me .... 
From start to finish the staff were nothing but polite and couldn't do enough for us.... 
The food was beautiful and worth every penny 
I cannot fault the hotel at all...our room was beautiful and well cleaned , with a cleaner returning in the evening to turn our bed down,we'll I thought I was something out of downtown abbey . 

We stayed to celebrate my 30th birthday .... And in our room there was a birthday card from the general manager and a card from the rest of the team , a plate that spelt out happy birthday in chocolate and little dessert treats . 

The front doorman was called Derek and would just like to say , what a lovely friendly man he is... He made us feel extremely welcome when we popped outside to the smokers corner . 

Well done to the westbury... 100% be returning",5,2013,11,06
203,Fabulous,We stayed here for one night and it was fabulous. It was a birthday treat for me and I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we drove up to the door - the service was excellent. The staff were helpful and polite. The room was lovely - we had a suite on the 6th floor. You would not know you were in the city centre. Breakfast was very good. I would recommend this to anyone looking for something special and it is in walking distance to the shops....,5,2013,11,05
203,Excellent stay in Dublin!,"Business trip With clients! I had been here before, and as then, the stay was excellent. Super service, great rooms and Perfect location. I will especially mention the attentive staff, a rare treat these days. Will definately come back!",5,2013,11,05
203,First impressions,"First impressions count and from the friendly greeting from the doorman to the warm towels at reception.We thought it would be good,but this is excellent.A comfortable room,even a Butlers chocolate on the bed!",5,2013,11,04
203,Always wonderful,"I have stayed at the Westbury 5 times, and each time it is excellent. Although a little pricey, it is certainly worth it. Attentive staff, beautiful rooms, location cannot be better. It is great that you can pop in and out if you are shopping on Grafton Street or visit the multitude of pubs and restaurants in very close walking distance. There is no better address in Dublin. I love the Westbury !",5,2013,11,04
203,All Hotels should aspire to this quality of service!,"I have just returned from my second stay at The Westbury Hotel and i cannot wait to return! Every aspect of my stay was five star. The staff were absolutely wonderful and courteous, i cannot praise them highly enough. The location is ideal for shopping particularly considering our Irish weather.The rooms are beautifully decorated, comfortable, cosy & clean. I cannot wait to return!",5,2013,11,03
203,Fabulous,"We stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is fabulous, ideal location in the centre of town. The staff were amazing and could not do enough for us. Would definitely recommend dinner here also. Book the hotel for a special occasion as it is pricey but to be expected due to the location.",5,2013,11,01
203,Wonderful Weekend,"We regularly stay at this hotel and when we leave we cannot wait until our next visit.  Every aspect of the experience is a pleasure, from the attentiveness of the staff, to the quality of the food.  Nothing is overlooked. The decor is beautiful.  Time spent in the lounge with a drink and a newspaper is such a relaxing experience.  Apart from afternoon tea, you can also have a main meal in the lounge.  Try and get a window table if you can and watch the hustle and bustle of Grafton Street whilst you enjoy your meal.  The one pleasure we haven't enjoyed yet is Christmas Afternoon Tea.  It is very popular I believe, so be sure to book early as they have huge waiting lists.

The hotel is extremely well located in the city to all amenities, and is a haven to return to when your feet get tired after some serious retail therapy.  You can also do some  ""celeb"" spotting at the hotel, we have been in the company of some interesting people during our various visits.  If it's good enough for them, it's good enough for me.

As one of the leading hotels of the world, do put it on your ""bucket list"" of things you must experience.",5,2013,10,31
203,business & pleasure the best !,"The Westbury is the hotel of choice for my business colleagues from the US. Frankly such is the welcome and the location that they also ensure family & friends stay there when visiting . On a personal level I have stayed at the Westbury for over 25 years , and regardless of the change in staffing , it has remained a favorite of mine and my family . A most recent anniversary stay was made very special by relatively junior staff members , who extended themselves well beyond the call of duty .. I was seriously impressed . I wouldn't consider any other hotel for business or my own personal stay in Dublin , and indeed we always use The Kennsington in London another Doyle hotel.!",5,2013,10,31
203,Can't Beat the Location,"The Westbury is a great hotel.  The rooms were adequate although not huge, and a king sized bed would have been nice, but perhaps we didn't pay enough to get that.  Our a/c never did completely cool the room, although it was bearable.  They did check it out but all the guy did was clean the filter, which did nothing.  The complimentary water was nice, but we never did get the coffee machine to work.  Breakfast was super and service everywhere was very good.  As everyone else has pointed out, you sure can't beat the location, as you can walk to pretty much everything you need.  A pool sure would have been nice.",5,2013,10,30
203,my view,Just returned from the westbury as part of my 50th birthday celebrations my husband an I spent the first 2 nites in a 4 star hotel on the outskirts of dublin which we have stayed in on numerous occasions before and as it has been awarded best hotel in ireland 2013/2014 decided to return but as a special treat thought would book a third night 5** city centre as we had never experienced 5* before arrived 1.30 pm an as I appreciate check in is 3pm the girl on reception said our room was not ready but she would put us on a priorty waiting list so checked us in she made no reference to any details of my booking on giving me my receipt i explained to her that my rate included a treatment in brown thomas and 2 glasses of processo would I need vouchers for the same to which she advised as i was aware my treatment was booked an my processo voucher would be in my room so we decided to wait in the bar area but never was called until we asked at 3 pm if our room was ready on arrival in our room there was a voucher but it was a special treat from my friend for 2 glasses of bolengier champagne and not the voucher that was included in my booking of which we would have used while we waited for our room to be ready if we had been offered it .A lovely plate of treats with happy birthday greetings an card was delivered compliments of hotel to our room shortly after arrival which i appreciated and was a lovely touch but we had again to ask re our voucher for processo only to be told need ask reception which by this stage felt like we had to beg for it an after the generousity of my friend with her treat we used it before going for dinner again approched reception before we left for dinner and they said will bring you in voucher as we where only staying one night I'm afraid my processo voucher came back home with me hotel excellent location staff lovely but attention 2 detail on a booking on check in could be better for 5 star small issue but after paying 255 euros for my booking for one night I expected better,4,2013,10,29
203,Great Location,"Stayed for 4 nights (double room), very well located, just off Grafton Street. Plenty of restaurants, shops, etc.. on the door step. Rooms are well-proportioned, decent bath/shower, all very clean. Complimentary bottles of water, tea and coffee making facilities (real coffee Nespresso). 
Did not really use the facilities much, had late breakfasts in local establishments. The staff were all very friendly, informative and helpful. Would definitely recommend this Hotel.",4,2013,10,29
203,"Really nice hotel, not so happy with service.....","The hotel is centrally located almost on Grafton street. Very nice hotel, classic design and really well kept. Good detail is that you have a europen plug in the room in case you forgot the adapter to UK plugs ;) Rooms are OK size nad good quality of the internt Connection.

Check in very smooth and good service and support from concierge. 

BUT.... Was in the hotel bar/cafe Nova (think that was the name) a couple of times... EVERY time had to wait a long time to get any attention to place my order....The high modern chairs are made from metal and have sharp cut edges under the seat...I cut my hand when sitting on the chair and even then when it was bleeding the waiter was not very focused to apologize, I had to ask myself to get some band aid...

So only had issues with the bar/cafe, otherwise really good stay,",4,2013,10,28
203,excellent hotel in the center of the city,sadly we only stayed one night in dublin but we were fortunate to stay at the westbury. the staff could not have been more accommodating and friendly.. we arrived after a long drive at about 8 pm ...we had made some changes to a prior reservation and they changed everything for us without a fuss and for this night they gave us a great upgrade.. we were pleased that internet was free and valet parking was efficient and only 20 euros.. they even brought us room service coffee early in the morning ..... the location was perfect for seeing the city... i will definitely be back to dublin and i will definitely be staying here,5,2013,10,28
203,Awesome as usual,"Just had a w/e break here and as usual it was awesome. My husband and I got married from here a couple of years ago and we mentioned it when they asked if we had stayed before. Soon after a card and fruit platter arrived at our room. The staff are so kind, I love it",5,2013,10,28
203,Perfect Location,I selected the Westbury Hotel for our 3-night stay in Dublin based on TripAdvisor reviews and was not disappointed.  A lovely hotel with just the right amount of luxury -- comfortable not stuffy.  The staff were excellent.  We loved the bar for an after dinner drink.  Our room was roomy and relaxing.,5,2013,10,27
203,Brilliant!,One word: excellent! Staff were so friendly and attentive. Nothing was too much effort. Location was great.  The room was spacious and spotlessly clean.  Breakfast was lovely and there was a great selection of food on offer.  Overall a great stay and I will definitely be back!,5,2013,10,27
203,Outstanding Service! Great location! Highly recommend,"We had just come from 4 nights at Clontarf Castle (not recommended) and quickly fell in love with the Westbury. Great service experience from the moment we pulled up at the curb through checkin. Staff was attentive, gracious and helpful. We were immediately set at ease.

Location is fantastic with many shops, restaurants and options that are walkable. It was so convenient why would we need a car. We didn't as buses, taxies and walking are easy from here.

The room was clean, well appointed and tasteful. Robes, slippers and water ready for us. It was enjoyable and we would stAy here again without question.",5,2013,10,26
203,Afternoon tea,"Reserved an afternoon tea for two which didn't disappoint. On a positive note the sandwiches, pastries, and scones were excellent. I, however, would have preferred a more intimate atmosphere rather than the main lobby which is very open. Service was good but it was a very busy Saturday afternoon so a bit delayed. Lovely for a special occasion.",5,2013,10,26
203,Great hotel with lovely staff,"We stayed there for a quiet night away for a special occasion and were delighted with our choice. The hotel rang me a few days in advance of our stay to confirm what time we wished to dine in their restaurant and at that stage I advised them of the reason of our stay. We were thrilled to arrive to a very thoughtful card, bottle of champagne and some delicious bites.

The room was very clean and comfortable with a view towards Grafton Street. We had a lovely romantic meal in the restaurant and the following morning a scrumptious breakfast the next morning.The staff were very pleasant and accommodating.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2013,10,25

203,Loved my stay at the Westbury,"Just checked out of the Westbury in Dublin after a five night stay.  I can't wait to return.  The service was warm and impeccable.  Everyone made me feel welcomed and cared for.  The room was absolutely lovely, luxuriously appointed and very clean.  The location is perfect.  All of the city is accessible on foot from the Westbury.  The area is safe and well lit for night walking - even when travelling alone.  I arrived in Dublin early morning and the staff was able to let me in my room by 9:00 am.  This was a wonderful surprise!  I highly recommend the Westbury and their welcoming staff!",5,2013,10,24
203,Very grand with great staff,"Decor - traditional if slightly old fashioned. 
Lobby - a sense of occasion. Lovely atmosphere. Jazz music in lifts a bit too loud though.  
Rooms - luxurious, comfortable 
Customer service - best in class. Staff went out of their way to help. 
Would I stay again? Absolutely.

203,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful location","Luxury right in the heart of Dublin, just off Grafton Street.  The staff were superb - welcoming and attentive.  I loved the hot face-cloth at check-in after a long flight.  The room was on the small side, but adequate and very well serviced.  Breakfast was outstanding.  Afternoon tea at the Westbury is an event.",5,2013,10,23
203,"Third time at Westbury, impressed every time!","We stayed at the westbury on saturday 19 october, from the minute you check in you are treated like you are the most important person in dublin at that time! Our room was ready early, luggage delivered to room within ten mins even though hotel was fully booked and reception very busy.  Dinner in the restaurant was amazing, service could not be faulted and the food was delicious.
Breakfast again got ten out of ten!
Great location for exploring dublin and make sure you have a cocktail in the marble bar before you leave!",5,2013,10,21
203,One out of two ain't bad.....,"Stayed for two nights. Overall was a lovely hotel experience and I would definitely stay again but a sleepless Friday night due to noise and the beautiful marble bar was out of bounds due to a large Accountancy firm taking it over sullied the weekend slightly. The Duty Manager however pulled out all the stops , changed our room and provided Champagne Afternoon Tea as a sweetener to apologise which was gladly accepted. Breakfast on Sunday we had to wait over 30 minutes to be seated and guests were left waiting and a hazardous system employed of who was lucky to get throu the doors to eat. This hotel is beautiful and in a great location but I feel they were slightly over stretched with the number of guests last weekend.",4,2013,10,21
203,Afternoon tea (one gluten free),"We had booked for afternoon tea on a Saturday afternoon.  Overall it was good, but let itself down on the ""chantilly"" sweet cream instead of clotted cream for the scones.  We also had to keep asking for things, like tea strainer, more tea etc.  It was, overall, good but have had better.",3,2013,10,21
203,"Excellent location, fine hotel","The Westbury Hotel is a fine place to stay in Dublin. Service is professional and accommodating. Rooms are attractive , quiet and sufficiently large. Location is fabulous, be it for business, shopping or dining. Lobby area is quite accommodating for meetings, coffee  or drink. Only challenge is reaching the hotel during rush hour as the small local streets get quite congested. ",5,2013,10,20
203,Very nice hotel,"The hotel is very nice and the service impeccable from start to finish.  However, the gym was very disappointing.  Even though there is a gym across the street that guests can use for a fee, I prefer to use a gym at the hotel.  I would've given it five stars if the hotel had a better gym and had it opened at 6:00 AM instead of 7:00 AM.  The location is excellent - right off Grafton Street.",4,2013,10,20
203,"If you expect a good night's sleep, forget it!","Last night I stayed in The Westbury. I hadn't stayed there for several years. A colleague of mine was over from the USA for a conference so, I thought it convenient to stay in the same hotel. I travelled from Galway and, despite regular trips to Dublin, could not negotiate getting my car to the front door. I abandoned the opportunity of ""free"" parking and found the Stephen's Green car park nearby. Arriving at 7.30 I booked in to room 338. It was small, efficient, but not what is expected of a five star hotel. I tried to leave a personal message at my colleague's room to be informed that facility was not available. The concierge would be happy to leave a message under his door. This is 2013!
That evening I decided to stay in the hotel, tired from a week's heavy work. A night cap at 9.20pm and I was off to bed so I made my way to the bar to be stopped at the entrance and informed the bar was reserved for a private function. As a resident I could have a drink in the public area in front of the bar. I gave up and was too exhausted to argue. At least I had a room with a good night's rest ahead of me, or so I thought.
Ten pm, lights out and gone in a flash. Anticipating a busy start from 6.15am at least I felt I would be fresh and ready for the conference in the morning.
Ten twenty pm, awakened to noise and laughter next door. Definitely more than two in the room. Concierge contacted. ""Sorry, we'll see what we can do"". Despite three more calls, it all continued. The walls seem to be paper thin. Fortunately I had brought an old fashioned transistor radio, turned on Lyric FM and went unconscious. 
The next morning I felt as if I was the colleague who had travelled from the USA. I was exhausted. Breakfast was standard fare. I used express check-out rather than expend any more frustration with an innocent receptionist. I signed for the 20 euro bill for breakfast, having assumed it was covered by the express payment. The waitress chased me out the door to inform me that it could not be added to the bill, so my colleague paid the bill. Further shame for me! I did not raise my voice or express my feelings to the lady as she was just doing her job.
I will not return",1,2013,10,19
203,Fantastic staff,"My husband and I had a fantastic stay in the Westbury. They really know how to make you feel special, from beginning to end every staff member was extremely friendly and helpful, have stayed in a lot of hotels and this is one of the best. Rooms were beautiful, will definitely be back.",5,2013,10,18
203,Great Hotel,"My wife and I spent our last night in Dublin at the Westbury Hotel and loved it.  The location is ideal to be in the centre of Dublin and close to Trinity College.  The room was clean, quiet and very comfortable.  We were made to feel very welcome.  Will definately visit the Westbury next time in Dublin.",5,2013,10,17
203,Best hotel in Dublin,It has a brilliant location- just off Dublin's Grafton Street. It has a nice atmosphere and nice reception area. The rooms are outstanding and the Nescaf√© coffee machine is a nice touch. The bar/restaurant is nice but not the best. The service is by far the best I've seen- the concierge is very nice as are the cleaning staff and the doorman will even park your car for you. I would recommend this to anyone who is staying in Dublin.,5,2013,10,16
203,The Perfect Hotel for that Special Occasion,We recently stayed in the Westbury for a weekend to celebrate our wedding anniversary - having stayed there on our wedding night some years in the past. We could not compliment the hotel enough from the minute I gave my cars keys to the concierge to park my car to the time I was given those keys back we were treated to exemplorary service that is far superior to other five star hotels that we have stayed in. The bedroom was very comfortable and spacious. The staff were very friendly and attentive to our needs. Breakfast was an event with such a huge choice and variety on offer that really set us up for the day of shopping and sight seeing - made all the easier by the central location of the Westbury - right off Grafton Street - which allowed us to come back and forward to the hotel as if we were coming home. We were also able to take in an excellent play in the Abbey Theatre before returning to the Westbury for some cocktails and bed. We will be back to stay at the Westbury!,5,2013,10,16
203,Excellent service,"Service in respect of attentiveness,courtesy,and genuine attempt to put the customer first, was first class.
Some other service providers in Dublin would do well to note the high standard of customer service provided by The Westbury Hotel.",5,2013,10,14
203,Wonderful Westbury in the heart of Dublin,"We stayed at the Westbury during our visit to Dublin. As other's have mentioned, the location is central and right by Grafton Street. An easy walk to Trinity, Temple Bar, St. Stephens Green, and the national archives. We only needed a taxi for one dinner during our stay, everything else was easy access.

We stayed in a suite room and the accomidations were large and very comfortable. The hotel staff were very helpful. We did not try the resturant (as we had our own favorites in Dublin) but the trip back will include dinner as well as Sunday High Tea.

I strongly recommend the Westbury when you visit Dublin.",5,2013,10,14
203,A welcome place to visit right in the heart of Grafton Street,"after lunch  today we visited the Westbury lounge upstairs for a quick drink, we alway's make a point of calling there as it is right in the heart of the busy Grafton street.the staff are all very pleasent and attentive. its just what you need after a busy shopping trip.",5,2013,10,13
203,"Wonderful stay,staff, and location.","Recently stayed at the Westbury on a trip to Ireland, Staff were all so welcoming,helpful and cheerful, especially Hasel at the front desk she was a gem. Rooms are beautiful, spacious and clean. Location is perfect - although it was hard to find initially. Would definitely recommend this spot if in Ireland! We loved our stay, thank you to everyone who works at the Westbury hotel!! ",5,2013,10,11
203,Fantastic Stay,"We stayed at this hotel for 2nights to celebrate my birthday and had a fab time.  The service was excellent and our room was beautiful.  The location of the hotel is brilliant.  Shops, bars & restaurants are just on your doorstep.  I also had champagne & a card from all the staff in my room on arrival as I was celebrating my birthday.  It was a lovely touch.  We will definitely be back!!",5,2013,10,10
203,Last minute stay,"Just to say I would highly recommend this hotel, fine old world yet modern, silver service with a smile! You know that feeling when you feel good leaving hotel? Well yes got it here.
Hazel at reception was very professional and helpful, super friendly.",5,2013,10,10
203,Anniversary Weekend,We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night recently. We had an absolute fab weekend. The hotel is at the centre of everything. Close to loads of lovely restuarants and pubs for late night entertainment. Any staff we met in the hotel were all so pleasant and friendly. We would highly recommend this hotel. Everywhere was spotless and well decorated. Our room was perfect and we heard no noise from outside. We will definitely be back. Can't wait!!,5,2013,10,09
203,Great hotel and pillows,We stayed at The Westbury our last night in Ireland on Holiday.  It was a relaxing experience.  I want to buy the pillows.  The location is superb and the staff was outstanding.  The bar help was a little slow but that seems to be the standard.,5,2013,10,08
203,Lovely.,"The location is terrific and the accommodation is everything you would expect of a top hotel.  We were unable to have afternoon tea as it was fully booked, so I would advise anyone to book ahead if you want to partake in that (it looked superb).",5,2013,10,08
203,Afternoon tea,"Had afternoon tea for 2. We were really well looked after from the moment we arrived. Seated overlooking Grafton St, the trio platter arrived with a selection of sandwiches, followed by fresh scones and a multitude of sweetness. The challenge got larger as we went up the tiers! Unlimited tea and coffee too... Recommended! ",5,2013,10,07
203,Extraordinary,This place was magnificent. Like staying in an intimate bed and breakfast but with all the amenities of a large scale hotel. Location is convenient to everything. Absolutely loved it and the staff was extremely nice and helpful. Will definitely stay here again!,5,2013,10,05
203,A Return Visit,"We recently enjoyed a very nice evening in The Westbury Hotel. I was surprised that the mixers in the bar were brands that were unknown to me. No Schweppes? The food in the dining room was very tasty , however the portions were a bit small for my liking. The staff were very attentive and very good. Overall a good meal but watch the portion size.",4,2013,10,05
203,Excellent location,Lovely hotel with a great location. Rooms spotless and well appointed. Nice restaurant but a little pricey and may be worth going elsewhere with such good restaurants close by. Great location for a shopping trip. Don't miss the afternoon tea. ,5,2013,10,04
203,Great hotel,"My partner and I had a wonderful weekend in Dublin staying at The Westbury. We were celebrating our anniversary and I informed The Westbury. From the time we checked in and until we checked out, it was great service. What makes us return time and time again to this great hotel for our anniversary in Dublin is the service by the staff which makes it special. It is the little touches and the thought that goes into them, such as welcoming us with a special card and chocolates in our room and the staff remembering it was our anniversary, that makes this hotel stand out from the rest. It is in an excellent city centre location, clean rooms with first class service. Thank you Andrea, Vincent and everyone at The Westbury. We hope to see you soon.

London, UK",5,2013,10,04
203,Great Hotel,"Great location, great staff and very clean and comfortable. a must if you are staying in Dublin for business or pleasure. Walking distance to Grafton street and all good resturants in the area. I stayed in the Conrad before and although it is as clean it was a little distant from the hub "" Grafton Street""",5,2013,10,04
203,Excellent city centre hotel,"This is a lovely hotel for city living.  Superb location just off grafton street and so near all the great bars and restaurants on South William Street.  We stayed here in July and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Our room was small but perfectly formed.  My hubbie dlslikes showers in the bath but this doesn't bother me in a city centre hotel.
We had a smooth check-in and were given a glass of champagne (delivered to the room) as a weclome gift - really nice touch.
We had breakfast the next morning in the little cafe.  It was continental style and was very good.  Friendly service.
We used the hotel carpark which is small but perfectly formed and adds an extra layer of convenience to the stay.

We shall return!",5,2013,10,04
203,Hospitality at best,"Just today I am bk from my week long holiday from Ireland . I stayed at westbury for 3 nights . One of the best hotel situated in main shopping & restaurant & bar area very classy hotel with own parking , excellent room , top of the notch services & ready to help staff . Rooms & new , clean & fresh I will suggest one can stay here at any time during any season . I will give 5/5 marks to westbury .",5,2013,10,03
203,Great Dublin city location,"Put yourself right in the middle of the excitement of staying in Dublin, Grafton street. Easy walk to everything at a great hotel. The room was comfortable, nice bed and excellent toiletries! The staff were all very welcoming and helpful. Just a quick overnight but well worth it to stay here. Recommend and I'm looking forward to staying there again.",5,2013,10,02
203,Great stay ,"My wife and I stayed for our anniversary. The staff were excellent, and even left a note in our room to congratulate us. The bed was super comfy. I had eggs benedict for breakfast. Perfectly cooked and unsurprisingly delish. ",5,2013,10,01
203,Convenient and lovely,Just returned from a weekend at the Westbury. The location cannot be beat and the service we received was excellent. We were on our honeymoon and the manager sent up a bottle of bubbly to celebrate. We drank it while enjoying our fantastic city views.,5,2013,10,01
203,The Best,"In town for a family wedding and we chose to stay at The Westbury.  I've stayed previously at The Shelbourne and The Merrion and I have to say that I don't think after this weekend I would ever stay anywhere else again.  The location is simply unbeatable.  The rooms are elegant and the staff are the best...friendly, helpful, super professional.  Afternoon tea in the chic, buzzy lobby lounge was a highlight.  Already looking forward to our next visit.",5,2013,09,30
203,Wouldn't Stay Anywhere else!!!!!!!!!!,"We have just arrived back in Australia from our trip to Ireland and Scotland. I was so impressed with this hotel that I wrote a review the day we were leaving. I had to follow up on our arrival back home just to say again how wonderful this hotel is. It combines the personal treatment you receive from a small boutique hotel along with all the amenities from a large hotel. The food, the service, the room were all so so perfect. Our five night stay was fantastic. Thank you to all the friendly wonderful staff along with the Guest Relations Manager, Joseph Downing, who was an absolute gentleman and his personal service was highly appreciated. Nothing was ever too much trouble. The hotel was amazingly comfortable and well located to everything.",5,2013,09,29
203,Very Nice Hotel!! Close to Everything!!!,"This hotel was in an area that was close to everything!!  Walk right out the front door and there was a very nice pub, and there were shops for souvenirs all over the place.  The hotel is very clean and all of the staff were very professional!!  The only problem that I had was because it was downtown, you could hear the people on the street late at night.  Other than that I had no issues with this place.  Like I said it was close to EVERYTHING!!!",4,2013,09,28
203,Well worth the price,"This place is relaxed, luxurious and located in the middle of the city. Arrival at the front door is the beginning of the wonderful service which extends from the concierge through to the room servicing staff.
Nothing is too much trouble. Our room was a little small, but very well appointed. All the things you would expect plus a rather good Nespresso machine. Breakfast was great and again service was wonderful. Only complaint was the poached egg that was as solid as the toast. Still didn't stop me giving this an excellent rating though. Well done to everyone at the Westbury. Your team effort made our stay memorable.",5,2013,09,28
203,Great hotel,"This hotel has a great location, its a good hotel for a city, it has very good food the only problem is the organization with the breakfast they have two restaurants and one costs and the other doesnt the best thing about this hotel i think is the location ",5,2013,09,27
203,Expensive but worth it,Shear class from the reception through the halls to the room. Definately reflected in the cost. Which is fair considering its right on the main shopping street. The staff are faultless. Greeted at the door by the concierge who parked the car and brought the luggage up to the room. The rooms are very elegant indeed with more than generous floor space in the suites. Air conditioning was more than adequate. Just set the temperature on the digital control and relax as the room stabilises to your requirements very quickly.  I really cannot sing their praises highly enough. A truely quality establishment on all fronts. Even the room service breakfast was top notch,5,2013,09,27
203,Reunion For Us And Introduction For Our Children,"Love Dublin our home away from home! The Westbury is luxury at its best yet gives off a very warm and fuzzy feeling as well! Perfect location in the heart of the city, fabulous staff so willing to help with anything and everything from an umbrella, directions, places to dine, and absolutely the best service within the hotel! We brought our three children and their spouses for their first Dublin experience and they were blown away and loved their Westbury experience!",5,2013,09,27
203,a quiet rest,"we stayed in this hotel and from the moment we arrived to when we left everything was top class.when we checked in the lady informed us we had been upgraded to a suite which was a lovely touch.the room was fantastic ,it even ha a t.v. in the bathroom.Every night there was a choclate left on the bed and the bed turnedown.the breakfast was on of the best  I've had with a wide range of food (something to please everyone)and I dare  say nobody will ever go hungry here.The lounge in the evening is a lovely place to relax and have a coffee or a drink, it has a very calming feel about it .Overall a really great hotel.",5,2013,09,26
203,2 Great Nights at The Westbury Hotel,"The Westbury Hotel is a luxury hotel in Dublin.  We enjoyed our stay.  The service and the food were excellent.  It is right in the heart of Dublin.  The staff was very attentive to our needs.  The only down side was the check in which was rather late in the afternoon.  All in all, we liked the hotel and its staff.",5,2013,09,25
203,A great hotel - happy staff and vey happy guests,"Lovely rooms, modern, bright and beautiful decor & great food - we also loved the brasserie/cafe downstairs but best of all the happy and helpful staff just made our stay.  Travelling with exuberant 3 year old but felt welcomed and relaxed. A 5* hotel as they all should be.",5,2013,09,25
203,A struggle to rate any aspect below EXCELLENT,"We had two studio suits in this wonderful hotel last month for my family of six. I just walked in from grafton st to book one week in advance for our stay. The reception staff were very professional and absolutely courteous in all their handling of my booking. I already gauged the upcoming stay experience from just that. That was just a fraction of the experience of our stay. 
Upon arrival the bell captain, the reception, all staff were just great. The rooms are top class and I have been a guest in palace like hotels elsewhere around the world. The staff at all levels were all attentive, kind, and welcoming I was amazed how a city center hotel can have such service. 
The studio suits are spacious and wonderfully appointed with great design and amenities. The bathrooms are first class. 
We all enjoyed our stay with key aspect being service as first.  The checkout staff even made the experience more exceptional. Checking out at 5.30am and getting happy and attentive staff just sealed our super star experience. 
My final word: if in Dublin looking for top and super star service look no further than Westbury. Excellent location and service. ",5,2013,09,25
203,Elegant,"I can only describe this hotel as fabulous.
We spend two night exploring Dublin and it was a treat to go back to the hotel, the location is in a perfect location.
The staff were very helpful and friendly, the restaurant was excellent, a breakfast to die for.
We stayed in a room designed for disabled use and I can only say that the bathroom was not to the same standard as other rooms in our party.",4,2013,09,25
203,Afternoon Tea at the Westbury,"The Westbury is a really beautiful hotel right in the hustle and bustle of Dublin's Grafton street.
I had a friend meeting me in Dublin from Amsterdam and we were celebrating her 30th birthday. As part of that, I had booked afternoon tea here. I let them know in advance that we were celebrating a special occasion and the fantastic staff went out of their way to make it a really special day: we had a wonderful table with a view of the high street, the service was impeccable and they brought us a little cupcake on a plate that was decorated with happy birthday! We went for the champagne afternoon tea for 36euros which I thought was really good value for money considering some of the other places Ive had tea at. As regards the content of the spread itself, (whilst I hate to say it it)- I found the sandwiches particulary average, but the fruit scones, petit fours and macaroons where to die for! I particularly liked the passionfruit one! In such beautiful surroundings and with such attentive hosts, I would definately recommend spending an afternoon at the Westbury!",4,2013,09,25
203,A Fine Stay,"Excellent hotel. Wonderful, friendly service. The staff at all levels are terrific! The small downstairs restaurant is great (try the fish and chips). Also a perfect location for strolling around the heart of the city. Will be back !",4,2013,09,24
203,Perfect weekend away,"Provided a lovely base to our weekend trip to Dublin. The city had so much to offer and 3 days wasn't enough. The staff and facilities were exactly what you would expect from a 5* hotel. The Whiskey lounge and bar was lovely for a pre night cocktail or post night whiskey and the breakfast was perfect. 
A real 5 star hotel :)
",5,2013,09,24
203,Great trip to DublinThe Westbury was perfect,"This is a really terrific hotel.
Location in the thick of town is superb. You walk everywhere. Service was A+. Every request was granted and quickly delivered. Room was a lovely suite with a nice view of the city. I'll be back!",5,2013,09,22
203,The Anniversary to remember,"Thank you all at the Westbury Hotel Dublin, especially Rachael working with guest relations for you personal assistance, organizing arrangements prior to my arrival on our special day.

I am pleased to say that we will be returning to The Westbury Hotel in the near future.

Thank you all again for a memorable stay!",5,2013,09,22
203,"Stunning Hotel, Perfect Location. I Wouldn't Stay Anywhere Else Now!","The Westbury is perfectly located in the heart of Dublin, offering everything at your doorstep. It's a stunning hotel with generously sized, luxurious rooms. Exceptional service. Stunning lobby. Everything about it is fantastic.",5,2013,09,21
203,"Great location, beautiful rooms and fabulous staff!","We stayed at the Westbury Hotel in August.  The location was perfect!  The room were absolutely gorgeous and extremely comfortable. The hotel was in a central location to shopping, eating and sight seeing.   I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to the Dublin area!",5,2013,09,21
203,Beautiful Hotel,I loved this hotel. It is top drawer. It also has a great location and easy underground parking for guests. From the moment you arrive you are well looked after. It's the little details that leave you feeling very special.,5,2013,09,21
203,The Perfect Dublin Hotel,"Located just off of Grafton Street, this hotel has it all, great location, great facilities, and an absolutely superb staff.  The rooms are tastefully decorated and perfectly maintained.  The restaurant and coffee shop serve great cuisine and high tea in the lobby is an event not to be missed.   The service in these facilities as well as the bar is exceptional.  No matter how busy the staff is, no one appears to be ""rushed.""  The Business Center has everything necessary to function away from the office, and is available day and night.  In all my travels around the world, I have never seen a front desk and concierge staff more professional and committed to customer service.  I will come back to Dublin, and I most certainly stay at the Westbury.",5,2013,09,18
203,Very friendly and helpful,"This hotel is not only very centrally placed in Dublin being two minutes walk from Grafton Street, but also has excellent accommodation with really friendly and helpful staff.  I will use again and would definitely recommend.",5,2013,09,18
203,Perfect location!!!,"We stayed at the Westbury Hotel for a few days at the end of August.  We read that this hotel was in a great location, but were absolutely shocked at just how perfect the location was!  We walked to everything and only took a cab to and from the airport.

The hotel itself is gorgeous and the hotel staff is beyond friendly.  One weird thing that happened (no fault of the hotel) was our room looked out onto the store room of the store across the steet.  My first night there I had jetlag and woke up at like 3 am.  I was just gazing out the window when I thought I saw someone sitting in a window staring at me...they simply would not stop!!!  As the sun came up, I realized it was a mannequin from the store!  So, just be warned of the headless mannequins!!!

The Marble Bar was beautiful and the bartenders were so friendly.  I wish I could remember their names, but all I can remember is the girl was from Austria the guy was from Poland.  They were so wonderful and deserve some recognition.

We ate breakfast twice and the food was very good and filling.  Just a warning, though, we don't drink coffee or tea.  One morning I ordered a soda water (just one) thinking they would just charge me for that, but they applied the coffee/tea/juice fee of EUR8.50.  That was one expensive soda water!!!  Also, that morning, we paid our bill at the table, but then discovered it had also been billed to our room.  The hotel quickly rectified that and without any incident.  

I would highly recommend the Westbury Hotel to anyone visiting Dublin!  If we return, this is where we will be staying for sure.",4,2013,09,17
203,Beautiful Hotel Brilliant Staff,"Thoroughly enjoyed our recent short stay in The Westbury Hotel Dublin. Central location, luxurious hotel, friendly efficient staff and great food. Afternoon tea was delicious, the Marble Bar was cosy with a wide choice of cocktails and snacks. Breakfast was perfect and the rooms were well equipped with tea & coffee making facilities. The bedrooms were spotlessly clean and well appointed with such a comfortable bed. I just can't wait to re-visit.",5,2013,09,17
203,It's all about the service,"In the last two years I have spent no less than 100 nights each year in 5 star hotels on business and for a personal trip with my family recently opted for the Westbury in Dublin. Whilst the rooms and hotel itself were certainly nice, the stand out for me was exemplary service. Not just one individual when checking in or one of the team at the concierge desk, everyone even down to those cleaning the rooms are single mindedly focused on a positive experience for the guest. 

The management team leading these staff are to be congratulated, it made for a truly exceptional stay and I would whole heartedly recommend the Westbury to any family looking for a high end hotel in the heart of Dublin. The rooms, facilities, restaurants and MOST importantly the staff are fantastic!",5,2013,09,15
203,Great location in the heart of the action.,"We stayed one night here in early september. We arrived early around 9am and they were able to accommodate us with a room right away which was great as we were tired from our overnight flight. 

The decor of the property is that of a luxury hotel. The lobby and common areas are nicely set up and get busy for afternoon tea which i recommend. 

The staff were very nice for the most part. The front desk agent was very nice and followed up with me on an issue even after i checked out.  

The room itself was not the greatest. Being that i am GHA platinum i was hoping for a better accommodation. The room didn't have separate bath and shower  and the beds were too soft like sinking into quick sand. I also had to keep the drapes closed due to the bank of other rooms being able to see right in if they wanted. Otherwise the room was nice. 

The best thing about the hotel is central location right in the hear of Dublin and near a lot of the action. Overall i would stay here again but would either book a higher level room or hope that an upgrade would be issued on my gha status. 

Thanks westbury staff",5,2013,09,15
203,The Westbury Hotel / Dublin,"Extraordinary in every way!  Exceptional property, location, cleanliness, staff and service.  Within walking distance to Grafton Street shopping area, Trinity College, Hop On/Hop Off Bus pickup, St. Stephen's Green, St. Stephen's Green Shopping Mall, O'Connell Street Bridge and shopping area, College Green, Temple Bar area, Dublin Castle, Chester Beatty Library and many other sites. The hotel and surroundings are spotless and I cannot say enough about the attentiveness of the wonderful hotel staff and the remarkable service. First time visit to Dublin, but will NOT be my last.  LOVED IT!",5,2013,09,14
203,Great location,"Nice hotel, great staff  very, very helpful.  Small room and bathroom.  Irritating music playing in the elevator.  Breakfast staff needs work but food is good.  Nice amenities.  The afternoon tea was very nice and a great experience.  We did enjoy our stay at the hotel.",4,2013,09,13
203,The Westbury Grafton Street is Excellence Defined,"We stayed at the Westbury for two nights in July.  The entire hotel from the lobby to the rooms are just amazing!  The chandeliers are incredible.  The Westbury is one of the Leading Hotels of the World and we were treated way beyond our expectations.  We enjoyed High Tea one day and dined in the restaurant for both lunch and dinner.  We had a suite and it was large enough to be considered a studio!  The bath tub is so deep and relaxing!  Most importantly, the staff is always kind and courteous and ready to meet every need.  I have been a frequent visitor to Dublin over many years, including the Shelbourne, and I have now found a place that is truly much better than any hotel in Dublin in which I have stayed.  The location right off Grafton Street means that shops, restaurants, Temple Bar, and St. Stephen's Green are within minutes by a short walk.  The concierge was excellent and made great recommendations.  I highly recommend this hotel over any other if you are considering luxury in Dublin.",5,2013,09,13
203,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed in four cities throughout Ireland, and this was our favorite hotel. The room was large, with good use of space, nice bathroom, great walk-in closet, and the bed was comfortable. The staff was very friendly, and the lobby and other common areas were impressive.",5,2013,09,13
203,Short break,Was looking forward to staying at this hotel as the reviews were so good. Staff generally pleasant but it was all a bit corporate in other words a bit manufactured. The silicone jointing under the shower in the bath was black with mould and bathroom extract very inefficient. On the plus side the central location was excellent parking was available and the room air conditioned.,3,2013,09,13
203,Superior in Every Way,"From the moment you cross the threshold of this gorgeous hotel, you feel like you are being embraced by luxury, professional but warm and friendly staff, and very comfortable accommodations. The room was an excellent value. Extremely well appointed with a modern, yet classic decor.  The bed was so comfortable. The linens and towels were of the highest quality. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying their stay here.",5,2013,09,13
203,A birthday treat at the Westbury,"I was staying at the Westbury for my birthday weekend 31/8/13(arranged by my family) and boy what a treat! The service was amazing, I even got a birthday card and goodies from the hotel staff including a glass of Proseco at breakfast! I was made to feel very special. Our room was great and I loved the number of full length mirrors! Great coffee in the room, lovely little extras, I LOVE great customer service and the Westbury staff exceeded my expectations! Five Stars all the way!",5,2013,09,12
203,one of the best,"I have stayed at many top hotels around the world, Beijing, Hong Kong, Paris, London, but very few ive stayed at beats the westbury, the service, the quality, the room, everything, WOW! cant wait to go back, very very nice indeed, thank you for a wonderful stay",5,2013,09,11
203,"Wonderful stay at Westbury Hotel, Dublin","I was in Dublin on a business trip and stayes at Westbury Hotel from 8/5- 8/9.
What can I say, it is indeed a 5 star quality hotel with great rooms, great service and great location. would absolutely go back again.",5,2013,09,11
203,"Superb location, awesome staff, would stay again","We had a blast in Dublin and a big part was staying at the Westbury. The location was perfect, steps away from Grafton and the areas tourists can get started on. The staff were supremely friendly and efficient. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,09,10
203,"if ... you must visit Dublin, you must stay at the Westbury","Having returned to London after the summer break in France/Spain, it struck me how natural our stay at the Westbury in Dublin was. The staff are seamlessly excellent. The porter, whilst keeping a watchful eye on events, subtle yet helpful. The reception, checking in with ease... putting the welcome back into Ireland. The bed linen is beautiful, rooms spotless, breakfast fantastic (best latte we have enjoyed), even amongst a coterie of other 5*. The location tops it all, it is an amazingly central base, with flower sellers on your doorstep - and the sleep quality - wonderful. If you must visit Dublin, you'd be crazy not to give the Westbury a twist.",5,2013,09,10
203,Fabulous Hotel,"I stay at this wonderful hotel every time I'm in Dublin and quite simply ""its the best"".   The beautiful surroundings, the friendly and helpful staff, the fabulous location, its a very luxurious home from home.  Every Christmas myself and my sisters stay over for Christmas shopping and that wonderful festive atmosphere you only get in Grafton Street and the Westbury.   The hotel is decked out in all its festive glory and is even more magical than usual.   Recently myself and my husband celebrated our wedding anniversary in my favourite hotel.   We had a wonderful time from the minute we arrived with the girl on the front desk taking extra special interest in us because of the occasion.   After a look around the shops we returned to our room where we were greated with a lovely tray of little pastries with the words ""Happy Anniversary"", when we returned from dinner later that evening we found a bottle of champagne on ice, two glasses and a card from the front desk!   We felt like royalty!   The personal touch shown by the staff meant so much to us and made a special day even more special, I've kept the little card and have photos of all the lovely touches ..... I hope to celebrate every anniversary in the Westbury from now on!",5,2013,09,10
203,Afternoon tea,"Shared a lovely afternoon tea here with a friend. It was a real treat from start to finish. Luxurious, but not overly stuffy, surroundings and friendly staff add to the experience. The afternoon tea is ‚Ç¨30 per person without champagne but you get plenty for your money - choice of good quality teas, finger sandwiches, scones and a selection of desserts. Everthing was fresh and well made from good ingredients. Overall a lovely way to spend an afternoon.",5,2013,09,09
203,"Fantastic staff, great location and special hotel!","We stayed in the Westbury for one night on 30th August. I booked the hotel to propose to my girlfriend. Our experience in the hotel was absolutely wonderful from start to finish. The staff provided a very personal touch and went above and beyond to make the occasion memorable.  I would like to thank Joseph, Rachel and Alison in particular. It's a high end hotel with a friendly atmosphere and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking to treat themselves to a night in the heart of Dublin. The room was very comfortable and luxurious. The breakfast was delicious and once again the staff were friendly and set the place apart from other hotels. We would like to sincerely thank the staff and we love to return for special occasions!
P.S. Thankfully she said yes!",5,2013,09,08
203,Amazing hotel - great location!,"I was in Dublin with my mother to celebrate her 60th birthday a few weeks ago. It was her first time visiting Dublin, and the staff went out of the way to make this such a memorable stay for us ‚Äì from the warm welcome from the staff at reception, to personal greetings from the Guest Relations Managers Joseph & Rachel, to the lovely card & treats waiting for us in the room upon arrival. This was a trip we would not soon forget. The hotel itself is right in the heart of the city, a short walk from many notable attractions: Trinity College, St. Stephen‚Äôs Green, Dublin Castle and Temple Bar, were all within 5-15 mins walking distance. Several great pubs and restaurants were around to try as well ‚Äì we especially liked 37 Dawson & Taste of India. The daily turn-down service, and small added amenities (plush slippers, crystal glass, Nespresso coffee machine) all added to the experience being relaxing and memorable. I would highly recommend this hotel, and plan to stay here the next time I am back in Dublin.",5,2013,09,08
203,Dublin's Finest,"A stay at the Westbury is one of the great pleasures of a visit to Dublin. If you can, you should try it. Cheap it ain't but if you are minded to treat yourself then I assure you that you will not be disappointed. Right from the moment you walkin you know you are in a top class hotel.  The staff are all terrific, the service they provide is top class and the food and atmosphere is befitting that of one of Dublin's most established and best loved hotels. We have stayed here a few times now and the prospect of a return is always something that excites us. It's always a highlight of our visit. We will keep coming back as long as we possibly can. The facilities and the standards are as you would expect, I can't fault the place. Simply put, it's a treasure.",5,2013,09,08
203,Very well done:  Easy to recommend for central Dublin,"The Westbury is a very good choice for those with business in the nearby financial district or shopping and sightseeing plans in the city center.  I have stayed half a dozen times since 2009 ‚Äì it is very good and gets better every time I return.  Pricing is not cheap, but for what you get it is a good value.  Service is EXCELLENT and room size and quality are very good.  

Service.  The service is excellent and probably the best aspect of the Westbury.  I always find the bell, concierge and front desk staff to be extremely attentive, and this trip was no different.  The towel offered at check in is a nice touch you won‚Äôt find anywhere outside Asia‚Äîthe only possible improvement would be the steaming hot towel that is standard throughout top hotels and resorts there.  The front desk is always staffed with warm, polite people who are extremely helpful, e.g., faxes, mail, packages.  They will also happily take you down to the street level to ensure you start off in the right direction.  Multiple times while arriving or leaving from the lobby area, someone on staff would ask whether any assistance was required‚Äîsomething you won‚Äôt find in many hotels outside Asia these days.  Similarly, the housekeeping and laundry staff are also polite, welcoming, and seem genuinely to care.  Well done to the staff in these areas ‚Ä¶ and to the hotel's operator:  Management really knows what it is doing around the front desk staff, concierge, bell staff, housekeeping and in the lobby overall.  Every time I return, they have improved a little bit more.

Rooms.  Room d√©cor is of a high quality and standard room size is quite good for Europe (if you wind up in one of the larger rooms or a suite, which I have been put into twice, the size is excellent).  Views are nearly all of neighboring buildings and/or the street below‚Äînot bad, but nothing to write home about.  Some of elements of the finish in my room were beginning to show a bit of age, but overall the level is very nice.  Linens are clean and of excellent quality.  The flat screen TV and programming worked without trouble, and the variety of electronic connections and power options is excellent.  The room could do with a bit more lighting, but otherwise completely at a five star standard.  Furnishings are nice, bed was comfortable, and cleanliness is good.  The AC worked fine, though I didn‚Äôt use it much.  The bathrooms are on the small side but nicely appointed, and cleanliness is solid.  Amenities are what you would expect in a 5 star hotel, both in terms of quality and variety, including slippers, cotton swabs and pads and other grooming items, and a buff for shoes.

Food.  I‚Äôve eaten a few times at the hotel, usually breakfast in the Caf√© Novo on the ground floor, which I tried again on this visit.  The food is ok for the price, but the service can be very slow.  I was seated quickly, but it took 10 minutes to have my order taken and another 15 to have it delivered (it was a simple breakfast, which I could have prepared myself in 5 minutes).  The caf√© was not full by any means, so either the kitchen is disorganized or something isn‚Äôt working between the wait staff and the kitchen.  It‚Äôs happened a few times over the last year or two.  I must note, however, that even the food service staff are consistently friendly‚Äîit‚Äôs just that they‚Äôre also consistently slow‚Ä¶  Food presentation is ok, quality is good but not great.

Facilities.  The one thing this hotel lacks is a good swimming pool.  Hotel guests have access to a nearby fitness center with a pool for EUR 10 per day, which isn‚Äôt a bad option for enthusiasts but probably doesn't work for families that want to be poolside.  Not a complaint, but it would be more of a factor during longer stays or with family.

As above, pricing is not in the value range, but for the quality of room, the central location, and the service that is approaching world class, the rate is very reasonable.  The restaurant service and the lack of a pool are the only noticeable detractions, however even with these issues, the Westbury is the only hotel I use in Dublin and highly recommendable for business or a leisurely break in the city.

Hope this helps...!",4,2013,09,07
203,Would definately stay at the Westbury again,"We spent four nights at the Westbury Hotel. I would definitely stay again if in Dublin and would highly recommend it. The rooms are comfortable, clean, modern and spacious. The hotel is modern and the staff are accommodating. The location is the best. Leaving the hotel through the back exit took us into a lively area filled with traditional Irish pubs, excellent mixture of shopping options and restaurants everywhere. There are many streets to be explored and it is easy to walk around, enjoy street entertainment and discover central Dublin. The Westbury has to be one of the best hotels in Europe and is not to be missed if you are visiting Dublin.",5,2013,09,07
203,Number one,"We stayed here for five nights and were met by the most warm, friendly and helpful hotel staff. I have to make mention of the Guest Relations Manager, Joseph Downing, who was an absolue gentleman and his personal service was highly appreciated. Nothing was ever too much trouble. The hotel was amazingly comfortable with a modern decor, spacious lounge and dining areas. The informal and formal dining offered a wide variety matched with a high standard.The hotel is perfectly located, with amenities, shops, St. Stephens Green, pubs all close by. I would highly recommend this hotel, it was fantastic and I would not hesitate coming back again.",5,2013,09,07
203,First stay in Dublin good experience,"Our first time in Dublin to visit friends, the hotel has lovely large well decorated rooms with comfortable beds and the public lounge areas are very spacious and relaxing after the bustle of the city.

Location in the heart of a very lively area.

Only downside was we dined here one evening and is was just about average there was a lack of choice and the food was passable, my steak was very tough.

Would stay here again but would stick to dining out. (Though not a Gordon Ramseys which was terrible!)",4,2013,09,05
203,Four weeks in Ireland,"A quality hotel in an excellent central location. Room was not large but clean, reasonably modern and acceptable. Room amenities were of a good standard including a comfortable bed. The breakfast presentation was of a very high standard and service in the breakfast area friendly and attentive. We had evening meals away from the hotel because it was only a short walk to various restaurants etc. This was our first destination in Ireland and provided a great start to our holiday.",4,2013,09,05
203,"WESTBURY HOTEL, DUBLIN","Recently I stayed at The Westbury Hotel  with my family.   In my opinion, this is a first class Hotel with a very helpful and friendly staff.

203,"Very nice, very expensive","Lovely hotel in excellent location. Rates a little bit too high to be considered value for money though.

+Nice room
+Comfy bed
+Clean
+Very quiet (especially considering you're smack in the middle of town)
+Nespresso machine in-room for nice coffee
+Free wifi throughout hotel

-Tiny bathroom (really, smallest I've ever seen in a business hotel)",4,2013,09,05
203,The Westbury Hotel,"The service was amazing from the time we drove up to the hotel.  We arrived straight from the airport (and an overnight flight).  All the staff were super helpful in getting us registered, checking of luggage and breakfast.  After that we conferred with the concierge as to what we should see and do for our time in Dublin.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and go back again.",5,2013,09,04
203,Outstanding Hotel,"Great property in an outstanding location in Dublin.  Easy access to all the sights, close to Trinity, Temple Bar and Grafton Street.  Large beautifully appointed room and friendly accommodating staff.

Highly recommended!",5,2013,09,04
203,Excellent,"We had a brief, two night, stay here in early September and found the hotel was excellent in every regard.  The location is ideal for exploring the city with most attractions within a few minutes walk.  The staff were particularly helpful and friendly.  My wife was feeling a little unwell when we arrived and we were cared for superbly.  The room was well decorated, well maintained, peaceful and comfortable. We had a small issue with the iron supplied, and once they were informed, it was replaced within minutes. An excellent hotel and it would be our first choice on returning to Dublin.",5,2013,09,04
203,Made to Feel Special at The Westbury Hotel,"I was treated to a night at The Westbury by my son.  From the moment I arrived, I felt like a VIP.  The welcome at Reception was wonderful and all the staff that I met were friendly and genuinely helpful.  The room was very well equipped and I very much appreciated the extra touches from the hotel manager.

I look forward to another opportunity to stay at The Westbury in the future.",5,2013,09,04
203,Elegance both stated and understated,"The warm and welcoming staff barely lets you catch your own breath when you enter, they're so eager to please and to make your stay wonderful -- which they do!  The property is beautiful and immaculate.  The location couldn't be better.  The concierges picked A++ restaurants for us and suggested terrific day trips that were fun, fascinating and educational (but not schooling!).  Our room was spacious and beautifully appointed, roomsevice breakfast plentiful, and the bar downstairs, bright convivial and charming.  I can't imagine a better place to stay in the warm warm heart of Dublin.",5,2013,09,04
203,Could hotel service get any better?,"Well, not that we know of.  We have been many places and have never been treated so nicely.  Everyone on the staff was most helpful and very friendly.
Great location... except if you are I light sleeper... the late nights on the weekends can get loud from the pubs.  We had no problem.",5,2013,09,04
203,A fantastic hotel,I've stayed at this hotel several times while visiting Dublin.  The location is great and easy to get around the rest of the city.  The staff is amazing and willing to help at any time day or night.  The rooms are spacious and very comfortable.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again.,5,2013,09,03
203,"Westbury Hotel, Dublin, Ireland","Service was spectacular.  Greeted immediately by doorman in top hat and tails who grabbed your luggage and assisted you inside.  At sign in, offered water to drink and cool cloth for hands.  Luggage to room where slippers, robe, toiletries available.  Excellent advice and assistance with sightseeing.  Loved it!",4,2013,09,03
203,Wouldn't change a thing,"Very nice hotel. Room was a great size and staff was very friendly. Superb location as it's right off Grafton Street so lots of great shops, restaurants, pubs and cafes. For 5 star hotel it met all of my expectations and I would stay there again.",5,2013,09,03
203,Helpful Eddie,"We enjoyed a brief stay in The Westbury. Our room was very pleasant and the quality of fitments and toiletries in the bathroom were pleasing.
We found all the staff - at the door, the reception & the bar were helpful, smart & efficient. We were especially impressed by how cheerfully helpful Eddie (concierge) was - he was great.",4,2013,09,03
203,Great place.,"I'm not used to stay in fancy places, but at Westbury, even being a backpackers who needed to rest, I felt very welcomed. From the moment I arrive with all my stuff hanging around me, to the check out, it met my expectations very well.",5,2013,09,03
203,Best hotel location in Dublin,"With the regeneration around Drury Street and St Georges St, the new bars and cool eateries are all over this side of town.  The back entrance of the Westbury allows a sneaky way in and out of this area.  You never stray too far away from your luxury pad.

Room service was good and provided late (very late) night snacks.  Room was clean.  Location PERFECT.",5,2013,09,02
203,Very nice,"You know it's good when you have valet parking and golfballs in the fridge. 
Very clean and nice hotel. Excellent location pretty much on Grafton street. Great food too.........................................",5,2013,09,02
203,"Nice hotel, very centrally located on Grafton Street","This hotel is perfect if you wish to visit the heart of Dublin. It is smack on Grafton Street and next to St Stephens Green. Pubs and restaurants around it everywhere and the theatre featuring ‚ÄòRiverdance‚Äô around the corner. A must see if you have not seen this show before !
It is quite luxurious (5 star ish), but quite buzzy with tourists these days. I remember it quieter from before, but no issue. Wifi Internet is free. I hate mini bars with pressure plates that charge you immediately even when you only ‚Äòtouch‚Äô something in it. They stacked things in the back which I could not see (I was looking for a tomato juice) but I didn‚Äôt want to search too much for fear of triggering the pressure plate of something I did not want‚Ä¶.
It‚Äôs a pity that the breakfast buffet does not propose any eggs etc. Only  ‚Äòcontinental‚Äô. You then have to go a la carte for eggs etc. Often full Irish (available) is a bit too much for me‚Ä¶. (and more expensive).
They have no gym or pool but you are allowed to use the one from the fitness club across the street, which is fine.
We also used the conference rooms which were fine.
Overall a great stay downtown Dublin !",4,2013,09,01
203,"Waste of money, certainly not 5* treatment","I was really looking forward to stopping at this hotel but from the start it was a bitter disappointment. Hotel check in is 15.00, I arrived at about 13.00 paid upfront for my two night stay and left my bags with reception. When I returned at 15.00 to check in they advised me my room wasn't ready, at this point I had to ask if there was anywhere I could sit and wait as nobody had offered and I was taken to the bar. After another 40 minutes and me enquiring again I was shown to my room. My luggage arrived 10 minutes of me getting to my room. I then went to unpack  and the wardrobe door fell on me with part of the door splintering. I immediately called down to reception, at this point I discover the bedside clock doesn't work and the phone had a terrible line. The receptionist said they would send someone to fix it.  After waiting 20 minutes and not hearing anything I went to reception to complain, it was the same lady who was aware I was checked in late, she did swap my room but just said that a wardrobe door hadn't done that before, this just felt like I was being blamed. 
I appreciate that accidents happen but this was meant to be 5* luxury and with the cheap/poorly maintained furniture and serious lack of any real customer service I would have been no worse stopping in a travel lodge! This hotel really did the minimum regarding customer service from check in to check out.  Im not sure if where I went wrong, was it paying upfront, maybe a case of got your money don't care anymore, certainly felt like that.",3,2013,08,31
203,First time stay,"We just stayed 3 nights at The Westbury Hotel.  I picked this hotel from the reviews on tripadvisor.
We had a lovely stay.  The hotel is very nice and the staff was very helpful.  It was our first time to Dublin and the location of this hotel can not be beat.  We could walk anywhere without trouble locating all the sites around.  It was also our anniversary and the hotel made reservations for a fantastic restaurant, ""Chapter One"", and they had champagne and treats in our room with a lovely card.   I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,08,31
203,Excellent stay yet again,"Just back from a 3 night break in The Westbury, 5th time staying here this year, yet again, flawless! The ease and comfort from check in to departure is unbeatable, I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, bar-restaurant-valet parking, everything was perfect. Looking forward to my next visit.",5,2013,08,30
203,Watch out for unauthorized large credit card charges weeks after you leave!,"We stayed in the Westbury hotel for a month following a fixed quote for the duration. The staff tried to dishonor the quote when we left. Several times they tried to make us pay more. When my husband was leaving a week before me he paid the whole bill and they acknowledged we owed nothing. When my daughter and I were leaving they tried again to make us pay more. After a lot of aggressive and intimidating behavior towards us which left me quite shaken, they finally accepted it and gave me a receipt stating we owed them nothing. A month later we find that they have put an unauthorized and large amount on the credit card. I would be very wary if I were you, especially if you are a woman.",1,2013,08,30
203,A hotel that deserves all its accolades,"After a few visits to Dublin I was booked into the Westbury on a business trip. The first positive experience was on checking in - the staff member was very personable and took time to describe the hotel and the area. The room itself was delightful - plenty of space, very well appointed and clearly well maintained. I have another visit scheduled  in a couple of months and am really looking forward to me next stay at the Westbury! Added to all the positive comments above it s worth saying hat the central location of the hotel is just one more added bonus.",5,2013,08,29
203,A good choice for a break in Dublin,"Overall, we enjoyed our stay here. Location is perfectly central, willing and friendly staff, good food and drinks. We have two niggles:

1 - getting to the place. The central Dublin one-way system is the stuff of nightmares where you endlessly circle your destination as it remains tantalizingly in view but out of reach...Seriously, without satnav, you won't find the hotel and they should perhaps offer a service where they meet guests at say St Stephen's Gardens and guide you in. We paid a resting cabbie to lead us there after an hour's frustration.
2 - Room 345. Was very warm in room. The disabled access bathroom is not good. The lavatory/shower are too close together so the ramp for the shower blocks wheelchair access to the lavatory. Changing rooms was kindly offered but declined as to move again on a very short trip not worth it. Complimentary drink assuaged most of the frustration.",4,2013,08,29
203,Great City Hotel,"Loved every minute of my first stay at the Westbury. Will consider this as a future first choice for Dublin.

Slight mix up on check in was handled well alongside a genuine welcome by the excellent reception staff. Grand decor, impressive scale and a cracking location.

Rooms clean, comfortable and a decent size or the city. We stayed on 4th Floor to the rear of the hotel. Dublin is a lively place so don't expect to sleep with the windows open. Dublin is also not the cheapest place to visit (be prepared to spend plenty).

Free Wifi is a bit patchy but it did the job.

Only ate breakfast here which was full Irish on all 4 days. All cooked to perfection and served by friendly staff who went to any length to make sure we were happy. They were amazing  and very patient with some of the more demanding, less polite guests. You do not see this at larger hotels in the UK.

Concierge and doorman were top notch and could be relied upon for advice. Could not recommend this place highly enough.

For me the staff make the place and are a credit to themselves and the management team.

Look forward to a return visit.",5,2013,08,28
203,"Excellent location, staff and room","We arrived at 6:00am exhausted. We were greeted and told they would work hard to get our room ready for an early check-in, they also offered us complimentary breakfast.  My children slept on the lovely couches for an hour and then we enjoyed a lovely breakfast of bread, fruit and coffee.  We were able to check in around 11:00am.  The staff was so accommodating and helpful. The turn down service was an unexpected treat.  Our room was very large and accommodated two adults and teenage children perfectly.  The location can't be beat, Grafton Street is about 20 steps outside the front door and St.Stephen's Green is a three minute walk.",5,2013,08,28
203,City Centre Excellence,"Stayed here on a bed & breakfast basis, arrived late in the evening but staff couldn't have been more welcoming. Bed very comfortable.  Breakfast next morning set me up for the rest of the day. Hotel's location was close to Grafton Street and other attractions",5,2013,08,27
203,Amazing Hotel with Amazing Staff,"We have just returned from a two night stay at The Westbury which I booked for my partners birthday.
When we arrived we were greeted by the door man who took our bags and was so friendly and happy it was a lovely welcome into the hotel. We were then quickly checked in by a lovely receptionist who asked us how our journey had been and told us our room was ready despite it only being 9am!! Our bags were bought up stairs by Eddie who showed us how our room worked and was extremely friendly and accomodating as well. 
Our room was lovely, very comfy bed, slippers, dressing gown, TV on the wall with a really good selection of channels, coffee maker, complimentary biscuits and chocolates, they really do think of every last detail!
That afternoon a lovely guy bought up cakes and a happy birthday card for my other half which he was thrilled with and it really made the stay special!
As we loved our room so much we ordered room service that evening and although there wasnt a massive selection of meals (they do have two restaurants you can eat in,we were just being lazy!)  ... the food was gorgeous, it was bought up to us on time and hot and we could pay cash which some hotels do not accomodate. We also opted for breakfast in our room which we just paid a 5 euro tray charge as Bfast was included for us. And you have never seen such a feast!! Cereals, yoghurts, toasts, pastries, cooked breakfast.. it was amazing and tasted lovely!!
Although we spent time exploring the area in the day we loved our hotel so much we had food in our room both nights and both meals were really tasty and well presented and good value.
When we checked out we were given a bottle of water each and they were really very friendly once again.
Apart from the gorgeous interior of the hotel what truly makes this hotle 5* are the staff, they could not do enough for us, were friendly and genuinely happy to help. Thanks for a lovely stay!!!",5,2013,08,27
203,Simply outstanding - again.,"This was my 5th time at the Westbury, and it's quite simply the best hotel in Dublin, and probably one of the best hotels worldwide.  We were upgraded on arrival and Rachael, the receptionist, could not have been nicer; she is an absolute asset to the hotel.  Concierge was delightful, and all reception staff were so professional without being pretentious or snooty.  It's evident staff take pride in providing such excellent customer service.  The rooms are stunning and the bathroom was spotless.  At the restaurant, our needs were anticipated and the staff were excellent at suggesting off menu alternatives for specific dietary needs. The location is great and we, (4 women), feel the area is very safe, especially at night.  The only fault I have with the hotel is that it has set the bar so high, I am disappointed when staying in other cities that have no Doyle Collection hotels!",5,2013,08,26
203,Great Stay!!!,"Fab stay! Standard room was nice. Service was excellent, we were treated like royalty! Breakfast was one of the best I have had ever. Staff were friendly and efficient.  Location couldn't be better for shopping eating and socialising! Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,08,25
203,Excellent bar!,"Called in to the bar for a well earned glass of fizz after a hard days shopping. Staff were very attentive, especially John who made us the nicest ""old fashioned"" i have ever tasted! Lovely atmosphere, could have easily stayed all evening! Booked for afternoon tea later in the year as it looked great too!",5,2013,08,25
203,Beautiful rooms in a fantastic location,"I've stayed three times on business now and have had one (very lovely) suite as well as standard rooms. The decor in all of them is very nice and even in the smaller rooms, there's a real ""luxury"" feel. The suite was very spacious, tv on the wall above the bath, large writing desk, super king bed (great linens and coverings). The views have never been great, but with the convenience of the location, it does mean it's right in the middle of a narrow street.
Hotel bar is good, knowledgeable bar staff, great decor. The flowers around the place are always very stylish. Good room service menu.
Staff very friendly - must commend the head housekeeper - there was an ""incident"" outside my room early one morning involving a guest very unfairly laying into one of the staff at high volume. The head housekeeper dealt with the whole thing with great calm, grace and self control (I'd have lamped the guest...).
If I'm not put in The Westbury now, I'll just hop back to Heathrow instead. Used to stay at the Merrion - will always stick with the Westbury instead.",4,2013,08,24
203,In the middle of everything,"This hotel could not be in a better position. Right in the centre of Dublin almost on Grafton street, everything is within walking distance. Great,shops, pubs and restaurants on your doorstep. A really classy hotel. ",5,2013,08,22
203,Perfect hotel,"The hotel was excellent, the staff friendly and the location perfect.  We were easy walking distance to everything we wanted to see.   The staff was always willing to provide an extra bottle of water or give advice on a restaurant.  Highly recommend this one.",5,2013,08,21
203,Everything It Should Be,"We arrived after a week-long road trip for our last night's stay before the long flight home and this hotel was just the reprieve we needed. The service was impeccable,  as they seemed to be over-staffed (which meant we didn't wait for service), the room was clean (I had no qualms about letting my baby crawl around) and the bed was large and comfortable.  They even had a US outlet behind the desk!! The wifi was free and they provided turn-down service with bottled water and chocolate. The location was close too many shops, restaurants and pubs which was perfect for our last night's stay as we wanted a last ha-rah and were sick of being in a car.",5,2013,08,21
203,Exceptional service,I would like to thank the hotel for there brilliant service and help. Once they heard we had good news that day they pulled out all the stops for us and gave us a stay we will never forget. Staff and service was top notch. Couldn't thank them enough!!!,5,2013,08,21
203,Just OK,"My wife and I stayed just  1 night  on Tuesday 14th August. It difficult to find  as grafton Street is now pedestrian only.Waited 15 minutes for the barman to serve a drink and we were the only patrons in the lounge  .  Ate in the restaurant. Food was  good , but as there was only 3 other diners ,  seemed  lacking in atmosphere and .at E38 for a plain steak . ¬£28 for breakfast.  We had a  nice enough double room , but for a 5* star  lacked the whow factor! Public convenience had not had the paper towel bin emptied and  had overflowed onto the floor . Floor was wet and slippy. Its central and on the whole OK but whether you can  call it 5* and  one of the top hotels of the world category , the jury is out. Sight seeing the next day , we stopped for coffee in another 5* close by , and it is 5* ++. I dont think we would stay here again , overpriced for what you get . I accept its the height of the tourist season , but when you pay top dollar you expect top service and facilities",3,2013,08,21
203,amazing hotel in prime position to take advantage of Dublin,"I treated my partner to a two night stay at the Westbury at the beginning of may, and from the second we arrived I was thoroughly impressed. The concierge could not have been more helpful and friendly greeting us with a huge smile and immediately taking our luggage and showing us to reception, we were greeted at reception with hot hand towels and shown straight to out room even though we arrived five hours before check in, all without any bother and as though it was no trouble at all. Staff were professional throughout but always offering polite and friendly conversation.

Although the dining room was lovely to enjoy breakfast, we had breakfast brought upto our room on our final day and I would highly recommend you do this for a lazy morning, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of food available. We had pastries and croissants, a full Irish breakfast, fruit, coffee and fresh juice all brought up at ten o clock.  

Location is key when visiting a city which is new to you and the Westbury is in prime position to explore local attractions, aswell as being on the main shopping street, it is close by some beautiful restaurants and bars all within walking distance. 

I would not hesitate to stay here when visiting Dublin again, worth every penny and cannot fault it in anyway. Friendly staff, beautiful d√©cor, and in a prime position to explore and make the most of your stay in Dublin.",5,2013,08,21
203,Great Hotel...Great Service !!,"This hotel is in a great location, close to Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Trinity College. We were able to walk everywhere. The service was suberb from check-in to check-out. From getting a bottle of water at check-in on a warm day, to getting excellent assistance on picking a restaurant, the service was outstanding. The service extended even past our check-out time..we left some documents tucked inside a magazine on the coffee table in our room. The day after we left, the hotel retrieved our letters, and sent them on to the states for us. (Thanks, Joanna!)",5,2013,08,20
203,Perfect location,"The hotel is excellent and in the perfect location - very comfortable rooms, superb lounge area with attentive staff and a well stocked bar for a late night drink after dinner. The reception and concierge staff were also engaged and took the time to help with information about Dublin. Plenty of nice touches like the wet flannel to mop the brow on check in! Look forward to booking again when I return in September.",5,2013,08,20
203,Fabulous,The Westbury mixes contemporary with classical and is thoroughly enjoyable. It is in the pricey side but if you find good online deals it's totally worth it. The staff were every accommodating ensuring we had everything at our disposal. We had a one night layover in Dublin after coming home from Venice before flying onto NY. The concierge also helped me getting the room covered in rose petals. It was a wonderful experience.,5,2013,08,20
203,Great Hotel,"We stayed 2 nights upon arrival from Australia and had a great experience. The room was a great size as was the bathroom. Lots of big, fluffy towels. My husband enjoyed the nespresso machine and I enjoyed the oat biscuits. The staff were very helpful. The only complaint I have is the weak water pressure in the shower.",5,2013,08,20
203,Great place to stay,"Although the rooms were expensive, it's was worth it.  The staff has been very pleasant and very helpful. I love a place that hands me a bottle of water when I come back from a run.  Room sizes perfect, bathrooms well appointed, nespresso in the rooms.  No real view to speak of but it's Dublin and you're out most of the day and night anyway.  The location was very convenient.  We walked to Trinity, Dublin Castle,Temple Bar and the Croke stadium for a hurling game, what a blast!!",5,2013,08,18
203,Perfect Location for Shopping,"This hotel was lovely and larger than other hotels I have stayed in Dublin.  Location to Grafton street can not be beat, and loved the extra noise barrier windows so I slept like a baby even during the rowdy pubs near by, didn't hear a peep.  Free-wifi was perfect!  Not sure if it was the shampoo or Dublin water but my hair was so soft.  Loved the Nespresso machine, short bread cookies and chocolates at turn down, yummy! The maid service was outstanding!!!!  The heated towel rack was much appreciated along with the XL bath towels and robes.

Advice for check-in.  It was great that they asked us to sign up for the D&C card so we could get free wi-fi, newspaper and water, but I wished they asked us which paper we wanted instead of expecting us to tell them which paper we wanted, in America there is only the USA Today paper so we expected a paper each day and they never came. We also should also have been informed that our room rate included a free light breakfast at Cafe Nova.

It was lovely the luggage was brought to the room since our room was not ready when we checked in, but I am used to the luggage being placed on a luggage rack when it is brought to room instead of left on the floor.",4,2013,08,17
203,terrible security staff...5 star joke,"I recently stayed at the westbury and had a TERRIBLE business experience.

I was working late with some colleagues and after a few late hours we went for a bite to eat and returned a little after midnight to finish out on a business project.

But when we returned to the hotel the security guard (named atilla) informed me that only guests may enter the hotel. When I told him the collegues with me were guests of mine he informed me that guests were guests of the hotel...AND THE HOTEL GUESTS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BRING FRIENDS OR COLLEAGUES BACK TO THE HOTEL AFTER MIDNIGHT.

When I asked if there was a manager available to discuss he said no. And so I now need to work Saturday.

Thank you westbury for a terrible experience of your 5 star hotel. I think the shelbourne or four seasons may be more accommodating next time.

Business and westbury don't mix unless your colleagues all live in the hotel.",1,2013,08,16
203,Well done; 5 star but for lack of pool,"This was our last stop after driving round Ireland countryside.  What a wonderful oasis of comfort to land in at the end of our journey.  The room we stayed in (2 doubles) was large.  The furnishings high quality and beautiful decorated throughout the hotel and rooms.  Upon arrival we were a little confused as we entered on Clarendon and found no doorman to help us in or valet.  This was quickly sorted out and the service from that point on was excellent.  The hotel is located proximate to Grafton Street and is within walking distance of just about everything in city centre a tourist would want to see.  It is next to Saba, an award winning Thai/Vietnamese restaurant and Bewley's, the historical cafe.  The toiletries very nice and they are quite free with the waters and anything you need.  The room service prices were exorbitant and the quality was OK but frankly why do room service when you are steps away from everything?  Only if you have small children that refuse to leave the room....Wifi is free.  The only complaint is there is no pool.  For a pool they have an agreement with the health club across Clarendon which is inconvenient as you have to tromp across the street in your suit.  But that isn't so bad even in the pooring Irish rain, but rather the 10 euros per person they wish to charge for that.  For shame, no 5 star should charge extra for a pool.  NB parking is 20 euros a day.  Really, a lovely hotel and if you don't care about a pool it is 5 star.  PS a huge tour group came in one of the days of our stay and  many of them occupied our floor.  The team got them in and their luggage organized and whisked into the rooms so quickly it was amazing.",4,2013,08,16
203,"Just superb, every time","Returning for a second time in 3 months, this time for a wedding in town. We arrived on a very wet day. The door man came rushing to the taxi with an umbrella and offered help with our luggage. He seemed to genuinely want to do his best to help.

Check in was warm and welcoming. Room was quiet and lovely again. You get what you pay for and to me, this is the best hotel in Dublin. Over 1200 excellent reviews cannot be wrong.

I will definitely recommend The Westbury to anyone and look forward to returning in the future.",5,2013,08,16
203,Simply the Best!,"I have now had the pleasure to return and stay at the Westbury for one night on business.   It is one of my favourite places.   The staff are really friendly and helpful, the rooms are fab and the food great.   It is in a superb location and when you step outside the hotel you are immediately in the centre of the hustle and bustle of the city centre.",5,2013,08,16
203,David Moore,"Choose the Westbury Hotel to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. We were not disappointed. They parked my car, collected our luggage and took it to our room, while we enjoyed a cocktail each in the Marble Bar.John the barman was superb company. He is Swedish with an unsurpassed knowledge of every alcoholic beverage imaginable . For our dinner we dined in the Wilde Restaurant. The food and wine were superb. The staff were very helpful without being overbearing. They also have a great sense of humour.. We ordered breakfast in bed today and a feast duly arrived upon the anointed hour along with complimentary morning paper. Have to say cant wait to return. We shall definitely stay here again. 5* in every way..",5,2013,08,14
203,Pure Luxury in Fantastic Location!!!,"Gorgeous hotel. My friend and I stayed there for one night during a wee break in Dublin.  The best thing about the hotel is probably the location. You are right in the middle of the shops, bars, restaurants etc. The rooms are lovely. Staff make you feel really special. I suppose most people expect that little bit more from a 5 star hotel, and they definitely rose to the mark. Breakfast was probably one of the best I have had. Yummmm!  I will be back!",5,2013,08,13
203,This hotel is a must!,"We were there for three nights recently.  All I can say is what a fantastic experience my husband and I had staying in this location. When we checked in we were assisted by Adrienne, who was very knowledgeable about the about the area and took the time to answer ALL my questions this being my first time to Dublin (there were many). Working with her started this experience off on the right foot, thank you Adrienne! Our room was near the elevators and I was nervous about the possibility of noise because I am a light sleeper. However, I can honestly say that I was not disturbed on any of the nights by the proximity at all. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and the hotel was spotless. Also, we didn't have a car and the location of the hotel was perfect. It was near everything! I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be staying here the next time I get to Dublin.",5,2013,08,12
203,Amazing!,"Had a lovely couple of days in a well appointed room. Our bed was very comfortable and the facilities in the room..nespresso ,towelling gowns, huge bath sheets and lovely biscuits and chocolates were wonderful. Helpful concierge and room staff. Really enjoyed our stay.",5,2013,08,12
203,Terrible beds.,"The hotel is beautifuly appointed but my god the beds are HORRIBLE!!!! 3 nights of torture. Very soft and if the person nexts to you moves, you know it! Reported it the first night was told  they would chnage my room. Packed up all our stuff. Came back from the day. Told we would not be moved as all the beds are of the same quality. Awesome! Love packing and unpacking.  I cried the 2nd night...Other complaint is my daughters non alcohoilic drink 9 euros. My alcohoilic drink 8 euros ??? Huh ?? On the 4th night switched to the Merrion. THAT place has it going on!!! A perfect experiance!!",2,2013,08,11
203,Location location,"The location of this hotel is fantastic. Ideal for a night out or shopping trip. My husband and I got a really good offer for a Sunday night stay. It included parking, breakfast a late checkout and a shopping experience in Brown Thomas. Not sure what shopping experience entailed of, it wasn't  explained and I didn't ask. Very good concierge service. We ate lunch in the lobby, food was a little over priced and it was a little pretentious but ambience is so relaxing. Room was standard, but did have little extras and turn down service. The breakfast was amazing and choice was excellent. ",4,2013,08,10
203,great hotel but needs more handicapped accessible bathrooms,"Stayed two nights at this hotel. Location is great for seeing Dublin and accessing transportation. The other person sharing our room was unable to get in and out of the tub to take a shower. When we asked for a room with a walk in shower we were told they only had two and they had already given them to two other people in our tour group.  They then told us that we could put on our robe furnished by the hotel, walk through and go to the gym where there was a shower. We found this to be quite unreasonable considering this is a highly rated hotel and we certainly would not want to parade through the hotel to shower.",4,2013,08,09
203,"Great location, service, breakfast and rooms","This hotel is great from the Nespresso and kettle facilities in the rooms to the excellent breakfasts. The bedrooms also have air conditioning which we found beneficial. The open spacios lounge is good to take tea and relax in.  Free WI-fi also works throughout the hotel. Everything is on offer at breakfast with fresh well prepared ingredients. The staff were very accommodating, a hero being a concierge who managed to find me a hire car from Herz, when Avis had told me they had no cars available. . The location being close to Grafton Street, Trinity College, St Stephen's Green and the Castle is very handy. You can walk to Temple Bar for nightlife but also escape to be more relaxed. We didn't eat in the hotel, since there are so many restaurants and bars nearby to explore.",5,2013,08,09
203,Feel treated like a guest at this hotel,"First time I'm staying at this hotel and I'm very pleasantly surprised. I had to run for dinner and just left my bag at the concierge in order to check in later. No questions about room number, just very friendly concierge helping me to leave bag. At my very late check-in, I was treated to an upgrade and the room was absolutely stunning. Very nice combination of modern technology to operate curtains, lights etc., but still a classy stylish and warm touch to the room. I had to pass on breakfast, but check-out went very smoothly and because of the warm weather, I was treated to a nice bottle of cooled water. Such a nice treat! Have stayed at many hotels, but this one clearly comes high on my list.",5,2013,08,08
203,Fantastic Hotel in the best area of the city!,Stayed here for one night while on a short business trip to Dublin. Could not be happier with the hotel and it was such a pleasant experience. The hotel is perfectly decorated with a nice mix of old and new.,4,2013,08,08
203,quality experience for the special occasion,"I have never review a hotel before.  On this occasion I felt I had to make it known the wonderful experience of staying at the Westbury.  The genuine welcome at reception from the wonderful Eden, who has  a natural gift to immediately make you feel welcome and at home.  A true gem.  Thanks Eden.  Top  class hotel in the best location in town.  Management, whatever your doing, keep doing it. It works.",5,2013,08,08
203,Excellent service and lovely room,"I stayed at the Westbury for weekend in July and the service from the staff was excellent. Food was lovely, room was great and the general ambiance of the hotel was very relaxing. The staff in particular do this hotel proud. Everyone is friendly and will stop and have a chat. Rachel on reception and Thomas on Concierge couldn't do enough for us. It was the first time I had been to Dublin and I am looking forward to going back and will most definitely stay at The Westbury again.",5,2013,08,08
203,10 year anniversary surprise!,"Went to this beautiful hotel for our 10 year wedding anniversary as a total treat. Told the lady I booked with it was our 10 year anniversary so could we have a nice room. When we arrived to our delight they informed us we were getting a complimentary upgrade to the Presidential Suite!  It was such a lovely surprise. We had an amazing time. Went out for dinner & came straight back to the suite. Didn't want to waste the experience!!

From our arrival to depature the staff were amazing, very chatty without being invasive. 

To all the staff & management, thank you so much for making our anniversary so special.",5,2013,08,07
203,"Excellent service, well worth the price","Stayed at the Westbury for 4 nights in mid-July and I was very pleased with the service provided.  The staff was friendly, responsive, and helpful.  Location was central and all attractions were within easy walking distance. The rooms were big by European standard, and bedding was comfortable.  Nicely appointed bathroom as well.  Its price seemed a bit high when I first booked but I paid more for a hotel in Galway for the night before my Westbury stay and the service there was bad and the room was smaller and with much less amenitites in Galway.  Will definitely stay at Westbury again when in Dublin next time.",5,2013,08,07
203,Well situated and wonderful staff,We stayed two nights at the Westbury prior to boarding a ship for a week long cruise. The location is superb for getting transportation in and around Dublin and for walking tours to see many of the main sights.  The staff was wonderful and so helpful.  We ate at the buffet each morning and the food was great.  Bathroom small but that is to be expected in many European hotels. It was very comfortable.,4,2013,08,07
203,Afternoon Tea,"I went to the Westbury today for afternoon tea, I go occasionally and today was a bank holiday so I decided to head into the city. They have made some changes, the super staff are now superb. I always enjoy the Westbury but today they made me feel special.
Congratulations to the Westbury and their superb staff, I look forward to going back again. And by the way if you want to have a afternoon treat that is unbeatable try their afternoon tea.",5,2013,08,05
203,Deserves it's 5 Star status,"We traveled as a family and this hotel is one of the best we have ever visited. Location is perfect for touring Dublin by foot. 1/2 block from Grafton Street, walking distance to Trinity College, Temple Bar and St. Steven's Green. Loads of shopping and dining close by.
The hotel itself is gorgeous - beautiful flower arrangements in the lobby. Take time to have a drink in The Marble Bar. I highly recommend a ""French 75""! Martin made an amazing version of that and I can't wait to return for this reason alone.
Rooms are beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, and very comfortable beds/pillows. Staff was fabulous. Very accommodating but unobtrusive. Love the little linen towel they set out at turn-down service for your feet before you don the slippers they provide. Nice touch!
Our group unanimously agreed that our meal in their upscale restaurant was the best we had during our 10-day stay in Ireland - and we had a lot of GREAT meals - so this was high praise. Thanks, Westbury, for a perfect visit.",5,2013,08,03
203,"perfect, couldn't do enough for you","just back from a two night stay at The Westbury, from the location to the service, everything was fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble, what a change to be actually treated like you should be, from check in hot towels, bags delivered to your room, gorgeous bathroom products, turn down service, to umbrella loan. Refreshingly perfect. Definitely go back.",5,2013,08,03
203,Perfect!,"We just got home after spending the night here. From the moment we arrived the service was exemplary! From valet, to check in to all the staff wishing by husband happy birthday, there was even a birthday card signed by management waiting for him in our room! They also sent up divine chocolates with ""happy birthday"" written on the plate...nice touch.

You get the feeling that regardless of who you are, you are made to feel like a guest who has been staying there for years, every single member of staff, without exception, were so friendly and professional, but not stuffy in any way.

I would definitely stay here again. It is slightly more expensive than we are used to spending, but I would happily pay it again...and again. It is even worth popping in for a drink and checking out the stunning art work, we must of spent an hour admiring it last night!

Thank you to all for making this trip to Dublin one of the best, you even made the sun shine for us...impressive!

Rachel ",5,2013,08,02
203,delightful and charming!among my top picks for Dublin city!,"I stayed 3 nights at The Westbury Hotel in Dublin on business. The hotel is located in the heart of the city with many of the sights not too far away; including shopping district Grafton street, the temple bar, the much in demand 'bang' restaurant and the gaiety theatres. (watch the 'Riverdance' show if you can). The hotel has good  breakfast so book a room with breakfast, the staff whether at the front desk,the concierge, the restaurants or the room service all are amazingly efficient, polite and gracious.
The rooms are comfortable and well sized by European standards, with all the amenities one expects in a hotel like a good sized TV. lots of  channels, ...the bathrooms are not large but well planned..equipped with both tub and shower, with heated towel racks and toiletries by Aromatherapy Associates, which are nice...and chocolates every night are part of the little things.
I stayed 3 nights, and left very early one of the morning, and they even packed a 'breakfast to go'...
among my top picks for Dublin city!!",4,2013,08,01
203,My favorite Dublin hotel,"I've been coming to Dublin for 15 years for work and the one thing I know will not change (for the worse!) is the Westbury.  I've stayed in all the usual suspects - The Shelbourne, The Four Seasons, the St Helens, the Conrad but it is the Westbury to which I consistently return.  The reviews have it pretty much covered but to reiterate: it is an exceptional hotel with authentic, superb service in a location that can't be beat.  Little things make such a difference: the place is spotless and beautifully maintained, the coffee in the room is a Nespresso maker, the rooms are modern without being stark, the daily Irish Shortbread (why can't we make cookies this good in America?), free WiFi, beautiful bathroom supplies - there really isn't a misfire in the place.  Whenever I come back to the hotel my stress level drops several points - a combination of the place feeling very homey and the truly lovely Irish hospitality is so appreciated.  The service is attentive without being overbearing and little things just happen without you having to ask (a car was magically called for me because I had happened to mention the previous night I was heading to the airport in the morning).  There was no drama, it just happened.

By comparison: If you are expecting a grand dame hotel, the Shelbourne is more that speed in the scale of the exterior and traditional interior spaces.  The Westbury isn't a looker from the outside - but don't let that deter you.  Ever since Marriott took over the Shelbourne, they have applied their special blend of average to the property.  The Conrad is just a Hilton - bleh.  The Four Seasons is outside the city but is nice - it's a Four Seasons.  The St Helens is really quite beautiful and worth a stay if you want to get outside the city a little.  Spectacular grounds, bars, and facilities make this a treat.  But it's an 8 euro cab ride to the city so not super convenient.  

All in all this place is one of my favorite places to stay in the world.  It doesn't have the opulence  found in some other places I manage to book, but it more than makes up for it by being the place where my cares evaporate and I can relax when I walk through the door.  Already looking forward to being back in October for Dublin Web Summit!",5,2013,08,01
203,DO NOT STAY HERE,"We recently stayed at the Westbury Hotel.  Great Location, however the staff who work here are rude and obnoxious (especially the front desk ) They are especially rude to foreigners. I will give several reasons for this. First they refused to exchange foreign us dollars or pounds into euros.  Second, we asked several times for certain amenities which did not get delivered (we had to go downstairs to retrieve them, several different times).  Third, I am a fair and easy going person  for me to write a negative review is not the norm.  This is actually the first.  There are much better hotels in Dublin for the money especially for a so called 5 star hotel.  Again you have been warned. Do not stay HERE.",1,2013,07,31
203,POSH!,"This was a great stop for a one night stay, very central, if you are willing to splash out! Yummy breakfast too...deserves the 5 stars...Very efficient staff always at hand, did not have much interaction but presume it is somewhere most demands can be fulfilled!A very special place.",5,2013,07,31
203,Wonderful,"We had debated between this hotel and the Shelbourne, but opted for the Westbury on the recommendation of a long-time resident of Dublin.  This was by far the better choice.  The location is fabulous--a short walk to the upbeat, pedestrianized shopping area of Grafton Street, which has the luxury department store, Brown Thomas, an M&S with large food hall, and many popular shops and restaurants.  It is also walking distance to Trinity College Dublin (Book of Kells) and Dublin Castle (with the Chester Beatty Gallery). The d√©cor is modern, but not stark, obviously recent redone and of the highest quality.  Our room (we opted for the larger size) was huge by European standards and looked exactly like the photo on the hotel web site.  The AC was great, the TV large, the bathroom equipped with both tub and shower, with heated towel racks and toiletries by Aromatherapy Associates.  There were even cut-glass stemmed wine glasses above the mini-bar.  We felt thoroughly pampered.  The staff were efficient and extremely friendly.  This is a superb hotel in every way.  Recommendations:  Try the restaurant above the food shop, Fallon and Byrne, for an oasis of calm with great food.  The caf√©, Silk Road, at the Chester Beatty was also terrific for a casual lunch.  And for touring Dublin and the surrounding countryside, we loved Tour Dublin (private tours) which escorted us for two days and was one of the best experiences we've had in a major European city.",5,2013,07,31
203,"Outstanding+ Location, Location, LOCATION!","If you are visiting dublin, especially for the first time, this is the place you must stay.  Rooms, service, hotel overall in all areas is outstanding.  Comfort, clean, luxury, quality.  BUT even better, you truly could not improve upon location.  You walk left, right , straight, back...and you are in the middle of EVERYTHING.  Forget a map...just walk out front door in any direction, and you are in the heart of the best of Dublin.  Could not say enough great things about this hotel. I would not consider any place else on my next trip back.",5,2013,07,31
203,Beautiful suite,"We struck a heatwave in Dublin, appreciated the air con(  just wish it went colder)- very clean hotel with lovely facilities and very central to town. Big gripe the net and the hotel correspondence says it's on grafton street which of course it cant be..... It's a pedestrian street. Driving round and round drove us mad, I got out of the car and walked to hotel to find some help. They need to get it sorted",4,2013,07,29
203,Luxurious Treat!,I stayed at the Westbury hotel as part of a 40th Birthday gift. As the hotel had known in advance that it was my birthday I was upgraded to a suite upon arrival! What a surprise and terrific start to my stay! A delicious treat of a 'Happy Birthday' dessert platter was also delivered to my room. I was thoroughly spoiled and the staff were so friendly and utterly professional. The room was excellent and so comfortable with no detail overlooked. I cannot wait for a return visit!,5,2013,07,29
203,"Perfect location, gracious staff","My wife, two boys and I spent a night at the Westbury Hotel in Dublin this past week after spending a 6 days in the Irish countryside.  It was our first time to Dublin and we found the Westbury to be in the perfect location, in the heart of the action along Grafton Street. It was the ideal launching point for shopping, sightseeing and dinner.

From arrival to departure we found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Our boys were thrilled to find cookies in the room and teddy bears on their beds upon arrival.  Rachel from the guest relations greeted us in the lobby and graciously handled an ""odd"" laundry request that only parents can understand!

We enjoyed our visit and only wish it were longer.",5,2013,07,27
203,"First rate, but you must be willing to pay it:)","This hotel is wonderful!  Great location, beautiful, outstanding staff and very expensive!  If you have the money to spend, I would.  If you are wanting to spend our money on tours,then there are other hotels that are nice that would be great options.  Being on Grafton street was awesome for us and the hotel was so convenient:)",5,2013,07,27
203,"Not quite a ""leading"" hotel, but not bad.","The Westbury markets itself under the Leading Hotels of the World group. Having stayed in many of the others, I can‚Äôt say that the Westbury really deserves to be labeled as such. I mean, can it compare to, say, the Villa San Michele?  Yes, my expectations were high and so I was a bit disappointed: first by the lobby, which was clearly decorated in the go-go years of Dublin and seems to be suffering some sort of style identity crisis, but less so by the rooms ‚Äì a ‚Äújunior suite‚Äù, which was really just a large room with sitting area and small table. It was nicely done and not too worn, on the top floor looking out to the front of the hotel with a nice view of the city.  The hotel is well located, within walking distance of almost all the museum, shopping and theater.",4,2013,07,26
203,"Great location, comfy bed and delicious butter cookies!","I stayed her for 3 nites on business with some leisure activities in the evenings. Great location - right on Grafton St where all the wonderful shops and street musicians performs. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The bed was especially welcoming after a long day of meetings and social evening events. The rooms are clean and I had a great view of Grafton from room 414. When i first arrived, the room assigned was right in front of the elevators which i generally don't like due to potential noise level. The front desk was extremely accommodating and moved me to another room without delay.

They also have these absolutely scrumptious butter cookies by the coffee maker - not particular good for the waistline i am sure but worth the calories!

Overall a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend for leisure as well as business!",4,2013,07,24
203,Lap of Luxury,Having stayed at the Westbury on two previous occasions some years ago I was pleased to see that the same standards that set it apart from the crowd back then still apply today.  The location is excellent with all of central Dublin on your doorstep.  It is the perfect location for doing a spot of shopping on Grafton Street and there are numerous bars and restaurants all within a stones throw of the front door.  Our bedroom was spacious and very tastefully decorated.  The staff were all pleasant and helpfull and I particularly enjoyed our afternoon tea in the very spacious lounge area.  The only complaint I have is that our stay was far too short and we can not wait to return to the fabulous Westbury again.,5,2013,07,24
203,Great spot,"Very satisfied with our stay here. Staff very friendly and helpful (I have experienced the detachment of many upper end city hotel in other countries but no snobbery here).
Food (breakfast) very good choice and quality.
Rooms clean but I felt a bit on the small size for a hotel of its calibre - of course it is a city centre hotel.
One irritant was the addition of parking to our bill (as we were on a package that included parking). It is a constant bug bear of mine that establishment great and good try this on. In their defence it was removed as soon as pointed out.
On tip if your are driving here and using a Sat Nav - put in Clarendon Street as this will bring you to the correct entrance of the hotel, otherwise you may be going around in circles in the one way system of Dublin city.",4,2013,07,24
203,Wonderful hotel in a perfect location,"Had a wonderful stay and could not have been looked after better by the staff.  Everyone without fail was professional, friendly and helpful.  The rooms were lovely - spacious and beautifully decorated and the business facilities excellent.  We also used the bar and the restaurant - again both excellent.  Added to all this, the hotel is in such a fantastic location - a huge variety of shops, bars and restaurants on the doorstep.",5,2013,07,21
203,Nice hotel and great location,"This hotel is in the perfect location for anyone who is travelling to Dublin and wants to be in the heart of the city. It's a beautiful hotel right off the busy Grafton Street shopping district but tucked away in one of the side streets. We never needed our car while we were here. We walked everywhere and got a great feel for the city. The rooms were spacious. The beds were incredibly comfortable. The staff were very accommodating and we enjoyed dinner in the Cafe Novo that was located inside the hotel. Overall, just a great experience and a wonderful introduction to our first days in Ireland.",5,2013,07,20
203,Amazing!,"A perfect hotel experience! We came and celebrated my daughter's 18th birthday here and were treated like royalty. A card and treats left in our room for my daughter and exceptional service the whole 4 days! Niamh, Thomas, Rachel and so many more were so helpful. Our trip to Newgrange and hop on bus tour were all arranged ahead of time and great restaurant ideas too! A great city and this is the perfect location! Thank you!",5,2013,07,20
203,Loved this hotel...the best location in Dublin,"The location of this hotel is perfect for tourists. Easy walk to everything you will want to see. Great air conditioning in our room (important when visiting Ireland in the summer). Plenty of nice pubs and restaurants nearby. We arrived just in time for ""Tourist Thursday"" night which is a great time to visit the Temple Bar area of Dublin. (I think the Temple Bar area is better on Tourist Thursday as the tourists seem interested in the Trad (traditional music of Ireland) whereas on Saturday night the crowds seemed more interested in hooking up with each other. (maybe I'm just getting old....but the sleaze factor was high on Saturday evening and there was more Rock and Roll thatn Traditional music (IMHO)). Anyway, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin. Everyone told us how lucky we are to visit Ireland when it's sunny and hot (I suppose it's true but I prefer cool, overcast days.) Ireland is a wonderful country and we loved our visit.",5,2013,07,19
203,Only #6??,"Can't imagine what hotels #1-5 are like, but the Westbury had it all!  Spent two nights on our first trip to Dublin and just loved the hotel.  Between its two entrances on opposite streets, you are within walking distance of Grafton Street (read Fifth Avenue), Trinity College, the Gaiety Theatre, St. Stephens Green, the Liffey River and the museums.  Our room was quite fine, though a tad smaller than those we had in all the various castles in the countryside - not surprising, as city hotels everywhere generally have moderately-sized accommodations. The staff couldn't have been more helpful.  The concierge, learning that we were looking to take a walking tour, informed us of an (unadvertised) FREE one, which he had taken himself, to check on its quality. (And it was everything he promised.)  The front desk, learning that some clothing I had washed was not dry because the heated towel bar had not been activated, offered to send someone to collect it and put it in the hotel's laundry-room dryer at no charge.  
The breakfast was sumptuous, the coffee steaming hot and served in individual pots, everything served and cleared seamlessly.  As for the beautiful, comfortable Gallery Bar, would be happy to move in there!  We loved spending an hour in this wonderful place winding down with a nightcap after a long day. Particularly impressed by the unique floral arrangements decorating the tables.  They were absolutely the most beautiful I've seen anywhere.  The hotel has a gem in that florist!  Definitely would return.",5,2013,07,19
203,very good hotel in excellent location,"We stayed at the westbury for three nights and truly enjoyed it.  Our room was great, the staff was helpful, and the breakfasts were very good.  The location is superb:  a short walk from Trinity College, lots of restaurants, etc.  We rate it 4 instead of 5 stars because the Westbury is a bit pricey.  Even so, we certainly would stay at the Westbury the next time we are in Dublin.",4,2013,07,19
203,"Great location, perfect ambiance.","We stayed for 2 nights, to catch the Michael Bubl√© concert and do some shopping. Check in was very friendly and very efficient. The location couldn't be better for shopping, Brown Thomas is only a 2 min walk, it took approx 10 mins to walk to Abbey Street to catch the Luas to the Point. Our room, while not huge was very comfortable. Very comfortable arm chairs and a great coffee machine. Breakfast was excellent, plenty of choice from the cold buffet followed by pretty much whatever you would want from the √° la carte menu. The scrambled eggs were particularly good. Lunch in the Gallery was excellent and a great spot for watching the world go by. The staff were, without exception, very friendly and helpful. The Westbury would be our first choice when next in Dublin. ",5,2013,07,19
203,What a great location!,"Our cruise ended in Dublin, Ireland and we had booked a two night stay at this hotel before flying back to the USA. We were dropped off by a shuttle bus from the harbor along with 10 other guests. The reception was cordial and the check in process vey quick. Since we checked in early, our room was not ready yet, so we decided to take a walk in the area. The hotel is located just steps from Grafton Street, which is one of the main pedestrian shopping areas also a five minuet walk took us to St. Stephens Green, a large city park with lakes and many mature trees.
At two o'clock we went back to the hotel and were able to check into our room. Our room was on the fourth floor per our request and faced the back of the hotel which is much quieter than facing the street on which the hotel entrance is located. Our room was nicely furnished and had a well appointed bathroom with a shower over the tub and a single vanity. The queen sized bed was very comfortable and we had a great night's sleep. A continental breakfast was included and a full breakfast was available at an additional charge. We just had the continental breakfast and the variety was adequate with rolls, croissants, fruits, yogurt, various juices and coffee or tea.
The hotel boasts two restaurants, however, we only had breakfast at the hotel the two days we were there. What stood out was the friendliness of the staff. Everyone was extremely cordial and accommodating. We would not hesitate to stay a this hotel on a return visit to Dublin.",5,2013,07,19
203,Fabulous,"We thoroughly enjoyed our three night stay here and were very happy with our choice of hotel.  The location really couldn't be better but I wouldn't recommend driving to this hotel because it was very difficult to find by GPS.  

We stayed in a basic room and there really wasn't anything special about it but it was very functional had an amazingly comfortable bed.  The staff at the hotel were unbelievably friendly and helpful.  The level of service definitely defines this hotel as a five star property.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again but might consider upgrading my room.",5,2013,07,19
203,Just spend your money here.,"This place is 5 star and it shows. I ate, drank, and slept here for a few days and it was gnarly. I'm surprised they let me in the front door to be honest. Grand piano style. The bed was like sleeping on high priced hookers. Food was like 'butter' and the made a mean cocktail at side bar. If you wanna drop some cash this is the joint.",5,2013,07,19
203,"Classy, Comfortable Hotel In A Great Location","This is where I will be staying whenever I'm in Dublin.

1) Location.  If you draw an easy walking radius around the hotel, your circle will include virtually all the museums and other sites you'd want to see, plus shopping and restaurants  And it's the best of both worlds.  You are tucked away on a side street, but right in the heart of the area.

 2) Staff. We were met by a guest relations manager, Joseph, who took about 20 minutes out of his day to give us some fantastic advice on which things to see and how to get there while also giving us a fascinating history lesson of the City that ranged from pre-Viking to the modern era.

3) Attractive, comfortable, ultra-clean hotel with lots of classy touches.",5,2013,07,17
203,Great hotel & Great location,"We stayed for a weekend break. The hotel has a great central location with Brown Thomas being within 2 minutes walk. 
On arrival we were greeted by a very friendly doorman (Derek) who continued to be of great assistance for the rest of our visit.  Our room was lovely,overlooking the front of the building where there are 2 very lively bars, but great triple glazing means that you don't get disturbed by the noise. The following  we returned to the room at 3pm I had to call for housekeeping as nothing had been touched they did send someone to service it very quickly but did find this somewhat annoying as we had a quick turn around before going out for the evening. The following morning the Nespreso machine would not work and the teabags had not been replenished. 
We had the champagne afternoon tea and I have to say it was a huge disappointment. At ‚Ç¨36 pp I was expecting so much more. There was a poor selection of sandwiches and the tea was stewed and cold, we kept having to ask for fresh hot tea/water. i was also  disappointed that the waitress felt the need to vacuum the furniture rather than see to our needs. The breakfast selection is one of the best I have seen. Overall this is a lovely hotel that just needs a few tweaks here and there. It was a particularly busy weekend in Dublin with various events on so perhaps this added to the chaos.",4,2013,07,16
203,fantastic birthday at a great location,"Just stayed  one night at The Westbury but would have loved a few more nights.  From the moment we left our car to go into the lift to reception - the staff were extremely attentive and friendly.  The gentleman on reception knew it was my birthday as I mentioned it when booking and the lady must have noted it on our reservation :)

The bedroom was lovely bright, airy fresh and modern.  The toiletries are amazing - Aromatherapy   Associates products which I know and love.  So nice I took them all home with me! - Well it was my birthday ;)  After a lovely afternoon people gazing in the very near St Stephen Green we arrived back at our room to a lovely little plate of birthday cakes and a birthday card - so thoughtful, unexpected and delicious.

There are lovely restaurants nearby and shopping is round the corner.

breakfast was a lovely fresh plentiful selection of cereals, fruits, yougarts and bread and cakes as well as your choice of cooked breakfast and the staff are so attentive and friendly.

Parking is 20 euro a day but great to have it so central in the city.  highly recommend this spot and hope to visit again sometime.",5,2013,07,16
203,Excellent stay,"My wife and I stayed here when we first flew in to Ireland on our honeymoon.  We arrived at 8 a.m. and were severely jet-lagged.  My wife had emailed the hotel prior to our arrival and informed them that it was our honeymoon, and that we would be arriving early and if there was any way to check in early that we would appreciate it.  We didn't actually expect to be able to check in that early, but we went to the hotel to check our bags and they told us our room was ready -- this was at maybe 9:30 a.m. by that point.  They did not charge us extra.  They also left us some very delicious cupcakes and a very nice handwritten note from a manager wishing us a happy honeymoon.  Little things, yes, but the type of things you remember.  They had also upgraded our room to a larger suite at no charge.  

The room was excellent, all the facilities were in immaculate condition.  The bed was the most comfortable bed we found during our stay in Ireland.  The staff bent over backwards to be of service.  I found myself wandering in the lobby at 2 a.m. because I couldn't sleep and the night desk clerk brought me some water.  I would stay there again if my budget allowed it.",5,2013,07,15
203,Amazing Hotel,"Fantastic location,Polite curtious staff willing to help. Breakfast that will set you up for the day. Clean rooms and beds so comfortable they were hard to get out of.Could not fault our stay here. Hot towels to freshen up when you arrive and a bottle of chilled water when you left. Highly Recommend.",5,2013,07,15
203,A Perfect Hotel,"We had a large room that was spotlessly clean.  The location is excellent and only a short walk to almost everything you want to see in Dublin.  Breakfast in the dining room is excellent.

The service - incomparable!  Never in my travels have I meet such efficient  and courteous hotel  staff.  I left 6 shirts in a drawer after I checked out for a six day trip around Ireland.  By the time I realized it, we were at least 100 miles from the hotel.  I called the Concierge desk and at first they had some trouble locating the shirts.  But eventually, I spoke with Sharon in housekeeping and she had them all together.  Our last night was in Malahide, a small village close to the Dublin airport.  She arranged for them to be delivered by taxi to the hotel where we were staying. Fantastic customer service.  I only hope the Hotel Manager reads this and commends his staff for a job well done.

In my opinion, this is THE hotel to stay at when visiting Dublin.",5,2013,07,14
203,Perfect Location!,"This is a Beautiful hotel.  Very large room with more than enough ammenities.  Staff was very helpful and breakfast was lovely.  The hotel is in a terrific location for shopping, restaurants, and night life.",5,2013,07,12
203,"Perfect Location, Dedicated Staff","The Westbury is in a great location for walking around Dublin.  Close to Pubs, Trinity Church and St. Stephen's Green.  We easily walked to The Guinness Brewery.  The continental breakfast which was included in our package was delicious.  Ashley at the concierge desk was very helpful.  Some problems with wake-up calls but that was a minor issue.  The rooms could use a bit of a face-lift but I'd stay here again in a minute.  Very good value and truly delightful stay.",5,2013,07,10
203,Faultless 5 Star,"We were delighted to return to The Westbury for one night after three great nights over Christmas. It's quite simply the best hotel in Dublin. Afternoon tea is a must and the facilities,  breakfast and rooms are all simply stunning. But what sets the Westbury apart is the quality of the staff. They deserve enormous praise from the porters to the waiting staff and right up to management.  We were made to feel so welcome - the fruit and note in our room welcoming us back was a lovely touch and the conversations with Judit during our stay and Joe on our departure all added to a sense of familiarity and hospitality that we found to be genuinely impressive given how busy the hotel is and how many guests must be regular returners. If you can, stay at the Westbury and you'll see for yourself why you will want to come back. ",5,2013,07,10
203,Wonderful hotel in heart of city,"The Westbury Hotel was the perfect hotel for our family.  We had initially wanted to stay at The Shelbourne Hotel, but they could not accommodate four people in one room.  Friends recommended the Westbury and we could not have been more pleased.  The staff was wonderful.  They took down our mobile number upon check in so they could call us as soon as the room was ready, as we were trying to check in early.  They got a room ready within two hours of our arrival (which was about three hours prior to normal check in).  The concierges were very helpful.  The room was very large and comfortable for all of us.  Cafe Novo and the breakfast buffet were great.  Lunch in the lounge upon our arrival could not have been better.  The location was perfect.  We were walking distance to everything we wanted to see.  My kids are 6 and 9.  This was a perfect place for us and we will highly recommend it to anyone.",5,2013,07,09
203,Recent stay at the Westbury Hotel,"Just had another amazing stay at the Westbury, thank you to Rachel in Customer Relations and the rest of the professional, friendly, smiling staff.
This hotel excells at every level, from the check-in to the room and what a surprise that was, a suite which was beautifully decorated and immaculate.
This is an excellent hotel focused on providing personalised service.
 Thank you.",5,2013,07,07
203,Really enjoyed the Westbury!,"My husband and I stayed here 2 nights and had a great experience.  It was a beautiful room and extremely comfortable bed.  The Westbury has the best continental breakfast I've ever had - a big selection of pastries and breads, juices, fruits, plus yogurt & granola, and meat and cheese platters.  They also have hot breakfast menu items for order; I didn't try them but the ones that came to others in the dining area looked fantastic.  

The only negative to this place is that it's just off Grafton street (which I know many see as a positive) - but if you are driving, like we were, it's impossible to find because you cannot take your car on Grafton street, which we were unaware of until we got there.  Our GPS refused to take us there, so it was a bit of a pain.  The upside of this is that it's within decent walking distance of just about anywhere you want to go in Dublin.

Other than that, it's a wonderful place to stay.  The desk staff even gave us a couple complimentary bottles of water for our travels upon checkout - nice touch.",5,2013,07,07
203,"Lovely hotel, friendly & helpful staff, fabulous location","The best location right in the centre of the city, the staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful, food was great both in the Wilde restaurant and Cafe Novo. We had a lovely room that was well serviced, maybe the bathroom could have been larger for the level of room that we'd chosen. We had a fabulous 3 night break.",5,2013,07,05
203,Presidential Suite = sweet,"Located just steps from Grafton Street, this hotel showcases a great location with fantastic service. We arrived at hotel early and they were quick to accommodate our stay. Our stay this time was in the Presidential Suite and we were very pleased. 
A few steps out the front door and you're in the mix of Dublin's pubs, restaurants and shopping. ",5,2013,07,04
203,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent Hotel in a fantastic location right in the centre of town, with multiple food, drink and shopping options footsteps from the door and the Luas Light rail and transport links with a couple of hundred metres.

The hotel itself is clean, crisp, comfortable, with excellent customer service, very efficient staff, and a great atmosphere to help you relax and enjoy your stay.

I travel a lot, I will definitely stay here again, says 5 stars, it is 5 stars and was very good value.

Travelled with my wife on a business / couples trip and it worked perfectly well to accommodate both.",5,2013,07,04
203,Great Hotel,"My husband, daughter (7) and myself had a wonderful 5 days at the Westbury!  The location is perfect for walking around the Grafton street and the city.  The room was clean and well appointed.  Room service was wonderful.  I would highly recommend the high tea in the lobby bar.",5,2013,07,04
203,5-Star Service,"Beating a dead horse here as the reviews that note the Westbury's awesome location (in the heart of Grafton Street and just steps from great shopping, an ATM and local vendors selling fresh flowers); its beautiful exterior and lobby area (one of our trip highlights was sipping on hot whiskeys near the lobby's fireplace); and fantastic service are spot-on.

The concierge was especially impressive and helpful when I discovered my Visa account had been frozen after failing to notify the bank of my travels, and my accidentally (and stupidly!) selecting ""no"" in response to the bank's email to me asking if I thought the charges were fraudulent. When I asked the concierge for help, he had the bank on the line in seconds and navigated through the many automated prompts until I reached an agent. He was super attentive, accomodating and patient and exactly the kind of help you hope to find at a five-star hotel.

A somewhat minor caveat: Our room, while clean and comfortable, was pretty average in appearance, and the bathroom was a bit of a disappointment after experiencing the rain shower-heads at The Gibson.

Regardless, The Westbury is a great hotel, with a can't-be-beat location, and an all-star staff.",5,2013,07,03
203,Wonderful Hotel!,"Stayed for just 1 night, we wished we were staying for more! Location is wonderful - just off Grafton Street, a shoppers paradise.  Check-in was really quick and staff were very attentive.  Our room was on the fourth floor and was a fabulous junior suite.  The bathroom was huge!  The Nespresso machine was a nice touch.  The 4 poster bed was so comfortable.  There is an underground car park which is included in the room rate.  Breakfast was gorgeous and the restaurant was superb.  All in all, our stay was wonderful and we look forward to staying again.",5,2013,07,03
203,Fabulous!,"We were fortunate to have stayed here on a recent tour through Ireland.  Our tour operator handled all the accommodations, and at each destination, we were treated to the finest.  Dublin was our last stop and truly was the best for last!  We walked in and were immediately escorted to a lovely room overlooking the courtyard area in the front of the hotel, wonderful view!  The service was outstanding, from the front desk, bellman, waitstaff and housekeepers.  We were there for two nights, and wished we could have stayed longer.  We fell in love with Dublin, and I think part of that was due to staying at this location.  You are centrally located and can walk to easily to all  the sites and restaurants. The rooms were modern, clean and spacious, and the bathrooms beautiful as well as lovely toiletries.  They have an amazing breakfast buffet which was outstanding.  If we ever get the chance to visit Dublin, this is the place we'll stay!",5,2013,07,02
203,luxury and great location,This hotel is wonderful.  Wonderful attention to details without feeling too stuffy. The breakfast is terrific. The location can't be topped - just off Grafton St. and close to St. Stephen's Green. Rooms are on the small side but very comfortable.,5,2013,07,02
203,A little piece of heaven,"I recently had the pleasure of returning to The Westbury after what had been too long away!  As always the stay was wonderful. 
From the moment I exited the taxi, before even getting to the door, there was a welcome smile from the doorman - a brightness in the dreary rainy morning. Inside, everything was as bright and shiny as a new penny; and a big plus ‚Äì no wait to check in, even at the busy 8am checkout hour.  
The room itself was impressive - large, bright, and impeccably clean. The perfect blend of traditional meets modern ‚Äì a theme to be carried through he hotel in every way.  Once the door closed a wonderful silence descended that left you alone to enjoy the complimentary toffees and fluffy pillows in a wonderful four poster bed from which you could see the Dublin rooftops out the window.  (The Dublin skyline isn't known for being comparable to NY or Tokyo or Sidney, but it has its own allure.)  I later learned just how incredibly comfortable the bed was, how the pillows didn‚Äôt want to let go the next morning, and how amazing it was that I hadn‚Äôt heard a peep all night despite the Dublin Thursday night summer nightlife outside on the street.  The bathroom was huge ‚Äì coming from NY most bathrooms are large! But this was really spacious ‚Äì bigger than most New York apartments, never mind bathrooms! Double sink and marble tops and great lighting ‚Äì which could be adjusted to soak in the nice big tub.  Time for breakfast first though!
Sipping on my morning coffee in the Gallery Dublin woke up and came alive - outside on Grafton Street you saw the hustle and bustle of people hurrying to work while shutters rose, the flower vendors set up their roses and lilies, and the pubs set up the umbrellas to cater for the outdoor lunch in mist!  Inside though, there was a still calmness despite the suits and heels that came and went about their business over coffee and orange juice.  No better place to conduct a morning meeting than a super comfortable armchair with ever present great service just as and when you needed it. The staff were all friendly but not overbearing, and knew when to disappear and when to assist as they surveyed from a distance.  Despite the presence of a significant number of people the Gallery never felt crowded and your thoughts were never drowned out by the chatter at other tables.   
Lunchtime in the Gallery was equally impressive.  The pianist playing the Fields of Athenry in the background being the perfect touch of Ireland and the soup and ""brown bread"" confirming you were truly home, while the deconstructed cheesecake confirmed it was a new and modern contemporary home.  Best cheesecake ever just adding to the slice of heaven the stay had already been and I hadn‚Äôt yet made it past lunchtime.",5,2013,07,02
203,Great location,"The hotel is in a fantastic location easy walking distance to shopping, attractions and restaurants. 
The staff were extremely helpful from the moment we checked in until we left. The Gallery is a great spot to enjoy a champagne and watch Dublin go by for a couple of hours.
The rooms were clean, comfortable and have all you need for a enjoyable stay. We will certainly be staying here when we return to Dublin",4,2013,07,02
203,Wonderful and Memorable Stay in Dublin,"I'm reminded again what a 5-star hotel is all about: the wonderfully appointed rooms, the helpful and attentive staff, and all the little extras that make the stay memorable.
The Hotel is centrally located just of Grafton Street, with many of Dublin's attractions not far away.
Dinner at the ""Wilde"" restaurant was excellent, especially the Rump of Lamb, which was superb.  On the down side, a ""Light Breakfast"" at Cafe Novo was provided as part of our room rate, but this did not hit as high a note as Wilde, and regret not paying the the supplement to upgrade. Wifi was free, though tended to be slow; gym was not really adequate at all.",5,2013,07,01

Room 601. However we did have some very noisy neighbors you could hear everything through the walls.

203,comfortable classic in downtown Dublin,"A very nice, classic hotel conveniently located in downtown Dublin.  Quiet, comfortable, spacious room.  Pleasant lobby for drinks and snacks.  Good service from the concierge.  Wi-fi a bit spotty in the rooms.",5,2013,06,23
203,"Beautiful Hotel, Wonderful Staff, Perfect Location","My boyfriend and I took a trip to Ireland this June for a holiday. We had never seen Ireland before, so we decided to tour around and see as much as we could. Our first stop was Dublin, and the Westbury Hotel. The staff were so nice, the room and the property so beautiful, and the location was key. As first time visitors to Dublin, it was perfect to be able to walk out the front door and be in the center of it all, and walking distance to most of the attractions. The staff themselves were helpful, friendly, and truly welcoming. They made us feel right at home. All in all, one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in, anywhere in the world.",5,2013,06,21
203,Second time around still excellent!,"After staying a week at the Westbury for a very busy business trip in February our review of this hotel would have been excellent. However, knowing we would be back in June for a short private stay, we decided to wait with publishing our review and see if our new experience would back up the great experience we had before. Well... all the more so! 
The staff is very kind and helpful; they take their time for you and are efficient in backing each other up when it gets crowded. And the smiles are all around, from the door to the desk, the lounge to the bar and the corridors. These things do matter and it seems management has got it right. Both for business and pleasure it is a real treat to stay at the Westbury!",5,2013,06,19
203,Expensive but elegant,"Last time I stayed in Dublin I stayed at the Shelbourne and was somewhat disappointed with the room. No such issues here the room was a good size with every convenience you would expect. Service is again very high quality. But what it lacks is the atmosphere of the Shelbourne, it doesn't really feel like you have stayed in a Dublin hotel. So I guess the answer is to stay and the Westbury but drink and eat at the Shelbourne.",4,2013,06,19
203,westbury Hotel Dublin,"My Wife and I plus son stayed at this hotel last Weekend, the hotel is without a doubt situated
in a great location we had 1 or 2 issues as regards the breakfast room these were small issues
I have to  say that the staff at reception are very helpful in particular I must compliment the
door staff and valets who have a very difficult and busy job to do.
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to stay in a top class hotel right
in the middle of Dublin",4,2013,06,18
203,Elegance At Its Best,"Although I was not privileged to stay at this utopian hotel, I recently had the opportunity to have a treat of Afternoon Tea. It was absolutely perfect with a great myriad of little scones, sandwiches and pastries. I would highly recommend for you all to indulge and pamper yourself to the fantastic Afternoon Tea.",5,2013,06,17
203,Pre Christmas Treat,"As Dubliners, sometimes there is nothing nicer than booking into a hotel in your own city and enjoying the atmosphere and ambience you sometimes take for granted or miss. With a late dinner in the city and an early business meeting the following morning, we decided to spoil ourselves and book a room for the night. Best decision ever - the room was sumptious and very comfortable. It was perfect for freshening up after a day in the office and before hitting the town for a mid week night out. With Christmas just around the corner, the hotel was in full festive flow and nicely decorated. I would agree with another comment posted about the thin walls, while it made no impact on me on checking in, the next morning we could hear everything from the room next door. While it suited us, having to also rise early, if I was staying for leisure, I would have been furious.  It won't stop me from returning though and I look forward to finding another reason to check in and treat ourselves again.",4,2013,06,17
203,"Average service, very average rooms, lobby is nice","I stayed here for two nights on a business trip. The hotel lobby is nice but everything else about it is very very average.

I woke up at 7am to a massive vibration noise and had to call the reception 3 times to find out what it was and if they could do anything about it. half hour later the reception called me to say it is outside construction and there is nothing they could do about it. And it ended at that. The hotel was rather empty so I wondered if they could've offered to switch me to a room on the other side, or have been proactive and done that in the first place. When I arrived there was no one at the door to help with my luggage either. 

The property is old and the hallways and the rooms don't create a refreshing experience. It's an experience of a 20-year old hotel. I have to say it is not very well-maintained either. The flowers on the reception desk were dried. I came to my room and the Nspresso machine was broken and one of the cups was slightly dirty. 

If you have to stay here, stay. But there will not be anything wowing about this hotel.",3,2013,06,17
203,Absolutely the Best in Dublin,"The Westbury is a delight in every way - location, rooms, service, food, staff, decor and vibe.  

Location -- right on Grafton street.  Shops, cafes, restaurants and much more are right at the door step of this hotel.  It really does not get much better in terms of location.  

Rooms - very spacious, comfortable beds, modern and clean lines, nespresso machine, televesion, great bathroom, and free wifi (need I say more!).

Service -- the staff are willing to help with anything and always smiling.  Service is really efficient with lots of warmth and friendliness.  From the reception to housekeeping to restaurant staff - everyone I encountered was great.

Food -- wow!  This hotel really gets it right. Plenty of choices and each one is excellent! The casual cafe/restaurant is a wonderful place to have global tapas.  ""Wilde"" is the more formal and upscale restaurant in the hotel.  Their is also afternoon tea service in a wonderful open area off the lobby with views of Grafton street.  Highly recommend the casual bistro in the hotel.

I cannot recommend the Westbury enough.  It will definitely be my home whenever I return to Dublin.",5,2013,06,16
203,Top Hotel,"We stayed at The Westbury  Hotel on Friday 14th June. We had a drink in the Bar last year when we were in Dublin and said we must stay there next year. As soon as we arrived from the first member of staff who took our bags and parked our car until the last member who we paid the bill with you couldn't of got any better, they were very professional but also very friendly. The hotel lived up to and surpassed  what we were expecting I must say this is one of the nicest Hotels we have ever stayed at and we have stayed at a lot all over the world. We had a couple of drinks in the bar before dinner and it was as good as last year great staff. We had dinner at the Wilde restaurant and again staff were fantastic,  the food we had was really good as good as we have had it any Michelin star restaurant. We will be going back next year if not sooner because it is that good. I love Dublin but the only way they could improve the hotel is to move it to somewhere with warmer climate. Can't wait to go back.",5,2013,06,16
203,Best Hospitality,Best location and service. Staff is so good they take care about everything guest need. Food is also very good and location is amazing.Rooms have all you need .we enjoyed our stay their we strongly recommend this property.,5,2013,06,16
203,Would have been perfect but...,"The decor, staff and general service were absolutely great. Unfortunately, the stay was marred by being woken up one morning about 8am to loud drilling and hammering.
I rang reception to ask if they could stop it and they said it was a building next door. I rang again when I was convinced it was in the building. They checked with the manager and confirmed there was some 'regular maintenance' going on. They said they'd ask them to keep it down but there isn't really a way to drill quietly is there? They gave me some ear plugs, which was nice. Obviously would have preferred to have a nice lie in though!
It was pretty annoying that no one seemed to think that you shouldn't schedule 'regular maintenance' in a 5 star hotel at 8 in the morning?!",3,2013,06,14
203,Vacation at ireland!,"Stayed there with the family , great hotel , great staff absolutley perfect location....I would recommend it to friends.. 
Would stay here again..Walking distance to shops , pubs , restaurants...And cafes.........",5,2013,06,13
203,If you want excellent service - this is THE place,"On a recent trip to Ireland I spent my last night at this hotel before an early morning flight. I only wish I'd have stayed there longer.  From the moment my driver pulled in the service was exceptional.  The doorman not only took care of storing golf clubs and seeing my luggage to the room but arranged for a driver to the airport and made sure the room was in top shape and that I was appraised of all the features from Wi-Fi to coffee pot operation.  The Desk Clerk was similarly helpful and made the check in and checkout processes quick and easy. The room was very well appointed, comfortable and very modern and clean. I received an early morning wake up call and coffee delivery promptly. You cannot go wrong if you like quality accommodations and terrific service - I will stay at this and other Drake properties again. The hotel is also in the Temple Bar area with many restaurants, pubs, shops and entertainment within walking distance.",5,2013,06,13
203,wonderful,"I spent 3 nights at this hotel last weekend and i have to say it was excellent. My parents joined us for dinner at the restaurant which is in the hotel it's called Wilde, the staff were lovely as was the food. After dinner we had drinks in the lounge area which is very glamorous classy and comfortable we all had a wonderful evening and look forward to staying there again the next time we visit Dublin.",5,2013,06,12
203,Perfect!,"Wanted to stay at this hotel when I first started looking at Dublin hotels.  Unfortunately it was too expensive.  Thankfully right before the trip, I checked again and they were offering a deal so I booked it for our two nights in Dublin.  Unfortunately our flight was delayed and we only got to stay one night.  The location is perfect.  Within steps to Grafton Street and everything worth seeing in Dublin.  Very walkable.  Love the bellmen and their hats...hehe.  Front desk was super friendly, helpful.  Complimentary water bottles were nice, even offered one when we checked out.  Room was clean with the added touches of slippers, robes, chocolates on our pillows.  The bathroom was huge and full of extras.  Great strong hair dryer, not the kind attached to the wall.  Room was small, but I'm used to that in Europe and you shouldn't be spending time in the room anyway.  I'd be happy to stay here again and would recommend it to anybody.",5,2013,06,10
203,Terrible rooms,I would expect better quality from hotels that are 90 euro per night. Horrible room overlooking air conditioning units. I would never stay there again. Dingy furnishings. There are much better hotels near by.,1,2013,06,10
203,"Fab, safe location","Stayed in this superb hotel with my sister. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the concierge and door men were simply 5 star. They were incredibly helpful and courteous. We could not find the car park however this is not an issue as the car is parked for you. The attentiveness was also professional and friendly without being overbearing. Our room, a twin was beautifully appointed. The only downside on a warm July evening was the heat in our room that night. We both had little or no sleep due to an air conditioning unit which was not working properly. No, we did not call anyone to the room to sort the problem in the early hours however the duty manager was extremely apologetic the following morning and deducted the overnight parking charge. However superb location for two women needing a central location. Recommend the rustic stone for dining also.",4,2013,06,09
203,Last Minute Surprise,I had the pleasure of recently staying in the Westbury. After a long journey I found myself needing a place to stay with short nortice. I had heard that teh Westbury was nice and decided to see for myself. Staff were friendly and curteous when I arrived for my late check in. An added bonus of an unexpected upgrade was an invaulable addition to a weary traveller almost at the end of his journey. I only wish I had more time for my stay and I'm hoping to stay again in the near furture - this time for longer. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visting Dublin and I have already recommeneded it to friends andf colleagues.,5,2013,06,09
203,"great staff,  even better location, but getting a bit chipped and dated","Pros:

This is a GREAT location.   Right nearby Trinity, St Stephens  Green, lots of shopping and excellent restaurants.   Easy location to get to and navigate.   This is my third stay in Dublin, and I found this area a nice change form the loud streets of Temple bar area.

Lovely staff, eager to help.   Got chased down by a housekeeper to hand me chocolates.    

Free Wifi in all rooms (such a breath of fresh air to some hotel chains)

neat nespresso cup machines in every room

Cons/Rooms:  
Contemporary style , but starting to show signs of wear and tear disproportionate to the reputation of the hotel.   The mattress was sagging (big no no for this level of hotel),  the bathroom had several chips in the woodwork and I am pretty sure I saw mold at the bottom of the sink.    Had to open window as the thermostat was blasting heat on despite lowering the setting.   

Room tip:  ask for a quiet room as the noise from the street can be disturbing.",4,2013,06,07
203,Superb. Well worth a visit.,"Stayed here recently on our wedding anniversary and couldn't have had a better experience. The staff were superb, so accommodating.  Super location to explore the best of Dublin. Gorgeous room, with lots of little luxuries for us. Breakfast was delicious.  Highly recommended. ",5,2013,06,07
203,Wonderful Stay In Dublin,My wife and I visited Ireland from the U.S. for 10 days and spent the first two nights at The Westbury Hotel.  The hotel was in an IDEAL location and the staff was superb!  It was a great way to begin our vacation!,5,2013,06,07
203,Great weekend saved by the Westbury,"After being let down by a booking error on the part of another city centre hotel, we managed to get a room in the Westbury, and what a great thing that was. The Westbury staff were absolutely brilliant in the level of support and friendliness, the location is central to all you could want in Dublin, and the room and service were excellent. Will definitely stay there for any return trips.",5,2013,06,06
203,wonderful !,"we stayed 3 days in Dublin and choose the ""Westbury"" for its location, right off Grafton Street.  We just wanted to park the car and walk through Dublin.....you can't pick a better hotel for a visit to Dublin.  We walked everywhere and one in our party is in a wheelchair.....so when I say The Westbury is convenient to everything it really is.  We relaxed in the evening in the bar and had tea overlooking Grafton St. and watched the world go by.  The hotel is clean,the rooms are big and beautiful & the staff is very friendly and helpful.",5,2013,06,06
203,A working experience at The Westbury,"I recently organised a corporate event in my home town for colleagues who flew in from all over the world.  It was my first time working with the incredible events team at The Westbury.  From my first visit to check out their meeting rooms and accommodation until we waved off the last guest at the end of our event, the team could not have done more to make us feel welcome.  The Westbury Suite is a dedicated meeting area for clients with adjoining foyer for coffee and iPhone breaks.  The room was a perfect size for our group, well proportioned and full of natural daylight.  The catering staff were charming and pleasant and the food was superb throughout.  
My colleagues were astounded at the location and, given our packed agenda, appreciated the proximity to Grafton Street which allowed for easy access for some retail therapy Irish style!  The nespresso machines in the bedrooms got a big thumbs up from everyone.
After an intense couple of long working days, I reluctantly left the Westbury for the last time.  Even though it was most definitely work that brought me there, the staff made the experience a relaxed and positive one from start to finish.  Even as a native, I could appreciate the very special Irish charm of this hotel and I can't wait to go back, next time for pleasure!",5,2013,06,06
203,Chic is just a nick name,"I was in this hotel for a whole week and I loved it. The convenience of being in Grafton Street is great. I was able to walk everywhere and with the selection of all restaurants around, it made my stay a lot better. The hotel is nice, clean and very comfortable. The amenities are well done and the sleeping quality very nice. The rooms are a little small and the front desk not very helpful, but that is an Irish thing, I know that. For the rest I would definitely stay again. Very nice hotel.",4,2013,06,05
203,Just faultless & fabulous !!!,Had a wonderful stay here with my husband.beautiful room..staff very friendly & nothing is too much trouble...a lot of little extras too that were a treat & a surprise. ..Amazing place to stay for the location also...spoiled for choice of restaurants and bars and shops....,5,2013,06,03
203,Wedding Perfection,"Myself and my husband got married here on 1st September 2012. The whole day was perfect. We were so impressed particularly with Catherine in events who made sure the whole thing ran without hitch. All the staff and management over the entire weekend were amazing, from when we dropped off our luggage on the Friday night until we departed on honeymoon early Monday morning. We've had so many compliments on the hotel/service/food I've lost count. Thanks Catherine & the rest of the staff at the Westbury for making our day so wonderful",5,2013,06,02
203,Wonderful 5 star experience,"Upon arrival to the reception lobby we felt at home, staff very courteous and diligent on the check in. Received very good recommendation for dining at the Wilde restaurant in the hotel premises, try the good selection of martinis at the Bar. The room was nicely appointed and spacious. We stayed for three days and was surprised that the Manager remember our names to perfection , definitely the best hotel experience I've ever had. Will return to the Westbury If I ever go back to Dublin again.

203,Pure luxury,Westbury staff made our stay for husband's 40th so very special. A 5star experience!! Had yummy lunch then ordered room service later in evening the food is exceptional.Only wish we had stayed extra night!!,5,2013,05,28
203,"Location, location, location...","Stayed here on a few occasions and its hard to beat if visiting Dublin city centre. Within a stone throw to grafton street, shopping, bars and restaurants. Very elegant large lobby area which always has a good atmosphere, seems to be a great hit for afternoon tea. Rooms very comfortable and cosy with all 5 star amenities. If you are looking for more casual area in Hotel they have a nice cafe bar downstairs that does great cocktails.",5,2013,05,27
203,Worth evey penny!,"Perfect situated in the center of Dublin. Fantastic hotel with proffesional staf that will tale care of all yor needs. Our room was on the topfloor, away from all noice on the street ( mini suite )perfect service 24 hours aday. If I ever get back to Dublin, this is where I will stay,",5,2013,05,27
203,If you want to be in the center ... of e everything what is great in Dublin,"The location of the hotel is really great. In the middle of the center, close to the biggest shopping street, close to many attractions and very good restaurants. Most probably not the cheapest hotel in the town but offering great services, delicious breakfast, very nice lobby with great view and nice range of drinks :) rooms are comfortable, very clean, well ... maybe the bad is too ""soft"" for people with spine/back problems. I was positively by the breakfast menu, for one hand you would say a standard one but served in a non-standard way:) very good for couples.",4,2013,05,26
203,Wow factor!,"From the moment we arrived we knew we were in for a treat. We had been travelling all day and were offered hot towels while we were checking in. As we had not eaten, we opted for afternoon tea. Although it was busy we were shown to table by the window, while our bags were taken up to our room. We received great care & attention and really enjoyed our tea. 

We also had the chance to try Wilde for dinner. The food was good but I think they can do a bit better. Our room was lovely, although slightly too hot (until we figured out how to adjust it!).  Bed was very comfortable, nice linen and lovely decorative features. It was clean and bathroom was great (particularly liked the Aromatherapy Associates products). Hotel is in the perfect central location and walking distance to most things.

Had lunch in the Cafe and the food was excellent, plus there was proper coffee being served, which you don't find too easily these days.

We will definitely stay here again!!",5,2013,05,26
203,Fabulous downtown,FIve star service and facilities - well earned. Great location. Perfect place to get your batteries recharged after that long night flight. Be sure to ask for a quiet room on the back of the hotel. Otherwise your room will be awash in ORANGE from the lIghting on the the front all night long.,5,2013,05,26
203,Simply outstanding - again.,"This was my 5th time at the Westbury, and it's quite simply the best hotel in Dublin, and probably one of the best hotels worldwide.  Concierge was delightful, reception staff so professional that it's evident they take pride in providing such excellent customer service.  The rooms are stunning and the bathroom was spotless.  There were 4 of us in the room and the extra towels, 4 robes and 4 cups/saucers and spoons provided for in-room tea and coffee show the attention to detail that's tailored for guests' needs.  At the restaurant, our needs were anticipated and the staff were excellent at suggesting off menu alternatives for specific dietary needs. The only fault I have with the hotel is that it has set the bar so high, I am disappointed when staying in other hotels as they cannot compare to Westbury standards.  I cannot understand how it is not no. 1 on tripadvisor and cannot wait to return in 
August.",5,2013,05,22
203,Fantastic Service,"This hotel is in a really great location and is on the door step of the heart of Dublin. This is definitely what I would call a 5* hotel. Every single member of staff was fantastic and remembered our party. It was a shame we were only here for the weekend as I would loved to have spent more time in the hotel, particularly the lovely lounge having another high tea.

Would only stay here next time im in Dublin",5,2013,05,22
203,Not Dissapointed.,"I stay here at least once a year, more often twice and it always delivers. The location is ideal. You can walk anywhere a tourist would want to go. The breakfast is the best ! 
It holds onto its traditional values whilst keeping modern. ‚Ç¨25 from airport in taxi, nice and easy. 
 Can't wait to be back!",4,2013,05,20
203,The best hotel in Dublin,"Everything was perfect and I mean perfect.

At the Westbury, they certainly make you feel like family. Upon arrival we were met by the concierge, one of which claimed that he recognised me from my last stay (not entirely impossible). Car was taken as was our luggage. Check in was swift, proficient and we were given hot moist towels which were welcome after our long journey to Dublin. Our twin room was bright, clean, spacious, very comfortable with quality toiletries and linens / towels. We did have breakfast in the hotel which was lovely.
Now on to the one of the key attractions of the Westbury, the location, you are but 20m from Grafton street. Shopping bliss! Brown Thomas with all of its designer gear accompanied with all of the rest of the shops on Dublins best shopping street. There are also lots of lovely bars restaurants and coffee shops in the immediate locality. More than enough to cater for a good night out. Clubs and gay bars in the close locality too!  ",5,2013,05,18
203,Great stay,"We had a great weekend at the Westbury. Large room, very comfortable bed. Nice bathroom. 
The hotel is very beautiful, beautiful artwork. Very nice atmosphere, and perfect location - close to everything. The breaktfast was fantastic! We will be back.",5,2013,05,18
203,K & M,"Excellent Hotel. Lovely Decor. Nice, comfortable rooms. Fantastic location- right in the heart of Dublin City. But most of all: the service!! 
All Members of Staff throughout the house are welcomg, proffesional and friendly. They are genuine in a way they treat the hotel guest and you can feel it every step of the way. On my recent stay in the Westbury just before I collected the luggage I have left my engagement ring in the Ladies Bathroom by the Reception area. I have only discovered the fact following afternoon. I contacted the hotel and spoke to Thomas in the Concierge who showed concern and acted very promptly contacting relevant departments and the Duty Manager. Within a short while i have received a phonecall my engagement ring was found and it was kept in the safe.
Cafe Novo serves tasty food and great coctails ( best daiquiri ever!), has a nice ambience and provides a lovely service. We liked it so much we dined there twice there enjoying relaxed atmosphere. Its fantastic shopping location! We walked back from the O2 Theatre after the Beyonce's concert. And we are staying there again next week on our visit to Dublin!",5,2013,05,16
203,Wonderful,"Excellent location. Friendly, courteous and helpful staff. The room was much larger than anticipated and the beds were marvelous. Afternoon tea was delightful. I would definitely stay at the Westbury again!",5,2013,05,16
203,Major Attraction,"Very central to shopping,pubs and restaurants.Expensive,staff friendly and helpful.Dont expect big room but practical,shower not great, lot of water goes on floor!
Recommend for its situation but bring Gold credit card!",4,2013,05,15
203,Night at the O2 Theatre,"I usually stay at the Shelbourne when staying in Dublin, but even the recent renovations don't make up for the slip in service there...so I gave The Westbury Hotel a try.  The Westbury Hotel is in a great location, just off Grafton Street; which is a hub of activity.  I walked back from the O2 Theatre after the Eric Clapton concert (a good stretch of the legs), so virtually everything I wanted to do in Dublin can be done from the Westbury.  I was given an upgraded room at registration (a corner twin queen) directly across from the exercise room.  I had the concierge have a bucket of ice delivered to the room for cocktail hour and he made reservations for dinner at The Blackboard Bistro...with a follow-up call to my room 10 minutes later.  Before arriving, Deidre Dwyer in the Administration Department made sure I had the room I needed and confirmed my arrival time.  No detail is too small for the staff to attend to.  This is what separates The Westbury Hotel from The Shelburne...service that makes the customer feel cared for and appreciated.
I want to add that the breakfast was first rate and a great break from the Full Irish treatment I had all the previous week...felt like I came from a shipwreck to a Roman Feast!  I would give them a six (6) for service if Trip Advisor would allow it; these folks get it.",5,2013,05,14
203,Classy and Convenient,"We chose this hotel because of its reputation, and overall we were pleased with our selection.  We also knew others who have stayed here and recommended the hotel.  

We booked a four poster studio suite, but we received an upgrade to a four poster luxury suite.  A double door entry opened to a very large living room.  The center piece of the room was a long and very deep couch that could easily sit five people.  There was also a large chair, big coffee table, a good desk, and a fair amount of cabinet space.  A large TV was set against one wall.  The room was stylish, but the muted color pallet made the room have a somewhat bland look.  The bedroom was good size with two closets, but neither was big enough to hold our bags.  Both rooms had large windows which allowed each room to have good daylight.  Furniture in both rooms was on the firm side.  The bathroom was big with a modern look and design.  The free standing shower, however, was very small and not built-in.  There was also a tall wood tower for the towels that was cheap looking.  The bathroom was perfectly nice, but fell far short of what many people would expect at a five star hotel, especially for one of their most expensive rooms.  

We had breakfast each morning in Wilde.  The room had a dark and glamorous look and a good standard Irish buffet was provided.  One morning it was very busy because of a tour group, but the staff worked very hard and service was not affected.  The next morning it was blissfully quiet. We did not have tea in The Gallery, but it is a very elegant and attractive space with bay windows overlooking the streetscape, and a fireplace at the far end. There is also a very nice separate bar room.    

The hotel has a gym, but it really should not.  It is in a very small, unattractive and kind of pointless.  There was a sign in the room that mentions that there is a nearby gym and pool available for a fee.

As everyone mentions, the location of the hotel is perfect, it really is just about in the center of where most tourists plan to visit.  We are not sure what the big deal is about Grafton Street, the streets behind the hotel are more interesting and less busy.

We brought a car into the city and with detailed advanced directions, we found the hotel, although it is tricky. Valet parking was 20 euros per night which we thought was reasonable.  

Although we were a little disappointed with the look and comfort of our room, we were still pleased with our stay.  The public spaces of the hotel are beautiful, the staff friendly and helpful, and the location spot on.  Overall, that adds up to a good stay.",4,2013,05,12
203,Nice location,"Great location for visiting the city, staff extremely helpful, had dinner in the Wilde resturant but it lacked atmosphere due to small number of people eating there. Also had problem with connecting door in bedroom,  our neighbour speaking loudly on phone before seven in the am.",4,2013,05,12
203,Without doubt one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in!,"Hotel should be called The Bestbury not The Westbury!  Originally I booked a deluxe double room for a girlie weekend in Dublin to celebrate my sister's biggie birthday and wanted a 5* hotel near Grafton Street to do shopping etc . To be honest, the room allocated to us had some serious issues and we were pretty underwhelmed but decided to let matters rest as it had been a long day already though in passing we mentioned our grievances to the turn-down maid who immediately contacted Paul Prior, the duty manager and instantly we were transported to an unparalleled universe! The two of us were upgraded to a suite EACH! a complimentary bottle of very nice Sauvignon Blanc wine and a tray of petit fours winged its way to us, complimentary champagne cocktails in the bar, full Irish breakfasts.  Basically anything at all we wanted, we could have at no expense whatsoever. The management and Paul in particular could not have been more helpful or obliging if the President of the USA was staying there. Wow! Wow! Wow! Oh, the hotel itself is beautifully appointed, the amenities plentiful, the decor luxurious and the location fantastic. Even staying as a normal paying guest, I would not hesitate to recommend. Paul and your staff: thank you so much for making our stay unforgettable and amazing! I will definitely be back!!!",5,2013,05,12
203,Service and location combined tor a great stay,"The Granola in the breakfast room was the best ! And I loved having a Nespresso machine in the room. The staff were so helpful always. Even getting us coffee to go st 5:30 am. Great big fluffy bath towels and robes were appreciated

203,Great bar...great atmosphere,The Marble Bar in the Westbury hotel was where we ended up following a meal in nearby Stephen's Green. The bar is spacious and comfortable. The staff are friendly and not intrusive. Great choice of cocktails and spirits. A good mix of customers too from locals and shoppers to the hotel clients. This is a great hotel in the centre of Dublin that has all the attributes to keep customers coming back again and again...,4,2013,05,11
203,Lovely again.,"Second review and getting better. Fabulous location, very friendly staff, gorgeous rooms, beautifully appointed, and incredibly user friendly hotel. Highly recommended for the price in central Dublin.  Poor old Phil Lynott outside (bronze statue) was knocked over and damaged during my stay....boo hoo.  Hopefully the boys will come back to town and catch the cowboy(s) that did it.......",5,2013,05,11
203,Lovely impressive hotel,Lovely hotel staff are very professional. Rooms are  fab. Breakfast is lovely even removing the crusts from the toast. I think it's the little touches that count and the offer of a bottle of mineral water when checking out is one of those inexpensive little touches,5,2013,05,11
203,Dublin Luxury,"The Westbury in Dublin is smack in the centre of Dublin so you are well within walking distance or a short taxi ride to all the attractions

The Westbury itself was very luxurious with everything you could wish for and the staff are vey attentive

The food was wonderful especially the breakfast

We can't wait To go back

Wonderful",5,2013,05,11
203,"Fantastic hotel, staff and location","My wife and I stayed at the Westbury last weekend for her 40th birthday and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The location cannot be beaten, staff courteous and helpful, but more importantly, it is the attention to detail. Having been informed prior to our arrival, we found complimentary birthday card and cakes from the hotel waiting for us in our room.

The room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Everything provided was of a very high quality and we were not disappointed. The service was perfect without being 'in your face'.

The lobby's bar is fantastic for drinks and meeting people. Being off Grafton Street, it was great for our local friends to come and visit.

Whenever we are in Dublin again, we will certainly return to this lovely hotel. It was worth every Euro!",5,2013,05,10
203,Perfect Choice,"A wonderful hotel in every way.  The location is perfect and provides ready access to all the sites in Dublin.  The rooms were lovely and the staff couldn't have been more helpful.  

We did struggle getting to the hotel in our rental car, so make sure to inquire with the hotel about the correct GPS address (the hotel is listed on Grafton Street but cars are not allowed).

The Westbury will be our first choice whenever we return to Dublin!",5,2013,05,10
203,Lovely Hotel very close to Grafton St,"The Westbury is a lovely hotel, well appointed and managed in the heart of Dublin, around the corner from Grafton St and the fabulous 'Brown Thomas' store. The staff are pleasant and helpful. For Breakfast I would recommend Cafe Novo on the ground floor, slightly better value than 40 Euros for breafast in your room.",5,2013,05,09
203,"Great Experience, Great Location","The rooms may be tad small for someone from the US but they are nicely appointed and modern. The staff is very ready to help.
The location is right off Grafton Street so fantastic location for shopping, bars, restaurants.
Would definitely stay again.
Highly recommend: Pig's Ear for food, Ely's for wine, Fallon & Byrne for wine and quick casual lunch - go downstairs - wonderful ambiance, Queen of Tarts for a quaint middle of day dessert. Their chocolate is probably one of the best I have ever had (light and tasteful).",4,2013,05,08
203,A Must in Dublin!,"A pefect stay. Nothing undone; nothing overdone! You feel at home.
The rooms are comfortable and nicely arranged.
The dining room is bright and the food is superb.
The staff go out of their way to make your venture a pleasure.",5,2013,05,08
203,Friendly hotel close to the Temple bar,"I have experienced the most fatastic personal service in Asia and have thought that I will never experience the same in Europe! The staff at Westbury proved me wrong! The staff was very friendly and was eager to please us in a natural and plesant way. My wife came back after running in a nearby park and the doorman gave her a bottle of water on his own initative!
The Westbury is a 5 star hotel and the rooms are comfortable and nice. The location is pefect. Close to the Temple bar district and shopping in Crafton str. Dublin is full of nice pubs with live music and night clubs. This might cause some outdoor noise during the night but if you ask the booking to get you the best room to avoid that you will probably not be disturbed.
We really enjoyed our stay in Dublin and will return. We would love to stay at the Westbury the next time!",4,2013,05,07
203,The place to stay in Dublin.,"A wonderful hotel, as soon as you walk in there's a charming buzz to the hotel. The staff are very friendly, the rooms are very clean and are surprisingly spacious. The hotel is in an excellent area, right behind Grafton street - no need for taxis. 

The hotel adds the extra touches, warmed hand towels to clean your hands on arrival - those touches truly make it a 5* hotel. With the excellent staff, lovely 'buzzing' atmosphere in the hotel lobby and the prime location - it's the only hotel in Dublin I would stay in time after time.",5,2013,05,07
203,Great Stay at The Westbury,"The Westbury is located at the St Stephens Green end of Grafton Street. The Hotel is nestled away a mere 50 meters from the hustle and bustle of the main thoroughfare and as result is surprisingly peaceful. Directly outside the main door of the hotel is Bruxelles and McDaids pub. They are very different to each other but both are great spots. 
Due to the location of the hotel the parking is limited and done by valet. Parking rates were 20 Euro a day which considering it‚Äôs in the city centre is reasonable. Alternatively parking can be found in the St Stephens Green Shopping centre just around the corner.
On arrival I found staff to be warm and genuinely welcoming, for me the greeting on arrival sets the tone of your stay and as I had been so warmly received I felt I had nothing to worry about.
The reception is located on the first floor; the ground floor had an excellent bar/restaurant call Cafe Novo which I had lunch in. Again, the staff were very friendly & the food quality was also excellent and the atmosphere was unrushed which was a nice change of pace so I would certainly recommend.
The Gallery on level 1 is a sprawling area full of very relaxing seating, some with lovely window views of the bustling streets outside. Adorning the walls of this area is a fabulous collection of art which should not be ignored as it‚Äôs a fabulous collection. In the area you can order food and drinks. We had champagne afternoon tea and it was truly delicious. Our server was again friendly, courteous and mad us feel right at home. So it became aware to me that my previous encounters were not just fluke and that the standard of the staff was going to be very high. 
Our room was a superior room on level 2. I found this room to be of good size with a slightly smaller than expected bathroom. The room was well equipped with a safe, minibar, umbrella (needed in Dublin) and a coffee maker. The nespresso coffee is a nice touch. The bed was a queen size and very comfortable. I would say that the particular room I stayed in would be more suited to a 4 star than a 5 but it was spotlessly clean and comfortable. 
The breakfast was of an excellent standard. There was a large buffet area for your continental selection and a menu for you hot selections. As with the rest of the hotel the staff were excellent and food top quality.
Overall my stay in the Westbury was excellent; the staff without a doubt make the hotel so should be commended. The location is perfect for a trip to Dublin, the dining choices and quality were top notch. I have no problem recommending this hotel for anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2013,05,07
203,Pure luxury and money well spent,"Spent 1 night in the westbury as a treat with my husband and we can't wait to go back, arrived just after 2pm and were welcomed and checked in by Manny, after a brief run down of where everything was in the hotel and a surprise warmed hand towels to refresh our hands we headed to our room on the 4th floor. Room was gorgeous very large, 4 poster very comfortable chairs & foot rest in front of tv, everything you would expect to be in such a luxury hotel was there. Excellent location, a minute from grafton street & Stephens green, close to temple bar where we went for a meal and after a few drinks headed back to the hotel for a nightcap. This also surprised me and my husband as it was cheaper or the drins in the hotel than 2 of the bars we went to. Bed was so comfortable but we forced ourselves to get up early for breakfast, (newspaper we ordered at the door) and so glad we did, we were welcomed and seated, given menus to order hot food and also directed to the Buffett which was well stocked with a wide range of food, muffins fresh fruit cereals jams yogurts the list goes on. I ordered pancakes and my husband ad an omelette and both were delicious. After a walk in st Stephens green we went back to check out. Quick easy and again friendly staff off we went happy with complementary bottled water. My husband said it was the best hotel he as ever stayed in and I would tend to agree.  Go on treat yourself you won't be disappointed ",5,2013,05,06
203,Excellent location,"Stayed for two nights. Staff were excellent, beautiful hotel and in an excellent location. The bed however was not very comfortable, although I'm sure if we had have mentioned it to the front desk they would have accommodated us. We would definitely return again. ",4,2013,05,05
203,A fantastic stay at a great hotel in a great location,We stayed for a weekend at this hotel making use of the fantastic location. A definite 5 star experience with very friendly and helpful staff. We would definitely stay again. The breakfast buffet was very well laid out with a great selection. The bar was buzzing and a great place to have a drink before and after dinner. Another luxury is the afternoon tea which was delicious especially the turkey sandwiches.,5,2013,05,05
203,Less good than it was,"We loved this hotel the first time we stayed, but on this occasion the management seemed less good. The front desk people were very helpful and friendly throughout and they upgraded us because we were there for a celebrity opening - at least I think that was why.
The room was large, 2 very comfortable double beds and reasonably quiet.But the mini bar was never restocked, the first morning they missed my door card to ask for breakfast in the room and the housekeepers were friendly but not very efficient. We were on the 3rd floor and the lift was beyond a joke. It never took less than 5 minutes to arrive and sometimes longer.
The open tea/coffee lounge is always agreable, but I had to chase 3 different waiters to take my order although the food was good when it did arrive. However, a friend had arranged a large dinner in the main dining room before the theatre. We sat down at 6 and by 7 we had still not received the starter, however many times our host asked. We had to cancel the puddings. The waiters never apologised but they did constantly interrupt and ask if everything was ok when it obviously not. Very poor service indeed and the food we did get was only adequate.",4,2013,05,03
203,"Great location, Good accomodations","Can't get much closer to Grafton Street which has good shopping and various pubs. Out the front entrance is Grafton St and out the back entrance is a multitude of nice bars and restaurants.

Arrived at the hotels at 9am after a flight from the US, unfortunately it was a Sat and the Westbury was all booked so we had to wait until 12:30pm for our room...that was the only negative but it certainly was not the hotels fault.

I was in a suite which was very large, nice king bed, good amenities. Was asked each day if I wanted a complimentary bottle of water, always had a candy dish filled with chocolate and room service was quick and easy.

Easy walking to Trinity College, Dublin Castle, St Stephens Green and Temple Bar area.

I would recommend this hotel both both business as well as vacation.",4,2013,05,03
203,Best location in Dublin!!,"Great hotel!! A friend recommended the Westbury and it was worth every ‚Ç¨!! The rooms were great, the staff outdid themselves and the location is second to none!! If I go back, I'd only stay here!! You can walk everywhere and catch public trans nearby as well! Close to shopping and the must do Temple Bar area!
",5,2013,05,02
203,2 excellent stays,"This review is a long time coming; We have stayed at The Westbury twice in the past few years and both stays were really excellent. Both times we arrived on the red-eye from JFK and the first time, they checked us in at 7:30am; the second time the room wasn't quite ready but they served us complimentary tea while we waited, and it wasn't a long wait at all. 

Had breakfast in Wilde's and dinner in one of the other restaurants and both times they were excellent. I also tried the afternoon tea which was good as any that I have tried in other 5 stars around the world. 

I had a couple of requests when I was there and the hotel manager was very quick to personally call and ensure satisfaction. The hotel is staffed by a mix of Irish and foreign staff - everyone I encountered was very friendly and helpful and clearly took pride in their jobs. 

Location great also, right by Grafton St and lots of dining and shopping options nearby. 

Really can't think of staying anywhere else when I am inevitably in Dublin again. It can be pricey sometimes but I feel comfortable that the price is justified by the very high standards of The Westbury.",5,2013,04,28
203,Two days of luxury,"From check in to check out, this hotel epitomised Irish hospitality and friendliness.
Great location, beautiful public areas and very comfortable room.
Would definitely stay here again should I be lucky enough to visiting Dublin.",5,2013,04,27
203,Terrific Business Hotel,"This was our 3rd business meeting at the Westbury, spaced over a 6 year period, and it just couldn't get better. In fact, we'll book our 2015 meeting there as well. We spend a week at a time so have plenty of opportunity to sample all that they have to offer. The sales staff has stayed consistent throughout, a real novelty, in my experience.  

The meeting space is first rate and the daily meeting staff well equipped to handle any issues - Chris is fully capable of handling any immediate needs quickly and efficiently.  Hotel meeting food is not always known for its memorability but the inventive preparations were nothing short of excellent.  Every bit as 4 star as any restaurant you care to mention - and I've been to more than a few.  Daniel in their restaurant, Wilde, made us feel equally welcome at lunch and at a private dinner. There is a new chef who certainly brings a freshness to the menu which, whether at lunch or dinner, was a solid hit with our attendees who are never shy about expressing their level of satisfaction.

Guestrooms are very comfortable and well appointed.  Windows can be opened, but night life can cause some noise which is expected when you are in the center of Dublin.  There is an adequate gym and both restaurants are very good.  Service can be a bit slower than we are accustomed to so if you're in a hurry be sure to tell them.  The food is well worth the wait and the service friendly.",5,2013,04,27
203,great room and location,"hotel is situated within close proximity to everything - St Andrews church where all the bus tours depart from, Temple Bar area,  Trinity college, St Patrick's cathedral, and Christchurch cathedral.  I walked up to the Jameson distillery as well, and that was about a 25 min walk.  The hotel room was nicely decorated and the staff was very friendly.",5,2013,04,26
203,Another great stay at the Westbury,"Just returned from another wonderful stay at the Westbury in Dublin.  This is one of the coziest properties given it's relatively large size.  The entire staff is friendly, accomodating, and relentlessly cheerful.  The rooms are clean, comfortable, and every time I""ve arrived early morning after an overnight flight from the states - ready!  I'm struck by despite being always busy and buzzing with guests, the service is so flawless and you feel very well taken care of.  Colleagues stay at both The Merrion ( too creaky/stuffy for me) and The Fitzwilliam (all the charm of a Hilton Garden Inn), but I return again and again to the Westbury.  You could not ask for a more central location, but what keeps me coming back in the warmth of the property and the staff.",5,2013,04,25
203,Why even consider staying anywhere else in Dublin,"I'm a frequent traveller to Dublin and a dedicated customer of the Westbury.  While the property itself is beautifully decorated and located in the heart of Dublin off Grafton Street, the Westbury's staff is what sets the hotel above the rest.  Their gracious professionalism in unrivaled and have made me a customer for life.",5,2013,04,23
203,Beautiful Hotel but staff could do with customer service training,"I've stayed here many times over the years.  On my most recent visit it was for a conference, I found the main area where I was having coffee in lovely by all accounts but the service terrible.  The prices are high and the service should warrant the price being charged.  It used to be my definite stop for coffee etc when on Grafton Street but now I go to a different location because of this.  Seems a shame loyal customers for years now going elsewhere.",3,2013,04,23
203,Great location and service,"The Westbury is located right off Grafton Street, which is a great location.

Excellent service and spotless rooms that are nicely decorated.  Cafe Novo downstairs is nice for breakfast or dinner.  Stayed for 5 nights for work, and very safe for women traveling alone.  Room service is very quick with lots of choices.",4,2013,04,22
203,Just right...Right in the heart of Dublin!,"The Westbury is the best hotel in Dublin, hands down.  I've been traveling to the city by the Liffey for over 50 years for business and pleasure, and for any purpose -- romantic weekend, business meeting, late-night bar stop, what-have-you -- The Westbury is the quiet, confident champion.
Best staff, best location, most comfortable lobby, best hotel bar, best hotel restaurant (Wilde), solid room service -- I could go on and on.  Love this place!",4,2013,04,22
203,Great city center hotel,"We spent a long weekend here in April 2013 and strongly recommend it.  Great location just off Grafton Street, nice rooms, pleasant open 'gallery' area off the lobby where coffee, afternoon tea and drinks are served, excellent breakfast and good service.  All the staff were very helpful, especially Joseph at the concierge desk who is terrific - he makes very good restaurant, museum, etc. recommendations with charm and wit.
Not cheap, but worth it.",5,2013,04,19
203,Wonderful Hotel,"Perfect Hotel.Middle of Town,no need for car.Wonderful staff.Spotlessly clean.Very good price for such a top notch hotel.Will definitely be back.We have stayed in worse hotels at twice the price.The westbury was,for me,faultless.",5,2013,04,19
203,Beautiful,"This beautiful hotel is in a great location - although it is pretty much impossible to drive there yourself, very confusing (it is not actually on Grafton St).  The room was beautifully appointed.  Two small complaints - it was much too hot and we could nto control the heat and the bed was quite soft (not good for poor backs).  The staff, however, was outstanding.  Super helpful, polite, and accommodating.",4,2013,04,18
203,A beautiful experience,"I had to go to Dublin from my hometown (Rome, in Italy) for no leisure reasons, so I wished to stay in a very cozy hotel. My expectations were almost surpassed by the Westbury Dublin: the staff was professional but also friendly, and I found complimentary items in my room (wifi, nespresso, mineral water free of charge) which I appreciated in a particular way. Most of all, I'm going to keep beautiful memories of my light dinners in the lounge, by the fireplace!",5,2013,04,18
203,Very comfortable stay,"We booked two interconnecting rooms for us and our two kids through American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts, which offers an upgrade if available, complimentary breakfast and an afternoon tea. The rate was 144 Euro per room. Getting to the hotel by car is slightly tricky. We went past Trinity onto Dame St, then took South Great Gorges St, then first left onto narrow Exchequer St, and that curves round onto Clarendon St which is at the back of the hotel. Round two sides of the square and you are at the front door where helpful valet staff are waiting to take your luggage and park the car. Valet parking is 20 Euro a day. The hotel is fantastically convenient for Grafton Street and a 3 minute walk to Stephens Green or Trinity. 

We did not get an upgrade, but check in was quick and easy and we were shown to two nice rooms. Ours was a queen, and the kids had a twin. Both rooms were not huge, but were comfortable with understated classy colouring, a nice flat panel TV, small but pleasant bathroom with nice toiletries, a Nespresso coffee machine, mini-bar and small seating area. The beds were comfortable, if a bit on the soft side. 

Breakfast was served in the Wilde restaurant and consisted of a good buffet of continental items and a menu of other items for ordering. Afternoon tea was served in the Gallery restaurant, essentially a lobby lounge. That was lovely, with a selection of sandwiches followed by pastries and cakes with tea, coffee and hot chocolate. 

Overall, this was a very pleasant stay. Our kids didn't want to leave. It was pretty good value and the quality and service were appropriate to the star rating. I would be happy to stay there again.",4,2013,04,18
203,Nice staycation,"A fine hotel with a fantastic location located right on Grafton street. I stayed here for 2 nights before our trip to Asia, whilst staying there it was my partners birthday. The hotel left him a card and some chocolates but had a different name on the card, still a nice touch. The room was fine, with a nespresso machine and a good entertainment system with great views of the neighboring roofs. The hotel facilitys are so so, there is no pool and the gym is quite average. the marble room is great for a nightcap or a bottle of champers(whilst on holiday).. all in all a very good property however should the need arise again I will be staying in the Shelbourne (more character filled, nice pool and  great buzz)..",4,2013,04,17
203,Lovely hotel - minor issues,"We booked the Romantic Celebration package that included champagne and chocolates in the room, as we were visiting as part of our honeymoon, but these were not present in the room when we arrived. We called reception and waited for almost an hour for these to arrive. They came with a congrats card from the hotel but frankly I would have preferred the special touches we had ordered sooner, rather than a receptionist taking longer to write a card. As it was, we were only in Dublin for the night, and spent an hour of this time kicking about the room instead of starting our romantic evening. 
A few other small niggles, such as we ordered a newspaper on the form which never arrived. And with breakfast the toast took 20mins to arrive and we asked twice, while the other halves' eggs went cold. In addition, I ordered scrambled eggs but received fried or poached instead. 
It is a beautiful hotel, and the staff are lovely, but it wasn't quite what I had hoped for. I doubt we would return as the experience seems rather overpriced now in hindsight.",3,2013,04,16
203,Very nice,"Everything about The Westbury Hotel is nice. As soon as I stepped out of a taxi I knew I was in for a good stay.

The staff were very nice, polite and helpful. A refreshing warm towel at check in was a nice touch. The room was spacious and clean, with nice furniture. The carpet was soft. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was good size, clean and warm.

Breakfast was delicious, tastefully arranged and also cooked to order. 

A very enjoyable stay, would highly recommend it.",5,2013,04,16
203,Tour operator's report on the Westbury Hotel Dublin,"We stayed at the Westbury in Dublin twice in the last fortnight. It is extremely central and convenient as most will know however the quality of the hotel in every way was EXCELLENT! I am a tour operator ( I stay in hotels a lot!) and have sent clients but I wanted to see for myself and meet staff etc. We ate in the brasserie restaurant which was very good with excellent wines, we had a wonderful afternoon tea one day and apparently you need to book weeks in advance as we were told by locals. Our room was most comfortable and had everything we needed - sink into the carpets, very comfortable beds - too difficult to leave! Free wifi etc and the glasses in the drinks cabinet are Waterford crystal! Staff at all times were excellent and very efficient and helpful - say no more! Now you know why we returned - we were spoiled rotten by Beccy and her staff! Roll on the next visit!",5,2013,04,15
203,An absolute Gem..,"We arrived initially quite early for check in, and whilst there are no guarantees, the staff at reception were outstanding and were able to accommodate us. We had only expected to drop off bags and return.. This was a great help and front of house were all really lovely. The rooms are clean, classic and functionally spacious. All public areas of the hotel were also clean and professionally run. The decor throughout is beautifully classic. The staff all met guests with a beaming and seemingly genuine smile which is rare in many hotels these days. The whole team appeared happy. The location is outstanding - right in the heart of this most wonderful city. Quite simply, we loved it. Like the review below says - don't stay anywhere else in Dublin. Book it - you won't be disappointed.",5,2013,04,14
203,Fantastic Customer Service!,"Stayed with my wife and two year old
daughter over Easter weekend.  After a
minor heating issue we were upgraded from
a very nice Studio Suite to a fabulous
Luxury Suite.  We even received a handwritten apology from Joseph the
Guest Relations Manager.  On Easter
Sunday afternoon we had the pleasure of
having the fantastic Cocoa Atelier Tea.
The location of the hotel could not have
been better. Each employee we encountered said a friendly hello
with a smile.  This is how a hotel should
be run.  Please do not stay anywhere else
when visiting Dublin town!
",5,2013,04,11
203,The Hotel to stay at when in Dublin,"The 5 star hotel to stay at in Dublin, awesome location, walking distance from most the attractions in Dublin. Very convenient location, with a s good surrounding neighborhood. The Quality of hotel service is out of this world. The staff is extremely friendly. Loved the comfort of the room, they are big, and the bed is awesome.  I will stay here again when I return to dublin.",5,2013,04,11
203,"Warm, courteous and delightful.","My husband and I stayed last weekend and were greatly impressed by the attentativeness and caring attitude of the hotel. Everyone from the Porters to the Reception staff were wonderful! The hotel position could not have been better, and Cafe Novo provided an excellent breakfast at reasonable rates. We will be back as soon as we possibly can!",5,2013,04,11
203,Westbury Exceeds Expectations,"The Westbury is a dream come true.  I did not think my stay last year could be topped, but on my return this week, I was incredibly delighted to find the service even more welcoming, the staff even more professional and the surroundings even more luxurious. Manager Becca Gunn and reservationist Andrea Gray went out of their way to welcome me and ensure that my stay was delightful and my visit to Dublin a smashing success. The concierge staff could not be more well informed or helpful.  My room was gorgeous, and my stay was just extraordinary. When I am next in Dublin, I will not stay anywhere else.  Thank you for a delightful experience!",5,2013,04,11
203,As good as it gets.,"Just had a wonderful stay at the Westbury the  staff were always extremely helpful and courteous. It was my wifes birthday and the hotel upgraded us and gave her a surprise card and chocolates . It was are first time staying there but we would hope to return to enjoy the great hospitality and wonderful location. If there is a negative i would have to mention the shower which was fitted over the bath and was very cramped in a 5 star hotel i would have expected a walk in shower and a bath . We ate in cafe novo restaurant and had an absolutely stunning meal, steaks to die for, we didn't eat in wilde restaurant as didn't believe food could be any better than cafe novo. ",5,2013,04,10
203,Approval,"14 Friends stayed for two nights, very good central hotel, Clean, Helpful & Friendly Staff, Efficient check in and check out. Would have liked more instructions on how to operate appliances in the rooms, ie coffee machine, Televison, and Shower, even the lights around the bed needed a bit of sussing out, just about managed it all by day two.",5,2013,04,10
203,Enjoyable,"Once again we have had an enjoyable visit to the Westbury. The breakfasts are absolutely excellent, the staff are very good and we always enjoy the buzz in the hotel. However there are aspects which are grossly overpriced in comparison to many 5 star hotels in Ireland, for example, the bed and breakfast rate and the price of the afternoon tea. In addition the snack food which we ordered in the evening was poor.",4,2013,04,09
203,Westbury saved us!,"We were forced to leave another hotel in Dublin due to noise; we were able to book a last-minute room at the Westbury (at midnight!).  We were delighted with the Westbury -- it was peaceful and well-run.  We stayed 5 nights, and slept well each night.  The staff were helpful and pleasant. The rooms were beautifully decorated and appointed.  The location could not be better for exploring Dublin.   We would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2013,04,08
203,Splendid service. Excellent location.,Stayed for Sat night with some friends who treated me for my birthday. The hotel upgraded my room and dropped in a card and a treat for my birthday. All staff were very friendly and attentive and the rooms really clean and the location just off Grafton Street brilliant. If you stay here once you will find it difficult if travelling to Dublin again to stay anywhere else. ,5,2013,04,08
203,Lovely Stay,"We had a great stay at The Westbury in Dublin.  Arrived early and they were able to check us in and let us get a nap before exploring Dublin.  Staff was welcoming and helpful, rooms were nicely appointed and we really enjoyed our stay.  I would definitely recommend.  The location was excellent.",4,2013,04,08
203,Afternoon Tea at the Westbury a must for all coeliacs!,"I had afternoon tea at the Westbury just before Easter.  It was a wonderful experience from start to finish.  Our server Kim took excellent care of us and was a credit to the hotel.  In fact all of the staff who we met gave us a great welcome and were extremely attentive to our needs.  As a coeliac I would consider afternoon tea at the Westbury an absolute must.  Nothing was a problem for the staff and when the food arrived we were delighted with what was presented to us.  Myself and my mother are both coeliacs and have lots of experience dining out.  But on this occasion, I think it is fair to say our expectations were exceeded.  We were greeted with delicious sandwiches, the most amazing gluten free scones I have ever tasted and the top layer of wonderful cakes and sweets - amazing!  I can not recommend afternoon tea at the Westbury highly enough!",5,2013,04,08
203,Super hotel in an unbeatable location!,Had the enormous pleasure of spending a girl's night in the Westbury  two weeks ago.  As we only meet once a year we wanted to stay in the same room and so opted for the family room .  We' ve been to a lot of places on our girl's nights over the past few years including another five star hotel very close by but this truly topped them all!  From check in to check out it was hard to find any fault. Room was absolutely perfect..... the Nespresso coffee machine being a particularly nice touch! Service was spot on...  really attentive without being intrusive and breakfast was a great array of just about anything you fancied.  After check out there was no bother with leaving bags with the concierge for a while longer while we shopped. We were even cheeky enough to run back in and leave a few newly acquired bags later in the day.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and the wonderful location really tops it altogether! We will definitely be back!,5,2013,04,07
203,"Lovely hotel, excellent service","We really enjoyed spending last weekend at the Westbury.  The staff made all the difference.  Manny at reception was very welcoming.  It was our wedding anniversary and beautiful pastries were delivered to the room and we got rose petals when the bed was turned down.  The hotel itself feels very luxurious without being pretentious.  The location is perfect.  The standard rooms aren't huge, but they are nicely furnished and the coffee maker is great.",5,2013,04,05
203,The most relaxing hotel in central  Dublin,"Just spent another few exciting days in Dublin and the place we stay at everytime is The Westbury.  It is the most central to what we want to do and we feel we are in the right in the heart of things for shopping, art centres, museums and parks such as St Steven's Green and of course Grafton Street.  One of the main activities for us is enjoying our food and there are numerous places to dine in relaxed and interesting surroundings.

The Westbury is a most enjoyable place to stay in, right from leaving your car in the professional hands of the doorman, to picking it up at the end of your stay.  One of the main attrractions to me is the Lounge area where I always seem to gravitate for lunch of smoked salmon, a glass of wine and The Times newspaper.  There is ample choice for dining at either of the two restaurants. The rooms are just about perfect, as you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The coffee machine makes great coffee, the cleanliness is excellent all around and the beds provide a great night sleep.

We always look forward to our trips to Dublin and The Westbury, with their very professional and customer focused staff at all levels.",5,2013,04,04
203,"Great quality, value and location in Dublin","This was my first trip to Dublin and I would highly recommend the Westbury to anyone for business or pleasure.  This is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin, near plenty of shopping, great pubs, and restaurants.  The hotel is impeccable, the staff is very courteous (especially the bell staff), and my room (#402, at one end of the hotel) was very comfortable, clean, and quiet.  Though the rooms are a bit small by US standards, they're fine for up to 2 people.  I have to say that the coffee machines they provide in each room make the best coffee!!  And they're easy to use (once you read the instructions!).  Some of my business associates complained that the gym didn't open early (not until 8 AM I think) and I found out that's because the gym is adjacent to some guest rooms.  I highly recommend breakfast at the hotel's restaurant, it's a wonderful buffett and a very nice setting.  Enjoy!",5,2013,04,03
203,Classy hotel - although a few issues,"The Westbury is definitely a classy hotel!  Positives:
 - Great staff
 - Right in the centre of things
 - Reasonably priced

However a few negatives:
 - Weird bathroom layout in the Superior Rooms.  Water from the shower spills over the glass divide on to the toilet seat and surrounding foor.
 - Heated towel rack in an area where you can't fit their huge bath sheets!  So you can only really heat your face towel
 - No pillow menu (i'm picking now).",4,2013,04,03
203,worth going to Dublin just to stay in this hotel,"From the moment we arrived the quality of this hotel was apparent. We booked in 3 hours early and headed straight to our room. The very helpful and friendly concierge showed us where everything was and even offered to explain how to work the Nespresso machine. The room was very tastefully decorated, it had an extremely comfortable bed and lovely aromatherapy toiletries. The surprise chocolates provided at the the evening bed turn down were a real treat especially the box containing an Easter egg on Sunday.",5,2013,04,02
203,"Slow start, great recovery....","Well it's always tricky flying in from the states to get a room early. Had to wait about an hour for a room to clear but they were very nice about it and offered drinks etc; First room I went into was twin beds and I'm 6'4"". Was quickly moved to another very nice room with a full bed. From there on out it was (mostly smooth sailing) aside from my friends being asked if they were 'residents', (they were, they work in rock radio) constantly everyone was pleasant and the service was spectacular. Missed breakfast time and they still accommodated me. But where they really came through was when I got to the airport without my passport. The Concierge retrieved it, put it in a cab and had it delivered to me (with some things I tried to leave behind) with plenty of time for my flight. Also this hotel is very warm and cozy as compared to the Fitzwillam, which I like a lot. It is also right in the heart of Grafton street, head out for the day and the doormen welcome you back with a smile. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2013,04,01
203,Unlike anything I have seen!,"I have travelled to many great hotels around the world including Dubai, Paris, New York and Tokyo. It was remarkable the level of personal implication to ensure that my stay with my family at the Westbury Hotel was good. Joseph proved to be the most helpful manager I have ever had to deal with in a Hotel. He is also very fluent in Spanish something my mother found very helpful!",5,2013,04,01
203,5 Star in every way,Well this is the only hotel for me in Dublin. Just had a weekend getaway with my wife and from the moment we arrived to the moment we left it was 5 Star treatment. We did have an issue with the heating on the second night but when we called reception about this they checked it out and upgraded us. Also we were given complimentary chocolates for the inconvenience. The location is perfect for exploring Dublin with all the shops restaurants and bars within a stone throw away. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family and I will be returning myself as soon as I can.,5,2013,03,29
203,Great hotel in a great location. Just beware of rooms above the door on a weekend.,"I stayed at the westbury with several friends and was thrilled with the service, room size, location, friendliness of the staff and ease of parking. My only concern was that my room was quite noisy on the Saturday night due to the pub across the road. I would recommend asking for a room that isn't at the front of the hotel. Otherwise, good hotel in a good location, if a bit expensive.",4,2013,03,28
203,Faultless Performance,"I booked here on a last minute city break for a little pampering and the Westbury didn't let me down.  Its a little tricky to arrive by car but from there on the service was top drawer. 

The lobby layout is a little odd but it allows for a really nice lounge area.  The overall d√©cor is a little bit like how an American hotel would imagine a European hotel would look like.  That's not a criticism, just the feeling I got.
The room was oven hot but the heating controls were easy to adjust. No real view to speak of (Second floor) but that's often par for the course in the city centre.

The staff were outstanding at every turn without being over bearing.  Always helpful and accommodating to our many requests.  It's a bit more expansive than some other options but I will be back again because if you want to spoil yourself on a city break than a top class hotel in the middle of the city is the only way to go.",5,2013,03,27
203,dublin's best location,"It is rare I would have a review of a hotel and be unable to list any faults, but I think this is one - the Westbury is excellent on all grounds - the location cannot be beaten, the staff are excellent ( from the Cafe Novo on the ground floor, the bars, front desk, and the restaurant for breakfast - all excellent.
nice little touches like free papers delivered to room without asking, turn down service, all channels on TV, and crucially - good acoustics and little corridor noise.
I cannot fault them. BRILLIANT.",5,2013,03,26
203,Fantastic,"I joined my husband on his business trip to Dublin. We were lucky to stay at The Westbury. The hotel was beautiful and in a great, central, location. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were adequate size and the bathroom was nicely finished. There were two negatives on our trip. The beds weren't  very comfortable. They pushed two beds together in order to make a king and the mattress pad was foam which we didn't care  for. The other negative was that our wakeup  call  on checkout day wasn't made.  Luckily, we woke up on  our own about  20 minutes before our car to the airport arrived. As we were leaving  the hotel we discovered that the hotel staff forgot to make several calls that morning.  An unfortunate ending to an  otherwise great trip. 

Cafe  Novo was a great place for drinks.",5,2013,03,24
203,Fantastic hotel in the heart of Dublin city.,"Stayed one night at the Westbury for our wedding anniversary will definitely be returning. The staff were exceptional such a warm welcome . The hotel has the welcome and feel of a small hotel with the splendor of a 5 star luxury hotel. Plenty of staff on hand to deal with any requests. Staff are trained to a very high standard with a touch of Irish charm.
The room was spacious luxurious and immaculately maintained. The restaurant and bar were buzzing with people and seemed to be very popular with locals creating a great atmosphere . Although the hotel lobby was busy seats were reserved in the lounge for hotel guests which allowed us to sit over a drink watching the world go by over Grafton Street  a perfect end to a wonderful stay in the heart of Dublin City. 

A big thank you to all the staff who made our stay so memorable .",5,2013,03,24
203,Excellent stay!!,"Staff was wonderful. Rooms were large and very nice. Great hotel location and the breakfast was excellent. All for a very reasonable rate. When we return to Dublin we will certainly be staying there again. There was wifi in our room that was fast, and there was even an American outlet if you did not have adapters. Turn-down service was also very nice and unexpected. 5 star hotel in my book.",5,2013,03,19
203,We will never go anywhere else in Dublin,"We will leave the Westbury hotel tomorrow and we will be sad. Everything about this hotel was just perfect.
We book few month ago by Internet and Andrea Gray at the reception was friendly and helpfull taking the time to explain me the different prices, the difference between rooms etc....
Then when we arrive we was welcome by Joseph Downing, the relation manager and we felt immediately as a part of this hotel.
As we come for my husband birthday, we had the fabulous surprise to be upgrated and we found a cake and a handmade birthday card in our room. 
So many little attention that make us feel sp√©cial and that make us fall in love with this hotel!
The room ( a suite) was huge and very well furnished and so for the bathroom with even a TV in it. The room gives on the main street we two pubs in it and even if we can hear the noise ( it was st Patrick) it didn't be a problem. We enjoy to relax in this room.
We took breakfast in room each morning and it was really good and they served it very on time.
We were afraid as it was St Patrick week-end to find to many people but it was never full at the bar or at the elevators.
All employees were kind.
The hotel is very well situated in one of the most important shopping street : grafton street. We were to Henry street for shopping too and it was 5-10 minutes walk.
We will come back again for sure. It s our ""peace land"" in the heart of the city.",5,2013,03,17
203,Well worth it!,"Great location, outstanding service, lovely atmosphere, tremendous attention to detail, fabulous food, memorable stay. Afternoon tea was fantastic! Certainly not cheap but well worthwhile for a treat! Can't recommend it highly enough.",5,2013,03,17
203,Our stay in The Westbury,"My husband and I went to the Westbury Hotel for our 30th Wedding Annivesary last week and i have to say it was a fabulous experience... The staff were so helpful and kind, we got a great welcome and a free upgrade.. We will defnately be back...

203,just as nice as i remembered,"returned to dublin for my annual busines trip..i've stayed in 5 hotels in Dublin over the years and this is still my favorite they do most things right,,freindly doorman, friendly concierge, nice appointed rooms, nice amenities, very good breakfast buffet,,,two negatives, small fitness center [really a  converted hotel room i think] and expensive restaurant",5,2013,03,15
203,Perfect!!,"Stayed here one night and were genuinely sad to leave. This hotel is just fantastic and apart from the perfect location, the staff are among the best I've ever come across. They seem genuinely cheerful and more than happy to go the extra mile. Big luxurious rooms with wonderful beds! A really perfect hotel experience. Thank you Westbury! ",5,2013,03,13
203,Fabulous!!,This hotel remains at the top of its game. From arrival to departure faultless. Charming staff. Lovely rooms. Lushious afternoon tea. Lovely bteakfast. Treat yourself. You wont be disappointed! The guy in the gallery even remembered our drink order from night before!!,5,2013,03,13
203,Afternoon Tea,"The afternoon tea was sublime. I had the champagne package and it was great value for money. The selection of cakes was delicious and there were plenty of them.

The only critique is that the service was disorganised but the individual members of staff were great.",4,2013,03,12
203,Amazing Birthday!,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here for his birthday in October, a surprise present from his mother. The receptionist was very friendly and helpful. Offered to have our bags carried to our room, asked us if we would like today's paper, gave us warm scented clothes to refresh ourselves. 

When we entered our room it looked amazing! They had left the most delicious cupcake with happy birthday Anthony written on the plat in chocolate and a happy birthday card from the staff. An actual bought one with someone's hand written birthday wishes. 

The room was also fantastic. The bed was soft and the room not too warm. They had a Nespresso coffee machine in the room which I just died over! Also a great selection of teas in a beautiful wooden box.

White his and her robes, slippers, and lovely scented bathroom items. 
A phone in the room AND the bathroom!

We only stayed the one night. When we were leaving again we were asked if we needed help with our bags and if we would like a taxi called for us. 

Just lovely!",5,2013,03,11
203,The Worst Hotel in Dublin,"There is nothing more insulting and upsetting than a hotel trying to pass itself off as a 5 star offering and not being able to deliver. Terrible rooms, terrible bathrooms, the TV didn't work, and wildly overpriced. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!  The Doyle Collection is really a 2 to 3 star offering - they spend very little money up keeping their properties and have no business being considered A Leading Hotel of the World - in fact The Westbury is so bad that I will never refer to LHW again.  Wake up!!",1,2013,03,10
203,Overrated,"I booked two twin rooms in The Westbury, Dublin for a girls day out last weekend. 

As a whole the hotel is lovely, well located, visually beautiful however there were some easily avoidable issues that would have made our stay feel 5* as opposed to 4*:
1. Despite email and verbal requests that we were going to be arriving at around lunch time, only one room was ready
2. Despite email, verbal request and confirmation of two twin rooms, we were given one double and one twin room
3. There was no iPod dock - surely a given in a 5* hotel in this day and age
4. Room service was ordered Saturday night and it took 40 minutes to organise a ham and cheese sandwich and a cheese sandwich.
5. Tea was ordered with the room service - no fresh milk was provided
6. In the residents bar Saturday night I was treated like an imposter by the bar man. He also got me to sign a receipt for a glass of tap water.... 
7. We had two cars travelling into the city as we were coming from different parts of the country - our parking cost us ‚Ç¨40 in the car park of the hotel - even though we were residents 
8. We got 2, 250ml bottles of complementary bottles or water in our room 

On a positive note however, the majority of the staff were pleasant, there was no parking when we arrived so we left both sets of keys with the valet who moved the cars for us and the location is great. 

All things considered, I won't be staying in The Westbury again, ill be trying The Conrad / Fitzwilliam hotels next! ",3,2013,03,09
203,Enjoyable stay at the Westbury,"Beautiful hotel, nice breakfast, can't beat the location.  The only negative is this appears to be a popular hotel with big groups.....several we're there during my stay so It was very crowded and noisy in the common area's.  Also had to wait to get in the breakfast room because big groups had filled the room",4,2013,03,09
203,Great Hotel - great location,We took a quick weekend trip to Dublin to see the city for the first time.  We chose the Westbury hotel and it ended up being very comfortable and the location was really nice for getting around the city.  I would definitely stay there again if I were to return to Dublin.  I'd also check out other hotels in the group (in different locations) based on the quality of this one.,5,2013,03,08
203,A wonderful experience,"We stayed here for a night at the end of February. Even though we booked their basic room, we got a triple upgrade, which resulted in a wonderful suite 527. Absolutely loved it.

The service was absolutely top notch, very courteous staff who are there for you all the time.

The breakfast was very good, but the full Irish breakfast plate was a bit limited, but the ingredients are perfect. 

The only thing to mention: in the room, there were two sinks in the bathroom, and stoppers in both of them did not work. So we had to pull out the actual plugs to use these sinks.

Nevertheless, we would definely go back soon!",5,2013,03,07
203,Traditional Afternoon Tea @ The Westbury Hotel,"March 2013

Our destination was the Westbury, a member of LHW. We had decided the previous evening to go to the Gallery. The Easter Cocoa Atelier Afternoon Tea seemed especially tempting, based on the description on the website.

The Gallery is located on the first floor and guests can either go up the beautiful staircase or use the elevator.

The staircase is split into two. When turning to the left you arrive immediately at the Gallery, if turning right you encounter the reception, concierge and elevators to the guest rooms.

There was a host already waiting to seat people. Unfortunately we didn't have a reservation, and the lounge was really buzzing, so our hostess asked us to take a seat at the bench and she would try and arrange something for us or we could head for the Marble Bar. Since we wanted Afternoon Tea we decided to wait. It didn't take more than a few minutes and we were seated near the piano and a group of ladies having a baby shower.

Soon a waitress handed us a menu. To our surprise there was no sign of the Easter Cocoa Atelier Afternoon Tea. On the website it didn't state from which date it was available. When we asked the waitress she had never heard of it before. She promised to investigate. After a longer wait our waitress returned with a print out, saying unfortunately the tea wasn't available yet. It is served between 27.03.13 and 07.04.13. It didn't matter to us, so we ordered the Traditional Afternoon Tea for 30 Euro each (ca. 40 USD). If you prefer to have it with Champagne it costs 36 Euro per person (ca. 47 USD). The Easter Afternoon Tea would have the same price. Additionally we ordered freshly squeezed orange juice for 4.50 Euro each (ca. 6 USD).

While we were waiting for our service we took in the scene. The hotel had originally only classic features, but thanks to a renovation a few years back it has completely changed and has a more contemporary flair. In the lounge are abstract paintings, a modern fireplace, sumptuous sofas and chairs. The colors are mostly grey, blue and red. There was a good atmosphere and the age group was mixed from young to old.

Back to our tea. To give it an elegant atmosphere our table was covered with a white linen table cloth. We ordered both the Granny's Garden Tea. There were at least nine different sorts of tea available. Ours was a fruit tea with rhubarb, vanilla and other exotic flavors. It harmonized with the food. The tea was a bit unusual served, because the sandwiches came on a separate plate than the sweet items.

We were asked if we wanted the cakes and scones at the same time or after we had finished the savories. We said we would wait for our sweets. There were egg, turkey and cranberry, ham and crab sandwiches. We both had as a favorite the turkey and cranberry sandwiches, one of us loved the egg sandwiches, while I had as second favorite the crab.

After a short wait we received the tower. On the lower part was the clotted cream, a pot of butter and jams. The middle one contained four scones (two plain, two fruit, and they could be ordered again without any extra charge) and the top contained the cakes, which was the highlight for us. There were pistachio cakes with a raspberry, cocoa and pistachio macaroons, meringue and chocolate brownies. All was fresh, full flavored and from the finest ingredients.

When we wanted to pay it was difficult to get the attention of one of the waitresses. In the end our hostess took care of it.

We spent around two hours at the Gallery and felt relaxed and rested afterwards. We also reserved a table during the week the Easter Cocoa Atelier Tea is available, so that we can try that one too.

Would we do the Traditional Afternoon Tea @ The Westbury Hotel again? YES!
Would we recommend this experience to a friend? YES!",5,2013,03,07
203,Amazing Birthday treat.,I was surprised with a birthday treat to stay overnight in the Westbury. I have been to the hotel many times to celebrate special occasions however this was my first time to stay over. It was fabulous. The location is second to none. I was welcomed to the hotel and even though I was early I was lucky that my room was ready. The receptionist was very pleasant and welcoming. The bedroom was spacious and luxurious. Later that afternoon I was surprised by a knock on the door to a little birthday treat. Also a card from reception and the general manager. Thank you so much. It was a birthday to remember and I will definitely be back. Definitely worth it. The little touches make all the difference. 5 stars from me!,5,2013,03,05
203,City centre locale,"Fantastic location. Great afternoon tea served.  Friendly staff. First rate.  Attentive service. Rooms a bit small. Modern hotel.   Great stay. Would recommend for all.
Rooms are modern and comfortable.
One block from Grafton st for shopping and st Stephens green.",5,2013,03,04
203,"An amazing Gem right in the heart of Dublin's best block, Grafton Street","My wife and I stayed here and from the moment we arrived, the experience was amazing! The atmosphere was warm and sophisticated, with a very luxurious feel. Our room was well appointed with an elegant 4 posted bed with a modern but classic decor. When it came to service, whether it was high tea (we thought was one of the best in Dublin) or just attending to every need, it was impeccable. As for the location, well let's just say perfect! Prior to booking we did have a concern about its location on Grafton Street, it's Dublin's busiest and most exclusive shopping district. However, it perfectly situated on a nook and never did we hear a thing. It really was an amazing and memorable experience.",5,2013,03,03
203,MUST STAY FOR ANY AMERICAN IN DUBLIN',My young daughter and I stayed for a few days in late November 2012-Loved the afternoon tea!!  Great food at Wilde. FANTASTIC location. The staff is SO great- they take great care of the hotel guests!  LOVE LOVE LOVE The Westbury!,4,2013,03,01
203,Taken care of!,"Stayed here to celebrate good news with my wife on valentines weekend. Lovely restful foom with excellent amenities. Beautiful bed. Great view. Location is incredible. Had an issue with the neighboring room having a loud TV the first night of a 3 night stay. Front desk sorted it out immediately. Got moved the next day to a different room. Manager was incredible. We just wanted peace and quiet but he wanted us to have a 5 star experience. We didn't have breakfast as part of our deal and so be bought us breakfast (fantastic), moved our room, gave us complementary chocolates and gifts and all discretely and without fuss. 
The gym packs a lot into a small room. 
Love this place. 
Will definitely go back!",5,2013,03,01
203,"Fantastic, beautiful hotel!","We are just home from an overnight stay at The Westbury.  I booked this hotel as a surprise for my husbands 40th birthday so I wanted it to be really special.  Before deciding on The Westbury I had looked at lots of hotels and spent a lot of time reading up on reviews etc.  I finally picked The Westbury and I am so glad I did.  

From the moment we pulled up at the front door to the moment we left, the staff and service they gave was second to none.  I had booked a junior four poster suite and at check in we were upgraded to a king suite on the 6th floor.  The room was absolutely gorgeous, it had its on sitting area with large television, the bedroom area again with a large tv facing the bed and then an area with a stunning clawfoot bath tub with its own tv, and finally the bathroom with double sink, rain shower and toilet.  The room was spotless, modern and luxurious with the most comfortable bed! The only criticism I have of the room is that I could not find a plug beside a mirror to do my hair in the morning, small complaint as the rest of the experience was perfect.  

We had breakfast as part of the room rate and if you are considering this hotel I recommend getting the breakfast.  Again brilliant, polite staff that are very attentive, really yummy food and chilled out surroundings, just what you need first thing in the morning.  We checked out at 12 and wanted to do some shopping in the city that afternoon so the hotel let you keep the car parked longer for no extra charge! 

In summary this hotel was perfect! The location couldn't be better and everything else about it couldn't be better.  We would definitely stay here again and would have no problem recommending it to anyone.",5,2013,02,28
203,Great for a treat.,"Booked this for a treat for a friend's birthday. Room wasn't ready, but we were early, they offered another room on a lower floor but we decided to wait for the room on the higher floor.

Room and beds very comfortable, excellent location, staff very welcoming and helpful. Would stay here again for a special treat as a bit pricey.",5,2013,02,27
203,Fab Hotel in Fantastic Location,"This is the second time I have stayed at The Westbury Hotel in Dublin.  The 2nd time was just as good as the first.  This is a 5 star hotel and the rating is well deserved. We payed the same price for this 5 star hotel as we paid for a 4 star in Paris. The rooms are large, beautifully furn ished and very very comfortable beautiful comfortable bed and lovely pillows.  The Nespresso machine was fantastic.
The bathrooms are a very good size and the amenities (i.e. soap, shampoo, etc. ) are first class. There is a lovely lounge room where you can sit and have a morning or afternoon  tea , lunch or just a sandwich if you wish. 
This hotel is very convenient for walking around Dublin as it is right in the heart of the shopping precint of Grafton Street.  
Would i stay there again - absolutley.",5,2013,02,25
203,Superb. Love it!,"I stayed as a group of four and have stayed here a few times.
Service is second to none. I recently stayed in the Merrion and I much prefer the Westbury.
The location is unbeatable, right off Grafron Street. It is close to superb bar, restaurants and shopping. We had dinner in L'Gueleton and loved it.
The hotel is modern, fresh and has an lovely atmosphere. Room facilities are really good. .
Breakfast is probably my favourite part of the experience. We had a table at the window overlooking the street. Breakfast is served to your table and the service is excellent.
Next time I am in Dublin I will book here - no need to give it a second thought!",5,2013,02,25
203,Perfect hotel in Dublin City Centre,"The Westbury Hotel is a fantastic 5 star hotel right in the heart of Dublin, just off Grafton St. Nice sized (for city centre), comfortable rooms, great staff and an excellent breakfast make this a must stay hotel for anybody looking for a quality hotel in Dublin. There is parking (valet) for ‚Ç¨20 per day.",5,2013,02,25
203,Beautiful hotel.,"Dublin is a wonderful city. This hotel, set right in the heart, is a calming retreat from all the hustle and bustle of the city centre. The staff are very friendly. The rooms are very clean and well presented. 

TV didn't work properly, but who goes to dublin to watch TV?",5,2013,02,20
203,Lack of direction,My wife and I celebrated an anniversary with the Westbury's 'Wilde Valentines package' which included champagne and chocolates on arrival and breakfast in bed. When we arrived we were told we had been given a free room upgrade but the room wasn't ready... So reception took my mobile number and said they would ring when the room was ready. That never happened. Hours later we checked again and our room had been ready for some time.. The champagne and chocolates weren't there so I requested them. The champagne came. The chocolates never arrived. However at checkout the champagne was on my bill as was a tray charge for breakfast. The Wilde Restaurant by the way - the theme of the package - was shut as it wasn't busy enough!! Staff obviously had not been properly trained or guided on basic service requirements. Sad for such a beautiful hotel.,4,2013,02,19
203,Another 5 star hotel.,"We went to Dublin to stay just 03 days and try to visit the most important sites of the city and, in special, as a U2 fan, some places that has something connect to, for myself, the best rock band in the world. 

The hotel is very nice, with a perfect location as is right on the most important shop street of Dublin, Grafton Street. Also about the location, it‚Äôs really close to a lot of main sites to visit, so you don‚Äôt even need to get a taxi or other transportation. 

The room: we got an upgrade and received a spacious room. It‚Äôs nice, but normal for a 5 star hotel. Nothing different that I would say that really make you remember the room because was ‚Äúspecial‚Äù. 

The breakfast was really poor  for a 5 star hotel. I would really expect more than what I got. Before arriving on Dublin, I stayed on a 4 star hotel in Barcelona and the breakfast was much more various than Westbury breakfast. 

What we were disappointed: the concierge. On the first day, I asked about a way to go to Belfast. They answered that it does not exist any bus to go there for tourist. The 02 problems: when we got to tourist information, we found it; and some months before, a friend of mine came to Dublin and got it on his concierge hotel. On the other hand, everything we asked for other concierge members (on next days), they were very pleasant. 

I must define this hotel as a normal 5 star hotel. Nice, nothing really special, except the location.",3,2013,02,18
203,what an amazing hotel,"my wife and i have just spent the last two nights at the westbury Dublin. When we arrived the service from the front door right the way through  the hotel at a every level was fantastic.Truly wonderful, happy , helpful and enthusiastic staff who could not do enough for you.Your restaurant which we ate in Friday night was superb again great service and extremely high quality of food.why this hotel is not rated no one on trip adviser amazes me.My only suggestion is that you have a fantastic product and why not show it off.Your website needs to capture the images and ambiance of the hotel and especially the restaurant,Thanks for making our stay special.",5,2013,02,17

The hotel is attractive, modern, and well-situated on a side street one block from Grafton Street, the popular pedestrian street which runs from St. Stephen's Green down to Trinity College.  I found this location ideal, as it is very central, within walking distance of our business destination, restaurants, caf√©s and shopping, and many of the attractions we had planned to see while in Dublin.

The hotel has a very attractive second-floor lobby/caf√©/sitting area with large windows looking out over Harry Street toward Grafton.  The rooms are modern, comfortable, and well-appointed, with nice touches like a Nespresso machine in place of the usual coffee maker, and a Butler's chocolate with the nightly turn down.  I chose a Superior Room with queen bed to get the best available rate, which I found perfectly comfortable even if slightly on the smaller side by North American standards.

By far the stand out feature of the hotel was the service - the staff were invariably genuinely friendly, helpful, professional, and obviously well-trained - with none of the affected pompousness one sometimes encounters in other high-end hotels.  My colleagues and I especially appreciated the way in which they anticipated and accommodated our needs (such as offering to receive and park our rental car overnight for use the next day, at no charge).  No doubt this is at least in part due to the natural friendliness of Irish culture, but kudos nonetheless - it made our stay a pleasure from start to finish.  

For those seeking an inexpensive - but excellent - breakfast, try Honest to Goodness or Urban Picnic in George's St. Arcade just west of the hotel.   Excellent tapas with an Irish twist at Fade St. Social, and - above all - don't miss the lunch caf√© at Avoca on Suffolk Street, above the gift shop.",5,2013,02,15
203,Warmth in the rain,"We visited with friends for a three night stay. The hotel is in one of the best locations in Dublin, with shops, bars and attractions nearby. Our studio suite was large and well equipped, though some of this space could have been given up to expand the size of the bathroom.The suite did contain two extremely comfortable armchairs with an ottoman, which we used quite a bit.Free wi-fi was also included which is a must, these days.

What made the hotel very special though were the staff, who were without exception, helpful, informative and warm and almost entirely Irish. Nothing was too much trouble for them and on more than one occasion they came over to us to make sure everything was fine with the stay. The hotel was busy, yet large enough not to seem overcrowded.

Minor niggles were no nuts or chips in the bar. Instead we had a more fancy olive/pickle plate of condiments with our drinks and the noise from the bar down the street could be clearly heard within our room(354) along with noise from the room next door. Would have been good to have had ITV UK on the TV channels. BBC was there!.

We would definitely recommend and hope to return.",5,2013,02,12
203,"Great choice for a Dublin hotel, amazing service though tiny rooms!","I lived in Dublin for 7 years and am Irish, having used this hotel as a venue for events in the past. Having said that, I never stayed the night in the hotel! 

The first thing that struck me about the hotel was the genuine friendliness and fun about the staff, in particular the valet staff - they are why people love Dublin, great craic!! They were lovely, friendly, so helpful and more importantly, genuinely wanted to help. I have always found the staff professional and so useful, so this wasn't a huge surprise.

The check in was great but the rooms are tiny - though this may be expected considering the location in my opinion is the best in the city.
The food, as I recall is brilliant, though on this occasion we didn't eat there.

We did drink in the lounge after hours, as we returned to the hotel at around midnight and the back bar was closed which was a disappointment. Staff were accommodating in getting us a drink, but the lights were on full and someone was vacuuming the room which was a bit off-putting.

My recommendation to other travellers is to come at Christmas, the lights are always amazing and there's always a brilliant buzz in the bar, the bar staff are also great mixologists so go for a cocktail (particularly the whiskey based cocktails for the men!)

As I said the rooms were really small: two girls with weekend bags pretty much filled the twin room!! All in all, the fees are a little high for the size of room (maybe try the Westin as their rooms are great) but you have to stay in the Westbury just once for the experience!",4,2013,02,11
203,Why stay anywhere else ?,"The Westbury is right in the middle of the best restaurants, bars and shopping in Ireland. Other Hotels simply cannot compete with the Westburys' superior location and reputation

I have stayed at the Westbury 4 times now and on each occasion the experience has been superb. 

If the weather is too harsh to venture outside the Westbury has great dining options and a popular bar open late. My friends in Dublin love when I stay there - they come to visit me rather than me go to them

5 stars",5,2013,02,11
203,the Wilde package < dinnr bed n brekky >,"this was our 4th .. GO at the wilde package and our last... if the menu stays as it   currently  is.
very disappointed with the set menu content and quantity of same
basically chicken or fish and tis no wonder...that . one is plied with breads and olive oil dips 
at the very start and that it  is used 2 supplement every course thereafter  it seems?.
the portions R  really extremely small  , lol  my wife,s salmon portions consisted of 2 sugar cube size pieces of salmon and a blob of mousse actually they were smaller than sugar cubes,ok it was a starter but the other portions were of similar small size..not worth the money at all.",5,2013,02,10
203,Great location,"All you could really want and the other reviews tell the truth.2grips,why such a complicated coffee machine in the room and why two requests for additional tea bags for the room where ignored. Other than that excellent",4,2013,02,10
203,Excellent hotel in an excellent location,"Absolutely loved the central location of this hotel. Eveything right at your fingertips within walking distance as soon s you step outside the doors. Professional and welcoming immediately and throughout our stay. This hotel is first class and so is the staff! 

Our room was impeccable. No only was it large but also beautifuly decorated and very clean and so comfortable. The bathroom was beautifully appointed, large and extremely clean as well.

The turndown service alone was the best I have ever encountered.",5,2013,02,08
203,Another stellar stay in Dublin,"The Westbury is a first class hotel with very friendly and helpful people, a great location very walkable to Grafton street and plenty of great shops, restaurants, coffee, boutiques, Ted Baker store, etc.",5,2013,02,07
203,Bliss,"Just back from our second stay and once again feel pampered and refreshed. The hotel is beautiful with the huge seating area upstairs that just makes you want to sit on those sofas and chill for hours! The room was lovely, excellent toiletries, everything in top condition. Great staff and a bar that makes a perfect Vodka martini! And the fun of just stepping outside the door and being in the very heart of Dublin. We'll be back again!",5,2013,02,06
203,The Westbury Weekend,"We have stayed many times over past years - always the best of service with friendly and efficient staff, mostly from Europe!! but well trained in Irish hospitality skills :-) Comfortable Rooms, wonderful afternoon tea service - a meal in itself!! 5 star restaurant service, just wish that there were some Irish traditionals on the otherwise first class menu. The location is quite secret and even the best of Navigation Systems have trouble circumventing the maze of ""secret"" routes to the location!! Once there - the valet takes over and one can forget the car until it is time to leave. Highly recommended for Service Quality, and Location, walking distance to the Theatres and Grafdton Street attractions - We will be back......................",5,2013,02,06
203,Excellent Hotel in a Great Location,"The Westbury is the best hotel in Dublin - there are other hotels which will cost you more money, but they are not better than the Westbury.  Great location right near Grafton street, and the customer service is spectacular.  Wonderful experience start to finish.",5,2013,02,06
203,Excellent,"We stayed two nights, and we would be hard pushed to find a fault. Friendly staff, comfortable sorroundings, cleanliness, perfect location within walking distance to restaurants, pubs, shops. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. They were attentive, but not overpowering. If we stated any faults we would be splitting hairs. Would definitly stay again.",5,2013,02,05
203,Location and Service!,"Stayed one night in January with some business friends. The hotel is difficult to get to because of Dublin's one way street system, however once we got to the front door, the superb service commenced. Our car was quickly valet parked in the hotel car park and we moved to the check-in where the great service continued. Competent, professional and friendly.  The concierge was very helpful and knowledgble, giving us a Dublin Tourist map for reference. 
Our room was very well appointed and very comfortable. The hotel is within walking distance of all the major attractions and shopping in Dublin. The hotel lobby is a must! You can enjoy a drink or afternoon tea in luxurious surroundings. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2013,02,04
203,the best at the westbury,pure luxury. enjoy being spoilt for your stay. great location. rooms were lovely. enjoy drinks in the room overlooking grafton street. staff very pleasant couldn't do enough for you. very quick check in & out.,5,2013,02,03
203,10 out of 10. . .,"Stayed here four times in the past year after being a relativley loyal Shelbourne visitor.   (always business trips).
Locaiton is outstanding if you are walking or taking a taxi.    A bit tricky if you are driving a car but htey do have undergrond parking.
Rooms are very clean albiet just a bit small, bathrooms are modern and very clean.   Beds and linnens are great.
The lobby is the main attraction. . . It is very big, plenty of couches, chairs, seating areas.  Very relaxing while traveling on business ..  ...   I would give this a 10 out of 10 for locaiton, espeically if you are being a tourist.    Shelbourne tries a bit too hard to be pretentious while the Westbury is actually more refined.",5,2013,02,03
203,Fabulous hotel,"Only stayed one night and wished it could have been many more. The hotel is in an excellent location, city centre but on a quiet side street - so easy access to shopping, restaurants, bars etc. the service is top class right from the moment you walk into the hotel. The rooms are sumptuous luxury, very clean and a great retreat after a day spent shopping on graft on street. Highly recommended",5,2013,02,02
203,ANOTHER BRILLIANT VISIT TO THIS TOP NOTCH HOTEL,"I think previous reviews make it clear how well located, brilliantly maintained and pleasantly staffed this hotel is.  Often not mentioned, though, even closer than the half block walk to Grafton Street is one of Dublin's most authentic pubs - McDaids.  Its practically in the hotel lobby.",5,2013,02,01
203,Great hotel and great staff,This hotel is amazing and the staff really cares. Rooms are clean and are a good size. On my next trip to Dublin this is where I will stay. This hotel is in a great location. I do not know how they do it but it seems that all the staff want to make sure you have a great stay. This hotel has got it right!,5,2013,02,01
203,Home away from home,"I travel to Dublin frequently on business and have stayed in a number of hotels in the city, including the Merrion, the Shelbourne and a number of others. The Westbury however I have stayed at a few times, and is fast becoming my favorite Dublin hotel.

The rooms are of a good standard, always clean and tidy. Although be sure to ask for a room on a high floor or away from the front of the building as the spotslights in front shine right up into the rooms.

Breakfast is very good, I always go for the Eggs Benedict and in fact even when I havent stayed in the hotel I will go for breafast in the Cafe Novo.

As an added benefit for those visiting Dublin for the first time, it is located just off Grafton Street so is ideal for shopping etc...

The staff are always friendly, and make an effort to welcome you back if you've visted multiple times.

All in all a good hotel and I would recommend it.",4,2013,02,01
203,Anniversary break,"Myself and my wife recently stayed at the Westbury Hotel Dublin, on our 30 th. Wedding Anniversary.

I have read some of the reviews, especially the poor ones, and cannot understand the complaints.

We arrived early, and our room was not ready. We were immediately offered complimentary tea and coffee, and the key was bought to us personally within 30 minutes.

The whole stay was made very memorable by the excellent demeanour and friendliness of the staff.

On entering our room we were greeted dy a platter of chocolates and an anniversary card from the front desk staff.

The room was immaculate and the service everywhere in the hotel was exemplary.

We have stayed in 5 star hotels in Australia and New Zealand, and none compare to the Westbury.

Breakfast was excellent, with very prompt and courteous service.

We will definitely be staying at the Westbury again next time we go to Dublin, and I would just like to thank all for staff for making our stay very memorable.",5,2013,02,01
203,Sheer Luxury,My husband and I have been lucky enough to stay in the Westbury on a number of occasions and we continue to recommend this hotel and to return ourselves because for us there simply isn't a better location or a more luxurious setting without being pretentious. I have never met a grumpy or cold staff member and I love how you can step outside into the bustle of Grafton Street and then retreat back into an oasis of calm and luxury in the Westbury. Yes it's a little expensive but YES it's worth the money...try it...you won't be disappointed! ,5,2013,01,30
203,Staff Recomandation,"I'm Sam Mishu, My family and i Stayed at the Westbury Dublin from 1/9 till 1/14/13. we had great service, the hotel location is very convenient and the staff were wonderful. they were very friendly and cooperative. Special thanks to my new friend Najib (sorry don't have his last name) he was a great help to me and my family. Keep the good work, we will stay at the Westbury again when we visit Ireland.",5,2013,01,28
203,Excellent customer care,"Joan O'S

My husband and I stayed at the Westbury Hotel recently.
Yes the hotel and location are superb, yet for me staying in any hotel customer care is the key to it‚Äôs front door. I also believe it‚Äôs the secret to a successful business.
I had a chance to experience their customer care on this visit as we had a hiccup with the heating in our room, it did not work and it was a pretty cold evening.
On realising this I was about to ring down to reception when the housekeeping lady knocked at the door to do the bed turn-down. Within minutes we had the hotel Manager at our door with his attitude of excellent customer care, which ended with us feeling warm and looked after.
From our vast experience of hotel stays worlwideand we have had all kinds, the Westbury has the key. To stay there again would be our pleasure",5,2013,01,27
203,Excellent hotel - location can't be beat,"This is an excellent hotel whose location can't be beat.  It is so hard to find by car, but somehow we managed it.  This hotel was definitely worth the price, we were thrilled with our stay.  No complaints.",5,2013,01,26
203,Classic quality hotel in the heart of Dublin,"After a very long flight from Australia it was great to arrive at the Westbury. It was a little difficult to find as we had an address but driving our hire car without a map in the winding and one way streets of Dublin wasn't easy, so if your driving be sure you know where you going.

However as we pulled up at the front of the hotel the efficient concierge jumped straight to it.

The reception team were equally helpfull and efficient.

We were in our very pleasant room in double quick time on the 5th floor. 

Nice room will all we needed and a quality coffee maker.

Very comfortable bed.

Complimentary wireless.

Nice views across the rooftops of Dublin too.

Even a USB charger for my iPhone.

Only thing missing was the ability to plugg our Auatrlian appliances in to power. This issue is resolved in hotels u have stayed in through Asia but unfortunately if you have Aus plugs you will need an adapter.

Very nice bar for Pre dinner drinks, and a short walk to dozens of bars and restaurants in Dublin.

We didn't eat in the hotel so I don't know what the food is like, but it looked good!

If I'm in Dublin again I would be very happy to stay here again for business or with my family.

Very very pleasant stay.",5,2013,01,25
203,Luxury right in the centre of Dublin,"Location - location - location.  Sit in the lobby, sipping tea and people watching.  You can watch the activities inside the hotel, and also on the side street leading to Grafton Street, which is Dublin's premier shopping street.  Superb location, and service with a smile, in this luxurious hotel.  Rooms are excellent, well soundproofed, clean, and stylish.  We stayed for just one night, as it was so convenient for the Gaiety Theatre, just a 2 minute walk away.  Food is excellent, but expensive.  Valet parking (at ‚Ç¨20 a night), great breakfast in bed (served hot, which is unusual for breakfast in bed), and a busy atmosphere in the lobby, which was full of business types, ladies having afternoon tea, and young professionals sipping champagne cocktails.  One small crib - the afternoon tea is absurdly expensive for a couple of tiny sandwiches, a scone, and a few miniscule buns.  Paying ‚Ç¨70 for a couple (more if you want a glass of house champagne), is way over the top.  But staff are friendly and professional in true Dublin style, and overall it is hard to fault this hotel.",4,2013,01,25
203,Exquisite,"Stayed at The Westbury for one night recently. The lobby and reception area are fabulous. Check-in was swift and the staff were both courteous and professional. 

The superior room we stayed in on the 5th floor was immaculate - clean and spacious. I had a bottle of champagne and called room service for a bucket of ice. I then had to leave the hotel to pick something up. When i returned 30 minutes later, my champagne was chilling in a bucket of ice with 2 champagne glasses at the ready beside it - superb service.

We went out for dinner that evening and, upon returning to the hotel, had a drink in the Marble Bar. The bar area is very spacious and has a wonderful, relaxing ambience. The bar staff were very polite and effeicient.

When we returned to our room, we were delighted to find rose petals sprinkled on the bed with a Butlers chocolate on each side of the duvet and a complimentary bottle of water on each bed-side table. This was a real touch of class from the hotel staff.

To sum up - The Westbury Hotel is everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel and more. If you are looking for a real luxury stay in the heart of Dublin City - or you want to spoil somebody special - then look no further than The Westbury. A fabulous hotel.",5,2013,01,25
203,"Average , poor noise insulation and pretty bad gym","Stayed here for two nights on business. Pleasant enough hotel with some good staff, but totally overpriced for what it is. 

Food in the bar was average, as was the continental breakfast offering. 

Room was spacious, yet the aircon did not work properly, the water pressure on the sink taps was non-existent, the TV remote had issue and worst of all, you could hear the noise from the corridor and next door. 

The gym is a disgrace - small, cold (with a broken Argos shop heater), totally outdated equipment.

I am relatively suspicious about the number of gleaming reviews for this hotel which are all from people from Ireland who have not reviewed anything else.... maybe Tripadvisor should check this....",2,2013,01,25
203,The best hotel in Dublin,"With a superb location, excellent staff and a hotel of complete luxury, the Westbury really must be the best hotel in Dublin.  I have had the pleasure of staying at this super hotel a number of times and each time it keeps reaching the highest of standards and gets better with each stay.  This time was an anniversary occassion, where we received an upgrade to a fantastic room with 4 poster bed..a really great hotel to mark the occassion.
Fully recommend this hotel - without doubt it must be the best in Dublin.",5,2013,01,23
203,Events at The Westbury,"I used The Westbury Hotel for a recent client event. They provided an excellent standard of service. The staff were always friendly, courteous and obliging. Nothing was a problem to do or find. I would definitely recommend using The Westbury Hotel to host an event and will be doing so again in the future.",5,2013,01,23
203,One of the Best,"One of the best hotels in Dublin, and there are many good ones in Dublin. Westbury has the unique advantage of being right in the middle of Grafton Street, where all the action is. The baskers, the shopping, the food, and a stone's throw away from St Stephen Green's LUAS station. The rooms were large and comfortable and breakfast was nothing short of excellent. My only complaint would be that the WIFI had a poor signal because we were in one of the corner rooms at the sides of the hotel. While you're there, get some cheese from Sheridan's Cheesemonger and try a cuppa of Butler's hot chocolate.",4,2013,01,22
203,dublin shopping,"Our family stays regulary at the Westbury Hotel using it as our shopping and meeting friends base. It is always like coming home to family, the staff are always so helpfull which is wonderful as we invariably bring our three small children, the Hotel always surpasses our expectations. When ever rooms have been unavailable we have stayed in other local 5 star hotels and the experience is never as good as the Westbury.My family and I love the Tea/ Piano/ reception area for late evening drinks and snacks, we simply adore the Westbury and its excellent staff.",5,2013,01,22
203,What a shock,"Took a friend here for a drink to celebrate her birthday.
While she went to the bathroom, I ordered two glasses of champagne.
While the barman punched the details into the till I noticed that 1. The glasses appeared to be much smaller than the last time I was in and 2. The raspberries were mouldy!
Disgusting.
He asked me for ‚Ç¨32 to which I replied-""For ‚Ç¨32 you'd want to do better than stale raspberries.""
I took out the raspberries myself. He charged me ‚Ç¨18 and gave us a complimentary topup.
Went to the bathroom and the dining area was an absolute disgrace. The tables hadn't been cleared and this was 11 pm. It was filthy and smelly.
I will not be returning.",1,2013,01,20
203,What An Experience,"Just had the most wonderfull weekend at this hotel. From the time we arrived the staff could not be more helpful. The car was taken and parked for you. Your luggage brought in. Upto the room and OMG what a room. Four poster bed and all the trimmings. Breakfast was a complete experience from the time you entered the dining room, fabulous food. Expensive but worth every Euro. We will be back next year to be pampered.",5,2013,01,18
203,Great stay,"Excellent service, spotless rooms, fantastic location and a wonderful atmosphere, thank you for a great stay!  A special thanks to Siobhan in the lounge who helped us mark our friends birthday, outstanding service.  We will be back!",5,2013,01,17
203,Mini-moon,"Stayed at the ""westbury"" Dublin for 2 nights, this hotel is absolutely fantastic, right in the heart of the city centre grafton street right on the door step..near all restaurants, boutique shops, pubs and ""posh shops"". Soon as myself and my husband arrived we were  greeted by the concierge who took our car to the underground car park. The staff at the reception were extremely pleasant and very welcoming ( we had a dreadful journey over on the plane). We booked a superior double room over looking the main shopping street. Room was spotless, well equipped and came with everything you may have needed. Bathroom was a good size with complementary products and loads of mirrors!! And a telephone! We were sent a complementary bowl of fruit and two big chocolate and blueberry muffins and a congratulations card, as we only got married a couple of months ago...meals are fantastic...it is a 5* hotel so expect to pay a little bit more....breakfast either full cooked or continental....we had continental..spoilt for choice. The hotel itself is beautiful and spotless,  myself and my husband praise the staff as  they were very helpful and couldn't do enough for us...The only down side was finding the hotel....as the city centre has a one way system in place, the westbury  was quite hard to find, it must have taken us an hour...so take a sat- nav.....will definitely stay again...hopefully back in July.",5,2013,01,15
203,Perfect hotel,"After having just returned from a short trip in Dublin I would like to express just how wonderful The Westbury Hotel is. The whole experience from start to finish was simply wonderful. All the staff constantly go above and beyond to ensure your every need is met, a special thanks goes out to Ashely the concierge who was extremely helpful all weekend and went that extra mile for us each day. We stayed in one of the suites, the room was superb, extra large extremely comfortable bed and lovely clean bathroom, the only small gripe we found was that the tv remote wouldn't work when using it from the bed as it was quite a distance but this was a very minor detail and really caused no problem. This hotel is in a prime location and is pretty much central to everything you need. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will certainly stay in The Westbury again.",5,2013,01,14
203,"Perfect location, excellent staff - great choice in Dublin.","Our stay at the Westbury was short (only two nights) and it was the perfect choice. Its proximity to Grafton Street and the other major sites was ideal. In addition, the hotel services were excellent and staff was exceptionally helpful, friendly and accommodating. Overall, it was the perfect choice for a weekend in Dublin. 

The rooms were clean, however our particular room seemed in need of some updates.  I said such in a survey and got an immediate response from a manager apologising and letting me know that he would guarantee the room quality of any future reservations I made.",5,2013,01,13
203,Excellent base to explore Dublin,"Our small travel group decided to stay closer to home this time in their latest journeying.It was agreed that we would visit the beautiful city of Dublin, Ireland to celebrate the wedding anniversary of one couple in the group( ours - 49 years).

The flight from Gatwick to Dublin by Aer Lingus was seamless and uneventful, arriving before our allotted time.

Having landed at Dublin, we decided to catch the Airport Express bus into the centre of the  city. You catch it just outside the main entrance into the  airport building .It cost 6 Euros one way which we considered to be good value for the 30 minute ride.We also bought our 'hop on hop off ' city tour bus tickets at the same time which covered a 48 hour period from when the ticket is first validated. They cost 14 Eros each which, we again, thought was good value. More so because by buying them at the airport we saved 4 Euros each against what we would have paid in the city itself.

The bus dropped us off within a short walk of The Westbury Hotel and as we only had hand luggage, it was not a problem.

The Westbury Hotel is located in a side road  about half way along Grafton Street which is  one of the main shoppping streets in the city.

As you turn into the  side road, you are confronted with this magnificent looking building housing The Westbury. As you enter the building itself you immediately sense the grandeur and opulence of the place. The reception is located on the first floor which means by the time you  arrive to book in, you are well and truly inside the hotel.

All around you are vast areas of of luxurious seating which are used to 'take afternoon tea' or 'indulge in morning coffee'.

Although we had arrived early, we were told that our rooms were ready. The  booking in procedure was seamless and the  reception staff and for that matter, all the staff we came into contact with during our short stay were superb. Polite, attentive and willing to go that extra mile to ensure our stay was memorable.

Having been whisked up to our rooms on the third floor, we were pleasantly surprised as we opened the  door into our room.We were struck by the spaciousness of the room .Further exploration, discovered a divine bathroom well equipped with every type of  toiletry you could think of.

There was a safe, coffee making facilities and a well stocked mini bar.

The room itself was  tastefully decorated and  the large  armchair located in front of the T.V was just right for the weary  traveller returning from a day exploring the city!

The bed and linen were of the highest quality and  everything were scrupulously clean.

Come evening time, there was maid service who prepared the bed for sleeping. The chocolates left on the pillows went down very nicely.

A realy nice touch to our stay was when there was knock at the door and a  member of staff appeared and presented us with a cake and cards from the management to celebrate our wedding anniversary.That evening , in addtion to setting the bed for sleep, fresh rose petals were sprinkled across the  bedding.That was something else!

The concierge was extremely knowledgeable and helpful and gave us a good stear as to where to go in the city.

Beakfast. That was something else.

When you book the room you are able to book and pay for breakdfast up font. It saves a few Euros. We opted to go for the full Irish breakfast. However, the buffet was so tantalising and exstensive, we actually opted for that.

Cooked breakfasts are chosen from the menu and  waitress served and obviously freshly cooked.

The range of foods /cereals/drinks was superb. Something for everyone.

All too soon it was time to leave.The booking out was seamless and as we had decided to return to the Airport by taxi, the conciege arranged  the car and the porter transported our luggage to the car for us.

Would we use The Westbury should we return to Dublin City. Absolutely, ""Yes""!",5,2013,01,12
203,Our Westbury experience,"Myself and my Husband stayed in the Westbury over the New year period. From the moment we arrived at the Hotel to the time we left the warmth and courtesy we were treated with from all staff made us feel like Royalty . We are from Dublin and are well aware of the great reputation of this fine Hotel and all it has to offer including its great location in the heart of Dublin . It lived up to all we had expected and more! We stayed in a luxury suite which was very spacious and decorated and furnished beautifully . The room had all you would need to relax in , including tv, phone, wi fi,
Fridge bar not to mention a wonderfully comfortable bed! 
We ate in the Resturant , had breakfast and had dinner on two occasions which was fine dinning at its best! But for all of what the Westbury had to offer it was the staff who made the stay the most enjoyable part of the experience. They were wonderful and couldn't do enough to make our stay one to remember . Will we be back? Definitely!!",5,2013,01,12
203,Luxury in Dublin,"We stayed here for 5 nights over the new year period 2012 / 2013 in a luxury suite.

The hotel is in a great location for shopping and exploring Dublin. Most major attractions and famous Dublin landmarks are a short walk or cheap taxi ride away. The airport run was ‚Ç¨20.

The welcome we received was very warm and the staff here seemed to grasp the balance of a relaxed approach along with very high service. This is rare and it was excellent throughout our stay even when minor issues occurred.

Breakfast is ‚Ç¨15 for a continental or ‚Ç¨25 for the full Irish (which includes all the continental options). Both come with endless tea / coffee / juice. The breakfast seems expensive, however it is in fact good value when considering the options locally and the very high quality that was delivered each day.

Breakfast is busy each day and our recommendation is to arrive a little earlier (08:30) as there can be a wait if you hit rush hour, which seems to start around 09:00.

The room was luxurious. We had a large lounge, good size bedroom, separate bathroom with a double bath and a good quality shower in the second bathroom with twin sinks. High quality fittings and furniture, two large flat screens TV's and complementary wifi throughout the hotel, which is only right considering the per night price. lovely comfy (big) dressing gowns and a turn down service each night complimented the room experience. 

The entire hotel seems to have a good reputation with local people. Afternoon tea is often fully booked and the bar had a good 'lounge' atmosphere during the evenings. The bar prices where not bad. ‚Ç¨5.60 for a pint of Guinness whereas it was ‚Ç¨5 in the pubs nearby. The difference? Quality service and you don't get nibbles delivered to your comfy seating area in the pub.

We had room service once, which again was a good quality. Hot food delivered within 25 mins of ordering.

We enjoyed the stay here and would certainly use this hotel again and recommend it for a quality experience in Dublin.",5,2013,01,11
203,Great location if you can afford it ...,"Great location just off Grafton Street. Clearly a classy hotel in the perfect place. If you can afford, do stay! Parking available too. Rooms were large, clean and beds were incredibly comfortable. Staff are very nice and helpful, even when arriving at odd hours. The only thing I would say is that the breakfast is probably overpriced. Recommend you take a short walk onto Grafton Street to Bewleys (Famous coffee shop).",4,2013,01,10
203,Great all round,"My husband and I stayed for one nice on Boxing Day. 

The facilities and general surrounding are all superb. Our room overlooked Bruxelles (a well known bar) but we couldn't hear any of the noise through our window which was a relief.

The staff are lovely, not at all snobbish - very accommodating.

Would definitely recommend.",5,2013,01,10
203,Stay in the Westbury hotel,"the location is prime - right off the main shopping streen the room was grea, very clean and classy. the service is exceptional, when I asked for the room service they went out of his way to make sure I found what I needed. all the days I stayed is great experience.",5,2013,01,09
203,Basic requirement is a nights sleep - whether 1 or 5 stars,"I have stayed here a number of times and except for some issues with bag delivery have generally been happy. However this time I stayed in room 609. and suffered constant loud noise (alternately pulsing and humming). According to the staff the issue was a problem with an AC unit on the roof which they ""would fix ASAP"" - an hour later they ""were still working on it"", another hour passes and on questioning "" it was a different issue which would mean switching off the AC to half the hotel and we cannot do that - as it is now past 5am we cannot offer another room (!) and so we will send up some ear plugs!!!""  When the manager came on duty he was not made aware of any issue and after looking into it agreed it was unacceptable and agreed not to charge me (what else could he do as I got NO sleep?) I am still awaiting the promised letter of explanation four weeks later.",3,2013,01,09
203,Absolutely Fantastic.,My partner and I had a short stay at the Westbury on the run up to Christmas.  This was our second year to do this.  We enjoyed our say so much on the first visit that we now plan on making it part of our Christmas plans.  We love the ambiance and the fantastic service.  Location for shopping and taking in the city atmosphere is incrediable.  When I was tounger my parents took me to the Westbury on Christmas Eve on a number of occasions. From then I was hooked !I enjoyed the stay so much that I bought my parents a voucher for a mini-break in the new year.  The Westbury is very special to our family.,5,2013,01,09
203,"My stay over Christmas 2012 at the Westbury, Dublin",I had an overnight stay at the Westbury on Friday 28th December 2012 in order to go to a Dubliner concert at Vicar street. I had a fantactic stay- the staff were lovely and accomodating and the atmosphere was extrememly pleasent. Luxurious without being intimdating- spot on irish hospitality.,5,2013,01,09
203,Best hotel in Dublin city centre,"I have been staying in hotels in Dublin city at the same time every year for the last 5 years and can say that the Westbury is by far the best, facilities are excellent compared to the other hotels in the area. Staff are very friendly and the location is perfect. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Dublin city centre.",5,2013,01,09
203,Great Hotel,"We went for a weekend away with some friends for some shopping, eating and a few drinks!

It didn't start off so well when we attempted to check in and found there was only room booked for the four of us!!  I had booked through American Express and at the time of booking they had sent me a confirmation from the hotel, it had 4 people on it but only 1 room booked, I queried this and was assured it was correct, apparently it was not! After a nerve wrecking ten minutes it was sorted out and we both checked in.

When you come into the hotel you feel slightly let down as it doesn't look much but once you go up the stairs and see the lobby you can't fail to be impressed, it's very warm and welcoming with a wonderful piano and some fantastic chandeliers , it certainly has the wow factor. We had afternoon tea with champagne and it was wonderful, a real treat, lovely food and it was a great way to spend the afternoon people watching. Whilst we were having the tea the manager came over to apologise for the mix up and to offer us tickets for a musical that night which I thought was a lovely touch and really made us feel valued.

We stayed in a deluxe room and whilst nice and big with a walk in closet I wasn't overally impressed, it was a bit worn around the edges with marks on the furniture and the carpet was slightly grubby. The bathroom was tiny and only had a shower over the bath which I personally hate, lovely toiletries.

We had breakfast the next morning and that was a hot buffet which was good, perhaps a bit more choice would have been welcome.

We again had afternoon tea and it was wonderful, the staff are very friendly and there are some Irish staff which is nice to hear. 

We had cocktails in the downstairs bar that evening which has a good atmosphere and we had late drinks in the lobby (with some very welcome sandwiches!) when we got in after 1 that evening.

The hotel is in a great spot, you can walk everywhere from it which makes things easier, the staff are very friendly, the food we had was great, I would stay again but perhaps the next time go for the next room up.",4,2013,01,08
203,Fantastic hotel,"The location is prime - right off the main shopping street.  The room was much larger than I was expecting - very clean, classy.  The service was exceptional - when i asked the concierge for help, he went out of his way to make sure I found what I needed.  I would pay the extra money to stay at this hotel - and I rarely say that.  Only improvement would be the gym.",5,2013,01,08
203,The good and the bad,"I'm in the middle of a 6 night say and here are my findings.  The property is conveniently located to the tourist areas.  A walk to Trinity College is about 5 minutes, and Temple Bar is about 10 minutes.  I am staying in a room facing the front of the hotel, and the noise from the two pubs is almost unbearable at night. The noise lasts well past 2am.  Good thing I brought my earplugs.  The internet service is spotty at best.  The staff is very attentive and service is great.  The restaurant is nice and the servers are happy to have you as their guest.  The food is OK, and prices are reasonable for a hotel.  There is much better meals to be had within a short walk of the hotel.  
I would stay here again because of the close proximity to where I am working, but if I were to visit Dublin on my own, I would seek another hotel.",4,2013,01,06
203,A truly great hotel...,"I have just had the pleasure of staying at the Westbury for 3 nights over the new year period. My sister had her wedding her on New Year's Eve and the Westbury made it extra special. I'll start with the rooms. My room was a fantastic double room on the 4th floor and the service to the room was impeccable. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels in the Middle East and none of them come close to the type of room service that I encountered here. Great TV selection in my room also. The breakfast each morning was absolutely superb. What made this extra special for me was quite simply, the staff. Special mention to wedding organiser Catherine, operations managers Scott and Christopher and lastly, waitress Emma from Cork. The latter were truly unique, special and thoroughly professional individuals.....5 star individuals. Thank you Westbury for an amazing experience, I'll be back next year.",5,2013,01,05
203,Superb!!,"Excellent hotel - had a super visit from the moment I arrived at the hotel and my case was taken from me - if you want to be pampered this is the hotel to stay in!  All staff I spoke to were very friendly,  polite and efficient and they provided a first class service.  The hotel itself is elegant and sophisicated - public areas and rooms are immaculately and tastefully decorated and the facilities provided are excellent.  The room itself was a good size and provided all the amentities you would expect in a hotel of this standard.  It was the best ""turn down"" service I have ever expereienced - complimentary sweet, water, glasses, slippers and floor mat all left in place and lights switched on for your return.  Location of the hotel is excellent - you are right in the middle of town - Grafton Street - and yet it is very quiet as it is on a quiet side street.  Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again the next time i am in Dublin.",5,2013,01,05
203,Excellent Customer Service levels,"I live in Dublin, myself and my wife treat ourselves to nights away rather than purchasing gifts. This was our Christmas present, and was our second stay in the Westbury after spending our wedding anniversary there in August. On both occasions it has been a fantastic experience. In my opinion it has the best customer service levels for a hotel in Dublin, I have yet to experience better, and I look forward to many more stays",5,2013,01,05
203,A wonderful New Year break!,"My husband and I have just returned from a New Year break here. It was great. Special mention must be given to Rory from Shankhill who served us breakfast. He was outstanding and we felt deserved promotion. People skills are essential in staff at The Westbury and he has them in abundance. Also, his attention to detail in serving us breakfast stood out from the crowd. Well done Rory. Another mention must be made of the manager, Joseph, who was on duty on December 31st. He sorted out a problem with discretion and kindness. This went a long way as this break was because I have cancer and Joseph was unaware of this. Thank you Joseph. 
Suite accommodaition was excellent and to be recommended. Breakfast times were great and there was a very leisurely atmosphere in the dining room.  We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of visiting Dublin for a short break. It is definitely worthy of its 5 stars. Thank you. Mary and John Joughin

",5,2013,01,04
203,It's Still the Best Hotel in Dublin,"Staff were extremely friendly and courteous and as you would expect the rooms and public spaces were immaculate. Issue on arrival with our room  resolved immediately by the very helpful Jane on front desk- who incidentally proved efficient upon a minor issue on check out also. We couldn't praise the front desk staff or the concierge enough. Although I would caution that personal questions about whether or not we were ""escaping for the night"" by a young lady on front desk who's name I shall not mention were not particularly well received- however innocently made. The Irish welcome is one thing but this is a 5 star hotel, the inference of such a statement grated after 9 hours travelling time prior to our arrival and the fact that she felt comfortable enough to make it in the first place- a customer being friendly is not an invitation for informality.

Some minor issues remain, the walls can be somewhat thin but I think this has more to do with the default audio settings on the tv's in room or indeed the tv's themselves- it's arguably a feature of modern models- better sound equals more noise but it can get irritating. The fan in our bathroom didn't work and while opening the door immediately after showering -cleared the steam- slightly irritating again given the five star nature of the hotel but we were staying for leisure not business- which would have pushed me to complain given the rush that accompanies getting out in the morning. Found the showers pathetic- a pumping system would assist. Also some wear and tear on the paintwork- small details but it would be unfortunate to see such issues neglected to the point of decline.

In room breakfast was fine although I would suggest either new trays or invest in some trolley's...we set up the tray rest in the hallway which worked well for getting room service just set down but each morning the poor guy bringing us breakfast had to make his way into the room to set down the hot plates of full Irish on the table..inevitably one of us was still in bed and I felt for the service staff having to intrude in this way- which was getting slightly irritating for us also. Notably the Westin provides breakfast on trolley which is left in the hallway, which I find  comparatively much better. 

As mentioned in previous reviews- housekeeping staff are quite noisy, chatting away to each other in the corridors and adjoining rooms quite early in the morning. I don't quite understand the need for this, particularly as there is a mix of business and leisure customers in the hotel at any given time- rest being the order of the day for the latter. One couldn't help but feel this is a strategy to rouse guests to ensure cleaning schedule is adhered to- not the problem of guests and I must say this is something which should really be addressed by management. Case and point- on our first night we thought some other guests were being fairly loud and dismissed it as it was only 7.30 pm and we thought each to their own- not so, it was the cleaning staff. Again not frankly sure why guests should put up and down with it. Having said that the staff encountered in hallways always had a friendly hello and couldn't do enough for us, if they could just keep it down a bit it would help with the whole paying for a 5 star to get some rest!

As for its five stars- location, staff and comfort continue to make the Westbury our favorite spot in Dublin. So much so that I had reservations even commenting on minor issues such as the above but at the prices paid per night and for the stars above the door the small things could be better. Overall it however the Westbury and its staff are still the best in Dublin.",5,2013,01,04
203,Home from home,"Having spend many times at the Westbury, it for us was the perfect loctation for our wedding. The staff from being to end were wonderful . Many of our guests now stay at the Westbury as they said the hotel  and staff were lovely. We have stayed many since then and always the service from front desk to the porters and the general staff are always friendly and helpful. I would like to give a special note to Joseph and Catherine who are both always perfossional and friendly. I suppose my only complaint and it is not really one...but with the amount of times, wedding etc we have never been offered a upgrade.As for location , perfect for Night life weather you want a romantic , family evening or a trip around all the great clubs  for the young and trendy with that said wonderful shopping on Grafton street and with Trinity college two minutes walk away culture is all around you. To finish, the Westbury hotel is my home from home, friendly, excellent service and always made to feel very welcome.",5,2013,01,02
203,Christmas mini break,"Just back from a four night Christmas mini break in Dublin.  The Westbury is a lovely hotel with many, many plus points but a few minor issues that prevented me giving it five stars.

On the plus side, it is in an absolutely perfect location on Grafton Street so really central to everything.  The open areas, gallery, bar etc are absolutely lovely - very comfortable and luxurious. We had afternoon tea in the Gallery and it was fab.  We were on a bed and breakfast rate and again the service and the food in the restaurant was incredible - both the buffet and the freshly cooked breakfast ( which would be a bit expensive if you weren't on the inclusive rate!)- lots of choice for every taste.

We were in a De Luxe room ( paid extra for this ) and it was very comfortable - including nice touches like the free bottled water repalaced every day.  There were however a couple of points that were irritating.  The walls must be really thin as I could hear the television from the room next door quite clearly which was a pain.  Also the shower didnt work to start off - or raher it did work but with boiling hot water - the temperature didn't seem to work. It took a couple of visits from maintenance to fix this and to be honest we then realised that it was hardly worth the bother as the water pressure is very poor - if you're used to a power shower this is like a trickle!  So we resorted to baths in stead - there are lovely Aromatherapy Associates bath products provided.

The staff at the Westbury are all very helpful but on a final point, this was let down by the very slow check in on our arrival day.  It was absolutely manic in reception with loads of people wanting to check in and they only seemed to have two on reception and one of those was tied up with one customer for the whole time we waited.  When we eventually did get to to the top of the queue, our room was not ready - it was only 1.00pm but we'd been travelling since 5.00am so a bit tired - we eventially got into our room about 3.30 so they missed their 3.00pm guarantee. The receptionist I dealt with was however very apologetic and helpful.  I just think that with that many people waiting to check in, some additional check in desks could have been opened.

All in all the Westbury is a quality hotel and I would stay there again so would recommend ( even with these minor irritatants).",4,2013,01,02
203,Sumptuous,What can I say without grasping for superlatives. Our stay at the Westbury was the perfect antidote to a rather sterile Christmas. Opulent and luxurious with an olde world glamour but also bustling and lively - we met friends in the plush marble bar and enjoyed many glasses of prosecco. Of course this all comes at a price but for pure escapism and a real treat this is the best. Btw the service is excellent - solicitious without being unctuous. This is really Dublin at its best.,5,2012,12,31
203,Unrivalled Service & Location,"We enjoyed three superb nights at the Westbury over Christmas and will never stay anywhere else in Dublin again. Superbly located, professional and courteous service are combined with incredibly comfortable rooms and great food. Make sure you have their famous afternoon tea and just soak up the ambience and atmosphere. Dublin's best shopping, bars and restaurants are all on your doorstep. Quite simply luxurious.  ",5,2012,12,31
203,"Excellent service, nice place to stay!","I stayed in the Westin Hotel, Dublin multiple times and the best part I experience here is the service and ambience. My friends also like the prompt and professional service we receive, specifically from ""Mijo""! Hotel is located in the heart of the Dublin city, with multiple option to commune in and around.",5,2012,12,30
203,Did not live up to expectations,"I don't often stay in hotels in Dublin, and have never stayed in the Westbury before.  This was a treat to myself before Christmas, but it was a disappointment. It's a great location, but there are other Dublin hotels with better service (Shelbourne, Merrion) and I would recommend spending your money there instead! 

The check in experience was functional at best.  I had been called a few days before to ask what time I expected to arrive, and although this was only an hour before official check in time, the room still wasn't ready. Staff at check in could only repeat this, and I was offered no alternative....or hotel information....such as have coffee / what to do locally ( I knew all this but who knew from a 1 minute check in?).  After a long drive, it was a let-down.   I was then rung an hour after I had eventually checked in to the room to then tell me it  was ready - bizarre lack of communication at front desk! Rooms OK, nothing to stand -out, and the street noise is an issue even on a high floor.

 There was nowhere to eat when I returned to the hotel after a concert at 1030pm.  I was not informed of times of anything when I checked in so this was a surprise.  It was then a challenge to get room service - soup and sandwiches ( which were good!) took an hour to arrive! The following morning the restaurant was too full to accommodate all guests ( even early) - it would have been at least a half hour wait for breakfast space. 

The only staff who remotely impressed were at the concierge desk / hotel porters.  Couldn't have been more helpful with checking out and organising my car. 

I wouldn't chose to stay at the Westbury again.",3,2012,12,30
203,Good tidings of comfort and joy...,"It  really began to look a lot like Christmas the moment we  entered the Westbury hotel. My sisters and I travelled from Cork on our annual sampling of Christmas, Dublin style. Previously we have stayed in nearby well-known establishments  but now we truly believe that Christmas in Dublin has to be the Westbury. We entered an elegantly bedecked world of comfort and relaxation , luxury  and fun. We were greeted by the friendliest hotel staff in Dublin, who discreetly attended to our every need. Our room was spacious and quiet as we requested. Housekeeping was meticulous. The concierge was very efficient at all times. Residents of the Westbury step out onto busy  Grafton Street and step back into luxurious surroundings buzzing with Christmas cheer. We enjoyed every minute and we are already looking forward to our next stay. l am confident that the welcome extended to us is not just confined to the festive season. The Westbury was the highlight of Christmas 2012 for us and we would have no hesitation in recommending this charming hotel.",5,2012,12,27
203,Regular customers treatment!,"Interesting you do no t have a complaints option. We as a family visit the Westbury Dublin on a regular basis throughout the year in fact it is a venue we have frequented to celebrate graduations/ birthdays/ anniversary and to Mark our children completing secondary education with champagne . We have chosen the Westbury because of the service and treatment of your Clients in the past. However on the  night of the 23rd of December we had a meal and went into the gallery  for a drink , we were met by a waiter who informed us it was residents only! Please note the gallery bar was not busy half the sets were vacant. There was no room for discussion we were asked to leave. I went o the reception to ask or complaints form but was told that was not available. I said we only wanted one drink and would be gone. I will not  say we will never be back as my family enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and normally excellent service and recently  have started to bring work colleagues to the west bury. However the treatment we received left a disappointment with us , so we will not hurry back. I feel a residents only with a half empty bar and abrupt staff on site does not help your hotel. Please remember we are the people who support the hotel throughout the year.",1,2012,12,27
203,Excellent Location,"We stayed for a few nights just before Christmas and were really happy with our stay.
Having requesting a nice double  room for our anniversary we were surprised to be offered a twin room on arrival, although they happily changed this for us.
The room was nice and clean with lovely toiletries.
Breakfast was wonderful and all the staff in the restaurant were fabulous.
We met friends in the bar before going out for dinner which has a lovey atmosphere. 
The best part was the location, literally just off Grafton Street.",4,2012,12,27
203,superb old world charm.....,"Stayed here several times for business trips. I get to stay in a number of different hotels over the year due to a considerable amount of work travel, but I love this hotel. After second trip was upgraded to an awesome suite, which was just bliss to return to after a gruelling day. Location, ammeneties, staff welcome and help make this a superb venue for business travel.",5,2012,12,27

203,Excellent Christmas City Break in DUBLIN!!,"Visited Dublin for the first time and stayed in the Westbury Hotel on Grafton Street!!

Absolutely loved this hotel and will certainly be returning.

Check in ran smoothly, breakfast in the restaurant was fantastic.

Top service from all hotel staff and the hotel standard was very high. The rooms were clean and very well presented. Everything needed for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.

Had a twin room on the 2nd floor, opposite the lift. Contrary to other reviews, had no issues with noise. 

The highlight of the stay was afternoon tea, very enjoyable.

The location of the hotel was perfect for access to main shops bars and restaurants. 

Have no negative comments at all about this hotel.",5,2012,12,24
203,Perfection,I have stayed in the Westbury on many occassions and have always enjoyed the experience. Recently I stayed with 2 girlfriends on the Wilde experience package and all I can say is that it was perfect. The staff were so friendly yet extremely efficient.  The meal in the Wilde restaurant was super and again the staff were excellent.  The Westbury would be my favourite place to stay in Dublin - you are right in the heart of everything.

203,superb,"arrived in Dublin for Xmas shopping and stayed at the Westbury Hotel.From the time  we pulled up outside the level of service was superb. The staff at all levels could not be more helpful, we received hot towels at reception while we booked in and our bags were transferred to our room  with minimum delay.
We will  be back for sure as I can say this is the best  hotel for service that I have stayed in.",5,2012,12,20
203,5 Star service all the way,"Had stayed here a couple of times before my recent visit and while satisfied with the place I never really appreciated it until I stayed in nearby ""5 star hotels"". Head and shoulders above any of the nearby competition, staff were pleasant and courteous in every department, particularly love the Nespresso machines in each room.
Cannot praise this hotel enough to be honest, 5 star service throughout, restaurant, bar, valet parking etc. Great job, only one hotel in Dublin for me anymore.",5,2012,12,20
203,One night shopping trip!,"If you want perfection in terms of location, atmosphere and comfort The Westbury is the place to stay. I arrived in somewhat of an irate mood due to traffic but this soon dissipated when I met the professional and friendly valet. The reception desk only added to my sense of happiness. Nothing was too difficult and I felt at last I was staying at a hotel where guests were really appreciated. It cannot be down to training alone. The place is special; helped enormously by the personnel who work there. Don't get too fixated on the type of room you book....just treat yourself and book whatever is available!",5,2012,12,20
203,"5 star hotel, 5 star service in a 5 star location.","Got a wee bit lost trying to find the hotel, but a quick phone call to the hotel the kind receptionist stayed on the phone and guided me to the premisses (far better than any sat nav). Upon arrival, the valet service were quick to help us with our bags and whisk our car away to a secure location. The foyer of this fine establishment gave us a superb first impression, fabulous decor filled with the beautiful fragrance of Jo Malone candles filled the calm wonderful atmosphere. With the numerous amount of staff behind the reception desk, it was within no time that the check in was completed with the help of a very professional girl, and we were on our way to our room on the 5'th floor. 
The room was filled with every detail necessary to make our stay as comfortable as possible. 
The purpose of our stay was to attend a concert in the nearby Olympia theatre. The hotels location is smack bang in the heart of the city, with Ireland's biggest shopping street right outside the door, we made the decision even before we left that we will definitely be back. Thank you Westbury. ",5,2012,12,18

Bad service , miserable staff cold athmosphere.

Only went second time as we were promised an improvement, lunch is 160 Euro per head this includes cheap fizz 1 glass or if you are lucky a top up , a freezing dining room , luke warm food in tiny portions, santa with cheap presents, bored pianist NEVER EVER AGAIN in at 12.30 home at 3pm 500 Euro down with wine etc taxi

was  just perfect....staff were friendly, the location could not have been better....we had a car and the receptionist gave us hot towels on arrival and bottled on water before we headed home.....just the level of detail staff go to make sure you want to come back again.

Food in the main restaurant was excellent...the vegetarian option was unusual and first class
for flavour and taste...breakfast too was excellent and had a great selection including soya milk!

What started as a restful break changed into a shopping spree with the local shops and I was very glad to return to the Westbury to recover for the next days events....just want to make  another trip
Soon",5,2012,12,18
203,Just Perfect !,"Fantastic location, fantastic hotel, welcoming staff and a touch of class. This hotel has it all, and to experience it at its best, take a trip there over the Christmas holidays . It was an ideal location for my wife and I to indulge in a spot of shopping intertwined with some alcohol sampling !! It's location just off Grafton Street is ideal for this. You pay a little more for a nights stay here but the convenience is well worth it. For breakfast I would recommend Bewleys, which is about a three minute walk away, and have the big breakfast, it'll sort any ills from the night before. The only negative I would have, and it's only a small annoyance, was the music in the Marble Bar in the hotel, it was woeful. It didnt suit the style of the hotel, pure electronic elevator music, after a while we took our drinks and sat outside the bar in the open lounge area, bit of people watching and peace and quiet. Just thought the perfect music would have been either classical or seeing as it was Christmas,  a few Christmas songs would have been great and atmospheric !! Overall , a great hotel ! Taxi to and from Heuston train station is about ‚Ç¨10, takes 15 min.",5,2012,12,18
203,Spend your money elsewhere,"Arrived at the Westbury with high expectations. There were two tables of us. The restaurant was by no means extremely busy. Where do I start? Poor service by waiters that didn't seem to have a clue. Left food at my table then had to pick it up again as it was for our other table. Service was incredibly slow, in fact so slow that we had to leave before getting our last round of drinks. Sat most of the night with an empty glass even though refreshments were provided for. Some of our wine was given to another table. Main course was cold as was it for some of my friends. Will not be going back or recommending to anyone.",2,2012,12,17
203,Best for city Shopping,"Hotel I can not fault except for one item charge for car parking when you stay at the hotel a small thing but something that hate no matter where I stay.
The other point is if you are driving to the hotel make sure you know the road system",5,2012,12,15
203,Spoilt for service and surroundings,"We recently held a small event for a group of friends in The Westbury and I can say we were truly blown away.  The help in simply organising the booking was spot on, and the boardroom which was transformed into a function room for our party of people, simply amazing.
If you wanted to have a function somewhere with Hollywood class, helpful staff, warm reception, city centre location I can say I highly recommend here. 
Our guest of honour was so delighted at the fuss and splendor put on (over and above the formal agreement I might add) that it really made the event special.
Merry Christmas Westbury Staff, you deserve to be on the 'Nice' List this Christmas.",5,2012,12,14
203,excellent hotel,"The Westbury Hotel was excellent in every way. Stayed there just for one night and enjoyed the ambiance, the beautiful room and facilities . The staff were extremely pleasant,helpful and friendly. I would definitely stay there again.",5,2012,12,14
203,Excellent customer service,"I was in Dublin on a business trip recently. I love the Westbury because of the service, location and ambiance of the hotel. However, I had a neighbor who was making a lot of noise day and night and it was very hard for me to work and sleep. I complained and the staff had the other guest quieten down. When they continued to make noise, the staff proactively moved me to a nicer room in a quieter part of the hotel. They dealt with the situation swiftly and professionally.  I plan to stay at this hotel every time I return to Dublin and recommend it highly.",5,2012,12,13
203,Very good service,"Besides beeing a very nice hotel, good location in the center of the city and big rooms, the service in high standard.
The service was the best, they provided you with all the help, and they where prompt with every request. They even cam and said good night with chokolate - i thnik if you wanted to they could read you a good night story.
The rooms where big and spacius, with nice funiture and decorations - no problems Falling a sleep.
The location is in the middel of the city with transportation posibbilities just close by.
All in all thumbs up.",4,2012,12,13
203,As good as it gets,"Myself and my wife stay here whenever we both are out in Dublin city for an evening - typically during the december madness. It's a high point of the season. The minute you step inside you feel like you are someplace special. The concerns of the outside world disappear. It's warm, welcoming, and special.

Treat yourself - The Westbury is a class act.",5,2012,12,12
203,A treat,"Stayed at the Westbury one night last week and it was a treat, it was beautiful in every way, location, clean, good atmosphere, bedrooms, food and service. There was a coffee machine in my bedroom and it made beautiful coffee so much so that I bought one for myself. I would have no problem recommmending this hotel to anybody. Thanks to all the staff at the Westbury.",5,2012,12,12
203,Lovely Christmas Treat,"Stayed in the Westbury to soak up the Christmas atmosphere in Dublin.  This hotel is in a great location, just off the lovely shopping area of Grafton Street.  From the time you pull up outside the door and they take your car from you to park, to having your car brought back to you at checkout, the service is top class.  The staff make you feel that you and your stay at the hotel is important to them and they go out of their way to assist you.  They are very  polite, helpful and always available to assist you.  Nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are tastefully decorated to a very high standard.  Would highly recommend a stay here.",5,2012,12,11
203,"Great location, lovely hotel!","I stayed at the Westbury Hotel in early November for a business trip.  The staff was lovely and extremely helpful from the moment I walked in.  The rooms were fairly big and updated.  I was especially excited to find that there was an outlet that I could use to plug in my US power cords.  Really handy since I only brought one adapter but had multiple electronics.  The location of the Westbury is fantastic.  It's just off of Grafton Street (lots of shopping!) and there are tons of great pubs and restaurants nearby.  Don't miss a stop at McDaid's which is just outside the front door.  At the end of my trip, I realized I had left an item in the closet.  I immediately emailed and called the hotel from the airport and let them know.  They had already found it and were able to set it aside for one of my colleagues to pick up.  Just another reason I left as a happy guest.",5,2012,12,10
203,The Westbury Hotel,"I stayed one night in the Westbury Hotel in Dublin. The room was spacious and comfortable (complimentary wi-fi a definite plus) and I loved the classy toileteries provided in the bathroom. Service was efficient, polite and helpful; I had afternoon tea in the lobby and I think the scones with clotted cream and jam are probably a good enough reason to come back to this hotel! Breakfast was plentiful with a lot of choice and excellent service. Add this to the hop, skip and jump distance from Grafton Street shopping and Trinity College for sightseeing and it's a truly winning combination. The only downside was some noisy trucks in the very early morning.",5,2012,12,10
203,afternoon tea,"having be made a gift of afternoon tea by a friend myself and friend and two of our daughters set of to experience afternoon tea in the Westbury Grafton St. On arrival we where met by very pleasant waitress who explained all and took our order,Tea arrived promptly But not so the sandwich's and scones (15mins later). Tea was cold by time they arrived so we  ordered more tea. we had eaten the sandwich's and half the scones and pastry's  by time tea arrived. The idea of afternoon tea is to enjoy an relaxing enjoyable afternoon tea with friends or family,This i am afraid was not the case with  our experience. Much to expensive  for the service received.We would not recommend as a treat, unless you like waiting around  and having to ask for everything again and again.  : (   Not a happy visitor )",4,2012,12,09
203,Good stay,"The best part of the hotel is its location. Most part of the city was easily reachable from here. Surrounded by large number of pubs and restaurants, make the stay in Dublin more active. The room was good. The service was good. In fact at time they were over servicing. 
A few points that was found missing. A quick guide by their housekeeping in what is where in room can help. For example it took lot of time to find out where coffee and tea were kept. It took sometime to locate switches. Breakfast was good. I did not take lunch or dinner. 
There listening and executing orders looks poor. The only lunch that I had from them, I ordered for a vegetable sandwich where I did not wanted any cheese. But I was served with thick layer of cheese. When I pointed out, they agreed to change and brought me a sandwich that did not have cheese but had eggs. I did not had time to get into further I just ate that.
Over all it was good experience, but would definitely like to explore better options.",4,2012,12,09
203,A lovely weekend away in the Westbury,"The Westbury is one of my favourite hotels and makes a perfect venue for a weekend in Dublin (which is also a great weekend destination).   The location, just off Grafton Street  is perfect, right at the centre of Dublin life.   The rooms are comfortable, staff friendly and efficient and the upstairs lounge and bar is perfect for people watching, whether in a group or if travelling alone.   If you are feeling lazy and just want to stay in the hotel the Wilde restaurant is a great place to eat.   I am already planning my next stay at the Westbury.",5,2012,12,09
203,Extraordinary luxury & comfort for superb value,"The Westbury Charms you with a sense of opulent luxury that few places can achieve. From the smiling valet who whisks your motor away to the newly refurbished cocktail bar, it exudes warmth, welcome and comfort. The service is impeccable, the food delicious and the rooms are sumptuous. Thre is an underlying feeling that someone is only an arm's length away to assist you. Despite it's central location it feels like you are in another world, like a 5star in Killarmey or Kilkenny would. The lobby is a wonderful spot to meet a friend or to simply spend a little time and watch the world go by. Even for a short stay in Dublin there is nowhere to compare for value and unequalled hospitality.",5,2012,12,07
203,Outstanding comfort and service,"Just returned from a wonderful two  night stay at the Westbury .The outstanding hospitality and service we enjoyed will remain with us for many years. They do some very good weekend packages , particularly if you include a Sunday night

It is truly a five star hotel and the suites are well worth the extra premium. 

Jedward were apparently in residence whilst we were there (they seemed to be very pleasant young men) but I cannot believe that they were looked after any better than us ordinary guests.

The front desk were friendly, efficient and nothing was too much trouble for them.

The concierge staff were helpful and courteous-we had forgotten to bring our theatre tickets with us and they spent a lot of time cheerfully sorting the problem out. 

The restaurant is a beautiful room , the food was great and the service friendly and attentive.

The luxury suites truly are luxurious , spacious and very quiet.

I would not advise anyone to stay anywhere else in Dublin",5,2012,12,06
203,UNDERSTATED LUXURY IN TOP LOCATION,"Beginning with a reception greeting that makes one feel a member of the family to the welcoming and lovingly appointed guest rooms, this is a hotel of character and quality in a perfect location just steps from pedestrian friendly Grafton Street.  Muted browns and golds in very quiet moderately sized rooms include all the appointments and ample space to relax that is expected in a hotel of high quality.  Comfortable beds, bright baths, plenty of storage space.  Caring management and dedicated staff keeps the Westbury near the top of Dublin hotels.  Outside the hotel almost all of the delights of Dublin are within easy walking distance.  As with most hotels, meals, such as breakfast, are pricey, so go around the corner to venerable Bewley's Oriental Cafe for breakfast in 19th Century ambience and enjoy home made pastries.",5,2012,12,05
203,Very nice property in Dublin,"Beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin, highly recommended! The staff was very efficient and helpful, the F&B outlets serve excellent food and the rooms offer great comfort.
This hotel is perfect for any type stay.",5,2012,12,05
203,Hard to beat The Westbury,"I have stayed here on several occasions - with friends and family and it has never failed to dissapoint.  From the moment you arrive, the staff make you feel like you are their only guest.  This personalised service makes all the difference.  The rooms are of a high standard and the expresso machine is a lovely touch.  The bar is just the place to return to after dinner - relaxing but with a nice buzz.  It is a pity however, that the continental breakfast that used to be inluded and provided in the mezzaine is no longer available.  This really was the finsihing touch to a stay here.  I never hesitate in reccomending The Westbury",5,2012,12,05
203,Amazing!!,"Second time staying here, staff cant do enough for you and the hotel is out of this world.  So handy for shopping and a cocktail in the bar is a must! Would definately recommend for a special treat.  Got a special birthday cupcake brought to our room as my husband had told them it was my birthday.  
Highly recommended",5,2012,12,04
203,Rocky start...smooth finish,"We stayed at the Westbury in October for three nights for an early birthday celebration. After a not too long of a cab ride from the airport to the hotel, we saw that, it was perfectly located at the heart of Grafton Street and steps away from shopping, restaurants, and pubs. The location alone, made us really look forward to the rest of our stay.

Knowing that our trans-Atlantic flight was arriving at 10:00, we were hoping we would get an early check in. Unfortunately, that was not to be. We arrived to the hotel at around 11:00, much earlier that the 3:00 pm check-in, so our room was not ready. We were seated in the lobby area and treated to a complementary order of coffee while we waited. After about an hour, when our room was still not ready, we decided to take a walk and go for lunch. After about another hour, we went back and there was a large tour group checking in. Still, our room was still not ready. At about 2:30 (still earlier than the 3:00 check in time) they came and got us from the sofas in the lobby. Of course while we waiting it felt that time had stopped and the overnight flight was seriously taking its toll.

Our room was on the 6th floor (I think it was a Deluxe Room) facing the front of the hotel. It was furnished with modern decor. So modern, the bellboy who brought our luggage to the room also couldn't figure out how to turn on the lamps. :-) The carpeting was a bit stained as well, but it seemed a good sized.

That said, we didn't necessarily stay in our room too much during our short stay in Dublin. When we were there, it was very comfortable. As I said earlier, the room was comfortably sized and we did not feel cramped at all. Also, the bed was comfortable and turn down service was provided each night. Chocolates on the first night, plus a bottle of water each evening and slippers. No noticeable noise from the street, hallways, or adjoining rooms. Free wi-fi. 

The bathroom was also a good size. Enough counter space for toiletries, good water pressure, though getting out of the shower would often cause a lot of water to drip on the floor. Just had to use an extra towel. There was tv in the bathroom, which would have been a fun touch, but it did not work. We called housekeeping and they couldn't get it to work, but said they would get it fixed. It was never fixed throughout our stay.

Breakfast was good. Lots of choices, including traditional Irish breakfast choices. Though we did not eat in the restaurant for dinner, we had drinks in the Marble Bar and in the main lounge. Service was great in those two areas and we had a great time- in fact, better than many of the pubs we went to. In particular, Judit was very pleasant and accommodating. Additionally, the doormen outside were very professional and helpful in giving directions.

All in all, we had a great trip to Dublin. We would not hesitate to recommend the Westbury. The location can't be beat.",4,2012,12,02
203,Perfect Location and Great Room,"We stayed our first two nights in Ireland at the Westbury.  The room was so clean and comfortable.  The location is amazing, right outside is Grafton Street and tons of shopping and restaurants.  Couldn't have been better.  We didn't eat at the hotel but it had a great lobby bar!  Would absolutely stay here again.",5,2012,12,02
203,Never fails to please,"This is a great hotel to stay in in Dublin. I have stayed here several times on business and it never fails to please. The service from arriving at the main entrance is excellent. Nothing is too much. The facilities are great, with a very large lounge, relaxing bar, decent coffee shop and a restaurant that is well worth a try. The rooms are always clean and well equipped. But most of all, this hotel is right in the centre of Dublin with a multitude of shops, restaurants and coffee bars only feet away from the hotel.",5,2012,12,02
203,Overnight Stay,"Recently returned from a wonderful stay at this hotel. The level of service is outstanding. A member of our party recently had a birthday and when the receptionist discovered this, upgraded their room to a suite. The managment also had a cake with ""happy birthday"" written on the plate in chocalate delivered from the kitchens accompanied by a handwritten Birthday card. Each member of staff we encountered, from housekeeping to front desk were polite and courteous. 

With regards the rooms, the beds and bedding are very comfortable. It is true that rooms facing the back of the property are facing onto a service street (Clarendon) with the occasional lorry (2-3) delivering at night but this is barely noticeable. It is the small inconvience that's inevitable with such a central location. In fact if you sleep with the air con on you won't hear anything. Each room has a nespresso machine with 3 different coffees to chose from as well as tea. The turn down service unexpectantly cleans the room each evening, replenishes bathroom towels and provides a free bottle of water.

We dined in both cafe Novo and Wilde and again it is hard to find fault with either of these. Food was served quickly and the menu had a good selection with excellent waiting staff. I particularly appreciate the late opening of cafe novo as it's nice to have somewhere to get hot food in the early hours of the morning after a night out. The lobby is luxurious and with Christmas decorations and an open fire, having afternoon tea here is an experience in itself. Given the location there is a great buzz from surrounding shops, bars and restaurants. SABA restaurant is next door and I would recommend this wholeheartedly. 

With regards location, The Westbury occupies one of the best in Dublin. If you are new to the city you won't be disappointed. It's front entrance leads onto the main shopping street which is pedestrianised. There is a taxi rank at the front door and the Gaiety theatre is 2 minutes walk. It's probably best to have sat nav if you are arriving by car as it is difficult to navigate city centre one way streets without prior knowledge. I think the hotel should consider reducing its parking fees for guests as 20 euros/night is slightly steep for residents even though parking is at a premium in this area. A nearby hotel charges 10 euros/night.

All in all this truly is a five star hotel with regards facilities staff and loaction. I have seen other reviews criticising service prior to my stay and can only conclude that these were individual circumstances. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again mainly because of the service we received from friendly staff.",5,2012,12,01
203,One night treat away,I love staying at this hotel because it's close to everything. When I am shopping I can nip back when the hands are full of bags. The only thing I miss is a pool but you can't have everything. You are made feel welcome from the minute you arrive at the front door. Thank you to all the staff,5,2012,12,01
203,Exemplary customer service,"Due to bad weather and motorway chaos, I missed the last flight to Dublin and so unfortunately never got to the Westbury for a weekend stay. However, the professional but friendly way they dealt with my cancellation bodes well for their customer service. Just brilliant. Looking forward to a visit soon.",5,2012,12,01
203,Fantastic experience,"Spent a night in the westbury on a business trip. Wonderful location, great staff, fantastic hotel. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will come again. Held several meetings there too and it worked out well",5,2012,11,30
203,"Great location, not the best service.","Location just off Grafton street is unbeatable. The only good hotel in Dublin with perfect location.

Checkin was fast and professional, the room they gave us first was disappointing with noise from the street disturbing our sleep.

Asked for a new room and got a better one the second night. 

Ordered room service and was told it would take 25 minutes to deliver. After 45 minutes wait without any food arriving I called again and they couldnt find my order. Decided to go out for dinner instead. 

All in all average experience and compared to other Dublin hotels I stayed at probably above average.",3,2012,11,30
203,"Excellent experience, great hotel","Short stay for a business trip but really enjoyed the stay. Its very central for seeing Dublin city, rooms were very well maintained with excellent services. And food in the restaurant was fantastic considering the set price menu for 2 courses was only for 29 euro. Finally the service was a very high standard. Only downside is parking is very tight due to small car park, but is responsible price to the location.",5,2012,11,29
203,I expect more from a Five Star,"We stayed here for 2 nights. We arrived at around 10pm on a Friday night. We were initially checked into Room 312, but when we arrived at the room (our card keys did open the door), we discovered the room was already occupied.
Again visited the Reception desk and explained the situation to the disbelieving member of staff. Eventually we were assigned to Room 355. It hadn't been explained to us that this was one of 2 inter-connecting rooms, but this shouldn't have been a problem. However shortly after 3am, we were woken by a loud conversation in the next-door room 353. Despite our best efforts, we were unable to get back to sleep. The conversation was so clear, the couple may as well have been sitting on the end of our bed! 
I called the reception desk to ask them if they could have a word with the occupants. Within minutes, we could hear a staff member's knocks on the door of Room 353 being ignored, for several minutes. Then, we heard their room telephone, and their reaction was to laugh loudly. 
When we went down for breakfast at 9am, they were still talking. 

After breakfast, I asked if we could change rooms. Initially we were told to return again at 1pm and they would check what they had available. I had to insist that they reserved a room for us that they knew would become available later. I didn't want to return and be told that all rooms were now already occupied.

Perhaps an hour later, we had a telephone call (to Room 355) apologising but asking if we would move as they needed the room for a family who had requested connecting rooms. I had to explain that we had already asked to change rooms anyway, so this was not a problem as far as we were concerned. 

Eventually, we moved rooms, and the chap who showed us to our new room (504) failed to return with the new keycards as promised. 

504 had a view to the front of the hotel which was better, rather than 355 which overlooked rooftops and rubbish bins. 

Breakfast at Wildes was a disappointment. The saltiest bacon and most stodgy scrambled eggs ever! I saw that the fresh apple juice was being poured from a carton. 
For ‚Ç¨14-18 per person, it should have been better. 

The 2 bedrooms we had were exceptionally small and the bathroom was tiny! The usual bathrobes, slippers, toiletries, iron and nespresso machine facilities were available. 
Don't expect to fit your laptop in the safe, again, it's miniature sized. 

The 2 lifts also seemed exceptionally slow. 

The positives: 
The location is perfect for Grafton Street and the city centre. 
The concierge and valet were charming.
Individual staff members were all very friendly. However, they didn't seem to communicate with each other and we found ourselves having the same conversations again with different people. 

The negatives: 
For the rates charged, I would expect that if I'm going to find myself in a tiny bedroom, then at least it will be adequately sound proofed so that one can actually get some sleep. 
I also think that there is much room for improvement regarding the standard of food served at breakfast. 
There isn't a great deal of seating in the lobby area to just sit while waiting to be joined by others. It seemed like every available space has been utilised to make money, whether from the afternoon teas, or restaurants or cafes etc. 
Poor value for money.
Once you look past the glitz and bling of five star, the basics let it down- guests want to be able to get a good night's sleep and have an enjoyable breakfast. 

We realise that it's not the fault of individual staff members if some guests are excessively noisey, but one would expect better sound proofing. We slept perfectly in the second room by the way.",3,2012,11,26
203,Great location and still got it!,"The hotel enjoys one of the finest locations in Dublin. Rooms are excellent, staff are friendly and if you shop around the travel websites you can get great deals which are better than what they charge on thier website. 

The breakfast in the hotel is expensive, they have a cafe on the ground floor which never really impressed me the two times I was there, however for a great stay in one of the best locations in Dublin you cannot go wrong with the Westbury.",5,2012,11,25
203,Beatiful Hotel for a Honeymoon,"My husband and I have never traveled to Ireland, so we decided the best time to do so would be our honeymoon. We wanted to splurge a bit, since it was our honeymoon, and we were not disappointed. The room was incredible and the staff were superb. We had room service delivered one night and the strawberry ice cream was the best I've ever had. We also dined at the Wild restaurant, while a little pricey, it was excellent! The front desk had some of the nicest and most helpful staff I've ever ran into. We are hoping to be able to return to Dublin next year, hopefully we'll be able to stay a couple of nights at the Westbury.",5,2012,11,25
203,Faultless,Not my preferred style - old british traditional - but they do it so well! My stay was absolutely fantastic. they pay attention to every single detail so the stay is comfortable and pampering. The location is excellent so are the facilities. Truly enjoyed it and would stay here again if visiting Dublin. Is perhaps on the expensive side - particularly considering how competitive other places are pricing themselves in this time of crisis.,5,2012,11,24
203,"Location,location","The Westbury is blessed with two major assets, the first is its staff, all of whom were friendly and helpful and the second is location. It is central and located within a great shopping precinct. Our room was large with average quality appointments but the view was across a concrete roof top. Was it a comfortable stay? Yes. The bed was great, large TV and the free wifi was a big bonus. Cannot comment on the food or food service as we opted not to eat at the hotel because there are plenty of food choices on the door step. We would stay again, based purely upon the staff and the location.
",3,2012,11,24
203,Beautiful hotel but service is poor,"First let me say that the hotel itself is beautiful. The room was gorgeous and we had a lovely view of Grafton Street.
We arrived early from our flight and checked in. They took our luggage but as they were fully booked the night before our room was not available. I had no problem with that as official check in time is 3pm. At 3:10pm we arrived back and our room was still not ready. I was getting annoyed and all that they could say was sorry but it will be definitely ready in 20mins. So we went to the bar to get a drink but it was full so so went elsewhere for a drink and we returned 30mins later and our room was still not ready. 
I asked to see the manager and all he could do was say sorry. I explained that I had no intention of going back and forth from the hotel trying to see if the room was ready and that they had our phone number and they should have called us. Eventually we got our room which as I have said was beautiful.
The concierge was great in getting us into a nice restaurant with short notice.
We returned to room after dinner to find a cupcake and a welcome letter for someone who we did not know.
Next morning, we arrived to breakfast and joined the queue only to be told after awhile that they were full. They said this always happens on a Sunday morning. Another guest suggested that they inform guests of this in the future. After further discussion we told that they had a cafe downstairs offering the same breakfast. Why we were not told this at the start I do not know. Later we met a lady going back to her room as she could not be seated for breakfast - none of the staff had told her about the cafe.
I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and this is not 5 star quality. 
The room was great but the service was very poor. It is the little things that count and on that they failed miserably.
We will not be returning.",3,2012,11,19
203,Room for improvement,"On first impressions this hotel is fantastic, the service at check in was great and the lobby is beautiful, we stayed for one night for a birthday celebration. I will break down the review into positive and negative points:

Positive

Location- you can't get much better, in a fantastic part of town with easy access to the great shops and numerous lovely restaurants.
Service- generally very good with a few exceptions which you will see in the paragraph below! 
Food - we had breakfast and afternoon tea and the hotel both of which were great! I would definitely recommend the champagne afternoon tea after a hard days shopping. 
Bar - is beautiful with a great cocktail menu and great staff. 

Negatives

Room - the website is misleading! Our room was very small with a tiny bathroom and no view. The worst past about it was that the room was immediately outside of the lift on the 2nd floor. At first I didn't see this as a problem until 3am when the pubs and clubs closed and we were woken every 5 minutes! 
Breakfast- we arrived for breakfast at 10am ahead of the 10.30 deadline. Unfortunately there were no tables and we were asked to wait for a table and have a coffee in the lobby. 30 minutes later we still had no table and had also been presented with a costly bill for the pot of coffee that should have been included in our breakfast rate! My sister complained to a very polite member of staff who asked for assistance from her manager who didn't even have the decency to come over and see us, rather leaving the poor waitress to pass the message on that we had to pay for the coffee as it was a different department to the restaurant! I found this unacceptable. 

In summary this hotel is in a great location and has a lovely feel about it, however we would think twice before recommending to our friends.",3,2012,11,19
203,more interested in non resident business,"If staying here opt for no breakfast option. Waited a whole hour for breakfast to be served to us. Arrived at restaurant at 10:15 am. Eventually seated at 11:00am and food arrived at 11:30. Manager Niamh apologised and promised us a free cocktail before dinner that night - never happened. Should have just went to Bewleys or had a breakfast role from Centra!!!!!

Ate dinner here on 2nd night. Was OK but service poor. Rushed to get our order with no  explanation as to what was on the menu! Poor for 5 star. Got a cheese plate for dessert and think one of them was Calvita - I Asked the with and he said it was and that a ‚Ç¨10 glass of Malbec would go well with it!!!! The bill totalled ‚Ç¨110 - not good enough!!! Stayed in room 607 which was amazing. 

Every time when looking for a table for a coffee / glass of water/ place to sit i was told everywhere was reserved and not available for paying guests. Think illtry the Shelbourne or Merrion next time  real 5 star hotels!",1,2012,11,17
203,How I love the Irish People and this wonderful Hotel,"This was a special birthday so my husband decided we would spend three days in Dublin to catch the sights and do some shopping.
This hotel is simply perfect. Because they knew it was my birthday our suite was ready very early in the day.We were staying with friends and they were in a basic room. The check in staff booked us all in leaving us the whole day to sight see.Every single person we encountered could not
have been more helpful. If you happened to sit in the wonderful lounge admiring their exotic display of orchids, within two minutes staff were asking if you needed anything and if you just wanted to sit, were so polite and helpful.The Irish People are known to be friendly but the staff here exceed even this. The general manager was made aware it was my birthday. I had a lovely card and some lovely gifts from him. The lounge staff also sent me a gift to the suite because they asked why we were drinking champagne.. I LOVE everything about the place.Our flight was later in the day. They were happy to look after our luggage and allowed us an extra couple of hours to check out.It was perfect from beginning to end. I wish all hotels across the world was as good as this one. Well Done!!",5,2012,11,17
203,Great place to stay,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Westbury.  The staff were wonderful from our arrival through our checkout.  We arrived well in advance of the check-in time, but they could not have been more helpful in storing our bags and directing us to a local eatery for lunch.  

The room itself was very nice, and had the most comfortable bed of our time in Ireland.

I also have to give a special note of thanks to Tommie, on the Bellman's staff, who went above and beyond the call of duty to assist us.  This was my first time driving on the other side of the road, and finding the carpark for the hotel was a bit of a challenge.  We ended up parking two blocks from the hotel and arriving on foot.  Rather than give us directions, Tommie walked with us to our car, and drove with us back to the hotel.  Along the way, he gave us tips on which pubs to try and places to have dinner.  This was truly remarkable service!",5,2012,11,16
203,A very nice hotel,"Last week our Association had its Annual general Meeting at the hotel.  
The Westbury felt more like a private hotel and the service was impeccable and the general standards of the hotel outstanding.
The two meeting rooms we reserved one for the Board 10 persons and the other for the members 30 were perfect for our needs.
All the Irish people we met were most helpful and our members felt that Dublin and the Westbury hotel was the perfect venue for our meeting.

203,Excellent Location!!,"Great service with friendly helpful staff.  The room was comfy and very clean.  Go out the front door and start shopping on Grafton St.  It's all good!!!  We needed some help navigating the remainder of our trip in Ireland as we had decided to give the car back.  The gentleman at the consierge, Edward, was so helpful and got us the best means of transportation to each of our next stops.  He was a God send for us!!  Thanks Edward!!",5,2012,11,13
203,Nice central hotel,"This is a lovely hotel. The rooms are what one would expect at a 5 star. Indeed, it is far superior to the Merrion Hotel which was very disappointing. I had two bugbears however. One was the fact that after a night out, we were interrogated by a bouncer guarding the door asking to see our room passes. It felt like we were underage teenagers looking to gain entry to a nightclub! The second issue was the lack of noise insulation from the next room. Whilst the neighbours were not loud in the least, when I was in the bathroom, I could hear every word of a telephone conversation next door. Noise insulation is the least I would expect of any hotel, never mind a 5 star one. However, I would stay here again.",4,2012,11,12
203,Great location,"Won a prize of a night in the Westbury and stayed on the Bank Holiday Monday after the marathon.

The hotel is really central for shopping etc and they have improved the car park arrangement since the last time we stayed there a few years ago.

Grafton St is practically outside the front door which is convenient for men who tire of shopping!

The hotel has nice reception areas, but the rooms are a little dated. Noise can be a problem but in fairness this came from outside the hotel rather than inside, and you are in the city centre.

We had a family room with two queen beds and the room size was adequate. We opted to have breakfast in the room and it arrived on time with everything we had ordered.

We also strolled down to Trinity College to see the Book of Kells etc and the receptionist confirmed that we could stay parked after checkout which was generous considering the cost of city centre parking.

Overall, I couldnt fault this hotel - in that it ticked most of the boxes as expected. However it did feel like a hotel in a chain rather than a smaller individual boutique type.",4,2012,11,10
203,Fabulous hotel with five star staff,We stayed for one night in one of the westbury's gorgeous suites and from the time we checked in we found the service and staff to be really helpful and attentative.  There were lots of nice little touches that made out stay feel unique like no other hotel we have stayed in in the past.  The beds are extremely comfortable and love the chocolates on the pillow ;-),5,2012,11,10
203,Amazing,"We are from the uk but met our NY friends at the Westbury just for one night however, we would happily have moved in . It is a beautiful, friendly , professional, immaculately clean and totally central to shops and bars . Thank you to everyone involved x",5,2012,11,10
203,Lost a little of its sparkle for us this time.,"This was our third stay at the Westbury Hotel, we stayed for three nights at the end of October for my husbands birthday and to visit family. We splashed out and booked one of the four poster suites which we feel was well worth the extra, a beautiful room overlooking Grafton street. Not too noisy at all. The room was very clean and was made up beautifully everyday and turn down service was lovely too. I would say that some furnishings were a tiny bit tired in places and was only a little disappointed with the bathroom, it was huge, plenty big enough for a separate shower but there wasn't one, the bath was very long though but again looking a bit tired, needed re sealing round the edges. We had breakfast in our rooms two out of the three mornings and we thought was reasonable forthw price, could of been hotter the first day but was lovely and hot the second day, tea was lovely. We were a little disappointed to find the marble bar closed during our visit,it was being refurbished I think so drinks were all served in the Gallery lounge which is beautiful to sit in, the piano was a nice touch too. The down sides were the service, took quite a while to get a drink and I ordered a Bellini and got brought out an alternative of passion fruit and prosecco in a champagne glass for ‚Ç¨15! As they had run out of peach pur√©e. Another gripe would be the sitting down situation for tea in the gallery, one afternoon my husband and myself returned from shopping and went straight into the lounge and asked to be seated only to be plonked on the corridor side of the lounge despite there being plenty of sofas free, we were told they were reserved which when you're paying to stay in a 5 start hotel you at least expect to be able to sit down comfortably in their lounge area especially as the bar was closed. We returned to our room and phoned down and asked for a sofa table and was told they had one for us so found it all a but confusing. On the one occasion we did have to call down to maintenance regarding the broken tv in the bathroom ( I nice touch we thought ) someone was sent up within minutes and had it fixed straight away so that was great. Front desk were very polite and helpful as we're the staff in Cafe novo where we had a Mel one night, delicious steak and chips and nice bottle of wine however they had run out of the starte we chose. All in all we would return to the Westbury as its so conveniently placed for us on our trips to Dublin but this time we felt it had just lost a little of that sparkle it had on previous visits.",4,2012,11,10
203,elegant perfection,Perfect location. Perfect service. Beautiful rooms. Great food and drink. Eleganat interrior. Faultless IT and business support. Expensive but worth every penny. Best hotel I have ever stopped in.I was in Dublin for business but took the family along and they loved it.,5,2012,11,10
203,Excellent hotel in heart of city,"Stayed for 2 nights at the Westbury for a business trip. Superb hotel, will all the luxury and amenities you would expect. The bar was recently renovated and very pleasant. Breakfast was fine and all the staff were super friendly and efficient.

Will aim to come back for a small vacation and hope to use the Westbury then. The location is perfect, Grafton street and excellent restaurants such as Saba and Marco Pierre White are 2mins walks. And two great pubs, Bruxelles and McDaids are in front of the hotel, what more do you want.",5,2012,11,09
203,Perfect location - wonderful staff,"This hotel has it all: great staff, plenty of amenities, perfect location, spacious rooms, and clean.  The area that surrounds this hotel is right where you want to be.  There are plenty of boutique shops and restaurants right outside of the hotel.  The inside is gorgeous, the rooms are great and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  This place is a home run!  The hotel has free wi-fi which runs faster than most I have used while traveling to various places in Europe (great for business).  There are typical laundry and dry cleaning services available, and an iron/board in the room.  The decor of the hotel is a mix between modern and traditional, if you are a person who doesn't like overly modern hotels - you will still love it here.  I was most surprised at how large the rooms were - I am used to something much smaller when traveling in Europe.",5,2012,11,07
203,At the centre of things,"My wife and I have just spent a most enjoyable three days at the Westbury in Dublin. We rated it as an ‚Äòexperience‚Äô rather than a break. Right in the heart of the city the vibrancy of Dublin comes through the doors with you. The main lounge is a real international melting pot where people meet for all sorts of reasons and it‚Äôs like being absorbed into another world. Accommodation, staff and food all first class although the drink prices still come as a bit of a shock to a parsimonious Scot. We are Doyle Collection fans having spent a number of great holidays at the River Lee Hotel in Cork and we hope to enjoy many more holidays at both hotels.",5,2012,11,07
203,1st class hotel brilliant location,"Stayed one night after fine days shopping on grafton st which on doorstep, lovely comfortably lounge with great atmosphere , room a little noisy with early morning deliveries , well fitted out , cooked breakfast with great selection of pastries cereals fruits everything imaginable , next time will ask for a quiet room , free wifi everywhere , ",5,2012,11,06
203,First Class Wedding Venue!,We were lucky enough to book our wedding reception here in October of this year. I cannot say enough about the effort and attention to detail the staff at the Westbury went to in order to ensure our day went so well. From start to finish the level of service was excellent. The feedback from all our guests was extremely positive and the food on the night was exceptional! Well done to all the staff at the Westbury ‚Äì 5 star all the way!,5,2012,11,06
203,Best Dublin hotel,"This was the second time that I have stayed at The Westbury and this is the only hotel that I will stay at whilst visiting Dublin. The location is great as it is in the heart of Dublin. The hotel itself is clean and modern whilst remaining plush. 

I would recommend the champagne afternoon tea in The Gallery, cocktails in The Marble Bar and dinner at The Wilde restaurant all located in the hotel itself. 

The rooms themselves are great and are maintained to a high standard.",5,2012,11,06
203,Terrific Location and Good Service,You could not ask for a better located hotel. Good service and nice decor. Rooms sometimes vary in standard. They are all good but some are better than others. I like the third floor. Great toiletries,5,2012,11,05
203,classic hotel,"third time we have stayed at the westbury and as usual it never lets you down, fantastic rooms elegant lounge great service and the best location if you are visiting the city.The cocktail bar is a little expensive but a must for a drink before you venture to temple bar!!!!",5,2012,11,05
203,"Perfect Location, Nice Hotel","The pros = great location, walking distance to everything. Great, attentive, nice staff, who help with everything. 

The place is a bit noisy, with slamming doors at all hours, and this is to be expected at a hotel in this location. Their food is actually very good and reasonably priced. All the staff at this hotel go WAY above and beyond. We liked this hotel. Nightly turndown services, breakfast included with rate. Room has iron, safe, shower/tub combination, dual vanity, carpeting. Room's temperature controls are sporadic and the room was either volcanic or a storage freezer.. I never quite got the hang of the temperature controls until I simply turned it OFF altogether. 

Free wifi in all areas. Shower is a bit funky, just a forewarning. Low pressure and very deep tub. Other guests we talked to had a difficult time getting in/out of the tub/shower. It's quite high/deep. Another fyi: the hair dryer, while included, must be used in the room vs the bathroom. This is quite strange, but common in Ireland's hotels. Women I know complained about this fact. The hotel's room provides 110/220 USA converter which is quite convenient and nice. The area is a bit noisy, but that cannot be helped because the hotel is in the middle of all shopping. the hotel's pillows in the rooms are huge and not comfortable. I had to sleep using the chair's pillows, which are small. This is not the issue of the century. 

Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,11,03
203,Excellent hotel,"This hotel was booked for us by our daughter, as a surprise for my husbands birthday at the end of Oct.  The hotels location as other people have said, is great, right in the centre, just off Grafton Street.  It's convenient for the shops, bars, Trinity College and the tour buses.  If you are catching the airport coach or bus into the city, the hotel is just a short walk if you get off at Trinity College.

Our room was lovely, bed very comfortable and the extra little touches made our stay very enjoyable.   All the staff that we came into contact with, were very helpful and extremely pleasant.

There was a slight mix up with the present that should have been left in the room for my husband as a surprise but this was quickly sorted out and the manager met with us and apologised for the errors.  

Lovely hotel, lovely people, won't hesitate to stay again!",5,2012,11,03
203,Outstanding Hotel,"My wife and I were guests at the Westbury for three nights in early October.  The staff were some of the most professional and courteous we‚Äôve ever encountered anywhere.  The rooms, lobby, and furnishings were luxurious.  The location was perfect, being central to shopping and sightseeing.   Highly recommended!",5,2012,11,01
203,"Location, location, location","The location is excellent! Right on Graffton Street, surrounded by plenty of restaurants, pubs, shops, etc. It can't get any central. 

The rooms are very comfortable and the beds are very good too. The internet in the room is fast (and it's free).

Service is good although not across all employees. Some are extremely helpful and nice, while I met a few that were not even close.",4,2012,11,01
203,Perfect location but a few poor points for 5*,"This is a beautiful 5* hotel in Dublin and if you want to go shopping or sightseeing it is in the perfect location just off Grafton Street. We stayed for a night on the way home from a trip in Europe and as we had a few things to do in Dublin we wanted something local but comfortable. We were able to get a really good price for the room. We wanted to just eat, relax and then sleep with a sleep in the next morning. The beds were really comfortable and the big tv was perfect to help us relax but unfortunately we were rudely awakened by housekeeping at 8am! I was extremely annoyed as we weren't checking out until 11am and as someone who has worked in hotels I know that housekeeping should have known we were still in the room. When checking out I complained to the receptionist who asked me ""would you like me to say something"" of course this angered me more as I thought, of course I want you to say something I want you to apologise for this and make sure this doesn't happen to someone else but to be honest she didn't have a clue what she was doing. Other than this and the dodgy cupboard door to the mini bar I was happy with the hotel and would stay there again if I got a good deal but I wouldn't pay top end for it. I walked away annoyed but I still liked the comfort and style of this hotel.",4,2012,10,31
203,Not quite 5-star standard,"The Westbury is wonderfully situated for central Dublin shopping and sightseeing but is difficult to find if you come in your own car due to the one-way traffic system. Seamless valet parking; doormen, porters, concierge and reception are superb and well up to 5* standard.

The downside of the hotel‚Äôs central position is that the bedrooms are rather small and cramped for two people and, although they are beautifully furnished and equipped, there is limited clothes storage space and a lack of surfaces in the bathrooms on which to put things. The beds are extremely comfortable.

Service in the restaurant, I‚Äôm afraid, lets the rest of the hotel down: the staff are mainly young Eastern European girls who are inexperienced and badly trained. Despite their constant reassurances that there is ‚Äúno problem‚Äù, there clearly is a problem as tables are left uncleared of dirty dishes and meals are punctuated by the crash of smashing crockery as trays are dropped through careless and inexperienced handling. If only the dining room staff were as professional as the porters a meal would be a pleasurable experience.

The Westbury also suffers from the problem found in some other central Dublin 5* hotels: an influx of non-residents at lunchtime often means that residents cannot obtain a table in the lounge for a light lunch. Such was the case on the day of our arrival and we were diverted to a bistro-type restaurant on the ground floor which was unimpressive. For a country which we are told is in acute economic distress, it is heartening to see how many clerks and shop assistants can afford to take their lunch in 5* hotels.

It is a very comfortable and pleasant hotel in many ways but I fear that the nice little touches, like hot towels on arrival and free bottled water on departure, do not make up for its deficiencies.",4,2012,10,31
203,"Excellent Location, Excellent Accommodations","We spent our last two nights in Dublin at the Westbury.  The room was spacious, comfortable and even included an espresso machine.  The location can not be beat (close to Trinity College and Grafton Street).  There was an error with my breakfast the first day, and the staff made sure to correct the mistake and upgraded our afternoon tea (which is fantastic).  Mistakes can happen, and since it was quickly acknowledged and corrected, it did not alter my opinion of the hotel.  The staff was very courteous and helpful.  I would recommend this place to my family and friends.",5,2012,10,30
203,Central and luxury!,"We couldn't have had a better stay. The Westbury is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The staff were fantastic and attended to every detail. The hotel and rooms were modern, luxurious, roomy and located in possibly the best location in Dublin. Every room has a Nespresso machine for the coffee lovers and the furnishings, turndown service and breakfast are all fantastic. Highly recommended!",5,2012,10,30
203,Awesome hotel once you find it.,"The room was spacious and comfortable, the location was central, and the staff was amazingly nice. I felt like I needed to dress up to walk through the lobby. Right in the heart of city center. Tons of stuff within 10 minutes walk. There are always taxis out front if you prefer. The hotel was fantastic and the staff was friendly. The location is right in Dublin's City Center which makes it easy to find shopping, food, and historical locations. It is a bit difficult to find when walking. If you're coming from the Trinity College bus stop, keep walking in the direction the bus was going, to the left of the tourism center, then keep looking right down the side streets of Grafton. The only other thing I would say is that the guests of the hotel are dressed rather nicely. My wife and I got a few sideways looks from other guests after our long trip and our hour-or-so walk trying to locate it.",4,2012,10,30
203,Subjective service,"My husband and I booked this hotel for its accomodations and central location.  The facility itself is beautiful and the location cannot be beat.  Unfortunately, we had a disappointing experience with the level of service we received.

Location: This is the hotel's best quality.  It is within walking distance to every major sight in Dublin and has shops, pubs, a Starbucks, and restaurants just steps from its entrance.  

Check In: I requested an early check in via email two months prior to arrival with details around when we would be arriving and was told they would do everything to accommodate this.  We arrived 1 and a half hours prior to check in time and the receptionist informed us our room was not ready, nor was he sure when it would be.  I suggested we come back at 3PM the check in time he said that should be ok.  It felt odd I had to suggest the solution of when we should come back and after so much advance notice of us checking in early that we didn't have a room, but I brushed this off as they held our luggage and we were excited to be there.  When we got back at the check in time, we went to the same individual and a room was ready.  He gave us a 30 second cursory explanation of the hotel and told us to move to the end of the counter and someone would grab our luggage for us.  As I looked down the counter at several other individuals checking in, they were given wet cloths, I could overhear a full explanation of the hotel facilities and where things were located and a much more thorough welcome. It was odd, really, and I started to question why we weren't given the same level of service they were.  Again, I brushed it off as I was excited to be there and wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.  We went down to the end of the counter to get our luggage.  After 10 minutes and looking down the counter at 4 receptionists in view with no guests to attend to, and 2 hotel staff members pass us without acknowledging us or asking if we needed help, my husband went back to the man who checked us in and asked if he could get our luggage so we could get to our room.  We were frustrated at this point.

Rooms: The room is a nice size for European standards and was very clean.  We had plenty of space with our three plus suitcases and found it to be comfortable, having a great night sleep each night, no noise to be heard except for construction each morning a few rooms down (this did not disrupt our sleep).  The shower was great with good water pressure but beware the water does go all over the floor so put several towels down before entering.  We were pleasantly surprised by the turndown service at night - with chocolates on the bed, slippers and a glass of The TV would not turn on easily, and the first night we called for someone to help us with it.  The individual my husband called said someone would be right up to our room, but no one came.  No one came the next day, and the one time I was able to turn it on it took us about 10 minutes to turn it off.  While attempting to turn it off I called the front desk and the operator but the phone rang and rang with no one answering.  We were about to just leave but finally my husband figured it out.  Needless to say, we couldn't use it for the duration of our three night stay - I think the controller needed batteries which seems to be something others have had issues with as well.

Service: The second night as my husband and I were coming back from our night out, as we approached the door the bellman approached us and blocked the door, asking for us to show him a room key.  I was stunned.  At this time I should mention we are in our 20s and were among the youngest we saw staying at this hotel.  I asked him why and he just said he needed to see it before he could let us go in.  We pulled out our card and he let us in, and as I looked behind us there was another group coming in.  My husband and I waited to see if this group was asked to show their card and they were not.  They were greeted with a smile and walked right by.  This group of individuals was in their 40s.  There was no difference between us and this group other than us being younger.  

When I called the front desk and explained what happened, I was told a manager would contact me immediately.  The phone rang several minutes later and when I picked it up, the person had hung up.  I expected them to call back, but no one called or got ahold of us for the remainder of our stay. 

As my husband and I connected the dots, we realized we were treated differently than other guests throughout our stay.  Not getting eye contact, smiles, and getting eyed for what we were wearing made us both feel we were not welcome, especially when we noticed the attention older guests or guests on business were given.  Such a shame as this is truly a beautiful facility and anyone who is willing to pay for it should be treated the exact same way.",2,2012,10,29
203,The afternoon tea treat,"This is just a must. MUST. There is afternoon tea and then there is Westbury. Sandwiches are so good, we ordered seconds. The best turkey and cranberry filling I have ever tasted. The scones are lovely and the clotted cream is divine (oh, well, might just well be honest and admit, we ordered seconds here too :))). Lovely little cakes, something for everyone. Very friendly service, 5* with a smile and a genuine one too. Extra little touches such as lemon curd and the most decadently divine pianist in the background just helped round off a perfect treat!!",5,2012,10,29
203,Best location & trendy hotel in dublin,"The westbury is located in the heart of Dublin city centre .Cool interiors ,our room was fabulous ,  great afternoon tea , great place to stay for a city shopping trip, friendly staff  , highly recommend ",5,2012,10,29
203,Great location,"For me, the primary reason for choosing this hotel is the location.  It is very convenient to hop on the light rail from the hotel.  Shopping is right down the street if needed. The Westbury is slightly on the formal side the scale.  The rooms are comfortable.  The service is consistently high quality.  I have stayed at the Westbury twice and would not hesitate to stay there again.",4,2012,10,28
203,"Great staff, great location","Stayed for one night in one of the four-poster rooms and the hotel was faultless. Lovely big bedroom and bathroom, very comfortable bed and lots of nice extras. The breakfast was outstanding - really good quality ingredients and lots of choice.

The two main reasons for recommending the Westbury - firstly the location is fantastic, just off Grafton Street and ideal for those wanting to explore Dublin. And secondly the staff were without exception incredibly warm, welcoming and helpful. From the concierges to the front desk to the restaurant, the service was first rate. 

The best hotel that we have visited in Dublin.",5,2012,10,27
203,Great place to stay in Dublin and free Netspresso!,"My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights in Oct. Great central location in Dublin, we walked to most attractions and restaurants. Grafton street and a nice pub are right out the front door. Also the Netspresso machine in the room with milk and sugar provided was really a nice touch, used that every morning. Stayed in an upgraded room which had lots of space and a nice bathroom. Didn't eat much at the hotel. Try ""the queen of tarts"" while in Dublin, great for lunch or breakfast.",5,2012,10,26
203,Great location,"This is literally the best location possible for a hotel in Dublin, you are right on Grafton Street which is the nicest area for shopping, eating out & drinking. The staff are lovely and helpful. Their afternoon tea in the upstairs lobby is really a serious treat!",5,2012,10,25
203,Westbury - great location,"The Westbury Hotel is a lovely modern accommodation. The food is good, the serve is excellent and the rooms are better than most. Our only negative was the talking in the hallway outside our door in the wee hours (obviously, patrons coming in after a night of pub hopping). Otherwise, the room was comfortable, just large enough and best of all it is in a perfect spot for the shopaholic. It fronts Grafton Street which is a buzzing and busy avenue of high end shops and small eateries. If you want to be in the heart of a happening place, the Westbury is the hotel for you. There is easy access to everything Dublin and an accommodating concierge ready with all the information you need to tour or get around Dublin.",4,2012,10,25
203,Comparison with my  local London Hotel,"Just read the ratings ( mainly 2/3/4*) of my local Hilton at ¬£210 per night which bear no comparison to our recent stay at the Westbury at ¬£141 PPPN.  The Westbury's location is great the, food is first class, excellent value, but most of all we were impressed by the Staff. Without exception they were friendly, helpful, competent, happy at their work  and a  pleasure to deal with.",5,2012,10,24
203,My favourite Dublin Hotel,"As always the Westbury never fails to deliver. I stayed here last weekend with friends and it really is such a gorgeous hotel from start to finish. The rooms are so comfortable, quiet and luxurious and I loved the extra touch of fashion magazines in the room for guests to browze while relaxing. On checkout, we were offered a bottle of water for our onward journey which I thought was a lovely touch. Central location, right in the heart of Dublin, elegant decor and wonderful staff.",5,2012,10,24
203,Just a fantastic hotel,"I already reviewed this hotel but it deserves another 5 star review from me for having great staff who really have a super attitude to their work. The management deserve a pat on the back for keeping a family atmosphere in a hotel that could so easily be without. It was my birthday week when we stayed and because the hotel found this out, they gave me a super birthday and made it feel very special. 

I read something about problems with the food & wine below but I was presently surprised to find the food was not as described in that review. Excellently prepared and a very high standard. The chef knows how to serve a steak and presentation was sublime on all courses. The wine was good and well presented also. Starters were perfect and the atmosphere was royal and a very attentive service. We went for the 1 Night B&B and evening meal Deal on the hotels site and I have to say it was just well worth every penny. All the staff we came across during this stay were very accommodating and the hotel upgraded my room as a birthday gift. I will return at every opportunity to this great hotel. Cant wait to see the new bar when it is finished and might need to go again before Christmas for the super cocktails they serve there. Magic Magic Magic. 

Only complaint on this trip was burnt toast on the smoked salmon breakfast, (I have to find something to balance this review. LOL)  and the unfortunate noisy drinkers shouting in the street at 1am, but that's not really the hotels fault and the police moved them on after 20 mins, the rest of the night was quite:)

A very plush hotel with very happy, cheerful, unpretentious, competent staff. Thank-you Joseph, my hat is off to you.",5,2012,10,23
203,Fantastic Location,"Very nice hotel in a perfect location. It's a little fancy and also a bit pricey, but if you are a first time visitor to Dublin and are concerned about your location and safety- this is the place to be! The rooms are extremely spacious and the employees are very friendly and helpful. Walking distance to almost everything!",5,2012,10,19
203,One of the best hotels in Dublin,"High quality in almost everything. Best location in Dublin, nice tea area, wonderful breakfast, great service. The only issue was - we have stayed close to a room where the guest, at late night, was with the TV sound very loud ! We have complained and they solved the issue immediately.
However in the morning, at 7 am, the  TV was again with the sound at high volume.
For a night that cost us almost 500 euros, the silence should be in the package.",4,2012,10,18
203,Enjoyable Afternoon tea,"I went there for an afternoon tea with my friend. Most of the staff are very welcoming and friendly. The hotel is lovely. The location is very central! I love the area for afternoon tea. Most of the staff were very professional except one member of staff. 

As I was walking over to my seat , the table beside ours were after paying for their bill. The waitress collected the bill and as she was tidying the table she shook her head and made a weird noise. I believed that the guests didn't tip and that she wasn't very pleased. I just think as a staff in a five star hotel they should really keep their service at a high standard. 

Thankfully she wasn't the girl who was serving us. The waiter that was serving us was extremely friendly and helpful. He told us about the different sandwiches, wraps, desserts one by one to us. What's in it etc... very attention to detail. 

Overall it was a pleasant afternoon tea experience.",4,2012,10,18
203,Lives up to its reputation,"We booked our stay at the Westbury through American Express and were rewarded with an upgraded suite and a free tea for two (normally 40 euros). Our suite was perfect. It overlooked the front of the hotel but we were not bothered with any street noises. The room was nice and light but could be made pitch dark with the window dressings should one want to sleep during the day. Our bed was huge and very comfortable with superb turndown service each night. The bath was complete with towel warmer, shower and a large soaking tub. The staff were professional and very helpful. We did eat breakfast in the hotel but all of our meals were taken elsewhere. The tea was odd-tasting at breakfast but I soon discovered that the same was true throughout Ireland due to the peat-tasting water and not the fault of the hotel. The coffee was most acceptable. The concierge was very helpful arranging tours and restaurant reservations for us. If ever back in Dublin, we will stay at the Westbury.",5,2012,10,18
203,Dominated by coach parties,"An ok hotel, conveniently located. Service was good and reception staff were great. It was just a shame that packs of tourists being led to and from coaches meant that you were always walking around them or behind them when trying to get around the guest area.",3,2012,10,15
203,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location","Really enjoyed our stay at the Westbury.  It's close to shops, restaurants, St. Stephen's Green, two blocks from the City Tour bus stop.
The staff were fabulous with helping with reservations, even before we arrived, and other suggestions for day trips, arranged golf including transportation, and were happy to help.
They did seem a little understaffed at times for bellmen and in the restaurant, but I think most hotels in Europe are at the levels.
The rooms were nice, bed really comfortable, and clean.  The housekeeping staff were very nice and would offer things we might need, like extra towels, since we were traveling with a small child.
It is a little difficult to drive to with the one-way streets surrounding the hotel, but all of the taxis we took knew the way.
We would definitely stay there again if we return to Ireland.",5,2012,10,13
203,"Wonderful hotel, a true 5 stars","I spent 6 days in the Westbury during the annual IBA conference, and had a studio suite. The room was fantastic - comfortable bed, spacious room, all the amenities you need, great bathroom. Service was outstanding, never encountered a problem or delay. The restaurants and coffee within the hotel are very nice, and were very useful in holding business meetings with other lawyers attending the conference. The hotel is located in a small alley off Grafton street - very central yet quiet. It's an expensive hotel, but certainly good value for the money. All in all, highly recommended.",5,2012,10,09
203,"Excellent, but what's with the water pressure?","Excellent in most relations; terriffic location, friendly staff, nice rooms (a little overcrowded by furniture though), good breakfast. Good meeting rooms and business facilities. Used meeting rooms for several days and was overall very happy with that.
BUT, the shower experience was a bit like chinese water torture - in other words rather low water pressure. Also an alarm in a nearby store went of a few times during sleep, but that is hardly the hotel's fault. That aside - I would absolutely recommend a stay.",4,2012,10,09
203,Don't order room service!!!,"Bedrooms small, bathrooms tiny, terrible value for money, room service pizza was ‚Ç¨25 and awful, large crack in bathroom mirror and dirty grouting around the bath, room not worth over ‚Ç¨200 not including breakfast. Staff friendly and helpful but when I said I was not happy with the size of the room, nothing was done about it.  Much better hotels in Dublin, would not come back.  Terrible for the price.",2,2012,10,08
203,Excellent Hotel and Location.,"We were impressed by not only the Location and the Luxurious nature of the Hotel but also by every member of staff we spoke to, they were courteous and friendly at all times.
We booked through the Trivago site to obtain the best deal.
Not easy to find the Hotel which is located down some small side roads close to the City Centre but using the longtitude and latitude on the sat Nav took us right to the main entrance.
Breakfast was included in our deal (if not up to 25 euros pp) this was a choice of Continental and cooked breakfast which we both thoroughly enjoyed.
Our room was as good as we had hoped for, no great views, only roof tops but you don't stay here for the view it's for the location and hotel luxury itself.
We thoroughly recommend  a stay at this Hotel of which we cannot speak highly enough.",5,2012,10,08
203,Good stay - great location,"Stayed in The Westbury for 3 nights during the summer. It has a fantastic location being just a stones throw from Grafton street. I did have difficulties finding the hotel, but once I did my check-in experience made up for it. My car was parked by the concierge and I was greeted by the friendly front of house staff and a hot towel to freshen up! The hotel is immaculately clean has a luxurious and opulent feel, and you get the impression that no expense has been spared with beautiful d√©cor and fabulous floral arrangements. They obviously look after the hotel and it is great to see pride being taken in the up-keep of the premises. 
The room was very comfortable with the luxurious theme being carried on in there. The bedding was really comfortable and the room came with all the usuals that you would come to expect from a five star hotel. 
We didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel as the booking was room only and we chose to eat out whilst there. I did have a cocktail or two in the bar and they were good. We found the staff friendly whilst not over powering. 
The only reason why I am not awarding five stars is down to the size of the room and bathroom for the price paid and a few other small issues experienced. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I totally get that we were in a prime location in Dublin where you are going to pay for the sq footage‚Ä¶.but compared to other places I have stayed, I did find the room compact with the bathroom being very tight with little storage space. A couple of other small gripes were that I couldn‚Äôt check-in at the time of arrival as I was early. I was told that I would be called when the room was available, but this didn‚Äôt happen. I also had to call 3 times to have my luggage delivered to the room. Other than that, the other thing was that the remote in the room was wonky and when we called to get it replaced (granted it was at 12am), were told that it would be the following morning before one would be available. It‚Äôs the attention to detail that would make this a truly great place.",4,2012,10,08
203,Great Hotel In A Great Location,"Just came back from a stay at the Westbury Hotel after a business trip. Without doubt this is a fantastic hotel, rooms are nice and clean and the bathroom modern and spacious. The Lobby and restaurants are also of a very high quality. But without doubt the best thing about this hotel is the location, you literally step right out onto the hustle and bustle of Grafton Street.

The only downside to this hotel and it‚Äôs not major I guess, is that the gym is tiny! For such a big hotel the gym is tucked away in a corner room with about 5 machines in it. I mean it did the job but for the size of the hotel I was a little disappointed.",4,2012,10,08
203,40th Birthday,Our family stayed at the Westbury for a weekend to celebrate the 4oth birthday of our daughter who is in a wheelchair. Our satisfaction with the hotel commenced with a call from Andrea two days before our arrival dateto check we were definitely keeping our reservation. She was so welcoming on the phone. When we arrived Andrea had seen to it that birthday cake and fruit was wiating for our daughter in her room - which was well adapted to accomodate the wheelchair. When we were having some champagne in the beuatiful drawing room in the late evening the witresses came with more birthday cake and sang Happy Birthday. All the staff from the man that took our car to the carpark to the people on reception and all the waiters in the dining area were so friendly and helpful. The Westbury is definitely the place to stay for a special occassion. Fonsie,5,2012,10,06
203,Westbury hotel. - brilliant hotel if you exclude the 'breakfast experience',"This hotel is excellent, the staff are excellent, the location to grafton street is excellent.     It's a little bit over priced but just a little

My only area for complaint was at breakfast time -- not the quality of the food albeit the toast was very cold and most but not all of the full Irish fry was hot - mixed plate of hot and cold 
Plus I needed a fork and at one stage and was told they had none ready !!!! Real 5 star hotels don't have problems at breakfast time -- do not let it put u off -- just a bit of training and attention to detail needed 
",4,2012,10,06
203,My new favourite Dublin hotel,"Staying at the Westbury was a joy - an unexpected joy. I've ""cocktailed"" at Cafe Novo on several occasions in the past and booked to stay when I couldn't stay at the Shelbourne. I knew and loved the location so I booked for 2 nights.  The Westbury is on a par with Taj Hotels in India - perfectly appointed rooms and wonderful staff. I particularly loved the Espresso machine in the room and the evening turndown - a gracious touch not found too often these days. Entertaining friends in The Gallery was elegant and lovely. My only problem was with breakfast in the Wilde - the service was atrocious. The greeting at the door was warm and friendly and that's where the service ended. I was shown to a table - a very nice table and left there. Thinking it was an off morning, I went back the next day and it was just as bad .  Note to manager: people would be willing to wait to place an order if they had a glass of water and a cup of coffee for company! I realise it's buffet service but the glass of water and tea or coffee as one is seated would go a long way! Service in Cafe Novo was wonderful as always and the Nicoise Salad with the fresh tuna was wonderful. At checkout, the lovely lady offered water
I will definitely stay again and give the Wile another try but I'll be sure to have coffee upstairs first.   Thank you all.",4,2012,10,05
203,Best hotel in Dublin,"We stayed at the Westbury for 4 nights and would highly recommend this hotel for its central location and fantastic staff.  When we checked in, there was a problem with our request for 2 beds.  They had assigned us a room on the 5th floor with one king bed.  However, when we pointed out this problem, 3 housekeepers came to our room within 10 minutes and separated the beds (there are actually 2 single beds underneath the king mattress top).

The room was spacious and well-appointed.  The view wasn't the greatest, but we didn't spend too much time in our room anyway.  The bathroom was clean and functional and Housekeeping performed their daily chores impeccably.

We enjoyed breakfast every morning in ""Wilde - The Restaurant"".  The buffet selection was okay, but their a la carte menu was very good.  We also enjoyed dinner at Wilde on a couple of occasions and the food and service were outstanding.

The hotel is beautiful and well-maintained.  We were able to walk everywhere from this central location, but there is a taxi rank right outside for those longer trips.

The hotel staff were all friendly and helpful.  We will definitely return to the Westbury the next time we visit Dublin.",5,2012,10,04
203,Great stay,"The hotel is perfectly positioned, close to grafton street and appealing attractions. The service was excellent, room spacious but insufficient drawer space. Tea or a drink in the gallery is wonderful for people watching and street watching. 
Only one criticism, the towels in the bathroom could do with refreshing",5,2012,10,03
203,"Very nice hotel, with a couple of issues but nothing tragic","I got a taxi from the airport to the hotel, so it didn't dawn on me until later that the address of Grafton Street is not actually on Grafton, but a side street.  For someone who gets lost at the drop of a hat, this was confusing later when I tried to find my way back, walking up and down Grafton and grappling with confusion over the fact that nothing looked familiar!

I was extremely pleased the day before I was to leave to get a call from the hotel to ask about my approximate time of arrival.  What a nice touch!  I was told my room would probably not be available for early arrival, which was ok with me.  I changed my clothes in the lobby restroom, then left my luggage and went out to explore the city.  They were going to call me when the room became available, but when I returned to the hotel around 530p, and it was ready, it occurred to me no one had called after all.

Still not major problems enough to offset the rest of the stay, which was glorious!  Everyone was spectacularly accommodating and friendly and very helpful.  The room was extremely clean and quite spacious.  It's also modern and is in a very good location.  There are plenty of taxis waiting outside at all hours of the day and night.

Breakfast was, well sorry to say, gross.  Service was bad and after waiting a long time to get someone to recook my bacon which was still oinking on the plate, I finally left.  There was a door going to and from the kitchen that squeaked very loudly (I hope this has been fixed by now.)  The woman sitting next to me even made the comment about this.

Room service was extremely delicious and timely.  I had prawns with a sauce on top of light soda bread.  My mouth is watering now thinking about it.

The only ""real"" problem I had, which was not that big of a deal, was my TV remote.  No matter how hard or long I pushed down on the channel up/down buttons and the on/off button, I could not get the channels to move and when they did, they would jump up about 3 or 4 times.  I never did get the TV to turn off by using the remote.  On my way out, I mentioned this to reception, so when I returned later that day, I thought it would be resolved, but it wasn't.

I called reception and they sent someone up immediately (thank you for that!) and she had another remote control.  This one worked well w/ all the buttons except for the on/off button.  She agreed it was a problem but had no real solution.  Since I had only 2 more nights, I decided to not fret about it.

I also want to mention the beds, which were magnificent.  I slept like a baby for the 4 nights I was there (not just that first night when you're jet lagged!)

There's a spa across the street (back entrance) called Energie and you can get a discounted rate there by staying at the hotel.  Don't forget to ask for towels from the front desk.  They keep your room key until you return the towel.

If you want to know if I'd stay here again, then yes by all means I would.  I love the location, the price was reasonable and the staff were great.  I really felt at home.",4,2012,10,02
203,Avoid the Wilde Restaurant,"We stayed for three nights in a Superior City View Room which was well appointed. Beds were comfortable and room was clean. Air conditioning did not work, but this was fixed on the second. The window was locked and no-one was able to unlock it while we stayed; so no fresh air.
Novo cafe was alright and value for money on a Sunday night when most restaurants were closed. The Wilde Restaurant was OK for breakfast. We tried it for dinner and found it very poor. The restaurant was almost deserted and we soon discovered why. The food was poorly cooked and the wine list did not represent what was available. In the end the waiter had to bring up a selection of wine bottles for us to choose from; vintages seem to mean little. The restaurant manager bravely sought our views; others were evidently complaining as well. The next morning the Food & Beverages Manager sought us out and explained the problems they were having with Wilde; a new chef was being appointed etc. No compensation was offered for our bad experience. Our advice would be avoid for the Wilde until the improvements have been made. As an alternative, l'Ericvain restaurant with a Michelin star is less than 15 minutes walk away.",3,2012,10,02
203,Great hotel once you figure out how to get there!,"This is an awesome hotel right in the heart of Dublin. The amenities were top notch and it is within walking distance of lots of fun stuff! Our only issue was, as out of towners, we had a really hard time finding the motor entrance to the hotel. We could see it, but there are no vehicle streets, etc, making it hard to get to. I would recommend getting a (very) detailed map to the hotel and arriving in daylight. Once we got our bearings (and parked the cars!) we had a wonderful time. Guinness, Jameson, Trinity College, shopping and a beautiful park all in walking distance, not to mention great nightlife!",4,2012,09,30
203,"Great hotel, once you find it......","We travelled to Dublin and booked into the Westbury for an overnight stay after several recommendations; as we were driving and had a GPS system in the car we did not think we would have a problem in locating the hotel.

Little did we know that the GPS system did not reflect that the Westbury was situated in a car free street ( Grafton Street ) which turns out to be one of the major shopping thoroughfares in Dublin. After twenty frustrating minutes we finally rang the hotel to get directions, and of course there was a back way in. Upon arriving at the Hotel we were informed that this happens constantly to guests driving there so beware.

So from this rocky start, it improved immensely once we checked in; the staff were helpful and obliging and took the time to explain about the hotel and it's facilities, where the shopping places were, some of the things to do and see and helped with dinner reservations (absolutely try the Unicorn Italian Restaurant). It is very central to everything and easily accessible by foot and it was simple to go from place to place.

The hotel's facilities were outstanding and our room was immaculately presented and was extremely comfortable. Breakfast was included in the tariff and it was a very generous selection of fresh food to select from. All in all, a very good experience staying at the Westbury ( once we arrived there !!...) and it is recommended, you will not be disappointed.",5,2012,09,30
203,"Location, location, location . . .","We were booked at the Four Seasons, but I was a little concerned about the distance to the city center, so we changed to the Westbury.  The location is fantastic, with plenty of food, drinks, and shopping in the surrounding blocks.  The deluxe rooms are huge, the beds are comfortable, and the bathrooms were very clean.  Long story short, the hotel itself is just fine, but the location makes it worth the money--no question.",5,2012,09,30
203,"Ideal location, less than ideal service and decor","Perhaps I was grumpy after 21 hrs of travel and the loss of my luggage, but my first impression of our Superior Room with its garish red lamps, shiny garnet chair and horrid brown synthetic bed throw was less than favorable.  So we headed downstairs to the hotel's Nova Cafe to regroup where I was served a grilled chicken sandwich with a long dark hair protruding...my mood did not improve.
On the positive side, the room was spacious, the amenities were top notch, the windows open for fresh air and the bed is comfortable. Also, WiFi is complimentary (as it should be in a 5star hotel) and the coffee set up is good (although hard to get at)
I was happy when the front desk called the following morning to report that my luggage had just arrived from the airport...but less pleased when it took an hour to bring it to the room and not without a followup phone call.  Next problem, although the room has a wonderful walk in closet, there are no drawers in it and very limited drawer space elsewhere to place non hanging items so now I had clothes to unpack, but nowhere to put them. Other negatives were poor lighting in the bathroom, blow dryer cannot be used in the bathroom as only outlet in there accommodates shavers only, lots of street noise as we were on the 2nd floor.
We were part of a large group in Dublin so I had a chance to see a number of other hotels ...and I would agree that the Westbury has the best location, but some areas could use some attention if it wants to distinguish itself.",4,2012,09,28
203,worth the money,"Yes, it's a bit pricey, but if you use it as the last staying point, it's definitely worth it.
Location is superb, though hard to find at first.  (unless you take a taxi).  It's walking distance to basically everything.  

We didn't get the breakfast option, but there are plenty of shops around the corner and there are a few convenience stores as well.",5,2012,09,27
203,Bad check in experience,"My husband and I were in Dublin for a wedding and the night after we decided to stay in the city centre along with some of the other guests. We arrived at 2.45pm but were told there were no rooms of the type we had booked available. We didn't realise check in time was 3pm which seemed a bit late. However they asked us to come back in an hour, rather than wait 15 min as would be expected, as the rooms would not be ready until then. Frustrated we went and got some food and came back. When we arrived back it seemed the room was still not ready but after my husband spoke up they said they would switch us with someone else (same style room we originally booked). We were glad to hear the bride and groom who arrived just after us the first time were able to check in (they had booked the same style room we had) but received an upgrade as they mentioned they had just gotten married. 

Rooms themselves were nicely appointed and toiletries were good. However for the amount we paid, the level of service provided at checkin and the fact that we didn't use any facilities, it was not worth the price of the hotel. 

",3,2012,09,27
203,Awesome,"This Hotel is a gem situated in the finest location of Dublin just off Grafton street,no matter the age you will enjoy the ambiance of this friendly environment the staff are friendly, courteous and helpful the breakfast is nourishing and fresh the location is just great close to restaurants, shopping and coffee shops please stop at Butlers and have a choclate Latte hot chocolate and take some chocolate home",5,2012,09,24
203,Ideal central Dublin Hotel,"The Westbury has probably the best location for a visit to Dublin, a few yards from the main shopping area of Grafton Street and Stephen's Green. A wonderful open spacious lounge for meeting people or for afternoon tea, and a quiet bar for a drink in the evening. Wifi available in the rooms and hotel at no extra cost, great rooms and 2 locations for breakfast. Staying at the Westbury helped make visiting Dublin relaxing, a nice contrast to the busy socialising that is part and parcel of a visit to Ireland.",5,2012,09,24
203,"Lovely hotel, but let down by poor breakfast facilities","There is a great deal to like about this hotel. It has an excellent location in central Dublin. It has friendly and helpful staff. It has a very nice lounge area.

My bedroom was also very nice. Comfortable bed, plenty of space, enough power sockets, a lovely bathroom, and free wifi. Plenty of hanging space, although rather short on drawer space.

But where this hotel failed to live up to its otherwise excellent standards was the way the breakfast was organised. The breakfast room was simply too small to accommodate the number of guests staying in the hotel. I had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table. I've never had to do that in a hotel of this class before.

Breakfast was available from a buffet for cold items, or was cooked to order for hot items. Sadly, I had a plane to catch and didn't want to risk waiting for a cooked breakfast after I'd already had to wait to get into breakfast. It looked good though, and the cold buffet was certainly pleasant enough.

Can't really comment on value for money, as I was staying on business, the room had been booked for me, and I didn't get to see how much it cost. If it was anything less than ‚Ç¨200, then it was excellent value for money. I'd probably have thought it was about right if I'd paid about ‚Ç¨250. Any more than ‚Ç¨300 and I'd probably look elsewhere.",4,2012,09,24
203,Superb!,"We heartily recommend the Westbury as a place to spend your nights in Dublin.  Well located, food was delicious, the front of the house director was available to assist with the slightest of problems, and the decor was beautiful.",5,2012,09,23
203,Loved it.,"The Westbury is quite possibly the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in.  It's in an excellent location, the staff are very helpful, it was a gorgeous room with a nice view. The bar was lovely, and the high tea was definitely a winner.",5,2012,09,22
203,Beautiful hotel - small rooms,"Stayed here in September 2012, lovely hotel and decor. Found the double room very small compared to other five star Hotels in area. Excellent location, found bar in hotel very quiet but streets outside buzzing with people, and two pubs right outside front door.
In area of lots of restaurants.",4,2012,09,21
203,"Best location, great breakfast, and a luxurious/antique feel","Forget the car rental, this hotel is centrally located and you are at walking distance from shopping, pubs, souvenirs, the Trinity College Library (where the Book of Kells is on display), Molly Malone, the metro/train system and the list goes on.

The hotel has great rooms, comfortable beds, a great lounge room with views of the busy streets, and a breakfast buffet that you will enjoy.

Not cheap by any means, but certainly among the best money can buy for business or pleasure.",5,2012,09,21
203,Beautiful Dublin,"Could not be any better located.  Walk out the front doors to the bustling Grafton Street area.  Surrounded by pubs and shopping.  The staff are helpful and aim to please.  We were surprised to get hot washcloths at the check in desk.  Rooms are quiet and well maintained.  Spent some time in their bar, good food and the Guinness flows.",5,2012,09,19
203,Fabulous,"I had a long stay at the Westbury, and loved it.  It's in the best location for Dublin city centre...in the heart of the shopping area, great bars and restaurants on your doorstep, including their own restaurant.  The sTaff are genuine and happy to help with anything.  I had a room on the 4th floor overlooking Grafton St.  The rooms are elegantly decorated, spacious, great beds turned down every evening and big bathroom.   I would highly recommend a stay here.",5,2012,09,19

203,They've still got it,"Brilliant hotel - fully deserves its stars.  Attentive, friendly staff and great cocktails. We stayed at the weekend and had the best time. We'll be back before Christmas for some serious retail therapy.  Very happy customers.",5,2012,09,17
203,Interesting how they got their rating,"I arrived late travelling on business, the computer was down so had to wait 20 minutes for a room key, when I went up to my room let myself in it was already occupied! Thank goodness the occupant was in the shower so I quickly left! When I went downstairs to request a new room rather than apologise the man on reception asked me if I was sure.....   The second room was ok - large and clean but righ outside he lifts which was tiresome and noisy. You'd expect more from a hotel like this.",2,2012,09,16
203,At this price it should be close to faultless,"Unfortunately the hotel was either full or very nearly so and the staff were simply overwhelmed at times.  Had to queue for breakfast one day and the duty staff were run off their feet.  It's a shame when this happens, as when you have a tight schedule -you end up rushing or simply not having the breakfast you wanted. Even the coffee did not make it to the table before we had to leave.
Staff were generally extremely nice and the fabric of the place was fine.   The shower in my immaculate bathroom was of the ""stand in the bath tub"" type so again felt a little let down.  Loved the scales,  I lost 2.5 kilos as soon as I stood on them. 
Only just scraped into the 4 blob rating I'm afraid.",4,2012,09,14
203,5 Star Class at the Westbury,"Stayed in last weekend with my Fiance who's 40th birthday it was. When we pulled up outside the concierge was very quick to take our luggage to reception and greeted us with a warm hello. At reception Rachel the check in was very polite and friendly. When she found out that it ws my Fiances 40th she pulled me to one side to let me kmow she would be sending something up to the room for him later.

Although we were early for check in they let us leave our bags while we went for breakfast. When we came back Rachel recognised me by name and had 2 room keys all ready - what great service!

The room was large, spacious and luxurious. The bed was a really good size and a soft matress, great pillows. The Nespresso machine was welcome the next morning after drinks in Dublin! The mini bar was a little steep but its a very good incentive to visit the bar on the first floor. The maitre d saw me looking for a seat and immediate welcomed me to sit in the window on the blue chairs. He took my order and brought 2 lovely drinks, what a nice place to sit and watch the people mill up and down Grafton Street.

After drinks in Dublin we came back to a room that was filled with petals, chocolates, a birthday cupcake and a card made for my Fiance - what a fantastic experience. 

Check out was also quick and simple and the staff at the Westbury even let us use a private room to move around some things in our luggage. 

The whole experience was 5 star. You didn't need to ask, the staff at the Westbury just know how to meet your needs. And the hotel itself, well wow, what a luxurious pad to stay at in Dublin.",5,2012,09,14
203,EXCELLENT!,"We spent a weekend in Dublin, helping my daughter get settled in at University College.  This hotel took all of the hassle out of our various tasks, the location is terrific with both tourist areas and local businesses within easy walking distance.  The staff is remarkably friendly considering all of the action going on in their place.  Highly recommended.",5,2012,09,14
203,Service is not what you expect for the money you pay,"My stay at the Westbury was the worst I had in a long time.
Let's start from the cost: 204‚Ç¨ a night. 
This would be fine in theory as the hotel is super central, the furniture are very high quality and in the staff is polite enough.
This price is not fine anymore if the service is not impeccable.
What I received was not only horrible experience but completely unacceptable.
I arrived Thursday night and checked in. I got my room (227) which seems a bit cold when I entered so I turned on the air condition and had a shower.
Before going to be I turned it off and went to be quite tired. In the middle of the night the noise woke me up and the room temperature dropped to 15/16 degrees. I check what's wrong and realized that the window was opened. Initially I thought I was stupid but then I checked and the windows was actually broken (couldn't close it) so wind and noise was coming in.
I call maintenance and they tell me that in the morning they would send someone so I try as best as I can to close it.
In the morning I leave the hotel to go to work and on my return the window is still broken. I call maintenance again and they come to see the window. They told me ""oh, it's broken"" and I say ""really?""... I asked to get another room but they were fully booked so they called another maintenance guy who brought some tape and (yes, you can laugh) start taping around the window...
They also tell me that the following day they would either repair my window or move to another room.
In the morning I go to work again and on my return my key to get in the room is not working so I go downstairs and I tell the reception. They do something with their terminal and tell me ""now it should work"".. I go upstairs and I get in the room to discover a old couple in bed... I apologize and go downstaird again and asked an explanation and they told me that I got moved...
Finally I go to my new room (where the air condition was set to 16 degrees) and freezing I go to bed.",1,2012,09,13
203,My favourite by far,"I visit Dublin about once or twice a year as I absolutely love this city. My last visit (which was in March 2012) I stayed at The Westbury and I found it to be not only clean and friendly but in an excellent location (within stumbling distance of some great pubs/bars). 
The restaurant The Wilde in the hotel is very nice however only really for those that fancy splashing out on a meal. 
I would definitely recommend staying here as I will be again in November this year!",5,2012,09,13
203,"Great hotel, Great Location",Stayed there for a week recently.  You cannot beat the location.  It is right on Grafton Street in the heart of the tourist and pub areas.  Some reviews mentioned it seemed a bit run down but I think it has been renovated recently because it was fresh and clean.  The staff was great and helpful.  The rooms were clean and spacious and the lobby was great.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin to tour.,4,2012,09,12
203,Awesome,"We had a group of 12 and took a 12 day tour of southern Ireland. We got spoiled by staying the first 2 nights at the Westbury. What a gorgeous hotel and the staff was tremendous. The breakfast (included) was the best. Nice central location to all the sights including Grafton St., Temple Bar, and O'Neils. My wife and I are going to plan another weeks stay in Dublin and just take day trips. Dublin is so easy to get around by walking or the hop on hop off bus. ",5,2012,09,10
203,One Of The Best Ever!,"My Wife and I spent a couple of days at The Westbury Hotel on our first ever visit to Dublin. Our stay was absolutely faultless, check in was quick with very polite and helpful staff. The room was excellent, good size, very comfy bed and exceptionally clean. The espresso machine in the room was great (although half of the little cartons of milk in the tea box were seriously out of date!). Good size bathroom, again spotlessly clean with a reasonable shower. The view from the room was across the rooftops along the back of Grafton street and was very quiet resulting in a couple of good nights sleep. We ate in the Cafe Novo on our first evening and the food was absolutely delicious, couldn't fault it at all. We returned there for a leisurely breakfast the following and again it was faultless, good value food and very prompt and friendly service.

We wouldn't hesitate in staying here again!

Whilst there we did the Dublin bus tour (green buses) which was good and the Guiness tour, not so good, we were expecting to at least see some of the factory and the manufacturing process but you don't get any of that, the included pint of Guiness though was probably the freshest you will get given its location!",5,2012,09,10
203,Great location,"Our experience at the Westbury was overall very pleasant and should rank somewhere between average and very good -- better than average but I have a hard time saying very good either.  Our room was a suite of two very small rooms that looked out over rooftops.  I appreciated this ""view"".  The rooms were comfortable and attractively furnished though in modern style which is not my preference for an historic hotel.  The staff was friendly and eager, though they were unable to stop our toilet running, which it did for the duration of our stay.  Bedding good.  Pillows poor.  Public spaces pleasant.  To be in the thick of things, it was the perfect location.  With some reservation, I would stay there again.  On other trips to Dublin we have stayed at the Merrion House.  Westbury, while nice, is not on par with Merrion.",4,2012,09,10
203,Nice place,"Our tour ended here.  The hotel seemed very comfortable, good food and concierge service.  Our tour group was checking out on different days.  The first day after the tour, our remainder group came back and found our key cards did not open the rooms.  Mass exodus to the desk, many apologies.  The second day, same thing for us two.  The concierges quoted my husband and me different prices for the same trip (the one I was told was the correct one)-could have been a frustrating error due to not having enough cash (found an ATM).
There have been massive crowds here due to the Notre Dame Army game tourism, but they've been coping, although elevators have been slow (we used the stairs).",4,2012,09,09
203,"Great location, great service","We had the pleasure of staying at The Westbury, Dublin the last week of August. We arrived from California (after 24+hrs on the road) and were shown to a room that didn't quite match what we had reserved. When I called the front desk to discuss availability and a possible room change, they were very apologetic and most accommodating. JD put us into an exquisite suite on the 6th floor (top floor) overlooking the city. What a treat! We stayed for two nights, and regrettably had to stick to our travel schedule. I could have stayed on a few more nights!
The location, as others have mentioned, is perfect. Grafton St is right outside the front door - pubs, restaurants, stores....anything you could want is at your disposal. The Luas (light rail system) is literally around the corner and is clean, reliable and affordable.
We did not get a chance to dine at the hotel, so I cannot comment. Had a quick peek inside the restaurant and it looked very nice.
The staff at the Westbury were all very pleasant and professional. I would go back in a heartbeat, and will recommend this property to anyone looking for exceptional comfort and convenience.",4,2012,09,07
203,Afternoon tea at the Westbury,"What a fab experience we had at the Westbury last weekend. I arrived early, on a flight from the UK and asked if I could store my luggage with the concierge whilst I went out shopping...I was not staying at the hotel, just returning later that day for afternoon tea. It was no issue whatsoever and from the start I had a good feeling about the hotel. Afternoon tea was delicious, and the waitress asked were we there for a special occasion, I said it was my mother's birthday the following day and that I'd surprised her with the afternoon tea treat. A short time later, all 4 waitresses came over to the table, with a special birthday muffin for my mother and happy birthday written in chocolate on the plate, and the muffin had a candle in it, and they sang happy birthday. It was such a lovely surprise. What lovely, attentive and friendly staff. Thanks for making it a special experience for my mother. I would not hesitate to recommend afternoon tea to anyone and look forward to returning, when I am back in Dublin again. Great value for money also - we had too much, couldn't finish it, but they wrapped it up in bags for us to take home! :)",5,2012,09,06
203,Great Hotel in a Fabulous Location!,"My wife and I were in Dublin the last week in August and stayed at The Westbury for two nights. What a fantastic hotel in the center of everything right off of Grafton Street. The room was great, the bed was very comfortable and the service was top notch. There were hundreds of people coming in for a Notre Dame football game and that did not stop the staff from being attentive to each guest.
The prime location was great for exploring both the sights of Dublin and the pubs of Dublin. This is where you want to stay in the city center. My wife was in Dublin on business and the hotel was great for that as well.
They did a nice job serving breakfast to a mass of people. Everything about this hotel was outstanding. Two good pubs right outside the door if you wanted to stay close, or the whole of the city at your feet if you want to explore! We highly recommend this hotel. Well worth the price.",5,2012,09,06
203,Great location,Stayed at this hotel for 1 night with my sisters for a birthday treat.  We arrived early and were told our room would be ready before 3pm.  The receptionist was very friendly and during conversaton it was mentioned thiat we were celebrating a birthday.  Our room wasn't actually ready until 4.05pm - but when we got in there was a beautiful birthday card and small cake for our celebration - a great touch!  The room had 2 king size beds and all the amenities expected from a 5* hotel.  However there were a few wee things that could have been improved on -  the carpet had some stains and around the shower had mould!  The hotel is in a great location and convenient to beautiful shops!  All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  We will go back for another stay.,4,2012,09,06
203,Great hotel and location,Had a great hotel stay in the heart of Centre City area. Room was very spacious and had all of the amenities that we found necessary. Ideal location in hit all of the tourist sites. Staff was very attentive. Free wifi and water at night. Clean rooms and comfortable beds.,5,2012,09,06
203,"Personal, professional, perfection","My spouse and I stayed at the Westbury on two occasions in late August as part of our attending a conference at Trinity College.

We arrived later in the morning after a flight from Canada for a single night stay, and while check-in was later in the afternoon, a room was made available to us within an hour which we very much appreciated.

We returned to the Westbury following a five-day geology field trip to Co. Clare and were looking forward to spending another five days in Dublin at the conference and enjoying the city. We arrived in a not too pristine condition and were surprised to immediately be greeted by the hotel manager, Edward Stephenson. He warmly welcomed us to the Westbury, and he and his staff personally attended to our needs and check-in.  Upon entering our room, we were delighted to discover an ice bucket of cold beer and associated nuts and crips awaiting us - just what we needed. This is an outstanding example of perfect attention to the Westbury‚Äôs guests‚Äô needs ‚Äì anticipated or otherwise.

We found all members of Mr. Stephenson‚Äôs team most helpful and professional. Our room was well appointed and quiet, and dining at the Wilde restaurant most enjoyable ‚Äì excellent meals.  And of course, the hotel‚Äôs location is ideal for exploring Dublin, and, shopping.

We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Dublin, and our stay at the Westbury was the icing on the cake.  We give it our highest recommendation.",5,2012,09,05
203,Fantastic Location and Enjoyable Stay,"After arriving into Dublin from the US, we were easily able to check in at 9 AM and head straight to our room.  The room was spacious and clean.   The room had all the amenties I could want and we enjoyed the great location off of Grafton Street.  Our only downfall was the our bill for breakfast was not clear.  We had order ala carte, but were charged for the buffet which resulted in us paying a little extra.  We had no time to deal with the bill due to getting to our next location.",5,2012,09,04
203,The Gallery For Tea & Scones... :),"I went to the Gallery for tea & scones at the beginning of my Ireland trip and then again at the end of my Ireland trip and enjoyed my time there on both occasions.  It's actually a bit of an oasis away from the throngs of people on that overcrowded shopping street right around the corner.  I was told to try a couple of cafes nearby but they were mobbed with sandal wearing, backpack toting types so I continued to search for somewhere tasteful rather than settle for the chain-like cafes catering to the masses.  That whole street was a bit of a nightmare for finding anything with a sense of class and then I saw the Westbury, went upstairs and immediately felt at ease.

The atmosphere in the Gallery was very relaxing and elegant.  There was a piano player on the first day when I was there so I believe it was a weekend because I was there on a Thursday at the end of my trip and there was no one playing piano then.

The servers on both days were very friendly and attentive.  I didn't have to wait very long for anything.  The seats by the windows seem to be popular but I liked the sofas away from the windows as they were much more comfortable than the single sofa-chair I had the first time.  

The scones were delicious and I was relieved that they had clotted cream as I had had a hard time finding it in other cities during my trip.  The little jam jars weren't that great because it seemed a bit like a family restaurant or an airplane when they were served that way.  I'd rather not open containers when I am in a five-star hotel.  And I only liked one flavor out of the three served to me so I had to stretch it out a bit.  (Minor details)

The tea was delicious both times and thankfully loose leaf as opposed to another five-star hotel where I had ordered the full Afternoon Tea on another day.  I had more than enough tea to drink during my lengthy and peaceful afternoon break from the noise and crowds just a short distance away.  

Spending time in The Gallery for Afternoon Tea or drinks would be an excellent idea for people who are seeking somewhere a bit more refined.",5,2012,09,04
203,"Wonderful Hotel, Great Location","I highly recommend this hotel.  My room was fabulous, spacious and clean.  The staff could not be friendlier or more helpful.  The lobby is large and quite nice.  I really enjoyed the buffet at breakfast.  The location is excellent also, just off of Grafton St.  There is a very friendly pub a half block from the hotel entrance that I would also recommend.",5,2012,09,03
203,Best Location in Dublin,"This was my second stay at the Westbury Hotel.  This time we brought our children and grandchildren, and it was a perfect stay.  Every request that I had was honored.  Our four rooms were located on the same floor, and next to each other.  The baby crib was already waiting in one room, and one rollaway bed was already in a connecting parent - child room.  Breakfast was outstanding in a lovely setting with delicious items for every taste.  We were greeted warmly by the reception staff, and the rooms were clean and tastefully decorated.  There is not enough that I can say about the location - you are near EVERYTHING!!!!!  I heartily recommend this hotel.  I would absolutely choose this hotel again.",5,2012,09,03
203,Amazing hotel,"We booked online, and the hotel waited until just a couple of days before our stay to confirm the stay...at that point, we were already in Ireland and not sorry to say that we were NOT using our cellphones. We attempt to check in, only to find out that out reservations had been cancelled because they couldn't reach us...I made a big scene, and luckily the concierge, JD, handled me very well to where I no longer wanted to commit murder...we were sent to the Shelbourne for the night, and then back to the Westbury for the rest of our stay. The Westbury far exceeds the Shelbourne in elegance, comfort, and level of service (despite the initial snafu). Our room was one of the top rooms we've stayed at in the world. And, there's no cooler reception, sitting area than at the Westbury. It's both trendy and elegant.Not to mention that you are in a vibrant area of the city, walking distance to a number of attractions. 
Oh, and Westbury management? JD is a real gem and should be promoted immediately.",5,2012,08,30
203,Unbelievable and rewarding experience!,"Fantastic hotel stay,enjoyable atmosphere,kind and caring staff,amazing rooms and fine dining aswell,would recommend to anyone,set in the heart of dublin,we were treated like royalty,the elegant shops of grafton street only a stone throw away,looking forward to staying there again in the not to distant future",5,2012,08,28
203,"Great hotel, great location!","We stayed at the Westbury Hotel as our first stop on our trip to Ireland.  The hotel is in a great location close to shops, sites and restaurants.  We stayed for two nights and felt like we were in a luxury hotel.  The rooms were very spacious, modern and comfortable.  The breakfast was definitely a highlight!  Most hotels throughout our trip offered breakfast but the Westbury's was the best by far.  The service was also excellent.  Overall this is great hotel!",5,2012,08,28
203,Pure luxury!,"I really, really enjoyed this hotel. The decor is plush and elegant with think carpets and fluffy duvets and great pillows. The colours scheme is warm maroons and purples and there are loads of lovely extra touches like a bench in the lift and a nespreso machine in the room with a Butlers chocolate on the bed! 
I've already decided to come back for a weekend at Christmas. The location is perfect for December the 8th shopping!
One slight issue was the size of the bathroom, you will only get one person in there but the towels were thick and they've a heated radiator to make sure they're warm when you get out of the shower, brilliant! 
My favourite hotel so far!",5,2012,08,28
203,Beautiful Hotel in the heart of Dublin,Lovely hotel with tons of amenities.  Incredibly nice staff and rooms are very nice and modern.  Perfect location for exploring Dublin.  The rooms have every modern amenity you can imagine and the Nespresso coffee maker is fantastic for that early morning caffeine fix.  Definitely recommend this hotel.  You won't be sorry.,4,2012,08,23
203,Perfection,"We had a wonderful two night stay at the Westbury.  The staff was amazing, the rooms spacious and well appointed, and the breakfast was quite delicious.  Make sure to try the jam as it is made by a local woman just for the hotel!  The location was perfect for walking to the sites and restaurants.  Temple bar was an easy 15 minute walk from the hotel.",5,2012,08,23
203,"We loved this hotel, from check-in to check-out","We spent 4 nights at the Westbury Hotel in early August of 2012. And then were back again, for a night, before flying home. We arrived in Dublin early and asked for an early check-in. They didn't have anything available, so we checked our bags at the front desk and went out to explore Dublin. Checked back in later, waited awhile in the large lobby in comfortable chairs and they came and found us and told us when our room was ready. We had a Deluxe Room with 2 Double beds, but they seemed more like King size beds. The room was huge, with a nice snack bar area,  and a large bathroom. I definitely felt like it was a five star hotel. Everyone was so helpful and pleasant. The beds were comfy, there were heated towels and good coffee. My entire family enjoyed it. The only problems we had, were minimal, which is why I still gave it 5 stars. The refrigerator didn't cool and seemed warm on the outside, so they sent up a second fridge. Problem solved. The view is not going to be good, because you're downtown Dublin and the buildings are close. We didn't spend enough time in the room to mind. They aren't big on washcloths, but I think this may be a European trait, because it also happened in Norway. We had washcloths at The Westbury, 2 nights of our 5 nights stay. If it's important to you, mention it to them when you arrive. Otherwise, we loved the hotel, staff and the city. Will definitely be back!",5,2012,08,22
203,always a pleasure,"We stayed at the westbury for one night recently for a concert with our teenage son. We had a deluxe room which had 2 double beds. Perfect for our requirements,lovely and clean, spacious and comfortable. 2 things make the westbury stand out from the rest. 1. the location, right on grafton street, great for getting around to all the sights, and 2. the service. The staff are so good they really do stand out from other 5 star hotels They simply cant do enough for you, it makes all the difference to have such excellent service and makes the stay much more comfortable. Prices have certainly reduced in recent years but service hasnt diminished as a result, We will definately be staying again, the only things i dislike is how difficult it can be to access the hotel with the one way system around dublin but u can get over that, thanks for the great stay",5,2012,08,21
203,"Great hotel, great location","If you want to be in the heart of Dublin and enjoy a top notch hotel...the Westbury is a must. Beautiful decor, great lounge and bars. Staff couldn't be more on top of their game. Rooms were well appointed with great AC. Walking distance to shopping, sites, Bistros...and people walking the streets watching the side shows.",5,2012,08,21
203,Great Service,"Stayed recently at the Westbury, have to say I really enjoyed our break there. We got a very good price. We brought our 1 year old girl with us. Our room came with breakfast which was great. I have stayed in several '5 star hotels' in recent years in Ireland an while they are all nice the most notable thing about the Westbury is that it is a 'real 5 star'. It has '5 star' service. We were greeted at the curb by staff who took our car and bags, they walked us to a very busy reception which checked us in immediately. The porter walked us with our luggage to the room, another porter arrived simultaneously with the cot for our baby. We had some drinks and food that evening in the lobby, service again top class. Breakfast was served very promptly, several staff descended on our table. When I checked out my car was already out front and the bags in the back. Location wise it is probably the best in Dublin as it is just off Grafton Street. We went shopping there before we checked out.The one piece of advice I would give travelers is if you are driving research it first. It is very tricky to navigate as it is in the very center of town and Grafton street is pedestrianized. Their car park is underneath and it is best if you have them park the car for you. I will stay here again.",5,2012,08,20
203,"Excellent hotel, great location, great service","A group of us stayed in the Westbury for 5 nights and would recommend this hotel.  It is right in the heart of Dublin, close to everything.  Having stayed in numberous hotels in Dublin, I would have to say that this is the best located.  The staff here are exceptional and could not do any more for us.  The hotel itself is beautiful and facilities great.  I was travelling with elderly relatives and the hotel was very suitable for them.",5,2012,08,20
203,Great Hotel in an Amazing Location,"My wife and I stayed at The Westbury Hotel for two nights. It was the first stop of many in our tour around Southern Ireland. The hotel was clean, staff was friendly and very helpful and the service was great. The location (right on Grafton Street) is ideal and central to everything you would pretty much want to see. Dublin is not a large city so mostly ever sight can we walked to if chosen.  We booked a standard room which was clean and comfortable. My only issue is that we did not have a great view but for the amount of time we spent in the hotel, it did not matter too much. I would definitely recommend The Westbury for anyone who is visiting Dublin.",5,2012,08,20
203,Excellent hotel with great service.,"My wife and I stayed here in early august and enjoyed every minute of our stay. From the doorman to the cleaning staff everyone was kind and helpfull going out of there way to make us feel comfortable and relaxed during our stay in wonderful ,eccentric Dublin.The room was faultless with a large beautifully decorated bathroom and buckets of space to spread out and unwind.The breakfast was included in the rate and I would particularly recommend it as it was one of those memorable experiences that you shouldn't miss if possible....all up a great stay in a top class hotel !",5,2012,08,19
203,"comfortable, well-appointed, in a great location","We very much enjoyed our stay at the Westbury.  We loved the location - right of Grafton St and all the shopping.  We found our room quiet spacious, and there were 4 of us. Bedding and mattress very comfortable, nice bathroom.  Staff was friendly, very helpful.  Highly recommend.  Didn't try the champagne bar or the high tea area but they looked beautiful and luxurious",5,2012,08,19
203,Great hotel,"Found this hotel on Tripadvisor. It was all that other reviewers promised.  Luxury accomodations; superb service, very helpful staff,  perfect location.  If I return to Dublin, I would not stay anywhere else.",5,2012,08,19
203,Disappointed Again,"This was our second stay at The Westbury. We decided to give it another chance as our last stay's complaint was more about the Cafe adjoining the hotel. 
Although the location is fantastic, the door staff are especially friendly and helpful, unfortunately our positives stop there. 
There was a que of 8 couples waiting for check in when we arrived and only two staff at the check in desk. It took us 20 minutes to get checked in. Our rooms were not ready so we went to the lounge for some lunch and after sitting for 10 minutes un noticed my husband had to get up  and find someone to serve us. The food itself did come quickly and was tasty, but very expensive although only to be expected in central Dublin. 
Our main complaint was the Bed in our room. I had complained to my Husband after our first night that it was very uncomfortable and sagged in the middle and that my back was sore the following morning. He had been so tired from a busy few days at work he felt it was fine, so we did not complain. However after a second night I was in a lot of pain the following morning and my Husband had also agreed it was uncomfortable. When we removed the sheets the mattress was collapsed at on end and sagging in the middle. We also were disappointed to find the air vent in the bathroom did not work. We also had a Newspaper on our bill which we had not ordered. All in  all we were disappointed and would seek alternative accommodation in the future. Such a shame for a  great located hotel.",3,2012,08,17
203,Excellent location and wonderful atmosphere,"This hotel is in an excellent location.Breakfast is excellent .The standard of service is excellent. The sitting room upstairs has a wonderful atmosphere and buzz and is great just to relax in.Your car is dealt with in an efficient manner by the doorman once you have managed to negotiate the myriad of side streets to get there.Some of the rooms are good but some are small and depressing.Staff is friendly,helpful and efficient. We have stayed many times over the years but feel that it is grossly overpriced.  Apart from the location it does not warrant the colossal prices for bed and breakfast .This hotel is not good value and for this reason alone we cannot rate it excellent but this is not to detract from the fact that this is a wonderful hotel.",4,2012,08,17
203,Great hotel if/when you can get to it,"We booked the Westbury because of it's central location but we didn't realize it would be so difficult to get to...because of it's central location.  It took us 90 minutes to drive from Belfast to Dublin and almost that long again to find our way to the hotel.  At one point we were only 100 yards way (across a pedestrianized area) and couldn't get to it.  Just be aware of the difficulty of driving in the area if you plan to drive yourself to the hotel.

Once there, the hotel was wonderful.  The staff were very friendly and accommodating and the rooms were lovely.  We had high expectation since it is one of the Leading Hotels of the World and those expectations were met, if not exactly exceeded.  There were quite a few dodgy individuals begging around the entrances to the hotel which was a little off putting, especially since there were hotel employees in the area who could have asked them to leave.  Otherwise, it was great.  

The lobby is beautiful and a lovely place to sit and have a drink at the end of the day.  I think this would be a good hotel option for a travelling business person or a couple for a weekend getaway.  It's not very romanitc but it is comfortable and a bit of a treat.",4,2012,08,17
203,Wonderful staff,"This review is more to congratulate the staff of the Westbury more so than the food, which is also amazing. My mam and I went for afternoon thea here recently as as ever is of a very high standard. However, what mad this visit extra enjoyable was our lovely waiter Craig, who couldn't have been more helpful and pleasant. In an age where a lot of people do not enjoy their job it was such a breath of fresh air to meet someone who obviously does. We had a wonderful evening and I would absolutely recommend the Westbury Hotel for any occasion.",5,2012,08,17
203,It's all about the location!,"My friend and I stayed just one Monday night in the Westbury and really really enjoyed it!  Impeccable service started at the front door when my car was 'whisked away'! Check in staff extremely helpful  and we were more than happy with our twin room.
It really was the location that we found to be so great - especially when shopping was priority! Top Tip - Monday night live music in 'Bruxelles' , immediately next door, really worth a visit.
Four Seasons and Shellbourne were usually top of my list in Dublin but The Westbury with re-modelled rooms, fantastic service and best location will be my choice the next time.",4,2012,08,16
203,Luxurious and great location,"After a long week sightseeing in London, we started off our Ireland trip with a night at Westbury and could not have been happier. This is a luxurious hotel in a great location off Grafton Street area in Dublin. Rooms were spacious, Wifi readily available, and all comforts of home sometimes needed for re-energizing on a long trip.",5,2012,08,16
203,Wonderful Visit,"My sister and I stayed four nights at the Westbury Hotel in Dublin, in July, 2012.  It is just off Grafton Street and we loved it.  Grafton is a pedestrian street with shops and is great to stroll along.  The hotel is a five star hotel with a beautiful lobby and lovely flower arrangements throughout.  On Fri and Sat evenings someone was playing the piano which was nice.  The lobby has many clusters of sofas, chairs and tables for relaxing.  They also have tea available for additional costs, however we did not partake.  The staff is always available and wonderful help with any questions, directions, etc.  We had a room with two single beds, flat screen TV, nespresso coffee machine with lots of coffee choices.  There were robes and an umbrella in the closet.  Each night they would turn down the beds, place chocolates on bed along with a freshly ironed foot mat at each bedside with said ""Good Morning"".  Also provided slippers each night.  There were two computers on the lobby floor for use, with printers.  Taxis were always available outside or one would be quickly called for you.  The rooms aren't large but we had two beds, two chairs and one table (with magazines).  I believe size is typical for hotels in Europe.  Hotel is pricey but if you want first class service, you will not be disappointed.  The bathroom was lovely with wonderful toiletries and a small jade plant.  The shower has a ""half door"" rather than a curtain, which sometimes caused water to splash out. This, however was not a big problem for us.  We did not eat in the restaurant, grill or use the bar service.  When you walk in, there is a large staircase in front, however to your right, elevators are available.",5,2012,08,15
203,"Great Location, Comfortable Room","This hotel is just off of Grafton Street - the section that is closed off as a pedestrian mall. Its between Trinity College and St Stephen's Green. A short walk to many attractions. 
The room was average size but newly updated with a very stylish decor. The bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was small but functional with a equally up to date decor. Outlets were both 110 and 220 volts. Free Wi-Fi was much appreciated !!
The lobby lounge called The Gallery is quite large and very comfortable with a nice view toward Grafton Street. It is one floor above street level. A good place for afternoon tea or a light meal. We shared a bottle of wine and some small dishes one evening - a perfect relaxed setting.
On another evening after dinner, we stopped in the Marble Bar. Another great looking setting with black marble bar and comfortable leather chairs.",5,2012,08,14
203,Luxury In the Heart of Dublin,"The location of this hotel is one of it's best features. Just off Grafton St., it's close to shops, restaurants, pubs, parks and the hop on hop off bus stop. It's beautiful 5 star luxury with fantastic helpful friendly staff and a great longe area where they have fabulous afternoon teas on the weekends. The rooms are spacious and well appointed and not overly expensive considering what the hotel offers. Just a tip- if you come from the international airport and hire a car to drive yourself to the hotel, make sure you follow the website instructions to get there. Dublin is a labyrinth of one way streets and even with a GPS in the rental car, it took us forever to find the hotel.",5,2012,08,14
203,Nice hotel in a perfect location,"The Westbury Hotel is perfectly located just off Grafton Street - the principal shopping street in Dublin, halfway between Trinity College Dublin and St Stephens Green, a great location to explore the city.

We stayed in a very nice and spacious family room (2 adults & 2 children) the rooms are clean and very comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay, always smiling. The hotel has a fantastic foyer which is nice to relax and unwind in, a nice respite from the hustle and bustle of Grafton St.

This was our second time staying at the Westbury and we would look forward to staying there again.",4,2012,08,14
203,Fantastic service,"We had a group of clients staying in The Westbury Hotel, all absolutely loved it. The service, as always, was fantastic - the staff couldn't do enough to help. I would recommend The Westbury to anyone staying in Dublin. Location is great, rooms are perfect, and every request of our clients were met.",5,2012,08,13
203,only fair,Ths hotel is only fair for what you get. I bar is very over priced. The food is only average. It was also hard to get parking. It in a good location but that the best thing i can say about the hotel. Overall it was only fair.,3,2012,08,13
203,A real treat,"The Westbury hotel is the jewel in Dublin's crown. A stay here is real luxury. The staff are A* They are very courteous, well informed and professional. The manager Mr E. Stephenson, certainly maintains a high standard in his hotel. His personal touch for his visitors and attention to detail is second to none. The rooms are excellent and the breakfast must be experienced! Location is perfect in the midst of Grafton Street.",5,2012,08,13
203,Committed Staff,"Front desk, concierge and bell staff took ownership and pride in assisting guests.  Several went beyond expectations in making things convenient for us, especially for our extremely early morning checkout -- about 4:00 am!  Though guest rooms are a bit small, the location is ideal.  Overall, the staff attitudes are what made our stay in Dublin so very pleasant.  Thanks to all!",4,2012,08,13
203,Lives up to stars,"Stayed for few nights in March 2012. From the moment you arrive, you are treated like a guest should be. Reception is impeccable, bar is just so calm and relaxed, food is really really good and breakfast was a treat, a real treat.

It's a little expensive but you leave not regretting a single cent you spend after such quality of service...go and enjoy",5,2012,08,13
203,Luxury and Location,"The Westbury is an excellent choice for a stay in Dublin at a luxury hotel. The staff was professional, and provided a high level of service (including arranging for a birthday cake for our daughter). We were upgraded to a junior suite with lots of space, very comfortable bed, desk and separate seating area, and satisfactory bathroom. The rooms were quiet, and well serviced (with turn-down service). Our air-conditioning died during our stay, however, we were switched to a second suite of equal quality. Neither room had a particularly nice view, however, the hotel has a great location. It is a few steps from lively Grafton Street, and a 5 minute walk from Trinity College. I have no reservations in recommending the Westbury as an excellent choice if you are looking for a luxury hotel well located in Dublin.",5,2012,08,12
203,Excellent,"Fantastic hotel. Modern luxury at its finest. Room was a deluxe which we were upgraded to FOC. Very spacious, double sinks in bathroom, two arm chairs, and the most comfortable bed I have slept in in any hotel. ",5,2012,08,12
203,Very solid central hotel,"Nice rooms, good breakfast in either Wilde or cafe novo. Service very friendly. Only downside is the fitness room, which is basically a cupboard with a few machines in it... A bit lightweight for a hotel of this overall status and quality",4,2012,08,12
203,"Relaxing, great location for shopping","We took our daughter here for her 5th birthday, 2 nights.  Booked high tea as she thinks she is a princess.  Well!, we do.   This hotel is very impressive and staff went that extra bit for our daughter and sang happy birthday etc.  we actual found out that my wife was expecting when in Dublin and JD could not do enough to please us..  He was so helpful with birthday card and card for my wife in room that was very special..  

Bedrooms are fantastic, and food also..  We have booked again before my wife is due and JD has promises Lisa and I an up grade.  We can't wait.",5,2012,08,11
203,Outstanding!,"Just back from a fabulous 4-day stay at the Westbury Hotel in Dublin.  We booked one of the 4-poster bed suites, which was very comfortable.  The staff is very friendly and eager to offer advice on local restaurants, tourist attractions, and walking directions.  Their location on Grafton Street cannot be beat.",5,2012,08,10
203,gerard belfast,"have no doubts about this hotel, it is excellent and the staff are second to none.
It is at the centre of all that is happening in dublin and you are within walking distance of great bars and restaurants.
From the moment we arrived at the hotel untill we left everything was perfect and a special word of thanks to the assistant general manager Joseph who was so helpful and a great example of  the professionalism within the hotel.
We will be back.",5,2012,08,10
203,Westbury is Class Act,"My family stayed here in July for two nights...we arrived very early friday morning and hotel staff not only directed us to a great place for breakfast (Keoghs Cafe) but when we got back gave us a suite to get some sleep until our rooms were ready.  We learned to always book another night if flights get in very early as ours did (5:30am).

This hotel is top notch for accomodations, restaurant, cafe and tea room is spectacular with views of the city.  The locations is also the best with a few steps to Grafton Street for shopping, restaurants, Trinity College, and a beautiful park nearby.

The hotel staff, concierges, etc. went out of their way to help and were most hospitable of most hotels we stayed in while in Ireland.

The management of this hotel is also top notch and pay close attention to detail to make sure their guests are comfortable and all of their needs are attended to.

The unique ammenity that we enjoyed are the western plug outlets in the rooms with no need to use european adaptors for phones, cameras, etc.",5,2012,08,09
203,a very good hotel in the centre of Dublin,"We spend two nights in the Westbury in a luxury four-poster suite.

I was a little apprehensive about booking because the hotel website does not provide much detail on the rooms.  I need not have been because it was a very nice suite on the 4th floor, which we were very pleased with.  

The hotel reception is plush and definitely has a 5-star feel to it.  Doormen were immediately on hand to help us with our luggage.  There is little to complain about with the reception but we had one or two minor problems:

We arrived early and dropped our bags at the hotel around 11am so we could go off exploring Dublin.  Whilst our room was not ready (nor did we expect it to be) the receptionist assured us that they would put it on the priority list and telephone me the moment it was ready.  They forgot to do this.  They then forgot to deliver our luggage to the room and then misplaced it so we had to go to the luggage room to find it.

There was also no complimentary water in our room so we had to buy some.  The hotel management has since advised me that this was a mistake as they normally provide complimentary water to guests.

They also made a mistake with our table booking at Caf√© Nuvo but they covered the cost of the wine we had with our meal by way of apology, which was a very nice gesture.

Overall, the front desk service was not quite as slick as it should be.  However, the staff are very friendly and helpful.  I also found housekeeping and the bar service to be first rate.  My overall view of the service at the Westbury was very positive.

One of the real advantages of the Westbury is its central location.   Grafton Street is one of the main shopping areas in the city.  There is a taxi rank right outside the main entrance so there is never a problem getting a cab.

The downside of this is that it can be very noisy late at night.  I am not a particularly light sleeper as I live on a main road in a big city but during my stay at the Westbury, drunken passers by woke me a few times during the early hours.  This of course is one of the disadvantages of a city centre location and one I was prepared to live with for the sake of being in the heart of the city.  However, other hotels I have stayed in in noisy areas have put in secondary triple glazing, which eliminates this.  This is something I would recommend the Westbury consider.

We ate dinner at Caf√© Nuvo both nights as Wilde restaurant is closed on Sundays and Mondays.   I thought the food and service in the caf√© was excellent and very good value for money.

Overall, I thought the Westbury offered good value for money and I would recommend staying there.",4,2012,08,09
203,"The Westbury, what a treat!","Hi, I had to use the Westbury for a business function & they excelled! Nothing is too much trouble & all of the small touches mean a lot......the location is perfect, the hotel is, as you'd expect for a 5 *, immaculate & the service is second to none..... professional to the core! Highly recommended!",5,2012,08,09
203,Very Nice Place in a Great Location,"Spent a night at the Westbury before heading back to the States.  Very nice hotel, clean and very good service.  Excellent location near Grafton St.  The hotel staff were very friendly and the room service prompt.",4,2012,08,07
203,5* service and surroundings,"My husband and I are just back from celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary at The Westbury. We booked the Stay Wilde package. The hotel, its interiors/furnishings, service and atmosphere certainly lived up to what I would expect from a 5* hotel in the heart of Dublins bustling city centre. 

Prior to our arrival, Customer Services were so helpful in arranging our dinner
reservation at Wilde and an early check-in for us. During our stay, the
service we received was impeccable. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at
Wilde and our post-dinner Westbury Mojitos at the Marble Bar! 

We were also very touched with the gift of beautiful cupcakes and card
sent to us from Reception, in addition to a personalised message of
congratulations from the General Manager.

We have now beautiful memories to share with family and friends
including the beautiful day of sunshine in Dublin on Saturday August 4th 2012.",5,2012,08,07
203,Highly recommended,"My husband and I stay here every summer and always find the hotel comfortable, clean and friendly. It is ideally located and very relaxing to come back to after a hectic day. Only one small grumble during our five-night stay this time: on two occasions I was served my cooked breakfast whilst I was halfway through my cereal (I'm not a slow eater), also the portion sizes varied. Having ordered the same breakfast items each morning - on three mornings there were two rashers of bacon, two sausages and two eggs. On two mornings, only one rasher of bacon and one sausage! Need to be more consistent please. Otherwise everything perfect.",5,2012,08,07
203,"great location, avoid Wilde restaurant","A Dublin landmark hotel which used to be frequented by celebrities, when celebrity meant something.   Famous for its afternoon tea.  Hidden away, but a fantastic location 10 steps from Dublin's most popular pedestrianized shopping street, Grafton Street, with its cafes, bars, street performers and throngs of tourists.  Decent size, clean modern rooms, but nothing to really wow.  Nice lobby and bar area.  Friendly, efficient service from hotel staff.  Onsite restaurant, Wilde, is a different matter.  
Decided to have dinner at Wilde   Sat for 20 minutes before anyone even came to ask if I would like to order a drink.    I did see a few wait staff look at me as if to say I wonder if anyone is looking after that guy, but nobody approached me.  After i finally got a waiter to take my order, I ordered a lamb dish as my main course.  I did think it odd that I wasn't asked what temperature I would like my lamb cooked - after about ten minutes from taking my order someone had the sense to ask me how I wanted my lamb cooked.  The food was good, but the overall experience was let down by shoddy service which is not to be expected in a hotel with this reputation. I would return, but would avoid Wilde.",4,2012,08,05
203,Excellent,"We stayed at this hotel for one night in July, and we're very impressed.  The location is perfect for exploring all parts of the city. 

Within 5-10 minutes of shopping, pubs, Temple bar and some of the best Dublin neighborhoods. 

pros:
Great service
Clean, large rooms
Comfortable beds & linens
Turn down service at night
Good value
Great location

cons:
Breakfast in the hotel is not included, and costs 25 EUR per person",5,2012,08,05
203,"the gallery, not for afternoon te","We went to the gallery in the Wstbury hotel to have a nive afternoon tea for 2. 
The locationa and view was excelent I might say that, but for the rest not good. The tea was good, but as my friend put it it's very difficult to find bad tea in UK or Ireland, so not bad, but not the best we've tried by far. 
The food, that was terrible. Sandwiches,.... well I was expecting at leat fresh bread, but it was a bad one, it tasted as 2-day-old bread, or defrozed bread, and the filling wasn't good either, I was looking for grat  smoked atlantic salmon, that was not. And the pastries, not good at all. 
A terrible idea if I may say, the problem was the quality/prize ratio that makes you feel you've been cheated. So, I'm sure there are better places in Ireland to find an afternoon tea, just keep away from here.",2,2012,08,05
203,Fantastic stay great location for a work trip to Dublin,Really good central located great for work and shopping just round the corner from Brown Thomas‚Äô the serve great food and do a good afternoon tea. I am planning going back in October for business and I hope it will be just as good.,5,2012,08,04
203,WME5,"Had a family anniversary celebration at Westbury Hotel in July. The Hotel and staff were great - nothing too much trouble.The location is just perfect, soooo central.  Had an evening meal in dining room, were a little disappointed with meal - not bad but not memorable. Dining room practically emply so guest were seated very far apart and gave the impression of no-one there at all (tables, we felt should have been closer together so give the feeling not eating alone).The waiter seemed to disappear at the end of our meal, we were not offered coffee or liquers, so we left and went out for last drinks.  Room wonderful, we actually had a suite which was spacious and v nicely decorated. Not keen on the pillows though(minor complaint).Family all agreed we would stay in Westbury again, but next time miss evening meal.",5,2012,08,04
203,Outstanding stay in Westbury Hotel,"It was my birthday and as a treat my husband booked me and my best friend into the Westbury fir a night away. He mentioned to reception the occasion and on my arrival the had a lovely greeting and card for me. Staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was lovely and the attention to detail superb.
The location of the hotel was unbeatable for a girls night out.
We will be back.",5,2012,08,03
203,Modern Irish Luxury,"I adore the Merrion and look forward to staying there when I'm in Dublin, but decided to give the Westbury a try.  I'd been there for fantastic drinks and tea and like it's central shopping location.  My experience was very nice, but I wasn't converted.  When I arrived at the hotel, they didn't have my reservation (made through Amex Platinum) and changed the rate I had been quoted.  At first I was taken to a small room, but was then upgraded to a bright suite with a modern canopy bed.  The hotel is luxurious in style that seems very Irish/Uk to me: clean neutrals with some homey (or homely as they say here) embellishments.  It felt a bit feminine to me--like an ideal hotel for hen parties, girlfriend teas, mother-daughter shopping spa weekends.  It doesn't have the depth of history or refinement, the art collection, or the flawless service of the Merrion--but it is an extremely nice hotel.  
They do an excellent job with the basics: free wifi, lots of free bottled water, and a complimentary nespresso coffee machine in the room.  Also, a simliar quality hotel in NYC or London would cost at least 4 times as much, so it's amazing value.",4,2012,08,02
203,Outstanding stay in luxury surroundings,"We stayed as a group on the Go Wilde Package at the hotel. From the moment we checked in to check out we were very impressed with the level of service, the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. The food both at dinner and breakfast was of the highest quality and the presentation was immaculate. The rooms were spotless and the neds were very comfortable. I would highly recommend this hotel. It is in a superb location off Grafton St and is defintely worth the extra bit of money!!!!",5,2012,08,02
203,Madonna Concert,This was our second stay at the Westbury and we were not let down.  Staff service is impecable and you are always made to feel extremely welcome.  Rooms are very clean with modern/chic decor and the beds very comfortable.  We shall be returning later on in the year to stay at The Westbury.,4,2012,08,01
203,""" What a hotel""","My wife and I stayed at the Westbury the night of the first Bruce Springstein concert, which we attended. The hotel was busy with other concert attendees which created a good atmosphere. It was our second time staying there and again it was wonderful. When booking I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and when we got back to our room after the concert there was a plate of strawberries there on a plate decorated with a "" Happy Birthday "" chocolate greeting. Nice touch! I love everything about the place - the location, the comfort, the service, the food. All top class and this is truly a hotel that lives up to it's five star billing. Highly recommended!",5,2012,07,31
203,Really good but hard to find,"We stayed for 1 night (we were going to the theatre to see the Riverdance).  The hotel is in a prime position but hard to find, we stumbled on it by accident after the Sat Nav had taken us all around Dublin.  The staff in this hotel without exception are excellent, nothing was too much trouble for any of them.  The bed was very comfy and the room spotless.  We didn't have any noise issues as some reviewers have stated.",5,2012,07,30
203,Outstanding Location,"We selected the Westbury for our four night stay in Dublin because of it's location. It's only a few steps from the hustle and bustle of Grafton Street. Easy and pleasant walk to Trinity College, the museums and theatre district. St. Stephens Green is a stone's throw. We got a jr. suite on the top (5th) floor. Our view was fabulous! Although the hotel was fully booked, it was always calm. The buffet breakfast had many offerings of fruits, cereals and baked goods, but stay away from the scones unless your dentist is accompanying you. It's not cheap, but it is worth it for the convenience of the location and the luxury of a first class accommodation. For the location alone, we would stay there again.",5,2012,07,29
203,Best location for shopping!,A comfortable hotel just off Grafton street.  The staff are all very friendly and helpful.  We were given a grand welcome each time we returned from shopping or an outing to one of the many pubs or restaurants nearby.  The beds are wonderful - firm mattresses with crisp clean sheets and lovely chocolates at night!  Breakfast really good with home made Irish soda bread.  There is a nice comfortable seat in the lift!,5,2012,07,29
203,Lovely hotel in the midst of Dublin,"Rooms, service, amenities and food are top notch. Ireland charm and international in hospitality. But the real benefit of the Westbury is, as they say... location, location, location. Everything in the center of Dublin is within walking distance. Great place to start a tour of Ireland.",4,2012,07,28
203,Excellent customer service.,"Stayed here for one night to celebrate my sister's 40th birthday. Booked a deluxe double bedroom which was beautiful but smelt of smoke. Spoke to assistant manager Joseph . He is an absolute gentleman and a real credit to the management  of the Westbury. He did everything in his power to improve our situation and we really were delighted with the way in which he handled it. Also, I did not get his name but the concerige was so friendly, as was the doorman.  I could not recommend this hotel enough and  will definitely stay in it again.The customer service alone makes it worth every penny!",5,2012,07,27
203,Loved the Westbury,"I enjoyed my stay at  the Westbury very much. It is in a great location and I thought the staff was wonderful. I was very disappointed with the breakfast at the restaurant, the service (perhaps a problem of communication)and the food(which was not good). But I truly enjoyed the two meals I ordered from room service.",5,2012,07,26
203,Elegant,"My wife is from County Clare in Ireland, and remembered going to the Westbury as a ""grand treat"" when she was younger. It is still a classic hotel for Ireland. Some people balk at the price, but it is not really out of line when compared to other classic hotels in Ireland & UK.

The location of the Westbury is right off Grafton Street (which is for pedestrians only). Most of the sights of Dublin are within walking distance, as are all the shops (whether upscale or touristy). The hotel is more New York & London than Ireland, and aims to meet your every needs. For my wife, teenage son & I the room had two queen beds, walk-in closet, and bright bathroom. Turn-down service with water, candy & slippers every night. The hotel staff was polite, accommodating, and efficient.

So, why not a five-star rating? As stated, our room was excellent. However, we could easily hear conversations in the room next to ours. The first night the couple was loud (we heard all about George's birthday, the weather in Britain, etc.). The second night was a different family who were more quiet (better hotel etiquette), but could still be heard. Upon my complaint the manager was extremely apologetic and offered to move our room and provide complimentary High Tea. If you  have ever had High Tea, you know that the price is high also! We declined both, but did ask for breakfast; nothing fancy just tea, juice, and toast. The next morning the waiter had to make several trips to bring up the trays that contained more food than we could eat in a week. 

The Westbury is a fine hotel, and I would recommend it to anyone. Also, If you are going to Ireland be sure to see more than Dublin - head to the West.",4,2012,07,26
203,Surprising Value,"We recently visited The Westbury for dinner with a family group. The staff in the hotel were as ever excellent making our group feel most welcome.What really surprized me was the quality and value of the dinner menu.The dinner menu had 5 main courses ( a la carte also) and we ordered each of them. Everybody was satisfied and enjoyed the food . My personal selection was a caesar salad , mixed at the table , with pork belly for main.Very satisfying",4,2012,07,26
203,"Great customer service and location, but overall fell short.","During a 2 week business trip to Ireland, we stayed at the Westbury Hotel as our jumping off point to all things and places Ireland. The location is the most notable factor of the hotel; easy access to St. Stephens Green, the Luas, Grafton St., and everything downtown. You can‚Äôt beat it!

Service: The staff is outstanding and extends themselves to make sure your stay is as pleasurable as possible. An example, our inbound flight arrived in Dublin very early in the morning and at 630, we checked into the hotel. Although our reservation wasn‚Äôt until that evening, the front desk staff provided a temporary room, our room wasn‚Äôt yet available, so we could freshen up and change after a long haul flight. This small courtesy showed the dedication to customer service and was greatly appreciated.

Rooms: The rooms are well appointed with plenty of room for 2 people, 2 suitcases, and a computer bag. The desk has enough space to spread out and work for a couple of hours although the internet was very slow in the mornings and evenings. The beds are uncomfortable; we traveled with other members from the company (total of 4 rooms, 9 people) and the consensus was that the beds were terrible. They are very firm and left us stiff and achy in the morning.

Food: We ate breakfast on Easter Sunday in the restaurant and the food was bland, boring, and the coffee bitter. We ordered yogurt, fruit, an omelet, and juice. We didn‚Äôt dine again on property after this experience. Note the prices for breakfast and dinner are very expensive and not worth the value.

Overall, the Westbury is pleasant but we would not stay here again on a return visit. The recent remodel has taken the charm out of the historic building and it‚Äôs become a trendy and modern (almost sterile) impersonal space. For example, there are only 2 benches in the lobby to wait for other members of your party. The rest of the lobby has been remodeled with tables, chairs, couches and coffee tables as a seating area for bar services. It has an awkward feel as though if you are not ordering drink service, you should be there.",3,2012,07,24
203,great stay,"First time staying at the Westbury Dublin, location right in the middle of Grafton street. very pleased with all aspects of my stay, staff food room all gave more than expected.",5,2012,07,22
203,Nice,stayed in the westbury  for 1 night ...and its nice ..you are well looked after ...but for the prices charged you should be. Good to see complimentary wi-fi ... other hotels take note !. also excellent location walking distance from everything . Only real quibble is the price of the room service breakfast ..hard to justify ‚Ç¨28.75 + ‚Ç¨5 ..tray fee for a full irish  ...   however we did enjoy our stay.,4,2012,07,20
203,Luxury in the heart of the city,stayed here for a one night break in July 2012.  Room was beautiful (if a little small).  Service was impeccable.  We didn't eat in the hotel.  But we did have a drink in the bar.  The wine list was a lot more reasonable than I was expecting.  The location is second to none.  I would definitley stay here again.,5,2012,07,20
203,Well-taken care of,"Arrived at 10 a.m. and room was ready.  Staff was pleasant and attentive.  Room - clean!  The best part is the hotel's location ... smack dab off Grafton Street.  Short walks to Trinity College, St. Stephen's Park, great shopping, and restaurants.  The Cafe was excellent; The Wilde, not our cup of tea.  All in all, would definitely return.",5,2012,07,18
203,I wish there were 6 stars to give the Westbury Hotel in Dublin,"We are back in NYC after a wonderful vacation in Ireland. We used Dublin as our base and took day tours throuhgout the city and countryside. After reviewing Tripadvisor prior to our trip, we decided to stay at The Westbury due to the many positive comments about the hotel. They were all wrong!!! I didn't see anyone give it six stars! The Westbury exceeds all superlatives and is, by far, the best hotel we have ever stayed at anywhere in the world and it exceeds all expectations and comments that I have read. The hotel is in the center of all the action on Grafton Street, yet we didn't hear anything at night. They must have some top secret soundproofing patent because the loudest sound that I heard at night was from my watch ticking. The staff could not have been more helpful and they pitched in for each other; someone's away from the desk, another bears the load. Need something from housekeeping? It is done immediately and with a smile and offer for further help if needed. The food is fantastic, the housekeeping immaculate and we have never slept in a more comfortable bed. The pillows are the size of some beds I have slept in. The reason for all this excellence becomes very apparent once you meet the Guest Relations Manager, Joseph Downing. He will do anything to make sure that your stay is perfect not just in the luxury and comfort provided wihtin the hotel but he will also answer any questions and give right on the money insights and suggestions pertaining to trips and sites to see. In a word PERFECT.",5,2012,07,18
203,Ordinary hotel - absolutely nothing special nowadays,"I've stayed at the Westbury a few times over the years and when the Westin (absolutely #1 choice in Dublin) was full I thought the Westbury offered a good alternative.  Standards have fallen and the room, facilities etc was nothing special.  Despite the hotel guide claiming a 24 hr gym - it isn't and is only available 7-10pm.  Room service was very poor, slow and overpriced.  Service was generally ok, but nothing like what you'd expect for the price and image suggested.  I won't be rushing back",3,2012,07,18
203,Can't get even get a sandwidge after 10.30. !!,"Unhelpful staff who wont serve food after 10.30 in the bar! This is not 5 star service.

203,Decent Hotel. Great location but difficult to drive to and hard to park.,Hello all. A very nice hotel. Cant think of anything bad to say about the stay. My only compaint would be in relation to driving there (it is right in the middle of Dublin so traffic can be difficult) and the car park is very small and difficult to park in. In fairness there is a valet service if you choose to use it. When you are actually parked and settled in the location is fantastic - smack bang in the middle of everything.,4,2012,07,14
203,Cannot fault the Westbury - A very good wedding. Thanks!,"Our daughter and future son in law chose the Westbury for their wedding and they did a great job of making the event special for everyone.

Organisation - Catherine Griffin was great and so too was Niamh Murphy but there were others who helped to make it a special and memorable day.

The venue - what was wanted and a lot of care was taken in setting things up according to our wishes, including our last minute requests :-)

Food & drink - great .... the canapes, drinks, service

The extras - the bride and groom were given a room upgrade which they will never forget.

Thanks",5,2012,07,13
203,Hotel in good location,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is located right off Grafton Street, with shops and cafes so is ideally located for all of the central attractions and shopping areas. The lobby, bar and restaurant all looked good, however we did not eat in the hotel as we were mostly out and also the price of the breakfast and dinner was very expensive. 
Our room was comfortable but the shower was in the bath. For a 5 star hotel I expected a separate shower cubicle. Also no toothbrushes or shaving kit was provided.
The weather was not kind to us and the cost of going out in Dublin is very expensive but is not the hotels fault!
 I would certainly recommend the Westbury to anyone who would prefer to pay a bit more for a quality and comfortable experience; this is not the place for a budget break.",4,2012,07,13
203,What a night!!,"I spent one night recently at the Westbury and i only wish i could have stayed for longer. From the minute we arrived to the minute we left we were treated like royalty. Every single person working there was one nicer than the next. They were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. The hotel itself is gorgeous. Just to enjoy a glass of wine in the lobby is like being in another world. I will definately be returning for a longer visit! The location also is great. You are walking distance to shops, great bars, fantastic restaurants. The luas, buses and taxis are all very close also so are never stuck to get anywhere fast!",5,2012,07,13
203,Perfect Location,"If this is your first trip to Dublin, I cannot think of a better location.  It's in the heart of a bustling shopping and dining area all around the hotel, access to major roads, taxi cabs and the red buses for tourist attractions.  Because many US flights arrive in the morning, you may want to book so that the room is available when you arrive. Otherwise, if it's a busy time you will not be able to take a quick nap or shower.  There are lots of things to do in the area, and the staff are very helpful and courteous; they were good at making everything fun and happy for the guests.  There was a slight problem with the heating systems, but they were fixed on the first night.  The windows open, too, if you'd rather have fresh air.  The rooms and bathroom were very clean and seemed large by American (not European) standards.  Although beautiful, the high tea is a bit pricey.  Instead, try Cafe Novo on the ground floor where you can get a great dessert and a glass of wine.  I was so comfortable there, I almost forgot that I was out of my home country.  I will definitely stay there again.",5,2012,07,12
203,Olde world charm central to everything,"We just spent 3 days in Dublin after a glorious week in Galway and I cannot think of a better place to finish off our trip than at the Westbury Hotel,
The staff are very attentive and check-in went very well.
They have a very good Afternoon tea that will suit every age group.
The Hotel is very centrally located so all the major sites are within walking distance or a quick cab ride at worst.
The Suite we had was very spacious and well laid out, we booked a joining room for our daughter and that made the stay much more enjoyable for us.
We will make a point of staying her again in the near future.",5,2012,07,12
203,The best of Dublin,"The westbury has it all. Good service, good location, good size room, quiet even though in a busy area, and very clean. Right off Grafton Street and within walking distance of everything. We didn't even need the hop on hop off bus which is a savings. Right near the bus pick up for the airport which is a huge savings because you don't need an expensive taxi. For the price you save alot.",5,2012,07,11
203,Great Hotel; Great Staff,"The Westbury Hotel is clean, luxurious and centrally located to Dublin sites. All the staff at the hotel are professional and helpful. Cafe Novo and its staff including, Pawel and Lisa provided outstanding, efficient service. Will stay at The Westbury Hotel again, if in Dublin.",5,2012,07,10
203,Just Excellent,"We had an excellent stay, from the beginning to the very end, right in the center of Dublin. We enjoyed every single moment at the hotel. My 17 year old son told me that he could have spent the entire summer at the hotel. I will definetly return to the hotel. Thanks Westbury for giving us such a superb time in Dublin and a wonderful memory.",5,2012,07,10
203,Anniversary Stay,"This our second stay at the Westbury and as you can see from the rating, another fantastic stay!

On check in we were upgraded to an executive room. Large room with 6ft bed, separate luggage room and a small bathroom relative to room size. Stayed on 5th floor which looked out onto the front of the hotel. There are a couple of pubs close by. Can hear a little noise from these at night but not enough to keep you awake!

Had champgne breakfast in bed - nice spread of food with a good variety. Staff also left an anniversary card - nice touch.

That evening cup cakes were also left in room with the bed turned down and rose pettals spread on it - how romantic!!!!

Did not eat dinner at the hotel but had a couple of drinks in the very comfortable and relaxing lobby area.

On check out there was a mix up over the bill charge but this was rectified quickly.

Overall a great stay with friendly professional staff who are willing to go the extra mile.",5,2012,07,10
203,Great way to start a vacation!,"After an early flight into Dublin we arrived at the Westbury Hotel for a two night stay. We knew the rooms would not be ready yet but the staff kindly stowed our luggage, promised to make the rooms available ASAP and to contact us when they were ready.  The hotel is right in the heart of the Grafton Street shopping area so we walked out the door and quickly found the reccommended cafe to have pastries and coffee. The front desk called as promised to let us know our rooms were ready well before the 3:30pm check in time!  The rooms were beautiful! Great beds,great service,very friendly staff,great location!!  I will definitely return to this hotel on my next visit to Dublin!",5,2012,07,09
203,Super nice hotel in the perfect location!,"Located near everything, friendly helpful staff. The room was amazing.  Nightly turn down service was a great treat.  Only downside was the wireless Internet didn't really work for me- but that was fine by me.",5,2012,07,09
203,"Well located, modern Dublin hotel","A nice, modern hotel in a great area close to shopping, sights, restaurants, etc.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed, the lobby is nice and the tea area off the lobby very welcoming on a rainy day.  The service was solid and the overall feel was wonderful for our one night stay in Dublin.",4,2012,07,09
203,Pricey but worth it,"I recently spent 5 wonderful days in the Dublin area, and a friend and I stayed at The Westbury Hotel.  it is pricey in the scheme of things, I guess, when comparing it to some of the many other hotels, but we both thought it was worth it.  Dublin can be a very noisy place at night with all of the pubs and clubs.  The Westbury was absolutely quiet - no room-to-room noise nor any street-level noise.  We had other friends who who chose to stay in a less expensive hotel, and they had to move after the first night - ending up in a hotel more expensive than The Westbury Hotel because ours was already full.  The stay couldn't have been nicer, and the accommodations couldn't have been cleaner or more inviting. You get what you pay for.  I can't speak to the hotel's bar or restaurant, because after treating ourselves to their wonderful rooms, we chose to eat in local, nearby pubs/restaurants. The Westbury is convenient to everything.  We in particular were in the city to see a play at The Gaiety Theatre, and it was a 5-minute walk away.  We also took several tours outside the city, and access to cabs and tour buses was very convenient and easy.  You'll love this place!",5,2012,07,09
203,"Location, Location, Location + Great Bed = Excellent Choice","I CANNOT say enough about the perfection of this hotel's location: for that reason alone, I wouldn't recommend anyplace in Dublin over the Westbury.  On one hand, it's on a tiny, corner, elbow-type street that allows very little traffic, so the actual location is remarkably quiet.  On the other hand, five steps out of the hotel and we were in the thick of the loveliest shopping district in all of Dublin - the Grafton Street area.  It was the area we returned to again and again for restaurants and shop browsing, and it was right outside our door.

The hotel's rooms and hallways are starting to look slightly run-down and could just use some new wallpaper and carpeting, but the bed was ridiculously comfortable, turn-down service involved chocolates and shoe-shine cloths and slippers, and the room had all the desired amenities: electric kettle, coffee maker, hairdryer, mini-bar (with extra room if you want to buy anything requiring refrigeration), etc.

Our room was above the kitchen and was a little noisy and odiferous in the mornings, but when we told the hotel manager, he was deeply apologetic and treated us to all our wine/spirits when we ate dinner at Wilde, the hotel restaurant.  Overall, between the graciousness of the staff, the comfort of the room, and the perfect location, I'd never stay anyplace else.",5,2012,07,09
203,Love this hotel,"After staying in this hotel a few times I now compare all other hotels to this!
I love the location, in the heart of Dublin. The attention given to small details always make staying here a pleasureable one.
The staff have always been very friendly and curtious.
This is where I go to treat myself...not exactly budget friendly but well worth the price.",5,2012,07,09
203,Heartless,The Westbury is a really nice hotel in a great location in Dublin.you are straight out their doors and on to the popular Grafton st. And St.Stephen's green.the rooms are decorated to a high standard.we unfortunatly had a daeth in the family while we were there and had to leave early we went to reception to explain we had to leave immediately.They offered no concern and had no qualms in charging us for the night we wouldn't be there for.so what I would say is it's a great location with no heart.,4,2012,07,08
203,Great service and location,"We stayed at the Westbury for two nights last month and couldn't have been more pleased.  The location was perfect for exploring Dublin on foot, and the staff and accommodations were first-rate.  I was surprised the day before we departed from the states to receive a call from the hotel to confirm our expected check-in time.  I think I told them we planned to arrive around 6:00 p.m.  However, due to some weather issues, we ended up checking in much earlier than expected (around 1:00 p.m.) and our room wasn't ready.  When our room was finally ready (sometime around 5:00 p.m.), I was pleasantly surprised to learn that we had been upgraded to a large suite because of the wait (mind you, we arrived hours earlier that we had indicated to the hotel the previous day)!  Over the course of the two days we were there, the staff of the hotel were very helpful and kind.  We did not expect to enjoy Dublin as much as we did.  What a great city, and the Westbury is a great base from which to explore it.",5,2012,07,06
203,I will keep coming back,"Beautiful and best location. I have stayed here a couple of times and love this hotel and of course the location. Due yourself a favor and pay a little extra to stay here, you will not be disappointed.",5,2012,07,06
203,Not a single thing to complain about!,"They've got this hospitality thing nailed! This hotel is in a perfect location right on Grafton St. which is the busy shopping area and minutes walk away from the river, Temple Bar area, St. Stephen's Green and all the major touristy things. The hotel has every modern convenience and is extremely well appointed. 
The staff are courteous but not in-your-face about it. The rooms are very clean, well decorated and the washrooms are excellent...even the hair-dryer is great (a rare find in Europe in my opinion). The casual and formal restaurants are good quality and the ample lobby/ bar area is great to lounge about and relax.
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! We stayed on the 2nd floor and were initially a bit nervous as some travelers found this to be somewhat noisy due to the pub across the way. We did hear a bit of noise on Sunday night until about midnight but that was only because our window was open. With a closed window, you can barely hear anything. The 2nd floor is also convenient as that's where the gym (small but decent) is located.",5,2012,07,04
203,Good time and great location,"Enjoyed my stay at this location.  It is in the heart of everything that is going on.  The staff was wonderful and very professional.

Thanks for a great stay!

Barbara Abbott",5,2012,07,04
203,"Maybe I am being picky, but...","Okay, maybe I am being a little picky in reviewing The Westbury.  But if you claim to be 5 star, you had better be bringing it.  If rating on location alone, it would be 5 star.  It falls short due to several things.

First of all, I want to mention that all of the staff were very friendly and accommodating.  The afternoon tea enjoyable.  The lobby was lovely. The location cannot be beat for access to Grafton Street.  It is within walking distance of most of the major tourist attractions in Dublin, as well as numerous restaurants, shops, and pubs.

The cons:

Our suite was located on the second floor in the back of the hotel above the lobby.  Noise was a major issue, both from inside and outside of the hotel.  From the women in their heels clacking along the marble lobby floor which transmitted up to our room, to the numerous tour buses idling outside below our windows, garbage trucks, cars, people, etc.  We had two large windows which would normally be a plus, but there is no view from the second floor and it may have contributed to the outside noise issue.  FYI, you would probably have to get a room on the 5th or 6th floor to have a view above other adjacent buildings.

The WiFi was very iffy.  It dropped my husband and I on numerous occasions.  Business or pleasure, this was a definite pet peeve.

Ok, I know everyone relies on their smart phones, but no clock in the room? Really?  I thought this was a little odd.  US plug at the desk did not work, but we had our own current convertors.

We were in suite number 233.  The bathroom faucet was so close to the edge of the bowl (I kid you not) that it was almost impossible to wet your toothbrush, wash your hands, or place a glass underneath the stream of water without getting it all over the counter.  If you don't believe see the picture I have posted.  No light switch in the bathroom.  You had to reach across next to the front door of the room, in the dark, and try and figure out which of the four switches it was.

The gym located on our floor was literally a room, smaller than our suite with one treadmill, one elliptical, some other machine along with a few free weights.

My synopsis:

If it is your first time in Dublin and you want to be in the thick of it all, this is a good pick.  It is lacking some of the amenities a TRUE 5 star hotel should have. Request a room on the upper floors if you want a better view, or to decrease the outside noise.  I am giving four stars for the service, afternoon tea, and location.",4,2012,07,03
203,Super Second Stay,This was our second stay at The Westbury Hotel we arrived by car and used the Hotel car park the lifts took us to reception where we were greeted by the receptionist we were checked in with a smile and chat our room was not ready so we took a walk around St Stephens Green Park area on arriving back at the hotel we went in to the Marbel bar for Tea and sandwiches the food quality was very good the waiter was very efficient and well presented we received a call to say our room was now ready our case had been delivered to our room which was on the 6th floor (607) it is a Delux Studio Suite and located at the back of the hotel it is a very good size the decore is lovely in nuteral colours the bathroom was super nice tiles mirrors wide bath and TV the bed is probebly the best I have slept in it was great so comfortable and King size we ordered a bottle of wine from room service which was deliverd promply with a big bucket of ice we had dinner in the Wild Restaurant the quality of food was very good it was served professionally with a chat and smile from extreamly well presented and efficient staff we moved to the Marbel Lounge which was lovely and comfortable the staff were chatty and bubbly we enjoyed every minute *super* the following morning we had Breakfast in the Wild Restaurant it was very nice what you would expect at Breakfast lovely and hot we checked out on the Sunday Morning having had a great weekend break we would like to thank Management and staff of the Westbury for a wonderfull weekend *well done* we would not hesitate in recommending this Hotel.,5,2012,07,02
203,"Lovely hotel, Great location","We stayed here for a long weekend to celebrate a birthday. The hotel is located right off Grafton Street so is ideally located for all of the central attractions and shopping areas. The lobby, bar and restaurant all looked '5 star', however we did not eat in the hotel so I am unable to comment on the food. 

Our room was very comfortable and it was a nice touch to have a birthday cake delivered to our room. All of the staff were extremely helpful and when we returned home to England we discovered that my wife had left some boots in the room. The hotel organised for them to be sent home free of charge. If we return to Dublin I would definately stay here again.

The only downside to the weekend was the weather and the cost of going out in Dublin.........its very expensive but is not the hotels fault!",5,2012,07,02
203,Fabulous!,"We just spent a week at the Westbury and I have nothing but wonderful things to say! We had a junior suite and our room was spacious, clean, comfortable and quiet! Room services were done on a timely manner morning and evening. The staff was wonderful from the doorman, wait staff, concierge and front desk! Eddy, the concierge set us up at fabulous dinners every night, Daniel made our afternoon tea an experience so special and you can't beat the location! Highly recommend this hotel!!",5,2012,07,02
203,"location,location,location","Wow, what a lovely hotel.  Rooms were luxurious and our room overlooked Grafton Street in the heart of the Temple Bar district.  Staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The chocolates each night were wonderful and made locally.  Convenient to the hop on/hop off bus.  A must choice.",5,2012,06,30
203,Wonderful Hotel,Stayed 2 nights while in Dublin.  Great location-easy access to just about everything! All the staff were very friendly and helpful. A few staff  even went above and beyond when I discovered I lost my cell phone.  The help they gave was over the top.  Our king suite was amazing. Breakfast selection was very good.  Overall experience was great-would definitely stay there again!,5,2012,06,28
203,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location","We have just returned from a very wet 3 night weekend in Dublin and stayed at the Westbury Hotel on Grafton Street.  We were very happy with the hotel, the door men on arrival were pleasant the lobby and reception area's were very tastefully decorated, first impressions were good. check in was quick and easy, hot towels were offered on arrival and the receptionist was very freindly and efficient offering a complimentary morning paper each day. Our room was a decent size, the nespresso machine in the room is a great touch and the coffee is very good. I have to say the bed was the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in, the bathrooms clean and modern, mirrors everywhere with a wide selection of complimentary toiletries.  Room service is excellent and will be done whenever is convenient for you also offering a turn down service with chocolate on your pillow in the evening. The location is perfect in the nicer part of the City and only a 10 min walk to Temple Bar and the River. My only quibble would be how expensive the food and drink is, breakfast in your room for 2 people is 65euros.  Unfortunately we didnt sample the restaurants but i understand the Afternoon Tea is amazing from friends who have stayed before.  I would certainly recommend the Westbury to anyone who would prefer to pay a bit more for a quality experience, this is not the place for a budget break but is not too stuffy to make you feel uncomfortable. Great Hotel",5,2012,06,28
203,5 Star Service in a 5 Star location!,"We stayed at the Westbury in Dublin last weekend. The reception, valet , bar & restaurant staff are all extremely helpful & polite. Nothing is too much trouble . Food & drink was excellent. Our suite was pure luxury. Highlight: Saturday afternoon cocktails in the lounge! location is excellent , minutes from shops , bars & restaurants around Grafton St. & St. Stephen'sGreen.  Great value for money for unparalleled luxury. Can't wait to go back. Rob ",5,2012,06,27
203,Highly recommendable,"The location can't be better, the afternoon tea is memorable. But most of all, the hotel people, from the front desk staff to the Manager, were great. Kind and proffessional at the same time, makes you feel like home all the time.
I lost money on a corridor, and was found and returned by the staff members that same night, every single cent. When I came back to the hotel 5 days later, I was upgraded to the junior suite, a very nice room.
No doubt where I'll be heading on my next trip to Dublin.",5,2012,06,27
203,A very pleasant surprise,"I was slightly worried when I was told my usual hotel in Dublin was fully booked. This hotel was recommended to me but I was fearing the worst, given it is situated virtually in Grafton Street, not exactly a quiet part of the city.

Upon arrival I was not expecting what must be one of the best finds ever. Ths hotel is very well appointed, and the very attentive doormen quickly took care of my luggage. They put my golf clubs in storage and then helped me with the bags.

Check-in was fast and frontdesk staff helpful and cheerful. The room was quite spacious and also I requested a very quiet room, fearing the possible decibels coming from Grafton Street. It faced towards the LIffey River although you couldn't see the river whatsoever - too many rooftops et al. The room was very well apppointed, I would say faultless, except for one thing. The bathroom was tiny, about 2.50metres by 1.60metres, but it served it's purpose admirably.

That evening I went down for a bite to eat and was quite taken aback by the huge size of the foyer/lobby area where you can have a bite ot eat, pint of beer, high tea etc.  There is a separate cocktail bar area which is probably more suited for late evening drinks. I was more interested in grabbing a bite to eat and a beer while reading the newspaper. Very pleasent ambiance, the staff were attentive and courteous plus the club sandwich which was brought to me was excellent! In fact I was quite reassured by the fact there were some families from the ""upper echelons"" of Dublin having high tea, so that put my mind to rest. 

Also went for a walk later and in reality the hotel is some 75 metres from Grafton Street, just suffcient to keep the decibels away, although there is a very ""lively looking"" pub almost in front of the hotel.

Next day went out early, was picked up by some colleagues for a game of golf. They waited for me int he foyer area and commented later that they were quite impressed by the place.

The doorman was extremely helpful retrieving my golf bag and even gave me a couple of tips on how to play the course where I was due to play - the guy was a handicap 4 golfer!!

That afternoon got back to the hotel and had been so impressed by the experience the evening before that I had no doubt in repeating my ""lite"" dining experience. And again it was excellent. What is very appreciated is the tranquility in the foyer/bar area.

As for my breakfast the next day, you have an ""inclusive"" breakfast which is down in the Italian cafeteria. It's a continental breakfast experience - tea/coffee/juices/water and some croissants/toast/bread with butter/jam and that is it. Very ""low cost"" in my opinion, this was probably the only bad point. However this is the inclusive breakfast i.e. free, or rather it's included in the price which is a point I shall come to later. If you wish you can the ""full blowout"" breakfast in the restaurant upstairs.

However, on the upside, the price was very attractive, just Eur 170 for a double in central Dublin - excellent value for money!

I would never have thought that a hotel in the city centre of Dublin, literally just off Grafton Street, could be this good. I was amazed and would not hesitate in recommending this hotel. It was a very pleasant surprise.",5,2012,06,27
203,Truly wonderful experience,"My husband and I are just back from a 2 night stay and the whole experience was wonderful.  The hotel is everything you would expect and more.  The rooms are well equipped with everything you need, including a lovely turn down service in the evening. The staff where all fantastic, especially Joseph and Jacob who always addressed us by name!  What a lovely touch.  The afternoon tea was amazing and Jacob even reserved a lovely window table for us.  Thank you for a truly wonderful weekend",5,2012,06,26
203,Very good hotel,"I stayed 4 nights at the Westbury during a congress. I especially appreciated the friendly and professional staff. The rooms were up to the standing of this hotel.
Only negative remark is the breakfast which Only starts at 7am, so I needed to hurry, especially if I would indulge myself into the breakfast menu.",4,2012,06,23
203,Afternoon tea,"I recently booked afternoon tea at the westbury on the 5th june 2012 for my mothers birthday,I can,t praise the staff enough ,the whole experience was excellent.Nothing was too much trouble for the staff,the food was beautiful,the scones were even warm and they were so attentive to our needs .The tea pots were regularly filled up.My two boys aged 10 and 13 also loved the experience and the staff were so helpful in recommending we only order one childs afternoon tea as they would have plenty.How right they were!!!If you want to really treat yourself or a loved one i would without hesitation recommed Afternoon Tea at the Westbury,cant wait to go again,only one problem i live in England!!! i will without hesitation recommend the whole experience to family and friends.
Enjoy!!",5,2012,06,20
203,Love this hotel,"We stayed at the Westbury for five nights, and it was a great experience.  The hotel was very nice, clean, modern, a beautiful place. Beds were very comfortable.  The staff was so friendly and helpful, went above and beyond.  The location is perfect. I will definitely stay at the Westbury when I return to Dublin.",5,2012,06,20
203,Excellent hotel,"We stayed at the Westbury on 9th June, 2012.  From the moment we arrived, both the service and welcome were exceptional: relaxed, but very professional.  The room was very comfortable and the Nespresso machine took a hammering!!  Ally this to the exceptionally convenient location, and the nightlife in Dublin, and our one night felt like a long weekend.
I would heartily recommend the Westbury to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2012,06,19
203,Perfect Stay,"From the moment I arrived from my trip the staff were fantastic to work with - everyone was super friendly and willing to take care of any request.  The location is perfect - just half a block from Grafton Street with great shopping and a variety of pubs and resturants - and an easy walk to Trinity College and other central sights.

The room itself is very nicely appointed with a Nespresso machine in the room vs a traditional coffee maker.  The bed was super soft and cozy and the AC worked great.  The bathroom toiletties are very nice and include a separate shampoo and conditioner as well as lotion and shower gel.   The room was very quiet at night which ensure a great nights sleep.  I was a little concerned because my room was right across from the elevator but I heard no hallways noise at night.

The contiental breakfast buffet was fine - nothing too fancy but a nice start to the day.  

Overall I had a perfect stay and would highly recommend this hotel for a short city stay.",5,2012,06,18
203,Unbeatable location in Dublin: an ideal city break venue,"We really enjoyed our special Dublin city break in this classy, luxurious and beautifully located hotel.
It was of an elegant 5* standard and our expectations were met and exceeded by all the staff. I hope we'll have a chance to stay again here. 
As with many hotels of this class, food is pricey, so we didn't get to sample the fare at the Westbury. That being said, there are plenty of places to eat in this part of the city to suit all tastes. 
All-in-all, a great hotel for a special treat.",5,2012,06,15
203,Wonderful Start to Trip,"We stayed for three nights and were very happy with the accommodations, service and location.  
While The Westbury is not an inexpensive hotel, we thought it offered excellent value. We opted for a standard room which of course was not huge but the decor and little touches (nice robes, slippers, turn down service, chocolates) were lovely.  The marble bathroom was a nice size and had a fairly large soaking tub.  The public rooms and restaurants are very nicely done and I regret that we did not try their afternoon high tea because it looked quite proper and tasty.  The location is excellent, near to restaurants, the sights and shopping.",5,2012,06,15
203,Wonderful hotel in a phenomenal location,"I very recently found myself in a position where I had to make a quick trip to Dublin on short notice. I had not stayed in the Westbury Hotel before, but thought that I would give it a try. I was very happy with this decision. Although I don't know the hotel's history, it appears to have been refurbished relatively recently because both the common areas and the rooms are very nice and very attractive. As one often finds in Ireland, but I found to be particularly true at the Westbury, the staff from those at the desk to those cleaning the rooms were beyond courteous, which always makes a stay so much nicer.

The location is superb. It is right on Grafton Street and within easy  walking distance of Trinity College, Temple Bar, and is directly across the street from McDaid's Pub, where Brendan Behan was known to have a pint or two.

If I have a minor criticism it was that the air-conditioning in the room was only fair, and I would have appreciated if it would have  run a few degrees cooler. This is Ireland, however, and a strong air conditioner is generally not a high priority item.

I would very happily stay at the Westbury again and them looking forward to the opportunity to do so.",5,2012,06,15
203,Best location,"This hotel is the best location in Dublin!  Very comfortable rooms, very professional, and lovely hotel.  Only complaint is that the concierge passed us off to a mediocre restaurant when we requested a good dining experience for people who are gourmet ""foodies"".  It was obvious, after we dined in a local Italian restaurant, that the concierge didn't give it much thought.  Dublin has a zillion fine restaurants and it was a shame not to enjoy one of them on our first night in Dublin. (Prior to our trip, we had made a reservation for our 2nd night in Dublin.  We ate at the Chameleon restaurant, which was excellent.  It offers fine Indonesian food, healthy and fresh, but travelers should be aware that it is a casual place, upstairs in a Temple Bar location.)",4,2012,06,14
203,Brilliant stay a lovely treat,"It was my mum and dad's wedding anniversary so we went to Dublin for a treat. They were so sweet at the hotel and the manager even sent a card and left chocolates. Our rooms were lovely and cosy and  we ate in the Cafe - it was fabulous food and the service brilliant. Service so so good. 
Would return again , all in all a great treat . brilliant .",5,2012,06,14
203,You get what you pay for.....,"...that is true of this hotel. Definitely not cheap and you could hardly call it value for money but, if you can afford it, you will not be disappointed. Perfect location, excellent staff, superb food...empty wallet.",5,2012,06,13
203,Nice but expensive,"Stayed here on way back home ‚Äì very expensive for what it is but good location and has a good history. Would only recommend long stay to persons with deep pockets. Enjoyable for what it is, nice and helpful staff which is always good.",3,2012,06,12
203,Heaven in Dublin,"The Westbury hotel is by far the best hotel we have stayed in on our honeymoon - 3 of which have been hotels in the Doyle Collection and the Westbury is miles ahead of the rest! Rooms are stunning and so spacious- bathrooms are beautiful! Everything is in your room, no need to request anything. The staff are so friendly and welcoming... We recieved a little note from the manager the first night with a gift as we were honeymooners which was so thoughtful. Fantastic value for money - so many restrauants around you can't decide where to eat which is a wonderful problem to have! We will stay here again and recommend this hotel to everyone! Thank you Westbury hotel, you made Dulin a wonderful stay we even forgot the airline forgot our luggage :)",5,2012,06,10
203,Great city hotel,"Great location with fantastic service.  The concierge and bell staff were always available and eager to assist us with recommendations and directions.  If you like being in the middle of the action and appreciate the sites and sounds of the city, The Westbury is a wonderful choice.",5,2012,06,08
203,Very nice hotel,"My daughter and I stayed at the Westbury over the bank holiday weekend.
The reception staff were very welcoming and made us feel right at home. 
The hotel is right in the middle of town, close enough to walk to most of the main tourist attractions.
The room was clean and spacious, with one of the nicest bathrooms I think I have ever had in a hotel. 
My only complaint would be that the coffee machine in the room didnt work. A pool would have also been nice but not necessary.
The price was very reasonable for the quality we received.
I would stay in this hotel again.",4,2012,06,06
203,"Perfect location, perfect service","I stayed at The Westbury for two nights, May 18 & 19, 2012.  My contact with Nicola Murphy during the booking process was very impressive.  She assisted me in arranging transportation and ensuring I would have the kind of room I wanted.  The hotel is beautiful, the room was luxurious and comfortable, and the service in all areas was impeccable.  Also, The Westbury has the best location in Dublin!  I was able to walk to every sight and notable restaurant.",5,2012,06,03
203,"Great location, great hotel","Had a good stay at the westbury. Just a tip for weekenders...try not to stay on floor 3 like we did. There was a wedding on the floor below and it was like having a radio on in the room, everything was loud and clear. However, we did let the mgt know and we are coming back soon. Other than that the food was good, the hotel was clean and the staff friendly. My opinion is the the five stars are more for the location. While the hotel was nice, it is a little older style than most 5 stars I have stayed in and maybe needs a little modernisation.",4,2012,05,31
203,Excellent Hotel,"I have stayed at this hotel several times before and it never lets me down.  Upon check-in I was up-graded to a suite as I was a returning guest, which was a real treat.  I also received complimentry cupcakes and sweets in my room with a thank you note for being a returning guest - customer service at its best.  We held a breakfast briefing in the Grafton Suite which was set up perfectly.  Staff at the reception and in meetings/events are wonderful - nothing is a problem.  Cannot reccommend this hotel more for personal or business trips.  Looking forward to my next stay.",5,2012,05,31
203,Extraordinary!,"Not only is this hotel very centrally located and the rooms delightful, but the staff at the hotel is extraordinary, going well beyond what one might expect.  During our visit my daughter became ill with a strep throat.  The hotel arranged for a doctor's visit and tended to her like a third parent, bringing tea, ice cream and the like.  It is rare to find such a caring and attentive staff and you can be sure that when we return to Dublin we will be staying here again.",5,2012,05,31
203,Lovely Stay!,"The front desk people were gracious and friendly (happy to give us a load of advice about where to go on the rest of our trip!). Room service food was fine -- but much swankier to enjoy it in the gorgeous common area. The in-room espresso machine would make many people swoon.

The room was very quiet, even though every room was taken by a huge convention. The location is prime for walking to many attractions (Trinity College, St. Stephen's Green, etc.) If you book well in advance you can get a good deal, otherwise this is a very expensive hotel.",4,2012,05,31
203,Great hotel in a great location,"I have stayed at the Westbury a number of times over the past year and each time it's been great. For a weekend break in Dublin you couldn't pick a better location. It's literally 50 meters of Grafton Street so if you're shopping it's ideal. The public areas of the hotel are very comfortable and feel luxurious. The standard room is a little small but apart from that there are no complaints. I haven't eaten in the hotel as there are lots of great restaurants just a stones throw away but the bars and lounges are really nice. Overall, I would really recommend it.",4,2012,05,28
203,Quite good,"The hotel is conveniently located, just off Grafton Street and close to the major tourist attractions. Although I was with a tour group, I felt that I was treated like an individual and given great service, for example, as I wandered through the hotel common areas to orientate myslef, I was greeted and given a tour by one of the staff. The room was quite large, but not huge - however it had some gerat appointments such as free wifi, an audio system in the bathroom, individual  Nespresso coffee making machine. The downside being that when I went to make myself a coffee, the milk (longlife sachet type) was off. I called rroom servcie who quickly provided fresh milk in a jug. Much more dissappointing was the next night when I went to make coffee, the remaining long life milk had not been replaced and was also off.",4,2012,05,27
203,Fine Hotel,"A five-star is all about the service - and the Westbury delivers. Front desk was hospitable and efficient, and kindly allowed my early-morning check-in. Although I only stayed one night, every staff member that I passed in the hallways, in the elevator, in the lounge - each stopped to ask after my comfort & welfare. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,05,27
203,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel has the beauty of a modern hotel mixed with the kindness and generous spirit that is classically Irish.  If you are staying in Dublin, for location, comfort, 5 star service and genuine graciousness, this is your hotel.  Cheers.",5,2012,05,26
203,Not bad at all,"Very nice hotel and lovely friendly staff - one thing is the breakfast wasnt very big considering the price of the room > also, if you want a nice view you have to ask in advance - we were facing a brick wall but other than that nice place.",4,2012,05,25
203,"Great hotel, great location","We stayed here for three nights in early May after our trans-Atlantic flight.  The hotel was excellent, the room relatively spacious and attractive, the service extremely good.  The hotel is steps away from Grafton Street and all the major tourist sights, so it is very convenient.   We would definitely recommend this hotel to friends.",5,2012,05,22
203,Excellent location,"Ideally situated just off Grafton st , making it ideal to explore Dublin. Rooms very luxurious, we had a junior suite and it was very well appointed. All the staff were very friendly and attentive. A real treat was afternoon tea which was delicious and reasonably priced for a 5 star hotel. Would definitely recommend .",5,2012,05,22
203,Good Hotel,"We were in Dublin for a 3 night break. Stayed at Westbury. Very well located. Withing walking distance of most sights that matter to a Dublin toursit. Helpful set of Concierge's. We were booked in what was described as ""Studio Suite 1 Four Poster Bed"". Very nice and very spacious. A good hotel with an unbeatable location makes this the `go to' hotel in Dublin.",4,2012,05,19
203,Well Managed,"My husband and I stayed last Sunday and Monday night. Having arrived later than expected, we needed a quick shower before leaving for a bite to eat and on to the O2. Unfortunately our shower did not work. When notified, the very efficient staff and management dealt with this by firstly trying to fix it, and when this didn't work we arrived back from our night out to a suite and all of our things neatly arranged, a bottle of wine, chocolate dessert and a note of apology from Manager on Duty Joseph. To make this pleasant surprise even nicer, a manager whom we passed on the way up to our new room followed us down and identified us correctly by name, shook our hands, and apologised in person and presented us with a box of Butlers chocolates and spa products. I believe that this again was Joseph. 

I would like to commend Joseph, the concierge and front desk team for there quick and efficient handling. Things happen, and inevitably will go wrong, especially in an establishment that is open and in use 24/7, however, how the team deal with it is very important and this is a hotel with a team I would be confident in. This review could have gone an entirely different way. Well done to all the friendly, helpful and courteous staff. Looking forward to seeing you all again. ",4,2012,05,18
203,Amazing,"Great Hotel & Great Staff,So close to all attractions.Rooms are very spacious and comfort is well worth cost.Stayed here for a night,Real Nice Experince",5,2012,05,16
203,Great Location...Really friendly service,"Always  greet me with a warm steam cloth ...and fresh bottled water for my train trip on departure.
Friendly, helpful staff. Lovely rooms. And just on Grafton street",5,2012,05,13
203,"Awesome Hotel, Great Location, Service Splended","Outstanding property in the heart of Dublin.  The location right on Grafton Street is in the center of all the action (high end shopping, pubs, restaurants etc.).  The rooms are large and spacious (not tiny like in some Europe hotels) - top notch, beds VERY comfortable.  The service at The Westbury is spot on; they could not be any more accommodating.  Excellent front door staff and Concierge will cater to your every need/whim.  In addition, very attentive/detailed housekeeping staff.  I could not be happier with this property and would highly recommend it to anyone!!!  It‚Äôs a winner!   Nearby restaurant recommendations would be:

203,"Great location, gorgeous rooms, warm and friendly service","We stay at the Westbury whenever we're in Dublin and always enjoy their lovely comfortable rooms, super location off Grafton St and in the centre of everything plus their helpful, professional staff.",5,2012,05,08
203,Fantastic service,"The hotel is in agreat location right in the centre of the Dublin. Close to shops and St Stephens Green which is great if you want to do a tour of the city on one of the buses. The best thing about this hotel are the staff. Nothing was too much trouble and we were allowed check in at 11.30am rather the usual 3pm. We were also spoilt as we got upgraded to a four poster studio suite. The suite was fab and a welcome treat. 
Breakfast was great and included in my package. I would say that if breakfast was not included i would not eaten at the hotel as it was 25 euro.......a little exessive even for a full Irish breakfast in a 4 star hotel.  
All round a great stay and i will return. 
Afternoon tea was also fantastic at the hotel and i would highly recommend it.",4,2012,05,08
203,A Little Bit of Luxury in the City,"I booked a Superior Room at the Westbury Hotel for one night, as a surprise for my husband's birthday. The hotel itself is quite beautiful (extremely posh elevators, a gorgeous lobby), and being located just off one of Dublin's main streets, is perfectly placed for everything one might need.

From start to finish, the staff was faultless - helpful, polite, efficient. The room was much larger than I expected, with a queen bed, desk, seating area and plenty of storage space. The room was bright and airy, and quite modern (unlike some luxury hotels that are full of furniture and rather dark). The bed was wonderfully comfortable, the bathroom very smart, and the temperature of the room perfect. Among the amenities, there was a Nespresso coffee machine (which made surprisingly delicious coffee), heavy bathrobes, Aromatherapy Associates toiletries, and even weighing scales in the bathroom! Everything in the room was of very high quality.

We were on the fifth floor and had a great view along Harry Street and across as far as St. Ann's Church on Dawson Street. We didn't notice a great deal of noise from outside, despite the number of bars and restaurants nearby.

As I mentioned, I booked the room for my husband's birthday - a couple of hours after we checked in, a member of staff appeared at the door with a cupcake on a plate decorated with a personal message written in chocolate, a candle with a box of matches, and a card for my husband. It was a very nice touch (and my husband really enjoyed the cupcake!).",5,2012,05,06
203,Best location,"The best feature of the hotel is its location: right in the middle where the action is. It is certainly a good hotel. But we found it a little bit particular that the hotel is member of The Leading Hotels of the World given the fact that the bathrooms are quite small, that the toilet seat is hurting your legs  the roomservice quite slow and the absence of a walk-in shower On the other hand the heatingsystem was working perfectly. 
The reception at the frontdesk was more sufficient and adequate than hearty and welcoming. The overall idea is that it is a good hotel perfectly located.",4,2012,05,04
203,Fantastic Customer Service,"We arrived on an early morning flight and took the shuttle bus into the city (very impressed that the shuttle had free wifi) The bus dropped us at the bottom of Grafton street and it was only 2 minutes walk up to the hotel. Great welcome & speedy check in had us swiftly transported into a well appointed room. Comfortable beds, Nespresso coffee and free wifi!

The hotel is close to great shops, Trinity college and the Hop on bus that is a great way to get a snapshot of Dublin & experience Guinness and Jameson whiskey.

I always judge the standard of customer service on how an establishment responds when things go wrong & the Westbury could write the book! There was a malfunction with the safe in our room and their customer recovery was exceptional.

They serve a great breakfast - get a table by the window & watch Dublin wake up.

All staff were courteous and friendly throughout our stay & this is a hotel that I would love to return to.",5,2012,05,03
203,Fantastic 5* luxury,"We stayed at the Westbury in April 2012 for my birthday and I was lucky enough to be treated to the Stay Wilde package which included a four poster studio suite, full breakfast, 3-course set dinner, 2 complimentary drinks or cocktails in The Marble Bar, 1 bottle of house red or white wine all for ‚Ç¨409 which we thought was a bargain.The hotel is wonderfully located on Grafton Street so was in easy walking distance of the shops and also the bars in Temple Bar. Our suite on the 6th floor was beautiful and very well appointed. Dinner in Wilde was excellent and the full Irish breakfast was equally impressive. I loved the modern restaurant.

We only had one issue during our stay concerning the time it took to get served in the Marble Bar but this was superbly handled by Jacob and Joseph who couldn't have been more apologetic and helpful thereafter.

All in all a wonderful birthday and when I come back to Dublin I will definitely come back to the Westbury!",5,2012,05,02
203,"Warm, hospitable, comfortable, and flawless","We stayed in the Westbury for two nights when I was attending a conference for work.  My good impression of the Westbury began even before arriving at the front door.  The Westbury is located in the Grafton St. area, which has pedestrianized and one way streets.  Our printed maps were not helpful as we navigated the rabbit warren of central Dublin. We had been driving around for more than an hour when I got the idea of calling the Westbury's concierge.  The concierge was incredibly helpful, staying with us on the phone giving us turn-by-turn directions until we arrived.  We were amazed, as we have never felt quite so welcomed.  Westbury staff turned an unpleasant drive into a nice experience.

Tomasz, Lucasz, and the other door staff were congenial, helpful, and knowledgeable.  The desk staff were excellent.  The room was beautiful, the Nespresso provided divine.  Breakfast was terrific.  And once you successfully navigate the Grafton St. Area, you can ditch your car because the location is perfect, right in the middle of things!

We brought our baby and staff greeted him kindly.  They provided a cot and offered to bring him a warm bottle.

We absolutely loved the Westbury.  I would rate it as one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed in and would return very happily",5,2012,05,02
203,fantastic 5star all the way,"just returned from a stay at this hotel april 2012 wow from arriving checking inn, to checking out we couldn't of been more happy with staff room location .we had breakfast at cafe novo attached to the hotel and it was very nice full irish and were happy with the food.the rooms were of a high standard .lighting was very nice the bed very comfortable plenty pillows and a turn down service provided , the bathroom had wonderful products to really pamper you . i cant find a negative about the room and i have stayed in dublin on a few occasions and this hotel will be my first choice in future vacations..i love the irish hospitality and the vibe is just right . well done  to the staff for there enthusiastic approach and soo looking forward to bringing my family back with us on our future stays ,, it is quite expensive but its a choice you make ,as other people has mentioned grafton street out side the hotel and many shops bars etc are there if you want them ..",5,2012,04,30
203,5 star fell short,"Was expecting the absolute best in terms of service and extravagance.  However I came away feeling some corners had been cut.  The fan in the bathroom was not working and even when informed, we were not offered an alternative room.  Finer details including the front desk taking over an hour to bring a small tube of toothpaste to the room and the fridge being too hot and not chilling two bottles of Birthday champagne, led to a feeling that perhaps a five star rating was too high.  However loved the luxurious bathroom which my partner said I disappeared in.  Went to the ""Wilde"" Restaurant, a fine dining restaurant within the hotel, having been told by the front desk that they would be serving lobster, to find they do not serve it on Sundays because they are not busy.  As it was a special birthday for me, I was extremely disappointed",3,2012,04,29
203,good city-centre hotel with some faults,"The Westbury is a premium hotel located right in the centre of Dublin, in the heart of the shopping area, so location is ideal and  it's also near lots of good restaurants and bars.  Check-in was easy and efficient and the staff were really good throughout our 3 night stay.  The rooms are very comfortable and generously big.  There is a very good cafe/restaurant on the ground floor which serves a good range of food at reasonable prices for this kind of hotel.  We didn't have breakfast here as there are everal really good coffee shops nearby. There were one or two issues.  The reception/concierge is on the 1st floor, a short stairway from the entrance, not a problem, but what used to be a generous foyer near reception has been converted into a dining area with pre-set tables only, leaving nowhere whatsoever to sit if you're not eating.  When we asked where we could sit while we were wating for friends, we were directed into the bar on the 1st floor, where we were expected to order drinks.  This makes hanging out in the hotel or lounging to read your paper/wait for friends or whatever a real inconvenience and takes away hugely form the comfort of the hotel and really isnt good enoough for a top hotel.  By comparison, the Gresham, the Conrad and the Radisson Blu all nearby, have generous and welcoming areas where you can have a coffee, something more substantial to eat or just sit there.  This alone would make me think twice about using the Westbury again. So your room is the only place to relax in the hotel if you're not dining. The only other issue is that the shampoos etc in the bathroom were empty but they were replaced with an apology without delay - as I said the staff were really good.",3,2012,04,29
203,Two Day city break,Stayed for two nights in the Westbury its a lovely hotel rooms are a good size and very clean and comfortable the staff are very friendly the location is great just of Grafton Street it has all the shops you would want.It is expensive so it was a real treat for us but i would hope to stay there again.,5,2012,04,29
203,Excellent place to stay,"Stayed at various Dublin hotels over the years and this is by far the best in every aspect.
Location is fantastic, rooms are clean comfortable and secure and above all the staff pride themselves on customer service. Its evident that the Doyle Collection take customer service very serious and staff provide this to the highest standard, they couldn't do enough for you.
The hotel may be a little more expensive than some others but its certainly worth it if within your budget. 
One feature which I was particullarly impressed by was the turndown service including the chocolate on your pillow, mat and slippers placed out by your bedside and the complimentary water... something of a rarety these days.",5,2012,04,24
203,"Lovely Hotel, couldn't fault it","Myself and husband recently stayed 2 nights at the Westbury Hotel. It's a lovely hotel, very clean and well maintained. It it not a cheap place to stay but if you want a bit of luxury, it's worth it. The staff throughout the hotel were excellent. We only had breakfast the first morning and ate out in the evenings. Breakfast was good and rather than the usual buffet cooked food, the full english was cooked to order and was therefore piping hot. The rooms were excellent, very clean and the bed was lovely and comfortable, which made it a bit of a shame that both nights were disturbed by noise from outside the hotel. If they have double glazing, it doesn't work particularly well! Would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for the perfect break in Dublin.",5,2012,04,24
203,Excellent,"Lovely hotel, in heart of Dublin, very convenient to all city centre locations and transportation.  Shops just outside the door.  Nice lounge and bar.  Rooms very nice.",4,2012,04,24
203,NOT A 5 STAR ROOM,"Stayed in Room 345 Saturday 21st April 2012,  bedroom overcrowded with furniture.  Bathroom a disaster,  tiny sink with underneath pipes exposed, nowhere to place toiletries, wheelchair accessible shower with seat which we did not request,  so when shower was being used water went all over the place,  and the shower was practically cold. ‚Ç¨160 for this room without any breakfast was certainly not worth it.  Oscar Wilde lounge area was very nice and very pleasant to sit and have a drink in.  Hotel in ideal location for Grafton Street.

203,"Nice hotel, good location","Stayed here for 4 days. Has an excellent location on Grafton St. We had a very nice, large room. Staff that serviced our room were very professional & kind. Didn't think concierge were very friendly & trouble really started at checkout. Our bill was not correct & when the gentleman was questioned about it, he treated my daughter as an idiot, in spite of the fact that she has a Doctorate degree. I don't think you understand, he said. She showed him the printout she had, with the price quoted & still he was very condescending.After about 30 mins, we left with the problem unresolved. Needless to say, this put a damper on our day!! After several emails over the next couple days, the bill was adjusted somewhat, but the damage had already been done. In spite of location , we would not choose to stay here again.",4,2012,04,23
203,Lovely hotel in fantastic location,"Really nice hotel right in the heart of Dublin. Had a very relaxing stay with my sister as a bit of an escape for the 2 of us. Package included dinner, wine and cocktails in the Marble Bar as well as a lovely breakfast. Staff were top notch in the hotel, bar & restaurant. Proper 5 star service!
Room was lovely and beds were very comfortable.
Restaurant was very nice and the food very good. The bar staff were very friendly too and cocktails were yum if a bit slow to arrive but they were pretty busy that night so I'll forgive them for that. 
Breakfast was also very good. Good selection of cooked dishes and a nice buffet. 
All in all a lovely relaxing experience. Will definitely return if I get the chance.",5,2012,04,23
203,"Lovely hotel, in heart of the city","I stayed with my teenaged daughters at Easter, just for 1 night.  We booked and paid on the hotel website. 

The location is excellent, right off Grafton Street, the main shopping area.  Check in was easy, and the room lovely. We really appreciated the Nespresso coffee machine, and the high quality bathroom products.

I met a friend and had a cocktail or 2 in the bar.  It's a bit pricey, but the atmosphere was great. We where a bit uncomfortable overnight as we could not locate the thermostat, as it was not located on any wall.  However once I found it at 4am, we got back to sleep.

Breakfast was included in our rate and it was excellent and to a high quality.  I am glad to see the Westbury is maintaining their high standards in this competitive market.  

I would recommend this hotel, and will be back.",4,2012,04,21
203,Very Nice Hotel,"Stayed in Westbury hotel recently with my family and thoroughly enjoyed the stay. The hotel is very nice and the staff even more so. The best thing about this hotel is the beds which are so comfy, you don't want to get up in the morning. Being located at Graftan street also helps as all the shopping is nearby. Good value for money also.",5,2012,04,21
203,Location cannot be beaten,"Booked here one evening as my girlfriend was having here birthday in town, the location cannot be beaten its right beside Grafton St and Stephen's Green shopping center. The reception staff were very friendly and wished my girlfriend a happy birthday, they also sent her a card and cake later to the room which I thought was a lovely touch. Everybody on the staff are very nice and helpful.",5,2012,04,20
203,"Great hotel, great location, great staff!","We had a fantastic stay at the Westbury, we loved every minute of it. The two double-bed room was very spacious and the four of us (two adults and two children) had ample space to stay, read, look at TV and eat. Their room tea and coffee facilities were excellent (Nespresso, what else!), the bathroom was elegant and well equipped, the wardrobes were wide and clean, the location of the hotel was superb. 

The room maid was very attentive and nice and the concierge was outstanding: he solved our problem of transportation to Cork with professionalism and courtesy, and he even managed to make me save 70 Euros on a Hertz car reservation! 

The bar was nice, their cappuccino good, and the waiters extremely pleasant and helpful. They have a gym centre and a business centre but we only used the computers freely available in the lobby ‚Äì beware, their printers only print black and white.

Only a few very minor negative remarks: 1) we could not use the room safe, as the door was blocked and 2) the quality of the television image was very poor, including of the film that we rented through the hotel TV service one evening, and 3) the remote control did not work properly; the house-keeper promptly changed it, but the new one was not working properly either. Apart from that, the hotel was perfect. We strongly recommend it for family and business travels alike.",5,2012,04,20
203,This is the place tostay in Dublin - Fantastic service,"The Westbury was the third place we tried after being sick of the Shelbourne charging extra for everything short of the soap, and having to take turns with my wife at getting changed in the Fttzwilliam because the room was so small we couldn't move at the same time, along with being very noisy. I was really surprised, loved the Westbury. Lovely room, terrific service and what a location. The icing on the cake was the bear, My 2 year old boy only sleeps with a certain battered and chewed teddy. It must have been caught in the sheets and was taken out to laundry, a service provided off site by a private company, needle in a haystack stuff. So we were disappointed but no hard feelings, are own stupidity. Anyway about 10 days later a package arrives in the post and carefully wrapped and boxed was the teddy. I can tell you I don't think my son has ever looked happier. They didn't have to do it. So yes the room was great, the food was great, the service was great, but if you want to know why you should stay here instead of the other two and why we won't stay anywhere else now in Dublin, its because of the Teddy!",5,2012,04,20
203,Central Westbury,"The Westbury Hotel is understated Irish elegance a few steps away from Grafton Street and the center of Dublin's attractions.  The hotel is fashionably decorated, and the room gave us enough space, perhaps a bit too much furniture, but the bed was extremely comfortable.  The room also had an American outlet above the desk/vanity.  The only thing I did not like about the room is the shower door; it only covers 1/3 of the bathtub area, so the water splashes on the floor.",4,2012,04,17
203,Very nice hotel,"My wife and I spent three nights at the Westbury Hotel in April 2012.  We had a standard room with a queen bed (room number 410).  The room was nicely decorated and generally comfortable. In fact by European standards the room was fairly large. As is typical in Europe, the bathroom was cramped.  Water pressure was adequate for showering but lacking if one wanted to fill the bath.  Wireless Internet was free but connectivity was dropped fairly regularly.  The bed mattress was very soft, depending on your preference this may be good or may be negative.

The location was perfect for seeing all of the sites in Dublin.  This was our first trip to Dublin so the location was important to us. Our room faced Grafton Street, which was a slight problem the one night the alarms went off regularly in the neighborhood.

As others have noted, staff are very friendly and helpful. Turn down service was appreciated each night. Thomas at the concierge desk was extremely helpful.

The only ""negative"" we can identify was the hotel restaurant, Caf√© Novo.  We only ate there once for dinner and found the service to be disinterested and the food mediocre at best.  My wife had the Caesar salad and sticky ribs. The Caesar salad had no flavor and the ribs were overcooked dry and tough. I had the grilled pork chop. It was cooked properly but very bland.

One word of advice. If you are celebrating a special event like a 50th birthday as I was, you will need to inform the hotel staff if you want to receive the recognition that other reviewers have commented on in earlier posts.  When we landed at the Dublin airport, the customs officer noticed my birthday and wished me a happy 50th birthday. The hotel did not even ask to see our passport which I found unusual for European hotel.

Overall we quite enjoyed our stay at the Westbury and if we return to Dublin will definitely consider returning.",4,2012,04,15
203,FABULOUS,"The Westbury saved my recent trip to Dublin.  After checking out of an overpriced and underwhelming competitor hotel in the city centre, I was bowled over by the Westbury and in particular, their lovely and friendly staff.  Literally every person I interacted with at the Westbury made my stay more pleasant and relaxing.  The location and the facilities are lovely and I was very sad to leave.  A++++ to everyone working at the Westbury.",5,2012,04,14
203,"A splendid hotel with good location, wonderful staff + rooms.","Came to the Westbury after a long flight via taxi. It wasn't hard to spot, with the large ""The Westbury"" sign right in front! Immediately greeted by the bellman who took our (rather large) bags from us and guided us up to reception. Upon check-in we were a little irritated that they only had one room available despite us booking three rooms; after a long flight we were intensely jetlagged and in need of a warm shower! However, staff were reassuring and apologetic, and guaranteed a room within the next two hours. They stored our luggage for us whilst we went to a pub nearby for lunch. I have to admit that the one thing the Westbury has over the Merrion is location - it's right in the heart of Dublin. Though the Merrion is nearby, the Westbury is literally 30 seconds away from Grafton street which I'm sure most know as THE street in Dublin to shop. Also, there are pubs and restaurants right in front

We came back and got our rooms - entered to find a luxuriously comfortable room with all the frills you'd expect of a five star hotel like the Westbury. The beds were comfortable, the staff excellent and the TV extremely large ;). I WOULD ALSO HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE BREAKFAST! For the buffet, to the left were an array of cheeses and cold cuts as well as fruit and yogurt + smoked salmon whilst to the right were an assortment of pastries - croissants etc - and in the centre, cereals, milk, honey and an assortment of juices. However the best part is that if breakfast is included in the room, you get to pick ala carte from a menu; and you get to order a few dishes if you so wish though portions are large. We only stayed there 2 nights and I managed to have the full Irish breakfast and eggs benedict, both of which were wonderful but there were many more things on the breakfast menu which I found to be immensely generous of the westbury in a time where most hotels are offering you a full English/Irish as the only option for a hot breakfast. A little disappointed however that all the other tables were offered toast whereas we weren't ... Really hoping the waiters weren't being a little racist there, lol. 

An evening turndown service is in place where they provide you with slippers and the cutest little bottle of water ever. Room service is a phone call away and the reception are willing to help you with anything. The bathrooms are sparkling and modern (my one gripe being that the glass shield for the bathtub when you shower is a little short hence water tended to splash onto the floor - I'm not a fan of baths and they didn't provide a separate shower) and anywhere with a heated towel rack always wins a little bit of my heart.. Aromatherapy Associates products are provided - including shampoo, conditioner and lotion of course. None of that 'conditioning shampoo' rubbish!

Beyond the breakfast and rooms however, is the magnificent lounge where they serve excellent tea and cakes with amazing service. I could go on and on about how the service within this hotel is wonderful, but I won't because I think I've said enough.

The bottom line is.. stay here. You won't regret it. Worth every penny. HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommended.",5,2012,04,12
203,How to triple charge you to mail packages to U.S.,"On March 4th, 2012 Our party stayed at the Westbury, Dublin Itreland.  The Hotel is very nice, but the service and our first experience in Ireland was less than expected.  Later in the day on the 4th we went shopping in Dublin, and decided to ship our articles back to the U.S.  We told the concierge we were not in any hurry and to ship the CHEAPEST way there.  Well when we checked our bank accounts they had charged each of us $200.00 each for shipping about 2 lbs of good!!! When I emailed them to complain about the charges, he said he was sorry and would reimburse us the full amount and they should have told us the charges upfront before shipping.  Well they ended only reimbursing us $64.99 each instead of the FULL amount they said they would.  I gave up trying to collect the full amount it isn't worth my time, but I think that writing this to trip advisor is more efficient.  I certainly will never recommend this hotel to anyone who visits Dublin!!  It was a bad beginning to an otherwise beautiful trip.  Tom Sweeney",1,2012,04,12
203,Modern and Clean-Right in the heart of Dublin!,"I stayed at The Westbury with a friend, it was our first trip to Dublin and we wanted to be centrally located. The Westbury is clean, updated very nicely and staffed with a gracious and helpful staff. Steps off of Grafton and a few minutes walk to both Trinity and Temple bar areas, and the Liffey. We loved this place and would stay again in a blink.",5,2012,04,12
203,Very noisy and unhelpful staff,I recently had the misfortune to stay in the Westbury and had a room facing the front. The noise from the lane outside was excessive. I had to eventually move rooms it was so bad.I have had more rest in a tent and will never stay there again. The first member of staff I spoke to about it could not have cared less and I needed to get a manger involved to sort it out. ,2,2012,04,12
203,very disappointing,"i recently stayed at the westbury. was given smoking room when non smoking was confirmed. told hotel restaurant closed that evening when it was actually OPEN. had to move tables in restaurant as seating was very dirty. needed advice re wine menu, nobody had any knowledge of any wine on menu even though they sell bottles at 60 euro +!! food very average. gents toilets blocked . definitely not of 5 star quality. great location and staff very friendly but very inexperienced.",2,2012,04,09
203,Really nice hotel- Gluten-Free Afternoon Tea offering!,This is a really nice hotel in a great part of town. I stayed here for a weekend and it was a great experience. A friend and I wanted to do a formal Irish afternoon tea and decided on the Westbury because they have a gluten-free option (same price!). It was great for me and her (as I have a gluten allergy and she doesn't). Great concierge and service.,5,2012,04,09
203,Awesome experience above average hospitality!!!,"We arrived at 6:15 am hours before our afternoon check in and were immediately treated like VIP's.  They explained that our rooms weren't ready but would store our bags and call us when they were ready.  We went to have breakfast and when we were done they said the bill was all set since our rooms weren't ready.  Their location on Grafton Street is amazing and after wandering around for a short time they called to say one room was ready so we could freshen up etc.  When we arrived in the room there was rose petals on one of the beds and a cup cake for someone's bday so we called down to say we think we are in the wrong room but they insisted that we stay there and after the porter brought our bags we were still feeling guilty for all the work someone had done, he called down and they said it was their error and not to make us move.  When he got off the phone he apologized to us for our inconvience (we weren't inconvienced at all they let us check in early treated us to breakfast and let us stay in the room) and asked if we wanted a free drink which we declined feeling too guilty.  Their incredible service continued by nightly turn down service, even leaving a chocolate for our daughter who is studying in Dublin when she stayed with us and taking the time to say hello and ask if there was anything we needed whenever they saw us. Each time we enterred the doorman would greet us and we felt like we were home.  The rooms were very nice with everything you could want and the beds were sooo comfortable.  As far as the location we went all over Dublin and felt the location was central to all of our needs.",5,2012,04,09
203,"Disappointing, won't be going back!","I've stayed at the Westbury before and thought it was a fantastic hotel with a great location, one of the best hotels i've ever stayed at but during my recent stay this week i was very disappointed and will not be returning. Encountered an extremely rude staff member on the door at night and one evening returning to my room when my bed was being turned down I was asked for my key to ensure that the room was mine 'security purposes'!!!!!!! When i complained to the manager I got a very limp apology from the manager and made up my mind there and then I will never stay at this hotel again, not worth 5 stars",3,2012,04,08
203,First time in Dublin...great hotel,"This was our first time in Dublin and I'm delighted that we choose this Hotel. It was in the heart of the city and the customer service was exceptional. From the moment we arrived, our every need was taken of. The room was relaxing and really clean, the bed was really comfortable and we loved the coffee machine in our room. It was a special trip for us and the staff really went the extra mile, even arranging a little surprise for us in our room when we arrived. The chocolates on the pillows were a real treat! I would definitely stay there again on my next trip.",5,2012,04,06
203,Better Than I Expected,"Overall: We stayed here as our last stop before returning to the US.  I was a bit concerned reading people's review (concerned with regards to the size of each room, service in general did not seem to be an issue) but I was certainly not disappointed.  Location is fantastic, right off Grafton Street, and I could understand some people's review that it may be loud on a Friday/Saturday especially if you had a room facing the street.  A bit on the pricey side, but well worth it after our 10 day tour of Ireland.

Check in: No problems, since it was a Wednesday we were able to check in early (our option was by the gym, which we took because we wanted to settle in).  I reserved online on the hotel's website.  I received a call on my cell phone to confirm the reservation one day prior to our stay, but since I didn't have international coverage, I didn't find out until I was home!  

Breakfast:  There was another review stating that the breakfast wasn't worth it since there were several other options available in the area.  We took the reviewer's advice and ate at a cafe off of Grafton (I'm sure much less expensive).

Internet Service: Available, but wasn't flawless.  I had to shut down my i-Pad a couple of times and then reconnect.  It seemed to time out quite a bit.

Room: Stayed in the room right next to the gym, so I think it was 202 or 201.  Keep in mind we only stayed one night, and apparently no one wanted to work out late at night or early in the morning when we stayed.  However, when the maids came in to clean, we could hear the weights clinking so I think it may have been annoying if there was some fitness nut early in the morning (late at night everyone is probably inebriated, so it's okay).  I thought I had read that there was an iPod docking station, but apparently that's only for certain rooms.  But overall loved the layout, had great coffee service in the room, and great turn down service!  

Lighting was good and room temperature was fine.  Newspaper was included in the morning.
 
Shower: This was a shower style that I found common in Ireland.  It had a half door so if I took a shower, it wouldn't splatter water everywhere.  Shower pressure was good and temperature control worked well.   I loved their toiletries, Aromatherapy Associates.

Rates: I reserved on line as an internet special.  Total euros I think was 160, it converted into US$220.  I did have a choice of charging in Euros or US Dollars.",5,2012,04,04
203,Disappointing,"Overall the surroundings and common areas in the hotel are lovely however room was exceptionally small (bearing in mind I think we paid 265 for one nights B&B)..The breakfast was a huge let-down, carvery for a 5 star hotel (not good) and it was actually cold. Staff were not tuned in, took a while to get the attention of anyone to even order fresh tea and no apology even forthcoming for the delay. Didnt have time to seek a Manager out the morning of departure as we had a committment that day that we had to attend however went in the following day and spoke to a Manager , also sent an email...and they really didnt seem terribly interested, just said ""well we'l look after you better the next time you stay"". I thought it was a very very poor response for a 5 Star hotel....",3,2012,04,04
203,Warm welcome at The Westbury,"A very good hotel in the heart of the city. 

Warm welcome with great service. Not at all intrusive. Just right. 

Very comfy rooms - aircon a little loud but you can control it to a lower, quieter setting. 

Great bar with wide selection and good service, even late into the evening. 

All around, a good hotel, I'll be coming back.",5,2012,04,04
203,Superb,"We stayed at the Westbury for 4 nights. This was one of the best hotel experiences I have had. Room optimal,service excellent, staff always friendly and helpful. ""light' breakfast "" included wad just right.Location spot on. Price/quality ratio outstanding",5,2012,04,02
203,would stay again,"class hotel in great location in middle of old city, ambience magic and the service was even better....wish we could have stayed here longer",5,2012,04,02
203,Top Class,"Stayed here a couples of times, very enjoyable on both occasions. Highly recommendable. Last visit was in early March just before St Patricks day. Good location! Great service. A couple of niggles but nothing to detract from the overall quality experience. We booked a suite which was fantastic
Would recommend.",5,2012,03,30
203,Doesn't get any better,"This was a wonderful hotel from the minute our cab pulled up the the front and a wonderful doorman met us.  We were led up to the room, showed how everything worked, got a second luggage rack for our suitcases and anything we called downstairs for.  Each evening (there were 4) we stopped down in the lobby, by a nice young piano player entertaining, for a nightcap.  The first night, I ordered a Southern Comfort sour.  They made it, brought it and waited to check if it was OK.  The next three nights, asked me if I wanted the same, and checked when a new bartender came on.  The last night we ordered a sandwich as well.  I would highly recommend it.  The location is perfect--right in the heart of Temple Bar, the shopping and eating district.  When you want to feel like you're known and cared about, this is your spot in Dublin.  It made our first trip to Ireland special.",5,2012,03,29
203,GREAT HOTEL IN A GREAT LOCATION,"This is a wonderful hotel in a great location.  All your needs are taken care of and although the breakfast buffet is small, you also order from the breakfast menu.  Cooked eggs to order  or omelettes.  Anything you really need.  Top class hotel and wonderful, wonderful location.  The cost is high but well worth the price.",5,2012,03,28
203,Perfect Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Westbury over St. Patrick's weekend in Dublin.  Location is AMAZING just off Grafton Street in Dublin and an easy walk to everything, but tucked off a side street so the hotel itself was extremely tranquil and felt like an oasis from the madness of the St. Patrick's celebrations. 

The staff was courteous and the service was unlike anything I've received elsewhere -- they called me the day before my arrival to confirm my booking, asking when our flight was due to arrive; we were arriving in the morning so they made a note to get us an earlier check-in if possible; also asked if we needed directions to the hotel which I asked about and they gave me details about bus options from the airport.  We arrived at the hotel at 11:30AM on St. Patrick's day so were not surprised they did not have a room ready (normal check in time is 2 or 3pm) - they offered to take my cell phone and ring once our room was ready -- they called only 45 minutes later!  

Our room was spacious, immaculately clean and very comfortable.  Free wi-fi throughout.

A bit pricey (we got a good rate with my company) but worth the splurge!",5,2012,03,28
203,Extream noise and little sleep,"We stayed at this hotel 21-25 March 2012 in room 332 we purchased a rail break from Northern Ireland Railways which incuded travel - On check in at the hotel the receptionist had no reservation for us and attempted to charge us for our accommodation which had been paid previously when we got to our room it was a twin room instead of a queen room we returned to reception where we were given a queen room it is just satisfactory in size however the bathroom is nice but very small the room was clean and bed comfortable and located at the front of the hotel on the third floor the noise from people at the near by bars was abserluty extream we got no sleep before 3.30 am where i except the hotel as no control over whats happening outside i feel no one should be put in these rooms as there is no way guests will get any sleep the hotel must be aware of this i consider this a big negative - we ordered a bottle of wine from room service which was deliverd promptly and with a nice ice bucket we also had afternoon tea in the lovely marble lounge on two seperate occations which was very nice and the service was very good - We had dinner in the Wilde restuarant service was good food was average and on the second visit my partner had lobster which was just terrible at a cost 52 euros and gave her many visits to the loo we made the manager aware of our concerns regarding the standard of this meal he replied the chiefs need more practise at cooking lobster so are we paying for the hotel chiefs to practise the trade this is not good enough the lobster MUST be removed from the menue before someone becomes seriously ill futher more there were only two couples plus us in the Wilde and this was a Friday night and on the Saturday night about 10 couples and frankly i am not surprised as the standards are just not good enough not 5 star - Breakfast was very nice and serice was good we also enjoyed a super table at breakfast on both mornings.
In summary this hotel is nice but the bad out way the good no sleep terrible evening meal and expensive call me old fashioned but its a fail as these are big issues.
my top tip if you have to stay at this hotel do not under any curcumstances except a room at the front of this hotel unless you have a pair of ear muffs and dont eat dinner in the Wilde Restaurant.
We have stayed many times in and around Dublin in the K Club, Powers Court and the Merrion Hotel i have to say the Westbury does not come close.
Disapointingly we can not recommend this hotel we will not return.",3,2012,03,28
203,Wonderful Westbury,"Stayed for a special occasion with my sister. Was made to feel very welcome on our arrival. In fact had a good vibe from inital phone booking with girl in reservations who was warm and lovely.Staff were never overbearing ( which can sometimes be the case in 4+/5 star hotels). Room was great, four poster and spacious. No problem in getting a roll away bed for child.( booked in advance) 

Bathroom was a little disappointing in terms of size and no seperate bath and shower. Otherwise fine. Many of the items listed for the mini bar were not actually in it.  I do believe that at this price bottled still and sparkling water should be provided free of charge in the room.Ordered room service cocktails and wine - both fairly priced.  Returned form an afternoon shoppping to complimentary cupcakes in our room. Nice touch!

Breakfast was ok/ a little disappointing. Nothing exciting in the continental offerings and the Irish Breakfast was a little skimpy ( it included one sausage and one slice of bacon plus other items.) Certainly not worth 25 euro. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel It was just lovely and any small issues above were just that....small issues!!",5,2012,03,27
203,St. Paddy's day Stay,"This hotel was quality all the way.  It has a friendly staff, and comfortable rooms even by European standards.  The hotel has a great location; right on Grafton Street.  The value here is outstanding.  A 5  star hotel all the way",5,2012,03,27
203,"Great location, good service.","Location is everything on a city break and The Westbury couldn't be any better located - a few steps from Grafton Street (and shopping heaven) but it manages to maintain a sense of calm and quiet on the inside. Despite facing one of Dublins most famous bars (Bruxelles) - we had no noise at all during our stay.
The service at the Westbury is very good - but really, no more than what's expected from a 5 star hotel (especially at the rates they charge!).
Rooms are spacious and very well kitted out with super-comfortable beds, tea and coffee making facilities and loads of oversized towels, robes and slippers. 
Given that the hotel is as well located as it is, I suppose the majority of guests want to venture out for breakfast and sample the culinary delights of the city... but (and this is really my only gripe) ... charging ‚Ç¨25.00 extra per person for having breakfast in the hotel is just too much. With the average 'full Irish' breakfast going for ‚Ç¨10.00 - ‚Ç¨15.00 in Dublin city you'd nearly think they didn't want guests to eat in... 
That said, for a special weekend in Dublin and to be close to the heart of all it has to offer - the Westbury is hard to beat.",5,2012,03,26
203,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed here for a city break in March. Nothing but good things to say. Really nice staff, great food,funky bar,brilliant breakfast and the best location in Dublin. I would stay again in a heartbeat!",5,2012,03,25
203,Fantastic,"Stayed here recently for a treat! It was brilliant ! The rooms were amazing, the food in the restaurant was outstanding the cod with the prawn bisque is highly recommended! 

The location cannot get better. The service was very good not too friendly perfectly pitched.

Only problem was the cheap toilet roll in the lobby toilet, it's not really a problem just found it ironic considering it was such a lavish bathroom!

If you can afford it well worth it! Will be coming back soon!",5,2012,03,22
203,The Westbury is just a good hotel in a great location.,"The rooms are comfortable, the service is good without being intrusive and the location is perfect for visiting central Dublin",5,2012,03,21
203,Well run hotel but very pricey. Breakfast exorbitant at 25euro.,Well run hotel which remains busy even these times of recession. We enjoyed our stay as it was a special anniversary. 30yrs.  However even tho the location was perfect as it is so central we found it very expensive. Unfortunately not to be repeated as frequently as we would like because of the cost.,4,2012,03,21
203,Just perfect!,We stayed here for one night sand the only complaint I can make is that we didn't arrange to stay for longer! We're in Dublin all the time for work and for various concerts etc and so have stayed in hotels all across the city. This one was easily the best!,5,2012,03,21
203,"Best location, fantastic service","My best friend and I recently took a girls' trip to Dublin and fell in love with The Westbury. We had booked the Four Seasons initially, but made a last minute change to stay closer in the city, and it was the best decision. When they say they are centrally located, they couldn't be more correct. It's literally facing Grafton Street, the city's main shopping area, with stores, pubs, and restaurants all around. We were within a 5 to 15 minute walking distance from most of the major sites, such as the National Museum of Archeology, Book of Kells in Trinity College, Dublin Castle, St. Stephen's Green, Merrion Square and major churches. We only took a cab twice--for Kilmainham Gaol (the jail) and the Guinness Storehouse (check out the Gravity Bar for the best view of Dublin). It was also perfectly located for the Literary Pub Crawl and our bus trip out to Glendalough (on St. Kevin's bus). For nearly every restaurant and activity, we were surprised by how close we were.

On top of the location, the service was excellent. Really well appointed rooms with two cleaning services every day. The turn-down service made the room warm and welcoming, the beds were extremely comfortable, and we returned to a spotless room every day. The concierge was also helpful, even ordering late-night pizza for us after a long pub crawl. I booked directly through the Doyle Collection website, which gave us the best rate and free Wi-Fi.

Our overall stay was lovely, aside from a couple of small negatives:
- An alarm clock in the room. We had read that there would be an iPod dock/alarm clock, but none were to be found. Fortunately, we didn't realize this until the last day; we had been using our phones.
- The afternoon tea on Saturday had somewhat spotty service. It took over 20 minutes after we were seated to put in our order. The rest of the service however was great.",5,2012,03,19
203,Best hotel in Dublin,I organised circa 100 guest to stay in the hotel for 3 to 4 days as part of our association with an international organisation. People came from all over the world. The hotel was excellent - it deal with the many varied requirement seamlessly and left me feeling very proud.  Teh location cannot be beaten.,5,2012,03,19
203,Nice buzz in a lovely hotel.,"Having gone to college and worked in Dublin city centre, I've always wanted to stay in Westbury. I finally got to stay at the end of January. 
Check Inn was excellent, very friendly and efficient and the chap who showed us our room was very friendly and knowledgeable. We had drinks in the lounge before we headed out for dinner and there was a lovely buzz about the place. The rooms are lovely but not outstanding and the toiletries in the bathroom are fab, also great to have the nespresso machine, it's a nice touch. We could hear the people in the room next door talking and laughing so the walls may be a bit thin! 
Breakfast the next morning was fantastic, we had a window table and I'd have loved to stay another night. 
I'd go back to the Westbury and recommend it, because of it's location and athmosphere.",4,2012,03,19
203,Ideal location while staying in Dublin,"The hotel is located just off grafton street in dublin city centre.  So it's near plenty of shops pubs and histrorical attactions.

I would recommend requesting a room not near the lift and also not near where pubs and restaurants would be working late at night - these do interrupt your sleep.",3,2012,03,18
203,‚ÄúGreat Hotel  for a special occasion‚Äù,"We stayed one night in  The Westbury Hotel ,one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. Every thing was just perfect .Room was lovely and spacious and  clean ..Staff were so friendly and nice .But the big plus was the  Excellent location, shopping at your doorstep . I would recommend the Westbury hotel to anybody that wants an great hotel in the best location in Dublin city .",4,2012,03,17
203,Super service,"Had a rotten journey and when we arrived the staff bent over backwards to make our stay pleasant.  staff were very polite, room was clean and fresh.  Food in the bar was really good",5,2012,03,16
203,Amazing Hotel,"The Westbury Hotel is in the perfect location in Central Dublin. The rooms were well appointed and clean and the accommodations are top notch. The real highlight of my stay was the hotel staff and their dedication to ensuring that I felt at home and all my needs were taken care of. I feel like this kind of customer service is rare in my travels and had to write a review. Manager Najib Majid helped me coordinate with my airline to find my lost luggage and had it delivered to my room. He was always friendly and helpful and his staff displayed the same level of customer service and friendly demeanor. The Westbury is a must stay for Dublin travelers and the price is minimal for the level of service that is delivered. I will definitely stay here in the future and recommend it to anyone that stays in Dublin. 

5 Stars!",5,2012,03,14
203,Relaxing Stay,"We went one night as a girls' night out in Dublin 70th birthday present. The hotel was very central and all the staff were very professional. There were nice touches of offering warm facecloths with a lovely flower on a plate on arrival to freshen up (perhaps a little over-the-top?!!), chocolates on the pillows and slippers on a mat by our beds. We got offered an extra adjoining room, which really made our stay all the more luxurious. A champagne bucket and glasses were left in the room for us, as requested. We all felt spoilt and really enjoyed being pampered for the special occasion. We didn't eat in the hotel, so I can't make any comment on the food. It was very ""posh"" and the beds were extremely comfortable!!!",5,2012,03,14
203,"Great Hotel, still recession proof for a little longer I hope.","I sometimes forget to write a review on hotels, simply because, most hotels are similar according to star ratings. I have stayed in this hotel many times and never thought until now to write something about it and I am going to give you my experience over a year period and 6 stays over a two year period, in a nut shell. On most occasions we got a great room, even an upgrade, straight off the bat, without asking. That's good hotel management as far as I am concerned but its good to know what the smallest rooms look like so you don't get disappointed on a next stay after you have been treated like a king and blessed with the best. OK here we go, first I want to write about something I promised myself to write one month ago when we stayed on our 5th visit. There was a young lady who was serving in Cafe Novo, the bistro of the hotel called Stefania, who did everything in her power to serve the best that the hotel could provide even though my wife and I wanted two different menus. I wanted Chowder and my wife wanted Scones. The Cafe were out of scones but I asked if it would be possible to find some in the hotel. Well off she went and she did everything she could do make it as we wanted it. A big positive for me. Very sweet, very smiley, and very accommodating. She gets the 5 star rating from me. Good work. The English lassy who served us on the 6th visit was also very smiley and good but she brought scones that were a little stale. Just a small negative. We didn't complain because the poor girls were off their feet, (recession short staffing for sure), they did well considering on a positive note.

Rooms are very well set out, nespresso coffee machine in every room, outstanding turn down service, I mean they clean the whole room on the same day and make you feel like royalty, definitely a highlight of the Westbury experience. Im not going to tell you, you gota go for yourself.

OK Pros and Cons

Pros

Great cocktails (expensive but fantastic)
King bed rooms are divine all beds are high standard (I need to stay a few more times for Gold membership to get them all the time on standard room price)
Staff are very good in the majority (recession has kicked in and I can see the change over the 2 years)
Right on Grafton street (your in the zone as soon as you walk out the door)
Turn Down Service second to none (you will feel special so make sure your out when they come)
Great High tea. (Best in Dublin for me, we always have wine at the Shelbourne, look at me dropping names, but high tea is always the Wesbury)

Cons

Pricey (so make sure you ask for the best, then you get the experience you deserve)
No nibbles if you order drinks (Shelbourne is super for nibbles)
Some rooms are small so best go for the upgrade.

All in all a super experience 6 times, and Im gona keep going back.",5,2012,03,13
203,Great City Centre Location,"We had a one night stay at The Westbury before Christmas. From the moment we walked in , we were well looked after and all staff we met went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. The room was lovely - large and comfortable, you could really relax there and forget about the world outside!  The location is great, right off Grafton Street shopping area and close to great Irish pubs and entertainment.  What an oasis of calm and comfort to return to the hotel lobby after the hectic shopping and socialising.... the lobby is always buzzing with people relaxing in the cozy couches, catching up over coffee - it seemed like it was 'the' place to meet up in that part of town. The only issue was the noise of the bin collections on the streets from 4am. I am a light sleeper anyway.  Breakfast was cooked to order - nice touch but a little slow to serve up.  Overall we were well looked after and will definitely return - if you have little time to spend in Dublin, stay here.",5,2012,03,12
203,Excellent Stay,"Excellent stay ,5 star room and staff service ,excellent location in the City Center",5,2012,03,12
203,Great hotel.,"Upon arrival at the hotel we were met by the doorman,car valet, and bell hop. With great ease and professionalism our bags were taken from the car and up to our room and the car whisked away to be parked by the valet. The doorman was very welcoming and guided us to reception. A very friendly member of staff greated us at reception and we were taken to our room.
The room was to the front of the hotel on the 4th floor. There was no noise disturbance throughout our stay and the room was very clean and stocked with all the modern conveniences one could wish for. Houskeeping staff never seemed to be far away and very professional. Indeed we had a birthday cake and card from the management delivered to the room, and we had our bed turned down and rose petals scattered on the bed(great touch)
The two Thomas`s who were the concierges during our stay could not do enough for us. Others could learn a lesson from these two guys. Both a great asset to the hotel, well done guys.
Now the gripes -  well only one really. It is advertised that you can have breakfast in Cafe Novo which is attached to the hotel. We did so on two occassions and both times it really was awful and reflected poorly on the hotel. The food was good but the service the staff gave was dismal. We were a party of four and on both occasions staff could not manage to bring everyones order to the table at the one time. Indeed we had to send breakfasts back and, although the duty manager was very helpful, when the food was reproduced we still had problems, one of which was a hair in the butter. Not a good experience and I would strongly advise others to seek breakfast elsewhere.
Except for Cafe Novo we really enjoyed the Westbury and we have no problem reccommending it to others. This hotel is a great base for those visiting Dublin, the staff throughout were friendly professional and courteous, well done.",5,2012,03,11
203,"Best birthday yet, and only been here 10 minutes",Upon arrival from London the customer service from the front doorman to Laura and the front office team was professional and very friendly. As this was a birthday treat the suite was just bliss. After being in my room only ten minutes I had a knock on the door. I was given a birthday card and cake. Unbelievable customer service. Many thanks to Edward Stephenson and his team. Ive only been here 30 minutes but had to post this. I'm sure my girlfriend and I will have a brilliant 3 nights.,5,2012,03,07
203,Brilliant Hotel right in the heart of Dublin!!,"We went to Dublin for a 2 night weekend break. The hotel was expensive but worth it and as we havent been away since last June we thought it was worth it!! The hotel decor was great, we stayed in a superior room and although the view out of our back window wasnt the greatest, the hotel room was clean and pleasent. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, check in and check out was quick and easy. The room was clean on arrival and was maintained during our stay. Our bedding was even changed for our 2nd night. There was some lovely touches such as chocolate on our pillows. The location was ideal located right near Grafton Street and in walking distance of all the local attractions. The only negative if i can think of any was that the shower wasn't very powerful, there were a couple of stains on the carpets and also a bit of wallpaper had pealed off but this is only if i am been picky. Overall an excellent stay and would recommend to anyone, the hotel was great and Dublin is perfect for a city break.",5,2012,03,06
203,"Excellent time, great Staff.",The staff became aware that it was my birthday and a cake with a candle was sent to our room. For someone over 50 a great surprise. We had a great weekend. Joe Hunter,5,2012,03,05
203,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location","We travelled down to The Westbury for my Wife's Birthday. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, our every need was dealt with by friendly staff. Our car was unloaded and taken to the underground car park, while our bags where taken to our room. The room was clean and very comfortable. Before leaving for Dinner on the first evening a Birthday card with a couple of cup Cakes with candles was delivered to our room and on our return the bed was covered in rose petals with a rose on my wife's pillow. A lovely touch for her Birthday. We had one small negative with the Cafe where we had breakfast. The food was good but the service was very poor. After sitting for 20 minutes before our order was taken, it took another 15 mins before two of our party was served and 15 mins before the other two were served. We complained to a manager stating that we should have been served together. She dealt with the complaint in a professional way and found us before we left to apologise and assure us that the staff had been spoken to and would be monitored. 
Shopping and many great restaurants on the doorstep, we had a fabulous weekend. 
If you are looking for a lovely luxurious hotel with a great location and wonderful staff this is the place to stay. Would highly recommend, from someone who is not always easily pleased .",5,2012,03,05
203,Another Great Stay,"Spent a night at the westbury to celebrate a special family birthday, wonderful  hotel, if location, service and comfort is important then this is the place for you.

From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty thanks Joseph (manager) for your attention and of course the birthday treats in the room. A big thanks also to Najib behind the desk, he was a great help after our late night on the tiles and could'nt do enough for us!!

We will be back.",5,2012,03,05
203,Simply Stunning & Great Location,"My husband and I stayed at the Westbury in January and were extremely pleased.  We arrived early due to our Boston flight getting in at 5:30AM.  While our room wasn't ready, we were given a temporary room to relax and freshen up in.  When we were notified our room was ready, they sent Ashley up to move our baggage to our new room. The new room was simply stunning with great views of the city.  The bathroom was extremely clean with a large shower/tub combination.  The bed was so comfortable- pillows were so amazing that we searched the internet for our own!  We now have the pillows which will allow for a lasting memory of Dublin and the Westbury.  When in Dublin, we will stay here again.",5,2012,03,04
203,Fantastic location and hotel,"Excellent location, parked the hire car for two days as we could walk everywhere. McDaids and Kehoes are outside the door, two of the most famous pubs in Dublin. Great shopping and restaurants at your doorstep. Nice view over the city from the rooms. I really highly recommend the Westbury it helped me to see Dublin in a different light.",5,2012,03,04
203,Worst hotel I stayed in a very lomg time,"My stay in the hotel was as follows.I paid over 200 euros for myself anf my daughter.On arrival at three pm,we were very tired and needed a bath.We had dirty brown/black bathwater which I ran for an hour but I couldnt get any water.we were not able to turn off our telly as the remote was broken.I had to go out as nothing was working I exolained to a staff member and they said they would get maintance on to it.I came back at eight .I got ready for bath to find my daughter 9 sitting in a bath of  black water she thought it wad coloured water the hotel supplied.Got dressed for the second time we went to complain we.received free tea while they tried to find out the problem.The free tea came too late the hotel were aware of this problem when I checked in.If I was made aware I would not habe stayed here.They resolved the issue abd were very nice however this wad all too late.I paid for a room I could not use and had to bring a tired 9 out at night so they could fix it .This was not what we needed we never got to relax or use the riim",1,2012,03,04
203,Excellent Choice,"I enjoyed the Westbury hotel in mid-February on a combination business/pleasure trip. From the outside, it appears a bit non-descript upon approach, unlike hotels with elegant architectural facades. But this is a perfect example of why we should not judge a book by its cover. Once inside I was quite impressed with the facilities, staff and service. The location is perfect - close to the business areas and within walking distance of some very good restaurants and sites. I would definitely stay there again on a return trip.",5,2012,03,01
203,Perfect location,"Location - With Grafton Street as reference, the location is probably the best point of that hotel.

Rooms ‚Äì not as big as a 5stars guest expects, but clean and comfortable mattress. Views are not so nice and you can hear noise through the window. .

Staff - It's not a 5 star with unparalleled service, but is ok. Nothing special.

Restaurants ‚Äì The breakfast was probably the best I have in my vacations, with hot as well as cold dishes, and gorgeous fresh fruit.",3,2012,03,01
203,The Ultimate place to stay in Dublin,"I have stayed many times at The Westbury which never disappoints, from the porter , receptionist, barman, consierage and dining staff everybody is professional , polite and attentitive and strive to make the customers stay perfect.
I would never choose any place else to stay while visiting Dublin.
I look forward to my next visit.",5,2012,02,28
203,Best location. Close to all the action. Walking around the hotel will let you see mostly all of Dublin worthy spots,Rooms are not super. Very small cabinets. Very clean and nicely stocked. ,4,2012,02,27
203,Best location in Dublin,"We stayed here during valentines week, the room was lovely and spacious, clean and nicely decorated. We enjoyed out stay-however breakfast was not included which I felt left the rate expensive . ",4,2012,02,25
203,Terrific Hotel,We have stayed here about 6 times in the past year and have always been impressed by the effortless efficiency and friendliness of the staff. This is not easy to achieve but they manage it. Its a relaxing luxury hotel.Location is perfect for those who need to be near Grafton Street. With the economic slowdown hotel prices in Dublin have become accessible. I hope the Westbury stays within our budget for a while yet.,5,2012,02,22
203,A surprise for my husband!,"We stayed here the weekend of 11th Feb - for 1 night but ished it was many more!!!  We arrived at teh hotel and the concierge took our car and bags, Iw ent upto teh reception to check -in there was a celeb behind me!! Our room was not ready but Joanne the fantatic girl at teh desk took me over to get a tea - we decided on lunch and wait til we were phoned about a room - (tea was complimentary!!).  She was lovely, in fact all teh staff were lovely, polite, no question was too much to ask, there was a slight delay in the kitchen which they were s apologetic for - we were just admiring the view onot Grafton St and happy with our glas of Pino Grigot and a beer - what a way to start the weekend!!!.  I was bringing my husband away for the night - I booked a deluxe room which was gorgeous, so comfy, the bathrom was perfect a walk-in wardrobe with all usual cons!! Full mini-bar and nespresso - for a yummy coffee!!.  With the hotel so central it was perfect to go shopping, go for a drink in the nearby bars and then onto dinner.  I had already booked but we were told the concierge could get a table in most restaurants!!  The breakfast the next morning was delicious and overall I would have to say my stay was fantastic - perfect - only sorry we did not organise our kids so we could have stayed away longer!!!!! perfect for a weekend away - pleasure or business HIGHLY recommended!!",5,2012,02,20
203,"OUTSTANDING, perfect location, beautiful property, helpful staff","We stayed 5 nights.  This is the perfect location to get to everything you would want to see in Dublin.  (We spent a day on each tour: Newgrange, Cliffs of Moher, and Wicklow, I'll post separate reviews.)  In Dublin we use the public bus to Kilmainham Gaol, but walked to Trinity College, Museums, Dublin Castle, Chester Beatty Library (museum), Hapenny Bridge, Temple Bar, etc.

EXTRAS: above the desk there is one outlet for US power (perfect for charging cell phone & camera batteries).  Room had a decent hairdryer (for european standards) so don't bother to pack one. There's a Nespresso machine and 6 coffee pods (just above the mini bar - a previous reviewer couldn't find them), electric kettle, tea bags, milk & sugar.  The beds & pillows are so comfortable!  Our room didn't have much of a view, but we didn't mind.  In the distance we could see the ""business district"" of Dublin.  We didn't hear any pub noise that would keep us up, but some nights we could hear a musician (trumpet) on Grafton Street.  He was good, and it wasn't loud, so we didn't mind.  In the business center area, there are 2 PCs and printers.  We used them a few times (around 5:30 or 7) and we never saw anyone else using them.  

STAFF: pleasant and helpful.  Conceirges Ashley & Thomas assisted us with tours, dinner recommendations and reservations, directions, whatever we needed.  

We used the AirCoach bus to travel from the airport.  So easy!  Take the City Centre bus, for 7 or 8 euros, get off at the Trinity College gate.  Walk up Grafton St, and turn right at Boodles (a jewlery store).  There's the front entrance of the Westbury.  Going back to the airport, walk down Grafton St, turn left at the Molly Malone statue and in a few hundred yards, you'll see the air coach bus stop sign.  Just 7 euros per person.  On a Sunday at 11:30 we were at the airport in less than 30 minutes.  (We could have bought a round-trip for even less, but we weren't sure about our plans).

We did not include breakfast in our rate but it looked lovely.  There are plenty of places just outside the hotel, including Bruxelles (sp?), Bewley's (great spot for a window seat and people-watching).

If you need snacks for your room, walk to Dunnes.  Turn right out of the front entrance.  Turn right at the corner, then turn left (it's in the shopping center).  Groceries are on the bottom level.  As you descend the escalator, you'll smell the bakery before you see it.  It's fine for a grocery store in the middle of a major city.  Bring your own bags (it's a european thing).  

The hotel room rates are a bit higher than some of your other options, but you are paying extra for luxury, including a doorman w/a tophat.  If you don't mind spending a little more, it's worth it.  You'll feel/see the difference.",5,2012,02,20
203,Perfect location for dublin city centre,"We stayed here on a Sunday night as part of an extended weekend break. The location of the hotel is second to none, just 1 minute from the centre of Grafton street. 

The hotel itself is very nice, rooms were very comfortable, although a little on the small side, but that is to be expected given it's city centre location.  The have valet parking, which was 20 euro for 24 hours. We didn't have breakfast, and there are plenty of eateries in the immediate vicinity.",4,2012,02,15
203,"Gorgeous hotel, excellent location","I stayed here in December 2011 as a pre-christmas break away with friends. Arrived at hotel, staff were very friendly, check- in was fast. The room was gorgeous. Very spacious. The hotel is just off Grafton street, prefect location to shops and restaurants. The rooms were quiet and couldn't hear outside considering the location. I had no complaints about this hotel and will certainly be booking to stay here in the furture :)",5,2012,02,15
203,return visit and still gorgeous!,"my annual visit to Dublin to go to the theatre and do some shopping and i can't think of a better place to stay. The hotel is just off Grafton street which has lots of lovely shops and has a great atmosphere plus it is just around the corner from the Gaiety Theatre. 
From the moment you arrive you feel special, the staff are all lovely, they are welcoming and really helpful. We didn't want to linger too long over dinner and just wanted a light meal early in the evening and so were recommended a really nice little bistro around the corner which was perfect. The rooms are delightful as is everywhere in the hotel. Surroundings are luxurious, comfortable and immaculate. Breakfast was sumptuous and service impeccable. There just is nothing to find fault with in this hotel. I love it and look forward to returning.",5,2012,02,14
203,"Fabulous hotel,excellant location","Stayed here recently as a treat to celebrate with my (now) fiance. Upon arrival we were told that we had been given a complimentary room upgrade (which i think my fiance had something to do with!) to a deluxe suite, which was absolutely ENORMOUS!! Giant bed, lovely comfy sitting area with v large flatscreen, big marble bathroom and a separate kids room which we didnt need but was great to see the facilities offered (room had cot, steriliser, chest of drawers, baby changing station). 
 Loved the fact that we had a Nespresso machine in-room but no details on where to obtain coffee for it. We ordered drinks from roomservice, and had a cocktail in the bar before we headed out for dinner in the city.  Both were expensive but what else do you expect from a 5* hotel of this caliber?!
 Our room rate didnt include breakfast but we paid the extra and were so glad that we did, the best hotel breakfast we have ever had.  Cooked freshly to order with a great selection at the continental buffet also.
 All the staff we came across, including doorman, room service, bar staff and wait staff at breakfast were top notch really friendly and professional.  Only downside were front office who i felt were a little abrupt but apart from that we really enjoyed our stay!!  Our room was a little cold but it was so big i wasnt surprised!  Amazing location right in the middle of Grafton St, walking distance to pretty much everything, but there is a taxi rank right outside the front door if you need it! Considering this central location it was lovely and quiet in the room.  Couldnt recommend highly enough to couples, and families aswell!",5,2012,02,10
203,Excellent hotel - but double check your booking details!,"The Westbury is a landmark hotel situated just off Grafton Street. I have stayed here twice and on each occasion I was blown away by the quality of the room and the excellent service. The room-service menu is great and very reasonable price-wise. Not to mention the best coffee I've had for a long time.

This hotel is a bit pricey but the attention to guests' needs is first-rate. Nothing is too much trouble for the wonderful staff - for example, they call to each room to turn down the bed in preparation for bed-time, placing slippers on each side and a little chocolate on the pillow.

The bar and lounge area are a wonderful place to meet friends, or just to chill out. One disappointing element of our time at this hotel was the afternoon tea: nothing special and somewhat ""rough"" sandwiches. Also, the service was a little slow and unresponsive.

Another negative is that on both stays they managed to mess-up our booking arrangements. This required explanations, discussions and delay. Luckily I actually live in Dublin, but I would probably have blown a fuse if I'd been travelling for 10 hours!

All in all a stay at The Westbury is a classy and special experience. Highly recommended.",4,2012,02,07
203,Best hotel in the best location of Dublin,"I definitely recommend this hotel. Do not even spend time for looking any other hotel if you want to be in the very center of Dublin. Best location in town. Noiseless, big and nice rooms, good and polite staff. One of the best hotel I have ever seen. The hotel merit every penny spend. Every attraction is very close to the hotel. Many restaurants, shopping centers, supermarkets and of course very lovely Grafton Street are only a meters away.",5,2012,02,05
203,Lives up to it reputation!:),"I'm Irish and have walked by the Westbury for years, whenever I strolled down Grafton street, but recently I stayed there for a night and was so so impressed. Firstly you can't beat the location. Once you park your car (there is Valet parking if you want it), Dublin is literally on your doorstep. 
Secondly the hotel itself is luxurious without being pretentious. The rooms are a good size (we stayed in a king size deluxe) and surprisely quiet considering the location (we were on 5th floor).
Breakfast was really good with a wide choice between continental and cooked options.There are many deals now, including on the Westbury website, with breakfast included, which I think is a great option in this case. 
We really had no complaints, to the extent we've booked it again for a trip in February!!!",5,2012,02,02
203,Best place to stay in Dublin,"We stayed here for a weekend trip. The hotel could not have been any better and after the wonderful service we received I would not think of staying any where else in Dublin.  

The staff definitely went above and beyond, the service here is definitely 5 star !! I especially enjoyed the cocktails in the marble bar and the nespresso machine in the room was a great advantage.

The location is perfect right in the middle of Grafton street.",5,2012,02,01
203,Always a pleasure staying at this hotel,"I have stayed numerous times at the Westbury over the past couple of years and I have to say that everything about this place is wonderful.

The staff are highly attentive and professional yet with a friendly attitude to everything. The food is wonderful, I highly recommend their breakfast buffet.

Location wise, this is in my opinion the most centrally located hotel in Dublin if you are looking for shopping and nightlife. 

Price-wise it is the upper range but if you are looking for luxury with great service I can't recommend it enough.",5,2012,01,31
203,Love It!!!,"Hi,

I stayed here for my friends 40th birthday about 12 of us came over from england, there wasnt a thing I could fault!!
The hotel bar was really nice and had a great apmostphere, you are a 5 min walk from the main hustle and an bustle of the shops and the night life but also tucked away at the same time. You can sit in the reception area and watch the world go by whilst drinking tea and coffee or having the fabulous afternoon tea! 
The staff were great and we had to have someone open my friends room both days as she is such a heavy sleeper! They found it really funny!! 

We will be back!",5,2012,01,31
203,Well Done Westbury!!,"Just returned from a very pleasant weekend stay, a hotel we've wanted to visit for quite a while but waited until a good deal came along. 
The moment we arrived we were attended to promptly by the valet parking and the reception desk pleasantly surprised us with our rooms being ready for an early check in.
We had friends join us and as it was their wedding anniversary the hotel with the assistance of the hotel manager kindly arranged for an extra surprise for which we wish to thank them very much.
Our rooms were very comfortable, clean and well presented and the extra touches such as an expresso coffee machine, SKY Sports, bath robes & slippers also, complimentary bottles of water and chocolates all added to the whole ""Westbury experience"".
We had a very nice breakfast in the ""Wild Restaurant"" with a fine selection at reasonable prices also, the large lounge arrea up on the first level made for a very relaxing atmosphere.
We've stayed at a similiar hotel not too far away but the Westbury by far provided a much higher level of service and worthy of it's five star rating and ALL it's staff were brilliant for which the hotel should be very proud as other hotels just don't come close to this good all round professional service.
Well done to all at Westbury, WE'LL BE BACK!!",5,2012,01,29
203,Perfect Dublin stay for NYE,"We were looking for a quality hotel for a 2 night stay during new years eve in central Dublin. Our budget was around 400 Euro's for those 2 nights. We anticipated that prices would be high during this time, so we searched around and found that The Westbury had a special offer that matched our criteria.
The location was perfect as it was close to bars, restaurants and the shopping district (Grafton Street). We didn't dine in the hotel during our stay, this was partly down to the fact that breakfast was around 25 Euro's each. There are too many cheaper yet equal quality restaurants and cafe's in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. However, we did have a few drinks at the hotel and they were skillfully mixed. 
The room was large, clean and well decorated. The bathroom was what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The staff were charming and efficient.",5,2012,01,27
203,Excellent Customer Service,"I had a long drive from London to Holyhead and then a three hour ferry ride to Dublin. when I arrived at the hotel I was met by Mr Najib who was at the reception desk. Although check in was at 2pm he allowed us in our room at 5.30am. We were holding a huge event there and the staff was so helpful. 
A fantastic location, beautiful rooms, fantastic reception area with a great restaurant.",5,2012,01,25
203,Great location,"Just back from a very enjoyable stay at The Westin. Staff were very courteous and polite at all times. Room was amazing and generally couldn't fault it. TV in bath area wasn't working nor was it working after we reported it and we didn't get a reason why, but minor detail really. My only complaint was the room service breakfast was overpriced and of poor quality on the first morning of our stay. After offering our feedback to the room service duty manager our breakfast the following day was definitely better, although I still think highly overpriced. The location of the hotel is amazingly central and within easy walking distance of everything in central Dublin. Would highly reccomend and would happily stay here again but go out for breakfast.",4,2012,01,24
203,"Great Location, nice friendly staff, room was only ok","Stayed here for one night last week with my wife. Great location and staff were more than helpful throughout our stay. Our only gripe was the room was a little on the small side for a 5 star hotel, and the carpet was a little dirty and floor in the bathrom was not spotless (may be a bit harsh but it's a 5 star!) Overall had a lovely time and would certainly recommend the hotel.",4,2012,01,23
203,Excellent Hotel,"The Westbury hotel is a gem in the middle of Dublin center.
It is located in one of the main shopping streets of Dublin,also, most of the good restaurants are very close. 
It is guiet and extremely clean! Even if you are looking for for bad things you will not find. People are very helpfull and polite. 
Nespresso coffee machines are in the room, chocolates and water every night in your bed!
I love it! Deffinately you should book a room....",5,2012,01,21
203,Luxury in central Dublin.,"This hotel is located right in the center of Dublin off the main shopping street, Grafton. It couldn't be better located with a myriad of restaurants and bars right on the doorstep. It also has a very nice bar & restaurant within the hotel itself.
The service is truly 5 star from the moment you arrive at the main entrance to the moment you depart.
We had a lovely bedroom, spacious, clean and luxurious.
I would recommend it to anyone visiting the city of Dublin.",5,2012,01,18
203,"Top location, very helpful staff!","This review is long overdue.  I am Irish but live overseas.  When I bring my husband and children home, I don't like to impose all of us on my family.  We stay at the Westbury.  We have been there 3 times in about 18 months and hope to go again in April.  It is a sophisticated city hotel in the heart of a very vibrant city.  It's location is top notch. It is where business people, celebrities, people up from the country come for events, come to stay -  yet is very accepting of children.  When my son became ill with a chest infection, they called the doctor and extended my stay, somehow, despite the hotel going through a very busy and full weekend.
The service and friendliness is hard to beat anywhere in the world.  I would particularly like to praise Ann on reservations, the night manager and the porters/conscierges.  For a central hotel, I found it a lot quieter than my recent stay in central London and central Paris.",5,2012,01,17
203,Great location hotel ideal for business travellers,"The Westbury is located just off Grafton Street, one of the main shopping streets in Dublin.  I found this convenient on my business trip as it was easy to pop out after work to purchase stuff.  An added bonus is Thursday late night shopping.  Various restaurants and pubs are also close by.

The hotel is gracious and has been beautifully and tastefully refurbished. Great service is experienced at most touch points.  The rooms are adequate and a turn down service is available in the evenings.
  
The hotel has a nice breakfast menu.  I only ate dinner once within the Westbury and can recommend the lamb shank at Caf√© Novo.

There is a small gym which is perfectly adequate for an away from home gym session.
Cabs are lined up outside the hotel making transport easily accessible.  The LUAS station is within walking distance too.

All in all I enjoyed my stay at the Westbury.",4,2012,01,16
203,Beautiful hotel lovely room great location but!,"We stayed for one night ,very noisy until after  4am sorry we had not brought ear plugs,it was like as if someone was moving heavy Funiture on hard floor, to clean,
Lots of shouting on the street,I was surprised windows were double glassed, their was so much noise
I had porched eggs for breakfast were very good hubby had full Irish bacon very greasy not 5*",3,2012,01,14
203,Lovely hotel with friendly staff,My friend and I have just returned from a 2 night break at this hotel.  The decor was lovely and the hotel was very clean. When we arrived at the hotel we were welcomed by a friendly porter who took our cases to reception.   Checkin was easy and we were offered hot towels to freshen up which was a nice gesture.  Excellent location near to lots of restaurants and Grafton street shops.   Staff at breakfast were excellent and the cooked breakfast was super   The carpets and decor were bright and cheerful.  Nothing was any bother to the staff.  Would definately return to this hotel.  A taxi is always available outside the hotel.,5,2012,01,14
203,Charming luxurious hotel,"This hotel is smashing! Location could not be better! Full of old fashioned charm , beautifully furnished , opulent but yet totally relaxing , comfortable and the best service available. As soon as we arrived in our car outside we were met by a friendly and courteous member of staff . Check-in was  efficient and friendly and when we arrived at our room it was immaculately clean and had coffee and tea facilities also. We were in Dublin for the horseracing in Leopardstown 28th December and even though Dublin itself was busy , the hotel offered a haven where we sat with a drink in the lounge watching the world go by! It was not our first time there and I am sure it will not be the last; one of my favourite places! Thanks to all the very pleasant staff!",5,2012,01,13
203,"High quality, excellant service.","I stayed for four days on business - very nice hotel in a very good spot. The room was very comfortable. The service was of the nothing is any trouble variiety.

The one minus was the breakfast, which was very expensive, but since you only have to step out of the hotel door and you are tripping over eating establishments this is not a big problem",5,2012,01,13
203,Sentral in Dublin,"Very good. Nice resturant, good breakfast. Walking distance to almost everything you would like to see in Dublin centre. Will use them again.",4,2012,01,12
203,Convenient and darn nice to boot,"Couldn't be more central, lovely reception/lounge area and the staff are professional and experienced. Ended up chatting to one for a while and found out he had worked in several hotels in my home area including one in which my family has a stake. He was not even the head concierge and he still had a professional qualification in hospitality and had worked in 3 hotels I had heard of. 

Rooms are very nice and when I stayed there last year during the big freeze in Dublin they never had a single problem getting hot weather when half the pipes in the country burst.

Surprisingly cheap rates are occasionally available and a weird little pro is that they have the best set of TV channels I've ever got in a hotel.

Only downsides I encountered was that the lounge food menu is a bit limited and it can be difficult to drive to for those who don't know there way around Dublin well. Also the longe staff are easily over-run, kitchen and waiters both.

Oh and Bruxelles outside can on a weekend make sleeping a bit difficult. But then again, this is the flipside of how central it is.

Bar this, top drawer.",4,2012,01,12
203,"Unbeatable location, wi-fi not working, rooms cards not coded correctly","Pros: 
-Great location, about 50 metres from the Grafton Mall (a main retail area).  
-walking distance to museums, O'Connell street (more shopping), Trinity college (with the great old library long room, a must see!)
-lots of restaurants in surrounding streets for dinner (or fast food Burger kIng etc if you prefer)
-hot towels on arrival
-turn down service
-happy and helpful doormen, concierge etc
-reasonable drinks prices in Marble bar (21 Euro for 2 pints of Guinness and 2 Baileys on ice), which is good for 5 star hotel
-complimentary water at night and also ask if you like some when you leave
-free wifi (if it works....more on that below)
-we got a great rate on ""Expedia"" and I dont know if we would have stayed there if we didnt get this rate

Cons:
-stayed 3 nights in 2 rooms (could not get connecting nor adjacent, but initially were at least on the same floor as our teenage children). BUT.....our wifi did not work and only other room was on level 5 and our 17yo & 14yo were on level 2).  Once we moved though, wi-fi was fine
-poor sound proofing of rooms -we could clearly hear the tv next door and it was very loud 
-after moving rooms at 10.00pm at night, we got new coded keys for the new room, but each day they didnt work and we had to go to reception and have them recoded",4,2012,01,11
203,Fantastic stay & location,"Up in Dublin with my partner for birthday treat stayed in your hotel and had a very enjoyable stay. Lovely surprise to be upgraded on arrival. The room we got was just lovely and the service from all staff - friendly doorman to a very helpful room maid who immediately gave us extra towels on request. Breakfast and dinner in Wilde restaurant was just what I expected from a five star hotel.the other bonus for us was car parking facilities, it was great to be able to forget about our car while we were in the centre of the city. We will definitely return when up in Dublin.",5,2012,01,10
203,Need to go back soon.,"Have stay at The Westbury on many occasions.
It is truly a gem. Excellent location just off grafton street. Beautiful hotel, wonderful friendly staff and underground parking.
Ticks all the boxs !!!!",5,2012,01,09
203,Terrible experience,"We stayed in The Westbury hotel on 6th of January 2012. The hotel wasn't up to the five star standard - at the room- carpet full of stains; there were marks on the walls, doors; bed linen had stains on it and it wasn't made properly; the chair cover was dirty; mirrors in bedroom and bathroom wasn't cleaned properly; bins were not polished/cleaned properly; toilet wasn't bleached for a quite long time (u could see black dirt under rim); shower/bath controls wasn't polished; shower doors with water marks; soap dish not clean; glasses in bedroom and bathroom had finger prints/water marks on them; bathrobes were different and wasn't presented nicely (one had logo on it, the other hadn't)...Oh and the remote control for TV was working from very short distance only, which was annoying (batteries needs to be replayced)... 
After seeing all that we went to the reception to complain, we even handed a list with what was below standards. The girl at reception apologised us and asked if we want to move to another room, but we did not want that, just asked her to make sure that someone would come to the room to clean it properly. Then we were offered complimentary coffee at the marble bar until it will be sorted out.
After a cup of coffee we went out to city and came back after 3-4 hours and found our room exactly the same as we left it! Anyways, we didn't bother going to reception again, as our stay was ruined allready... 
Later on we've got a card under door thanking for providing detailed feedback on our bedroom and that Assist. Manager would like to discuss it with us... We were shocked and decided that its not worth it, as the hotel dont care about their guests...
Public area toilets were badly looked after - one toilet was blocked, in another ones there were pee everywere. Corridors were dusty...
Now the staff... no eye contact, no greeting - girls passed us talking their own language like we were invisible- u feel like u're not supposed to be here...
We can agree with the other guests reviews about the attitude to younger people (we are in our 20s), as u can see u are being treeted diferently from other (older) guests..
The Wilde restaurant - the receptionist had a broken english and neither could understand us, nor we could understand her :)) The desert and service in the restaurant was superb, though it took a while to get someone to bring us a bill (there were 4 couples in total in the restaurant at the time and 5 staff members..). 
We had our breakfast in room - it was nice, just the juice wasn't fresh as we expected..
To sum up - we will never consider coming back to the westbury again, as its standards and service isn't 5 stars for sure (except the pricing haha). 
Having in mind that all that happened on a REALLY QUIET period when most of hotels are empty (westbury was not an exception), I cant imagine how are they on a summer time.. BEWARE!",1,2012,01,08
203,"Comfy, Cozy and Refined","We stayed at the Westbury for our Anniversary, as we were returning to NY from the Isle of Man. I researched on Tripadvisor which 5* hotels would be the best for us.  Value, comfort, space and location. We were not disappointed in our choice. 
I nearly considered the Shelbourne, but the rooms are quite small and more expensive.
We arrived 7 hours late, due to Aer Arran cancelling our flight and reception gave us a nice upgrade to a King Deluxe room at the end of the hall. I booked a queen.  The room was VERY large, bed was so comfortable, bathroom was spacious, clean and had a great tub.  I liked the ""no steam"" mirror.  The only minuses...were. Our room was cold, i requested a heater the 2nd night, which made the room a normal temperature.  Also...the large window creaked when there were gusts of winds, which kept my husband up the first night. A few extra Guiness's the 2nd night...we didn't hear a thing. We also heard a humming noise after 1am, which i thought may be a generator but the 2nd night i didn't notice. We were on the 4th floor.
Whenever we called the front desk they were very accommadating and polite. Staff in general were sweet and friendly. Concierge was helpful in choosing a cute restaurant for dinner.  The Breakfast in morning at Wilde Restaurant was expensive, but..I felt like i was getting the real Irish experience with comfort. The 2nd morning we went to Bewley's which was only 10Euros each, but not as tasty as the hotels food.  

The location was perfect! We walked around Dublin for hours and even stopped back at the hotel for tea.  The service for the tea was a bit slow...but i think tipping isn't common, so they aren't as attentive as in the US. Or...they were limited with staff.

Pub/Bar wise...we went to Market Bar, Nearys and Buxelle's (which is steps from the hotel and we felt like we were experiencing proper Irish pub life). 

I would recommend this hotel to everyone that asks.",5,2012,01,07
203,A lovely experience before Christmas,"My husband and I  stayed in  the Wesbury  in December for one night only. It was our second time staying there we thoroughly enjoyed it.  From the time we entered the hotel we were greeted by courteous and pleasent staff.  The room was very comfortable and had a lovely view out towards Grafton Street.It is so central and convenient to the shoppping area that is makes it the perfect place to stay. .We enjoyed a few drinks in the lounge before retiring to bed, the place was  busy and the atmosphere was very seasonal.
The only negative point was  I found the lighting in the bathroom wasn't great especially for doing ones makeup, a magnifying mirror would have been helpful, must remember to bring my own next time.

203,A wonderful stay at the Westbury,"My husband and I stayed at the Westbury for 2 nights to celebrate my 30th birthday.  I had high expectations after reading the reviews here but the Westbury exceeded them all.  Of course at a 5* hotel you expect the important things - clean comfortable rooms, great service, etc - to be done well and they were, but it was the many little things that made our stay a great experience.

We arrived quite early to check in and my husband mentioned it was my birthday so we were offered a room upgrade - not just to the next type up but to the one above that, which I think was a studio suite.  The room wasn't quite ready so we went to explore the city for a while, and they called us to let us know when the room was ready which was a nice touch.  There were many other little touches like this throughout the stay - hot towels at reception, turn down service with chocolates in the evenings, offers of help with our bags, and every member of staff we met was polite and friendly.

The suite itself was fantastic - very large with amazing double windows overlooking the city, nespresso coffee machine, bathroom with double sinks, powerful shower and full length front and side view mirrors - perfect for getting ready to go out.  The mirrors were even steam-resistant - I didn't know such a thing was possible!

Our rate included breakfast which was very good quality - I had the smoked salmon and scrambled eggs one morning which was really tasty.  Again, the service was excellent and the choice of food was very good, plus the Wilde restaurant was a very elegant setting.  We also had tea and cakes on my birthday in the Gallery which were delicious and felt very decadent!

The only not-quite-perfect things about our stay were that the bed, while luxurious, was a little too soft for my taste, and we found using the TV in the bedroom a bit hit and miss because the remote didn't work very well and the guide to channels wasn't correct.  But these things didn't spoil our stay.

The location is, of course, perfect for seeing everything Dublin has to offer.  And while the hotel is quite expensive, it was one of the lowest prices 5* hotels we looked at (we paid 199 euro per night), and for us it was well worth the money.

I am already looking forward to going back to the Westbury!",5,2012,01,05
203,New Years Eve,"My wife and I returned to the Westbury to celebrate our first anniversary on New Years Eve. We had a fantastic couple of days in this wonderful hotel. We were made to feel as special as we were the previous New Years Eve at our wedding. All the staff are fantastic, so helpful and friendly. We were also treated to an upgrade on arrival, a beautiful suite overlooking Grafton St. We had dinner in Wilde which was delicious. The complimentary glass of bubbly was another nice treat.

After dinner we went to the downstairs bar - Nova. There was a really good atmosphere with a DJ spining some good tunes and the cocktail menu was very reasonable. When we got back to the room there was a personalised message from the General Manager together with strawberries and chocolates. Perferct end to the perfect day.

The following morning we explored the Dublin (the pubs) on foot from this wonderful city centre location.

All in all we had a most wonderful trip and we're really looking forward to our return in 2012.",5,2012,01,05
203,New Years Celebrations at its finest...,"My fianc√© & I stayed here on New Year‚Äôs Eve & had the most perfect stay. We pulled up outside the front doors & had our car taking of us & parked by the bell boy while another took our bags to our room while we were checking in. We were given hot towels to freshen up & given all the information we needed to know about the hotel. Our room was spotless clean & warm & cosy. Espresso machine in the room is a nice touch, just what I needed after a hard days shopping in Brown Thomas sale :-)  The interior of the hotel is just fabulous. So classy & luxurious. Friendly staff everywhere in the hotel always willing to help with any questions or queries. We had drinks in the Marble bar during the day & then again in the evening to bring in the new year, it was such a lovely relaxed atmosphere. The only thing I don‚Äôt really agree with is the car park charge, I do think if you‚Äôre a staying guest car parking should be free. This was my first time staying at The Westbury & it certainly won‚Äôt be my last. Cannot wait to return in the summer :-)",5,2012,01,05
203,New Year family stay in Dublin,"I booked this as a retirement treat for the family.  We did a normal room for the children and a deluxe one for ourselves.  It was a little confusing at check in and off to our rooms we went.  After visiting the children's room it was obvious that we also had a standard room.  I only went to complain on the second day out of three and received an apology and a room change offer or a change of rate to the same as the other standard room.  I opted for the rate change.  Whilst the staff were very accommodating throughout our stay the point in this entry is that had we not had a room to compare with we could well have been charged for the superior room.  I have been promised 'special treatment' should we return.
The hotel is excellently placed for walking out to anywhere in the city.  We only had one afternoon tea and it was well served and in a nice setting.  The breakfast price is high at over 25 euros when just outside is Bruxelles with breakfast at 10 euros.  I am sure the setting at the hotel will be much much higher though.
The bathroom was a little small and both taps had 'cold' on them.  It was obvious that a previous occupant had smoked in the room as there was cigarette ash on the carpet below the window opening.  But apart from that it was very comfortable.
We would return should we want to treat ourselves despite the shine being taken off this special visit.",4,2012,01,02
203,"Amazing hotel, great staff, highly recommend","I stayed here a few days ago for a few days, location is fantastic, staff couldn't do enough. I had breakfast in the mornings which was fantastic. Hot food made to order and a very high standard.
I will stay again and again",5,2011,12,31
203,Nice but could be little better for price,"Its sound rather negative but really the only negative was the price when you add in breakfast and parking its expensive stay and we only booked a queen room but still its one of the most expensive hotel stays we have had and we recently had a five star stay in madrid for a fraction of the cost but the actual room size was far superior.  The location of course is fantastic and the overall atmosphere at christmas is just super. However we went down to the bar for a drink and the place was heaving with shoppers and day trippers and we were left standing for over an hour waiting for a seat. We had to approach a waiting/line system to sit in the main foyer and while they tried to be as accomodating as possible I really feel they should seat their paying guests first or at least have reserved an area.  However the hotel was full to capacity so I assume this limited the seats available throw the christmas time buzz on top of that and it was a too packed and extremely loud.  

The breakfast was ample but again 50 euro for two people is just still a celtic tiger rip off. It was a special occasion which my husband booked otherwise I would not have opted for the bed and breakfast.  The room we had was a little small but the bed was very comfortable and pillows too.  The toiletries were very nice and the turn down service was also good, asked did we need extra towels etc.  The espresso maker in room nice touch.  Overall we did enjoy the stay but I would not stay again unless they were offering a very competitive price.",4,2011,12,28
203,"Super location, comfy beds, lovely rooms","Excellent service always at The Westbury.
From the valet parking to the check in hot towels. Returning customers are appreciated, which is nice. Sumptious breakfasts, Nespresso in the rooms & lovely Acqua di Parma toiletries.Excellent for business travel or pleasure.",5,2011,12,27
203,Top Location,"Location is tops for shopping, dining out when visiting Dublin. The majority of tourist hotspots are within easy walking distance. The room and bed were very comfortable. This is our second stay and our room this time better located as the noise from neighbouring bars disturbed our sleep on the first trip. We didnt have breakfast but lots of places to choose from in the area and a lot cheaper! Would recommend and will return but will request a room further away from bars.",5,2011,12,21
203,2nd Visit did not disappoint,"We stayed in the Westbury last weekend ( 16/17 December 2011 ) and had a fantastic time.
we had a beautiful room, the bed was so comfy.
The hotel was very busy due to the Christmas shopping/party season but the staff went out of their way again to accomodate all our needs.
family met up with us on the 2nd night in the lobby for drinks and food. As the hotel was full to capacity, there was a queing system for seats in the lobby/bar. The staff were very helpful in accomodating us with a seating area.
We checked out on Sunday morning with ease and the concierge held onto our bags when we went shopping again before our journey home.
i highly highly recommend this hotel.",5,2011,12,20
203,Wish We Could Have Stayed Longer,"My family and I stayed here one night in November and were extremely happy with our stay.  The hotel has an ideal location, on a quiet small street just off the heart of Grafton Street, within easy walking distance to shops and restaurants and Dublin's central sights.  (The only hard part is trying to find the hotel by car, due to Dublin's one-way street systems, but it is worth the effort.)

After circling the streets of Dublin by car, we were greeted upon arrival by a very friendly and helpful valet.  The entrance and lobby are OK (maybe a bit dated?), but we really loved the rooms, which were decorated in a luxurious, contemporary style.  Spacious enough for our family of four.  Two queen beds were large, plush and comfortable and the bathroom was also roomy (double sinks), beautiful and spotless, and featured high-end amenities (Acqua di Parma shampoo, etc.).  The room also had an amazing Nespresso machine for complimentary espressos and cappuccinos (could be dangerous!).  Good free wifi.  

Only downsides to consider were the 20 euro daily parking fee and some muffled noise in the hallway at night.  But, I would still stay here again and recommend the hotel without hesitation.",4,2011,12,12
203,Nice but nothing to rave about,"This hotel has a perfect location for shopping and visiting Dublin centre. The hotel was good but not the best, the staff were great. Put us in a non smoking room that smelt of smoke and had to wait 15 minutes for someone to come with a key card for another room. The room was average, the robes were grey and very uncomfortable, the bathroom was small with lots of glass and chrome to make it look bigger, the make up mirror was far too high to use and I am average height and the lighting was inadequate to use to make up. The breakfast was very poor for the money they charge (ours was included in our rate) and we had to wait 15 minutes from ordering it. The orange juice has a strange smell and taste, think they must have had a bad one in the batch, but the manager tired to tell me it was because it had the ""bits"" in it, I wonder how many other guests the perceive to be stupid? I feel bad complaining as we had a discounted rate but feel I have to tell it as it is. Car parking is convenient as they valet park, but of course the charge is ‚Ç¨20 overnight but there areother car parks fairly close which are cheaper.",4,2011,12,09
203,Spoil yourself.,"Very attentive and friendly staff, great location, great room. Basement car park- loved the breakfast, wife didn't. Hotel spotless and a great place to relax and watch the wold go by.",5,2011,12,09
203,It was ok..............,"Hi,
The Westbury is a beautiful hotel.... please don't get me wrong....it is just..... well..... I just felt that I have spent less money staying in hotels & b&b's before and received better service and stayed in better rooms.......I do not know if I am being too harsh.... however..... my wife and I just did not feel it was value for money......great location though........
Enjoy! :)",3,2011,12,05
203,"Perfect location, loved the bellmen","We spent a week at the Westbury over Thanksgiving in an upgraded room.  Overall, it's a solid international hotel - no ""wow"" factor in any aspect but a few bits are worth mentioning.  As other reviewers mentioned, the location can't be beat.  Right off Grafton Street but still blessedly quiet.  My husband loved the great lounge and could often be found there having a drink or coffee accessing his newspapers from the free (but slow) wi-fi.  

In both the lounge and the bar, I had the sense the hotel was understaffed for the holiday rush.  And how can a bar run out of olives?  Once we gave up and went elsewhere for our pre-dinner drink.  

The least senior of the staff were the most impressive - the maids were sweet and unobtrusive and the doormen were all charmers - happy to chat, eager to be of service and always willing to provide a bit of advice on the day's adventure.  I recommend the hotel put them in charge of the bar...",4,2011,12,05
203,Exceptional Service,"I have been traveling to Dublin several times a year for more than 15 years and have stayed at almost all of the major hotels in the city.  However, none can compare to the Westbury.  It is simply the best without being the most expensive.  While the location and decor are second to none, the real difference is the superb level of service.  Najib Majid, the front desk manager, is especially gracious and professional in dealing with sleep deprived American business travelers, a rare combination of attentiveness and old world charm I have been traveling to Dublin several times a year for more than 15 years and have stayed at almost all of the major hotels in the city.  However, none can compare to the Westbury.  It is simply the best without being the most expensive.  While the location and decor are second to none, the real difference is the superb level of service.  Najib Majid, the front desk manager, is especially gracious and professional in dealing with sleep deprived American business travelers, a rare combination of attentiveness and old world charm.  The Westbury wins every time.",5,2011,12,05
203,Still my fave in Dublin,"Despite the plethora of upscale hotels that opened in  Dublin during the roaring of the Celtic Tiger, the Westbury still keeps my business.  The location couldn't be better, of course, but it's the overall vibe that keeps me coming back.    The rooms are pleasant, the beds comfortable, the wireless connection free and good, the gym basic but functional (and discounted passes to a more elaborate facility across the road on Clarendon St are available to guests if you need more).    There is just enough service to keep me happy, with newspaper delivery and turndown service, including a chocolate on the pillow, and I like being able to slip in and out of the hotel unnoticed using the entrance on Clarendon St.  Room cleaning is never done at an uncivilized hour (not before 11h30 in my experience) and the maids cleaning the vacated rooms at an earlier hour are quiet and respectful of the guests who are still resting.   

One could lose a whole day lounging around the Gallery with a pot of tea or a glass of wine while looking out the window.  I never ate dinner in either of the evening restaurants.  The breakfast buffet is ok, though I prefer scones & tea in the Gallery (sadly the complimentary breakfast in the Gallery for residents has been discontinued).    I totally enjoy staying here.  My only gripe is the poor soundproofing between rooms.  This could be alleviated by putting a ""governor"" on the volume of the TVs to prevent users from exceeding low volumes.  As it is, if you have an inconsiderate room neighbor your peace will be disturbed.",4,2011,12,03
203,Just OK.,"We stayed here for three nights in July. The hotel is located in a great area, and is accessible to shopping, touring, restaurants, etc. by foot. The rooms are very small, but that is normal for European standards. The room was very clean, and comfortable. The shower tub was really high and it could be dangerous to step out of it for those who are older. There was nothing that I would say stood out about the hotel and would persuade me to come back. Service was adequate. The morning we were checking out it was such a long process, we couldn't get an elevator because they were all occupied, and when we went to the desk there was chaos, with people everywhere. It took us about an hour to check out.",3,2011,11,29
203,Top class service,"I have stayed at the Westbury for my anniversary over the past three years and every time it just gets better. From the moment we arrived the staff were excellent, from having my car parked on arrival to the room facilities. 
The staff were excellent, helpful and always professional. 
Excellent location just off Grafton street so easy for shopping and resturants. 
Will stay again and again
Well done to the Westbury for a consistently exceptional service",5,2011,11,27
203,Lovely hotel but a few small glitches developing.,"Stayed recently overnight for function. Chaos at arrival due to the limited space out front for more than three cars arriving and the long taxi rank occupying entire parking lane. Concierge staff busy but friendly and accomodating. This was our third stay in the past year and the hotel was full, however telling patrons that delays at check in etc were due to ""being very busy"" really should not enter into the vocabulary of five star hotels, especially when patrons are paying 259 euros a night. That aside though staff were always courteous friendly and obliging.
No water, fruits in room as mentioned by a previous reviewer. No paper appeared in the morning. Plenty of sweets and turn down service ensured plump slumber!! 
The hotel is obviously catering to the international visitor but may be loosing some of its charm and warmth.
It is still the best location in dublin for city shopping and night life access. Will probably stay again but not so sure about it being my first choice of five stars in Dublin.",4,2011,11,26
203,"Great location, big suites, excellent staff","Stayed here on a Birthday treat weekend. Generally difficult to fault apart from noisy outside, from hotel business, like trash collections at 3 in the morning, and very thin walls between rooms but generally a great place to stay, right in the centre, nothing too much trouble for the staff, and Pretty good value.",4,2011,11,26
203,City center luxury,"I was greeted by the manager who happened to be at the hotel when I was checking in. Mr Stephenson was the perfect host and made sure that absolutely everything was spot on. My room was fantastic and very reasonable priced. The staff were so helpful and accommodating, nothing was left to chance. Well done to all involved and I will be back with my wife in the very near future.",5,2011,11,26
203,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed on a one night package called Wilde and Stay. Dinner in Wilde restaurant was brilliant. Best meal ever. Quality food and very attentive service. Room was compact but very comfy bed and lovely toiletries. One small complaint, maybe you should get some new fluffy towels. The ones in the room were a little thin and worn for a 5 star hotel. The location of the hotel so close to the main shopping streets was brilliant. I will definitely stay again. ",5,2011,11,26
203,Lovely Hotel but a quite a few let downs!,"I booked the Westbury hotel for a surprise birthday treat for my Mum and as we had stayed there previously,we were naturally expecting great things that we had experienced before. We were travelling with my Granny as well. We didn't check in until about 4:00,as we had been shopping earlier in the afternoon, however when we finally got to our room,what a FREEZING cold reception we received! We had to keep our coats on For at least 1 hour and after 2 phone calls to ask for some heat source,we got it sorted,but not the welcome you expect to receive in a 5* hotel!! 
The General Manager,Joseph Downing,was very helpful,can't fault him in the slightest. He really did go out of his way to try to improve our general experience... Full credit to him. A few other issues such as no tea in room,mini fridge was absolutely disgusting with a smell like mouldy cheese or milk,Nespresso Krups Machine didn't work at all - only produced Cloudy water and no rubbish bag to dispose of waste. It was little things that ruined our stay however you still get The feeling your're in a 5* hotel in some areas. I wouldn't rule out staying again but I would like a LOT more attention to detail in the rooms and also to rectify other issues. As I said can't speak highly enough of manager,he did his best to rectify situation he was unfortunately put into,due to his colleagues carelessness!!
I hope they take note for next time!",4,2011,11,26
203,"Great location, enjoyable stay","The Westbury is a very nice hotel with a great location just off the main shopping area on Grafton street. The interior and lift are decorated to a high standard without being over bearing. The room is adequate with a nespresso machine and 6 capsules (3 different choices with 2 of each, I did not experience any problems with restocking of the capsules) and there is an electric kettle to boil water for tea although the tea selection was not particularly to my liking. Robes and slippers are provided along with an array of products in the bathroom (bar soap, moisturize, body scrub, shampoo and conditioner). The flat screen has a wide selection of channels (BBC, Sky - both news and sports, local, CNN, CNBC, etc.) and next to the bed are both standing table lamps as well as reading lights. A turn down of the bed is provided along with chocolate (not really to my liking but how could Irish chocolate ever match that available in my country of residence, Belgium?!), nice but not necessary for me. A small bottle of water was left in my room each night and I was given one at check out. The fitness room is small but adequate (it is cool but the temperature is good once you have started working out plus water is available) especially since when I used it no one else was using or came to use the facility. I only had the continental breakfast in Cafe Nova which was good but nothing great, best to ask for the brown bread then you are given some nice Irish bread. All in all I found my stay very enjoyable, it is true you do not get fruit but I am not one that needs such things nor do I really need people to carry my bag(s).",4,2011,11,25
203,Not up to standard,"The Westbury has all you would expect from a 5* hotel - classical music in the lifts, chocolates on the pillow after turndown service, warm hand towels on check in etc etc but it is lacking something. As others have said, there was no complimentary water or fruit - our tea and coffee did not get restocked the following night's stay. The noise from outside is bearable but annoying - a hotel of this standard could improve their sound-proofing, surely? And the internal walls (as other have mentioned (!)) are extremely thin. Don't get me wrong - if you are unused to 5* hotels in then this will seem luxurious - my travelling companion was very impressed, having never stayed in such a high end hotel before. However, I can't help but feel there is a lot that should be improved not only for the price they charge but also to match the standards of other similarly rated hotels. We also suffered from being 'room carded' as we tried to get back to our room after dinner out - we were the only guests to be asked for this and I have to say I agree with the review below that the inevitable conclusion to draw is that we were considerably younger than the other guests and so possibly were automatically viewed with suspicion by the night porter...",3,2011,11,22
203,Will definitely return!,"My husband and I decided to spend one night in the Westbury Hotel in Dublin on Sunday night and from the minute we arrived the 5 star experience washed over us! From the valet taking our car and parking it, to the complimentary upgrade we received to the wonderful friendly staff; the decadent surroundings..... it was just a superb stay from begining to end. The only bad thing about our stay was that we had to leave..... We will definitely be returning as possible!",5,2011,11,22
203,2 Night Stay,I trated my wife for our 30th Wedding Aniversary the manager threw in breakfast both days in the 169 euro price made our stay unforgettable,5,2011,11,21
203,Really nice stay just one let down,"I stayed in the Westbury with my husband to extend the Ireland Bank Holiday Weekend on October 31st this year.  The first thing is the decor the staff and the ambience were wonderful, we were a little late arriving and deciding to have dinner in the cafe nova (this may be spelt incorrectly) downstairs as there was a football game on and the atmosphere was relaxed, the starters and desert were good but the main course and the service were a real let down.  On the other hand the breakfast in the main restuarant was wonderful as was the service; and all the staff at all times were absolutely exceptional - particularly reception, and the concierge.",4,2011,11,21
203,The Westbury - Excellent,"We stayed at The Westbury Dublin in July to celebrate my birthday. 

The proximity to the city centre was one of the many reasons we chose to stay at this hotel, on arrival we were promptly checked in and directed to our room which was of a very high standard and had an excellent view of the City. 

There isnt much to say about this hotel which hasnt already been said, the breakfast was of a great standard and had everything you could ask for and more. We also ate at 'Wilde' the restaurant one evening and this was a truly excellent meal in every way, however it was a shame the restaurant was more or less empty which if I am being very picky didnt give it much of an atmosphere (especially when compared to other excellent restaurants for atmosphere and food within 5 mins - Drury Street)

The only minor issue was the Nespresso machine in the room did not work, I reported this to reception and they advised someone would be up in 15mins, a few hours later nobody had arrived, I called again and was advised they would send someone up....Yet again this didnt happen, it is a shame I have to mention this, it was the only negative whilst at The Westbury and I certainly would stay here again if I went to Dublin. 

All things considered an excellent hotel in a great location in a wonderful city!",5,2011,11,21
203,Can a hotel be five star yet homely?,"If you stay at The Westbury then the answer is 'yes'. Friendly and efficient service starts at the underground car park (bit dear at ‚Ç¨20 per night), and the offers to take one's bags at every turn. My daughter and I stayed last week for a 2 night shopping and museum/art gallery trip. I had stayed in the Westbury many times in the past and was interested to see that the decor, general maintenance, service and standards had not  decreased in any way. Our room was comfortable and well stocked with everything you could need (including crystal glasses and a super coffee-maker). Breakfast was unremarkable but adequate and breakfast service was impeccable. Location is perfect for shopping, sightseeing etc. Our room was at the front and there was a little noise from the pubs, but this is the city centre so some noise can be expected - we slept well in our comfy beds. Overall a lovely, lovely hotel - stay much enjoyed by us both.",5,2011,11,20
203,Excellent hotel!,"My husband, sister and niece were very impressed with the hotel. We went to Dublin for a weekend trip and stayed there for two nights. The service was outstanding and the rooms are very nice. Having never been to Dublin before, we were very happy with the location of the hotel as it was very close to Grafton Street and other main attractions in the city centre like Trinity College and Stephen's Green. We  loved Cafe Novo which was on site and also enjoyed having breakfast at the hotel where the food and the service were excellent.",5,2011,11,20
203,The Christmas festivities have OFFICIALLY started,"I was in Dublin City Centre last night (18 November 2011) to meet some friends for a long overdue reunion not realising in advance that Michael Buble was going to be on Grafton Street to turn on the Christmas lights.

We had booked a table in a city centre restaurant for dinner and once we vacated our table we decided to go for a drink. Dublin City Centre was very busy and we had trouble finding somewhere suitable to go to continue our conversation. We ended up going to the Westbury Hotel and were delighted with the choice we had made. The hotel is tastefully decorated and as soon as one walks into the foyer you know that Christmas has officially started.

We went to the Marble Bar and enjoyed a couple of glasses of wine and some nibbles. The Marble Bar was an oasis of calm in an otherwise noisy and very busy City Centre. Of all the choices we had available to us last night we made the right decision by going to the Westbury Hotel!",5,2011,11,19
203,"Excellent Hotel, Fantastic Location. Perfect for Our Honeymoon!","We went to Dublin on the second stop of our honeymoon after the Maldives.  We stayed at the Westbury Hotel for 3 nights and it was a beautiful stay.  I reserved via American Express Platinum's Fine Hotels and Resorts Program and it was worth every penny.  

Service was great, the gents at the concierge were extremely helpful in particular.  The room we had was on the top floor and it was beautiful.  Contemporary, clean and had all the necessities one would need.  Location was absolutely perfect for a first-time visitor to Dublin, right next to Grafton street with shops and restaurants, and within minutes walking distance to all the major tourist attractions.  

The other hotels I considered were the Merrion (but it was just too old and rooms were too small for our preferences) and the Four Seasons (but it is too far from the main area).  The Westbury Hotel is definitely worth serious consideration for anyone looking for a top-tier luxury hotel in Dublin.",5,2011,11,19
203,What a great hotel with a great location,"My wife and I were on a vacation/business trip to Irleand in early September.  For the last 2 nights, we stayed at the Westbury Hotel.  We have stayed there before and it was great to see that the quality of the hotel and the service didn't go down.  It has a great location next to Grafton Street and with in walking distance of many of the attactions in the city.  THis trip we stayed in a suite and it was a great experance.  The staff is very informative and helps you when you need them.

I would recommend this hotel for either business or vacation.  I would recommend the suite for that get a way with someone.",5,2011,11,13
203,Best Hotel in Dublin but that is not saying much.,"Like most people nowadays, I can't afford to stay in 5 star hotels.  That said, my wife and I have stayed in many of the top hotels in Dublin (including the Merrion) and all though the receptionist was plain rude to us, the Westbury is in our opinion the best of the bunch.  On arrival the concierge parked our car and even went back down to retrieve an item we had forgotten. The receptionist was abrupt and lacked any charm whatsoever.  I often get this in Irish 5 star hotels.  I think they feel that if they extend the 5 star service you're more likely to take advantage of them.  Or maybe it's just an Irish thing where they feel uncomfortable serving people of treating someone with respect when they are roughly the same age.  Either way it was the only blip on an otherwise very enjoyable over night stay.  The room was good value at a ‚Ç¨169 offer rate.  Bathroom was standard, the bedroom was spacious while cosy.  Breakfast the following morning was top notch and unlike the receptionist, the staff never made us feel like we ""weren't good enough for the Westbury"".  Check out was easy although we were never told that the parking would cost an extra ‚Ç¨20 per night.  If you are in Dublin for a night I'd fully recommend the place.",4,2011,11,12
203,Perfect central location,"We booked 3 nights at The Westbury Hotel so that we could see our favourite band at the o2. 
The hotel is in a great location for shopping, eating and drinking, and we did not need to use any form of transport other than our feet for the whole stay. 
Every aspect of the hotel was lovely, and we felt very well looked after. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and had everything we needed. 
Would definitly go back very soon.",5,2011,11,12
203,Sleepless in Dublin,"My family and I left the Hotel today (9 November) after 4 sleepless nights. While the Hotel is conveniently located from the perspective of shopping and the tourist attractions, it has a huge downside which current reviewers have not identified. I can only surmise that this is because they have had the luck of staying in rooms that do not face Clarendon Street.

Our interconnecting rooms on level 3 faced Clarendon Street. What became clear from the first night of our stay is that there is a seven hour cycle of drainage/sewer works that takes palce in Clarendon Street from Midnight to 7am each day. The works are extremely noisy and vexatious. 

The front desk staff are, as expected of a five star Hotel, appropriately apologetic about the issue. On the last night of our stay a member of the front desk staff came up to our room after I invited him to witness the works and noise they produced. He conceded that the conditions were unbearable and as a remedy offered to supply some alcohol to induce sleep! 

The consequence of the Clarendon Street saga was that my family and I were walking zombies for our stay in Dublin and our trip was essentially ruined. We had travelled from Australia.

On checking out, I made my displeasure known. I was shocked to be told by the duty manager that the Hotel is well aware of the issue but clearly opt to inconvenience guests rather than make an honest disclosure at the time that a reservation is made. This was particularly upsetting to me and my wife as we had taken the time to ring the Hotel before making a reservation and asked for rooms away from any significant street noise. The Hotel's policy seems to be one of silence about the Clarendon Street problem and to offer a discount on the room rate as compensation; the solution proffered to me by the duty manager. I refused to accept that solution, noting that money does not compensate for lost experiences and a ruined family trip. Interestingly, the cab driver taking us from the Westbury to the Airport confirmed that we were one of many disgruntled guests who had been given the Clarendon Street rooms in the Hotel despite the Hotel knowing about the nightly works. He suggested that we stay at the Meridien if we ever return to Dublin. 

Apart from the sleep deprivation, the quality of the Hotel facilities and attentiveness of staff are as reported and commended by other reviewers.Having said this, I note that on arrival we had no help taking our bags to the level one reception area. The porter/doorman was nowhere to be seen. Our kind 77 year old cab driver (thanks Johnnie Walker) retrieved a trolley from the foyer which I loaded and pushed through the Hotel.

In short, the Clarendon Street facing rooms cannot be considered 5 star and should not be offered by the Hotel given the knowledge the Hotel has about the nightly works. 

Shame on Westbury for destroying our family holiday. Future Hotel guests beware!",3,2011,11,09
203,A five star break,"We stayed in the Westbury for 2 nights, Friday & Saturday. The reception staff were helpful and friendly. The room was a good size, The bed was far too soft for us! We loved the nespresso coffee machine. The bathroom was spacious and the toiletries  of good quality.
The Gallery is the place to be seen  in Dublin, it does an expensive line in champagne cocktails and afternoon tea... very nice. 
The hotel has an underground carpark.  it is wonderfully placed in the centre of the city, great shopping, food, beautiful park 100 yards away..feed the ducks.",4,2011,11,09
203,Fantastic Hotel in a great location,"Stayed here for 1 night on a business trip. Everything about the hotel was fabulous, from the check-in process to room. Rooms are excellant, with great facilities, including a very good coffee making machine.
Would reccomend to both business and tourists. 
Free Wifi in public area's and cable available in room for intranet connection.Breakfast in the Cafe was included in the room rate, this light breakfast was great.
Found all staff both effecient and very friendly.",5,2011,11,09
203,Loved it!,My sister and I spent 6 nights at the Westbury.  It is in a wonderful location right of Grafton Street.  The lobby/lounge area was fabulous.  It was very inviting and relaxing to sit there and have a drink or a bite to eat.   The rooms were nice and all of the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to be in that area.,5,2011,11,07
203,A fantastic place to stay for the weekend !,A perfect weekend at this hotel from the welcome on arrival until our smooth departure. Would recommend to everybody. The only small minus point was the patchy wifi connection in the room which was irritating - helpline was routed to USA! Will dedinately be back ,5,2011,11,07
203,pleasant hotel,"Stayed at the westbury with friends and chose this hotel as it was central to our needs.
Nice hotel pleasant staff  the room was adequate spotlessly clean but okay for a 5 star hotel.
The hotel was very busy this particular weekend as there was 2 wedding partys .
The breakfast was very nice no complaints at all ,we had dinner in the hotel on the first evening which was absolutely gorgeous from starter to desert enjoyed this very much
Drinks service in the upstairs lounge was good and we were able to sit and watch the world go by in the busy Grafton street area ,as it poured down all the weekend this wasnt a bad idea.Nice Hotel  good food  pleasant staff .",4,2011,11,07
203,The best Jewel in Dublin from the location to the staff,"I'm a travel agent so I knew about this hotel. Not only from my clients but from being in Dublin in the past, So I wanted my cousin to enjoy the trip we were going on. I have stayed at the sister hotel in Boston and loved it, It held up to all that I had thought it would, from Joseph to the food and the location.
I went on the web site and jut kept checking the prices and i got a great rate stay for three pay for two. Plus I printed from the page a discount for the restaurant. My husband are returning in 2012.",5,2011,11,07
203,Driving there,"I am giving this hotel a big thumbs up for best in class service and accommodation.   The only problem I had was the drive there from the airport. It seems that the Garmin GPS from AVIS was not working very well with the small roads and tall buildings in the city area. The fact that there were some roads condoned off for pedestrians and one-way streets makes the confusion worse.  At one stage, I can literally see the hotel but just couldn't find the route there.  Street signs were poorly lit and the letters far too small for easy reading.   So my advice is that if you do not need a rental car, don't get one.  Taxi are abundant but can also be pricey.",5,2011,11,06
203,High quality in a great location,"I thoroughly enjoyed this journey to Dublin - with the Westbury being the best part of that journey.  We appreciated the turndown service as a special treat.  The convenience to shopping, pubs, the bus tour were all as expected as well.",5,2011,11,06
203,Great location And service - everything else average,"This is one of the best-located hotels in the city centre for shopping or business in the Grafton Street area. The room had a nice interior but had a view on a brick wall. We could hear the conversation in the next room, with which there was a connecting door. Hot breakfast is ordered from the kitchen, suggesting it is cooked to order, but in fact it was tired and soggy as if the food had been sitting on heated trays. Cocktails in the evening were very expensive and just didn't reach the standard you should expect for the price. One of the most frustrating things was the fact that the main national radio station was not on the channel indicated (or on any other channel) on the day of major national breaking news. Everywhere, the staff were very helpful and kind. They saved their hotel from falling into ""unsatisfactory"".",3,2011,11,05
203,Its all about the location,I have stayed in the Westbury Hotel on numerous occasions over the past few years and have always been very happy with it. It is expensive but then it is just off Grafton Street and is quiet opulent. The rooms are always very well updated and always have great services. Its no suuprise to see that the Westbury is very high up the list of Dublin hotels.,4,2011,11,05
203,"Lovely, close to most of the to do's...","My husband and I have stayed here before and just love it. They have redone it since our last stay. It is just as lovely and what comfy mattresses. Great for sleeping and relaxing. 
I am handicapped and this place is very easy in both room and bathroom.  And, the staff was beyond courteous and helpful.
Obviously, we would recommend this lovely place for comfort and it's location.",5,2011,11,03
203,Brilliant location,When we arrived our twin room was a smoking room disguised as non smoking. It was obviously deliberately done as the hotel was nearly full. The hotel sorted it out eventually and I have to say we were delighted with the suite we were given and the bottle of champaign. As always it is more often how a hotel deals with a problem than the problem itself. ,4,2011,11,03
203,Great location,"If you are looking for top luxury, this is the hotel for it. Rooms are spotless. Service is exellent, however you pay top dollar for everything. Great location for Christmas shopping - loads of great bars and restaurants. Would defo stay again",4,2011,11,03
203,Lovely hotel great location food average,"Stayed here last week and was looking forward to it.  The bedroom was beautiful the staff were excellent, breakfast was very good, dinner was average- main restaurant was closed for a private function so ate in the cafe which in my opinion was very average perhaps the restaurant would have been better. The location is superb central to everything and parking is available",4,2011,11,02
203,good location,"the location was good for Grafton St and Temple bar district but for Henry street it was a long walk.If you book through Expedia you won't get breakfast included in your package. The gym is small (a room converted) so it only has 1 treadmill and 1 each of other the equipment but it was adequate. Very helpful and friendly staff, any problems were solved quickly.",4,2011,11,02
203,Fantastic Hotel with Great Staff,"We've stayed at the Westbury twice before and as usual, it did not disappoint. We received a warm, friendly welcome at reception, and were given a lovely room, complete with coffee machine, mini bar, and crystal glasses. The new decor was very tasteful, and the room was spotless, as was the hotel. We dined in the Wilde Restaurant on one evening - very good food - and enjoyed afternoon tea in The Gallery. This was substantial, both from the quantity and calorie point of view! Special mention must be made of Joseph Downing, a member of the senior management team, who went out of his way to help us when we discovered we had lost our return rail tickets to Belfast. He's a credit to the Westbury and the Doyle Group in general. We will definitely be back.",5,2011,11,01
203,"Great Location, Friendly staff","Stayed in this hotel with my Sister who was on a business trip from abroad for one night in September.  The room was lovely, two twin beds provided and usual bathrobes and slippers provided.  Toilitries were good quality and shower was excellent.  Nice touch of your own Nespresso machine in the room for those of you who like your coffee.  One small problem was the air conditioning, it was unseasonably warm during the night we were staying and the air con was a must, however it was not working at all and we both could not sleep because of the heat in the room.  It did put a dampner on the stay for me, however when my sister complained the next morning, it was fixed immediately and her second night was much more pleasant (however her colleague in another room experienced no air con for her second night).  Breakfast was excellent and if you are just passing the hotel and not staying, well worth a visit for the breakfast alone.  Drinks in the bar lobby are expensive but the service and warm feeling of being well looked after makes up for the extra cost.  Well worth a visit and if you are coming to shop and visit the attractions of Dublin, this hotel is perfect.",4,2011,11,01
203,We had a lovely stay here but definately not 5* standard,"We had a lovely relaxing stay here for our anniversary earlier in October.  Perfect location in the heart of Dublin. We got a warm welcome on arrival at check in. 
We had dinner their Wilde restaurant which was delicious from start to finish and the waiting staff were very attentive. 
Downside was, the room was small and basic with none of the nice touches you'd get even in a good 4* hotel, (no complimentary water or fruit or chocolates) so don't expect anything special. The TV remote control was the most disgusting thing, I'm nausiated thinking about it! I asked at reception if it could be cleaned or swaped but it wasn't, so no TV. 
Breakfast was also disappointing. Not very nice.
I would recommend it for location and definately for a great dinner. But it's a 4* hotel with a 5* price tag and that makes it poor value so I'd say, go for the dinner but stay and breakfast elsewhere.",3,2011,10,31
203,Cozy and comfy stay at the Westbury,"My first trip to Dublin and I couldn't have asked for a better hotel!  Extremely convenient and in the best part of town.  Stayed in a room with a king sized bed - spacious, comfortable, huge walk in closet, and a big bathroom.  All A+ for me as I crave to be comfortable when I travel.  My only complaint is that you can hear other guests through the walls (hint, hint wink, wink). 

Overall, I would stay here again!",5,2011,10,31
203,Luxury,"Have stayed in this great hotel many times, it really is five star, the location in central dublin is fantastic and you could lose hours people watching in the fab foyer! Am looking forward to two more visits here before the end of the year :-)",5,2011,10,31
203,Fabulous luxury!,"Love the Westbury! We were back in Dublin on vacation and stayed here on our last night. It was our second time to stay at the Westbury. The location is perfect, the best in the city I feel. The rooms are classic yet modern. The service is excellent, friendly and efficient. ",5,2011,10,31
203,One of my favorite hotel,"The place is so uniqe.

Location is right in the center where everything is soo close its prefectaly good for bith bussiness and leisure.

The hotel beds are really  amazing and the service of housekeeping and quality one of the best i havee ever seen.

Keep the good job.",5,2011,10,30
203,Lovely hotel in perfect location,"Love the Westbury . Very classy hotel in the best location especially for the first time visitor to Dublin. Our room was spacious and luxurious , the staff could not have been more helpful and the breakfast was great (although a bit pricey if not included in your rate). The best shops, restaurants , pubs and bars are all on the doorstep . You will not find a friendlier city anywhere. We have stayed in Dublin many times at many hotels and would want to stay anywhere but the Westbury now.",5,2011,10,29
203,Can't wait to return,"I made a trip to Dublin on my own for 3 days of ""mommy time"". I agonized over which hotel to stay at because I wanted it to be perfect. I was so pleased with my choice. The hotel is elegant, clean and comfortable. The location was perfect - right off the centre of Grafton St. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was because a woman who worked at the front desk was somewhat rude and unaccomodating on two different days. This was an exception; all other staff were superb. Very friendly service at breakfast in the restaurant as well. Definitely recommend for solo travellers, couples and business travellers (wireless Internet is very reliable and free).",4,2011,10,28
203,Best hotel in Dublin,"I have stayed in many hotels in and around Dublin over the years as I have family there, but this is the first time I have actually had a completely stress free and utterly comfortable weekend.  I have never stayed anywhere as comfortable as my bedroom at home but this was even better!   From the staff who welcomed us at reception with warm hand towels to the girls at breakfast and the doormen,  everyone was extremely pleasant and friendly - typically Irish in fact.   This is a real home from home - our room with its queen size bed was spotless. We were really impressed by the unobtrusive housekeeping, even when we went for breakfast we came back to find our room had been cleaned and tidied although we had only been away an hour!   There were lots of touches - the free daily newspaper of our choice, the night time chocolates, daily bottles of mineral water.  The complimentary toiletries were high quality and generously sized and also renewed daily.   We did not eat in the hotel except for breakfast in Cafe Novo which was excellent and never crowded, but had dinner at Eden restaurant in Temple Bar which I highly recommend.  We also went to the National Gallery and the National Museum at Leinster - wonderful!   All in all a memorable weekend.",5,2011,10,26
203,Brilliant trip to dublin...,"Just got back from a trip to Dublin for my boyfriends birthday, we stayed at the Westbury after a long deliberation of which dublin hotel to choose and i am so glad we made the choice we did! The Westbury is a beautiful hotel with friendly and helpful staff. The room was perfect, clean and spacious. It was a lovely surprise when we got in after a night round temple bar and found slippers, chocolates and bottles of water waiting for us in our room! The location is the best of any dublin hotel i have stayed in. Would definately return and recommend to friends...",5,2011,10,25
203,City visit to Dublin.,"This was a wonderful base for a brief visit to Dublin.If you are short on time and want a central location, this is the place.Fantastic 5* service and accommodation, all with a smile.Step out of the front door and you have the friendly hubbub of Dublin on your doorstep.Wonderful!
If you are looking for something unique, this will not be the place for you as it is formulaic,but for a brief visit when one wants to be time efficient, it all comes down to location, location, location....
I would be delighted to stay there again, and would unhesitatingly recommend.",5,2011,10,23
203,First Trip to Dublin,"This was our first trip to Dublin and we decided to book a hotel with good reviews in a central location, and this was a brilliant choice to stay. The location is excellent off Grafton Street all the shops are on the door step, plus is a brilliant gateway to get further out into Dublin for other tours and experiences

The hotel was amazing and first class and lives up to its 5 star rating, we had a issue with our room location due to a noisy neighbour, and the assistant manager Ronan was extremely kind and had the issue resolved, Westbury Hotel and its staff made our stay and experience of the Dublin a wonderful experience.",5,2011,10,23
203,"Excellent, Comfortable stay in Dublin","Just returned from a short trip to Ireland. After a few days in unparalleled luxury at Ballyfin Desmense, we stayed 2 nights in Dublin at The Westbury and were very glad we did. 

The other Ballyfin guests were surprised we were not going to the Merrion, and after visiting that hotels public rooms and bar, I am very glad we opted for The Westbury. The Merrion seemed quite worn, dated, and filled with Americans 

Arriving at The Westbury we were met by probably the friendliest Bellman I've encountered. Stasys had a smile a mile wide, and could not have been more friendly, welcoming, and professional. The other staff were equally as pleasant, and because we booked through American Express Hotels, wew were upgraded to a very nice room looking down the lane towards Grafton Street.  The location cannot be beat, you can walk anywhere and although you a staying literally  in the heart of Dublin, outside noise was not an issue. 

Room service was prompt and friendly, tea in the main lobby pleasant and well presented, and breakfast was well done with excellent service and many buffet options for a continental selection.

Although the hallways at The Westbury seemed as if they could use some sprucing up a bit, the room was spotless, quite recently remodeled, and extremely comfortable. 

We honestly were not looking forward to this stay after being coddled at Ballyfin, but the Westbury both charmed and delivered.  ",4,2011,10,20
203,"Even as a local, I rate it! :-)","I live in Dublin, and have done so for a long time. My girlfriend got a voucher for the Westbury, and so we had a little mini ""city break"" on Saturday in our own home town. The voucher covered B&B, but we skipped the breakfast and had brunch in Odessa.

Anyway: it was great, and the hotel exceeded expectations. Location is obviously brilliant, being only 1 minute's walk from Grafton Street, and smack bang in the very centre of town. Room was very nice, top quality bed/mattress, and all the usual modern hotel mod cons. Clean, bright hotel, friendly staff at check-in, and a resident's bar :-) What's not to like?  

Would definitely rate it and would stay again, even though I live here!",4,2011,10,17
203,Great!,"Nice hotel with a excellent centralized location.  Right in the heart of shopping and Pub's.  Room was a good size and comfortable. As for the view, it overlooked the air conditioning system and roof. The concierge was wonderful, very helpful. A bit pricey.",4,2011,10,10
203,Great Hotel and Best Location in Dublin,"My wife and I pent 2 nights there in September, we booked it through amex FHR and were up graded to a huge Luxury Suite. The suite was very nicely decorated with modern design furniture and my only observation was the furniture and decor in both bathrooms, they were a bit dated and did not match the rest of the suite.
If you are a tourist then this hotel has the best location by far and the staff is as nice and friendly as can be. 
Had breakfast twice at the Wilde restaurant and it was great.
Would definitely stay there again.",5,2011,10,10
203,Lovely Hotel - Excellent Location,"We stayed here on a 2 night break recently and it was Fabulous, we arrived about 11 a.m. and the checkin was very efficent and too our suprise our room was ready, we had 2 rooms and they really accomadated on getting the 2 rooms close by for us as well. we were offered help by the Concierge in taking our bags to the room but we said we manage. The rooms are lovely although quiet small they have everything you could possibly need in them. The bed were big and very comfortable they was a large plaza TV and a lovely little coffee maker in the room. The mini bar was well stocked and there was fabulous cut crystal glass if you wished to have a drink. The products in the bathroom were fabulous and were replaced each day. The turn down service was done each evening and we got our room tidyed again and some water and lovely lily o'Briens Choclates left for us, we also got fabulous slippers each night. The staff were lovely and so helpful. we had breakfast both mornings and the choice was fantastic you could keep eating lovely choice of cearls fruit and choice of food from the Kitchen. will definetly be back",5,2011,10,10
203,Location is perfect / a bit alienated,"This is a very good hotel. If you can afford it, go for it.
I travelled around dublin and I can safely say that location of the Westbury is the nicest of all.
Rooms are good but service felt alienated. It felt as if the staff was forced to be kind and give 5 star treatment (The only exception was one member of staff, a blonde lady from Cork, that was kind and sincere).

The service at Novo cafe was ridiculous. Slowest service managed by some guy with spiky hair who could care less. We decided to try the continental buffet one morning. You would expect that for 15 euros you wouldn't have to remind (almost beg) the waiter TWICE to get you toasts and butter even though it is part of the deal anyways. Unbelievable. The Westbury can definitely learn how to manage breakfast from its sister hotel, River Lee Hotel in Cork.
Eat breakfast outside, Bewley's is next door.

The hop-on hop-off buses are everywhere. Give them a shot, it is not very expensive and it is the best way to see the city with style. If I am in Dublin again, I would try the Viking Splash Tours.",4,2011,10,07
203,Comfortable & Convenient,"We stayed for two nights in a Luxury Suite with a King Bed. The room was lovely with a sitting area, bedroom area and large bathroom with roll top bath and separate shower. The room was extremely comfortable and we were well looked after by the staff who came in the morning to tidy and then again in the evening to turn down the bed (with lovely Lily O'Brien chocolates) and check if we needed anything. The bed was very large with a soft mattress and pillows. All the linens were very high quality. We slept very well indeed. There was a large television in the sitting area and also another equally large in the bedroom. There was also a small tv over the bathtub for those inclined to watch tv while bathing. The only small niggle with the room was not finding a socket for the hair dryer near a mirror but I just used a small mirror from my travel case instead. We also had breakfast twice at the hotel and it was superb. Lots of choice and very tasty. We particularly appreciated the soya milk as an option. All the staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful. We also had a lovely meal in the Cafe Novo on our first night and enjoyed it very much especially the Guinness. The location of the hotel is great for exploring the area around Grafton Street and there is a convenient taxi rank just outside for taxis to go further afield if required. Our experience was wonderful and it made our visit to Dublin very special.",5,2011,10,06
203,Stunning!,"We got desserted in Dublin, when our ship did not dock, and a kindly taxi driver took us to the Westbury hotel for accommodation, and we were not disappointed.  A beautiful, well appointed hotel, and so central to the city.  Good reception when we booked in. Lovely large room, well maintained and serviced. Gorgeous lounges and beautiful flower arrangements around the hotel.

Basic breakfast was included, but you could pay extra and have a cooked breakfast. Use of the Internet was provided which was a bonus for us as we were trying to book air tickets to the USA.",5,2011,10,06
203,"Overpriced, no 5 star hotel","A friend & I stayed here, after a concert. It was my treat & although expensive, I wanted a nice stay. I really shouldn't have bothered. It was staffed with arrogant & indifferent staff. The rooms were really only 3 star at best. No turn down service. On our return we were greeted by, an overwhelming fish smell, in the foyer.The valet left my car unlocked. Would never darken the door again. All I wanted was to feel I had a relaxing stay, but instead I only felt embarrassed at having chosen such an awful hotel.",1,2011,10,04
203,what a way to spend the day,"my boyfriend took me here for afternoon tea the staff were amazing ........ we were sat by the wiondow . we both ordered the champagne afternoon tea and it did not disappoint there was a gentle play the piano and i felt like i was in a film ...if i lived in dublin i would go every day ....the dipped strawberries ,the champagne the little scones with the cream and jam were fabulous and the sandwhiches were amazing ...our watier went above and beyond to help us always making sure that we had enough of everything ...next time i go to dublin i will be making sure we stay here for a night ...here is wishing",5,2011,10,03
203,Memorable luxury,"The Westbury reflects everything that is simply great about feeling welcome in Dublin - whether for business or pleasure. The staff were all very focused on giving personal attention, even when the hotel was clearly very busy and humming - which they deserve to be. It is one of those places that seems to thrive on the positive energy of having lots of people enjoying themselves. My bedroom was spacious and very clean, with air conditioning and internet both functioning as they should.The restaurant (Wilde) has a rosette - which made the food and service very enjoyable, but special offers made it affordable and better value than I was anticipating from the rather formal exterior. Breakfast is a must and afternoon tea in the sunny, spacious lounge was a treat I'm glad we didn't miss out on.",5,2011,09,30
203,A Peaceful Paradise in the heart of Dublin,"The Westbury is five-star, top to bottom. From the friendly repartee of the doorman to the smart insight of the concierge, you are sure to find everything you imagined here.  The rooms are spacious, the linens top-notch, the robes luxurious and the location priceless.  If you are looking to indulge, look no further!",5,2011,09,28
203,"Great location, but needs to be renovated","This hotel has an excellent location right off of Grafton street. However, I do not think this is a 5-star hotel. Our room needs to be renovated - the carpeting was stained, the walls had dirt marks on them, the bathroom needed some work. Also, we were on our honeymoon, and due to our age, the concierge was not helpful whatsoever. We were treated much differently than the older patrons that were staying at the hotel, which was very frustrating.",3,2011,09,26
203,Superb in every way,"Quiet, competent, understated, friendly.  Spacious well appointed rooms.  Extremely gracious staff helping overnight travelers suffering from jet lag be well taken care of and comfortable until our room was ready.  First class and 5 star in every way...and a good value as well.",5,2011,09,25
203,Cozy and comfy,"The Westbury feels very intimate as a hotel. My room was not big but it was very cozy and comfortable. There a lots of nice little touches, like having a sitting bench in the elevator. 

The full Irish breakfast (included in my roommate) is fantastic! The only thing that leaves room for improvement is the service. The staff is attentive but impersonal and detracts from otherwise a very charming property.",4,2011,09,23
203,Its ok,"We stayed one night and were not really blown away by the place - not convinced it deserves its 5 stars. Dont get me wrong - it is not bad - just did not overly impress. Rooms are large and clean, and staff were nice enough - but no more than in many lesser stared hotels we have stayed in. Best selling point is Its location - close to many attractions. As an aside, while in Dublin - a drink and meal at the Bank Bar is a MUST. Not your normal music bar - this is seriously good.",3,2011,09,22
203,Perfect location,"Great hotel in a perfect location.  We have not needed a taxi once during our stay.  Grafton Street, the main shopping area, is 1/2 block away.  Great restaurants are within a block or two.  Our room was very large with a king-sized poster bed, table and chairs, desk, and two upholstered chairs.  Everyone is so nice here and very eager to please.  When my husband had trouble connecting to the internet, the manager personally came right away and successfully fixed the problem.  Continental breakfast was included in the price, and there were enough items to keep us satisfied until dinner!  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,09,21
203,Second time and not disappointed,"Once again a super experience. My wife absolutely loves this hotel, it's staff and it's luxuriance. It is one of the few places in the world that I can unconditionally endorse.",5,2011,09,20
203,At the Westbury Quality  lives on,"My first visit to the Westbury occurred when it was spanking new. I was a dinner guest of the founder of the Doyle Hotel Group, Paddy Doyle himself. I wondered whether the perfect service, food and attention to detail was more a result of Mr. Doyle's presence or simply the way things were done at the Westbury.
The answer, is of course, the latter. Today, more than 25 years later, the Westbury still appears sparkling new and the sterling silver tea service continues to gleam in reflected light from a Westbury chandelier. To say we like the Westbury would be an understatement: It is Dublin at its best. 
The lobby is arrived at by ascending a set of broad stairs and stretches beautifully along the width of the hotel. Reception is faultessly handled by professional staff and a Concierge is steps away, waiting to attend to your every whim
The Westbury rooms, if they lack anything, lack views of Dublin. That's not because there are not enough windows. It is simply that the Westbury's location, in a 'near' cul de sac a short walk off Dublin's main drag of Grafton Street, looks out upon other buildings in the ancient city center. But, in Dublin, the views are in the streets, the parks, pubs and on every corner. We never miss seeing anything from our room because we spend a great deal of time wandering Ireland's more than 1,000 year old Capitol city. 
Westbury is no longer a part of the Doyle Group and Paddy, God Rest his soul, is long gone but with the gift of the Westbury Paddy's spirit for quality, elegance and hospitality remains.
I cannot tell you that the Westbury is a budget hotel. It is, after all, a FIVE STAR luxury spot to spend a few nights or a long weekend at worst. At best you'll be able to linger inside the lounge, the restaurant(s) and, ohh, yeah, along Grafton Street and in nearby St. Stephen's Green.
Cead Mille Failte, as they say in Eire! 
One more thing. We'll visit the Westbury yet again next month, I hope!",5,2011,09,20
203,Very nice Hotel,"This is a very nice hotel with great service in a great location. Only two things to watch out for, the bar outside the front of the hotel gets very busy at the weekends and the noise can be heard in the rooms most of the night, Also the restaurant was very expensive, there was just the two of us and we paid ‚Ç¨140 for a starter, main course and bottle of wine, this was probably why the restaurant was empty for most of our stay. 

Overall would stay again but buy food elsewhere, great little cafe down the road, ‚Ç¨9 for a full breakfast!",4,2011,09,20
203,Loved this hotel!,"The Westbury is really an amazing, elegant hotel. It has an awesome location- central to many pubs and restaurants,  shopping on Grafton Street, St. Stephen's, Temple Bar, Trinity College..just a short stroll in any direction to most sites. The staff was attentive and totally delightful. The room was really large, by European standards, and had many special touches, such as a great expresso maker, heated towel racks, a lovely nightly turn-down service where they left the most delicious chocolates and bottles of water and basically cleaned the room again, and there were several restaurants and bars on the property. It was not inexpensive, however it wasn't extremely expensive either. I just can't imagine having enjoyed any other hotel in Dublin more than the Westbury. It was absolutely delightful.",5,2011,09,19
203,Elegant hotel just off of Grafton Streeet,"This hotel cannot be beat in terms of location.  Situated just off of Grafton street, it made sight-seeing, shopping and dining very easy.  The interior is beautifully done (the art in the lobby is worth taking a look at), and the atmosphere is quiet and calm inside.

Service was quite good.  There was a hiccup, however, when we checked in.  The doorman wasn't at his post when we arrived, so it took us a few moments to figure out how to lug ourselves and our bags to the lobby up on the next level.  I know this doesn't sound complicated, and it shouldn't be, but an impressive staircase was the obvious way up (not an option with the bags) and a sign in front of the lift indicated that a key was required to use it - something which we didn't yet have.  As it turns out, there was also a smaller sign tucked away indicating that a key was only required during certain hours of the day, but we completely missed that...  Anyway, I abandoned the bags and my sister downstairs and dashed up to check in.  The gentleman at the desk was very affable, but he accidentally charged my credit card for the full amount of the bill even though I had pre-paid it.  This could have been an issue as the hold was sizable and I'd been using the card heavily from the beginning of my trip.  However, the problem was quickly resolved with a heartfelt admission of guilt and an apology from the poor guy...  All subsequent interactions with staff members were smooth, however.  Upon check-out, Joanna at the front desk was especially helpful.

As far as the room goes, this hotel had one of the best hotel beds that I've slept in for awhile.  The Frette linens were very comfortable, and the down pillows incredibly fluffy (I'm a fan).  The room was a generous size, and the bathroom, while a bit tight did the job.  The selection of coffees and teas in the room was a nice touch.  I did notice a little bit of wear on the carpet and in the room itself though, and some things in the room could have used replacing or repair.  Not a big deal, but it came as a bit of a surprise considering that the Westbury is a five-star hotel.

Prior to my arrival, I'd heard much about high tea at the Westbury.  Since I would live on cake, pastries and finger sandwiches if I could, naturally I just had to partake.  I was not disappointed.  The food was outstanding, and the service was impeccable.  I had spent the past two weeks high-teaing my way through the UK and Ireland - this was without a doubt my favorite session.  

I would definitely consider staying at this hotel again should I find myself back in beautiful Dublin!",4,2011,09,17
203,Stay here when in Dublin,This is a really nice hotel. Great staff! Got us in to our rooms early after 6AM flight arrival. Comp breakfast is especially good. Can't beat the central location off of Grafton St with easy airport bus service.  Quiet and very comfortable rooms.,5,2011,09,16
203,Wonderful!,"There is nothing I love more than staying right in the centre of things - and this hotel was perfectly situated. Must admit it isn't the most attractive property looking at the outside of the hotel, but inside it is lovely. 

Nice-sized room, and very comfy bed. The most important qualities (according to my husband) for a great hotel are effective temperature controls and a quiet room - and he was very happy! We had breakfast included in our rate, and it was delicious. The business centre has 2 computers for use along with printers.

Nearby we had dinner at the Marco Pierre White steakhouse on Dawson Street and loved it.",5,2011,09,15
203,Wonderful Stay,"I agonized where to stay during a four night visit in Dublin and I finally chose The Westbury.  I am so glad I did.  The location was fantastic - you could walk everywhere from there - and the facilities were extraordinary.   We stayed in a studio suite three of our nights there and I can say without reservation that it was one of the nicest and most comfortable hotel room that I have ever had.  Finally, the service was exceptional.  I highly recommend this hotel and plan to stay there again on my next visit to Dublin.",5,2011,09,15
203,Not elegant but good accommodations and location,"When one thinks of deluxe hotels in Dublin, other hotels come to mind such as the Merrion.  But don't overlook the Westbury.  Great location just off Grafton Street and well appointed rooms.  Good service for a city business hotel.  Would stay here again.",5,2011,09,15
203,great location,"westbury is a beautiful hotel with great service.
all the attractions are walking distance of 1-6 blocks away.",5,2011,09,13
203,Top hotel in Dublin City Centre,"This hotel is the best located and most comfortable hotel in Dublin City centre. Situated about 20 steps (literally) off Dublins main shopping St - Grafton St. Could not fault the hotel, staff lovely and the hotel is really confortable and luxurious in general-not pretentious. We didn't have breakfast included in the rate so we didn't eat any food in the hotel but there are so many local and quaint cafes/eateries within steps of the hotel....you don't have to do breakfast at hotel. If you can afford it at all....don't pass it up.",5,2011,09,12
203,Too many niggles...,"We booked to stay at The Westbury as it had great reviews, and sounded perfect for our anniversary weekend away. When we had previously visited Dublin we had stayed at The Shelbourne, which is a beautiful hotel, great service, great staff but pretty busy in the bar areas, so we thought we would try something different. We stayed in a a Studio Suite I believe, now the room was nice, the bathroom however is very lacking, one basin, shower & bath together, I was expecting a better bathroom. I then noticed that underneath the tv table/sideboard was some rubbish and a teaspoon, we checked out the minibar and found that it wasn't working. So we told reception on our way out and on returning the rubbish and spoon had been removed, and a small fridge had been plugged in over by the bed/dressing table, with a note detailing that the minibar fridge was broken so in the meantime they had but this fridge in the room. This I thought would have been removed the following day and a new minibar fridge been installed(after all, were all the rooms being used?!), however the fridge stayed with us for the 3 nights we were there. The elevators are another problem, for a hotel that is so big, I would expect more than 2 - you always had to wait. The alternative of taking the stairs is fine, but I think you need to light the staircases a little more as it felt a little dingy...The Marble bar is lovely, and so is Cafe Novo, and the hotel position is perfect.  Most of the staff we encountered were lovely too, but like I said in the title, there were just too many niggles to make me give this a 'Very Good' rating.",3,2011,09,09
203,amazing service,"This hotel's location is absolutely perfect for tourists in Dublin.  The service was amazing and the night mamager Najib Majid was so accommodating and made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed(even at the wee hours of the night).  The concierge gave us great recommendations.  We felt very safe here and we were very please at the rooms, location and staff!
Rm 205",5,2011,09,06
203,Great hotel,"This is a superb hotel in the heart of Dublin. Our basic room was spotless, modern and fresh and the bathroom was very good.

Considering it's smack in the middle of the city it's remarkably quiet in the rooms. Next time I'm going to upgrade to one of the studio suits they have.

If it's in your price range then you're unlikely to wrong with this hotel.",4,2011,09,04
203,Beyond my Expectations,"Chose the Westbury because of Tripadvisor reviews.
What a fantastic property and location (we are world travelers).  Stayed two days and found room amenities and service beyond 99% of hotels we have stayed at.  Examples:
1)  At check in the front desk bent over backwards to get us into a room at AM arrival.  
2)  Concierge was VERY HELPFULL in getting us to destinations in town and when my DW asked about Irish whisky, a three bottle sampler was left in our room (no charge).
3)  Room had espresso machine, towel warmer, superfast internet, and all the other bells and whistles you would expect for the price.
4) At check out, because of cab shortage, door man went to other side of the hotel to find a cab for us and then waited with us to ensure we got off to the airport in time.
My only critique is that the gym is dated and needs new equipment.
I am normally not awed by many of hotels but the Westbury restored my confidence in hotels meeting expectations.  I will return!!!!!.",5,2011,09,02
203,Wonderful location and staff!,"I have traveled extensively throughout Europe and have never encountered a more personable and friendly staff then the folks at the Westbury. Absolutely wonderful and the location is within walking distance of all the major tourist attractions that Dublin has to offer. Trinity College, Christ Church, the national museums, Temple bar and Nassau Street for shopping. My 10 year old son can be a handful and the staff genuinely were amused by him, none of that snobby, ""we really don't like children but tolerate them"" attitude that you see a lot of. Can't wait to go back!",5,2011,09,01
203,Excellent customer service and best location!,"The Westbury is situated right off Grafton St. and close to St. Stephen's Green. You can walk to many attractions, restaurants, pubs and shopping. This hotel is very comfortable. The customer service is excellent, especially the night staff. The night manager, Najib Majid along with ""John"" took very good care of us every night and went out of their way to make sure we were well fed and comfortable!",4,2011,08,30
203,excellent hotel,"We were booked for 3 nights at the Croke Park hotel.  When we 
Arrived after an evening flight to our hotel the manager I firmed us that they had no more rooms but they they had booked us at another hotel in their chain, a 5 star hotel in the absolute center of Dublin.  They provided us with dinner and paid for a taxi to take us to the Westbury.  It is a delightful, beautiful hotel.  The service is excellent, the breakfast is very nice and the location is amazing.  Our 3 days in Dublin were enhanced by our stay at the Westbury",5,2011,08,29
203,Expensive but worth it!,"Stayed here for a birthday treat and got a deal at 187 Euro per night.
Especially appreciated the excellent attention and service from Paul & Jerry in Cafe Novo.
I even received a birthday card, chocolates and a bottle of wine when my celebration was discovered.
We preferred the more relaxed approach, wine and beer list and menu choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner of Cafe Novo over the Wilde restaurant.
Vegetarians might find the experience of being shown meat pre the start of their meal rather disturbing and unfortunately my husband could not partake of the complimentary sweets at the end of the meal as he is diabetic.
Also, we didn't expect to be charged 20 euros per night to park the car.
Apart from this the Westbury will always be our personal oasis.",4,2011,08,27
203,No afternoon tea at 14:27!,"My girlfriend and I were out for a day in Dublin and decided to treat ourselves to a nice lunch and chose afternoon tea at The Westbury as we had heard good reviews from family members.  We took a table on the far side of the lounge area, which is beautifully presented, but on ordering out afternoon tea we were told by our server we couldn't have it until 2.30pm, this was at 2.27pm.  Now surely a 5* hotel of this standard could have compensated 3 minutes, especially since it was 2.30pm by the time the order had been put through the Micros system, this being due to the servers paying more attention to their mobile phones in their pockets than putting an order in.  We had club sandwiches which I must say were very tasty.",1,2011,08,25
203,Favorite Hotel in Ireland! We'll definitely return.,"We spent three glorious nights in The Westbury (Dublin) and cannot wait to go back. Each morning we enjoyed a delicious made-to-order breakfast-- included in our rate-- with fresh fruit, eggs and omelettes, hot toast, endless tea and coffee. The perfect start to each day. We also experienced high tea in a lovely room overlooking the entrance to the hotel just off Grafton Street. The casual restaurant-- Cafe Novo-- has one of the best burgers in Ireland (Aberdeen black Angus burger). The staff is exceptional, excelling in making local recommendations, cleaning the rooms, delivering beautiful chocolates each night during turn-down service, and providing a sense of ease and welcome. This is now one of my favorite hotels, world-wide. I do hope they decide to expand and enhance their fitness room in the future; however, the equipment provided was clean and modern. It would just be nice to have a serious gym on site.",5,2011,08,25
203,"Lovely hotel.  Car parking and check in excellent, room very nice, everything you can think of available.","Great hotel, very central to all attractions in Dublin.  Room very nice, lots of space and all that you needed including an umbrella!  It did rain!  Marble bar was atmospheric and staff very helpful, professional and friendly.  Did not have any meals at the hotel as only a one night stay, however, all looked very nice in the dining area.  Will definitely stay again.  Dublin city centre is a lovely place, lots to do and see.",4,2011,08,25
203,"Great Location, walk to so many places","We had a great room at a fair price at the Westbury hotel in Dublin.  We could walk to Trinity College, Grafton Street, and tons of local pubs and eaterys.  We were in the middle of all this hustle and bustle, yet the room was remarkably QUIET.  The hotel itself seemed like it was just redone, all the appointments were lovely.  The staff was gracious, and willing to help in any mannor.  The bellman was extremely helpful in pointing out local wateing holes and the better pub food.  If in Dublin again it is the place we would stay.",5,2011,08,25
203,great hotel .. even better if you book with Amex,"I was there for a one night on business.
Hotel was excellent . I booked with Amex concierge (I have a Platinum Card) .. due to that I had a free room upgrade, afternoon tea for 2 (sandwiches, scones and cakes), continental breakfast and had a box of miniture whiskeys too!!
I was training some people and so had also booked a conference room - Jonathan and the lady the next day were very helpful and proactive in ensuring all was ready.
Well done .. I look forward to staying there with my wife for pleasure next time.",5,2011,08,24
203,Ideally located for access to Grafton Street,"We stayed at the Westbury Hotel on a three-night special.  We selected the Westbury by accident when we were pressed by the Jakarta Irish Consulate to commit to what hotel we were staying at so that we could apply for a visa, and Westbury was the only name we could remember.  We lucked out because the Westbury is in the best part of the Grafton Street shopping area.  One side leads to the Powerscourt building, and the other side leads to Harry Street which leads to Grafton Street.  Despite its being so central, there is no feeling of congestion in Harry Street at the front of the hotel, and there is a taxi stand right outside the front door.  The lobby and waiting area is large and comfortable.  Some measure of security is provided by programming the elevator to stop on the first floor right in front of the concierge/reception desk when it is ascending or descending.  We wanted to explore nearby breakfast places, so we never ate breakfast there.  We ate at the Westbury‚Äôs Novo coffee shop and found it was very good.   Room service also was good.

Room
We got so attached to the Westbury that we actually said ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù to our room 604 when we left.  Our room had a beautiful view of St. Ann's church, a large bed, a good large TV, and a large bathroom.  Other rooms on the sixth floor were being renovated, and aside from the occasional smell of paint, there was no sign of the renovation.  The bathroom was very large, almost too large, with a separate mirrored dressing area.  The whole sixth floor was quiet, and we slept soundly every night.

Internet
Internet was free anywhere in the hotel, including in the lobby and in the restaurants--a big convenience for travelers, especially those carrying smart phones.  The wi-fi signal in our room was sometimes weak, but we found that if we waited a while, it would get stronger. 

Service
The concierge was very helpful recommending good restaurants nearby that are not raucous (hard to find in Dublin).  They froze our ice pack and we picked it up when we left.  We ordered a taxi to meet us at the hotel because we had an early-early flight out of Dublin.  Management sent us a questionnaire after we left.  Our response was acknowledged, and we were advised of the follow-up a week later.  That is the first time that we have experienced such communication from a hotel.  They are serious.

We felt that the Westbury was one of the best hotel deals we have had in a long time.  It is very well managed, very comfortable.",5,2011,08,23
203,A very impressive 5* hotel!!!,"We got home late last night after a wonderful weekend in Dublin staying at this hotel. We stayed for two nights and completely fell in love with the hotel. It is a tad on the expensive side (not helped by the current ¬£ to ‚Ç¨ conversion) but it is totally worth it.

We were made to feel very welcome from the moment we arrived and it was clear that this was very much a 5* hotel. The room was spacious, nicely decorated with all the facilities you would expect! We were so impressed by the in-room coffee machine that we are going out this weekend to buy our own one! The bed was very comfortable. The hotel was very clean and our mugs were even renewed when we popped out on one occasion.
 
The location was brilliant. The main purpose of our visit was to see Riverdance and this was a five minute walk from the hotel.  Despite being close to the shops and bars, save for a few noisy people, the hotel is nicely tucked away and quiet.

It was my girlfriends birthday and I had phoned ahead to ask for prices for arranging a surprise to greet us. Despite deciding against it, they still dropped a card through the door! 

We had a late flight departure and the normal check out is 12 noon. We asked if we could stay until 1pm and they allowed us to do so ‚Äì without charge. We also needed to print off our boarding passes and were allowed to use the business centre to do so. 

I can see why some people have complained about the lifts. There are only two and they do take their time between floors but they were not a nuisance and definitely did not impact on our enjoyment of the hotel.

I took the occasion to ask my then girlfriend (now fianc√©) to marry me and there is no doubt that this marvellous hotel will hold a special place for both of us. We hope to see you on an anniversary trip in the not too distant future!

Thank you for making a wonderful weekend, unforgettable! :D",5,2011,08,22
203,Great hotel,"The Westbury is centrally located.  Our room was a good size. The hotel is lovely and was recently renovated.  The service was excellent, and there was no nickel and diming.  They didn't even let us pay for the water we drank out of the minibar.  I will definitely return.",5,2011,08,22
203,"Fantastic location, lovely hotel","This hotel is perfectly located for dining, shopping and walking just about anywhere (including the Guinness Brewery). We enjoyed our stay. It feels like a Westin in the room and there's no view but I'd read about that so it didn't bother me. The room and bathroom were nice, clean and comfortable. The lobby was nice minus the screaming woman who was handcuffed on the floor in front of the elevator. I think the staff were okay. We didn't eat here so I cannot comment. The lobby is comfortable and pretty. No breakfast included in the rate which surprised us a little. Every other hotel and manor house included a nice breakfast but that's okay. Plenty of places in Dublin for food. I'd stay again.",4,2011,08,21
203,Fantastic hotel,"I spent a couple of nights in the Westbury and have to say that it was wonderful. I had fairly high expectations after reading the reviews here and all of them were matched.

The location is excellent, just a few metres from the main shopping street in Dublin. The rooms were of a good size and well equipped with everything you would expect of such a hotel. I was really impressed with the media centre that lets you plugin all sorts of your own electronic devices (e.g. your iphone to listen to music on the stereo system). The hotel offers free wireless LAN but there is also a network cable in the room.

The front desk and concierge were very friendly, very efficient and extremely helpful. They also offer an express checkout so you don't have to join the queue on busy mornings.

I had a couple of meals in the restaurant and they were very good offering a good selection of local and international food and some lovely wines.

A very pleasant stay and well worthwhile if you have the chance to stay here.",5,2011,08,21
203,Very helpful staff who goes above and beyond,"Najib and Vladamir are two of the most helpful employees. They consistently go out of there way and are two reasons why staying atthe Westbury is so fantastic. Don't miss the afternoon tea and try the ""WILD"" drink at the bar",4,2011,08,20
203,Excellent Hotel,"I stayed for one night at the Westbury Hotel after staying in another nearby hotel for several nights. It was like an oasis in the desert! The staff was wonderful, the room luxurious and the amenities fantastic. I was traveling alone and the security was excellent, which is a priority. The location is perfect, right off Grafton Street. I went on a quick shopping trip and was steps away from the hotel. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anyone.",5,2011,08,20
203,The Westbury MADE our trip to Dublin,"This is one of the best hotel stays we have ever had in Europe. Our 3-generation family of 6 stayed here and loved it. Unlike most hotels in Europe, they were able to accommodate the family, giving our son & daughter-in-law and their children connecting rooms. The location is perfect, just off Grafton Street in the very heart of old Dublin, yet it was completely quiet. Shopping, pubs, and restaurants are just outside the entrance. Trinity College, St. Steven's Green, and Temple Bar are within easy walking distance. Dublin is a walking town, and the Westbury is perfectly situated to be a central base. It is quite luxurious, with a price that is good for the location, service, and amenities.",5,2011,08,19
203,great fun,"great location. clean and very nice rooms.  helpful staff.  posh, very posh.",5,2011,08,19
203,An exquisite hotel deserving of its 5* status.,"The location: It was perfect. Right off Grafton Street but far enough away to be away from the hustle and bustle of the street.

The staff: They were so polite and could not have been more charming. They were so keen to make our stay perfect.

The decor: It can only be described as lush and extremely tasteful. The hotel was extremely clean and the carpets really thick and luxurious. The many chandeliers were beautifully sparkling and eye-catching. The artwork and numerous flower arrangements added to the general beauty of the hotel.

The service: As you would expect in a 5* hotel, your beds are turned down at night. Your complimentary slippers put on your floor mat near your bed and a card wishing you a good night placed next to your chocolate. Super!

Breakfast: We were on a bed and breakfast package so could choose whatever we wanted from the wide and varied menu. The choice was more than extensive and the food beautifully presented.

The restaurant Novo attached to the hotel serves the most mouth watering Beef Daube I've ever tasted.

If you enjoy 5* hotels and are prepared to pay for it, I can fully recommend this super hotel.",5,2011,08,19
203,"Lovely staff, lovely room, grim lobby toilets","Not much more to add to the headline, in face.  The staff are lovely, full of banter and a real credit to the place.  We had a junior suite and this, too, was faultless.  But popped into the lobby loos and they were in a shocking state.  More visits from the cleaning staff and loo roll replenishment staff required.",4,2011,08,18
203,Best hotel we ever stayed in,"We stayed for 2 nights mid-week and loved every minute of it! It is quite expensive, but it's lovely to be so close to everything in Grafton St.; Stephen's Green; Powerscourt Townhouse Centre etc. If I was shopping, my husband could go back to the room and relax or watch tv which was a real bonus for him!  We also found it a relatively short walk to the Irish Film Institute in Eustace St, which shows great alternative films and accross to Halpenny Bridge to Henry Street. Any of the staff we dealt with were very courteous, helpful and professional. So overall the standard of the hotel is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who would like to be near all the shops and restaurants in a lovely part of Dublin.",5,2011,08,18
203,Its ok - but surprising its best hotel in Dublin,"Room was good and spacious. Business centre was ok but staff rather dozy. Breakfast buffet was adequate. 

Odd layout of reception and some far from effective lifts.",3,2011,08,18
203,Post Wedding Stay,"We stayed in this hotel the night following our wedding to celebrate with friends before heading off on honeymoon. On check in, the general manager approached us and congratulated us on our wedding. He accompanised us to our room were we received a complimentary upgrade to a suite. After our bags arrived a couple of glasses of champagne then arrived up to the room. A nice touch. We reserved an area in the marble bar for pre-dinner drinks and then a table for 15 in the restaurant 'Wilde' were we had organised a dinner for friends. Food was gorgeous and wine was very good. Breakfast was not cheap but plenty of options available. The only negative was at check out. We had booked our room 7 months in advance online through the hotels website. We availed of an 'advance purchase' rate. We gave our laser/debit card details and assumed the room was paid for there and then. The hotel assured us at check out that the room was not actually paid for and then tried to charge us for the higher rated suite which was provided 'complimentary' by the hotel !! It transpired after calling our bank that payment was never taken for the room it booking stage, so we paid. Also we were not charged extra for the upgrade! We pointed out that their website should be updated to state whether payment will be taken at time of booking or whether it is just used as a guarantee. We already had a hefty enough bill following a meal for 15 people and it could have been very embarrassing if we did not have adequate funds to settle the bill!! This aside, I would recommend this hotel. Good service, fantastic location off Grafton St. ps I downgraded overall experience from 5 to 4 on account of mix up with room payment.",4,2011,08,16
203,AMAZING!!!!!!! SUCH A TREAT!,"This Hotel is amazing from start to finish. When you arrive your cases are carried in for you and brought up to your room. There were 4 of us sharing a room and there was plenty of space. There was 2 massive double beds and enough mirrors and lights for 4 girls getting ready for a night out! The service was amazing. Be prepared though to pay a little extra for drinks in the bar. 7 eur for a glass of wine. Food in the bar is pricey but you are around the corner from all the bars and restaurants. Since the rooms are pricey to stay in I would recommend to just book room only and go to Bewleys on Grafton Street for Breakfast. They have a great menu that is reasonable. Highly Recommend this hotel it is in waliking distance from everything, you may pay more than usual hotels but you do not need to pay for taxis when staying there and you are treated like royalty!!!",5,2011,08,15
203,"Beautiful Hotel, great experience","The Westbury is truly as beautiful as their website and any photos online indicate. I am sorry to read that some reviewers had negative impressions of their staff - my family and I had nothing but positive interactions with the hotel staff at the front desk, the concierges, the maids and the restaurant staff. Their buffet breakfast was very nice if slightly overpriced. Great location, beautiful atmosphere, great room. We were on the third floor and did not have any problems with street noise, although we had a few noisy neighbors in the hallway. Overall a great experience.",5,2011,08,14
203,Beautiful Luxury Hotel in the heart of Dublin,"My husband & I got a voucher as a gift to stay in this hotel, what an absolute treat as with the voucher we went all out & booked an executive suite!  
On check-in the suite was not ready & we were offered complimentary tea/coffee while we waited which we gladly accepted - served in beautiful china & with a selection of tasty biscuits!
It was worth the wait, as the suite was a dream come true!!   We were escorted up to the room by the conceirge.   The suite was spectacular, hallway into a lounge with an L sofa, plasma screen in both lounge & then into the bedroom - it was huge!  Bigger than a king size bed, which leading into the bathroom which had a jacuzzi, shower, 2 sinks!   Bed was so comfy.  While getting ready to meet friends, a knock came to the door & it was a maid to turn down our bed & she left chocolates!
We did not eat in the hotel as it is very expensive - breakfast is ‚Ç¨19!  There is a Bewelys cafe just around the corner which do a tasty breakfast at an reasonable price.
This was the best hotel I have ever stayed in!
I also stayed in this hotel for a hen party after our stay (was bridesmaid & got a great deal).   Stayed in a standard room which was also the best standard room I have stayed in.",5,2011,08,14
203,Great location,"The location of this hotel can't be beat (once you find it), but I wouldn't consider it a 5-star hotel...4-star at best.",3,2011,08,13
203,A good four star,"Pros: Location on Grafton Street. Close to everything, rooms generally clean

Cons: Rooms extremely noisy with bars on streets outside. For the rates charged you would expect an investment in soundproof windows!! Our window was not soundproof and did not even close properly; damp around windows under wallpaper; bathrooms are not five star standard; unfriendly staff; no nice seats for hotel guests to sit in lobby due to constant functions taking place. Would not return to this hotel. There are actually better four star hotels in Dublin.",2,2011,08,12
203,Nice hotel....shame about the service,This hotel is not worthy of it's 5 star rating. The rooms while nice and comfortable are compact and not luxurious or worthy of the price paid. On both check in and check out we were greeted by the same rude female member of staff who never asked about our stay. The room was never turned down despite us leaving the room around 5.30. Disappointing overall and I wouldn't recommend or rate this hotel.,1,2011,08,12
203,"Wonderful stay, we plan to come back again.","The hotel is an example of what service, facilities, room comfort and city location a business or tourist would expect at a reasonable price.
The staff was welcoming and courteous. always ready to help.The rooms were spacious, clean and provided all amenities one would want.
The restaurant, coffee bar / lounge area are first class.
The location is perfect for sightseeing....

Just a gem of a hotel.",5,2011,08,11
203,Very luxurious after our travels through ireland,"This was our last stop of our vacation after driving throughout Ireland. It was a great change after being in small B and B's. We actually stayed and enjoyed some irish coffees and teas in the lobby to relax the first day. They have turn down service with slippers and chocolates on the bed each night. The night's sleep there was probably the best we had the entire trip. The bed was amazing!!! Great location to st stephen's green, trinity college, temple bar and shopping.",5,2011,08,10
203,Nice Rooms - Dreadful Staff,"Stayed here with my sisters for a one night city break. The hotel rooms are so luxurious and the location is excellent. Food was great in the restaurant. Carpark not the easiest place to find. My biggest gripe was the staff.....!! The only saving grace were the two dublin doormen that were so helpful and gave us the proper dublin/irish hospitality you would expect from a city centre 5 star Dublin hotel. The staff member I dealt with on checking in was extremely rude, I actually wanted the ground to open up he embarassed me so much. I was so shocked that I just stood there and didn't say anything. He didn't even point us in the direction of the lift after humilating me. We also had room service and had another robot style staff member come to our room. On leaving another staff member didn't even ask me if we enjoyed our stay or if she could do anything else for us, just threw my bill on the counter. I really would have given up on receiving any sort of hospitality except for the two dublin doormen that we chatted to on leaving the hotel, it was so refreshing to speak to them after the unfriendly, obnoxious staff that we had dealt with it. For this reason I would not be staying at the hotel again. Also the toliteries in our room had either not been replaced or else re-filled very badly.....not what you expect for 5 star.",3,2011,08,09
203,one of my favourite hotels but just one little problem this time,"The Westbury in Dublin is just wonderful. The staff are really helpful and very pleasant. The service is perfect and every space in the hotel is luxurious and beautiful. 
The situation is perfect for a city break as it is just off Grafton Street and St. Stephen's green. We were going to the Gaiety Theatre which was also just around the corner.
I have stayed here before and would stay again but had one problem this time. We had room 246 which is close to the pub which is just outside. Well!... they had a great night of music and song until 4am which - despite the most comfortable of beds - meant that we didn't sleep very well so avoid that part of the hotel on a Saturday night.  Other than that it was a lovely, enjoyable stay.",5,2011,08,09
203,Well located good rooms and attentive staff,"We were very pleased with the overall experience.  The location could not have been better for a holiday visit.  The room was well appointed but small and boring, as is the case with most large hotels.  The staff was attentive and very pleasant.  A major complaint that should be remedied is that we arrived from Vilnius late at night and could not get anyone to exchange currency so we could pay and tip our cab driver eho gave us excellent service.",4,2011,08,08
203,Loved it,"Just spent the weekend in the Westbury Hotel, Dublin and it has certainly lived up to its reputation. From the moment we arrived until departure we were treated so well. While the hotel is 5 star, the staff are friendly and not ""fussing"" around you. The service is efficient but not in your face. Some lovely touches like the ""turn down"" service at night, morning newspaper delivered and complimentary bottled water. Breakfast was standard fare but cooked to exacting standards. Looking forward to staying there again. The only downside is that we could hear the television in the room next to us after midnight and also the gurgling water pipes. Having said that it didnt impact on the enjoyment of our stay",5,2011,08,07
203,Highly recommended.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat!,"I knew I picked the right hotel to stay at in Dublin when I gave the cab driver the address and he said ‚ÄúOh, the Westbury.  VERY nice hotel.‚Äù
Well, he was right.  My Mom and I stayed at the Westbury Hotel for two nights in August 2011.  We stayed at the ‚Äúcheapest‚Äù room (the internet rate on the twin room).  Even though we paid the internet rate, I felt as though we were treated the same as they would have treated a person renting out a suite.  The staff at the hotel was very nice.  The concierge was very helpful booking tours for us and recommending restaurants (both casual and fine dining).  The cleaning staff were also very nice.  
The bedroom was clean and the bed linens were amazingly soft and comfortable.  They offered robes for us, and the bathroom had an abundance of towels (and a towel warmer).  There was a ‚Äúpod‚Äù coffee maker in the room.  The hotel performs turn down service, provided bottled water, chocolate and slippers in the evening.  The only weird thing was that there aren‚Äôt ice makers on the floor.  While your room contains an ice bucket, you need to call room service to deliver ice to your room.  This may be common in Ireland; I wouldn‚Äôt know.  But, it confuses the American tourists (we ran into a few other hotel guests trying to find the ice machine!). 
We didn‚Äôt eat at the hotel restaurant or drink at the bar, but we did have breakfast in Caf√© Nuevo, located on the ground floor of the hotel.  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the pancakes though.  My mother ordered them and they were served cold.",5,2011,08,07
203,Great location,"4 Poster Suite was spacious and decorated nicely in a contemporary style. Nespresso coffee machines are a great touch. Free wireless internet also a great touch! 

Front desk staff was a bit distracted and lacking in charm. They fumbled our breakfast arrangements and delievery of our bags, and then again fumbled pickup when we chaecked out. No apologies or even acknlowledgment. The weren't overtly rude, just disinterested. However, the concierge was quite helpful and pleasant.  

Bed was nice and firm and sheets very luxurious. Bathroom nicely appointed with soaking tub and separate shower. Had a nice street view looking over McDaid's Pub and the hotel entrance.

Breakfast buffet was decent but not among the best in my experience. Restaurant staff was very friendly and pleasant.  Lobby is very inviting and comfortable.

Amazing location a few yards off of Grafton Street can't be beat. There was a bit of late night noise for the street but nothing unbearable.",4,2011,08,05
203,A True 5 star hotel,"Very nice hotel, with friendly staff, rooms clean, good location in the heart of the city and good food a true 5 star hotel, can‚Äôt wait to go back",5,2011,08,04
203,THE hotel to stay in Dublin,Great location. Right smack in the shopping district. Hermes and Chanel (inside Browns) are like 3 minutes walk away. Nice pubs and restaurants around the hotel too! Hotel and rooms are lovely. ,5,2011,08,04
203,"Excellent Hotel, back time and time again","Excellent hotel, clean, great staff, great food, atmosphere, relaxing, rooms are well kitted out comfy beds! Worth the stay and in an excellent location!",5,2011,08,02
203,GREAT HOTEL AND PRINCE CONCERT SAME WEEKEND - WOW,"We stayed for three nights at the Westbury as we were going to the PRINCE concert at Malahide - which was amazing.

The hotel is brilliant and everyone was very friendly.   Our room was great. Staying at this hotel made our weekend because all the staff were so friendly and Gerry who welcomed us to the hotel was always happy to spend time discussing plans for our stay.

Nothing much more to say that has not been said but staying here made our weekend away very special.",5,2011,08,02
203,A Top Dublin hotel in the heart of Grafton St,"Location and luxury !

A perfect choice for a romantic getaway exploring dublin.

Excellent service

Very comfortable rooms, excellent sound proofing , top quality beds but a little to soft for my liking.

Unbeatable location...for the grafton St area/ trinity / st.stephens green etc. Which means that you can pop in and out of the hotel with your shopping or whatever tickles your fancy!

Highlight at the hotel........Wonderful afternoon tea....... after a day exploring the streets of D2....this is a devine treat!

Would i stay again yes but i would try the merrion hotel first for a special getaway!",4,2011,07,31
203,"Lovely Stay, right in the middle of the fun of Grafton Street!","Very nice room, entire hotel feels very swanky. Great location, in the middle of all the shops, pubs, and restaurants on Grafton Street. Bartender from Naples was super friendly and provided great service. Convenient 24 hour business center allowed us to print out our boarding passes without any trouble. The manager in the cafe was very helpful, getting me bottled water from reception for the ride to the airport early in the morning. Everything was wonderful. The only thing that my husband and I noticed was that the staff in general seemed almost nervous, wanting to please and perhaps nervous about doing something wrong. I don't know if managment is too hard on them, but it seemed this way almost across the board. One other thing that I didn't care for, they made the cleaning staff get on their hands and knees to polish the gold on the stairs in the middle of the day. Seemed a little bit humiliating. You would think they would allow them to do that at night when not as many people are around. Seems like staff could use some recognition or a morale boost or something. Beautiful hotel, we would definitely stay here again.",4,2011,07,30
203,the westbury,"hotel is currently no2 in most dublin 5 star listings and quite rightly so
we jus treated ourselves to 1 nights dinner, B & B..with an offer called ""  wilde "" after oscar.
wee bit pricey but the incl. bottle o red not 2 mention cocktails for two on the house made it prob worth it when U consider the price of wine with a meal AND 2 cocktails on the house..
car parking was 20 euro per night and a nightmare to get into and outta...take the enterprise  or bus  it nex tyme..
yes a superb hotel...but keep an eye out for deals etc.",5,2011,07,30
203,best hotel in Dublin,"I had a chance over the years (travelling for business) to visit all the 5* hotels in the city and The Westbury is my favorite one.  Staff always very friendly, rooms are nicely decorated and the average size is pretty decent, very good breakfast and restaurant, possibly the best location for shopping, dining out and access to the financial center.",5,2011,07,29
203,Great location in the heart of Grafton Street - we loved it!,"We stayed 4 days at The Westbury Hotel to begin our vacation in Ireland. The rooms were very comfortable and had thoughtful amenities (nespresso coffee, heated towel bar, crystal barware, media center, US electrical outlets) in addition to those you would expect from a hotel in this class (in room safe, mini-bar, wireless internet, robes & slippers).  The location is one of the best features of this hotel though.  It is right in the heart of Grafton Street within short walking distance to Trinity College, St Stephen's Green, Temple Bar, and Grafton Street shops & bistros.  Location was fabulous!  My only disappointment with this hotel regarded some inconsistent service.  We only received our requested wake-up call 1 day out of 3, and the requested newspaper was only delivered one morning as well.  I would have expected exemplary service from a 5-star hotel.  Regardles of the minor service lapses, I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay there again based on location and amenities.  Great hotel!",5,2011,07,28
203,The Westbury Hotel - Perfect!,"A friend and I stayed at the Westbury Hotel for three nights in July.  It is an incredible hotel.  The location is perfect - walking distance to everything, the beds are divine, the rooms are extremely clean, the staff is helpful, and the bar area is great!

The hotel is about a 35 Euro taxi ride from the airport and takes about 30 minutes.  The taxi drivers are super friendly and are willing to share lots of information - so be sure to chat with them if you are curious about the culture.

I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2011,07,28
203,Quick stop in Dublin,We stayed at the Westbury for 3 nights before going to  Nice for an Avalon Waterways cruise.  The location of the hotel is excellent.  The staff goes out of their way to please you.,5,2011,07,27
203,"Best 5 star, no mould or dust very clean hotel. Free Wifi, Nespresso Coffee in rooms","We stayed for 4 nights cleanliness was like home, no mould in bathrooms no dust in bedroom. Free Wifi worked throughout the hotel, food in restaurant for breakfast and dinner was really nice.¬†
Our rooms were cleaned daily no later than 11am. The staff were friendly, prompt and never far away.
The location is just perfect close to shops and pubs, restaurants. The Westbury Hotel was fantastic will go back

We also stayed at Westin hotel Dublin for 4 nights which was nowhere near as good as the Wesbury yet much more expensive, it had no free Wifi, no Nespresso coffee, mould in bathroom, no chocolates on bed, our room was cleaned at 3.30pm on two occasion. Not nice",4,2011,07,23
203,Fantastic,Amazing hotel. Has a fantastic location right in the centre. Lovely rooms with all the five star luxury you'd expect. Love the nespresso machines in the rooms.,5,2011,07,23
203,A very nice Dublin stay,"The Westbury Hotel is beautiful but impossible to find if you are driving to it and are not familiar with the city of Dublin (for the record Dublin is very challenging to traverse by car if you are not familiar with the roads).  My friend I was traveling with actually jumped out of our car around where we thought the hotel was and came back with an employee, who graciously jumped into the car and directed us to the hotel (that is a testament to the great service we received for our entire stay and a reason why I would recommend this hotel to anyone).  Coming from 6 days in the Irish country side Dublin was a definite change.  There is a lot of shopping (if you take a walk to Henry street you will find a lot of the same stuff for 3 to 5 Euros cheaper) and many great places to eat.  The hard to find Cake Shop (featured on a Bobby Flay Ireland special) is worth tracking down for a nice cup of coffee/tea and some really tasty baked goods.  The Porterhouse Brew Pub also offers some tasty beer.  Although we may skip Dublin for the country if we ever make it back to Ireland it is worth experiencing at least once.",4,2011,07,23
203,Nice hotel,Beds are very comfortable and the location is great! The concierge gave us excellent recommendations for dinner and were helpful with whatever we needed. ,5,2011,07,23
203,"Location YES, 5 stars NO","The location is the best thing about this hotel just off Grafton St, perfect for shopping, socialising & tourism! But no leisure centre, small rooms, very poor breakfast - tasteless hot food, staff clearing tables as you eat! Everything incl coffee/tea not hot enough! Does certain things well but there are better 4 star which try harder, with more wow factor!",3,2011,07,22
203,Fab Hotel in a great location,"Stayed here on the way back from our honeymoon. Arrived in late due to delays in flights and connections etc so were very weary when we arrived at hotel. Staff greeted us so warmly and were so welcoming that they perked us up!! They were aware that we had just got married and were coming back from our honeymoon and offered us champagne on arrival. I was starving and they sent some lovely soup up to the room. The rooms are unbelievable - very spacious and comfy and luxurious. Ensuite bathroom was very large as well. Beds are so comfy, had a great nights sleep. Breakfast the next morning was excellent. Great service and the selection of food was great. The hot food was cooked to order and there was a good and varied selection. Service in the hotel is excellent. Decor etc is great. Location is a plus as it looks out onto Grafton Street - shopping heaven!! We only stayed her for the one night but was very impressed and will be back again.",5,2011,07,22
203,Great Dublin Option,"We really enjoyed our time at The Westbury. It was close to so many of the sights we wanted to see, and the staff was great. We felt it was worth the price. The croissants at the breakfast were some of the best I've ever had. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2011,07,21
203,Luxurious Hotel that is a block off of Grafton Street near great pubs,"On our recent three week trip to nine hotels in Europe, the Westbury stood out as the nicest one.  The staff, air conditioning, and wi-fi service were excellent, and the room and bathroom were nicely appointed.  The rooms were clean and very comfortable, the hotel bar was great for a night cap, and there were two pubs just outside the door (McDaids and Bruxelles) where we met a lot of friendly locals...most of the younger crowd and tourists were in the Temple Bar area, which is about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel.  The hotel is a great location, a block off Grafton St. and just far away enough from the crowds, near great dining and shopping, and less than a 30 minute walk to fun things to do in Dublin (Guinness, Jameson, Christchurch, St. Patrick's).  We'll definitely stay here again if we return to Dublin.  Highly recommended!",5,2011,07,20
203,"fab hotel, fab bed, fab food",My husband and I stayed at this hotel for my birthday. It can be a little tricky to get to if one is not familiar with Dublin city but good directions available from hotel staff.  The hotel is very central for both shopping and theatre and there is a cute shopping mall tucked in at the side of the hotel.  The food and service is first class but staff could smile a little more. It is five star and deservedly so but sometimes different clientele require a less formal and more friendly approach.  Overall we had a very enjoyable stay and would hope to return in the future.,5,2011,07,20
203,Great experience Businees and family,"Stayed for a few days, first on Business than with the family.
Changing rooms was seamless, got great advice on local businesses from concierge service, food is reliable, front service and concierge entirely focused on making sure you enjoy your stay.
I recommand the family room when you have young kids. easy to use entermainment center, hooked my computer on the flat panel and played DvD, etc. ideal location to enjoy Dublin",5,2011,07,18

203,Amazing Hotel in Dublin -- Amazing Service!,"My sister and I stayed at The Westbury Hotel in Dublin, Ireland last week and overall had a wonderful experience during our stay.  My husband had researched this hotel for us on TripAdvisor earlier and based on other reviews, we decided to try The Westbury.  We are so glad that we did.  It surpassed our expectations and was actually much nicer than the hotel we stayed at in London!  Conveniently located on Grafton Street in the middle of the city, it was so very convenient and easily within walking distance of shopping, restaurants, Temple Bar area, Trinity College, St. Stephen's Park and other Dublin attractions.  Walking down the cobblestoned street of Grafton St, The Westbury is tucked away behind local florists showing and selling their wares on the street.  The hotel has 200 rooms; our room was on the 2nd floor and we felt like we were staying at a 5 star resort with 4 star prices!!  Jhoanna and Katarina, our receptionists were simply amazing and diligent with our check in and Eddie, the concierge at The Westbury, was a wealth of information as he made suggestions on Dublin walking tours, open-air bus tours, restaurants and short excursions outside of Dublin.  We ate dinner at The Unicorn, just a short walk from The Westbury, which was delicious.  We were limited with our time and Eddie, the concierge, suggested we take the DART to Howth, just northeast of Ireland on the coast.  There we ate lunch at Aqua, a restaurant overlooking the Irish Sea.  The ride from Dublin to Howth was a short 30 minutes on the DART as it was very convenient and easy to ride.  Our room at The Westbury was extremely comfortable, elegant and even had heated towel racks in the bathroom!  They have a full service restaurant at The Westbury and with our hotel room we received a complimentary continental breakfast downstairs in the cafe'.  Excellent choice for couples, families, girl trips, etc.  When we return to Dublin, we will definitely be staying at The Westbury again!",5,2011,07,16
203,"Great hotel, great location for Dublin sightseeing","Shopping, sightseeing, sampling Dublin nightlife - it's all within easy reach of this great hotel.  Staff were happy to help with restaurants and tours, breakfast was not included in our rate but was top quality. Room was clean and well maintained, bed very comfortable, equal to any of the big 5-star chains.  

Walking distance to Trinity College & Dublin Castle, both worth seeing if you're into history.  Take a hop-on-hop-off bus tour (stops 5 mins walk away) for a good overview of Dublin geography.",5,2011,07,13

The location can't be beat,  very close to but not in Temple Bar area, where everyone wants to be, but also close to Trinity College.    Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2011,07,02
203,Awesome Hotel in the City Centre,"The hotel is located in the heart of Dublin, at Grafton Street and offers accomodation for acceptable prices. Surrounded by Pubs and shops make this hotel unique.
The room size is ok and well equipped with a coffee machine is standard equipment as well as very comfortable beds.Furthermore the hotel offers outstanding breakfast with fresh fruits, muesli and cheese and ham/sausages. Finally the restaurant can be recommended as well, offering great food for acceptable prices.",4,2011,07,01
203,Breakfast?,"We just spent a lovely weekend in Dublin. We stayed at the Westbury Hotel from the 17th - 19th June 2011, this is a beautiful hotel in a fantastic location, it was very expensive, the rooms cost us over ¬£400.00 on the Saturday night, and not much less on the Friday night. However the breakfast, can you imagine having  taken your breakfast plate to the chef and point out to him what you would like to have on your plate, i pointed to the sausage tray, fried egg tray, tomato tray, bacon tray and the blackpudding tray, this was all piled up onto my plate like a pyramid. Never in my life have i seen such presentation. The breakfast Chef was foreign, but it looked as if he was serving a sentence to do this job. I  could not find a waiter or manager at the time to show how this had been plated up. I didn't want to wait too long, as i didn't want it to go cold.
P.s I am very fortunate that i have stayed in 5 star hotels regulary over a number of years, and have never ever witnessed anything like this.",5,2011,06,30
203,The only upside to leaving the Westbury is the chance to look forward to returning,"When I arrived to check-in (6 hours earlier than check-in time) my room was understandably unavailable (I had booked a specific room) but everyone went above and beyond to welcome me, accommodate my requests (I had come off an international overnight flight and had a business meeting to attend) and facilitate my needs.  They took care of me and my luggage like there was no other person in the entire hotel.  Amazing.  
I went to my meeting and as soon as my room was available the lady who checked me in telephoned me to tell me the room was ready and if there was anything they could do to just let her know.  When I did get to the room they delivered wine and chocolates to welcome me.  I think I must have been the only person in the entire hotel with the level of service I received.  
The room was amazing - huge, immaculately clean, and incredibly quiet, despite the bustling streets of Dublin below.  The temperature in the room was perfect, but had it not been, the thermostat was there to personalise the temperature.  For the eco-traveler the lights have a master switch at the door so you did not have to worry about forgetting to turn out the lights.  The mini bar was fully stocked with anything you might need and snacks were also on hand.  The bath tub was the perfect size for a long relaxing soak and the shower was powerful and way beyond big enough to swing a cat in!  The bed was so comfortable that you would never want to leave ‚Äì an island in the oasis.  The televisions were very easy to use as was the wireless internet, which gave a fast and uninterrupted connection.
Room service were most pleasant when taking the order and the food was delivered quickly and presented impeccably, even though it was only the tastiest ham sandwich I have had in the longest time!  (Only change would have been to have Tayto crisps!)  Coffee was awesome - really hot and freshly brewed.
Downstairs the Marble Bar was cozy and inviting with good background music playing at a background volume that allowed for easy chatting and no voice straining.  Service was fast and with a smile and the waitress was distantly attentive ‚Äì arrived just as we seemed to need anything but was not intrusive or hovering.
Check-out was as personal as check-in and the staff conveyed a sense or sorry to see you go but please come back.
I have been very fortunate to stay at a number of fine hotels in Dublin and this is now the one that is the standard to be measured by.  I am already planning my trip back.  Thank you so very much to everyone at The Westbury.",5,2011,06,23
203,Noisy as hell.,"The location is great, the rooms are nice enough, but it is unbelievably noisy.  We were first given two rooms overlooking the two pubs outside the front door - very atmospheric, but not so good if you want the kids to sleep.  The we moved to the back - the trucks that collect all the rubbish (particularly bottles) from the hotel and surrounding pubs do their work during the night and early morning to avoid traffic congestion in the daytime.  Its just not a good hotel for sleep.

The staff are friendly, breakfast nice (but ask for a deal when you book).  The prices in he lobby are crazy.  Have a couple of sandwiches and drinks and you're at 70 euros in no time.  Also the sandwiches are terrible - 4 parts mayo, 1 part bread, 0 parts filling.

Last year, we got over the noise and enjoyed the rest of the stay, this year we didn't.",3,2011,06,17
203,The Reviews Don't Lie,"Spent 2 nights at the Westbury at then end of a week spent in the West of Ireland.  We picked this hotel solely on the basis of Trip Advisor reviews and we were delighted.  We were a total of 8 people - 4 adults and 4 kids all travelling together with 2 adults and 2 kids in each room.  The rooms were huge and beautifully appointed down to crystal wine glasses and high end coffee maker.  The beds were divine.  The check-in was seamless.  The bellman was extremely helpful.  After a long drive up from Killarney we wanted a drink in the lounge.  It's a beautiful space with very comfortable and elegant furnishings and a nice view towards Grafton Street.  We were waited on several times by Ciara who was just about the best waitperson I have ever experienced.  She was friendly but not obtrusive.  The next day she happened to be our server at High Tea and again, she was just superb in difficult circumstances.  She had to supervise the provision of High Tea to 9 people including 4 children.  She was just a jewel and I was hosting an older Irish relative who lives in Dublin so I was nervous that it would be chaotic.  It was just lovely.  The food served at the tea was a bit disappointing.  The salmon sandwiches were dry, the roast beef sandwiches were inedible.  The scones were bland.  Nice chocolate covered strawberries and raspberry tarts.  In general, I would recommend the tea experience at The Westbury for the experience but not the food.

We had the continental breakfast each morning as it was included in our rate and we thought it was excellent.  Tons of muffins and croissant, slamon, yogurt, cereals, 4 kinds of juice, cold cuts, cheese, granola.....yummy.  The dining room was beautiful and well-staffed with newspapers a plenty and delicious coffee.  One of the kids asked for hot chocolate and out came a tea pot full of it.

This hotel is truly elegant without being stuffy.  We used to stay at The Shelbourne but was disappointed with our last stay.  Assuming The Westbury maintains its standards, we will return time and again.

This hotel is perfectly located for exploring Dublin, as we did.",5,2011,06,16
203,Wonderful Hotel,"When we arrived at the hotel we were met with a friendly receptionist who I believe had a french accent.  She was very efficient and before long we were issued with our key.  We were given a voucher for breakfast the following morning.  The hotel room was excellent and the beds were very comfortable and we had a very restful nights sleep.  The service was excellent and we were made very welcome.  The hotel is located in a very good area with easy access to shops, restaurants and we were within walking distance of the Gaeity Theatre.  I cannot say enough good things.  

However, there was one problem which I am sure creates a problem for the hotel and that is the woman who beg outside at night time.  They are very determined to get you to part with money.  I informed one of these woman that I would complain to the Hotel and they quickly left.  This appeared to happen only when the doorman was finished for the night.  This would in no way prevent me from staying here again.   Well done to all the staff members and the manor in which this hotel is ran.    I am sorry I cannot remember the Receptionist who handled our book in.  She was great and thank you for breakfast!  I will certainly be back again.",5,2011,06,14
203,Best hotel I've ever stayed in,"The Westbury could hardly be more central, just off Grafton Street and a couple of minutes from St Stephen's Green in one direction and Trinity College in the other.

Five-star hotels can be stuffy, but the Westbury isn't. The staff are friendly as well as polite and efficient. Our room was large and quiet, with a Nespresso machine, my first encounter with this marvel of modern technology.

They do a superb Irish breakfast but, unless you have a gargantuan appetite, order the half rather than the full Irish.

We had an excellent dinner in the fine-dining restaurant on our last night.. Oh, and they bring round chocolates in the evening.",5,2011,06,14
203,Good place to stay in Dublin,"The Westbury is a very nice, not too expensive hotel in the center of things in Dublin. Located a few steps from Grafton Street's many attractions, and a few blocks from the lively Temple Bar area, this hotel is well appointed, friendly and comfortable. No complaints, only compliments.",5,2011,06,13
203,"Ideal location, top-notch hotel","The Westbury has everything you expect in a five star city centre hotel experience.  The location is perfect.  You step out the lobby door and you're within steps of Grafton Street.  The rooms are immaculate and exceedingly comfortable.  The staff is friendly, efficient and professional.  The public areas are sophisticated and relaxing.  The breakfast was superb.  I will be back.",5,2011,06,13
203,"High Class Service, Great Location.","I stayed for three nights with my partner.  The hotel is perfected located for shopping and nightlife and is still quiet.

The service was first class, just what you would expect from a five star hotel.

The rooms are comfortable, maybe on the small side and fairly traditional in design.

Would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,06,12
203,Loved it once I got the right room,"Stayed at The Westbury in May 2011.  Having stayed at their sister hotel in London ""The Kensington"" The Westbury was as good as I expected.  Not as personal and cosy as The Kensington but fantastic service and facilities all round. One word of caution though.  I booked a room for 1 person at 188 euro a night. I specifically requested a double bed,   When I got to my room I found 2 very small single beds.  I had no intention of paying 188 euro to sleep in a single bed.  I went down to reception told them the  situation and the room was changed no problem. I am only mentioning it to warn single travellers to make sure they ask for a double bed.  So many hotels in the UK and Ireland have the bad habit of giving single travellers a single bed(even though we pay the same price).  I think for a 5 star hotel even having a room with 2 single beds only, knocks them down a star.  Had dinner in Wilde's Restaurant and the food, service and value were fantastic.",4,2011,06,12
203,"Perfect location, Perfect service","I stayed at The Westbury Hotel for six nights in May.  It certainly has the best location of any of the top hotels in Dublin--on Grafton Street but set back from it.  I could walk to many restaurants, all the major museums, Temple Bar, Trinity College--most of the main attractions in Dublin.

The rooms were spotless, comfortable and had every modern amenity that could be desired.  Loved the coffee machine--quite good coffee in seconds.

The service at every level from housekeeping to desk personnel to the manager was thoughtful, friendly and instantaneous.  That was true of the hotel restaurant as well, where we ate one night.

I also enjoyed the attractive mezzanine with its large windows and lots of buzz--people having meetings, interviews etc.  Lots of coming and going.  It is a destination in itself.

My only quibble would be that the decor was a bit corporate.  I'd like to have seen Irish art--paintings and sculpture--to give a sense of place.

This is a",5,2011,06,10
203,Great Location,We enjoyed our recent visit at the Westbury.  Great location- central to everything.  I especially want to comment on how nice and helpful the concierge  staff was to us. Thanks!,5,2011,06,08
203,"Superlative service, great location","The Westbury is a modern style five star situated  in the heart of Dublin, Ireland.  I recently visited and was very impressed with the level of service; I truly felt like a VIP guest.
Their location is such that you can zip here and there on foot, visiting Grafton St for a bit of shopping or browsing, St Stephens Green and Trinity College ( and, naturally, a pub or two-I enjoyed the cider ale).
They serve lovely scones in the bar area, and the food from Cafe Novo was of excellent quality.  
There is some street noise, given the location, but the windows have soundproofing.  The sheets are of high quality, and the bathrooms are very nice.
As I've stated, the service was excellent, from the housekeeping staff to the business center, to the concierge.  In particular, the assistant manager, Joseph, went out of his way to offer me personalized service, for which I was grateful.
I would return to the Westbury.",5,2011,06,07
203,This hotel was absolutely awesome!,"My husband had a business trip to Dublin and I travelled with him. We stayed at this hotel from May 20th, 2011 to May27th, 2011. We both loved the hotel. My husband was able to have several business meeting in the spectacular lobby bar area. We were celebrating our 34th wedding anniversary May 21st, and when the hotel realized this , we were upgraded to a beautiful suite, given in room champagne, as well as champagne at tea and dinner....
The staff were friendly and helpful, especially Lisa at the front desk. We will definitely stay here again, and will recommend the hotel to family and friends>",5,2011,06,04
203,Fantastic,"I booked the luxury suite for my wife's birthday only to be told on arrival that we'd been upgraded to the Presidential Suite which was fantastic. Remote control tv,lights,speakers,curtains and iPod dock. Huge lounge/diner, bar, large bedroom, sauna. Two toilets, two showers,bath with tv's in every room. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Dining area/reception stunning. Location is fantastic too,10 min walk to Temple Bar area and amongst top shops. I could not mark this hotel down in any category. Great for couples",5,2011,06,01
203,Wouldn't Rush Back...,"The location of the hotel is undoubtedly excellent. However, for us, this is where the positive begins and ends.

We had an unsettling experience with this hotel. Not to go into detail, an issue arose and we had to complain.

Eventually, at our request, the complaint was escalated to a higher level before we received any satisfaction. The outcome was satisfactory but it took almost 6 weeks to get to that point.

As the saying goes: once bitten, twice as shy. I would stay elsewhere next time.",3,2011,05,28
203,All time favorite hotel in great location,"Our stay at the Westbury was one of the best we ever experienced. Upon arrival, you are greated with a warm towel and friendly staff. The hotel itself is gorgeous and is located right in the heart of Grafton street, high end shopping heaven! It is a short walk to temple bar area, so you can have all the fun without the noise at night. I would love to stay here again. Rooms were a good size and beds were to die for!",5,2011,05,27
203,enjoyable stay,Great Location! Spacious rooms and lovely staff.  All in all a very enjoyable stay.,4,2011,05,27
203,"Very nice hotel, a few minor defects.","tiny reading lights (one each side of each bed in our 2-queen bed room) could not be individually switched on - couldn't read middle of night without waking wife and daughter who was in the other bed).  No soft night light in the bathroom (unlike,say, the excellent Park House Hotel in Galway which was, overall,  better value for money). Light switch system was actually all  a bit confusing.   Very friendly and helpful staff though.  Nice public areas.",4,2011,05,21
203,In the centre of Dublin - great hotel at a great price!,"I stayed here with a large group of friends, probably 12 I think in total, such a great hotel if you are looking for something in the middle of Dublin and not too expensive!! It is just off Grafton Street so if you are going for the night-life and shopping this is the place to stay if you don't want to spend a fortune but you want a great, clean yet still grand hotel.

There are many hotels in Dublin that are expensive 5*'s yet worth every penny, this hotel is more of a busy younger hotel but great for the value.

The breakfast too was delicious and we were given a fantastic rate for this after calling before hand to discuss as so many of us would be staying there. 

It has a lively vibrant atmosphere yet rather relaxed, only problem we had was when returning from a night out whilst some were already in bed and a few of us just brushing our teeth in the toilets we had a knock from a member of staff at reception asking us to keep the noise down, considering we had just walked through the door and were getting ready for bed I would say the walls must be paper thin!! as we were only talking at a normal volume whilst getting into bed!!

So if you are looking for a good top hotel in Dublin, it is not the best hotel there is in the town but for the value you cannot beat it unless you want to spend a lot of money!!",5,2011,05,21
203,An excellent city hotel,"We have recently returned from a wonderful stay at this hotel to celebrate a special birthday.
Excellent location, fantastic breakfast , amazing rooms and attentive service.",5,2011,05,18
203,Great,great hotel to stay at. I would recommand this hotel to anyone going to Ireland,5,2011,05,15
203,Luxurious and welcoming - location superb.,"Loved this hotel. Location is something else. Really central which made for a great experience in Dublin city centre. Hotel is traditional and welcoming and not OTT on the ""posh front"" yet luxurious. Staff were really pleasant and very helpful. Bedroom was possibly very slightly on the smaller side of what we expected but still very comfortable and impressive. I wasn't excited about the cafe/restaurant on the ground floor as I thought it lacked a little atmosphere but we planned to eat out most of the time anyway so it didn't affect us much. Breakfast was of a very high quality too. We didn't have afternoon tea but saw that there was obviously a big demand for it and that added to the atmosphere of the busy foyer.",4,2011,05,15
203,Mega comfy bed!,"Superb location in the centre of town, but you'd have no idea that the some of the bars are so close because the rooms are so quiet!  Breakfast was adequate (had better), but we didn't eat in the hotel for dinner or any other meal.  
Check in was easy, as was check out - always really friendly staff and a smile.  We were offered a cold towel on arrival and a bottle of water on leaving ""for the journey"".  
The rooms were lovely - we had one each, and both were kitted out with everything you want - including a great coffee machine and the comfiest bed going!",5,2011,05,15
203,Wonderful Staff and rooms were good.,"The only problem i had was the bathroom door stuck and I was alone and could not get out lucky for the phone. i called down and what a right performance it turned into.
They paid for a breakfast for the problem and sent up a basket. Are was wonderful and i plan on staying again 2012",5,2011,05,12
203,Excellent!,"This hotel is amazing. I brought a tour group from the states in March and booked 6 rooms for 3 nights. 
The staff was incredible, especially Willy, one of the concierges. They are helpful and friendly and will assist you with anything! 
Gorgeous rooms, beautiful lobby, great room service! 
Stay here!!!",5,2011,05,03
203,Just fantastic!,"I have to say the Westbury was very impressive in every way.  The location is first class - right in the middle of it all, just off Grafton Street,  The rooms are superb - we were in a Deluxe Room.  It was huge, and everything was beautifully furnished.  Lovely afternoon in the lobby area - one of the finest and most relaxing open areas I've ever experienced. Literally dozens of classy sofas, chairs and tables.  This place is similar in standard to the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt - and that's saying something!  They even offered us warm face cloths to help us freshen up as we checked in!  Will definitely be back.",5,2011,05,02
203,"Good Bedroom, Superb guest areas, excellent restaurant","Stayed at The Westbury 28th and 29th April while on a short break in Dublin, and really enjoyed the hotel facilities. The 'Superior' room (which I believe is this hotel's standard category of room) was quite attractive and was furnished with very comfortable beds and armchairs.  The in-room 'Nespresso' machine was a great feature, and we were kept well supplied with coffee pods for it. We were on the 6th floor at the back of the hotel and we did not have any problems with noise from the street nor from other rooms - we slept well.

I stated above that the room was 'quite attractive', however, where The Westbury really excels is in it's public areas, and especially The Gallery - a supremely elegant area where guests can relax with a drink, a light meal, read a newspaper or whatever. It's a million miles away from the bustle of Grafton street metaphorically even if it's just a few feet physically.  It's also possible just to lounge in a window seat and people-watch. We found it the perfect place to chill out at the end of the day. Probably the best guest area of any hotel we've visited.

After leaving The Westbury, we spent one night in the Westin Dublin.  In contrast to the open, airiness of The Gallery in The Westbury, I found the Westin's Atrium Lounge a bit claustrophobic.

Had dinner in the hotel's restaurant 'Wilde' one evening - one of the finest meals I've ever eaten, for which I've written a separate review.

Can't finish a review of The Westbury without mentioning the quality of the staff.  Without exception, concierge, check-in/out, room staff and bar staff were friendly, courteous and helpful - almost on a par with my favourite hotel - The Scotsman in Edinburgh ;-)

Would certainly like to visit The Westbury again sometime.",5,2011,05,01
203,"Hands down, the best hotel in Dublin!","If you opt for a full hotel, as opposed to one of Dublin's hundreds of fantastic B&Bs, you can not do better than the Westbury.  Great staff, nice rooms, fantastic location, wonderful cafe and restaurant (called Wilde) -- the Westbury has everything.  I've stayed and nearly every major hotel in Dublin over the years, and nothing else even comes close for business travel and as a meeting/conference site.",5,2011,05,01
203,Amazing-We will be back,"We had an amazing stay at the Westbury. My finance booked us in at the last minute as a surprise. We are from Dublin and the location is well known as an excellent one near the shops, Stephen Green etc. The lobby and reception area of the hotel is just fab. As it is a city centre hotel I was expecting a small but stylist room but couldn't believe it when we went into the room. It was huge with a four poster bed , gorgeous furniture and a big bathroom. Turns out that it was a suite so we got an upgrade from what we had booked. We received excellent service in the bar at reception etc and it just couldn't be faulted. We are a young couple but didn't feel out of place. The only let down was the breakfast. For the price it wasn't  that great and they was no fresh fruit which was shocking for a five star hotel. We have had much better breakfasts in four star hotels. On checking out the receptionists could not have been more helpful and we were able to leave our car there for another few hours. Can't wait to go back!",5,2011,05,01
203,Absolutely Top-Notch,"My wife and I spent four nights at the Westbury in April 2011 and found it superb in every way.  They had a room for us at 6:00 AM after an overnight flight.  The attention paid to upkeep was outsatnding.  The location puts you five minutes walking from St. Stephen's Green and no more than 30-40 minutes from most places you would want to see in this compact city.  We didn't go to the fancy restaurant, except for breakfast, but a diner in their Cafe Novo was our favorite meal.  The bill -- four nights at a 5-star hotel, 10 breakfasts, a dinner with drinks, and two visits to the bar for nightcaps --  came to $1328.  Impossible to beat this overall experience.",5,2011,05,01
203,Fell in love with the Westbury Hotel!,"It was so much better than I ever expected!  When we arrived at the desk to check in we were greeted by a lovely staff member who proceeded to provide us with hot towels to freshen up with while she checked us in.  The room was extremely large and had plenty of room for the 4 of us to be comfortable.  The concierge was more than accomodating with directions and suggestions for dinner and entertainment.  The turn-down service at night included chocolates, bottled water, slippers and a mat on the floor next to the bed for each of us.  The bathrobes were a nice touch.  The location couldn't have been better.  Just a short walk to Temple Bar and upscale shopping is right outside the door. Watch on-line for non-refundable bookings to get a good deal.  We didn't get our wake-up call that we requested at 5:45 a.m. in order to make our flight home but luckily I set my phone alarm as a back up and we made the flight.  FYI...if you are headed to Dublin for the pubs...don't go on Good Friday!  It's against the law to serve alcohol in Ireland on that day and Dublin strictly adheres to it.  Evidently the countryside does not.",5,2011,05,01
203,"Nice hotel, fantastic location","Very nice hotel in a fantastic location.  There are many places to shop, eat or sightsee at within very easy walking distance.  The rates are steep but I thought the location made it worth it.  The breakfast buffet was tasty and provides for a very filling breakfast but the cost is also steep.  The room was very nice and the internet was free which surprised me.  I was attending meetings at the hotel and the meeting room was large, had internet access and had a projector.  It made for a nice location for business.",5,2011,04,23
203,GREAT HOTEL,"Photos are exactly correct. Very nice room. Great coffee maker in room.
All employees are very attentive. Did not partake of the optional breakfast,
as I thought it was too expensive for someone who only wants an egg and
pc. of toast. Did not go to their restaurant, but did go to their cafe Novo.
That was quite good. Location is great, as everyone else has mentioned.
Right out the door and you're on Grafton St. Taxis are always waiting
in front if you need one. Wish we had had time to try the afternoon tea.
Seems most people there were more ""dressed"" than we. We are more
""jeans"" people, but know when and where to wear them. I would for sure
stay here again.",5,2011,04,19
203,Lovely hotel,"We stayed at The Westbury Hotel for a weekend.  If you are traveling with small children, ask for room 203.  There was a closet big enough to stick two baby cots in!  My son does not sleep well when others are up and going to bed at 8PM isn't fun for me so this worked out very well.

The service was lovely, the housekeeping staff was friendly, the ammenities were lovely and the bed was soft.

We also used the hotel babysitting service and had a nice experience with a very sweet babysitter, Agnes.   We recommend her too :)",5,2011,04,14
203,Great location!,"Stayed 2 nights-as already stated,you can't beat its location as everywhere within walking distance.Room really comfortable-only complaint is very hot at night and air con not working properly.Bewley's-just around the corner-offered excellent breakfast choice and reasonable too.Would stay there again!",5,2011,04,11
203,Well-located but noisy and uninspiring,"The Westbury has the classic problems of an old city-centre urban hotel whose refurbishment was probably constrained by its original layout and build quality. Standard rooms are cramped and sound-proofing astonishingly poor. The top floor room I was initially allocated had a persistent buzz from a roof-top fan which was eventually joined by tv noise from the room next door. I moved to a lower floor room that was slightly better but I still noticed that noise from the corridor and from adjoining rooms was very audible. This would be a particular issue if you were in Dublin for some serious purpose and needed sleep as many occupants of this hotel seem to be in Dublin to party (for which the hotel is well located being close to Temple Bar and other concentrations of bars/ clubs). Meanwhile the general feel of the hotel is rather dated, pompous and stodgy - you easily picture cabals of Irish politicians and property developers dining here in the boom years. 

On the positive side all my service encounters were friendly and helpful.And the breakfast was good.",2,2011,04,11
203,Great hotel in excellent location,"Having spent a lot of time choosing a hotel in Dublin, I was not disappointed with the Westbury.  The staff were very helpful and despite arriving many hours before official check-in time, I was phoned after about an hour to say the room was free.  It is a little noisey if you are right at the front, but nothing that ear-plugs won't solve.  Room was really clean and furnishings all very attractive and fresh.  My partner loved the coffee machine!  Only gripe is that room service was quite poor - could not get through on phone for ages (reception had to do it for me in end) and the food was not very good - not as described on menu.  However, I would still recommend it highly.",4,2011,04,11
203,Perfectly located hotel with exceptional service,"Went to the Westbury for a weekend trip to dublin. It's perfectly located in the center of the irish capital and the service was exceptional! Great shopping and the Trinity college as a starting point for sightseeing in closest distance. The only minor drawback - if you need one - was the minibar, as this was really more a bar than a fridge.",5,2011,04,08
203,"Luxury, relaxation, location and lovely staff",I love staying at The Westbury because from the minute you reach the front door your looked after. Your car is parked for you bags are taken to your  room for you. Check in is always quick. They are best beds you have ever slept and I always get a great night. Rooms are dark and quite at night. Three words location location location,5,2011,04,06
203,Perfect Location,"We stayed at the Westbury for 3 nights, March 15-18 and enjoyed our stay.  The hotel is perfectly situated on Grafton Street and within walking distance to most attractions, shopping,  great pubs and the hop-on-hop-off bus tours. There is a Taxi stand in front of the hotel. The service at the hotel was very good and the concierge was terrific.  We did not eat at the hotel because the prices were very high. Skip the 29 Euro charge for breakfast and eat at one of the many pubs and restaurants for a full Irish breakfast for 10Euro.  The food was great at every pub we stopped at and O'Neils, a 3 minute walk from the hotel, was terrific for food - you won't be disappointed by the fish and chips- and also the live music in the upstairs bar.
My only complaint with the hotel is that the room and bathroom were very small and quite crowded for 2 people. It was impossible for 2 people to be in the bathroom at the same time. However, everything was well appointed and the beds and pillows extremely comfortable.",5,2011,04,06
203,A great choice in Dublin,"after our stay in Cork which was terrible, I was pleased that this hotel is really a 5 star hotel.   Other than the desk clerk that got snooty when we checked in --but then he was not irish.- we had good service.   The room was nice, the housekeeping was done well.  The drink prices in the bar were very high.   The price we paid for the room was quite reasonable for the type of hotel this was. the location was great, there was shopping nearby, restaurants,  centra stores,  the hop on hop off bus, all within walking distance.",5,2011,04,03
203,Excellent hotel in a great location and 5 star rooms.,"Really nice hotel with gorgeous and comfortable furnishings. The coffee machine is a great touch. My only gripe with this hotel is breakfast, very expensive (¬£100 for 5 people) for a buffet and you can get better for less just outside the hotel. My Partners is a vegetarian but the chef was using the same utensils for the meat and the non meat stuff - made a comment to the lady on the desk but she was not really bothered.",5,2011,04,03
203,A True 5-star Experience,"Stayed at the Westbury for 7 nights (includiong St. Patricks Day!) with my wife and daughter and found this hotel to be truly exceptional. The location off Grafton Street is perfect for connecting anywhere in Dublin, yet has all you ever need within a few minutes walk from the hotel door. The rooms were impeccaby clean and attended twi ce daily by an exceptionally friendly and courteous staff. And speaking of staff, the people who are your hosts (""hosts"" seems a more fitting phrase than ""employees"") go to the max to ensure that your stay is a pleasnt and memotable one. The 4 conceirge  we met and dealt with and doormen all make you feel as though you are the only guests in the hotel and really do all they can to answer questions and give good , honest advice and suggestions. And all of this is done with a genuine friendly smile, and oftentimes a good laugh. In fact, the ""attitude"" of the people who work at this hotel and the generaland ambience"" are more like a small B&B than a major city hotel. One never has that no-descript corporate feel round in so many urban hotes. And be sure to save one speciial nifght out to eat at Wilde, the hotel restaurant. Again, like everything else at this hotel, it was truly a 5-star experienc but without the too ften accompanying stuffiness.
The lobby and public areas are maintined to 5-star standards and are very comfotable and pleasant in appearance. Front desk staff know how to welcome international travel- weary guests (whose luggage was left in Detroit by KLM) such that within a few minutes we simply put all that behind us, and when it arrived the next day, thay saw to it that it was taken immediately to our room . I thought i would remember all the names of the people at the hotel, but alas i cannott, so for fear of forgetting someone, suffice it to say that we have never experienced a more welcoming, efficiemnt and pleasnat hotel staff, across the board, then we found at the Westbury. Whatever amangement is doing, keep it up...it is working. We had one little minor problem in the room, and Ronan O""Halloran, Asst. Mgr., had it attended to immediately. But perhaps all this is simply a part of the Irish 
""personality"". This was our first trip to Ireland and we found everybody in all walks of life friendly, courteous and helpful....more than anyplace we have been in recent memory, and we travel frequently. Ireland is an ""easy "" country to visit, its magical beauty is spellbinding, and the Westbury Hotel is truly a great place to stay.",5,2011,03,30
203,Best hotel I've ever stayed in.,"I've just come back from 2 nights with my partner in this hotel. I can honestly say it was the best hotel I've ever stayed in. It was pure class from start to finish. The staff were superb (particularly Anna on reception) the room was beautiful, tasteful, not gaudy, the bed was like a cloud to sleep on, the linen crisp, the toiletries were top class, even the choice of tv channels was excellent. We spent both evenings in the lobby/bar (after our meals) which was comfortable, classy. The turndown service was a lovely surprise:) we really really would recommend this hotel, you really do get what u pay for. Top class, old world, chic hotel, with outstanding staff and service. The location is superb also. We have booked another weekend later in the year. Book this hotel, do yourself a favour:) top top class",5,2011,03,29
203,Luxury and comfort in perfect Dublin location!,"From the bellman, to the front desk, to the managers and their lobby staff---everyone was gracious, attentive, polite and helpful.  We arrived very early in the morning after a red-eye flight, and were very comfortable waiting in the lobby lounge and the cafe, enjoying a complimentary light breakfast.  We were graciously offered a room upgrade, and gratefully accepted it by 10 am.  Our room was luscious, quiet, perfectly appointed, and the bed was heavenly.  The location, just a half-block off Grafton Street, is ideal for touring Trinity, Temple Bar, the Grafton St. shopping district.  In fact, we were easily able to walk the 2 blocks from the AirCoach bus stop.  We adored the breakfast buffet, and the beautiful lobby lounge, where we met our traveling companions for drinks before dinner.  We returned to the Westbury after 5 days of touring the Irish countryside, and were pleased that so many staff welcomed us back by name. We cannot wait to return, and will recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2011,03,29
203,"Rude and Snobby, There are better hotels than this in Dublin. Stay away!","My wife and I stayed at the Westbury on Friday night. She arrived that afternoon and was immediately made to feel like she didn't belong there. 
My immpression of the place is that it's like the Brown Thomas of hotels. Just because you can afford to stay there doesn't mean you are going to be made feel welcome. 

Also, When we went to exit the carpark on our departure the shutter door for the car park was stuck halfway down for about 10 minutes. I went to call reception and surprise surprise there was no answer.

For a supposedly 5 star hotel I would have expected better.

Our stay at the Trinity Capital hotel the previous week was luxury in comparison.

203,The most superior hotel experience of all the hotels I visit in the world,"I cannot over state the quality of service, food, rooms, location of this Hotel. Been staying here 3 times  per year for about 7 years and it just gets better. An Oasis in a business where service quality is generally forgotten. If only the other cities in the world had similar hotels, my work and travel experience would just be so much more pleasant.",5,2011,03,26
203,One of the best hotel experiences ever!,"My husband and I just returned from a trip to Ireland. We started with a stay (just the 2 of us) in Dublin at the Westbury Hotel and then returned there later on in the trip to stay another 2 nights with our daughter. We were so happy with our stay the first night that we really looked forward to going back there later in the trip. The location could not be more perfect--right near the Grafton Street area, close enough to see it, but not so close as to be bothered by any noise. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was really big, so clean and comfortable. The bed was delicious, bathroom amenities plentiful and shower was strong and warm. We heartily recommend the Westbury Hotel and would go back there in a heartbeat.",5,2011,03,20
203,"Great location, 5 star.","Refurbishment of the rooms is fantastic.  Luxury feel throughout the hotel with excellent service where nothing is too much trouble and no dramas.  I never got the feeling that they were looking for ways to charge you for breathing like many famous hotels do.  Room rates were comparable and perhaps more reasonable compared to other 5 stars including conrad and Shelbourn and I think westbury is now better with the refurbished rooms and excellent graft on street location.  

I did find the air conditioning unit in the room a little loud and annoying when trying to sleep however this is a common problem of mine in hotels.  Perhaps ear plugs in future.... 

Had some sort of suite with small sitting area and outdoor roof terrace which was locked for safety unfortunately.   Breakfast excellent.  On check out I was in a rush to catch a plane and staff went and got me some fruit and pastries in a bag to take with me.  That is 5 star service to me!  

Highly recommended for difficult to please and demanding individuals like myself!",5,2011,03,16
203,"Excellent hotel, great stay","I wanted to treat my other half by taking her to see Usher in concert. I decided to book the Westbury as it has a reputation of being one of the best hotels in Dublin. I wasn't disappointed.

Situated in the centre of town near Grafton street its right in the middle of the action.
It is well presented and looks modern from the outside. The lobby area inside is very smart and staff are helpful and polite.

Our room was excellent. Bed was very comfortable and rooms were pretty soundproof. There was a large wall mounted LCD TV with loads of channels, a kettle for tea and a nespresso machine for coffee. The bathroom was nice and powerful, and the soaps provided were excellent. The decor of the room was very stylish and gave it a contemporary smart feel.

We also had tea in the lobby cafe area. This had a great ambiance and the tea + fresh made cookies were of great quality.

Whole hotel had free wifi too, very very useful to keep roaming charges down!

We even found that Usher and his crew were staying at the hotel! Nice touch.

I'd definitely recommend the Westbury....pricy but a very good quality hotel.",4,2011,03,16
203,I loved this hotel,"This was a beatuful hotel, everything thing was about you and ensuring that you had a wonderful stay!

The location is just perfect, smack bang in the middle of the beautiful Grafton St. Close to great restaurants, shops and bars, i will definitely return here.",5,2011,03,10
203,Perfect!!,"The location of this hotel is amazing, your in the center of everything! It cannot be beaten on location. The hotel inside is very impressive, clean and the staff were very helpful! We arrived way before check in time but our rooms were ready only a short while after wards. On arrival we were given complimentary drinks which was a nice touch.

I can recommend this hotel and Dublin, both are very impressive!",5,2011,03,07
203,A hotle to be highly recommended,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were impressed by the porters who managed our luggage to and from the bedroom and took care of the car once we arrived. The receptionist on checking out  Cashier 90085, Sunday 06/03 was one of the best we have ever encountered. The temperature in the restaurant on Saturday night was, however,  too hot. The restaurant service was  highly efficient.",5,2011,03,07
203,Excellent Location and Service,"We stayed at The Westbury for three nights at the end of Feb. This was our first time in Dublin. On arrival we had a warm welcome as our luggage was taken up to reception. We were given warm hand towels as a refresher whilst checking in and complimentary tea whilst we waited for our room. There is a lovely scent to the hotel lounge and reception and this must be from the beautiful array of fresh flowers. Considering we arrived at 9am before check in starts our room was made available very quickly. The room was good, I wouldn't say 5 star though. Bathroom was nice also although I did feel the shower was low on power, could have been updated. Our coffee machine didn't work but they brought up fresh coffee as and when requested. The concierge was excellent and the manager also in fact the service from all star was excellent. The manager recommended a great restaurant for us to try and managed to get us a table on a busy saturday night. The location is superb everything is a short walk away and there are great shops, bars, cafes and restaurants literally a couple of mins walk from the hotel.  We really enjoyed our stay.",4,2011,03,05
203,perfect stay,cant complain about anything over here but can be made more luxurious...great job anyway,4,2011,03,03
203,Level of service was amazing... outdid any hotel stay I've had in just a night.,"Stayed at the Westbury for just one night in Dublin before heading elsewhere in Ireland for business.  The level of service was fantastic, and while the hotel is not 'value-priced', I thought that the price paid was not outrageous, especially when the location, comfort, and amazing service is taken into account.

My new favorite hotel in Dublin!",5,2011,03,02
203,"Excellent hotel, best in Dublin but check your mini-bar charges","Great place to stay, central, excellent food and very clean.  Light bulb socket blew up in the bathroom (these things happen) and left shattered glass all over the floor, called front desk and someone came within seconds, they took care of it right away, very impressive service. My only complaint: at check out, there were 11(!) mini-bar charges for items I did not take, 46 euros worth, from jelly beans to vodka. They cleared them off the bill right away without arguing, which was surprising, but do check your charges.",4,2011,03,02
203,This is the No.1 Hotel in Dublin.,"I stayed in the Westbury for one night and I only wish it was a longer stay.  The rooms are luxurious, clean and comfortable.  The extras such as the nespresso machines, robes, slippers, water and chocolates, and turndown service are a treat.  I was also lucky enough to have champagne and a fruit plate on arrival, which set a perfect mood for the whole stay.  
The lobby is relaxing and there are great views over Grafton St.  Perfect for a relaxing afternoon of people watching.  The staff in this hotel are amazing.  I have never experienced such fantastic customer service to date.
I have stayed in two other 5 star hotels in Dublin and this has to be the best.  I really think this should be the No.1 hotel on the tripadvisor website.  I will definately be staying again and will be looking forward to many return visits.  I will be recommending this hotel to all my friends and family who are considering staying in Dublin city centre.",5,2011,03,01
203,"Fantastic, dont listen to the bad reviews!","Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights pre-return to england. WOW!!!!

Yes the hotel might look very extravagant, but its like that all the way through. from the moment i pulled up outside to the valet parking, to the check-in, to room service. i felt like i was the only person in the hotel. the level of detail and attention i got as a person was amazing. i found myself at ease and comfortable at once.

Our room was a tad smaller than i expected for the money i had paid, but seeing as we were on a sight seeing holiday, i found we didn't use the room all that much. inside the hotel there is a lounge area where you can sit and relax with no pressure. a bar. a bar/grill where we ate and had a brilliant meal. but best of all was the main restaurant. we were served like royalty. just a fantastic bunch of staff who talked to each other, always knew what was going on and generally made a lot of effort to make us welcome and invited to be there.

the location of the hotel was brilliant. we left the main front of the hotel and was greeted by a pedestrian shopping center within 30 seconds walk. the front door staff were very eager to help us find our way about, made recommendations that had nothing to do with the hotel, so i felt they were actually interested in making our stay that little bit special.

Overall i wish i had booked a longer stay in Dublin and spent more time seeing the sights.",5,2011,02,24
203,"beautiful hotel, excellent location, wonderful service",The staff was very helpful at all times..accept for one night manager who was very rude..all others made up for him..,5,2011,02,24
203,EXCELLENT STAY AND BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION - WESTBURY AND DUBLIN,"We stayed at this Hotel due to the fact we had to cancel a cruise holiday for my birthday, due to an urgent operation required and i was informed by the surgeon not to travel too far as part of my recovery.

We have stayed in Dublin approximateley 5 plus times and always find different places to stay and things to do. We are not into the Temple Bar stags and hens and wanted to stay just out of that area and Grafton St is still busy but away from Temple Bar.

Location of the Westbury Hotel was excellent, the staff were brilliant to name a few JD the Supervisor for the waiters, Ledia the waitress, Katrina at reception etc.

On arrival at 0930hrs our room was not yet cleaned even though technically we were not supposed to have the room till around 1200hrs, we were offered a complimentary coffee or tea after our journey by Katrina on reception. On drinking the coffee, and ""chilling"" we were advised the  room was cleaned and non smoking room as requested. We were allowed to go to our room straight away on a busy Saturday morning

Thank you Katrina and the Westbury!

We booked that morning the Champagne afternoon tea and thoroughly enjoyed it (you only get one glass of champagne, which was no problem for us, my better half had it, but you can buy an extra glass at EURO 18).

The waitress Ledia and JD who served us were excellent during this and the food was plenty - cost EURO 31 and we were full that afternoon and didnt need anything to eat till later that night - It was excellent and enjoyable watching from the window people going along Grafton St and the Bruxelles Bar

The Bruxelles Bar, is situated across from the Hotel and McDAIDS bar opposite as well

Drank a pint of Guiness in Bruxelles bar and it was a pleasant pub. Not too much noise heard of a night from the bars from the hotel room we stayed at, which was facing the bars and Grafton St( We stayed Sat/sun/mon/tue) 

Regarding the room - the wardrobes do have ""full length glass mirrors!"" on the doors as previous reviewer complained about... this was adequate for our needs and if we needed anything from the staff we received it immediateley, no delays.

We did receive complimentary  cakes for my birthday and each night a chocolate was on each pillow and bottled water was provided as well as shower gel/shampoo etc
There is an adequate iron/ironing board and coffee making machine facilities as well as tea bags( we did ask for normal tea bags/milk and this was provided, no delay).

Even in the lift with staff members going about their duties they were asking if we were having a good stay and where we were going that day( had not met these persons before except in the lift!)

The bathroom was fine, cleaned daily and big enough for both of us.

Only minor point was the pillows on the bed were too soft for me due to the operations i had, had BUT no major issue- not sure if they were goose feather type etc???  

On arrival at the hotel our Irish Taxi driver recommended  a quiet pub called Foleys Bar on Bagot St with the old irish music and nice food.. He was right we had a great time and a few meals there, excellent- even the barman Vinny bought us a drink on my birthday...NICE TOUCH!( DIRECTIONS - Come out of the Westbury , turn right onto Grafton St...walk upto St Stephens Green ..... turn left and walk for about 5-10 mins past the Shelborne Hotel towards Merrion Row, past the Spar shop on the left and you will see the Foleys bar sign...Across the road was Odonoghues Bar...taxi driver also recommended this pub as well, but we just enjoyed Foleys bar and frequented this one so cant comment on the other bar).

FOLEYS BAR, BAGOT ST: -Great bar and meals -  you can still get served by waitresses or go to the bar whilst busy and you are not ""hemmed in"" as you would be at TEMPLE BAR 

Would i stay again in the Westbury .... i certainly would and would recommend this hotel to any one who wants a chill out, little bit of luxury and enjoyable stay. Staff at the hotel were excellent!
Thankyou",5,2011,02,24
203,"Awful Service, sub standard room","The Hotel is all front, our room  was small and had no full length mirror as we were dining out this was something I would call essential. 
I asked three times at reception and was assured each time that a mirror was on its way finally I had to stand until someone came with me and brought a mirror.

The Hotel itself seems lovely at first glance but not impressed with customer service or the pokey room

Go to The Fitzwillliam or anywhere else. 2 star service, 3 star room at most at the Westbury.

We are in Dublin often on business but as this was pleasure we decided to treat ourselves, believe me this was no treat.",3,2011,02,18
203,One word...Amazing!,Our 2 days stay at the Westbury was incredible. The location is perfect with Grafton St. directly out the front doors. The staff could not have been nicer. I wish I could remember everyone's names but Sinead who greeted us in the lobby was most welcoming. Our lovely tea was delivered by Olga and she attended to our every need.  The rooms are very spacious and sparkling clean. The extra touches of lovely soaps and lotions add extra touch. The coffee and tea machine in your room makes relaxing just a bit more homey. I cant wait to go back and recommend this hotel to everyone!!,5,2011,02,17
203,Short Stay in Dublin,"Very comfortable, great breakfast, centrally located, free internet..all you need.",5,2011,02,16
203,what a 5 star should be !!,"lovely rooms, great location and friendly staff.........my new home from home in dublin",5,2011,02,14
203,Excellent Stay from start to finish,"My husband and I stayed at the Westbury for five days last week.  The hotel is lovely, clean and very centrally located.  There were bars, restaurants and shops literally on the doorstep but the hotel felt very private and secluded once you were in your room.  Our trip included my 40th birthday and the staff went above and beyond to help my husband make the day special, providing complimentary bottle of wine to go with the cake he ordered and making sure my flowers had a vase for their display.  We were accomodated with an early check in as soon as we entered the hotel about 9:30am and were even given an upgrade to an executive room.  The front desk was great wtih restaurant recommendations and never steered us wrong!  When we return to Dublin, we won't stay anywhere else but the Westbury!",5,2011,02,14
203,Perfect stay,"We have stayed at the Westbury several times and cannot fault it. Excellent service,very comfortable and clean and breakfast is perfect. Will be visiting again this summer and looking forward to it. Highly recommended.",5,2011,02,10
203,Excellent location and service,"The hotel was lovely and so were the staff. 
We had the conference in the hotel and te facilities were excellent. The hotel is not far from the main shopping area and right in the heart of Dublin although amazingly quiet (I have stayed in a lovely hotel in Temple Bar and been kept awake by dreadful noise so this was a blessing!)",5,2011,02,08
203,Best Hotel in Ireland,"I stayed in the Westbury for 7 nights, from Australia. From check-in to the bar staff, service was friendly, attentive and helpful. There must be 50 restaurants and bars with 200 metres of the Hotel, the location is unbeatable. Make sure you enjoy a few afternoon teas in the lounge area - very popular with the locals and very busy. The Hotel has a great vibe and next time in Ireland I will only stay at the Westbury - and hopefully for longer",5,2011,02,05
203,It's all grand at the Westbury,"There for the weekend, me and my boyfriend stayed at the Westbury for three nights. In possibly the perfect location, nestled just off the busy Grafton street, the hotel was impressive, with three restaurants and a cocktail lounge. The rooms were spotless, with immense attention to detail (the turndown service was a lovely unexpected touch- done as a standard precedure). The staff were very friendly and helpful, the night desk officer Najuib was particularly hospitable and engaging, and he ensured we had everything we needed. The chamber maid who did the turndown was also very attentive and professional. Despite the weather being poor, as you might expect in Ireland at this time of year (we were provided with a large umbrella for the duration of our trip), we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and if we visit Dublin in the future we will be sure to visit the Westbury again. ",5,2011,02,04
203,"Amazing location and hotel, highly recommend!","My husband and I spent 3 nights at the Westbury Hotel: December 27th-30th. We booked based on the amazing reviews on tripadvisor and were not disappointed! Everything about it was fantastic!

The location is ideal for people who want to be near the action. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go within Dublin. It is located right off of Grafton Street with tons of shops, restaurants and pubs within easy reach. Even the walk to temple bar wasn't long-maybe 15 minutes. It is less than 2 minutes to walk to Bewleys which we found to be excellent for breakfast or a light lunch. Their tea and coffees are amazing!

We stayed in their standard room (no upgrade) and it was more than suitable. The beds were very comfortable, had coffee/tea facilities, flat screen tv, free wifi and a gorgeous bathroom. We received a turndown service each night, which also included a small bottle of water each, chocolates on the pillow and one night-a small christmas cake! We did not have breakfast included in our package, but were offered complimentary ""mini buffet"" each morning in the main area of the hotel. This included coffee/tea, orange juice and an assortment of pastries (mini croissants and such). 

The staff were very helpful and friendly throughout the trip. I can honestly say if I were to return to Dublin, I would absolutely stay here again!",5,2011,02,04
203,The best location & service in Dublin,"The Westbury is very conveniently located right on Grafton Street. I had room & Breakfast package and enjoyed my stay very much. The rooms are very comfortable, the service is outstanding and of course you cannot beat the location, just super ! For breakfast you have a basic continental breakfast buffet but when you have breakfast included in your rate you can order anything from the hot item menu. All was just wonderful. 
I definitely be back next time in Dublin.",4,2011,02,03
203,excellent service and friendly and helpful staff,"the hotell staff generally have been helpful to me all the time specially Najuib, night reception manager and Geraldine Blighe, daytime manager. They both made me welcome and comfortable everytime time I stayed in the hotel. I highly recommend this hotel to all for its high quality service",5,2011,02,02
203,Great location & very comfortable,"Nice hotel in a great central location.  Very comfortable, clean and great bedding.  Not sure if 5 star though?  The first room we were given the air con/heating was broken so we were moved.  Ok in 2nd room.  We got a good price on this hotel (approx 120‚Ç¨ room only) via hotels.com and wouldn't have been happy to have paid any more than that.  In room safe as expected and nice touch with nespresso coffee machine.",4,2011,02,01
203,cause for concern!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ive just arrived home after staying in the so called five star wesbury and im still upset,on arrival the hot towel was nice but unnecessary, stayed in room 618 the water pump kept making a horrible sound everytime you used any untensils especially the toilet it would run for at least five minutes after using it this was not good at 2am, i could not get back to sleep,there was hair on the bathroom floor,and a long hair strand in the sink,i feel this hotel needs to re-train there staff on how to clean a coffee machine,this was disgusting there was a used pod still in it and the machine still had water in it,im no bye-law expert but im sure stagnate water carries some form of contamination,when i went down to reception to complain i was told that some one from housekeeping would contact me,im still waiting.i have stayed in all the five star hotel around the green this is the worst, if your looking at this try the fitzwilliam or the shelbourne you will not be disappointed.",2,2011,01,31
203,Fantastic stay in luxury hotel in central Dublin,"My wife & I have just returned from a Saturday night stay in The Westbury Hotel. We requested an early check in & arrived at 12.00 noon & our room was ready. While we were checking we were given hot towels to freshen up - a great idea & the first time we experienced this in Ireland. We were also upgraded & the room was fantastic, huge, four poster bed, great bathroom etc. - pure luxury!.
We had afternoon tea & headed off to a show in The National Concert Hall & then dinner. We returned to the hotel later that night & enjoyed a few drinks in the hotel bar. We retired to our room later that night & were delighted wit the goodies left in our room - Lily O'Brien chocs, a plate if chocolate & cake, complimentary water & slippers!.
Next morning we received our requested complimentary Sunday newspaper & then headed down for a super breakfast, all one could want was available & all the other guest looked very happy!. We left the hotel very happy & are really looking forward to a return visit in March. Thanks to all the staff & particularly Sarah for looking after us, this is indeed a truly 5 star experience in central Dublin",5,2011,01,31
203,"A few personnel problems, but overall a fine hotel.","The Westbury Hotel is truly in the perfect location in Dublin. Although it's right on Grafton Street, it's at the end of the street and away from the noise. The hotel itself is pretty -- especially the sitting room area in the lobby -- if a touch too modern (too much chrome). We had a suite (two separate rooms with a door that closed) and it was comfortable, roomy and had everything you could want in the rooms. The bathroom was also just fine, although the water pressure in both the shower and the sink was very low. I'm not sure if this is a typical of Dublin hotels, or just this one.

Other notes from our stay:

** Housekeeping was exceptional. Everything was spotless and the room was serviced twice a day.
The housekeeping staff was also very nice.

** By and large the staff was very pleasant and friendly -- especially the Irish staff. There were three exceptions -- two of them European waiters, and one a desk clerk (more on that below). We were sitting down for tea in the lobby around 10:30pm (it wasn't busy) and the waiter couldn't seem to understand us, or get us what we wanted. It took nearly 20 minutes to get tea and ice cream. There was also a waiter in the dining room (breakfast was included with our package), who kept addressing my husband(i.e. treated me like I was the ""little wife""), and all but ignored me. He also had a snootiness that was not only wrong but ridiculous.

** The hotel is too big (200 rooms) to be a really warm place, but it was less appealing  by the fact that there a convention/sales meeting for two of our four days (although good for Dublin's shaky economy!). The group seemed to take over all of the public rooms and even their meetings could be heard from the lobby. This was not an enjoyable atmosphere for someone on vacation. Perhaps it's less business orientated in the summer.

**We walked by some of the other 5 star hotels in the area (Shelbourne, Fitzwilliam etc.) and there's no question that The Westbury is in a better location. The others were on very busy streets with lots of traffic flowing in front of the hotels. The Westbury is essential on a dead end street and there is virtually no traffic. Highest marks for the location.

** We had some problems at checkout very early in the am. The desk clerk tried to charge us for an extra night (we had early check in but had confirmation that we weren't going to be charged for it). When I pointed this out to him he kept insisting that we had to pay. I outright refused, and told him to get in touch with the reservation manager who was extremely nice and helpful (Ms.O'Carroll) when she set this up. This desk clerk was not a native English speaker and didn't know how to spell her name or who she was. I wrote it out for him. He suddenly became apologetic and took off the charge. I was quite annoyed at being treated this way and said so. 

** It is really easy to get a taxi at the hotel. There is a taxi stand right outside and taxis were always plentiful. Every taxi driver we had was
excellent and friendly. 

Overall, saying at the Westbury is a nice, but a rather impersonal experience. A ""welcome back"" would go a long way during a hotel stay, but the desk staff and concierges never even looked up when guests were at the elevators -- right in front of their positions too! But the hotel is comfortable, well maintained and has a brilliant location. The housekeeping staff is amongst the best I've ever encountered in all of my years of traveling (and they are exceptionally nice as well). A little more Irish charm would go a long way in this hotel (we encountered that charm in most places in the city).",4,2011,01,30
203,Very very good,"Only a one-nighter at this highly recommended hotel and it was a very enjoyable stay. Staff were efficient and polite, room was well appointed and spotless. Unfortunately the hotel's main restaurant was closed for dinner the night I stayed but the concierge recommended an excellent restaurant nearby.

Staff were friendly and efficient and breakfast was decent.",5,2011,01,29
203,Excellent Service,"Though I arrived much earlier than regular check in hours, the night duty manager went out of his way to be accommodating, courteous and helpful.  Mr Majid really set the tone for a delightful experience.  Great location too.....",5,2011,01,26
203,"Outstanding Location, Facilities and Staff","As a regular basis traveler to Dublin, I am often a guest at the Westbury Hotel. The central location off of Grafton Street is perfect, the rooms are nicely appointed and comfortable, the restaurants offer good choices with the highest quality cuisines. But, what makes the overall experience all the better is the professionalism, customer focus, friendliness and care of the staff. As an executive responsible for a large services organization, I am extremely impressed by the overall customer experience at the Weston. In particular, the night manager, Najib, is always extremely helpful and accommodating, even at ungodly hours. David, a bellman there, is also very helpful.  Others too numerous to mention ensure that I'll continue to use the Westbury as my base in the near and distant future.",5,2011,01,25
203,"Great hotel, great location","The Westbury is a lovely hotel.  Located off of Grafton street, you can't find a better location.  It's convenient for shopping, food and business.  It can be difficult to get to by car due to the pedistrian only streets and the one way streets, but once there, very nice.  Love, love, love the esspresso machines in the rooms, very nice.  The fitness center leaves a bit to be desired, but it's ok.  There is a gym behind the hotel that you can get daily passes to.",5,2011,01,24
203,Perfect,"The hotel is very well located for a business trip but it is the service that makes it so special. Arriving early on an overnight flight, the hotel accommodated me immediately. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the internet was easily accessible and the breakfast was a treat. A great start to a business trip. I have to make a special mention of Mr. Najib Majid for his exceptional service from the front desk but all the staff were helpful and accommodating and retained a sense of humor. I look forward to returning again soon.",5,2011,01,15
203,"Great Hotel, great location","If you're coming to Dublin and can afford to splurge on your hotel I have no problem in recommending The Westbury. It is in the heart of Dublin located just off Grafton Street and very close to St. Stephen's. Close to the Luas (tram) green line if you need to head south for business or trips.

The staff are very friendly and helpful. They even offer you a hot, wet towel to freshen yourself up with as you are checking in!

The rooms are well appointed with LCD TVs, a decent coffee maker (free coffee provided) and free in-room Wi-Fi.

Room service was very quick but I would steer clear of the fish and chips, my fish wasn't at all good (maybe a one off). I haven't tried the main restaurant but the cafe on the ground floor is pretty good.

Haven't stayed long enough to warrant bringing gym clothes so haven't tried that out yet.",5,2011,01,09
203,My favourite hotel in Dublin by far..,"We are currently living in Canada and were home for a fortnight at the beginning of December.We spent a weekend in Dublin to catch up with friends without our two little girls...We always stay at The Westbury and again it didnt dissapoint....The Westbury is simply special...waking up beside Grafton Street,5 star  professional and genuinely friendly service,a perfect break from whatever normality is for you....Our tv didnt work properly and we were promptly moved to a suite by Joseph (A gem) the Manager who literally couldnt do enough for us....Ireland is going through a hard time right now but its the service you get somewhere like The Westbury that will bring it back from this tough time...I couldnt reccommend this hotel highly enough and cant wait for our next stay there.",5,2011,01,03
203,New Year at Westbury,"We stayed 3 nights at Westbury Hotel  in the new years weekend. Very nice hotel with a warm welcome in the reception. The nice lady in the reception had time to talk with us even on very busy day. We felt we were very welcome to the hotel, we  had  good rooms and the espresso machine was superb. We didnt try any of the restaurants, but we ordered irish and continental breakfast to the room one morning. It was perfect with a  lot of different things, but the hot food was very disappointing. I had scrambled egg that tasting water, bacon which was tasting burned and the sausages was tasting nothing, only full of fat. I think the chef for the hoot food should find another job, since everything else was so nice. The hotels location is perfect, and they cleaned the room very good and changed bed linen every morning. 
The most negative was when we leaved early in the morning and I asked the night receptionist to  call for a taxi to the airport since there were no taxi outsides the hotels own taxi place. He was not to happy to do this and say to me I should have done this the day before. But he called and after a while he told that it gonna take 30 minutes to wait. I was not to happy about this, a hotel-employee at a top hotel like this should never say to a guest what he should do or not.
But overall, a very nice stay at Westbury in Dublin.",4,2011,01,02
203,Exceptional Service. Fabulous Location. Wonderful Hotel,I stayed at the Westbury for four nights just before Christmas.  Everything was just wonderful. A really marvellous experience in a beautiful city.  Attention to detail was evident in all areas.  I would recommend this wholeheartedly to anyone coming to Dublin.,5,2010,12,28
203,"Such a delight, we've stayed here twice!","We totally agree with the previous review - 

The Westbury is perfect, easily the best hotel in Dublin! We've stayed here twice for each of our last two wedding anniversaries and we fully intend to make this an annual tradition. The is no better place to celebrate and soak up the festive atmosphere, especially during the blizzard which covered Dublin in a thick blanket of snow this year.

We initially intended to stay in a different 5 star dublin hotel each year to celebrate our anniversary on Dec 22nd. So far we've tried the Merrion and the Shelbourne, both if which were nice but neither of whom can match the Westbury for it's pure elegance and impeccable service 

Hats off the to Lisa on the front desk who booked us in at very short notice and having checked details of our previous stay, immediately upraged us to Suite 444, the same room as before and managed to squeeze us in for afternoon tea which is truly remarkable because as I've mentioned in a previous review, afternoon tea at the Westbury is a very popular festive tradition in Dublin and it's extremely busy during Christmas week. She also rang me promptly at 8.30 am to confirm an early check in at 1pm so I could take a little rest after a very early start to the day and freshen up before my wife arrived. Once again we were also greated with free wine, delicious complimentary chocolates and a very kind welcome note from the GM to thank us for a repeat stay.

Perhaps one very slight negative is the ‚Ç¨20 charge per vehicle for valet parking but I reckon it's worth it for the convenience of simply handing over your keys on arrival and making way directly up the impressive marble stairway to a warm reception from attentive staff who treat you like an old friend returning after a lengthy absence.

This hotel has enduring quality. Unlike some other hotels which we've re-visited and found disppointing on our second stay the Westbury was twice as nice second time around. It is consistently topclass. They obviously value and encourage repeat business.

The Westbury has added considerable sparkle to a very happy occaison and we will deinfitely make this an annual event. We'd like to thank all of the staff from the front door through to housekeeping and especially Lisa on the front desk. 

The Westbury is wonderful. It is easily the best so from now on we will forget about the rest!

STAY HERE!",5,2010,12,24
203,"Perfect, Best Hotel in Dublin ...","We stayed at this hotel last night and it was wonderful... we were meeting friends for a our annual christmas get together and decided to stay in the city rather than try and get home...with the weather being so awful...one word.........''WOW'!
what an amazing hotel, recently renovated it is truly 5 star (where others in the city struggle to live up to 5 stars) beautiful room, attention to detail and service second to none, even better than the De Russie in Rome!! The general manager Edward looked after us so well. This hotel has just been added to our christmas tradition list, we will definitely be back...hopefuly during the year , but if not definitely next christmas!
Fantastic!  Well done to all the staff,  Happy Christmas",5,2010,12,23
203,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed inthe Westbury for two nights, and could not fault it. We got a great deal (for a 5* from their own website) b&b & evening meal for ‚Ç¨299! the location is superb, the rooms beautiful and the staff are lovely. The food was delicious, the parking is outrageous but then what would you expect on Grafton street! Would highly recommend it.",5,2010,12,15
203,Superb,"This is an excellent hotel.  Friendly, competent staff.  Ideal city centre location (car park is, however, a bit cramped).  The bedrooms and bathrooms are excellent with good amenities and facilities.",5,2010,12,12
203,The friendliness was out of this world and the cleniness was suberb,"There was one night when i could not get the heating to work properly, due to my own fault, and they showed me what to do but in the meantime one of the kinesest domestic lady's brought up a heater to the room until the air conditioning heated the room for us.",4,2010,12,09
203,Great place to stay,"I had booked a less expensive hotel nearby and it turned out to be a dump. Using the internet, I found a great weekend 3 night rate so I walked to the Westbury and they agreed to honor the rate. I booked the room on the spot and went to the other hotel to retrieve my luggage. Good move!

We were very pleased with the location but would caution that some rooms facing Grafton 
Street can be a bit noisy as there is a pub just out the front door. A minor inconvenience in light of the quality of the hotel. 

 It is a very pedestrian friendly area with a lot to see and do. Highly recommended!

A minor inconvenience in light of the facilitates and location. 
I look forward to our next stay.",4,2010,12,08
203,Without a shadow of doubt......,"....the best hotel in Dublin! The location, style and sheer elegance cannot be matched.

We have stayed in the perfectly formed standard rooms, sumptuous suites and the phenomenal Presidential suite in this property all of which are head and shoulders above their rivals in the city.

A truly exceptional hotel.",5,2010,12,06
203,Excellent hospitality with style and everything on the doorstep.,"Returning to The Westbury we knew what to expect - relaxed five star service with all that fashionable Grafton Street has to offer on the doorstep. This is as good as it gets if you want immediate access to Dublin's most chic shopping district and yet have a luxury base to nip back to for a restful coffee in The Gallery or perhaps a Cosmopolitan in the bar! The Guinness is not bad either!

Arriving by car can be challenging if one is not familiar with the warren of back streets that one needs to negotiate in order to arrive at the front entrance. No problem for returning guests but it could pose a challenge for a tourist driving in Dublin for the first time. Valet parking from there, however, and it is straight to Reception. Concierge provides an excellent service and it is well worth seeking advice on local attractions if you are planning the day ahead. Check in is always a busy place, it seems. On this occasion they had no record of the booking but some discrete back office consultation by reception staff resolved the issue within minutes. The welcome back is always nice to hear.

Accommodation, as in the past, was very comfortable and met all our needs. Accommodation staff were helpful  and there was effective sound proofing from the bustle and din of the city outside.

We opted for the continental breakfast on this occasion. This is available in The Gallery and was perfectly adequate for our needs.

Dinner in the restaurant was a pleasant surprise. It was very late when we arrived and there were few patrons in the dining room. Yet the meal was very good and service was excellent. Considering the time it was noteworthy that the restaurant staff  made it clear that we could take as long as we wished over the meal.  It was very reasonably priced in our estimation and it certainly added to our experience overall. 

Part of the attraction of this hotel's public areas for many people seems to be meeting for coffee and indulging in a little people watching. This makes for a busy foyer and certainly The Gallery is a busy but comfortable meeting place for old friends.

Just a few metres from the front door one has the benefit of the joie de vivre of the flower sellers and the multitudes traipsing up and down Grafton Street. Venture a little further and you can enjoy the wonderful green oasis that is Stephen's Green. Many historic and cultural sites such as Trinity College and Dail Eireann (Irish parliament) to name but two are just a short walk from the hotel.  Location is a key factor for The Westbury. Just try not to be too distracted by what is happening outside the hotel - for there is a lot to enjoy inside as well.  One final tip is to contact the hotel directly when making a reservation. we certainly got some good value which was not reflected in a quick browse of well-known internet hotel agents offers.",4,2010,12,03
203,Perfect romantic night away,What a fabulous experience!! We stayed one night...and it was so convenient. We parked the car and were able to explore Dublin by foot...being right on the edge of Grafton St. The staff were friendly and the room perfect for a romantic night away. There were even chocolates on the pillow with the turn-down service! Loved my night at The Westbury!,5,2010,12,02
203,One of our favorite hotels in the world.,"In terms of luxury, friendliness and location, the Westbury is tops in our book. We cannot rave enough. Large rooms and bathrooms; terrific breakfast buffet; beautiful common areas; easy access by foot to all Dublin attractions and shopping. Have stayed there several times and can't wait to return!",5,2010,11,29
203,"Great Hotel,good food and service.","During this business trip I took my wife and we both thought the hotel excelled oin all departments, particularly food and service. We must return for a leisure trip.

My only observation is they must sort the lift operational software, which does not follow any regularity whatsoever.",5,2010,11,28
203,My favourite has really let me down!,"I recently stayed in my most favourite hotel in the world (not exagerating) and boy was I really dissapointed. 

We checked in at half twelve on the Friday and was told that the room was not ready (no problem) and reception would phone me to let me know when it was ready. 3 hours later and no phone call, I headed back to the hotel and guess what...the room was ready???. Headed upstairs to the room and when we got in, the smell was disgusting, stale, fusty and like it hadn't been used in ages, but the last person to use it had been a chain smoker! 

Went downstairs for breakfast on Saturday morning and the guy serving the hot food (sausages,rashers etc) was most unhelpful. When I was trying to choose what I wanted he kept the lids closed on the hotplates and I could not see what was on offer, unless I asked him to show me, when I asked him for an extra sausage, he looked at me as if I was asking him for his money and then almost fired the sausage onto my plate.

Now I'm sure some of you are wondering why I didn't bring any of these problems to the staff, but in my book, when you are paying the prices that the Westbury charges (2 nights B&B + bar food 30 euro + parking 40 euro = 771euro) The hotel should get it right all the time, I don't believe in second chances at these prices. Myself and my wife stay in Dublin at least 5 times a year and every time we stay at the Westbury....not anymore I'm afraid. Our friends and family, upon hearing we were going to Dublin for the weekend, would always say, ""I suppose you're staying in the Westbury"" Well, I'll be showing my dissapointment with my wallet.....and staying somewhere else!",4,2010,11,28
203,Perfect overnight,We were with a group and had wonderful service and the location was just perfect. The personal attention to all of us was well received after a very long travel arreangements.,5,2010,11,17
203,"Perfect location, eleegant ,upto the minute chic.. wonderful service","This is a very classy hotel.. from check in to checkout a near perfect 2 days.. Nice room with free internet!!!..  Loved the idea of a complimentary light breakfast in the very quiet and comfortable lounge.. I don't need a huge breakfast and this simple idea made such good sense . I needed a 4.15 am wake up call and it was delivered in person by a waiter with a pot of coffee.. that's the sort of touch that makes this an outstanding hotel . I'd never go anywhere else in Dublin . This is place won me through sensible, customer friendly touches..",5,2010,11,16
203,"Fantastic hotel, location best in town","Loved my stay in Westbury, convenient not only to shopping but also walking distance to lovely restaurants and nightlife. Rooms lovely and service fantastic, works out great value",5,2010,11,16
203,I loved this hotel!,"I stayed 2 nights at this hotel and just loved it! The location could not be any better, being just right around the corner from Grafton Street. The hotel is beautiful, the service is great and the rooms are fantastic. They even turn down the bed at night and leave chocolates on the bed and provide fluffy slippers. It just does not get better than that! I felt thoroughly spoiled and that was a great feeling. I would definitely stay there again on my next business trip to Dublin.",5,2010,11,13
203,Fantastic family mini break in the heart of Dublin,"We stayed recently at the Westbury Hotel, just off Grafton St and had a fantastic experience. My wife and I were treating ourselves and our two daughters (ages 16 and 12) to a half term break. Right from the outset the staff were courteous and friendly, reception, concierge, dining room, everyone. The ability to walk straight out into the hustle and bustle of Grafton street, but also to find peace and quiet within the hotel itself was a winning combination. Our family room was perfect, and for the quality of accommodation I felt was good value for money. All the city sights were within reasonable distance. The restaurants in Temple Bar were only a few minutes walk away for a lovely evening meal as well. All in all, a perfect family treat!!",5,2010,11,11
203,Elegant Hotel in a great location,"Stayed here for 3 nights and thought public areas of the Hotel were very luxurious but rooms, while being nice, were a little disappointing. Loved the Nespresso machine and the crystal glasses in the bedroom and the lovely chocolates provided with the turn down service - also the warm towels on arrival at reception to check in were a nice touch. Gentleman serving in bar exteremely friendly and helpful but price of drinks very expensive although we did expect this in a 5 star hotel. We did not eat in the Hotel but did go for their complimentary breakfast on our last morning but were disappointed to find (like several other guests) that they had run out of croissants - this was at 9.15 and they were serving until 10.30!  It is very conveniently situated just off Grafton Street and if we go back to Dublin we will definitely stay here again.",4,2010,11,08
203,Travel Agent Review - Best hotel in Dublin by far!,"We stayed on 24th October for 2 nights. We arrived at 7.30am so I knew the room would not be ready, this was not a problem, we were told we could help ourselves to the complimentary continental breakfast in the lobby which we did, then we had a walk around the city. Our room was ready at 2, the hotel was full because of the Dublin Marathon and School Hols so we didnt expect to be able to get in any earlier.

I'd contacted the hotel before my trip as it was my fiance's 30th birthday on the 25th. Upon arrival they told me there was a free gift and what time would I ilke it bought to the room, I asked for it to come at 6pm, and dead on 6 there was a knock on the door and there was a chilled bottle of wine and a platter of luxury chocolate and strawberries! Special thanks to Sarah for your help before our trip and Joseph for your help on arrival sorting this. All the staff are wonderful, so helpful and nothing is too much trouble.

The room was amazing, we had a skyline suite on the 6th floor with a beautiful view of Grafton Street and beyond.  I read in a previous review that a guest was unable to find it. Were you in the wrong city?! The hotel is very easy to find, just off one of the most famous streets in Dublin! Bathroom was huge with a TV, 2 sinks and a massive mirror along one side of the bathroom. The bed was amazingly comfortable and huge. The nespresso coffee machine was fantastic and a nice change to the usual kettle and packet coffee you normally get in hotels, the coffee was divine!

Breakfast was lovely, a nice full breakfast on offer served to you, and fruit, cereal, all the continental offerings you'd expect. Fresh coffee or tea & toast served to your table by friendly faces each morning.

Unfortunately we were unable to experience the Wilde Restaurant at the hotel for an evening meal but heard this was fantastic. Its on our to do list for our next visit!

I've been to Dublin before so have experienced other hotels and this is by far the best hotel there and deserves the number 1 spot on this site!

All in all a fantastic luxury hotel in an enviable location , and a fantastic way to spend my fiance's 30th birthday. I am a manager of a travel agency and am very fussy, always do a lot of research before I travel, and I must say it definately paid off this time!",5,2010,11,02
203,Good Location,"We have mixed reviews of our stay at the Westbury.  Upon arriving at approx. 1.30pm we did not expecting to have our rooms ready, and they were not, although our luggage was looked after we were advised to come back at 3pm, we had already had quite a long tiring journey.  We had a wander through the streets of Dublin and returned back at the Westbury at 3.20pm to be told our rooms still were not ready.  We said we would sit and wait in the lounge area and that is what we did, without not even being offered a complimentary drink.  Obviously, eventually our rooms were ready.
When making our booking at the Westbury we asked for room and breakfast, so the next morning we approached the reception desk to ask where breakfast was being served and were told ""in the Wilde (after Oscar Wilde) restaurant"".  We had breakfast there for the next 2 mornings, only to find out that breakfast was actually not included (why didn't they tell us that when we made the booking) and if we wanted we could have croissants/toast and coffee in the hotel lounge.  And so had to pay a huge amount extra for just a bowl of cereal, fruit etc  and coffee.
We would'nt say that the hotel was exactly 5 star, it was clean and quite welcoming after a day about Dublin, but one of our party's room was on the second floor and on the saturday night it was so noisy from the function that was being held in the hotel's function suite.  We didn't know that the hotel had a gym it was just luck that I overheard someone talking about the gym; we would have liked to have gone for a swim but there was nothing to suggest the hotel had a pool, or even spa treatments.  Our hotel brochure didn't mention anything about relaxing, only about room service and restaurants.  It didn't even give times of when these were open.
There is a small bar in the hotel it is exceptionally expensive decorated very moodily and it could be very relaxing and quite except when we used it one evening two children were there with their families and were running riot throughout the bar area, jumping on the chairs and sofas, while their parents were oblivious to this.
One man sitting near to us was trying to read his book and he just stood up and said to us ""good luck - they'll probably be in here all evening"".  Makes you want to go out, doesn't it.
In our rooms there were no clocks, not one, we looked but nowhere could you look to find the time.  Everyone has mobbile phones, watches etc. but just sometimes it is nice to look at a clock or something that will tell you the time.
Every morning about 7 ish outside room 234 the maids trolley would arrive with a squeak - no lay-in for people in that room.  And on another occasion the evening turndown arrived about 6.15pm to find we were still in our room and we asked if she might give us another hour while we got ready;  she never came back to turn down our bed.
We found that the consierge desk gave us a map of Dublin city every time we asked a question and at our last count we have 8 maps between us of Dublin.  They did not know that the Dart railway was closed for engineering works over the weekend we wanted to travel to Howth, we informed them of that once we had walked back from the station (not very close to the hotel).
Our few days in Dublin were quite pleasant, the Westbury has an exellent location, it is part of a large chain of hotels but I am not sue what it lacks.  If we return to Dublin we would probably stay somewhere else.",4,2010,10,29
203,Could be fantastic if only...,"The best thing about the Westbury is the great location just off Grafton Street. 
The decor is lovely and is very light and airy and unfussy. The staff were very courteous and friendly, especially Paul, the concierge. The atmosphere is of relaxed elegance and is nicely unstuffy. It is, unfortunately, let down by the housekeeping. We were due to check in at 2, but had to wander the streets of Dublin until 4pm! The room was dusty, the toilet dirty and the coffee cups missing. The curtains were broken and didnt close properly. The room was not generally cleaned until very late on in the afternoon. We ordered a newspaper that didn't appear the next morning....then got two different ones the following one! Probably the worst thing was the lack of sleep due to the broken AC/heating unit in the wall under the window. Even when switched off the unit would click and buzz loudly on and off every 15 minutes or so, even at night. We did complain, but the manager could only transfer us to a room with one bed, which for a family of four wouldn't have worked! The hotel was fully booked and very busy with a wedding and a conference and the staff seemed very preoccupied. Eventually we figured out that covering the vent with one of the bedcovers muffled the noise. All in all we would stay here again because of the great location and relaxed atmosphere.....but bring earplugs just in case....",4,2010,10,27
203,The Best In Dublin so Close to all in Dublin one short walk away,"The Best In Dublin so Close to all in Dublin one short walk away.
What more can I Say. I Always stay when I return to Ireland take a seat outside and see Dublin Just Pass You.
The Staff are the best and as a regular at the hotel I Must say they Value me as much as I Value them.

203,Pure Luxury,"Amazing hotel, staff are well trained & helpful. Location can not be beat, is now the only place I will be staying in Dublin :)",5,2010,10,25
203,Disappointment,"After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor before booking a weekend break in Dublin, we were excited that the Westbury really would be something special.  Unfortunately we were disappointed in our stay here.  

The Westbury is definitely not a hotel for young people and we were made to feel quite uncomfortable as if we shouldn't have been staying at the hotel.  After returning from our meal we decided to check out the residents bar.  Although the few others in the bar were asked if they were staying at the hotel, we were the only people who were asked to produce our room card.  The gentleman working at the bar must have sensed our annoyance as he did come to speak with us and make small talk after we showed him our card but it just wasn't good enough to treat the youngest people in the bar like that.   

Along with this it was very hard to get a good nights sleep in the hotel.  I requested that our room would be on the upper floors so we wouldn't be too near the noise on the street below  - fair enough, nothing the hotel could control.  I was woken each morning by the cleaners talking loudly to each other outside the room whilst cleaning the other rooms.  The hotel is expensive to stay in and as this was a treat I was left disappointed that we didn't have a better stay.

Although the hotel reception, lobby and bar is very impressive the rooms did let the hotel down somewhat.  The rooms are quite small - especially the bathrooms. 

I sincerely doubt we will go back to the Westbury and if you are under 30 I would suggest you reconsider.",1,2010,10,25
203,Best Location and foyer in Dublin,"Second time staying in the Westbury. Stayed for one night in a standard room on the 5th floor. Comfortable bed, plenty of Aveeno toiletries, complimentary bottled water and great turn down service. Enjoyed the complimentary continental breakfast in the foyer next morning. The location is excellent, just steps from Grafton street and great shopping. Plenty of great bars and restaurants nearby. The Westbury foyer is great for afternoon tea and people watching. Great service and attention to detail. Will be back",5,2010,10,23
203,Very good,"Stayed four nights in a without view (253) room. Nothing to complain. Enouph space,very clean,nice buthroom, lot of toiletries. The view was not a problem because we were there only for sleep. It is very nice hotel with wonterfull public places. Breakfast was the better i ever had. Some tired personell was not a problem, it happens everytime. The great  avantage of the hotel is the location as hundrents of time mantioned by others reviewers. I think that is a great  proposition if you stay in dublin.",5,2010,10,17
203,A perfect place to wrap up a fabulous vacation,"After spending an amazing week in Barcelona, I had to alter my travel plans for returning to Boston due to a general strike throughout Spain.  I split my return trip into 2 legs and spent 24 hours in Dublin.  Having never been to Dublin before, I was a bit nervous about finding good accommodations last minute, just for myself.  I used my iPhone to search TripAdvisor for my options...this hotel was ranked very high and received great reviews, so I decided to book a room.  

I was thrilled to discover that the hotel is in an excellent location (very safe for a woman traveling solo and surrounded by a great selection of shops, restaurants, attractions), is very well appointed, has exceptional service, comfortable/clean/elegant rooms with every amenity that you desire (wonderful soaking tub, espresso machine, flatscreen TV, free WIFI, turndown service with delicious chocolate, perfect size and configuration of furniture, etc.).

The Concierge was very helpful re: recommendations for a quick tour of the area and a fabulous restaurant for dinner (Peploes...pricey but amazing!).

I will definitely return to The Westbury Hotel!",5,2010,10,13
203,best time ever,"We stayed at the Westsbury with my husband for a week and had the best time ever. The rooms are very comfortable, and have all the commoditties one could need while traveling either for leisure or business. The best what the attention we recieved the best treatment by part of the hotel staff, the concierge was able to orientate us on tours around the city and nearby locations, and the assistant manager was verry attentive to us from the beggining. We arrived early on sunday morning and as there was no room they offered us a small lounge to stay in, some courtesy food and beverages, we also got some help with reservations for our trip following the one from Ireland. 
We had the best time ever and would like to extend our special regards to Mr.Joseph Downign who made us feel at home.",5,2010,10,11

I was greeted with a hot towel which was nice, and even better they gave me my room straight away.  I nought for sure they'd make me wait, as many hotels do these days.  The concierge was very helpful, suggested great restaurants.  The room, was nice but frankly I love this hotel for its location.  Just off graft on street I walked everywhere.  Great shopping, great restaurants, great ""must see"" Dublin locations, including trinity college, national gallery, Dublin castle all within a fun few minutes away.  I can't imagine staying anyplace else in Dublin.",5,2010,10,02

I booked this hotel even though i live in dubiln because I am currently sole carer for my terminally ill mother and was having a night off to get some sleep. I wrote to the hotel to ask for a late check out as I could only  check in at eight at night. The hotel immediately agreed to 3 oclock check out and up graded me to a suite ( Thanks Sara). I had the best sleep ever and  had a lovely meal room service . everything was top notch. I can't reccomend this hotel enough and would love to go back next time i get a  night off.

When checking I asked the receptionist would it be possible to stay another night to which she replied ""No the hotel is fully booked"" without looking at me.

After dinner we returned to our room and came across the BEST turn down service ever,then when we went to breakfast,restaurant was lovely,very comfortable,breakfast was a feast,with so much choice and nothing greasy.
we had a drink in marble bar in evening time,and again pleasant surroundings,and lovely staff.
I would  HIGHLY recommend this hotel ,and would like to say a BIG THANK YOU,to all the staff who gave us a very memorable stay.",5,2010,09,26

Not only would I recommend it to my friends, I have told all my staff how good the Westbury is.",5,2010,09,22
203,Like the city of Dublin the Westbury is warm and welcoming.,"The Westbury is a lovely hotel, centrally located, within walking distance of shopping (Grafton Street,) pubs, restaurants and museums.  Comfortable and spotless. The hotel staff is so accommodating - willing to help visitors with their needs inside and outside of the hotel.  I did not want to leave.",5,2010,09,22
203,"Gorgeous hotel, great rooms, great service, perfect location","I loved this hotel and would stay here again if I returned to Dublin.  It is located a block off Grafton street so the location is great yet it is still quiet because it is set back off the main roads.  The hotel has great bars and restaurants if you want to grab a drink before heading out or at the end of the night.

The rooms were spacious, the beds were great and the bathrooms were nice.  The concierge was very helpful and every staff member I met was friendly.

Loved the location, you could walk to Grafton Street, Trinity College, Temple Bar area and any other attraction.  Close to great restaurants, pubs, cafes, shops, etc . . 

A tip if you have a rental car . . . Westbury is located off a small one way street, on one side is another one way street and the other side dead ends into Grafton which is a walking street with no access to cars.  Call the hotel first and find out how to get there because it is difficult to find by car.",5,2010,09,21

The Westbury is perfectly located in the heart of city center within easy walking distance to shopping, theater, museums and restaurants. As soon as you approach the hotel you are made to feel welcome by the doorman and it only gets better as you are cordially welcomed at the registration desk. The lobby lobby is spacious and beautifully decorated. Our room was spacious, immaculate and stunningly appointed. A complimentry sweets tray was waitng for us in our room when we returned. The concergie staff could not have been more pleasant or helpful. A complimentary continental breakfast is offered in the lobby but make sure not to miss the sit down breakast in the dinning room. A special thanks to Sarah Strahan for handeling our reservation so professionally. Can't say enough good things about this home away from home !",5,2010,09,20
203,fabulous hotel,"had a great time at hotel ,took the wilde package on one of the nights ,which in itself is a great deal,but im afraid to say the meal was a bit disapointing , the starter was cold,when we pointed this out,they took it away and i assume they made fresh ones,as we waited 40 -45 mins for it ,then when main meal came out it was 1 tiny piece of fish the meal in the brasserie [with 2 pieces of fish] was far superior.Having said all that and its only so as it can be addressed,we would not hessitate to come back ,staff were wonderful couldhave done with more info on morning brunch instead of going for breakfast,a slight mishap maybe",5,2010,09,18
203,Meet Our Expectations,"The Westbury was a great choice for a hotel to stay in Dublin.  Being just off Grafton Street puts it directly in the center of everything most tourists would want to see.  The hotel is extremely clean, the hotel staff knowledgeable and ever so pleasant.  The breakfast in the Wilde restaurant is very nice (get the window seat for a nice view) and for dinner, you're in easy walking distance for so many options.  I had a room facing the front entrance to the hotel which was a little noisy in the late evening due to the proximity of a pub or two although it wasn't unbearable with the air conditioner on.  Hats off to The Westbury.",5,2010,09,15
203,A First Class Experience,"We arrived at 10:30am and were welcomed immediately with hot hand towels to freshen up! We had 3 rooms reserved, and were able to check into one right away. We were also invited to coffee and tea as well as croissants available to hotel guests for free every morning.

The room was very well kept and well furnished, as was the bathroom, which even included a bidet. The toiletries available were all excellent. I happened to use the stairs often, and they were carpeted and well maintained. 

The hotel entrance is no more than a minute away from Grafton Street. It was extremely convenient to explore the street and all the immediate area.

We had breakfast there the last day of our stay, from the a la carte menu, and we were all pleased with all the items ordered.

The only thing you give up at this hotel is a street level lobby, but that at the main reception level was large and bright and very nice.

We would definitely return to this hotel in a future visit to Dublin.",5,2010,09,13
203,Loved everything about our stay,"We just returned from our trip to Ireland, and we stayed at the Westbury while in Dublin.  It was worth every penny- the hotel is beautiful in every way.  I continued taking photos of the lobby and the flowers they had on display because I was so in awe.  It is a six floor hotel, and as many have mentioned smack dab in the middle of everything.  We were able to walk to all of the big tourist sites- only needing a cab when we were dressed up and going across town for the night.  The concierge were great at directing us around town, and giving us personal recomendations.  When we went down to concierge on a Saturday night we were told it would be merely impossible to ""walk in"" a nice restuarant as we had planned.  We were dissapointed until the concierge spent about 15 minutes calling around to see who could get us in.  He finally did at a local italian place on St Stephens Green and it was one of my favorite meals of the trip.  Needless to say, I would recommend this hotel to a friend and would return if I ever returned to Dublin.  Thanks Westbury, you made our visit to Dublin a very enjoyable one!",5,2010,09,13
203,Beautiful hotel in center of everything-and when something went wrong they went out of their way to make it right.,"A customer reccommended we stay here and we were not disappointed- the hotel is smack in the middle of Grafton St. and an easy walk to the temple Bar area, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin Castle, etc.  The hotel is beautiful and very high end.  We had one problem while there and let's just say the management is fantastic and took care of us big time.  Highly recommend this place.",5,2010,09,11
203,Great Staff and Lovely Location,"I stayed 2 nights in this hotel, the staff over there made my day. The Asian girl work in there lounge, I believe her name was Amy, she is so creative and helpful, and great service and Szeko on reception, thank you both of you to make our stay great.",5,2010,09,10
203,Best location and rooms in Dublin!,"Amazing location just off Grafton Street, so always a good buzz around the hotel, though secluded enough to not to disturb a good night's sleep. Spacious and modern rooms, and their suites are outstanding! Great staff, good food and nice little touches in the room, from their bathroom products to afternoon treats! For a 5 Star hotel you wouldn't expect anything less. Can be great value unless you go for a Rugby weekend, in which case it's booked up months in advance and more expensive. Close to good nightlife and great restaurants too!",5,2010,09,02
203,"Perfect location, 5-star quality, excellent service!","When we arrived in Dublin and found our hotel, we could not believe we could walk right out the front door and be steps away from Grafton Street!  The location is aboslutely perfect, just a short walk to the Temple Bar area, literally located on Grafton street, lots of shops and restaurants near by, and close to hop-on/hop-off bus tour stops.  The price did not prepare us for how nice and luxurious the hotel was!  We were not expecting such fantastic accomodations, and the staff and service were were impeccable.  I cannot say enough great things about this hotel and would definitely stay again and recommend to others!",5,2010,09,01
203,"Very, very good hotel - first class service & facilities","Stayed at The Westbury for one night in August. It was absolutely brilliant - I 've stayed in a number of five star hotels around the world and can tell you that the Westbury is amongst the best I've stayed in. The location is fantastic, its 40 seconds from Grafton Street which is the High Street and centre of a lot of activity. Its also a 3 minute walk to the Tourist Info Centre and 2 minutes from the Airport Bus drop-off point. We arrived early (about 8.30am) and they were kind enough to let us check-in. I'd booked the room without breakfast but guess what...the hotel offers a simple continental breakfast for all guests every morning in the lobby - a very nice touch that made us feel special and that we'd made the right choice in staying here straight away. 
After a nice breakfast we went up and the room was lovely (please check my photos), it even had its own coffee machine. Both room and bathroom were spotless with everything you could need, I arrived without a razor - and requested one from the desk, they got it to me in 5 minutes flat. Everyone from the doorman to the Manager was warm, couteous and professional. I'd score them at 96%, if they had free wi-fi for in-house guests they'ed get 100% easy! Fabulous hotel - thank you The Westbury,Dublin.",5,2010,08,31
203,Best location in Dublin,"Must be the best location in Dublin. You are right in the heart of the city. It is only a few steps to Grafton Street for the shopping and only a few hundred yards to Temple Bar, Trinity College and the other tourist attractions. The hotel is modern and has well appointed rooms. Finding the hotel in a car can be tricky, but they do have an underground car park when eventually you are brave enough to drive down what look like pedestrian streets to get there.",5,2010,08,30
203,Outstanding Hotel in the heart of Dublin!!,"My husband and I stayed at the Westbury for three days prior to a cycle trip in Connamera and loved the location, ambience, helpfulness of the staff and the modern accomodations.  We were upgraded to a Junior Suite upon arrival, and found we received great value for our $$$.  Would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to experience a lovely elegant hotel close to shopping, restaurants and the heart of Dublin.",5,2010,08,29
203,An Excellent City Centre Choice,"This was our first trip to Dublin and chose The Westbury Hotel over the other 5* establishments in and around the city centre, this was also aided by the other reviews on TripAdvisor.

The hotel location is very good, your literally a short walk to Grafton St, St. Stephens Green and The Temple Bar, to name a few.

We booked a Superior Room, which was located on the 2nd floor at the back of the hotel, with no view to speak of. The room was very spacious and clean. The room briefly consists of two comfy armchairs, table, work station, plasma TV (which is amplified into the bathroom) and a separate wardrobe/dressing room. The heating and airconditioning is regulated manually. The maid service was very good and each night there was a bed turn down service with little chocolate treats. Our only minor complaint would be that there is no clock in the room.

The mini bar automatically registers with reception, so if you don't want to be charged......Don't Even Touch It !! We also found the drinks in the mini bar to be both expensive and not that cold either.

The hotel declares to have a gym, which is located on the 2nd floor. Now before you pack your mucle vest and leg warmers, it's very small. The size is decieved by all the mirrors.

Our breakfast was included in our room rate and unfortunately, it is over priced for what you receive as a cooked breakfast. The continental option which was also included had a very good selection. (Note: If you require baked beans, ask for them as they do not have them out on display)

We had a late lunch/evening meal in the Cafe Nova which is a really nice setting in an informal atmosphere.

The Concierge service was also of very good standard. We were given very good options, directions and local knowledge (from Dave) when choosing a restaurant for our evening meal. We opted for SABA (a Thai & Vietnamese establishment), which was quite conveniently located around the corner of the hotel. This proved to be an excellent choice, as the atmosphere was lively and informal with excellent food - It gets very busy, so be sure to book in advance !
To summarise, an excellent choice of 5* hotel with all the amenities you would expect from a city centre hotel. Oops sorry....they need to invest in Spa facilities :-)",5,2010,08,28
203,NIGHTMARE TO FIND,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights in a Superior Room (Queen bed) with breakfast and supposedly parking included.

 Firstly it was a nightmare to find this hotel but with the streets in Ireland I think any hotel may be hard to fiind even with GPS. However with this hotel the entrance is not in Grafton Street which is confusing.  You need to go down Clarendon Street and take two left hand turns and you find it in Harry Street.  Leave the car in the street outside the hotel and get the porter to unpack you bags and drive to the car park.

After driving round and round for over half an hour we gave up and rang the hotel and got the directions above, even then it was not easy to find.

Its a nice hotel in a central location with friendly staff. The room was modern and they were very clean, Nespresso machine and wonderful chocolates at turn down. Flat Screen TV.,good hairdryer in room and also Iron.  Very poor water pressure in handbasin taps. There is a good dry cleaning and laundry service just around the corner from the hotel, which is considerably cheaper than using the hotel one. (Just turn right at hotel and at end of street turn right again into South Williams street, they charge you about 20Euros for about 3 kilos of washing.
Free Internet in business centre.

We had dinner in Wilde Restaurant - very  nice meal and excellent service from John Paul, but two of the other waiters were not as good, one got the wine we ordered mixed up (how could you bring a red when we ordered white?) and another forgot our order and had to come back. Also had drinks in  Marble Bar , nice atmosphere and good cocktails also some complimentary nibbles.

Breakfast on both mornings was buffet style and very pleasant, good quality and hot food.  Try and get the table near the window overlooking Grafton Street,

Only negative other than the poor water pressure which we advised them about, was that we had checked out of the hotel and then could not get the car out of the car park as we had not paid for parking. We were not aware parking was not included.  So had to go back in (after previously checking out and paying the bill) and get the parking bill at 20 euros per day.
This left a nasty taste in our mouth and we told the hotel why was this not mentioned when we checked in or even when we checked out  and paid our final bill - no answer to this. 

Would we stay at this hotel again if back in Dublin? Possibly  its in the best location in Grafton Street within easy walking distance of all shops and attractions, but we might also try The Fitzwilliam.",4,2010,08,26
203,Overall a good experience,"We live in Dublin but occasionly we like to stay in city centre hotels. We normally stay in The Shelbourne but decided on a change this time and opted for the Westbury. We have had drinks, coffee and lunch here before so knew the hotel fairly well. The public areas are lovely, really comfortable with welcoming staff.

We booked a package option which included bed, breakfast, dinner with wine and a cocktail. When we checked in we thought we would be told how this worked, i.e. shown where the restaurant was, given vouchers, told times for breakfast etc  but the receptionist didn't explain anything. We had to ring reception after when we realised we didn't have any of this information. She told us she had upgraded our room but when we got to the room it stank of smoke but we didn't like to complain as they were kind enough to upgrade us.

The dinner and breakfast were both excellent and the service at both meals was excellent too.",4,2010,08,25
203,What a location for a wedding!!!,"I am just back from spending a night at the Westbury. I was at a friends wedding (being held in the Westbury). The Location of the hotel is amazing it is just off Grafton Street &  Bruxelles Pub & McDaid's pubs are just outside the foyer.
The hotel offers valet parking which given the location is great. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful, there are chandeliers everywhere & fabulous paintings on the walls, there is a grand piano when you go up the stairs to reception. The food served at the wedding was magnificent & the staff were 1st class. If the food for nearly 250 people can be that perfect; I can only imagine what dinner for 2 would be like, the chefs are clearly extremely talented.
The room the wedding reception was held in was beautiful. We stayed in room 212 ( a standard room). It had a really comfy bed, wide screen tv, complimentary ""Nespresso"" coffee machine, the sugar for the coffee is actual pure cane sugar in blocks!!!. When we arrived to the room that evening, the bed had been turned town with chocolates left on our pillows, slippers left on each side of the bed & complimentary bottled water was left on each locker.
When leaving this morning, the manager made us feel really at home, He was an extremely charming guy. As 5* hotels go, this is a gem! I has all of the amenities you could wish for, without a stuffy atmosphere.",5,2010,08,22
203,"Elegant, classic hotel in a great location","I stayed in the Westbury whilst on business in Dublin. The hotel is located in a side street off Grafton St which means its ideally placed for visitors to see the sights. Its also close to many major coporate headquarters, so good for business visitors. 

Check in was quick and efficient, and an initial inspection of the room showed no immediate issues. The room itself was of a good size, with a nice view over the city. All the facilities were in good working order - the provision of a coffee machine in the room is a great idea! 

Staff were friendly and helpful - one of the light bulbs in my room went and the desk sent a maintenance man up within 5 minutes with a replacement bulb. I didn't try the food, but colleagues have said that it was good - if a bit expensive. 

Overall, it was an impressive hotel - worthy of its 5* status.",5,2010,08,19
203,Amazing stay!,"Beautiful hotel, stayed in fab suite, staff very friendly.  One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in.",5,2010,08,17
203,"Opulent, clean but if there's a hen party in town be prepared to be asked to moved on!","Cant fault the style, opulence and cleanliness of the staff and the afternoon tea was to die for.

The rooms a beautifully decorated with a Nespresso Machine for coffee and Aqua di Parma toiletries in the bathroom.

Location was super central to all the shops and some nice bars and restaurants near by.

We had a cocktail in one of the bars on the Saturday night and were approached by a non-resident to move so they could have the large sofa we were sat on. The Bar Manager whilst apologetic, did ask us to move with free drinks as an incentive. When we complained to the Management, they said the free drinks were an apology and that he didnt ask us to move! Whatever helps you sleep at night!!!!!",4,2010,08,15
203,Centre in town (nice location) but noisy.,"This place is very plush! Very plush. Nice and in the centre of town. Outside a taxi rank but many pubs. This is the down fall. With work, you need to sleep, so with music banging loudly and out of the control of the hotel, you are stuck.

The hotel has tried to add down windows to block sound, but this does not work. So be aware, if you are here for business purposes and have to wake up at 7am for meetings and conferences, you have been warned.

Back to the hotel, I received a nice a big room. None standard room but the expensive - business room. Big 4 post bed, 42 inch plasma tv, two single sofas and table. Desk with free internet. A bathroom which was ok. My colleague received a big bathroom with tv! Yep. So jealous.

Anyway, staff are ok but don't feel welcoming. They need to act on this fast.

Morning breakfast is self service but you have to wait for a seat. The room is very small and you have to wait sometimes more than 10 minutes. So ask for room service next time if you are in a rush.

Food is normal and nothing special. 

So overall, as the company paid for this, I did'nt care much but I need my sleep. Alot of sleep. So if someone is playing karaoke or banging some dance music which is loud! It is not on! So drink alot of alcohol to go to sleep! or book elsewhere.

After finding out the company paid 250euro's a night, I don't think this will be on my list next time.",3,2010,08,13
203,Sheer class !,"Stayed here for 2 days for work and a bit Dublin nightlife in between.
Thought the whole experience was wonderful. Great location, switched on staff, Very comfortable room (just a little on the small side) , beautiful bar and restaurant and within walking distance of all the main nightlife in Dublin centre.
I would recommend this hotel for whatever reason you are visiting Dublin. Hard to fault it.",5,2010,08,13
203,Wonderful hotel and great location,We stayed here with our 2 daughters (13 and 11) as part of a city break long weekend.  The hotel is fabulous with quality fixtures and fittings and superb service.  We stayed in a room with 2 queen beds which still had plenty of space for armchairs and desk etc and didn't feel cramped.  Location is great - right on Grafton St and an easy stroll to the city centre. Highly recommended.,5,2010,08,09
203,fab hotel!,"stayed at Westbury Hotel at the end of July 2010. went with friends for a short break and for the blokes to see Iron Maiden. From start to finish the hotel staff were friendly, attentive and bent over backwards to answer question and offer advice. the hotel was right in the centre of town, really handy for great food, pubs and touristy bits and bobs. the hotel was lovely and clean. the housekeeping staff do a great job.
would definatley go again ... tomorrow",5,2010,08,05
203,"Nice hotel, great location","We had a nice stay at the hotel. Our room was a standard double, which was spacious and nice, and had several useful amenities (large flatscreen tv, Nespresso coffee machine, direct access to a quite large selection of in-room movies and airconditioning). The bed was very comfortable. We ordered in-room breakfast one morning, which we can highly recommend. 

The reception staff was very friendly and helpful. 

A few (minor) faults: The Nespresso machine had not been made ready when we arrived, and the in-room breakfast menu was not available at our room. 

The second morning we tried the complimentary breakfast in the reception area. The croissants and orange juice were delicious. They were clearly understaffed, however. We had to wait 15-20 minutes for glasses and about ten minutes for the croissants. 

But all in all we recommend the hotel, mainly because of the quality of the rooms and location of the hotel.",4,2010,08,03
203,Luxury and Location,"We stayed here in May for a short break in Dublin and after looking for something nice, have a good location at an affordable price we came across The Westbury Hotel. We decided to go ahead and book it as the reviews were all very positive and it matched our requirements and it did not dissappoint. The location was great, the customer service that we had recieved was especially good given that we had some additional requirements. If we come back to Dublin we will have no hesitation in staying here again.",5,2010,08,03
203,"Phenomenal staff, situated in a perfect location","We initially booked at the Westbury due mainly to the hotel‚Äôs convenient location.  After a one week stay there it is obvious what the real attraction is.  The property itself is beautiful and well maintained down to the smallest detail but the greatest asset this property has is the staff.  Every member of the staff we encountered was courteous and most helpful with any request we made.  Rooms are comfortably appointed and the beds are easily the most comfortable I have ever slept in.  When what I considered to be a minor issue arose the staff immediately took care of it, then sent the most wonderful chocolates to the room to make up for it.  The Westbury will be in our plans the next time we visit Dublin.",5,2010,08,03
203,Perfect location,"We loved everything about the Westbury Hotel!  We just returned from Ireland and Scotland celebrating our wedding anniversary.  The location is just a few steps off Grafton Street (the shopping street).  Easy walking to Trinity and many other sights.  It has a beautiful lobby with crystal chandeliers and a wonderfully helpful staff.  Everything we read about it on Trip Advisor was true and more. We appreciate that they gave us a room looking out front onto Grafton Street.  There was no street noise.  The baths have black granite counters and floors and were spotless.  The beds were so comfortable that we felt at home.  It was a lovely surprise that they serve a complimentary continental breakfast with freshly baked croissants, jams, orange juice, coffee or tea to get your sightseeing day off to a good start.  It was our favorite hotel on this trip to Europe. Everything a five star hotel should be!",5,2010,07,30
203,I didn't want to go home,"My husband and I were celebrating our 25th Wedding Anniversary with 10 other family members, most on their first trip to Dublin. I had read the reviews on tripadviser on the Westbury ,so had no hesitation in booking on behalf of the family.We arrived at the hotel around 10am, too early to access the roooms, but were given hot towels to freshen up,allowed to check in and leave the cases.The hotel is in the best location, really handy for the wonderful shopping on Grafton St, close to the bus stops for the hop on hop off bus tours, theatres and restaurants. The hotel even had it's own wee shopping mall!
We returned a couple of hours later to find the rooms ready. The rooms were very comfortable, tastefully decorated and were lucky enough to be given front facing rooms.The rooms had very comfortable beds,(the pillows were amazing)large wall mounted Plasma tv, which I think was piped into the bathroom, Krups coffee machine (which I couldn't figure out how to work), lovely crystal glasses,Aqua Di Parma products on the bathroom, all very nice touches! In the evening a member of staff visited the room with complimentary cupcakes and a letter from the management wishing us an enjoyable stay.I though this was because it was our anniversary, turns out the whole party received the same.When we returned to our room for the evening the beds were turned down,chocolates and Doyle Collection slippers at the bedside( the concierge informed me we couldn't go home without them!).
The staff were very great, especially the concierge who never tired of our questions regarding the hotel and local amenities.The assistant manager has even promised to email the supplier of those amazing pillows.If he doesn't I'll just have to return to the Westbury to get another wonderful nights sleep!!
Why isn't the Westbury Hotel number one on tripadviser??",5,2010,07,27
203,Number One Choice for Our Family in Dublin,"We were traveling on a private tour of Ireland again...this time with 9 people! We had scheduled two nights in Dublin at the beginning of our trip and one night in Dublin before heading to London for several days. We chose The Westbury because of our excellent stay there in 2008. We were not disappointed on our return visit!
Immaculate in every way, from rooms to public areas. Excellent staff, always with a smile and a greeting while taking care of anything asked of them. Bellman Paul took care of five rooms worth of luggage quickly and efficiently both on arrival and departure. Front desk staff was very kind and gracious on our one night end of tour stay when we arrived and found no reservation on their books. They quickly began the process of finding 5 rooms for us and served our group light tea and sandwiches while they worked on our reservation. We could not have higher praise for the way they handled our mixup! Our travelers (ages 22 to 81) all love the location on Grafton Street. The younger people took off shopping and sightseeing and the older folks retired to those superb beds for a little nap. 
We took full advantage of the Cafe Novo, too. Dinner was arranged for our group of 9 and we had a wonderful evening listening to music before we adjourned to the outside sidewalk tables to enjoy the sights and sounds of Grafton Street in comfort.
We all highly recommend The Westbury and intend to return again next time we visit Dublin.",5,2010,07,26
203,Stunning,"For us, this hotel just gets better and better every trip!

I don't know what we did but we were upgraded to the Presidential Suite! What a treat. We've stayed at The Merrion, The Morrison, Fitzwilliam & Westin but the Westbury is head and shoulders above.

I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2010,07,26
203,"Great location, enjoyable stay","I stayed at the Westbury for about a week and enjoyed the hotel very much. The location is terrific, just steps to many wonderful restaurants and shops. The hotel breakfasts are quite pricey so skip those and head out to some nearby cafes. The service at the hotel was one of the most appealing aspects of my hotel. The staff were always gracious, friendly and helpful. The rooms are fine, perhaps not highly luxury but comfortable and well cleaned. The bathrooms on the other hand were handsomely apppointed and featured lovely bath products.",4,2010,07,24
203,Ticks all the boxes!,"Great (1 night) experience in Westbury.  The lounge/bar area is what totally makes this hotel, we sat up until 2.30am enjoying our night, very relaxing.  We had window seats looking out on the nightlife of Dublin - enjoying the spectacle whilst being sheltered from all the madness outside!  The staff were lovely - the lounge\bar staff in particular - run off their feet but very professional and friendly - faultless.  Our room was small (but hey this is city centre like Hong Kong so not a lot of space to go round) - the room was absolutely gorgeous - spotless and very luxurious.  We were facing out front which was nice as well rather than back onto a backstreet.  We had parked and on checkout they agreed to validate our parking ticket AFTER we had finished in the city - we didn't have to remove the car at 12 noon.  Its that kind of thing that makes the difference.  It didn't matter to them but it did to us.  Full marks for this small but very thoughtful act.  Loved our stay in the Westbury - highly recommended for location (off Grafton St) great for nice pubs in the locality and restaurants.  Its a nice part of town - classier than Temple Bar.  Top marks Westbury - well done!",5,2010,07,23
203,excellant hotel,"beautiful hotel, love ly staff, immaculate hotel who could not do enough for your enjoyable stay!  In a very good position in Dublin, five minutes walk from where the airport bus drops you.  And very close to shops etc,  clean fresh towels stayed in five star hotels previously this by far is the best one.   If in Dublin again I would definatly choose this hotel, bed was turned down at night with slippers and robes and chocolates on pillow,  Meals in hotel are quite expensive but excellant quality,  however Dublin is expensive so it is in par with the hotel being five star.",5,2010,07,23
203,Beautiful hotel - perfect location,From hotel towels at check-in to turn down service at bedtime this property cannot be faulted. The rooms are large and beautifully decorated following their refurb. The reception and lounge area were all abuzz with people having afternoon tea or a little afternooon glass of bubbles. The service was efficient but always friendly with directions effortlessly provided to where we had to be that evening for a party. There was huge choice at breakfast and check-out took mere seconds. Not to take away from the hotel itself or the staff but what this hotel really has going for it is its sheer location....moments off Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green. Will definitely return.,5,2010,07,22
203,A Hidden Gem,"What an excellent hotel.  This hotel is hidden away in the heart of Dublins hustle and bustle, an excellent location to all the sights and sounds that Dublin has to offer.  The hotel itself whilst a bit dreary from the outside is extremely well presented the main reception and lounge area are quite beautiful with stunning fittings and flowers.  The Marble bar whilst pricey lives up to the standards you would expect from a five star hotle.  The rooms are also well presented.  All in all a great hotel.  Dublin however hmm take lots of cash... a lot dirtier than expected",5,2010,07,21
203,the best in Dublin,"I stayed at the west burry for over than 2 weeks and because I traveled solo and in business I spent most of my time in my room and I enjoyed every second.

Location, services, staff and furniture are excellent‚Ä¶ huge bathrooms with built-in LCD TV on it :)

All you need and expect in a 5 star hotel",5,2010,07,21
203,OK But,"Nice Hotel I've stayed here many times and have always been very happy with the service but this time a few things that annoyed me.
1. Air Conditioning. It packed up working on the second day in fact it heated the room to 26C. Informed front desk of the problem only to return five hours later to find nothing had been done and the room still sweltering.
To be fair after informing the front desk for the second time of the problem they sent a very helpful girl to fix it, she told me the control pad was faulty  and that she would inform the duty manager who would be in touch.
I checked out the following morning  paid my account in full  was never asked if my stay was pleasant or otherwise and am still waiting to hear from the manager.",4,2010,07,21
203,Excellent in all regards - a great hotel in a great city,"I stayed here with my 15 year old daughter for 4 nights. It was wonderful. An amazingly well appointed hotel with all the service qualities you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The front desk staff were very professional and polite and helpful. The location is amazing - definitely the nicer side of the River Liffey in all respects, and very convenient for me alone with my daughter. Great shops and cafes are on the hotel's doorstep (we didn't have breakfast in the hotel, but they do offer free tea/coffee, croissants to all guests every morning, which was a bonus although we didn't land up having any). The room was beautiful - extremely comfortable beds (doona/duvets) and who can fault  the 'turn down' service and the great flat screen TV and free internet!? A great experience all round.",5,2010,07,21
203,THE ONLY HOTEL TO STAY IN WHEN IN DUBLIN,"The Westbury is top class, from location to parking facilities, hotel services and staff.",5,2010,07,21
203,"Well located, clean, classy hotel - recommended for exploring Dublin","Stayed here for 3 nights with my husband in June 2010 - hotel is well located, just off Grafton Street (which is brilliant for shopping). Lots of places to eat in the streets surrounding the hotel. Hotel is rather large, and therefore a little un-personal, but all of the staff were always willing to help with any queries we had. Overall we were very happy with the hotel and would definately recommend to anyone wanting to relax in or explore Dublin.",4,2010,07,19
203,Hard to think of anything that could be better,"This could be one of the finest hotels I have ever stayed at anywhere. Location is spectacular, just steps from Grafton St and 4 blocks from Trinity College. Also about a 10 minute walk from Temple Bar area. Rooms were luxurious and had every amenity you could imagine or want. Staff was accommodating, bathrooms were very modern and well appointed. Free continental breakfast in the lobby was more than adequate to get us on our way. My only regret is that we were not able to spend more time there. We did not eat in the hotel restaurants so cant comment on that but this is truly a hotel which pampers you. I give it my highest recommendation.",5,2010,07,18
203,"Excellent Hotel, Location with U.S. size rooms in E.U.","Stayed at the Westbury in July 2009 for both work (colleagues) and pleasure (wife).  Location is perfect, steps from shopping and restaurants on Grafton St.  Walk out of the hotel and you are literally in McDaid's Pub (Dublin Classic Bar).
If your into the nightlife scene, you can walk out of the hotel, left on Grafton, and down to Temple Bar area.  The walk (5-8 min) to Temple bar is what would be called and far STAGGERING distance.  OR make a right on Grafton from the hotel and your 2 min. from St. Stephen's Green for a nice walk in the park.
The only small disappointment is the gym (then again in EU, having just a room with 2 pieces of equip is a plus)...but then again, your in Ireland.  Take a walk, have a Guinness, and skip the gym for a week.  It'll be worth it.",5,2010,07,15
203,Such a Let Down from our Last Stay,"We arrived early and was told our room was not ready so we decided to do some shopping on Grafton Street. The concierge stored our cases for us whilst we went. We came back at 3.00pm and our room was ready, as we got to it the door was open with a maid refilling the coffee machine.

The Executive room had two double beds a walk in closet and an Average size bathroom. The beds were well presented and comfortable as where the pillows. The room had a large 37 inch television. We were located on the second floor.

Included in the rate was dinner at the Wilde. On arrival to the restaurant we where shown to our table by a Lady who was completely full of herself. On sitting down we asked which menu would be inclusive after she had told us she rudely said ""Why dont you try downstairs it might be more informal"". I was shocked and stunned to reply not giving in to her rude remarks we stayed. The meal itself and the other staff members where fantastic.  The restaurant was empty with only 5 people including our selves in.

Breakfast at the hotel was a Huge let down cold bacon Luke warm tea. The selection was poor the plates where cold I couldn't believe this was a 5 star. We stayed at the Conrad a couple of nights before and the Breakfast and Service was Amazing,

When attempting to order a Pot of Tea from Room Service we where told that would be fine until a call came back later from the same Rude Woman in the restaurant she said ""couldn't you use the tea making equipment in the room"". Now whose decision is it if I want a Pot Of Tea ,UHT milk is not for me. 

We stayed here last July which was our first time it left a good impression but after returning it was Awful and we will never go back to the Westbury Again. There seems to be a staff shortage. If you want an excellent all round 5 Star go to the Conrad.",2,2010,07,15
203,"perfect location,highest standard of service from lovely staff","60th birthday treat, beautiful hotel & perfect location for shopping,strolling and access
to points of interest in Dublin city.2 mins walk from Gaiety theatre,restaurants etc.
very comfortable beds! Couldn't fault anything really, would book again without hesitation,
Thankyou !",5,2010,07,15
203,"Lovely hotel, fab location!","Just back from a long weekend at the Westbury and just loved it!  We'd been lucky enough to have our room upgraded ( thanks Russell! ).  Our suite was v clean and plush, as was the rest of the hotel.  Loved the Nespresso machine and the cupcakes!

Enjoyed the leisurely breakfast in the Wilde restaurant, all the staff v attentive, as they were in the bar.  Had a lovely dinner one night in Cafe Novo downstairs.

  We really enjoyed ourselves over the weekend, and found the hotel and its great location just perfect. We'll definately return, and would happily recommend.",5,2010,07,13
203,Marvelous Hotel,"Our stay at this Hotel was marvelous from check-in through check-out.    Comfortable, attractive upscale rooms with excellent mattress, pillows and bedding.    Krups Norpress coffee maker in room, Acqua de Parma toiletries and large, plush towels.   Has everything you could possibly want in a good Hotel.   The staff was friendly and very helpful, I had just had surgery and had to sleep sitting up in a chair.    The Manager on duty, Joseph, went out of his way to find me a comfortable, soft easy chair and had it put into our room, it was the first time I slept well in 11 nights (and all the hotels we stayed in previously were 4+ and 5 stars).   In addition to everything else, there could not possibly be a Hotel in Dublin with a better location, steps from Grafton Street and probably the most centrally located fine Hotel in Dublin.   Look no further, this is a wonderful place to stay and I think it fair to say that I tend to be very picky and hard to please.",5,2010,07,13
203,Good let down by details,"Overall a nice hotel in a great location. Stayed only one night as we were passing through Dublin.
Bit surprised (and disappointed) that on arrival there were no door man present. I parked on the double yellow lines outside and unloaded the car - we then carried our luggage into the hotel and up the stairs to reception (unusual, and makes the lack of a doorman all the more strange). Still no offer of help. 
Room wasn't ready (it was 3:30pm) but we were offered coffee - delay wasn't too long so I didn‚Äôt mind too much. While waiting I parked my own car (car park is down a side street) :there was no way back to the hotel lobby via the lift (as these were operated by a room key - I still hadn‚Äôt been issued with one). Given I was paying ¬£20 per night for parking, someone could have mentioned it.
Room was very nice (we'd upgraded to a deluxe) but I had to report to the reception that the toilet hadn‚Äôt been properly cleaned. I was perfectly friendly about, as were they, but no apology.
Food was nice - especially breakfast.
This is undoubtedly a good hotel but the service isnt quite there: Irish staff seem unsure as to be friendly or formal, the foreign staff seem a little too busy trying to translate what you are saying to worry about being friendly.
Overall it was a pleasant stay in a good hotel - but its let down by the lack of attention to service.",4,2010,07,13
203,Excellent Hotel,If you are going to Dubin this is the Hotel to stay at!,5,2010,07,08
203,Stay here for the location,"I was extremely happy with the location of this hotel. It is just off Grafton Street (not directly on it; I almost walked right by the street because I was looking for the hotel on Grafton). It is on a side street that faces Grafton. Regardless, it was an awesome location. Lots of shopping right up the street and lots of restaurants too. Short walk to Temple Bar area. 

We had a sixth floor room, which I wouldn't recommend because the elevator is the slowest elevator in existence. Had a room facing the back of the hotel, which was really not attractive; the carpet was also stained. Like the last reviewer, I went to the reception area to try to change rooms. Since I was staying for several days, I didn't really want to stay there and pay that much money. The reception woman said there were no rooms that looked out the front of the hotel and that no other room would look better. She said it would be quieter looking out the back. I think she was right about that at least. 

There were free pastries and juice for breakfast in the lobby area which was a nice surprise. The beds were comfortable.

The most annoying thing there was that anytime we turned on the faucet or flushed the toilet, there was a horrible noise that sounded like a train coming through. My husband said he thought it was because the water pressure was poor on the sixth floor.

Overall, the hotel itself was just average, but the location made it worth the stay.",4,2010,07,07
203,"Wonderful experience, great for adults and children","We spent an amazing long weekend in Dublin and The Westbury Hotel was a perfect spot to explore the city.  The room was first rate, and the staff made us feel like at home.  My kids were constantly asking the front desk for information and advice, and everyone...especially the concierge -- was gracious and helpful.  Their suggestions were fantastic.  The morning breakfast was a highlight and put us in the right frame of mind for a full day of Dublin.  Hope to return soon.",5,2010,07,07
203,Great stay.,"Sayed over Easter with kids and both Grannies.  Great rooms (eventually) and a lovely stay.  But....when we first checked in we were given possibly the worst rooms in the hotel - right on top of the extractor fans from the restaurant - very noisy and smelly.  I complained and was moved, but considering I was taking 4 rooms for 4 nights and dropping a couple of grand, they shoudl have looked after me better from the start. I hate having to go down to reception and ask to be moved.",4,2010,07,06
203,OUTSTANDING,"This hotel as everyone knows his the hotel tostay at if you get a good rate which I did and the staff was outstanding. Joseph did my boarding passes for me I was haveing a differcult time. He took it one step further at check out , he ran to the St Teresa Church outside the hotel at 7am to see if the gift shop was open now I would say the was above and beyond the rooms were wonderful,",5,2010,07,06
203,very very good,"just back from a night in The Westbury Hotel. We normally stay in the Shelbourne when we spend a night in dublin, but last time we felt the Shelbourne did not live up to its 5 stars.
We were delighted with our choice of The Westbury. The location is fantastic, that speaks for itself, but from the moment we arrived to the time we left, we got the 5 star treatment. Check in was a breeze, with lovely hot towels on arrival, our car was parked by a very polite gentleman and our bags taken promptly.We opted for the Stay Wilde Package, really good value( see web site) you get a standard room which is very nice and has all the extras, but the bathroom was a little on the small side, however it had everything, and I loved the Aqua de Parma toiletries supplied.The assistant manager on duty on The Saturday night went out of his way to accomadate our 8yr old with a television to watch the football, as children are not allowed in the bar after 6 30pm, we didnt take him up on his offer, but really felt he went the extra mile to make us feel special.Thank you.All in all an excellent hotel, very comfortable with lovely staff I think we will be back.",5,2010,07,05
203,Wo,"You know a place is special when it is more comfortable than home. No expense is spared, obviously, and having a night cap from crystal or a Nespresso coffee testifies to it. I can't imagine a more posh and central place to stay in Dublin: we could drop the shopping bags and freshen up before going out for the night. This has to be The Place to stay and I would go there again tomorrow!",5,2010,07,02
203,Wonderful Hotel- Well Located and Great Staff,"We stayed for a week at the Westbury during May 2010.

It is a fantastic hotel, well located near everything you could want in city center and easy access to all the various business and tourist needs.

The staff were incredible from start to finish. As somoene who stays in hotels more than 200 nights per year it takes a lot for me to enjoy a hotel, I enjoyed our stat at The Westbury!

Concierge's were helpful with difficult requests and did not push the ""traditional tourist items"", they took the time to learn what we wanted and heled us every step of the way.

We were there during some of the Ashcloud airport closures and without asking the hotel made sure that we were updated on what was happening and told us not to worry if we could not get out. 

They anticipated our needs and for that we are thankful.",5,2010,07,01
203,Excellent Hotel - 5 STARS!,"This hotel more than earns its 5 stars from the moment you check until you leave.  We were so impressed with this hotel that we had planned on staying in different accommodation on our return trip to Dublin only  to switch our plans to stay at the Westbury again.  Excellent hotel, staff, rooms, bed,  location, service ... 5 STARS!",5,2010,07,01
203,relaxation itself,"just back from 2great days in Dublin made all the better by staying in the Westbury,got a great deal with Discover Ireland offers.Receptionist was so lovely,Anne,and upgraded us too.think it was my daughters beautiful smile!! Had meal in the Wilde restaurant in the hotel,it was fab the only thing i could fault was a grumpy waiter at the start of the meal but he dissappeared and was replaced by a jovial sort.
Rooms have everything and there was no charge for having the breakfast brought to our room (a nice change)
only thing i did notice,on the down side,was on our second day a family arrived in next room with 2 or more children and i could hear everything through the wall.but it was ok they went to bed early etc...And maybe a spa in the hotel would be a bonus but these are only little things,i just cant wait to go back",5,2010,06,24
203,Great location and a lovely place to stay,Stayed at The Westbury once more for a weekend break in Dublin. This is the best located hotel in Dublin. Rooms have been modernised in the last year. Great hotel and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend it.,5,2010,06,21
203,For location - unbeatable - for value - questionable...,"If you want to be right on Grafton Street but still get a good nights sleep - Westbury is probably unbeatable.

Due to work I travel all around the world and I can't say I was remotely 'wow'ed' by the Westbury - the decor in the room was dated, the food was extortionate and by no means worthy of the Hotel's 5* status in my opinion.  I think I paid just short of 20 euros for a coffee and a sandwich and left most of it before heading down the road to a diner to pay 10 euros for a nice brunch.
The staff were efficient but not warm - and were reminiscent of those I deal with when travelling through business and huge corporate hotel chains.  Again - lacking that certain je ne sais quoi you would hope for when paying such a lot of money.

By no means is this a negative report - it just isn't a positive one - which I thought I would be writing... If you are travelling business, or location is your only real objective - go for it - if you are looking for somewhere with a bit of celtic charm, or for that matter any charm for your stay - possibly look further afield...

Laterooms provided me with a fairly good deal (¬£530 for 3 nights) - I would not have been impressed had I have paid rac rate.  At all.",3,2010,06,21
203,A terrific,"We have stayed in some of the No1 hotels according to Tripadvisor, Barcelona, Prague, now No 2 and quite honestly say that the Westbury bets them hands down on all scores.
We were celebrating my Husbands birthday and retirement and the Service was second to none.
We were upgraded to a Junior Suite which was amazing, with a four poster bed and treats such as Half a bottle of wine, fruit platter, a television in the Bathroom, a letter from the General Manager and a Birthday Card from the Staff and Management. The view from the sixth floor looked over the rooftops of Dublin.
The room and public areas are immaculate and the staff all very friendly.
On the Birthday I had ordered a double malt to be sent to the room and as I had ordered it some months previous I was delighted that it arrived bang on time.
We were given recommendations for Dinner as the Wilde Restaurant is closed on Sun & Mon which was a shame.
We arrived back late one evening and ordered a sandwich which arrived promptly, very tasty and a good price.
We discovered a few excellent bars, the oldest in Dublin with live music in the afternoon, the oldest Victorian pub which was very quaint and O'Neill's an amazing warren of different bars on different floors and had a carvery serving well after 11pm.
One minor point, the hop on off bus states that the ticket is valid for 24hrs, well as the 1st bus is 9am and the last 6.30pm then the maximum time you get is actual 9.30hrs in any combination of hours.
We had an amazing stay and met some great locals and would thoroughly recommend the Westbury as the only place to stay in Dublin.
Thank you to the Staff and Management for making the stay a memorable celebration",5,2010,06,17
203,"Brilliant central location, friendly staff and lovely room","I have stayed at this hotel on a number of occasions and found the quality of the rooms and friendliness of the staff wonderful. The Westbury is situated just off Grafton Street, the best location in Dublin city for shopping and restaurants, the hotel is just a two minutes walk from St Stephens Green Park (lovely for a pre-breakfast stroll). On registration, my wife and I were offered nice and refreshing warm hand towels which we both thought was a really nice touch, our friendly male receptionist informed us he had upgraded us to an executive room which was a nice surprised (really large room, great bathroom, comfy bed and big soft pillows) which was presumably because as we had stayed at the Westbury on previous occasions. Breakfast was included in our room rate and I could not fault the choice or freshness of the wide fayre on offer and they are not too strict on the breakfast finishing time of 10am (much to our relief). In short, The Westbury Hotel is pricy but worth every euro and you will not be disappointed if you choose to stay there.",5,2010,06,14
203,WHAT A FANTASTIC HOTEL,"Just returned (very reluctantly) from a brilliant weekend in Dublin.  We took in A Taste of Dublin at Iveagh Gardens and some retail therapy - which we topped it off beautifuly with a stay at The Westbury. Hotel.  This is a fantastic hotel.  Staff are second to none and nothing was too much trouble from a 9am check in, bag storage, turndown service, delivering a huge bucket of ice to our room and giving us perfect directions.  The porters on duty were particularly good - friendly, knowledgeable and very efficient. 

The room was lovely - a little on the small side - but we spent so little time there- it was not an issue.  Bed was big and so comfy.  Flat screen TV and Nespresso were nice touches.  Breakfast was varied and everything was cooked to perfection.  From ful cooked Irish breakfast buffet to made to order omelettes - plus an amazing selection of gorgeous cooked ham, smoked salmon, cheeses, fruit, yoghurt, cereals, juices, pastries and  breads.  Even the tea/coffee selection was amazing - had a gorgeous latte with my breakfast!!!

The location was the best - right in the middle of a great shopping street - SG Shopping Centre, BT, M&S and lots of little boutiques.  Just a stones throw from St Stephens Green, Gaiety Theatre and Temple Bar.  Great selection of quality restaurants and really great traditional Dublin pubs - all within a short walking distance.  The atmosphere all weekend around the hotel was magic - the streets were full of performers and tourists - all enjoying the sunshine and soaking up the fun.

We just cant wait to go back.  I think we would find it hard to stay anywhere else from now on.",5,2010,06,14
203,awesome as usual...,"Allo

Its probably been a while since I posted a few reviews but my last visit to this hotel spurned me to take time out and give the guys a couple of words of gratitude. Its not the first time I have stayed in this hotel and it wont be the last. I am a regular to Dublins city centre and always make it my business to get at least one trip to the westbury in over a six month period. I think the last time I as there was around december time. 

We started off with a light lunch in the Novo, my better half had some sort of rabbit food, of which she was quite complimentary, I had the fish and chips - wow is all I can say, its a stable of mine and I was delighted with the play on this one with the chips in newspaper, always an old favourite. I also finished off with a chocolate brownie...amazing is the only word for it, cooked to perfection, the ice cream was delicious, it was one of those lunches that lasted forever...

Upstairs then to the bedroom, as always it was immaculate and soooo relaxing I knew why this place regularly costs me a fortune...its that it continually seduces my beloved and she just wants more and more. I have to say a cup of coffee from those fabulous machines they have in the room is just the ticket...where oh where do they get them from...I must enquire further next time I am in. 

After a lounging layabout sort of afternoon and early evening its only appropriate to return to the table to sample more good fare...it may seem indulgent but hey rules are meant to be broken and barriers pushed...We headed down to Wilde for around 8ish. 
Feeling the effects of my lunch I thought it best to start off small and build to a Grande Finale...I started with the Lobster Bisque before heading onto the Fillet of beef (buf of course) - I usually go for a blue steak and omg it was worth every mouth watering morsel....I was left speechless not because I was so full but becasue I enjoyed every bit. Herself had the salad (A recurring theme I hear you say - its the one constant in our relationship - haha) and the chicken, she was impressed and happily satisfied. 
There was definitely no room for desert but I forced it down anyway...you might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb as we used to say in the country. When your in a hotel of this standard it has got to be the Creme Brulee, another mouth watering extravaganza I wont got into the gory details but I definitely needed the extra holes on my belt thats for sure. 

Unfortunately the light was fading and so was I so we didnt make it to the bar, maybe next time. All in all a great time and I cant wait to get back to the hotel and their amazing restaurants....SFM",5,2010,06,13
203,"very classy, fantastic","most recommended, gorgeous place. I would stay again and recommend the hotel.",5,2010,06,11
203,Outstanding - attention to detail is out of this world,"Stayed for 2 nights and can safely say this is the best hotel we have ever stayed in.  The location is great and the service is second to none.  We arrived at 10.30 to drop off our luggage (check in time is 2pm) but we were told our room was ready and were allowed to check in early.  The room was fantastic, the bed was soooo comfortable.  We went out for the evening and came back to find the bed turned down, chocolate on the bed, towels had been changed, mats on the floor saying ""good night"" with slippers - it was just superb, the breakfast was amazing - so much choice! we ate the Cafe Novo which was just beautiful and was good value.  Dont get me wrong it wasnt a cheap stay, but with this hotel you definately get what you pay for - you wont be disappointed (apart from waiting for the lifts which sometimes took forever!)  The only thing that I felt disappointed with is that there wasnt a pool, other than that you simply cannot fault",5,2010,06,10
203,Great Location,"Hotel is in a super location. Everything you want is situated close by. Rooms are well presented and very clean. However, try to avoid the rooms with the outside air conditioning units positioned close to your window.

The area where the afernoon tea is served could do with an upgrade. Sofas are in need of an upgrade as they are tired and worn looking. Carpet could do with a cleaning also.

While the staff are excellent in the hotel we were let down on checkout. No mention of did you enjoy your stay or we look forward to seeing you again, very formal to say the least.",4,2010,06,10
203,Best Location/Service/Room in Dublin,"If you are planning a trip to Dublin, just stay here. The location is perfect. Everything you need is in walkable distance. The hotel is clean, well appointed and has a friendly and efficient staff. The Temple Bar area is about a 10 to 12 minute walk away with loads of pubs, cafes and restaurants, and shopping in between. The Hop on/Hop off bus stop is about 5 or 6 minutes away (in front of Trinity College - with its amazing library).",5,2010,06,09
203,''Perfect for a little overnight treat'',"We live in Dublin but fancied a little treat for the Bank Holiday weekend. Checked in for just one night at lunchtime on Saturday. Check in was very efficient, courteous and polite plus a hot towel to wipe my hands. Nice touch. Went to our room on second floor. Gorgeous fresh smell in the room. We had a bit of shopping and a night out at the Gaiety Theatre and a lovely dinner in Chatham Brasserie just off Grafton Street. A few drinks in Kehoes, after the theatre and we tottled back to the hotel. Staff lovely. Lovely for a break at the weekend, if you fancy something lovely for a little spoiling and not too far from home. Two little dips in service. Offered a Sunday newspaper - no sign of it Sunday morning. No swimming pool at the Westbury. Pity, a little dip after an afternoons shopping would have made it super.",4,2010,06,07
203,Gracious accomodations,"Hotel was lovely, great location, very friendly staff.  Bartender was was helpful in resolving my concerns regarding an unattended briefcase. ...  Overall just wonderful.",5,2010,06,02
203,wonderful stay and amazing attention to detail,"We travelled to the Westbury for a special birthday treat - we were not disappointed. Everything was wonderful, great room, not huge but so well designed that it felt really special and what a treat - aqua di parma toiletries. Fantastic breakfast, delicious fruit, juices, coffee etc, lovely dinner, romantic dining room. But what really lifted the stay was the staff - from the lovely  receptionist, the friendly concierge to the charming cushendall man in the marble bar who conjured up delicious cocktails for us. Special mention is reserved for Joseph in the WIlde restaurant who displayed great attention to detail and who dealt with a minor problem so well that we felt wonderfully special. The staff in the westbury are obviously trained very well and it shows! Thanks Westbury for a really memorable stay!",5,2010,05,31
203,Luxury at its best!!,"Just back from a 2 night stay at the westbury hotel and it was fablous. The best 5* hotel I have ever stayed in.
We checked in early and left our bags until our room was ready. We used hotel car parking and went for lunch in the town Bar & Grill. We chilled out for the rest of the evening in our luxury room and went to Saba next door for dinner-again fablous. Shopping on Grafton street is great and so convenient to hotel.
Positives
Location is second to none. Staff are lovely especially house keeping. hotel is very quiet even though its in the city centre. wonderful atmosphere. nice breakfast and fantastic food in Wilde restaurant. free internet
Negatives
Pillows were not very comfortable. Parking was ‚Ç¨40 whcih we were told on check in but not when booking. No music in lobby either fri/sat night. no pool/spa facilities.
Will return for sure!!",5,2010,05,31
203,"Excellent Hotel, But If Driving Be Prepared!","The Westbury Hotel is an excellent luxury hotel with a lot of little touches that add up to an excellent experience.  Our recent stay there highlighted the good news/bad news relating to its much-touted location in bustling downtown Dublin.  The hotel is one half block off of Grafton Street, which is a pedestrian only avenue devoted to shopping and usually jammed with people during the day.  Grafton ends to the north at Trinity College, one of the tourist highlights of Dublin, and most of what is interesting in Dublin is also within reasonable walking distance.  That's the good news. The bad news comes into play if you are driving to the hotel.  We had spent the week down in Southwest Ireland and innocently made plans to just drive on into Dublin and get out at the hotel and park the car there.  Well, having driven extensively in New York City, Washington, DC, Phiadelphia, Los Angeles, etc. in the states, I can tell you that driving in Dublin is triple the challenge.  And just using a map to get to the Westbury will get you to the general vicinity, but no where near the front door.  The streets are so convoluted, and there are so many one-ways, that without planning akin to what preceeded the invasion of Normandy on D-Day or the launch of Apollo 11 to the moon, you are going to end up going around in circles, desparately trying to get to the hotel.  We ended up just parking in a commerical car park some blocks from the hotel, getting out and walking and then getting directions from the concierge on how to go back to the car and then drive the car park to the hotel.  It turns out that even with the precise directions we had to make concentric circles around the whole of downtown Dublin to finally end up going the right way on some small streets to finally be able to turn down the even narrower little street that takes you to the hotel front door.   

So, the moral of this story is don't plan on driving to the Westbury unless you are a Dublin native or spend hours pouring over maps, briefing a trusted navigator, gearing up your nerves and then -- if possible -- drive in at about 400 am in the morning before the mad bus drivers of Dublin get to work. 

But, as has been noted in these reviews, the hotel is splendid in general, the rooms very well appointed, and the services and ""little things"" done up very well.  The Westbury's lobby is on the second floor, and when we finally got there we found the delightful spectacle of a room full of upscale, prosperous looking people having elegant  high tea. No charge for internet is a decided plus.  Of course, keep in mind that The Westbury is a luxury hotel, so expect to pay room rates accordingly.  

The only other downer had to do with bell staff.  We left early on Sunday morning, and when we called for our car the apparently only individual behind the desk indicated that the (only one on duty?) bell staff was helping a group check out and it would be a while to get our car.  I began to agitate due the high anxiety inculcated by the experience of our initial attempts to navigate Dublin traffice and get to the hotel and visions of getting hopelessly adrift again upon leaving and missing our flight. The man behind the desk did his best to handle the situation, ultimatley calling the bell staff guy over and getting him to abandon the other bags in order to get our car -- and dropping the parking charge from our bill.   Presumably early Sunday morning is not normally a highly busy time for the Westbury, but i would say they were understaffed on this particular Sunday.  (And with detailed directions, we made it to the airport with minimal trouble). 

In general, the Westbury is an excellent upscale place to stay in Dublin once you get there.",5,2010,05,30
203,"Fabulous service, excellent staff, and exceptional attention for guests","I came to Dublin for a business trip, it was my first trip to Ireland. I always dreamed of coming to Ireland, and I will always remember the friendliness of the Westbury Hotel staff, who really took care of me and my colleagues from the U.S. and Asia.  The morning breakfasts were delicious, the lunches & afternoon tea time were just fabulous. The night staff always had friendly answers to our endless questions, and were totally attentive to our needs as a group. The night staff suggested excellent restaurants and hang out spots in the vicinity.  Will definitely Come Back and bring back my business team again and again!!!",5,2010,05,30
203,Very good - just very expensive,You get what you pay for here - the only thing being that you really have to pay for it. The hotel was beautiful and as everyone else says the location is superb. There were 2 weddings on consecutive days at the hotel when we were there but you wouldn't even have known it there was no noise at all. Superb...I feel as though the hotel could provide free parking for people staying in the hotel however. The beds were lovely and compfortable but our superior room was a littel on the small side. However given the location - I don't see how this could be beaten...,4,2010,05,30
203,"I love, love, love it..My favourite","I just love the Westbury. It's my favourite little bit of luxury. This was my first time to take the children...and boy did they take to five-star like ducks to water! Our trip was mostly a shopping one, with a little sight-seeing, but mainly for the Christmas atmosphere. They always have a fabulous huge Xmas tree in the lobby, and really tasteful decorations everywhere. It's really lovely.
My husband and children arrived first, while I followed a little later after hitting Brown Thomas (alone..Heaven!). I received a text that they were in the bar..I arrived to find them huddled over a  pot of hot chocolate and cakes, and a Guinness for the older child!! They were already loving it, organising the cups and saucers and taking turns to pour. 
Onwards to our room, kids loving the seat in the elevator and the long corridor. Our room was perfect, 2 massive beds and as usual, everything perfect.
My main love is the quiet. I'm such a light sleeper that I'm really fussy where I stay, but there's never a sound in the Westbury. It's off street, and with the plush carpets, there's no passing noise in the hallways either. 
We were on our way out in the evening when the Turndown service knocked, and the kids were amazed at the little slippers, (took them home as souvenirs), and the fact that the girl smoothed down the bed for them. One had just been jumping on it as the door was knocked, so she got a fright, but ended up getting pocket fulls of Butlers chocolate from the house keeping staff after-all..very funny.
Breakfast is good, a great choice. We didn't have lunch/dinner here just afternoon tea one day, and lounge food on the sofa's the first evening. Afternoon tea is the best in Dublin, voted by us four! Looking forward to  returning to it as soon as I can.",5,2010,05,20
203,"Perfect location, great hotel","Beautiful hotel in a really great location. Perfect for shopping, socialising, romance, sightseeing and business. Staff were great and I really enjoyed my stay.",5,2010,05,20
203,Wonderful 5 star hotel,"My husband and I have just had a wonderful stay in this hotel. The location is perfect , the staff very welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast was very good, with great choice. We will be definitely returning. Luxury at its best.",5,2010,05,17
203,Could do better,"I stayed at the hotel as part of a business trip.  Initial impression was very good.  Attentive staff when checking in, however I was told the only room that was ready at the time of checking in was a superior room, with walk in shower, but no bath.  I had no problem with this.  When however I arrived in my room, the room was actually set up for someone with special needs.  Handrails in the bathroom and a shower seat and emergency call system set up beside the bed.  Whilst this again is not a problem, I can understand why some mobility impaired or disabled guests feel that receive a poor service when travelling.  On a good note, the bed was very comfortable and there was a good selection of TV stations.  The Krupps coffee maker was a very welcome addition and the buffet breakfast was very nice.  Whilst these were all positve points, I found many things to be sadly lacking or to be faulty.  The toilet seat was broken.  The sink was literally the size of a sink that you would find in a very small cloak room and the shower curtain was only partially on the rail, with most of it hanging off.  The shower barely worked with literally a dribble of water coming out of the shower head.  Part of the shower system was also broken.  There was nowhere to put your wash items.  Most hotel rooms have a good size bathroom with plenty of space to place wash bags etc and a full size sink.  This bathroom literally had no counter space to put anything and I ended up putting items on the floor.  I asked at reception for more milk having used the 2 tiny cartons that had been placed in my room.  Following waiting 25 minutes in my room, I was presented with a full pint glass of milk.     The Westbury hotel has a 5 star rating and yes the furnishings in the hotel lobbies and bars are of a very good standard and you can clearly see that some members of staff were working very hard to give good service, however the room I stayed in was far below 5 star standard and was very disappointing and clearly put a ""damp"" cloud on what i hoped would be a very pleasant and enjoyable stay.",3,2010,05,13
203,Great location!,"Lovely hotel right in the heart of Dublin, right off Grafton Street so close to shops, bars, restaurants.  I am not sure if I would say it‚Äôs a full 5 star hotel maybe 4.5 stars, does not have the usual pool, spa of a 5 star but still a lovely hotel, celeb watching can be one of the pastimes!",4,2010,05,09
203,You can't beat it,"You cannot fail to be impressed by this hotel.  It is perfectly situated and beautifully attired.  The staff range from snooty to lovely though, but with a pinch of salt you will be impressed by this hotel. It is expensive but you are in the perfect spot!  Any chance I get I'll be there!",5,2010,05,08
203,Highly recommended,My wife and I stayed for one night with our two young children. I was deeply impressed by the attention to detail and consistently positive attitude of all the staff. The location is unbeatable and the facilities excellent. My only minor quibble is that the buffet selection at breakfast was limited for a hotel of this standard. I would recommend going room-only and grabbing breakfast nearby - certainly no shortage of options around Grafton St!,5,2010,05,06
203,Excellent all rount experiance,"My partner and I had a 3 night stay in the Westbury at the end of April, and from booking to departure it was an excellent experiance. My boyfriend wanted to watch a particular rugby match whilst we were there, so I checked with the Westbury before we booked , and Sarah the receptionist could not have been more helpful, Also as we were attending the races whilst we were in Ireland , I asked for an early checkin. Whilst I understand no hotel could guarentee this Sarah advised she would make a note of it and we could have the room if it were available. On check in , we were given an upgarde to an executive room which was very spacious, and clean . Throughtout our stay the staff offered a genuine friendliness which is often missing in hotels. The decor in both the rooms and communal areas is great in The Westbury , but I would say the staff are a credit to the hotel , and on any future visits to Dublin , I would always try and stay there again.",5,2010,05,05
203,STUNNING HOTEL & FANTASTIC SERVICE,"Travelled to Dublin for three nights in March with my wife for our wedding anniversary, and I am so pleased I booked the Westbury. The hotel itself is in such a great location for shopping, restaurants, nightlife and sightseeing. As soon as you walk through the front door you are made to feel welcome by the Westbury team, who cannot do enough to make you comfortable. 
The room was spotless and luxurious, and the bed one of the comfiest I've ever slept in. Particularly enjoyed the Nespresso coffee machine. As it was a special occassion, the management had arranged for several ""treats"" to be left in the room each day, from chocolates and strawberries to Whisky!! 
Didnt dine in the main restaurant but the one downstairs was lovely for a snack. 
The cocktail bar was a beautiful place to have a last drink in at night, the staff very courteous, and didnt even bat an eyelid when my wife ordered a hot chocolate!!

All in all a wonderful stay. We will 100% be returning in the future. I have personally recommended the hotel to my closest friends and family. I just hope this doesnt mean it is fully booked when we want to return. 

Thanks to Glenn and Russell and all your team for making our stay so special",5,2010,05,02
203,Fantastic Hotel,"My wife our 2 kids and I booked a weekend in Dublin and decided to stay at the Westbury as it gave the best value for a room with 2 double beds.  I had not stayed in the Westbury in about 7 years as I had not been impressed on our last stay.  From the moment we walked in the door we were impressed.  The lady who checked us in could not have been more helpful, she upgraded us to connecting rooms and rang about 10 minutes after we got to the room to make sure everything was to our satisfaction.  Staff were extremly friendly but not instrusive, doorman shared a joke with the kids as we came and went from the hotel.  Rooms were really nice with the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept in, decor of the hotel is fresh and appealing and the lobby has to be one of the top hotel lobbys in the world.  With service like this the Westbury and Doyle Hotels does our capital city proud.
Finbarr Farrell, Carrickmacross.",5,2010,04,28
203,Wonderful Stay,"My partner and I returned to the Westbury for a one night stay recently.  We had 
previously stayed in the hotel and did not have a 5 star experience.  I can happily say
that our return visit was 5 star.  The staff were friendly and helpful on check in.  Our room
was bright and comfortable - and the bed had to be one of the most comfortable I have
ever slept in.  The bathroom was spacious and new - with lots of hot water.  The in room
nespresso machine is a lovely addition and the coffee a welcome after a long drive to Dublin. The nice touch of 
cup cakes delivered to our room after check in was a lovely touch.   We ordered breakfast to the room next morning and it arrived on time - and of very high
quality.  We are glad to have experienced the real Westbury.  For visiting Dublin city you
just cannot beat the location. We will be back.",5,2010,04,28
203,A Night of Luxury!,"Stayed at the Westbury for one night for a special occasion.  It is a beautiful hotel.  Staff all very friendly and helpful.  Our room was beautiful, on the 6th floor with view over the city.  Bathroom was huge with lots of full length mirrors and a TV!  We had dinner in the Wilde Restaurant which was lovely and breakfast in the sme restaurant was very good also.   We had a large room with a 4 poster bed, large flat screen TV and plenty of comfy chairs to relax in!  Would recommend this hotel for a special occasion.  The Wilde Package was very good value.
One suggestion I would like to make to Management relates to seating in the Wilde Restaurant.  We arrived into the restaurant which had lovely subdued lighting and which created a  lovely feeling of intimacy.  However this was soon spoiled as we were shown to one of 4 tables for 2 which, in my opinion are far too close together.  I could have reached over and touched the table beside ours, it was so close.  For a restaurant with such a lovely ambiance the closeness of the tables was a real disappointment!  We were shown to a similar table for breafast the next morning but this time we had a table on either side, again I could qhite easily reach out and touch each table.  Both myself and my husband felt somewhat intimadated at the lack of privacy.  Next time I am in this restaurant I will ask for a table with a little more privacy but on this occasaion I was not aware of the situation.  Everything else about the hotel was really top class that I cannot understand how this lack of privacy is not recognised.",4,2010,04,26
203,"location,location,location","My wife and I stayed here on the night of our wedding and the subsequent night as we recovered from the day before.
Lovely room. Very clean and well appointed. Fantastic shower and bath.
Room price didn‚Äôt include breakfast but we ordered this to be delivered to the room when we checked in.  
The location of this hotel really is excellent. Grafton street , Irelands premier shopping and entertainment district, is about 30 second walk from the front door of the hotel.
The hotel features a beautiful lounge area on the first floor where we had ( or ‚Äòtook‚Äô as some might say) afternoon tea.
You may even bump into a few celebrities during your visit here. Shane Lynch from Boyzone passed us on his way into the hotel ( with a bag from a local fast food restaraunt also favoured by Colin Farrell called Abrakebebra )
Recommend this hotel for a special treat for a local , a city break for a couple not on a budget.
There are perhaps less expensive hotels in Dublin but none who‚Äôll match the westbury for service and location.",5,2010,04,21
203,Amazing Experience - Will be Back,"From the moment you set foot in the Westbury you are aware that the hotel is special.  Right in the middle of Grafton Street, Dublin, the location is amazing.  The reception staff are professional and curteous, but above all friendly.  The rooms are perfect, the beds, duvets and pillows are items you will want in your home.  The shower is great.  My only regret - that I didn't stay longer.",5,2010,04,20
203,Overpriced!!,This hotel is in a great location in the centre of Dublin and looks lovely as soon as you step in.  The rooms are quite small but then again it is a city hotel.  I do think it is overpriced but then its Dublin also so you kind of expect that. We had cocktails and they were some of the best we have tasted!  Breakfast was lovely and was a great start to the day too!  Would recommend if you are not on a tight budget!,3,2010,04,18
203,Perfection,"My mother and I stayed at the Westbury for 2 nights last week. We chose the Westbury having read the reviews on Tripadvisor and also looking at the Doyle Hotel website. We were not disappointed. It was simply excellent in every way.
Good points:
1) Attention to detail - everywhere in this hotel was utterly immaculate - the bedrooms, the main lounge areas, dining area, bar. The turndown service in the evening was very good - additional toiletries added, chocolate on pillow and slippers by bed.
2) Decor - the hotel has recently completed a complete refurbishment and a beautiful palette of pale shades has been used. Quality is everywhere. A delightfully relaxing atmosphere has been created in the main lounge area, with a contemporary look in the restaurant and bar.
3) Staff - everyone we met was helpful and delightful to speak to. This includes particularly the concierges, the staff in the restaurants and the Assistant Manager.
4) Location - a 30 second walk and we were on Grafton Street. The location cannot be beaten and we heard no noise in our room. It was a sanctuary of quietness.
5) Value - we purchased the Wilde package which for an extra 100 euros included breakfast, a 4 course meal, two cocktails and a bottle of wine. It was excellent value for money and most enjoyable.

I cannot think of any negatives concerning our stay. We simply cannot wait to return to such a beautiful hotel with such delightful and welcoming staff. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin on leisure or business.",5,2010,04,18
203,A luxurious hotel in an amazing location !,"I stayed at this hotel on Friday April 9th with my friend.  It was my first time staying there but guaranteed we will be back for more.   The service was excellent, the ambience in the hotel was lovely, the room was luxurious with a Nespresso coffee maker all to ourselves, the food was excellent we just could not have been happier with the whole experience.
The hotel is situated in a quiet side street off the main shopping street in Dublin,  very convenient for shopping and the famous Temple Bar area with its teeming night life is also on your door step (without interfering with the wonderful peace and tranquility of the hotel)
I would highly recommend this hotel to any discerning traveller who is looking for quality and luxury at an affordable price.",5,2010,04,18
203,We had a family occassion in the Westbury...,"We had a family occassion in the Westbury at the start of March. I could not recommend the hotel highly enough. The staff were always extremely helpful, food excellent and the bedrooms were ideal. it is perfectly located next to one of the best known shopping streets in Dublin, Grafton St.",5,2010,04,14
203,Fabulous luxury hotel in a great location,"My best friend and I have just returned from a girlie weekend in Dublin where we stayed at the rather fabulous Westbury Hotel.  We were able to check in as soon as we arrived (9am) which was great and the lady who checked us in was very helpful, providing us with a map and pointing out all the bits we wanted to see - she also pointed us in the direction of the complimentary tea, coffee and pastries which are served in the lobby until 10.30am, which was a nice touch.

We stayed in a twin room which was spacious and beautifully decorated.  There was a flat screen TV set into the wall at the end of the bed and a Nespresso machine and, although we had no real view to speak of, it was perfect for the two of us.  On spying the Aqua di Parma toiletries we imagined ourselves fighting over them, but no need as they were replenished each morning.  We also enjoyed the chocolates that came each evening with the turndown service, and the beds were so comfortable that we almost didn't get up to do any sightseeing!

All of the hotel staff were very friendly - always there to help but never overbearing - and the public areas of the hotel are lovely and have a really luxurious feel.  We didn't eat in either the restaurant or the cafe so cannot comment on that, but both looked very nice.

All in all I don't think we could have chosen a better hotel - the location is perfect for shopping, sightseeing and is close (but not too close) to restaurants and bars for the evenings.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat and will absolutely be recommending The Westbury to anyone who wants to visit Dublin.",5,2010,04,13
203,Westbury...... a step above....,"Times change and so do people and places and in all honesty so has my opinion on The Westbury Hotel. I went there last year and I left the hotel formal and subdued and not really understanding why??.

 But rather then harp on and step into the banal, let me take this opportunity to sincerely thank this hotel and management and indeed all of the staff I met and had interactions with over the weekend. It was special, it was sincere and warm and all elements had a sense of class and eloquence that are not easy to find.

 So for location, people, service, atmosphere, special memories The Westbury has it all‚Ä¶. in abundance‚Ä¶. My thanks for turning back the clock",5,2010,04,12
203,Amazing hotel,"I booked this hotel for my mum's 60th birthday - they stayed for 2 nights for 4 people. I live in Dublin and she was over to visit so I wanted to make it special. I had never been to the Westbury but booked it based on location. From the moment we stepped inside - WOW! It was beautiful. Great views of the city, very clean and glamourous. We were very impressed. Only issue we had was I booked through the Doyle website and used my credit card to pay for an advanced booking rate, however when we arrived the payment was not taken and so my mum had to pay out as I was not there from the start! Not a good start to a treat. :-) Still the receptionists honored the advance rate and apologised. 

The rooms are amazing, the lobby and bars are brilliant as are the cocktails. Best thing about the hotel is the location. You couldn't be better located in Dublin. Within walking distance to all the main attractions of Dublin. Had never been before, but anyone coming to visit will be staying here in future. And we continue to return for the meals and cocktails. Definately stay here if you are visting Dublin. It made my mums 60th birthday amazing.",5,2010,03,29
203,Enjoyable experience,"This hotel is newly renovated and does offer a luxury standard. The wilde restaurant was great for dinner. Got upgraded to a suite which was super for our romantic weekend away. Best thing about the hotel is its location. It is on grafton street so shopping, bars and restaurants are only seconds away. We will return.",4,2010,03,27
203,Absolute Luxury and Comfort,"My wife and I plus 2 friends booked to stay in this Hotel for Saint Patricks day. Both couples booked Superior rooms and we were very pleased with the comfort and facilities. Although we had booked non smoking rooms our friends found a distinct smell of smoke in their room and were promptly moved to an upgraded Luxury room.

Rooms were very clean, bright and fresh. Staff were freindly and welcoming. We arrived very early and although we could not check in the receptionist took my mobile number and contacted me as soon as the rooms were ready. 

I would have no hesistation in recommending this Hotel to any traveller who wants to feel cosseted and special. Wish I could return again soon..",5,2010,03,25
203,Fantastic Restaurants,"Very impressed with the Cafe Nova restaurant. We each said we would be back . 
The service was excellent, Food perfect . We had a family gathering for my sons 21st and I could not have asked for a better night. Thank you very much for such service and making it such a special night.",5,2010,03,24
203,Fabulous!,From check-in to check-out our stay was amazing!  Service was excellent - friendly and not overdone- the room was luxurious and all the little touches made all the difference- and all this in the best location in Dublin!,5,2010,03,21
203,Perfect Business Hotel,"Recently stayed at the Westbury at the beginning of March for a business trip. We had several rooms booked by the company and we all agreed that this was one of the best hotels we had been to. It is well located on grafton street and has all the business facilities one would require. We especially found the 24 hour business centre to be of great help as we had a number of business presentations to prepare for.

We had dinner in cafe novo on the first night of our stay - the steak sandwiches were excellent and deliciously tender..

Great hotel, great location and great service !",5,2010,03,20
203,Afternoon Tea disaster Twice,"My wife and I were given a voucher for afternoon tea at the Westbury as a Christmas present. We decided to sue the voucher in January whilst en route to a play in the Abbey Theatre. When we arrived there was a big crowd and we were asked to wait about 20 minutes whihc is quite understandle. At 4.10pm we were allocated a table and placed our order. The tea (drinking aspect) arrived promptly but we were still waiting for the food elemt at 5.25pm, AN HOUR AND 10 MINUTES afetr table allocation. 

I complained in writing and was affered a comlimentary afternoon tea for two which i accepted. 

We attended fro afternoon tea last Saturday (13th March) after making telephone contact first. Our rexerved table was waiting for us on arrival and the tea (drinking aspect) was once again served promptly and was excellent. The food however was an insult. It consisted of a tea for one where we had to share the sandwich choices by actually cutting them in half. The bread was wet and the cake choice abysmal.

We will never darken their doors again. Take warning, this afternoon tea is expensive and definitely not worth taking the chance.",1,2010,03,18
203,Fantastic Location - Great Hotel - Great Services. Top Class.,"I love others in the Doyle Collection of hotels and I now love the Westbury hotel! Stayed here for just one night (sat 06th Mar). I booked the room by emailing the hotel directly. Very efficient and detailed info was provided. The hotel is in the most amazing location for access to all Dublin has to offer. Right off Grafton Street and so 2mins walking to the shops St. Stephens Green, Temple Bar etc. Staff very friendly and efficient. The room was a deluxe room with four poster bed. Massive modern room. Very clean. Bathroom was small relative to the room and was the only disappointment. The toilet flush was bad and water pressure wasnt great. But didnt cause a major issue. Otherwise the room was fantastic. Cupcakes were delivered in the afternoon and having a Nespresso machine in the room meant afternoon coffee was extra special! A free bottle of water in the room would have been good, but there are convenience stores close by to stock up on water. A/C worked well - some hotels pre-set the A/C but the Westbury A/C system was great - very configurable. There was also a device to connect your IPOD. The room was at the end of the corridor and was near to Grafton St. side so until about 7pm there was some noise from the buskers on Grafton St. but after 7pm this died down and so a pretty restful sleep was had. The bed was SOOO comfortable. I will attest to what other reviewers have said here. Best bed (on par with Hyatt Dreamaker) ever. I loved the style and design of the hotel. Similar to other Doyle Collection hotel is e.g. London (Marylebone). Breakfast was great. Good selection and not a mad dash for food as the breakfast room is very large nut cozy. I loved it. I rate this hotel very highly. I do hope prices stay reasonable though - as Dublin itself is expensive to visit. I travel a lot with work and pleasure and I've stayed in many hotels around the world from Four Seasons to Hampton Inns! I found this hotel rated very highly and I will return. Excellent!",4,2010,03,16
203,fantastic cocktail experience,"This is our first trip to Ireland and our first review, we are currently on a break in Ireland, although we did not stay in the westbury wishing now that we had i just had to write a review. From start to finish our night in the Marble bar was what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Impeccable staff excellent cocktails all served with a smile. If you get a chance please ask for a cocktail that is not on their menu you wont be disappointed.  I asked for a cocktail with fresh pineapple for my wife and a white russian for myself. The cocktails arrived, well presented the cocktail for my wife was just amazing fresh pineapple mint lemon vodka a real treat from start to finish. The white russian was the best ive had since being in ireland best part was the garnish a piece of chocolate just heaven, my wife got a little jealous of the candy ,the young man i think his name was Garry  then came over with some of the chocolate garnish for her. We cant wait to come back to this wonderful hotel and sample the rest of the delights this hotel surely has to offer.",5,2010,03,10
203,Wonderful Hotel in a Fantastic Location!,"My husband booked this hotel and I'm glad he did!  A couple weeks before our trip, a week over New Years, the Hotel GM contacted us and offered us assistance with any questions we had.  He suggested we take a taxi over the AirLink Bus as it would only be a couple Euro's more and it would drop us off right at the door.  Also, our plane was getting into Dublin at 8am so he set us up for early check-in.  The best surprise of all, and something that made our amazing trip just perfect, was that he also upgraded us to a Suite with no rate increase. I don't know if this happens often or if it's just a slow time in this world economy, especially at a 5-star hotel like this, but it was a very welcome gift from the GM.

So our plane arrived on time and we got our bags. Not knowing if the taxis take CC's, I went and exchanged a couple hundred dollars while my husband waited for our bags. We just didn't want to be caught without euros if we needed them. After we get our bags, we go through some automatic doors and find ATMS, etc. So, if you want some euros, wait until after you get your bags, go through the doors and use the ATM, much better exchange rates.  We take the GM's advice and get into a taxi.  We're glad we did as it was cold and rainy the day we arrived and dragging our bags for about 3/8 of a mile from the Trinity College dropoff for AirLink would not have been a pleasureable experience.  The AirLink would of cost us 14 euro and the taxi ride was 18 euro.  Well worth 4 euro to us to be dropped off right at the door in that weather.

The hotel doesn't look extravagant from the outside but when you walk in, wow! It's a beautiful hotel and you feel 5-star as soon as you walk in.  We check-in and the staff was very friendly. There is a restaurant in the hotel, although we never ate there so can't speak about it.  There is also a bar area as well.  We went up to our suite and it was very nice. Large room with a very comfortable king-size, 4 -poster bed.  There were a couple elegant chairs by the flat screen TV as well as a desk.  It included a coffee/tea maker w/ an abundant choice of coffees/teas, a stocked mini-fridge, and coffee cups, glasses, and champaign glasses all available.  The bathroom was very big with its own flat screen tv, a combined tub/shower, 2 sinks, and heated towel racks.  They made up the room every day and come by for turn-down every night, leaving chocolates on the bed.

The Westbury is right off of Grafton St and is in the center of the section converted to pedestrian only.  Whether you walk out of the front door or the back door, there are shops, restaurants, etc.. right there.  We walked to most places right from the hotel, including Temple Bar which is right across the river. There's also a visitor center right around the corner housed in and old church that we recommend you go to.  The Hop-On, Hop-Off buses are nearby with a stop at Trinity College and there is a bus/train station close by too.  We walked to the train station one day and took a train out to Malahide.

We had a wonderful week in Ireland and believe the location and comfort of The Westbury was a big part of it.  We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to make their Dublin vacation the best they can.",5,2010,03,07
203,Absolute Perfection,"Location doesn't get any better than this, but that was just the beginning of our Westbury experience, and we were blown away by every apsect of our stay. 5 star hotels carry an expectation of being a bit stuffy and over the top, but this was sheer luxury with a home away from home vibe. The staff were extremely welcoming, and could not do enough to help, from check in to check out. Knowledge of the local area and recommendations were impressive, and everyone we encountered seemed to genuinely enjoy their job, from the friendly reception team to the enthusiasm of the bar staff, we didn't feel the need to leave the hotel for anything as we had it all under one roof.

 The best part of our stay was the escape to our luxurious room after a hard days shopping! ""Heavenly"" best describes the massive bed, I have never experienced anything as comfortable and truly felt like a princess. His and hers wash basins, full size toiletries and a television to watch from a relaxing bubble bath made for a happy lady, and an espresso machine, flat sceen television and well stocked mini bar made for a happy man. Guest comfort was clearly foremost, with heating, air con and windows that actually open as a added bonus, and of course the customary robe and slippers.

Shopping, nightlife and theatres are all on the doorstep of this prime location. Breakfast offered something for all tastes, from smoked salmon and capers or full Irish to fresh fruit and yoghurt or warm pastries, and a choice of restaurant or bistro for dinner meant we didn't have far to go to find food. Don't miss out on the mojito's at the bar- the best I've ever had. The Westbury made for an all round perfect experience of Dublin, and the wonderful staff made it a truly memorable weekend- I can't wait to return.",5,2010,03,06
203,5 Star stay at this gorgeous hotel,"Great hotel and in the best location just steps into Grafton and St Stephen's Green. It's not on a major road in fact it's in a corner that dead ends so hardly any traffic noise. First class service from the time we walked in with a welcome at the front desk with lavendar washcloths. We were allowed to check in early and were upgraded to an executive suite. 

The room was huge for Dublin standards and top notch decor, linens and marble bathroom.  Top notch bath products and a heated towel rack (which is helpful in the Dublin cold weather). I highly recommend this hotel... make sure to go and have high tea in the lobby. Great view, service and tasty food. Fyi, you can reserve a table by the window or by the fireplace.",5,2010,03,05
203,Something Really Special!,"I had never stayed in the Westbury or any of the Doyle Collection Hotels, but a friend of mine did recommend this beautiful Hotel. From the moment I picked up the phone to book until I left the car park, my stay was really enjoyable.

I booked to stay on the 26th of Feb for 2 nights, it was a romantic getaway for myself and the boyfriend. When I called reservations the girl was really nice, she recommend Wilde (one of the restaurants) and requested an upgrade for us because I told her it was a special occasion. She was so down to earth and I really enjoyed speaking with her. Think her name was Michelle or Rochelle...

The Hotel bedrooms are stunning. Got a nice Studio Room on the 6th floor. All the staff were really nice and it felt like no task was to large!

I would definitly recommend this Hotel. The location is amazing and it is really chic!
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!

See you again soon - Hopefully!",5,2010,03,03

203,"Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic","Well what can I say, this hotel is pure class and well deserves it's five star rating.  I went with 8 other friends for birthday celebration for a one night stay on 27 February.  The hotel manager and all his staff were extremely attentive and nothing was too much for them to do.  The position of the hotel is perfect for shopping and a short walk to Temple Bar for a good night out.  The hotel is extremely clean and well mantained.  We had a family room, for four adults and we never felt cramped, the room was huge!!  Can I please take this opportunity to thank all the staff at the Westbury for making the weekend such a memorable one - thank you!  Can't wait to come back!",5,2010,03,01

203,Go To Hotel for Dublin,"Excellent Stay as usual...sidenote from recent stay in Augusy 2009- had found rate online and booked...was one of those ""internet posting mistakes"" but they honored the booking...studio rooms(4) should have been 710euro....but was posted at 71 euro.....needless to say family was enthralled!!! This stay still up to quality and worth the rate paid....no better centrally located hotel with qualiity service from every member of the staff.....me and the woman will always make this our go to hotel when in Dublin.....total experience still rates 5 stars.",5,2010,02,25
203,OHHH such lovely staff and comfy beds,"Booked a special package  directly with doyles collection as it best friends birthday, and had stayed before. I arrived early and was delighted that room was ready and could dump bags and have a much needed cup of tea! The front reception ( Lisa) was good as her word in that valet parking was ready and waiting when friend arrived with car, so she didn't need to navigate the car park, and no mention was made of the birthday suprise that had been pre arranged with MIchelle . After a few hours shopping we were ready for hot baths
(georgeous Aqua di Parma goodies) and in need of good food!  Dinner was superb, especially the steaks ( not always easy to get a genuine ""bleu"" steaks)  the inclusive wine chioice was excellent, the  birthday cake, with candle had been held back tiil friend  returned from re applying lippy, excellent timing by staff! Cocktails quite scrummy!  It even snowed that night, and we enjoyed looking at it from the warmth  (and distance ) of the very comfortable settee's in the lobby. After dinner, wine, and cocktails we were ready for our beds, our room had the most comfy beds and pillows, nice that the room was NOT overheated too. Breakfast the next day was substantial and delicious, hard to believe that we could even look at food again!  My only tiny criticsm is a lack of tea bags, and the kettle had a very short electrical lead....so some careful balancing was needed... but this is just a tiny criticism, would warmly recommend the Westbury for excellent staff ( nothing was a bother), very good food and sublime sleeps, for a city centre hotel, this ticks all the boxes",5,2010,02,23
203,Staggeringly superb... both hotel and staff...,"Just arrived back from a weekend stay in Dublin.  Hospitality with a capital H, service with a smile... nothing was too much trouble.  We will be engineering another visit asap...!",5,2010,02,22
203,the only hotel were roomservice & breakfast are a pleasure,"I travel at least 4 days a week and will always try to arrange my Irish trips around this Dublins Premier hotel-I think what you have done with the Wilde restaurant is super and really love brining clients for your Angus Irish beef(love your steak display-no were else goes to such detail) and your manager Greg is a surgeon when it comes to dover Sole being de-boned
But the real gem in this hotel is your breakfast offering-other dublin hotels would do well to follow
your roomservice people are salt of the earth(very attentive)",5,2010,02,20
203,"Special,Spectacular and couldnt do enough..superb service...",Booked The Westbury as a treat for myself and my friend to celebrate a special occasion at the end of January..for service and hospitality this hotel cant be beaten. The concierge looked after my bags the day before check in so I could go shopping..when we checked in we were upgraded to a 4 poster room which was just lovely...we had cocktails in the bar which were super. I cant reccomend the Westbury highly enough - having stayed in some pretty spectacular hotels this one tops them all. Thank-you to Russell and staff for a wonderful and memorable stay - I would certainly make the Westbury my first pick when visiting Dublin again.,5,2010,02,15
203,5* Hotel in a Great Location,"We stayed at The Westbury from 11th-14th Feb..The Hotel is in a great location, right in the middle of Dublin, and is great value for money.
The bedrooms are very comfortable and stylish,the bathrooms modern with nice toiletries( I can't believe that one reviewer actually took a picture of a minute hole in one of the bathroom tiles!), and a very nice touch is the turn-down service in the evening, so that you return to your room after a night out and slippers and chocolates are set out for you.
There's a choice of breakfast, the full Irish in the restaurant or a continental(which is complementary) in the first floor lounge.We had dinner in Cafe Novo one evening and found it to be excellent.We also liked the nespresso coffee machine in our room.
We had a fabulous weekend in Dublin and from check-in with the efficient and friendly staff to check out we loved the Westbury.",5,2010,02,15
203,Enjoyable stay with a few little flaws!!,"Checked into the Westbury Hotel for a mini break to celebrate Valentine' s Day. Check-in was slightly slow but the staff were friendly and i liked the touch of the roses and candles on the desk.

The location was great as within minutes of all the best shops.

The room was nice and cozy, adequate for two people, two drawbacks were the small holes in the bathroom floor tiles and one of the bedside lamps did not work.

We had afternoon tea which was very tasty, with a good choice of sandwiches and pastries.

Room service was a disappointment for me, i had a cheese and ham toasted sandwich with chips which was cold and i asked for white bread and i got brown, however my partner''s korma was very nice.

Check out was quick, it was a shame we were only there for 24 hours, would return again for longer and hoepfully they would of sorted out the small disappointments.",4,2010,02,14
203,OUTSTANDING!,I had the pleasure to stay at The Westbury again whilst working in one of Dublin's landmark theatre. I would like to extend my compliments to the outstanding staff- every need is catered for with a big smile and great manners. The rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated and the food delicious. The entire atmosphere makes one feel at home! Thank you again and I hope to be back soon again.,5,2010,02,14
203,Just What it says on the tin - very very Good,"The hotel is excellent , everything you would expect from such a well known and stylish hotel , and in the best location in Dublin. 
Staff were friendly and helpful everything about the hotel from the cocktail bar to the complimentary continental breakfast made for a realy good stay in Dublin. Would recommend the hotel to anyone staying in Dublin . I will definitely stay here when I am next in Dublin",5,2010,02,12
203,First Class All the Way,"I stayed at the hotel for 3 days in early January.  Dublin was virtually shutdown due to snow and ice.  The Westbury proved to be a haven in frosty Dublin.  The staff was wonderful ... nothing was too much trouble for them.  I especially enjoyed the bar/lounge, where afternoon tea and drinks are served in a beautifully furnished drawing room.  We had to leave the hotel at 5 AM to catch an early morning flight.  The front desk kept track of the weather throughout the night, and when it began snowing at 3 AM, they called the taxi to come earlier, and modified our wake-up time.  While I wasn't exactly thrilled to get up early, I definitely appreciated the diligence and intelligence of the Westbury staff so that we were able to make our flight.  Highly recommended!!",5,2010,02,11
203,Best Hotel in Central Dublin,"This hotel is the best hotel in Central Dublin, perfect for leisure or business! Great food & beverage facilities & service to match . But the real gem about this hotel is the staff professional & friendly!",5,2010,02,11
203,EXCELLENT,"Myself and my husband stayed here on Jan 28 it was a treat for his 50 b'day. We thoroughly  enjoyed every minute of it. Reservations were extremely helpful when booking, and all the staff we encountered on our stay were excellent. Would highly recommend it. Best hotel we have stayed in, in Ireland by far. Hope to be back soon.",5,2010,02,11
203,excellent,"got an upgrade on checking in, on phoning reservations they were very helpful.
room was excellent! really great!!.location is perfect for leisure for couples.
highly recommend, lovely treat!!  had a ball!!
car parking available at a fixed price. staff excellent",5,2010,02,08
203,The best hotel in Dublin by far!!!!,"Me and my partner visited Dublin on the 6th February for 2 nights to celebrate our anniversary, from the moment we entered to the time we left we enjoyed every second.  The hotel is fantastic, superbly clean and a pleasure to stay in.  Please  dont listen to any negative comments on this hotel.....there is not one thing i could fault the hotel one bit its the little extras that make a difference like the hot refreshing towels on arrival, the complimentary muffins in the room, the chocolates at night time and the free pastries for breakfast. There are crystal glasses in all rooms and a modern coffee machine, a safe and all the information you will need 
The staff were more than friendly to us, the food was gorgeous, the rooms were beautiful and the cocktails are to die for!!

I have stayed at many top 5 star hotels but i must say that The Westbury tops them all so much so that we are planning are next stay there.  The location is fantastic but one thing i would say is take lots of spending money as Dublin it is one of the most expensives places on earth but well worth it.  I could go one and one with good points for this hotel, but to understand the true pleasure i would recommend you stay here.

I would like to thank all staff here for a wonderful memorable first visit to Dublin....we WILL be returning",5,2010,02,08
203,best nights sleep every,"hi satyed in the westbury on sat night and from we entered the hotel to we left was just so relexing. the hotel is so central to everything and no noise could be heard from our rooms. my mother in law who turned 77 the same weekend had the best nights sleep she has ever had as did we, in fact she asked about the name of mattress to go home and buy one. the rooms , the food, the service all was fantastic would love too stay here again and hope to send my parents here during the year",5,2010,02,08
203,Disappointing,"Booked this hotel as a treat for my stay , during dublin, expecting a lovely stay due to 5* rating and the price i paid, while to be fair some of the staff were friendly , a few were just unpleasant, on waiting for a taxi, i was asked what i was doing waiting in lobby, when i said i was a guest, they just walked away, often left waiting to be served up to 20 minutes on quiet periods , overlooked to larger parties, didn't think they looked after individual guests at all, have stayed in 3 and 4 star hotels which were more deserving.",1,2010,02,06
203,The best Hotel in Dublin,"After an excellent experience with The Westbury last October, we choose to stay again.  We booked the Stay Lazy package which is a very good deal, you get your room, full breakfast and 25 euro credit to use at any of the two hotel restaurants.

On arrival we were very pleased as we were upgraded once again to a studo suite and allocated the same room that we stayed in last time.  The room was a large room with a four poster king size bed, very comfortable. The bathroom was also very spacious  with a flat screen tv to watch when in the bath.

We had lunch at Cafe Novo, one of the restaurants at the hotel.  With a good atmosphere and friendly staff serving excellent food at a reasonable price, we were well pleased that we chose to eat there.  We also had drinks in the Marble bar which were enjoyable as once again we were greeted by very friendly staff in nice and relaxing environment.

Breakfast the following morning was served in Wilde The Restaurant. The decor of this room is excellent we were sitted by the window with a view of the front of the hotel.  The breakfast was buffet style,  from a full Irish breakfast to an extensive choice of cold items to choose from.  At the same time a member of staff was always on hand making sure that we had fresh coffee and toast.

The hotel is in a great location and is tastefully decorated  which can be seen by the photos on its website.  But take it from me it is the staff that makes this hotel tick.  Each and every one of them  are willing to go that extra mile to make your stay all the more enjoyable.

I would recommend this hotel as I think that it is the best hotel in Dublin.  

I am already looking forward to returning in October.",5,2010,01,25
203,Wonderful,"I spent one night (january 22nd) at The Westbury Hotel with my husband and another couple.  We were in Dublin for the musical We Will Rock You at The O2,  The hotel was simply fantastic- it far surpassed our expectations.  We arrived at the hotel at 6p.m. and our car was taken and parked for us.  We were checked in swiftly by a lovely receptionist who was extremely effecient and friendly.  All of the staff which we had any dealing with during our brief stay were courteous and efficient.  We decided to have a quick snack before heading to the O2- this was had in ultra comfortable surroundings.  Service was efficient and friendly-a little on the expensive side for what we had but very nice.

The bedrooms were super- we were in the king suites.  The space was exceptional.  It was sheer luxury- the beds were huge and extremely comfortable.  The bathrooms were spotless with ample supply of towels.  The dressing area was an added bonus.  Dressing robes and slippers a very nice touch as were the Lily O'Brien sweets on the bed.

We decided to breakfast late-10a.m.-breakfast finishes at 10.30a.m.  The dining room was lovely.  we were given a very nice table for four.  Tablelinen and cutlery all of highest quality.  The breakfast was delicious-everything was fresh and tasty.  We lingered over breakfast for well over an hour and nobody put us under pressure to leave the dining room.  

I would like to complement The Westbury Hotel and indeed the Doyle Group on the standard which we found at The Westbury last Friday night.  My only regret is that we were there for such a short time.  It is indeed a super super five star hotel in an excellent location in Dublin.",5,2010,01,24
203,best hotel in dublin,"Stayed at the westbury in July and had a great stay. We were greated at the door by the concierge who took are bags to reception and then to the room. The rooms are very well appointed and have the wow factor, the room that I stayed in was very spacious.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful including manager Joseph who was very accommodating.
The atmosphere in the gallery lounge is fantastic and you could spend all day there relaxing. As for the location it is one of the best, being located on Grafton street (the main shopping street in dublin).
The only downside is that there is only a coffee machine in the room which is very difficult to use to make tea and there is only small espresso like cups to drink the tea/coffee from, but this is only a small criticism.
We are hoping to return to the hotel in the near future and I would highly recoomend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin!!!",5,2010,01,23
203,Perfect Location,"Stayed here for 4 nights over new year - got a good room only deal on the LHW website. The location is fantastic - literally 2 steps off Grafton Street with access to a plethora of restaurants & pubs.
Took the air bus from the airport to the bottom of Grafton Street - only a 5 minute walk up the pedestrianised street to the hotel. A much cheaper option than a taxi at only 7 euro each.
Check-in was swift. We had room 521 opposite the lift - decor was impeccable and the nespresso machines are a particularly nice touch (although 2 'jiggers' of milk a day was never enough). 
I found the beds too soft - guess that's personal preference. 
One worry was the outside wall which was wet throughout the day & evening making sitting in the lovely chairs a bit damp - had to keep the heavy curtains closed.
The room directory says that there is an ice-machine on every floor. Had to go downstairs to ask where it was only to be told there wasn't one!

When I made the booking on-line I had pre-booked Afternoon Tea at the same time for New Year's Day, which they had trouble tracing upon check-in and this is where it went a little downhill for me. As for the afternoon tea - this is lovely apart from the fact that on the menu it states clotted cream (something I deem to be an afternoon tea staple!) but all we got was a small pot of whipped cream that tasted as if it had been sitting in the same fridge as the smoked salmon - no apology for lack of clotted cream. 
As we were with friends, I didn't want to make a fuss. However 2 days later we had coffee & scones in the Lounge and again the same old whipped cream at which point I made a comment to a suited gentleman who appeared to be in charge. Unfortunately the only explanation I received was that it was very busy and they had not had a delivery over new year (not acceptable I'm afraid as we had tea booked at 3.00pm - when it supposedly starts being served).
I know it seems like a petty thing, but at an establishment like this I would at least expect to be advised when ordering that it has run out. Alternatively, if you only serve whipped cream - take clotted off the menu!

However, all in all I would love to pay this hotel another visit when I'm next in town.
A few recommendations include Bewleys for brekkie, Gotham Cafe on South Anne Street for anytime, the Long Hall Pub on George Street , Yamamori Noodles & Acapulco (amazing Margaritas!) also on George Street.",5,2010,01,20
203,There is Joy in January!,"What a great way to get over the January blues, TREAT YOURSELF!! One stop THE WESTBURY HOTEL. What a fantastic hotel with employees with such good manners and charm. No problems checking in and before I could blink I was in paradise! Jumped (lightly!) onto my lovely big bed and then proceeded back into living area were I enjoyed a peaceful rest on the giant couch while watching some TV. Some lovely complementary chocolates were brought up to the room which was a nice touch! The bathroom was sparkling and roomy. I could have stayed in my room all night but went out on the town! 
With an ample amount of restaurants and pubs you are spoilt for choice and no need for taxis!  What a location!
Check out time 12.00 its time to say goodbye! Staff friendly and capable again. I was able to leave my car free of charge, just had to come back and validate my ticket.  Took that opportunity to enjoy a lovely stroll around Stephen Green and do some shopping.

If you are looking for some escapism and luxury The Westbury is your hotel!",5,2010,01,20
203,Pillow Perfect,"My one night stay in the Westbury was a sheer delight. From the moment I stepped inside the magnificent building I was instantly impressed with its lovely interior and elegance. The receptionist was extremely friendly and proficient and had us checked in in minutes. We also got complementary refreshment towels within seconds and was also offered a complementary Sunday newspaper for the next day!

As we entered the suite (upgrade) we couldn‚Äôt believe the size of the room! It was beautifully decorated with lovely African Ornaments and it had a gigantic couch and TV to go with it. 
The bedroom was spacious and had a four post bed and TV and lots of wardrobe space! 

The windows were the whole length of the 2 rooms which gave me a great view and great  light to the room.

The bathroom was big and clean and had both a shower and a bath and had an endless supply of towels

The curtains on the windows were very dark and heavy which made my sleeping experience very pleasant as I don‚Äôt like any bit of light coming through in the morning! 
And the pillows were exceptionally comfortable which is very important to me!

Grafton Street at your doorstep is a wonderful treat so you couldn‚Äôt ask for a better location.

GREAT LOCATION, GREAT ROOMS, GREAT SERVICE, GREAT PILLOWS and PLENTIFUL TOWELS made this stay one to remember!",5,2010,01,20
203,beautiful hotel,"After reading previous reviews, we decided on the Westbury. Contacted the hotel prior to arrival and was provided with an upgrade.  The suite was gorgeous and the connecting room for our daughters was the perfect arrangement.  The staff was very accomodating, hotel was immaculate, and location was great.  We would definitely return and stay at the Westbury again.  The only caution I would advise is the Full Irish Breakfast - watery eggs, average sausage and bacon - the continental buffet that came with the room is sufficient and much more appealing.  My most sincere thanks to Russell Hadley and Michelle Ebbs who handled our reservation and assured our room was ready for our 9am arrival.",4,2010,01,19
203,"Truely Magical Stay - From Start to Finish, Never Wanted to leave","We booked this stay as a surprise for my mam's 50th and it was in her own words"" The most incredible birthday present we could have given her"". She had actually stayed in the shelbourne hotel 2 weeks previous and said her Westbury stay was streets above her stay in the Shelbourne Hotel.
Just everything from the start was perfect, nothing was too much hassle.
I had requested an area to be reserved for Brunch as we were meeting her as a surprise and when we arrive there had been an amazing area in front of the fire reserved for us completly laid out. When we decided to check in we were then shown to our rooms which turned out to consist of the most amazing four poster bed suite with an adjoining room so that the whole family could be in essence in one room. 
I work in the business myself and I know it's the small touches which distinguish a good hotel from a great hotel such as the personalized letter that was in the room wishing my mother a very happy birthday, the bottle of wine with the most amazing home-made chocolate and strawberries, to breakfast the next morning being brought to the room at the exact time requested, set up in the room and everyone‚Äôs individual breakfast cooked exactly as requested.
There is not one critism I have about our stay, the rooms and decor were amazing, staff were incredibly efficient and courteous and no request that we had was ever meet with a
hesitation. 
On the whole we all felt as a family that for the 2 days we spent in the Westbury we were wrapped in an amazing cocoon where we could cut ourselves off from reality and just relax and enjoy each other's company. This is truly a magnificent hotel that has gone through a fantastic make over to bring the decor up to the 21st century style but has still managed to retain its fantastic character and impeccable customer service for which it was always renowned for.",5,2010,01,19
203,Best feeling in the world when you enter the Westbury,"Our stay was wonderful and we were well looked after, even though there were happy revelers in the corridor at 3am and we were awoken. We were invited back at a reduced rate to compensate, without even complaining. This hotel is class",5,2010,01,16
203,Dublins only hotel to spend New Years Eve In!,"I had the pleasure of staying in The Westbury to celebrate New Years Eve this year with a group of friends. We checked into the hotel early on the 31st having made our reservation online over the christmas break where we got a great rate which included breakfast. Our rooms were ready on arrival which was great.

Once checked in we had a short stroll back out onto grafton street where we took a walk through the shops the location really is excellent. I recommend a visit to Keoghs pub its on south anne st. near the hotel, it was a great end to an afternoon of shopping!!

We managed to get a table for dinner in Cafe Novo the bar and restaurant on the ground floor of the hotel, the food was excellent, once we had finished our meal we decided to move out to the bar area where we stayed to ring in the new year, the atmosphere was great.

The staff throughout the hotel were superb and the attention to detail was second to none, in every area. 

We are all looking forward to our next visit to The Westbury..................",5,2010,01,14
203,A belated review of our amazing experience at The Westbury.,"We had our Wedding Reception at The Westbury Hotel in Aug 09. From the initial meetings to the last minute details and implementation the service and experience was flawless. 
From storing our wedding flowers overnight to arranging for extra furniture to be available for hair and make up artists, no request was too much. The food was also exceptional.

All our guests complimented the hotel to us for the professional and friendly service, many of whom stayed for several days and were made feel at home. We have stayed in many 5star hotels in various countries and The Westbury can easily hold its own. All the staff are friendly and helpful, the hotel itself is beautiful with modern rooms and facilities set in a old world/classic style. All of our expectations were met and exceeded ‚Äì no request made of the Hotel was too much, which helped a lot when planning a wedding.

We can not recommend the Hotel enough whether just for an occasional stay or as a venue for that special occasion. We have stayed at the hotel many times before and since our wedding and the standard is always top class.

We would like to give a special mention to Russell, Catherine, Jonathan, Val, Joe and all the other wonderful staff.

Our wedding reception would not have been the same in any other hotel.",5,2010,01,05
203,Splendid!,"We stayed in the Westbury to celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary after a slightly disappointing stay in the Shelbourne last year on our 20th and I must say that everything about our stay was simply splendid!

Hats off to Glen Valentine the GM because he really went out of his way to ensure we had a memorable stay. The mere mention of our anniversary secured an upgarde to a suite which was possibly the best room we've ever stayed in. We have stayed in similar accomadation in Vegas but this room was more stylish, suprebly furnished with exquisite bedding. We hardly left the room to be honest!

Afternoon Tea in the Westbury is something of an institution among well heeled Dubliners escpcially at Christmas time when shoppers throng the place but once again Glen came up trumps and guaranteed our table at very short notice. Tea is served in the highly relaxing foyer looking out over Grafton Street. Service was impeccable and the food was delicous. As our waiter suggested one serving was more that sufficent for both of us and when we couldn't finish the strawberrys dipped in chocolate we had them sent to our room for later consumption! We had room service for dinner, both of us opting for Fillet Steak which was excellent. 

Service in this hotel puts it's competitors to shame. We originally intended to try a different 5 star hotel for our anniversary each year and so far we've stayed in the Merrion and the Shelbourne which we're both nice but no where near the same standard as the Westbury. We will defintely staye here again, and again!

Thanks to Glenn and all your team - you're superb!",5,2009,12,29
203,A Magical experience,"I stayed here last week and from the second we pulled up at the front door it was a wonderful experience.
The ambience in this hotel has to be seen to believed, which the festive season only enhanced.
The rooms are beautiful, spacious and spotlessly clean.
We had dinner in the restaurant the food was fabulous and the menu was a welcome change to your usual boring hotel menu.
Ideal location for shopping in the centre of everything 
We will definitely be back

203,Best Hotel in Dublin,"I just can't say enough about this Hotel. It deserves the five star rating it has achieved. Myself and some friends stayed there when we went on a shopping trip to Dublin for the weekend.  We ate in the restaurant there which was delicous, and the staff were so helpful and extremely friendly. It is very well located just off Grafton Street and you are surrounded by great restaurants, pubs and threatres....you are right in the heart of the buzz of Dublin and its so reasonably priced for the 5 star service you receive. I would highly reccommend this hotel to anyone who is taking a city break in Dublin.  Everything- and i mean everything, is right on your doorstep!! 
i would place this hotel as one of my top ten places to stay either at home or abroad... simply terrific!!!

203,A five star hotel with the mind of a 6 !,"My sisters and I visit the westbury every year in november to soak up the christmas atmosphere of dublin city.  Every year we are surprised and delighted by the hotel staff and the atmosphere of the hotel itself.  This year was no different, Mark met us on arrival and had our rooms ready even though it was early in the day, we were met by the wafting scent  of mulled wine which they were serving in the lounge.  The elegance of the staff and hotel itself is first class.  The staff in cafe novo were attentive and un-obtrusive and the food was simply delicious.  My tip ... try one of their cocktails before dinner , very enjoyable ! After dinner we relaxed in the lounge by a large open fire, it was just heavenely.  In a time when everyone is feeling the effects of the reccession! it is so nice to visit somewhere, where you can leave it all behind and enjoy a little opulance.  On check out Geraldine on reception was extremely helpful with arranging our return trip for all the family in january, we didn't get to the shops in november as we got totally emersed in the westbury and frankly had no need to leave the warmth of the hotel.  The rooms were well appointed and luxurious and i have to say well done to all the staff of the Westbury Hotel, they know how to look after their guests.    I look forward to returning in January and hopefully will get to shop this time !!",5,2009,12,19
203,Simply the Best,"The staff from front of house to everywhere else was just amazing, i cannot say enough about them, they just made our stay perfect in every way. Where else would you stay in dublin only at the westbury, top class in every way, if carslberg made hotels it would mould them from the Westbury.",5,2009,12,18
203,Pure luxury,"This hotel is perfectly situated (if arriving by taxi) and absolutely gorgeous, with friendly and helpful staff at every turn, whether you are there for afternoon tea or swinging through the lobby, shopping bags in hand, the hotel has something for everyone. Our room was looking on to Grafton St and was very well appointed, clean and tastefully decorated!! The perfect hotel for a romantic weekend.",5,2009,12,17
203,A fantastic experience in the heart of Dublin,I recently stayed in the Westbury Hotel in Dublin for the first time.  It was an excellent experience from start to finish.  The attention to detail and high quality of service were replicated throughout all areas of the hotel.  The room was very comfortable with excellent facilities in-room available.  The food in the hotel was excellent and the proximity to the centre of Dublin was second to none.  You could be in the social heart of Dublin (and more importantly back in your room!) within two minutes.  The breakfast was also of a very high standard.  I suppose the best you can say about a hotel is that I would recommend it in a flash - and I will return.,5,2009,12,14
203,"Great accommodation, helpful staff, unfortunate afternoon tea experience!","Arrived at Westbury for a short break with my daughter and doorman immediately took our bags to reception.  Consierge was most courteous and attentive and our room was first class.  Location couldn`t be better, close to all amenities but we didn`t experience a noise problem.  Our only disappointment was that we had booked afternoon tea for 3.30pm as a treat.  Unfortunately, as the staff were running late, we were asked to wait in the bar until called.  At 4.30pm we asked a waitress to check on things and were finally ushered to our seats at 4.45pm.  Our tea arrived at 5pm and, although we couldn`t complain about the quality, its late arrival put a damper on our first afternoon at the hotel.  Apart from this, our stay at the Westbury was very enjoyable and we would stay there again.",5,2009,12,12
203,Exceeded Expectations,"Recently traveled through Ireland visiting relatives and had the distinct pleasure of spending a night at The Westbury in Dublin.  I cannot possibly say enough good things about my stay.  Glenn Valentine and his entire staff made me feel like a rock star.  They were extremely pleasant, helpful and created an experience one usually dreams about.

Any future trips to Dublin will find me staying at The Westbury.  Thank you Glenn & Staff, it was brilliant!

203,The Westbury hotel is one of the last of the true luxurious hotels,"While on a recent business trip to Dublin, I stayed in the Westbury Hotel and I found it to be excellent. After a long day of meetings, I arrived back to the hotel in the early evening. The foyer, unlike many hotels at the moment, was nicely buzzy and lively. After checking in I went to my room - one of the suites on the sixth floor, which although a little more expensive than the standard was absolute luxury! The room included all the usual mod cons yet it was warm and comfortable with a spectacular view of the cityscape. There was plenty of room in the both the bed and bathroom. The bathroom had a huge bath complete with TV so I could catch up on the days events while unwinding in the tub. 

 

Later that evening, I met up with a colleague in the hotel restaurant, 'Wilde' for dinner. My colleague who is based in Dublin was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and atmosphere in the restaurant. The great thing about Wilde is that it feels like a serious restaurant rather than the obligatory hotel eatery. The food was wonderful with a great selection to choose from and the staff were attentive without being overbearing. 

 

The breakfast was one of the best hotel breakfasts I have had in a quite a while. There was a good selection of breads, cereals, juices, etc to choose from, but the cooked breakfast was definitely the highlight! Everything was very fresh, tasty and best of all - hot! The sausages and eggs were delicious. 

 

The Westbury hotel is one of the last of the true luxurious hotels left in the city and I will definitely be back!",5,2009,12,05
203,Genuine staff and first class service,"After a point cushions can't be much more comfortable, beds any bigger or rooms any cleaner. What sets the Westbury apart from its Dublin competitors is the standard of service. On arrival our group was met by two managers who offered us a light breakfast and hot towels. After a tour of the hotel and a look at the range of rooms available, we were each given our room keys and left to find our rooms. The room was was a great size and was not filled by the King size bed or the other furniture. An LCD TV, three telephones and super-fast wireless internet are complemented by tasteful, traditional decoration. The bathroom was also a good size and, like the the main living area, was spotlessly clean. Being brought a selection of cupcakes shortly after arriving was a nice touch as was the turn down service in the evening. The maid even brought me a wash bag as I had forgotten mine. The buffet breakfast was excellent as was the service in the restaurant though the selection of items could have been better. The iron and board were nice thoughts which proved to be useful. Overall it's hard to fault the hotel but if pushed, a free bottle of mineral water in the room would have been appreciated because what came out of the tap was undrinkable though hardly the fault of the Westbury. The Nespresso machine more than made up for that. An excellent hotel in a great location - not fun, but serious quality.",4,2009,12,02
203,Excellent Hotel Definitely stay again,"My partner and I stayed in The Westbury with our small baby. We really enjoyed our stay here immensly. The staff were brilliant and very helpful. We dealt with the manager Mark Dunne while we were there he was very approachable and made sure all of our needs were taken care of. The food was beautiful, we really enjoyed the breakfast. Great location right in the centre of Dublin so great for shopping.",5,2009,12,01
203,Excellent Hotel,"I recent stayed at this hotel with 3 friends, The room was beautiful, staff were exceptional, Food wonderful, Fab location -  honestly there is nothing bad I could say about this hotel, and I will def be back for a stay or 2 next year...
Keep up the good work Westbury!!!!",5,2009,11,30
203,A Rescued Visit,"My husband and I visited Dublin for a quick overnight stay and decided to pamper ourselves at this hotel after seeing such good reviews online. Unfortunately, there was a mix up with our room, and we ended up in smaller room than promised. Upon contact with reception, who were very helpful, the assistant manager immediately promised us an upgrade to a suite later that afternoon. We felt they handled the situation extremely well and went off to do some touring.

When we came back after a wander to move into our suite, we were moved to a larger room--the type of room we had expected in the first place--but not a suite and nothing was mentioned about the upgrade not being a suite. Both our old room and this new room lacked basic finishing touches you would expect from a 5 star hotel like coffee cups, even though there was a Nespresso machine and a tea kettle waiting to be used. Apparently they had given the suite to someone else, so we were a bit disappointed/confused. 

Later that evening we had a call and visit from the manager, Joseph,  who was very nice and accommodating, but obviously there wasn't anything he could do to fulfill the previous promise of a suite, but he did send up champagne and chocolates and actually reduced our bill at check-out. If not for his attentiveness and service, this would have been a one or two star review. 

We were staying just for one night and trying to do Dublin in that time, less hassle was what we were looking for, but the room mix up took a while to sort out, and obviously cut into our weekend. 

When you book a five star hotel, you expect great service and attention to detail from the start, not after a lengthy process. It is a shame that Joseph, the manager, wasn't there from the start to help us, but we still thank you for rescuing what could have been a disaster weekend.

Overall, the rooms are very nice, the location is fantastic, and the breakfast is good, but certainly not worth the 29 Euro/person!

Have the guiness and beef stew in a bread bowl from Naked (near the Tourist Info building) !",4,2009,11,25
203,Great Location - Superb Facility & Service,"This is a very late review of a superb accommodation we stayed in during our Ireland Tour in July 2008. We booked a private chauffeur tour of Ireland with Hammond Tours. John Hammond promised me that this would be a great location to begin our trip. With the disparity in ages...80 yrs. down to a couple in their early 20s. Travelers were myself, my parents, and my married daughter and her husband.
Our rooms were lovely, clean, and well appointed. The afternoon tea was a hit with my daughter, myself, and my mother attending. Breakfast was plentiful, and included in the price we arranged with Hammond Tours for our stay.
The location was awesome for walking along to Trinity College and the Book of Kells. We had a lovely tour around Dublin with our driver/guide, Tom Costello, hitting all of the highlights of Dublin before we headed off North to Belfast on Marching Day.",5,2009,11,21
203,Dublin City Centre Luxury,"Stayed here for two nights in October 2009, great location just off Grafton Street. Room was top class as was the breakfast. Didn't have dinner here as plenty of excellent restaurants in walking distance. We ate at The Pigs Ear & The Mermaid Cafe - both recommended. Hotel staff were very pleasant and attentive at all times. We had an added bonus in our package as it included afternoon tea which was amazing!

Would definately stay here again.",5,2009,11,17
203,I would Definitely stay again!,"Great Hotel!

So close to shopping for my wife!
Beautiful hotle with all the amenities.
I moved from the Shelbourne to the Westbury during my stay and never regretted it!
Chris",5,2009,11,16
203,Fabulous Hotel,"Delighted we picked the Westbury. Was a little concerned with the location and thought it might be noisy but no problems. When we arrived they had lost the reservation but upgraded us to a suite as an apology. How bad :)
Location could not be bettered for day and night activities. Rooms fabulous. Hotel public areas were excellent and service fantastic. Thoroughly enjoyable stay.
Would definitely stay there again if in Dublin.",5,2009,11,11
203,Exceptional staff,"Congratulations for hiring superb staff.  The hotel is beautiful, comfortable and offers every luxurious amenity.  However, the exceptional staff are what makes it stand out.  Joseph is one manager in particular that must be mentioned.  He was there day and night and NOTHING was too much trouble.  Always so professional and helpful.
A few other names that must be mentioned are: Megan, a gorgeous, smart, always smiling and professional girl in the Lounge, as were Beatriz and Aaron.  Hard to imagine in 2009 that a Hotel should be so fortunate to have such wonderful staff.  Cafe Novo also had lovely staff and always very pleasant.
Congratulations for having made our few days so memorable.",5,2009,11,08
203,Excellent Service at the Westbury,"I recently stayed at the Westbury which is definitely the best located hotel in Dublin. From the minute I stepped out of the taxi I was met by a very friendly door-man who took my case and apologised for the weather! My check in was swift and I soon found myself in a gorgeous room with a good bathroom. In the drawing room I was waited on by a friendly member of staff. As the hotel is within ""seconds"" of the main shopping area of Dublin (Grafton street), I found it quite luxurious being able to pop out to the shops for some fun and then retire to my lovely hotel again. 

My only  recommendation would be that they keep the bar open for ""guests"" instead of asking them to take their late night drinks in the drawing room. I was also disappointed to discover that their fun cocktail bar ""Cafe Novo"" closes at 11pm except for the weekends. My party of friends arrived on a Thursday so we would have liked to have stayed in this fun, young peoples'  Bar rather than go to the ""quiet"" drawing room.

We were very impressed that the hotel was doing a very good deal on dinner in their ""Wild Restaurant"". It was actually better value than going out to eat.",5,2009,11,07
203,Excellent end to a wonderful trip of Ireland,"Our group of 24 was made up of travel agents and their spouses touring throughout Ireland.  The hotel location was perfect and in heart of the Dublin.  The pubs, nightlife, sights, and upscale shopping were all within walking distance.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  The snacks in our room were a very nice touch along with being delicious.  The rooms were not overly large but were beautiful and had everything you could possibly need.   The staff were outstanding throughout our stay.  Thank you for an excellent end to a wonderful trip to Ireland!",5,2009,11,03
203,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"Tucked away in a corner off Grafton Street, the Westbury offers a beautiful stay in Dublin in walking distance to several sites. For any woman who loves a sparkley, this lobby is for you! The staff was efficient and friendly. We used the conceirge both nights to help us find & book dinner reservations. Both restaurants they sent us to we're fantastic and exactly what we were expecting. 

The rooms were spacious and the bed was super comfy. The bathroom was done beautifully with marble and dark woods. I loved the fact they provided separate conditioner, which my tresses desparately needed. 

They offer a light complimentary breakfast of pastries, fruit, coffee & tea in the mornings which was nice. 

You're right off one of the main shopping streets, right by St. Stephen's Green, walking distance to St. Patrick's Cathedral, Christ Church, Dublin Castle, & Temple Bar District. There is also a cab stand right out front of the hotel.",5,2009,10,23
203,Excellent Experience,"Had a fantastic time, rooms were lovely, breakfast amazing and the staff were fantastic!",5,2009,10,23
203,The Perfect Sleepover in Dublin,"The service was exceptional , from  check in to check out, both of us were made to feel special and that our stay at the Westbury was important to all, treated liked  proper guests,  the word I would use was effortless. Arriving into the room, even the temperature was perfect: the room decor was very tasteful, and the bed was so comfortable... when you travel as a couple, expectations of a room differ, for men its the TV for women its the cleanliness/  a robe/ hangers/ towels and this room raised no arguments, that in itself was a 1st.  As the Westbury is so central you get to enjoy the city throughout the day by foot , and I love the fact you can leave the busy Grafton street and walk into the hotel  within 5 minutes. The best located hotel in Dublin that relies on service as their differential.",5,2009,10,22
203,"Elegant, central beautiful hotel","We stayed at the Westbury last week and from the moment we arrived we were made feel welcome by the lovely professional staff. The hotel is a modern build which for us is not ideal as we tend to prefer old-world places BUT I must say they have really achieved the best of both old and new in this hotel! The bedroom was fabulous with a contemporary 4 poster bed and fantastic views. The lobby has an old fashioned feel to it but in a good way. They serve formal afternoon teas aswell as casual coffees etc here and we certainly enjoyed lounging about during our stay.
I have to say that Russell the manager was extremely helpful when we couldn't book our plane tickets on line and not only did he do EVERYTHING for us but also had the boarding passes sent to our room while we packed up our things. Details like this are what make a good establishment great!
We hope to return before the holiday season but if not, we will definitely be staying here again when in Dublin.",5,2009,10,16
203,""" Amazing Location, Service impeccable, Beautiful Rooms & Did I mention Breakfast ""","I stayed at The Westbury on Friday 18th September for the Weekend, there was an amazing buzz in the place when I checked in ( A big Charity Event was been held that day) , I knew we were in the right place when I saw the Glamour and a lot of famous faces around the Hotel .....

We checked in and the front of house staff were very friendly and offered us Hot cloths on check in ...all was seamless and pleasant considering they had so many people to check in ..... 

The Room was beautiful overlooking the front of Hotel and Aqua Di Parma products in the bathroom .... , I am very fussy when it comes to Hotels and I have to say that the room was spotless beautifully maintained .....

The location of Hotel is almost on Grafton Street so we had some retail Therapy before having lunch in Cafe Novo downstairs ... The food was really good & the staff very pleasant without been intrusive ......

An afternoon rest was in order and the bed was really comfortable .......

we decided to have Dinner that night at their ""Wilde"" restaurant as it had been recommended in a lot of publications we had read ....... We were not dissapointed ....

We had Salmon for starter, Fillet Beef for mains and all was really good .... their Portobello Mushrooms they serve with Steak are the BEST !!! 

Freshly made hot breads served to the table , lovely Wine list and a great Cheeseboard to finish off ...... All was served with a smile ......

Bedtime and I had reservations about how quiet the hotel would be seen as it is beside one of Dublin's main Shopping/Bars/Clubs area .......

Could not hear a thing & slept really well .....

BREAKFAST ! I was pleasantly surprise that they serve breakfast in the ""Wilde"" restaurant on a Buffet style with huge selection of breads , foods , Fruit & Juices .... I ordered Poached Eggs and they were delicious .... 

I would Highly recommend this Hotel for Value ,Service & overall presentation ! Five star  at Four Star prices ... Really good value .....

203,Wow- the perfect Dublin overnight,"My husband and I stayed at the Westbury for just one night to celebrate our wedding anniversary. I stayed there before the refurbishment a couple of times and always felt that it is the best located hotel in Dublin with fantastic public areas and the rooms were ""fine"". This time we were in the newly refurbished room and wow. This is now without a doubt THE perfect place to stay in Dublin. The new rooms have really calming luxurious decor, nespresso machines for great in room coffee and are what you would expect in a top end 5 star Hotel. All of the staff were unbelievably helpful, hot towels on arrival, suggesting things to do and were generally warm and friendly. We could have sat for hours reading the Sunday papers and soaking up the atmosphere in the lobby area. My only complaint is that one night was definitely not enough. I really didn't want to leave!",5,2009,10,05
203,One word - Special,"I stayed in the Westbury on the 1st of October. It was the perfect place for me to propose to my girlfriend. The staff helped a great deal in making it a truly memorial occaision (thank you so much Joseph). The room was perfect. A surprise bottle of wine was left in the room, champagne delivered to celebrate the special moment and the room beautifully prepared wiht rose petals, desserts etc. on our arrival back after dinner and drinks. The staff were friendly and very helpful. we enjoyed our delicious breakfast looking out at the bustle of Grafton Street. A truly special stay!!",5,2009,10,03
203,Excellent Hotel. Excellent Location. The Perfect Hotel.,"What more can I say, from the moment we arrived until we checked out every aspect of our stay was perfect. Ideal for a romantic getaway and close to great pubs, restaurants and of course the best shopping in Dublin on your doorstep.",5,2009,09,26
203,"Amazing , Amazing!","I recently stayed in the Westbury as part of a group (hens) of 10, on arrival, first impressions were wow! the hotel was situated bang in the middle of the shopping district, I was a little worried that 10 ladies might get a few snears but no,  from check in to check out our stay was second to none.  The reception staff, consierge, porters, cleaning staff, waiting staff were all polite, friendly and very helpful, from turning back bed sheets to taking various photos, nothing was too much trouble.   The rooms were very spacious and luxurious, breakfast was also amazing - we had a buffet breakfast on the first day and full breakfast on the Sunday..  I would definitely stay again.",5,2009,09,25
203,"The staff, ambience and location of the Westbury are wonderful.","We were in a suite and loved it.  The complimentary breakfast served in the main room was lovely and very English in its setting.  The location is excellent for restaurants and sightseeing.  This hotel was recommended to us by a friend, and we could not have been happier with our selection.  We will absolutely return to the Westbury for another stay some time in the future.",5,2009,09,23
203,Fabulous hotel in central location,"Worth spoiling yourself to stay in  this stylish  establishment with beautiful lounge area filled with sparkling chandeliers.  On arrival the concierge took us through the switches and equipment in our room and  could not have been friendlier or more helpful.  Our booking didn't include breakfast so found plenty of breakfast cafes nearby.  Especially liked the Powerscourt Shopping Centre cafe which was excellent and well priced. 
Rooms are priced at the expensive end but hotel offers quality and comfort.  The standard room is roomy enough to include 2 lounge chairs with table plus a good size desk and chair.  Free wifi available.  Glamorous marble bathroom with lots of mirrors.  Evening bed turn-down with chocolate.  Would be very happy to visit again.",5,2009,09,23
203,Lobby come  conference  centre,My office  is  based  in sandyford  so when  I have to entertain clients  or advise  of  a  city centre  location I always need somewhere  central in dublin City. I've  recently started using the westbury Hotel in Dublin. My clients  find  the  rooms perfect  for the  overnight  business trip and I personally think the  city centre location is a perfect meeting  venue. The Lobby has wireless internet so its  great  for cathing  up on emails or conducting a  brief meeting. Staff are coutreous and if I could  reccommend one thing about  the  hotel it would  have to be  their cappacinos!,5,2009,09,23
203,"Need to check all aspects of rooms, not just fine detail","I stayed recently at this lovely hotel. It is on our company's prefered list, and we have many  staff members that use this hotel. Location is great once you are there, but travelling by hire car is tricky. 
Room was a let down, as above the shower head was lots of brown splats of something that resembled coffee. So much so that I did not want to use the shower, and had to face the staring up at the ceiling whilst in the bath..
The in room coffee maker did not work properly, and after a lond day early start was a complete let down..I had no idea how to change the water for fresh water, and how long it had been sitting there...The switch was faulty on the machine, so I had to have several attemps to get to work. 
On the plus side the bed was really comfy, and I had a lovely nights sleep.
I am over in Dublin next week, but have booked my buisness trip in a nearby hotel.",3,2009,09,22
203,"Great location, friendly staff, a 5 star experience!","We spent one night at the Westbury, over a weekend in August and had a truly memorable stay! 

You simply cannot beat the location if you're visiting Dublin city as it is a stones throw away from the main shopping thoroughfare (Grafton street) as well as numerous bars and restaurants.

We were impressed by the staff throughout the hotel, who were friendly and professional at all times. Our newly refurbished room was spacious and immaculately clean. There is also the added bonus of the rooms being well insulated, with blackout curtains for the ultimate good night's sleep!

We had dinner at the hotel's Cafe Novo restaurant, which had a relaxed family-friendly atmosphere, and their menu catered for all tastes and appetites... definitely a good alternative to eating out in the city.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin city.",5,2009,09,18
203,Plush and  Pricey,"Stayed  at The Westbury last month. I had last stayed  there  3 years ago and back then it  needed a bit of an upgrade. I was delighted that on this occasion  the hotel has had  a complete make  over. Rooms are spacious beds extremely  comfortable with incredibly large plasma screen tv's. Location in the  centre of the Dublin was great and service  throughout  was 5 star all the way. Only criticism is that  it is pricey particularly when compared to similar hotels in the city,but in saying  that you do get the  extras for your money.",5,2009,09,17
203,An island of sublime elegance,"Just back from our stay at this truely stunning hotel which has the best location one could ask for. It's literally smack bang in the centre of Dublin's sophisticated shopping district and we loved the area right behind the hotel which is full of fantastic shops, restaurants and has a BoHo feel to it.
Our room was georgeous and it even had an original work of art which my partner said was  by a really important contemporary artist! 
We ate in the cafe on the ground floor which is really excellent and the staff were really friendly especially the blond girl(whose name we can't recall) but THANK YOU.
The lobby or Gallery serves coffee and afternoon tea amid really elegant surroundings - more amazing works of art here and silk couches. We had the afternoon tea which was served with Gallic precision and real charm by the French manager whose name is Fannie and deserves to be commended. I loved the silverware and the little cakes.
We did not eat in the main restaurant as we were dining out with friends who had invited us to the Trocadero which is lovely but I'm kinda sorry we didn't try it. May be next time.
All in all the hotel is very elegant and stylish and the staff really make you feel welcome which is more than can be said for some other establishments of a similar rating! 
THANK YOU for a lovely experience and I hope to be back.",5,2009,09,15
203,"Nice hotel, just a few touches let the stay down.","Stopped at the hotel for a night whilst we went to see Coldplay at Phoenix Park. When we checked in we weren't told details for breakfast, where to go what time etc. The room was nice and had the nice touches you would expect to pay for a 5 star hotel. What did let it down was the constant noise of the room next door whenever they used their bathroom, as it set off their fan! The water pressure in the shower kept stopping mid flow, and then came back cold!

Overall, the hotel is lovely and the staff are helpful, it was just a shame that a couple of things  let the overall experience down.",4,2009,09,15
203,Girls Luxurious Night Away,"Have often wanted to stay in the infamous Westbury hotel but never got around to. While planning a girls night away, spotted the 'Shawshank Redemption Package' and loved the sound of it, plus the affordable price so decided to take a gamble.
Was not disappointed. There were 5 of us, in 3 rooms. Upon arrival got a warm welcome from reception staff. Our rooms weren't ready as had requested beside each other and on a high floor with view. It was 1 o'clock so that was fair enough. Were offered alternatives away from each other but as was special occasion so was directed to their new 'Cafe Novo' where we decided to have some lunch.  The waiter was very friendly and told us about the show in the Gaiety that we were giong to that night which sounded very exciteing. The receptionist then came over to us and apologised for the delay and said that for the inconvenience she had upgraded us to 'Business class rooms' and that our luggage was upstairs waiting for us!! We were escorted up to our room and entered 3 very plush business class rooms decorated in a warm red and cream decor. The view was spectacular also.
After getting ready we ventured back down to the bar to start our evening out. While sipping on the 'Baileys Milkshake' and watching the world go by, we felt like we had stepped into an episode of Sex & the City! Ladies - these are a must have!
Had a great evening out and came back to the hotel to be greeted by a dimly lit room with our beds turned down and slippers waiting for our weary feet!
What more could a lady out on the town ask for!!
Already planning our next getaway trip at the Westbury!",5,2009,09,09
203,Perfect,"The title is how i would describe our stay from check in to check out!

For the past 6 years we have made regular bi monthy trips to Dublin for long weekends. Our usual haunts have been The Merrion, The Morrison, The Fitzwillam and The Westin. For some reason, never The Westbury......a big mistake on our part!

From the moment you walk through the door this property exudes class and substance, you just know you are going to be staying in a true 5* establishment. The public areas, reception, rooms and staff are as you would want them to be....impecable!

All i can say is that from check in to check out our delight at staying in this hotel grew. This hotel is our new Dublin home and i'm more than happy to answer any questions fellow travellers may have.

203,concert break,"While attending a concert in Dublin recently,  my friend and I stayed at your hotel.  We booked the hotel by phone and availed of the special offer of a very reasonable  B/B rate which included a  ‚Ç¨25 voucher to be spent against food or drink in the hotel. We found the lady on reception to be extremely helpful, professional and informative without being O.T.T  The rooms were well laid out and very comfortable with all mod cons you would need.  We availed of the dinner offer in the Wilde restaurant that night which was excellent value at 25.00 for a 2 course meal or 30 for 3 courses. 
We had breakfast the next morning but I was a little disappointed. For  a 5* hotel, it offered a very small and unexciting  selection of cold cuts, cheeses, fruit, cereal and breads etc. and while the cooked breakfast was adequate it was nothing out of the ordinary.  As far as hotel breakfasts go, it is very hard to beat the radisson group (and I have stayed in a lot of hotels overy my lifetime) 
The hotel is very central for sightseeing, shopping and socialising with a number of good pubs and restaurants in the area.  One other con was that I found the price of drink in the hotel exorbitant - I mean 11.25 for a glass of pinot grigio even by 5* standards that is very very expensive.
However, overall I really enjoyed my stay and would have no problem recommending to a friend or colleague and I would return again if there were good offers to be availed off.",4,2009,09,01
203,"Great Location, Small Rooms","I stayed at the Westbury for the weekend, and we weren't impressed when they put us in a room directly across from the elevator. It was small, dark and noisy. We asked to be moved, and they did move us without any trouble - to a much nicer room (still small) on an upper floor. It was a massive improvement. The rooms are comfortable. The location is great - right in the middle of everything, with Grafton Street right outside the door. That is really the most compelling reason to stay here.",4,2009,08,29
203,I LOVE COMPLAINING BUT WASN'T ABLE TO DO SO AT THIS HOTEL!,"As we were about to enter the hotel the concierge immediately took our bags and directed us to the reception area to check in.  We were then greeted by an extremely friendly male receptionist who wasn't snotty, condescending or made us feel as though we weren't good enough to stay in this luxurious hotel, unlike some other 5 star establishments I won't mention!  As we were checking in, another female receptionist handed us some hot towels to freshen up which were extremely welcome after travelling.  We were shown to our rooms, (by yet another friendly concierge who was so friendly and down-to-earth), which were so beautiful and most importantly very, very clean.  Acqua di Parma toiletries greeted us in the bathroom and a flatscreen tv sat on the wall, which was still audible even when showering!  The location is absolutely fabulous and the hotel had an evening room service whereby slippers are placed on your bed, a sumptious Butlers chocolate is placed on your pillow and the lamps in the bedroom are dimmed.  The staff couldn't do enough to ensure that our stay was perfect and when we checked out we were really sad to be leaving.  We all agreed that the next time we travel to Dublin we couldn't stay anywhere else but the Westbury and will definitely be visiting again very soon.  The staff are an absolute credit to this hotel and I would have no hesitation in recommending the Westbury to anyone.",5,2009,08,23
203,The Leading Hotels of the World! (09LHW06) Our 3/4/5 star all-in-one hotel experience!,"We stayed during the August 2009 Bank Holiday at this hotel in the heart of Dublin. The Location indeed could not be better at all because of the easy access to shopping incl. Grafton Street which is Ireland' s no. one shopping destination direct on our doorstep of the hotel plus access to the Trinity College, St. Stephen' s Green Park ( the largest inner City Park in Europe! ) and many different cultural highlights incl. The National Gallery of Ireland - within 5 min. walking and the Temple Bar District within 10 to 15 minutes strolling distance of the hotel. This location is pure 5 star. We were hush in the entrance and step-up to the reception desk beside the Gallery Lounge and the busy concierge for our check-in where we had to wait 1 hour for our room to be ready which was suppossed to be an upgrade but after 1 hour was over we had gotten to our room which was only the same category we had booked anyway! What upgrade? It was room no. 203 on the second floor of the hotel with a backstreet view out of the hotel into some other houses and shops. During the 1 hour wait we had been here at the Westbury to lunch in the brand new Cafe Novo and Brasserie which we very much enjoyed beside the luke warm service and non-existing irish smiles we received. The cafe is located on the ground floor of the hotel and had also a street entrance without going into the hotel proper. We enjoyed here incl. one duck chorizo salad, one chicken avocado wrap, one roibush vanilla tea by Ronnefeldt, one coco chanel cocktail, one immunizer mocktail plus one toffee walnut ice-cream and one black forrest sundae plus one beautiful baileys and valrhona chocolate milkshake - all judged wonderful at this hotel in terms of quality, size and presentation at a cost of around 60 Euro - which we considered very good value and of 5 star quality - however the service which was only doing it' s job without personality and smiles we would give just so 4 stars. After this we were back to our room no. 203 - the non happening upgrade remember? OK, Folks in the room we found the following and sometimes flawed items and design incl. like the rest of the hotel - which celebrated not so long ago 25 years of service and is a member of the Leading Hotels of the World - our room was completely renovated to a new so-called 21st century standard incl. large LCD TV by Philips ( RTE Ireland, Sky Sports, Bloomberg TV, Disney Channel and Pay TV for 15.90 Euro per movie had been the highlights here on offer ), the tv was large and brand new but the remote control to the TV - which came not from Philips - was not very new and scratched plus it was not very well working - very hard to change channels with this thing! ( Questioning this at the lobby the lady said - some employees simply changing the remote controls around the rooms and she is sorry when this one was not working very well! ) Is this Leading? The colours of the room interior were mostly in creme soft colours and splashes of red incl red upholstered chair, red flowers on the pillows and red lampshades on the night stands. We had a queen-sized bed ( this was the same we had booked at the hotel via the Leading Hotels of the World Web-page - We are also Leaders Club Members - and had earlier stayed at the LHW Marina Mandarin Singapore - see our review from our stay there in July 2009 ) so this could not have been an upgrade here at the Westbury! We also requested an higher floor and we stayed at the second - lowest - floor in the hotel! Also they should learn how to delight and surprise the guests they have because the lady on check-in asked us bluntly what we wanted on our room as a gift incl. wine, fruit or chocolate, and we decided we take the chocolate offer for room surprise - which was now out, Folks! This was promptly delivered without any smiles or friendlieness as well! ( This should have been done via e-mail invitation after our booking in private and should already waiting on our room after arrival and not just questioned and offered bluntly at the check-in - where is the delight effect in this, Folks! This is at the most 3 star service in delivery ( lobby ) this gift and 4 star service for the delivery of the chocolate to our room without smiles again? Where is the irish smile here? In this case most employees encountered were anyway polish and from other eastern european countries. OK back to our room, Folks! We had also incl. a large walk-in closet with 12 hangers on offer - which was mostly achieved because the bathroom had been made smaller on the other side of the room. We had also a fully stocked mini-bar with all snack and chocolate items missing in the Bar itself! There was also a coffee machine without any coffee or milk or even tea on offer and no sugar! The whole assortment which we would normally find in such high establishment' s was missing! This is not 5 star! By now we had been wondering had we been given secretly a downgrade? In fact this is one of only two reviewed Leading Hotel' s of the World member' s where we have stayed and written at Tripadvisor which does not achieve an overall 5 star rating the other one was the Kempinski Corvinus in Budapest ( see our review in our profile here at Tripadvisor! ). Another weak point was scored in the room because the air-conditioning was not very good working as well - even after lowering the temperature to it' s lowest point of 16C plus - it was still getting hotter! ( We had better in 3 star hotel' s like the Le Fenix Sukhumvit in Bangkok which costs less than 20% of the Westbury price per night, Folks! Once again see our review at Tripadvisor about this hotel! ) We also had a large writing desk  with excecutive chair - this was without wheels and was rather hard to move when changing position - for people who must work at this desk and using this chair this could be a hard slog! On the room we had also free water by Ballygowan of Ireland and some fresh strawberries as well. We missed the turn-down service because we put the do not disturb sign out for some privacy and we had in-room dining on our evening in early August 2009 incl. 2 freshly squeezed orange juices, 1 italian salad with green leafes, tomatoes and mozzarella, 1 roast vegetable and brie panini plus an assortment of healthy vegetable sticks with sour cream dip! Which was all rather yummy at cost of 50 Euros incl. Service and Tax. It is interesting to note that the public spaces and the food we enjoyed at our hotel - we are from Dublin and this was a Bank Holiday August 2009 treat - were all of 5 star quality but the room was more like 4 stars and overall the delivery of services and smiles plus the delight factor were more like 3 stars incl. the not very good airconditioning in our room. Overall when we would never have stayed here we would really not know about the flaws of this rather famous but not perfect 5 star Dublin City Hotel. Our bathroom was very nice but smaller thanks to the renovation of the room and offered a combined bath and shower set, oddly without a hand held shower despite being newly renovated - this we had ever found in 4 star or lower starred hotels -, the toilet, toilet paper x2, sink which was surrounded by older marble and came from before the renovation all other space in the bathroom had new tiling and marble - which we found also odd as they had saved here to really 100% renovate the room! The sink itself was fine but the tap for the water flow was too small - so to wash our hand' s and catch the water flow we would almost bang our finger on the sink! - Oddly enough this we had also encountered at the 4 star not recommended Impiana KLCC Hotel in Kuala Lumpur in July 2009 ( see our review in our profile! ). The bathroom amenities incl. 2 bathrobes, many towels ( which were not signature towels by the way ), one cap - despite being in double room and one vanity kit came from Gilchrist and Soames of London, Acqua di Parma Shampoo, Bodylotion and Bathgel and a small soap - in fact all the sizes with 40ml were too small for two people to use on two days! We recommend  the hotel should install a double set of the amenities or hand out simply a larger size of the amenities. ( Interesting to note we had met the sales representative of the Westbury Hotel in June 2009 at the Leading Hotels of the World presentation in the LHW Merrion Hotel Dublin in which she said the Westbury belongs to the Doyle Collection of Irish Hotels and we be better and better in due course because of changes taking place in the hotel and the Westbury is the only hotel in Ireland which is offering Acqua di Parma in the room' s and handed us sample sizes to take home with in a larger size of 75 ml for two! We thought these sizes we would also find in our bathroom! We were wrong we found only 40 ml single portion there! The Westbury is also the only 5 star hotel in the Doyle Collection of Irish hotel' s - one of us asked the question why Doyle does not operate more 5 star hotel' s in the world and the answer was she thought many other hotel' s in the collection should be five star hotel' s! Looking at the Westbury and this is a real awarded 5 star hotel we will doubt such a claim made - based on our experiences in many other 5 star hotel' s around the world incl. many member' s of the Leading Hotel' s  of the World! ). We also got an very adventerous wake up call incl. we need a taxi from a man on the phone who had spoken to another customer at the lobby while giving us our wake up call! This is how concerned they are in delivering personal service! How can that be!?! Our breakfast at the Wilde Restaurant which we separatly review on Tripadvior web-page under - Wilde Restaurant! See our profile when published later! On Monday noon our check-out came and went not very smooth with the machine for the credit card not functioning and she swiped again and again until she tried another one with one try our card was accepted and all was perfect again! This was all delivered in a hurried style and again there was nobody smiling not even our neighbour at check-out who had problems with the parking ticket and got also only blunt answers! As a whole to us the food and the public spaces were five stars, the non-existing smiles and our room were four stars and the unpersonal nature of service plus the airconditioning and our hard to use old remote control was only worth three stars, Folks! All in all this is one of the weaker Leading Hotels of the World where we had stayed in our years of travel so far! So do not forget to FLY!STAY!EXPLORE!MORE! and travel more with the sense of choosing a hotel with a true smile and welcome to it! ( The hotel has no Spa and only a very small fitness room - 4 basic machines and weights on the second floor ).",4,2009,08,22
203,Excellent Location!,"We stayed in the Westbury for 4 nights in August. The rooms are beautiful and the beds are very comfortable. The best part of this hotel is the location. Graffton St is lively and fun with shopping, pubs and restaurants. The staff was very nice and helped us with dinner reservations several times.",5,2009,08,22
203,Beautiful Hotel With Some Kinks,"Pros:  Beautiful room (we were upgraded to a business suite); fantastic bathroom amenities (Aqua Di Parma shampoo, spa towel rack, etc.); and very elegant lobby.  Compared to the hotels in which we stayed in Mayo and Kerry counties, this was a bargain!  It was also in a great location for sightseeing, restaurant-going, and shopping.

Cons:  Our room was less than perfect.  Our tea cups and tea pot had never been cleaned/emptied from the last guest.  Our U.S. outlet didn't work and it took them 1 day and a half to find us an adapter that worked. Mini-fridge didn't work.  Remote control didn't work.  The gym was tiny - not up to the calibur of US hotel gyms at this price.",3,2009,08,17
203,Excellent!,"Hello,

I stayed at the  Westbury for 5 nights in July. I enjoyed every moment. It was my second visit to this hotel. Bedrooms spacious. Most of the staff were friendly and courteous. Beds were very comfortable. Very convenient to Grafton St. and the beautiful Stephen's Green. 

The housekeeping left a lot to be desired. No clean cups, no morning newspaper as promised. No milk. No sugar. Had to ring housekeeping every evening to get these items. The Internet through TV did not work in the bedroom. 

 Apart from that it was just prefect!

We ended up staying an extra night and that was made possible by a member of staff whose name was Joseph (from Cork) He was extraordinary! He went out of his way to make sure that we got a room even though the hotel was nearly full due to U2 concert that particular weekend. He was an absolute pleasure to deal with and a credit to the Westbury Hotel. I would definitely stay again!

Kindest Regards

Gretta Keane",5,2009,08,11
203,Great Location - Wonderful Service.,"I stayed with my wife and 2 young kids (Age 2 & 3). Previously I stayed in the Fitzwillaim which was very good so wasn't sure if this was going to be as good - but it was !
The hotel location is spot on. The hospitality by the staff is brilliant. The great thing is that ALL the shops you need (e.g supermarkets) are walking distance, which is great if you have 2 young kids.
The only slight problem we had was electrics in the room went out for approx. 2 hours, but this was sorted out pretty quick , as we were offered another room if we wanted.
Comfortable beds and a KRUPS coffee machine is handy. We also had afternoon tea in the main gallery which is reasonably priced. A spa / swimming pool would be great considering it's a 5 star hotel .Apart from that, we would definitely come back again.",5,2009,08,10
203,A Fabulous Hotel I Know We Will Return to Visit,"Our entire experience  at the Westbury was almost perfect.  We were able to check in at 8 AM after our trans-Atlantic flight which was an unexpected  treat.  Our room was very generously sized, well appointed, and spotless.  The bed was very comfortable.  We had some trouble figuring out how the light switches worked and never quite got the hang of them, but we managed.  We were on the breakfast plan and had a wonderful choice of breakfast items.  However staff was a little to slow to offer coffee.  We had dinner one night at Wilde which was marvelous.  We ate off the prie fixe menu which was excellent.  The location just off Grafton Street is outstanding.  We walked to Kilmanhain Jail, Temple Bar, Trinity College, and even to Croke Park for the U2 concert.  The concierge staff were uniformly friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating.  I can't wait to return to this hotel!",5,2009,07,29
203,Fabulous Stay!,"We stayed at the Westbury Hotel for 4 nights in July and we loved our stay!  We booked directly with the hotel with a special - 4 nights for the price of 3.  We visited Ireland for our honeymoon and The Westbury Hotel exceeded our expectations.  We arrived early (around 9:30am) and our room was ready for us - which was great after a long night of travel.  

We loved our hotel room.  The size of the room was very roomy.  It was extremely clean and the bed was so comfortable.  The room service was excellent.  Our room was always cleaned immaculately and our beds were always turned down at night.

The staff at the hotel was awesome!  The concierge was always helpful and knowledgeable.  When we had questions about the area, they always answered with great information and maps to go along!  The front desk staff was friendly at check-in and check-out.  I found an error on my bill and they were quick to fix it with no problems.

The location of the hotel was perfect, as it was right off Grafton Street.  We felt safe going into our hotel late at night - the doorman was always there.  We were able to walk to shops, restaurants, and pubs.  We went to a concert at RDS and were able to walk back to the hotel at night.  (about 25 minute walk)

I loved this hotel and would definitely stay there if we visit Dublin again!",5,2009,07,29
203,expensive but lovely rooms,"This was expensive but found a deal on the internet so was Euro170 instead of rack rate of Euro 435 for single room. Really comfortable beds and large rooms including decent size bathroom  
Could clearly hear the noise for the outside bars which could be a problem if early or light sleeper. The fitness suite was a room converted and had basic equipment but adequate",4,2009,07,27
203,Great Stay and Perfect for Grafton Street,We booked the Westbury for one night before returning home after our stay in Galway also to go Shopping to Brown Thomas and other stores on Grafton Street. On arrival we where helped with our cases  into the lift and taken up to Reception. We where then given Hot Towels to freshen up. Check in was easy and quick. We then took the lift again which was operated via the Bell Boy. On arriving into our room it was very spacious and clean the bathroom was stocked with lovely Toiletries. The room had a minibar what was well stocked with plenty of variety as the Ice Machines where not working we rang to room service to get some they brought us up a large Ice bucket full very quickly. Of a night we went out and when we returned the Maids had got our beds ready for the night and left chocolates and slippers by the bed. The beds where extremely comfy and the pillows where just a bid too hard though. The Coffee Machine in the room didnt seem to work but  we were not to bothered as wee wanted Tea anyway. The Bathroom was small but practical and was nicely designed and luxurious. On departure from the hotel we where helped with our cases into the Taxi by the Assistant Manager. Overall a brilliant stay.,5,2009,07,24
203,"a fine hotel, excellent service, shame about the noisy disco behind","My husband and I recently spent one night at The Westbury. We chose it for its central location and 5* rating. A lovely mirrored entrance way, then you go upstairs to the check-in area. Check-in hardly took a minute. Very efficient, and our room was ready (it was only 9.30am). We took morning tea in the large seating area, which overlooked the front of the hotel, towards Grafton Street. The lifts to the room have a little bench seat...good for resting those tired shopped-out legs! We were in room 601. We had booked a superior queen, but instead were given a very large studio suite. On returning home, I checked the hotel website for theis type of room. It was mentioned, but no photos available and no price, so I'm not sure what it should have cost. The room was smart/contemporary. 4 poster bed, which was a dark wooden frame, but no swags and frills. Two very comfortable lounge chairs and stool to watch the tv. Lots of mirrored glass in the large bathroom. The only problem we had was with the toilet. You had to make sure you got up before flushing. This was because the flush was so violent, it sent water onto and over the seat onto the floor. We did find it quite amusing, however. We mentioned it at check out and the lady was most apologetic and asked if we wanted to speak to someone else about it. She had taken the complaint very seriously. However, I said I wasnt complaining, just mentioning that it may need to fixed before wetting the next lot of guests. The bed was large, but quite soft. Pillows. Two each, all very thick, but squished when you put your head on them, therefore folding around your face somewhat. The worst part was the room faced Clarendon Street and there was loud music from some nearby bar/disco until 2.15am. We enjoyed a drink in the Marble Bar. Low lighting and comfy settees/chairs made for a seductive drink. We didnt eat at the hotel, but I know the breakfast was about 30Euro per person",4,2009,07,23
203,Great hotel,"I booked this hotel to celebrate my husband's birthday.  We stayed for two days.  On arrival we were told that we had been upgraded to a superior room with a four poster bed.  The room was lovely, very large and very stylish.  The bed was kingsize with a memory foam mattress, very comfortable.  All the staff were very good, especially the reception staff.  We ate the first night in the hotel restaurant downstairs.  The food was great and the service.  This hotel is centrally located so great for visiting Dublin, it is right in the middle of the main shopping area.  There is lots to see and do in Dublin and we really enjoyed our weekend.
We did not book breakfeast in the hotel but discovered that Marks and Spencers had a roof garden restaurant and they did a full Irish breakfeast/ Eggs Benedict or pancakes and this was great value with a fabulous view over the city.
I would definitely stay at the Westbury again if I went back to Dublin.",5,2009,07,21
203,Perfect hotel for visiting Dubin,"The Westbury Hotel can be summed up with one word.  Perfect.  The location is perfect.  The staff is perfect.  The rooms are Perfect.  I cannot say enough for this hotel and for its general manager Glenn Valentine and his assistant Sinead O‚ÄôToole.  Upon arrival they had us upgraded to a suite.  Glenn and Sinead were extremely helpful and went out of their way to help us plan our first trip to Ireland with advice for dinning, entertainment, and nightlife. I knew from the get go that we picked the right hotel!

Our room and all of the common areas of the hotel were stunning.  We had plenty of space in our room, and it was very clean and comfortable.  After walking around everyday, it was nice to be able to come back to the hotel to relax in that huge bed.  It is really the small things that add up that make the rooms at the Westbury so nice.  The heated towel racks, the large windows letting in a ton of light, the wireless internet, the turndown service at night, and the d√©cor are just a few things that make the rooms at the Westbury so welcoming.

I also have to thank the cleaning staff who were very personable and always said hello with a huge smile whenever we walked by.  Its funny, I made a comment in passing about how good the chocolate was that they put in the room for turndown and the next night they had left us with what seemed like entire bag of chocolates.  Came in real handy for our flight back to the states!

The location of the Westbury Hotel cannot be any better in Dublin.  It is literally steps for all of the shopping districts, St. Stephens Green, hundreds of restaurants, and theatres.  It‚Äôs also a short walk to Temple Bar District (which is a must in Dublin), the Dublin Castle, and the Cathedral.  Although the Guinness Factory is a mile and a half away, it is actually a very nice walk.  

Without a doubt, I would recommend this hotel for anyone planning a trip to Dublin.  Like I said before, the Westbury Hotel is Perfect.  Should my wife and I ever have the opportunity to get back to Dublin, we will undoubtedly stay here again!  
Also, because I know management reads these comments, I must say thank you for putting together such a great staff at your hotel.  It truly is a difference maker to have so many kind and helpful people when visiting!",5,2009,07,21
203,All around excellence,"We stayed at the Westbury for one night during our trip through Ireland after reading the reviews here.  We wish we had stayed a few nights longer and know we will definitely return the next time we are in Dublin.  The hotel is in a fantastic location and is outstanding through and through.  When we arrived after a long drive we were greeted by the friendly staff at the front desk who made an extra effort to see that we were ok after a bit of trouble finding the hotel parking.  The bellman escorted us to our room which was large and very nicely decorated and had a Nespresso machine and a luxurious bathroom.  The bed was so comfortable we slept right through breakfast in the morning!  We had pre-dinner drinks at the Marble Bar and ate lunch at Cafe Novo and both were very nice.  The concierge recommended a fantastic Italian restaurant in the area for dinner (The Unicorn) and was very helpful.  The outstanding service offered by the staff from the moment we arrived until we departed made this hotel truly deserving of the ""Leading Hotels of the World"" label!  Stay here - you won't be disappointed!",5,2009,07,19
203,"great location, Beautiful Hotel !",i stayed  at the Westbury for three nights while visiting dublin. I loved this hotel. The location was superb ! The hotel staff was helpful and friendly. The rooms were very nice !! I would definitely stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat. They had a fantastic coffee maker in the room along with comfy robes. Linens were very nice quality. The rooms clean and nicely decorated. The beds very comfortable. A great experience !,5,2009,07,11
203,Top class hotel in centre of Dublin city,"My wife and I stayed for one night while taking in the Rod Stuart concert.Really impressed with the location and courtesy of staff.Would recommend definately-with prehaps a little reluctance regarding the price.Certainly if you want to treat yourself,this is the place to be.Top class and no complaints.",5,2009,07,06
203,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"This hotel is in the middle of everything.  We were able to walk everywhere.  The staff was incredibly friendly, the room was wonderful.  The beds were extremely comfortable.  We didn't eat at the hotel, so I'm not sure about the food.   Next trip to Dublin, we will definitely stay at the Westbury.",5,2009,07,01
203,"Fantastic location, even better service","Stayed here for the first time recently.  Most impressed with level of service.  Hot towels on arrival, maybe they realised we were quite stressed and hot after journey but was a welcome touch since we were in a hurry to attend a function.
Rooms gorgeous, i think recently renovated and really good attention to detail. Fantastic  girl looking after us as we were checking out.  Final nice touch a bottle of water as we were heading off in the car.  Will return.",5,2009,07,01
203,Location Location Location,"Have stayed in many Dublin hotels, and being a native I can't rate this hotel high enough, I have styed there many times. It's directly off Grafton Street ( all main shops including design,er shops and Brown Thomas).  Thousands of places to eat within five minutes walk. Great Hairdressers and fashion and beauty boutiques in the Westbury Mall , which is attached to the Hotel.  Rooms very clean and spacious.  Food fab, brekfast great also, but if you want something cheaper, there are many cafes etc on grafton street and lots of night life, bars, clubs everything you could want in a city break and if you go online and join the leading hotels of the world, www.lhw.com , the westbury is a member and if you book through this website and use your membership number you will definitely get an upgrade or something nice upon arrival.",5,2009,06,30
203,Wonderful experience,"I stayed here with my partner towards the end of June (for the Oasis concert). Having found a rate that was equivalent to many 3* hotels in Dublin, we jumped at the chance to stay here.

When we first arrived, the staff were very helpful in resolving a problem with our reservation, and seemed to go out of their way to assist us, and make us feel welcome.

The room was beautifully decorated, and facilitated. We had only a slight problem for half of a day with the wi-fi connection, as they were trying to roll it out to use in every room.

But we could barely find a fault with our experience. The only thing I can agree with TheMummykins review, below, is the absence of enough mugs/cups for the coffee machine - but hardly anything to get stressed over - a quick call to room service resolved the issue!

The location could barely be bettered - right in the centre of the shopping, and eating / drinking districts, without obtrusive noise pollution.

The Westbury comes highly recommended as far as we are concerned, and frequent travellers we are, at that.",5,2009,06,30
203,Not 5 star service,"Excellent location. Tip: on booking in ask for kettle for tea and coffee making, they have them for every room but for some reason reception wont offer them. The room and bathroom were clean and nice, beds comfortable. The coffee machine was rubbish, you are given one cup and one small cup, two milks and six coffee of 3 different types, there were two of us, who gets the small cup? Cleaners took cups away then replacements came later in the day, had to phone room service every day for milk and reasonable size cups, it wasnt until our last day that the room service man told us we could have a kettle and brought it for us. Ordered a free paper, never got one delivered, told concierge who waved at pile of papers and said sarcasticly - take two. Still didnt get one delivered. The breakfast was good but while we were at breakfast, the maid cleaned our room, helped herself to a M&S carrier bag that was with our personal possessions and lined the bin with it. That bag cost us 5cents!!!! The bin was not lined at any other time. In our room on our last afternoon, quick knock, door opens, mans head pokes in, oops sorry out again. Two minutes later same again, woman peeps in. We could have been dancing naked for all they knew. Went out to find out what was going on, telephone engineers apparently. Told all our troubles to the accommodation manager, Marion, who was very apologetic and gave my friend and I a nice box of chocolates for all the aggravation. Finally got a paper the very last morning as we were leaving. The concierge of the day, took our luggage and said he would bring it down to the taxi when we had checked out. He then gave us the third degree over what taxi we were getting, we had arranged the taxi the previous day. Wanted to know the sort of car, the name of the driver, where we got him!!! What business was it of his?? Then I had to run back up the stairs for our luggage as he still hadnt brought it down, he wasnt exactly overwhelmed at 6.45 am. Some of the pages were missing in the information book in the room, although told concierge, still didnt get them until the day before we left when everything else got sorted. No information as to where the computer was that we could use to check in at the airport, this was also sorted by the accomodation manager that last afternoon. This hotel could be great, really good location, nice rooms and lounges, tea far too pricey for a few cakes. It is so obviously aimed at business bookings, other visitors seem to be treated badly. Unhelpful reception and concierge staff who certainly never got a tip!!! Hotel is 5 star, staff apart from two exceptions - 0 stars. This experience felt like Fawlty Towers.",3,2009,06,24
203,First Class Stay at The Westbury,"My friends and I decided to treat ourselves and stay in the Westbury for the weekend of the Take That concert. We live in Kildare so it was a bit of an extravegence but turned out to be worth every penny in the end. 

We checked in quickly and effciently and our rooms were fantastic with lovely touches like the funky coffee machines. We didnt eat here as there is so much of a selection on your doorstep but the atmosphere and ambience in the Gallery and the bar is just lovely. You have to try one of their cocktails. Great girly fun weekend. So much so I am going back in 2 weeks with my partner to have a different experience. Hopefully it will be as enjoyable!",5,2009,06,24
203,"Very nice, good service, good price, but some room noise","I am glad I stayed here overall, but there are a few things that bothered me about this hotel.   In general, it was good.  The service was great, and they went out of their way to fix a small mechanical issue in my room (and did it within 2 minutes).  Then, the manager called to ask if anything could be done to make it up to me, but I didn't even think it was a big deal.  The concierge staff are all very friendly and helped me find about 100 things to do during my short trip.  So, this hotel gets very high marks for service.  

Some of the issues are minor but here were my small pet peeves:  The shower doesn't really have any water pressure, and it has no curtain or full door.   There's just a piece of glass over 1/2 of the length of the tub & feels awkward.   There is a lot more noise when you are in your room than I expected (from inside the hotel - not the view - which was the back side anyway).  They have a phone in the elevator lobby that (I think?) rings for housekeeping on each floor. It is *very* loud and rings a lot.  If you are close to this phone, it will get on your nerves by the 3rd day.   I could also hear my neighbor's TV until 2 AM a few times.  It wasn't even loud or I would've called the front desk. It was very quiet, but they mounted new plasma TVs on walls that were built a long long time ago & not meant to buffer that noise.    The food prices are way out of wack with the room prices.  My breakfast was like 35 euro for a tiny bowl of oatmeal and some eggs.    Well, then again, no hotel has restaurant prices that change like their room prices...so I guess that's normal.  Most days, I didn't eat there anyway.  The hotel internet is slow, and I could not use Skype to call out or to receive calls.  However, the internet was free...so I guess it was a trade-off.

The lobby is beautiful and the hotel sort of has a more formal feeling to it.  Most people in the lobby are in sport jackets, seem to be there on business, or seem to be having drinks.  I was in tourist-mode (and dressed like I was going hiking every day), so I certainly did not fit in.   I was actually surprised how formal it felt given the cheap rate I was paying (much less than the nearest competitor).  

If I came back, I'd still stay here because of 1. the value 2. how comfortable the rooms were & 3. how nice the staff was.  I'd just be asked to stay far away from that annoying hallway / elevator lobby phone.",4,2009,06,23
203,Could not find a fault,"The service,the staff,the location are all perfect.We were on a three night stay and could not fault it one bit.There are two great pubs out the front and we were over looking them,but we could not hear a thing in our room.The hotel is 30 yards from the main shopping street and the  Brown Thomas department store.Loads of bars,eating places,five minute walk to temple bar and close to St.Stephens park.Like i said COULD NOT FIND A FAULT ps.the hotel manager is called Joseph,and he is a very genuine and plesant  person who would go out of his way(like the rest of his staff) to make your stay very enjoyable.",5,2009,06,23
203,DISAPPOINTING,We arrived on the 12th of Juneand on arrival were told that our room was not ready.This was despite being told that we could check in at 2 pm.We were told to come back in an hour and on doing so we were told again there was no room ready.It was only after stressing our displeasure that one suddenly became available..The reception staff were dismissive and blamed a busy weekend.No excuse from a 5 star hotel.We also had to ring room service 4 times to try and get them to come to our room and to top it all there was cobwebs in our room.All in all not a great stay!,2,2009,06,22
203,Treat Yourself!,"I stayed here for one night a couple of weeks ago as a little treat for myself. It was my first time to stay at the Westbury Hotel and I was really excited about staying here.  When I checked in I was immediately upgraded from their standard room to an executive room so things got off to an excellent start. I was also given a hot towel to freshen up. The room was beautiful ‚Äì a large, bright room, very well decorated and absolutely spotless. It had a big four poster bed - the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in - and a huge flat screen TV, minibar, tea and very fancy coffee making facilities ‚Äì generally just everything you would require in a hotel room with loads of space also. The bathroom was also lovely also, with slippers and bathrobe provided and a very nice selection of toiletries and plenty of towels. I went for lunch at Caf√© Novo in the hotel which was really nice. When I returned to my room there was a tray of chocolates, strawberries and a selection of fruit waiting for me. It was a really nice touch and I loved it. Later my bed was turned down and more yummy chocolates were left for me. I didn‚Äôt eat breakfast in the hotel. Instead I went to Bewleys on Grafton Street.  

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would most definitely stay at the Westbury Hotel again. I‚Äôve even started thinking up reasons why I need to go to Dublin so I can stay there! It really is in an excellent location and top marks to the staff who were very friendly and helpful.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anybody.",5,2009,06,12
203,Very nice but not as nice as the Westin,"The hotel and the room were clean and the staff polite. I can't comment on the value for money as my comapny paid. Location is excellent on Grafton Street, right in the heart of the city.

When you come in you have to walk up a flight of stairs, with your luggage which wasn't fun and I found the room to get very hot if the airconditioning wasn't switched on. Also the maids were very noisy early in the morning.

There is free internet though which the Westin charges a fortune for.

So all in all, its very nice and my quibbles are small and I would stay again only as a second choice. I would stay at the Westin everytime over this.",4,2009,06,12
203,"Stunning, welcoming,great location, simply fabulous!",This was a bit of a treat of a special weekend away and we got a great deal on the hotel website. We were upgraded to a large room with a fab 4 poster king size bed. Everything about our 3 night stay was great. The staff were amazing and very helpfull. We didn't eat in the hotel as there were so many options near the hotel. We had a few drinks in the bar and it had a great atmosphere. I would certainly stay again and would recommend to anyone. We have stayed in several of the Doyle Collection hotels and always fiind the best deals on their own website. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat! I can't say enough about it to be honest!,5,2009,06,08
203,Simply perfect,"We spent  couple of weeks ago at the Westbury? How could I describe our staying in one word? Perfect. The staff was lovely. The room quiet, elegant, clean and very comfortable. Perfect location. Everything was wonderful. We also havd breakfast in the Cafe Novo, and it was great. We really enjoyed our 3-night stay at the Westbury, ad when I'll go back to Dublin, have for sure I will visit the Westbury.",5,2009,05,25
203,Beautiful Hotel in Fantastic Location and Worth Every Penny!,"As someone who has stayed in a number of Dublin city centre hotels this is my number one choice.  Its beautiful, elegant, spotless, comfortable, not all pretentious, has fantastic friendly service - concierge in particular, and the location a few steps off Grafton St couldn't be better for shopping, eating and sightseeing.
I got a very good deal on the price but for the overall experience i would have been happier to pay even more.  I didn't bother with the breakfast as Bewleys is just around the corner and much better value, in fact we ate all our meals out and in the immediate area - all excellent.",5,2009,05,25
203,5 star,"We stayed in one of the suites and it's truly 5-star. I have to say there is not too much wow factor, but we are  impressed by everything. It's quite difficult to find a hotel when everything is just right. Not a very big bathroom but decorated nicely and comfortable. The living is comfortable, decent size(big). The writing desk is the right size (bigger than those in the suites of other  5-star) where you have enough space for your laptop and papers and other stuff. The bedroom is again well decorated and big. The front desk is helpful and polite . Location is perfect.  Restaurant offers decent good food.",5,2009,05,21
203,"Great hotel, top location.","Top location just off Grafton Street close to everthing. Staff very professional and  courteous right from outside to the room. Good price from hotels own website on 3 nights for 2 offer, with the poor exchange rate from GBP to Euro  that was welcome! Dublin is expensive for us Brits at moment with a pint of the black stuff around ‚Ç¨5.50 (¬£5)or more.  Very nicely decorated throughout. Room a ""superior"" which was a good size, very well appointed with a lot of nice touches you would expect of a 5* hotel from a nespresso coffee machine(great coffee, the girlfriend is a tea drinker and no tea making facilities so it didn't impress her!!) to dressing gowns and slippers and crystal glassware. Room was very clean and a turndown service in evening again a nice touch. Will certainly look to book on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2009,05,14
203,Glad we picked the Westbury and hope to go back soon,"Really enjoyed our 2-night stay at the Westbury - great location, friendly welcome, very comfortable rooms.  The reception area is fantastic for people watching.  Only slight niggle was having to ring reception every day to have our coffee supply topped up, despite leaving the box open on the side so that it was obvious it was empty.  Also, having to ring for a hairdryer.  That aside, absolutely loved it and want to go back soon.

For anyone visiting Dublin for the first time, beware of being ripped off by taxi drivers at the airport - we were charged ‚Ç¨48 to get into the middle of the city (and only ‚Ç¨21 for the return journey, arranged by our hotel).  Also, Dublin suddenly seems expensive since the last time I visited (‚Ç¨5-‚Ç¨6 for a pint of lager) so take lots of cash and you'll have a great time.",5,2009,05,14
203,Wonderful location- a true 5 star,"Probably the best location in Dublin,  just off Grafton street. Friendly staff, large spacious room with nice 5 star touches such as fresh summer berries, robes,  slippers and a turndown service. Large bathroom with plenty of quality toiletries and nice big soft fluffy towels. Near some of the best shops, bars and restaurants in the city. Rooms nice and quiet with no outside noise.Lovely foyer and bar. Highly recommended.",5,2009,05,12
203,60th Birthday to remember at The Westbury,"It was my Mum's 60th Brithday last weekend and she was gong to be in Dublin for it, and as a surprise us 6 kids booked her into The Westbury for a bit of luxury. And luxury it was, from the friendly staff to the beautiful interior of the room. We also celebrated with dinner in the Wilde restaurant, and the delicious meal was far above expectations. We were all delighted with how pleased Mum was with her birthday weekend.",5,2009,05,12
203,Perhaps the finest Dublin hotel...,"This must be the finest hotel I have ever stayed in while visiting Dublin. Indeed, it is certainly the finest of all the JurysDoyle Collection hotels I have ever stayed in.

As a regular visitor to Dublin for concerts, I now doubt any visit to Dublin will be complete without a stay at the magnificent Westbury. Courteous staff, a relaxing atmosphere located in perhaps the most fashionable area of Dublin - right on Grafton Street.

I have stayed in many Dublin hotels and have often walked passed the Westbury, which is partcularly beautiful looking at Christmas. I just can't believe I've never stayed here before...!

My room was comfortable and quiet. Room service was promt and efficient. The hotel foyer is simply stunning and Wilde Restaurant is a treat! I certainly plan on staying at this hotel on my next visit.",5,2009,05,12
203,very good - but not perfect,"Just returned from a one night stay with our two young teenage children. We had booked two adjacent superior rooms but when we checked in there was quite a distance between the rooms. The manager Peter was very apologetic and offered to try and move some of the other guests to try and facilitate us - we declined but he kindly offered us a free bottle of wine at the bar which was a nice touch.
The rooms themselves are very large by city centre standards and nicely furnished with good beds, free internet access and huge tvs. One of the rooms also had a little ante / walk in wardrobe room which was great. The bathroom however was very small and the shower come bath was ""cosy"" to say the least. The windows are not sound proofed sufficiently and given this was a saturday night in Dublin - it was impossible not to be woken with the noisy revellers as they passed the back of the hotel. The front rooms may not have that problem. Also we were not aware that parking the car in the underground car park was 20 euro per night.
The best part of the hotel is the fantastic foyer which is very grand - its a must do to have afternoon tea or a pre or post dinner drink - really good furnishings and nicely spaced out - it has a unique atmosphere. its location within a few steps of grafton street is also the best in town. Staff were very friendly and efficient.",4,2009,05,11
203,PERFECTION IN THE HEART OF DUBLIN!,"What can I say other than this is a magnificent gem in the heart of Dublin. After a less than stellar stay in Galway (which I have reviewed) the Westbury was a like a dream come true. From the moment we drove up to entering my charming room loaded with amentities, I knew I was in for a treat. The staff was incredible, the room was spotless and the location in the heart of the action. Nothing snooty about the staff either, they couldn't have been any more professional and friendly. I found this out when I weighed myself on the scale in the room. Knowing I had eaten too much during my stay in Ireland, I called down to the front desk and asked them to convert the KG/stones to dreaded pounds! After great laugh I was informed my fears were coorect and I was totally pudged out! When I came down to go roaming around the area I had a great chat with the staff who thought my phone call was the funniest thing they had encountered and encouraged me to eat drink and be meryy while in Dublin! Friendliness just adds so much to a stay. It can turn a three=star hotel into a five and a five star into perfection.  I plan on returning for pleasure and the Westbury will be my destination. Even the baggage handlers and doormen were funny and kind. I felt like I had known them for years. It all conspired to make my short one night stay before flying home a special treat-thank you!",5,2009,05,09
203,Superb,"I have just returned from an excellent weekend away in Dublin where myself and three of my firends stayed at the Westbury hotel for what was an excellent stay dispite the rugby result. We arrived early and the girl on reception had both rooms ready for us so we had no waiting around for our room. After the disappointing result we returned to the hotel and we decided to try the bar downstairs Cafe Novo which was excellent ,we spent the night there.......... after a late night I recommend the room service breakfast... I have stayed in five star hotels before but none compare to the Westbury for having it all there for you and service to match.... I will be back.......",5,2009,05,04
203,Excellent!,"I stayed there with my partner as a treat for his birthday. The hotel is absolutely faultness. Wonderfull staff, beautiful room, even better location. .I absolutely loved my stay and can't wait to return!",5,2009,05,03
203,Fantastic Hotel in a great location,"We stayed at the westbury to celebrate my girlfriends birthday and the hotel lived up to our expectations in every way. I requested some Champagne on arrival from my Girlfriend and the hotel ensured it was there, she was delighted. The hotel is located just off grafton street so we didnt need the car all weekend. While the coneirge recommened some excellent retaurants for us to try we also tried Cafe Novo downstairs in the hotel and they service and food was amazing the staff are extremely helpfull and the sharing platers to start with are an excellent idea. Our room was really nice and they have some brilliant features, you can plug in you ipod in the room and they have nespresso machines for poeple like me who love coffee this was a great plus.",5,2009,04,26
203,Stylish relaxing luxury - loved it!,"Myself and my husband recently stayed in this hotel a treat for my birthday and a treat it was! When we were checking in the reception was busy but we were prompty checkd in by very friendly and polite staff, the room was beautiful, very modern and larger than i had expected ,most city clenter hotels i expect smaller rooms than normal as you are paying for location but in the Westbury you get both! the room has great amenities,fantastic big tv , coffee machine and lovely aqua di parma in the bathroom.The rest of our stay was flawless,great bar and restaurant, all the staff are so courtious and friendly - really made the stay and my birthday, will definatly be back, at the very least to sit and relax in the lovely ""gallery"" area and watch the world go by on grafton street.Cant recommend it enough!",5,2009,04,23
203,Very Nice!,"Had a fantastic stay at The Westbury, so much so, we're going back again in May!  The hotel's in a great location, close to some fantastic bars, restuarants and shopping.  The room was nice, the staff friendly and helpful.  They do some fantastic deals, we booked through their website which was the cheapest.",5,2009,04,23
203,Good hotel for business & shopping!,"Visited Dublin for a business meeting (also in the hotel). Reception staff were very attentive & helpful on arrival and my room was clean though a bit small. The meeting room was fine and the service we got was good. We messed around with our lunch arrangements a little but the staff took this in their stride and were really helpful. Even if they were a tiny bit exasperated by this, it didn't show. The food at lunch was very nice too. The Westbury is in a great location and is ideally situated for shopping & sightseeing. I have to say that Dublin is a great City and was looking cleaner and a bit more modern than my last visit a couple of years ago. The Westbury is a bit of an indulgence for a weekend leisure stay, I'd say, but it's certainly a very good hotel.",4,2009,04,17
203,"cosy, lovely, lovely hotel","I have just recommended this hotel to a friend who is staying in Dublin for one night next week for a special occassion and I hope she loves it as much as my husband and I did last autumn.  We had dreadful weather but were very happy to sit in the elevated lounge area and watch the world go by.  I love my five star hotels but I do think the rooms here were extra good - I'm not sure why one reviewer called the rooms 'basic' - perhaps they expected herds of wilderbeast a la Basil Faulty!!!  The rooms are small, as city ones are, but very cosy and very well fitted out.  The beds are fabulous!!  We ate at the two hotel restaurants and enjoyed them very much.  Oscars is very smart and luxurious.  All the communal areas were very stylish and I cannot fault this hotel at all.  It was recommended to us by a friend who works in the luxury end of the business travel world and we are very glad he did!!!!",5,2009,04,17
203,Words cannot describe the magnificent treatment we got at this hotel,"I stayed in the Westbury over Easter with 3 children under 4 and some friends.  We booked 5 rooms in total.  We also had a christening lunch for 25 people including 8 young children.

In every single respect The Westbury was outstanding.  I have never written a hotel review before, even though I am a very frequent traveller, but I do believe in giving credit where it is due.  It is quite obvious that the staff in this hotel are bending over backwards to meet all of their customers' every need.  I noticed iot every time I saw staff interact with customers.  I train people on delivering good customer service, and I know good service when I see it.

From prompt, polite check-in to room cleanliness to the magnificent decor (the new decor is beautiful, classy and sumptious) to the friendly staff who couldn't do enough for us or our children in the restaurants or any other area, always smiling, always efficient.  They made our trip so special it's one we will remember for a very long time.

We booked our daughter's christening lunch there on Easter Sunday, they gave us the use of a private function room, the staff were amazing.  All of my guests took me aside at one point or another to tell me the food was delicious and the staff were wonderful and thet they found it extremely relaxing and enjoyable.  

I can highly recommend this hotel to anyone considering it.  We have stayed in many 5 star hotels and I can assure you, you won't be disappointed.  The location of the Westbury is second to none and was the main reason we sayed there in the first place.  The pleasure of being able to pop out to Grafton quickly when you have small children, and it not being an excursion into town is worth it's weight in gold.

I would be happy for anyone to contact me if you would like to ask me anything about pur trip.",5,2009,04,16
203,cream of the cream,"there is not a single bad thing that i can say about this hotel, starting from the location (right in the city) to the lovely rooms, the excellent food. do try the main fancy restaurant but what is the most memorable thing is the staff... no wonder why ireland is famous for its hospitality, they really helped me and my boyfriend to make the most of our trip;",5,2009,04,13
203,Lovely Hotel but glad i paid bargain price.,"My Fiance and I have just returned from a night's stay in the Westbury Hotel, a place we have walked past many, many times and dreamed we might stay in one day. As our wedding is coming up soon, and aftr months of saving and doing very little, we decided to treat ourselves to a weekend in the city (we only live about 40 minutes away!)  and take advantage of the great deals on offer at the moment!

The westbury offered a good package (breakfast, late check-out, bar credit) so we opted for here rather than one of the cheapr offers for other city centre five stars. I was even cheeky and requested an upgrade with my booking! Yes, they said, we'd love to accommodate! However, disappointment struck when at check-in we were told in no uncertain terms that the hotel was fully booked!

The place is lovely inside. There is a huge lounge area with beautiful, opulent chandeliers and marble floors and a cosy, darkly lit bar off to one side. The room was nicely appointed. Nothing amazing, just your average modern basic room. The bed was the best ever though! So, so comfy, and there was a Krupps coffee machine (someone had left empties i the supply box though and we had to ring and wait a while for milk), which is a nice touch. The flat screen tv was large and you could listen in the bathroom (should you wish to). There was a turn-down service which was also a very nice touch but the room was incredibly hot, even though we left the (very loud and annoying) aircon on all night! No fresh toiletries either-just half bottles of what someone else had left behind-perhaps this is an environmental measure, or an economic one! 

As for our late checkout-we left the room early to go out for an hour and came back at twelve to find our key had been deactivated! No biggie you'd think, until you see the queue for checkout! We managed to get a ported to come and open our door with his master key but it's the little details like this which you don't expect in a hotel of such standing. 

Breakfast was good, service was great and we enjoyed a couple of free drinks in the bar that evening. Be warned-drinksare VERY expensive here if you have to pay for them!

All in all the place is very nice although perhaps not as nice as we had expected and i'm glad we hadn't paid the normal rates for what we got. Most of the staff were very courteous though the check-in lady didn't acknowledge our package and what was inluded which was a little confusing. I would stay here again at the special rates, It's in probably the very best location in the city, but at full price i would expect a bit more for my money.",4,2009,04,09
203,Very disappointing,"We travelled to Dublin on Saturday evening to attend a show in the O2. We were having a night away from two small children so decided to treat ourselves to a night in the five star Westbury Hotel.

On first impressions, it seemed fine, check in was efficient, no warmth or personal treatment, but we were heading to our room within a few minutes. The room is smaller than most five star hotel rooms, but for a city cerntre hotel - very comfortable.

We were running a bit late for the show so went down to the 'Cafe Nova' and asked to be served quickly. The staff coundn't have been better and the food was lovely. It's a relaxed, comfortable restaurant and a nice selection of food.

Bedtime - Went to bed and about two hours later woke up and realised that there must be a plastic undersheet on the bed. Decided to leave it as my husband was asleep, but sure enough in the morning I checked and there is was..... a waterproof sheet - It was a better quality than some - but still a plastic sheet. Most unpleasent nights sleep.

When checking out the receptionist took my credit card and headed off with it - for security reasons I do not like my credit card out of my sight. Apparantly there is a new computer system and they were having problems - no apology. After paying, the receptionist handed my card back to me and handed the receipt to my husband. All remarks were directed to my husband. No questions or comments like - did you enjoy your stay etc. 

The hotel was fine, but it is not a five star experience, having stayed in the Merrion HOtel and hte Four Seaons in the last year, sadly the Westbury is not up to scratch",3,2009,04,06
203,Best night of our trip.,"I almost didn't stay here because I read the bad reviews, but it was our favorite hotel of the trip.  The food was great and the view from our 6th floor room was perfect.  It was quiet and we will definitely stay here again and will recommend it.  The location was perfect for shopping on Grafton St.",5,2009,04,05
203,Not what I would consider 5 Star but nice,"We stayed in this hotel in late March 2009.  It was a family reunion of sorts and we thought we would treat ourselves to a nice hotel so my sister booked the hotel on a website and paid the usual deposit.  Thank God she kept confirmation of this because upon arriving at the reception of The Westbury (after a four hour drive) we were not greated in a friendly manner and when we tried to check in the receptionist was not in the least bit pleasant, she actually accused us of not using the correct web site to book the accommodation.  Now seriously at five star level you do not expect there to be this attitude at reception nor do you expect to have to explain in detail where and when you made the booking.  It was written in black and white for the receptionist to see.  That aside when we got to our room our luggage and the friendliest man were there to greet us and he even explained how to use the tv.  There were no Tea/Coffee making facilities only espresso which we found very strange considering that the most basic B&B accommodation would have these facilities in their rooms.  The little drawer that the espresso items were sitting on hadn't been cleaned in God knows when.  
The complimenatary breakfast was lovely and there was plenty of variety. The staff in the lobby were very helpful.  The location is excellent and overall I would definately stay there again but I would like to see more of the ""Irish Hospitality"" that The Westbury is renowned for!",4,2009,04,02
203,"Excellent, What's more!!!  A must stay","A professional, helpful and kind staff. You will be call by your name.",5,2009,03,27
203,Nice and friendly hotel,The Westbury is very centrally located in one of the shopping streets of Dublin (Grafton Street). The receptionist was very friendly and could also remember my name when I saw him next time. Nice and clean rooms (not extraordinary though). I would definitly stay there again.,4,2009,03,25
203,Couldnt find a more perfect hotel in Dublin,"Perfect Location - right by all stores etc. Great rooms  - large and comfortable - Wonderful service. If you want a hotel full of class, you've picked the right one",5,2009,03,04
203,Great Stay But Not Without Issues,"The Westbury is a fantastic hotel in a wonderful location. We stayed for two nights and during our second day (after our first night) we were called whilst out enjoying the sights of Dublin by the hotel telling us that there was a problem with our room.

When we returned we were told we had to move rooms due to a problem with the electrics in the room. Having to move wasn't a major problem but it was an inconvenience and we had to pack in the dark which wasn't easy. We were left waiting to find out where our new room was and when I asked for more information the response from the front desk was rather abrupt. I requested a better room to compensate for the time wasted and the inconvenience caused and although this was eventually provided, it was with an air of reluctance. We were ultimately upgraded to a suite which was great - spacious, stylish and very comfortable.

So whilst we'd certainly consider returning I felt the attitude of a couple of staff members did create an unnecessary feeling of unwillingness to acknowledge that the issue was with the hotel and not with us. After all, we didn't ask to move and we didn't stamp our feet and complain but I strongly feel that a hotel of it's class and standing should have offered what we received as a matter of course without us having to ask on more than one occasion.

Overall a great hotel, highly recommended.",5,2009,02,27
203,Fabulous service,"The hotel is lovely and situated, as far as I am concerned, in the perfect location of Grafton Street. The room was comfortable, but the one thing I have to highly commend is the service. I have to especially thank Najib, the night manager, who went out of his way to accomodate and nothing was too much trouble. really enjoyed the stay. 

From P.C. Galway",5,2009,02,25
203,Mixed experience,"I stayed here with 7 friends for an overnight for my birthday dinner. Our experience was very mixed. The hotel itself is in a great location and has a nice lobby. The rooms are ok but the bare minimum of what you would expect from a five star hotel. There are no ice machines on the floor so you have to contact room service for ice (I believe that there was one on the 6th floor but it was broken). There is still no tea making facilities - wonder what happened to the ones promised by the GM in his reply to a previous review back in December??? Our biggest problem was with the night porter. We had 2 more people in our dinner party that came back to the hotel to join us for a nightcap. The night porter interregated us about who we were and what room numbers we were staying in. We went up to the lobby sat down and were deciding what to order when the porter came over having realised that there were extra people in our group and insisted that the two extra people left the hotel immediately. We asked him if they could just stay for one drink but he refused and threatened security on us if they did not leave immediately with him. We were totally shocked!!! I think that this man needs some tutoring in Irish hospitality. Irish hospitality is renouned worldwide and our tourist industry uses it as a marketing tool. Wake up Westbury! I can understand the hotel wanting to monitor who gains access to their lobby bar late at night. However, I cannot understand why they have a problem with allowing guests (8 sober, well behaved and well dressed ladies) to invite 2 more sober, well behaved and well dressed ladies to join them for a nightcap. Additionally, seeing that our guests very already seated they should have been allowed to stay and have one drink rather than being frog-marched across the lobby and down the stairs to the exit in full sight of many other residents by this extremely rude man. This totally ruined what was up to then a really good night and left us with a really bad impression of the place. We mentioned the incident to the manager at check out but he was totally defensive and offered no apologies for this ridiculous behaviour.

Most of the other staff we encountered were very pleasant. Unfotunately it always the bad experience that sticks in ones mind and gets mentioned to others.

Breakfast was ok but a bit chaotic. Many of the same issues mention by previous reviewers still exist even though the GM stated that training had been undertaken to improve the service. We got a table immediately but the coffee was cold, the toast was cold, the hot buffet was luke warm and there was no salt or pepper on the table. However, on the plus side the juice was freshly squeezed, the croissants were freshly baked and there was a good selection of fresh fruit.

Come on Westbury pull up your socks. You have such a nice hotel don't let a minority of staff let you down.",3,2009,02,22
203,Excellent,This is a lovely place!  The location was great.  We could walk to everything.  The rooms were very nice and tastefully decorated.  They were surprisingly quite.  The lobby was beautiful.  We were only here for three nights.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  The concierge was also quite helpful.  This is a romantic hotel.  Lived up to expectations!,5,2009,02,16
203,Love this hotel,"We booked this hotel for a weekend for myself and my husband and my son and his girlfriend.  Due to flight delay from Newcastle we did not arrive at the hotel until almost 1am.  The member of staff on check-in was most welcoming and gave us a speedy check-in.  As our son and girlfriend wanted to make the most of our stay, we then went into the lounge for a drink.  The staff were most welcoming and gave speedy service.  

We love the hotel for the service, location, ambience and gorgeous breakfast!!!  My son and his girlfriend, not having stayed in such nice hotels previously, were very impressed.  We will certainly be coming again.  Can't wait!",5,2009,02,09
203,Fantastic Experience from start to finish,"My wife and myself stayed in the Westbury while visiting to see a friend in Dublin. From start to finish we were very impressed with all aspects of the hotel. The foyer creates a great first impression, the staff behind the check-in desk very helpful and efficient and the concierge very cheerful and helpful also.

The rooms are beautiful. Our bed was plush, we sank into it, and the blackout curtains really do black out. Bathroom well appointed, spotlessly clean and great selection of toiletries etc... The little extras like slippers and robes hanging up are a nice touch.

The netspresso machine is a major bonus for coffee lovers like me, and the 32 inch telly was bliss. We ordered room service breakfast both mornings and both mornings it was delivered piping hot and right on time to the minute.

I can't comment on the restaurants in the Hotel as we were out virtually all weekend with our friend, but they looked very good. We did have occasion to sit down in the bar that makes up part of the foyer and found the service to be good and the seating very comfortable. Apparently they do a great afternoon tea that looks fantastic - which i wished I had more time to try it out.

The second day we were there our keycards lost their 'key' so to speak and I had to go to reception. You would swear I was the only guest they had with the fuss they made of it and the apologies they insisted on making - even though I carried the cards in the same pocket as my phone, it was probably my fault they demagnetised!

Location - ridiculously good. 50 metres to Grafton street, around the corner from Stephens green and a short (very short) walk to the Gaeity Theatre.

In summary you get what you pay for, this is a top class hotel in a top class location, and I'd have no hesitation recommending it to anyone visiting Dublin looking for a bit of luxury - or just a treat.",5,2009,01,25
203,Not good!!,"My wife and I stayed at the Westbury Hotel for one night on the 28 Nov 2008. Granted the hotel is in an excellent location, it's walking distance to all the major shops. It's just a pity that I can't say the same for the service and food in the breakfast suite. The following morning my wife and I queued for breakfast and were given pagers, it took 15 minutes before we were paged, I have never had to queue for breakfast in a hotel. 
On arrival at the table, I noticed quite a few empty tables so I couldn't understand the wait, surely they should be fully staffed on a Saturday morning. The table was not completely laid, there was no salt and pepper, no milk jug, nor teaspoons.  The muesli and cornflakes on the cereal counter were empty.  We ordered tea and toast well before collecting our main cooked breakfast (Garvy style), our main was cold by the time it arrived, and by the time the milk, salt & pepper, teaspoons arrived, I felt like going elsewhere. The coffee was tasteless, so we asked for a second pot, it was the same. Actually the whole breakfast was mediocre and certainly was not that of a five star status. We were looking forward to a nice relaxing breakfast but instead got totally stressed at the service so much so that we didn't even finish it.  I complained to the manager on duty who was apologetic and asked for our room number (why). Two ladies at the table on my left overheard me and also complained about the service. There was nothing in our room, not that it would have made a difference, nor was it mentioned on checking out.  I would recommend this hotel for its location and rooms, but I would advise you to eat out, merely for quality of food and service. We could have eaten much better for 20 euros elsewhere.",2,2008,12,03
203,good hotel but watch out for the overpriced Restaurant,"Nice room etc ‚Äì but avoid the restaurant - had lunch at their restaurant with my wife ‚Äì two starters, two main courses, 2 bottles of water no coffee tea desert or wine- I had to ask for more fries got 5 sticks and no veg with the very small simpe steak  - ‚Ç¨122‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..now come on chaps that‚Äôs a rip off in any mans language, and no simple lunch is worth that (I had lunch at the fourseasons for less with wine ??????) .  Nice place for a rest when in Dublin shopping but careful what you order.",3,2008,11,22
203,Loved the Westbury,"Stayed with some friends at the Westbury for one night,  This hotel is fabulous, the staff are very friendly and so helpful.  The rooms are lovely and it is the little things that make the difference here such as the cut crystal glasses for the mini bar and in the bathroom.The hotel itself is in the centre of Dublin with fabulous shopping and beautiful restaurants.  It is a little expensive but well worth it.",4,2008,11,07
203,well located and excellent,"I am very pleased with this hotel. High speed internet access was available (for free!) in my room, huge bed very confortable, the best quality bath and shower gel I had in many years, good concierge service and very well located in the center. Slippers, bathrobe , chocolates and Nespresso in the room. Breakfast (21 euros) is really a high quality one and service is spotless.
On the improvement side, the room could be a bit more silent and bigger. 
Overall an excellent hotel, I will come back here with my wife next time.",5,2008,10,20
203,Simply dull,"The Westbury is good for the business traveller and no doubt serves well as a conference centre but it offers no charm for the leisure traveller. Our standard room was small without being cramped and seemed to be luxury by numbers. Just a very unoriginal hotel and no way worth the premium price. Location is great but with Dublin being a relatively small city, location shouldnt be your primary choice.",3,2008,09,15
203,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed in The Westbury in July on a trip to Dublin and will definitely be staying there again.  The service from all staff was exceptional and everyone looked like they were enjoying what they were doing.  The hotel is so centrally located to Grafton Street and pretty much everything that you'll need in Dublin.  O'Connell Street is walking distance away, with theatres and more shopping.
We didn't eat in the hotel as we were out for lunch and dinner but the rooms were gorgeous.",5,2008,09,02
203,Wonderful Westbury!,"We have just come back from Dublin and a wonderful stay at The Westbury.  You get what you pay for in this world and the Westbury proves this.  It is by no means cheap but worth every penny.  Service, the rooms and toiletries were lovely.  Breakfast has lots of choice and well prepared.  The terrace lounge is pleasant and wifi is free.",5,2008,08,25
203,"Close, but not quite as good as it should be","Having lived in Dublin for a couple of years till recently, I knew the hotel and was aware it had a good reputation. Unfortunately it was undergoing an upgrade in the downstairs reception area during our stay, which meant the entry was a worksite of men, loose boards and a lot of sawdust.

They kept the mess to a minimum, it was just unfortunate the poor people at reception could not hear anyone checking in when they spoke, due to the sawing noise. We then found our room was 2 floors above reception, which meant the lovely drilling and sawing was still extremely loud (here's a suggestion folks - close up the rooms directly above the worksite when drilling and sawing is happening).

That said, for anyone else, these works are obviously only temporary, it was the grinding and groaning of the pipes that occurred every time you flushed the toilet that was more annoying. I had a word at reception about how loud it was, they promised maintenance would have a look - it was just a let down that upon returning late that evening, the noise was still there, and there was no word or note from the hotel. I mentioned it again upon checking out the following morning- and there seemed to be no record of the complaint. 

They asked if we wanted to talk to someone more senior to complain, to which I replied that I had already notified you of the problem, as a quality hotel, I would hope that you take my advice this time and fix the problem and do not let down any more customers.

As an aside - I am a big fan of Aqua Di Palma bath products, big plus for the Westbury having these. Big minus for not replacing the used bottles for the 2nd day - that is a bit cheap.

Oh - and another bizarre thing - there is a great drip coffee maker in the room - however there are no tea making facilities, when we enquired about this we were told you have to order tea via room service. I have NEVER encountered this in my life. Very strange :0
Overall it is in a great location (as are many other hotels in Dublin though).. The staff were friendly and helpful.. I would recommend in a few months time  AFTER the renovations are over :)",4,2008,08,25
203,Great time at The Westbury,"Just returned from Dublin and The Westbury, celebrating a birthday with my sisters, and we were all so impressed.  A great hotel in a perfect location for shopping, restaurants and all the sights of Dublin.  Our rooms were tastefully decorated, Aveda products in the bathroom, the beds and pillows fantastically cosy, staff friendly and helpful - we felt safe and comfortable and loved the hotel.  It is quite pricey, although we got a very good deal, but as we wandered the city and came across other hotels we had considered, we were so pleased with our choice.  It had everything we wanted, and shopping at the end of the street - heaven!",5,2008,08,06
203,spoiled rotten,"Hi , I stayed for a weekend at the westbury with my fiance and loved every minute of it. We just loved the room and the restaurant was magnificent. I want to come back just to order some of the other dishes from the menu! Absolutely perfect when you want to get away from it all for a weekend and spoil yourself. We were close enough to the shops for herself yet when we got back to the hotel, we couldnt have been further from the busy streets. We didnt feel rushed in the restaurant or bar at any stage and the staff were courteous at all times. I will definitly come back the next time we go away for a weekend.",5,2008,06,19
203,We recommend it!,"My wife and I stayed a couple of nights in the Westbury Hotel. The service was ecxellent at all time. The Westbury has just been rennovated as the concierge told us, and we loved it. What I liked the most was the atmosphere of the main restaurant, my wife enjoyed the huge and peaceful lounge area. 
We found it to be very relaxing while right in the city centre. It is very well located, just off Grafton Street, the main shopping street and also close to restaurants and theatres. We highly recommend it!",5,2008,06,16
203,Restaurant,"I was very fortunate to only stay for one night due to a corporate
function the following night. Totally over priced. ¬£63.43 for two course meal, a glass of wine and a coffee. The meal was only satisfactory. Service was good in that the ceaser salad is prepared to your liking at the table.",3,2008,06,16
203,Never again!!!,"Myself and my sister went up the bank holiday weekend to stay one night. I wanted something special as it was her birthday. The hotel itself was gorgeous but the staff were not at all friendly! I had to pay upfront before I had even seen the room. I was asked, not very nicely, for a ‚Ç¨50 deposit for the mini bar, and was told as long as we didnt touch anything we would get it back. The room was pokey, not 5 star by any means! When we got back that evening after a meal (about half past 12) I asked at reception to purchase a bottle of wine and was told to go up to my room and wait for a phone call. We had to pay for parking as a hidden extra and there was a 15% service charge added at the end. I felt inferior the whole stay and will never step foot inside the place again",1,2008,06,05
203,Very nice but overpriced,"I booked myself and my husband into the Westbury recently as a surprise weekend away.  After living in Dublin several years I was aware of this hotels reputation as being one the top hotels in the city.  Check in was fast & efficient and our room was very spacious, clean and also quiet.  The bathroom was nothing special but it was also spotless which is the main thing.  Nice little touches in the room such as robe, slippers, flat screen television and coffee machine.
We ate in the restaurant on the second night and had a lovely meal.  The food was beautiful, the service excellent and the decor and ambience was perfect.
The bar/lounge is also very nice, the drinks are expensive, but it is expected considering the hotels status and location.  The bar itself could be a little bigger as there is not much in the way of seating.
The hotel staff are professional but lack warmth and are somewhat aloof, but maybe that's all part of the 5 star ""charm"" :-)
Overall we had a very nice stay but I feel that this hotel is overpriced.  Yes it is a very clean, well run and excellently located establishment, but ‚Ç¨300 a night bed only plus service charge is a bit steep.  Also, I would expect most 5 stars hotel to have a spa and a swimming pool.  The Westbury has neither.",4,2008,05,28
203,Love the spacious rooms,Beautiful hotel with an amazing interior.  Rooms very spacious and beds were so comfortable.  Excellent location also. Also staffvery friendly and professional.,5,2008,04,29
203,Loved the Westbury,"I booked a night at the Westbury for my husband's birthday. It didn't disappoint. The staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. The room was amazing, overlooking the flower stand on Grafton Street. It really is so central for getting around the city. We had dinner booked in Shanahans that night and they told us how to get there, and the next morning the same staff were on duty and remembered to ask how we'd got on and wished my husband a happy birthday too.  We really couldn't fault any part of our stay and hope to do it again next year. Definitely worth every penny.",5,2008,04,24
203,"Top Hotel, Top Stay, Top Marks","I booked into the Westbury with my girlfriend. I was a little aprehensive checking in as i knew the hotel was undergoing renovations, however my fear was allayed when on arrival to my room there was no evidence of any work being carried out, and it seems the Westbury managed them with minimal disruption to guests. Although my room was not one of the newly upgraded rooms it was still in exceptional condition facing onto Grafton Street, king size bed, air conditioned, mini bar, his & hers bathrobes, slippers etc. I can't wait to see what the new rooms are like if the one i had is anything to go by, the Westbury standard is extremely high!! The staff were exceptional and catered to every request that we had, which helped in making our stay that little bit more memorable.",5,2008,04,21
203,Not 5 star,"My partner and I stayed at the Wesbury hotel on Saturday 19th April. The hotel has a fantastic location, hard to beat, however it is not 5 star. The bed was extremely old and uncomfortable, there were renovation works of some sort the next morning, hammering etc. I love the location of the hotel, the staff were very friendly and it's nice to have a drink in the bar before heading out for the night. All and all, I would have been happy to pay 150 for this room but the 270 Euro we did pay was simply not up to the expected standard - FC - Dublin.",3,2008,04,21
203,good if you are a party animal,"Stayed for one night for my husbands birthday. Room nothing special, basic city centre hotel room and overpriced.. Unfortunately our room overlooked Grafton Street and as it was a Saturday night the noise was really bad until about 3.30am, even kept my husband awake and he can sleep through anything. At 6am chairs and furniture was being moved around upstairs by housekeeping staff I expect. Breakfast in the Bistro area was quite cold and not very appetising. The public rooms were nice but generally we were very disappointed.",2,2008,04,10
203,Location & service A+++,"I've stayed in the Westbury a couple of times over the past few years! Can't say enough about the location and the service, only stayed the one night but had a fantastic time...

The place is going under some major changes and the new room we stayed in was superb - we will have to go back for afternoon tea the next time we visit!!!

ps - left my phone recharger behind and they phoned me to let me know, thank you! I don't know how many i've lost at this stage!!",5,2008,04,10
203,Location Location Location,"Having not stayed here in a number of years, I thought the right time to revisit would be for a surprise midweek stay with my girlfriend on our anniversary night out in the city. We were both very impressed with the d√©cor and size of our room. The rooms must have undergone some refurbishment as ours looked very new and modern, even kitted out with an iPod docking station (pity I didn‚Äôt have my iPod with me ).

All the contact we had with the front desk and staff was very helpful and friendly and what I would come to expect from a 5-star hotel. Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt have time to enjoy our inclusive breakfast because we were both running off to work a little late (damn those comfy beds!) 

For visitors to Dublin I couldn‚Äôt recommend The Westbury more, it‚Äôs the perfect location to start your exploration of the city (your slap bang right in the center) Plus St Stephens green is only a stones through from the lobby.

203,Appalling service and incompetent reception staff,"Stayed in the world-renowned Westbury in Dublin for a family reunion. As this was a special occassion, much thought had gone into the selection of the hotel. To say we were disappointed would be a gross understatement! Staff were rude, obnoxious and highly incompetent. Our hotel room was basic, lacking in any charm that one would expect from a four star hotel. On departure, there were a series of errors on our bill. Any attempt to rectify this, was met with a serious attitude by reception staff. The hotel could not accomodate us for breakfast. They were too busy, despite the hotel being practically empty! Overall, a horrible experience, and grossly over priced for what it is, a basic city hotel, with serious faults. There are many more hotels in Dublin, so do not stay here!",1,2008,04,07
203,great but pricey!,"Excellent hotel - booked on spec and only stayed the one night but couldn't fault it. Only ""down-side"" was when the concierge questioned me on why I was wandering in at 11pm!! Good security though, I was a little drunk and dressed like I couldn't afford to stay there!!",4,2008,04,04
203,Amazing,"Got a special deal on the hotel's own website (239 euros for one night with breakfast for 2 people). Was very pleased with out stay. On checkin we were handed hot towels to refresh which was lovely after our long drive. Valet parking took care of the car. Room was spotless with Aveda toiletries. (Bath a bit narrow though). All the usual amenties you'd expect except there were no tea or coffee facilities, you could order tea up at 8 euros a go instead. Room service brought us breakfast the next morning which was prefect and there was a nice late check out of midday. Our car was returned to us immediately. 

We paid with a debit card on check in. That night around 3am we had a drink in the lounge and were told it was room charge only (they wouldn't accept cash or cards). No problem but 5 mins later a man practically ran over to us to say there was 'no credit on our room' and we would have to pay now immediately. (the reason being we'd used a debit rather than a credit card to pay for the room). I thought this reaction was a bit over the top for a 16 Euro bill. 

We loved our stay here but didn't get to use any of the restaurants or lounge areas, they're are much better restaurants and pubs on the door step anyway.",5,2008,04,04
203,Wonderful room & service!,"This hotel was our favorite during our trip to the UK & Europe.  We were upgraded to a junior suite, the bed was comfy, the bathroom was nice and clean, the internet worked!  The room was very spacious!

We also enjoyed being able to have tea or Guiness down stairs in the lobby, which was comfortable.  The hotel is located right off of Grafton street and we were so happy with the location!  While my husband went to do some business I was able to shop to my hearts delight!

We had breakfast every morning downstairs which was pretty good and also had a few sandwiches in the hotel lobby with our Guiness.  No complaints here!

The staff was very friendly and helpful and that always goes a long way in my book!  If there is a time that we were to return to Dublin I would stay at the Westbury again!",5,2008,03,06
203,Good Location,Excellent location in Dublin. Good food. Comfortable room. Would recommend.,4,2008,02,26
203,Disappointed by the Westbury,"The Westbury is a five star hotel and for the prices you pay you expect it to be very, very comfortable with impeccable service. I enjoyed my stay there but I didn't think the hotel was the standard you would expect for the price.
On the positive side: it is the best location in Dublin and there is nothing like stepping straight out the door and into the middle of the flower sellers of Grafton street.
On the negative side: maybe this is because it was the week before christmas, but there were so many people drinking in the hotel bar that it was worse than unpleasant and really noisy. When we came back late and tried to order a drink, it took several attempts before we finally were served, while sitting at a filthy table no one bothered to clean for us. Staff cleaning up bottles were really noisy, dropped loads of the bottles on the ground, lots of laughing and shouting. It felt more like a rowdy bar than a hotel. I enjoy rowdy bars as much as the next person, but is it really what you expect at the Westbury? I was looking forward to a nice quiet nightcap, but it really wasn't enjoyable.
The hotel has recently been redecorated and the decor is nice, if a bit bland. 
So to summarize, I have no big complaints, but it wasn't the special experience that I would have expected from a 5 star hotel that is such a landmark in Dublin. Pity.",3,2008,01,09
203,One of the best hotels in Ireland!!,"Without question one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at (and I've been around the world).

Rooms are newly re-decorated and are very beautiful.

Service - these guys really know how to do it!!  We had an issue with the heat and we were moved to a new room and received a discount on the bill.

Only mis-giving I have is that the music in the bar was rubbish (dance/rave) for a 5 star hotel and my party asked to have it turned down (which they did).

Would recommend without reservation.",5,2007,12,02
203,Great Location...Great Hotel,"This hotel is perfect for a shopping holiday in Dublin.  It is a beautiful hotel just off Grafton Street.  You walk out the front door, and you can start shopping.  The Hotel is very nice...among the best in Dublin.  The staff is extremely friendly, and accommodating.  Quite possibly one of the best all around hotels I've ever stayed.   Location, Luxury, Staff, Cleanliness, and Comfort...its got it all.",5,2007,11,27
203,superb service,"I spent August 2007 touring and working in Ireland - my first time there - and stayed at the Westbury  3 times between each leg of my journey. As others have noted, the location is perfect for just about
anything one wants to see and do in Dublin. For me, travelling on business and pleasure, the hotel's staff was up to the task. They helped me arrange  some complicated train/travel plans; got me a manicure on a Sunday when that was surprisingly no small feat, and always remembered me by name when I came back to the hotel with a heartfelt greeting. They also sent some valuable items I'd left in my
room back to me in the states, free of charge.  

The free breakfast was as you would expect in Ireland: plentiful, locally inspired, and if you crave really fresh fruit or smoothies, please don't be disappointed. You can make do, and the staff is friendly, hard working, and professional.

If you stay there, visit the wine and spirits merchant right across the street. They have some exquisite spirits you can't get in the US.",4,2007,10,31

203,Perfect,"The Westbury is perfectly located a stone's throw away from Grafton Street, which is lined with shops and enlivened by street performers of every ilk.  The room was inviting and clean, with turndown service (and chocolates) and all the amenities.  We had dinner in the dining room (delicious) and lunch in the lobby bar/tea room (delightful).  We could have received, perhaps, more assistance in planning activites (we were told we didn't need reservations for the Literary Publ Crawl, but really should have had them), yet it all worked out.  We were very pleased with this hotel, its service and amenities.
",5,2007,09,14
203,Perfect Location,"They make you feel special at the Westbury. The location is the best in Dublin 50 metres from Grafton street, Dublin's premier shopping area. We went out on town and felt so smug watching the throngs queue for taxis home and out to hotels in Dublin 4 as we strolled past the night door man!. ‚Ç¨200 for the room for the night with breakfast and parking included meant it worked out very reasonable too. The room was very confortable and well equiped , if a little dated. The breakfast is the best in town, a definite cure for the previous night's excesses! Staff were all very friendly and professional.

203,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location.","I stayed in the Westbury Hotel in Dublin in August 2007 with my mum.  Our main purpose of the trip was wedding dress shopping. We found the hotel to be very well located and we were within walking distance of all the main city centre shops.  My overall experience of the hotel was wonderful.  We arrived at the hotel at 9am and was hoping I could leave our bags into storage until we could check in.  The receptionist found a room for me straight away however and we were able to check in early.  We were also offered the complimentary continental breakfast that morning.  A member of staff came to turn down the bed in the evening and left slippers and a chocolate.  We ate in the Bistro restaurant that evening and it was very nice. There was a pianist in the lobby bar after dinner so we stayed there for a few drinks.  The following morning we had the complimentary continental breakfast again and we didn't have to check out until 12 o clock.  The concierge stored our luggage for us for a few hours until we were leaving Dublin.  Overall I would highly recommend this hotel.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was a nice size, the hotel itself is clean and it's in a great location.  It's worth booking more than a month in advance as we were able to avail of a special offer.
",5,2007,09,06
203,Downtown Dublin,"It's not easy reaching the Westbury in a car, the maze of one way streets require an indepth knowledge as you make your way into the heart of Dublin. The result is well worth it though, the hotel has great service, is spotless clean and the breakfast, although not cheap was fabulous.

My main complaint was my window #318 faced our to Grafton street and had an enormous spotlight illuminating the building shining right into the room, meaning it was impossible to enjoy the view. 

My colleagues' room #217 had noise fromthe piano in the lounge meaning she couldn't sleep till after 1am.

So we advise you to get a room on a high floor!!

203,"A weekend away, no kids!","What a fantastic hotel, there is so much to see as soon as you walk in the front door. The staff are all lovely and very helpful, nothing
was too much trouble, if you had any queries they were sorted straight away. My only gripe was that the room had no tea or coffee facilities, you had to pay extra the room was already expensive enough. We stayed on the 6th floor in a skyline suite which looked out over the city, the room was enormous and very luxurious. A well stocked mini bar, which my husband emptied of jelly beans every day.
The hotel is superbly situated just off Grafton street, which in my opinion is the best shopping in Dublin. The bed was turned down nightly and a chocolate was placed on the pillow, and slippers put by the bed, a nice touch. Room service was superb too, the food was great. I would highly recommend this hotel but take plenty of money its not a budget hotel, but you get what you pay for!",5,2007,08,29
203,Fantastic Location,"Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Jurys Westbury, Dublin where my husband and I took our 14 year old nephew for a long weekend break.  Booked two rooms with interconnecting doors.  On check in we were greeted by the head receptionist who was probably one of the nicest most helpful people i have met on my travels.  She discounted our second room due to single occupancy and provided us with so much information on what to see and do whilst in dublin.  Concierge was extremely helpful and recommended excellent restaurants during our stay.  The heavens opened during our stay and we were equipped for this, however, the concierge arranged two large golfing umbrellas for our use during our time at the hotel.  Very comfortable rooms, excellent service, very nice full irish breakfast included in our rate.

On arrival the concierge takes your car, no parking charges. Bags are carried in if you wish, first class service. Had a great time, really enjoyed it. Little Caesar across the road is a beautiful restaurant. Perfect location for shopping and nightlife, well worth the extra money, would definitely stay again.

203,Magical,"We stayed here in a cold January to celebrate my friends 40th birthday.

I was lucky enough to have won a stay in the Presidential Suite hence that was our destination for the festivities.

Needless to say with a private living room, gym and your own sauna, the accommodation was out of this world.  The bathroom with tv was fabulous.

Our other friends stayed in the classic rooms and whilst small found them well appointed and comfortable.

On a previous visit to Dublin (October 2005) I came to the Westbury and dined in The Russell Room.  The cuisine was wonderful and the staff were very attentive.

I was well looked after on both occasions and made to feel very welcome.

This hotel is in a great location for the sights, sounds & nightlife of Dublin.

A great hotel in a greater city.

203,Trying hard but far from 5 star,"Location Location Location - great for seeing the sights and sounds of Dublin - try and book the unfurbished rooms as the new ones are trying deserately to be trendy and dont quite make it. 

Booking in is a nightmare as the listening skills of the staff leave a lot to be desired and they simply dont understand simple requests and fail to upsell you anything. 

Its easier to get into jail than it is to get into breakfast - suggest you stick a stickie on your forehead with your room number on it as the staff will keep bothering you though out the meal - Food is good but an a la carte breakfast would have been nice rather than the dreaded buffet. 

All in all a great stay but far below expectations

203,"Robbed in our bedroom, whilst we slept.","We have stayed at the Westbury many times before, it is an excellent place to stay and the services are normally wonderful - until something goes wrong, and this time it did. Upon waking we found that our bag containing passport, money, credit cards etc had been taken from the room whilst we slept. No sign of a break in, so a key must have been used. It has caused us terrible problems as we were staying in Dublin to fly on to Europe on an important business trip. 
Otherwise, the Westbury is a lovely hotel, but I think we will stay elsewhere in future.

This hotel has a superb central location right on Grafton Street for main shops etc. Car parking on site and is free - first come first served. The reception and main lobby and bar areas are very grand - as you would expect from a five star establishment - all very classy.
We had a room on the top floor - faultlessly clean  in every respect. Room was large but bathroom slightly small though no problem. Turn down service at night is a nice touch.
Continental breakfast was included in the room rate but we paid extra for cooked breakfast. This was fine but to be honest nothing special. The food was well cooked and hot and fresh but if I had a gripe it is that the selection was not as extensive as I might have expected from a  five star hotel.
All staff especially at reception were friendly and helpful throughout. 
Just one minor iritation to mention. On returning at 11.45pm (on a Friday night!) from our concert we went to the bar which was less than inviting as the staff seemed to be trying to close it! Drinks were still being served though by waiting staff in the main lounge (they fetched them from the bar)  however only standard drinks could be ordered - no cocktails despite the fact that we had noticed an extensive cocktail menu earlier in the evening. I would have expected better from this hotel so perhaps it was only a minor blip. Certainly not enough to put us off from returning as the location is undoubtedly a big draw

203,"Excellent hotel, great location","This is a fairly typical 4- or 5-star hotel in a big city.  The staff (with one exception) were incredibly competent and friendly and the room was everything you'd expect from a $400-a-night hotel.  The location, just off Grafton Street, makes it very, very convenient for all the tourist destinations (museums, restaurants, etc.) in the center of the old city.   Highly recommended.

203,First Class All The Way,"Fabulous hotel. Room was spacious and very clean, offering hi speed access, flat screen tv and very cushy bathrobes. Location is perfect, next to all the high-end shops and boutiques on Grafton Street. Staff, especially the concierge staff, were wonderful. They even accomodated our request for a late afternoon check-out due to an evening flight. I highly recommend Afternoon Tea in their lounge.

203,"mmmmm not quiet 5 star, mabey 3!","Stayed at the Westbury for a night while visiting a Dublin resturant.
Have to say being from Dublin I expected something special but found it severly lacking. Contacted the hotel before arriving to find out about parking, was told not to worry about it as the valet would look
after the car...... turned up at the hotel no valet parking, had to walk down to the car park to find someone to let me in, guy at the door just shrugged his shoulders.

Room was big but very dated and needed a lick of paint, apart from that it was OK but nothing to write home about.

Breakfats was terriable, service was non existant

Overall you can't beat the location of the Westbury, but I felt the staff were wondering around without a purpose, needed a paper before Brekfast and the manager went to get it.....he met someone he knew on
the way and stopped talking to him.....and never came back with the paper....not 5 star.

advice....Stay at the 4 seasons in Ballsbridge, they have car that will bring you into Dublin, service was excellent and most importantly, felt special.

More advice...went to Shannahans on the Green while satying at the Westbury, was fantastic...but only if your a meat lover...... mmmmmmm

203,"The BEST Hotel in all of Dublin, by far!","Stayed here for one night. Staff are really helpful. Reception staff are excellent, security staff are very polite and friendly. Porters treat you like royalty.

Room was very clean and spacious. Room service was excellent and surprisingly veyr fast too. Also competitively priced.

Excellent breakfast. Hotel has a beautiful cocktail bar. It has a lovely lounge where the piano is played every day/evening. Two fantastic restaurants which provide excellent choice.

The location of the Hotel is unbeatable.

The Westbury Hotel is simply the best hotel in Dublin.

203,Classy Hotel WIth Irish Charm,"This was our second stay at the Westbury. We've been lucky to have spent over 20 weekends in Guiness Heaven over the past 7 years. Most hotels we've stayed in have all been lovely, but this was always my favourite. Very pricey, but well worth it as a wee treat now and again. 
This hotel is classy, but it still retains Irish Charm - how could it not being in the centre of Grafton Street. You have everything on your doorstop - shopping of St Stephens Green, the well kept and stunning Park, yet you're a stones throw away from Temple Bar and all the attractions we are passed visiting (a few minutes walk from Trinty College, Molly Malone, Christchurch etc........' 
The hotel is warm and welcoming. There is no snobbery. THe rooms are large and luxurious.
The staff are fab! There are maids, cleaners and waiters all over the place 24 hours, but they are discreet and fade into the background. What a fab job they do.
The Westbury offers everything u would expect of a 5 Star Hotel. YOur covers are pulled back, individual Lilly O'briens choccies are placed on your pillows. Dressing gowns are laid out for you each night, as well as slippers, little touches that all add up to a great stay.
At the end of the day a hotel is just a bed to stay in - Dublin is what makes Dublin so special, the people, the craic, the Guiness, but The Westbury just tops that all off sweetly. 
May not being staying there again for a few years, but wouldn't hesitate in returing - just have top get saving!
",5,2007,02,22
203,Definately not 5 star!,"Nice place, but not up to  full expectations for a hotel that describes itself as ""one of the most luxurious five star hotels in Dublin"", and tells you to ""indulge yourself in a lifestyle of luxury and unparalleled comfort"". 

Stayed here on New Year's Eve just for one night. The concierge did well to take care of our car considering the car park was full. Rooms were very nice and comfortable. No problems really apart from when I rang the concierge to ask for a taxi, they suggested that I just come down to the door and wait for one. Not good enough. When I order a taxi in a 5 star hotel, I expect them to order it for me, and contact my room when it arrives. The location is definately five star, but unfortunately, nothing sticks out at saying that this hotel deserves a 5 star rating apart from it's name and location. Still a lovely hotel, but probably more deserving of 4 stars.
",4,2007,01,22
203,"Good Hotel, Excellent Location","Was really pleasantly surprised having heard mixed reviews. 

Room was a little small, but what you would expect from a city center hotel, but had all the mod-cons and was nicely decorated. Excellent shower and room temperature could be changed according to preference. 
Staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Breakfast was average. 
The best thing is the location. It is walking distance from ALL the main attractions.

203,Loved loved loved it!,"We totally lucked out getting this hotel.  We had made a reservation for Jurys Inn Christchurch but somehow it didn‚Äôt book correctly.  One of the desk attendants, Dennis, was so helpful; immediately picking up the phone to call within their chain.  I heard him ask for a special rate for him, which we definitely got!  I don‚Äôt remember how much we paid, but it was well under the advertised price.  We had beautifully Americanized rooms, with morning USA Today newspaper, bathrobes, slippers, turn down service with Chocolates, in room crystal glassware and a sheet between you and the blanket, which is apparently rare in that neck of the woods.  Every time we were in the halls there were maids cleaning or buffing something.  Not to say this was annoying, but a tribute to their standard of excellence.  Plus, as we all noticed, all the maids looked like exotic models!  And we think they might have actually been real French Maids!  What we loved about the location was that McDade‚Äôs Pub was directly across the street, and we made it our nightly stop to chat with the locals and our new friend the owner and bartender.  Also, as we stepped out the door and walked to the main street, we were immediately in the hustle and bustle of the high scale shopping district.  The worst thing I can say is that it was the first hotel in our trip, and no others even came close to measuring up!

203,"Location, Location, Location","The Westbury Hotel in Dublin, Ireland is an excellent hotel if you want to be in the heart of the shopping district.  This five star hotel located on Grafton street is within walking distance of  many tourist attractions,Trinity College and the best shopping.  Bewley's restaurant is also a great place for lunch or a snack.

203,The Best Location!!,"We stayed at the Westbury in July 2006 and really enjoyed it.  The location is unbeatable, right on Grafton street, close to all of Dublin's great sites and shops.  We arrived early on an overnight flight from the USA and we were given our room, which, though small, was clean and comfortable.  After a 2 hour nap, we were off to see the sites.  The bed was especially nice.  Cannot beat complimentary valet parking, good bell staff and a very nice complimentary breakfast.  Much better location than the Four Seasons though not as fancy.  I would recommend the Westbury to anyone visiting Dublin either on business or holiday.

203,A five star (fingers crossed!) hotel,"Fri Aug 25th 2006
 
We live close to Dublin and we escaped for the night to celebrate our tenth wedding anniversary leaving the children at home with a babysitter. We decided to try the Westbury because of its central location but it was a bad decision and I'll tell you why. 
 
If you are widely travelled you'll realise generally hotels in Ireland are playing catch up with the international hotel scene and no where in Dublin is this more apparent than at the Westbury.
 
The gentleman who accompanied us from our car in the underground car park to the reception was most polite and created a good first impression. 
 
Reception staff were friendly but after check in the illusion created by their promise of staying at 'one of the Leading Hotels of the World' soon fell to pieces.
 
We showed ourselves to our room which was a suite on the sixth floor. Opening the door the first impression was that it felt very cold and that the ceilings seemed very low. (I'm 6 foot and I'd estimate the ceiling couldn't have been more than 8 foot). The lighting was deplorable and the long life bulbs used in the lighting appliances made our skin look jaundiced!
 
The room and bathroom were spotless. There is no tea or coffee making facilities and the view was of the Dublin skyline which was nice. Noise insulation from traffic was very good. 
 
We had expected some form of congratulations (perhaps a flower, or a glass of sparkling wine or a personal note) fom the hotel management, but not a dickie bird - still no worries.
 
We were going to dine in room but as the room still hadn't heated up and as we could not find a room service menu or any hotel directory anywhere we decided to go downstairs. Perhaps they didn't offer room service? On our key tag they recommended the Sandbank restraunt for dinner. There were only about 8 people in the restraunt which is unusual quiet for a Friday night in Dublin. Food was nothing to write home about and we'd give the experience a 6 out of 10.
 
Upstairs on the terrace a pianist was playing and as the Sandbank lacked ambiance we decided to have our after dinner coffee on the terrace. The waiter came over and we ordered two cups of cappuccino. He asked us was two cups of coffee all we wanted so we mentioned we had dined downstairs in the Sandbank and that a coffee would be fine. It was probably a language communication problem. Only one coffee arrived but when we pointed out the error the other arrived a couple of minutes later.
 
Turndown was a chocolate (Lilly O'Briens) placed on the bed and slippers wrapped in plastic. There were no bottles of drinking water left by the bed or in the bathroom which we thought was most unusual.
 
I'll skip quickly through the next chapter and its now 7am!
 
Bang on the button at 7am, there was a knocking two or three doors down from our room to the left ' Your Wake Up Call' Knock Knock slightly louder ' Your Wake Up call' KNOCK, KNOCK ....
 
08:30 a few doors to the right - knock, knock, knock - 'Laundry'. KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK 'Laundry'. I took in the newspaper which was hanging on the door. 
 
09:05 On our door - Knock Knock 'Accommodation'. KNOCK, KNOCK 'ACCOMMODATION' followed by our door opening and in comes a cleaning trolly to join our relaxation. Finding us in bed the cleaning trolly made a rapid escape as if it was a scalded cat. (my fault I didn't put the do not disturb sign on the door).
 
Breakfast was served until 10:30 as it was a Saturday.
 
Downstairs again we were directed to their 'light continental breakfast'. Now in all my travels around the world I've heard of every type of breakfast and I thought this might be a surprise and I was right. There was a trestle set in the top left of the terrace draped with a white table cloth and a sign 'for residents only' There was orange juice but no glasses. We asked for a decaf but were told they only had what was in the thermous flask or we could have tea as they had a boiler full of hot water and plenty of tea bags so you could make your own tea. 
 
There was no serving tongs for the crossants (here hoping the pastry chef had created something light but no you could have used them for paperweights) There were no serving tongs so it was select the best ones using your fingers. There were also slices of brown bread, butter and jam. 
 
We sat at a table and a waiter came along and put a banana on the table and then came back and took it away and put it on the table of the person sitting next to us. We all burst into laughter at the good of it. 
 
We went back to get our orange juice and still no glasses. I observed one guest obviously more pressed for time shrug her shoulders and proceeded to fill a tea cup with orange juice. Good idea.
 
At check out we were asked  if we enjoyed our stay. Being completely honest I said actually it wasn't what I expected from a hotel which warrented inclustion in the Leading Hotels of the world. Nor by any stroke of the imagination could it be a 5 star establishment. The receptionest asked if I wouldn't mind waiting a few moments to speak with the duty manager as feed back was noted and appreciated.

Price we paid v service = deplorable rip off.
 
The 'conference manager' whose card I still have was most dissappointed and admitted hotels had a lot of catching up to do especially compared to hotels in the US or Asia. She was very friendly and I thought my comments would help. I was promised follow up on Monday but the call never came so I guess I wasted my time. Hopefully sharing my experience with other Trip Adviser members will be a help. 
 
Having Molton Brown Handwash in your wash room just isn't enough to earn you five stars and next time there is a hotel inspection just keep your fingers crossed.

203,never be back,"stayed here along with another couple for a long weekend in june. it has been quite some time since the last time i had been here as i much prefer another hotel in the city but unfortunately it was full.  the decor is very tired and the rooms need a lot of redecoration.  the breakfast was awful it was set up in the main foyer of the hotel and was coffee out of flask along with cold croissants and wheaten bread that was taken out of the plastic wrapping in front of us and this is a five star hotel. to cap it alll there was 17.5% added to the bill that we were not informed of .  it is totally overated and i would not even tell my worst enemy to stay here no atmosphere at all and did not make any effort to make you feel comfortable. not for a relaxing weekend break. Just awful!!!
",2,2006,08,28
203,Very nice but...,"I never stay at 5-star hotels, but the Mercer Hotel was overbooked and sent me to the Westbury at no extra charge. The room was large and luxurious, the beds were comfortable. The car park with valet service was included; that was a wonderful convenience.  I have just two minor complaints. There was no hot water pot for tea or coffee in the room unless I wanted to pay 8 euros extra for it.  And there was a large floodlight on a ledge outside my room, aimed at the hotel. So I had to keep the drapes closed to keep the floodlight out, but the drapes did darken the room completely so I could sleep.
",4,2006,08,21
203,Very nice surprise,"Stayed here by accident really.  We we booked in for a birthday surprise at the Jurys Inn across town but it was double booked so we were upgraded free to this hotel.  Bit of a hike back across town with the bags but it was worth it.  The room was one of the best I have stayed in and the hotel was very plush.  Didn't eat there but did have too many drinks in the very nice Oriental bar!

Set back just of the main high st so very handy for everything.

Certainly would go back again and would even pay full price!
",5,2006,06,28
203,Afternoon Tea,"Went for the afternoon tea in the Terrace Room. Staff friendly and polite. Tea comprised one plate of sandwiches (3 quarters each), a plate of 2 scones each with butter, jam, cream and a top plate of 3 small cakes each. The tea itself was very good. Overall,a good experience. Mind you, at the prices - luckily paid for with a prize voucher, so it should be, 21 euro each with 12.5% service charge automatically added on top. 
Browsed at the Bar service menu to see what else was on offer. General hot/cold drinks seemed as expensive as you would expect in a 5* (4-5 euro for tea/coffeee), whilst the  range of wines on offer seemed very predictable with what looked like almost outrageous mark-ups.
",4,2006,06,15
203,Fantastic!,"We stayed at the Westbury over Easter 2006, also staying at the Clarence and the Conrad. The Westbury was by far the nicest, although we did pay extra to have a better room. The Easter lunch was fabulous, nicest meal i have ever eaten and the staff were lovely too. Never once did they make us feel like we 'shouldn't' have been there (unlike the other hotels we stayed at) and even when i was wearing jeans and trainers they treat you like royalty. Room service was expensive but very nice (i like a nice cuppa before bed!) and room was lovely. The bathroom was spotless (and i am VERY hard to please) the only tiny gripe i had was there was a stain on the bed cover, plus one night i had to go into the corridor at 2.30am to ask some guests to keep the noise down as they were making such a racket and were sitting on the floor in the corridor! But that's not the hotel's fault. Breakfast was lovely, staff were very helpful but not 'in your face'. Wish we'd have stayed at the Westbury for the whole trip as it was so lovely.
",5,2006,05,28
203,No major complaints,"Stayed here for two nights on business. It's not as good as the Merrion or the Four Seasons, but its not as expensive either. Location is great - right on Grafton Street and St Stephen's Green. 10 mins taxi ride to the IFSC if that's where you need to be. Staff were polite and helpful - needed a shirt pressed in 30 minutes because the ironing board / trouser press unit wasn't working, and it was no problem. Public areas are smart - rooms slightly tired and lacking in imagination, but it's a minor gripe. Would I stay there again? - yes, because no major problems and it's in the right place.

203,Great place to stay in Dublin.,"Stayed here on St. Patrick's Day weekend.  The hotel room was immaculate.  The service was fantastic with turndown service every night.  (We don't usually splurge on 5-star hotels so this was something new for us).  Grafton Street is right in front so you can shop easily.  There is a great pub called McDaid's right outside and a good Italian restaraunt called Little Ceasar's too.  The service was wonderful we arrived early and they were very accomodating.  We were told it would be an hour to get into the room and then it only took 10 min.  There is free wireless internet service in the business area.  The concierge was very helpful in arranging for a cab back to the airport.  Very near Trinity College and the National Museum.  Couldn't have asked for anything more.
",5,2006,04,01
203,"Great location, pleasant hotel","We spent 2 nights at the Westbury Hotel which is owned by the Irish Jury chain but part of the Luxury Hotels of the World. It is considered a 5 star hotel. 

It is located in the best part of Dublin. Right off the pedestrian street of the city called Grafton Street; the nicest street with the nicest shops. 

Also Trinity college is right near by. Also all the tour busses and the Temple Bar neighbourhood with many pubs and restaurants is also within a 10 minute walk. 

The lobby can be a bit noisy like a rail way station but in the morning it is very pleasant. We had complimentary breakfast in the lobby and the croissants were the best. Coffee and tea were also good. 

The room was very large and even included a separate part with a baby cot which was hidden by a curtain. We had 2 double beds and a sitting area.It was an Executive room. 

The regular rooms are much smaller but very nicely furnished. The bathroom was large and modern with 2 separate sinks. 

The view was not great and we heard noise from the pubs at night nearby but it did not really bother us. We slept very well and the chocolates they give you at night are large and very tasty. 

The rooms and the hotel are spotlessly clean. 

The rate is pretty steep at $300 a night (240 Euros) for a double room. We bought the room on Expedia and it was below the official rate. Also the official web site stated that all the rooms were booked. 

The front office staff were a bit distant and not overly friendly; yet polite. 

The restaurant staff who were all Eastern Europeans from Poland and Hungary were very friendly. 

The concierges were also friendly and helpful. 

We were able to use the hotel's internet service in the business lounge / office area. 

We did not eat at the hotel, except for breakfast. We regretted it as we had 2 bad dinners. The hotel dining room is very nice and the hotel has won awards. 

I strongly recommend the hotel.

203,Fantastic at Christmas time,"(young couple)
My husband and I stayed at the Westbury in mid December, Dublin is magical this time of year and full of christmas spirit.   The Hotel was very clean the staff were very professional and friendly and the standard of accommodation excellent, best central location in my opinion alongside the exclusive shops & quietier bars but only a two minute walk from temple bar & o'connell street.
Wake up call was on the minute and very reasonable price, however there are no tea or coffee facilities in the room, disapointing when you have a very early am flight home. (returning to Dublin second week in Jan to another Jurys doyle hotel)

203,Over rated....,"We stayed at the Westbury for our anniversary in December. This was our 2nd trip to Dublin and we decided to pay a bit more and have a 5* hotel. We were both really disapointed with the hotel and their bedrooms and found the staff and general atmosphere very ""stuffy"". The location off Grafton street is great but you would get better for your money elsewhere! After our first night we checked out and walked round to The Brooks Hotel in Dury Street where we stayed the 1st time we went to Dublin. This hotel is far better and the staff are far nicer! I have my own travel business and am very lucky to travel all over the world with my job, staying at all types and grades of hotels. I feel this one didn't deserve its 5* rating. It was such a shame as I just couldn't wait to leave.
",1,2006,01,03
203,Set your own alarm!!,"The bed was fine but Euros 280 for a single room seems a lot, especially when the hotel forgets the wake-up call which meant I had an adrenaline charged start to the day. As the hotel admitted to forgetting this 'detail', they offered me an 'free upgrade' with my next stay. No thanks. And they automatically added their 15% service charge to my VISA. 

I feel that everything should perfect at these prices. Stay clear!",1,2005,11,27
203,Loved the Shelbourne,"Great 5 Star hotel in heart of Dublin's attractions. 1/2 block off Grafton Street, easy  walk to Book of Kells, Gaiety Theatre, shopping, and much more. True 5-Star experience. Our favorite place in Dublin.

203,"A Very, very good hotel","As I write this, I am staying at the Westbury.  I have found the hotel to be satisfactory in all respects and would suggest that anyone seeking a hotel in central Dublin stay here.  Upon arrival, reception was quick and efficient and showed me to a room on the fifth level overlooking the entrance. Noise was not an issue however at any point.  The room was just a fraction on the small side, but most rooms in central Dublin are I have found.  The bath was also small with the dreaded shower/tub combination, but the water was hot and the water pressure good. Located in the very heart of things, I was able to walk wherever I needed to go and could catch the new tram line, the LUAS, to where I was working from St. Stephen's Green. Temple Bar was just a few blocks away and the Merrion Square area likewise but in the other direction.  All in all, it is a good value and whilst it will not knock you over, it is a very, very good hotel.  I would stay there again.",4,2005,09,16
203,Best hotel in Dublin,"Stayed in the Westbury for 4 nights in mid-August.  It is the BEST located hotel in the city, right off Grafton Street, THE shopping area of Dublin, slap bang in the middle of everything - shops, restaurants, clubs, LUAS.  Ate in the Russel Room restaurant on one night - three course meal for two with wine came to EUR170, including the annoying 15% service charge mentioned by a previous reviewer.  Restaurant staff were very friendly and efficient and have no problem tipping them but I wonder how much of the 15% if any goes to them.  Half bottle of wine was roughly EUR20.  My red half bottle was delicious - and at the perfect temperature.  The meal was worth every penny though - food is fabulous.  Breakfast is expensive though at EUR27 per person.  It is a self service buffet offering usual - croissants, pastries, freshly squeezed juices, yoghurts, fresh fruit, cereals and cooked Irish breakfast.  Very nice but not really worth the money.  Local restaurants that open early have to be better value.

Everyone in the hotel was extremely courteous and friendly.  I cannot fault the staff at all.  Manager came to ask me if everything was ok.  Car park was full but guy on front door parked it for me.  Bags taken to room.  

Beautiful and plentiful Molton Brown products in bathroom.  Face cloths provided too.  Choclates on pillow every night.  Room was good size, beautifully decorated and very comfortable.  Big double bed, air conditioning, safe, iron (not steam though). trouser press, minibar, desk, armchairs and table.

Afternoon tea in the lobby is absolutely fabulous.  It is very popular.  Great food, piano player is great too.  It costs about EUR25 per person but well worth it.  You can stay for hours.

There is a gym but didn't get to check that out.

I agree with previous reveiwer that outside can be noisy - Saturday night WAS very noisy outside.  Best to ask for room at the back.  I've stayed in many hotels in Dublin - Morrisson, Fitzwilliam, Shelbourne, Jury's, Stephens Green - none are a patch on the Westbury.  I recommend using the company's website for the best deals.  We paid EUR179 per room per night and that included the 15% service charge.  Highly recommended.",5,2005,08,29
203,Great Location Real treat,"Stayed in the WESTBURY in Dublin for 2 NTS on 23RD August 2005.
The location is brillant,just off Grafton Street and within walking distance of everything.The car parking facilities were one of the selling points of the Hotel,with car parking prices in Dublin the free parking is a real plus.
The Hotel is spotlessly clean as one would expect from a 5star,the service exceptional especially the young man who was on the front door.I booked this from Jurys website eur176.00 per room per night ,not bad for a  central hotel.The down side to my trip was the service charges 15% does not incline you to tip too much.A Latte and Cappacino room service was 15.00eur a little too steep.Had an excellent meal in the bistro 2 courses no wine came to 70.00eur with service charge included.My view was lovely overlooking Grafton Street and the new Phil Lynott statue,but at night this area was very lively and noisy,so maybe it would be better to forgo the view for a quieter room in the back of the hotel.As a Travel agent I realise that 5 star is expensive 55eur for breakfast for 2 is a little too dear.
The westbury has a location thay must be the envy of many hotels,nice rooms lovely Molton Brown products in the Bathrooms,but I may start saving to stay there again.

203,Great Dublin Hotel,"Great location just a half-block from Grafton Street! This was our first trip to Dublin for my spouse and I celebrating our wedding anniversary and we found the hotel to be nicely appointed and very clean, especially the bathrooms. The service was great but the biggest plus about the Westbury is its location....just minutes from anywhere you'd want to explore.
",4,2005,08,09
203,"Five Star Location, Three Star Service","We enjoyed our stay at the Westbury. We were there for the weekend of 15th/16th July 2005 after booking through Expedia. The actual room contents varied quite a bit from the Expedia website promises. No clock radio (unless they count the TV which had radio channels), no Sunday complimentary newspaper (just Saturday), no fax machine, bathroom TV or bidet. I‚Äôm not going to knock of marks off on this review as I‚Äôm sure (I‚Äôd hope) Jurys own website must provide a better inventory by room type. Also we weren‚Äôt there to spend time in our room so none of those items were essential to our two night stay.

We chose The Westbury because of it‚Äôs location in the heart of the City Centre. We fancied a bit of 5 star luxury and it‚Äôs well located between the Temple Bar area and Baggot Street. So it just beat the Merrion which was a similar price.

The hotel has an impressive frontage as you walk up from Grafton Street into Harry Street. Service at Reception was swift and our keys had been pre-prepared for our arrival. First impressions of the room were good with the turndown service and chocolates on the bed, slippers ready (btw one size does not fit all) on a linen mat on each side of the bed. My wife was pleased to see the Molton Brown toiletries. There was also a set of scales. We did like the large choice of crystal glasses. The mini-bar was relatively inexpensive; if not a great deal choose from. The bed was comfortable but probably a generous double or smallish queen at best. Plus the pillows weren‚Äôt the best in the comfort stakes. It was a relatively spacious room (by European standards) but slightly smaller than I expected.

We had the complimentary light breakfast on the Sunday. Very much emphasis on the ‚Äúlight‚Äù here, not even fruit juice available ‚Äì just tea, coffee or water! There was bread but no evidence of a toaster. So we just had a croissant and some fruit. They probably want to get people in to the dining room to pay for a ‚Äòfull Irish‚Äô but we were only after something quick before a day out.

Having a nightcap in the lounge before bedtime was a painful experience. On both days we sat down only to be ignored by the pair of busy staff providing the table service. It was less than half full but they did seem to be struggling. On both days we ended up going to the bar after waiting around 15 minutes to see if we could catch their eye. Then it was another 5 to 10 minutes before anything arrived. They did apologize and say they were ‚Äúlow on staff‚Äù.  I choose a five star hotel to have the requisite number of staff to provide a minimum level of service. It‚Äôs especially baffling as they were charging roughly double to the local pubs, many that were still open outside. So they‚Äôd surely not struggle to pay one or two more staff up to say 2am as these two must be run off their feet or very inefficient. Both times we couldn‚Äôt be bothered to stay for a second round. I thought this was an isolated incident until Sunday evening. Then we were picking up our bags to go back to the airport only to find the bell staff had gone AWOL. I eventually coaxed a reluctant receptionist to help me find them, as I was getting anxious about missing the next Aircoach.

Overall it‚Äôs a nice hotel but the service needs to be brought up to a five star level. I just wonder if they save their best levels of service for their mid-week business customers.  I‚Äôd consider coming back to the Westbury but next time we‚Äôre weekending I think we‚Äôll try the Westin as it gets good reviews and is also in a great location (as we kept passing it while out and about). If we were staying for longer I‚Äôd consider the Merrion as it had an indoor pool.

203,Loved the Westbury,"Husband and I (in our 30s) stayed here last Aug for 3 nights.  We LOVED the hotel, especially the location which is in the heart of Dublin in a section with streets permanently closed for pedestrians.  There are great restaurants, pubs, stores within walking distance (and new tram had just opened).  It was really convenient to walk to EVERYTHING.  The hotel itself was lovely, though we didn't spend too much time in the room.  The bar is swank and we had lots of fun.
",4,2005,06,08
203,"Good Hotel, Great Location","This is an up-market Hotel just off Grafton Street in the centre of Dublin. Rooms excellent with good service all round.   Continental breakfast a little on the stingy side.   

This Hotel would suit business travellers or adults on short breaks - not really a Hotel where children would feel comfortable.  Having said that, I'm not sure we'd recommend Dublin as a City for children at all.
",4,2005,06,05
203,Fantastic Hotel,"We spent a wonderful four days in April, 2005 at this hotel. We went with another couple, and were all agreed that it was probably the best hotel we had ever stayed at. We have been going away for weekend breaks together for the past 20 odd years, both in England, and other parts of Europe. It would be difficult to fault the service we received at this hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We would particularly like to thank Enda Cunningham, the deputy General Manager, who made us very welcome.

Our rooms were spacious, and very well appointed. The restaurants and food were of a high standard, and we really enjoyed coffee and scones in the Lounge Bar overlooking Grafton Street. The location could not have been more convenient for the shops, bars and restaurants in the city centre.

We would highly recommend this hotel as a suitable venue for a weekend break in Dublin.

203,Children not welcome,"Children not welcome !
Visited the Westbury hotel bar with our children aged 12 and 9 on a recent visit to Dublin. To our surprise we found that the hotel does not extend the famous Irish welcome to children, at least not at 5-30pm the evening we visited. We would strongly discourage staying at this hotel, particularily if you have children.
",2,2005,05,10
203,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here for a weekend and thought it was a great hotel.The location is fantastic,walk out the front of the hotel and you are on Grafton Street.The staff were friendly and the attention to detail in the room was excellant.Try a cocktail in the bar,they are well worth the money!
",5,2005,04,17
203,Loved It !,"We stayed here in January for my 40th birthday. Excellent service all weekend,try afternoon tea in the lounge overlooking Grafton Street or a champagne cocktail in the Oriental Bar.
    Pure luxury though you are paying through the nose for it ! I didn't want to leave so it was worth every penny.
    ",5,2005,02,13
203,A Frosty Reception,"The location of the hotel is ideal for shopping or sightseeing and there is a free car park in the basement.   The Terrace Lounge must be one of the most attractive and comfortable rooms in any Dublin hotel.    Overall, however, we were very disappointed with our stay.    Arriving at the Westbury on a cold December afternoon we found that the heating in our room had been switched off.   The system was complex and the instructions were hidden in a drawer - so it took a long time to bring the temperature up to a reasonable level.    Not a good start.    The absence of a hospitality tray did not help to cheer us up.   The Westbury hides behind the myth that 5-star customers prefer not to make a hot drink for themselves, but in reality they just want to force guests to use the expensive room service.    Deciding to freshen up before going out for the evening we found the plug in the washbasin was broken making the basin unusable.    And, in line with this lack of attention to detail, one of the lamps needed the bulb replaced.    Next morning we partook of the light breakfast which is included in the room rate - though described as complimentary.   It was certainly LIGHT- no toast, no juice, no yoghourt, no cereal, no prepared fruit.   Basically a plain croissant and a cup (no pots) of tea or coffee with the possibility of a piece of unpeeled fruit.    MEAN would be a better description than light.
",2,2004,12,18
203,Nice touches at the Wesbury,"I have stayed at the Wesbury several times over the past 2 years.  The location is second to none in Dublin.  It is just off Grafton street. Has a free underground parking garage and if rooms are available will allow you to check in early.  My husband and I have arrived at 9 AM and been allowed into our room.  The rooms are comfortable and nicely appointed.  The Molton Brown soaps and lotions are luxurious.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone.  The rates do vary.  I would check the Jury's website often.  The Full Irish Breakfast is quite expensive, but the continental breakfast in the lobby is nice.  The lounge is a fantastic place to relax with friends and family. Get there early in order to get a table. It is especially lovely when the pianist is playing.
",4,2004,10,16
203,Very friendly staff,"I stayed at the Westbury last May, 2004.  I have since stayed at many other Dublin hotels (Clarence, Westin, Fitzwilliam) and have realized that the friendly service found at the Westbury is difficult to match.  I loved the staff and spending time in the hotel lobby area having tea while looking out on Grafton Street.  The atmosphere was great  and the location cannot be beaten if you are looking for a city center hotel.  The room was lovely, if a little traditional in decor.  I would absolutely stay here again and appreciate this hotel even more now that I can compare it to others.
",4,2004,10,09
203,Overpriced and Overrated,"I suppose I am to blame for booking accommodation in the Westbury, one of the most luxurious¬†five star Dublin hotels, and a member of Leading Hotels of the World to quote from their own website. 
I was aware the the price of ‚Ç¨185 and indeed the it would be subject to a service charge of 12.5% however I expected a level of service that matched the price.
To find chewing gum stuck below the bathroom sink and a used facecloth under the towels does not match the image. The fight outside my bedroom door that woke me at 4.30 am was not the hotel's fault but could have been handled better. The ""light breakfast"" that was included in the price consisted of self-service tea/coffee and a croisant. Not so much as a glass of orange juice! What could justify the service charge of 12.5%? Irish hotels are generally expensive but this one took the biscuit. Never again!
",2,2004,09,20
203,Great location,"Great location! Treated very well at the Westbury. Concierge was great, housekeeping turned down the bed at night. A little pricey, but very nice.
",5,2004,08,11
203,Top Hotel In Dublin!,"You can't get a better hotel in Dublin than the Westbury.  The location is second to none, while the amenities are top notch.  The rooms are well appointed and the full Irish Breakfast gets you off to a good start.  5 ***** all the way, you won't find a better choice for the price.
",5,2004,07,20
203,Great Location,You cannot get a better spot that the Westbury for location - right in the middle of Dublin's high street shopping. Great hotel also if you have a car - there is a free underground carpark attached. The first floor lobby is a great meeting place for afternoon tea or a drink.Can be excellent value too - check the Jurys website.,4,2003,12,26
203,Loved the Westbury,"My, 87 year old aunt and I enjoyed every minute of our stay. We enjoyed the scrumptious goumet meals served very elegantly at The Sandbank Bistro. However, we especially liked Afternoon Tea and cocktails in The Terrace Lounge listening to favorite tunes played by a delightful piano player. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. The service was impeccable. The location simply added to the enjoyment of our vacation.",5,2003,10,02
203,Really loved the Westbury!,"Can't beat the location and comfort of this wonderful hotel. We enjoyed a beautiful room here. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We really wanted to stay here for the location but it's not cheap--surprisingly, we got an excellent rate through the hotels website--check often because the rates fluctuate--I was about to give up when the 300 pound per day rate dropped to 140--this included breakfast, taxes and fees!",5,2003,09,22
203,We would stay again!,"There were 10 of us staying at the Westbury in Dublin and every one loved it. We all agreed that if we were to return we would stay there again. The location is excellent and the service was wonderful. All of our rooms were spacious and the beds very comfortable. The baths had plenty of room, the elevators were prompt and fast, and the continental breakfast in the lounge was lovely. The buffet in the restaurant was also excellent. It was a wonderful experience.",5,2003,09,09
203,Centre of Excellence,"This is an excellent hotel for shopping in Dublin. Only minutes from the main thorough fare. Service is exemplary. Having had to wait two minutes for a drink in the bar, I was offered it for free. Rooms are clean, airy and have great beds. Public reception areas plush but lacking in character.",4,2003,04,14
203,Excellent service and fantastic location,"Excellent location and fantastic service for this 5-star hotel located in the commercial center of Dublin.
The service and attention of all the staff is fantastic.
The room (Studio Suite) is very spacious and has a large bed. The bathroom needs to be renovated because it is small.
The closet doesn't have much space either.
The internet fails constantly.
Small but important details.
The hotel is beautiful with exquisite decoration in the different restaurants.",4,2023,12,09
203,Meet with friends,"I hadn't been to Ireland for a long time and wanted to meet up with old friends. For this special occasion, we wanted a particularly nice place and so we chose the Westbury. The decision was spot on! The ambience is both classy and cozy. We particularly liked the extremely friendly service - thank you, Christina M.!! I have very fond memories of the conversation with you. As a Japanese person, I can recommend the Matcha Latte, which tasted very authentic.",5,2023,11,16

Elegante e pretenzioso non regge l'affollamento del pubblico che accede per i servizi del bar e sala pranzo. Il servizio √® scarso, la qualit√† e la presentazione delle portate molto scarsa, mentre il prezzo √® posizionato ai livelli degli hotel 5 stelle.

203,Sch√∂nes Hotel mit perfekter Lage,"Nach unserer Rundreise waren wir noch zwei N√§chte im Westbury in Dublin. Die Anfahrt mit dem Mietwagen gestaltete sich als eher schwierig, durch die engen Strassen voller Fussg√§nger. Aber am Hotel angekommen durften wir unseren Wagen kurz stehen lassen um einzuchecken. Der Concierge k√ºmmerte sich um die Koffer und das Auto. 
Das Zimmer der einfachsten Kategorie war sch√∂n, sauber und die Betten bequem. 
Leider sind die Zimmer ziemlich hellh√∂rig. Die T√ºren knallen zu, was Nachts und morgens st√∂rend war. Es gab ein permanentes Grundger√§usch von den Klimaanlagen-Ausg√§ngen vor unserem Fenster. Andererseits ist die Alternative (n√§mlich zur Strasse raus) wahrscheinlich nicht viel besser. Aber damit muss man rechnen wenn man zentral wohnen will. 
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war hervorragend. Es gibt ein tolles Buffet und zus√§tzlich noch die Auswahl von warmen Speisen.

203,Bad Hair Days oder f√ºr vier Sterne w√§re es ausreichend!,"Hotels in Dublin sind teuer und eher m√§√üig, warnte mich ein Kollege. Das Westbury macht da leider keine Ausnahme. Eine ruhige Junior-Suite f√ºr gut 500,- ‚Ç¨ die Nacht sollte es werden, d.h. f√ºr 3500,- ‚Ç¨ f√ºr 7 N√§chte. Die Fotos auf der Hotel-eigenen Homepage  sahen stylisch und modern aus. Bei der Ankunft wurden wir mit der freundlichen Information empfangen, dass wir ein Upgrade f√ºr eine Suite erhalten hatten. Nunja, es war eher eine laute Butze mit l√§rmender Klimaanlage und Diskothekenl√§rm aus der Nachbarschaft bis tief in die Nacht. Warmwasser? Ja, gibt es nach langem Warten - in Intervallen! Lichtschalter? Wenn man lange genug probiert, findet man den richtigen Schalter, der das Licht um die Ecke regelt. F√∂n? Gibt es, aber die Steckdosen f√ºr den F√∂n sind von Spiegeln maximal entfernt. Man bekommt die Haare nur im Blindflug trocken. Toilette? Eine unbel√ºftete Telefonzelle. Bar? Der Bar-Keeper mischt einen Standart wie den New York Sour nach Rezept; zum ersten mal, wie er sagt. Dann vergisst er vor dem Servieren eine Probe zu nehmen und merkt nicht, dass ihm das Ges√∂ff zu flach geraten ist und die Zitrone alle anderen Aromen platt macht. Zeitung am Morgen? Wurde angeboten, aber nicht ausgeliefert. Kleine Aufmerksamkeiten des Hauses, wie z. B. eine Willkommenskarte oder ein kleiner Obstteller oder ein kleiner Blumenstrau√ü? Komplette Fehlanzeige! Nein, das Westbury ist kein Westin, kein Waldorff Astoria und ganz sicher kein Leading Hotel of the World. Immerhin das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist ok.

203,Stadtmitte ist das einzige Highlight,"In mehr  als 10 Jahren als Leaders Club Mitglied  habe ich nur zweimal ein Hotel, wie das Westbury, am Anreisetag verlassen um umzuziehen. Das Westbury ist mitten im Fussg√§ngergewusel sehr zentral in Dublin.

Bei Ankunft um 11.00 Uhr vormittags war ein Riesendurcheinander und das Personal offensichtlich der Situation mit ab- und anreisenden G√§sten nicht gewachsen. Der Empfang in einem 5-Sterne Ort stellt man sich nicht wie ein Jahrmarkt eines Robinson-Ressorts vor.  

Wir hatten Early check-in beantragt und konnten nach einigen Stunden Wartezeit eine Viertelstunde f√ºr offizieller Eincheck-Zeit das Zimmer im 5. Stock beziehen. Der Superior-Raum war sehr eng und das  Badezimmer mit Dusche in der Badewanne etwa so wie in einem Holiday-Inn.

Auf die Frage, was das rote Licht am Telefon bedeutet, dr√ºckte die uns begleitende Hotelmanagerin auf den Kn√∂pfen rum und murmelte etwas.

Mitten in einer Skype-Videoschaltung begann jemand im Nachbarraum zu duschen. Das ist eigentlich in jedem Hotel ein Ereignis, das gar nicht wahrgenommen wird.  Die betagte Sanit√§rinfrastruktur im Westbury hingegen ist bei Klosett-Sp√ºlung und Dusche sehr laut. Ein Mangel, der nicht einfach mal so behoben werden kann und dem man am besten  aus dem Wege geht und auszieht.

Im Vergleich mit allen drei LHW-Hotels in Dublin ist das Westbury die schlechteste Wahl: Management und Infrastruktur sind mangelhaft.",2,2018,02,18

203,Pudiera mejorar algunos detalles. ,Estuvimos alojados en el hotel desde el dia 02 de agosto al dia 07 y si es verdad que las habitaciones son grandes y c√≥modas y tienen detalles como colocar bombones todas las noches en la habitaci√≥n y caf√© y/o te gratis tambi√©n es cierto que en el ba√±o hab√≠a ciertos detalles que por el precio que se paga no se justifica. Por ejemplo en la tapa de la poceta le faltaba uno de los topes. En  lavamanos habia un error de dise√±o con las llaves del mismo ya que estaba muy pegado al borde  y cada vez que se usaba los lavamanos se botaba toda el agua sobre el tope y corria al piso. Igualmente el techo de la ba√±era  un pelin manchado y  el rodapi√©s del mueble del lavamanos desgastado ,3,2016,08,10

Sauber, immer sch√∂n hergerichtet und die Obstschale war ebenfalls toll. Die Hotelbar ist besonders f√ºr Whiskeyliebhaber besonders gut best√ºckt, auch hier wird einem jeder Wunsch erf√ºllt, das Restaurant 'Wilde' bietet jedem Geschmack die perfekte Speise.

Die Zimmer sind hell und die Betten von sehr guter Qualit√§t. Auch findet man auf dem Zimmer eine Nespresso Kaffeemaschine mit den dazu geh√∂rigen Kapseln, sowie ein Wasserkocher mit diversen Teebeuteln. Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet bietet sehr viel Auswahl, man hat aber auch die M√∂glichkeit, kostenlos diverse √† la Carte Gerichte zu bestellen. Leuten, die nicht so gerne alles auf dem kleinen iPhone sehen wollen, stehen auch zwei hauseigene Apple Computer kostenlos zur Verf√ºgung. Das WLAN ist ebenfalls gratis. Auch hier ist das Personal international, sehr gut geschult und wie man dies nicht anders von Irland gewohnt ist, sehr freundlich.

203,Me decepcion√≥.,"Esperaba m√°s y mejor de este hotel. Un hotel no puede basar su elevado precio √∫nicamente en su buena ubicaci√≥n. Nos dieron una habitaci√≥n con ba√±o adaptado para discapacitados, lo cual hac√≠a que se inundara cada vez que us√°bamos la ducha. La cisterna tampoco funcionaba bien. La habitaci√≥n peque√±a, con demasiado mobiliario para su tama√±o. Las vistas fe√≠simas y las camas estrech√≠simas. Para colmo, la √∫ltima noche hubo ruidos de obras (martilleos y taladros) desde las 12:00 de la noche hasta temprano de madrugada. Aunque al quejarme el personal del hotel me escuch√≥ muy atentamente y se disculparon posteriormente por email, el mal estaba ya hecho. No hubo manera de descansar bien aquella noche. Para m√≠ el descanso en un hotel es fundamental. Posteriormente me he alojado en otros hoteles de Dubl√≠n no tan caros, pero mucho mejores en mi opini√≥n.",3,2015,09,10
203,"Super Preis-Leistungs Verh√§ltnis. Sehr sch√∂n, sauber und exquisit.","Im August 2015 bin ich in Dublin zwecks Citytrip gewesen. Schon im Vorfeld habe ich mich auf das Hotel, da es sich ziemlich gut pr√§sentierte.
Wir waren zu 3t (2 Frauen, 1 Mann) unterwegs. 
Schon als wir ankamen, wurden uns vor der T√ºr die Koffer abgenommen (sp√§ter dann ins Zimmer gebracht). An der Rezeption wurden wir mit warmen Erfrischungst√ºchern empfangen. Unser Zimmer war schon an unserer Ankunft, um 13:00 Uhr, bezugsfertig.
Wir hatten ein Doppelzimmer, in dem sich 2 Queen Betten(sehr gem√ºtlich) befanden. Das Zimmer war super gross und sehr sauber, genauso wie das Badezimmer.

Man kann nicht wirklich etwas Negatives gegen das Hotel und dessen Konzept sagen.
Ich pers√∂nlich fand es nur schade, dass es keinen Spa Bereich gibt. (Fitness gibt's, kann ich jedoch nicht bewerten, da nicht benutzt) Dieses kleine Manko wird jedoch von der super Hotellage und Gastfreundlichkeit wett gemacht.
Alles in allem ein super Hotel mit gutem Preis-Leistungs Verh√§ltnis.",4,2015,08,30
203,Excelente hotel,"Excelent√≠simo hotel en una ubicaci√≥n perfecta, cerca de todo. La atenci√≥n es perfecta de cada persona que te atiende. La habitaci√≥n, a pesar de no ser grande, es c√≥moda. El desayuno es muy bueno y bastante variado",5,2015,08,29
203,No era lo esperado,"Como comenzar este comentario.
El hotel esta muy bien ubicado, la estructura es muy buena y su personal discretamente correcto.
El desayuno, el que lo tenga incluso es muy bueno, por ahora al sofitel ja. James de Londres no le gana nadie, pero esc muy bueno.
Ahora si esta gente evaluar√° el dinero que uno paga para acceder a estos hoteles deber√≠an ver de que manera le agregan 5 metros m√°s a las habitaciones. TANTO DINERO POR TAN POCO ESPACIO???
Sr. gerente del hotel, estoy en la habitaci√≥n 212, lo invitar√≠a a Uds, ya que parece que el jefe/a de piso no lo ha notado, en mi lavatorio hay que poner una peque√±a toalla por que si no el agua desborda hacia el piso y sacarle tambi√©n la tapo del lavatorio d√©bito a q el agua no escurre como debiera. 
Ni hablar de tomar un caf√© en el bar del hotel 5‚Ç¨. Car√≠simo!!! Y fr√≠o. 
Pero eso se soluciona no yendo m√°s.
Ahora lo de la habitaci√≥n por el precio que uno paga es muy mala relaci√≥n precio/producto.
Se√±ores para mi humilde entender, est√°n muy lejos de alcanzar la excelencia.
Es un buen hotel, extremadamente caro!!!

203,"Una experiencia sumamente gratificante.Una faro de buen gusto,cordialidad y comfort","Mas conozco los hoteles de la cadena Doyle Collection, mas me convenzo en que superar lo superlativo de la calidad de estos hoteles es casi imposible.En este caso, el Westbury Hotel es un claro ejemplo.Ya hab√≠amos quedado impresionados con el Bloomsbury Hotel de Londres, pero nuestra experiencia en este hotel de la ciudad de Dublin, super√≥ todas nuestras expectativas.El personal sumamente amable y bien predispuesto en todo momento, pendientes de querer ayudar en todo lo necesario para que su estad√≠a sea mas que placentera.La cordialidad, el respeto y por sobre todo el buen humor de todo su personal, son dignos de destacar.
Las habitaciones son amplias y con un dise√±o exquisito.Equipadas con todos los amenities que uno puede esperar de un hotel de esta categor√≠a y aun mas, como por ejemplo, una cafetera nespresso, t√©, un frigobar con muchas variantes de bebidas, golosinas, etc.
El room service es impecable y se encargan que adecuar su habitaci√≥n para que su descanso sea placentero. Su ubicaci√≥n, es dir√≠a yo, inmejorable y a pesar de estar a pocos metros de la muy concurrida Grafton Street, los ruidos no llegan a la habitaci√≥n.
No hay excusas para no elegirlo.Si su pr√≥ximo destino es Dublin, y desea que su viaje sea completo, el Westbury Hotel lo tiene todo para que as√≠ sea.

Zumindest unser Zimmer war trotz zentraler Lage sch√∂n ruhig. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist sehr reichhaltig und es gibt eine grosse Auswahl.

Die T√ºr zum Flur war kein L√§rmhindernis (man nimmt teil an den Abschlussgespr√§chen nach dem Weihnachtsball, den Kommandos der Putzkolonnen, der guten Laune frisch erwachter Kinder...). Das Hotel liegt in absoluter Innenstadtlage. Gut, f√ºr Leute die Dublin zu Fu√ü erkunden m√∂chten. Nicht gut f√ºr Leute, die das mit ein wenig Ruhe vebinden m√∂chten.

203,Gro√üe Klasse im Dubliner Zentrum,"Im Fr√ºhling 2014 waren wir zu viert √ºber 4 N√§chte im Westbury Hotel in der Grafton Street, einer der wichtigsten Einkaufsstra√üen der Stadt.
Wir hatten zwei Deluxe Rooms, welche sehr sauber, elegant und stilvoll eingerichtet waren. Es war alles sehr sauber und auch das Badezimmer lie√ü nichts zu w√ºnschen √ºbrig.
Besonders erfeulich f√ºr uns war die Nespresso-Maschine, die in jedem Zimmer zu finden ist.
Beim Fr√ºhst√ºck wurden wir sofort und sehr h√∂flich platziert und nutzten gleich den Zugang zu dem ausgezeichneten und sehr vielseitigem Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet.
Doch auch der warme Fr√ºhst√ºcksappetit (Pancakes, Waffles, Ham & Eggs, etc..) wurde schnell gestillt. Die sofort zubereiteten Speisen waren alle exquisit und lie√üen den Tag perfekt starten.
Beim Durchgang durch den Lobby-Bereich staunten wir auch √ºber den edlen Look.
√úber das Abendessen kann ich leider nichts berichten, da wir nur √úbernachtung/Fr√ºhst√ºck gebucht hatten, um die kulinarische Vielseitigkeit in div. Restaurants in Dublin auszutesten.
Tipp meinerseits: Bobo's Burgers, sehr frische, megaschmackhafte Burger mit verschiedensten Beilagen und ungew√∂hnlichen aber sehr leckeren Drinks.
Ich w√ºrde bei einer erneuten Dublin-Reise ohne zu Z√∂gern wieder das Westbury w√§hlen, da wir rundum sowohl mit dem Angebot, als auch mit dem Service zufrieden waren.",5,2014,10,31

Allerdings kann ich nach diesem Aufenthalt im The Westbury mit Sicherheit sagen, das der versprochene Anspruch nicht zu 100 Prozent dem Gast vermittelt wird.

Positiv

Der Luxus besticht von der Lobby bis zu der Suite

Herzliches und professionelles Personal an der Rezeption inclusive Doorman und den Mitarbeitern im Restaurant Caf√© Novo

sehr gute Speisenauswahl in puncto Qualit√§t und Kreativit√§t bei beiden Restaurants inclusive sehr gutem Fr√ºhst√ºcksb√ºffet. Besonders der hausgemachte Yoghurt mit Frucht und ger√∂steten Cerealien sind ein Traum

Status als GHA Black Member erkannt und gew√§hrt. Somit war das Upgrade zur Suite sowie  Early check in und check out ohne Probleme m√∂glich. Der Wunsch nach einer deutschen Tageszeitung / FAZ wurde erf√ºllt. Herzlichen Dank hierf√ºr nochmals.......

Mitarbeiter von der Rezeption haben sich immer an den Namen des Gastes erinnert ohne das er seine Zimmernummer erw√§hnte. Auch erw√§hnenswert ist der m√§nnliche Mitarbeiter (graue Haare) im Caf√© Novo, welcher vorbildlich und die Erwartung an die Hotelkategorie sowie der Herzlichkeit zum Gast wirklich zu etwas besonderem machte bzw. erf√ºllte. Auch ein nettes Lob an die gro√üe weibliche Mitarbeiterin (schwarze lange Haare mit Zopf) am Counter und Service in der Lobby/Gallery. Diese hatte mich immer mit meinem Namen und der Frage nach dem Wohlbefinden erkundigt!

Negativ

Suite 602 hat starke Gebrauchsspuren in den M√∂beln......die Fernbedienung des Fernsehers welche nicht vom gleichen Anbieter ist, befolgt die Befehle nur nach mehrmaligen dr√ºcken der Tastenbefehle.

Die stark frequentierte Stelle im Hotel ist die Lounge / Gallery sowie angrenzende Marple Bar. Hier ist das gr√∂√üte Defizit in puncto Service zu sp√ºren. Von wenigen weiblichen Mitarbeiter einmal abgesehen, ist ein ""warm welcome"" Gef√ºhl nicht zu sp√ºren. Besonders die m√§nnlichen Mitarbeiter fallen hier besonders negativ auf. Mitarbeiter auf der Management Ebene begr√º√üen Stammg√§ste recht herzlich. Allerdings vergessen diese die G√§ste am Nachbartisch zu gr√º√üen.
Dieses Verhalten konnte ich permanent beobachten........
Auch wird die Hektik noch durch Mitarbeiter durch z√ºgiges Laufen beschleunigt.
Den Anspruch an Doyle Collection sowie der Leading Hotel Philosophie wird die Gallery hier nicht gerecht.

Das Fr√ºhst√ºck beginnt mit hektischen Mitarbeiter in dem Wilde Restaurant, ohne jeglichen Grund. Die Menge an G√§steaufkommen steht in keinem Verh√§ltnis zu der aufkommenden Hektik der Mitarbeiter. Auch hier vermisste ich das ""Herzliche Willkommen"" seitens der Mitarbeiter f√ºr den Gast.

Choice of amenity wird erst nach zweimaliger Aufforderung auf das Zimmer gebracht. Der warm welcome letter erfolgt in 08/15 Druck ohne Name des Gastes seitens General Manager........sehr schwache Leistung! Inspiration f√ºr nette Worte geben gerne die Kollegen von dem Croke Park Hotel. Hier erhielt ich im Gegenzug ein paar Zeilen handgeschriebener Worte vom General Manager. Der Anspruch des Gastes auf der h√∂chsten Ebene des Kundenbindungsprogram ist anders als der Individualgast welcher keinerlei Pr√§ferenzen unter Ber√ºcksichtigung seiner Reisen an ein Hotelverbund stellt!

Fazit:

F√ºr den Gast der Luxus ohne zu hohe Anspr√ºche stellt wird hier mit Sicherheit gl√ºcklich und zufrieden seinen Urlaub verbringen. Es erf√ºllt allerdings nicht die Erwartung an ein Leading Hotel. Desweiteren kann es zum Vergleich an ein Adlon Kempinski oder St. Regis nicht den Anspruch an durchg√§ngigem Service seitens aller Mitarbeiter im Luxussegment erf√ºllen. F√ºr mich als Gast war nach diesem Aufenthalt die Erkenntnis gekommen, das auf der h√∂chsten Mitgliedstufe von GHA das Hotel sowie der Hotelverbund meine Anspr√ºche an Individualit√§t nicht erf√ºllen kann. Somit ist mein Anspruch Individualit√§t und Luxus letztendlich nur bei Small Luxury Hotels zu finden.",4,2014,05,04

Scelta azzeccata sia per la posizione centrale sia per lo charme della struttura.
Camere confortevoli e pulite gentilezza del personale ed accoglienza hanno reso ancor pi√π piacevole il nostro soggiorno.

203,Da evitare!!,"Sono stato due notti in questo hotel.... non c'√® nulla che sia andato come avrei pensato per essere un hotel a 5 stelle. Sono arrivato e le valige hanno tardato ad arrivare in camera e ho dovuto chiamare la reception per farmele portare. Avevo chiesto esplicitamente un fornetto a microonde durante la prenotazione per scaldare la pappa di mio figlio ma in camera non mi hanno fatto trovare nulla. Ogni volta dovevo andare al ristorante con il piattino farmelo scaldare e tornare in camera. Avevo chiesto un seggiolone durante la prenotazione e non me lo hanno dato, allora l'ho chiesto alla reception e mi hanno detto che provvedevano subito, la sera ho chiamato ancora e mi hanno detto che me lo avrebbero portato la mattina seguente... il giorno seguente ancora niente.... ho richiamato la reception e mi hanno detto che in mezzora l'avrei avuto e non me lo hanno portato... alla fine sono sceso io dal concierge e ho aspettato li finch√® non sono andati a prenderlo!!!! che delusione per un hotel con 5 stelle! ma andiamo avanti.... in camera c'erano molte rifiniture da sistemare, una luce sul soffitto mezza storta, dei fili della corrente arrotolati sotto la scrivania.... la scrivania era macchiata.... ma continuiamo.... sono andato al bar per un cocktail... non vedendo camerieri all'orizzonte vado al bancone ad ordinare... quanto viene la cameriera al tavolo con i drinks mi accorgo che il mio martini era sbagliato ma quando lo dico alla cameriera lei con fare arrogante mi dice che me lo sono ordinato da solo e che era quello che avevo chiesto perch√® lei non aveva preso l'ordinazione.... io gli ribadisco che il drink non era quello che avevo ordinato ma lei continua a dirmi che mi sbaglio e me lo devo tenere. una maleducata di questo livello non l'ho mai incontrata... allora vado con il drink al bancone e il gentile barista si scusa e me ne fa uno corretto. un atteggiamento veramente scostante di molti dipendenti, specialmente al bar .... camere piccole e non pulite, tenute male e da sistemare il molte cose.... non ci metter√≤ mai pi√π piede e in nessun altro hotel doyle.. gli unici gentili sono stati il concierge e i camerieri del ristorante. mai pi√π.",1,2013,08,16

203,Ottimo soggiorno,"Siamo stati in coppia presso questo hotel dal 1 al 5 agosto 2013. L'hotel e' situato in una posizione strategica in quanto si trova a 50 mt da Grafton Street che e' il cuore di Dublino.
Pertanto e' possibile accedere a tutti i mezzi di comunicazione per visitare la citta' in pochi minuti. L'hotel e' ottimo e offre camere di alto livello come lo sono anche anche il ristorante, il bar e i salotti di  trattenimento . Prima colazione molto varia e di ottima qualita'. Tutto il personale si e' dimostrato estremamente disponibile e gentile. Unico neo sono le pulizie della camere che, nonostante sia stato fatto presente dopo il primo giorno, avvengono anche alle ore 3 del pomeriggio  non consentendo pertanto di utilizzare la camera ripulita prima di quell'ora. 
Inoltre nell'albergo, senz'altro di elevato livello, e' strano notare che il personale alla reception parla  quattro lingue ma nessuno parla la lingua italiana. Nel complesso la bellezza dell'albergo ripaga questi piccoli inconvenienti.",5,2013,08,11

Auch ansonsten ist man zu Fuss √ºberall gleich schnell. Temple-Distrikt ca. 10 min zu Fuss.
Zimmer sehr sch√∂n, die B√§der sind tats√§chlich renovierungsbed√ºrftung. Wird aber schwer werden diese in 5**** zu verbessern, da sie doch recht klein sind.

Centralissimo, praticamente sulla Grafton street e a pochi passi dal TrInity College dove ferma il bus proveniente dall'aeroporto. La camera era praticamente una quadrupla con due bei letti queen, biancheria finissima, credo della Frette. Bollitore e macchina Nespresso ,accappatoi, ciabattine, fon decente, prodotti da toeletta ottimi completavano la fornitura della camera. Ogni sera cioccolatini e al bisogno ti rifacevano i letti.

A colazione c'era un'ampia scelta sia di cibi dolci che salati. Alla reception erano disponibili e gentili. Lo consiglio a chi ama sentirsi coccolato anche in vacanza!

203,Non l'ho trovato un grande hotel: non un 5 stelle,"Purtroppo non riesco a condividere i giudizi favolosi su questo hotel per cui l'avevo scelto! Condivido con gli altri viaggiatori il giudizio esulla posizione strategica nel centro di Dublino a poco da tutto ci√≤ che √® importante vedere. A pochi passi da Grafton Street la via dello shopping e il Trinity College. Con una passeggiata di 5 minuti si arriva a Temple Bar. Il servizio molto attento e gentile da parte di tutti. Detto questo, per√≤, devo dire che l'hotel in s√® non mi ha entusiasmato per nulla e non proprio all'altezza di un 5 stelle parte della The Doyle Collection di cui ho visto altri hotel ben pi√π belli. Nella hall, piccola, al primo piano non c'√® una poltrona dove sedersi ed attendere altre persone. Se uno vuole deve sedersi accanto in una sala caff√®, ma se non si vuole prendere niente non ci si pu√≤ sedere. Gli ascensori due in un hotel molto grande e pieno di gente, quindi lentissimi. La stanza non grandissima, diciamo di media grandezza, un letto descritto come King, ma che era un semplice letto matrimoniale e scomodissimo. Ho avuto il mal di schiena per tutti i giorni di permanenza. Appena ti muovevi fluttuavi come sull'acqua, ma non era un materasso ad acqua! La stanza pulita, ma vecchiotta, da rimodernare sembrava di essere negli anni '60 ma non per scelta di stile. La carta alla parete del letto staccata e agganciata al muro tramite le grappette; le applique sul soffitto che pendevano; la cassetta di sicurezza bloccata; e c'era muffa sotto il lavandino e un bagno senza una presa per il phon. I dettagli non erano affatto curati. La mattina, poi, venivi assalito da molto presto da un odore di uovo e altro cibo che entrava in stanza credo tramite l'aria condizionata su cui probabilmente fuoriesciva lo scarico dei fumi delle cucine: ti svegliavi con la nausea! Inoltre avevo chiesto una stanza tranquilla e mi hanno dato la stanza accanto all'ascensore e alla stanza riservata al personale delle pulizie e l'armadio delle lenzuola e degli asciugamani, con un trambusto che dura tutto il giorno. Insomma visto il tipo di hotel e il costo, mi sarei aspettato molto di meglio. Poi per un 5 stelle ha ben poco da offrire in quanto a servizi che non siano il ristorante e il centro congressi.

203,Buen hotel con un punto agridulce,"He estado dos veces en este hotel.
La primera, todo bien.
La segunda, cinco d√≠as m√°s tarde, merece la pena explicarlo. La reserva fue realizada mediante la central de un conocido club de hoteles. Nuestra reserva incluia desayuno, regalo de bienvenida, y upgarade sujeto a disponibilidad. Al llegar a recepci√≥n nos atendi√≥ una persona sin m√°s inter√©s que realizar su trabajo de una forma muy neutra. Le pregunte si hab√≠a sido posible realizar un upgrade y con cara de poco inter√©s respondi√≥ que no era posible. En vista de su atenci√≥n, quisimos confirmar que el desayuno estaba incluido, a lo que respondi√≥ que no. Le tuvimos que aclarar que si lo estaba, a lo que √©l nos solicito la tarjeta y despu√©s de consultarlo nos inform√≥ que s√≠ lo estaba, pero √∫nicamente el continental.
Subimos a la habitaci√≥n, y vimos que no estaba preparada como en la anterior ocasi√≥n. Estos peque√±os detalles nos hicieron dudar de la disponibilidad de habitaciones de categor√≠a superior, por lo que consultamos su disponibilidad, comprobando que realmente hab√≠a.
Decidimos bajar a exponer el asunto y reclamar el cumplimiento de nuestra reserva.
Por dos veces, la persona de recepci√≥n, nego la opci√≥n de atender el cumplimiento de nuestra reserva y ante nuestra insistencia, traslado el asunto al director del hotel.
El director insisti√≥ en la no disponibilidad de habitaciones de categor√≠a superior, a lo que insistimos en que podiamos realizar la reserva de esa habitaci√≥n y que informariamos de la incidencia a la central de reservas.
Despu√©s de una conversaci√≥n que dur√≥ unos minutos, el director nos propuso alojarnos en dos habitaciones superiores con una √∫nica cama (nosotros necesitabamos una habitaci√≥n con camas separadas), a lo que accedimos gustosamente.
Finalmente resolvieron bien el asunto, si bi√©n es una l√°stima el haber tenido que insistir tanto en algo que contratas. Al d√≠a siguiente el director nos busc√≥ en el desayuno para interesarse por nuestra estancia, detalle que fue de agradecer.
En cuanto al hotel, en general todo muy bi√©n, la limpieza, el mantenimiento de las instalaciones, decoraci√≥n neutra y muy correcta, la situaci√≥n es excelente, la atenci√≥n del personal (a excepci√≥n del recepcionista de la segunda ocasi√≥n) merece una alta calificaci√≥n, la relaci√≥n calidad precio muy buenas. En definitiva, un muy buen hotel.
Como punto negativo, y sujeto a mi criterio, el acceso hasta recepci√≥n no se corresponde con un hotel de esta categor√≠a. Para acceder a la recepci√≥n por la entrada principal, debes subir un piso y el espacio entre la puerta de entrada giratoria hasta la escalera, no est√° bien concebido. Me di√≥ la sensaci√≥n que entrabas a un edificio en el que adem√°s hab√≠a un hotel, m√°s que el de entrar a un hotel 5*.
Tendr√© en cuenta el hotel en futuras estancias en Dubl√≠n.",4,2012,05,01
203,Assolutamente eccellente !,"quando siamo in visita di affari, normalmente si tende a trascurare l'aspetto piacevole della permanenza, presi pi√π che altro dalla necessita' dei risultati pratici della visita.  Nonostante cio' in questo albergo non puoi fare a meno di notare, il lindore che ti sta intorno, ossia l'estrema pulizia ma anche lo stato di eccellenza di ogni oggetto ; sia esso il tavolo di camera sia gli specchi dell'armadio a muro, sia la poltrona ,per non parlare della cura dei letti e della stanza da bagno. Personale molto qualificato e gentile, attento a farti sentire sempre a tuo agio. Ristoranti in house piu' che all'altezza con prezzi piu' che competitivi.
Grande buffet per colazione, costo 25 ‚Ç¨, ma ti consiglio di evitarlo per non farti male!

La posizione e' magnifica. Se vuoi mangiare una pizza ottima in un ristorante italiano, esci dall'Albergo, fai dieci metri e volta nel vicolo a destra e troverai pizza e pasta come puoi mangiare in Italia. In Grafton Street trovi il meglio del meglio, da MS food, ai principali dipartmet Stores. In 15 minuti raggiungi O'Connel Street > Henry Street dove devi visitare
ARNOTTS, la cui architettura moderna ricorda vagamente le Galeries Lafayette non Art Deco'. Infine, vorrei sfatare assolutamente il mito di Dublino ""citta' cara""; non e' affatto vero.

Beispiel: Entleeren von Glascontainern. Des Weiteren wird die Stra√üe auf der R√ºckseite des Hotels von Sp√§theimkehrern genutzt.

Doorman, Rezeption, alles war perfekt (bis auf den Fakt, dass wir nicht zum Zimmer gef√ºhrt wurden). Die Zimmer sind zwar nicht riesengro√ü, aber das macht der Charme wieder wett. √úber die Sauberkeit brauchen wir nicht reden, die ist bei den Hotels der LHW-Gruppe immer top. Das einzige , was etwas st√∂rte, ist die etwas drucklose Dusche (vielleicht ein Einzelfall?). Wie auch immer, wir kommen gern wieder.",5,2011,10,27
203,Gutes Hotel in Spitzenlage!,"Die Lage des Hotels ist unschlagbar, optisch nicht unbedingt. Der Lift ben√∂tigt ewig, die Zimmer sind klein aber sauber. Minibar vorhanden, gratis Internet aber duschen nur in der Badewanne, WC im Badezimmer und alles sehr klein. Service sehr gut, aber der Standard ist nicht Leading Hotel of the World w√ºrdig.",4,2011,09,23
203,G√§ste mit hohen Anspr√ºchen,"Mein Bruder und ich verbrachten 2 wundersch√∂ne Tage im Westbury Hotel Dublin. 
Wir unternehmen sehr oft Sightseeing Trips in den verschiedensten St√§dten, dabei √ºbernachten wir eigentlich immer in Leading Hotels of the World (LHW), da wir einen gewissen Komfort nicht missen m√∂chten. Dementsprechend hoch sind auch unsere Erwartungen und Anspr√ºche. 
In diesem Hotel wurden wir nicht ent√§uscht.

Folgende Abteilungen m√∂chten wir gerne bewerten.

Rezeption: 
Sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. TOP. Leider, kein Rooming bekommen. Die Zimmer findet man aber sehr gut.

Concierge: 
Ihr habt uns sehr gute Tipps f√ºrs Sightseeing und Restaurants gegeben. Haben nichts vermisst. Thanks, Eddie and Paul! You did a great Job !!!

Doorman: 
So einen Mann braucht ein 5***** Hotel. Gerry, sehr zuvorkommend. We like! 

Service Lounge: 
Waren zum Afternoon Tea in der Lounge. Das einzige was wir negativ zu bewerten haben. Mussten erst eine Ewigkeit warten bis wir bedient wurden. Und dann war der Service auch noch extrem schlecht. Wir glauben ein indischer Herr welcher uns bediente hat uns einfach die Rechnung ohne einen Kommentar HINGESCHMISSEN ohne das wir diese √ºberhaupt bestellt hatten. Sowas macht man einfach nicht! Habe wir auch noch nirgens erlebt. Oft bleiben die negativen Erlebnisse mehr in Erinnerung als die Guten und wenn wir uns die Bilder von der Lounge ansehen, m√ºssen wir halt an diese Situation zur√ºck denken. Soll aber den positiven Gesamteindruck des Hotels nicht mindern. 

Housekeeping: 
Kompliment, sehr freundliches Personal. Unser Zimmer war immer mehr als sauber aufger√§umt und wieder hergerichtet worden. Da, haben wir schon ganz andere Hotel erlebt. 
Die Zimmerm√§dchen haben wirklich ein riesen Lob verdient. Wir w√ºrden Sie sofort einstellen!

Zimmer 305: 
Sehr herzig, mehr als grossz√ºgig und stilvoll eingerichtet. 
Die Betten waren ein Traum. Haben wie auf Wolke 7 geschlafen. Wieder zuhause angekommen habe ich sofort dieses super weiche Bett vermisst! 

Verbesserung Zimmer: Die Telefone k√∂nnten durch moderne evtl. schnurlose Telefone ersetzt werden. Hatten leider auch keine ipod Docking-Station im Zimmer und das Hotel TV k√∂nnte auch mal ein update vertragen. Ist ein bisschen kompliziert ;o)

Restaurants:
 n/a waren ausw√§rts essen 

Fazit: 
Wir kommen 100%tig gerne wieder. LOVELY HOTEL !!! 
Thank you for all your assistance, we really enjoyed our stay.",5,2011,09,22
203,Eccellente posizione,"Ottimo hotel, magnifica la posizione, al centro del centro di tutto, raggiungibile a piedi in pochi minuti; anche i Docklands si raggiungono con una piacevole passeggiata a piedi.
Buono il buffet della prima colazione, con un supplemento si possono ordinare piatti caldi dalla cucina, preparati al momento per voi. In camera, oltre al bollitore elettrico e tisane varie e t√®, c'√® anche la macchina per il caff√®, abbondantemente servita e rifornita di latte, e zucchero grezzo. Nell'armadio, asse da stiro e ferro. 
E' un albergo che consiglio.",5,2011,08,28
203,Sehr sch√∂nes und komfortables Hotel in zentraler Lage,"Auch wenn das Westbury von aussen nicht viel darstellt - es ist zwar ein gro√ües Haus aber aus meiner Sicht architektonisch reizlos - ist es perfekt f√ºr den Kurztrip nach Dublin geeignet. Die Zimmer sind sehr sch√∂n und ausreichend ger√§umig, das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist in Ordnung und die Lage ist 1A - alles ist zu Fu√ü erreichbar. Ob Temple Bar, Trinity College oder ein anderes Ziel - in wenigen Minuten ist man da. Der Zimmerpreis ist nicht billig aber angemessen!",5,2011,06,29
203,Tolles Hotel an der Grafton Street,"Nicht nur die hervorragende Ausstattung dieses Hotels ist der grosse Pluspunkt, sondern auch die ideale Lage in der Innenstadt von Dublin (nur wenige Meter von der Grafton Street). 
Ebenfalls positiv zu erw√§hnen ist das sehr freundliche Personal, vor allem der Concierge-Service. Ichwurde immer gut beraten und die erteilten Tips waren Gold wert.",4,2011,04,22
203,"Ottimo hotel, zona centrale, personale Cordiale.","Sto ancora alloggiando in questo hotel, ma merita assolutamente la mia recenzione, in quanto mi sono trovata davvero bene. L'hotel √® posto in una zona centralissima di Dublino, a pochi passi dalla zona pedonale e dalla via dello shopping.
Ha al suo interno 3 diversi bar-ristoranti, per tutte le tasche e per tutte le esigenze. Ha una bellissima gallery da dove si pu√≤ bere il th√® con una stupenda vista sulla stradina dello shopping. Uscendo dall'hotel si ha tutto a portata di mano. La mia camera ha 2 letti singoli (comodi e grandi) anche avendo chiesto una singola perch√® viaggiavo da sola, una zona per il relax con due poltroncine e una zona per il business con scrivania e cavi per il pc. Ho alloggiato al terzo piano. Ho dormito bene. Bagno pulitissimo e con set di cortesia completo. La sera (dopo cena) si trova la camera rifatta con tappetino per terra, ciabattine e dolcetto. Stracomodissima la connessione WIFI gratuita, che ho apprezzato molto. E una sera solamente ho richiesto la cena in camera, e anche qui, nulla da obiettare.
Personale cordialissimo.
Consigliato.",5,2011,03,23
203,5-Sterne-Luxus im Herzen von Dublin,"Durch eine Fehlbuchung in unserem eigentlichen Hotel wurde ich und ein paar meine Kollegen f√ºr 2 N√§chte in diesem Hotel untergebracht. 
Da es sich um die Nacht auf Samstag und Sonntag handelte, kann ich nur sagen, mir hat nichts besseres passieren k√∂nnen. Das Hotel ist wirklich mitten in Dublin (50m von der Haupt-Einkaufsstrasse) und wir hatten direkten Zugang zum Nachtleben von Dublin. Anschliessend konnten wir dann in unseren komfortablen, perfekt l√§rmisolierten Zimmern in die super Kingsize Betten fallen. 
Ich kann nur sagen, ein Erlebnis, das ich nicht so schnell vergessen werde.",5,2011,03,17
203,Super√≥ las expectativas,"Generalmente en Dubl√≠n iba al FitzWilliam, pero cuando paseaba por Grafton me llamaba la atenci√≥n este hotel. Cuando pas√© el aniversario con mi esposa en Dubl√≠n, pese a que el hotel en el que hab√≠a estado me encantaba, me decant√© por √©ste ya que ten√≠a un mejor precio (no significativamente) y mejores opiniones. Realmente, me pareci√≥ fant√°stico. En la reserva les coment√© que era nuestro aniversario y nos dieron una habitaci√≥n/suite maravillosa, con un peque√±o salon con un sof√° de piel y TV, Nespresso... A la habitaci√≥n no le faltaba detalle. La atenci√≥n y el servicio, geniales (pese a un peque√±o l√≠o que tuvimos a la entrada pero que fue totalmente justificable). Y el desayuno, muy bueno (si bien, el precio no merece la pena, esto pasa en todos los hoteles de Dubl√≠n). Recomiendo desayunar o brunchear en Elephant and Castle, en Temple Bar, no te va a salir mucho m√°s barato pero es un sitio estupendo (con las alitas de pollo m√°s famosas de Dubl√≠n).",4,2011,02,15
203,Gute Lage und sehr komfortabel,"Das Westbury Hotel in Dublin liegt fast direkt an der Grafton Street unweit des Trinity Colleges. Es eigent sich also hervorragend um vor hier aus die Stadt zu erkunden.
Es ist ein hervorragend ausgestattes und sehr komfortables Hotel, wir haben uns hier sehr wohl gef√ºhlt.
Zu bem√§ngeln gibt es nur ein paar Kleinigkeiten:
- Das Fersehen hat nur einen sehr schlechten Empfang
- Das Zimmerfenster l√§√üt sich nur kippen und nicht ganz √∂ffnen
- Das Waschbecken im Bad ist sehr niedrig angebracht (war nur unwesentlich h√∂her als meine Knie)
- Es gibt keine Handbrause in der Dusche",4,2011,02,13
203,Il migliore hotel di Dublino,"Siamo stati,io e mio marito, in questi giorni di Natale al Westbury Hotel e siamo stati benissimo. Centralissimo. La stanza spaziosa, luminosa e rilassante. Al piano terra c'√® la hall che √® enorme con tante poltrone, tavolinetti dove potersi accomodare a rilassarsi e godersi un'atmosfera piacevolissima (c'√® anche il caminetto sempre acceso) e poi magnifico dalle 15,00 alle 17,30 ci si prende il th√®, un p√≤ costoso 25,00‚Ç¨ ma almeno una volta vale la pena prenderIo, arrivate presto perch√® c'√® la fila. Consigliamo vivamente questo albergo ringraziando il personale veramente cortese e decisamente , professionale,  le cameriere rifacevano la stanza almeno due volte al giorno con grande premura; direi che la sensazione che abbiamo provato √® quella di essere coccolati da tutti e per noi √® quello che si richiede veramente ad un hotel a 5 stelle, io non me ne sarei pi√π andata via!",5,2011,01,06
203,"Top Lage, Top Betten, Freundlicher Service","Mitten auf der Grafton Street zu akzeptablen Preisen. Die Lage ist besonders gut, wenn man um die Grafton Street herum unterwegs sein mu√ü. Es hat die erforderlichen Pubs etwas abseits des Massentourismus zum Absacken vor dem zu Bett gehen in unmittelbarer N√§he.  Die Zimmer sind nicht √ºberm√§√üig gro√ü aber luxeri√∂s ausgestattet, so dass man auch mal gerne einen Abend im Zimmer verbringt, nachdem man um die Ecke bei M&S Foods ein paar Snacks gekauft hat. Eine Nespresso-Kaffemaschine geh√∂rt zur Standardausr√ºstung, so dass der morgendliche Kaffee gesichert ist. ""Aqua di Parma"" als Duschgel verleitet sicherlich viele G√§ste einmal die T√ºbchen mitzunehmen. Die Betten sind sehr gut und bequem. Die Klimaanlage ist nicht √ºberm√§√üig laut und l√§sst sich ausschalten. Die Zimmer sind je nach Lage ruhig. Wenn man ohne Fr√ºhst√ºck bucht gibt es eine kleine Kaffeebar im Foyer die zumindest einem Gesch√§ftsreisenden vollst√§ndig reicht am Morgen. Der Service ist f√ºnf Sterne Standard und man kommt morgens schnell raus aus dem Hotel. Alles pr√§chtig! Bin hier mehrmals im Jahr.",4,2010,12,27
203,Never disappoints,"Das beste Hotel f√ºr mich √ºberhaupt: stilvoll und in jeder Hinsicht einfach super. Die Zimmer sind super, nichts ist ausgefallen oder in irgendeiner Weise anstrengend designt. Eine bessere Lage gibt es nicht: direkt an Grafton Street, und doch ruhig. Wer kein Fr√ºhst√ºck mitgebucht hat, bekommt Tee/Kaffee/Geb√§ck in der Lounge. Immer wieder gerne.",5,2010,12,11
203,Perfecto,"Estuvimos alojados en el Westbury una semana y sin duda repetir√≠a. El servicio es impecable, as√≠ como la limpieza y el equipamiento. La √∫nica objecci√≥n es la limitaci√≥n en la comunicaci√≥n, ya que o dominas el ingles o tienes que realizar verdaderos esfuerzos para adaptarte al acento irlandes, por lo demas genial. Su ubicaci√≥n sin duda es perfecta. Quien quiera la garant√≠a de un buen hotel, con la mejor ubicaci√≥n que no se lo piense, ya sea para ir de compras o para visitar la ciudad, est√° en el lugar idoneo. La zona es muy tranquila y no hay problema alguno a la noche. Sin duda volver√©.",4,2010,11,27
203,Simplemente excelente.  Totalmente recomendable,"Estuve este verano 2 dias all√≠, y la estancia all√≠ fue perfecta. Realmente vale lo que pagas por √©l, ya que el servicio es inmejorable y la ubicaci√≥n perfecta, en pleno centro de Dublin, desde donde puedes ir andando a cualquier sitio.  El hotel es muy moderno y la habitaci√≥n que nos dieron bastante amplia, al igual que el cuarto de ba√±o, acorde a un hotel de 5 estrellas.

Llegamos un poco pronto y aunque nos ofrecieron una habitaci√≥n un poco peor a la que hab√≠amos pedido, decidimos esperarnos a que estuviera nuestra habitaci√≥n, por lo que dejamos las maletas all√≠ y fuimos a dar una vuelta.  Incluso tuvimos la necesidad de usar un destornillador para arreglar la maleta, y el personal de recepci√≥n se desvivi√≥ por conseguirnos uno.

En definitiva un hotel totalmente recomendable, tal que si volvemos a Dublin otra vez iremos all√≠ a alojarnos.",5,2010,11,02
203,Sehr komfortables Hotel mitten im City Center,"Positiv:
-sehr citynah, da direkt an der Grafton Street ( Haupteinkaufsstrasse)
-hier tobt das Leben-viele Pubs + Restaurants in unmittelbarer N√§he
-St. Stephens Green ( gro√üer Park mit Teichen+Kinderspielplatz) 2 Min zu Fu√ü
-Kaffeemaschine mit Kapseln, sowie Wasserkocher mit Tee kostenfrei im Zimmer

Negativ:

-durch Pub/Restaurantn√§he sind die Zimmer zu Stra√üe ( Sackgasse ) recht laut
-teilweise ist schlafen nur bei geschlossenem Fenster m√∂glich 
-bei so einem luxuri√∂sen Hotel fehlt einfach ein Schwimmbad",4,2010,07,01
203,Tolles Hotel,"Top Lage nur wenige Minuten zur Fu√üg√§ngerzone und vielen Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten
Gro√üe moderne Zimmer mit komfortabler Einrichtung.
Gute Restaurants mit exzellenten Angebot.
Der Service war sehr sehr gut. Sehr hilfsbereite und freundliche Mitarbeiter.
Kostenfreier Business Center.
Klasse Concierge.
Ich kann das Hotel jederzeit weiterempfehlen.",5,2010,06,08
203,Buen Hotel y  buen√≠sima ubicaci√≥n. LO RECOMIENDO,"Es un hotel 5*, en el centro de la ciudad, las mejores tiendas lo rodean, buenos pubs cerqu√≠sima, el centro de informaci√≥n tur√≠stica de donde sales muchas excursiones a dos pasos, y un personal muy amable.
Estuvimos 5 dias de vacaciones ( mi pareja y yo) no cogimos desayuno en hotel, nada m√°s salir est√° el Pub Bruxelles, su full irish breakfast es impresionante lo recomiendo!!
Est√° en pleno Grafton Street, para quien no conozca Dublin una de las calles con m√°s animaci√≥n durante todo el d√≠a, al lado de St. Stephen¬¥s green Park.
Restaurantes buenos alrededor del hotel.
La Habitaci√≥n bien, (hay que pensar que es un hotel de ciudad no un resort en el caribe), con m√°quina Nespresso sin cargo y para hacer t√© tb. productos Aqua di Parma en el Ba√±o y un personal de lo m√°s amable en Recepci√≥n. Pudimos imprimir  las tarjetas de embarque desde la zona de Punto deTrabajo del hotel y como sab√≠an que saliamos al d√≠a siguiente el d√≠a de salida coincidi√≥ que hab√≠a huelga de controladores ! nos avisaron a primer hora de la ma√±ana por si queriamos adelantar la salida para acercarnos al areopuerto para saber si podiamos salir en un vuelo anterior a la hora de inicio de la huelga!!!. No lo conseguimos pero fue un gran detalle por su parte.
No tengo ni una sola mala cosa que decir del hotel. Lo recomiendo!!
Ah , tb. recomiendo tomar un t√© en sus salones por la tarde despues de explorar la ciudad. Es super relajante!!!!",5,2010,05,14
203,Tolles Stadthotel,"Wir waren vom 28.05.2009 bis 31.05.2009 in Dublin und haben im Westbury Hotel gewohnt.  Das Hotel war uns von irischen Feunden empfohlen worden.  Unsere Erwartungen wurden voll erf√ºllt. Das Hotel ist gro√üz√ºgig und elegant. Das Personal war sehr freundlich . Das Hotel liegt wirklich sehr zentral.  Wir haben uns sehr wohl gef√ºhlt. Einziger Kritikpunkt ist, dass die Zimmer sehr hellh√∂rig sind, allerdings nicht vom Stra√üenl√§rm. Wir werden bei einem n√§chsten Aufenthalt in Dublin, das Hotel gerne wieder buchen, insbesondere das Angebot 3 f√ºr 2.",5,2009,05,31
