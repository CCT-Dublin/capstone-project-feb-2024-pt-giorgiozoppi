132,"Poor service, tired decor, thoroughly disappointed","As a loyal ALL Diamond Member we rarely stay in brands not in the group and didn’t deviate here. We wish we had!

Exceptionally poorly trained and rude and aggressive staff at reception

Concierge missing in action most of the time

Phones never answered when calling reception or room service 

Rooms and common areas very tired 

Poor drinks selection in the bar 

Courtyard super noisy - even up to 5th floor

First time never upgraded at property in the group 

Failure to get a taxi to get us to the airport meant we almost missed the train 

Great location about all it had going for it 

Much better out there for the budget

Avoid",1,2024,10,18
132,An eclectic mixture,"Never stayed here before , it's in a great location, but it looks like a Russian office bloke from the outside.  Inside the massive reception, you will find all oddments of bizarre furniture and net curtains.  Our room was huge for London standards and very clean. The only bugbear was the bathroom was divided from the bedroom by just a curtain, and the toilet cubicle was opaque . Tea and coffee facilities were in the room and unusually for London a proper minibar fridge. The bed was on the small side but very comfortable.  Breakfast was freshly cooked and the serving staff did there best on the really busy Sunday we were there. I think we would stay again if the price was right",4,2024,10,16
132,Used to be my favorite London Hotel,"I used to love the Sanderson. I always found the staff here so lovely. However, it seems it has never recovered from covid in a few ways.

The Purple bar off the, lobby was always a favorite of mine. It seems that that is no longer open and just a storage room which was disappointing. 

I arrived early. I know that early check in is a gamble. I called the day before and they noted my request. When I arrived in the morning the front desk informed me that they had rooms available but that they would be subject to a 30 pound PER HOUR check in fee. Since I arrived at 9am that meant 90 pounds. I did not get in to the room until 9:25am so that also really annoyed me that I paid for time not spent in the room. 

This policy is not stated on the website, nor was it communicated to me when I called the day before.  Had I known in advance I could have made alternate arrangements, but instead I was forced to pay this on top of an already expensive room.  What's more as I tried to nap in the morning, housekeeping barged in on my room and then ran way when they realized I was in it, disrupting the sleep I paid so dearly for. 
 

The rest of the stay was fine I still enjoy the rooms, but was disappointed there was no turn down service as there used to be pre covid. Sadly I have to say I will not be returning to this hotel in its new state as their are better options in this price range.",2,2024,10,14
132,Cold and Clinical,"A stark entrance awaits any guest coming to the Phillipe Stark designed Sanderson Hotel.
The staff were very friendly and after a quick check-in took the lift to the first floor to our room.  It overlooked the courtyard and due to the loud music we asked if we could be moved and thanked to the GM on duty, obliged and we were moved to the 4th floor.
Having two rooms, one can only assume they are all very similar.
They reminded us of a hospital!  All white, with a king bed offset from the wall at a jaunty angle, which left an strange uneasy feeling.  The vanity table also offset at an angle to the wall.  We're still not sure why, but can only imagine there is a poncy architectural spiel as to the reason why!?
The glass bathroom wall is separated from the bedroom by a surgical like curtain.  
It ultimately comes down to taste, but the room felt cold, clinical and minimal.  Neither of us slept well, with very thin walls to the lobby, hearing everything, to the point that on occasion we thought someone was trying to enter our room.  The angle of the bed also meant the room didn't feel comfortable and safe to us.
Some may like the minimal feel, but definitely feels like style over substance.",1,2024,10,13
132,Beautiful,"I have been coming to this hotel for years! 
The Bullard room with the stain glass window is incredible!
The long bar has a great menu with a beautiful courtyard garden adjoining.

The staff are amazing and the customer service is top notch.

The rooms are bright and clean with everything you need.

Perfect location! xx",5,2024,09,20
132,Best Birthday Weekend Ever!,"My partner and I stayed at Sanderson for his birthday weekend, and we couldn’t be happier with our experience! The hotel is stunning, with unique design, beautiful, clean, and spacious rooms. The staff went above and beyond, especially Sylvia at the front desk. She was fantastic—polite, professional, and made sure we got a late check-out for our celebration. She even sent champagne to our room with a personalized note, making us feel truly special! What a godsend she was! 
We will definetly be back for another stay! 
Thank you Sylvia!",5,2024,09,18

132,Sanderson,Good rooms and decent service. Spacious for a London hotel. The outdoor seating areas are made very well. The bar is also very nice and over the weekend it becomes a good place to socialise. The food is also decent. The location is the best. Oxford street is 1 min walk and all other good areas such as bond street and soho are walking distance. It was worth the money overall as the rooms are big and the location is lovely.,4,2024,08,02
132,Delicious food & fantastic service!,"What a fabulous restaurant to dine in. Food was absolutely delicious and big portions too!

132,Great service,"Fantastic service from Maria at check in, she was really welcoming and gave some great advice. Centrally located so easy to get to Oxford street for shopping but nice and quiet at night. I would skip the breakfast and head to a nearby cafe instead.",4,2024,07,22
132,Wonderful expirience,"We stayed for our anniversary and had an amazing time! 
Silvija who did our check in was fantastic! She sent us champagne and a card from the team to help us celebrate. The hotel itself is very hip and the bar has amazing drinks and DJs. Overall a fantastic and memorable experience! We will definitely be back",5,2024,07,15
132,One of London’s originals and still one of the best!,"An original and still one of the most iconic venues in London. Must visit bar! Very good service and while the rooms are a little faded, the high end design aesthetic more than compensates. Excellent buffet breakfast and conveniently located, without the noise of being in Soho.",5,2024,07,08
132,"Loved my stay, Maria is great!","Sanderson is a lovely hotel. Maria at the front desk is extremely helpful, she helped me with everything I needed in the hotel and great recommendations around London. Highly recommend staying here. Lots of nice bars and restaurants nearby.",5,2024,07,08

132,Five stars,"Great funky hotel in an amazing location secluded in a quiet street yet in the heart of London!
All the staff we encountered were amazing especialy Silvia and Veto on check in what a fun duo! 
Breakfast was fantastic but the service was a little slow
Separate honourable mention goes out to Tony who gave us a very warm welcome and helped us with our bags
 very clean and sleek design of the rooms and surprisingly large and spacious especially for a London hotel",5,2024,07,05
132,Antonella was very accommodating and looked after us very well!,Antonella was lovely and looked after me and my friends when we visited. The food arrived quickly and tasted amazing too. The ambiance is great and the service was incredible. I would recommend Sanderson to anyone who is considering to visit!,5,2024,07,05
132,Great hotel. Will probably stay again,"Great hotel. Perfectly located for work or leisure with easy access to shops, restaurants, cafes, tube and Regents Park. 
Staff are very nice. Bar staff particularly helpful and courteous. 
We had a larger room (not sure what it was called but the next one up from regular room) which was a good size for us. Size (sq m) is a major decision factor for us as we travel with large suitcases and also have to often both work in the room for long periods of time so the room was great. 
I didn’t care for the decor which was decidedly ‘form over function’ in some cases ie in the room and in the lobby. But it wouldn’t stop me from booking again. They have all the fundamentals right - good quality iron and ironing board, free water in room (maybe due to our Accor status tho so not sure), really good (not amazing)  breakfast and breakfast staff, large comfortable bed, nice toiletries, enough power points etc. 
Cons: our room faced the courtyard and the music could be heard until late. Not crazy loud but definitely cleared audible. Didnt stop us sleeping.",5,2024,07,04
132,Sanderson hotel stay,"The staff were very welcoming and accommodating right from the jump, especially the front desk where I met this lovely receptionist Shiv, she helped facilitate my stay and was very helpful. The room was clean and ready as soon as arrived, thank you.",5,2024,07,04
132,Thanks,"I recently stayed at Sanderson and had an exceptional experience, largely thanks to Maria at the reception desk. From the moment I walked in, Maria greeted me with a warm and genuine smile, instantly making me feel welcome. She was incredibly professional and attentive, handling my check-in efficiently and answering all my questions with patience. The staff’s friendly demeanor and outstanding service truly enhanced my overall experience.",5,2024,07,02
132,Great hotel in a great location.,"Just had a weekend break at The Sanderson in London.  Looks nothing from the outside but wow, what a visual experience on the inside.  The staff at reception (especially Shiv) were extremely helpful and efficient.  Great location for shops, transport and the theatre district.  Rooms were quirky and well appointed.  Would highly recommend.  Plus points - location and decor.  Minus points - breakfast (pretty average and everyone of our party of 6) were completely underwhelmed and the showers in the rooms which were difficult to navigate without making the bathroom into a swimming pool.",5,2024,07,01
132,London,"Back at Sanderson for a short London trip. Huge thank you to Maria, who was incredibly helpful during check in. She went above and beyond to ensure I was comfortable and gave me a complimentary upgrade.  What a wonderful way to start the trip. You are a true gem!",5,2024,06,29
132,Lovely hotel!,"Excellent staff, especially Maria at the front desk! Very professional and customer focused.

132,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE","Hands down the best hotel in London - from the welcome, super cool decor, amazingly comfortable bed and delicious breakfast - couldn't faul from start to finish.

132,An exceptional hotel experience,"From the moment we entered, we knew there was not better place to stay in London. The scent is beautiful, as is the decor. The staff at reception, Vito and Sylvia, were exceptional. Warm, welcoming and treating us to such an exceptional hotel experience. This was one of the best imaginable stays at a London hotel. We are longing to return and hope to be greeted by Vito or Sylvia again.",5,2024,06,26
132,Harassed by a security guard in front of my door room,"One of the worst hotel I’ve even been in my life
I was harassed and terrified at 4 am by a very rude security guy who knocked on my door room demanding me to open the door and accusing me of playing music in the middle of the night where in fact I was sleeping since 10 pm peaceful, he then said that a neighbor was complaining, why would the hotel receptionist at least call me on my room, how would I be safe to open the door for someone claiming to be hotel security and not a robber. This is totally unacceptable and I demand at least an apology",1,2024,06,22
132,Father’s Day,"Hotel very well located, close to Oxford Street and Hyde Park. I loved the hotel's style, with lots of art involved. We were warmly welcomed by Sylvia at check-in, who gave our baby a blue balloon that he loved and played with from the beginning of our stay until checkout. Sylvia was very lovely and got a new friend, Charlie! The room was very clean, thank you Rob and team! Jose and Rita from the restaurant were very attentive, the food was perfect, and breakfast was excellent! The staff made my husband's first Father's Day memorable!! Thank you for everything! We will definitely come back!",5,2024,06,17
132,Top class every time!,"Being regular guest of Sanderson, I thought I know what to expect from fabulous hospitality, but every time I come there is a new pleasant surprise;)  First time I had a little issue on a first night, but it was resolved extraordinarily. Emily and Anete - thank you for continuous top class hospitality. ;) my family’s favourite hotel in London.",5,2024,06,16
132,Sanderson arrival,"Very friendly and helpful welcome from Maria on reception. She made us feel very welcome.

The hotel is not that noticeable from the outside but very funky and distinctive on the inside. The central courtyard is lovely and tranquil. All the staff really helpful.",5,2024,06,14
132,Amazing hotel and kind staff!!!,Amazing experience entire staff was kind and welcoming especially maria at the front desk which accommodated our early check in without prior notice also all the other staff such as tony was very helpful in bringing our bags to the room and helping us get situated the hotel is in a great location and close to oxford street also the room is very clean and modern would definitely recommend if you are looking for a great stay,5,2024,06,12
132,Friendly staff and great location,"Very friendly service from everyone at the hotel, including room service and housekeeping.

Hotel is on a quiet street of Oxford, and is super convenient too.",5,2024,06,12
132,Always a great stay,"I’ve stayed at Sanderson many times over the years, but this visit was truly great! From the moment I walked in with my foul mood from a stressful day I was greeted with the biggest smile and warmest welcome from Silvia she was so positive and professional and in the 5 minutes of check managed to turn my whole day around! She kept me engaged and asked me inquisitive questions while doing her thing on the computer. 
Wonderful experience worthy of a positive review",5,2024,06,11

132,Fantastic check in,"Maria was fantastic - grate at check in. Really appreciated her assistance with early checkin. 

Staying for business am a regular customer. 

Would thoroughly recommend staying here if traveling on business. The reception is really cool vibe",5,2024,06,10
132,Triumph of Form Over Function,"The Sanderson is a ""stylish"" hotel in a great location.  The problem is that the hotel pursues style to the point that it interferes with the guest experience.  For instance, the lobby music, which plays many hours a day, permeates well beyond the lobby into the rooms.  So you cannot escape it even in your room.  This is a problem.  The bathroom layout is difficult.  Storage could be great....there is lots of floor space..... but the utility of the storage is compromised for the look.  The bathroom mirror lighting is poor.  The plumbing is beautiful to look at but does not work that well.  So while the room looks great, it just is not as functional as it could and should be.",3,2024,06,10
132,Lovely hotel,"I was doing early checkin with Maria and she was very friendly and she managed to find me a room early. I really appreciate her job! Really kind and lovely, loved the room very spacious and loved the design of the hotel!! Definitely coming back once again thanks Maria",5,2024,06,10

132,Quick Business Visit,"On a business visit and didn't spend much time in the hotel. However, the room was spacious, clean and comfortable.
Shiv on reception was the highlight of the visit, very engaging, friendly and professional. A great first impression of the hotel.",4,2024,06,09
132,Amazing vibe and location,"From the time we walked in the staff was welcoming and helpful. The vibe is relaxing and stylish. Enjoyed the garden and the pool table. Room was great, comfortable. Front desk team was very nice and helpful. Shiv and Vito and Maria when I checked in. The doorman was friendly as well.",5,2024,06,07
132,Amazing front desk team,"Elena and front desk staff have gone out of the way to fix the mistake made by my corporate travel provider.

132,Beautiful staff,Amazing Location walking distance from Oxford street. Rooms are designed good just building looks old. Checked in by Raul amazing guy  looked after throughout the trip . We had issue with Ac he immediately moved us to a good room and also helped us with bags. Will surely come back again,5,2024,06,06
132,Amazing hotel in a busy part of London!,The location is amazing just off Oxford street and near Tottenham court road station. Really easy to get around the city from here! Hotel is very chic and modern. We love it! Check in took a whole 30 seconds complete with a room upgrade thanks to Maria! She made our day on an overnight stay in London!

132,Great Stay,Great hotel fantastic location and lovely staff. Everyone is so friendy and attentive! The manager Silvija was so accommodating and personal she is a true asset to the Sanderson nothing was a trouble for her she even went above and beyond showing me around the hotel and showed me to my room explaining the amenities along the way. I’ve never met such a positive person who loves their job more in all my travels she always had a smile on her face. The sanderson will definitely be my go to place from now on,5,2024,06,04
132,Experiencia,"The rooms were very comfortable and the location was great. The employees were very nice to me and my grandparents. The shower was very good, I always hate bathrooms in hotels but I loved this one.  The only thing that could get better was the curtain, the room wasn’t dark to sleep sometimes.",5,2024,06,02
132,10/10,"Beautiful and unique hotel located conveniently within walking distance of Oxford Street, train stations and shops nearby. Really good breakfast but very slow service and passive staff members in the restaurant. The beds were very comfy  and the room was very spacious and clean. The decor throughout the hotel is very quirky and maybe not for everyone. We really liked the lifts they had space theme inside! I’ve never seen anything like that before. All the staff we came across were great and very helpful especially Silvija on check in she was super polite and professional",5,2024,06,02
132,"Style over substance, very disappointing","This hotel is a lesson in style over substance. Beds in the middle of the room with no plugs or charging points. Nowhere to plug in the hair dryer in the weird bathroom. The awful white curtains everywhere, and possibly the worst designed and most impractical shower I’ve ever experienced. It’s borderline bizarre. From the pitch dark lifts and dingy corridors, to the tacky sculptures and grim lighting effects, there’s an odd sense of sadness about this property.

I also found the staff pretty useless. The red haired guy who checked me in and out was outright unpleasant. Really needs to work on his customer service and people skills. 

Lastly, and perhaps above all. I booked this stay through Accor but got zero recognition for Platinum loyalty status. No upgrade, no welcome drink voucher, no personalised touches. I certainly won’t be booking here again.",1,2024,05,29
132,Good service.,"My stay at this hotel was pretty comfortable. I checked in pretty late at night and it was a smooth checking in the hotel with Raul. During my stay, however many times I called the front desk, everyone helped with a good attitude. All together it was a good stay.",4,2024,05,28
132,Excellent experience today,"I requested a room change on Sunday morning and spoke to Silvija at the front desk who immediately arranged a new room for me and was extremely diligent about communicating as to when the room would be ready and personally came up to help ensure everything was done smoothly and without issue. A superb, intelligent and thoughtful professional. As real asset to the hotel. I am here for a week and this experience has set a very good tone for my stay. I will likely extend my current booking and will certainly come back to the hotel again based on this interaction.",5,2024,05,26
132,A great visit,"Antonella, thank you.  Lovely afternoon served cocktails by you. Thank you for your warm welcome to the Sanderson Hotel.  We very much enjoyed our time here.

Excellent hospitality,  great service and a great range of cocktails on the menu !!!",5,2024,05,24
132,Darina best cocktail ever,"Bar was great do to Darina, best service ever! Drinks was spectacular and here eyes was like moon raiding over the Midnight medeterian sea on the cost of Mycanos. She was always smiling and giving the slights dents of flirt while the cocktail was doing its job.",5,2024,05,22
132,"Great stay, great staff","Great stay, Tony was amazing very helpful and kind, attended to our needs and showed us around the hotel.

132,A 5/5 stay!,"We had a great time in this hotel. Very well located, close to centers of interest and close to 3 metro stations. The room is very comfortable, clean and modern. Excellent bedding and pleasant staff. The breakfast is perfect, unlimited buffet + possibility of asking for other things. The hotel is quiet.

It’s a 5/5 for us!",5,2024,05,21

132,Birthday cocktails,"Visited The Sanderson yesterday for drinks in the long bar.
Experience was excellent for my friends birthday from the moment we got there TONY was very helpful and took fantastic photos of us both.
Cocktails amazing and presentation superb in the long bar, lady serving us even did a little cake for my friend’s birthday which was a lovely touch.
We be back again thank you 🙏🏻",5,2024,05,18
132,Poor service and staff attitude.,"Something about this hotel is off.
It’s in a good location and the rooms are comfortable but the staff are unprofessional, many with attitude problems.
With breakfast being included in my rate I also had the unique experience of the restaurant offering water at breakfast , then producing an invoice and pushing hard to charge £14 for water and service. 
I still have not heard back from the Director of Rooms after he promised to investigate.
The service and staff behaviour at this hotel are not reflective of a 5 star establishment.
The Fish rots from the head.",2,2024,05,15
132,"Excellent staff, location and rooms.",We had a great check-in experience thanks to Maria.  We were trying to decide between two rooms and she kindly showed us our options and around the hotel.  The room we settled on was excellent and quite large.  The location of the hotel can’t be beat and the staff were all great.  We will stay her again.  Thanks Maria and all the staff at the Sanderson.,5,2024,05,15
132,"Antonella, excellent service","Sanderson Hotel. Bar area. 11th May 2024. Saturday evening.

Antonella helped my wife and I. Excellent service in bar area. Helping us find table and arranging drinks, and making sure we has a lovely evening. Very engaging and aware.

Cheers Stephen and Anne.",5,2024,05,11
132,Thanks Shiv !,Such a calm and groovy space off Oxford street hustle.  Great cocktails and staff.  Amazing use of space and design throughout.  Shiv at reception exceeded all my expectations and hopes.  Really well trained and professional staff in all her interactions,5,2024,05,07
132,Memories at Sanderson,"We were so glad to have met host Vito. He attended to our needs with a lot of patience and we were very happy with our stay. From
Our check in to all house keeping servicws we were attended to with precision and warmth. I would definitely recommend this hotel to all coming with their family",5,2024,05,01
132,Glorious visit!,"Superb service given by receptionist. (Vito)
He went above and beyond the call of duty helping with my needs!
Always a special experience staying at Sanderson. 
The hotel is amazing, contemporary, cool and funky. 
The Long Bar is elegant.
A place to meet family and friends.",5,2024,04,30
132,"Great location, let down by couple members of staff","We chose Sanderson hotel for its excellent location and because we had celebrated my wife’s 30th at the long bar so thought it would be nice to come and celebrate her 40th.

We got checked in by Paola who was very nice, professional and great sense of humour. He knew we came to celebrate so handed us a coupe drink vouchers. There was another lady Maria who on check out was very polite and professional. 
I would like to say this was not the experience by two other front desk staff, I did not get their names but one was a blonde lady wearing glasses, very stern, not friendly at all. We asked her what time is check out and we had a response of “twelve”. No, “good evening Sir, check out is at twelve”, will that be all?”  Thank you and enjoy your evening. This was Saturday 27th April. Another person was a tall gentleman when we were checking out on Sunday 28th , did not catch his name but again  no professionalism at all, he did not ask if we had a pleasant stay or how was anything. When we came back to hand our room cards I handed to Maria who was lovely.
Another person who was polite thought out our stay, very professional and kind was Mo (Mohammed). He was the greeter and bell boy but went above beyond to ensure guests were comfortable and had a great time.
I urge management at the hotel to make this guy front of house and replace the two I mentioned above. With Paolo, Maria and Mo, the Sanderson hotel would see great reviews because them three are a power house front desk. Everything other person we interacted with were polite but unfortunately the two at front desk (blonde lady with glasses and tall guy with brown/ginger hair) made the experience not a 5 star rating.",4,2024,04,28
132,Amazing Paolo,"The first person we met was Paolo, he was a star, so funny and professional. Made our day! The negative was the bar staff. But the door man mow was also helpful.",5,2024,04,27
132,5 star experience,"I stayed the  Sanderson hotel with my girlfriend recently very good experience.

132,A week in Central London,"Centrally located near Oxford street and many restaurants
We stayed in a suite very spacious 
Fantastic shower
Excellent espresso Lavazza coffee maker
Now for the minuses
Awful WiFi. Hardly ever on
We ordered room service and the man delivering our meal refused to enter the room until we sign the charge slip
We have never encounter such behavior and are seasoned travelers
Our suite faced a busy road and was noisy with traffic all night
The decor is quite minimalist and pleasing
Certainly not for everyone
But the location is excellent and we probably stay with them again",4,2024,04,14

132,Very nice spot for late night drinks,"Great indoor and outdoor atmosphere for catching up with friends or going on a romantic date. Summertimes are the best to come here, so you can enjoy both.

I did not have a tip for him and he was so gracious and said no worry it is his job and he is overjoyed to be of service.

132,Millian's review,"The staff was really helpful and kind. I loved the receptionists Maria and Silvia, they were really friendly. The breakfast was really tasty, and there were a lot of plant based options which is important (I'm a pescatarian anyway). I loved that the hotel was close to a lot of things (ex. Madam Tussauds, Oxford Street, a lot of shops…). The room was great, and they were cleaned daily. Overall I 100% recommend it.",5,2024,04,04

132,So good we stayed another night!,"Great hotel, good location! Guys on the door were amazing! Especially Mo - he was so friendly and welcoming - he really made our stay! Bar staff need a bit of training in friendliness and how to smile - but overall wouldn’t hesitate to recommend!",5,2024,03,25
132,"Poor service, inexperienced staff","Arrived 10 mins early, was told “our” waiter was not ready till 2 pm, meanwhile about 10 people turned up who also had a booking at 2pm were shown to their table. Our tea was given to table next to us. They told waiter it wasn’t theirs. Waiter then gave it to us, to which I replied “ we would like like fresh tea “ I didn’t really want to share my tea with someone else. The sandwich fillings I found rather bizarre, tzatziki, salmon moose and a carrot with something sandwich. We have been to quite a few afternoon teas, I can safely say this was the worse one. I asked for the bill, which should have been zero, as pre paid as a gift, not only to be charged 12.5% discretionary service charge at the end.",1,2024,03,24
132,"A good, quirky place to stay just off Oxford Street.","We spent 3 nights here and enjoyed our stay - the place has a great atmosphere, it's very trendy and we received a great welcome at reception. We treated ourselves to a suite (608) and we were lucky enough to get some use from the balcony which was an unexpected bonus.

The suite was well equipped; a very comfortable bed and pillows and very quirky being divided up by glass panels and voile curtains which added to the whole experience. We had a great stay but there were a couple of issues. (1) There was confusion over breakfast. At check in we were asked if we wanted to book breakfast at £25 which we did on the first day. When we sat down, the menu offered a continental breakfast at, I think, £26 with a cooked option for a total of £30. The waiter had no idea what we should get for £25 which he hadn't heard of! (2) The walk in shower just has a plain metal flat door handle on the inside of the glass door and it was impossible to grip it when wet and open the door, which is very tall, as it also caught at the bottom on the floor. Could be difficult for a solo resident. We did report that to reception on check out.

But we enjoyed our stay at the hotel, but not sure if we'd go back - so many other places to explore.",4,2024,03,20
132,Perfect in everyway,"This beautiful hotel went above and beyond to help my daughter celebrate her partners surprise 18th birthday trip. Nothing was an issue, my daughter contacted the hotel prior to arrival to ensure that they were fully aware of her partners birthday. We arrived at the hotel earlier than expected (I was chauffeur) with a boot full of balloons and luggage, the porter was so very welcoming and check in was lovely and straight forward. First impressions mean everything to us and being very frequent travellers into London first impressions are not always great. However, front desk greeted us with a such a happy yet professional manner and was generally happy to have us, it was our best welcoming to date. 

They informed my daughter that they had upgraded her to a suite and that it was ready immediately. Amazing! the suite was literally out of this world everything was more than perfect already and the birthday boy hadn't even arrived yet.  They never felt rushed throughout their stay. Pre dinner drinks were lovely, fab DJ, lovely friendly barman who made the best Lychee martins thank you!!  and even better door staff who very kindly took photos of my daughter and her partner. 

The morning after they did not want to leave so requested a late check out. It was a straight yes straight away no problems at all. Breakfast was delivered to their room and then they casually got ready and were able to leave their luggage at the hotel for the day whilst they enjoyed the day. 

Honestly we can not thank you enough for making such a special milestone birthday everything they could of dreamed of and more. 

Thank you Sanderson and we will see you very soon x",5,2024,03,15
132,Fabulous!,"I really enjoyed my stay here, the staff were so friendly and super helpful! Jose and Emily made sure that we had everything we needed, and made us feel very welcome. The room was amazing and the bed was super comfy. Definitely would stay again, we really enjoyed the breakfast too!",5,2024,03,02
132,"Relaxing place, well located","Very good breakfast and wonderful service by Sanyogita. Efficient, quiet atmosphere, confortable, good food quality. Rooms have the right size, interesting design, quiet and cosy. I recommend this place that you will not forget. Enjoy!",5,2024,02,26
132,Amazing,"The Mad Hatter afternoon Tea experience is one of the most outstanding tea experiences I’ve been to. The teas and knibbles are to die for, there’s a lot of them. The heaters outside the courtyard make it nice and warm. The service is excellent and friendly, nothing is too much to ask for. We’ve had the pleasure of being waited by Sanyogita. She knows her teas and has the warmest personality. Take your kids, you’ll be in for a treat. Or without kids, because this is a good experience for adults as well.",5,2024,02,15
132,"Great Hotel, Great location - Just one let down","Really nice hotel in a fantastic location, the staff on the door were super helpful and the reception staff were pleasant and chatty. I appreciate the room layout might not be to everyone’s taste, the bathroom / sleeping area is separated by a curtain but for me it was fine, the lobby and stairway area are wonderful, with a beautiful stained glass window. 
The only thing that let my stay down was the bar - great size, nice atmosphere but some of the staff in the bar had a poor attitude. We were ignored several times whilst signalling for a drink and felt intimidated by the security team who seemed to be keeping a watch on us even though we were sitting at the bar just having a quiet conversation. Unfortunately we felt too uncomfortable and decided to leave after two drinks - a shame as otherwise this is a great hotel",4,2024,02,09
132,Cool hotel but a little tired 5 star and lacking service experience somewhat.,"I visited this hotel for my daughter’s 16th birthday as a surprise. I really wanted to visit the Sanderson for its quirky cool design. 

The outside is really underwhelming  compared to the expectation and when you have the likes of The London Edition on the other side of the road which looks more elegant and grandiose. 

We were welcomed and my Iberian was to just drop off bags (as it was mid morning), however I was advised that the room wasn’t ready but I could upgrade. The hotel knew it was my daughter’s birthday, so I was a special occasion I felt I should pay the extra for a bigger room and the room was in fact ready. For noting, they take £100 deposit for the room. The receptionist was friendly enough, but not really warm and perhaps not the experience of other hotels that I have been in London, some of a lower star. The lobby is sparse but cool, the lift is out of this world, the corridors are dark (be warned) so get ready for dimmed lighting. 

We were on 6th floor, room was good, large bed, really big bathroom and suitably impressed on the whole. However on closer inspection, the rooms downfall is the really poor finish of the paintwork on all the walls/skirting board. It was strange because the walls looked fairly new and freshly painted, but the standard of painting and finish all round the room was really not good and let’s it down imho. The other couple of points is the netting curtains in the bathroom to partition the storage off and in between seeing who’s in the shower, it just looked very dated and cheap in a cool room. The bed was very opulent, but a marked which should be attended to. The pillows were really good, the duvet was too thin (I was a little cold) but I found the bed just too hard, and I like a firm bed at home, but this was not the best so my sleep was a broken 3 times, but appreciate this is personal preference. Finally the flooring again looks cheap laminate floor style (which had a number of marks on) compared to rest of furnishings, looks old fashioned and in my opinion would look cooler and more sophisticated painted white.  Anyway enough of the decor, whilst I wasn’t there to inspect the design, I guess I expected a really high standard with such a famous hotel for its interiors. 

On our return back to the hotel at 10.30pm, the bar and music was pumping, I expect it’s super noisy if you have a room on the lower floors, but the bar was fun, but loud.

We had a nice surprise for my daughter with some cake with some fruit on a plate, so she devoured half of that! 

The check out was ok, same staff member was there, again went through the motions  but didn’t feel overly warm. Then there was a whole conversation around the bill, I was advised the rook upgrade would be deducted from the deposit (I had swiped my card the day before assuming I had been charged). However when we left the hotel for lunch (leaving our bags to collect later), I got a notification on phone to say I had been charged for room at original price plus upgrade (as I expected) but not as explained by receptionist that the amount was being taken off the deposit.  Therefore on collecting our bags after lunch, I then flagged that what I had been advised was not showing on my credit card statement and explained by receptionist. However I was told a refund of the whole deposit must be therefore coming back to me and would have to wait up to 5 days, but given a contact email address in case it was not correct. In one hand I guess is helpful, but in other didn’t give me a lot of confidence. 

Overall a decent stay, perfect location for the theatre, numerous meals we did etc, and it was ticked off my list of hotels  to visit. It was definitely different, quirky and cool, I’m not feeling the 5 star finish and wow service from staff that I’ve had from lesser hotels and other 5 stars.  However definitely 4 star but I think some more attention to detail is needed.",4,2024,02,09
132,Great Location,"We stayed in a Loft Suite which was lovely. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location is perfect, right in the center of London. The hotel was very clean and had some great furnishings and a very cool bar.
The only downside was the air con in the room. Even at a lower temperature the room was far too hot.",4,2024,01,28
132,Did not return £300 deposit with no explanation,"The experience was lovely up until the hotel did not refund my £300 deposit with no explanation of why. Upon checkout, we were notified of what we owed and were charged. Over a week passed and no deposit was refunded. I reached out to the property on multiple occasions and never received a response. I am having to contest this charge with my bank. For how expensive this hotel was, this really was an awful experience to lose close to $300 without explanation. I would not recommend this hotel if you hope to keep your money.",1,2024,01,27
132,Dreamlike atmosphere you will either love or hate,"Yes, the architecture of this London hotel is like being in a dream, right down to the nearly pitchblack corridors with room numbers displayed in lighted plaques in the floor outside your door. Elevators are similarly dark, feel like traveling in a starry hologram(is the only way I can describe it). The rooms themselves are modern but oddly constructed. There are no closets or doors separating the bathroom from the bedroom---only curtains. Perhaps the only exception is the bar & restaurant.",4,2024,01,25
132,Sublime,"One of the best afternoon tea. The tea itself was sublime. The service was exceptional. Walt was our host and he gave the most attentive service.  Was not rushed off our table. My afternoon was so relaxing, a great birthday treat.",5,2024,01,22
132,The perfect place to start the year,"I stayed at Sanderson's during New Years. After a long night out, all I wanted was a confortable bed, and for sure Sanderson has the best ones. Despite the hangover, the staff was so nice! Specially Emily, which was so kind helping me to re-book my flights!
Can't wait to go back!",5,2024,01,11
132,Wonderful experience,"We enjoyed a delightful stay at the Sanderson hotel, where every aspect exceeded our expectations. From the seamless arrival experience, courtesy of Finn assisting us with our luggage, to Vito at the Front Desk providing a comprehensive overview of the hotel's facilities, and Emily's valuable guidance on exploring London and shopping destinations, the service was truly exceptional. We struggled to find any shortcomings, except for the inevitable sadness upon departing. Without a doubt, we will be returning soon for another wonderful experience.",5,2024,01,11
132,Afternoon tea,"Afternoon tea was amazing served by sanyogita wonderful advice and was so helpful we had Alice in wonderland themed tea 
Everything was great and we had 2 hours to enjoy our afternoon 
Lots of delicious items 

Thanks sanyogita !",5,2024,01,10
132,Lacking Leadership,"I had two stays at the Sanderson, in September I had an underwhelming experience and the front desk/reception was poor. Was told if I came back I they would upgrade me to make amends.

Sadly when I arrived in early December no upgrade, despite 6 weeks warning and a text from them confirming it. Upgraded the next day. Rooms are lovely, Hotel i stunningly done.

However there a major issues at the Sanderson and it all revolves around poor a lack of teamwork amongst the staff. I spoke at length with quite a few of them. Seems no-one is in charge which is a real shame. High turnover of staff I was told. This is in direct contrast to their sister Hotel in St Martin's Lane (cannot speak highly enough of them).

One of the newer staff members at the Sanderson was great - young man called Chica. Just had a can do attitude about him and was friendly and professional.

The other issue seems to be whether the Sanderson is a Home or night club. Impossible to have a quiet dinner in the Restaurant most nights as the music is loud !!!

If they got the running of the place right, this place would be seriously good, but lacks basics you would expect at the price - eg Doorman to assist with luggage, people on the reception desk on night.

Overall was disappointing.",3,2024,01,08
132,"Stylish hotel, if the price is right stay here!","Needed somewhere near to the Theatre district for a works do and this place came up at a decent price for London. I was very lucky too as received an upgrade for my stay! Really impressed with the size of the room and how it was designed, massive bathroom, freestanding bath & separate shower area. Super comfy and large bed. Only negative was the room was cold and could not find the temp control unti anywhere! and there were so many light switches, finding which turned on which light was quite a task! but really nice stay.",5,2023,12,23
132,Great food and service,Had a pleasant stay at the Sanderson hotel. Highly recommend trying the massive breakfast spread with splendid service. Shoutout to shivangi for making our check in process smooth and for a few good pub recommendations. Must visit and suggest getting the deluxe room for the best experience. Cheers!,5,2023,11,23
132,Seriously Overcharged,Do not trust this hotel with your credit card details - I have been seriously overcharged and cannot get anyone in the organisation to resolve the matter. Promises to return phonecalls not honoured. Emails ignored. Appalling customer relations. Strongly advise anyone to avoid.,1,2023,11,17
132,Still got it after all of these years...,"It's been a long time since I stayed here, but I had previously spent over 100 nights here and at their sister hotel down the road, the Saint Martins Lane Hotel.   I'm happy to say that the hotel is still in great shape, the service was excellent and my stay was very comfortable.

I booked a standard queen room and it was exactly as I had expected.  The rooms are a decent size, and probably a bit on the larger side for central London.  The look and feel is clean, modern, and minimalist, keeping in line with the style throughout the rest of the hotel.  The bathroom area is spacious, but mostly suited for one person at a time.  Overall, these rooms are probably best for a solo traveler or a couple.

The service was friendly and very helpful.  I had an unexpected injury the week before and had been hobbling around with an ankle brace.  I messaged the hotel asking for an early check-in and they were happy to accommodate and to offer any assistance.  Furthermore, due to a change in my plans, I had to check out a day earlier.  They were happy to modify my reservation without hassle or charge.

I ordered late room service one evening as I sat on late conference calls.  The rib eye steak was delicious and delivered hot and fast.  I did not eat at the restaurant this time around, but the bar is stylish and my cocktails were excellent.

I will most likely consider the Sanderson again for my next stay in London.",5,2023,11,15
132,Cocktails Flowing!,"What a cute birthday treat from my friends! this place had such a quirky feel to it! great place to take pictures and just relax with friends. 
Cocktails were just amazing and tasted very good. Staff were fantastic and very attentive. Fantastic start to the birthday celebrations ",5,2023,11,10
132,My stay at The Sanderson Hotel,"Sanderson modern-contemporary design is in-tact! Since, the time its built. And, Liem provided me a great service! During, my time at the place.",5,2023,11,04
132,Thank you - again!,"Another fantastic stay at the Sanderson! My third stay in 12 months. I would not stay anywhere else now when I’m in London.
A huge thank you to Fernando who made the trip extra special for me and my friends. 
The hotel is so central to everything you need in London and close to so many great restaurants, bars and shops.
The rooms are so spacious and full of luxury! I would definitely recommend the breakfast and drinks in the bar! 
Thanks to the staff in the restaurant for breakfast as nothing is too much trouble!
An excellent hotel that I continue to recommend to friends and family.
Thanks again Sanderson!!",5,2023,10,29
132,None existant customer service,"I actually quite enjoyed my stay at the Sanderson, the decor and the feel of the hotel was rather nice, even if I was in the room for a total of 7 hours due to me just having a one night stay.

However, I come to check my bank two days later, and have a near £300 charge come out of my bank, despite the room being pre-paid, me not touching a mini bar, having dinner etc. All I did was go to sleep

I called to query this and was told someone would call me ""within 48 hours"" It has now been 72 hours, I have tried to call 5 times, each time it rings a few times and then I get transferred to a general operator telling me the message box is full?",2,2023,10,23
132,Superb location.,"Superb location in center of London, so the cost of the rooms is high but if you want this location that’s the price you pay.
The styling of the hotel is a little particular, feels like an exclusive nightclub feel that they went for,
Lobby bar has bright light and pumping dance music, so if that’s your thing you will enjoy it.
Not for me but so be it.
The room was really spacious and bed really comfortable. Very clean.
But again the styling seems to just be trying too hard to be “cool” - see picture of weights in room?
The lift and corridors are practically dark so be prepared for that.

All in all I left feeling it was nice. - little expensive and could have been a nice stay with some décor modifications.",4,2023,10,01
132,Poor experience,"There is nothing we can say positively about Sanderson apart from its location, being a few minutes walk from Oxford Street, and a couple of very dedicated and attentive restaurant staff.  Worthy of mention are Lay and Flavio, both of whom treat their customers as welcomed guests.  After just a couple of mornings, they already remember what our preferences are.  During the course of the meal, they would see to it that everything is fine and that all our needs are attended to. 

We stayed in three different rooms over nine nights.  We find that the whole design concept of the hotel does not take safety into consideration. The corridors are way too dark, and the lifts are way too dark for one to move around comfortably and safely. 

In one of the rooms that we stayed in, which is said to be a deluxe room, there are a number of safety traps.  A part of the glass panel separating the sleeping area and the bath area protrudes into the way. Many times we almost banged onto the glass.  We had to put a suitcase in front of the glass panel to avoid any accident. 

There are two heavy metal weights meant to be dumbbells put precariously on a shelf too small for them. They could easily fall off the shelf and hit you on your feet. And there are sharp corners on the shelf. If one opens a suitcase and works beneath it, it could cause serious injuries if one is not careful getting up.  

The TV is put on a metal tray with sharp corners. The tray protrudes beyond its rest. Underneath it are the safe and the fridge. If one uses the safe and the fridge, one has to bend underneath the sharp shelf corners. Any slip of the mind would cause serious injuries again. 

In the other rooms, there is a mirror with sharp metal corners hanging from the ceiling in the bath area.  It’s frequent that one has to bend down to pick things up etc.  Again this is a potential head injury trap. 

Apart from ignoring safety, the whole design also ignores traveller comfort.  There are no cupboards and no drawers, and no area that one can put one’s suitcases and other necessary items one uses when one travels.  There is no stopper in the sink.  What can I do if I want to wash something?  I begin to suspect that the designers/architects of this hotel have not ever had the experience of travelling and staying in a hotel to appreciate what a traveller needs when travelling. 

Apart from the design, the policy of the hotel also does not attend to traveller needs. Glasses or mugs are not provided for one to brush one’s teeth. Tooth brush and tooth paste are of course not supplied.  And, perhaps in the name of ESG, nothing one normally expects in a hotel room is provided, like shower caps, shaving kits, combs, cotton swabs etc. etc. They don’t even replenish the tea bags and coffee without a specific request. The absurdity of this ESG thing is used by this hotel, and perhaps other hotels, to cut services, supplies, and ultimately costs, at the expense of the comfort and convenience of guests.  Paying between £400+ and £500+ per night, depending on the day of the week, one is still expected to go find a place to buy your own tooth brush and tooth paste and other necessities!  Ripoff is the word I can think of to describe this. We visit London quite often.  This is the first time, and definitely will be the last, that we are staying at the Sanderson London, if they don’t improve their design and change their policy on how customers are treated.",1,2023,09,29
132,"Screams ""Renovate me!""","My family and I stayed at the Sanderson between 8-14 Sept this year. It has been a good 15 years since I stayed in this hotel and we were really looking forward to going back since our previous stays in the early 2000s were truly amazing. 

Alas, the stay this time was littered with problems all pretty much stemming from the fact that management has not renovated the establishment in decades (if at all).

The first and most annoying thing was the very poor air conditioning unit in the room. The first 3 days of our stay were very warm (approx 30-32c during the day which for London is hot) and the tiny unit (although was working to its capacity) did not cool the room in the slightest which resulted in terribly uncomfortable nights during which our sleep quality was extremely poor.
Additional issue in the room - shower door latch broken, resulting in the area puddling with water any time you took a shower.

Moving on to poor service issues - upon arrival at the hotel (and pretty much all the time during our stay) there was no valet service - we had to carry our luggage on our own from the taxi to the reception area and up to the room.
At least 3-4 times during our stay during breakfast and afternoon coffee orders we were made to wait 15-20 mins and only after numerous reminders to the waiting staff that our order was missing, would we get served. 

All in all, the Sanderson needs some serious renovation. What was hip and fun 20-25 years ago, today looks pretty tired and irrelevant. The Long Bar (which back in the day was one of the trendiest places to have your afternoon cocktails) looks old and abandoned. Some decent staff training would go a long way too.",3,2023,09,21
132,Lovely breakfast great service,"I was staying at the hotel for a good week and used to have breakfast in its main resturant.. Food and service was amazing .

Chipego.. a lovely amazing young lady tried her v best to please us and make it a great breakfast experience with her patience, dedication and care.

Thank you 🙏🙏",5,2023,09,06
132,Eyes Wide....Shhhhh!,"Definitely one of the sexiest hotels I've stayed in. The room I stayed in, had a unique open-concept bathroom, and it was just a delight for my lover and I.

132,Pretty good except for TV and Room Service so use as a base to go out from.,"Nice modern hotel, decent location off Oxford Street / Soho / Covent Garden. Dog friendly. Good as a base - some annoyances if you stay in your room at all. Room service adequate at best (menu/value/speed). TV annoyingly only small proportion of channels work - subset of Freeview, and not internet connected so no Netflix, and can’t connect/stream laptop - basically less than you’d get in a Holiday Inn!",3,2023,08,22
132,"Great stay, shame about the £400 taken from our credit card","We had a lovely stay at the Sanderson the past weekend - it was a good location, bedrooms were comfortable and well-appointed, and the gentleman who checked us out was really polite and personable.

However - my partner put down a £100 deposit upon arrival for our 1 night stay, and was told this would be refunded as we left. The next day, another £100 had been taken from his card, rather than refunded - we assumed this was a genuine error and would be rectified quickly. This morning, another £200 has been taken, making the grand total £400 in incorrect deposit charges. 

My partner has rung the hotel and been told they can't sort it, and to 'email management' - I work in hospitality myself and cannot fathom how FOH/Reservations are unable to see these issues on the POS and refund the charges ASAP. They have also given him the Guest Relations email address which is, in my opinion, not acceptable given the severity of the charges taken from his bank without permission - why have we not been given a senior team member's address?

Overall, the stay was great but this issue has completely put me off staying at the Sanderson again in future. Incredibly disappointing.",2,2023,08,16
132,If your not big on customer service then the location is excellent ,"Three of us stayed in the loft room for one night as part of a hen break. On check in there was a misunderstanding on prepayment which was unfortunately poorly dealt with by reception and subsequently set the tone for the time spent here. 

The room itself was very spacious and quiet, however we were disappointed to find no acknowledgment of our occasion in the room and to also find that the room had only been arranged for two guests.

On returning from dinner at Roka (highly recommended, 5 min walk away), we returned to the room to find 4 macarons and a note saying welcome to the hotel. A nice gesture but missing the mark when there are 3 of us and still no mention of the occasion we are celebrating?

When we raised our issues with reception we asked if a complementary breakfast could be made available for us as a gesture of good will. Sadly the low expectations were not reached as they had changed their minds on this by the morning.  We left and went to Charlotte street hotel, a short walk away, for brunch which had brilliant service. To complete the experience we were then charged £75 for the breakfast we did not eat. 

Wonderful. 

Will not be returning. ",2,2023,08,07
132,Lovely experience,My two friends and I had a really lovely experience here at the Sanderson. Beautiful setting for the afternoon tea and it’s a reasonable price for London. Wiem was a lovely waitress who provided excellent service for us. Would 100% recommend a trip here.,5,2023,07,15
132,Great for a girls trip!,Wiem our server was lovely and the tea and champagne was great! They accommodated gluten free and it was delicious. We came as two people and they let us share a tea tasting because we were trying to stay on budget. The decor and atmosphere was great. All the staff were very warm!,5,2023,07,14
132,"A bit pricey, but best quality in the area.","Stayed here for a couple of days in order to attend a climate conference. Very central location, near everything. When I go to London, I always prefer this kind of location, in the center.

They have very beautiful rooms, although it's a bit expensive compared to other hotels nearby. Very good room service, not very pricey and delicious food. 

A lot of pubs and lively life around if you want to enjoy the city.

The rooms are above expected from our previous experiences in hotels hotels around.

In general, good experience.",5,2023,07,11
132,Seriously Fantastic and Hip,"We recently spent 6 fantastic nights @ The Sanderson. We decided last winter to Return to the Sanderson after 5 nights there Summer of 2022.  Its location is perfect, convenient to shopping, cultural sites  and restaurants.We returned to London this time for a wedding celebration, and recommended our family stay there too. The facility, rooms, restaurant, staff, location were all spectacular and exceeded our expectations from the prior year. Every one of our family were very pleased with their experience.
We have stayed in many hotels across the world and no one has ever made us feel more appreciated than Olivier, The manager concierge spark plug who makes the Sanderson run!!!!  We will definitely book the Sanderson next time in London!!!! ",5,2023,07,08
132,Used to come here but the vibe has gone,Used to be a very cool place to go to. Rooms are still good but the atmosphere in the hotel which used to make it has gone. I remember the long bar being lively and the purple bar being a great late night destination. My latest stay and the bar was quiet but had people but I came in 15 mins before closing and was told it was already closed despite the advertised opening hours and me being a guest. Felt like the staff just wanted to finish up early.,3,2023,06,20
132,Perfect,"This special hotel, which for us is the fourth visit, is excellently located.  The rooms are spacious and very clean.  Deserving of special mention is the charming Olivier, who in his role in the reception hall is sociable, cordial, hospitable, helps as much as he can above and beyond and gives an excellent homely feeling.  Especially thanks to him it is worth staying at this hotel!",5,2023,06,20
132,Sanderson London my new GO TO hotel in London 🫶,"If I could give 10/10 I would. From the moment I arrived at The Sanderson London I was treated like absolute gold. The scent of the lobby and the hotel reminds so much when I was living in Miami …. Clean and fresh ❤️ The rooms are amazing, spacious and made me feel like home. The beds are huge and lush with proper bedding that you will just melt into. Each day my room was cleaned to perfection and restocked with complimentary water. I can’t fault this hotel and will posting reels in my socials on IG if you want to check out the room I stayed in @carol.skyluxe @skyluxeclub
A special thanks to Olivier and Eleni who went above and beyond all my expectations and needs as I was there for two weeks. Looking forward to my next stay which will be very soon.",5,2023,06,18
132,Sanderson is fun London Luxury,"Staying at The Sanderson London in Soho this past April was one of the best boutique hotel experiences that I’ve had.  It’s got a cool vibe, great location, great food & drinks and the rooms are beautiful. But most of all, the staff led by Olivier Secret & Elena Lauri were outstanding and made my stay in London extra special!",5,2023,06,17
132,Wonderful hotel,"A great hotel , we stayed for one night , the room was spacious, very quiet , the bed was huge and very comfortable. It was our 40th anniversary and the duty manager left a complimentary bottle of champagne which was a lovely surprise, thanks to all the staff for making it a wonderful experience ",5,2023,06,11
132,Absolutely amazing on every level!,"Stunning hotel, Penthouse is gorgeous! Could not get more friendly or attentive staff and the Mad Hatters Afternoon tea is insanely good and funky! 100% recommend this hotel for family's or a couples night away, pure luxury!",5,2023,06,08
132,Impromptu drink in the new terrace,"Great service from a French manager for an impromptu drink

We were passing by last Friday and saw the new outside terrace which looked fabulous so we decided to go in before our dinner in Belgravia for a drink . We were greeted by a lovely  manager who was french/ he walked us to bar and our table and also showed us a few options of where we could sit .  
Instead of one drink we had two and it was the best to  start to a lovely evening . Merci manager",5,2023,05,29
132,Sanderson - still on point 23 years later!,"Absolutely loved my stay at the Sanderson - and was surprised to see that it’s still on point some 23 years after it opened. The service was impeccable (big thanks to Andre for the especially smiley service) and the rooms were huge! I tried out two and was very happy with the Deluxe King that I ultimately settled on. Bed, and bed linen - great, also appreciated the enormous floor to ceiling mirrors. Wonderful natural light and view from Room 601 - the proximity to the lift didn’t even bother me! And lastly - I was worried that the decor might feel a little dated. It definitely is of a certain era (was giving me 00s flashbacks in the best way) but I found it really charming and it brought back some wonderful memories. Would definitely recommend and will be back!",5,2023,05,27
132,"Very stylish, quirky and comfortable","The 1970s facade gives no clues to the modern, quirky and comfortable interior! 

Really comfortable bed, fierce shower, superb location within easy walking distance of all the places you’re likely to wish to visit. 

Staff Uber polite and helpful.",5,2023,05,15
132,Very pleasant surprise ,I’ve stayed in this hotel before maybe 2-3 years ago and was left a bit disappointed mostly due to lack of attention. I am happy to report that I really felt like things had improved so thank you for a wonderful stay. Oliver’s smile felt always genuine. And big Thank you  Tuany for friendly check in. Will come back. ,5,2023,05,12

The breakfast was great too and the room was amazing very clean and up to my standards. Would be back in July.",5,2023,05,04
132,5 star in every way,"Thank you so much to Fernando and all the staff for making our stay so amazing. It certainly was 5 star. Everyone went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect. The staff were so welcoming and attentive. 
The hotel lobby, bar, restaurant and all areas are stunning. We loved the decor throughout. 
Our room was very big and luxurious. The bathroom was stunning. We were treated to a lovely bottle of champagne to celebrate our birthdays. 
The bar had a great atmosphere in the evening. 
Breakfast was delicious and there was a lot of choice. 
Honestly one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in in London. Would highly recommend. I would especially recommend booking directly with the hotel. I will definitely be returning.",5,2023,04,22
132,Amazing hotel - great experience and lovely staff!,"Had the most amazing stay at Sanderson! Beautiful hotel with lovely staff. Our room was luxurious and the bathroom was spotless. Shout out to Olivier, Thuanny, Maria and Emily who made my stay extra special. I will be returning!",5,2023,04,20
132,Classy modern and welcoming,"From the fabulous modernist design throughout the hotel to the fresh inviting fragrance of the lobby, this hotel is first class. Inconspicuous from outside it feels like a secret club known only to a privileged few. The staff are warm, friendly and helpful without fussiness. Maria welcomes at the door with a big beautiful smile and from that moment you know that these people care about what they do.",5,2023,04,19
132,Luxury Stay,"I never usually write a review about a hotel, however I couldn’t not after the recent experience my family and friends had at the Sanderson. We stayed for two nights on 4th and 5th April to celebrate our mums 70th birthdays.
A huge thank you to Fernando, who went above and beyond as manager, to ensure every element of our stay was catered for. He organised our booking and made sure we had everything that we all needed for a memorable stay. His level of care and customer service has been fantastic. You are a star!
Furthermore, we all commented on the lovely breakfast and excellent service from the staff during this period. They were all warm, attentive and must be congratulated on their hard work. Thank you!
Furthermore, the ladies on the front desk desk deserve a special mention, who were so helpful. In particular, Thuanny who was super friendly and recognised how important and special a trip for Mums should be! Thank you!
I honestly can’t thank all of the staff enough for their exceptional and personal level of service that can often be lacking these days. I have stayed in many hotels across the world and from start to finish, the Sanderson team have got it right! If you are looking for a perfectly located hotel, a level of luxury and a great experience then look no further than this hotel. I am very much looking forward to staying again soon. 
Well done Sanderson team, please pass on my thanks on behalf of me and my travelling party to those colleagues I have mentioned. 
Thanks for ensuring we all had a wonderful stay.

Has the best service all time !

Very clean! And great location! 
Nice restaurant and bar !

I will come back again next time for staying this hotel again!!",5,2023,04,08
132,Even extraordinary hardware needs maintenance,"When you enter this stylish, elegant hotel you might say ""wow"" at the entrance. Wellcome at the reception desk is still professional as well as he room welcomes you in a bright appearance. But the more you look behind the scenes the more you get a bit disappointed. The doors to the toilet and the shower (all glass, no real walls) are grinding on the floor. (Complain about that when you are leaving, they pretend they are so sorry, but have never heard about that and pay you a breakfast). 
One out of three blinds of the windows needs  extended manual skills, and the keycard system seems to have its independent own life (no, I did not have the key card near my mobile phone!).
Free tip for the management: When you furnish your next hotel put a plug on each side if the bed. 
Breakfast in the hotel is fine, but needs a relaxing day plan. Don't do that when you start late in the day. 
But overall: Nice place to stay, very good location. ",3,2023,04,07
132,Outstanding service at the Sanderson Hotel,"I was blown away at the incredible service and attention to detail from all the staff at the Sanderson Hotel, Fitzrovia, London, particularly the manager Fernando, who went out of his way to make sure that I was satisfied with my room and checked in regularly to enquire what he could do to improve my experience at the Sanderson. The 5 days spent at this wonderful hotel were a pleasure and I hope to stay there again on my return to London. 

It is not often that the concierge is made available to help you with all your luggage to Tottenham Court Rd Station to get the train to Heathrow! This was service above and beyond anything I have experienced in all my years of travel.

Nothing was too much for Fernando and his staff and even on his day off, he made sure that the softer pillows I requested were provided within the hour.

The hotel is spotlessly clean, the rooms are lovely and spacious and the atmosphere is great. The hotel is centrally situated and within walking distance to Oxford Circus, Bond street and of course, Tottenham Court Station.",5,2023,04,04
132,Futuristic and trendy place,"Its an amazing hotel, trendy enviroment just off Oxford street. Access to the hotel is very easy in the heart of London. Reasonable prices and a very helpful personnel on anything needed. The rooms are ergonomic and fully futuristic. Common areas are spacious and include a long bar and an amazing restaurant. Breakfast can be ordered on a menu - a la cart- with a reasonable variety for all needs. Strongly recommended for any type of stay. Prices very reasonable fot london standards.",5,2023,04,04
132,My stay at the Sanderson Hotel:,"Excellent service, special thanks to Olivier who help us . 
We will definitely return ❣️
Me and my husband stayed at room 201
And our two kids stayed at room 202.
The rooms were clean, cozy and comfortable.",5,2023,04,03
132,Neat Luxe City Break - Tasty Food & Signature cocktails,"We were looking for something different - not the typical 5* hotel, but rather good vibes, luxurious feel and great location.
We stayed 1 night, Friday night and had lunch, and dinner at the hotel. We experienced warmth and genuine staff willing to go the extra mile and make us feel right at home. 

The restaurant serves tasty sushi and satisfying portions, amongst other fine dining options - we had sushi at lunch time. 
In the evening we stayed at The Long Bar and were entertained by Yanush's signature cocktails - a MUST share!!! 

Dinner was good, beef on the rib was lovely with added tasty baked veggies as a side dish. Presentation was lovely!

We were upgraded to a suite, the same bedroom style, but just larger ‘open plan’ room radiating a clean and neat luxurious feel with not too much clutter. - Fantastic.

We thank the whole team for their warm welcome!

We look forward to spreading the vibe!",5,2023,03,12
132,Wedding After Party & Wedding Breakfast,"We had a fantastic celebrations in the Long Bar with the DJ pumping out some great tunes.  We had 30 guests, the Bar Staff couldn't of been more attentive.  The quality of the cocktails was excellent, with the staff always happy to go off menu.

Olivier Secret organized our wedding breakfast, ensuring we had a private  area where our guests could enjoy a relaxing breakfast.  Olivier chilled a couple of bottles of champagne for the more hardy guests.  

All our guests commented on the super helpful Fernando, the front desk manager who ensured our guests rooms were ready for those that had travelled. 

Excellent venue and attentive staff, we will be back soon!",5,2023,03,12
132,Great stay,"We had a great stay at the Sanderson hotel. Excellent customer service, clean and stunning room, absolutely amazing staff in all areas. We enjoyed the afternoon tea, cocktails and breakfast, all was very tasty. The gym also had lots of equipment. 
Would highly recommend, the hotel looks modern and chic. We only encountered one small issue with the room service but it was taken care of by the front of house team in a serious and professional manner. We stayed in other hotels from the Morgans hotel group and this hotel lived up to the standard. We are excited to return one day. ",5,2023,03,11
132,Amazing hotel stay,"What’s not to like about this hotel. Very stylish inside, rooms great size, bed huge and comfy. Loved the interior of the room. Robes and slippers were a nice touch. I was celebrating a special birthday, and when we got back to the room there was cake, with a lovely birthday message from Fernando, which I thought was a lovely touch. We were also given two vouchers for a cocktail at the bar. All staff were friendly hand helpful, from the door staff, bar staff and receptionists. Andre was particularly helpful and friendly. Can’t wait to return. You",5,2023,03,10
132,Excellence,"Amazing experience with great and attentive customer service! 
We can strongly recommend the Long bar - the bartenders were really nice, the cocktails were magical! Also the main courses in the restaurant were so delicious! 
A special thanks to Fernando for looking after us like royalties!",5,2023,02,26
132,"Nice, not extraordinary","This hotel is situated in a great location, a short distance from Oxford Circus. The overall venue is Spartan, clean but feels a little dated. It lacks the passion and detail from the staff to delight and surprise; that extra special something.

For example, helping us to our room and showing us all the quirky things and how it all worked. Light switches were not immediately obvious and on entry to the room is was dark as we were surrounded by a wall of curtains! Similarly, the shower was not obvious with its controls; it took a while to work it out. 

Nevertheless, the bed was super comfortable and the coffee / tea in the room was great. The breakfast was great, however, if you wanted a set breakfast like eggs Benedict, this was extra. It should be included when booking with “breakfast included” option.

We received a complimentary drink at the long bar. The cocktails were great and good to know that the bar was open late for residents. However, it did feel like you needed a map and compass if you needed the toilet when in the bar; they were so far away!

Nice chap on the door and Fernando on the front desk!",4,2023,02,26
132,Always a pleasure staying at Sanderson,"Always a pleasure staying at Sanderson. The reception team makes my stay great each time. They are very quick, welcoming and a great help. Specially Emily from reception always smiling and ready to help. Rooms are comfortable and big enough. The longbar is always happening. Good to grab a drink after work. 
Looking forward to my next stay. ",5,2023,02,09
132,Swanky Spot near SoHo Square,"I stay here mostly because of its prox to Soho square.  The hotel is mod and minimalist. The rooms are sometimes hard to navigate b/c of their minimalism i.e light switch locations and lack of shelving in the shower.  Nonetheless, breakfast is awesome, the bar is cool at night, and on this particular stay, Emily was over the top nice during the checkout. I’ll be back.",4,2023,02,09
132,Very run down,This hotel looks glossy on social media but in reality it's very run down.  Nothing about the visit was 5*. It was shabby and dirty. The staff were very sweet but the service lacked finesse. Miles below the standard of its competitors.,2,2023,01,22
132,A Mad Good Time,"Visiting from New York we wanted to find the cutest spots for tea. Our host, Melody was the kindest person we’ve met in London. Directed us to the best foods and teas. Lovely experience ~ waiters Gabi & Jose were outstanding as well! 

Thank you for such a wonderful lunch

132,Great Barman,"Had a quick stay at The Sanderson and Anthony the barman was the highlight of our stay.  He was really friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu and made some great recommendations. I loved the mocktails he made.
Breakfast staff were great too as was the breakfast itself.
Room was lovely.",5,2023,01,21
132,Lovely Night in London,Me and my partner had a fantastic night at Sanderson to celebrate our anniversary. The staff were very attentive and left a lovely bottle of wine in our room for the special occasion. We had a great dinner in the restaurant and a drink in the Long Bar. Both restaurant and bar waiters made us feel comfortable and at home.,5,2023,01,20
132,Amazing hotel,"This hotel is amazing! We love everything in it.
the room is big and clean, the breakfast was delicious, with a lot of options.
And the best thing- the bar!!! Janos the barmen made us the most amazing cocktails we ever tasted and gave the best bar experience we ever had.
Mr. Zohaib the manager is generous, very helpful and thoughtful. And was there for us in everything we needed!
We will definitely come to stay again in this hotel!❤️❤️❤️",5,2023,01,16
132,Something a little different!,"Stayed for 2 nights this week while on business. The hotel is perfectly situated just 100 meters from my office on Wells Street but this was my first stay here.

This is a ‘quirky’ and ‘groovy’ hotel - a long way from traditional!!
Check-in was smooth and easy - staff polite and helpful.
There was no offer to help with luggage but I didn’t have much so that’s ok!
Then to the lift: we’ll, there’s style and atmosphere but this is mad! The inside of the lifts is so dark, one can’t see the buttons and until the key card is used and the buttons light up the operation can’t happen!!

The room was very different but quite nice with glass walls and curtains and a comfortable ‘slay’ bed (at an angle!)
Lighting was slightly dim and light switches not accessible from the bed.
The bathroom was very stylish and perhaps too stylish losing some practical features such as where to put your towel whilst in the shower ( I put it on the floor and then banged my head on the suspended mirror!!)
Then, the shower-head points directly at the gap in the glass door thereby causing leaks into the bathroom. I tried but I couldn’t adjust it.

However, the overall experience was good with a great bar and decent breakfast.
Will most certainly return.",4,2023,01,14
132,Mrs,"Nice and clean hotel.Huge room.Staff it's very friendly and helpful. Amazing lounge bar ,dinner and breakfast. Highly recommended.Central hotel close to many interesting places. Nice cocktails signature and amazing sushi 🍣 😋",5,2023,01,09
132,Where do I begin ?,"We visited the Sanderson to celebrate my wife’s birthday and decided to proceed with our annual trip despite rail cancellations and decided to drive from the North West to London. 
Upon arrival after driving for over 3 hours we arrived around 12:30pm we were greeted by nobody, no doorman or porter on door, I thought maybe they were on a break little did I know this was a taste of what was to come. I proceeded to unload luggage from car and my wife went into hotel to book in, the reception is at least 20 or more metres from door with 3 receptionist who I think were glued to desk as they made no attempt to come around desk to welcome us to hotel. My wife during booking was advised the room wasn’t ready but we could leave bags and they’ll be taken up to room, at this point 3 young ladies walked up to desk requesting water for there room, I am unsure why but the receptionist then left us mid booking to attend to the other guests request for water. I looked at my wife in a state of amazement but as I said earlier this was a taste of what was to come after assisting the other guests the receptionist came back to enquire the reason for our visit, the receptionist then shook my wife’s hand (this is the only time the hotel acknowledged my wife’s birthday during and after visit). We returned around 3pm to get room key only to find our luggage had not been brought up to room, we had a suite as we were travelling as a family with our 15 year old son who was given a camp bed that would have struggled to hold a 10 year old child. We complained and then we had a nightmare with the room change, my wife was told on another day that our 15 year old son was not allowed to come into bar area as they had received complaints from the public??? The waitress said ‘emails firing all over the place’ . We were eventually upgraded to the penthouse again this left a lot to be desired a very large space but dated kitchenette, no utensils in kitchenette and quite frankly was not worth the £2k a night they allegedly charge and the worst thing was finding a sex pack for sale which included condoms and add ons, for  a minute I wasn’t sure if this was a 5 star hotel in London or a hotel in Amsterdam in fact I stayed at the Andaz in Amsterdam and that indeed is a 5 star hotel and no it wasn’t left by a previous occupier the Sanderson sells this like they do candles, laundry bags and shavers.

To summarise this hotel in my opinion does not warrant 5 stars, the staff all seem to cater and be more bothered to tend to visitors from the Middle East or America’s  both continents are known for being generous tippers rather than your run of the mill English family maybe we didn’t fit the criteria. The hotel is dated granted a few pieces of artwork, beds set at a weird angle and what is with the 1990’s early 2000’s sheer net curtains hiding a multitude of sins, lots of the surfaces in reception, hallways and lifts need  cleaning and I don’t recall seeing one cleaner in general areas during our 3 day visit. The hotel is fully aware of the issues we faced upon arrival up until the day we left, I do have more but I’d need a hour to go through all my gripes. 

Won’t be returning, recommending or visiting the Sanderson Hotel again and would strongly recommend unless you are a resident of a country rich in natural resources you go to one of the other many 5 star hotels in London as the difference in service is dramatic but the price point is around the same. 

Very disappointed ☹️ visitor",1,2023,01,04
132,All in all good stay but didn't like the room,The bar and restaurant were lovely and the staff really helpful and friendly. The breakfast really nice. The rooms however felt like they were decorated in the millennium and not touched since. Not cosy and quite cold and stark feeling. We wouldn't visit again because of this.,3,2023,01,02
132,Fantastic two night stay for new years,"We loved it!. Visited the Sanderson few years ago, we decided to come back and we don't regret it! Great service from everyone but Fernando - reception manager - went above and beyond to make our stay perfect! He could not do enough for us and he even managed to get us tickets for Tottenham Hotspurs football match and they were sold out everywhere we looked! We will be returning soon.",5,2023,01,01
132,Gone down hill….,We’ve stayed at the Sanderson quite a few times and always enjoyed our stay. However we stayed in November for one night and it was extremely obvious that the standards had dropped. The first problem was no valet parking was offered then no one greeted us at the door. The reception  had no organisation. We upgraded to a suite with a balcony the room was very nice however all the balcony floor was rotten and seemed quite dangerous we then went to the bar and the staff was rude and didn’t even serve us. So we just left and went to a bar outside the premises… the straw that broke the camels back was at 2 am we was awoken by someone having a party in a room next door this completely ruing our nights sleep. When leaving the reception didn’t even ask if we had a nice stay…. We wouldn’t go back again…,1,2022,12,23
132,Great Experience,"From the moment we walked in, everything was perfect. From the guy who opened and greeted us, we found a spectacular lobby and we arrived at the reception where we were welcomed with smiles, the staff was very attentive and friendly. The room was spotless, super spacious and with all the details to have a quiet and very comfortable stay. The whole hotel has a very special decoration and makes you feel in an oasis being in the heart of London, next to Oxford St. 

The breakfast buffet is very varied but there is also the option to order a la carte dishes. All the staff were amazing, Yasmin at the reception who greeted us on arrival, and then Lay, Gabi and Daryl were serving us in a very attentive way. We ordered room service and Dorinel brought it right away and was very polite.",5,2022,12,19
132,Perfect location for dinner and show,Stayed her for our tenth anniversary and the hotel really looked after us. Booked a deluxe room which is very spacious for this part of London and highly recommended with a walk in shower and stand alone bath. Modern and quirky decor is very cool. We had a show booked on Shaftesbury and also dinner. Everything was a short walk so this a great location to boot!,5,2022,12,04
132,What a waste,Booked for 4 nights. Wi-Fi kept on dropping out. Told reception 4 times. The then said all they could do was move rooms. Wanted compensation for the first night spending all the time to get on the internet. Only change to different room. Staff lied and a said that they had no rooms to upgrade from our loft suite. What happens when we move room and we have the same problems?  Totally unhelpful staff and dishonest.,1,2022,11,27
132,Amazing hotel,"The best hotel in London , excellent location , beautiful and comfortable rooms , the hotel design is amazing, the staff is lovely , helps with everything up to the little details and they always make u feel at home. This is the only hotel I’ll go when I’m in London 😃 , Thank you for an amazing stay!🥰",5,2022,11,26
132,MOST BEAUTIFUL HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED IN!!,"I booked the Sanderson hotel as a treat for myself and daughter as I was visiting her in London. Safe to say “ treat” was an understatement! I have stayed in hotels all over the world and this hotel was one of the most beautiful in so many ways! 
Entrance 
On entering the hotel we were met by two doormen (security) who promptly opened the doors for us on arrival and who greeted us with lovely smiles. One of the doormen Szilárd asked If we had , had a nice day to which we could briefly explain that we had. This was so wonderful as it instantly put us at ease especially when entering a 5* hotel, which can often feel intimidating.
Reception 
We then proceeded to make our way to the front reception to check in. We were again greeted by 3-4 beautiful smiling women who checked us in. Nothing was to much for them and they appeared to go above and beyond in making sure we felt welcomed and excited about our stay. All information that we would need was communicated efficiently and all questions were answered with a real knowledge of the hotel. 
Our room
WOW !!! Our room was beautiful!!! Clean , crisp , stylish and with an added class that ran through the theme of the whole hotel. 10 mins after being in our room a member of staff delivered a plate of macarons and chocolates. They were so delicious and really made you feel special. The bathroom had a shower and a bath which were spotlessly clean with robes and slippers we could use for the duration of our stay. We both had a bath before dinner and instantly felt relaxed which was amazing after our day walking around London. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever experienced in a hotel. It also had a big tv, tea and coffee machines, again… absolutely amazing as I love my tea! With ample amounts of milk and tea bags so we definitely got our fill. The room had a full length mirror and a great mirror in the bathroom for makeup. 
Dinner 
Instead of eating out in London we decided to eat dinner in the hotel and I’m so glad we did!! We ordered a few snacks and starters followed by a main course that we shared, we are not big eaters but also wanted to try as much as we could from the hotel’s wonderful menu. Our waiter was Billal and he went above and beyond for us. Polite, friendly and dressed like a new pin. There is nothing this restaurant could improve on in my eyes! They were quick , efficient, friendly and funny while always keeping the professional standards of the hotel held high. A staff member called Rita also attended our table who again was exceptional at her job and even complimented my nails. 
The long Bar 
We sat at the long bar which is beautiful in itself. A classy and sophisticated atmosphere that felt trendy and high class but not pretentious. We were served cocktails by Jonny and Janos . This experience was definitely the highlight of our trip! Cocktails skilfully crafted by these two gentlemen were the icing on the cake. Friendly, professional staff that appear to genuinely be interested in you as a person. They were extremely attentive and made us our favourites plus other cocktails they thought we would love , and we did! 
Breakfast 
Breakfast was served by Darrel who again was very professional. We had the choice to order off the menu but we really didn’t need to. The buffet was outstanding… a cooked breakfast was available followed by pastries, fruit, cereal, cheeses, yoghurts. They also had plenty of options for individuals with different dietary needs. Tea and coffee was brought over with a smile. 
Overall 
The Sanderson hotel is one of the finest hotels I’ve ever had the pleasure of staying in. There is nothing I could fault about it. From the moment you enter till the moment you leave you are treated with such kindness and consideration. The staff are exemplary!!! I would rate it even higher than a 5* hotel. The rooms , bar , restaurant and facilities are beautiful but it’s the staff that make this hotel fabulous! They are an asset to the Sanderson name. I’m already planning my next trip back I will probably have to bring my husband next time as I have raved about it so much. Thank you Sanderson family for making my daughter and I stay to special!

132,Best chic hotel in London,"Best hotel in London accordingly to me and my husband.
We celebrated our wedding day during our trip and received a bottle of champagne and some sweets which was really appreciated and a happy surprise! 
Attentive staff, clean and chic hotel with the most delicious smell.
Everyone at the front office was really helpful, big kudos to Zohaib for helping us out when needed.
Already been 2 times to this hotel and will be more to come.
Thanks again!",5,2022,11,03
132,Mad Hatters afternoon tea,"Mad Hatters afternoon tea. An awesome experience with good food, amazing tea and such a friendly staff! We are for sure returning! 
They add a 12,5 service charge and if you want water thats 5 pounds extra, thats the only downside. They could include water and the service charge in the price",5,2022,11,01
132,Mad Hatters Afternoon Tea,"Amazing experience with great and attentive customer service! 
We can strongly recommend the Afternoon Tea at Sanderson! Everything was so delicious! 
A special thanks to Olivier for looking after us like royalties!",5,2022,10,31
132,5 Star Treatment," Welcomed by friendly, professional staff, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We had mocktails at the bar, they were very unique and beautifully presented. We ate in the restaurant and the sushi we ordered - Spicy Tuna and California roll (rolled in caviar) was the best sushi I have ever had, bar none. The staff knew the menu, made recommendations and accommodated our requests. We will definitely be going back for the Mad Hatters Afternoon Tea! I would recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2022,10,30
132,Lack lustre and rough around the edges - overdue for an extensive upgrade.,"okay, so positives first - the rooms are large, and the bed is comfortable (if at a very odd angle that's surely bad Feng shui) Good pressure in shower with hot water & good Malin Goetz products (not available to take away) Free waters replenished daily (though no free soft drinks as per other hotels). Super central location. 

sadly there's more negatives than there are positives:
- firstly it is very rough around the edges, the reception itself feels dated, staff are sweet and young, if a bit useless. 
- in the room and surfaces were dusty as were the glass lampshades (superior room)
- around light switches and electrical sockets cracked, carpets discoloured and fraying etc. 
- my room was on 4th floor but still heard music from the courtyard / club each night until around 11pm, but then it does stop. Awful soundproofing - people heard walking in corridor etc. When coming back to the hotel at night the lobby literally turns into a nightclub, so bear this in mind. 
- bathroom light flickered and basically couldn't be used because of this. 
- plenty of drawers for storage, though not enough hangers at all (I was staying for a week). 
- electric golden curtain didn't work, not that I would have wanted it retracted. 
- TV large, but weirdly no access to Sky channels (movies, news channels etc - only Freeview, which is... limited) and no way to screen mirror from phone as in other hotels. 
- no herbal teas, only coffee and English breakfast / Earl Grey 
- breakfast limited, for anything substantial you have to pay extra a la cart.
- light switches strangely far from bed / bathroom. 
- most annoyingly, zero amenities - no toothbrush, toothpaste, earbuds, razor etc literally only a flannel, towels and body cream. they say toothbrushes and razors are available for a price (which brings me to next point) but after Soho House hotel where there is a plethora of amenities provided and expected to be taken away, you cannot provide nothing.  
- the thing I found most annoying was in the room there is a laundry bag, scented candle, snacks, wine etc etc and each has a little sticker which says : ‘if tab broken full price will be added to your room’ which I just think is the most gauche thing a hotel, let alone a supposedly 5* hotel can do. 

Basically its crazy to me that this is a 5* hotel, whilst the bed is comfortable and the room large, everything else, the sheer lack of amenities, does not reflect this status.

132,Mad Hatters Afternoon Tea,"The service that the host Sofia provided was exceptional. She was attentive, welcoming, funny and most of all she made us feel comfortable. Her service was definitely a 10 out of 10 - she recommended a cold chocolate drink which was excellent.",5,2022,10,20
132,Love the Sanderson,"This was our second stay at the Sanderson and it was another enjoyable experience!   Beautiful hotel, helpful staff and and a perfect location.  I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a fun experience in the soho neighbourhood.",5,2022,10,18
132,One day in London,"My wife and I and two of our adult children travelled from Toronto and Genva respectively for a funeral at the Welsh Chapel in Central London. We had reserved three rooms in the hotel for the night. My wife and I had to get an earlier flight from Toronto so arrived in the morning. The staff found us a room by 12 noon which was most welcome. The rooms are a bit spartan but comfortable. That night we had an excellent dinner in the hotel restaurant. The bed was very comfortable, so we were not too jet lagged the next day. Overall, a good experience for a sad occasion.",5,2022,10,18
132,Modern elegance with the best customer service,"It’s tough to find hotels in London with a modern ambience. It’s a matter of personal choice I guess but Sanderson is where I have been staying for over 6 years now and I continue to find them to be very impressive. Rooms are bright and elegant with clean lines. No goddy dark carpets or ancient looking furniture. The long bar is excellent. Gym is practical and sufficiently large with both cardio and weights equipment. 
The highlight I guess is the customer service. On my recent trip, Priyesh at the front desk went above and beyond to get me a very early check-in. He offered to help even with an Amazon parcel I wanted to have sent back to the Royal Mail center. They just genuinely want their customers to be happy. If I am coming to London I’m always staying here.",5,2022,09,25
132,Not there yet but on the right track,"The Sanderson is a timeless design icon and although Philippe Starck doesn't get old, the hotel is due for a needed upgrade. We stayed just as they had reopened after COVID and while it was obviously not quite where it used to be, the committed and dedicated staff made up for any shortcomings (except the light bulbs in the lobby). Kudos to the Front Office and Olivier in F&B!",4,2022,09,12
132,Sushi night with friends!,"Last Friday, 22nd of July, I went with three friends to the long bar at Sanderson Hotel, where we had the change to try some sushi and four signature cocktails recommended by Marta one of the managers. It was all amazing, we will be definitely back!!!",5,2022,07,24
132,Terrible experience,"Although the hotel appears to be in excellent condition on the outside, there are many problems on the inside, particularly in terms of management. The reservation was made through booking.com, and it had to be amended. Although booking.com accepted the change, they refused to implement it, making the process extremely difficult for us. The hotel manager informed us that he had a meeting and was unable to speak with us. Instead he watched everything behind the curtains at 7 o'clock in the evening. I found the hotel management to be extremely unprofessional and the staff to be unhelpful. Despite their repeated apologies, they did not say anything meaningful and even accused us of lying. Ultimately, we had to spend half a day amending our booking and they made no effort to do so. In spite of the fact that we have stayed in other hotels as 3 stars, this was the first time we have experienced this type of service level. In my opinion, they do not deserve any stars at all.",1,2022,07,18
132,Not a bad experience,"Pros: prime location (one minute to Oxford street (Regent street area) modern cool hotel, room was larger than expected and very clean, breakfast was excellent: nice selection buffet and wonderful fresh fruit and dishes made upon request. Cons: wall thin as paper, noisy music from the bar heard at second floor room during afternoon and evening. Room not refreshed even upon request, and the worst: night before checkout, we returned to a locked door! The manager at the reception explained that he wanted us to pay now for our checkout. No reason at all for this, the hotel already claimed 100 pounds per day for guarantee and check out was due the next morning. Shocked and upset my husband explained this and we were given a key to our room. Unbelievable. Staff is mostly friendly, both staff and guests are mostly of middle eastern origin.",4,2022,07,11
132,Coolest hotel lobby,"I absolutely LOVED LOVED LOVED this hotel!!! It felt like it was personally curated for me and well, that is always a magical feeling.
check in team were genuinely pleased to welcome guests and couldn't do enough to accommodate special requests- big shoutout to Zohaib Khan Front Office Operations Manager.
The professionalism, the coolness and the
overall vibe of the place was exceptional.
A cozy and modern hotel located in a beautiful neighborhood, Staff are super friendly and the service is impeccable.",5,2022,06,18
132,West End Hotel with a Unique Twist in Design,"A Hotel with its own twist within  Fitzrovia in the West End of London.

The Long Bar is impressive with a varied cocktail menu. 

Breakfast buffet and set menus is very good 

The Staff from entering the Hotel upon check in to the bar and restaurant staff are super friendly",4,2022,06,16
132,Great stay - highly recommended,"My friend and I selected the Sanderson for our recent London stay since they had a good price on rooms with 2 beds (harder to find in London than you would think) and the rooms were very large (over 600 sq ft).  We were staying 6 days so we didn't want to be cramped.  I had read a few reviews complaining of construction noise, but had emailed with the hotel and they assured me our room wouldn't be near the construction (actually they said they don't book any rooms near construction).  Both of us are light sleepers and our trip would've been ruined if we'd be awakened early by noise.  The hotel is GREAT!  Our room was huge as promised with a giant bathroom area.  The ""closet"" is in the bathroom which seemed kind of odd but worked out fine.  Lots of room - 2 sides for hanging items and a bunch of shelves.  The room was SUPER QUIET.  We never heard any noise.  Employees were nice and always willing to take pics for us on our way out.  The gym is very well appointed. I loved having a refrigerator in the room (had to just get the minibar cleaned out so I could use it).  Plus the rates were great.  The hotel bar is mainly low key, although was a bit crowded on Thurs and Fri nights.  The outside bar/restaurant wasn't yet open in late May but I think was to be open soon.  Perhaps since this was closed the rates were lower than normal but it was a great value for a wonderful stay.  Also we loved the location with lots of places we wanted to go within walking distance.  Our only minor complaint is that our room had one little tiny wastebasket and that is not enough for a large room with 2 ladies staying it in so maybe that was an error but I'd suggest getting 1-2 more wastebaskets.  We would both stay here again and totally recommend the Sanderson!",5,2022,06,10
132,Wow! Simply amazing,"From the warm welcome , to the background music , delicious food , lovely cocktails, amazing staff and comfortable room. I was there for 6nights and simply loved it. The breakfast was amazing and fresh . Staff remembered my name and was very attentive. Had a few cocktails  one night with friends and we all loved  it. It’s a great hotel and I loved its vibe and atmosphere .I will be staying here again and recommend my friends as well. Thank to the wonderful team for making my stay an amazing one.",5,2022,06,06
132,Amazing!!!,"Perhaps the coolest hotel lobby in London. My friends and I had the pleasure to visit the Sanderson hotel for a cocktail experience, we must say that the service and the presentation of the cocktails were outstanding.  A special thanks to Marta and team for looking  after us. 10/10.",5,2022,06,04
132,Surprisingly outstanding value for money. Just go and enjoy fab experience. ,"Outstanding meal with wide and varied choice on the menu. All staff went out of their way to be helpful, friendly and attentive.  Extraordinary value for money which was completely unexpected! Great atmosphere in part created by fine background music.. what's not to like you must go!",5,2022,05,31
132,"Disappointing rooms, much better hotels in central London","Family of four with teenage boys. We had a suite and a large double interconnected. The suite was the only way of basically getting a twin room as they allow an extra bed in a suite. However despite loads of floor space the extra bed was a tiny rubbish camp bed barely suitable for a toddler that they charged us an extra £50 per night for on top of  the price of the suite.

The rooms were bizarre and just really poorly designed. Industrial cold feel to them. 
Odd tiny one seater ‘sofa’ even though there is plenty of room for a bigger one. Glass partitions for the toilet (no lock or even door that closes fully) and bathroom also glass sided and actually in the bedroom so don’t book if you want any privacy. Teeny glass sided shower with tight shower controls and a spray that shoots all over the floor. Tiny sink. Nowhere nearby to hang a towel when in the shower. 
More cupboard space than most houses but only a small hanging rail which was weirdly open plan in the bathroom. Hard floors in bedroom so not at all cozy. Rang for some milk and waited so long we wanted to go to bed so rang back to try and cancel it but the room service person who answered just screamed at us she was on another call and we couldn’t say a word. Milk never turned up anyway. 
No plug points reachable from bedside tables for phone or alarm. Just felt like it had been designed by someone who never actually stays in a hotel and certainly not as a family.
View out the window was a grubby courtyard and noisy when people were in the bar. 
We have stayed at loads of London hotels as a family and this one just felt really odd and uncomfortable. Won’t be back.",2,2022,05,29
132,"Nice lifestyle hotel, aa lot of TLC required","Hotel is quirky, with out of place furniture and some great design features from the building and the outdoor terrace
Service is much better by the younger staff than by some more senior staff, who display somewhat arrogant attitude
Bathroom is not practical : cannot heta separate from room (no doors) and nowhere to leave your toiletries in the shower, must place on the floor
Overall comfortable rooms",4,2022,05,29
132,Super,"What a Lovely Day. 

Fabulous Cocktails & Great food

And great service too. 

Everything recommended. 

Thank you!

Ps. Not sure why I can’t submit my review. Apparently it has to be 200 characters? Really?  Yep, that’s marketing for you. Is that enough?",4,2022,05,28
132,Yes and No,"YES:  Great location, price, service with friendly staff, bedding, toiletries &  clean rooms.  Lots of windows with great light. Plugs & USBs by bed and table.  Room service! In-room coffee, tea and bottles of water at night.
NO:   Noisy.  Requested a quiet room but got a room right next to the building construction next door.  They did move me to a room away from the construction but on Tues & Friday night I could hear loud music in my room until 11pm (really irritating).  Finally, there is nowhere to put toiletries in the shower except the dirty, wet shower floor.  Style over substance - a big miss on the design side.
Won't stay again because of the noise.  Can't afford to loose that much sleep.",3,2022,05,27
132,Disappointed for supposedly 5 star hotel visit,"Arrived at the Sanderson on Saturday afternoon and discovered the Purple Bar, the courtyard and the spa were all closed. Wanted a drink, but the only bar doesn’t open until 4.00pm. Went to the room and put 2 shirts away for pressing then had to go across to another hotel for a drink as you can’t even get one on room service, and the minibar hadn’t been refilled. Came back later on to find one shirt on a plastic bag and one in the wardrobe but pressed terribly. Next morning phoned for room service breakfast to be told that wasn’t available. Sent shirts away for pressing again, asked for minibar to be filled, again. Nobody seemed to know what was happening and it was hard to explain to a housekeeping member of staff due to his lack of understanding of English. We paid £2700 for a 3 night stay in a loft room with terrace so not cheap but very disappointed with the lack of basic hotel expectations and won’t be back",1,2022,05,24
132,Interesting experience,"Lobby experience is novel - plenty of art deco installations and interesting furniture.  The counter staff were calm, competent and friendly and check in was efficient.  They took a £100 deposit for ""extras"" and, because I'm not particularly well travelled, I did rather resent the implication of them doing so.  I don't think you can call any establishment 5 star that treats guests with that level of suspicion the moment they walk through the door.

Good security as the lift was activated by a door key card.
The room corridors were dark and atmospheric with occasional lighting built into the floor. 

We had a superior room and at first glance, it looked impressive with a large double bed and a large screen TV on a wall bracket. The bedroom area was split from the shower and toilet area by a large glass wall with a curtain to provide some privacy but there were a few form over function issues - for instance, a trip to the loo during the night involved manoeuvring round some of these glass walls - occasionally unsuccessfully.  Plus, placing a toilet in a glass cubicle  - even if slightly frosted, does nothing for your dignity.  The shower cubicle was also similarly frosted and, although the shower was powerful, the shower head gasket was leaking badly.

The form over function issue continued when I needed to charge my phone.  The plug socket was in no-mans land on a wall by the bed so I was in danger of treading on it during the night - why couldn't they have put some sockets next to a table?

One other matter that irked me was the positioning of the two bottles of water by the bed.  Very little is complementary in this hotel and there was nothing to say that these items had a cost.  Had they been with the other minibar items, it might have been clearer.  We didn't partake but this comes perilously close to sharp practice. 

The tea and coffee facilities were good with a Lavazza pod machine and a small kettle and the air conditioning in the room was efficient if a tad noisy (we had to switch it off to get a night's sleep) but I'd rather have it there if needed on a hot night.

No noise detected from other rooms so sound proofing is good.  We didn't try the restaurant or bar area but they both looked well appointed and the staff were welcoming when we looked around.

I've been in several other four and five star hotels in London that had far worse accommodation than this and, despite my nit-picking, we did have an enjoyable stay having chosen this hotel because of its proximity to theatreland.",4,2022,05,21
132,Lovely break away.,"Absolutely loved our time here. The rooms are lovely. The staff are absolutely amazing. Really made our stay wonderful. We felt like royalty! Honestly, couldn’t do enough for us. My partner asked me to marry him and the staff did our room up for us 🥰🥰 really made it special. Thank you so so much! Will definitely be returning xx",5,2022,05,13
132,Avoid This Shambles,"There are many reasons to quickly run away from this hotel right now.
First, it’s a construction site. The drilling and hammering starts at 8am. But that’s not all. The check-in was incredibly slow - it took more than half an hour to get a key, for heaven's sake! The staff said there was a new check-in system that was causing problems. Whatever was happening, it was hard to find anyone who could sort out the mess.
The main bar does not open until 4pm. The Purple Bar is closed completely. There is no room service. I didn’t dare try the restaurant. There was no complimentary water in the room. The fridge didn't work properly. Yet they still have the cheek to charge more than £300 per night! 
I pointed all this out a ""manager"" and in return I was given a room right over the building site works. Tut tut. You’d think they’d bend over backwards to make it up to customers for their lack of amenities. But no. 
It's also worth noting that missing facilities are not marked on the booking websites. Expedia still says ""room service available"", when it certainly is not. 
I had another room reservation pending. I have cancelled that in light of this visit. What a shame. Hopefully, they’ll fix all this at some point. Don't go until they do.",1,2022,04,26
132,Great stay at the Sanderson,"Not the first time here, but the first since CV19.  In fact we have stayed 5 maybe 6 times before.  This time the reception staff were great as were the bar staff.  Clearly they are short of staff, especially at breakfast.

In fact the bar staff were all excellent, although the bar was surprisingly quiet.

The room (125) was clean and tidy, with the bed comfortable.  Window blinds were a bit broken, and the motorised golden curtain non-functional (i suspect these stopped working years ago).

But......breakfast was chaos, not enough staff, service was slow, cooked breakfast was not very hot.....",4,2022,04,25
132,Fantastic staff and event management!,"We gave The Sanderson two weeks notice to host a 100 person company networking event. Olivier an his team absolutely smashed it. The service, drinks and food were outstanding, we had fantastic feedback on the venue from all in attendance. No problem was too great, everything was super smooth. Particularly as they have only recently opened back up. 
Highly recommended and will be continuing to use for more corporate events & stays.",5,2022,04,13
132,Disappointingly poor,"I had high hopes for our first stay at the Sanderson, but perhaps I was too optimistic! Our room had a broken fridge, a faulty bedside light, the bath leaked as soon as the taps were turned on and flooded the room, the telephone didn’t work and flashed constantly all through the night, the door on the shower didn’t fit the space so had to be forced closed and although we reported all of these things to reception it is difficult to praise their responses!  The fridge was replaced - although this was done at 10pm when I was in bed and wished to sleep! The bath was fixed, but not until the third and last day of our stay so I never got to have one. The light and the telephone were never fixed or replaced so if you’re offered room 208 I would decline it! I gave up asking about the shower door. As previous March reviewers have mentioned, there’s a massive building site next door, it’s really noisy and work starts early every day, even a Saturday. Oddly when I asked on our first night what the noise was and if there were any building works going on the Receptionist looked very surprised and said no - we had a laugh the next day in daylight when we went outside and saw the huge construction site right next door.  The Receptionist is a great actress!  Room service and many other facilities were apparently not ready or available for our stay, but the price did not reflect this.  To provide a fair and balanced review, I must commend and say thank you to a few of the doormen and lobby staff who were always pleasant, respectful and cheerful.",2,2022,03,29
132,Not what it used to be... disappointing,"You would expect if a venue had been closed for over 2 years, some refurbishment would have been done. The style is old and outdated, the staff seems clueless. I had a drink at the long bar, and I have to say, the drinks were disappointing, the menu limited. A shame that the pandemic seems to have damaged the quality of the Sanderson.",1,2022,03,28
132,"Next to major, very loud construction site. Facilities closed for 'renovations' don't book till AFTER Autumn 2022!","This is still an iconic stylish hotel with funky, sleek design on the edge of Soho, but after Covid closure it has been reopened prematurely with on-going internal renovations and therefore limited facilities.  
My advice would not to book at this time.

Another major issue is that it is right next to a major building construction site. Every morning including Saturday we were awoken by loud banging noises and scaffolding being erected very close by. 

At no point did the hotel warn guests about this inconvenience.  

On Saturday after a late night we had room Room Service service knocking on the door at 9am, which seems far too early to disturb guests on a weekend. 

Water bottles and empty shower gel was not replaced by room service.  
However, the front-desk staff seemed friendly and helpful.

The Mad Hatters Tea and Purple Bar all closed due to 'renovations', so it seems the room rate remains high, but the facilities are not what they used to be pre-covid.

I used to stay at Sanderson hotel a lot in its heyday, so I was really disappointed by this recent stay and their hotel Management needs to work hard to rebuild the reputation of the past and help previously loyal guest, like myself understand why I should return based on this experience of March 2022!",2,2022,03,28
132,Has a bath!,"I stayed only overnight - but it was perfect. The room had a bath and a super comfortable bed. The place was super clean. I left my phone there and they are posting it back. 

The only struggle is reaching them by phone. There seems to be an issue when you press 1 to connect to general. It just drops out. I connected via email. 

Really cool decor too. I'd stay here again.",5,2022,03,27
132,Totally gone!,"Absolute disaster. The place is in ruins. Dated and needs closure. Don’t book this hotel if you think back to its gay days. Be warned!!!! Nothing is even open….even for a drink lol. 
Everything seems 20 years ago and the place is so run down it’s embarrassing. The bar isn’t even open and nobody here !!!  Joke!!!!",1,2022,03,22

132,Birthday drinks and dinner,Excellent night out with friends and family. We had dinner in the restaurant and then drinks at the fabulous and famous  Long Bar.

132,Noughties Iconic Hotel,"We are regular visitors to London & on our most recent visit , early February we decided on staying at the iconic noughties Sanderson Hotel. 
The exterior is is rather bland & reminiscent of 1960's/70's. 
The interior though is all very modern & styled in a sleek millennium/noughties way. Some of it though is starting to look just a little bit faded.
From greeting at front door to when we left the staff were all continuously warm & friendly.
We arrived much earlier than recommended check-in, but that was no problem to the friendly receptionist who accommodated us early & upgraded our room to what I believe was a suite. This was very much appreciated.
We stepped into a lift, which was like stepping into a very small nightclub!!!!
Room was lovely. Very sleek modern with an open plan feel to everything.
The most comfortable sleigh bed & also came with a roll top bath & a separate sitting area.
The room was also incredibly quiet.
All the amenities (bath robes/slippers etc) were all available.
Check-out the following day was swift & easy (receptionist even remembered we were staying there to see Madonna at The London Palladium) We were able to leave our overnight bag there, picking it up much later.
In essence a very pleasant stay in an iconic hotel with friendly & welcoming staff.",5,2020,02,28
132,Fabulous stylish friendly,"We stayed one night at The Sanderson. Firstly the building is beautiful. Great 1960s architecture that’s been brought into the 21st century. Lobby is edgy and fun and our loft suite was massive and very stylish. 

The hotel is spotless. Check in was quick, friendly and helpful. Checkout equally good. Door staff are friendly and welcoming. 

The Long Bar is just great - a nice place to sit and watch! Great drinks and swift service. 

All in all The Sanderson is a lovely stylish well located hotel. Really recommended!",5,2020,02,07
132,Mad hatters afternoon tea- amazing,"A lovely and quirky afternoon with such attention to detail sandwiches, potions of tea mix, lovely scones and 🍰 - gorgeous food and replenished +++and takeaway boxes for cakes and sandwiches. Set in an external courtyard with heaters and blankets ",5,2020,02,05
132,Seen better days ,"The Sanderson was once way ahead of the game in terms of innovative design and service but sadly I think that time had passed. 

Our check in was due for 3pm - which the receptionist tried to move back until 4pm - which seems very late to me. They did however after much discussion switch rooms (upgraded) and got us in a 3pm. 

The room while open and bright lacked the updated travel essentials like USB sockets and easy to reach outlets (a white extension cord was provided). The room, while interesting, just didn’t flow well with a huge bathroom divided by a bulky structural pillar and awkwardly placed shower and WC (no bath, weird).

The amenities also felt a little tired - the hairdryer for one, not great at all.
Our greeting a breakfast was a brisk “let’s get to it then” and we waited for at least 10 minutes for any plates to arrive at the continental buffet. 

The Sanderson eggs À la Carte option (poached eggs with avocado) was only just warm, the avocado pulverised and overpowered by way too much spring onion, not great for a morning!

Upon check out we were left with a simple “Thats all then” by the receptionist, with no question about how our stay was. 

All in all it was a very mediocre stay at a hotel that used to be great.",2,2020,01,30
132,Excellent service,"Excellent service, nice spatious room, wonderfull cocktails, the staff is very helpfull and friendly, efficient and well equiped to deal with very spoiled travelers, many of whom were present!
We had a cheaper deal so were reluctant to ask for more than a great deal allready!however that made no difference at all, we were treated like royalty! ",5,2020,01,27
132,Whimsical Afternoon Tea,"I would say 3.5 stars, but since we are not allowed to give a half star... 
This is a review on their afternoon tea. At the hostess station, we told them we have a reservation for afternoon tea. It was like a large tent, had an upscale, whimsical feel to it. I liked the greeneries everywhere. 

They had a book and a box on each table, the book was utilized as a menu holder. White box was full of sugar, with a tiny little ballerina in it. Loved this!

Once we were settled, a staff brought over the choices of tea in bottles. Each one named in Alice in Wonderland theme. When the three-tiered afternoon tea treats arrived, we were all excited. They were so cute and whimsical! It came with loads of tasty-looking items.   

We had: 
Smoked Salmon Scotch Quails Egg,
Stack of King of Hearts Ham and Parmesan croque-monsieur,
Cornish Crab Brioche Roll,
White Rabbit Cucumber and Cream Cheese Sandwich,
Alice's Exotic Fruits Drink Me Potion,
Queen of Hearts rose and strawberry Jammy Dodger  
Mocha chessboard gateau,
Tweedle Dee lemon curd financier,
Mad March Hare vanilla pocket watch macaroon,
Chocolate and raspberry Blue Caterpillar,
Wonderland marshmallow magic mushrooms,
Mad Hatters lost carrot meringue,
Sandersons warm scones

When we were getting close to the end, a staff brought a little flower pots for everyone. It was Salted Caramel Ice Cream with Honeycomb on top. It was really tasty! 

We had a fun, whimsical afternoon tea here for sure. The quality of each food item was, well, more “style over substance” if you know what I mean. They all looked great, but the flavor was not as strong for most. The savory items had better, stronger flavor than the sweets. Most of the baked goods and desserts were overly sweet. We still enjoyed the experience for sure.",4,2020,01,25
132,21st birthday present for my stepdaughter,"Arranged this weekend stay for my daughter and her partner. The staff were very helpful in making this stay with them special. 
The decor throughout the hotel is amazing and the staff efficient and friendly. They arranged an upgrade upon check in and the delux room was big and very comfortable. 
Perfect location for exploring central London. ",5,2020,01,19
132,As always a great stay!,"We have stayed at this hotel each time we have visited London to attend a show at the Palladium. As always our stay was perfect! From the minute we stepped out of the taxi and were helped into the reception by the porter, to the minute we left, the staff were amazingly kind and helpful. In particular, Andrea on reception who when he found out it was my husband's birthday had a bottle of wine delivered to our room. Such a lovely gesture! Our room was ready early, which was great as we were seeing a matinee show and an evening show and going straight from one to the other. When we got to our room, some shopping had been put in there that didn't belong to us, and when we rang reception to tell them they sent someone to remove it immediately and apologised profusely. These things happen! On our return to the hotel later, we went into the Purple bar and sampled a few cocktails. Always great in there and a fun atmosphere. Love the quirkiness of this bar, in fact the whole hotel is quirky. Our room was a basic one, but very clean and we love the bathrooms. Great showers and lovely big fluffy towels. Excellent toiletries too. We were at the front of the hotel, but were not disturbed by traffic as windows well insulated. Great tea and coffee making facilities with a kettle and coffee machine. We had room service for breakfast and this was brilliant, still hot, really tasty, plentiful and fresh. Really enjoyed it. On checking out we were going straight to the station and a taxi was called for us and was waiting when we left. Again the porter helped us with our bags! An excellent stay and we look forward to the next one! A very special hotel!",5,2020,01,13
132,Great time at the Mad Hatters tea,"My teenage daughter and I were in London for a few days over New Years and enjoyed tea at several restaurants. Our first was at the Sanderson and we enjoyed it very much. We first appreciated their flexibility- we had an issue at our hotel and were delayed getting to the Sanderson but they graciously moved our res back. The room is really lovely - a tented courtyard with nice plants and colorful heating lamps. I am always cold but was very comfortable here. The waiter brought over a bunch of small glass bottles which contained teas, and playing cards with descriptions of them, each named after something in Alice in wonderland. The place settings were also beautiful and creative (my daughter’s was a zebra!). The sandwiches were delicious and I had a great very selection. My daughter and I love scones and these were excellent. We barely had room to eat the sweets, but we tried each and liked them very much. The tea and food were delicious and the service was excellent. It was fun to have tea in such a unique and creative setting and we recommend it.",5,2020,01,04
132,Mad hatter's tea party,"What a memorable afternoon! The staff, particularly Renate and Chris, were so attentive, looking after us and making sure that we all felt truly special. The food was delicious and the attention to detail to fit the theme was inspiring. Thank you so much and we would all fully recommend the experience. ",5,2020,01,04
132,Mad Hatter's Tipsy Evening Tea,"After reading some of the previous reviews we were a little apprehensive about our booking however we needn't have worried, we had a superb evening. The waiter, Arran, was very friendly and attentive without being overbearing. We were not rushed and enjoyed all our food and cocktails. We had a most enjoyable time. ",5,2020,01,03
132,"Average stay, I would be back ","Check in and concierge are OK. Not super but nothing to complain about. They were able to accommodate my early check in which was super. The Bellmen are very nice and helpful. I didn’t use the food services.

Room: a bit confusing to navigate at first especially regarding all the light switches. Impossible to go to the bathroom without waking somebody up. The water pressure is good but it’s a bit of a confusing system and there’s no latch to put soaps on, have to put them on the floor (bit weird for 5 star establishment). 
",4,2020,01,02
132,Beautiful hotel,"A beautiful Designed hotel 
Nice bar, great location,near everything!
Breakfast was expensive and not worth it.
Amazing stuff and service was excellent 
Nice room and very big bathroom,very clean 
I really recommend to stay here!",5,2020,01,01
132,We are really MAD @ the quality of the mad hatters afternoon tea @ Sanderson,"Upon arriving @ Sanderson’s we were greeted by a lovely gent and shown in. We went past the bar to the check in desk at the front of the restaurant. We checked in and we’re took back past the bar to a marquee with infraRed heaters that let’s face it are pretty crap! And a table with blankets on the chairs. I was glad I’d wrapped up for the day as our girls needed the extra blankets to stay warm in the tent! We waited a good while before the teas and food were bought to the table so I expected it all too be freshly made esp as we’d changed a couple of sandwich fillings. Well when we did get the food, the croque monsieur wasn’t properly cooked and was cold, the other sandwiches and mini rolls were stale or lacked filling. The cakes were ok but the scones were solid and we had a hard job to bite them. They were more dense than a solid rock! The teas were nice but again when these were delivered to the table to were told the waiter would be back to pour them as they weren’t brewed yet.. he never came back and they took forever to bring a cocktail. The non alcoholic cocktail/smoothie was amazing tho! We weren't bothered that it was going to cost £270 for 2 adults 2 kids afternoon teas as we expected to pay that for a special occasion and thought we would be treated better than offloaded to a tent and stale food for a good chunk of money. We expected a lot more of the occasion really. We were expecting a bit of a theatrical experience with it being named as mad hatters tea party! There wasn’t much resemblance to mad hatters, there was a picture on the crockery n a couple of cakes were themed but other than that it was a massive disappointment, and defiantly not worth the money. Feel majorly disappointed as this was a present to our family from my parents and we were thoroughly looking forward to celebrating hubbys day there. Was hoping to return to the restaurant on the weekend for another meal as reviews had been good but we feel majorly disheartened by our experience, we’ve seen more mad hatters at a Nursing home",2,2019,12,26
132,Birthday Celebration,"We booked this hotel for our sisters birthday. There was 6 of us in total.
When we arrived we were greeted by a lovely Italian receptionist who was determined to make sure we had a lovely time together.
The hotel is modern and the rooms are extremely comfortable.
We had 3 rooms and were surprised with a bottle of Veuve Champagne for our celebrations.
We had dinner in the restaurant and again the staff were very attentive and thoughtful with meal choices as one of us are Vegan.
The bar was lovely and it had a lovely ambience.
The service overall was very nice and professional.
Would definitely come again.",4,2019,12,18
132,Good choice,"Nice hotel, modern design, comfortable room, very nice bar, and nice breakfast too. Service was very nice, staff was professional. Location is perfect, walking distance to center of london and shops. It was a good choice",4,2019,12,14
132,The best location in london,"The hotel is located in Fitzrovia and it is very easy to go everywhere by foot because it is located in the center of London and close to everything- covent garden, Carnaby street, Oxford street.
I was in the hotel three years ago at august 2016 and I was really satisfied from the hotel,
But at the second visit, at July 2019, I am a little bit disappointed if I need to compare to the previous visit.
The doorman was really nice but I felt that the service is not good as i remembered it. I asked for a blanket and for bathroom stuff and it took more than half an hour until i got it to my room and I also called them more than one time.
The room is very big and Comfortable . The rooms and the hotel designed well, beautiful and special.
We ate breakfast at the hotel only one time and it was really good.
When we arrived to the hotel, the room was not ready yet so the staff of the hotel told us to wait and they gave as free drink as a compensation. At our last day we ate the after noon tea and it was really special experiment but it was expensive.",4,2019,12,02
132,Wonderful & memorable stay! ,"If you’re looking for a nice balcony room in London, I believe this “loft Terrace suite” is one of the best choice. The Philippe Starck  designed room was very clean, stylish and comfortable with a huge cozy terrace. ( City rooftop view but a bit too close to the opposite buildings, sound insulation is not too good )
As a suite, size is comparatively small but I think still more than enough for a couple. 

Very friendly and helpful staffs, much appreciated the team of concierge and made my stay flawless. Excellent location, highly recommended for all Shopaholic & the people who love nice deco. ",5,2019,11,20
132,The most amazing visit!,"I booked this hotel for myself and my mum to enjoy for her 40th birthday, and honestly couldn’t have been more impressed - from the amazing service, to the lovely finishing touches, everything was just perfect!

Upon arrival, we mentioned to the reception staff that we were there for my mums 40th, and they kindly upgraded us to the deluxe room which was so spacious and even included a stand alone bath - so luxury! This was already a great start to our 2 night stay.

Throughout the entirety of our stay, everything was so perfect and all the staff were so kind. The rooms were so clean, and they were cleaned everyday. We also were offered a turn down service which was a really nice touch. Every time we left and returned to the hotel, the doors were kindly opened for us and we were greeted every time - everyone was always so kind and genuine!

On our last day, my mum unfortunately got a really bad migraine, and was extremely unwell. We were checking out on this day, and were supposed to be out by 12pm - but this just wasn’t going to happen. I rang down to the reception staff, and they were more than happy to extend our stay until my mum felt better. They also offered to get her anything that she needed. Once we were ready to leave, one of the staff members came up to our room, took our bags down and then kindly popped them into our Uber.

I honestly can not recommend this hotel enough, and it is the perfect place to stay to receive the best service, and to stay in the most quirky and outgoing hotel. Not to mention it being so close to Oxford Street. It really was such a treat and thank you to everyone for making it feel so special.",5,2019,11,17
132,Definitely not a 5 stars hotel!,"Ordered a superior room got a small room 
on the 1st floor.
The closet is in the shower area so clothes gets wet( steamed...)
Tv didn’t work also the light was defected, room is noisy you can hear the bar music  and the people at the bar.
No communication between the reception attendees. 
Hotel has the potential but it is way way 
back from being 5 stars hotel or  any good hotel to have fun at
Location is good but if you use the tube it is not the right hotel for you 7 min far.
Not much room at the bar, bartenders not so professional 
For that price you better use any other hotel @ the soho area
Sorry the London edition hotel was fully booked
",2,2019,11,15
132,Average 4 stars hotel,"Service is terrible. Took me 20 minutes to check in only to find the room is not ready although it was 2pm. So they downgraded me to a room with no light, no view and the tv also did not work. Definitely not a 5 stars and doesn't worth the money",3,2019,11,14
132,Mad Hatters Afternoon Tea,"This was simply awesome, even for those who know nothing about the theme like myself. Lots of quirky little cakes and sandwiches to go with a great scone. The cost is much higher than your average afternoon tea but it is worth every penny. There is so much to eat and it was all delicious. You can tell the mark of a good chef / kitchen by the way they handle a Gluten Free request. My girlfriend had the GF option and where there would usually be major difference between our cakes and sandwiches, there wasn't a single difference here and they all tasted as spectacular as my 'normal' afternoon tea. Well done to the chef and also a big well done to our waitress who was super attentive and so helpful.",5,2019,11,14
132,Memorable 21st Birthday,"My partner booked The Sanderson hotel for 1 night for my 21st birthday. I have never been to the hotel before and it was a surprise. I was amazed by the lobby, the decor of the hotel is spectacularly unique. The elevator is incredibly cool, it is like being in outer space! 

My partner informed the hotel upon booking that it was my birthday, and they kindly upgraded the room. The hotel had put a birthday message written in chocolate on the table, along with a complimentary bottle of Vueve Cliquot, which was really special, many thanks for this! The room was very large. It had almost a glass box as the bathroom which I thought was amazing, it had curtains controlled by a button for privacy, a large bathtub and separate shower. 

The bed was comfy and the room was very comfortable overall. 

I couldn’t fault the service at the hotel. The doormen were attentive and polite.The reception staff really are a credit to the hotel, everyone we met was smiley and super helpful, it really felt like nothing was an ask for them. They happily helped with our bags, offered to book us a cab, and gave us bottled water upon leaving.

Overall this hotel was perfect! Especially for a short city stay. The location is great, it’s a very short walk to Oxford Street, and only a 10 minute drive to the restaurants of Mayfair. I highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying again!

Thank you so much to the team a The Sanderson for making my 21st one to remember!

Mr Shipp & Mr Jefferson

132,ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE - all thanks to Rebecca!,"I arrived after a longer than neccessary journey on a Thursday evening, to be greeted by a beautifully smiley young lady named Rebecca.  She made the whole check in procedure quick and easy, she was so welcoming, professional, engaging and was such a pleasure to deal with.  She asked if I'd stayed before (I hadn't, but explained I had considered it). 

I'd booked a nice room, but Rebecca decided she was going to try and find me a nicer room if she could. Well she really pulled it out of the bag by upgrading me to the Penthouse!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What an absolute treat!  You only hear about things like this happening. The space is amazing and Im so so ridiculously grateful to her!
We were celebrating a birthday and my goodness, it really made it a special one! The space is incredible, its so stylish.  The rooms, bathrooms, living space....everywhere is just perfect (inc the champagne fridge) :)

Nothing was too much for the staff, I was escorted up in our private lift by a charming man that took great pride in showing me around. Im gutted I had to leave the room for a while to join the others for the birthday drinks and even more gutted I couldnt couldnt stay longer than the 1 night!  We had an absolute blast and willd defintiely be back. 

It may not be the Penthouse Im booking, but The Sanderson is now my hotel of choice so you'll be seeing me again very soon!

THANK YOU REBECCA (and everyone else) for making our stay so spectacular!",5,2019,11,11
132,awesome,"no where is quite like it, atmosphere, food , staff, experience, ..............amazing, just the best . Mad hatters afternoon tea, if you've not tried it its a must, amazing flavours, oddities and tea flavours are wonderfully tasteful  ",5,2019,11,06
132,Mad hatters afternoon tea,"Such a fun afternoon tea. So pleased we were sitting in the courtyard as I feel it may not have been as nice sitting in bar stools inside. 
Really fun. 
All the staff were so attentive. 
I had vegan which was superb! 
The only annoying thing was the pigeons going on to the empty tables . ",5,2019,11,04
132,Great Room and Excellent Location,"This is a hip and fun hotel in a great area, half a block from Oxford Street.   Front desk service was amazing with Ruth, who was the most incredibly helpful and happy person at the front desk of any hotel I’ve stayed at.  

Room is nicely appointed and a bit quirky.   Bathroom lighting, mirror and sink not all synced so a bit difficult. 

Struggled with WiFi for a second device - up to 3 are allowed but logging on the second device was accomplished only by logging off WiFi from the first one. 

Lobby has a pool table in a room off the main area and the bar area on the ground floor is hip and happening.  

Overall, great stay. ",4,2019,10,30
132,Mad Hatters Afternoon Tea ,"The hotel from the outside really doesn’t look brilliant. It looks like an old 1950’s building. We then found out by one of the waitresses that the building is listed so they can’t change anything on the outside. 
Once you step into the hotel it’s very quirky and tastefully decorated. 
There was 4 of us which went for the Mad Hatters afternoon tea. 
We were shown to our table and was greeted with a smile. 
A waiter came to over then and told us about the different types of afternoon teas. Gave us a few moments to decide which we wanted and then proceeded to order it. 
About 10 mins later our teas were served and then they proceeded to serve us our cakes and sandwiches. 
The whole presentation was lovely all in the theme of Alice in Wonderland. 
All the food tasted lovely. 
One of my group was gluten free and accommodated brilliantly. Was served on a separate stand. 

Overall, the service and whole experience was fabulous. A lovely treat for any occasion. 

I would recommend this tea. ",5,2019,10,28
132,"Fun, luxury stylish Hotel","This hotel has the perfect balance of luxury and modern. (Lets just stay I got a lot of pictures for the Instagram). I love hotels like these because you never want to leave, their restaurant and bar had a beautiful selection of options.

My room was so spacious, loved coming back to my room to some treats, heating on and blinds rolled down for me. 

Lovely hotel with a fun ambience.",5,2019,10,23
132,Outstanding - exactly how a 5 star should be. ,"Stayed here last night and I can honestly say it will go down as one of the great hotel stays I’ve ever had. From the room to the service to the little personal touches. Sanderson is leagues above all other hotels and I’ve stayed in a lot of hotels. 

My wife booked this for my birthday and our wedding anniversary all rolled in to one. She dropped the hotel a very short email explaining the above and what followed was nothing short of outstanding. To say the hotel went above and beyond would be an understatement. 

It all started at check in, where we were greeted my a very naturally friendly guy. Who told us we’d been given a complimentary room upgrade. Lovely gesture and not one you’d expect from a hotel in central London. 

The room was fantastic - great size, huge bed and huge bathroom separated from the bedroom by a glass wall. Seriously impressive room. 
We wanted to chill out for the day, so ordered room service which was of a very high standard. Their club sandwich is one of the very best I’ve eaten. 
A hour or so later there was a knock on the door and we were presented with a lovely bottle of white wine and a congratulations cake accompanied by a very thoughtful hand written card. I’m still smiling and what a lovely touch that was. 

We went for cocktails in the long bar and the cocktails were of a very high standard. Then we went out to meet friends for dinner. Upon our return, the bed had been covered in rose petals and single white rose was placed in the centre of the bed. Bravo Sanderson, it really is the little touches like these that make a hotel stay stand out from others. 

The staff at every avenue were friendly and professional without the usual pretentiousness you get in most London hotels

We honestly can’t wait to return, as my 4 year would love the star scattered lifts that take you to your room. 

Thank you Sanderson.  ",5,2019,10,20
132,Great decor,"We really liked the fact that this hotel is stylish and quirky and the room felt very different from a standard hotel room. Comfortable bed and bedding, great shower and dressing area.
We stayed in the bar for a few drinks which was fun and cocktails delicious however there was a lot of illicit activity going on. This didn’t really bother us but I was surprised that security seemed oblivious . I didn’t get a good night’s sleep because there were noisy comings and goings until 5.30am. 
I wouldn’t choose to stay here again as I value my sleep but if you’re out partying until late it’s great",3,2019,09,29
132,Cool hotel in Soho,The hotel had a distinctly modern vibe - quirky and cool at the same time.  We were immediately impressed with the food in the hotel restaurant as we arrived on a late flight to London and decided it was most convenient to eat in the hotel.  The meal was outstanding - on par with a high caliber stand alone restaurant. The room was quiet and neatly appointed and the bed was very comfortable.,4,2019,09,03
132,Perfect!!,Excellent staff who service your every need and always willing to help. Rooms where always keep clean and serviced twice a day and food was excellent not to mention the best bar in London to kick back and unwind.,5,2019,09,03
132,Fit for Queens,"Had a girls night at Sandersom and could not have had a better time. 

Super handy location, airy spacious rooms and amazing service. Ruth at check in, Emily at check out and Arron, Frederico, Abi & Julian in the restaurant.

Left feeling incredibly spoiled. Will be back!",5,2019,08,25
132,What an amazing stay!,"Honestly the hotel is so beautiful, the decor inside is very cool and kitsch. Our room was immaculate, modern and comfortable. The ladies at reception, Ruth and Emily, were absolute sweethearts and so helpful. Drinks in the Long Bar were great (would recommend a Love and Rockets cocktail) with great service. Our dinner was delicious too and our waiter Frederico was charming and made sure we had everything we needed. A huge thanks to all the staff who made our stay so great.",5,2019,08,25
132,11 Night stay at the lovely Sanderson,"This is not my first stay at the Sanderson hotel, I have frequently in the past stayed at the Sanderson solely due to its customer service and friendly staff. 

I encountered a situation, where I decided that I would like to extend my stay in the Sanderson for two days.

I spoke to reception,  and they conveniently assured me there shouldn’t be complications with the extension.

During my stay, as I tried to go to my room, the elevator did not accept the card therefore I went to the reception to understand what’s going on. They informed me that the stay was not extended on the system. After a minor complication regarding the agreed upon rate I waited for the manager.

When the manager arrived (Nigel Gardiner), he was very helpful with the situation and handled it with utmost professionalism. Not only did he offer me the same rates I was promised by the reception (the receptionist), but was very informative on the previous complication.

I am taking the time to explain this because I feel the comfort of customers is the most important value for the Sanderson hotel, and during our stay it was reflected on behalf of the staff.

Hence, I would like to thank Nigel for his help, and would like to thank Ruth for her hospitality and kindness, for my current, and previous stays at the hotel.

I would also like to extend my thanks to Giovanni from the concierge. He repeatedly provided us with amazing information and complete hospitality.",5,2019,08,17
132,Artsy & Futuristic Stay,"The Sanderson Hotel is modern and seems more like a museum at times. My room was spacious and comfortable, however quite lacking on the color palette, as I felt the futuristic vibes. I suppose it couldn't have been more appropriate, as I was reading Issac Asimov's, ""Robot Dreams"", upon my arrival. 

The staff is helpful and room service was good. I was there for a week and utilized the laundry/dry cleaning services and it was spectacular. The clothes are returned as if they were a gift and smell fantastic. I have no complaints for my stay!",4,2019,08,08
132,The search is over...,"I find myself if London every year, and variety of hotels, in an attempt to find my London home-away-from-home. 

It can obviously be exciting to try new places each visit, but I have reached the point of just needing somewhere that ticks all the boxes. Somewhere that feels familiar, and somewhere that will not disappoint. I think this is it. 

The hotel may lack curb appeal, but step into the lobby and you find yourself in a fun and creative world. The staff were professional, friendly, welcoming, all in just the right balance. It felt genuine. 

As usual, my only moderate budget allowed for a pretty standard room. But even that was very spacious and airy. The bathroom area and bedroom divided by a glass wall, and tasteful window coverings should you want some privacy if you are sharing a room. A separate WC and shower made up my room, and all around great mood lighting allowed for a very cozy atmosphere after a long day of meetings. There is very creative storage space should you have a longer stay as I. 

The bed was large and spacious the linens crisp and in good shape. The pillows, just how I like them. 

The location of the hotel is a short walk from Oxford Circus, so very central if that is what you are looking for. 

I didn't get to experience the bar or restaurant in the hotel this visit, but will next time. It all looked very tempting... 

So yes, I really enjoyed my stay. I was very impressed. 

I could've been even more impressed..  A couple of things came up that dropped my review from A+ to A-. These rooms were very complete, but it would've been great to have an iron/ironing board. I realise not really a common thing in the UK, but would be so extremely practical. 

My other little comment is regarding the doormen... although generally great, a couple of occasions I returned later in the evening, only to be greeted by ""Are youu staying here?"". One night I really felt needed to show the door key, which was made more awkward as i couldn't immediately find it in my bag. I realise they want to monitor who is entering in the evening, and appreciate that.. it was just the manner/tone used. 

Regardless, as said, a great stay, and I will be back next London visit. 

Safe travels.

132,Because normal is boring.,"The Sanderson Hotel is my go-to for working out of London. 
My most recent visit explains why I will not even consider staying somewhere else. 
I took a red-eye from the US arriving at the hotel around 8am in the morning. (My company booked me into the room the night before so that I'd have a place to lie my head for a few hours before my meetings.) The hotel (via the amazingly detailed and considerate Isabel) had checked in with me a few days before to fully understand what I might need upon my arrival and for my stay.
I simply relayed that I was starting out in a new role and hoped to get some rest upon landing.  
Even though it was the morning hours and housekeeping had already started making the rounds, my room was prepared for the night. They had turndown service pass through so the shades were already drawn and the bed prepared for a brief nap. Given they had availability, they kindly upgraded me to a beautiful, superior room. They also sent up some fresh fruit, water and a note, wishing me luck in my new role. (It's the little things that they perfect!) 
I stayed there just shy of two weeks. 
The fitness facility is great (has free-weights and a bench along with some machines). While they do have cardio equipment too, I prefer cycling classes and fortunately a SoulCycle just opened up about 3 blocks away (a 5 minute walk).  
The staff is incredibly kind and accommodating. 
Security is also very tight in the evenings, which I find comforting and appreciate, given this is a trendy Soho hangout too. 
I essentially live off of room service and while I would appreciate a bit more dining options, the food offerings are quality and enjoyable. 
Any needed items arrive promptly and communication amongst the staff is 5-star (I asked the first night if they could leave the iron and board in the room. It stayed there tucked into a corner for the remainder of my stay. In other hotels I've had that message get lost and hence had to request the iron and ironing board daily.) 
The aesthetics are a bit wacky but that's what makes it fun... far from normal!
If I could make one change it would be the creation of a loyalty program, but that's only so I could have more stays at the Sanderson. 
My next trip is already booked... two weeks from now I'll be back in my home away from home.",5,2019,07,29
132,Great First Experience For Afternoon Tea,"Came here for a Mad Hatter's Afternoon Tea with my partner and it was such a lovely experience.

The tea was delicious and there was a good variety to choose from.  

The nibbles were honestly out of this world.  They looked magical.  I was concerned that it couldn't possibly fill me up but it did and I was stuffed by the end of it.  There was a lot of variety of nibbles as well.  

The staff were lovely and extremely friendly.  Even explaining to me the concept of afternoon tea (this was my first time coming to afternoon tea).  

Yes it is expensive (I think i twas £45 a head) but it was totally worth it.  

I gotta say I was very happy with this experience and I would come here again.",5,2019,07,29
132,not a high end hotel,"We arrived from a flight at noon, ordered 2 Deluxe rooms for a lot of money. When arrived in the room we discovered there is a party with very loud music (very loud!), right outside the room. Impossible to stay in the room or rest. The party was in the hotel lobby (and not for gusts of the hotel…). Deep bases and very loud.
Regarding the noise - being in the room was like being in the party which suggested there is no sound protection (to expensive?). We could not sleep or rest after the flight, and the party took place for hours.
The hotel did not find a replacement and destroyed my first day in London.
The people who gave service were nice and polite but the bottom line I am feeling cheated.
As I see it - Sanderson only pretending to be a high end hotel.
We come to London frequently and there are a lot of very good hotel here – I will go to another hotel next time I am in London.

132,Reliable Hotel But Quirky ,"I alternate between the Sanderson and The London Edition on my stays in London. What I like about the Sanderson is that it is always fail proof. Super clean rooms, convenient, and no fuss. However, there are quirks. For one, it does not have the best sound proofing, which makes it a tad annoying on the weekends when it is somewhat of a party scene. The design of the rooms are meant to be intentionally off center - bed is placed crookedly in a perfectly square room. Bathroom vanity is also placed crookedly from a perfectly rectangular room. If you are a Type-A person, like me, this may just drive you a bit crazy. Nevertheless, service is always top notch so I will continue to stay here for future business trips.",5,2019,06,30
132,Enjoyable Stay,"Staff all very friendly, polite and helpful. We stayed for a birthday celebration and returned to our room with a small cake and Happy Birthday message which was a lovely touch! 

The hotel itself is a little worn in places with lights missing and the main toilets not in-keeping with the rest of the hotel. Probably the nosiest hotel I've stayed in though with bedroom doors banging continuously and people talking loudly as they walked past (on a Sunday night) but we did have a nice stay and the location is excellent.",4,2019,06,25
132,Excellent Family Friendly Stay,Spent 3 nights at hotel with 3 year old grandson and other family members. Staff were enormously helpful and highly professional.  Little grandson made a fuss of and was lucky recipient of a teddy bear in his cot plus a dinosaur.  Hotel suite very comfortable and well appointed.  Food contemporary and delicious. ,5,2019,06,21
132,Rude staff and bad service,"We had a birthday reservation and because of a system failure the reservation did not show up. Instead of apologising they decided to become argumentative... AVOID, save yourself the same agony we went through.",1,2019,06,16
132,"Excellent hotel, design experience and staff very customer friendly","Like nothing else, not to modern not to old school, mix of the best of two worlds! Dont forget to enjoy the bar at entrancefloor and make sure to enjoy the outside terrace. The rooms are very clean and spacious bathrooms!",5,2019,06,07
132,Another amazing stay at Sanderson!,"We have just spent another amazing weekend at Sanderson! Having stayed several times now we were made to feel so welcome on our return. We were treated to a fabulous room upgrade, a lovely welcome back card from Tanya and the team, and a surprise bowl of delicious fruit which was delivered to our room. We had dinner in the beautiful courtyard which currently looks amazing with the all the butterflies, parrots and exotic flowers!  We had a selection of tapas from the Long Bar menu accompanied by a couple of bottles of champagne which went down very nicely!  Breakfast, as always, was impeccable, as was the service. The billiard room is absolutely stunning and a few frames was a great way to round off an amazing evening at the hotel. The location of the hotel is brilliant for a spot of shopping on Oxford Street and Bond Street but is tucked away on quiet Berners St, a real oasis away from the crowds and hustle bustle. My husband and I absolutely adore this hotel and the staff and now we are home we can't wait to book our next stay.",5,2019,05,27
132,Terrible service ,"We stayed (not for the first time) in the Sanderson - but there won’t be another time.. the service does not stand up to a 5 star expensive London  hotel. At the last night of our stay, we got stuck in the hotel elevator. It can happen, but what can’t happen is we rang the emergency button for 10 mins. No one from the hotel staff noticed or bothered to check what’s going on. Eventually, one of the hotel guests noticed and notified the hotel staff. The reaction was interesting- noting al all... once the guest checked what’s going on, she was told ‘it’s being handled, we r not sure how the lifts work, etc etc’ while we r still stuck inside. No one spoke to us or tried to communicate with us. After 20-25 mins the doors finally opened. The hotel reaction? ‘Oh sorry, the manager wasn’t  in place, we didn’t hear didn’t know bla bla bla here is some crap champagne (which we didn’t want or take) as compensation’ no sense of responsibility or service. One can only imagine if an elderly person would be stuck in the dark what could happen. There were others small events throughout the stay but we think it’s fair to say the Sanderson needs some serious looking into service wise",2,2019,05,23
132,Great hotel,"The location for this hotel is here of westend and walking distance from many places in London 
They have really great service from they open the door for you to check in where the mood is high.
I love the rooms, very modern a bit Scandinavian style.
It’s a cool style hotel and it shines through everything.
You can always find a good offer for a room on some of the portals
I come here a lot
They have a great bar and a garden for a dinner",5,2019,05,23
132,Amazing ,I booked this hotel for one night because of a flight layover home. It was amazing! Staff were so amazing and helpful! The room was perfect and I wished I had a chance to stay longer. The location is perfect for a short walk to Oxford street shopping. I can't wait to return to London and the Sanderson!,5,2019,05,19
132,Sanderson,"I went there in March and to this day and probably my life will be the nicest hotel I've stayed in. If your from the U.S. like me try the breakfast tea, it's nothing like we have here and it's so good I bought some to bring back!",5,2019,05,19
132,Nice hotel at the center of everything,"I stayed here for 2 days when I came to Facebook for a business meet. Loved the check-in process, quality of the room and above all the location. It's kind of odd that the rooms at the first floor were hard to find since it's behind a board room. Pathway was kind of dark. Rooms were great, very comfortable and walkable to all major attractions. Please improve the quality of food. Omlette was not done well, pasta was hard!",4,2019,05,18
132,Escape to London for May bank weekend,"What a beautiful hotel. Clean, spacious rooms. Lovely staff - friendly, accommodating. I love that I never had to open the front door.  Central location. Close to Oxford Street, West End Soho, China Town. Highly recommended!",5,2019,05,08
132,"Nice hotel in nice neighborhood, but mediocre hospitality and stolen jewelry","Stayed here for a work trip, and while the hotel is very nice and clean, I did not receive the warmest welcome from reception upon arrival.  I was very sick and had just taken a redeye flight in, but reception was cold, unwelcoming, and unhelpful as a newcomer to the city and hotel.  On top of that, one of my necklaces was stolen from the bathroom which I discovered as I was checking out.  Nothing was done about it, and waiting to hear back from the hotel.  Likely won't stay here again.",3,2019,04,15
132,My new favourite ‘go to’ hotel!!,"My husband arranged a night at The Sanderson with dinner for my birthday as a surprise. Well, what can I say-amazing! Fabulous clientele service, every attention to detail was covered. You have to understand this wasn’t a special birthday-just a normal celebration. 
On arrival we were checked and straight away was informed that our room had been upgraded because it was a special stay. Then we were given two complimentary cocktail vouchers for the bar. The room we were given was extremely spacious, immaculately clean, ultra modern, beautiful fully equipped en-suite including his and hers Gillette razors. After being in our room for about an hour there was a knock at the door, a member of staff had delivered a fabulous bottle of orange label Verve Cliquot champagne and a happy birthday cake! 
Cocktails were fabulous at the bar, we tried many! Great atmosphere in the long bar with a female dj playing 80’s music whilst we drank. Bar was busy, very happy place to spend a few hours-bar staff could not be faulted. They all had brilliant customer relations. 
Later in the evening, on retiring to our room we were greeted with cream petals scattered on the bed along with a beautiful rose, fresh towels in the bathroom and mood lighting to create the perfect ambience. 

Can not fault this hotel, will recommend to anyone wanting to stay in London and will be returning here on a regular basis. Thank you Sanderson for making my birthday visit perfect xxx",5,2019,04,13

132,Fourth consecutive year staying at the Sanderson - already planning the fifth!,"This was the fourth year our family has gathered at the Sanderson for a pre-Christmas treat and, as ever, it was fabulous. The location is perfect - whether you are shopping, sightseeing or going to the theatre, almost everything is on your doorstep and anything else is just a short cab ride away. The staff are so friendly and kind and helpful - from the doormen to the front desk to the concierge to the restaurant / bar staff. And the rooms are spotless so even though we never saw the cleaning staff, we know their work is 5-stars. Love the bedrooms, love the bathrooms, love the amazing spa and love the overall design and feel of the hotel - really stylish, really fun and really luxurious. The breakfast is superb and room service is excellent too. As always, we booked the Mad Hatter's Tea Party for the kids and they loved it! Already looking forward to this year's visit, wouldn't stay anywhere else.",5,2019,04,09
132,Home away from home,"This is our 5th stay at Sanderson in a year. Why do we keep coming back? I could give a hundred reasons from the rooms to the location (just off Oxford Street and within walking distance of SoHo and Leicester Square). The main reason we have returned is because we are coming home to family - from Ruth on the front desk who always ensures that we are well taken care of; to Phil and CJ on the front door who make us feel welcome as soon as they see us; to Gaby who saw us walking in the door this time and waved as if he saw long lost friends; to Ivo who always checks to see if we need anything in the restaurant or from room service; to Marta who shared sweets with us from her native Poland at Christmas time.

We have found another family here which will always keep us coming back! ",5,2019,04,08
132,Friends supper ,Good service and friendly staff and kept topping up the tap water in our glasses. Limited set menu but filling courses. Enjoyed the evening. Wine reasonable but coffee over priced and cappuccino a bit cold. Toilets were quite far away and quite fluorescent green and not five star. ,4,2019,04,05
132,Great hotel.,Fantastic hotel. Great staff. Great service. Fabulous decor. Awesome vibe. Probably my favourite hotel in London. I will definitely be staying here again. The location is also pretty good and close to a couple of tube stations.,5,2019,03,28
132,A few drinks ,"Tuned up on Saturday evening, had a warm welcome by the door staff and bar staff . Lovely atmosphere with couples and groups of friendly people. The staff made us feel very looked after. Had a DJ playing nice vibes . Definitely will be back ! ",5,2019,03,12
132,"Wonderful Service, Great Location, Beautiful and Hip Hotel","I stayed at this hotel twice during my 3 week stay in Europe. The first time was for one night in London, and the next time was for two nights in London. Both times, I had a phenomenal experience. The customer service from all of the staff was superb. They all greeted you with a smile and a high level of energy whether it was in the morning or in the evening. The front desk staff, the concierge, the doormen, and the bartenders were all very kind my entire stay. They all were also very accommodating and helpful. They brought five star service but still remained down-to-earth, human, and not to uptight, which made it comfortable to talk to them and ask for assistance. Their service was not only high-level, but genuine and friendly.

The hotel was very nice and had a real trendy vibe to it which seemed to match the pace of SOHO. The rooms had a very fun and stylish vibe with the colors, cool sheer and gold curtains that separated the bathroom from the room, and contemporary lighting that you could control throughout the room. I only wish there was a rack in the shower to hang the shower gel and loofa so I did not have to grab them from the bathroom sink while in the shower, but this was one small inconvenience that did not ruin my experience at all. The bed was very comfortable and my room was cleaned very well when I was out of the room.

The location was very convenient for my stay because I was able to walk to almost all of the major attractions that I wanted to visit during my short stay. Whenever I needed to take a taxi, it was an easily identifiable hotel to almost every driver I had making it an easy location to get to and from. I also had an easy walk to see Les Miserables at the Queens Theatre which is only right down the road from the hotel! I have to also point out, that there are sooo many good restaurants near the hotel as well! So convenient! That area at night is live and a lot of people are out having fun.

This is definitely a great hotel for a younger crowd, looking for the trendy vibe, and the opportunity to have fun while also still receiving great service!",5,2019,03,11
132,Amazing Service,"From the minute we walked up to this place on a sunny Saturday morning, both my partner and I were amazed by the service we received. Every staff member we saw had a beaming smile on their face, asked about our day and our plans, and just set the tone for what is a relatively hip and chic central hotel. They have done very well to create this feel, despite being rather large. Within the first 3 minutes I would have recommended this place, before even seeing the room.

Our room was the deluxe, largest of the rooms before they turn into suites. It was a comfortable room, things such as sink, bath, bed all at odd angles which we quite liked. Beautifully clean, bed was comfy. We were only here for a night but given the service we had, oh yes, and early check, would certainly return on our next trip to London. Really well located for the tubes if you need therm, if not, you can find everything you could imagine within a short walk. We had a few drinks here in the evening which were nice, enjoyed the 3D purple lifts and my partner loved the Ciel bathroom products.

Would highly recommend.",5,2019,02,26
132,best choice we made,stayed for 5 days in this beautiful hotel. was a great choice made by my wife i have to say as we are not so familiar which what is good or not. This place is full of good service and luxury stay. i hope to stay here again.,5,2019,02,23
132,Best London stay,"I stayed for my partners birthday and we was surprised with a bottle of champagne, rose petals and desserts. Beautiful room and great staff.

Cannot wait to stay there again! 

Very clean room, friendly security guards and staff in both the check in and purple bar. 

No complaints.",5,2019,02,23
132,Fancy afternoon tea,My family and I had a delightful afternoon tea there. It’s totally 8 of us walked in receiving a thoughtful service in the Friday afternoon. The food was good and the environment was enjoyable. It’s nice!,4,2019,02,22
132,Still out favourite place to stay in town,"We have been coming here for years when in London for a dinner or show, or meeting up with friends. The location is so perfect for us, central and we were eating at the Berners Tavern so literally had to walk a few yards. From arrival the stay were friendly, helpful and new straight away is was my partners birthday so told us we had been upgraded, which is not the first time they have done this for us even without a birthday. The porter showed us the new bar, told us some things and showed us to our room and exited without even a look up for a tip so we gave it to him when we made our way back downstairs. In the afternoon a knock at our door and a bottle of champagne and some truffles from the front desk really was a wonderful gesture, it really capped off a midweek stay where we were made to feel so special.",5,2019,02,20
132,Sanderson London,"Bad experience
House-keepers stole my jewellery necklase from my bag.   I had informed the front desk but Unfortunately, No follow up from the hotel although they said that they will investigate about it. 
I have been in many many hotels but it is the first time i experience theft from house keepers!!!",1,2019,02,17
132,Mad Hatters Tea Party,"We had a great afternoon at the hotel although one of our party, the birthday girl, was ill with a virus the hotel went out of there way to make her feel comfortable even letting her lay down in one of there unoccupied rooms.
A big shout out to Igor who arranged everything to make sure she was comfortable even arranging for a bellboy to go to the local chemist to get some medicine.
The tea itself was excellent with a selection of speciality to go with the sandwiches and cakes. ",5,2019,02,15
132,Awesome!!,"Walked down from my hotel twice to have a drink at Sanderson. The first time in the front which was filled with workers and had a glass or two of red wine. 

The second time was in the bar bar, hidden away but a real gem. It’s apparently about to be refurbished but we loved it. Went on the Saturday night of 10th Feb & had a gorgeous polish girl look after us. Her customer service was outstanding - as was her cocktail making. We came for 1 drink and ended up staying because of her hospitality! ",5,2019,02,14
132,Great food,"From the outside The Sanderson hotel is very deceptive, what's on the outside isn't on the inside! Inside is lovely, bright modern a great drinks and dinner venue. We had three course meal, crab, wild mushroom knocci and vanilla arctic roll, all delicious and beautifully presented, with a cocktail. Our waitress Manon was superb, service with a smile.  Afternoon tea is also served, an atrium area is available with heaters too. Toilets upstairs tasteful and clean. Would recommend, 5mins from Oxford circus tube. ",5,2019,02,13
132,Tipsy Tea,My husband went here for their Tipsy Tea for our Honeymoon. He told them the occasion and when we arrived they had a cute dessert for us and a glass of bubbly. The Tipsy Tea is specialty cocktails with all the normal afternoon tea foods. We highly recommend. The staff was great!,5,2019,02,06
132,Perfect afternoon tea,"Had a lovely mad hatters afternoon tea today. Excellent food, great staff and great atmosphere. Some nice little touches that go along with the Alice in wonderland theme. One of the best afternoon teas I’ve had.",5,2019,01,31
132,Beautiful afternoon tea,"Have visited here several times and love it. This recent visit was a special 13th birthday treat for our goddaughter - the mad hatters afternoon tea. This was her first visit here and she absolutely loved it. The staff are always very friendly, polite and courteous and very attentive.",5,2019,01,30
132,Tipsy Tea acceded my expectations!,"I entered the Sanderson with high expectations due to the fact that it is a five star hotel which is highly ranked in London. The main entrance is simply stunning. The ambiance, the creative furniture, the little details of several outlets are impressive to look at. All staff members welcomed us warmly and started to talk about our day. (Very attentive) - liked it !
After we had some time to have a walk around the hotel, we sit down in the restaurant were the staff members warmly welcomed us and explained that out Tipsy Tea will start soon. First, we were served with beautiful decorated cocktails which were explained to us as well.
Afterwards, the plate with different biscuits, sandwiches and pralines were served to us and detailed explained.
We truly enjoyed our experience with the Sanderson and will visit you hopefully again!",5,2019,01,22
132,BEST VIRGIN PINA COLADA Lovely,"This venue is lovely with plenty of places to take pictures and strike a pose and it has a great bar. You have to try the virgin pina colada, it actually is the BEST in London. But from the bar, as the bartender makes an effort when you watch him!! There’s a lunch or afternoon tea option during the day and you can sit in the garden if you’re having tea which is lovely. Staff are polite and it’s a stone’s throw from Oxford Street so a good place to eat after shopping. Try and book a set meal beforehand though as it’s expensive otherwise.",4,2019,01,20
132,The best hotel I've EVER stayed in!,"So I’m picky… 
I KNOW I’m picky but The Sanderson has met every single expectation and exceeded what was being asked of them.

From before check-in with special requests, Celia at the front desk was super responsive and accommodating.
At check-in, Paris had a big smile and fresh fruit waiting which was amazing given my jetlag.
Phil made sure I got to my room safe, understood where all the light switches/shade switches were, and helped me find everything I needed within a block of the hotel.

Room-service was impeccable. The food quality, timeliness, and cost were all spot-on.
Location of the hotel is beyond perfect. I walked everywhere I needed to in London whether it was work, shopping, or seeing the sights.

And the room – ohhhh the beautiful room. I want to pick it up and move it back to the United States with me.

If you’re hesitating at ALL to book at the Sanderson, give your head a shake, and book now!

You can thank me later! 😊",5,2019,01,17
132,Christmas in London,"We stayed for a week during the Christmas period and vastly enjoyed our stay at the Sanderson. Best concierge in town is Andres, every request was met in a short time and he doesn’t take no or fully booked for an answer. Breakfast was good but the best thing was Gabi who served us every time we had breakfast at the hotel, a very hospitable a friendly host. The rooms were spacious and well designed. We had the Mad Hatters afternoon tea on Christmas Day and it was a blast. Would certainly stay there again",5,2019,01,15
132,"Paris & CJ have set the bar for other hotels, shangri la put us on hold on the phone for 20minutes lucky we did not book","we thought we'd do something different and go with Sanderson, we were not disappointed, we are great fans of warm surroundings and great people and again this is exactky what we found, Paris welcomed us in with a great smile and a comp upgrade & CJ just put the icing on the cake with his uplifting  personality & amazing hospitality skills , we always repeatedly compliment on how important social skills and hospitality is. we feel this is the make or break with any interaction ANY WHERE. hotel nice and clean room was great , Paris hope your checking us in next time. CJ your the BEST thankyou my man",5,2019,01,12
132,"Great location, very nice room","The hotel is in a great location, walking distance from the Soho, theater, and shopping area. There is a need to some revival of the facilities and the bar but in general a really great team of people and a very welcoming and interesting hotel. we enjoyed it",4,2019,01,12
132,Afternoon Tea,"We had the Alice in Wonderland inspired afternoon tea which was great, the fruity tea mixes where nice alongside the afternoon tea. 

Two of the savoury options have fish which we asked to be replaced and they added off the menu veggie choices rather than giving you more of the same.

Our waitress was polite, helpful and attentive. We sat in the outside garden in the marque and there was lots of heaters and blankets. 

We arrived 30 minutes early and there were lots of free tables so we asked if we could sit early but the lady was quite rude and adamant we could not sit till our allotted time. We asked about the free tables and they apparently all had people booked to arrive before our sitting so we had a cocktail at the bar then magically one of the many empty tables was available. You have to wonder if this is a ploy to get you to buy a £14 cocktail.

If it was not for this ladies rudeness would of given a five. ",4,2019,01,05
132,Couldn’t be better!,"My preferred hotel in London ! 

A refreshing and peaceful place just in the middle of vibrating London. Everything is smooth and you feel like in a cocoon.

We went there for my birthday (and Christmas) with my partner and our mothers (so called “the golden girls”). 

As a returning customer, we had a warm welcome by Paris B. who made our stay unforgettable! She is definitely the best!

Everything was perfect mainly due to the staff (the hotel is still cool and trendy but can’t hide is age and would need some kind of soft refurbishment even if  Starck manage to create a timeless boutique hotel).

The double double loft and the loft room were astonishing and worth every penny !

Marvellous breakfast and great restaurant. We didn’t had the time to use the spa (closed on Christmas), but if you come here, it’s clearly a must do !",5,2019,01,02
132,Contemporary style,"The Sanderson is always fun to visit although I do find the rooms a little too contemporary - personally I like a private bathroom and not just a glass door between this and the bed ! 
However great for drinks, whether work or private with friends - the Purple Bar is fun with some great cocktails and the long bar is great for meet ups!",4,2019,01,01
132,Boxing Day Lunch,"Visited the Sanderson for the first time today for lunch with friends, family and two small children and our entire experience was faultless. Impeccable service from friendly and professional staff, delicious food and lovely touches such as noticing one of our group dealing with his baby and taking his food to keep it warm.

We all found the food to be stunning, the atmosphere was relaxed and a wonderful afternoon was had by all.

This restaurant is a credit to the city and will be the first reservation I make on my next trip to London.",5,2018,12,26
132,Great hotel lovely staff,"Spent one night here, on check in they. Upgraded my room to super deluxe .  Hotel is clean and room was amazing. Breakfast was lovely and loads of choice, staff were friendly and helpful. I will definitely return",5,2018,12,24
132,Amazing Hotel!!,"Positioned 3 minutes walk of Oxford St and 5 minutes walk of 2 different underground stations (Tottenham Court and Oxford Circus), 2 minutes walk of a Sainsbury's banch, major restaurants and shops, Sanderson Hotel is the perfect place to stay when visiting London. From the moment you walked into the hotel and are welcome with the lips shape sofa, you understand you arrived to a special and unique establishment. It has a design that you won't see elsewhere. The food is so tasty.
They clean up the room twice a day. Very service oriented and always with a smile.
Money very well spent!",5,2018,12,20

The hotel staff were extremely friendly, welcoming, helpful and accommodating and made the experience more pleasant.

The room was spacious, modern and well presented with everything one would need during a stay.",5,2018,12,18
132,Fantastic Top Hotel,"Positioned just off Oxford St, within walking distance to the West End theatres, major restaurants and public transport, Sanderson Hotel is the perfect place to stay when visiting London.

From the moment we walked through the door we were greeted with the warmest of welcomes and settled into our suite swiftly.  Whilst the hotel may be a little old, it still has a great vibe which is completely controlled through the design, music and staff attitude.  

Our room was very comfortable, clean and bright and room service was prompt and delicious.  

Sanderson boasts a fantastic gym and spa area which we took advantage of.  For those who travel and like a fully equiped gym, Sanderson delivers!  The bars and restaurant downstairs are also world class.  

Loved our stay here!",5,2018,12,17
132,Fabulous weekend,"We stayed at The Sanderson on a recent visit to London. We arrived early so handed our bags in at reception and headed straight to the long bar for a couple of cocktails. There was only 1 member of staff behind the bar and as we sat down a Christmas party arrived, despite this everyone was served quickly and the barman still found time to speak to us. We stayed in a deluxe room which was beautiful and the midday checkout time meant we could take full advantage of this and enjoyed a room service breakfast.  The food and drinks that we had were delicious. All of the staff were friendly and welcoming. Would definatley recommend this hotel for a special break. ",5,2018,12,17
132,Top hotel,"A little quirky in parts adds to the charm of this london hotel who’s location means you can walk to the main shopping areas of oxford st.,regent st.

132,Two day stay,"We have stayed previously at Sanderson over the last ten years on several occasions and every stay has been a pleasure the consistency of service has always been of the highest standard from the location for the West end theatre ,restaurants,retail therapy  shopping and clubs all at a reasonable price structure offers quality of service and user friendliness is most welcome.
The staff make you feel at home when you walk into the reception to the time you checkout.",5,2018,11,18
132,Cool little hip hotel in Soho area in central London,"I travel to London frequently. this has been a staple of mine. It has a cool look, but been the same for about a decade or so. havent been here in a few months. But great rooms, great lobby bar, garden bar (when its warm), restaurant and a bunch of other hidden gems. Place remembers me when i return, staff have always been great. walkable to central london stuff. theres an awesome steak house and whiskey bar within about 100m but i cant remember the name of it.",5,2018,11,16
132,"Quirky, unquie, great staff, great location just wow..","The brief was find a different hotel to our normal city type hotels for our weekend stay in London, and wow the Sanderson delievered on different. Warm friendly doorman greet you as you enter the large lobby with a hanging glass bowl seat and a lip styled settee. You then entered the lift which is like entering a visit to a space rocket exploring the stars, so to the room, large airy, glass panelled bathroom, with a sink offsite at an angle from the wall as is the bed oh and the landscape picture not on a wall but on the ceiling! Coffee machine, mini bar and bottles of water. You have to try the main bar which offers great cocktails and then move to the purple bar who's name needs no explaining. What makes this hotel though is it's staff, everyone warm, welcoming and who go out of their way to help, oh and a 2 minute walk to oxford street, well done Sanderson you have set the standard...",5,2018,11,11
132,Old and Tired,"I used to have terrific times at the Sanderson but that was a decade ago with the property now feeling tired and dated. What really shocked me is despite the age this property now feels they can charge exorbitant prices that are far above any other five star hotel in London including the white hot Edition Hotel directly opposite. 

This is the first time I've encountered a 15% service charge...that's unheard of yet for reasons lost on me seems to be considered acceptable here. What's more baffling is they couple this service charge with in-room tray fees of an additional £3.50 every time. Expect to therefore pay well over £10 for a water with ice.

Enough said and I won't be back.",1,2018,11,02
132,Good stay in London,"Very nice stay, great vibe, and service ..
Location is great, and so is the hotel's bar

Cons : 
No coffee machine in the room, and in such hotel with that kind of price it is not expected..
Spa , especially the massage , is not something ill use again, not worth the price , and for sure not the time..

Beside of that , a good stay all together ",4,2018,10,22
132,Nice hotel ,"This hotel is lovely however lots of glass in the room so in the middle of the night it can be slight disorienting. 
That’s about the only negative. The bed was so comfortable, bathroom size large and I felt very secure in this hotel as a female traveling alone. 
I would stay here for personal use as the location is excellent. ",4,2018,10,19
132,Mad Hatter Afternoon Tea,"Quirky, delicious, fun - a real treat!

An Alice in Wonderland themed Afternoon Tea ... with the drink me potions, rabbits watch, caterpillar, mushrooms and much more 

Cute menus hidden in books, and musical jewellery box hides sugar ... it really is a delight for the senses!

Reasonably priced for London",5,2018,10,14
132,Good central Hotel,"The Sanderson is in a good location for shopping & attractions 
The hotel is modern & quirky the rooms are minimalist with glass & white curtains & very clean
All staff are very friendly & attentive, they can’t do enough for you & there’s always a smile & a hello how are you
Breakfast was very good & again staff were very  helpful
The hotel serves a Mad Hatters tea party, we hadn’t booked it but it looked amazing, the children looked like they loved it!
Great cocktails at the bar, would definitely return ",5,2018,10,09
132,Unique and Wonderful ,"We booked the Sanderson as a special anniversary treat and it certainly didn’t disappoint! 
It ticked all the boxes and then some, in particular the great location and fantastic design elements throughout- the quirky lobby, the stained glass, the amazing lift, a real visual treat.
The room was perfect, scrupulously clean, decent size, felt very romantic with all the drapes curtains. 
We had drinks in both the Long Bar and the Purple bar, both of which had great but quite different atmospheres, and finally a great breakfast in the restaurant the following morning.
If I had one minor gripe it’s that the complimentary amenities don’t seem to fit with a hotel if this quality, and little touches like that do improve the perception of value for money when you’re paying a significant amount for a room.
But we had a magical weekend at the Sanderson and look forward to returning. ",5,2018,10,07
132,In my opinion it’s the best hotel in London,"I have stayed here for about ten times and I can say this is definitely one of my favourite hotels in the world and I wouldn’t think of staying anywhere else in London. Their location is excellent, right next to Oxford street, their decoration is exquisite and their personal attention couldn’t be better. They always manage you to feel at home and a princess at the same time. They have an incredible spa with the best massages, treatments and professionals that are always willing to help you. The food is just as wonderful too. From the breakfast, both in room as in the restaurant, to their famous afternoon tea. They’re great for parties too, as they have a bar with fantastic cocktails and a room with the only purple pool table you’ll ever see. The rooms are really beautiful too, the beds are the comfiest and the personal hygiene products are first quality too. I couldn’t be more pleased with the Sanderson, I can’t wait to be back! ",5,2018,10,04
132,Fab-u-lous from start to finish!,"💜💜💜 this hotel. Arrived early to check in as we were going to a matinee west end show. Room already available plus an upgrade for our anniversary. Gorgeous big room with enormous sledge bed & all mod cons. Staff were all lovely, welcoming and friendly. Had pre dinner cocktails (fab) at the long bar which was beautifully decorated. Also champagne in the garden which was very cool surrounded by pink flamingos! Hotel decor is very cool, quirky & over the top, lots of mirrors and decadent colours. It's a feast for the senses. Mad hatter afternoon tea was a huge hit as lots partaking. My favourite hotel in London. We'll defo be back.",5,2018,10,02
132,Another perfect stay!,"The Sanderson has a special place in our hearts as it is where myself and my fiancé met 7.5 years ago. We had the most wonderful overnight stay for my 30th birthday this August, it was perfect from start to finish - and we would like to say a huge thank you to Nigel Gardiner who kindly organised an upgraded room (it was heavenly - with a gorgeous free standing bath) and a bottle of champagne in the room upon arrival. He went out of his way to ensure we had the perfect stay, and it was exactly that.

The Sanderson is the most wonderful place to stay in London - is it beautifully luxurious, and the rooms are contemporary and immaculate. The bar is buzzing and lively, with delicious cocktails and impeccable service. The afternoon tea is delicious and set in a beautiful courtyard. And the breakfast.. well let's just say I would make a visit purely for the breakfast alone!

Thank you Sanderson, we had a fantastic time. It's service like this that keep customers loyal - we will be back again (and again and again!)",5,2018,09,30
132,Afternoon Tea,I took my mom for afternoon tea at the Sanderson Hotel and it was great. The staff was nice and attentive. The food was delicious and cater to different dietary restrictions. The whole experience whilst at the Sanderson was really lovely. ,5,2018,09,29
132,Amazing,"This hotel is great, funky with lovely and friendly staff and a great location. The spa is also amazing.

The hotel rooms are big and the bath is massive 

However some things I found were not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel:

* You have to request tea and coffee making facilities which I found very odd and they also don’t replace the cups, they just rinsed them in the sink and I only found this out when they didn’t rinse it properly and I went to use it and my lipstick stain was still on there!
*Housekeeping comes early morning and then also at night time - if you have the do not disturb sign on they will slip a note under your door stating that they could not refill the mini bar, I don’t understand why they couldn’t refill the mini bar in the morning (I only ever had soft drink from the mini bar).

Bit overall it was still a great experience and I would definitely be back.

I wanted to make a special mention to Gaby who went above and beyond at breakfast to make sure I had everything I needed and also remembering that I like berries and would bring me a bowl of them.  He is truly and asset to the Sanderson and the reason why I ate at the Sanderson for breakfast every day.",5,2018,09,26
132,Fantastic,Wonderful stay. We had a huge room with a big bath tub. Room service was brilliant as was the concierge service. Would definitely recommend this hotel. Thank you for the surprise left in the room to mark a special day we had there.,5,2018,09,23
132,My absolute favourite hotel!,"I totally love this hotel. 
I have stayed here 5 times and every time has been amazingly faultless. 
Rooms so spacious, massive bath (and shower if you prefer), HUGE comfortable bed. Lovely staff and security. 
Love love love! 
Stay there, you will not be disappointed.",5,2018,09,22
132,Treasured Memories,"Couldn't rate the hotel and staff highly enough. We stayed there 2 nights for our wedding and they made us feel so special, they truly went above and beyond in making our stay as comfortable as possible from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. The whole hotel is very stylish and beautiful, rooms are amazing and the beds very comfortable, but the real highlight of staying here is the staff - they really made our day that extra bit special and gave us memories that we will always treasure.",5,2018,09,20
132,Marmite. More shabby than chic.,"If you get this place, then you really get it.
We didn't.
From the outside it looks like a 1960s Soviet-era office block. Drab and underinvested.
The inside is just weird - acres and acres of flowing drapes, curtains, swags etc. everywhere covering all that nasty concrete and 60s design. For us it just doesn't work.
The place needs a serious cash injection. Look very hard (you'll need to because the lighting is so poor) and you'll see the telltale signs.
Reception staff -  very friendly.
We had two rooms on the first floor. Finding them was not easy, through two sets of doors and in the near dark. What is it with the lighting? Are your guests all so strung out or drunk they can't face normal light levels?
The rooms were OK, nothing more. A bit grey and drab.
The bathrooms are odd, separated from the bedrooom via a glass wall. Cool if that's your thing. But to get to the loo in the night you need to leave a light on - and that then spoils the sleeping experience,
The taps on the basins and shower are laughable. If you have soapy hands you simply cannot turn them off - you need to use a towel. Definitely form over function. And this was the experience of all four of us. Also, the basin is in front of the  glass partition so pity the poor housekeeping staff who must be constantly wiping away the drip marks.
Noisy a/c.
The window blinds were tatty.
No tea and coffee making facilities unless you ask for them. But curiously there's a mini vibrator available for purchase in every room. I think that says it all.
Bar downstairs was good, no complaints there.
In summary, we paid £760 for two rooms, no meals. 
For that money we could have stayed at much plusher hotels such as The Berkeley, but we thought we'd give The Sanderson a try. A decision we've come to regret.",3,2018,09,20
132,A wonderful relaxing piece of heaven! ,"I visited the spa for my first time today.  Wow! I will definitely be back! From the moment I entered the spa I was greeted with smiles and professionalism.  This place is so relaxing, the long white curtains are simply amazing! My massage was really relaxing, but also firm enough to make a difference to my aching muscles - thank you Sandy! And the aftercare made me feel like I was on holiday without a care in the world! Thank you! 
",5,2018,09,19
132,Amazing Stay!,"The exterior of the hotel does not do justice to what lies within the doors of the Sanderson.  We enjoyed the design of the lobby and the Purple Bar and the quirky features such as the lobby furniture and the interior of the elevators.  The loft suite we stayed in was wonderful.  The room was enormous and the bed was extremely comfortable.  We requested that a kettle/tea and coffee making facilities be placed in the room and this request was seen to promptly by the staff, which was appreciated.   We enjoyed the services at the Agua Spa.  They have a beautiful area with day beds that you can relax in after your treatments; it was so peaceful and tranquil that I fell asleep.  The location of the hotel is ideal - it is located on a quiet street but within short walking distance to Oxford St.
 
All the staff we came into contact with were very welcoming, friendly and helpful.  Thank you to Leo and Shawn at the Front Desk for the warm welcome; CJ and Jose who assisted with our luggage and greeted us at the door with a smile whenever we returned to the hotel; Celia (Front Office) who kindly printed out tickets for us; Marta and Dominique from the Purple Bar who created a delicious non-alcoholic cocktail; Matt and Cheryl (don't know i have her name right, but she told me she was new) from Agua Spa for the great massage treatments and Manon who patiently answered our questions in relation to dietary requirements when we had breakfast in the restaurant. There was also a lovely female attendant at the Spa whose name I have unfortunately forgotten (she has an Asian background ) who explained the different areas of the Spa and constantly checked to see if I needed anything.
 
We really enjoyed our stay and hope to return in the near future.",5,2018,09,17
132,5-star Dinner,"After visiting the Mad Hatters Afternoon Tea we visited back at the Sanderson but this time for dinner, we were dining alongside the house set menu and it was truly fantastic. The service and food were flawless. Each course was truly delightful, from the presentation to the incredible flavours it really was spectacular. The service was above our expectations and we'd love to visit back! Compliments to the chefs and the staff at Sanderson!",5,2018,09,16
132,Nice Hotel,I stay here often when I am in London for business. I find the hotel nice compared to most dingy London hotels but it is on the expensive side and sometimes the cost does not equal the value (room service and breakfast cooking is not 5*). Otherwise nice staff overall and very comfortable. The bedrooms are bright and designed nicely.,4,2018,09,15
132,"Nice, good location, and a bit overdesigned","Overall, quite a nice hotel in a very good location in London. Good service. Elevator interior is very tripp-y and there are some cool details in the hotel. The room is very nice and stylish, but some details are just a bit over-designed, like the shower, which didn't have any shelves.",4,2018,09,12
132,"Considering how ridiculously cool this place is, there's a super friendly welcome in store.","When you walk into the Sanderson, you could be mistaken for thinking this is the place where the elite hang out, quirky chairs, high ceilings and a minimilist feel. Thankfully the staff greeting you are there to put you at ease if this kind of thing is daunting. 

If you have time for cocktails at the Long Bar (great for people watching), and like gin, don't miss Stranger Things, a short gin drink, but ONLY if it can be made by Evo - it won't be the same otherwise.",5,2018,09,11
132,Wonderful stay,"Stopped one night and wished I could have stayed longer. Really attentive and friendly staff team. Fabulous room which was beautiful and spotlessly clean. Really great location near to Regents Park, Oxford Street and theatres.",5,2018,09,08
132,"Modern, hip, lush, somewhat off the touristy path, yet central -- perfect","Having lived in London a number of years, I knew where I wanted to stay for a few days when showing my kids the city. Fitzrovia is very central (near Kings Cross and Euston train stations; couple of blocks to Oxford St), but is somewhat quieter and off the touristy path. Tons of great cafes, pubs and restaurants nearby. The hotel is modern, hip, and lush from the foyer, bars, courtyard to the space-design elevators and rooms; the gym and spa has everything the heart may desire. My teenage daughters loved the fact that when we pulled in on an evening, the bar off the foyer was a happening place with a DJ playing. Rooms are spacious and well designed, with a super-comfy bed in the middle; the bathroom is lush. My biggest regret was that after one night I had to go on an unforeseen business trip, which meant that my stay at the Sanderson was cut short. The rest of the family enjoyed the hotel a couple of days more, but alas I will have to wait until my next trip to London to make use of all the Sanderson has to offer.",5,2018,09,03
132,Modern and luxurious ,"Really like this hotel, cool, modern vibe, with clean lines in the rooms. But very comfortable. Stayed here for 3 nights in a large suite with large bath within the room. 
Great restaurant and bar with delicious cocktails.
Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,09,03
132,"Bespoke, unique, boutique. Loved it","We spent 2 nights at The Sanderson on Berners Street London at the end of August for my husband's 50th birthday and we both had such a fabulous stay.
Firstly we booked through Secret Escapes and paid £440 for 2 nights bed and breakfast in a superior room. I contacted the hotel by email before our stay to let them know we were celebrating and to book an evening meal on the second night. When we arrived the room was not ready as we were a bit early, the receptionist said that she would like to upgrade us if we were happy to wait which we really were. Within 20 minutes the room was ready. The bedroom was very quirky and modern, the floating bed was huge and in the middle of the room at an angle. No view to speak of but we didn't expect one. The bathroom was ultra modern and perfectly workable.
We had a drink in the hotel bar before heading off for an evening meal and being from ‘The Sticks’ we found the prices a bit shocking but as this was a celebration-weekend we just got on with it. The staff were all lovely, the breakfast was outstanding. We also pre-booked a meal in the hotel restaurant on the second night and we were joined by our family. The meal was amazing. I originally thought the menu was a bit limited but actually it allows them to cook what they do offer very well and everything was perfect, the monkfish was to die for.
The hotel sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne to our room and a small birthday cake for my husband's birthday. I tried to send the lady away saying we hadn't ordered it but she insisted it was from the hotel which I thought was pretty amazing ….so definitely let them know you are celebrating. We did charge an extra £500 to our room over the weekend so the hotel benefitted from our visit too.
Before our meal we had our first drink in the hotel and then used a few bars around the hotel of which there are many, returning for our evening meal at the allotted time. Our grown up children were very impressed with the modern theme of the hotel. The long bar is very bright and modern, the outside courtyard was beautiful complete with waterfall and pink flamingos and not at all cold under the outdoor heaters and canopies. The pool table room is amazing and a work of art, a real photo opportunity, as is the reception area. The purple bar which opens late and is for residents only is dark, velvety and sumptuous and we enjoyed another bottle of champagne in there and asked permission for our family to join us which was fine.
I don't think we've ever come away from a hotel so full of how special it was. Our children are 24 and 27 and they were so impressed and couldn't understand why their dear old parents were staying somewhere so contemporary. The outside of the hotel is a little disconcerting resembling an old hospital block but this adds to the wow factor inside. Such a different experience from the norm of boring hotel chains. If you want a treat, great food and a buzzing, trendy atmosphere then give it a try. Communication with the hotel before hand was excellent and on leaving we realised we had not emptied our safe which had a considerable amount of cash in it. They rang me back within an hour, the cash had been found and they quickly arranged to return it to us. We blamed our sore heads from the night before but sadly I think turning 50 just made us forgetful!",5,2018,08,31
132,An excellent boutique hotel in a good location,"The Sanderson is exactly what the title says.
The rooms are well appointed, and stylish in design with innovative use of opaque glass to act as a bathroom wall and pictures on the ceiling etc.
The lift (elevator) is fun too.  it is a sort of infinity lift designed to make you feel as though you’re walking into space with stars all around you.
The food is good, and there’s and outdoor area in the centre of the hotel where you and eat, drink or relax.
I once stayed in the rooftop suite which has a lovely balcony and is highly recommended.
Although do be careful if you forget to wear a towel or bathrobe because the offices over the road can see you clearly.
Location-wise, it’s a block and a half off Oxford Street, towards the end near the Dominion Theatre, so it’s pretty well situated.",5,2018,08,29
132,Superb afternoon tea - Mad Hatters tea party,"What a fantastic experience. 
The staff were excellent, very friendly and super attentive. The afternoon tea of a very high standard and the experience very memorable. 
Loved it all, especially the marshmallow mushrooms, very tasty in deed.  ",5,2018,08,25
132,Just wow!,I was just waiting for the wifi to start working so that i can write this review. One of the best hotels i have ever stayed at.  Sanders deserve the applauds and the credits for the service they provide.,5,2018,08,21
132,Cool as cool can be,"This feels like it's a hotel aimed at the extremely cool and beautiful people. 

Foyer just a tad on the too much side for me but clearly there are those who love this quirky ultra-modern feel. 
Having paid for my room in advance I was advised that a 100 UK pound per night security deposit would be required, in my case, 500 UK for 5 nights,  I suggested this was excessive and was advised that, ""I'd be surprised how extras can mount up"", ( thank you) and that it 'used to be 200 UK pounds per night'. 
I mean, these guys have my credit card number and they've had my money for a few weeks now. It's too much. 

The room was spacious and swishy, nice workspace, and built-in sofa, and lots of floaty white curtains as dividers, which was lovely; the bathroom space was very generous ( no where in the shower to put any soap or accesories tho which is a miss for this calibre of premises. 
My room faced west, which made it very hot if the blinds were not down all day, and it was over the courtyard which made it difficult to sleep because of late drinkers, I had been advised that the area would close at 11:00pm, but when I called reception at 12:30am there was more discussion about who had given me the erroneous advice than trying to address the problem. 
One other small gripe, the corridors are lit only by floor plate room numbers, this was a cause of much hilarity amongst various guests in the elevators, these are ridiculously dark.
Surely lighting can be ambient and low key without me having to wear night goggles.",4,2018,08,20
132,CONGRATULATIONS SANDERSON!!!!!,"I could not wait to write my review so I am writing it during my stay. I am loving my stay at the hotel. The moment you step inside the lobby the scent takes you somewhere else, the furniture and the configuration of the lobby is like you are at Dali's house, with oversized furniture, plenty vaporous sheers...beautiful. I am staying at room 302. It is Beautiful, very big and it follows the concept of the lobby. If you are looking for a traditional hotel room or hotel,  this hotel is not for you...But challenge yourself and try, you will be surprised!!!!. Bed is very comfortable, I love the pillows and if you need more...housekeeping team are very helpful .I stayed yesterday when they were cleaning and the attention to detail and care they put in their job make you feel at home. THANKS LADIES!!!.  As I don't want you to think that this is written by them, the only downside for me is breakfast (I am a lover of breakfast), It is fine, but I was expecting more. The buffet is limited and there is no option of hot breakfast included  so you have to decide between a la carte with all the cooked breakfast or buffet with cold options. I think this can be improved by adding an option from la carte for the buffet. I don't want to finish without talking about the location. Close to high street and soho, but I highly recommend to go to the back to FITZROVIA. It is like being in a small town in the centre of london. Huge selection of restaurants and bars you can spend two whole days experiencing Fitzrovia.
SO CONGRATULATIONS SANDERSON!!!!.",5,2018,08,19
132,Mad Hatter Afternoon Tea,"Such a magical wonderful afternoon tea, try to get a garden table if you can ... the food is delicious and plentiful , all Alice themed!! The staff are all so lovely especially on the hotel reception desk who happily minded our luggage/shopping while we went in for our afternoon tea.",5,2018,08,17
132,dated rooms- needs refreshing,"location is excellent, the hotel itself is great. Decent restaurant, (although the staff let it down). The long bar has a huge selection of cocktails and they are great, have sampled most :-). The staff in the bar are great too.

The room was a huge let down, it was certainly stylish but now old, literally everything in our room could do with being replaced. 

All in all a decent stay however for three hundred pounds a night i expected more from the room.",3,2018,08,17
132,Great hotel and wonderful service.,"My first impression of this hotel was awesome. It was a funky hotel in a hip part of town. 

However, what sets the place apart is their service. I was pretty tired checking out and I left my camera behind at the front desk. I called and they helped me find the camera and then sent it to me. I had it back within a week. They went above and beyond what I would have expected. 

So great rooms. Great ambiance. Funky atmosphere. Great customer service.",5,2018,08,16
132,Long Weekend in London,"Great hotel for a long weekend in London. Excellent location with Oxford Street, Soho, Shaftesbury Avenue,  Leicester Square, Covent Garden only a few minutes walk. 

Excellent decor in the hotel, rooms while small are pretty well appointed and more than functional. 

Long bar a great place to catch hip with friends and the Purple Bar is perfect for a late night drink when you get back to the hotel. 

Staff are friendly, helpful and genuine.",4,2018,08,14
132,always something going on!,"Back to the Sanderson again. This was a shorter trip, so I knew jet lag was going to be a problem. The Sanderson staff found me a quiet room at the end of a hall, life was good. As usual, the room was great, the staff was helpful and the location can't be beat.

The last day before I left there was an interesting event. Around 11am I started noticing well-dressed people coming into the Sanderson. Suits, ""summer party dresses"", even a few tuxedos and summer gowns. It turns out that ""Secret brunch"" had texted out the Sanderson as their location for the week.

People got the texts at 10am, and some told me they drove or trained up to 2 hours(!) to come to the party, partly because it was being held at the Sanderson long bar.

Just an sample of how much some people like the Sanderson, it's location, food, hospitality and bar.

Another visit to London, another great stay at the Sanderson.",5,2018,08,10
132,"Great location, lovely rooms","Stayed here a few times and tried several different rooms. All very cool design and great bathrooms with rain showers. Breakfast is wonderful and the location is great, bar is a lot of fun too on an evening",4,2018,08,07
132,Absolutely amazing hotel!,"After an extremely long flight and crabby airport people and fellow travelers....I walked into this amazing, serene, heavenly smelling lobby to be greeted by a hotel staff that took customer service to a whole new level! The lobby feels like you are stepping into a world class spa from the decor to this amazing smell that is throughout the hotel.  I have traveled all over the world and never had an experience quite like the Sanderson Hotel ...",5,2018,08,06
132,Two nights of stylish comfort ,"Love the style, the bathroom with fabulous shower and toiletries, quiet peaceful rooms despite being in the centre of London... and obviously an amazing location. Good value in its market. Giving this 10/10",5,2018,08,06
132,"Weird Layout, Poor Design","Currently staying here for over a week and it's only been 2 nights.  The location is great right off of Berner's street but the room feels like it was poorly thought out.  The fixtures are terrible and don't turn on.  The bathroom is the worst part of the room design.  There is no shelf in the shower so everytime you need an item, you need to put it on the counter and open the door.  When you start the shower, you have to close the door because it's so small and so the water won't splash out.  There is no towel ring near the shower (which makes no sense).  The bathroom isn't very private and water splashes all over the glass in front of it.  

The housekeeping staff also knocks on your door on a Saturday morning before 9am to do housekeeping... this has never happened before at a hotel as a common courtesy.  The bed isn't very comfortable and the pillows are flat as pancakes.  I requested foam pillows and they felt even worse and were lumpy.  My husband has a neck ache from the terrible pillows and sleep.  If you don't put the shades up, the sun is shining in your face at 5am.  There are also no plugs next to the nightstand table or bed so you can't charge your phone.

I'm considering swapping hotels even though we have a lot longer to go here, this doesn't seem like a 5 star hotel experience.  We've stayed down the block many times and have had much better experiences.  

Even the entrance was poorly designed with steps not thinking that people have luggage.  Wouldn't recommend this hotel.  This hotel is not family friendly as well.",2,2018,07,28
132,Like a dream!!!,"The first thing i liked when i did visit this hotel was the reception and the bar!! Was sooo romantic. We booked a junior suite and it was a dream!! Everything was so clean, the staff was so excellent and the amenities in the room were unforgettable!! Thank you so much!!!",5,2018,07,18
132,old friend,another trip to London and another excellent stay at the Sanderson. Happened to be there during World Cup. Lots of pubs showed the game so easy to see and feel the excitement. Sanderson is also close to shopping at SoHo. Always good at the Sasnderson but i might try the new Mondrian next time.,5,2018,07,17
132,Alice in wonderland afternoon tea ,"Came here for afternoon tea as a little surprise for the better half. 
The tea names are funny and they are all flavoursome and of good quality. 

The sandwiches then came out and were slightly cold when they should be warm and slightly warm when they should be cold ? 
They didn’t really give very good descriptions of the sandwiches but hey ho these things happen. 
The pastry’s were nice and flavoursome with some very simple little touches that added that made the theme work a little better. 
Unfortunately won’t be going back but it was enjoyable, as are the other thousands of afternoon teas in London ",4,2018,07,17
132,Lovely,"From the scent at the lobby to the friendly staff.
Definitely one of the favorite hotels here in London. Located very conveniently close to main Central roads such as Oxford and Carnaby. Room service and food quality is immpecable. A friend of mine even praised their tea room.",5,2018,07,16
132,Awesone,The best thing about the hotel is it’s staff.. extremely polite and efficient. I got checked in immediately even though I arrived at 8 am. Love the interior.. everything about the hotel is a conversation piece. The Long bar is gorgeous.. food is the only disappointment. ,4,2018,07,07
132,I love it,"My favourite spot in London. Beautiful hotel in the center of London, modern rooms, great service and I really love the purple bar where you can access only as hotel guest and please order the once-in-a-lifetime lemongras martinis. Will be back in November!",5,2018,07,03
132,Timeless,"I first stayed here when it first opened, and stayed here again earlier this month.  everything is still so white and looks so new..... overall a very pleasant stay.  

the room layout was revolutionary when it first opened but more common nowadays.... the bed in the middle of the room, a picture on the ceiling, glass wall wrap around the bathroom.  

the biggest frustration is the shower, the switches are hard to use especially when hands are wet, there is no shelf space and the water leaked outside..... also the food downstairs was disappointing.... 35 for a steak, perhaps 4oz, overcooked and barely warm.

i will come back for the room & the drinks!",4,2018,06,24
132,Nice but not for me,"I spent a few nights at the Sanderson in June. Staff were nice, the hotel comfortable, but I found the room impractical and the overall decor wasn't for me. The bed at an angle upset my OCD, as well as the weird painting stuck on the ceiling. There is nowhere to put stuff in the shower - looks amazing but not designed for practicality. Each evening I'd come back to the room set up for the night, with candle alight, all sheer curtains drawn (a bit spooky for my taste). Sure, it's quirky for one night, and the elevator is a talking point, but I wouldn't come back for a long stay.",4,2018,06,22
132,"Great Hotel , location and Staff ","Loved this hotel . Very cool , great vibe , large rooms by London standards , great bar and restaurant.

Best though were the staff . Nigel on check in was just magic , he is the secret sauce and sets the best tone on check in . An Aussie and just a great bloke , no fuss ,and nothing a problem . He accommodated a late checkout with no fuss . This is very rare these days , but should be applauded 

Wonderful stay, try it ",5,2018,06,21
132,Great time at the agua spa,"Decided to celebrate a friend's 50th birthday by having a luxury facial using 'nuxe' products and there aren't many spas that offer this brand so we booked at the Sanderson Agua spa. The receptionist at the time of booking was really helpful and lovely and I received a call prior to our day to confirm the booking.  On arrival we were welcomed into the spa which in itself is quite amazing..a labyrinth of curtained, sections where everybody whispers but this in itself is quite awesome.  Robes and slippers were supplied and we waited in a lovely area before before being met by our therapists. The facial was gorgeous, beautiful products and a really relaxing facial..even the beds had duvets on for ultimate relaxation. Thank you Sandy for the amazing treatment!  Then to relax following the treatment..a separate area for just us two with end to end beds and fluffy duvets with the highlight being an unexpected glass of bubbly as it was a special occasion..this made the day even more special and was really appreciated.. A bit more expensive than some facials but fantastic for a special occasion/treat....can't wait to go back!",5,2018,06,20
132,Another amazing stay at Sanderson!,"When it came to deciding where to spend my husband's 50th Birthday celebrations, I knew I had to book another night at Sanderson! Having spent our wedding anniversary (and several other special occasions) at the hotel last year, we were so impressed with the service, attention to detail and the overall cool vibe that it was the obvious choice. A massive thankyou to Paris who went to such effort to make it so memorable, with the champagne and a lovely personalised card for Mike, aswell as amazing room upgrade. A special thanks also to Marta in the Purple Bar for being so friendly and generous with her time and conversation. To top it off, fantastic cocktails in the Long Bar, fun and laughter in the billiard room and the utter madness of the pink flamingoes in the courtyard! This really is one of the coolest hotels in London. We love it and will keep coming back.",5,2018,06,18
132,Always Fantastic - My Favourite Hotel,"I have visited Sanderson on several occasions staying on business and pleasure.  It never fails and always lives up to its reputation and is my favourite hotel.  I stay in a lot of hotels and I know what makes a great hotel.  Everything at the Sanderson is fantastic.  We booked the hotel to celebrate my sons 21st and everyone at the hotel went the extra mile to make it extra special.  This started with Paris who communicated everything to me beforehand and ensured all worked smoothly. Paris is a special member of the staff at Sanderson and went the extra mile to provide us with a room upgrade.  Celia checked us in and again conducted this brilliantly and arranged for a cake to be in my Sons room when he arrived.  On arrival, my son was very impressed with the hotel and his room upgrade, he said celebrating his birthday at Sanderson was very special.  The rooms, public areas and facilities at Sanderson are all first class.  We spent several hours at the cocktail bar and again the staff were brilliant.   I must also mention Larisa who looked after us at Breakfast, she was an absolute pleasure to speak to in the morning.  I watched her with all guests and she spoke to everyone with such professionalism and positivity.  I regard Sanderson as my favourite hotel in the world, what makes it achieve this status is the people, the staff at Sanderson are truly magical.  I want to thank everyone for making our special weekend very special.  Can't wait to visit you guys again.",5,2018,06,18
132,Beautiful design isn’t always practical!,"We booked a night away and had a lovely, comfortable stay. The room was a good size and very quiet but some of the design features were a little annoying; everything in the room is at a funny angle. The shower is gorgeous but there’s no shelf to put anything on, meaning it all gets soaked on the floor. There’s no dressing table and no mirror with a plug nearby. Finally, the bathroom is essentially part of the bedroom. My husband and I have been married a while so are not phased by that but some couples may find the fact that nothing is kept private a bit tricky. 
All these are really quite minor points and we did enjoy our stay. The location is great and the staff are fantastic. ",4,2018,05,28
132,Swanky artsy chic,This place melds swanky chic with artsy cool. It’s become my home away from home in the UK as I’ve been staying here for over 15 years. The Long Bar serves excellently executed cocktails & the room service is always tasty. The rooms are minimal but uber cool with all the right touches...if you can - get one of the larger rooms and you won’t be disappointed. Starck got the decor right on this one and it never seems to get old. The purple bar is the jewel in the Sanderson crown... insanely creative late night cocktails served in a sexy velvet setting.,5,2018,05,27
132,My wife's favourite hotel in London,"I booked Sanderson Hotel for my wife and daughter for one night along with a couple of treatments for each of them  in the spa. My wife and daughter cannot stop talking about what a fabulous experience they had.
Spa staff were lovely and massages and pedicures were excellent. They ate out elsewhere in the evening but enjoyed a really tasty lunch in the Long Bar and also had superb breakfast in their room on Sunday morning.
After dinner out they came back to the hotel and enjoyed great cocktails in The Purple Bar ( residents only).
They were upgraded when checking in which surprised and delighted them,  and everyone  member of staff they came in contact with was invariably smiling and friendly. Room was in my daughter's words ""gorgeous"" and bed supremely comfortable.
I booked the hotel for them as a Mothers Day present and I may have made a rod for my own back in that I may have to do the same every year from now on, because my wife insists it is now her favourite hotel in London !! 
Having made the booking for them I wanted to arange for some cards and gifts and a bottle of champagne to be waiting in their room as a surprise when they checked in. 
This didn't go as planned and my inital call to the hotel didn't resolve matters but then I spoke to Nigel on reception and he personally delivered the gifts and then took the trouble to call me back to confirm he had done so. The subsequent follow up and apology i received from Paris Barati was extremely gracious and kind,  and she completely exceeded any expectations I might have had around any goodwill guesture, by her follow up actions.
Any hotel or organisation must occassionally experience a service slippage but the test is how your respond,  and Nigel initially and then notably Paris could not have done more to restore my faith and leave me feeling genuinely valued and delighted.",5,2018,05,26
132,Incredibly helpful in a very difficult situation,"I stayed with my family at the Sanderson in early May for an extended holiday weekend. Having stayed at the hotel before we knew what to expect: a great location, nice rooms, super comfortable beds (!), an attractive (long) bar and a lovely patio. What made this stay unforgettable was a mishap on my part which took place on a Saturday night: I accidentally left my wallet in a cab on the way to the hotel - half of my life was in there. What happened then at the hotel was service the way I have never experienced it before. So many staff members went out of their way to help me get my wallet back and - helped also by some other lucky coincidences - the next day, just before our departure I had my wallet (and with it half of my life!) back in my hands! A very special thanks to Ruth - my life saviour - you were amazing making sure that all came together for us in the end! For me you are the hotel's employee of the month ... We will be back for sure! Thank you all who helped at making this a truly unforgettable stay in London.",5,2018,05,23
132,Impeccable Sanderson,"Can’t say enough nice things to say about the Sanderson. Level of service is outstanding. From Jonathan at the front desk along with the very nice girl from Sweden and very friendly and social. Paris, guest relation experience manager, was simply the best. She went above and beyond to make our stay perfect and was always there if we needed her. She was super friendly and fantastic at what she does. Even the bellmen were super polite and receptive. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a Loft Suite and the room was so spacious and well decorated. The hotel is an Instagram paradise, which my girlfriend and I made full use of and just off of Oxford Street, which is great for tourism and not far from Soho for bars and restaurants. The long bar had great G&T’s and the Purple bar was a dark, yet extremely unique bar which had great Alice in Wonderland drinks. Only slight hiccup we had was the Bluetooth speaker in our suite was on and someone in a different guest room accidentally connected to ours and woke us with a loud blast of music, but hey things can happen. When we return to London there’s only place we’ll be staying, the Sanderson. ",5,2018,05,14
132,Thoroughly theatrical and quirky,"The staff couldn’t be more attentive and welcoming. I took my daughter also for The Mad Hatters Tea which was really delicious and we also used the spa which was truly fabulous. Especially the billowy curtains and marshmallow cocooning resting pods. Very high quality staff all round. We liked the fact that you didn’t need a PhD to work the shower or lighting. On,off - great ! Loved all the quirky touches like the galaxy lift, the pool room and the atmospheric cocktail bar. Would definitely come back !",5,2018,05,13
132,Beautiful hotel & very helpful staff,"We booked a room at Sanderson to use as a location for a wedding makeup and hair trial, and not only was the hotel beautiful and perfectly located for our needs, but the staff were phenomenally helpful. Once our reason for staying was established, the team did everything they could do to make our brief stay with them as special as possible, including a room upgrade and complimentary food and drinks! A special thanks to Charlotte from Front Office and also Andres from Concierge for all of your help. We'll be back!",5,2018,05,10
132,Loved it,"I thought this place was great. The room was nice and I thought the curtains as room dividers gave it a great vibe. The cheese and wine, the personal notes, the macaroons, all great touches. The lounge downstairs had a live DJ a few nights and the private lounge for guests had great bartenders.",5,2018,05,03
132,The first impression is the one that stays...,"Cannot say that it was a good experience at all.
At the check-in, staff was not friendly at all, and I was not provided with any help with my luggage. There was no one to show me the room appliances either, I had to find my floor, and room by my own, as well as starting pressing buttons in the room in order to discover why they were there for.
The room is extremely noisy and there is no soundproofing at all. If you want to have a good night of sleep avoid it. I could hear people talking and walking on the street as if the windows were opened. The indoor noise was no different, I could hear absolutely everything that was happening through my room’s door.
Everything inside of the room has a plastic and a printed label threatening about its removal and a full price charge. I felt like in a cheap motel somewhere. It is definitely a not good way of selling amenities.
When ordering room service for breakfast, received a call almost at midnight informing that the meal that was at the menu was no longer available.
The same was found when checking the menu breakfast that was supposed to be hanged outside of the door. They both had discrepancies and were different.
I did not have bed sheets in my room, just a blanket covering my bed. Really!? 
The only good experiences that I had was with the concierge team and at the Purple Bar, that has amazing cocktails and lovely staff. 
Everything else was pointless...",2,2018,05,03
132,Excellent lunch,"We were very happy with our lunch, three courses and a gin cocktail for £28. The ratatouille was the best I've had and didn't detract from the flavour of the sea-bass. The banana dessert was also very good. We were well looked after by our server too, who was happy to provide more butter for our bread. Would definitely come again.",5,2018,05,02
132,Beginning to look a little dated but service always exceptional.,I have stayed here a number of times and have always been well looked after. On a Thursday and Friday night there is always a cool vibe in the bar and a great place to meet friends or colleagues for a few drinks before heading out. Rooms are great and the service from reception is always fantastic.,4,2018,04,30
132,Afternoon tea - Mad Hatters Tea Party,Surprise for my mum's 70th. Wow wow wow is all I can say. It was outstanding. The staff were fantastic and food and service were out of this world. Lovely cocktails in the bar. Yes expensive but the hotel is so lovely and for a special treat i would pay for it over again. Customer service perfect,5,2018,04,29
132,Stylish Sanderson,"Very good hotel.  Discreet building.  Staff all excellent from start to finish.  There had been heavy snow in London on the day we turned up (in March) and despite manfully clearing the snow from outside the gentleman on the door still found time to walk over, smile and welcome us.

The suit had a wonderful large decked balcony.  Standing out there in the snow at night looking over the rooftops was quite uplifting.  The suit is divided up by billowing curtains, which at first takes a bit of getting used to, but worked well and maintained a sense of light and space.

The long bar was good.  Great place for people-watching on a Friday night.",4,2018,04,26
132,Talk about PERFECT MANAGEMENT! Flawless staff!! Incredible location!,"After 3 days, i extended my stay; why? It was that good. I travel a lot as a personal shopper, and have been to LONDON countless times. Haven’t repeated a hotel yet. Was looking at the Edition, which is my favorite in Miami, and the Sanderson. The rooms at Sanderson were larger and the hotels are almost across the street from each other. Wow, am I pleased with this choice! It’s a beautiful design hotel with excellent bar, restaurant, rooms, and mostly, the rarest of rares: a staff that makes every person feel welcome. I wont mention names because i t was literally every single person who works here! The manager is incredible. She could teach her skills...a staff like this happens maybe once in 50 5 star hotels. Every person is friendly, gracious, considerate, and effective, from doormen, belllmen, servers, bartenders, room service is tasty and prompt, the bar is legendary with expert mixologists (ask for the white lady) the cleaning staff goes the extra mile. Fully stocked minibar,lots of free Evian in your room. Huge free-standing tub and luxurious toiletries, including bubble bath! Towels and robes and all linens are top notch. Bed comfortable. Tea and coffee selection provided includes high quality teas and Starbucks via.  The design is unique, and if you’re looking for the regular homey look...this isn’t your pace, though the staff is so warm that it did feel homey to me. If you love being pampered, if you adore clean lines with unique accessories, such as art weights in your room, you’ll love it here. Oxford is a couple blocks away, china town super close too. About 100 restaurants within a couple blocks. I loved greyhound which was a casual Thai place down the street. Take a left out of the front door and its on your left.  In the evenings you will be tempted to just hang out here, the vibe is that good. I cant say enough nice things... and I’m known to be a fussy perfectionist. The biggest compliment is: I will return and recommend to all my friends.",5,2018,04,23
132,"Wonderful stay, Great customer service","We stayed here for 1 night celebrating my husbands birthday.
Prior to our arrival I made contact with the hotel and Leonardo from the front desk was so helpful, reserved us a great room and organised some extra special touches for my husband
On arrival we were made to feel very welcome, front desk staff were friendly and helpful.

We stayed in a loft suite, it was stylish, spacious and bright and the extra touches arranged for my husbands birthday were just  wonderful. When we returned to the room at the end of the day it looked absolutely beautiful.
Great bar area, great breakfast.
Cannot imagine staying anywhere else now when in London, my  new favourite place!",5,2018,04,23
132,"Great location, amazing spa!","Stayed here before, and back because I love the location of the hotel, the style and decor, the rooms, and especially the spa.  Best facial ever with Matthew, using Natura Bisse products from Spain.  Always go back for a facial there when I am in London!",4,2018,04,17
132,Fancy but very impracticable,"This hotel is very unfunctional. It's very clear that whoever designed hotel has never been a guest. The bathroom is a joke. Mirror at an angle from the sink, counter at an angle from the wall. Good look trying to shave. It's impossible to operate the faucet with the hands wet, because the handles are polished round metal. It's impossible to open the shower without getting wet with cold water, as the handles are behind the water stream and the thing is very narrow. The shower place has no door or curtain and you'll freeze. Room has no heating and was always cold at night. The bed is at an angle in the bedroom, killing A LOT of useful space. Who had these ""brilliant ideas""? The thing is fancy for sure, but it's fancy just for the sake of being fancy. First day you'll love it. By the third day, you'll be furious.",2,2018,04,15
132,Great decor and location with fantastic facilities!,"Stayed here for 3 nights over the Easter Bank holiday, thoroughly enjoyed the stay and facilities throughout from the moment we stepped into the hotel for check-in, really posh with a famous and great bar for most Londoners , added on top of the fact that it’s just a 5 minutes walk to the Oxford Street and located in between two train stations in Tottenham Court road, and Oxford Circus. 

Real value for money too! ",5,2018,04,12
132,Ok not great,"I had the opportunity to try 3 different rooms over 3 nights, 2 different deluxe rooms and 1 loft suite. The hotel entrance and ground floor areas are really nice and the lifts are quirky and unusual however that’s where it ends. My overall impression was the same for all 3 rooms, great size with load of space but completely lacking in any character or atmosphere to the point of blandness 

All rooms were decorated in the same minimalist style, plain grey walls with limited furniture and no artwork on any wall, the only hint of anything was when you pulled down the blinds which were decorated. One of the deluxe rooms had a huge empty space as you walked into the room, there was plenty of space for a seat/table so not sure why it had been left empty. All the rooms had a small round table but no real desk space for working so not the best choice if you are on business and planning on working. Beds were really comfortable and I slept really well

The bathrooms are a glass box in the room, enclosed in retractable white and gold curtains, the gold curtain should be electric but this failed to work in 2 of the 3 rooms. The bathrooms overall were very modern looking however completely impractical for use during the night due to the bathroom light lighting up the bedroom so disturbing anyone else in the room. In all rooms we only had one glass in the bathroom so needed to be shared, when all other hotels I’ve been to have 2, we also had only shampoo instead of shower gel in the loft suite, just a small thing but a little frustrating.

Lighting in all rooms was at a minimum but particularly noticeable in the loft suite where there was just a single hanging light in the living area and 2 bedside lamps in the bedroom, barely enough to light the room particularly as the loft suites are on the lower floors so the natural light isn’t as strong.

Also lacking were plug sockets, one only in the living area which was used up by the bluetooth speaker provided and a couple on one side on the bedroom, as the bed sits in the centre of the room you need a long cable to be able to reach it when you are in bed and the person on the other side has no available sockets, not really acceptable in age of technology where we need to be constantly charging devices.

We had breakfast in the room on the last day, this was ordered for 6.30am (the earliest time you can order fora) and arrived exactly on time. It all looked great and tasted fine however was luke warm so we couldn't eat everything which was disappointing. 

Overall the hotel is nice and reasonable value for money as the rooms are a good size however the lack of attention to some of the small details was really noticable and makes a difference when there is a lot of competition",3,2018,04,08
132,Excellent &  recommended hotel with greate location מלון מעולה מומלץ ובמיקום מצויין,"We stayed 3 nights, in this  hotel with excellent location just 1 minute from Oxford Street, 2 minutes from a subway station. The room is pampering, clean and cozy with TV and free Wi-Fi. A courteous staff, always smiling and willing to help. Excellent breakfast. In the lobby you will find advice and assistance in purchasing tickets for attractions, explanations and more.

נשארנו 3 לילות, מיקום מעולה 1 דקה מרחוב אוקספורד, 2 דקות מתחנת רכבת תחתית. החדר מפנק, נקי ונעים כולל טלויזיה ואינטרנט אלחוטי. צוות אדיב, תמיד מחייכים ומוכנים לעזור. ארוחת בוקר מצויינת. בלובי שרות ייעוץ ועזרה ברכישת כרטיסים לאטרקציות מפות הסברים ועוד.",5,2018,04,06
132,Amazing as usual!,"I don’t normally write reviews however this time i could not resist. Everything from the very first minute we walked in was impeccable!!! The staff, the room and the food are most probably the best in London.  People like Nikola, Ivo, Paris and Mihnea are the reason why this hotel should be awarded an extra star. Thank you guys for everything. See you soon!",5,2018,04,05
132,All-Around Fantastic Experience,"I stayed at the hotel with my boyfriend for a week over new years and the entire experience was exceptional. Every single staff member was overwhelmingly helpful and courteous. The room was GORGEOUS - it is very spacious and the bed sits in the middle of the room. All interior walls are glass with retractable white curtains, which makes the room feel very large and luxurious. 

The food was exceptional.  We ate at the Long Bar, had drinks at the purple bar, and also ordered room service.  In each case, service was prompt and friendly, and the food both tasty and satisfying.  For meals out of the hotel, we found the Sanderson Concierge team to be incredibly knowledgeable, guiding us to both not-to-be-missed London Staples, as well as lesser-known local favorites. 

You can't beat the location-it is perfect.  A short walk to any of the West End theaters,  fantastic pubs, and great shopping areas.  

Our stay at the Sanderson was one of the best, if not THE best, hotel experiences either of us has had in our lives.

I have already recommended it to several friends and colleagues headed to London and will be sure to stay there again myself the next time I am in town.",5,2018,04,04
132,My number one choice in London,"This was the third December in a row we (friends and family) have gathered at the Sanderson pre-Christmas. This time there were 11 of us in 6 rooms and it was as fantastic as ever. As always, the Mad Hatter tea party was brilliant, the spa was a dream, the hotel was fabulous and the staff fantastic. The location is just perfect - in central London on a quiet street within easy walking distance of Oxford Street, Regent Street, Bond Street, Soho, Covent Garden, the theatre district and more. The hotel is super stylish and contemporary, the rooms are always spotlessly clean and so comfortable, love the Malin+Goetz products in the massive modern bathrooms, and the staff are just brilliant from the front desk to the concierge to the restaurant and bar to housekeeping...100% praise and thanks to all of them for another wonderful stay. Highly recommended.",5,2018,04,04
132,Outstanding ,"WOW what a hotel!!!!!

This hotel is simply stunning.  It is very ultra modern and contemporary, and for many hotels I’ve stayed at in the same category of star ratings, this certainly doesn’t disappoint.

The large reception area has gorgeous sofa’s, a peculiarly looking plastic ball hanging from the ceiling you can actually sit inside (I didn’t, just in case!) a fabulous hidden little bar, super cool/futuristic lifts and fabulous staff.  We had the pleasure of being checked in by some outstanding team members, a big thank you to Jose, Paris and Ruth who made the check in effortless and so so friendly.  We were checked out by by an equally pleasure to meet Leonardo.

The room was simply stunning.  I haven’t stayed anyway like it!  Large, airy, contemporary, beautifully decorated and slightly minimalistic which we liked.  We had also a fabulous terrace....just wished it hadn’t rained the entire time so we could enjoy it!!!!  Absolutely gorgeous monsoon shower, the tub was to die for and the heavenly bed....it will be very hard to find anything else that will even come close!

The bar area is for me, the is the hotel’s crown jewel.  Suspended flowers hang from the ceiling of the bar, which is like an island in the middle of the hotel.  We had amazing cocktails too made by Marta at the Purple Bar (wish we ordered more now!). We also chose to have our evening meal there too as we didn’t fancy going out in the rain!  Charlotte was the perfect host, who gave us a very romantic table and kept  checking on us every now and again to ensure we were having a great time.  Our waiter, I think who was called Minhea recommended some excellent food and even made some recommendations for breakfast....that for me was going the extra mile!  

Can’t wait to come back to the Sanderson, we had a very lovely time and felt special our entire stay!

Also, thank you CJ for keeping the a few of the people drinking at the bar in check, obviously a few too many cocktails had been had!",5,2018,04,03
132,Exceeded xpectations,"Staying at the Soho Hotel and Ham Yard as a rule in London we came with no expectations. However the minute we arrived the front doorman and reception staff had such effervescent personalities you couldn't help but be excited by your stay, says alot about a property when staff clearly love where they work.
Room was massive with a little corner sofa and work table, huge bed and bathroom, every amenity was thought of and Wifi excellent and fast. Breakfast also lovely.
Cant fault any part of our stay, wont hesitate for a moment to stay again.",5,2018,03,27
132,Smart & Stylish,"This was my first time staying at the Sanderson. From the outside, the building is nothing special. Once you step inside, its a different story, large open space with interesting pieces of art and seating around the space. Check in was quick, although only one lift was working. We had booked into the Loft Suite with Terrace. (Bare in mind, this was during the hell of the snow) So the terrace was covered in snow, a nice addition to this terrace would be to have the top covered and a heater put outside. The room was larger than I expected and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The bathroom was large with a shower and a bath if you were feeling really extra. Breakfast was included with our booking (unsure if standard), the breakfast was rather lacklustre and the menu to order from was very confusing, which resulted in items being missed. However, we did not mention this at the time as it was such a minor point. The rest of our stay was very enjoyable. The long bar is a great addition, with a good vibe and delicious cocktails.",4,2018,03,19
132,Mad hatters afternoon tea ,"We came for the fabulous Mad Hatter’s Afternoon Tea. When I booked we weren’t warned that some of the tables were outside however it was perfectly warm, sheltered and there were blankets which actually added to the experience. We had to wait for half an hour for our table, which considering we had book well in advance wasn’t optimal but fine. The actual afternoon tea itself was amazing, really fun but also delicious. The added touches for the special occasion were appreciated. I’d definitely return! ",4,2018,03,15
132,My old friend,"Been staying at the Sanderson for over 5 years and it delivers every time. Rooms are spacious, modern and well appointed. The long bar is a scene on the weekends, mostly professionals grabbing a drink and socializing. It's an SBE property so the vibe is chill and hip. Service is always excellent. Close to great restaurants like Sketch and Street XO, the Sanderson is a great choice if you're looking for a trendy, hip spot to explore London.",5,2018,03,09
132,Hotel Stay,This is a fantastic comfortable and chic hotel well located in London. The room is impeccably clean and the staff ever present and attentive. Room service is incredibly slow so you have to plan for that. The bars are fantastic and well attended by guests and some other beautiful people. I found the food in the restaurant to be exceptional with excellent service. I’ve had two multi-day stays at this hotel and as an international frequent traveler find it to be delightful. ,5,2018,03,08
132,Upgrade Always Good,"We arrived at the Sanderson at around 5:30pm and reception was busy - but having waited a short while we were greeted and upgraded to the penthouse suite - which was a fantastic room with various bathing and sleeping areas surrounding a well appointed dining and seating area/lounge.  The areas were segregated by chiffon curtains which made the whole space look amazing.

The hotel dining facilities and long cocktail bar were great.

Staff super.

All in all a memorable stay at the Sanderson. 

",5,2018,03,06
132,"Lots of style, very little substance","We supposedly had the best room type the hotel has, which consisted of a reasonably sized room with a wall right in the middle, a bed to one side of it and empty space to the other. 
There were no other walls except curtains and glass partitions. 
There was no soap dish or tray in the shower enclosure - toiletries had to go on the floor and you had to bend down to reach them. A quick, convenient and relaxing shower in the morning before a long day's work was out of the question. 
Water from shower and sink smelled strongly of chlorine. 
The socket for electric toothbrushes and trimmers was in the bedroom, not bathroom, near the floor. 
Housekeeping was trying to set the hotel on fire by leaving a tea light next to the curtains in an unattended room after every turn down. 
Only one lift was working. 
You had to ask for tea and coffee facilities to be brought to the room.
Pillows were horrible and limp.
Air conditioning in the room was super loud. 
I could also hear every door of every room on our floor opening and closing as well as the noises of staff going about their business all through the day and night. 

Staff was nice and service was decent. Room service dinner food was great as was breakfast downstairs. However, when I ordered a bowl of açaí and granola they gave me a bowl of greek yoghurt with açaí powder (and no granola) and tried to pass it off for an açaí bowl. The mixed berries that were supposed to accompany it consisted of 6 blueberries and the coconut was nonexistent.",2,2018,03,05
132,"Perfect location, stylish hotel, great service! ",Booked this hotel for one night for my husband's birthday and am so glad we did! The decor is so beautiful. The staff are super friendly. Having told the hotel prior to our stay that it was a special occasion we were delighted to be given complimentary upgrade when we arrived-our room was absolutely stunning! The long bar is worth a visit for sure; great cocktails and fantastic service from the barmen. Would definitely recommend. ,5,2018,03,03
132,Great city hotel,"The hotel has the best location, close to Oxford str, close to metro station and its id ideal for exploring and shopping. The rooms are small but clean, the staff is nice and the breakfast is delicious. The hotel is famous for its bar. a lot of people are coming after work for a cocktail. Friday and Saturday there is a party for all visitors.",5,2018,02,22
132,"""Amazing hotel with lovely staff and in a perfect location""","We have previously stayed at St Martins Lane hotel a few times which is one of our favourite hotels and is one of the hotels in this group. After our stay here, this is now our favourite hotel. The staff were all so friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough to make our stay amazing. It was my birthday and there was a cake brought to our room and then another slice of cake when we had dinner in the restaurant and they acknowledged it was my birthday on several occasions which was very nice. The food was very good for breakfast & dinner and the afternoon tea. The room was lovely an the hotel is in a great location. Cannot wait to return as this really was an amazing weekend spent at this hotel.",5,2018,02,20
132,Wonderful!! ,"Elegant room with extremely comfortable bed. The Service at the reception and restaurant was impeccable. Located close to all the trendy restaurants, bars and cafes. 
Special thanks to Gaby of the restaurant's service staff for excellent service! ",4,2018,02,15
132,Amazing stay...,"After our not so great stay previously, we were kindly put in touch with a lovely lady called Paris who made sure we had an amazing second stay here. They went out of their way to give us an amazing room with a beautiful breakfast. We had champagne in our room and were really turned in our opinion, and now we would always return here. Great location too. Just a shame the long bar wasn’t available to guests as there was a private function. This really would have added to our stay.

Thanks again",4,2018,02,11
132,Great Hotel ,"We visited here for a short weekend break..... The hotel is stunning, from the moment you walk in it feels very luxurious and chic. 
The front of house staff were very professional and helpful. Our room was the standard double..... which was lovely. The bathroom was my favourite place. 
The only problem  we had with our room was that the airconditioning panel wasn't working so we were unable to control the heating in our room. We did phone down to reception and they offered to send someone up, but we just wanted to get to sleep. Luckily it wasn't a cold evening. 
In the morning we had spoken to reception  again to request the tea and coffee making facilities and they again offered to send someone to look at the aircon. But we declined as we were about to get showered ect. They did kindly offer us a complementary breakfast in the restaurant bit we had a early lunch reservation. 
Overall the hotel is beautiful..... it is expensive, but wouldnt hesitate booking here again. 
Also a great location, just off Oxford Street.  ",4,2018,01,30
132,Way too many attempts to upsell,"Probably one of my less enjoyable hotel experiences recently - basically because of the upselling.  I booked two rooms directly with the hotel for a family stay in London.  At the time of booking, I asked for adjoining rooms - I was told this was not possible in my room category so it was suggested to me that I upgrade.  I said that it would be fine if the rooms were just close together.  I received two further automated upgrade emails before the stay.  On check in, getting rooms close together proved challenging (despite my request directly to the hotel 3 weeks' earlier) and again, it was suggested we upgrade.  I had already chosen a Superior room and didn't want to go any higher.  We eventually were allocated rooms - but (and this was my mistake) neither of the rooms had a bath.  I asked if there was a superior room with a bath (as we have small kids who need a bath) and I was told I would need to upgrade.  I have never experienced anything quite like this before and I did find it all quite off-putting.  Apart from that, the rooms were clean and housekeeping were very effective.  The breakfast was good.",3,2018,01,30
132,Sanderson,"Service provided by the Sanderson continues to be outstanding. As a frequent guest, I continue to be acknowledged as such and treated accordingly. The rooms are clean and spacious. Soho location is optimal for people who are looking to be close to many London attractions.  ",5,2018,01,23
132,Fantastic !!,"Our second stay at the Sanderson and what a stay it was !! The spa is to die for , the massage is the beat we have ever had by far and we have had many massages all over the world , Mike and Paris were fantasic at their jobs and made us feel so special , nothing was too much !!  , i would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat !!! And bang in amongst it all great location ... thank you for a great break",5,2018,01,23
132,Stylish Beautiful Elegant Divine!,"Unique, stunning, divine boutique style hotel. The staff were helpful, professional, friendly. The room was divine. Very simplistic but luxurious in details. The bathroom a dream. The bar downstairs at the side of the Lobby was a hotspot. The barmen friendly, helpful and the cocktails awesome. Great location. Close to Oxford Street. Lovely cafes and pubs just around the corner. We will definitely be back!

132,One of the best stays overnight in London,"The Hotel from the outside was not as amazing as the experience once we walked through the doors but this is in no way a bad point. The Staff were very helpful with all our request and informative with all our queries. The hotel had a very lovely interior, the decor well suited the theme of the hotel. The room was spaces and had everything you would need in a mondern hotel. The location was perfect, shopping was on your doorstep, theatre land wealking distance and everthing else was a short bus ride away. I highly reccomend the stay.",5,2018,01,16
132,Highly recommend ,"We stayed four nights during January 18. One of our group rooms was upgraded for free just as per our request to be on the same floor.
The service is superb the rooms are convenient, spacious and beautiful and the vibe is cool.
Location is the best!! ",5,2018,01,15
132,A treasure of a place,"Wonderful staff. Lighting and decor throughout hotel creates a mellow peaceful atmosphere. Excellent sound proofing throughout the hotel which was much appreciated when seeking a good night’s sleep.
This hotel is a central London gem",5,2018,01,15
132,Nice Comtemporary feel/ perfect location for entertainment & shoppers!,"We stayed 3 nights for New Year’s Eve weekend.
We were looking for central and lively hotel to enjoy shopping on Oxford Street.
It is exactly what you come for at Sanderson: walking distance from shopping streets and soho nightlife & entertainments!

Good points:
- contemporary design decor with lots of great design pieces in the Hall (loved the Lips sofa and the elevator like you are in space infinity :-))
- we arrived before eleven am and our room was already available!
- the hotel atmosphere is pretty young, lively and international due to Long Bar & renowned tea time
- rooms are really spacious as well as bathrooms (we had a superior  room located on 4th floor)
- gym is big, very well equiped and opened 24/24 for hotel guest 
- breakfast is excellent! With a lot of fresh and made to order options + buffet
- people are warm (except one bartender who would not make the effort of leaving from behind the bar to take our order.... ) and ready to help

Things that could be improved:
- we were asked if we need help with the luggages. I consider that at that level of hotel you should be helped and accompanied to your room systematically and not on demand...:-(
- not enough closet space (we could not find a spot to stock our empty luggage - there was a man-size closet but only 2 shelves/ some other space to put your things in the bathroom... not very convenient!)
- tea /coffee facilities only in demand (they bring a kettle only... great if u r a tea lover but not good for a coffee lover!)
- the spa was only equiped with steam room and no one to welcome you passed 6pm... so I got lost in the area :-(
- no possibilities to have a small bite in the middle of the afternoon if you haven’t booked for afternoon tea! Even as hotel guests, we were given no food nor table options despite seeing many tables available, then we met with lazy bartender....

SO perfect as a couple looking for nice atmosphere /young but no more that 2 nights and don’t expect much service or particular experience in the hotel",4,2018,01,11
132,A kettle and coffee and tea making facilities away from 100% perfect,"This is an unassuming hotel from the outside. But once inside its a different matter.  There are always doormen to let you in, but they do look like bouncers.  Not sure if the hotel has had trouble in the past, but nothing when we were there, even sitting in the bar at 11pm.  

The funky and very loud music at the reception desk and the galactic lifts with holographic star systems all add to the modern feel on the inside, all the way down the corridors and into the rooms all has the same modern feel. 

The room was uniquely laid out and had some different features such as dividing electric curtains and glass walls for the toilet and shower cubicle.  Lit cabinets all added to the feel. 

Bed was comfortable and the room nice and warm.  Quiet too, even in the middle of town.

Ideal for theatre goers and shoppers to the main streets alike.  

Every single person in this hotel is lovely from reception to breakfast. Lucile who served us at breakfast could not be any more attentive, she was lovely.  Even the chef said have a nice day!

The only one tiny criticism was that there were no facilities to make tea and coffee in the room. Shame. 

Drinks were expensive, but so is every hotel in London. 

Good job, we will most certainly stay here again when in town.",5,2018,01,11
132,Fab Central friendly Hip Hotel!,"Cool but not too cool!!

As usual great stay at this fab hotel. We used the brilliant Winter deal that they were running which offered a great discount.
Front of house staff are amazing, prior to visit sorting valet parking and whilst we were there. Phil and his team are great. Helpful, friendly but not intrusive. 

We didn't eat in the hotel this time as we were eating elsewhere but we did drink a lot in the bar!! 

Staying on a Sunday night meant it was quiet but we did get the Pool room and Purple bar to ourselves! Only a fleeting visit this time using the great offer available. 

We will be back again soon. Thanks guys.",5,2018,01,10
132,Still amazing!,"We returned to this hotel yesterday 6th January 2018, for a one night stay. We went to the pantomime at the Palladium as we did last year. From the moment we got out of the taxi to our leaving the stay was amazing! The staff were outstanding, so much so that we arrived early at 12 noon and we were given a complementary upgrade so we could go to our room and not have to wait. Thank you to the young man on reception, that was much appreciated. We went into the Purple Bar, which is for residents only after 11pm and the young lady on the bar remembered us from last year and even remembered what we drank! Now that is what you call service, but I very much think that the way you treat people can make a difference to the way they treat you!  The hotel is quirky, the food is exquisite, and the beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in. It is a different hotel, but so vibrant and a great place to stay whatever your age. Full marks from us again.",5,2018,01,07
132,Great experience,"Loved staying in this hotel very central and some great experiences from the spa to the mad hatters afternoon tea.

The purple bar was very cool for drinks and chilling.

Great location with Oxford street a 2 minute walk.",5,2018,01,07
132,Absolutely amazing!!,"I loved everything about this hotel! It was very unique and trendy. The room was lovely and so was the staff. First class bar, breakfast and restaurant! Ofcourse it’s not cheep but it’s worth every penny! I’ll be back:)
",5,2017,12,20
132,short but very sweet stay.,"I arrived early for check in and was greeted by a very friendly and welcoming gent on the reception desk. Incredibly efficient without being over the top. Advised my room was ready which was a bonus and gave a lovely overview of what i could expect.

Room product was very good, lovely big bed, bathroom was also fabulous.

Bar was lively, only a shame i didn't get to spend longer enjoying the room.

Nice one Sanderson and i have to say i through the room product was better than the Edition down the road, you cant swing a cat in their rooms.",5,2017,12,19
132,"lovely hotel, horrible staff","
Ok so to begin, I arrived at the hotel at 1pm, i'd just come off a very long flight from Hong Kong and had called ahead to ask if early check in, was possible I was staying in the Loft Terrace Suite room. 

The receptionist who checked me in, was lacking in any emotion and had a rude tone,  check in is quite an important part of the guest experience, its the first impression and the first impression I got was someone who didn't particularly want to check me in, and he made a sarcastic comment about the fact that I was paying for the hotel room and my deposit in cash, like it was an inconvenience and nuisance to him, if your hotel does not like to receive payment in cash then I would suggest you make it very clear on the website. He did not inform me of the amenities or give me any information whatsoever, which I again chalked up to him having a bad day and wanting to get me out of the way.

When I got to the room it was lovely, I ordered 3 drinks from room service, nothing came for 35 minutes, and then I got a call back asking to repeat the order, I then waited another 30 minutes for the drinks to arrive, an hour wait for three cocktails? really?

I then ordered 3 meals, which all came promptly but I was given normal fries instead of the sweet potato fries I had ordered, which was annoying as my friend is gluten free. 

The next morning I ordered room service, the food arrived and it was delicious, however moments later I the received a call from room service saying they needed to collect cash for my food. I said that I had paid a £200 deposit when I checked in and shouldn’t it just be deducted from that, I was informed that this was not the case and that they would be sending someone up to collect the cash, I informed them that I had drinks and a meal the night before and no one had collected money for this, so I'm just confused as to why it cant all be deducted from my £200 deposit. 

Never the less someone came up and collected the money for my breakfast but not everything else I'd had the night before which I found strange, I called the reception team to inform them of the situation and they say said I could pay for everything when I checked out, I would suggest that the room service and reception team communicate better about how they'd like to process charges for guests who pay cash deposits. 

Upon checking out I was met by same person who checked me in and once again and he was again rude and abrupt at this point I just wanted to leave, I informed him of the issue with room service he just ignored me entirely and continued typing on his computer, he then told me what my balance would be minus the room service fee, he didn't have money in his till so he asked me to wait whilst he sent someone else to collect it, he then continued to serve other guests it was at this point that I heard him ask a guest if they had anything from the mini bar, he had not asked me this, but the question jogged my memory and I remembered that I did, so when he got back to me as his colleague had brought my money,  I mentioned this so that I could make payment for the coke, the orange juice and the elderflower and pomegranate drink I’d had, he was irritated by this and told me I would have to wait as someone from the mini bar team would now need to check, 15 minutes later I had no update so I said to him that I’m positive of all that I had please can I make payment and leave an extra £20 just in case there is something extra. 

He became irritated  insinuated that I was lying about what I had and he needed to wait for confirmation, my blood was now boiling, 8 minutes later he received a phone call from the mini bar team to say there was also a small box of Pringles that needed to be added. 

He spoke to me condescendingly and said “ You failed to mention the Pringles” this was not done deliberately I forgot I had them and considering I’d just paid £742 for the room, £150 for room service food, and had quickly volunteered the information about the mini bar drinks I had taken, when he very nearly gave me back the remainder of my deposit without asking me about the mini bar, I find it extremely insulting to have him insinuate that I’m essentially a common thief who was going to run off without paying the extra £5 for the Pringles. 

I’d seriously suggest the hotel gets a mini bars installed that automatically charges when an item is removed, as if I had a flight or important meeting to go too, it would have been ridiculous to delay me  because someone needs to double check the mini bar.

All in all the hotel is beautiful but the quality of service is just not there at all, I think they need to hire front office staff who actually care about their guests and treat them with dignity and respect.",2,2017,12,17
132,Another great stay!,"Business travel is always tiresome, but I consistently find it delightful to stay at the Sanderson in London.  I'm well treated and the staff genuinely wants me to enjoy my stay.  Everyone is very friendly and on the rare occasion I request something they are very prompt and accommodating to ensure my needs are met.",5,2017,12,11
132,Amazing as always ,"Welcomed like a frequent visitor
Always a smile from all staff
Upgraded to suite for free
Room is always impeccably clean and staff always go that extra mile 
Obligatory photo on the sexy lip settee but never seem to win on the pool table, maybe it’s the cocktails that have that effect 
Not my first stay and won’t be my last stay either 
Look forward to staying with you again  ",5,2017,12,11
132,"Mixed review, one for older children. ","Stayed at the hotel with my kids (7&10). In hindsight I think they were too young for this hotel choice. Mad haters afternoon tea was great for the adults, a little to fancy in flavour for the kids. The hotel room was okay, but there was an interconnecting door that offered no sound protection from whichever guests were next door. So the kids were woken up by returning guests at 2am. Maybe when the kids are 16 plus we will come back, as we will probably have a better experience then. ",3,2017,12,11
132,Still my absolute favourite London hotel !,"The minute you walk into the entrance area you can feel the informal and totally different fun atmosphere the Sanderson offers you. But do not get me wrong, this place takes it very seriously to look after you properly.

Attentive check-in staff (if you get chance to talk about Australian cricket with Nigel you could be at reception for a long time............!) ahead of a ride in the slightly whacky lifts up to your room, always comfortable.

The best bit for me remains the Long Bar, particularly as Christmas approaches and it gets very busy. A great place to have your evening starter drink before going on somewhere else, or just staying in and enjoy.

I have been coming here pretty much since it opened and I always look forwards to coming back. Next Monday actually.

Give it a try, I doubt you will regret it.

132,"Cool Vibe, Great Location, Great Service","In the late 1990s and early 2000s, several hotel development groups, including Ian Schraeger, Morgans Hotels and others, made splashes with new urban retrofits that were hallmarks of all that personified what became a new contemporary aesthetic in the hotel business.  W and other “brands” built upon these examples and made the hotel business cool again.  But companies like Morgans laid the groundwork.

Having opened in 2000, the Sanderson London is a classic example of this type of Morgans hotel execution.  The bar is pushed right up to the front and makes the lobby a hot scene every evening.   Literally all details in the decor, down to the wall converings, elevator cabs, corridor lighting and art, is intended to say something.  And I like what ithey say!

The room product - we stayed in a Terrace Suite - is spacious for London and of course quite modern.  A trademark of Morgans back in the day, white floor to ceiling curtains, provide the aesthetic for demising sleeping, bath and dressing areas which all have wood flooring.  The wet area is surrounded by glass and has basically no shelving or storage as the aesthetic would have been impacted.  That being said, for a three night stay, we more than made due.

The food at the restaurant was very good,

But where the hotel truly stood out was at the front desk and the concierge desk.  Mikey, Neville and George will simply take care of everything.  Two examples:  1.  I ordered a bottle of champagne for the room as it was an anniversary trip. Upon arrival, we discovered the bed covered in yellow rose petals.  What a great touch that was!  2.  We were in four cities in ten days, including some formal dress, so we wanted to ship a bag back to the US before moving on to Paris.  George handled it so I only spent 10 minutes, he emailed me when it was picked up and the bag was sitting in my house when we arrived home.

We love London in general but love this location perhaps most.  Enjoy your time at the Sanderson!",5,2017,12,04
132,"The Sanderson Hotel, London.","What an incredible experience, we don't usually go for five star as it's too expensive, but having bee to the Sanderson I would not hesitate to re-book, the standard of service is second to none.

132,Sanderson - Flying Visit to London,"We stayed one night in the Sanderson and did not want to leave. The room was fantastic and the hotel staff were all amazing. Very personalised service and they had thought about everything to make our stay one of the best we have had. Would definitely recommend this hotel, it is in a great location just off Oxford street so easy to get to wherever you want to be.",5,2017,12,04
132,Loved it!,"This hotel is simply amazing! It has an incredible architecture, it is modern with a touch of old. The service is exquisite. We had a small problem and the staff went above and beyond to solve it. The restaurant is very good, very cool and very beautiful. The bedroom is very comfortable, good size, very good soundproof and curtains. The bathroom is huge, I only missed a bathtub. It is very close to Oxford St, and many subway stations. There are many cool and good restaurants very close by. It is a romantic hotel, but it is good to families and business travelers too, but not so good for kids. I loved the spa! One of the best I ever went, I super recommend going. There is a very cool pool table in the first floor, with is a very good place to take photos or having cocktails. The concierge is very good, they are helpful, and they have very good information.",5,2017,12,01
132,Nice rooms,"Very different style rooms (And I stay in a lot of hotels so have plenty to compare against).  Unfortunately there has been a billing problem which arose after I checked out and which the hotel has  basically, ignored.  Which has left rather a sour taste overall.",3,2017,12,01
132,A modern quirky hotel,We stayed here for 1 night while attending an event at the hotel. The hotel and rooms had a modern design. Our bed was big and comfortable and overall we had a great stay. We ate breakfast in the restaurant and had the mad hatter tea. The food was good at breakfast but service was slow. To be fair it was busy when we were there but still. Tea was excellent and definitely offered something different with the food. We found the service to be the best at the front door and valet. They were very welcoming and even gave us waters in our car for the drive when we left. This is not what you would expect of a typical 5 star hotel. If you want traditional don’t come here but if you’re looking for a different experience then it fits the bill. ,4,2017,11,27
132,Will return ,"Booked this for myself and my daughter, she loved the design and layout of the hotel and it really added to the treat if coming to London for a theatre trip. Loved our room, only iffy bit was being unable to get drinks when we returned after our night out due to a private party. We would stay here again. ",4,2017,11,26
132,Simply My Favourite Hotel,I was conducting business in London and stayed at this hotel for the second time in 18 months - it is simply my favourite.  The staff in the hotel are really fantastic and they have customer service values that many hotels can only dream of. This starts with the friendly door staff like Phil who is brilliant at making sure you are taken care of.  Breakfast was brilliant and one morning there was an issue with the Gas (no fault of the hotel) The staff dealt with it in a thoroughly professional manner.  The Manager (Edward) was brilliant at communicating what was going on and all staff in the restaurant went the extra mile to help people.  Later the manager left a handwritten note in my room apologising with a gift.  My wife and I also love the long bar and the fantastic drinks that they offer.  A brilliant way to spend an evening and even better if you are staying there.  We were also very well looked after by the brilliant Paris who made us very welcome; it felt like we were coming home.  Wonderful stay and we can't wait to go back again when we celebrate our sons 21st.,5,2017,11,21
132,Great staff.  Great hospitality. ,"Really great attention to making a great stay.  Very good stay for a week.  My room was extra large.  The bathroom needs rethinking.  Not too much shelf space and no room to put toiletries in the shower.  No place to put razor or shaving gel. Really not convenient.  Hotel overall is need of a refurbishment.  Staff in the breakfast restaurant was especially gracious.

132,Birthday lunch,"My son treated me to lunch in the restaurant at The Sanderson, the staff were very welcoming, not at all snobby, and our waiter Gaby was the best !

132,Birthday weekend joy,"The Sanderson holds a special place for my wife and I as it was the first hotel that I took her to in order to try and impress her as a new girlfriend some 15 years ago! Whilst we are a little old for the long bar late on a Friday night nowadays it's still such a fab place to go and the staff attention to detail is like nowhere else in the World and I stay at a lot of hotels. 

Anyway thanks to the lovely management and long bar staff for making the trip so memorable once again. Most definitely a 5 star experience at any age plus wonderful breakfast ;)",5,2017,11,18
132,Always an amazing and unique experience,"This is my 5th stay in the Sanderson in three years. It's always interesting, the staff continues to quietly excel, and I always feel welcome. This trip I recommended the Sanderson to 8 of my co-workers; we all had a very good experience at the hotel.

I've written about the Sanderson before, so I thought I would write something a little different this time. Understanding what the Sanderson is, and isn't, is difficult until you've stayed there at least once.

The typical Hilton, Marriott and similar properties, no matter the ""tier"" are like a Camry, or a BMW, or even a Range Rover. They will efficiently deliver a quality experience, with efficiency and effectiveness. A hotel room that meets your needs, it gets you where you're going, not excessively stylishly, not too far from the mainstream, and everything will be exactly as you expect. TVs will be where you expect, the bath will be pretty much the same as any other, maybe the fixtures are a little different, but the lamps are all the same, beds are all like all other beds. Nicer or not, but still the same.

At the other end of the spectrum are the Four Seasons, Mandarin Orientals, etc. Think Ferrari, Lamborghini. Here you're getting the ultimate experience, flashy, often over the top, sometimes impractical, perhaps excessive for some. Sometimes style over function, and more important to be noticed for itself than to serve your needs. It's the Italian jet-set.

The Sanderson is not middle of the road by any means. It's an upscale, unique, classic yet hip experience. Think classic Jaguar or James Bond's original Aston-Martin. It's going to turn heads as it gets you from A to B, the experience is stylish, tasteful and totally satisfying. But you're going to have to work with it a bit, and none of the switches are going to be exactly where you expect them, and everything is going to work just a little bit different than you expect. You're going to be amused and delighted as you experience the room layouts, the large free-standing tubs, the often huge sleigh-style beds, the glass and curtain separator interior walls. Out of the ordinary, always.

And the Sanderson staff are always unobtrusively just nearby in case you need something.

I have to admit that my experience this trip was not 100% perfect. There was the McLaren and Ferrari that raced down the street near midnight on a Saturday night. There was a minor problem with some damaged laundry. The first was beyond the hotel's control (Fitzrovia has many exotic car aficionados), and the second was completely handled and exceeded my expectations within a matter of hours.

For the true Sanderson experience, try London Fashion Week :-) But that's a review for another time.",5,2017,11,17
132,Shame about the rooms,"Now Im assuming paying extra for a superior room No 131 means its one of their better rooms and that was confirmed by their front desk.  Whoever designed this room needs taking out into Oxford street and left in the middle of the road. A more soul less room is hard to imagine. If you are of the mind to you can stare extremely large blank artless walls or sit on the eight foot long boxy looking sofa without a single cushion and its sooo dark. Other than the rooms which as you can see are minimalist, in other words  sparce the bar, restaurants and common areas seem more interesting.",3,2017,11,17
132,November in London,"My wife and I always stay at the Sanderson when we are in London. The hotel has a great location. There are several tube stations close by. And, when crossrail is fully operaional it will be a 30 minute ride to and from Heathrow airport. The hotel has a great staff that are very friendly and helpful. It is well worth checking out the Sanderson in you have never stayed there.",5,2017,11,16
132,good location,I really loved my stay at the sanderson. It was conveniently located to my meetings in the business center. The subway was a short walk away and a lot of nice building to look around. The rooms are really cute and they do a really good job of recommending a curated list of places nearby to check out. I'd definitely stay here again.,4,2017,11,13
132,Lovely stay :),"Booked this for my 60th Birthday- the hotel is well located near Oxford Street but in a quiet side road. We were not disappointed it was really comfortable but with a modern and unique vibe and great decor - they honoured the ‘up grade ‘ so I got a bath and our room was comfortable well appointed. 
We had drinks in the purple bar before heading out for dinner.
Breakfast was excellent Courtney fault it :) Really enjoyed the whole experience - one tiny niggle - although our room was clearly a non-smoking room it was evident that someone had been smoking in there previously - I think housekeeping should have picked up on this - we didn’t not mention this until checking out as it did not spoil our stay but I wanted to point this out so it could be rectified.",5,2017,11,12
132,Great hotel in a great lication,"We have stayed here on numerous occasions, and it is a great hotel in a brilliant location.  The staff are knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.  The décor is quirky and fun.

The Long Bar and Purple Bar are great places to have a drink, both have a different vibe, and they offer a superb range of drinks.

The standard room is well proportioned in size and the amenities are excellent.  But, in this day and age, what 5* hotel doesn't provide coffee and tea making facilities in all its rooms?  As far as we are concerned coffee/tea (preferably a pod machine like many hotels that are 4* and 5*) making facilities in the room are essential.

This is a great hotel but we think they are missing a trick - which is why they only get 4* on this review.",4,2017,11,11
132,Wonderful hospitality ,"I always stay this hotel because it is very clean, all stuff are so friendly. Meal quality is so good. I love lunch time at this hotel. Location is also very good, it is located central. Highly recommended!",5,2017,11,10
132,Perfect location in the heart of London,"From check in to check out we had a most wonderful stay here, helped by all staff we encountered. Friendly, efficient and professional at all times with nothing too much, particularly our breakfast waitress who was exceptional. The hotel has an eccentric, stylish feel but remains totally functional whilst looking great. The initially minimalist room works extremely well, the bathroom in particular is an oasis of calm and the complimentary Malin + Goetz products were very much appreciated. Only one negative point - the windows at the front of the hotel are not soundproof double glazed, only secondary glazed due to the historic nature of the building which means you get to hear excited restaurant/bar guests leaving in the small hours. Otherwise, an experience worth repeating on a regular basis - a great hotel.",5,2017,11,10
132,consistently classy,"Stayed here a few times. Sure its a little voguey and trendy but still has the best fun hotel bar in london ,fabulous rooms and a great almost miami uber cool feel to it . Was a great stay that ran through until about 3 am in the bar with some real characters .its one on its own i feel and still at the top of its game",5,2017,11,09
132,My Birthday Weekend,"I stayed in the loft suite with terrace from Fri 3 Nov - Sun 5 Nov for my bday and from the front Doormen & check in until check out I can say it has been completely amazing. The hotel staff incl. housekeeping and bar staff are very accommodating, friendly and extremely helpful. I had a problem with our room heating and went to reception to enquire about it and by time i had got bk in the lift and to my room the maintenance man had taken a look at the problem and was exiting our room. 

The room itself is stunning, very minimal,clean and comfortable. We were left a note and a gift from the staff in the room which was a lovely touch. I had a few friends to the room to enjoy the terrace and the space was perfect for hosting! Minor negatives, the lounge chair has legs that curve outwards and my friend and I must have stubbed our toes numerous times....Unfortunately the electric curtain didnt work in our room, the light switches take a little while to get used to and our next door neighbours did connect the bluetooth for our speaker and end up playing their music for a bit,  but that didnt matter as everything else is pretty much on point even if its not how you expect a hotel room to be laid out....Be aware that for toilet and shower room it is frosted glass so you can still see the outline of the person inside.

The hotel bar was lively and there is a separate room with pool table and an extra bar for guests only. There is a spa area but I didn't manage to use it.

If you are looking for a hotel that gives great service throughout, and a room to match then definately pick this hotel. If anyone else wants more detail from me just drop a message and ill try to answer. 

Thank you Sanderson Hotel, the best stay I've had in London!

132,Birthday weekend,"Amazing hotel. Absolutely loved the place. Standard room was immaculate. Bar was buzzing and beautiful, the bar staff were friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend. Location fantastic. Can't fault.! Loved all the furniture",5,2017,10,28
132,"Very nice hotel, perfect location","Nothing special from the outside, but the inside of the hotel looks great. Stylish furniture, an almost mysterious looking lobby and a large bar with a nice little garden is situated on the ground floor. Our room was not very spacious but large enough for our 5 day stay. The design of the room was modern with some very nice touches like how the bad and bath furniture is placed in the room. Also the services (free phone to take with you, turndown service) and the staff was very nice and helpful. The location is perfect, 2 min walk to Oxford Street and some more minutes to Tottenham Court Road that takes you anywhere by tube.",5,2017,10,20
132,Another great stay.,This hotel must be one of the best in London. Central for shopping and theatres. The staff are all friendly and knowledgeable and great all guests like old friends. The rooms are beautifully appointed and you are guaranteed a good nights sleep. ,5,2017,10,20
132,Great spot and fantastic hotel ,Lovely hotel- oozes creativity and style.  Service was excellent from start to finish.  Rooms big and very modern.  Loved it there.  Will be back for sure.  Bars and restaurants very nice too.  Very contemporary and modern.  ,5,2017,10,17
132,Pricey but fab!,"We upgraded to a loft suite which was really big, loads of space, I thought good value. Lovely bathroom with malin & goetz products. It's such a well located hotel for the West End and we had drinks in the Long Bar early evening, which has a slightly older crowd (Friday night, 40s).  The staff were super friendly (particularly concierge Michael).  Thoroughly recommend this 5* for a central London stay.",5,2017,10,14
132,ONCE AGAIN AMAZING!,"I had not been to London for a while so was excited to head there for the weekend and stay in my favourite hotel The Sanderson. 

From the minute you are welcomed by the door staff, then the scent of the Lobby, then the welcome received at reception you know you are in a special place.  

The location is perfect for shopping and nightlife and the breakfast is the best you will get in any hotel with once again a first class service.  I cannot imagine staying anywhere else in London as this place just feels like home!",5,2017,10,03
132,Great place,"This is a really great hotel perfectly located for walking to Oxford Street shopping, Soho or even a longer stroll to marble arch etc.    Staff are great and the rooms are light and airy - a stark difference from most of the standard dark and dingy London offerings.   It also has an excellent gym - probably one of the best equipped I have encountered with everything you might need from a casual treadmill to serious heavy lifting regimes.  ",5,2017,10,02
132,Modern rooms let down by very noisy bar and courtyard. ,"The room was very modern with a lovely large bed (a superior room type I believe). Not the biggest room though (so standard and deluxe must be tiny)

The biggest problem was the noise. Well into the night all you could hear was the rowdy courtyard bar downstairs (music, thumping base and people). It was like staying at a student hostel. We were then woke up at 3am and 5 am by people shouting and screaming in the corridors. 

Wouldn’t recommend staying if you value a good nights sleep , especially at the weekend. Much better places to stay for the money. 

Also note the lack of a bath and you will need to ring service if you want an iron and ironing board. 

",2,2017,10,01
132,A very cool spot to have fun!,"This hotel like all other Morgan Hotels does not disappoint! 

It's cool and funky while still being tactful and giving you the sense of ease all the while you still are very aware that you are definitely on a break!

The rooms are a little small but very clean & cosy and always really great beds! 
The staff are great I left my laptop behind and I was given a lend of one of theirs for several hours ... somewhat unheard of!
The bar is cool offering cocktails great wine & beers! 
It's a great place to go have some fun with your friends or the chance to just stay in a seriously nice hotel! 
Loved it! ",4,2017,09,30
132,Sanderson,"One of the most amazing places to stay when in London!
This was our 10th stay and the staff were so extremely attentive, that this was the most memorable stay yet! We had gotten an upgrade on our room and a complimentary bottle of champagne sent up to our room. So nice!
The breakfast is one of the best you can find in London as well.",5,2017,09,26
132,Fantastic hotel.,"The staff here are so helpful and pleasant. Purple bar is particularly good. Marta makes the best Cocktails. Ifty, CJ and Alessandro are really helpful. Highly recommended for a stay in Central London. The style is quite quirky. Really comfortable beds.",5,2017,09,25
132,One of London's Bests,"great cocktail bar, young stylish crowd, hot bartenders, great restaurant food, responsive manager always in eyeline
Vibrant colours on classic furniture and an engagingly fabulous astronomic elevator that takes you to the stars just before bed - you'll see what i mean! xXx i will always return for more! :P",5,2017,09,25
132,Gem of a hotel !,"We had booked a standard room, however my husband had advised them it was my birthday. We had been to the theatre and checked in late . Big shout out to Adrian who was not only charming ; upgraded us to a loft suite. Our room was just amazing, huge amount of space for a hotel just off Oxford street. The room is dominated by a huge bed that was exceptionally comfortable. My only gripe is that they need to put somewhere in the shower room for soap / shampoo etc. This is a very trendy hotel, if you have teenagers book in here; they will thank you.",5,2017,09,24
132,Brilliant,"Spent a great weekend at the Sanderson recently. Fantastic location at the heart of the Oxford Street area and  ideal for walking. If walking sounds a little energetic, the doormen will magic up a taxi seemingly out of the ether. 
Rooms are well appointed and spotlessly clean, internet access via the smart phone provided in each room is a nice touch. 
Food and drink really was first rate. Mad hatter's afternoon tea is almost a must do, breakfast's are brilliant.
But the stand out aspect of the Hotel are undoubtedly the staff. Friendly, helpful and accommodating at every turn. 
Probably the friendliest Hotel in London.
  
",5,2017,09,19
132,"Excellent hotel, excellent staff, excellent everything!","I love the Sanderson - there is nowhere else in London I would rather stay. Not my first visit and won't be my last. The location is fantastic, really central, and the hotel is so clean, contemporary and calming - it is an absolute pleasure to stay in...one of the few places I find I can always relax. The rooms are so comfortable with enormous beds and huge modern bathrooms. The spa is fantastic - absolutely heavenly. The breakfasts are the best I've ever had in a hotel and so much choice. I've come here with family, with friends and for work and I have never been disappointed. Biken Urkiri is an amazing concierge and his incredible customer service would be reason enough for me to return again and again. Absolutely fabulous, highly recommended.",5,2017,09,19
132,"Nice hotel, nice room, but no coffee...","We were impressed by the helpful staff and overall décor of this hotel. Outside it looks like a 1960s office block but inside it really lives up to it's boutique hotel pedigree with plenty of quirky furniture, subdued lighting and interesting people. We felt about 30 years too old for the bar but can forgive that as we aren't the target demographic. Our standard room was packed with nice little extras but sadly lacked a coffee maker. A kettle would look out of place in such a chic establishment, but what about an espresso maker to feed my caffeine urges?",4,2017,09,18
132,Daddy and me,"I took my 2.5 year old son to a London trip and we stayed at Sanderson, Hotel is very well located to walking or driving distance to many historical monuments and museums and very nice property. What made our one week stay special was the staff's attentiveness to help and detail during our stay. We were greeted by the Bell man Jose who is the epitomizes the hospitality of the Sanderson. He checked us in to our room and showed us all the alternatives _ because we were frightened by reading all the horror stories here at trip advisor. I sometimes think people are expecting too much from a hotel room, it is London and it is a Hotel room and you are not buying it people. I and my 2.5year old son were super happy that our room met our expectations and served us well, it was kept immaculately clean and our closet was organized for us by the cleaning crew. Breakfast is a sumptuous buffet and a la cart menu has amazing choices, Gabby is an amazing server and breakfast is never a hassle, furthermore the hotel is surrounded with hip and eclectic restaurants to meet everyone's taste. Concierge Allessandro arranged us to rent a car with no worry or trouble for us which was delivered for us to drive out to Highclere Castle ( Downton Abbey) and we had a great time there and no issue parking and returning the rental back. Several nights we needed a nanny and Allesandro arranged a lovely nanny and there was no issue there. Overall for the money we spent we got an amazing return of fun, comfort and serenity form the hotel, Yes Friday and Saturday nights there is a crowd in the hotel but it did not bother us as the crowds is never spilling over to bother the hotel guests they are Londoners or visitors having fun. Overall I give a resounding A + for our stay",5,2017,09,17
132,New favourite hotel in London. Amazing stay!,"Really wonderful weekend to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary. We booked the True Romance package and were upgraded to a stunning Loft Suite, with chilled champagne on arrival. Everyone from start to finish was so friendly and helpful. In the evening, we had the Tipsy Evening Tea which was brilliant; even more fun than the Afternoon Tea. Staff couldn't have been more helpful or accommodating of our dietary requirements and we had a lovely evening meal. 
We chose to eat breakfast in the restaurant (although we had room service included in our package) and had beautiful food, with eggs perfectly cooked. 
I then had a wonderful massage in the Agua Spa while my husband relaxed in our suite. 
This is now my favourite hotel in London. We will definitely be back! ",5,2017,09,17
132,Cocktail Hour,"On a visit to London recently we stopped off at the Sanderson Hotel for a cocktail, and we were not disappointed. The bar staff were very polite and the cocktails were excellent. 
Although we were not eating their looking at the restaurant and the menu we will definitely be going back to try it out.",4,2017,09,17
132,Cool unique hotel in central location ,"This is a very unique place and I'm sure many guests love this hotel for that. I enjoyed staying here too and particularly thought the garden was very cute. The location is good too: a bit off from the main streets but still central and you can walk to a lot of places from there. They also serve a very nice breakfast and the staff here was super friendly and very helpful. It's a very cool hotel but personally I would have preferred a bit more practical room set up, also in terms of lights, mirrors etc. Overall it felt like the hotel (and rooms) are a bit dark. ",3,2017,09,17
132,Top Top Top,"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. 
I travel a lot, about once or twice a month. It is rare to find hotel that has 3 tops. 
Top for Maintanace 
Top for design and comfort 
Top for service (exceptional!!!!)

Rooms are big, clean and well designed for maximum comfort and calmness. 
Location- best in London. Center of everything!!!

Now a word for the service- these guys will go out of their skin to help a guest!!!
Here is just one example- one day I needed a taxi since uber was not responding. Asked the doorman for assistance. The guy literally run to Oxford street, caught a taxi and run back around the block (it's a one way) to direct the taxi!!!!
I guess he could have jumped in and direct the taxi by sitting inside but hey!!! I was impressed!!!!!!
So Sanderson hotel, you are my favorite in London, I will be back for sure:))
",5,2017,09,15
132,Sanderson exceeds service expectations!,"I had multiple issues such as my room not being ready and my room service being incredibly late one day, however what I remember is how the amazing staff handled these issues.  The room situation -- they walked me down to the spa and let me use all the facilities, which was very refreshing.  Late room service -- they comped my meal and I received a bottle of champagne in my room later that day with a hand written note apologizing again!  

The service industry is by far lacking generally, so I was most surprised and delighted to receive such wonderful and personalized service during my stay.  Will for sure stay again!",4,2017,09,11
132,Different in a good way,"You expect a five star hotel to be good and this one is.  What often lets them down is the sheer cost- that they don't offer good value.  Money no object? Who cares if it's not perfect. But if money does matter the niggles are amplified by the price.

It's for this reason that my reviews sometimes appear generous for basic hotels- many reviewers appear to forget that if they paid £42.50 for a night in central London they can't expect perfection.

The reverse is true too.  And so for me this is a four out of five place.

Niggles: 
Check in was slow- the person dealing with me was obviously new. He was struggling with something but then he just disappeared, without a word, and was replaced a minute later by someone else.

I was given a free drink (cocktail) voucher which was nice.  But meeting others in my group later found that all the 'attractive' women were given two!  Our 'older' HR lady only got one as well...

Breakfast service was slow.

The room had loads of products for sale in it- not just the robes but a candle, shampoo, perfume. Why?

The good bits:
The bar is great and the bar staff likewise.

Everyone is polite and helpful.

The guest rooms are incredibly calming spaces- I got a great night's sleep.

If you're lucky you can actually get some ok deals. ",4,2017,09,10
132,Nice hotel,"I stayed at the Sanderson during a business trip. The hotel is very good and trendy. Room are of decent size for London.
Gaby at the breakfast is great and make you feel very welcome. Sometimes it may take a little too long to receive your coffee at breakfast, not quite sure why.",4,2017,09,10
132,Very helpful staff.  Best mattress ever!,"Gaby made me feel so welcome every morning by making me American coffee in the dining area!! My room had the best mattress I've ever slept on!!

The decor is a little too cool for my taste but it made for interesting discussions.

I enjoyed the gym every morning and it was well equipped!",4,2017,09,07
132,Excellent service and attention to detail - Beautiful hotel!,"Wow - what can I say about this hotel. I booked this as a surprise for my boyfriends birthday and we had the most amazing time. 
A week before my visit I received an email to upgrade my room and it was worth it. It included a larger bed, more space in the room and a bath in the bathroom. The wall separating the bathroom and the bedroom was completely glass (including the shower) which was stunning. The only downfall was that the bath was so big it took ages to fill up! 
The best thing about the hotel though was the service. I arrived before my check in time to ask if they could leave a birthday cake in the room for when we arrived later on as it was a surprise birthday treat. Not only did they leave the cake in the room, they had put rose petals on the bed, a bottle of champagne and a birthday cake from them. It was just amazing the detail they had put it and my boyfriend was very happy. 
The room was also slightly cold when we arrived and couldn't work the aircon/heating. We called up reception and within 5 minutes an engineer was in the room showing us how to work it. 
We couldn't fault the hotel and the service!
Worth the treat for a special occasion.",5,2017,09,07
132,Stylish Hotel in great area,"The Sanderson is stylish, fun and in a great location. There are lots of restaurants, bars and shopping within walking distance. The Tube is a 5-min walk away. The hotel has a great gym and spa, and the vibe in the bar and restaurant of the bar are fun. Room service is great as well. In each room there is a phone that you can use and take with you on your days exploring London, which is super helpful. Free wifi. very nice staff. I'd recommend this hotel.

The only minimal downside is that the rooms (at least my room, which was a standard room) are super minimal, which is stylish but not always practical. There is a curtain sectioning off the bathroom, so there isn't much of a sound barrier. The room is a bit dark, and the hallways and elevators are quite dark. There aren't any shelves in the shower to put your toiletries, or hang a wash cloth or towel. None of these things are deal breakers, just a little annoying.",5,2017,09,05
132,Definitely a Mad Hatter's Tipsy Evening Tea,"I have previously been for the Afternoon tea and fell in love with it. So I decided to try the Mad Hatter's Tipsy evening Tea with one of my friends.

And we couldn't have chosen a better way to end our evening!

We were welcomed by the Cocktail flight (Mini Kir Royale, White wine and red fruit punch, Kamm & Sons ginseng with orange and elderflower tonic water and Buckfast and Coquelicot liqueur mini martini), and since both of us had an empty stomach (Except for a coffee each round about 3 o'clock... and it was 7 o'clock by the time we were there), we thought it was probably best to wait until the actual tea came.
And Sanderson NEVER disappoints.

We first filled our stomach with the savoury: Smoked salmon Scotch quails egg with caviar and cream cheese, ham and parmesan croque-monsieur (""Stack of King of Hearts""), Caramelised Cornish crab bridge roll, baby quiche (""White Rabbits heirloom garden quiche""), savoury scones with whole seed mustard and mozzarella. It came with served with herb butter which was absolutely beautiful.

Then onto the sweet/dessert (Because they belong to a separate stomach of course), The top level was White chocolate Pear Williams truffle and the ""Wonderland"" marshmallow in little magic mushrooms design. The bottom level was Dark chocolate and rum gateau (the detail of the chessboard is mesmerising), lemon and Limoncello curd financier (apparently, Tweedle Dee's favourite) and of course, macaroons that are shaped in little ""drink me"" potion bottoms (orange and Cointreau)

We had such a brilliant time and would totally recommend to those who LOVES alcoholic drinks AND evening tea.
I would also like to thank the staffs, they are amazing and they know how to entertain the customers!",5,2017,09,05
132,Fantastic 20th Wedding Anniversary Break at this fab hotel!,"We have just returned from a couple of days stay at this fabulous hotel and have to say that from the minute we arrived we were made to feel extremely welcome and special.  We pulled up outside The Sanderson to be greeted by the most lovely Bell Boy who quickly attended to us and while my husband went through a few details regarding the car I was taken to reception chatting with a delightful lady and then checked in by Ruth who again was wonderful in every way.  Room was great, a double and had everything we needed although I do agree with some comments where tea and coffee in the room is always quite welcome although water was provided.  Having had a wander around London we returned to the hotel and just settling in to a little rest before supper when we were welcomed with a surprise bottle of champagne and beautiful cake with Happy Anniversary, this absolutely made our stay so a really special thank you to Ruth who had organised this for us :)

We later had a drink in the bar before heading to Berners Tavern for Supper (this is across the road and about 2 minutes walk) we would again highly recommend, although do watch the wine list is a little on the pricey side!

The Long Bar at The Sanderson  is a great place to have a drink and would love to bring our son to try the Mad Hatters afternoon tea outside in the Terrace, we saw some people having this and it looked fabulous, so thats for next time!

Beds were the most comfortable we have slept in outside of our own beds, I generally can never sleep while away and I managed to have the best nights sleep here, the air conditioning was also fab too!

The following day we took some bikes out for a ride around Regents Park, which the concierge kindly organised for us and this was great fun too. We were very sad to leave and didn't want our stay to end but luckily we have promised our son that we will take him to stay so we will be back.  We checked out with the equally charming Nigel at the front desk and will summarise by saying if you want super friendly staff who go out of there way to look after you and a super comfortable nights sleep in a great location then this hotel certainly ticks all the boxes :)",5,2017,09,04
132,Trendy but dingy..,"We stayed in a double double room for one night and overall were pretty disappointed. First the good points - The staff were all very helpful and friendly.  The long bar and the courtyard restaurant are extremely popular and buzzing - clientele very much a 20s to 40s age range.    Unfortunately the rest of the hotel - rooms, stairs, lifts, corridors, Purple Bar needs  better lighting - they all seems very dark and gloomy.  Toilets in the public area are very basic - not at all appealing. Later in the evening there was music in the bars but it was so loud we had to leave.

Our room - a double double - had no bath shower only.  Toiletries are good quality and bathrobes slippers are provided.   The room was very gloomy - very little natural light and hardly any lighting in the main room.  We had to shine a bedside light into the mirror to do make up.   You have to ask for tea and coffee facilities to be provided in your room.  The beds were large and comfortable but we had to rearrange furniture to make sure we could get to the bathroom without tripping up.  

Bar prices are high £12.25 for a single basic G&T.  We did not eat in since the restaurant does not start until 6.00pm somewhat late for pre theatre dining. All in all I was pretty disappointed considering the price - have stayed in better places in Central London for much less money . Sorry - won't stay here again.",3,2017,09,03
132,One of the best hotel in London,"Thank you sanderson hotel for everything, i had the best stay ever, staff was very friendly and helpful,room is clean and spacial as expected, we've got a nice welcome surprise, the spa was wonderful, we recommend this hotel for couples who wants to enjoy a special time. ",5,2017,09,03
132,Fab overnight stay.,"We stayed last night and had the most fantastic loft terrace room with brilliant views of the London skyline. Every member of staff was pleasant, courteous and nothing was too much trouble. I highly recommend this hotel and Grant the Hotel Manager is to be applauded for the high levels attained here.",5,2017,08,31
132,Worst night sleep in a hotel,"In it's day, it was certainly was one of the hippest hotels in London, serving the crowds you would expect. Whilst now not as fresh, the design is still impressive and we liked it. The rooms were also design led, which doesn't always translate to comfortable and welcoming. That said, they suited us. The welcome was warm and friendly, especially by the door staff/'bell boy'. Our rooms were ready, despite arriving at noon.

We had a drink in the bar, where I had an 'averagely' made cocktail. As it was a Sunday night, it was relatively quiet.

Our room was on the first floor, and I was woken up regularly by people in the corridor - I suspect this were the 'guests' in the room where the door was ajar for the entire evening - we guessed what this might mean, but impossible to be sure. After the corridor noise stopped, I was woken at around 5 by staff in the courtyard having a catch up and moving what sounded like chairs being dragged - this general noise  continued for a while until I admitted defeat and got up for breakfast.

Breakfast was really good, and the children were well looked after.

Checkout was transactional, and I was never asked if our stay was pleasant, ok, good or enjoyable - I was presented with my bill, I paid and that was it.

We visit London a few times a year, despite only living an hour away, but sadly this was disappointing. We are about to book our February trip, and my wife wants to try The Mondrian - I'm not sure if form wins over function as it seems to at The Sanderson.

132,Fabulous hotel...will be back!,"What a fabulous hotel! We upgraded to a king deluxe which was truly lovely, spacious, beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. Huge comfy bed, lovely bathroom and all in a brilliant location. Oh and the staff are the best too. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome, which in a trendy London hotel is not always the case. Everyone was attentive, friendly and helped to make sure my husband had a wonderful 40th birthday! (The champagne and b'day cake were a classy touch...thank you Paris 😊).All in all would thoroughly recommend and will absolutely be back again!",5,2017,08,29
132,We loved it...,"We had a fab stay at the Sanderson - room was great, well equipped and very comfortable. Bar was funky. Breakfast was relaxed, high quality with great service. Something different but very special. Recommended.",5,2017,08,29
132,Funky hotel in a great location ,"The service is very good. We upgraded to a deluxe room which was larger and has a comfy king sized sleigh bed and spacious bathroom with free standing bath. We did have a view of the courtyard but is was a bit limited due to the wide window sills. 
The purple bar is funky and does good cocktails. Spa treatments are good although it would be great to have a pool of some description rather than just a single sex steam room. 
The hotel location is fantastic for the west end. ",4,2017,08,27
132,Wow,"From the outside it didn't look like much but I was pleasantly amazed when I walked through the doors into the stunning lobby. 
Staff were very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble particularly CJ who went above and beyond. 
We were upgraded to a deluxe double room on the 1st floor and it was stunning. We loved the room and the bed was so comfortable! 
We enjoyed drinks at the main bar and the bar staff were great. Making us coctails which were not on the drinks menu that suited our taste perfectly. 
Overall we had a great stay and we would definatly go back ! ",5,2017,08,27
132,Wedding Anniversary Celebration,"From the moment we arrived at Sanderson we were made to feel so welcome. As it was our wedding anniversary we were treated to a wonderful room upgrade, free cocktails and a surprise bottle of champagne and cake in our room! Paris, Shaun and Jose looked after us so well and really went the extra mile to ensure that we had a great stay. We even returned to our room later that evening to find rose petals scattered on the sheets! A lovely hotel with an energetic vibe and really friendly staff. This wasn't our first visit to Sanderson and it certainly won't be the last. A firm favourite.",5,2017,08,21
132,Mad Hatters afternoon tea,"A different take on the afternoon tea with the crockery, sandwiches, cakes named after the Alice story.  The menu was in an old book, very clever, and how did they get the different layers in the drink me bottle?!  A lovely setting.",5,2017,08,17
132,Outstanding Hotel,"Booked the Sanderson for a one night stay for our daughter's first birthday. The hotel was very accommodating providing a cot that was nicely set up in the room. 

The room itself was very quirky and surprisingly had a decent amount of room for a London hotel. The location of the hotel was great, plenty of nice restaurants nearby and shops easily accessible.

The staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful and seemed more than welcoming, especially towards our daughter.

Breakfast has to be one of the best I have ever had in a UK hotel. Excellent variety and quality.

I wish we could have stayed longer. Great hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to return or recommend.",5,2017,08,16
132,Better than expected!!!,"Good Points:

- The Receptionist were EXTREMELY friendly and welcoming. Always smiling.
- We were asked if it was an occasion, I confirmed it was our anniversary and without even asking we were upgraded to a better room and welcomed to a bottle of champagne on the house!!! They went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable.
- Interior is amazing - but most importantly - the lifts are mesmerising! 
- Spa was amazing - Matt (who did my facial - 5* - I would 100% come back to you)
- Location was great - only a couple of minutes from oxford circus
- The Long bar was great for cocktails (although quite expensive) and at night it was very busy with a DJ - but we were unable to hear it from our room which was nice. 

Room for Improvement:

- Cost for breakfast - 2 x Eggs benedict, 2 latte and an orange juice was just over £50! Kind of to be expected but still expensive. 
- The room service come up on a trolley - small point but would have been better on trays so we could eat in bed!
- Considering it was an upgrade, the room was still quite small. No where to put our cases apart from on the floor.

Cant thank you enough for your hospitality - would 100% stay again!",5,2017,08,14
132,"Shopping, cocktails & sleep","Fantastic welcome at check in, made use of valet parking very friendly & efficient. Great service & cocktails in both bars. Super comfy beds. Looking forward to next visit Mad Hatter afternoon tea with my niece. ",5,2017,08,13
132,OMG! What an experience!,"A very nice birthday surprise! The lobby is very Andy Warhol(ish) and so is the purple bar room, pool room and lifts! The two ladies on reception were fun and extremely welcoming! In fact, all the staff were very helpful and polite. Had cocktails and a burger served at the Long Bar, and then cocktails of an evening in the purple bar. The cocktail staff know their drinks - their drink recommendations were spot on. Stayed in a terrace room on 6th floor. Absolutely fantastic! So clean and light. Massive bed, massive bathroom with his and her sinks, walk in shower, and bath tub. Sound system in the room which you can sync with your smartphone.  Approx 32"" TV fixed on wall bracket can be moved to allow viewing around most of the room. The secluded terrace itself was great. Overlooking the front of the hotel - with the sun in the morning. Didn't use gym or spa facilities. The hotel seems very popular during the day for Mad Hatters afternoon tea - popular with families, ladies only groups and couples, and then very busy at night attracting mostly adults only. Paid extra for late check out at 12 midday. Ordered breakfast to room - very good selection of continental, vegan, full English amongst others. I would recommend this hotel. ",5,2017,08,13
132,Elegant but not stuffy,"I stayed here with my wife for a brief getaway over the weekend and it didn't disappoint. Set off the main Oxford Street from the outside it doesn't look overly impressive but wait till you get in. It is a different world of modern but relaxing styles with staff who simply cannot do enough to be helpful. 

The Longbar is incredible and was a great way to sit back and enjoy a cosmopolitan end to the day, the bar staff are extremely efficient and friendly with no waiting to be served. The room and bathroom were spotless with a comfortable bed and no street noise disturbing your sleep.

It's central location and first rate facilities make it quite expensive but now and again it's nice to splash out and this place won't leave you regretting the spend!

Definitely would stay again!",5,2017,08,13
132,Excellent stay in London,"Despite a dreadful check-in and a usually long wait for our room, the experience at Sanderson has been very good. The room is upscale and nicely furnished and very comfortable. Housekeeping very efficient and attentive. The busy hotel is well situated in central London and surrounding neighborhood fantastic. 
I would stay here again.
",4,2017,08,13
132,Friendly reception. Fun atmosphere ,"Stayed for just one night, wish it had been more. From the doorman to the front desk first impressions set the right note. Very friendly and upbeat greeting even though I was checking In at 10pm at night. Loved the big red lip couch at the entrance. 

Room was great but as some of the other guests pointed out the bathroom mirror position is awkward and overall functionality has bee sacrificed for the funky look and feel in the shower area too where balancing your soap takes some doing. 

Useful tip which I'm Calling out is that the tea and coffee equipment is not provided in room unless you ask for it. So do remember to request for your caffeine fix at the time of checking in. 

Food was good at the restaurant had a steak for dinner with garden fresh greens which were really fresh and juicy. Breakfast too was fine. However i found the service in the restaurant a tad slow and difficult to make eye contact with the waiters when one wanted something. Nothing to complain about but noticeable in the difference between staff engagement I experienced in other parts of the hotel. 

I was under the impression that they did not have smiling rooms but found out from signage in the room that they do have a smoking floor. So if you are looking for a smoking room do make sure to request when making the booking. ",4,2017,08,11
132,My favourite place ,"I love this place. Ive stayed a few times, had tea there one lunch time and have been there in the evening for drinks with friends on at least 5 occasions now.

The tea (harney & sons) and red velvet cake at tea time is great! The food is also very good, Ive tried three dishes now from their menu and have enjoyed all dinners Ive had so far.

It's my favourite place to go in London. Quirky and glamorous. Pool room is beautiful, the purple mirrored room is stunning, the reception area is fun with all the funky furniture, even the lifts are out of this world (literally)! 

Service is always good, waiters, bell boys, everyone.

Only constructive criticism I would give is that there should be more available staff at night for guests staying over, as when calling down to concierge it can take a while to get answered. Also the rooms are quite pricy and it would be great if they had more offers available.",5,2017,08,10
132,Fun place to stay for business or pleasure in London!,"Staff was over the top nice and remembered my name throughout my 5 day stay. Concierge team and room service staff super helpful as well. 

Spa needs some major updating but restaurant and bars were fun!",4,2017,08,10
132,Superb hotel.,"This is a superb hotel. Lovely relaxed feeling as soon as you walk in the doors, very welcoming and helpful staff and lots of space! The room was perfect. Huge comfy bed, ultra modern, spotless futuristic-feeling bathroom and again - lots of space! Had such a relaxing and enjoyable stay here right in the heart of frenetic London. Would deffo recommend. Top notch.",5,2017,08,07
132,Amazing staff and hotel ,"I just had an amazing stay at The Sanderson. I had visited the hotel before not as a guest. Everyone who met us from the Doorman, to the reception staff to the bar man couldn't do enough to help us. I've been fortunate to stay in most of London's 5 Star hotels but The Sanderson would now be my first port of call. ",5,2017,08,07
132,Fantastic hotel!,"We stayed in a Deluxe Room facing the courtyard on the 5th floor for 9 nights. Great room with lots of storage space and a fabulous bathroom with shower and bath. Everything was perfect and the room was serviced twice daily. Service was top notch and all the hotel staff from the doorman to the reception desk, seemed genuinely nice and friendly. Great location in Soho, walking distance from all the bars and restaurants, yet just a bit away on a quiet street. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!",5,2017,08,06
132,Simply the Best,"I took my lady here for her Birthday and the whole stay was outstanding. The room was INCREDIBLE - so sleek and stylish. The bar served amazing cocktails of which we had too many :)    - This isn't a place for a quiet drink and a chat though if that's what you are after.  The bar is open to no residents and is a popular hangout. 
I can't say enough good things about this place. Loved every minute of it. Thank you!",5,2017,08,03
132,Amazing hotel in central London,"The room was spacious, always clean and fresh. It was very bright during the day and the lighting details in the evening made it feel relaxing and welcoming. The personal were very helpful and available. The breakfast was tasty and of high quality.",5,2017,08,02
132,Sanderson overnight stay & Tipsy Tea,"We stayed overnight to celebrate my best friends forthcoming wedding and had the perfect classy and special night that she was hoping for!  Absolutely beautiful hotel, perfect location, wonderful staff that treated us all to VIP treatment...absolutely no complaints..just massive thank you for making our weekend so wonderful x",5,2017,07,31
132,Good location busy bar,"Location is great and the bar is good.  Nice vibe of a chilled relaxed hotel, room lighting is poor and is particularly troublesome for a girl to do her makeup 

Staff are helpful didn't use any amenities  ",4,2017,07,24
132,Hip Spot in London!,"This spot is hip with cool lounges, bar and restaurant. The location was great and central to walk everywhere. The neighbor is quite at night but the lobby is alive with party music and cool Londoners. The breakfast was nice and the room was quite to work in with free wifi.",5,2017,07,23
132,IF MONEY'S NO PROBLEM......,"Good check in, very friendly and helpful.  Quirky elevator, like being in space and they smell lovely and fresh.  Room was almost open plan so the loo isn't exactly private which some may find unusual; it's a glass double door with no locks.  Breakfast was ok but pricey, as was the room.  But hey, if money's no object, it's ok.  Great location just 350 yards north of Oxford St.  Late night drinks were expensive (£35 for two cocktails and a 330ml Peroni) plus the invidious ""discretionary"" service charge of 15% (we cancelled it).  If you're out most of the day, there's probably better value places to rest your head.",3,2017,07,23
132,Best blackout blinds!!,"This funky hotel has the best blackout blinds! I travel a lot and have stayed in many hotels, but these were the best. A great nights sleep ;-) 

Hotel rooms are very modern and tasteful. Great for a night out in London. Couple of funky bars in the hotel too. ",5,2017,07,23
132,Another Incredible Stay,"Sanderson has definitely become my ""home"" in London.  With every visit, this property continues to deliver style, comfort, sevice and an inrcredible set of amenities.

The team at the property is outstanding and the location just does not get better.  In the heart of Central London with all the amazing restaurants, shops and bars of Fitzrovia and SoHo at your doorstep.

The room I had on this stay was again super comfortable, and the bed was just heavenly.  The breakfast was excellent, and the bar is terrific in the evening.

I have stayed at this property multiple times and have written two reviews in the past.  More details on my thoughts of the Sanderson can be found in those reviews.

Bottom line -- I cannot recommend this property enough, and cannot wait to return in September for my next stay!",5,2017,07,22
132,Trippy and Funny Hotel,"Been here on a business trip.
The hotel is located in a street next to the Oxford Cyrcus Tube Station, but, if you prefer, you'll be able to reach many location in Central London using your feet :D
The hotel is quite big and cold from the outside, but, once you enter the building, youl'll discover a space and trippy atmosphere which is actually quite funny.
The junior suite are big and confy. The style of the forniture is very similar to a space ship so if you love sci-fi like me you'll enjoy your staying.
Haven't tried the restaurant, but the breakfast was quite good.
4 stars and not 5? Yeah, just because the music at the lounge bar is too high and you can't relax or work in your room until they switch off everything at 11 pm.",4,2017,07,11
132,Cool hotel with a popular nice bar ,Cool interior with sea theme/ ocean influence and with very nice rooms located in the heart of Mayfair close (walking distance) to everything. I can definitely recommend this hotel! The bar is usually very crowded and a bit noisy Wednesday-Saturday and very popular.,4,2017,07,10
132,Posh (UK) Hip (US) Scene at the Sanderson,"The Sanderson's highlight is most def the bar, where London'a finest enjoy funky cocktails. It's just a yupi hangout really, but of the upscale/yet-not-too-flashy type. The down-low of this perfectly-located hotel are the bit-too-sophisticated-yet-not-so -comfy rooms. The nothing but a curtain separating the bed from the toilet may look cool but it actually is quite hospital-like. Perhaps it's the overwhelming whiteness of the aforementioned giant-screen-curtain combined with the linens and the window curtains...but the general vibe is one u may have encountered in ""one flew over the cuckoo's nest"" or the like. 
Food: breakfast was nice, the regular spread...nothing spectacular. Dinner: snax at the bar are lovely with a specific noting of the Sanderson's burger which was really good. 
The Sanderson is more about location though than anything, as it's a corner off Oxford Street and maybe a couple of blocks away from Coventry Garden.
Enjoy!",3,2017,07,08
132,A chance to live a design icon,"Great, clean, quiet and spacious rooms, super comfy bed, high quality bed sheets and pillows. The bathroom is quirky and has no hooks to hang your towels but nice amenities and good lighting. Friendly staff from doormen to housekeeping and reception. Breakfast was excellent. The long bar was busy every evening. In addition to the iconic garden in the center of the hotel, there is also great outdoor seating street side.",5,2017,07,07
132,Excellent !,"Just stayed here for 1 night but I have to say it will be my ' go to ' hotel in London from now on. All the staff were excellent in terms of consistency in customer service , helpfulness and just their friendly smiles and approachable attitudes. 
Thank you so much for my stay and thank you to Jose , the concierge and the bar staff for making my visit so memorable !",5,2017,07,06
132,Amazing Hotel,"Stayed here as a surprise for my 21st, we arrived early and planned to drop our bags but they insisted to find us a room that was available so we checked in early. When we arrived at our room they had provided complimentary champagne and dessert! The room was quirky, spacious, immaculately clean and the bed was unbelievably comfy. The long bar had a great atmosphere and lovely cocktails. I would definitely recommend.",5,2017,07,05
132,The interior design and atmosphere is great!,Never judge a book by its cover! Looks very worn on the outside but once your through the doors it has the wow factor. The staff were all really friendly and the food was also to a really good standard.,4,2017,07,03
132,Vibrant gotel in central London,"The Sanderson is a super funky hotel only a 2min walk from Soho. We stayed in a double/twin room and the room was massive! The decor is very modern, and the use of white curtains around the bathroom is a nice touch (there is still glass so plenty of privacy!). The room we stayed in had a view of office buildings fire escapes, but the room more than made up for this! The residence bar is dark and cosy, a nice retreat if you want a break from the super trendy and (usually) busy hotel bar. Location was great for us, a 2min walk across Oxford St and we were into the vibrant streets of Soho. It you want to stay around the traditional houses of london this isn't for you, but if you want somewhere central and an easy walk from the restaurants, theatres & bars of Soho and Leicester Square this hotel is great.",5,2017,07,02
132,DO NOT STAY ANYWHERE ELSE,"room fantastic , people fantastic , could not be more helpful , after we checked out realized i left something in the room , alessanbro in concierge cleaned my shirt and returned to me , over and above call of duty ,",5,2017,06,30
132,Great Option,"Well located (closed to Oxford Circus Underground), amazing service, beautiful and vibrant place and good food. Ask for Handy...an smart phone to be use free while in London....a great tool if you are not from EU community.",5,2017,06,29
132,Extraordinary Customer Service and a Fun Atmosphere,"I have been traveling to London on business and love staying at the Sanderson!!  With Jose, Asst. Manager, Bekin the Concierge, and Aldo/CJ as bellman - always feels like returning home to friends.  The rooms are modern and spacious, with yummy Malin and Goetz amenities.  Neighborhood is fantastic with many great restaurants, coffee houses, near Regents Park and close to Oxford Street (as well as far enough away for a quieter vibe.)  They always go the extra mile and make sure that my trips to London are exceptional.  Highly recommended!",5,2017,06,25
132,One of my favourite hotels,"Sanderson Hotel is probably one of my favourite hotels to stay in.

The location itself is great, right in the West End. The bar is beautiful and the rooms are awesome. If you're one of those that don't really like the taste of alcohol, you must try all their cocktails as they are just so yummy...!! 

It's one of those hotels you just don't want to leave at the end of your stay... It's a home away from home with great panache. 

",4,2017,06,25
132,Boutique Hotel in Mayfair,People were very friendly.. Thanx to Ed the night manager.  All the guys and gals in the lobby and door were great.  Room was good.  Bathrooms all glass and really nice.  Room service menu very small and food was really over cooked.. Not happy with that..,5,2017,06,24
132,"LOCATION, FRIENDLY STAFF, DESIGN, COMFIEST BEDS","Having stayed here for a second time recently, I feel SANDERSON deserves a outstanding review.

Within minutes We knew this was going to be a fabulous experiance!

From meeting the Valet to park our car, Door men the care & attention was personal The reception team, make you feel special.

Our Room was refreshing, in a non fussy vibe, 
 Tasteful Decor & the most comfiest beds!

Breakfast Waiting team, Couldn't do enough to make sure Breakfast Was pleasant, Especially with diet allergies to be catered for.
Nothing was too much effort:

Check out was easy & our car was waiting immediately & loaded professionally

Impecable service impecable staff impeccable hotel, We shall return for a third visit in the near future.",5,2017,06,22
132,perfect. the staff are the cream of the crop,"wonderful stay here - staff welcomed us, cared for us, looked after my mothers non alcoholic cocktail needs, breakfast service was superb, check out friendly and efficient. this is the stuff that makes a stay. london hotels you can get a comfy bed anywhere. the room (a loft double was huge and spacious an quiet) the location is perfect. the staff really made it for us though. thanks everyone. ",5,2017,06,21
132,Would stay again ,"I was really happy with my stay here. The hotel is actually really nice and a cool area for a drinks. The bed was superb as were the pillows and the room was quite spacious. Hotel staff were really nice especially the porters and the concierge even organized a hair cut for me which was also very well done. The location is fantastic as it's right off Oxford Street and right near soho so was easy to get back after a night out. For those of you who like spinning, there's a psycle studio right around the corner (which was a major benefit of this hotel). Will definitely stay here next time I'm in town. ",5,2017,06,17
132,Awesome staff and funky design,"Polarizing experience at Sanderson. In some respects absolutely amazing experience, but in some very mediocre.

Let’s start with the good:
- People, every single interaction I had w/ the hotel’s staff was great. Porters, receptionists, waiters, bartenders all were awesome.
- I do have to specially highlight the bartenders. The duo of Portuguese guys (Ricardo and Ruben, if my drunk memory isn’t failing me) mixed some delicious drinks with great life stories. And of course charming Marta who made some great Vieux Carres with a mean twist.
- Design, the hotel has a very cool design which is definitely aesthetically pleasing.
- Gym, hotel has a decent gym with some standard cardio equipment and dumbbells, but most surprisingly there is even a barbell!
- Wi-fi, it is there, it is free, and it works. The only downside it’s limited to 3 devices per room, not sure how easy it is to add more.

The bad:
- Design, even though it looks cool, some things are set-up very inconveniently. The bathroom as whole has to be one of the least convenient hotel bathrooms I’ve used in my life. From the mirror mounted off to the side, to dim lighting, to no place (except the floor) to put the toiletries down in the shower, to glass doors w/ metal nobs that feel like they’re going to shatter if you’re not careful w/ them, it just feels like nobody thought about people needing to use the bathroom and not just look at it.
- Low ceilings, the ceilings in rooms are quite low. I was in one of the bigger rooms, so it wasn’t too bad, but I would imagine the smaller ones could feel pretty claustrophobic with such low ceilings.
- Hallways, those just feel really creepy, narrow, dark, with low ceilings…

Having said that, in my opinion, the positives outweigh the negatives and I’m likely to stay at Sanderson again on my next visit.",4,2017,06,16
132,Beautiful,"Bars are beautiful 
Rooms are beautiful
I was celebrating my birthday 

We really liked the minimum details here, minimalistic style , Scandinavian white rooms ... I am in love with this hotel. 
Love everything about this place and hope to come back in the near future!",5,2017,06,16
132,business and pleasure,"People make places and the people at the Sanderson are special. Nothing is too much trouble and they always ensure your stay is a treat even when on business. I regularly take my family when we want a weekend together in London. My three daughters love it because of its proximity to the shops and all the fun places to go. The tie up with Hakkasan is great because they love to eat there, so cool and yet amazing food. The doormen always talk to them and make them feel special, which is such a friendly touch. It makes it feel safe and like a second home. A great place and fabulous people from the waitresses and waiters all the way to the top.  Paris, the guest experience manager there deserves a special mention because she is so professional and friendly and able to sort the smallest to biggest requirement out with style, class and speed. Cannot wait to my next visit.",5,2017,06,15
132,My home from home in London,"It is always a pleasure to stay at The Sanderson when travelling on business.  The team from the doormen, to the front desk , to the restaurant and bar are without exception professional, friendly, helpful, warm and welcoming.  It is a pleasure to arrive and be greeted with a smile - it really does feel like home from home!  

Paris Barati does a great job as Guest Experience Manager, ensuring that our changing needs are met with no fuss and that everything is up to standard.

Thanks again for another enjoyable stay!",5,2017,06,13
132,Confessions of a Regular Guest,"Ok, I confess. Although we're regular visitors to The Sanderson, we've been dabbling in other hotels.
The thing is, after a few years of always booking this hotel as our home-from-home in London, we did start wondering if we were missing out on anything. 
So we've tried a newcomer to the scene ( too much concept, not enough service), and a grand old dame (still grand but fading, and tiny rooms).

So we're back to The Sanderson, happy, and remembering why we fell in love with the place and the people in the first place. 

Sanderson, we love you!

Ps. Thank you Paris and Phil and the rest of the staff for everything!",5,2017,06,13
132,Nice modern Hotel,"Ideally situated in SOHO on a quiet street and convenient to about everything.

We were upgraded to a large corner suite and really enjoyed the high quality modern design and quiet atmosphere.

Service was prompt and helpful.",4,2017,06,10
132,Another Great Stay,"First class service, great ambience, professional staff, comfy beds. Always something going on. Thank you for making our stay yet again special. The Birthday treats were a lovely touch and much appreciated. ",5,2017,06,10
132,Service gone right down,"I have been staying at this hotel for last 7 years me and my partner always was loyal customers to Sanderson hotel and also brough a lot of custom to the Sanderson not just from myself but friends and family also. 
We have always been looked after through out out stay Indre always provided the best possible service and always made sure my stay was perfect I feel Sanderson have lost a valued and excellent member of staff with Indee now not being a front desk. 
The service has gone very very poor the staff do not care how they treat loyal customers 
Just a note of my last experience in may with Sanderson hotel in all the years I have stayed at Sanderson  I never pay late check out I booked Sanderson hotel for ,y birthday the staff. Was aware it was my birthday I booked 2 rooms my room and one for my friend I received a call to ,y room at 1pm to advise check out was 12 and I would be charged £70 late check out free I was extremely unhappy about this and I was leaving the room to catch my train I spoke with the lady on desk she was extremely rude no customer service skills what so Eva and I feel Sanderson will loose a lot of good customers if this lady continues to treat and speak to cutsomers like the way I was treated. If you need to know details of the person you can contact me 
We are known to the hotel and are very friendly with all door and bar staff and slot of your own staff was even shocked that I was charged 
Another example I had my room and my friend had her room my card was only left for my deposit and my friend left a cash deposit I checked my bank a few days later and Sanderson have taken money oily of my account so I emailed Paris Barati to question this I was advised they used my card to take for mini bar from my friends room I think this is very very poor service and this should never happen my friend checked out and was given cash back my card was nothing to do with her room and this is terrible to just deduct from my account 
When I took this up with Paris again seems like Sanderson are not very good with customers no more and don't value my business 
I feel the service has gone right down and the staff don't value the customer off myself 
I was always treated with the best service and this has gone right down 
And when your bringing this much business and spending a lot of money at Sanderson you expect to be treated a lot better 
I will be taking my business else we're as the service is not up to standard anymore",2,2017,06,10
132,Funky but not functional ,"We have been wanting to visit the Sanderson hotel for a while now . Walking past the lobby and seeing the iconic red lip sofa is intriguing. Staff at reception were lovely although check in was later than I had been offered when booking . 
The room was bright and clean but not really functional . Looking round for somewhere to hang my clothes up I couldn't find a closet ... however reaching for a bath robe later I found a rail behind a curtain in the bathroom . With too people in the room and a glass door to the toilet and no door to the bathroom it took a bit of planning getting ready for a night out ! 
Disappointed also that there was only a single small wash basin in the bathroom .Comparable London hotels often have two  basins and much larger rooms .
We decided to have breakfast downstairs before my husband went to work . It took an age to be served with coffee and at the buffet there were first no bowls then no yoghurt then no fruit . Once I had requested and waited for each in turn and my husband had walked to the desk to try and hurry the coffee up we decided not to return . 
Gutted .I really wanted this to go well as I love the atmosphere at their sister hotel St Martins and their breakfast service is wonderful !",3,2017,06,10
132,Stunning when you get inside,"From the outside it's an awful Sixties (I think) looking building but make your way inside & it's awesome.  Funky furniture, cool bars, gorgeous rooms & the courtyard is beautiful.  Staff very good indeed. Well recommended.",5,2017,06,05
132,"Current, cool and acccomodating","From the moment we were greeted at the door, we were impressed by the level of service provided at the Sanderson. The decor is modern and fun. The bar and restaurants are open and airy. We enjoyed our time there in the convenience to the surrounding shopping and AMAZING restaurants is ideal. Next time we come to London, we'll stay here again. ",5,2017,06,03
132,Just amazing,"Booked a special birthday treat for the girlfriend, a west end show and a stay at the Sanderson. From the outside the hotel looks likes a 70's office block but once you step inside youre senses are hit with an array of smart decor and smells (the latter you can actually purchase for £38). The large reception area has different sofas and chairs which are perfect for photo opportunities. 

I upgraded our room and got a super king-size sleigh bed and and a free standing bath. Both worth the extra poundage, if you know what I mean 😉. The room was spotless and the attention to detail was incredible, everything was modern our room even had a pair of philippe starck weights mounted on the wall for some exercises if you hadn't done enough already. The room had a glass partition which housed the bathroom, toilet, walk-in shower and the stand alone bath tub. You could operate an automatic gold curtain so you couldn't been seen if you were bashful. 
Our room had a TV, mini bar (expensive drinks £3.50 for a coke and £5 for a water) 

We used room service twice, the food was top notch and understandably expensive for a hotel of this quality. 

The staff couldn't do enough for you, from the doormen, reception desk, porters and host keeping they were all very friendly and they made you feel welcomed and special.

This has to be my most favourite hotel I've ever stayed at, shame it was only for the night. 

Thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone that appreciates a modern style and a wow factor.

132,Wonderful stay!,"Stayed last night and had to write my first review for tripadvisor I was that impressed! I requested an early check in as I had a charity run first thing in the morning and wanted access to the shower etc... they gave us access to my room by 11am and upgraded us to a suite! The room was pure luxury, overlooking the beautiful courtyard where we later experienced the Mad Hatter's Tea Party which was well worth doing! Shout out to Aga our waitress as she didn't hear me properly about my nut allergy.... not that it was a problem as I read the menu and knew to avoid the blue caterpillar but when she realised she couldn't do enough for us as a way of apologising! I got a separate plate with nut free alternatives and she gave us complimentary champagne! Its service like this that makes a stay from good to excellent! 
Lastly, as we checked out... shout out to Paris on reception for being super charming and giving us some background about the building itself and a discount code if we came back. Every staff member we encountered in our short one night stay was extremely welcoming and lovely. I myself am a manager in the hospitality industry and have been for 20 years, its service like this that makes a hotel a wonderful experience. Sanderson have nailed it! :)",5,2017,05,27
132,Nice hotel but a bit strange LOL :),"We are currently at this hotel.. We travel to London about once a year to see family and always stay in an hotel the last couple nights before leaving to  travel back home. Its nice to be in the city to shop, dine and explore .. We normally stay in the Westminster area, but decided to change it up and try a new place. The hotel is in a great location, The staff was helpful and the hotel is clean... Strange things.. The hallways are so dark. We walked down a long dark creepy hall to our room. The rooms are nice, but if you have a bit of OCD (not making fun) the room will make you want to fix everything. Bed crooked, sink crooked, furnishing just weird.  Bath products are nice, room was cleaned promptly, and they leave complimentary water, which  is very nice.  Lobby is just weird..Overall.. I think this was  nice hotel near all the shopping, Soho, nice restaurants. I am not sure I would stay again because there are so many more really nice hotels in London,",4,2017,05,27
132,Excellent customer seevice,"We stayed here last night for a last minute break in London. The hotel is beautiful, funky, spotless and fun. The bar was welcoming and relaxed and we had great pre and post dinner drinks. On driving home I found that I had left a special pair of earrings at the hotel. I received brilliant service from both Daniel and Giacomo in housekeeping and guest services, who went out of their way to help me on the phone, found my earrings and arranged for them to be returned to me. I was very impressed and very, very grateful! Thoroughly recommended. ",5,2017,05,26
132,Wonderful,"Really classy hotel. Perfect stay. Rooms are very clean and bright. Beds are confortable. Service is perfect. The bar in the lobby is great to enjoy a cocktail after a long day of work in the city. 
I will definitely come back again.",5,2017,05,25
132,Fantastic cool hotel,"Stayed here with my wife on her birthday.  It is such a cool place.  The lobby is littered with modern art/ furniture but it's the bars that make this place special, the fantastic long bar played host to a really mixed crowd of old and young out to party!  And then there is the snug purple bar for very late night drinks, just for guests.

Breakfast was a joy, eaten outside in the sun dappled garden courtyard.  

The rooms are cool, fashionable translucent drapes separate the bed and shower areas.  Simple but effective design, lovely comfortable bed.  

The location. Could not be better, I love the fact that the street is quiet but also very short to the hussle and bussle of Oxford street and super close to the restaurants and night life of Charlotte street and the rest of Fitzrovia.

Great place to base yourself for fun in London.",5,2017,05,23
132,"A good location, great staff, food and room-service","The Sanderson is a fine hotel in a good location in close proximity to Regent Street and the shopping.
The room service is prompt and the food was well prepared.
We had a meal in the restaurant with both meat and fish dishes for three people and were most pleased with a bill just under £200 UK Pounds.
Prices are",5,2017,05,19
132,"Lovely staff, comfy bed, quirky design","The Sanderson has a very modern styling which is great. Highlights include the first floor bar, outdoor patio and the Billards room. The staff is lovely and the rooms are nicely sized with a comfy bed. The quirks might be a little but much for some travelers, the hallways are very dimly lit, so if low lighting bothers you, take note. The bathroom has no door, only a curtain, so if you are traveling with someone else you have to decide if that's in your comfort zone. There's no outlets in the bathroom, they are next to a large mirror in the main room / bed area. It doesn't matter really, but it means you have to take your stuff from the bathroom out to shave or do your hair. (might matter if someone is sleeping in the bed beside you). They use curtains everywhere but as a women traveling alone, I didn't like how the curtains blocked my view of the room when I entered - just as a safety issue. Overall it's great, many restaurants in walking distance and a genuine happening vibe. ",4,2017,05,16
132,The friendliest hotel,"We stayed for just the one night but wished it could have been more. There are a number of great things about this place : the first is that it was the most friendly and helpful group of staff we have met and they came across as a real team.After an initial mix up with the last minute.com booking they found us upgraded rooms; my mum-in-law's room was almost as big as her bungalow! Super modern place as other reviews have noted.Dinner was very well cooked and presented but choice for veggies could be wider. Breakfast was excellent and again staff couldn't be more helpful offering to change any dishes we may not like!All freshly cooked to order. Location is great for theatre land being only a £13 cab ride away or an easy stroll if you are fit. Best,and largest, bed we had ever slept in; duvet turned down for the night having had all towels changed again for the evening.

Great and busy cocktail bar. Noise didn't carry to floors above.

Minor criticisms relate to poorly lit corridors if your eyesight isn't good and a handrail needed for a short flight of steps.Management took both suggestions on board.

Will definitely stay again.",5,2017,05,12
132,Boutique look of London,"Sofa in the form of red lips met us at the entrance. Other chairs in the lobby were made in the same crazy way. Smiling door guards helped us with a luggage and suggested to clap hands if we wanted an elevator to go up. An elevator itself with walls and ceiling looked like night sky.  
It is not Peter Pan’s Neverland or children's party decoration. It’s a Sanderson Hotel’s  style of boutique accommodation. The room met us with a surprising interior as well: beautiful lighting and curtains instead of doors in some places. Which was amazing and comfortable at the same time.
One minute steak for breakfast gave an energy for the whole day. There were two bars ready to treat late visitors like us after show in Ronny Scott’s.
Sanderson Hotel is absolutely new imagination of London.",5,2017,05,04
132,London Theatre Break,"Stayed overnight at the Sanderson on a theatre break.  The service was excellent as was the room.  Breakfast was great too. It was a very good experience.
Our room was noisy as it was over the public cocktail bar but all noise stopped at midnight.",5,2017,05,03
132,stylish hip hotel,"the rooms are super stylish and chic, maybe not everyone taste because they are very transparent and view through including the toilets. Big beds and great minibar.
the bar at the ground floor is amazing
the only thing why I didn't give them the 5th star is their kitchen, they could do so much better, the food is really nothing  exceptional",4,2017,05,02
132,The bride to be getaway,"My staying at Sanderson has been wonderful. Everything was perfect, the suite beautiful and spacious and the breakfast very good.  I apèpreciated very much the special attention that the Hotel reserved to me and my sister for my coming back. ",5,2017,05,02
132,AMAZING!,"The Sanderson was beyond my expectations. We held group meetings there for 3 days and I stayed on after. The room was AMAZING, the staff was super attentive and the food was superb!  Highly, highly recommend this place!  I LOVED IT",5,2017,05,01
132,Pleasant Modern Surprise,"In London for the first time for two nights. Wanted a nice hotel with modern features in a hip neighborhood. Turned out Sanderaon was perfect. Fresh, contemporary and happening, the Sanderson was a fun get away.  Unique hotel design with a rock n roll vibe. Door staff and desk staff all very helpful. Room was great, clean, bright and with all the imenitities you might expect., and more. Hotel is a bit on a side street so not super noisy, but within walking distance of cool shops and restaurants. Would definItely stay here again.",5,2017,04,30
132,Absolutely fabulous hotel!!! ,"The Sanderson may now be my new London favourite.

To start, from the outside I did check whether I put the right Sanderson in to google - it doesn't scream 5 star fabulous (I thought Travelodge) Then you walk in and the fabulousness begins!

The concierge team were amazing pre-stay and helped me to pull off a great surprise for my husbands 40th.  Massive thank you to them for offering such a superior level of customer care.

The public areas, silver long bar, purple bar, court yard, pool table...even the lifts... were modern & contemporary in design.

We had a deluxe room which was every level of fabulous in detail, lay-out, design & comfort.  It was a huge room!  The contemporary design runs through the entire hotel. 

The Sanderson got everything right for us, we loved it! ",5,2017,04,30
132,"Such elegant simplicity with great comfort, but low value-for-money","It was a tough choice to make - between London Edition and this! Picked this, as my partner preferred a more modern take to hotels. 

We were led into a room (that we really liked), and realised there was 2 pieces of luggage already in there. The porter apologised and after much discussion with the front desk that we were told that they would give us a better room for that mistake. Turned out it was a smaller room, and we would have much preferred the first. Nonetheless, we accepted what we got, as the rooms are good anyway. 

I must say this is a hotel that you should book only if you are very close to the person sharing the room or alone, because there will be no secrets to hide when you use the toilet. The curtain that shields you from the room can only do very little... Anything you do in the toilet can be heard in the room. 

There is no fault to the service here at Sanderson. It was raining quite heavily and the concierge went all out for us. Taking us in umbrella to the car, with him walking in the rain retrieving the bags. Kudos!

The bar at the lobby floor is buzzing and very good for people-watching, and to invite friends over for drinks! 

Location is amazing! We had most of our dinners in Soho, so it's walkable to most places. 

I see this place as the epitome of hip & simple. In my humble opinion, I would only recommend it to those who do not fear/mind splurging, as it is rather expensive for what you get. It is a beautiful hotel, but would not rate it high on the return-on-investment scale.",4,2017,04,30
132,Solid Hotel Great Experience,"All good at sanderson.  would have liked to be able to check in after overnight flight but that is normal.
food very good.   concierge very helpful. rooms cool decent gym  fantastic neighbourhood would stay again ",4,2017,04,28
132,Excellant service,"I visited this hotel with a friend last month. 
The room was very nice, clean and the hotel is in an excellant location. 
A bit pricey but Im a big fan of you get what you pay for.
We ordered a couple of bottles of champagne and partied the night away with a few friends. It was a great night and i would recommend it to anyone looking for an ultra trendy hotel in a  great location.",4,2017,04,27
132,I felt like the most important person,"I have never stayed in a hotel where everyone makes you feel important, every member of staff in the hotel has impressed me. They greeted us, they were interested in us and helped with any questions we had. The hotel decor is so funky and cool and the long bar is fab, we came for the London marathon and had lots of friends and family come over and everyone was welcomed inc children. Spa was fantastic and very relaxing. 
I would recommend and we will stay again! ",5,2017,04,25
132,Amazing Staff,Sanderson is always a winner. The staff especially the daytime doormen and the staff at the Long Bar are all amazing and the main reasón for always staying at Sanderson. From the second we arrive we feel like comming home and leaving is always hard but since we stay at Sanderson 5-6 times a year we always look forward to come back again.,5,2017,04,25
132,Enjoy My Stay - Staff Was Very Attentive,"Overall, I enjoyed my 4 night stay at the Sanderson.  Room was spacious and very clean.  Hotel staff was very attentive, including Gaby in the restaurant.  The only knock was that the person who checked me in didn't do a good job letting me know what amenities were included, such as the breakfast.",5,2017,04,24
132,Classic cool,I last visited The Sanderson over 10 years ago so was expecting it to be slightly dated - this was not the case - it is still achingly cool - from the decor to the bars and funky afternoon tea - love it,5,2017,04,18
132,Nice but a little disappointed with the service in the hotel,"We planned this two night stay months ago. We live local to the hotel and we love staying in Starck designed hotels and this chain of hotels. My wife really needed a break so we booked the hotel. The hotel is great and the stat was lovely apart from one issue we had. We were both looking forward to having a drink in the garden at the hotel whilst reading a book. This was what we were looking forward to most. However both afternoons we were told rather firmly that the garden was full with people who had booked afternoon tea. The afternoon tea did look great by the way, but as guests of the hotel we should have at least been catered for in the garden. Even though the garden was full, it was the way we were spoken to that upset us. The lady on the desk just rolled her eyes at us when I asked if we could take a seat.
So in summary I would stay at the hotel again, and certainly go back for afternoon tea, and hopefully get to experience the garden and water features.",4,2017,04,17
132,Always a treat!,"I returned to Sanderson once more and had a lovely visit. The rooms are so comfortable and the staff exceptionally friendly. This time I made it  point to have breakfast a few days during my stay. I had the pleasure of meeting and being served by Gaby on a few of those days. His friendly smile, anticipatory service and general kindness were so greatly aprecated by this traveler who had been on the road for quite some time! Thank you gabby for going above and beyond to make me feel so at home in your establishment!",5,2017,04,14
132,Just book it,"We were unsure where to stay in London and could not have  found a better place. Location was fantastic, staff were professional sincere and friendly. I normally find something  to highlight that could be improved  upon but not this time. Room was delightful, spa was gorgeous and gym was large for a hotel. Didnt eat there but would try next time. Would highly recommend. ",5,2017,04,14
132,Great location but a bit noisy !,"The Hotel offers a great location, few meters away from Oxford Street Soho district. The hotel building has been transformed by Philippe Starck and most of the rooms were renovated, the hotel is still in the process of modernization. The hotel is also including a well known Purple Bar , a restaurant and also a SPA. You can also park your car for an additional extra charge. Overall the hotel is very modern ( I could say uber-modern  with some eccentric touches like the stars cape décor in the lift. The room was beautiful, minimalistic and modern, the bed was very comfortable and the shower are was  very clean (what you would expect from all the hotels). The room also provides a flat TV screen and a Wi-Fi connection. The staff was great overall our stay and very helpful. Only negative points to my eyes was the Nuxe Spa, I was disappointed and by the noise. I had a room on the street and I could ear all the cars passing by, this is probably due to the fact that rooms have single-glazed windows. Also the fact that there are only two lifts for the whole hotel, waiting time can get long. But overall  I can certainly recommend this hotel to everyone to have a nice stay whilst in London.",4,2017,04,13
132,Nice hotel but some design flaws,"Nothing you wouldn't expect from a decent hotel. It's clean but generally a little dated. Service is great, my room was tidied every day and there's a turn down service without having to ask for it.

My main gripe was with the bathroom in general. The knobs for hot/cold water are all smooth finished which makes them frustrating to use if your hands are soapy. Also there was no place to put your toiletries in the shower except for a metal disc no larger than a CD. Also no hooks for towels in the shower which meant you had to open the shower door and get exposed to the cool air before you can dry off.",4,2017,04,12
132,Sensational Sanderson,"Ive been staying at the Sanderson for a few years now. The rooms are outstanding, large by London standards, and simple and well appointed, with outstanding bathrooms. But it is the staff that make it; the doormen, the concierge & reception staff and the bar staff are as good as any hotel in the world. The staff make it a home away from home, which is unusual for a city like London.",5,2017,04,10
132,Sexy Clean and Fun!!,"Wow!   Wonderful hotel close to everything.  If you can't walk, the tube is close.  The rooms are large and the most comfortable bed!!!!   Blackout shades drawn at night make the sleep experience the best especially after a night at their Long Bar.   Everyone was so nice and helpful.  Front desk, concierge, breakfast & bartenders!   Highly recommend!",5,2017,04,10
132,Birthday celebration ,"Very nice hotel in central London, excellent customer service, beautiful room, spacious, clean, quiet and comfortable.
Staff were kind, helpful and really made our stay warm and welcoming.
Thank you for the champagne and strawberries as a gift for my birthday this was a very kind gesture and most appreciated, can highly recommend the hotel for lunch/dinner and cocktails.
",5,2017,04,10
132,Love at First Sight!,"I had passed by the Sanderson Hotel on a previous trip to London, and thought to myself: Someday, I will stay at this Hotel! The wait was well worth it. The room was excellent - I loved the lit room numbers inset into the hall carpets in front of the room doors. The staff was pleasant and extremely helpful as I navigated through London. I particularly enjoyed  The Purple Bar - intimate, warm, pleasant bar-tender. Even the elevator (sorry, lift) is an experience.",5,2017,04,05
132,Door hosts,"Excellent service from the door staff at this hotel. My car was parked for me by a very polite gentleman called Jose his service is 5 star. I can't express how welcoming and helpful he was. I will definitely return to this hotel for business based on the service from their door staff working above and beyond to offer service with a smile and providing particular care for their guest to ensure their stay is to their standard. 

Justin ",5,2017,04,05
132,Good location. Excellent staff.,"Very clean room. Great food in restaurant & room service!
Staff very professional, pleasant & courteous.
Gaby, a waiter in the restaurant - first class.
The visit was enjoyed immensely by all members of my family who spent 4 nights at The Sanderson.",5,2017,04,03
132,The Sanderson Hotel,"What an absolute pleasure to stay at this hotel , the staff are so attentive , friendly and helpful , we had such a amazing weekend here , we can't wait to go back for some more girlie fun , the bar staff were fantastic and the bar has a great ambience the DJ was a nice touch , throughly enjoyed it such a great experience",5,2017,04,03
132,Very cool and trendy,"Although not too promising from the outside, this is a very nice hotel with a very cool vibe. Perhaps long dark corridors and a cosmic lift is off-putting for some but the superior rooms are a vision of voile and stylish layout. Large excellent bathroom and nice touches like the weights for exercising in-room. Fabulous bars and very friendly staff make you very welcome.",5,2017,04,03
132,Weekend stay,"Excellent centre hotel for a weekend break .
Started the weekend off in the Long bar  the place was buzzing .
Loved the simplicity of the bedroom  it felt very restful  . Lots of people having fun  in the different areas of the hotel in the bars and restaurant,  there  was one room with afternoon tea being served  and they have a mad hatters tea party in April being arranged .
We ate locally but came back to end the evening  in the purple bar.  Hotels should be fun and professional and offer something different which this hotel did.
Did not use the spa but would visit next time. And then have afternoon tea in the hotel .
Will definitely rebook as lots of shopping and different restaurants within easy walking distance .",5,2017,04,02
132,Mixed Feelings,"The hotel is more for the younger crowd and hipsters. The rooms were spacious and clean but does not feel luxurious. There are no wardrobe in the room and the shower is rather small. 

Location is great as it's just a few minutes from oxford street. 

The afternoon tea was good but quite crowded and noisy. ",3,2017,04,01
132,17 Years Strong,"There are so many new places to stay in London -- and yes, I want to try many of them.  Still, I keep being drawn back to the Sanderson.  Hotels are an iffy thing.  So many try to do so many things well and it's the little things that are ignored.  The Sanderson keeps getting things right, and does it well, and with professionalism that is often lacking.   From the bell staff to the front desk team, the staff is incredibly welcoming. Unlike newer hotels, they are not impressed with themselves with working at the ""hotel du jour,"" but instead, try to impress you with how much they feel good to see you.  Rooms are comfortable and well maintained.  Room service is timely and good.  17 years makes the Sanderson grow in stature and makes guests feel at home.",5,2017,03,30
132,Best place to stay in London ,We have been staying here for the last ten years and never tire of it! The rooms are amazing. The staff go above and beyond to please and the Long Bar is fab. Great location  and can't wait to go back! ,5,2017,03,26
132,Did not disappoint!,"The first thing I should mention is that Gaby is the best! Gaby works in the restaurant during the morning shift, and he was a pleasure. The breakfast also was not bad at all! I tried nearly everything on the menu, and also had the continental - plenty of smoked salmon and avocado toast for all! I also had dinner in the restaurant, and it was quite good. 

As for the rooms, they are clean and cozy, which is great! However, the bathrooms are not very functional. The light is too dim to apply make-up without fearing what you'll look like when you go outside! There's also no place to hang your towel or robe while you shower (particularly in the loft room), so you have to exit the shower, walk across the slippery floor soaking wet (do NOT fall), and then get to your towel (and hope you don't freeze on the way). Additionally, the shower door opens to the inside, but there is no knob! It's a slippery piece of metal which you can't grab if your hands are wet (and they should be if you took a halfway decent shower). So you are stuck in the shower until you can pry the door open (to the inside). And forget about it if you've gained a few extra pounds eating the breakfast bread - some of the showers are so small that in order to open the door inwards (whether you actually accomplish it, or call someone to get you out), there's no space for you to stand! Suck it all in - you will have to in order to open the door. I actually thought that there were maybe some hidden cameras where people were posted and just laughing. The smallest shower I had was in the loft room -- I did have a bigger shower in the King room (although it still opened inward with a metal sliver thing and not a knob... so you still risk getting stuck). I actually found the whole bathroom thing kind of funny - it's obvious that the person who built it did not try to use it. Still, it's a fun hotel, and the staff is great. Just be prepared to have a little fun exiting the shower, and putting on your make-up. If you don't shower or wear foundation, you're all good!",4,2017,03,25
132,Sanderson is the best!!! Only place to stay in London! ,"Spent five days at the Sanderson from the USA looking for good food and a little sightseeing. I can't say enough about this hotel and the staff. The rooms were large and the location was perfect/walkable. The concierge went above and beyond. They directed me and my mates to the most wonderful dinners each night. I left feeling like Giacomo (concierge) was a friend. The Door Team was awesome, especially Jose. Always greeting you with a smile and opening the door. 

Thanks Sanderson! We will be back soon...
",5,2017,03,20
132,Sophistication in Soho,"First time in London--loved the Sanderson.  The Decor was a bit 'out there' but it didn't take away from the experience. 

Rooms were super spacious and tastefully done. Comfortable beds and spa like bathrooms.  

The lobby bar made the best cocktails--dirty martinis and old fashions. Super courteous and helpful staff.

Close to oxford circus and the underground. 

I'd stay here again.  ",5,2017,03,19
132,My 40th birthday celebrations ,"We had such a lovely time at the Sanderson Hotel, the room was very clean and we had one of the best night sleeps.  The cocktails from the Long Bar helped!!  The staff were all very accommodating. We will definitely be going back.",5,2017,03,19
132,Always stay here,"I have been staying at the Sanderson for years and will always return. The location is excellent and the staff goes above and beyond. Special mention to the front door staff: Heinrich, Jose, CJ, Aldo, Phil and the rest. Always welcoming and as a returning guest, great me by name. There is something to be said when you continue to return to the same hotel and everyone knows who you are. Terri the general manger at night is always attentive. The front desk staff is extremely accommodating. I cannot say enough about this hotel. I look forward to my next stay in a few months.",5,2017,03,19
132,Roy,"The air conditioner not worm in the room 
It's was freezing 
I try to speak but nobody help to fix 
The hotel send one person to try fixing but is not work 
I order room service but the food come cold I call them and the person told me I check it before is come to your room and it was warm 
I always say the true the food was cold 
Never come back 
The service not good at all",1,2017,03,17
132,Love the Sanderson,"I stayed here for my birthday and loved every minute of it. The design of the rooms is super cool with lots of unexpected  details. The bar downstairs does a great
cocktail. Great central London location.",5,2017,03,14
132,EXCELLENT,Everything was done with a smile and friendly service! We enjoyed our stay from the minute we entered (with the very handsome doormen) to the moment we left! Excellent breakfast - everything imaginable on the menu. The ambiance was extra ordinary!!!,5,2017,03,13
132,"Modern, perfect comfort to round off the Theatre visit!","High quality service from the minute of arrival til departure. Valet service great for the car.. good idea so we could relax after the journey. Very modern feel to the hotel with very unusual decor which takes you into a different zone...the lifts are something else!
The room was great, with the theme running through from the hotel .... spacious, modern with great facilities. If you do desire the tea/coffee tray too, then one call is all you need!
We had an evening liqueur in the strange but wonderful Purple Bar after our London show. Breakfast was very relaxed in the morning. Great all round stay.
NB.... we had an extended check out so could do a little shopping in nearby Oxford St. The luggage was kept securely for us until we collected the car. CJ was particuarly helpful",5,2017,03,11
132,Fab night at the sanderson,Stayed at the Sanderson for the first time recently and will definitely be coming back.  Checked in and immediately got a room upgrade and also complimentary drinks vouchers for the long bar.  The room was fab very spacious and extremely comfortable.  Drinks in the Long bar were amazing the service was faultless.  We then experienced the Mad Hatters Tipsey tea in the courtyard which was very unique.  I booked this hotel by pure chance but will now keep it on my top 5 list of places to stay in London.  Fabulous!!,5,2017,03,10
132,Good hotel,"Near soho and oxford , its luxury hotel with good size rooms and good bar/Resturant 

The hotel has one of the best afternoons tea service , and the staff are friendly 

The lovely bar is busy at night and its a good place to start the night !",4,2017,03,09
132,The holy grail of London hotels,"What can I say but OMG. I booked this hotel as I surprise trip for my wife's birthday. The staff and hotel made her birthday even more special. The rooms are amazing and so clean. We were greeted by really friendly staff who were actually happy and friendly and were not pretending to be pleasant as seen in some other hotels. When the staff found out it was my wife's birthday they all wished her happy birthday and made her feel so welcome. I would love to write every good point but it would take to long. There are no negative points from this stay. We have stayed at the Montcalm, Mayfair and the Arch but have now found our new home in London. All I can say is stay and experience a lovely hotel you will not regret it. I am so grateful to all the staff at the hotel who made this stay so special and I can not thank them enough. ",5,2017,03,09
132,Lovely hotel in a great location with funky decor,"We had a loft apartment room - on the first floor - it was very spacious, light and well designed.  I particularly like the bathroom area.  Sleep quality was overall good - although there were some noisy guests returning to their room in the early hours of the morning who clearly didn't know how to behave (drunken women ...) screaming in the corridor outside but I guess the hotel can't be responsible for that.  I particularly liked the residents only bar - a lovely place for a quiet drink. The main bar area looked nice and was full of people (which personally I don't enjoy) - it was great that this hotel had two options for a drink to appeal to different tastes.  I loved the decor throughout the hotel - really nicely done.  The staff were great - upbeat and happy - that is always nice to see.  We were celebrating our anniversary and really enjoyed being able to walk to the numerous restaurants and bars that were in close proximity to this hotel.",5,2017,03,08
132,Perfect stylish superbly positioned hotel,"Stayed here to celebrate my wife's birthday and wasn't disappointed. Philippe Starck has done a fab job on the interior. Hotels don't get more stylish than this. Our room, a junior suite, was massive with a well appointed walk in walk out en-suite behind net curtains. The bed was big enough for four people and very comfortable.

Loved the bars and dining areas. And the location was perfect just 2 minutes walk from Oxford St and surrounded by amazing bars and restaurants.

Will definitely return.",5,2017,03,07
132,Amazing 2-Week Stay at Sanderson!,"I am an event planner and travel quite a bit for work. I stay at hotels all across the world and really needed to take time out of my day to say that my stay at the Sanderson was one of the best I’ve ever had. Why? The customer experience was impeccable. From the moment I opened the door to the taxi upon my arrival to the moment I left, I felt like I was a part of a family – and as if your team really appreciated my staying there.
 
Jose at the front desk, in particular, was an absolute pleasure. We chatted every moment I had and he went out of his way to make sure I was enjoying every minute of my Sanderson experience. He was absolutely incredible! I was so impressed. Upon my recommendation, two of my coworkers also stayed at the Sanderson and also left loving Jose and the hotel! But not only that, the doormen were all so lovely and the bartenders downstairs began to recognize me (and knew my wine order!).

Though I did not have much of a view, the room was beautiful, the white draping felt very elegant, and I enjoyed having a sitting area where I could work and eat food. I am a big fan of Malin & Goetz - the only products they use at this hotel. Room service was quick and efficient. I would recommend getting breakfast included - it was a big draw for me (it includes a tasty buffet and one hot item). I plan to stay here every time I'm in London!",5,2017,03,06
132,Great place friendly staff,"Only good things to say! Great decor, beautiful bar and great ambience. The location is perfect great area to go out at night. The rooms are small but well appointed. I did not eat at the restaurant but it is always packed.",5,2017,03,05
132,excelent,This hotel is very luxury. Design and stuff very profesional.Rooms are just amazing and very clean. Housekeeping works really good. Nice food and location is in Oxford. So if you want shoping this is the right place to stay.,5,2017,03,04
132,Superb,"We've stayed several times and keep coming back. The location is excellent, just a few minutes' walk from Soho. The hotel service is always superb and the rooms are beautiful. Usually the rooms are very quiet although we've experienced a room next to the cleaner's store which was not. However we were immediately moved to another, quiet room when we mentioned this.",5,2017,03,04
132,Fantastic!,"I love this hotel. We came away for our anniversary and were treated special from start to finish. I would especially like to thank the receptionist. I never caught her name but she was Australian with blonde hair. She was extremely kind and lovely to talk to. She made our stay! Thankyou, we will def be back soon.",5,2017,02,27
132,Great contemporary hotel.,"This hotel is in the perfect location for a city break from London, just off Oxford Street.
It does not look much on the outside, but inside - WOW! Clean contemporary furnishings, spacious, well stocked bars and great restaurant. The breakfast was particularly impressive.
We were there for a special occasion and staff added a few extra touches that made it very memorable. ",5,2017,02,27
132,Gone downhill,"I have stayed at the Sanderson several times on business. Unfortunately, each experience has been worst than the last recently. This time there were several issues: 1) No one at the front desk upon check-in (for an 11am-ish arrival), 2) Front desk could not find my reservation and was very rude about... he finally did find it, and made no apology for his attitude, 3) I was in room 325 and it smelled like a bottle of cheap cologne had been spilled, 4) The end of the hallway where I stayed smelled like trash... which might explain the cheap cologne smell, as I suspect the hotel was pumping scents into the air to try and cover up the trash smell. 

Overall, location is good and the people who were in the restaurant are very kind and helpful. Other than that, there are better options in London. ",3,2017,02,27
132,Birthday Heaven,"My boyfriend booked a superior room for my Birthday weekend treat and the stay was exceptional from start to finish. We arrived early and they had a room available, it was spacious, light, exceptionally clean, just stunning! All the staff we came into contact with were so polite and helpful. We will definitely be back! ",5,2017,02,27
132,Perfect location - not satisfactory service at breakfast,"The location is perfect as theatres, nightlife and shopping are in walking distance.

We had a very quiet and large superior room on the 3rd floor with a very comfortable bed.

The check-in was very efficient and the staff is very friendly in all areas of the hotel. A big compliment to the housekeeping: the room was always very clean and the turn down service was excellent. 

The only not 5-star service is the breakfast service. There is a a la carte menu and a small, but exquisite bteakfast buffet. The service was three days in a row slow and we had to wait for coffee for 15 minutes - you don't want this in a 5-star hotel! There was enough staff and the breakfast room
was never full but it always took a lot of time or you had to ask twice or three times for your orders. They also did not take used plates and a table next to us was not cleaned during the whole breakfast. The same happened during lunch and the whole restaurant needs a much better service!",4,2017,02,26
132,Different but worth it,Its location makes it very easy to visit London. The design is different than you are used to. The room is an open space divided by curtains. There is no closet but there is a place to hang and keep your clothes. The service is very polite and fast. The only thing I didn't like it is that the safe box located very low on the ground. Every time you want to use it you have to bend on your knees. I am sure some will not be able to use at all.,4,2017,02,26
132,Mostly Well looked after ,"We stayed on a Monday night away without kids in a superior room. 

Hotel is in a great location for Oxford street shopping, rooms and hotel are minimal but funky. I had told them in advance that it was my wife's birthday and they kindly put a birthday message/cake in our room and bottle of bubbly which was a lovely touch/surprise.

The hotel generally could do with a lick of paint. That said you have to be fairly picky to notice that.

The only minus point was the breakfast. There was no real welcome and the staff didn't really seem to know who was supposed to be doing what. It wasn't explained what was in the included breakfast, we were sat for over 5 mins without a menu and 10 mins for a drink. As you can see the kitchen from the tables we could see when our food was ready. It then sat on the side for 5 mins whilst several staff walked past it not really doing anything. Unsurprisingly when it did arrive it was cold.

Sort the breakfast and it's a great hotel..",4,2017,02,25
132,Totally Awesome,"We went for our 10 year anniversary and had such a wonderful time here.  The staff are so kind, so friendly and incredibly helpful.  The food was fantastic and the room luxurious and very comfortable.  I liked it so much that booked to stay again in a double double room with a friend and our two children 3 weeks later.  Having just returned from this stay, which was also amazing, we are planning our next trip.  They made the children feel so special and the little cakes that they left in our room were so thoughtful and mouth watering after a night on the tiles!  Thank you to everyone.",5,2017,02,24
132,Good staff,"The hotel location is perfect ... it's surrounded by a lot at activities.
The staff are really friendly ... smiling ... helpful... I can name Sophie  at the bar and Reciption manager Nigel .. and Jose .
",5,2017,02,24
132,Excellent service: Gaby,"We just arrived at the Sanderson hotel And its absolutely amazing!

A big thank you to Gaby! His excellent service and warm welcome made us feel like home.

Looping forward to A wunderful stay in the Sanderson!

Astrid and Joy 
",5,2017,02,23
132,Excellent As Always ,"The Sanderson is our go to London hotel. Location is excellent and the service is fantastic too. The hotel is super cool and the staff are always so helpful and proactive with our baby (now toddler). They also provide Handy phones for your stay now which is life changing! So lovely to navigate google maps with no worries of high roaming charges and see the suggested tips and places to go. 
The rooms are always lovely and the beds are super comfortable. Surprisingly baby friendly for a modern hotel, the bathroom curtains push all the way back so that you can see into the room through the glass wall and keep and eye on your kids!!! 
",5,2017,02,22
132,Sanderson is the Best,I travel quite a bit and wish there was a Sanderson in every city that I travel to. Everything about the hotel is top notch and it is almost like being at home. Not sure it could be any better I had built it myself.,5,2017,02,14
132,An impromptu romantic weekend,"Decided to go up to London last minute and were delighted that the Sanderson had room given our previous experience. We opted for the deluxe room again which is fabulous, very big with a sumptuous bathroom (smoked screen shower, seperate large bath, dressing gowns etc etc) and overlooking the lovely Japenese gardens. We arrived early on the Saturday morning and walked the 2 minutes to Oxford street and hit the shops before it got busy. After lunch we just chilled in the room and then went down for pre-dinner drinks in the hotel bar which is ultra cool and atmospheric.....lots of people enjoying their cocktails but still managed to grab a couple of seats at the bar, there must be 50 in total so plenty of room. Enjoyed a couple of cocktails (average London prices £10 - £15 depending on content) all served with a smile and then retired back to the room for room service and a film. The great thing with the Sanderson is that after enjoying the second to none location (Soho and Convent Garden are less than a 10 minute walk away), the lovely rooms and service is that when you wake up you get to have their breakfast which I would suggest is the best served in a London hotel. A huge supply of cold meats and cheese, cereals, yoghurts, fresh fruit, a dozen different breads and croissants, any kind of coffee or tea of your choosing is followed by a fabulous choice of hot breakfasts......from the traditional full English to eggs benedict and everything in between. I could have sat there all day! In conclusion, If you're looking to be right where the action is, be that shopping, theatreland or just eating and soaking up the atmosphere, I would call the Sanderson first, they have it all.",5,2017,02,14
132,Amazing anniversary stay! ,"We stayed here for a night for our 20th anniversary and had an amazing time and felt utterly spoilt!

The hotel upgraded our room, surprised us with champagne and cake being sent to our room and covered the bed in fresh rose petals! They also surprised us with cake and an anniversary message at dinner.

The room was lovely with everything you could need and more. 

All of the staff were very friendly and couldn't be more helpful, and the welcome from reception was second to none.

The modern design of the hotel is impressive but unfussy and I loved the lifts, with their astronomical theme!

We have stayed in a LOT of hotels and this was five star at its very best. 

We will definitely return! ",5,2017,02,12
132,"Excellent, centrally located design hotel","I've stayed at the Sanderson a handful of times now and every time has been an enjoyable experience. Most recently (and usually) we stay in a superior room and on our last visit was upgraded to the deluxe room on arrival - nice. Most notable difference being that the deluxe is clearly bigger, has a bath and separate vanity area off the bedroom area.

Pros:

It's a really cool place - That's the short version of what I tell people when I tell them whyI stay here, very subjective but take that as you will and I do think at from certain perspectives through out the hotel you could say it looks like its out of a film. It has the external appearance that reminds of an old Russian building but from the entranceway into the lobby that perception quickly shifts and you're brought into a hotel that's light, airy and design centred with a host of irregular chairs, curtains and a portrait painting of a very composed chihuahua off to the far side.

Great Service - They do think you wouldn't (hopefully shouldn't) normally expect - I've checked into a room at 9am on once occasion, have had at least 2 rooms upgraded and when checking in on the last visit they said if you want some extra time to leave Saturday afternoon, it's no problem just let them know.

Rooms - Great bathrooms with separate shower room and toilet off the main room. The wall between the bathroom and bed area is glass so twin with people you either trust or like. Having said there are curtains which lend for some comedy value the first time you come to this realisation. Beds are outstanding as are the minimalist but comfortable furnishings and the table area and 3/4 chaise lounge are great to sit and work around or eat something. There's something to be said about lighting in the rooms as well; loads of ambient lighting, above the windows in the bathroom and even in the glass shelves - all lends itself to a lovely ambience with the light white curtains. There's great little details I'll come to next -

Very considered - From the candle someone comes in and lights on a night in your bathroom, to the USB wall sockets, to the 'designer' free weights I made use of on the wall to the free android phone left in the room, to the person that came by around 8pm to ask if I wanted any water or anything else they clearly put a lot of thought into their service. On once occasion I came across a member of staff in the room as I was arriving just to check that everything was in order (not a cleaner), maybe that's standard at this level but first and only time I've seen it was here. Possibly part of the reason why it's also super clean -

Super Clean Rooms - I'm talking a clean you can see. Everything (bed, tables, bathroom sink, etc) is off the ground on legs and the floors are solid natural materials (wood, stone tiles). I dropped something behind a table against a wall and I went to pick it up off the floor with natural caution and it was spotless. Anything shiny was polished and all the glass (shelves, walls, there's lots) is spotless as are the shower rooms.

Location - Yep it's great for getting around SOHO, 50 meters or so from Oxford Street yet set back enough that it's not main road busy.

Bars - Lots of great cocktails on hand, a resident DJ was there on our stay. Two bars - the long bar for everyone and the purple bar for residents. The latter was much less busy and perfect place to chill out before returning to the room.

Cons

It's really a hard call, I had to think about why I don't always book the Sanderson when I come to the city -

Facilities - It doesn't have a steam room/sauna or pool. When I'm travelling with people that aren't bothered by their absence I usually stay here. It does have a spa for treatments etc.

Loyalty Programme - Not a big deal but if you like collecting points like me then it's a bit of a push here as there is no such system. Having said that, I've benefitted from early checkins and upgrades beyond what I've been able to do with other hotel chains and points so I've gotten over my need to collect 'points'. They know that you've visited before.

It was nice to return to the Sanderson after not having been for a few months and I will now continue to return when I go to the city as I was reminded why I liked it so much., 

Hope you find my thoughts useful!",5,2017,02,11
132,Very nice hotel,"Stayed one night to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and she was very happy. Has the wow factor that comes with a 5 star hotel and all of the staff we spoke to were friendly and helpful. Excellent location just off of Oxford Street. We stayed in a 'superior' room which was spacious and well designed, if it had a bathtub though it would have been even better. Great stay overall!",5,2017,02,06
132,Modern hotel in a central location,"i was there for 4 nights and enjoyed my stay. Had minor issue - I've requested a fridge to host my special diet items and didn't get one. The hotel staff are extremely kind and willing to help, however left me with a minibar which is a cooler and not a fridge. 
",4,2017,02,05
132,Husbands birthday treat,"From the beginning of starting this trip I was very impressed at the amount of customer service this hotel prides itself on.
I left a couple of questions on here which were answered swiftly and informative.
I had dropped a email on the main site and Paris and Celia( guest relations) were extremely helpful and attentive to making our visit special.
We received a upgrade when I said I was planning a special trip and in the evening we were presented with a bottle of champagne and cake for hubby's birthday.
Yes the exterior of the hotel doesn't look much but it's kinda like a hotel Kinder egg once you step inside you're faced with a funky and modern furnished reception with very friendly receptionists who are on hand to make your stay wonderful.
The decor is rather wonderful with random pieces of exclusive   furniture dotted about. The elevator is something spectacular, it's like walking into a space galaxy, felt very 3D and defiantly something different.
The hallways are a little dark but I think it flows into the hotels ambiance with when you walk into your room you immediately appreciate the light, fresh and airy feel.
We stayed in a deluxe room and the bed was big and very comfortable, the decor is very light and there is a very relaxed feel.
There are various amenities avaliable in your room, lovely toiletries, bathrobes and slippers, a 4g phone for you to use as a map/guide of London ( as a non city couple we definitely needed the help to get around London) 
There are also various items you can purchase in your room, mini bar, snacks, also  toiletry items you may of forgotten to bring.
Hotel is pretty much in the heart of the West end so ideal for theatre visits, with many restaurants in walking distance.
We did not use the restaurant in the hotel this time as we had lots of things planned for the day but it seemed pretty busy so I would probably suggest booking if you're on a tight schedule.

So Thank you Sanderson team for looking after us and making our trip special. I always feel if you have a great team working in a hotel the guests will feel super special which we did.

We will definitely be booking again soon. 

",5,2017,02,04
132,Cute and convenient,"This hotel is conveniently located. The bar downstairs is great, as is the food in the restaurant. Staff is super accommodating, nice and helpful! Housekeeping is on point. I have stayed here 3 times last year and plan on being back in March. Sanderson, you never disappoint!",5,2017,02,03
132,"Painfully stylish, annoyingly underlit ","This place looks like a dingy fifties office building outside but inside it's painfully stylish. Lobby full of furniture which you have to plan how you're going to get out of. Lifts are really dark with starscape decor - with wet steamed up spectacles, some light would've been welcome. Corridors are tokenly lit too, most of the light come from light box room numbers in the floor outside each door - I thought the emergency lighting was on!

 I had a 'loft' room which was vast. As you walk into the rooms, a curtain blocks your way which is a pain if you have luggage and it took some fabric flinging to find the light switches - my colleagues reported the same obstructions.

If you suffer from OCD don't stay here - the beds are at angle in the middle of the room. Bathrooms are glass with drapes for privacy and there was no proper wardrobe,  just a rail in the dressing area.

All was very beautifully styled but a chair in the dressing area would have been welcome and a hook in the shower useful. Oh and if you want to make a cuppa in your room you have to ring up for the equipment - I guess it makes the place untidy if it's just left in the room for guests to make one when they fancy.

Staff were very attentive and there seemed to be plenty, all with very specific duties ie concierge, rather than get my bag from the store, walked twice the distance to get a bell hop to fetch it and don't try to place a breakfast order with the lady who brings your tea/coffee, that is someone else's job.

If you care about style, this is the place for you but I felt a few comfort touches were missing, as mentioned. Oh yes, don't go the 'wrong' side of payday either!",4,2017,02,01
132,Lovely long weekend stay at this hotel  ,"Lovely modern hotel , we spent a long weekend at this hotel , would recommend to many , breakfast is lovely and staff are great . location is perfect close to oxford street and great food. Definitely recommend. ",5,2017,01,31
132,Winter break,"We stayed here mid January for a little winter break,came across this hotel through a recommendation and we were not disappointed . The room was very spacious ( for London ),the staff were very helpful and friendly . The hotel was a very modern place with some quirky touches, the breakfast was particularly good. The hotel is on a quite street just off Oxford st. so handy for shopping etc.i would stay here again.",5,2017,01,30
132,Great for a Spa Weekend in London,"We had the most amazing time at this hotel in London. The Sixties exterior of the hotel belies the exciting modern interior. The room was beautiful, as was the delicious breakfast we enjoyed the next morning. We went out to see a show that evening and were absolutely delighted to return to our room and find a chilled bottle of champagne and macaroons in our room, along with a note from Guiseppe on the Front Desk, as it was a special occasion.  It was a lovely surprise and really made our weekend.  The Nuxe Spa was gorgeous and we felt so pampered whilst having our treatments there. Can recommend the Peak Botanical Relaxation Massage - amazing. All the staff in the hotel and spa were very welcoming and helpful. We will certainly be recommending this hotel to everyone as ""the place"" to stay whilst in London.",5,2017,01,30
132,Superb. Memorable. Flawless.,"This hotel really has it all - central location, superb staff, service, comfort, decor, ambience - and all a very skilfully curated package. It manages that all too elusive trick of combining big hotel efficiency with a very personalised experience. We were made to feel right at home from the moment of our arrival and throughout our short stay.   I will certainly adopt The Sanderson as my go-to for future visits to London.",5,2017,01,29
132,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed 3 night's in this wonderful hotel. Every thing in the hotel is meant to give the gest's a great stay. 
You can ask for a coffee and tea kit for free, in the room await a cellular phone free . The long bar and restaurant are great. ",5,2017,01,29
132,Check there is not a party night booked before you confirm.,"Good location, friendly staff. Well appointed room, although no tea or coffee in our package. Our stay was the same night as some sort of party night, which blasted loud music until the late evening, and numbers of drunk revellers to negotiate to find the lifts. Not really a Spa hotel vibe. ",2,2017,01,29
132,Fab and fresh,Just had super stay at the Sanderson. Decor is chic and fresh. Staff are friendly and helpful and there is a relaxed atmosphere. Attention to detail deserving of its 5* status with being bound by stuffy pretentiousness. Great hotel. ,5,2017,01,28
132,Fresh and contemporary,Interesting decor and a warm friendly welcome from staff. Great atmosphere and attention to detail that make this a true 5• hotel. A bit on the pricey side but I guess that's just London for you. Would stay here again.,5,2017,01,28
132,Fantastic hotel. ,"First off I would like to thank Sanderson hotel for making my wife's 21+9 birthday a couple of days she'll never forget. 

When we arrived the concierge and check in staff were wonderful. 
We arrived a little earlier ( 3hours) but one of the rooms was already ready. 

Each evening we were offered a dress down service which made the room nice a cozy. 

The room was fantastic and had great black out blinds, to help you have a good night sleep after the miles of walking around shops. 

On my wife's birthday night they sent her a bottle of champagne and a lovey piece of cake so again thank you for this.

Hotel is a 5 min walk to oxford street  

The only thing I would change is 
The shower - a bit fiddly to get the correct temperature and the shower head doesn't really give you a great coverage

Apart from that this hotel I well worth a stay. ",5,2017,01,25
132,a different vibe in January,"This is my 5th stay (and 3rd review) of the Sanderson. It's that worth it. The hotel is as usually described - a modern, ""trendy"" hotel just north of Soho, in a central location. But, while the hotel has its unique architectural quirks, its the staff that make this a gem.

I was greeted by name, the staff asked if my wife was joining me as well (as they had met on earlier trips), they had already moved me to a room in a part of the hotel that I prefer, etc.

The new (to me) concierge Diago was able to point me to several great dining spots nearby that would be more convenient to me as a solo traveler, as opposed to all the group dinners I've had there on prior trips.

The location is N of Soho, about an 8 minute walk to this great area, and just a few more down the Piccadilly theatre district. Fitzrovia keeps adding new restaurants nearby, even closer.

In January the vibe of the hotel is different than Summer - fewer younger parties in the long bar, a more mature clientele of couples and also more families with smaller children enjoying the off season.

",5,2017,01,23
132,A very special hotel,"Very charming hotel in Soho, very close to Oxford Street and theaters. A few minutes walk to Piccadilly  Circus, Trafalgar Square and National Gallery.
Excellent restaurant and the best bar for a happy hour.
I strongly recommend.",5,2017,01,22
132,Good hotel- a bit dated though,"Great location near Oxford Circus. Hotel is uber-modern and a little played out. Almost trying too hard. I've stayed in other hotels of this brand (Clift, Delano etc.) and they're nice... but really extreme modernism. Across the street is the London Edition; its so much more warm and nuanced but that's just my preference.
Room is big enough. Had zero view.
Service was fine though I really just slept there; didn't use bar, restaurant etc.
Wouldn't be my first pick to return to London but if you get a good price its a good option.",4,2017,01,20
132,Unique ,"Stayed here for one night with my daughter ,very different , lift was like been in a space  a lot of stars and dark , hallways dark your number of your room is on the floor .room is very see through clear curtains and clear glass in the shower and toilet , bed is comfortable , room service was nice and warm , great location as within walking distance to oxford street ",4,2017,01,20

132,"Superb location, beautiful hotel!","We really enjoyed our stay here. Room was beautiful, spacy and functional! Nice and autentive staff. They were helpful but not pushy. Great vibe in the hotel. It was classy but not formal, as many 5 star hotels can be! Very cool bars and also a quality gym. Excellent location in/near Soho! Hopefully we'll be back!",5,2017,01,17
132,Spa Review,On arrival had to fill out a personalised survey was then led to the changing area. The spa is a complete oasis. Wonderful Cure Facial with Julia who was a complete pro advising me on my skin and a follow up program. Spent some time afterwards in my own pod with a green tea... wonderful experience and will be back very soon. Team should be very proud.,5,2017,01,16

132,Fantastic stay!! ,"Stayed here for one night with my partner in May and thoroughly enjoyed our stay! 

Easy location to get to from Euston and close to tube stations!

Hotel itself is lovely, our room was huge with every amenity thought of! The bathroom was just as big with the most amazing bath! 

Spent time in the long bar which was great, fantastic drinks menu and lively atmosphere! 

Staff were extremely helpful throughout our stay! 

Would most definitely recommend for couples of any age!! ",4,2017,01,15
132,Outstanding!,"Stayed for one night at this absolutely glorious hotel. It is a quirky hotel, very popular with the 'younger crowd' and the Mad Hatters afternoon tea is very popular! The decor, the rooms, even the lifts, are very different but make for a very interesting stay! But most of all the greatest thing this hotel has is it's staff - they are the best! Nothing is too much trouble, they are vigilant, helpful, and every little detail is looked after from the minute you walk through the doors - Jose the doorman was excellent and this followed through with EVERY member of staff! From the main bar where we sat and spent the afternoon, to the purple bar for residents on our return from the threatre (the young lady in the purple bar was excellent and very attentive, but we didn't get her name!), to the restaurant where we ate before the theatre - every member of staff was polite and attentive. The rooms were comfortable, clean and we slept well. The only thing I would change about the rooms is tea and coffee making facilities - there weren't any! We booked breakfast in our room, unfortunately only one breakfast arrived, but this was dealt with immediately and a second breakfast arrived within half an hour and we were telephoned by the floor manager who apologised and told us the second breakfast would be free. Customer service at it's best! A brilliant hotel and if you're looking for great service, this is the one to go to!",5,2017,01,15
132,Uber cool decor in a central location ,"I loved everything about our stay at this hotel - the central location close to Soho and Oxford St, the super cool interior, friendly and helpful staff, comfy pillows not to mention a delicious breakfast menu!

i recommended this one specially ... i will back!i lve the situation near shopping , restaurants & because when i finished my work it's easy to walk around and take enjoy time ",5,2017,01,14
132,Clean decadence - you must book!,Loved our stay here. We were celebrating our anniversary. The staff at the long bar were attentive and willing to talk you through any cocktail they had on the menu whilst offering suggestions according to your tastes. The white drapes mixed with quirky furrnishings made you feel relaxed whilst aware you're in a modern trendy hotel. I loved the white drapes and frosted glass everywhere including in our room. If I had one negative - it would be the toilets off of the restaurant - very industrial and dated - it needs frosted glass & drapes! A celeb worthy hotel. Gorgeous.,5,2017,01,10
132,Sparkling New Year at Sanderson,I enjoyed very much my experience at Sanderson. The location is fantastic and the room are really beautiful; the staff is kind and the products of the spa very good quality. I strongly recommend the spa. ,5,2017,01,10

Sorting a great table in the bar for a surprise drinks gathering of my wife's best friends: Yes.
Late checkout without us even asking: Yes.
Will we be back?

I had mentioned the nature of the trip beforehand and were given an upgrade as well as a complimentary bottle of Champagne to celebrate. I'd certainly recommend the Mad Hatters afternoon tea and drinks in the Long Bar. Just an extra mention to Nigel (the front manager) who made the stay all worthwhile. Dave and Julie,5,2017,01,06
132,Incredible!!! ,"Absolutely loved everything about our stay,  from the moment we were greeted by the doorman, to our treatments at the agua spa.. Outstanding!! 
Stayed with my mum for one night as a treat. Our room was amazing, so spacious. We ate out, but came back for cocktails in the purple bar later in the evening. 
Before we checked out the following day, we had a visit to the spa planned, I've been to alot of spas nationwide and this was without a doubt the best I've seen. The attention to detail.. Chair beds to chill out in after your treatments, and i even got a birthday cake as they noticed on the consultation form my birthday was the day before, really nice touch. We were left to relax for as long as we needed. Fantastic from start to finish. 
Will definitely visit again ",5,2017,01,05
132,Exellent experience,"A party of 7 had a two nigths stay at this exellent hotel. With a great location close to Oxford street, really impressive service and also very nice rooms with lots of exciting details on interior there is not very much more to say than - fantastic 👍😄",5,2017,01,05
132,21st celebration,"Stayed at the Sanderson hotel in London after wanting to book a special weekend away in the centre of London. Arrived earlier than check in time and the receptionist was very accommodating in offering us an available room. The room was spacious with quirky features. Bathroom was amazing, and so was the comfort of the bed! After going out and arriving back at the hotel we found complimentary champagne which was a lovely touch. Definitely try a cocktail at the long bar! Overall would definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2017,01,05
132,Great location! Bar area,"Came here for one night as we were going to see the bodyguard (great show must see) we had the terrace room which was really nice, location is great walking distance from everything. The bar area is amazing really good drinks and they do have another bar for hotel guests only that open till later so if you want to stay out till later you can, they also have a pool table and service was amazing. Def recommend staying there.",5,2017,01,04
132,London trip,Fantastic location. Close to shops and restaurants. Rooms and bathroom were spacious. The staff were very helpful and made us feel welcomed. We had breakfast at the hotel but did not avail of the spa facilities. Will make sure to visit it the next time we're there. Thank you fro a lovely stay.,5,2017,01,03
132,Brilliant!!,Stayed here for 2 nights with my husband for New Years Eve & we were very impressed. From start to finish a very pleasurable stay. The staff were very friendly & helpful at all times. The breakfast was fantastic & quite a nice & extensive menu. Adrian & Paris were also extremely helpful & very good front of house. We'll certainly be coming back again.,5,2017,01,01
132,A wonderful Stay,"We have stayed at various Morgans Group hotels over the years whether in the U.K. Or abroad, and I must say that the Sanderson in now one of my favourite. The staff were very attentive, polite and  charming who took care of any problems we may have experienced immediately.
Thank you for a fantastic stay over Christmas.",5,2016,12,30
132,Girls night out! ,"Room great, couldn't be faulted. We had a double double room, as four friends sharing, it was clean, comfortable and very well equipped. Staff all friendly and professional, cooked breakfast acceptable, but could be improved, cold juices and fruit good selection. Both bars were sampled on our night out and could not be faulted. 
My criticism, was the toilets off to the side of the reception desk. Not checked enough, poor quality paintwork, chipped badly, locks, flush, general impression poor. Made the walk to our room for the rest of the evening. Let down the hotel.  ",4,2016,12,22
132,Truly wonderful customer service. ,"The finest attention to detail I have experienced. 
The Sanderson and their superb team is without doubt the best experience anyone can have while staying in London. 

Nothing is to much trouble.
From the moment you walk in the door and smell the gorgeous, unique aroma, the guys take your bags and say welcome back, you know you are somewhere special. 

The spa and facilities are everything you would expect of a top hotel. 

But the reason for their continued success for providing the very best hospitality anywhere, is with their dedicated members of staff.
Special mentions to Paris and Diogo, who between them arranged a most magical Christmas for my wife and I.

Nothing was to much trouble. The attention to detail, and all my requests were carried out with such enthusiasm and care. 
However, the crowning glory being on our last morning, when Paris organised for it to 'snow' on our terrace!! 
Truly magnificent and very much appreciated, by my shrieking and 'bursting with excitement' wife, when it started snowing for 30 mins.

The Sanderson is a very special place for us. 
Every time we come back, there is always something new to admire and enjoy.
Thank you once again, for organising our three night Christmas break. 
It was very special, so many magical and wonderful memories, all because of your care and attention to detail, thank you.

132,Top hotel,Great location close Oxford street and walking distance to major tourist places. Amazing breakfast with all kinds of food. Rooms very comfortable and clean. Best vacation in London. We  will be back for sure !,5,2016,12,19
132,Great Hotel.. Great Vibe,"We stayed for just one Saturday night in December, in a Superior double room, on the 5th floor. Great location, just off Oxford Street and easy walk to all the main areas in London.
First of all, the staff are friendly and 1st class... from the moment we arrived to leaving at the end of the trip.. can't fault them.. from door staff to bar staff..great.
We checked in around 10am and the room was ready for us.
The room was modern light clean and airy, the bed seems to be hoovering.. all white and crisp.. grey and yellow flooring. seating area with table and chairs. walk into area with walk in shower.. frosting glass toilet and shower room. with dressing area with robes and slippers. Hair dryer, TV. Fridge and room safe. I loved the room, but my partner said it was a bit clinical for him.
We found the best thing about the hotel is the vibe, after a day around London it was great to get back and not need to go out looking for nightlife as it's all happening in the Long Bar and Purple Lounge.  We had DJ's in the Long Bar, the bar was busy with lots of great people. Mixed age group. After the Long Bar closed we headed into the Purple Bar and Pool room.. we left at 3am and it was still happening..
The rate we had booked included a breakfast, which we can't fault. My partner had Steak and I had French Toast, it was hard to choose as so many nice things to pick from.
I have been to the Sanderson back in the summer for the Mad Hatter Afternoon Tea, which again I can recommend..
Will be back at this hotel again soon...",5,2016,12,19
132,Still the Best in London!!,"This is the only hotel I will stay in while in London!  I can't say enough good things about it, but I will try.  From the moment you walk in the door, you are greeted by the doormen and the front desk staff who are fabulous and remember you!  The bar staff is also wonderful.  They make delicious drinks and offer up amazing suggestions based on what you need.
I also had an issue with one of the black-out shades in my room and within 15 mins, someone was there to fix it.  The beds are super comfy and the showers are great - 2 key requirements for me when travelling. 
Every time I stay at the Sanderson, I know it will be a wonderful visit!",5,2016,12,19
132,One of a king,"Great pleasure. Great staff and superb service. Be sure to try out the spa. Location so good you need not look any further. We absolutely loved the Sanderson, awaiting to come again. London at its best.",5,2016,12,19
132,wedding Anniversary Trip,"the hotel was amazing.. the room was big and modern, nice bathtub and large bathroom, the room views are not special as they are all looking over the street. 

the staff were nice, supportive especially the concierge. they gave us maps and helped us planning our tour in the city.

the big red bus is a must to do.

the location is excellent as its very close to oxford street and all the shopping shops. there are 2 close underground metro stations, oxford is the main one to use.

its a secure area and multicultural friendly.

lots of shops and restaurants around if you haven't bought breakfast with the stay.

wifi is free.",4,2016,12,19
132,Fantastic stay,"My partner and I stayed for two nights. Everything was made so special for us, from the upgrade to champagne in our room. The room was amazing, biggest room I've stayed in in London, beautiful decor. The bar had a great buzz, and the breakfast was fantastic. Great location, and  very handy the hotel has a car, they dropped us off for dinner. The staff were lovely, everyone was wonderful. It was a real treat staying there, and we will definitely stay there again.",5,2016,12,19
132,Sanderon is the tops,"Sanderson is, without a doubt, my favorite hotel in the world. An attentive staff, a unique atmosphere created by Philipe Starck, and a location perfectly situated in central London all combine for a superlative experience.",5,2016,12,17
132,Favourite hotel in London,"love this hotel, great location amazing service, rooms have the ideal mix of style and comfort and great vibe in the long bar. The spa is also amazing, this is definitely our favourite hotel in London.
",5,2016,12,17
132,We tried others there no comparison,superb staff and hotel stayed here over ten times. We love the service the welcome the experience. We have tried many others but always come back. So now we just come here every chance we have. If you haven't tried it you should,5,2016,12,16
132,My favourite hotel in London,"The Sanderson is fabulous. The rooms are modern, spacious, spotlessly clean, comfortable and well appointed and the location is excellent. The staff are friendly, welcoming and incredibly helpful. I find the concierge service to be outstanding, particularly Biken Urkiri. The spa is beautiful. There is no fuss or grandeur (which suits me) but there is simple luxury and pure relaxation. Not my first visit and won't be my last. Highly recommended.",5,2016,12,16
132,Best Spa Visit Ever,"I booked a pyjama package as a treat for me and my mum for my mum's birthday. The staff were amazingly accommodating and friendly, even having a surprise birthday cake for my mum that I didn't even ask for! The facilities were spectacular, felt so relaxed and special and would definitely go back again or recommend",5,2016,12,13
132,Not for the faint hearted,"Not one of the better places to stay, close to Regent street and has a car park(beware leaking pipes over your car) but that is all I can stay. Staff are very courteous and polite but I felt they were  constantly trying to upsell, offering an upgrade to your room as ours wasn't ready then once you say yes thank you very much you get hit with a couple of hundred pounds extra going on your bill unless you are willing to stand and argue in reception. Room loud both inside and out , very poor insulation and not everything worked in the room. We were so fed up with noise and felt annoyed about check in fiasco so we packed and left without trying breakfast. Issue with car parking on leaving with the car park wanting payment again. Bell Captain was fabulous though and sorted out the bill for us. Sorry Sanderson not one of the better hotels in the group. Mondrian in LA is streets ahead ",2,2016,12,11
132,The best in London!!,"Stayed there for 3 nights and was a perfect experience, the room, the facilities, services, the crew (really kind and helpful), the location... highly recommended!! Special thanks to Biken who follow up with me during me stay in London and recommended the coolest places. 
",5,2016,12,10
132,When funky loses its funk,"There was a time, only a few years ago when the Sanderson was a hip spot in a cool part of town. Those days are gone. 
The hotel is looking tired and tattered, the Starck design elements look sadly out of date. 
We were upgraded to a ""loft suite"" which was neither a suite or loft-like. The room was so poorly lit that you couldn't see to find anything after the sun went down. It was surrounded in curtains that let the sun poor in at first light making a sleep in impossible. 
We've enjoyed many of Morgan properties. They tend to have a staff with a certain attitude, which you tolerate, because you feel pleased that you're ""cool enough"" to have been accepted as a guest. The haughty attitude at the Sad-erson doesn't quite cut it though. 
To maintain their reputation, and continue to charge the big bucks. This hotel badly needs a serious makeover!!  We found ourselves hanging out at the Edition hotel across the street, it had the vibe and class lacking at the Sanderson...next time we'll stay there. 
",2,2016,12,08
132,Wonderful Stay,"A friend and I recently stayed at the Sanderson - I've stayed at a few Morgan's hotels and love the party vibe and clean white aesthetic. 

The rooms are airy and the beds are comfortable - my favourite part of the hotel however is the Long Bar - that could tell a few tales I'm sure! 

We didn't stay for breakfast - but have heard it's nice. 

Look forward to returning.",5,2016,12,08
132,"Expensive, but great if we exclude the breakfast","The room can’t be described in a different way than lovely. The bed was just amazing. I want to come back.

The desk in the room was surprisingly perfect to work at and there was luckily an extension cord in room to charge your device. The number of outlets were very few.

The check-in and out was smooth, and the staff in the reception was extremely helpful. The lobby was a bit too designed for me, I prefer a more crowded space.

So, what happened with the breakfast? If you start serving breakfast at 0630 then you should be done with the cleaning, I don't want to hear a hoover. And the breakfast food should be in place, not arrive 0655 when I left the breakfast. And the bread, cheese, fruit etc. was on the level that you find on the 3rd class hotel in the US Midwest. And the breakfast is top-5 of the most important things at a hotel.",4,2016,12,06
132,Feels like Home ,"We always stay at the Sanderson every time we visit London. I love this boutique feel Hotel. The staff remember your name, and are so warm and friendly. Service is excellent and their recommendations for restaurant to where to cut your hair, is always perfect. A very different ambiance then other hotels, similar to the Delano in Miami. Very trendy. Not for children. Not for over 70 either. The bar is packed almost every night, great socializing.",5,2016,12,04
132,Spacious rooms and good location ,I chose this hotel largely due to the generous room size in comparison to similarly priced central London hotels. It didn't disappoint. The hotel itself is quite quirky with interesting rooms and pieces of furniture. Rooms are clean and spacious. Service was generally good. Great location near to Oxford street and other points of interest. Would use again. ,5,2016,12,04
132,Sanderson ,"I stayed at this hotel for my evening out in London to watch Aladdin. 

The hotel is in a good location, very modern urban hotel clean and friendly staff. 

The rooms are nice and big everything was white and the shower and bathroom is very nice. ",5,2016,12,04
132,Weekend break ,"The Sanderson was booked by my partner for a birthday weekend get a way! The staff were so warm and welcoming and made my birthday extra special by helping my boyfriend prepare the room for our arrival. The bar at night was fun and busy with a great atmosphere and very enthusiastic staff to enhance the night. 
Breakfast buffet had a wide range of foods to choose from, definitely something for everyone. 
All in all nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff members to help you with. 
Thank you for a fabulous weekend away, will hopefully visiting again in the future! ",5,2016,12,03
132,Second trip : therefore high praise,"When we decided to make a trip to London we automatically choose The Sanderson from previous good experience of stays there . Location, hotel standard, staff behaviour all exemplary . Love the gym and spa and will use this hotel again when next visiting ",5,2016,11,30
132,Being one of the Gold Sponsors of Barclays Year end Tennis Tournament stayed in Sanderson,"Superb location, nice rooms, super mattress and pillows, decoration was very modern, cosmic atmosphere elevators. Walking distance to all shopping areas and special brands. And accessible to various Metro stations. Even walking distance to Covent Garden. The only negative aspect of the hotel was the service quality and the content of the Breakfast.",4,2016,11,30
132,Great hotel with nice design touches,"I liked the hotel. 
Modern and nicely designed rooms. 
Very good service and very competent staff.
I disliked the sound isolation level. Sounds in the corridor penetrate too easily in the room imho.
I stayed in room 409. The room was very clean. The bathroom was very nice, I liked the half-open set-up of it.
As a gin-tonic lover I was a bit dissapointed that the hotelbar only had standard Schweppes tonic and no premium tonic available. 
The breakfast was really nice with a lot of choice, don't forget to ask for some hot breakfast dishes.",4,2016,11,27
132,"Gorgeous Hotel, superbly located for Oxford Street shopping trip","My daughter and I stayed here on Black Friday as we had a shopping trip planned. The hotel is very conveniently located close to both Oxford and Regent Street and also Oxford Circus tube station.
The hotel itself is very stylish. Our room, which was only a standard room was very clean, modern and comfortable. Lovely complimentary toiletries provided by Malin & Goetz too.
I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,11,27
132,Faultless ,"Having visited the wonderful long bar several times we decided to stay. Really great hotel in a convenient location for everything in the west end. The staff were very courteous and helpful, the surroundings refreshingly modern and stylish and the room rate, particularly as it was inclusive of breakfast was, for this part of the world, very reasonable indeed. Will certainly be returning. ",5,2016,11,27
132,Last moment night in London ,"So we were not expecting to stay in London Friday, but needed to do this little as a last moment booking.
I turned up 6.30pm sweaty & harassed & late for the opera. Thanks to the reception guy for  sorting a check in complication.
Lucky he did as we actually made it to the wrong Opera house & made it to the other on time. Yes - our life can be chaos!
Anyway I've been to this hotel before when I took my Mum for afternoon tea. Which was fab, however it's not an externally pretty build, so it may put a hotel room reservation off. 
Don't be put off. The hotel is trendy, cool & well designed. It's quiet & calming. 
One of the best stays we have had in a while. It's not for the elderly or those looking for cheap accommodation but it is very cool.
We booked a basic room & we were upgraded without asking on a Friday eve to a loft room. 
The room was fab & we needed to check out late due to work calls - no problem!
Room service was quick & the quality was good.
Cant fault this place. Cool. Calm. Stylish. But most of all - great service.
It may end up being. Regular retreat for us.
Well done & yes I did survive a whole days shopping. Just.

",5,2016,11,26
132,Not for me,"Tried out the hotel for the first time since my friend managed to get me a corporate rate.  

I wouldn't say it was a bad hotel, but the very dark lift and the bathroom being an open one (with just a blind you can draw) just didn't do it for me.  Bar on ground floor was lively and breakfast was decent but the hotel just didn't click for me.  

In my recent London trips (I go 6-7 times a year for business) I have stayed at different hotels and for me the better options was one at Jermyn Street (very convenient to do some shopping) or one at Strand (convenient to take tube to City for meetings and near Covent Garden).  The Sanderson was, for me, neither convenient for shopping (although it was near Oxford Circus) nor to commute to the City. 

Having said that, it is a decent hotel and so if the area is one that is convenient for your needs, I would still say it is a decent choice.  ",3,2016,11,26
132,Luxury ,Great hotel and accessible location. Room service good and nice wine selection. Our room was immaculate. Pure bliss  and clean modern setting. Room did feel a little clinical but still luxurious. Would definitely return. Staff friendly and attentive. ,5,2016,11,25
132,Pour Price for value hotel,"Average hotel for an unreasonably high price. 
Would not recommend, neither the level of service, the room, the cleaning, réception, special attentions were there. We had à fire alarm at 4am, just a self-excuse word at the door on the morning.
Only price tags everywhere. 
My room was noisy inside and outside, the shower plumbing was noisy, the overall décoration seem old and somewhat used.
Compliments for the car/taxi service!",2,2016,11,23
132,Sheer luxury,"A superb hotel with impeccable staff whose attention to detail and kindness helped to make my son's milestone 21st birthday a sheer joy, Ideally placed for the main shopping thoroughfare of Oxford Street/Regent St, the Sanderson is quiet, with quirky décor and a soothing scent throughout.",5,2016,11,22
132,Sanderson is a great place to stay,"highly recommended. This has been the best place iv'e stayed so far in London. Room was spacious, staff was friendly and helpful and the food was perfect. Could'n't have a better location for where we stayed. ",5,2016,11,21
132,The best hotel in London ,"I regularly stay at the hotel for business and I can honestly say the staff are incredible. It's difficult working away from home so often however the staff always make the stays special. Paris has been amazing since day one. Paris is always so accommodating and kind which makes it worth while staying at the hotel. Nothing is ever too much for any of the team at the hotel. The bell boys are always so happy and helpful. The rooms are always spotless thanks to all the great cleaners. Unlike most central London hotels, this hotel has amazing size rooms which makes you feel comfortable instead of claustrophobic which I find a lot in other hotels around London. Just want to thank Paris, Ruth, Jose, Henrick, Stephen, CJ, Ebi and Aldo for everything you've done for myself and Heather during our stays. I always highly recommend this hotel to all family and friends when they visit London. 

Thank you SANDERSON team 

Sheeva ",5,2016,11,20
132,Loved it!,"Loved the hotel. First time there, I usually stay in the edition or cafe royal- the Sanderson offer a funky design, great service and excellent location. Room was good size, very clean, free wifi worked well. Breakfast is good. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,11,18
132,AB FAB ,"The Sanderson is by far our go to hotel
London hotel. The experience here is 6 stars from booking to departure. The Sanderson is not a hotel for the stodgy.  This is a hotel as some have rightly called it a wonderland of wonderful. Our return visit found the hotel as we left it on our last visit in 2004 working on segments for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and looked as fresh and interesting as we fondly remembered. The welcome staff is gracious always with a hand to lend for any reason. Check in was delightful with genuine broad smile greetings and sincere interest in our needs.  Our request for a quiet room was noted and Nigel the front desk manager insured if we were not pleased with our first night experience he would happily relocate us.  Our lively chat about our return turned into an unexpected and greatly appreciated upgrade to the breakfast package.  Kudos to Nigel for the kindness he extended us after a long day of travel.

You must be prepared for the fun to begin in the lobby and when you enter the elevator you are off to outer space. Just plain fun!  The hallways are dark and lighted only by in-floor room numbers. The effect is somewhat Kubrick but again fun. The housekeeping staff is wearing all black so sometimes you can be startled to see them. We love it!! 

As we anticipated our room was as comfortable as before. Sparkling clean and well equipped. You need to be easy going to appreciate the Phillipe Stark design elements - as interesting as they are sometimes function does not follow form. We learned there are building codes that do not permit outlets in the bathrooms. The off center sink can prove a challenge when shaving and the mirror is definitely not for us shorter folks. The shower is good and strong with plenty of hot water but just a wafer sized storage plate for shower items. These are all small questionable design matters. Staff is aware and they are noted. But the beds are extremely comfortable and there is plenty of storage for longer stays - iron and ironing boards available on request. Fully stocked mini bar and good TV selections. 

The bar and dining areas are chic and great for quiet conversation or boisterous group fun. DJ on the weekends. This is definitely a bar and dining experience that says grab a drink, a meal and sit back and watch the show. Never a disappointment in what you will observe or overhear. There is exceptional service here from the bar to the kitchen to the table service and the drinks and  food are first rate and appropriately priced for the quality. We want to make a special public thank you to Patricia our breakfast hostess. You will not ever meet a more exuberant and charming young woman. We shared Portuguese descent, and she helped us to learn to pronounce our surname properly.  So professional in managing staff and sometimes the very demanding diner. She has become a new friend. We also want to give public praise to one of our waiters, Gaby. Such a kind and caring fellow and so professional. One very abusive guest made loud and highly inappropriate comments about a non-issue in a room full of guests. Gaby responded with grace and continued politeness in the face of a gentleman that needed a lesson in self control. Patricia reported the incident immediately to management and so did we. This was heartbreaking to witness, but so encouraging to see this kind server take this abuse with grace. How fortunate The Sanderson is to have such a well trained staff. 

For a very quiet experience with perfectly mixed drinks you need to experience Marta's cocktails in the Purple Bar. The room is dark and romantic and Marta's drinks are as seductive as the atmosphere. I do not drink anything but straight vodkas but she tempted me to try one of her personal for me cocktails. She knew I would not drink anything sweet but she blended a deep cooler with vodka and fresh fruits heavy on the lime no added sugar or flavored vodkas and it was divine. We would  like to take her home with us to be our personal bartender. And she is as exciting as her cocktails. So enthusiastic and so engaging. A must visit and say hello to Marta for us. 

I had a question about our bill nothing serious just a clarification and Nigel again offered to comp our bar bill for the Purple. Stunned!  Another unexpected kindness. Just first rate!!  Thanks, Nigel. 

We needed to use the Conceirge for personal business, and Joey was so Johnny On The Spot. Even a request to send a gift to the Saint Martin's was accomplished without hesitation. Thank you Joey. 

We also spoke with Douglas Flury, Front Desk Manage and Jose Piquer, Assistant Front Desk Manager. Both gentleman consummate professionals and so personable. They make asking a question an experience of friendly conversation and sincere interest in accommodating a need. And kudos to Adrian Verman, front desk assistant that provided me with his personal e-mail address to resolve a boarding pass issue after hours.  He printed the passes and I had them easily in hand. 

The Sanderson is located just off busy Oxford Street but you never feel that rush any time of day. Excellent location for Tube Stops of Oxford Circus and Tottenham  Court Road and the must sees are in walking distance or a short bus or Tube ride away.  Great pubs and restaurants within walking distance. 

Does it sound like we like The Sanderson. We do for so many reasons. For location, service, rooms, dining, and just plain fun in a hotel environment, we can't recommend better. Thank you Sanderson's staff Nigel, Patricia, Gaby, Joey, Douglas, Jose and the doormen and housekeeping staffs for making the last stop on our seven weeks of travel through France, Italy and finally London for screening our documentary the most relaxing and enjoyable experience to cap off so much success!!  Cheers to The Sanderson!!!

Gorgeous rooms and fab bathrooms 
All the staff are wonderful and nothing was too much trouble
Made a birthday stay really special 
We would definitely return to this hotel
In fact can't wait.",5,2016,11,14
132,Couldn't of asked for better customer service ,"Greeted by Jose at the door, very professional and fell all over us(throughout our stay ever single doorman greeted us with pleasant greetings). Ruby greeted us at reception extremely bubbly and welcoming, all smiles. Unfortunately we did not book a reservation for dinner in the restaurant as there was a little miscommunication. The restaurant was full in the hotel. We thought it was a walk in service, however it being a Friday night in London it would of been difficult to find a decent place for dinner but Aaron the waiter at the door could see how disheartened I was and somehow made a few changes and was able to get us seated. It was a big relief and he sent us a complimentary drink to apologize for the inconvenience caused. Due to the outstanding customer service of each staff member we encountered I will definitely be returning. Not to mention the fantastic cocktails. Be warned this is not a cheap hotel but you really do pay for what you get. ",5,2016,11,13
132,Romantic weekend break,"The hotel staff really looked after us and made the visit very special. Loved the atmosphere in the long bar. Room was spacious and the bed was huge and very comfortable. Will definitely stay again, and will recommend",5,2016,11,13
132,EXCEPTIONAL HOTEL STAY,"I booked this for my boyfriends birthday Nov 2016 as we had plans to go to the theatre and oxfords street shopping over the weekend. 8 can honestly say we have stayed at a few hotels in London which have all been lovely but this just exceeded to be by far the best one yet we felt very welcomed and was made to feel special without asking a knock on the door before we headed our a butler brought us a bottle of champagne and cake for my partners birthday and when we returned from our evening out the maid had covered bed in rose petals and lite candles it was these little touches made us feel as though we was important to them during our stay they went above and beyond to make it special , from beginning
To end, even though we didn't have much time to use the actual facilities in the hotel but if we had we would of defiently enjoyed a few drinks in the long bar as it appeared to have a wonderful atmosphere and the lobby with the pool table was also a lovely touch, a real buzzy atmosphere to this hotel ! The hotel too
 Itself
Is soo stunning very crisp and white with quirky but classy touches the bed itself Was sooo comfortable and huge I didn't want to leave ! Worth every penny thankyou once again Sanderson can't wait to return ",5,2016,11,12
132,Design hotel,"One of the trendy, stylish and modern hotel of Morgan Hotel Group. The minute I've stepped in the Sanderson, I immediately noticed Philippe Starck's design touch.

Despite the fact that the place is very fresh and original, I wasn't very impressed by the service.

Located in Fitzrovia London, it's quite close to the London Palladium theater and the British museum.

We relaxed after we each had our treatments. My facial with Matt was relaxing and therapeutic, thank you. 
Fantastic service, would love to go again!",5,2016,11,10
132,Brilliant thanks,A wonderful location to where I was working and easy access to the local malls. Great customer service. Good clean place. I would definitely come and visit this place. Food was also good. Freshly prepared.,5,2016,11,09
132,Spa Day at Agua !,"Super successful day thanks to a treat from and with my lovely daughter (about to have grandchild #3). Great treatments and lovely service from (among others) Matthew, Abigail and Beata. Ended with fizz (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) in the Long Bar!",5,2016,11,09
132,Amazing Staff!,"I had a lovely time at Sanderson, everyone is super friendly and helpful. The concierge Diogo was super helpful especially because we come from a foreign country. He gave us excelent advice on places to visit and also dinner recommendations. Such a lovely guy. Gaby and Sandra were very polite, kind and gave excellent service at breakfast. Phil at the door always smiling and welcoming us back to the Hotel. Overall loved everyone. One thing, the coffee is really really bad.",5,2016,11,08
132,Just an Outstanding Hotel,"As noted in my prior review, I said that I would stay again at The Sanderson on my next trip to London, and I did. And this visit re-confirms my prior 5-star review. Just a great hotel - large, very comfortable, modern rooms; great location; fantastic staff and service; and great value for a true 5-star hotel in a World capital city like London - well under Euro 300 a night for my visit. I cannot recommend it more highly.",5,2016,11,03
132,"Very good stay, luxurious hotel!","I've been in London in spring 2016. The Sanderson Hotel was a wonderful place to stay. The room (standard room with double bed) was bright and very clean. Only the curtains didn't worked. The bathroom was pretty clean and comfortable.

This hotel is pretty expensive. And that was the only disadvantage. For example: An ""Afternoon Tea"" (one!) costs about 60£. Too expensive, as I think.

All in all, a good but expensive hotel in London!",5,2016,11,02
132,Good location but not the best rooms,Location is very good for this hotel. The bar downstairs is also really good but the rooms are disappointing. The bed is situated in the middle of the room not against anything and it has a cheap feel to it. Particularly with the wooden floor and uncontrollable air conditioning. Better places to stay for the price ,2,2016,11,01
132,Heaven on earth at agua Spa,"The service I received at the spa was incredibly, I booked the agua advanced body work 50 minutes, with the receptionists Daniel and Beata who were amazing in accommodating my wants and needs to make my day relaxing. 

Sunday when I booked my treatment, I was greeted by Emma and Abigail who made me feel like a VIP all day. They showed me to one of the private pods, were I slept like a baby for a couple of hours before my treatment. 

My massage was heavenly I can now understand what R.Kelly said when he sang he believed that he could fly, because after that treatment I felt so light and relaxed. All my stresses disappeared. 

My only regret is not booking in for the 80 minutes version of the treatment. 
I have learnt my lesson and will book that in the next time.   

The whole experience was relaxing and heavenly I will definitely be coming back. 
Thank you agua Spa.",5,2016,10,31
132,Place to be and to see in London,"I had 3 nights in Sanderson and it is one of the best hotels I have been in. Bars and restaurants are amazing, rooms are so classy and clean. Staff is so gentle and service is just perfect. If you go in London I highly recommend this hotel",5,2016,10,30
132,Best hotel stay ever ,"I have stayed at some of the best hotels in the UK and the Sanderson and St Martin's lane are two of the best, from checking in to checking out, first class 5 star's. It's not cheap, but worth the money, treat yourself and your partner. ",5,2016,10,30
132,Truly consistently good,"I generally judge hotels by two things:  The caliber and quality of its staff and how fresh the hotel appears.  And by both counts, The Sanderson ranks high.  It's rare when every encounter with each and every staff member is positive, welcoming and first rate.  It is one of the most qualified staffs I've witnessed.  The hotel itself is not new.  Yet, it appears so.  I've stayed there off and on for years -- and it feels new all the time.  The design is still relevant and the rooms are among the most comfortable I've stayed in.  Plus location of Sanderson is superb and the surrounding streets -- despite heavy construction -- gets better and better.  A+",5,2016,10,26
132,Another romantic weekend,"A two night stay in London and selected the Sanderson as its part of the Morgans group of hotels and they always give great service. The Sanderson is not a looker from the outside (19560's was not a great building time for facia's) but don't let that fool you, inside its fantastic. Its located 200 metres from Oxford Street and a 10 minute walk (down nice London Streets) to Soho/theatre land. We drove up to the door and the doorman rushed to open our car doors and take our luggage, he was chatty and super friendly. He then took our car off for parking. The hotel inside is super cool, wacky chairs (including the famous pair of lips) and a really spacious area. Check-in was easy, relaxed and again, all the staff were incredibly friendly. We chose a deluxe room and it was fabulous, very large and an incredible bathroom with free standing bath, smoked screen shower and toilet and all the toiletries/robes/slippers etc that you could hope for. The bed was in the middle of the room which we loved and we had a great sitting area and large tv. The room overlooked their Japanese garden which is perfect for afternoon tea or pre-dinner cocktails......we were hear in late autumn but I would imagine in the summer its even better. Before going out each night we had cocktails in the long bar which is a great place to hang out, the bar is 20-25 metres long and must have 40 seats around....the bar staff all work in the middle and are very attentive, cocktails were good too. When we got back after our evening, the bar was very busy....I'm guessing non-staying customers come in too just for the atmosphere, it had a real buzz. Breakfast, which can so often be disappointing was the best we've had, a huge supply of cereals, yogurts, fruit as well as cold meats, salmon, cheeses and an array of breads....and that's just the starter! The eggs are freshly prepared and accompanied by pretty much whatever you want, if you want a protein filled smoothie they are in plentiful supply. We could have happily stayed there for hours. This is, without doubt, the best hotel I have stayed in when in London......great rooms, fantastic atmosphere and brilliant staff who obviously all love their jobs. When collecting our car, the doorman even took all our luggage for us and put it neatly in the boot before driving it to us at the front door, that just about says it all. If I was looking to stay in London and either do shopping or visit Soho and the theatres I wouldn't stay anywhere else.",5,2016,10,24
132,The place to stay in London,"The Sanderson and its staff were brilliant. We could not have asked for better service and attention to detail. The room exceeded our expectation and the location of the hotel was great for what we wanted. They made our trip a memorable one. We will be using them again and can highly recommend the hotel to anyone looking an great place to stay while in London.

132,"Stylish hotel, great location","Contemporary and stylish hotel with whimsical design features throughout make this a special and unique place to stay. The  exterior shouldnt put you, the interior is very impressive. The staff are all very welcoming and have a nice balance of professionalism and friendliness. 

Great atmosphere in the long bar with live DJ at night . 

Heated outdoor courtyard and garden area would be a fantastic place to eat l, especially for afternoon tea. 

The Alice in Wonderland theme carries throughout the hotel making it a great place to take children - or in my case for adults to appreciate the little surprises the hotel has to offer! 

Location is great, just a ten min walk to theatreland, only 2 mins from oxford street.",5,2016,10,23
132,Absolutely LOVELY.,"Loved the people working there, loved the place, loved the location, loved our Penthouse. loved the Purple Bar and loved the morning restaurant for breakfast.
Overall I had a very good experience at the Sanderson. The staff was absolutely great. Friendly - met our needs - made suggestions. It was my first time in London and I know I was totally spoiled staying there. If I get back to London I would HAVE to stay there again.",5,2016,10,19
132,"Classy stay, with fantastic staff","Let me start by saying that I loved the hotel and would definitely recommend staying here. It would easily be five stars had my stay here gotten off to a smoother start...

I had to cancel a weekend in Paris earlier this year as my wife and I found out that we were expecting. Having had the little one three months ago I thought it would be nice to do something just the three of us; and with a wealth of activities around the Sanderson and the highly recommended restaurant and spa on site I thought this was a bold but potentially brilliant plan. 

I made the hotel aware that we had a baby when I booked and again when I confirmed a week before we travelled. I even checked that the room would be suitable. Once checked in they brought and assembled a lovely cot but being a naive first time parent I didn't question that we were on the first floor immediately above the bar. Well, come 10pm on a Saturday the already lively (but not noticeably loud) bar turned in to a night club, which in turn became a crying baby and a very angry wife. We complained but it was too late to move; however, the night managers response was fantastic. Unable to do anything else, our room rate was immediately cut in half and we were assured that the music would be turned down. I was sceptical of the latter as this is a very popular bar but sure enough the music was turned right down and the base almost turned off. Although I feel sorry for the patrons of the bar, it was a massive relief and even when I could hear the DJ inch the volume up, it would come down again soon after from what I like to imagine was the actions of a diligent and thoughtful night manager. 

For the rest of our two night stay (both before and after the sat night) the staff were fantastic and couldn't do enough to accommodate my very young family. The hotel is gorgeous, the food was lovely, and the afternoon tea was a fantastic experience. My wife even described the spa as what she imagines heaven will be like. 

One thing to note though: the rooms are minimalist so don't expect access to tea making facilities or an iron without a request to housekeeping. 

In summary, if you want a beautiful experience, a great location and top notch service; staying here is a great choice. If you're a new, but rather courageous/naive/stupid, parent then request a room away from the bar. ",4,2016,10,12
132,One of London's best.,As an expat Brit returning to London on business I could not have been happier with the location and service that I received at the Sanderson.  The vibrant weekend bar action and hip decor adequately represented the bright and energetic scene in London.  I'll definitely be back.,5,2016,10,11
132,Special treat Anniversary weekend away,"Very clean, fresh and bright.  
We checked in and didn't even have a congratulation comment, we just didn't get to feel special for our weekend away and when spending this amount it's not much to ask? 
The bar staff are fantastic, nothing was too much effort for them which was lovely. Great atmosphere and wonderful place to people watch. ",3,2016,10,11
132,Great location,Expensive hotel for what it offers. Location is great staff is ok and the bed was comfortable.we did not try breakfast so no opinion.they provided late check out free of charge! This was professional from their side as we arrived very late and we lost one day.,4,2016,10,10
132,Tim Sargeant,"I have regularly stayed at the Sanderson for the last three years for business and pleasure. It's extremely well located and the beds are dream. It's got a cool vibe throughout but the very best thing for me has got to be the staff. They are all fabulous throughout from the door staff to the bar staff but the real star has got to be Paris, the guest experience manager who has ensured that every stay is a pleasure. ",5,2016,10,08
132,"Still great, with a (very) few rough edges","This was our 4th annual visit to the Sanderson. It's still the best place we've stayed in London over the years.

The staff remains fantastic, accommodating, helpful and friendly.

This trip had a few (relatively minor) bumps, but we're still expecting to return, as the overall experience remains first rate.

The rooms are still stylish, large and ultra-modern. Amenities are great, although counter space is extremely limited in all bathrooms. Beds are big and comfy.

Room noise in some locations is the only real issue. Our difficulty was that our trip overlapped with London Fashion Week, and there were quite a few revelers at the Sanderson and nearby hotels! On lower floors the noise from the Mews on the back or overlooking the bar area can be higher than you might like.

The Long Bar didn't seem to be as crushingly crowded as prior trips, which was nice.

LOTS of nearby food, lots of new places a few blocks N and E, especially Draft House Charlotte, Dickie Fitz, Siam Central. Or just walk S to Soho, for more variety and ""liveliness"".

We'll be back.",4,2016,10,07
132,London Fall '16,"The Sanderson offered us a perfect stay in London!  The location, the amenities, and the staff  were all exceptional.  I look forward to my return and will recommend The Sanderson to friends and colleagues.",5,2016,10,06
132,Stylish luxury,"I stayed at the Sanderson for one night to celebrate my birthday. Firstly, the check in staff were excellent, really friendly and welcoming and did everything they could to accommodate my requests. 

The spa was like being in heaven and I had an excellent massage with Jonathan. The sleeping rooms were also amazing. 

The room was great, clean and spacious. I received a cake for my birthday which was a nice touch. 

Overall great hotel for a special occasion.",4,2016,10,04
132,Unkind to elder people and younger guests,"Nice hotel, good located. But from a hotel in this price range one can expect hospitality every age. Unfortunately we missed that from the arrogant bar chef (Sat 29th September, 8 pm). Was a sad experience.",2,2016,10,03
132,Lacked personal touches and attention to the guest,"Check-in was poor, pretty much ignored, as the staff too happy to chat to each other.  The barman was worse, having to call him over on no less than 5 occasions, even though there were only two groups drinking.  Both times he was too busy looking at his phone.  The bar had a fashion show and the other room was privately let, so there were no places to sit and enjoy my special occasion.  We were billed twice for the carpark (for one night) and all in all felt really let down.  Once home, i made my feelings known to the head office, yet no response after 7 days.  I joined a chat live and they promised to call me back, no response yet after waiting in for hours.  I loved the place, but the team really short-changed me on this occasion and ruined a treasured night away from my kids.  Poor form to not even respond or acknowledge.",2,2016,10,03
132,Adorable and minimalistic,"I love this hotel whenever I am in London. Its very modern. An old office building converted to a hotel thats absolutely huge but you still get the feeling of cosiness. There's a good ethnic mix so if you're travelling somewhere else, there's someone knowledgeable about your destination that would give advice and loads of information. ",5,2016,10,03
132,LA vibe in London,"I am a big fan of the traditional plush boutique english hotels and the Firmdale group in particular.  The Sanderson isn't that.  It opted instead for a more US West Coast atmosphere, with dark hallways, cold modern interiors, hip entry hall.  That being said, the team does a great job to make you feel welcome and it still is a luxury hotel in the Franzrovia area, surrounded with great restaurants, close to the British museum and a 20 min walk to the theatres.  Nothing wrong there. The beds are very comfortable and the gym is much better than most other places.  What I don't like?  The party atmosphere, the impossibility to open windows, the impractical shower and the use of sheers to separate rooms and closets.  It remains a solid deal and does feel special.  It just doesn't have the level of comfort and attention to details the Firmdale group has lulled me into.",4,2016,09,30
132,Excellent hotel,"I stayed here on business on two occasions recently and was really pleased with the venue. It's a great hotel in an amazing location, the staff are fantastic - so friendly, helpful and have a great sense of humour. The rooms are lovely and the facilities what you'd expect. I'd really recommend this hotel to others ",5,2016,09,29
132,Girls weekend! Shopping and cocktails!,"This is the first time I stayed at the Sanderson and I have to say I was blown away, from the outside it looks like a normal mainstream hotel - Inside is a whole new ball game - I was really taken back! The decor is spectacular and it really does have a massive WOW factor! Its beautiful! The bedroom was clean and very modern, the bed was lovely and comfy and the bathroom was clean and had everything you needed and with such a modern feel.- The only thing I would say is there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room, but I simply called reception and 2 minutes later we had them, so definitely nothing to complain about. The staff were amazing , as soon as we arrived they opened our car door, unloaded all the luggage and we checked in instantly - the whole process took 5 minutes - I had the best cocktail I have ever had in the bar and the bar staff were so helpful. The room was more expensive then an average hotel - but the SANDERSON IS NOT AVERAGE!!! Its amazing and worth every penny. The breakfast was beautiful it had everything you needed and more, lots of special touches! The cooked breakfast and coffee was slow to arrive, but you could tell everything was fresh and cooked to order, no bacon that had been sitting around ages, it was cooked to perfection! so the wait was worth it. Checking out was as easy as checking in. There is nothing I can fault about this hotel, it was luxury and I will definitely be back.",5,2016,09,29
132,"Great Location, Lively Hotel and very stylish","We had a weekend in London and chose the Sanderson for a change. It is very stylish, modern and design led. The rooms are very stylish, reasonable size and quirky. The beds are all at an angle which is quirky, but stance. the bathrooms are super cool with glass walls separating them. The staff on check in were brilliant, very welcoming and funny in a good way. After the theatre we went to the bar which was super busy so we made our way to the residents private bar which was a  great space, but it had the smallest chairs ever like kids school chairs! they need bigger chairs. Great music well mixed cocktails, we loved it apart from the chairs.",4,2016,09,27
132,Perfect experience,"Best experience in this perfect situated London City Hotel, perfect service, super polite and attentive staff, cool ambiance, great bar, great restaurant, just a few steps from Oxford street, but very calm surrounding",5,2016,09,27

Spacious suite, great gym, efficient concierge, delightfull breakfast, excellent amenities. Highly recommended.",5,2016,09,26
132,Amazing...when can I go back?,"This is definitely our hotel of choice. I have stayed there twice now and both times the service has been impeccable, the rooms are spotless and the breakfast delicious. the first time I stayed it was with my husband and the second time was with children. Perfect for both occasions. I haven't tried the spa yet but its definitely on my to do list next time.",5,2016,09,25
132,Made me feel old,"20 years ago I used to drink at the bar in this hotel most Friday nights and LOVED it. It was so trendy and the in place to be. It hasn't changed a bit, the bar is still fabulous, the rooms are beautiful if not a little clinical and the service is excellent. But now that I'm closer to 50, all be it a young 50 It's now a little to cutting edge for me. My stay did bring back some wonderful memories and I'm pleased I stayed but I'm more of a Corinthia girl now! ",5,2016,09,25
132,Celebrated my Birthday. Love it,"I love Sanderson Hotel, love the decor, how friendly and polite the staff is and the food is super delicious. Celebrated my Birthday there with friends and family we had an awesome tim. I have been many time after on different occasions attending Fashion Shows held there and it is always a pleasure. They make awesome cocktails too.",5,2016,09,25
132,Quirky and amazing,"This hotel has to be seen to be believed, you are met at the door and booked in, your car is then taken off and parked.
Reception is filled with all sorts of interesting items and a pool room just off to the left, large bar laid out nicely.
The rooms are a very good standard and large, plenty of freebies in the bathroom which in our case was a large walk in shower, just right for a weekend full of fun.
Corridors a bit dark, that call it ambiance, I call it, where's my torch. Lift looks like you have entered the Universe with a 3D effect.
Eating in the hanging gardens of Babylon was a great atmosphere, the food all fresh cooked and served with good service.
Magic breakfast, so much to pick from, buffet or fresh cooked.
From the front door you can the BT tower. Station just around the corner. London Transport museum close by as Regent street and all the magic shopping places, so well situated for the theatre.",5,2016,09,25
132,Modern and trendy hotel with great location,"One of the better hotels in London, if you fancy trendy, boutique style with cool interior and design. Sligthly minimalistic, but still warm and comfortable. Rooms have solid size, being London, and the location is on a very quiet street, just 5 mins walk from Oxford Circus. Very comfortable beds",4,2016,09,25
132,Trendy hotel in a great location,"The Sanderson will not be for everybody. It is a modern, stylish hotel in a converted office block. It is edgy, trendy rather than sumptious and opulent. That said I really liked the hotel.

In terms of location it is walking distance from Soho, at the north end of Oxford Street and close to Tottenham Court Road. It is an easy walk to Shaftesbury Avenue and the theatres.

The hotel itself is a destination with the long bar being one of the places to be seen at. When we returned to the hotel around 1am the bar was buzzing with a DJ and the beautiful people hanging out there.

The guest-only bar is also a great place to hang out more plush than the long bar but again with a DJ playing great music but not at such a level as you couldn't hear yourself talk.

The lobby of the hotel is full of interesting, modern furniture including a lips sofa and a perspex swing seat hanging from the ceiling. In an adjacent room there is a giant, purple pool table in a room surrounded by thrones.

The room we stayed in was stylish in a minimalist way. The bed was at an angle in the room with an oil painting on the ceiling above your head. The bed was a standard double bed and was very comfortable. There was a relatively small television with both a wide range of channels and on-demand movies. The room could have done with a iPod docking station or some other way to play music.

There was also no means of making tea and coffee in the room - for a hotel like this I would have expected at least a Nespresso machine.

When the blinds were lowered as part of the turn down service they turned out to be artistic with pictures on them which made the room feel very stylish at night.

The bathroom was stylish behind a glass wall separating the bedroom. A curtain can be pulled along the glass. The place to hang and store clothes was within the bathroom behind a curtain,

The shower had two heads and was in a walk in cubicle.

The bath towels were large and very soft.

The air-conditioning was quiet and efficient.

There was free wifi throughout the hotel limited to three devices per room number.

Breakfast is served in the same room as the long bar or outside in the central courtyard. There are heaters outside to make it more accessible.

Breakfast if not included in your room rate is not cheap, but there are deals with breakfast included. There is a breakfast buffet as well as a la carte. The range of the buffet is not extensive but what was on offer was good. 

We did have the fire alarm go off at 0645 and had to evacuate the hotel. As we had only gone to bed at 0130 this was a rude awakening on a Sunday morning. It turned out to be a false alarm. In fairness to the hotel when we checked out the manager was very apologetic and took the price of the breakfast off our bill.

Overall if you are looking for a special night in London then this is a highly recommendable hotel.",5,2016,09,24
132,THE BEST!,"We LOVED everything about our stay at the Sanderson! The location (5 min walk to Oxford street), the hospitality, the cleanliness, ...etc. Upon check in, when the receptionist knew we're celebrating our anniversary, not only did she upgrade our room, but sent us complimentary champagne! What's even sweeter, when we told her we don't drink alcohol, she exchanged the champagne with a big fruit basket :))  The concierge and all the staff are very cheerful and helpful. A must go is the afternoon tea there! Would definitely stay there again. The hotel is renovated and modern.",5,2016,09,21
132,AGUA SPA is amazing!,I visited the Spa today and really didn't expect to have such an amazing experience. The spa is beautiful and relaxing and I had a facial which was incredible. My skin has never felt or looked so good. They really take care of you too. I would highly recommend treating yourself here :),5,2016,09,20
132,Best stay in London so far,"Such a quirky, fun hotel, great sized rooms and great décor! The theme throughout the hotel is kind of Alice in Wonderland, this may be the theme, I haven't asked. 
Rooms are clean, super modern, stylish and comfy. The bar is great, the restaurant too and they have a cute outdoor Japanese garden area. Staff are great in all areas. 
Its close to everything you need in London, right next to Oxford street, all the best bars, clubs and restaurants are also nearby.",5,2016,09,19
132,Incredible Choice,"I stayed at the Sanderson London Hotel during the first week of September. It was my first time staying there so wasn't sure what to expect. The staff were incredibly helpful, going out of their way to help and guide. 

I requested an early check-in which the hotel was happy to oblige and the check-in process was quite speedy and hassle-free. I stayed in their standard room which was very cozy and beautifully designed. The room and bathroom are separated by a glass wall that can be covered easily with an automated curtain. 

The staff were courteous and hospitable and ready to assist you at all times. They have a nice lounge on the ground floor and their iconic kiss couch is a nice touch. Excellent choice, definitely a return customer.",5,2016,09,18
132,Probably wouldn't return,"The hotel itself is funky and different (more boutique). The staff are nice. The restaurant was okay, I thought it was quite expensive even as London prices go. The prices for drinks were extortionate! I understand that any London hotel/bar is going to be expensive, but I paid around £45-£50 for two drinks ... To me that's ridiculous.

It's conveniently located. The rooms are comfortable. Ours was quite small, but again, it's London.

I probably wouldn't go back. ",3,2016,09,18
132,"Trendy, not cozy..","We stayed at the hotel few night, we liked the design of the lobby and the bar area. The place is very busy on Friday and Saturday nights, a bit too loud for our liking, we had drunken people hanging around outside on Friday night and very loud arabic music playing outside in the street on Sunday night.. definitely not my favourite spot for sleeping.. Breakfast is nice, you may chose in between a la carte and a tiny buffet.. We would have loved to enjoy a bit more outside sitting, but we were limite din our choice because of morning set up of the afternoon tea.. the staff could definitely be more flexible and friendly..",3,2016,09,17
132,Beautiful hotel in the heart of london,From its gorgeous lobby and rooms to its super upscale trendy lounge the sanderson is by far one of my favorite hotels Ive been to!

132,"""lovely""",We stayed in the loft with a terrace and it was so beautiful.  The staff at the hotel were so helpful and nice and helped us with all our daily needs.  I would definitely stay here again.  The restaurant was really good and love the bar scene there.  Coolest decor!,5,2016,09,13
132,Sleek,"Great stay, lovely staff very enjoyable, long time to wait for bar service but good location spent a great deal of time out of the hotel, afternoon tea at the ritz was a fantastic treat for girly weekend",5,2016,09,10
132,Slinky Sanderson hotel,"My experience was very good, definetly stay again, liked being in the outdoor terrace for afternoon tea, plus dinner, also breakfast , staff are excellent , position, not sure as I didn't go anywhere outside, liked the feel of the hotel.",5,2016,09,07
132,"gorgeous stylish oasis, service and amenities lacking in some areas","one night stay for Birthday party in London, Gorgeous super stylish funky hotel, fabulous public areas, gorgeous bar, outside eating space real oasis, quirky and stylish interiors, Let down by some basic features in the hotel room, ie far to low level lighting meaning getting ready is actually difficult, super minamalist bathroom and then a cheap bin you would get in asda, toilet door did not lock, no plug for the sink, meaning you had to shave with constant running water, good job i was with my husband, or the glass bathroom and open plan walls would be a nightmare for those who wanted privacy, some cupboards opened to dirt and bare walls and were just unfinished, my friend had arranged a loft suite but when we went to check in it was not ready, apparantly all the loft terrace suites are on a smoking floor so smell of smoke, so despite being made to wait for 15 minutes while they fabreezed the room it was still too smelly (although they did give us complimentary lovely glass of wine each while we waited, but we had a party to get to so the delay caused us problems), but they did find me another room,Plus points,  Concierge arranged a bottle of champagne for our room as it was my birthday, the staff could not have been nicer and were very welcoming, and lovely, very apologetic, if you want a night of glamour this is definately the hotel, the in room toiletries were a life saver as i had left my shave foam at home, wireless bluetooth speaker was a great addition, all in all a lovely stay which made a very special birthday, not spoilt but let down slightly by delays, room changes to a lesser room and the lack of basic amenities within the room.  Finally the toilets for the bar were accross the main lobby , up a flight of stairs, so no good for anyone in heels or that doesnt want to walk miles, but you do get a glam walk through reception !!",3,2016,09,05
132,Agua Spa,I took a small group of girls to visit the Spa recently and we were looked after wonderfully from start to finish. I highly recommend the Spa and try out the relaxing pods as well as the fantastic steam room. The treatments on offer are fantastic and I very much recommend the full body massage. I will be coming back in the future!,5,2016,09,04
132,Beyond design,"Saying The Sanderson is a design delight is an understatement. It really feels like a serene cocoon right in Soho. But what keeps me coming here every single week are two ladies. As much as I hate check-ins, Cristina just makes it seamless - she is an always smiling, welcoming host that makes you feel like a real special guest. She represents the soul of The Sanderson for me. As for the heart of the latter, Larissa at breakfast is maternal waitress you wish you would meet more often. She is the protective starter of any given workday - and the sole reason why I have breakfast at the Sanderson (food is not bad neither ;-)",5,2016,09,01
132,Girls weekend,"This hotel was amazing, excellent service from beginning to end. The rooms are quite prices but we booked on last minute.com and got a fantastic deal. The cocktail bar and DJ were great. Wish we had booked a meal there or afternoon tea looked lovely.

The bed was clean and the bed so comfy. Complimentary tea and coffee bought to your room

Location was perfect, 5 mins from Oxford street, great choice of restaurants.",5,2016,09,01
132,Exquisite therapist and spa ,"3rd time to my haven Agua spa, Sanderson. This time the Indian head massage was my choice & the beautiful Julia took care of me. Her confident hands were as warm as she is and her wealth of knowledge shone through as her unique technique sent me into deep relaxation but left me feeling energised and awake. So gentle, yet firm and precise. Exquisite! ",5,2016,08,30
132,Celebration weekend,Excellent service and hotel is fab. Staff our friendly and couldn't fault a thing. Rooms were modern and clean and beds extremely comfortable. Great smart tv and everything you could think of in the room for you. Great location and trendy bar with a great atmosphere.,5,2016,08,29
132,Lovely anniversary weekend,"Stayed just one night for our wedding anniversary at Sanderson. We were impressed by the design and modern styling of the hotel. The room was spacious, futuristic with all of the essential amenities. I had e-mailed ahead notifying the hotel that we were celebrating our anniversary; there was a signed card with chocolates in the room on our arrival which was a nice touch. 

We had evening drinks in the residents-only bar which was quieter and offered more privacy than the main showpiece Sanderson bar out front. Cocktails were well made although at £14 each quite pricey - this is expected at a posh central London hotel. 

Breakfast included a continental buffet selection and a main chosen from an a la carte menu. The food was tasty, well presented and the service unobtrusive and professional.

Overall a very polished hotel operation in a uniquely designed space. Would highly recommend for central London stays!

132,A design Icon in th West End,"Achingly cool,yet welcoming and friendly-the vast open lobby?reception gives a taste of what to expect in the rest of the Hotel.One offf pieces of furniture,including the famous red-lips sofa-are backed up by the holograph line walls of the lift and runway style lights down the softly lit corridors.Our standard double-4th floor street-side-was spacious for centralLondon with a great all glass dressing-room/bathroom area.Starke-styled shower-fantastic and loo in glass cubicles  and a free standing wash stand were separated from the sleeping area by an opaque glass wall and gauzy curtains for added privacy.Nice touch in the evening the amid lit scented tea-lights.No pillow chockies here.Such a cony bed-very firm- and fantastic white  bed linen made our night sleep very deep.Little or no street noise as Berners street is mainly offices.The main bar is very chic-great House Cocktails- with a very pretty court-yard seating area for food.The 'Private'bar id wonderful, all mirrors and deep purple upholstery with fantastic music from the hotels' DJ",5,2016,08,28
132,A gem in the heart of London,"My best friend and I decided to treat ourselves as part of the ""Summer Savings deal"" which included cocktails at the Long Bar. We'd visited the Purple Bar previously and always appeared to be a stylish hotel. 

Was very impressed with our room, even though we opted for the basic end it still had the nice touches, such as the bathrobes and considering the inclement weather this summer - an umbrella! Even the lift which is space themed is worthy of Instagram. 

We opted for room service for dinner and breakfast and I was pleasantly surprised again with the attention to detail (such as the rose for presentation). The Caesar salads were substantial and the continental breakfast gets a thumbs up from me. 

The room we stayed in overlooked the courtyard and we were warned about the music but the bed was so comfortable (and we'd walked so many miles up and down the nearby Oxford St) that we slept soundly. 

I'd love to head back once more and if you do manage to go I'd recommend the Long Bar for atmosphere or the Purple Bar, which is opulent. ",5,2016,08,28
132,Amazing ,"Stayed here with my partner for an anniversary and I can honestly say there was not one single fault. You're immediately captivated by the stunningly unique decor and welcomed by warm and friendly members of staff. The room was beautiful and very spacious. We ate in the hotel restaurant and the food was exceptionally good. Once the staff were made aware of my allergy they couldn't have done more to make me feel at ease and kindly showed me dishes on the menu that I could have. The service was personal and excellent. Following dinner we went to the 'Purple Bar'. The room is incredibly individual and special, definitely worth knowing about. The bar staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful; coming over to our table to greet us and to ask us what kind of drinks we enjoyed. He then offered to make us bespoke drinks based upon our likes and tastes, such a lovely and personal touch. I would definitely recommend this hotel, it is beautifully unique with exceptional staff that ensure you feel welcomed and that all of your needs are met. ",5,2016,08,27
132,Great boutique hotel,"We stayed for two nights over a Friday and Saturday. Check in was swift and painless. We had a room on the third floor. Initially a little sceptical as we were the first room as you exit the lift, so we wondered about noise levels but this isn't an issue at all. 
The room was very nice, modern and spotless. The bathroom area had a large area with a sink, robes and slippers, and a small wardrobe area. Just off of this was a shower and separate toilet. It was all glass design so very modern looking. 

The bedroom was nice, with a queen size bed, table, two bedside tables, TV, minibar and cupboard space. 

The bed was very comfortable and there is a turn down service each night.

We had some drinks in the Long Bar on both days-this bar does become busy on weekends but the atmosphere is very good. Overall one of the best hotels I've stayed in for a weekend break. ",5,2016,08,27
132,"In a word, ""Unique""","This urban hotel is unlike any hotel I visited in the past.
The design of the hotel's areas and rooms is just amazing.
We stayed in a standard room, which was very comfortable and spacious the room looks great.

Our room turned into the street, we encountered no noise or hindrance, nor of revelers leaving the hotel bar.

The staff is very nice and happy to help.

We arrivedto the hotel from Luton airport.

twe chose to go by a shuttle from the airport to the train station (included in the train ticket ) - A train from the station ""Luton airport parckway "" to ""saint Pancres station""- and from there a tube (VICTORIA LINE) to Oxford Circus station. Then 5 min walking to the hotel.

warmly recommended",5,2016,08,24
132,"Excellent hotel, excellent service, excellent choice..BOOK NOW! ","Thank you to the Sanderson for making our stay such a memorable one! I have visited the hotel previously for afternoon tea which was fabulous and could not wait to book an overnight stay! The lobby is super chic with quirky furniture and the Sanderson signature pumping through the air vents. The hotel staff were extremely attentive and check in was very efficient. Our room was minimalistic but still somewhat cosy with the most comfortable bed. We were very surprised when room service delivered a complimentary bottle of champagne and cake to mark our birthday celebrations....totally unexpected but very much appreciated! We visited the Long Bar for cocktails and this is not to be missed! The menu is extensive and the drinks taste divine!!! As expected the Sanderson did not disappoint and we hope to return again soon! If you are looking for a London hotel then look no further! Special thanks to Paris, Simone and all of the reception staff for wonderful service!! 😘",5,2016,08,21
132,"Quirky, Tasteful & Relaxing","The hotel service from the staff is great, they listen and arrange everything you need. The concierge was great and the spa treatment, expensive yet very good, but prices acceptable for Oxford Street. Breakfast and afternoon tea are amazing. Only dissapointment was the bed was small for a King (more like a double) and no bath... Other than that, would return again. And great for a secret booking hotel! All they need is better pool cues. ",5,2016,08,21
132,Hospitality is in the details and they understand this perfecty,"Just when one get's crazy because of the noise and crowd of Oxford Street, there is Berners Street a quiet and calm street where the Sanderson is located. Outside the Sanderson you will find nothing exacting but entering the hospitality trip starts. A kind doorman, a kind rceptionist, the smell, the decor.. Start with the check in, the kind receptionist gave us an up-up grade to a beautiful Deluxe room. Staying for 5 nights this was very much appreciated. We felt at home right away. Our room # 429 was a great room, spacious, away from the garden/bar, great bed, spacious bathroom. This is the room you can live in. Housekeeping was perfect. The remarkable thing is, you know there has to be housekeeping and containers with dirty laundry but you don't hear or see them. Room was very clean!
Dining in the garden was also wonderful, nice waiter and maitre with knowledge of the products and wine. Food was great, the chef understands his or her food. Fresh, tasteful, great flavour. Every morning breakfast in the garden and yes the breakfast staff is nice too.
All in all, a perfect stay and I don't need to think twice which hotel I am staying in the next time I am in London.
No critical note?  We missed a sitting place in the garden without having to sit at a table where the busy high tea was during the day. And every day is earth day is great in theory but we had fresh towels every day even when the towels weren't on the floor.",5,2016,08,20
132,Quite a pleasure,"Stayed at Sanderson London for a business trip. Although on private trips I'd select a more basic hotel, the Sanderson was an experience on it's own. The service was great, but not always consistent. 3 out of 4 nights enjoyed the turndown service. The doormans at the hotel are nice but whenever they are in a personal conversation with a taxidriver they won't notice you (happend about 6 times). Also the deposit of 100 pounds a night was quite high for me...but this is because I'm not used to this kind of luxury. 

The breakfast, cocktails, room and beds .... all were great, as well as the concierge service for booking excursions. Don't let any of my comments prevent you from going to Sanderson, as they are based on my personal references.",5,2016,08,19
132,"Great service, great rooms, great location - perfect","The Sanderson is a top-notch hotel, fully deserving of its five stars, from the appearance of the staff, the service they deliver, the quality of the facilities from lobby to bar to spa, and the luxurious room I stayed in.

The Sanderson's a pretty unassuming looking hotel from the outside but once you go through the door you can just sense you're in a great hotel. The check-in experience I had was as good as it gets. Jose, who checked me in, gave me his card with his personal details on it so I could contact him about my stay. There's none of this 'call reception if you want any help' business - it's proper personal service.

The room I stayed in was enormous and beautifully appointed, with an enormous bed and tasteful interior design. I immediately wished I were staying for more than one night.

I usually prefer to go for run outdoors and fully intended to head up to Regents Park for a little workout. However, the stickiness of the evening air combined with the desire to maximise my time at the Sanderson meant I headed to the gym. All the usual equipment you'd expect from a top gym is present, as well as TVs with subtitles thoughtfully already switched on for you, so you can distract yourself while working out. I usually hate working out in hotel gyms but was more than happy to use the one at the Sanderson.

I had a great night's sleep, more so than I normally manage in a hotel. The bed, as mentioned before, was enormous, as well as extremely comfortable. The windows muted any sound coming from the courtyard. I'm pretty sure there was an event taking place but I didn't hear a peep.

I've been lucky enough to stay in and visit a few top hotels in London and beyond, and can categorically state that the Sanderson is my new favourite hotel. Hugely recommended.",5,2016,08,17
132,"Boutique, modern and spacious","One of the best boutique hotels in London. Very good location close to the main attractions, i.e. Leicester Sq, Piccadilly and shopping district. The rooms are very spacious, clean and with nice bathroom. Especially the reception and lobby is really creative and designed.",5,2016,08,16
132,Quirky and relaxing,"From outside nothing special - but the lobby is original and impressive. The check-in is quick and welcoming. Knowing hotel rooms in London we were surprised here : the king room is large, and there is lotsof space in the bath room too. Design is a question of taste, of course, but it was very much our taste and we felt very well taken care of at the Sanderson. There is no tea or coffee equipment at the room, but we called for a kettle and teabags and they arrived within a minute. The minibar is extensive. BTW there is a construction site on the same street, but we didn't hear anything and slept perfectly. The bars at the Sanderson would deserve their own review ( I prefer the Purple Bar, with a bit more privacy and a skilled lady barista)
Conclusion : we absolutely loved the Sanderson !",5,2016,08,15
132,Luxury in a convenient location,We had a great stay. The hotel is very central and comfortable. The bar becomes a real party in the evenings. We made use of the spa facilities and the gym. Its a short walk to Oxford Street. The concierge made super recommendations the best of which was the Italian deli called Princi in Soho. Amazing food and coffee.,4,2016,08,15
132,Great location and style,"This hotel is blessed with a wonderful location - close to both Regent and Oxford streets, but far enough away from the hustle and bustle that you can feel like you've escaped the city once you arrive. Also very close to Charlotte street with its myriad restaurants choices. Very stylish and trendy bar in the lobby. Beautifully appointed rooms that are modern and spacious.",5,2016,08,14
132,"Lovely, stylish hotel in central London","We had the 'Alice in Wonderland' themed afternoon tea at Sanderson hotel, and we stayed the night there after taking in a show.

The hotel is stylish and modern.  The bedroom was big, comfortable and clean.  The staff were friendly and welcoming.  The hotel is situated between Oxford St and Googe St, with plenty of good pubs, restaurants, etc. nearby.

The afternoon tea was delicious.

The only snag was the full english breakfast - which was barely luke warm.",4,2016,08,13
132,Happy/impressed customer :),"Someone has really taken the time to think about the little details with this hotel. From the fragrance that hits you when you walk in that then links to the toiletries, to the standard rooms feeling like suites. I'm very impressed. The staff are warm and welcoming no matter who you are, and the hotel design has been well put together. We had a little service hiccup if you will while we were there and even that has been resolved swiftly and politely. The staff have a genuine nature and really do seem to care about your stay and service, which is something we really look for in hotel. Very happy customer :)",5,2016,08,11
132,Very Nice hotel but service was invisible,"Have stayed here a few times and its a pretty dark hotel in the hallways. The rooms are fine but very modernistic. My rooms AC malfunctioned so it would not turn off and the staff could get a technician to fix it before the next day, they could not move me to another room. Thats just not good enough for such a high level hotel.

The location is great in London and other facilities were really nice.",3,2016,08,10
132,Romantic and fun ,"My husband and I enjoyed staying here for one night celebrating our anniversary-it is a fun and quirky hotel, with a fabulous bar.

We had a wonderful time sampling the cocktails and we really enjoyed the design of our room.

Thank you for a memorable stay. ",5,2016,08,10
132,Wonderfully chic and modern hotel,"The bed was superbly comfortable (I could laze in it all day), and room service impeccable. The onsite Purple Bar (fantastic service and choice of cocktails), and Courtyard Garden were excellent also. The only negative things were the odd sparse bathroom arrangements with very little separation between the toilet and shower. The Long Bar is also not too far from the foyer, was incredibly noisy and boisterous in the evening,",5,2016,08,10
132,Cannot Rate High Enough,"I really cannot rate this hotel any higher, but I thought if my review helps someone in future looking for a modern, cool, stylish, original hotel, with amazing service then I am happy to write about it.

In the last two weeks I have stayed here twice. This first time we brought friends with us to stay the weekend for a birthday and the second time just my wife and I.

The concierge and reception staff are quite something. Jose was warm and welcoming and made us feel like nothing was too much trouble. 

We had a deluxe double each time and some complementary surprises which were unexpected and absolutely fantastic.

Even the toiletries are fresh and smell great - Malin and Goetz

We started our evening in the Long Bar with some expertly made cocktails. Went for dinner and finished our evening in the “Purple” residents bar with some more expertly made cocktails and long drinks. The bar staff in both bars here are really “five stars”, and can make anything you like, not even on the menu. And served with a smile and a chat!

Breakfast was once again fresh and delicious and served by the ever smiling waitress who has always remembered us from the time before.  

Our friends a said they had an amazing time and will come back to the Sanderson in a heartbeat. And of course, so will we……",5,2016,08,10
132,Great Stay,"Rooms are big for London standards, bar is buzzing, staff is cool and helpful, located in a quite street . Everything across the corner.
Breakfast can be a bit richer but does the job. 
I recommend this hotel to everyone looking for a trendy stay close to all shopping and entertainment.",5,2016,08,09
132,"Best location on London, comfy rooms","The best thing about this hotel is the location. Oxford Circus with its shops is 3 blocks away, Soho and Fitzrovia with their groovy restaurants and cafes are around the corner more or less. We did not use the underground and bus at all!! Breakfast was excellent: you can easily skip the cooked meal since the kitchen is good but not excellent, and stay with the generous variety of fruit and bakery on the buffet. The room is spacious enough if you compare to London hotels, our room had no bath tub, only shower.",4,2016,08,09
132,"Stunning hotel, incredible afternoon tea, great location!","Spent two nights in the Sanderson at the weekend, and is one of my favorite hotels in London. Such a great location, only a 5 min walk from Oxford Street and beyond. The hotel decor is quirky and the reception is very cool, the staff are excellent and more than happy to help. We had a standard room which was stunning, so modern and crisp and clean.

The Long Bar is uber cool, and had a great vibe for Friday night, super busy and was nice just sitting at the bar having a few drinks after dinner.

The concierge managed to book us a table for the famous afternoon tea, it's so busy on the Saturday that we really apprecaited being squeezed in. The afternoon tea is amazing, Alice in Wonderland themed Mad Hatter's Tea Party, and is a great expereince which I'd recommend. Again the staff were fantastic and I'd highly recommend trying it even if you don't stay there. Finally, thank you for an amazing weekend!",5,2016,08,02
132,Hotel Break with afternoon tea,"Enjoyed out stay would return as this hotel does have a cool twist with Alice theme , room was excellent and spacious . very comfy bed and very clean , lovely robes and slippers for comfort . huge bed was great for a 6/2 hubby so greta nights sleep.",5,2016,08,01
132,"All round good hotel, excellent location and spacious rooms.","This is a beautiful hotel in central London. Stunning spacious rooms with excellent facilities. We found the service to be excellent and enjoyed the hotel facilities, the bar has great cocktails is a wonderful location for some drinks before heading out into London. 

The design is very thought through, however it is a little over the top in places for my taste however still a very comfortable and modern place to stay.",4,2016,07,31
132,Sanderson Hotel,"We visited with family and stayed overnight, it was a lot of fun and the bed was very comfortable and ensured a great nights sleep. All amenities were in place and the room was clean. However the long bar was pretty but full of non paying guests, it was very loud and too bright and not for us, the purple bar was better although the service was very slow. The lifts are cool 3D space effect and the room numbers are set into the floor and lit up. All in all a enjoyable if short visit. Bear in mind the rooms are overly expensive for what they are, personally I'd look for a deal before using their direct booking facility.",4,2016,07,31
132,Mad Hatters Tea and an overnight stay,"When we arrived we where met by the modern dressed doormen who took and looked after our luggage as our room wasn't quite ready, so we then went to have a drink at the long bar before our Mad Hatters afternoon tea.

The only problem was that as we hadn't been given a room number we couldn't put the drinks on our bill, so the barman wanted to exchange my credit card for a key that opened a box that my credit card was going to be put into behind the bar. This was the only odd thing about an excellent stay. When we explained that we where having afternoon tea and our table was now ready we transferred to the courtyard with our drinks and bill which was added to our final afternoon tea bill.

We where excellently served for the two hours by an Italian young lady called Gracius (sorry about the spelling) and the food and experience where both superb.

We then went to our room which was a Deluxe room (upgrade) on the 3rd floor and wow what a room 😊. I agree with earlier reviewers that it was strange not having a plug in the washbasin and we did have to get a battery changed in the remote control, but everything else was very high class if minimal.  It would have been nice to have a hanging rail in the bedroom and not just in the bathroom though.

Thank you to Ruth at reception for the extra comforts provided and Isabel that I'd been communicating with prior to our stay about hypoallergenic pillows.

Every time we exited and came back the front of house team remembered us and asked if there was anything they could do for us.

At breakfast the next day not only was the service by our waitress Larissa top class, but the food and choice was top quality.

We checked out and went for a walk to Selfriges and back again before collecting our luggage and waiting for the hotel to get us a taxi.

This was a really new experience for us, as we are used to staying at more traditionally decorated and run hotels. But it was great fun and although the music from the bar could be heard until early on Sunday morning and the Aircon was a little noisy, the welcome, service and quality was worth 5 stars.

Thank you to everyone, we will be back",5,2016,07,31
132,Excellent stay as always,"My goto hotel in London. Just make sure you don't stay on the uk first floor as it can be loud if you are above the bar

Great location and outstanding service. Phil and Nigel are always super courteous and kind on the guest relations side.",5,2016,07,31
132,Loveeee,One of the best experiences! The best in London i think! Specially José he is super friendly and funny! loved everything 🙌😍 I really advise it to youuu! Very close to everything! nothing is far from this hotel! the staff is pretty amazing! and the rooms are really big and pretty! felt like home ,5,2016,07,30
132,Ms Alexandra wright,"An absolutely wonderful hotel full of quirky coolness, from the lobby, to the lifts,to the rooms with the most comfortable beds...friendly smiling staff made for an excellent 5* stay, thoroughly recommend it to anyone...perfect location for all your sightseeing requirements",5,2016,07,25
132,All round great boutique hotel,"The hotel is a modern boutique hotel with excellent food & beverage options. I found the lobby to be a bit over the top, but the actual hotel rooms were well designed spaces with a nice minimalist touch. Particularly thought the lighting was well done (with black-out blinds to make it easier to sleep in).

Was most pleasantly surprised by the staff, from the beginning to end everyone from the Doorman to Bellhop to Check-In was very friendly easily struck up a conversation.  

Just had time to check out the long bar, which is really a timeless place.",5,2016,07,25
132,A mixed experience,"We chose the Sanderson after a long period of staying at other hotels in Central London. We last stayed here in 2001 when it was still one of the hottest hotels in London with service to match. The reality is that there are now a lot of hotels which do what they used to do a lot better.
We arrived by cab at 11.15am, alas there were no door staff and we had to unload our large suitcases ourselves and drag them to reception. Receptionist was pleasant enough but asked us if we were OK to carry our bags to our room ourselves, also no offer to send someone to explain how the rooms worked since our long gap in using them.
Our twin room was OK, the features of pictures on the ceiling seem to be missing from this room, the door from the shower opens onto the clothing rail in the bathroom, there is a large crack in the frosted glass and a rail in front of the toilet paper holder making it impossible to put toilet roll on there.  
When we left on the evening for dinner there is no offer from the doorman to obtain a cab and no longer a line of cabs waiting outside should you need one and you therefore have to wander to look for one.
We asked for ice from room service in the evening, after a 25 minute wait we rang again to be told 'we are actually very busy' which in honesty no one really cares about when you are staying in a five star hotel. 
Breakfast the next day looked lovely, alas the staff will move your cereal which you are eating from to put the hot main course (which you asked for a five minute delay) in front of you. The chairs which you sit at tables are also like childrens chairs (hazardous if you are over 5ft tall) and the marble tables could also do with some repair. However quality of the cooked food and the open table to choose cereals etc are great quality.
The bar is still nice on an evening but no longer the hot spot of beautiful people that it once was but nothing to complain about.
I think my overall memory of The Sanderson is 'its alright', there really are now a lot of venues that are doing what they used to do a great deal better.",3,2016,07,25
132,Lovely escape in the heart of the West End.,"Everything about this hotel was first class.
I booked it as a deal on Secret Escapes as we needed to escape from a noisy party which the neighbours had threatened us with. I e-mailed the hotel telling them this and asking to be allocated a quiet room. Ibi, from the hotel responded immediately confirming our request.

When we checked in, Christina, the charming and efficient receptionist knew all about our request and, sure enough our bright and sunny room was on the 5th floor away from lifts and not overlooking the bar area. It was stylish, comfortable and boasted an enormous full-length mirror in great natural light. 

I had the best night's sleep I've had in a long time. The huge bed was really comfortable and blackout blinds allowed us to sleep until after 7.30. Exactly what we'd asked for.

I really liked the minimalist decor and thought the bathroom design, though a little quirky was clean, well laid out and, for the most part, functional.

Two very minor issues where practicality had been sacrificed for design - the taps which looked stylish were difficult to turn off with wet hands and no plug in the hand basin meant you always needed a running tap. 

All the staff we encountered were friendly and went out of their way to please. Of special mention, Marta in the Purple Bar made us several interesting cocktails and was happy to tell us all about them in very good English (She is Polish).

I would wholeheartedly recommend the Sanderson and would love to stay there again.

",5,2016,07,24
132,"Quirky, good breakfast but questionable service charges & noisy A/C","I've walked past this hotel many times without realising it was one. It's designed by Phillipe Starck which means it very quirky. Lots of nylon curtains (possibly due to the listed nature of the building). The lobby is full of funky designer chairs that are actually quite comfortable to sit in.

However, when we arrived in our room I noticed I nice package that said ""take home"". A moment later I read this was actual  £34 candle and contained instructions saying ""if the seal is broken or tampered with the item will be charged to your bill"". There are quite a few things like this in the room, e.g. proper shaving kits and the mini-bar. Understandable but you've just paid a lot for this room and immediately on entry it's threatening you with more. For a hotel this is not very hospitable.

The room itself was very good: Spacious, excellent & massive bed, USB charging. It was very clean. The oddities were all the taps were individual hot & cold rather than single mixer and toilet was really dull, non-designer and shoved in the corner.

What let the room down significantly though was the noise of the A/C. This kept me awake and when turned off the room got too hot which also kept me awake. After checking-in we mentioned the noise to the front desk and they apparently sent someone up. I think this may have more or less fixed the clanging sound but fan noise was still loud. Think fan oven! Recently I stayed in a 5* hotel in Barcelona. The temperature was maintained at 19C without any noise and recent stay in a Premier Inn
also included silent A/C. I do not understand how a 5* hotel in London can have such noisy A/C.

Later when having a drink we tried to order when outside but were told service had ended out here but we could order at the bar and brings our drinks out. Fine & so we did. However, I was then presented with a bill that included £2 service and empty box for a gratuity. Now given that I couldn't go a mix my own drink in the bar and it wasn't brought to me, what service did I actually receive. If I'd been less tired I'd have asked to have this removed. I think this smacks of the same attitude as the £34 candle!

Come the morning whilst I liked the place but was quite tired after a broken night due to the A/C I wasn't that keen on the place. However, breakfast was excellent and all the morning staff (from the lobby to the kitchens) were all very pleasant & helpful.

The location is good for tourist London & the food good (only tried breakfast) but fundamentally this is a hotel, a place to rest & sleep. The noisy air conditioning prevented this so it's hard to recommend unless you can get guaranteed silent A/C.",3,2016,07,23
132,Excellent hotel,"We loved the hotel.  It seems funky at first, but is actually very nice, with super-friendly staff and modern, clean decor in the room.  We didn't have the breakfast, but heard it was amazingly good.  Good location.  I also thought it was good value for the money.  ",5,2016,07,22
132,One of my favourite places,"Sanderson is such a happy place, we spent an absolutely wonderful weekend there last month - it was so special.  I have to say that Sanderson is one of my favourite places as you can't help but lose yourself in the pure indulgence the hotel offers.  Everyone is super friendly and go out of their way to make you feel at home.  We went with our young children and yet again I was truly impressed with the supreme service we received.  A special thanks goes out to Ricardo in The Restaurant and Thierry and all his terrific staff for arranging some delicious cocktails (for us - not the kids!).  We wish we could come every weekend, Sanderson - you rock!",5,2016,07,21
132,Trying too hard to be cool,"This hotel is like the person at the party that is trying so desperately to be hip, but failing miserably and everyone can see it. To be fair, I had a nice pleasant stay here. Rooms are comfortable, but not cozy. The bathroom fixtures are a perfect example of the personality of the hotel. They look great, but are featureless and as a result of you have wet hands are impossible to operate. It's a triumph of style over substance. One key high point - the breakfast restaurant. Food is wonderful and the staff are a delight. In particular Gabby was a rockstar in keeping me fueled with coffee while trying to kick start my jay lagged morning.

It wouldn't be the worst thing if I had to stay there again, but I can't help feeling that there are alternative places that would be my first pick. ",3,2016,07,21
132,Amazing customer service,"I stayed here for business and found the customer service, at every point, warm and responsive.  Every wake-up call was personal and on-the-dot.  Every room service order was perfectly timed, and they even remembered my breakfast order from day to day.  The Bell Captain, Phill, was so friendly, as was everyone at the front desk.  For a beautiful, trendy hotel in a great area, they were very unpretentious and very welcoming.   I would highly recommend.",5,2016,07,20
132,"A perfect hotel, problems with ''booking.com'' reservations ","We had a wonderful vacation in London while staying here but encountered some problems before the arrival after booking with ''Booking.com'' a room for 3.
We entered all details for a couple plus 1 child by the age of 12 and received a confirmation for a standard double room. After reading some reviews here at Trip Advisor and seeing it stated that 'the room is up to 2 persons only' I wanted to be certain no problems will occur on arrival but the Morgan hotel group help center was not helpful and said that if a room is stated to be up to 2 persons there is no way a child can be added not even in the parent's bed. Booking.com didn't help either and both suggested we should upgrade for a larger room for much more money. We had no choice and took the superior double room as they suggested. Of course the hotel policy had the same statement regarding this room too 'the room is up to 2 persons only'. We came anyway but were very dissapointed and angry for the extra money charged for a room which had also only 1 double bed and nothing else for the child, there was a sofa but a decorated one which could not be turned into a bed.
Beside that unfortunate and annoying experience we had a perfect time and really loved the hotel and the saff. When we came they were waiting us and new in advance we were 3 in the room. The doormen were extremely nice as were Paris and Anna from the reception and the concierge too. The room although for 2 people was magnificent, spacious and very well decorated. The whole stay was very pleasant. The location is great, near Oxford st. and not far from it's underground station.
I really recommend this hotel for a London city break.

Tip: Ask for a room not located at the end of the corridor since there is a building being constructed 2 houses away which makes some noise at certain times (so the side closer to the Oxford st. Is much quieter)",5,2016,07,19
132,"Fantastic, modern, trendy, unique [deluxe room]","I was only here for the one night but it was an absolutely impeccable (albeit brief!) experience. I arrived late at night where I was greeted by two very polite doormen. The staff were wonderful here. I was very impressed by the whole aesthetic of the place. From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave everything is perfectly finished, utterly modern and thoroughly intriguing. This hotel was out of the ordinary from my usual style but I found it a refreshing change and I'd be delighted to stay here again! Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2016,07,19
132,Boutique Hip Hotel Great Location,Sanderson is Blocks away from Oxford Street.  Great Location near lots to do.  The staff is up beat and extremely attentive to anything that i requested... The service from everyone was terrific... Special thanx to Christina at the front desk and Giancomo the concierge.,5,2016,07,19
132,Agua Spa,What a fantastic experience I had this afternoon for my Eve Lom facial with Christine! All the staff were so kind and their service absolutely seamless. I do love the setup - including the before and after treatment in the quiet spaces and steamroom. I'm looking forward to my appointment in August and will be booking more frequently. This was just what I needed to prepare for the crazy week ahead.,5,2016,07,18
132,Great visit,"Lovely chic modern hotel with very very well trained, attentive and most importantly happy staff...

We upgraded to a deluxe room and for a London hotel it was spacious and airy. Curtains broke up the room whilst keeping it open plan with a feeling that it was bigger than it actually was.

Very comfortable bed and good facilities.

The door staff were very pleasant and remembered you from second visit - receptionists were friendly and dealt with requests quickly and again with a smile! i hate having to keep on commenting that customer facing staff in London were smiling but it really is a rarity.

One tiny finicky negative - the taps throughout the hotel are an absolute nightmare to turn on/off! Especially with wet hands(which you usually have when using a shower/sink).... I have, what i thought was a strong grip too..... Albeit it, they are very aestheticly pleasing!

Obviously this is a tiny point, but thought i'd mention it :)

Thanks again for a great trip and look forward to staying again soon.",5,2016,07,18
132,Great Hotel,"My wife and me stayed for 5 days in the Sanderson last week. The hotel staff were very kind and helpful. the facilities are good and the hotel design is beautiful. Two remarks regarding the room:  the water tap is hard to manage, it seems that its design made the user experience a bit difficult. also the closet is actually designed shelves that look great but don't offer a lot of storage space. we got all that we asked , ironing board, coffee kit for the room, the ironing service was fast . in totally it was a very good experience and i highly recommend.  ",5,2016,07,18
132,Loved staying at the Sanderson! Amazing Staff!,"I was staying in another hotel in London, and was miserable. We ended up leaving that dump and moving into Sanderson and  LOVED IT. 

First of all the staff we lovely here. So friendly, helpful, professional and super competent. everything ran like clockwork, which I really appreciated. 

The room was very chic, clean, modern, and so comfortable. I can't say enough great things.  I ordered room service coffee and breakfast every morning and they delivered within 15-20 minutes of my call. One day even faster than that! 

Over all a wonderful experience, and will stay with them again if I have the  chance.",5,2016,07,17
132,"Cool, hip, convenient","Great stay - nice bed, nice room, great bar (the Long bar) and great location. We really enjoyed the atmosphere, facilities and amenities of this cool hip hotel. Suitable for both business and leisure travel in central London.",5,2016,07,17
132,Second time.... even better!,"Firstly, I am a fan of Morgan's Hotels and the Sanderson has a really good location for Oxford Street and the pubs/restaurants of Fitzrovia/Soho. Upon a arrival, we were upgraded to a loft suite which looked out over courtyard area.. the room was huge with separate bath and shower. The hotel itself has a buzzy atmosphere in the evenings, especially in the long bar. The breakfast is always excellent with attentive staff. If you like slightly quirky furniture, low lights, spacious minimal rooms and a good location then I would recommend the Sanderson!",5,2016,07,17
132,A great last minute stay!,"An impromptu stay at this wonderful piece of luxury in W1. We were there for one night and were not disappointed. The rooms are gorgeous and tastefully decorated. The beds are super comfortable and the highlight for me was seeing my favourite brand of toiletries (Malin & Goetz) in their bathrooms. Love it! The rooms are gorgeous, the detail and style throughout the hotel is still timeless and subtle. A lively bar and great restaurant mean you don't need to leave the hotel if you don't feel like going anywhere.
Apart from a startling fire alarm at 8am the following morning - and entire hotel evacuation - it was a fun and comfortable experience. Staff are friendly and helpful - breakfast and coffee were complimentary due to annoying fire alarm incident. All in all, a fabulous one night stay at the Sanderson.",5,2016,07,16
132,Friendly staff @amazing hotel.,"I stayed here for 3 nights only but everything made feel amazing, I have stayed with many high ranges hotel but this one made me say wow... This great value for money nice room with model decorations to the staff are extremely friendly too the breakfast in the morning was also perfect.. I knew that am not good enough to say about this hotel but better tried.

Moura ",5,2016,07,15
132,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"We visited for two days in July. Our flight arrived early so we were at the hotel at 9AM. Our room was not ready but we needed to shine and change as we were meeting friends for lunch. The hotel sent us to the spa where we were able to use the steam room, shower, and relax before our lunch. On our return our room was ready with our bags. We had a deluxe room which is very spacious. We love the modern design. Had pre-dinner cocktails in the garden which was a lot of fun. Can walk to the theater and many good restaurants. Nothing bad to say. Can't wait to return!",5,2016,07,14
132,London Break,Its the second time we have stayed and it was very much style over substance. The service was poor particularly at the bar. Whilst not young and beautiful any more its still nice to be served at some point.!!!,3,2016,07,13
132,Bliss,"Loved my stay at the Sanderson, our balcony was spacious and very well designed. Loved the feel of the hotel very quirky. Breakfast in the morning was delicious, no complaints. Purple bar is quirky and modern with a fantastic pool table- needs new pool ques though. The stain glass in the pool room is stunning, worth a look see. Really enjoyed my stay would come back.",5,2016,07,12
132,EXCELLANT !,"I have stayed in many hotels at many, varied price ranges -this was great value for money (for London !), clean & decorated to a high & stylish standard, well located & elegant . My dreams of staying at one of the Morgan chain hotels were not disappointed. Beyond the superb décor & smart touches was the most exceptional experience of an entire of team of very upbeat, pleasant, vibrant & helpful staff. Not a misery amongst them. They must be on something to remain so genial 24/7 ! Congratulations their H.R.  manager on such great staff selected",5,2016,07,11
132,Attention to detail at the Sanderson is impeccable ,"What an amazingly beautiful hotel. 

Fun, quirky and if you're looking for something contemporary with an edge then the Sanderson ticks all the boxes. 

The room was spacious, the bed was super comfy and the decor was bright with use of long flowing curtains to separate the space for privacy. 

The bathroom took a bit of getting used to, the only thing I would say here is, if you are planing a romantic weekend away with a new partner be aware that the whole room is open plan and the only thing separating you in the toilet/ bathroom from the main bedroom is a flowing curtain and glass walls. If you want complete privacy then just bear it in mind- but it didn't bother us at all.

The staff on reception are so helpful and made us feel very welcome throughout our stay. 

The breakfast in the morning was just what we needed to set us up for a busy day and after a big night out in London the night before! 

Highly recommended hotel. You won't regret it! ",5,2016,07,11
132,Go Sanderson!,"Used to stay at this hotel back when I was travelling a lot to London.  If you are into contemporary design this place is a delight to the senses.  This was a return trip years later with family for a holiday and I was expecting it to feel dated.  Pleased to find that attention to detail was still there.  No aspect of the experience is undesigned - however it is also a bit quirky.  For example some of the plumbing could be more convenient :) - but its so pretty!  Used the spa, restaurant and bar - great service and food.  Location amazing.  Concierge got us into Sketch during Wimbledon so well done there too.  Best hotel in London if you like design.",5,2016,07,09
132,Disappointing and charmless,"I was staying for one night on business. I'd visited the bar previously and liked it very much. For sure the bar and lobby area are stunning. The smell is amazing and there's a sense of luxury that hits you when you walk in. However this atmosphere doesn't continue to the bedroom.

My bedroom was sterile. Yes minimalism is trendy but this felt there were costs cut all over the place making simple activities frustrating. The tap in the sink was placed incorrectly meaning you got water all down the back of the sink and up the glass wall behind it. The shower similarly was hard to use and water went all over the bathroom floor. No bath. Even the wardrobe was located in the bathroom behind a net curtain. 
The bathroom was in a glass box in the bedroom concealed by a net curtain. There was absolutely no charm to the room or sense of luxury.

It felt very cheap and absolutely not worth the rather high price per night. 

It is noisy outside but I guess this is absolutely standard for a hotel in central London. The location is very good for central London.

The doorman was absolutely charming however!",2,2016,07,08
132,Excellent stay at the Sanderson,"Great hotel for the design lover and who likes a hotel with a little ambiance. Great location too. 
The room was very spacious and bathroom beautiful and spacious. Enjoyed using the gym and the lovely spa. Every detail in this hotel is well thought through. Definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2016,07,08
132,Amazing stay!,"My husband and I stayed over Whitsun weekend.  What a welcome...  Beautiful hotel, fabulous bar and outside area.  We felt very welcome.  Breakfast was superb, lots of choice.  A very special thank you to Paris who organised a special treat for our anniversary!  All in all a most wonderful stay and we will not hesitate to stay again and recommend to our friends/family.",5,2016,07,06
132,Perfect location,"The room is kitted with high quality linens and a very comfortable bed. I only needed basic internet and it was free and reliable. The gym is the best hotel gym I've used, well equipped and big. I only ate one meal in the hotel, breakfast, but it was delicious and the wait staff were attentive and friendly. I'm not a huge fan of Ian Schraeger designed hotels although I've stayed in many and this one was comfortable and functional except the bedside light was definitely more form than function and could have been better. I had a very nice stay overall. No complaints. My room was extremely clean. ",5,2016,07,04
132,She said YES thanks to Sanderson - incredible hotel and experience,"I need to start this review by saying a huge thank you to Paris for helping me propose to my long term girlfriend. The experience was truly incredible and my (now) fiance loved every minute of it. The Deluxe suite was stunning, very spacious. The bathroom was amazing. The food and drinks at the restaurant were delicious. Everything about this place was stunning. You have no idea you're in the center of London, it is an oasis. The facilities are remarkable. I could not have higher praise for what is without doubt the best and nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. ALL of the staff are very polite and helpful. Thanks again Paris and Sanderson. We will treasure this memory for ever.",5,2016,07,04
132,Good staff but no privacy within room,"I stayed here a couple of years ago and so am writing this as a returning guest. It is great to see the bar has retained its trendy vibe and the cocktails are excellent. Reception is welcoming and the staff are very good, particularly Cristina who noticed on her later shift that we had been unfairly charged for coffees/croissants and refunded the costs immediately. 
Weak points:-
This is a major problem for me : the bathroom facilities within the suite are a joke - just  little smoked glass panels that afford no privacy whatsoever;
There was a cigarette stub on the terrasse that ought to have been removed;
Balcony was unusable as the furniture was dirty and there were no soft furnishings provided. Ok, we could have called reception to have cushions delivered but, come on, do we really need to do that? In a suite? In June?",3,2016,07,03
132,Great hotel for the weekend,"We had a lovely weekend in the Sanderson.  Excellent staff and wonderfully cool rooms. 

I have stayed in its one time sister St Martin's Lane, the Sanderson is streets ahead.  Moving away from is standard office building facade you move into an urban haven of cutting edge design.  I agree this type of interior is not to everyone's taste bit if you like design and quirkiness than look no further.  

The deluxe room was spacious and comfortable.  The highlight was the bathroom,  room service breakfast was fine, nothing wow.  We did not use the bar or restaurant on this occasion.",5,2016,07,02
132,"Superb stay, everything was perfect, one of my favourite hotels in London","With the modern white marble and glass interior and Oxford street location you really cant help but love the Sanderson Hotel. I am currently here on a stop over I am loving the decor. Our midsize room has a glass bathroom. The toilet and shower are opaque glass, you can create more privacy by drawing two sets of curtains, so if you don't like glass bathrooms then don't book and complain afterwards! The room service was fast and the meal very delicious. Try the super green smoothie so nice! The staff are all very helpful and friendly. We got a top floor room so no noise problems. The bed is really comfy. Wifi is free and fast. The lobby has pretty cool furniture the long bar and games room. The spa was awesome. Highly recommend this hotel. I would suggest to the manager a toilet brush in the toilet area and two glasses for drinks in the room. The exterior of the building could be updated.",5,2016,07,01
132,Great pool table...x,Great location just off Oxford Street with plenty of good bars and restaurants within walking distance. Room was spacious and clean with a bit of style. Shame the beautiful courtyard was too busy to use but the bar was lively (and expensive ). Free purple pool table was a bonus...Great night!,4,2016,06,30
132,Regular Business Visitor,"I've stayed in the Sanderson numerous times for business purposes. The staff are always extremely pleasant and the hotel is well run. The quirky decor makes the hotel feel modern and innovative but unfortunately forgoes function for style in a number of areas. When travelling for work, I generally want a hotel room that's comfortable and functional but the Sanderson's rooms are better equipped for people that are travelling for leisure. The room service menu is pretty sparse in terms of options and expensive for the calibre of the food.
The Malin & Goetz toiletries are always a pleasant treat and the cocktails in the downstairs bar are fantastic.",4,2016,06,30
132,Aqua spa,"Went to the aqua spa  at the Sanderson hotel today. It was my first time, it was amazing Diane who did my massage and facial was excellent and very professional as were all the staff. A very relaxing atmosphere. Will definitely recommend and will be coming back. ",5,2016,06,29
132,"Pleasent stay, beautiful rooms, great breakfast...","I stayed in the Sanderson hotel with work and it's always a pleasure, the outside of the building is deceiving and doesn't do it justice at all. The rooms are spacious and well lit, the cleanliness was impeccable and the staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast is so yummy with a cooked or continental choice, the omelettes are so nice. The only downfall of this hotel is that is a little noisy, there is a foundation in a small outdoor section that backs onto some of the rooms and it sounds like a dripping tap all night, they should consider turning this off, also the walls are thin and you can hear other people's muffled voices. All in all great hotel. Great location.",4,2016,06,29
132,Great location,"Great location, lovely rooms and interesting decor. The rooms are really well thought out, comfortable and super clean. The staff are friendly and attentive.
As others have said, the rooms on the first floor that overlook the courtyard are a little noisy but I didn't mind that too much as for Central London , the hotel is generally remarkably calm",5,2016,06,26
132,Disappointing trip!,"Room was fine albeit housekeeping had left door open one evening by accident fortunately nothing stolen. 

Tea making facilities had to be requested and took over 30 mins to arrive with the excuse provided simply that the hotel was busy!

All in all a disappointing trip for what was meant to be a special weekend.",2,2016,06,26
132,Lovely stay ,"Booked a suite with terrace for my husbands birthday and because we were going to a show nearby-we do live in London but fancied treating he service here is excellent, it felt genuine and everyone we came across was lovely. A few minor irritations that don't affect my 5 star rating as easily fixed. No salt and pepper on table for dinner (brought when asked for it) and none delivered with our room service breakfast (make sure you ask!). Also we didn't notice until we left that there was a card on the bedside table that said we had to ask for cushions for the outside seats (we wish we had known as we couldn't sit outside as the chairs were not comfortable). 

My tip is to check everything and ask for everything you need straight away. The service is great and personalised and they will do anything you need. ",5,2016,06,26
132,Absolutely Amazing hotel stay!,"This was one of the best hotels I've stayed at - not only for its cool and contemporary style - but for the outstanding service from the moment of booking.

All the staff were more than accommodating, we were allowed early check in on availability, offered a free breakfast as it wasn't part of our booking and offered to have a free late check-out, as we had spa reservations at the Agua spa in the hotel the following day. 

Guiseppe who was at the front desk was overly helpful and offered what i would call incredibly outstanding service. We will be coming back! 

Ridiculously good.",5,2016,06,23
132,Memorable stay ,"Amazing amazing amazing, cannot even begin how amazing our stay was from start to finish! We were greeted as soon as we got out of the taxi by a lovely gentleman that took our bags from us, then we checked in by a lovely man who sadly I did not catch his name, he upgraded our room which was so generous of him. We were in London for the weekend celebrating my boyfriends birthday, they kindly provided us with champagne and cake on arrival to our room. The reception area smelt absolutely amazing aswell! The room was a amazing, they small touches really counted by putting rose petals on the bed, everything was beautiful and the beds were so comfy! The hotel is very well looked after by the House keeping which were amazing! In the evening we came back to the hotel for cocktails, we went to the long bar was was incredible, the cocktails were so good and the bar men were very lovely and always made sure we were ok and had a drink in our hands! The cocktails were such masterpieces! The outdoor area was so lovely and very relaxing, everyone is so friendly! We then went to the purple room which was exclusive to the guests, such a lovely way to finish the night! Again the barman was great, could not fault a thing! The lady's at reception were amazing and so helpful with getting our transport sorted and recommending places we could go! To finish our visit off we had breakfast in bed, the breakfast was delicious, I definitely would recommend the blueberry pancakes! All the staff were incredible, I cannot thank the hotel enough for making my boyfriends birthday weekend extra special! I will definitely be returning to the Sanderson very soon, a very memorable weekend! ",5,2016,06,20
132,"Great hotel, great location, friendly but not fussy!","Excellent stay at Sanderson London. People are really friendly, great atmosphere in the bar, good value and good location. Black out blinds and great pillows, got the best sleep I've had for ages! Room is very clean, you have to ask for a kettle but it comes really quickly then they replenish throughout your stay.",5,2016,06,20
132,"Amazing hotel, fantastic service","Where to start. The Sanderson is just fabulous. Not least because of the design. The rooms are spacious, modern, spotlessly clean, so we'll appointed. The bed super comfy with top quality linens.

Not just a top quality hotel but the service is first class too. The way the staff recognise you, and accurately predict your needs before you know them yourself is incredible. Right from check-in throughout the stay. And the recognition of a special occasion with a bottle of Chamagne and note in the room was just lovely.

Would recommend the Sanderson to everyone looking for a top quality hotel with first class service. Can't wait to go back.",5,2016,06,19
132,Sanderson is an experience!,"An amazing hotel experience, very well located less than 1 min walk from Oxford St. that means good access to the underground, endless shopping and good eats from fast food to fine dining. As you enter the lobby you will get the modern, trendy and lively ambiance! The staff are another story, everybody is very welcoming, nice, friendly, helpful and thoughtful. By getting in the elevator you will get out of this world I’ll leave that to you to experience it. 

The rooms are my favorite part, comfy, modern, minimal and cozy! It was funny that I felt so comfortable in bed to the extent that I didn’t want to leave and spend my vacation in the room and what helped more is the fantastic room service! Usually I don’t order room service anywhere! As I like to eat out, It happened that I got to the hotel so hungry and I ordered room service to be specific “Kale Salad + poached eggs” damn it that salad got me so hooked!

Don’t miss going to the spa, it feels like modern Alice in wonderland is a nice way for sure.

Defiantly I’ll stay there again and again.

Thanks for the wonderful experience.",5,2016,06,17
132,"Nice hotel, a little too loud","We had a nice week-long stay at this hotel. Staff is very attentive and helpful. 

There is an unusual, whimsical decor throughout. To give you a sense of how unusual: there was nothing on the walls of our room, but there was a small framed painting on the ceiling. Weird. Outside of that, the rooms are comfortable. Location is very convenient to Oxford Circus and lots of shopping. 

The only real downside to this hotel is the restaurant and bar in the lobby get a little ""clubby"" at night, especially weekends. Because of this, I wouldn't recommend this hotel for a business stay. We stayed on the second floor and the music from the bar was very loud until closing. If we were to stay again, I would request a room on the highest floors.",4,2016,06,14
132,Sanderson - GREAT!,"The hotel is fun - clean - friendly. Very close to both Oxford Station (Central, Victoria and Bakerloo lines) and Tottenham Court Station (Central and Northern). 14 pound 20 minute taxi ride form Paddington Station when the Heathrow Express drops off. Rooms are big enough with good circulation.",5,2016,06,13
132,I've fallen in love...,"My partner and I had the pleasure of staying over night at Sanderson Hotel in The Loft Suite. Our overall experience of the stay was seamless with everyone very friendly and welcoming,  from Ruth informing us about the room on arrival through to security helping us with a photos and the sexy red lips sofas so we could capture the moment of this stay.

Our waiters and bar staff were very attentive serving delicious food and knockout cocktails. 
 
I've fallen in love with the place and it will be first on my list next time I need to stay in London for the night.",5,2016,06,13
132,enjoyable stay,"Overall an enjoyable stay, would I say it's worth the very large price tag, probably not. First of all only a continental breakfast was included in our price for nearly £300 a night, I'd really expect a hot breakfast for that. No tea or coffee making facilities or iron and ironing board (although these were available by request). Room service was quite expensive and came luke warm and there was very little of it. The room was very nice and contemporary but they layout of the bathroom was not to our taste at all, no plug socket near the dressing mirror, no privacy in the toilet really, just a few net curtains and no bath. The foyer is very nice as is the purple bar, although they stock very few beers. We recently stayed at the Mondrian which was roughly half the price and a far superior hotel in every way in our opinion.",4,2016,06,12
132,Lovely Birthday Weekend,"We stayed here last weekend for my wife's 30th birthday, the hotel were more than accommodating, offering us a free upgrade and even arranging for a complimentary bottle of champagne and desert sent with a personalised hand written note wishing my wife a happy birthday.
The room was superb and very modern, and the room service even more so, couldn't recommend this hotel more, it was very affordable and in an ideal location.
Can't wait to stay here again .",5,2016,06,09
132,Business trip,Me and my wife were visiting London for business and stopped over night at the hotel. We booked the Sanderson as it was close to where we needed to be and also my wife liked the look of the hotel from the pictures on the website. When we arrived the hotel did not disappoint the reception is fantastic and the staff welcoming. The check in was quick and we were soon up in our room. The room was a decent size and the layout was good. The bed was very comfy and we both had an excellent nights sleep. The long bar is great it has a nice vibe and the staf are attentive. We did not eat at the restaurant at night as we were eating out. The breakfast is superb. My wife travels to London on business and she says she will be  useing this hotel. It is definitely worth staying here.,5,2016,06,08
132,Fabulous Birthday Weekend,"We booked this hotel for my husbands 50th Birthday Weekend and we were not disappointed in any way!!

We had booked a standard double room as we had loads planned and even that room looked great. A couple of days before I rang to enquirer if it was possible for them to put a small surprise in the room for my husband, the request was met with enthusiasm and no hesitancy. 

We arrived slightly later than planned and rushed out but nothing again was too much trouble from quickly moving our cat to taking bags and giving us great directions. 

When we came back and into the room not only had we been upgraded to a fabulous room we had cakes, champagne and petals on the bed. 

The location was good and every member of staff was friendly and efficient. 

It was a pleasure to stay. ",5,2016,06,08
132,Surrealistic Luxury at its very best,"From the intriquingly beautiful lobby, the sophisticated long bar, to their urban garden restaurant and the sumptuous spa, this hotel oozes character and deservedly ranks high on everyones must go list.",5,2016,06,08
132,Great to be back !,"Back again in the Sanderson after some time away from London it's great to see the place is still delivering super and friendly service! Very comfortable room, attentive staff, excellent breakfast.

Also great to see the Long Bar humming in the evening. Great atmosphere!

LuxembourgJohn",5,2016,06,08
132,Fantastic hotel and staff ,"I don't know where to start with Sanderson, me and my partner stayed for a weekend to celebrate our birthdays.
from the moment we walked through the door all the staff were exceptional and couldn't do enough for you, and I have to mention paris especially who was very welcoming when checking in and made the stay extra special by arranging some surprises for us. 
The location is excellent for shopping and the theatres it's around a 5 minute walk form Oxford street and 20 minutes to the theatre district. 
We stayed in the loft suite with terrace, if you can do it I would defiantly recommend as the room is so spacious, the bed are very comfortable and the room had all the amenities you would need, I especially like the harmon kardon Bluetooth speaker as we were attending a concert on the Sunday night playing some music got us raring to go. 
We didn't eat in the restaurant but had room service in two occasions, the food was lovely and arrived quickly. 
Again at breakfast all the staff were lovely, if the weather is nice sit out in the garden and the blueberry pancakes are to die for.

The cocktails in the purple bar were wonderful as was the barman who made some great recommendations and came over to explain the drinks to us (sorry didn't get his name).
We also tried the cocktails in the long bar which were also amazing, my only regret was not visiting the bar during the evening as the atmosphere looked great but was to busy to get a seat. 
I have stayed in a number of 5 star hotels in London but I have to say the Sanderson is my favourite I love the contemporary feel the hotel has and will defiantly make it my place to stay in London cannot wait to go back and have those pancakes again. ",5,2016,06,07
132,My favourite hotel ,"I absolutely love this hotel, I love the bar, the food, the rooms, the espresso martinis. Fantastic service, I've been many times and I have never been disappointed. Exceptional staff, really recommend staying here If you get the chance. Location is great really central. ",5,2016,06,03
132,"Great property, World Class staff.","This 'designer' hotel is extremely comfortable, with fantastic bedrooms and beds you'll not want to get out of!  But what really sets the Sanderson apart is the staff, i've been 'in the trade' for 30 years and these are at the top of their game, nothing was too much trouble and everything done was with a smile, flair and attention to detail that so many miss. Can't wait to stay again, Thank you.",5,2016,06,03
132,Sanderson experience complaind 29.05.2016 - 30.05.2016,"Dear Sanderson hotel,

I would like like to express my vast disappoinment with the experience I had with Sanderson hotel on 29th of May and 30th of May. First my name is Radoslav Todorov, I was booked by my company for a Stay on 29th of May and 30th of May, 2016. I did sent you a copy of my ID card on the following e-mail address: db@bacchuscreative.com on 20.05.2016 from my e-mail address, which is radoslav_iliev_todorov. After me and my coleagues arrived on 29.05.2016 I checked in and filled in a blank with my info and I was told that I was booked with room 610, I had an appointment later and the room's was not ready yet so I was told by the receptionist that I can check in after I returned. I did left my luggage and I was told that it was going to be transfered in my room too. After I returned to the hotel several hours later I was provided with a pass - but I aknowledged that two other colleagues were booked in my room instead of me. Their names were Peter Stoyanov and Georgi Georgiev, they told me that they had filled in a blank too and were located in room 610. I returned to the lobby and provided the receptionists with the information, and they told me that they could not find client with the name Radoslav Todorov. This was quite shocking for me and it was too late to react. Later I aknowledged that I have received an invitation e-mail response to my earlier e-mail with my ID, but my name was written wrong - as Svetoslav Todorov and not Radoslav Todorov. The receptionists explained me that after 610 was booked by my colleagues I was moved to room 612 - but right now there was an other couple redirected to the room. So basically I was left without a room. The receptionists agreed to provide me with a room - but if i pay a deposit of 100 GBP - and after that the organizer approves that. We contacted the organizer of the group but she was told too that my name was wrong. I did get a room - which was 124 and the deposit was taken from my credit card. I would like to express my dissapointment with this situation and to insist an refund of my deposit - as my booking was already paid but I WAS NOT provided with a room by your mistake. Would like to have my deposit returned to my credit card. Kindly check the records and fix my mistake because it was very inconvenient, irritating and stressfull experience.

Kind regards,
Radoslav Todorov",2,2016,06,01
132,"Great hotel, service could be better","Enjoyed our stay, would do it again. The best bits:
- room was very nice, spacious and contemporary
- the long bar is a great place for cocktails. Service in the purple bar was also excellent
- reception staff were efficient
To improve on:
- breakfast service was terrible. The staff were slow, and did not work together... Waited ages to order hot dishes, coffee took an ice age to arrive, and when we tried to place an order with one waiter, he had to call another to do it (since it was not ""his"" table). Honestly just get on with it. The manager in charge also did not look like she wanted to help out and just stood looking over the restaurant doing nothing for most of the time we were there. They also tried to tell us that breakfast was not included in our room rate, so we had to send the waiter back to check again and correct him... must try harder. All it would take is some better training and to get the team to work as one, and communicate clearly through a stronger manager.",4,2016,05,30
132,Trendy yet comfortable,"I was concerned about the Sanderson due to the style which is not exactly traditional.  However the staff and service level is exceptional and the rooms quite comfortable after you adjust to the fact that the only picture in the room is mounted on the ceiling above the bed.  It seems like a fantastiplace for the 25-40 crowd but, I'm nearly 60 and found it to be excellent.",5,2016,05,30
132,Great,"Been here several times and will return several more. Just love everything about this place. 
The bar is a fantastic place to start the evening off and to end the evening after a night out.
Breakfast is good and varied but have it with a package as its expensive as an add on.",5,2016,05,30
132,Amazing Boutique Hotel,Stayed there last month. The room is incredible. Very spacious bathroom as well with nice bathtub and very nice robes. Very chic and modern but comfortable at the same time. Staff very attentive and helpful. Bar at the lobby is great! Would definitely come back and recommend it.,5,2016,05,30
132,"Nice hotel, small improvements needed","Stayed at the Sanderson and thought the check in staff Amy and Paris were lovely very polite and quick at checking people in without making you feel rushed. CJ the door man was also a very nice guy and easy to talk to. The hotel rooms are in
My opinion very nice and are pleasant to spend time in them. 
At breakfast the food was very nice but for a five star hotel I did not feel that the staff were very attentive at bringing menus and also we had to ask for milk for our teas and coffee. That said I really liked the hotel and would recommend it to others.",4,2016,05,25
132,Another Great Stay at Sanderson,"A wonderfully funky hotel, with great amenities and centrally located!

The hotel is nothing to look at from the exterior, but once you go through doors it is an amazing surprise. The long bar is amazing, with friendly/knowledgeable staff. The Purple Bar is good for residents, but can be a little quiet!

Overall a great hotel!",5,2016,05,23
132,Just Amazing.,"Me and my friend stayed here in the standard double room which was incredible. Super clean, modern - we were impressed! Its literally right on Oxford Street (short walk from Tottenham court road or Oxford Circus). Great for a shopping weekend stay. 

We then went to the bar waiters were superb always checking up on us, great atmosphere too. The staff really made this hotel for us they couldn't be more helpful. 

Definitely must try this hotel!!!",5,2016,05,23
132,"Stunning, Relaxed and Contemporary ","Morgans hotel group have done it again. A beautiful spot, I will continue to support the hotel chain. I booked into the spa and had a very warm and welcoming response from the staff.  A very professional approach throughout the hotel. The masseuse was excellent and I will be returning in the near future. ",5,2016,05,21
132,love this hotel,"i have stayed  here lots due to work and love the quirky decor and the beds are soooo comfy. 
the staff are great , lovely and friendly. great food, wine etc. great outdoor seating if you want on summer nights .
only downside... I love a kettle in my room.....",5,2016,05,19
132,Beautiful unique hotel,"The hotel was beautifully and uniquely furnished; however, they don't go above and beyond in service considering the price. Their bar service is great and the location cant be beat. Its near areas that are awake after hours. ",4,2016,05,17
132,Best hotel in London,Amazing staff and hotel . Everything was perfect . Check in was very nice and quick that I didnt wait. My room was ready and staff was helper and smile all the time . Sandreson will be my fav hotel in London,5,2016,05,16
132,Birthday and anniversary,"My husband and I visited on the 14th may for the night as it was his birthday and our anniversary. When we arrived check in was quick and the lady was super friendly. As we walked in our room there was beautiful white rose petals on the bed a bottle of champagne and a scrumptious slice of cake with the words congratulations. 
The rooms are extremely clean with the modernness I love the curtain separation to the bathroom; the bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in of all 5*.
We visited a resteraunt by the time we was back the room had had its night service and to make it romantic candles were lit.
The snooker table was a great little gesture to the hotel which we used.
I can't explain how beautiful and elegant the decor is in this hotel it's definitely the best we've seen.
Just would like to thank Alex one of the male staff at the hotel I believe he worked on the door to. We had a problem with our door but he was quick to get this issue fixed and escorted us to a complimentary breakfast which was fabulous and tasted amazing.
Overall will definitely be visiting again and recommending to other couples it's definitely a romantic hotel to choose",5,2016,05,15
132,Outstanding Hotel,Decided on an anniversary weekend in London at Sanderson and wasn't disappointed.  Massive thanks has to go to Paris who went out of her way to make it a weekend to remember.  They spoilt us with petals on the bed and lots of extras which I thought demonstrated what Morgan Hotels are all about.  Breakfast was out of this world too.  Can't wait to come back.,5,2016,05,15
132,"SANDERSON, BERNERS STREET, W1","The staff were very welcoming and polite.  The room was a good size and a pleasant space to be in.
The bed was very comfortable. We were there at weekend but I would recommend it to anyone needing a business hotel.   ",5,2016,05,14
132,Cool hotel near everything,"I stayed 3 nights in this cool hotel. Just a walk from Covent Garden, Soho and Oxford Street. The street is not busy. The room was excellent and clean. Nice staff. Great restaurant. Ate a dinner which was good and service was perfect. Definitely gonna visit Sanderson again.",5,2016,05,11
132,A perfect weekend,"I have yet to find fault with the Sanderson.  I regularly stay here because it is so good and I have got used to the highest of standards.  Located just off Oxford Street, it is ideally placed for theatres and shopping.  The hotel itself is beautifully presented: I love the ""lips"" sofa and the space themed lifts.  The rooms are always lovely with crisp, clean, so comfortable beds, the restaurant delightful.  The staff are amazing: they really understand the concept of customer service and it is always a pleasure dealing with them.",5,2016,05,10
132,"""Sanderson"" a Great experience ","I stayed at Sanderson with my mum for four nights. The location is very strategic with everything you need just a walk distance. At the check in we were greeted by Paris who graciously give us a room upgrade and made our stay very memorable with nice fruits sent up to our room. Slavo and Sandor in the room service were great, quick service and very polite! We would like to thank also Renata and Brenda and all breakfast stuff. Linxi and Ruth at the front desk always smiling and great guest service! I will definitely stay at Sanderson again! ",5,2016,05,09
132,A 4 days stay in couple,"A wonderful stay in the heart of the town but far away from the roaming of the town, surrounded by a tremendous design, making the environment peaceful. 
Beginning with a warm wellcome back from the nice people from the front desk, always warmfull and professional, paying attention to your personal needs.
A stay magnified by a fabulous concierge, Mike Fitzgerald, with very special skills not only to find the perfect restaurants for you but also...to get a table!
Special thanks to Paris Barati and Ana Bernatovica at office and front desk, always having an ""eye"" on your well-being during your stay.",5,2016,05,08
132,Another fantastic stay ,"Me and my husband stayed at the Sanderson last night , I'm absolutely in love with this hotel , the staff are all amazing (especially Paris ) our room was absolutely gorgeous , the long bar cocktails our superb it's our only choice of hotel to stay in now while in London just wish we could afford to stay here more often , thanks Sanderson and thanks so much Paris for the beautiful touch in our room !! ",5,2016,05,08
132,Bad start but redeemed themselves....,"I stayed at the Sanderson this weekend for my mum's 50th birthday celebrations. When I booked the room I let them know the reason for the visit and made it clear that I wanted it to be a special experience for my mum. We dropped our bags off at around 10.30am and they said we would be able to check in at 3pm. At 3pm we were told it would be another hour, this was because the person that had the room the night before had only just checked out! The hotel's checkout time is 12pm, so why had this person been allowed to stay for an additional 3 hours!? Anyway, eventually when the room was ready they gave us 2 cocktails on the house and left a nice piece of cake with a birthday message along with a bottle of bubbly for my mum in the room. So they redeemed themselves! 

Other than that the stay was pleasant and I would return. The room was spacious (shower wasn't great) and clean. The bed was comfy which is always a bonus.

The most important thing is that my mum had a lovely weekend. ",4,2016,05,08

132,Starck,"Design by Starck. Who else can give a hotel such a crazy, but elegant design and adopt a former office building to a hotel?:) the elevator walls designed as galaxy, sofas are swans and lips, room is minimalistic with design details. They have malin+goetz and bath amenities. Shaving kit and some other extras are provided for charge. They have twice a day room cleaning, preparing candles, sweets and flowers and refilling water. Great place to stay.",5,2016,05,03
132,First Class In Everything,"This stay was a birthday present for my daughter.  From the first, the staff were superb - interested and helpful, so a big thank you to Alis and Paris!  The location of this hotel is excellent for central London and for a five star hotel it is very competitive.  The hotel is design led and there is a huge amount to delight and surprise, in central areas and the beautiful bedroom my daughter stayed in.  So if you want the best in service, location, room and individuality, Sanderson London is where you should go.",5,2016,05,03
132,Sanderson made my trip a dream vacation,"It's very rare that I have a near perfect experience in staying in a hotel, but Sanderson hit that mark. The hotel itself makes you feel like you've transported to a home of a celebrity. I very much enjoyed the modern and unique decor. The location can't be beat for walking to nearly everything. I was visiting London to celebrate my 40th birthday and the hotel staff  took extra care to ensure I was well taken care of.  If I visit London again, I'll definitely be looking at the Sanderson. ",5,2016,05,02
132,A night away,"Brilliant night away. I booked on secret escapes who always come up trumps. Had visited the hotel before for a cocktail but never stayed. The room was clean and fresh, the bed linen is super quality. We had a deluxe room and the bath was huge. Lovely products too. The staff are unbelievably polite and always eager to help. The drinks are pricey but it's LONDON!!!!.they taste very good though. Breakfast is ample and very fresh. Waiters are polite and eager to please.",5,2016,05,02
132,Luxury at its best....,"I stayed in one of the Sanderson loft suites. 

I highly recommend it. 

The simple yet elegantly designed luxury was the tone of the room.

The patio  balcony was simple, but the opportunity to have an outside view was too much to miss.

The open design of the shower and sunken bath was fabulous.

The service is impeccable and the on site Spa is a must visit .

",5,2016,04,30
132,Hipster place to stay,"The experience starts at the door. Friendly staff and awesome reception. Funky psychedelic furniture and artwork. Get into the lift and your in space. 
Check in very easy and even knew we liked to have a coffee service from our previous visit at the St. Martins Lane (partner hotel). Room awesome (522). Large room, again with cool modern furniture. Bathroom clean and crisp. 
Went to Mad Hatter afternoon tea... What an experience. True attention to detail. Lovely tea and snacks (from sandwiches, sweets, scones, to ice cream). Presentation fabulous.
Night time visited the hip Long bar. Drinks are pricey but again, true quality. Lots of well dressed people and bartenders who smile whilst making your favorite beverage (try the Old Havana).
Our compliments to th staff... Well done.",5,2016,04,30
132,chic Fabulous Hotel,"now where can I start this is a very cool and hip establishment . the Long Bar is a trendy spot and the Purple bar only open to guests is a nice Vibe .
The rooms are super chic open bathroom toilet is shielded by a floor to ceiling net draped white net which has a mood coloured light changing feature , Bed placed sku wiffed in the centre of the rooms full entertainment systems in every room well worth a stay .
At the top end price bracket but worth a treat every now and then ,",5,2016,04,28
132,Exquisite Mad Hatter Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon tea is a bit of a treat.  Going to The Sanderson for a Mad Hatters Tea was a treat with the proverbial cherry on top!

It started with a very warm welcome.  The 'event' was nicely explained - and provide with a glass of champagne for me and a cocktail for my wife - a very nice start.

You are given a set of teas to choose from and being a lover of tea (no milk, no sugar, just tea) it's lovely to have loose teas to select.  The savoury food comes along - all lovely - we were lulled into having a second round, but I would suggest limiting to only your favourite given the round that follows.

The tower of cakes that comes next is great - all fitting with the 'hatter' theme.  

The food is beautiful and fun - we really enjoyed it.  The service was top notch.  Loved it!",5,2016,04,23
132,Style at its finest!,"One of the best hotels in London.
Designed by Philippe Stark, it's unique style will just shock you.
Their internal garden, the pool table room (which is decorated like a church!) and their long bar, are an amazing combination if you want to impress someone!",5,2016,04,22
132,Lovely and Modern Stay in the Heart of London,"The location, look and feel of this hotel is what sells it. 

Located less than a five minute walk away from Oxford Circus (and Oxford Street) and lots of shopping, it's really ideal for a city break. The hotel is very modern, with lovely white white white rooms and modern furnishings. The lobby of the hotel is very cool, and theres a great bar downstairs which is quite popular. There's also an outside heated patio area where you can take tea or lunch. 

I had a loft room, which was a fantastic size, very spacious for a London hotel and had a nice balcony (however view was quite average). The bathroom was fabulous, and had a free standing bath tub, which I particularly look for when choosing where to stay. 

The staff were very friendly, and helpful when it came to suggestions on where to eat or how to get to places. 

The only 2 things that let the hotel down is the food, I thought the food was very average. The menu wasn't great, the breakfast was very poor and so was the room service. However, I am very picky and it should not deter you from staying here. Another issue, although they have a very unique (no walls, only curtains) spa and very kind staff, my spa experience was below average. Its definitely not worth getting a massage here, although I do recommend chilling out in one of their 'pods' in the spa. 

Overal, very good and very happy with the hotel.",5,2016,04,21
132,Great for business travelers and couples; can get noisy on weekend nights,"I stayed here for a week on a business trip. The location is great - close to Oxford Street and Regent St, so there are plenty of food and shopping around. The staff is very attentive. There were always people greeting guests at the front door - for my weeklong stay, I honestly can remember only opening the front door myself once, and the staff always help with luggages and bags and umbrellas.

The rooms are nice and modern, and of pretty good size. The bedding is heavenly; the only other hotels that I can remember having comparable quality linens and pillows is the Four Seasons. There are quite a few nice touches, like USB outlets for your gadgets and outlets that fits US plugs.

My only 2 gripes are related to lighting and noise. The elevators and hallways are dark - and I mean the kind of dark that you can barely read anything. I know they are going for the mood, but when I first got there and was trying to orient myself and find my room, having a little more light will be hugely useful. The other lighting issue is within the room. The bathroom is very romantically lit, and is great except for grooming. Putting makeup on is tough, and I guess the same goes for shaving. The full length mirror is on the side of the room furthest away from the overhead lights, so most of the time I only see a silhouette of myself.

My room is facing the courtyard, and especially on weekend nights, it can get pretty noisy. The head of the bed is placed right by the door, and I can hear people walking past my door. I am a good sleeper so it wasn't too big of a problem, other than feeling a loss of privacy as people's talking intruded my room. The nice bedding certainly helped. The room has space for the bed to go elsewhere, so I am not sure why it was arranged that way.

Overall good experience, but it can definitely use some improvements on the interior designs.",4,2016,04,20
132,perfect hotel and location,The Sanderson is the perfect place to stay especially for special occasions every detail is taken care of. We came to celebrate our anniversary and were looked after so well. All the staff went the extra mile to make our stay a memorable experience. We cant wait to come back. We even got upgraded which made our stay even more amazing.  Thank you to all the sanderson staff for looking after us so well.,5,2016,04,17
132,"Sophisticated, relaxed and atmospheric venue.   ","I had another couple of excellent nights here.
Love the atmosphere of bar and lobby area. 
Everyone very welcoming, esp front of house and guys on door.
Beds in particular are extremely comfortable and roomy.
Though I did find staying in the ""superior"" room this time, from usual, de Lux was disappointing in that I found very little difference from standard room to the supposedly ""superior"" one!
But look forward to returning once again to a great venue in superb location. 
Tip.. Be very careful of the extortionate pricing when taking any of the water from your mini bar.
Small bottles, but huge cost!!  ",4,2016,04,14
132,"Great for personal travel, not so much for business","This is a hip hotel in the Soho district of London. I believe it would be a great place to stay for a vacation, but personally it didn't work for me for business. I arrived in the evening and it was so dark in the lobby I couldn't even read the registration form I was signing. I believe they are going for the W style, which caters to a specific crowd who appreciates the dim lighting. The room was large and had good amenities, but the desk is small and round and not conducive to setting up a laptop and getting some work done. The bathroom was funky, but not functional. No place to hang a towel and little shelving in the showers. The storage is all open shelving with no cabinets so your clothes and other items are all in the open. In my opinion these little things are not great for the business traveler. However, I could see where I would really appreciate the space if traveling for leisure, and the location was very good. Bottom line, I will not return for my next business trip but would definitely consider the Sanderson Hotel if I were visiting on vacation.",4,2016,04,13
132,Perfect anniversary break,"Wow what a lovely stay..
We are loyal Morgan hotel group customers so a second visit to the Sanderson seemed a great idea for our third wedding anniversary. They didn't disappoint, from e-mailing Paris at guest relations to dealing with guiseppe at the front desk everyone went above & beyond.

They very kindly upgraded the room & placed petals on the bed- they also remembered to welcome us back to the hotel, a small but personal touch.

The rooms are whimsical & romantic but still have all the modern amenities including the softest linen & very comfy robes.

We are so pleased we were well looked after as it has made us more excited about upcoming trips to the Hudson in nyc & Delano in Miami which are sister hotels.

I only hope they look after us as well.

A few side notes, the breakfast is excellent, if you don't sleep well avoid rooms with a low number 205,201 etc as you will hear the lifts up & down.

",5,2016,04,11
132,Business or pleasure - this should definitely be our first choice!,"Normally I don't really recommend or endorse hotels etc.
In this case, however, I need to make an exception.

Words can liltterally not explain how great a stay I had with my wife at the Sanderson Hotel. 

Everything, as in everything, was flawless and gave us a truly unique hotel experience.
Yes the hotel and its facilities are in a great state and one of a kind. If you're looking for a non-traditional hotel in the London area. Here's your pick.

I my opinion though, what separates Sanderson from anything else I've experienced over the years (Encore, Vegas. The Standard, NY) etc. included) is the staff. From reception to cleaning to managers you can expect to meet people that literally live the brand and genuinely seem to love their jobs. This cannot help to affect your stay and lift it from good to great.

I will come back for business or pleasure. It's only a matter of when.

PS. I've not been paid to write this. They are just that good.",5,2016,04,11
132,BEST EVER!!,I went to the Sanderson Hotel and the experience was perfect. We went from Spain and the recepceptionist (Cristina) attended us really good. She was so lovely and cared about us a lot. She made our stay :D The room is amazing!!,5,2016,04,10
132,A mixed bag,"I booked the Nourish package for my daughter and I for one night. It wasn't cheap but sounded amazing.  There appeared to be some confusion over the actual cost as I received no less than five emails each with a different rate.

The staff were extremely friendly and professional and we received an upgrade on arrival which was a nice surprise. The room was beautiful but a big minus was the noise. We got around 4 hours broken sleep between 10pm and 8am.  Firstly a drunken row in the corridor then hearing every door open and slam and finally constant car horns, music and shouting outside. The building is in desperate need of sound insulation and decent triple glazing. This is a shame.

We were booked into the spa for hot stone massages and facials. This in fact was my last favourite part of the package. The massage was ok but I never felt fully relaxed, this was in part due to the masseuse not letting me know in advance that she was going to suddenly put cold water or cream on me during the facial. When you are in a relaxed state it is useful for them to tell you in advance if they are applying cold creams or water as I jumped each time it was done without warning. The products were very heavy on my face and I ended up removing it in the room as it started to irritate. 
On the other hand my daughter had an enjoyable Swedish massage and they took time to speak with her in advance as she has an auto immune illness and the hot stones would not have been good for her.  

We had dinner in the restaurant and the staff were extremely welcoming and professional. Dinner was very good although be warned, the restaurant is noisy with a bit of a nightclub feel being next to the Long Bar.  

The highlight for us was their fantastic breakfast the next morning.  A wide selection all well prepared. We thoroughly enjoyed it and I will be booking breakfast again soon. 

Hotel looks great, staff are efficient and friendly and good food. I just wish we had had a better sleep and I'm still not sure if I paid the right rate in the end!  I would say 3.5 rather than 3, so better than average.",3,2016,04,09
132,"Exceptional anniversary stay,- thanks to Giuseppe at front desk!","We stayed here for our 5th anniversary and were treated to some special extras by Giuseppe at the front desk to make this stay truly memorable. Sanderson is a truly great hotel experience , and different from other characterless big hotels. Recommend whole heartedly for business ans leisure",5,2016,04,09
132,Looking forward to coming back!,"I have been staying at this hotel for many years and cannot pay enough compliments to the staff, the hotel and location. Paris in the main office is fantastic to work with for my bookings. Behind the front desk on this  visit was the lovely Christina (Sophia Vegara.... As they call her) and Lindsey who are extraordinarily attentive to any need. At the front door is Hendrik and Phil.... Whom I cannot say enough nice things about. These guys can handle any situation from giving advice, lending a hand, luggage, taxis, suggestions for things to do, restaurants, etc... You name it. And they always have a smile to go with it... Extremely hardworking guys... Something to be admired. This used to be an Ian Schrager hotel and Phil was trained by the man himself. And my favorite part of the hotel... The Purple Bar (hotel guest only) where Karol and Marta reside. The ever attentive (and exquisite) Marta is always ensuring that drinks are never empty and guests (and regulars alike) are comfortable. And last but certainly not least is Karol. Of the many places I travel, he has to be one of the best, if not, the best bartender I have ever met. Quick to come up with a drink if you are not sure what you prefer (a true mixologist who loves what he does), and an excellent conversationalist with tons of energy. Terry, the night manager is always around for any late night requests and always has a smile, even in the wee hours. 
      These are some very hard working people in a very difficult industry. The Sanderson has done well because of their staff. The hotel itself is in one of the best locations in all of London. Just off Oxford St so as to avoid the crowds, yet centrally located. The beds and rooms are extremely comfortable. After a long week on the road in the UK for work, I very much look forward to my stay at the Sanderson. I'm fortunate enough to stay here often and would never stay anywhere else. The staff are truly good people.... I very much look forward to my next stay. Until then.... Stay well Sanderson and staff... Please do not change a thing... Staff included (that goes for the Purple Bar!)... ",5,2016,04,09
132,Really Nice,"A friend with a great deal of knowledge of London recommended the Sanderson for a business trip. Was impressed: very nice, clean, big room, great staff and great location. And I also think good value for a top hotel in London. Will definitely be back.",5,2016,04,08
132,Spectacular!,"Huge raves to Sanderson London - spectacular in every way! A perfect location walking distance to Soho, extremely spacious comfortable rooms and a lovely staff who went above and beyond to insure that all our needs were taken of. From the moment we arrived the service and attitude of all the employees [from those at the reception desk to the bell hops and waiters] enhanced our time in London. A big thank you to Diogo, the concierge, who took time advising my twelve year old son and I on the special details that made this trip so enjoyable despite diabolical weather. I will never stay anywhere else again!",5,2016,04,06
132,Weekend Break with My Husband,I have beeing staying at the sanderson for 5 years now it started once a year but now it is every 3 months. The service you get here is amazing My husband has an Illness and has to be careful what he eats. They make sure that everything they do is suitable for him. They remember you by first names which is lovley. Also reseve our table that we like sitting at without reminding them. The cleanless is out off this world.,5,2016,04,04
132,Best London hotel so far..,"Have stayed in many hotels in London.
The Sanderson is by far the bset value for money option.
Our stay was fabulous.
The roon is spacious and very nicely designed
Shower/bath are is awsomw :-)
Highly recommended
      ",5,2016,04,04
132,Really cool,"I spent a few days at Sanderson on Berners Street last month and I loved it. The first impression is a bit strange: big lobby, very modern decoration and design, not really the usual hotel lobby for sure. There is a huge bar which seems to be quite a happening place, especially on weekends. The rooms are spacious and well appointed, and also very original in the layout, and particularly the bathroom: glass panels and white curtains. 
The bed is very comfortable, and everything is easy to understand in the room. So after the initial surprise which lasts a few minutes, it feels like home.
The breakfast is very good and the staff efficient. Food is delicious and prices are reasonable. The concierge gave me excellent advices and this allowed me to discover places of London that I didn't know, out of the normal tourist circuit. Thanks to the housekeeping lady who provided super fast ironing service even if I was very late: well appreciated. A very good hotel that I would happily recommend. ",5,2016,04,04
132,"Fantastic, great staff and hotel","I do not normally write reviews but after staying at the Sanderson I felt it was only right to leave a fantastic review due to our experience. 
The hotel as a whole Rooms, bar, lounge and restaurant are all first class and could not fault a thing. The hotel is chic, classy and has a great atmosphere and you feel very safe.
The staff every one of them from the front doorman to the waitress are a joy and a credit to the hotel and Paris (front office) made our stay even better, thank you Paris.
Would i stay here again 100% yes.",5,2016,04,03
132,Favourite place in London ,"I frequently visit The Sanderson with friends for cocktails (which are amazing) and have never been disappointed! 

My boyfriend and I returned last night with some friends for dinner. We were blown away by the quality of the food given it was a deal through bookatable.com - it was only £28 each for a three course meal and a cocktail. The steak was absolutely delicious! 

The staff are all very friendly and the whole place in general has such a great atmosphere! Would highly recommend. ",5,2016,04,03
132,Excellent second stay!,"This was our second stay at the Sanderson and, if possible, our experience was even better than the last.

The gentleman at the front desk was very helpful and welcoming, the gentleman who brought our bags up to the room was so friendly, helped with the amenities in the room and even remembered where we were off to later on in the evening when we bumped into him again!

This was the first time we'd tried the breakfast which was in beautiful surroundings with the choice of a continental breakfast and hot dishes to choose from on the menu. Very tasty and fresh!

There seemed to have been a problem with our online payment for the room which didn't go through, so we went to reception, sorted it out very quickly and were given two free cocktail vouchers! These gestures and this attention to details goes a long way to making you feel like your custom is valued.

The service in this hotel is definitely the best i've experienced in a long time. Will definitely be visiting again soon!",5,2016,03,29
132,Great location,"This hotel is not just easy to get to from Paddington Station, but also a 5 or so minute walk to both Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Circus Tube Stations.

When you get to this nondescript building you feel as if you have entered the Mad Hatters Tea Party from Alice in Wonderland, and the service from all floor staff is fantastic.

I've stayed here three times now, and each time the rooms have been fantastically appointed, with modern everything, and what seems to be rare in London, a walk in shower! 

Also, two amazing bars right downstairs, The Long Bar, and The Purple Room, extensive wine and cocktail lists make it a great place to start (and finish) a night.",4,2016,03,29
132,Second visit ,"Stayed here for the first time back in November and was really pleased to find a good deal for my most recent visit. 

This hotel is ideally placed for the visiting tourist. The hotel is served by Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Circus tube stations. From City airport you can be in your room 40-50 minutes after touch down if you take the DLR and underground. 

We had a standard room which was very spacious. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was fantastic. 

This hotel is 5 star but is not the same type of hotel as say the Grosvenor or the Westbury. It's more modern and informal in my opinion and there is not always someone on the door to open it for you, if that sort of thing is important to you. 

The staff on the desk are also very helpful and accommodation. 

I'd stay again without question. 

",4,2016,03,29
132,Immense service and food ,"Just can't say enough about the service and food - brilliant. I had the salmon, followed by steak and coconut posset, I was blown away by the attentive service and ample and delicious meal. I had 'The Graduate' cocktail, recommend this one. I will be going back and would suggest to anyone to go along if you like good service and good food. ",5,2016,03,26
132,Amazing afternoon tea,"Took my Mum for a Mother's Day treat and we enjoyed the Mad Hatters Afternoon tea.
So much time and effort must of gone into the lunch, everything tasted amazing and the staff were so lovely.

Lovely hotel, great modern and plush welcome to the reception. Definitely on my list of places to stay in future!",5,2016,03,23
132,AGUA SPA - Best spa experience ever!!!!,"Came for a spa package last week and It was amazing. On check in I've met Daniel - what a great welcome, he explained my treatments by detail and I felt like a VIP. I had Elena for my treatments and she was really sweet and professional. I definitely recommend Agua Spa - Sanderson Hotel to everyone. On check out Daniel give me the spa card and some samples. They go extra mile to make everyone happy. 5*****",5,2016,03,23
132,"Amazing visit as ever, best hotel in London","Just returned from a weekend at the Sanderson celebrating a friends 40th birthday. Staff could not have done more for us. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left nothing was too much trouble. They made sure we where all treated like we where honorary guests. Paris (the Manager) as ever excelled herself and went out of her way to make the occasion extra special. From the reception staff, to the cocktails, to the food, this place is amazing. The rooms are absolutely beautiful and so comfortable, the beds are a dream (literally) to sleep in. To sum it up The Sanderson is luxurious, elegant, trendy, inviting, warm & has outstanding customer service. Would only every stay here on our visits to London…can't recommend highly enough! Thank you to all the staff ",5,2016,03,22
132,What a fabulous Hotel!!!!,We arrived for a one night stay in London and from the moment we arrived the staff were amazing! The hotel is beautifully presented and the room was of an excellent standard! We have stayed at other 5 star hotels in London but this hotel offers superior value but still providing a great experience. A special mention has to be made to the breakfast staff. They gave my wife and I a great start to our day and a fabulous breakfast!!! Thank you to all the staff at the hotel......you are doing a fantastic job. ,5,2016,03,21
132,Amazing!!!,"Me and my boyfriend came away for the weekend for our birthday - we couldn't have picked a better place to stay!

The hotel is just outstanding with staff being great. Bar area is brill,  lively and good service. This hotel is literally in the perfect location!

Cannot wait to visit again!!

",5,2016,03,20
132,A highly recommended stay ,"The hotel is very well located with excellent staff and very efficient front desk. Always good after a long haul flight.

The room is very clean which is important to me ,the room is a little small but perfect for my needs.

Breakfast is excellent (ask for Gaby) he is unbelievable and absolutely committed to service. it's not often one finds so much passion and I hope than the hotel management do recognize this. 

The rates are well worth it and take the all inclusive rate with breakfast.

Th jack king is a 9/10",5,2016,03,18
132,Amazing food and decor,"I was lucky enough to be invited to a business networking dinner in the lobby, we started in the ground floor purple quilted leather ceiling bar, the staff are great fun the champagne served in perfect glasses.

We move into the lobby for what I can only describe as a gastronomic delight, see photos each course bursting with freshness and flavour. I am not generally a puddings girl but the chocolate tea cup filled with the lightest mousse was sublime.

If you visit make sure you go out into the courtyard it is an unexpected delight I will be going back !",5,2016,03,18
132,Trendy and Chic hotel,"We visited the Sanderson Hotel on 12th March for my Sister's 40th birthday celebrations.  We were also visiting the Spa and had afternoon tea the following day so we decided to stay the night and enjoy the experience.

When we arrived, the doormen were extremely polite and friendly.  Check in was quick and easy although we could not check in until 3pm but were able to leave our suitcases while we went to the spa.

We had a 'loft room' which had 2 x double beds and could cater for 4 adults, this was perfect for us as we could all get ready together and enjoy the evening as a group rather than book 2 x rooms.

The room was very spacious and clean, the bathroom was also a great size and was all glass so you could see into the room (there do have curtains if you want some privacy).  The room also had a seating area with a table aswell as a sofa and an area to hang clothes.

The only negative comment I have is that the room was very dark, no natural lighting and very difficult for us girls to do our make up - the hotel in general was very dark but I think that is the theme.

Th following morning we asked the staff where to go for breakfast and they recommended a perfect little restautant just down the road.  

Overall we were really happy with the hotel and enjoyed our stay!",5,2016,03,17
132,Excellent service & amazing experience,"Bought my partner a birthday gift - Spa experience at Sanderson. We came on 15 March and I have to say we were so impressed with the whole experience: helpful and friendly Spa receptionist Daniel was really accomodating, I was taken to this amazing room where I could relax whilst waiting for my partner. My partner could not stop praising Matthew, best deep tissue massage he has ever had! Overall fantastic experience, highly recommended!",5,2016,03,16
132,Stunning!,"From the minute you walk through the door you are made to feel very welcome! We arrived very early (11.30 am)for a 2pm check in but our room was ready for us and wow what a room! Very modern, spacious and immaculately clean, and unlike previous reviews very very quiet- maybe we were just very lucky? Breakfast was exceptionally good and the Mad Hatters afternoon tea was wonderful. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend or to return.",5,2016,03,14
132,"A chic, cool design boutique hotel that is a 5 star illusion","Despite the excellent service, chic decor and comfy bedding and spacious rooms, this hotel has one major flaw - construction. The walls throughout the spacious rooms are paper thin! Unfortunately this is not the most restful place - you can hear the fountain outside in the courtyard due to the plate glass windows being too thin, people chatting in the next room, someone peeing in the toilet in the adjacent room! And even the housekeeping staff chatting in the hall in the morning. The food items are hugely overpriced. The dining area is outrageously priced. The exterior of the hotel is poorly unflattering in a retro look preserved that is disappointing. The good news: very nice decor, cool elevators, free internet, free business room access with computers to use, outstanding comfort to the bedding, very cool bathroom BUT if you are there with a partner - is not the most private. Sorry. Not sure I would recommend or stay again despite the outstanding staff who were always smiling, helpful and obliging.",3,2016,03,09
132,Trendy done right. Love The Sanderson!,Beautiful hotel and the décor is trendy done right ala Philippe Stark. A little pricey worth it as the location is great. I opted for one of the larger rooms and the bathroom alone was a work of art. Large soaking tub and a glass wall separated the sleeping area. Just beautiful.,5,2016,03,07
132,Fantastic contemporary hotel,"We stayed at the Sanderson to celebrate my husbands birthday.  From the moment of arrival the staff were professional, helpful and friendly.  Check in should have been at 3.00pm but our room was ready at 1.00pm, great as could settle in and then enjoy our day out.

The hotel is in a great location, near Oxford Circus.  We were able to walk to great restaurants nearby.

Cocktails were amazing in the Long bar in the hotel, great atmosphere unlike some 5 star hotels which can feel lacking in atmosphere.

Our room was a superior double, very contemporary with lovely King sleigh bed.

Breakfast offered an extensive choice of hot freshly prepared dishes cooked to order and also a continental selection of fresh fruits and pastries.  

Would definitely recommend and will return when staying in London.

Thank you to all the staff that made our stay a pleasure.",5,2016,03,07
132,Another great visit,"Stayed over Valentines weekend and once again the staff and service was second to none.  Everything about this hotel from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave is outstanding.  We have stayed in other London hotels but always get drawn back to the Sanderson due to its impeccable service.  Mikey in particular is a member of staff that went out of his way to provide a 5 star service without the pretentiousness.
A great hotel for fun and glamour.",5,2016,03,06
132,"unique but unpractical style, convenient location and friendly staff","great place close to lots of great shopping and dining. I keep going back even though the rooms are not practical to store your luggage so travel light. the bathroom lacks good lighting and plugs to either shave, dry your hair  or put on your make-up. Beware of the slippery bathroom floors, I have fallen twice. But it's a cool hangout, I like the bar and the courtyard. it's close to Charlotte street for more bar and restaurant options.",4,2016,03,05
132,Different hotel,"Crazy, funny, weird hotel with a great atmosphere. Enjoyed staying there. Nice rooms, quiet and comfortable. Gym above average. Will go there again. Very close to Oxford street and great dining opportunities closeby ",4,2016,03,05
132,Very cool hotel with excellent staff,"Great hotel in a central location. The outside doesn't look very appealing but the inside is great. From the lobby to the private bar with the Alice & Wonderland theme and little chairs! The rooms are typically on the small side as is the case in London. But they have everything you need.
The staff were incredible, in particular the front of house reception team. Extremely welcoming and helpful and fun!
I had room service and the food was also great, very prompt and very tasty.",5,2016,03,01
132,Perfect,"I'm not sure you can really fault this place. Firstly we went to ask them where to park and they did it for us, then finding somewhere to eat, and transport; they were amazing. Check-in was easy and the check-out was quick. The room was beautiful, with blackout blinds and you couldn't hear the noise from downstairs or outside. Loved the bathroom and its accessories. We also had a Spa Treatment, which was relaxing but also therapeutic with some aftercare tips for my ultra tight shoulders, the relaxation area after is lovely, a real treat. Sometimes really nice hotels can feel somewhat snobbish, but this wasn't one of them. Every staff member we spoke with was welcoming and friendly. If you want a special weekend or night with your partner I recommend this place. The staff will help you plan anything you need and are full of great ideas. ",5,2016,03,01
132,Two nights great sleep,"Great location, simple quality decor, rather minimalistic rooms, clean and quiet. Bed very comfy, standard of fittings unique (although found it hard to turn taps off if hands wet...) good amenities 
Breakfast a little too European for me, and pricey
All in all good place for business

Long bar is great for people watching and stuff too...",5,2016,02,27
132,Unbeatable London Hotel,"This is my favourite hotel and the one I measure all other hotels against. From start to finish our stay was impressive, luxurious and everything we wanted. My OH made contact with Paris before our stay and she was amazing to deal with, kept the surprises coming & so beautiful to meet in person. Thank you Paris and all staff they are what keeps us coming back. We had a deluxe king room with a free standing bath + shower and this room is so spacious and romantic a total winner. Room service breakfast was out of this world can recommend the peppermint tea and a full english. Cant wait to come back just WOW ",5,2016,02,27
132,A box with soul!,"We almost walked past the exterior as it is so dreary looking. However, we think this is part of the trick of this hotel, as the interior is completely opposite. The interior design of the hotel is fabulous, with even the elevator to our room a fantastic space trip.  We stayed in a standard room, but even this standard was anything but!
We enjoyed the mad hatters afternoon tea and tried a few special cocktails in the Purple bar.  However, we have to say that this hotel is definitely not design over substance as we can assure you the hotel staff bring soul to their interactions with you.  All staff we made contact with were engaging and made you feel that the hotel was just for you.",5,2016,02,27
132,First class,"Me and my Finances stayed at this hotel for 1 night for my birthday. Ive never stayed at a 5* hotel before and to my delight it was amazing! We arrived early to find out our room was already was available and we had had a room upgrade as it was a special occasion. My first impression was great we loved the space theme lifts, so original! The room its self couldn't be faulted, it was spacious, romantic with petals all over the bed and well equipped with everything you could ask for. 
Our evening plans were to go out for dinner so we decided to go to the purple bar before our dinner for cocktails. We were warmly welcomed by the host of the bar who had fantastic knowledge of the cocktails and some great recommendations of what to drink they were great!
After out meal we came back and went to the other bar which was nice we sat outside in the amazing courtyard which we loved.
I would like to thank all the staff for a great stay and i would definitely recommend this hotel if you want a great place to stay somewhere that is really quirky and that is so central.
Thanks again Sanderson!",5,2016,02,26
132,"Outstanding hotel, Amazing staff, Perfect Location!","Stayed here for one night as a birthday treat, on arrival was given a free room upgrade which was amazing! Cannot fault the staff who were extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel itself was exciting to walk around including the 3D space effect in the lift! Our room which was everything we wanted, spacious, romantic and for the location amazingly quiet! During our visit we visited both of the hotels bars, the purple bar we visited before dinner which was quiet as early evening but gave us the chance to talk to a member of the bar staff (blonde lady) who was extremely friendly, knowledgeable on drinks and gave us some great recommendations on the cocktails! After dinner we visited the long bar which had a very different feel to the purple bar which was less intimate and more social but had a great chance to watch the guys creating all the drinks! The location was perfect for us and we barely had to use the tube as it was so central! We will definitely be back, loved it so much! Thank you for making such a perfect experience!",5,2016,02,26
132,First class customer service,"I booked this hotel for 1 night as a birthday surprise for my daughter and her husband. They had the most amazing time thanks to the staff at this hotel to whom I am very grateful.  I had emailed Paris.barati at the hotel to advise that this was a surprise to celebrate and asked if they could help in any way to make the stay more special. 

In this day and age mostly you wouldn't even get a reply, so I really was pleasantly surprised to have a prompt response with an offer of help to make the birthday treat one to remember.

On Friday when they checked in, the staff were already aware of who they were and they had a lovely upgrade to one of the loft suites. They thought the room was gorgeous as were the other treats left for them when they returned from a theatre trip in the afternoon. The only negative comment they had on their return was that they didn't have enough time to take advantage of the spa - although they did manage a beautiful cocktail or two 😄

Thanks once again to all the staff at the Sanderson, especially Paris,  for all your help, it was sincerely appreciated and I will definitely be recommending you to any friends and family travelling to London.",5,2016,02,24
132,"Fantastic staff, great hotel brilliant location.","The location is perfect for shopping, eating and wandering around. Easy walking distant to Soho, theatres and great food.
The staff were extremely friendly, attentive and helpful. Even when I need to be a bit fussy and asked to move room, they were extremely accomadating.
The mad hatters afternoon tea was just fabulous, the long bar is a very cool bar to hang out and drink cocktails and the restaurant food was delicious especially the chicken broth soup.",5,2016,02,24
132,"Great hotel, at a great location","Spent a romantic weekend at the hotel. Everything about it was great...  The rooms are nice and roomey, the staff was nice and helpful, and breakfast was nice. Location, next to soho and covent garden, is unbeatable if you are a tourist. 
Has a great bar scene in the evening - was packed with smart dressed people every night that we stayed. For those who may be concerned, the bar doesn't have any ""spill"" effect on the rooms. ",5,2016,02,23
132,Perfect location! Impeccable style!,"My husband and I loved staying at the Sanderson. We really could not have found a better location! We were able to walk everywhere including many fabulous restaurants (everything from quick pop-in shops to top rated gourmet restaurants), the best shopping (anything from H&M/Zara to Louis Vuitton!), and great attractions and sightseeing. The Sanderson is tucked away on a quiet street (except for their own bar and restaurant, of course, which was quite lively!). It's a short block away from everything you need, including 3 tube stations.

We enjoyed having cocktails at the bar - they have a very unique, extensive specialty cocktail menu. Chips were delicious! 

Fast, free, easy wifi!

The room was great. I can't think of any complaints. If I absolutely had to be picky, I would have liked a set of drawers to properly unpack, but there were plenty of shelves so it wasn't an issue. The bed was comfortable and the room was incredibly spacious. Great view of the courtyard. I read reviews about the music and it was not an issue at all - and this was during fashion week! The bar played music until about midnight, but with the window closed I couldn't hear a thing. Didn't even end up using the earplugs I came prepared with :) The bathroom was very cool. I loved that there was actually counter space which is a rare find for mid priced hotel in London! Great lighting adjustable to set the mood or shine bright for a good make up application :) 

Room service was delicious and service was lovely.

Truly, no complaints! I wish we had stayed longer than 3 nights! We will definitely be back. It's a fun, chic hotel - I highly recommend!",5,2016,02,23
132,My favorite London hotel,"Excellent hotel, great cocktails, fab breakfast. This is my first ever review so I must have been impressed. I only stayed one night in the basic room which was far from basic. If you're looking for a trendy boutique hotel in London look no further. I will be back in March and I am looking forward to spending more than one night 10/10 : )",5,2016,02,21
132,Absolutely brilliant!!!,"State of the art Hotel which is in close proximity to Oxford Street!! 

Stayed for a coupled of nights with family and the staff were just amazing!! So generous; kind; loving and welcoming and really went the extra mile for us!! 

Would highly recommend to all- keep up the good work Paris & team!!!",5,2016,02,18
132,Excellent hotel….unique minimal style….superb location,The hotel is located 100 meters from Oxford str so it is very convenient as the tube is just 10 minutes on foot. The rooms and everything in the hotel is Philip Starck style. The breakfast is limited but with excellent quality ingredients and the personnel very professional. There is a very well equipped gym that has everything you need. Would love to return...,5,2016,02,17
132,Beautiful SPA,Sister hotel of the St Martins Hotel has been designed by Philippe Starck the famous French designer. Centrally located but in a quiet corner of the city. I would suggest to use the SPA with lovely treatments and products even if you are not staying at the Hotel. Restaurants are good but a bit expensive. Try the Purple Bar for a nice cocktail.,5,2016,02,16
132,Service impeccable,"People complain about the location ? Sorry we walked straight into Soho it is the beauty of not having to take a tube . Hotel staff if every area we visited were so friendly, helpful and genuinely nice . It was a real pleasure to stay. Our Superior room was lovely and our whole stay was a real treat .",5,2016,02,15
132,Superb hotel,"I spent five nights at the Sanderson last week,the hotel is well situated just off Oxford street, the front desk staff(Paris,Linxi,Cristina) are breath of fresh air compared to your usual ice cold London front desk staff, the rooms are spacious and excellent mini bar,with free wifi.The hotel is famous for its ""long bar"" which is definitely one of the trendiest bars in London for an after work cocktail,i spend 150+ nights a year in five star hotels and can see the Sanderson becoming a favourite,regards Oliver",5,2016,02,15
132,Perfect valentines ,"What can I say amazing choice and I will 100% return!
Was a valentines treat for the better half, I booked her the suite with the private terrace, but upon arrival we were upgraded to the penthouse! (Amazing)
We had Paris a young lady on the main desk dealing with us from the moment we booked to the day of our arrival and leaving. She was absolutely amazing and made us excited for our wonderful night ahead!
We also dinned in the restaurant, food amazing and staff greatly attentive very nice atmosphere plenty of time to talk and spend time together over some lovely food!
Of course it wouldn't of been complete with out a few extra drinks in the purple bar!
Book the hotel now, don't hesitate. You will not be disappointed!!",5,2016,02,15
132,Excellent as always,"I Stay at Sanderson on regular occasions and as of yet haven't been disappointed . All the staff are friendly and accommodating Nigel and José always deliver. 
The Long bar is one of the best hotel bars in London . 
Would thoroughly recommend the whole experience. ",5,2016,02,14
132,Anastasya the receptionist and the amazing service at sanderson,"So i booked a room there and as complementary they upgraded me to the loft - AMAZING ROOM !!!!
All was done with amazing understanding and top customer service !! Special thanks to Anastasia which was truly a blessing in this trip made it prefect!!! Thank you sanderson  for amazing time :)",5,2016,02,08
132,Style and comfort,"With its super modern interior design and highly professional staff, this is the place to be - if you can afford it. The hotel is frequented by celebrities, and the non-stop activity at the gorgeous bar and restaurant adds a never-ending vibrance and life to venue. Good Wifi throughout, and also a well-equipped business centre. At the cost of accommodation and meals though, it was surprising to not find complimentary coffee/tea in the rooms (one could request an in-room coffee station at an additional cost). We stayed for almost a week, and it soon felt like home. Recommended.",5,2016,02,06
132,Love love love it!!!,"I booked the Sanderson for a surprise for my husbands birthday weekend!! I had no doubt that it would be amazing as I have been to the Long Bar in the past! 
I exceeded ALL expectations!! The mood of the Sanderson is like no other hotel I have stayed in (I travel all over the world for work)! Everywhere you look there is something quirky, something kitch! The hotel is super sexy and uber cool!! 
We had a standard room and it was ok. On the small side and disappointed we didn't have a bath tub, but it was so quiet for central London, and sooooooo comfy!!! I can't remember the last time I slept so well in a hotel! 
The location of the hotel is first class and just a short taxi ride from Paddington! So convenient we hardly used the tubes at all as we shopped til we dropped!!
Before dinner Saturday night we went to the Long bar for cocktails! WOW! They were amazing!!! If we didn't have a reservation for dinner we would have stayed longer! The atmosphere was fab.
Staff were also good. Especially the young lady in front desk. 
I can't wait to go back to the Sanderson....make use of the Spa and the Mad Hatters Tea Party and of course the cocktails!! 
Would recommend the hotel I. A heartbeat! ",4,2016,02,05
132,all the staff all over the hotel,"i have stayed at the sanderson hotel many times an its never fails to disappoint me and my wife we stayed there on saturday 30th jan an from the moment we arrived you couldn't have asked for better hospitality

132,Home away from home,"Sanderson is a hotel that mixed the baroque and the modern in such a daring and imaginative fashion, that it creates an unforgettable, surreal and dynamic dreamscape.

I`ve visited this hotel many times, sometimes for just a few drinks at it`s amazing bars, sometimes to enjoy an afternoon tea with the mad hatters, stayed in it`s fantastic rooms on both business trips and leisure and to be honest I never thought about staying anywhere else when visiting London.

Upon arrival Phil and his team welcomes you with a warm and friendly smile instantly recognising returning guests, knowing all my preferences where I like my car to be parked, the type of drink I`d like after check in even where I`d like my luggage to be set up in the room. It`s just fantastic, from the minute I arrive.

The indoor/outdoor lobby is like the most magical stage settings, with Salvador Dali`s curvaceous red lips sofa. At the reception desk Dorota, Nigel, Kris and their team has everything ready in no time to check me into one of my favourite rooms. (there`s plenty of them) I just love the ""no walls"" design, the transparent bathroom allows for no separation between the room and the dressing room and I can design my own personal space by using or not using the electronically operated layers of drapes that open or close off the space.

At the concierge desk Henrik`s knowledge about the city, where, what and when is always up to date regardless if I`d like a fine dining restaurant or just a simple street food place.

A veritable symphony of purples, lavenders, and violets, Purple Bar is a chic, intimate lounge that is perfect setting for drinks and quiet conversation. And if I decide to go elsewhere in just a few short steps the Long Bar and it`s staff make sure I get into the best mood to party.

Also great and beautiful addition to Sanderson is the Pool Room, a perfect retreat from the busy lobby, it features an antique pool table covered in purple velvet, eclectic mixes of furniture and an entire wall that is made of stained glass, breath-taking and it connects to the best Spa in London, designed in the style of ancient Rome.

They say a boutique hotel has a certain life span because fashion changes, new hotels popping out like mushrooms around every corner, but Sanderson stays. It stays because it`s a trend setter, it`s original, it`s chic and unique and frankly the staff makes the place what it is, you take them away and you`d take the soul away from this amazing place. Keep up the amazing work guys.

What can I say it`s just good to be back every time, see you guys real soon!",5,2016,02,02
132,"Trendy, central and great rooms! ",Refreshing clean hotel with nicely sized rooms! They carry Malin and Goetz products which makes for nice showers. It's central in a trendy neighborhood and so for the staff has been amazing! Have been pleasantly surprised with nice size of rooms although no real views of anything. The fitness center is large so this is great for athletes. Fair amount of equipment and cardio machines to avoid London rain and cold! The spa is also very nice. Overall this is a great trendy spot! ,5,2016,02,02
132,FANTASTIC,"Originally booked a double deluxe, but got upgraded to a loft room. SUPERB !!!!!
It was my wife's birthday and on returning to our room after a night out, we were surprised to have a complimentary bottle of champagne.
ALL STAFF were very attentive and personable.
Will definitely return.",5,2016,02,01
132,Amazing Hotel,"Have been staying at Sanderson since it opened, it's become like a second home. The staff are great, and an evening at the Long Bar will be one of the best you can have. Was in the hotel last week when in the early hours an alarm started to go off in a nearby building. The noise was driving me mad so within just a few minutes the front desk at 3 o'clock in the morning had transferred me to another quieter room.
Professional, courteous, efficient, and pleasant!",5,2016,01,31
132,Another amazing experience,"Cannot rate this hotel any higher for the times we have stayed here. The staff are amazing and extremely friendly and helpful. 

The residents bar is private and funky and of course the long bar is vibrant and cool....

On top of this, the morning breakfast crushed avocado is delicious or maybe the steak. 

We will be staying again very soon bringing some friends. ",5,2016,01,30
132,Great great great!!!,"I love this place, a great place to have a great night, gentleman by the names of Nigel Gardiner, Wilfred and Thierry will always look after you to make sure you have an enjoyable stay or visit!
Great location, great cocktails and very helpful floor staff all add to the beautiful decor of the hotel and the bars inside it.
The bar is busy and full of beautiful people, and there is even a DJ on the weekends!

132,"Love, love, love!","I think this is our 6th or 7th time staying here! We stayed for my husbands 50th and booked a loft room with terrace. Previously we've always only booked a king sleigh room so this was a big step up in budget but to have the terrace to invite some friends for pre dinner drinks (a couple of them are smokers) made a big difference to the space - luckily it was a nice 12 degrees so we could use the outside area. My only tiny complaint is that we arrived just after 3pm and the room wasn't ready so we were told to have a drink in the bar as the lovely man on reception said 'they're doing something cool to your room'. I was quite impressed as I had not mentioned my husbands birthday! We went to the bar and ordered 2 cocktails, rhubarb and algarve, which tasted nothing of rhubarb, only lemon, so when the bill including service was £32+ we didn't leave the service as there was no rhubarb at all! And when we got to the room after 3:30pm there was nothing cool....but we did receive a fruit bowl a bit later saying thank you for returning! To be fair, I wasn't expecting anything for a birthday they knew nothing about! We both love this hotel and the whole ambience and vibe are well worth the money! 

Little tip - don't pay for parking at the hotel on a Saturday - we always have in the past overnight downstairs for £45 - we got a space outside at just after 3pm for less than £13 til 6:30pm, then free after that and on Sunday!",5,2016,01,28
132,"Quirky, Classy and a real Gem of a hotel!","The quirky lobby with its distinctive furnishings creates a real impression when walking in and it's easy to see why the long bar is popular for the late night evening crowd! Staff were incredibly attentive, really warm and welcoming - making me feel like a special guest. My room itself - which was a deluxe double was simply outstanding - fantastic design / spacious / superb facilities and with the little touches that you expect from deluxe hotels - but don't always get (fruit platter/personalised welcome card and welcome message on the TV). The food didn't disappoint either - we had lunch in the restaurant - great selection / well cooked and presented and generous portions and the afternoon tea was an absolute delight. If you go for nothing else - I would highly recommend calling in for some of the truly inspired tea selections and sweet and savoury bites - delicious and filling! And, if you are looking for a nightcap then the hidden bar (tucked away behind reception) is both glamorous and exclusive - it really does make you feel like you have entered a VIP haven. A definite must visit hotel - for a London property of this quality I would have expected a higher price tag. Exceptional value for money!",5,2016,01,28
132,"Truly amazing ,must stay hotel","Fantastic hotel ,well worth the money .location amazing right in the heart of London ,with a modern twist .
The staff were fantastic and the room to die for .we spent three nights in this luxurious hotel and will be back again .
Thank you to all the team .",5,2016,01,27
132,Purple Bar - Brilliant,"Spent 2 nights here in Jan for a work trip. Both nights me and my colleagues visited the Purple Bar to be met with karol, the head bartender. He created a fantastic environment, discussed the needs of each person and for me, created a fantastic perfect manhattan. Sanderson, you need to look after this man. He is a gem.",5,2016,01,27
132,Great to be back,"Stayed here with my wife on 22nd, a third time revisit.
Great helpful staff, lovely room and priced ok for the west end.
Only gripe would be having to ask house keepers for tea and coffee in our room.
We didn't book breakfast but decided to eat there. Value for money wasn't great if I'm honest. I think it could be better value.
Love the long bar and it's a great place to enjoy a drink before the night starts and as it ends.",5,2016,01,25
132,"Always good, even after all these years","Had too brief of a stay at the Sanderson recently (had to move to a different hotel for a business meeting) and was reminded how much I like the hotel.  Unlike other hotels that have been considered ""hip"" or examples of ""boutiques"", the Sanderson continues to maintain a high degree of service professionalism and dedication to its guests (rather than its own image).  One couldn't feel more welcomed here equally by all of the staff.  Hotel continues to be well maintained and has a great look and feel.  Rooms are larger than the usual London standard and extremely comfortable.  And the Malin Goetz products are a big plus.  While the London Edition (with it's great Berners Tavern) just down the street may have the latest buzz, the Sanderson has an equally great vibe + much bigger and comfortable rooms for the same price.  Can't wait to stay here again",4,2016,01,22
132,Stunning art-hotel to remember,"I LOVED this place. So much. I only managed to book here since it was a Top Secret hotel on lastminute.com, otherwise I would never splash out the cash required to stay here, nor do I necessarily think the rooms themselves warrant their usual price.

In any case, the whole place is a wonderland. The room was crisp, white, modern and yet very comfortable. I loved the glass bathroom - it felt like a treat having a shower!

I didn't get to sample any of the drinks at the bar since I'm not made of money, but would love to come back here and do it ""properly"".",4,2016,01,19
132,Not my first or my last visit to this SUPERB hotel,"I've stayed in plenty of hotels and this is one of the best, it is different and leftfield in a good way. Before we have even reached the superb rooms the lobby and lift blow you away, everyone is pleasant and helpful. we spent the evening at The Long Bar which is vibrant and awesome, the wonderful Alex looked after us with cocktails all evening. I will keep coming to this fantastic hotel. If anyone writes anything here less than 5 stars then trust me they must be dull...!!...Chris",5,2016,01,19
132,A weekend to remember! ,"18 of us spent the weekend here celebrating my hubby's birthday. The hotel took great care of us and we had a blast, nothing was too much trouble for them.  The birthday cake and champagne in the room was an unexpected surprise.  Our loft suite was fabulous and managed to fit us all in for champers after the purple bar closed on the Saturday night. The spend was worth every penny! ",5,2016,01,18
132,Excellent place to stay highly recommend it,Fantastic stay lovely hotel rooms are very well designed and thought out. The bed was probably the most comfortable bed I have slept in. The bar area had an excellent buzz with plenty of cocktails to choose from. Good location and we were able to walk to all the shops and loads of decent places to eat on the doorstep. ,5,2016,01,18
132,Great Hotel,This was not my first time staying at this hotel. I love the location. Rooms and nice and clean. They have a great bar. Very lively and still happening if I may say so. Makes it nice and convenient if you feel like spending evening at a hotel.,5,2016,01,16
132,Equally wonderful in winter as in summer,"We had the opportunity to return to Sanderson hotel just before Christmas for our annual Christmas jaunt in town. 
After having previously stayed in a stunning Garden Terrace Suite in the hight of summer I was apprehensive about how good it would be in the depths of winter...I shouldn't have been concerned, it was fabulous.
The Garden Terrace Suites were unavailable however we had a wonderful Deluxe Room with a view onto the courtyard garden. The room was large and as beautifully laid out and practical as the GTS we had stayed in previously. We also had a wonderfully indulgent bath (I am a shower person at home but for some reason in hotels I always take baths!) 
There was only one minor point I would like to highlight, with the view onto the courtyard garden you can hear the guests down below...but it really didn't bother us and I think everyone was inside (and quiet) by 10pm, if you are very sensitive to noise perhaps keep this in mind...although it did not bother us in the slightest.
The bar and terrace were as busy as they had been in the summer which was wonderful as you were always guaranteed a brilliant atmosphere. Staff were warm, chatty and welcoming which also added to the 'home away from home' feel.
Unfortunately we were unable to dine-in this time however we did enjoy two fabulous breakfasts which were real life savers after having attended a Christmas party on the Saturday night (and the breakfast waitress remembered us from our previous stay which must have been about 18months ago...very impressive!)
All in all a lovely stay and I look forward to the next opportunity to stay at the Sanderson again.",5,2016,01,10
132,Not worth the money ,"Stayed here on a Saturday & Sunday night and was left quite disappointed for the price! On arrival we felt like we were being judged for being young with the man behind the desk clearly not trusting us and that we could afford to stay! The rooms were ok but nothing amazing for what you're paying. Enjoyed having a few drinks at the long bar and the decor is really cool, breakfast was also beautiful and very well presented! Bar staff were very friendly but I can't say the same for the rest of the staff, all quite obnoxious. Very good location but definitely not worth the money spent for the weekend, would return for a few drinks but definitely not to stay! ",3,2016,01,08
132,Gabi the best breakfast starter. ,"Absolutely perfect hotel in a good location for most of those trips and experiences in London. Amazing staff that make the stay special. Will you get recommendations you should ask Kris or anybody in his team at the reception. Recommended great restaurants and helping to make reservations for these. The ultimate breakfast is to be served by Gabi, he makes the day starts in the best way.",5,2016,01,08
132,A magic new years eve!,"We arrived at the hotel for our meal, and were warmly received by the concierge. We then made our way into the restaurant and were received very professionally by the restaurant host ""Edward"". It was really nice to be able to pick the table we wanted to sit. Edward escorted us to our table and gave us a briefing of the two available menus for the evening. Our waitress was ""Gracia?"" Whom again made us feel really welcome and had always a smile on her face. The food and drinks were served with no delays and with excellent presentation. I would like to mention that our lobster starter was just amazing, and the beef main course was cooked to perfection. Well  done chefs! The prices were expected to the occasion. Once again We want to thank everyone at Sanderson's Hotel for making our New Years so memorable, especially to Mr Eduard for his exquisite service and Gracia for looking after us. We definitely will be back again.",5,2016,01,04
132,Nick - Porter service has been great,"Rooms are great, restaurant is good, and especially the help guy Nick is amazing. He is always there to help. I was bumped up to a bigger room, thanks to the hotel staff. The hotel is right in the center of the city and all famous places are near by location. I strongly recommend this hotel to all the readers visiting London.

Cheers,
Vishal",5,2016,01,04
132,"Never felt welcome, need to be over 21 (but not too old or that wouldn't be cool at Sanderson)","Booked Sanderson for 7 days over xmas due to its location but the whole set up lets the place down. Very friendly concierge but nothing else is welcoming. There is no functional lobby to sit and wait or greet people, just strange objects, but the biggest failing is the food and bar.
The 21 and over policy shocked me traveling with family aged 18-19. We were approached and monitored by hotel staff acting like night club bouncers the whole time, and unable to enjoy a celebratory glass of champagne for xmas without being relegated to the morgue like restaurant at the back -  I grew sick of having this conversation every time my adult son and I wanted eat together, the service in the courtyard terrible, the prices exorbitant. so I tried to minimise time at my own hotel. Thankfully there are a lot of other great places nearby where we did feel welcome who got our custom instead. The minimalist rooms grew tiresome though I contemplated buying my son a beer from the minibar and seeing if the ""age police"" turned up. Wifi was terrible unless you want to give Sanderson even more of your money just to get  a reasonable speed - the try hard attempt to claim it is  a place for creators and uber cool young things would surely need to be backed by proper wifi speeds. I wouldn't stay here again.",2,2016,01,02
132,NEW YEARS EVE DISSAPOINTMENT,"Firstly we have stayed here several times and visited just for drinks when in London and just loved the atmosphere and standards.  For that reason we decided to book a New Year's Eve package at an expensive rate...... It did however include acomplementary bottle of champagne, breakfast, dinner and entrance to the long bar for New Year's Eve. 
We had a few issues booking on the Internet and had to make a few calls to confirm the package. Arrival and booking in were great.  Room although stated as deluxe didn't appear any different to the cheaper room we had had before.  All good though.  
We had not been told what time dinner was a the time of booking but, on ringing a couple of days of days previous was told it was 6.30 pm but We managed in that conversation, with a lot of persuasion, to get it changed to seven. Hence we turned up at seven.  No one else was seated. We asked Edward (restaurant) if we could eat later but were told dinner on the later sitting at nine was an extra £30 each. We weren't happy with this and he went away to speak to the manager.... On return he said we could eat at 8.45 and not have to pay the extra.... We were still the  first to sit down.  Fixed menu was fine - mediocre in reality but well presented and a nice waiter. 
Upon returning  to the bar we were surprised to find it unusually quiet... Possibly something to do with the DJ  playing pre mixed CDs and ' pretending'  to mix tracks. Same DJ as usual  and same music with no new year atmosphere.. People were leaving the bar by 1145. We left with ten minutes to spare and went to The Edition just over the road where a New Years party, complete with party music and party  poppers etc was in full swing .. Brilliant ...  We returned an hour later to the long bar where nothing had changed, had a drink and went to bed. 
Thankfully got a late check out and had breakfast in the room. full English and toast with a pot of coffee and an extra charge for the fruit salad. Breakfast lukewarm and dry. 
Overall a DISSAPOINTMENT for the cost and possibly our last time at the hotel.  ",3,2016,01,02
132,Cool and quirky with friendly but slightly random service,"Stayed here for 1 night for our 25th wedding anniversary in late Dec15.  We had the ""true romance"" package with a deluxe room.  The website I booked on suggested this came with an upgrade but none was forthcoming - I see they now offer this subject to availability.  We also had to ask for the 4pm checkout which is part of the package - 12pm had been assumed.  We also had to phone twice for a pot of tea; the taxi we asked for hadn't been booked and we were pursued out of the restaurant by a waiter wanting a signature for our already included breakfast.
Service (with all these glitches) was unfailingly charming, but this is definitely not the smooth operation you get in, say, the Dorchester.
But then the Dorchester doesn't have a 30 foot long Chesterfield in its lobby, or a purple pool table in a stairwell with stained glass, or a glittery planetarium in the lifts.  All of these plus two trendy bars seem to attract quite a few passers by as well as hotel guests.  Quite a young crowd too - we (early 50s) were among the oldest.
Our room was very comfortable.  Rectangular, minimal decor, cupboards at floor level in office grey melamine and an alcove for coats.  An electrically operated curtain divided the bathroom (deep freestanding bath, excellent rain bar shower) from the room.  By swivelling the TV out from the pillar it was attached too we could watch it in the bath if we wanted.  And it had a big stock of up to date films at £10 each.
The room was dominated by a huge and very comfortable sleigh bed.  Probably 7 feet square.
We very much like the vibe of this quirky hotel, but if you're used to 5 star service think carefully about whether it's for you.",4,2015,12,31
132,Perfect location,"Went for some shopping and to celebrate my partners birthday. They asked at reception if there was any particular reason for our stay, and we told them why. Twenty minutes later and a knock at the door, we were being greeted with a bottle of champagne. A wonderful touch of class, that just added to our lovely little break. Thank you very much for this to everyone concerned it was a wonderful gesture, which made our stay even better. Thank you, and have a great New Year!!!!!",5,2015,12,30
132,Very noisy room - Average Hotel  Not a 5*,"My experience of staying in hotel was not great. I stayed here for 2 nights , my room was on a second floor Aircon ( feel like engine running next to bed ) was very noisy and broken around 1 am. Room was turned freezing cold when I called the front desk they sent the engineer to fix it which took 30 min to start warming up the room.. but the very noisy Aircon was still bothering the sleep so I have to ask them to switch off and provide me heater instead.. but soon I realized all the traffic noise coming into room which was earlier suppressed by Aircon noise ( I understand noisy Aircon for purpose there ;) ...  Whole night I was awake I called front desk to change room for next day which confirmed by person at desk..  After whole night drama had very little sleep (funny enough I woke by noise of passing by motor bike (fantastic morning alarm ).  Next morning I had early meeting so left for meeting early without doing breakfast ..    In evening after busy day when I returned I went to front desk asking for the room change , to my surprise front desk person told me ""there is no request for change of room"" , when I told person night shift confirmed for room change and  I not going to stay in room which so so noisy , he gave me other story "" there is no room free  , hotel is completely booked "" :(  after 30 min discussion he agreed to move my room to 4th floor and quieter side of hotel ...   Other then that hotel is average hotel (expect lifts , purple bar)  definitely not a 5 star , room are average  ...     ",2,2015,12,29
132,Great hotel great stay didn't want to leave!,"We stayed here from Boxing Day for 3 nights, we arrived and hotel very efficient at checking in, very adult feel though plenty of kids around so don't be put off if a family, the corridors are dark and it's a very atmospheric hotel. Location great for shopping we walked everywhere and only got in a taxi at night to go out. Hotel have a car that is very well priced to, gym well equipped and breakfast great.
This is not a fussy hotel just nice big rooms, they leave you to get on with it really but are there when you need something. I loved it, I will not be staying anywhere else in London i am a definite Sanderson fan great value to our package worked out about 250 a night with breakfast what more could you want! Go there it's all you want in London far better for shopping and nightlife than the other more traditional offerings due to its fitzrovia location.",5,2015,12,29
132,Family trip to London to see Santa,"Amazing hotel, fantastic service. The room was stunning.
Cannot wait to come back, without the kids!
The service was exceptional as soon as we arrived and continued until we left, nothing was too much trouble, we have stayed in numerous Morgans hotels, however the Sanderson is the best.
 
",5,2015,12,24
132,Great location but poor value,Location was great for shopping as its a 2 minute walk to Oxford Street and less than a 10 minute walk to Regent street. However even though we opted for a deluxe room there was nothing deluxe about it. No bath (which would have been very welcome after a hard days shopping) and very limited storage for our clothes. Disappointingly despite the high price for the room breakfast was not included. Staff were very polite and the hotel bars were very lively I would not stay here again as there are much better hotels for the same price. ,3,2015,12,24
132,bar over 21's,"Please be aware that if any of your party are 18-20 they will not be served alcohol as the bar policy is over 21. This policy  contradicts itself in that our group members who were not able to drink at the bar had their own rooms that were fully stocked with alcohol in the mini bar. The hotel needs to change its policy or make it abundantly clear on its website and the bar area. Children cannot go anywhere near the bar so dont think about having a drink while they have a coke, our two , one age 19 and the other 20 were not even allowed a glass of water without a struggle and a half hour meeting between the bar staff and bar manager. Change of policy needed to bring itself in line with the rest of London and have an over 18 policy.",3,2015,12,24
132,Top treats and great service,Once again The Sanderson scores a ten . Service doesn't come better in every department and the standards never slip . The mixologists mixings were a delight and the Mad Tea great fun as ever . Thank you .,5,2015,12,22
132,What a  great night!,"We decided to stay in Sanderson for first time on Fri, the 18! What a great experience.... From the begging until the end . Front desk staff were so lovely, easy check in and beautiful room! We stayed there as that was our little Christmas treat and even it was not special occasion we have really looked after! Thank you so much to Matt, who was very nice and to Paris ( Guest experience manager) who kindly put a bottle of red wine for us! We had few cocktails in the Long Bar! Great stay! We will be back!",5,2015,12,21
132,"Quirky, luxurious and perfect for a special occasion","We just stayed at the Sanderson for one night to celebrate my husband's birthday and the experience was amazing from check-in to check-out. The hotel is very unassuming from the outside, to the point where you might even walk past without knowing it...but once you step into the lobby you know you are somewhere special. With very unique and quirky furniture dotted about the lobby, it is a mish-mash of styles and design but it works perfectly. When checking in I just happened to mention that it was my husbands birthday and we were immediately upgraded to a larger room (very nice touch), and even the lifts up to the room were an experience. The room itself was a great size, with a giant bed, large tv and USB chargers as well as the standard plug sockets, which was very handy. The bathroom was large, and clean and lots of amenities provided in case you had forgotten anything. The slightly OCD person in me was a little uncomfortable with all the furniture being at funny angles...I kept wanting the straighten everything up! But it just added to the overall quirkiness of the room. The only thing I would have liked was a coffee machine in the room, but there was a notice saying that we could call to have something delivered to the room. Before we headed out for the evening we had a quick drink at the Long Bar and whilst it took a while to get served, it was the last Friday before Christmas so it was extremely busy, and the barmen were extremely apologetic for keeping us waiting and made up for it with the very tasty cocktails! Whilst we were only there for one night, it was exactly the 'special' experience I was hoping to give my husband for his birthday.",5,2015,12,21
132,Not what you'd expect from a 5 star........,"We came her in November for our anniversary and were disappointed from the start. Firstly the hotel really is nothing to look at from the outside, secondly there were no valet parking attendants waiting on arrival so we had to illegally park, take our bags inside ourselves and ask at the front desk to get somebody to park the car! Then came the very unhelpful man (tall with an american accent?) on the reception desk. Even though they knew it was a special occasion and we paid for an upgraded room etc the guy just didn't seem happy, interested, helpful or even congratulate us, which in my opinion as somebody who travels to 5 star hotels frequently is pretty standard behaviour! We were immediately put on a downer as this hotel isn't cheap, and felt a bit cheated. Really not a good first impression.

We walked through the hotel, got to our room which was fine however not worth the extra money. There are no tea and coffee facilities???? Again pretty basic stuff! So in the morning when we were gasping, we had to call room service and pay nearly £5 for a tiny cappuccino. Don't get me wrong.... we aren't tight at all, and we have stayed in some of the top hotels in the world, so i'm not picking on them here for no reason! These are just things normal people would expect from a 5 star! Moving on.......... there was only 1 of each product i.e shower gel, shampoo etc. How is it possible for two people to bath and shower the day you arrive and the day of departure with only one small tube between them of shower gel???? Not good.

The bar area was ok and the staff in the bar were really accommodating because we were hotel guests and it gets packed with people coming in off of the street. the cocktails are good but also expensive. 

The hotel has interesting items of random furniture everywhere which I guess gives it its character, however, all over the hotel there are areas for improvement. It seriously needs renovating as there are tiles coming off of the walls, dirty grout, chipped paint etc. It's just run down and has so much to do in order to compete with the other top London hotels where the service is on point, the hotel is clean, and you feel like you're getting value for your money.

If I could give some advice for anyone wanting to stay with the Morgan's group...... stay at The Mondrian!!! Exceptional service, great location and truly a 5 star experience.

Our final gripe came 4 days after we left the hotel when my partner was debited nearly £50 out of the blue without being told........ for the parking for one night under the hotel. Firstly, we were under the impression our room came with free valet parking for the evening due to the type of room we booked (obviously a misunderstanding due to wording on the website, which you should make clearer!), and secondly, why on EARTH were we not told this upon checkout???? that after all is what checkout is for no???? We called to complain but they were simply not interested.

We will not be returning.",3,2015,12,19
132,Always - and its always top service,"I have used Sanderson for business trips for the past three years.

They treat me like a ""friend"" and I'm always have a good experience.

Highly recommended for tourists and businessmen a like. My favorite London hotel by far.

132,An Amazing stay,"we stayed 4 days at the sanderson in December 2015 and we kept an amazing memory. The staff were so nice and helpful, the room bigger than expected for London standard, the amenities of an excellent quality. Not to forget the breakfast that is really of a good quality and choice.
Location is super central, by walk to most of the hip and trendy destination.
we will be back for sure next time in London.",5,2015,12,16
132,Fantastic!,"The entire experience at the Sanderson was fantastic. The rooms are spotlessly clean with fabulous beds and amazing showers. The spa is gorgeous. The food and drinks at the Long Bar and Suka were great and the Mad Hatter's Tea Party was super. Best of all though were the staff....Biken Urkiri is the most amazing concierge.....he was so helpful and his restaurants recommendations were excellent. Nothing was too much trouble and he was responsible for creating a wonderful experience for us at the hotel. Moreover, we had two young children in our group and the restaurant and door staff went out of their way to be fun and charming with the kids, again creating a lovely atmosphere during our stay. Would thoroughly recommend.",5,2015,12,16
132,30th birthday,"Best Hotel we have stayed at, staff went above and beyond. Fantastic food and drink. Will definitely stay again and maybe try the mad hatter tea party! Best night sleep in the centre of London. Full of Christmas spirit",5,2015,12,14
132,5th time here,Sanderson is still as good as ever.  Warmly welcomed by Paris after a harrowing long haul flight.  The front desk and concierge here are superb. I particularly appreciate the informal friendliness which makes the Sanderson a nice respite from tough business trips.   Breakfast is particularly good although a bit understaffed for those who can't have a leisurely breakfast. Otherwise top notch.,5,2015,12,12
132,Trendy but comfy hotel,"The Sanderson is a very trendy hotel but I was pleasantly surprised at the service and accommodations.  The staff is amazing!  They are so friendly, welcoming and on top of everything!  The lobby and rooms are super trendy and the hallways are dark.  The elevator is the cosmos!  However, the beds are great and the shower is wonderful! ( this is a big thing for me when traveling... I need good water pressure!). I will definitely be staying there on my next visit!",5,2015,12,12
132,best in London,"my preferred staying - good service and  kind staff  
Recommeded for a short or long staying for business of vacation as well - quite close to everything - Room are cleaned, confortable and large, the service is good. The bathroom are large and glamour.     ",5,2015,12,12
132,Agua Spa Custom Swedish Massage Treatment,"This was the best massage I've ever had. Despite it being an express 25 minute treatment, Julia, my masseuse, was so attentive and thorough that I felt as though it could have been an hour long treatment.

She was so warm, friendly and professional with a genuine caring nature - a credit to Agua Spa! 

Thank you for making my day Julia X",5,2015,12,09
132,Mehmet Bozkurt,"It was an excellent stay... I even used the spa and got brialliant service.. The staff was very kind and informally friendly, which made me feel very happy.. I would strongly recommend  to stay there. The location is just off- Oxford street, which is at the heart of London..
The hotel staff makes you feel very happy and could ask for anything to your room at any time of the night.. I am very satisfied with my stay.:))
",5,2015,12,08
132,Beautiful and simply perfect hotel,"The service was beyond excellent. The rooms are flawless, modern and clean. I also requested a lot of help from the concierge, Joey, who was professional and has great customer service skills. I had a photo framed and delivered the same day to the hotel and it was handed to me upon check-in. They remembered every single detail of my group's stay - there were 18 of us! 
Bravo, Sanderson! I will be staying here again. ",5,2015,12,07
132,Always a great stay,"A group of 10 of us stayed here, we had two double double rooms and a standard, I have to say I didn't expect the double double rooms to have such small beds, they really weren't big enough for two people.
We also had Mad Hatters afternoon tea which was great.
      ",5,2015,12,07
132,"Great hotel, greater staff","Very nice hotel mixing modern and classical concepts. Good breakfast. Very good location pretty close from restaurants, pubs...But the best of the hotel is the attention of the staff, specially Cristina (Spanish) who gave us all the attention we needed in a top professional way.",5,2015,12,06
132,A treat from entry to departure,"From the second we walked in to check-in until we departed, we felt welcome and spoiled. We loved our room, the service, the linen, the atmosphere.... As we say in Hawaii ""mahalo nui loa"" for an incredibly lovely experience!",5,2015,12,06
132,Fantastic weekend away,Phenomenal customer service here. The concierge was fantastic and even booked us in to a club after our meal. The restaurant was amazing and the food was to die for! Our room was pristine! Morning after; I didn't want what was offered on the menu but they catered for my requirements without a second thought. What more could you ask for in the heart of London. Was a lovely experience. ,5,2015,12,05
132,"Terrific service, nice property.","Although the lobby feels a bit late 90's with its red lipped couch and overly-scented space, the warm and generous service makes up for it.  I was jet-lagged, yet decided to wait a couple hours for a room I requested to be ready: a free upgrade from a queen to a king room with bathtub, facing the quieter street (versus the noisier courtyard).  As my stay was going to be 10 nights for business, I very much appreciated this response to my request.  I had a $7 cup of tea (oy!) in the restaurant and then strolled to the Adam & Eve pub around the corner for a perfect breakfast, while waiting.  Once the room was ready and I was actually checking in, the same, fabulous receptionist dude got me quickly squared away with my luggage, a package that was waiting for me, and arranged a coffee/tea service for my room, which I loved using every morning.  The food was really lacking, overall, so don't eat there (many options in the well-located Soho neighborhood),  but the cocktails at the hotel were delicious and service everywhere:  doormen, front desk, bar. . .warm and accommodating.  Good, fast wifi everywhere was helpful, too.  My room was quiet and very comfortable and well-appointed.  My colleagues mentioned that their queen rooms felt a bit tight, especially for room to work.   One day we used a meeting room for several hours and had lunch delivered there.  Again, the service was flawless.  I think it's great that a hotel will accommodate a request for a larger room if they have one available and that alone would have me returning to the Sanderson.",4,2015,12,02
132,Modern and fancy stay,"From the outside the hotel looks pretty standard, however very different story inside.

A great modern - somewhat a bit cold to my taste - layout with large rooms and really helpful staff.
I was pleased with the level of attention to details, for example when coming back after dinner I noticed the room was prepared for bed time with blinds down, candle lit and duvet partly folded. Also Wifi is working in the lift, small things but once again great attention to details.

Location is great on the back of Oxford Street, 10 min walk from Oxford Circus tube station - makes it an easy commute to Victoria Station and the airport.

Overall great place for business stay & leisure if you're into modern place and attention to details.
",5,2015,12,02
132,Quite a funky experience,"Great location, friendly staff, very cool 3D effect in the elevators :) 
Really enjoyed my stay. Only I issue I had was the noise from the street if you book in here ask for a room on the highest floor, I was on the second floor and was woken up quite a few times by the noise from the street below!",4,2015,12,01
132,fantastic staff and facilities! very central,"We were in London on business for almost a week and were lucky enough to stay at the Sanderson. The staff were exceptional: so friendly and helpful. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, we had a wonderful experience. CJ at the front door, Giuseppe at the front desk and a super friendly, helpful and kind young woman who was the hostess at the restaurant (I wish I knew her name) - all of these people stood out during our stay. Also the room was quiet, serene, and lovely to work in (good wifi) and we made use of the spa and gym, both were excellent. Honestly, I can't wait to go back. If you have the opportunity to stay I can't recommend it enough.",5,2015,11,30
132,"Great hotel, everytime !","We're coming to this hotel for 9 years now and they manage to keep it trendy, clean and still a place to be  Don't miss the coctail moment at the long bar. 
Congrats to the staff and management of Morgan hotels !",5,2015,11,30
132,Wonderful,"Just back from a lovely weekend at the Sanderson. On arrival were delighted to be upgraded to a loft suite which was beautiful. Every member of staff were so helpful and obliging,from the doormen to the bar staff,they couldnt do enough for you,shout out to the lovely Matt on reception. We are not used to such great service(and have been disappointed before when booking London hotels) we have now found the hotel we will be using every year for our trip to London. Everything in the hotel is stylish,location is great for shopping,Soho and shows. It isnt cheap but we found it was so worth paying extra for such a fantastic weekend stay and we look forward to our next visit. Jules&Dek McCammon",5,2015,11,30
132,Always amazing,"We have stayed more than 40 times at Sanderson and we love the hotel, the staff, the bar, the restaurant. Everything is amazing. We have never met such polite and serviceminded staff anywhere else in other hotels. The vibe in the Long Bar at night and especially in the weekends is fantastic but also the breakfast at Sanderson is to die for.",5,2015,11,30
132,Great choice,"Stayed here for one night with my daughter for a weekend shopping trip. Location is great, just off Oxford Street but also away from busy streets. Modern, busy, luxurious with large, well equipped rooms. Pleased to get an upgrade to a double twin despite being told non available booked. We did have an issue when bar staff said we couldn't drink at the long bar as my daughter is under 21 (19) but this was soon sorted when we said we were residents. Disappointed not to be allowed in the Purple Bar for same reason and this would probably mean we stay somewhere else next time. This would be a shame as love this hotel (stayed for business too), breakfast, service, rooms all excellent but access to the lovely bars is part of the attraction.",4,2015,11,28
132,Birthday fum,"Had the most fantastic time, hotel is amazing.

Do not hesitate book This hotel WE WILL BE BACK can't wait ,5,2015,11,26
132,Beautiful modern hotel but removed from heart of London,"The Sanderson is an upscale hotel with a very modern feel in its decor and setup.   The room was clean and big for a European hotel.   All of the decor was modern and fashionable and the service from the front desk and concierge was very good.    However, it is a 15-20 minute walk to the heart of London (Trafalgar/Leicester Square and Theater District) and the hotel rooms do not offer very nice views.    It is definitely designed more for couples and friends than families.",4,2015,11,24
132,Nice hotel but odd feel,"Firstly, location wise, it's around a 2 minute walk from Oxford Street. So if you want to be central, you can't get much better. When I was looking for the hotel on the street, it was clear that I had actually found it. Just lots of Windows with white curtains in them. It looked more like an office block than a hotel. I was greeted on the door by a pleasant friendly man. Inside, the hotel seemed to lack warmth and had a very modern feeling to the reception/bar area. I later found a secluded back bar and an area with a pool table. All of this was nice though. The only thing I didn't really like was the bedroom. Coming out of the lift, the corridors are all very dark. We found the room with a lit up sign in front of the door. There were no walls inside the room. Everything was partitioned off with curtains which I didn't really like too much. Other than that, the bed was comfortable and the shower decent. No tea/coffee making facilities unless you asked for them to be brought to the room. Breakfast was nice although there was limited choice.
As I said, location wise, it's perfect (a few minutes walk to Oxford Circus tube) but I'm not sure I'd stay again as I didn't really fall in love with it. ",4,2015,11,23
132,Excellent all-round experience!,"I stayed at this centrally-located hotel with another 3 ladies in the loft double double as part of a Hen Party. What impressed me the most was the wonderful customer service which began weeks before we stayed. They made anything we asked for possible, which included decorating the room with a bag of decorations we handed over at check-in, a free bottle of champagne with some chocolate dipped strawberries and an extremely late check-out! This impeccable service carried on throughout our stay right until the last moment where a member of the team literally ran down another street to find us a taxi. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a clean, modern, friendly and good value hotel in the centre of London!",5,2015,11,23
132,Modern 5 star,"My partner and I stayed here for 2 nights and we paid for breakfast too. 

We arrived early about 9am, and to our amazement, we were told our room was ready and we checked in. Also, we were told to help ourselves to breakfast which was an added bonus, and greatly appreciated. 

The rooms are different to any hotel I've stayed in before, glass walls with curtains for privacy. The shower was excellent and the bed was very comfortable. The room also had a very large flat screen TV. 

On the day we arrived, it was pouring with rain and my partner and I were both given complimentary umbrellas for the day to use, admittedly most 4-5 stars hotel do this, but it was nice to see them being proactive at the door with them. 

The location is about a 2 minute walk to Oxford street and about 5-10 minutes walk to Oxford Circus station. The hotel is ideally positioned for tourists. 

The breakfast was a-la-carte with a continental breakfast which was good value. 

If the deal was right, we'd stay here again. 
",5,2015,11,22
132,Great lunch,"Visited the Sanderson two weeks ago on a special offer for lunch, it was superb, food was fantastic, service was exceptional, we had a three course lunch with a cocktail with an extra bottle of wine! Please if you go shopping up west go for lunch or just visit for a drink a great place and very popular.",5,2015,11,16
132,Overall very good!,"Great central location for theatres and restaurants. Nice funky reception area and pleasant helpful staff. 

Breakfast in room really nice and good quality. Lovely bathroom and shower. 

Standard room quite small - only thing preventing a 5 star rating from me.",4,2015,11,16
132,Schrager got it right first time,"I know that Ian S has opened up under the Ritz Carlton banner almost across the street but this hotel still remains up there. I have stayed there for business and with the family ( my daughter loves exploring the  furniture in the lobby from the lips couch to the box she can climb into and return to the womb!!!) Great bar and really good stuff in the restaurant.

The staff are enthusiastic and friendly...that makes it a great place to return to!",5,2015,11,15
132,"Great Vibe, drinks and fun!","Love the Sanderson - this review is based on one of the private function areas and the bar as opposed to staying at the actual hotel/spa/restaurant 

There are many quirky design features that are great for a pic - the sofa, the lighting, the stairs, the lifts! 

The staff are friendly and the doormen are also super friendly! 

Been a few times and never left disappointed so would definitely recommend x",5,2015,11,14
132,Perfect business hotel,"Cool design, perfect breakfast, friendly team, incredible central location and resonable pricing. Great bar for after-work drink. This hotel is highly recommended for the business traveler who seeks for comfort, good service and main location.",5,2015,11,14
132,Great design hotel.,"I had a great stay in the Sanderson and I am one picky traveller with design/boutique hotels being an architect myself! Even though I am not a fan of the post-baroque design, I have to admit that the whole space functions pretty well and creates a cozy ambiance. I stayed in the Loft suite which was very spacious for London and all into details. The staff was great and the SPA was amazing, I recommend it to all the hotel customers. I am usually staying at the London Edition down the street but Sanderson convinced me to switch for my next London trip!
      ",5,2015,11,13
132,Trendy with a super friendly staff!,"I stay at the Sanderson approx every two months during work trips, and I love it. The rooms are big, the beds are super comfy, and the menu offered is healthy and delicious. But more than anything, the service and the staff here are extremely good in terms of speed, friendliness, and quality. Giuseppe and Gaby are genuinely wonderful to me every time I'm here. Thanks for being my London home, Sanderson!",4,2015,11,12
132,Only visited the spa which was beautiful!!,From the get go the gentleman to greet us was absolutely lovely and so friendly! The spa staff were very professional and polite and the spa was one like I'd never been to before. White drapes everywhere and such a relaxing calm atmosphere. I had a 25 minute back massage and I thought this would feel a little too less but it was absolutely perfect and the therapist was great. All staff were very attentive and a pleasure to be around. Definitely 5*. I wish I had booked The Sanderson for my stay instead of St Martins Lane which is a world away in terms of customer service!! ,5,2015,11,10
132,Perfect location!,"We had a wonderful time at the Sanderson Hotel.
Beautiful and very clean room, with shower and bath in the bathroom.
Perfect location and the staff was very friendly!
The only thing that was missing was a plug connection in the bathroom.

132,AMAZING Spa!!!,"My husband bought me a spa day and it was totally magical, incredibly relaxing and a complete break from daily life. From the moment I telephoned to book my day with Daniel (who was extremely helpful) I was made to feel like a VIP. My treatments with Elena and Julia were superb; Julia so skilled with reflexology and my facial was a dream, I almost melted off the massage couch with Elena's relaxing touch and the lovely smiling spa attendant made me feel very special and welcome. My husband was so pleased to see me that relaxed that he has promised to make it an annual present. The best spa by far I have ever been to!",5,2015,11,09
132,Trendy Young Hotel,"First of all I would like to Praise the service and fantastic customer service of one person in particular Miss Paris Barati who gave myself and my family possible the best welcome I have ever received from a hotel, if I owned a hotel or such business I would 100% head hunt this lady!

The hotel is not the normal Hotel I would visit as its young and trendy with unusual furniture in the reception, however I was taking my daughter and Son to London to celebrate there Birthdays. The staff in reception were quick attentive and professional and we were checked in very quickly, the room its self was very clean and comfortable, my only concern was that there are no doors to separate the Bedroom area from the Bathroom area, there are 2 curtain one which is see through and then a kind of black out curtain, I assume this is the same in all rooms as I had booked 3 rooms and they were all the same, I guess this is not to bad if you are just with your wife or girlfriend but imagine if you had booked a twin and were staying with a work mate on business, we ordered room service for my youngest son who is 5 and although there was nothing on the menu he would eat, room service were happy to accommodate and prepared him Chicken nuggets and chips, this arrived quickly and I again can not fault the service.
now onto the bits I did not like: the breakfast room was understaffed and the staff were clearly stressed and were bickering between themselves, we ordered our breakfast and waited an hour for it to arrive, having said this there were 8 of us so I can forgive them for this, the breakfast itself was good, we returned later in the afternoon for afternoon tea (Mad Hatter tea Party) we were booked for 3pm but because the party in front of us arrived late we in turn had to wait half hour before we could be seated, I was very disappointed with the service and the food for the afternoon tea, if you have experianced afternoon tea and the dorchestor or the ritz or any other top London hotel this will be a huge let down, it was slightly less cost than at for example the dorchestor but maybe only by £5 or so. to sum up if your looking for a trendy young hotel then give this a try but if your looking to eat in the hotel consider going somewhere else",3,2015,11,08
132,Fabulous experience,"I think i am lost for words - this hotel is a pearl in the middle of busy, dirty London. It was a haven away from the bustle and crazyness. Every turn had some hidden treasure in the hotel. It is worth going to Londn just for this hotel. The Director of Rooms, Neil, was an absolute star and made us feel like we were royalty. The staff was really friendly and helpful. What a great experience.

My partner descibed the bed as heaven and the room was super clean.

Breakfast was healthy and plentiful.

Thank you for a great stay.",5,2015,11,06
132,Great service!,"It was a great stay,it just seem's to get better and better with each visit😀staff are friendly and very helpful.

132,Amazing service! ,"I booked the double loft room for me and three friends, the room was huge! Beautiful bathroom and lovely products. The service was amazing - we checked in so quickly and our bags were in our room before we even got up there! Room service arrived so quickly and the staff really did everything they could to make our stay extra special. I would highly recommend a stay at the Sanderson, service and location can't be beaten! ",5,2015,11,04
132,Hip and fun but without the attitude,"Stayed at this hotel for 5 days. I have stayed at all the Morgan's hotels in NYC (past and present) and this place captures
The vibe. Super hip and funky but no attitude from the staff. Nice rooms and a good selection of bars and restaurants. 

Only one complaint....no outlets in the bathroom. 

",5,2015,11,02
132,Amazing design hotel,"Super helpful and nice staff, great luxury toiletries, very good gym. The beds are the highlight though, never slept so deep in a hotel bed. The Long Bar serves the most authentic cocktails ever, and the bartenders take their time to serve you properly.

I was crook due to a back injury and everyone went out of their way to ensure I was taken care of. Wonderful. Thanks all. ",5,2015,10,27

The bathroom was well appointed with bath and shower and great toiletries.  We were well looked after by Giuseppe during check in and check out and we were spoilt with a bottle of sparkly as we arrived back to our room after a wander around the shops.  The hotel is in a great location for the cafés, restaurants and bars in Soho and in easy walking distance of lots of galleries too.",5,2015,10,27

132,"Hip sceney hotel, yet comfortable and fun!","Recently stayed at Sanderson London Hotel. The hotel is beautifully designed in a modern style with some amazing pops of character. The billiards room has a beautiful wall of stained glass, the courtyard has a chic mid-century/regency vibe, and the general theme of the hotel is sort of baroque meets modernity (similar to most Morgans Group Hotels). Standard rooms are not huge, so try to get upgraded (or just pay for the more expensive room). Bathrooms in the rooms have glass walls, so there is not much privacy if you are sharing a room. The spa is available for use and there are spacious vanities and showers at your disposal so this makes for a nice place to get ready as it is very spacious. The hotel bars were vibrant every night starting at 5:00. You could easily enjoy a night at the hotel bar rather than go out if you wanted an easy night. The bar is active and people are well-dressed, yet not uptight or pretentious. Service was all very good, concierge was amazing and on top of every request - I would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,10,25
132,"Great location, modern hotel","Very modern hotel, nice to see a hotel do something different. Good service all around. Nice central location. The bar and restaurant seem to attract the local crowds. 

I started writing this review a month ago and it would have been 5 stars, but is now 3. About 5 days after I left the country, the hotel charged my Amex card $500+.  I still have no idea why (charge is being disputed by Amex).  It's quite alarming and  concerning that they still had my card on file and were able to charge it. I can't imagine I'm the only person this has happened to! If you stay at the Sanderson, be sure to check your credit card statement after you leave.",3,2015,10,23
132,Friendly Staff,"Initially we had been given a room upgrade deal, we felt this first room was in no way an upgrade. The staff were very apologetic and quick to move us to our initial room we had booked which was beautiful. The staff were very friendly, room service food was great - best burgers ever, we attended the afternoon tea and the long bar... Both excellent. Special mention to Jay Jay and Stefano who were very helpful and lovely!",5,2015,10,23

132,"Exceptional service, but noisy!","My husband and I stayed here while he was on a business trip for one week. Overall, the hotel was beautifully designed and the service was top notch.  I love the location, close enough to Soho, but not right in the middle of all of the heavy foot traffic. My favorite thing about this hotel was the service. I have stayed in many luxury hotels, but this is some of the best service I have had in a hotel ever. Housekeeping was exceptional and prompt. If I put the ""service requested"" sign on the door before going out for a 15 minute walk, when I returned the room was done. 

The downside was the noise. I realize we were staying in London and expected street noise and vibrance, but it was the hotel itself that was noisy. The restaurant/bar has events almost nightly and the courtyard, which our room was facing, was incredibly loud until 11 or midnight many nights of our stay. For that reason, I would probably find another hotel to stay in on our next trip to London, or at the very least find out if there are rooms that are far from the event noise.",4,2015,10,22

We stayed there for my husband's 40th - every which way we turned we were treated like royalty; we were upgraded, had complimentary late sunday check out and the hotel even put a bottle of champagne in our room with a message and cake. We were thoroughly pampered and couldn't fault the place. We were so lucky and will recommend this hotel in a heartbeat. ",5,2015,10,19
132,Surprising!! ,Surprising hotel... And definitely quirky. This is not your normal run of 5* hotels as it's stretches your imagination to work out how it got 5*. The first noticeable point was no offer to take bags to room. The lift is like the hoccopocuus house at Chessington. The designer rooms are well appointed with luxury bathrooms. No tea or coffee but room service and  interesting in-room amenities to buy. The long bar is the best part of this hotel with superb cocktails. Very busy bar....The purple bar (residents only) is suited to Alice in wonderland (it sells itself as this!!!). Glad I have experienced it but wouldn't come back to stay only to enjoy the cocktails!! ,3,2015,10,17

Check in/out was very easy and they accommodated an early check in request. All staff including the doormen and valet were super helpful and friendly. Restaurant food quality for breakfast, drinks and dessert were amazing and well-priced. The concierge was extremely informative and got us a DAY OF reservation for 5 people at the Pollen Street Social. This is pretty much unheard of, and we didn't realize until we dined there how special this was. We appreciated the concierge's time and attention to our business group. Thank you Sanderson hotel- I will recommend you to our corporate travel agency. ",5,2015,10,13
132,many stays at the Sanderson,"I have nothing but good things to say about Sanderson Hotel. I have stayed at other hotels in London, but continue to frequent the Sanderson (at least once/year for the last 12 years..more like twice/year). The hotel staff is extremely accommodating. I cannot say enough nice things about my favorite bartender in the Purple Bar, Karol. As a frequent traveler it is nice to walk into the hotel guest bar and for Karol to a have big smile on his face and come from behind the bar just to say hello on a first name basis. Aside from the extensive cocktails he makes, his knowledge behind the bar and professionalism (and now friendship) keep me coming back. Behind the front desk is Cristina (de Espana) and Jose (de Espana). Always cordial with a smile on their faces. Theirry, the night manager is always willing to chat and take care of any late night requests. The location cannot be beat. I have and will continue to return to the Sanderson.",5,2015,10,11
132,Contempary and Fresh,"From the moment you step into The Sanderson you can tell its the new school of 5* hotels. Its not the typical 'toffee nosed' place that is normally associated with London 5* hotels. It just feels nice.
The employees are a cut above the rest, they are extremely well mannered and trained.
The managers also have no arrogance and they deal with problems before the problem begins. How a hotel should be run. If there is a critisism its that the rooms do not contain a docking station which is pretty standard and the blinds on the windows are manual which again I found a bit strange.",4,2015,10,09
132,Very nice hotel very closed to Oxford street,"The hotel is very very nice.  This is a design hotel with fantastic and very clean rooms and a very nice and polite staff. I would like to underline especially Giuseppe at the reception who has been very very nice !!!

You are in the center of London and in a few minutes you reach Oxford Street and Regent street just walking.
Excellent room service and breakfast. 
For business is the top.
Amazing !",5,2015,10,08
132,Fantastic event space,I held two business events in the Boardroom at the Sanderson last week.  Everything went off without a hitch and the guests were very impressed. The employees at the Sanderson were nothing but extremely professional and accommodating. I'd book another event at the Sanderson without any hesitation.,5,2015,10,07
132,Great stay,Beautiful hotel with amazing service and staff. Spacious clean room with nice bathroom area. Staff were exceptional in both the bars and check in desk. Only disappointment was my door being banged at 4am by drunk rowdy guests coming from the bar down stairs. But overall amazing. ,4,2015,10,06
132,Great Stay as always,"The Sanderson Hotel is my favourite hotel in London. I would highly recommend to anyway for its uniqueness and style. I have been over 3 times now and will be going back very soon. The Spa is something special and would highly recommend for any couples!
      
      ",5,2015,10,05
132,Incredible service!!!,"I took my new fiance to The Sanderson London to celebrate our engagement by re-creating some of the best moments of our relationship from years go by - and we had a lovely stay there 6 years ago!

The hotel staff, Paris in particular, were incredibly helpful and went beyond my expectations to make our trip both romantic and memorable, even accommodating a couple of changes to date/time to make things easy for me.

I eventually booked onto their True Romance Package (being upgraded in the process for the special occasion) and we weren't disappointed: the room was beautiful, the service exquisite and they even had their chef prepare a dairy-free chocolate platter to cater for my partner's dietary needs.

I would recommend the hotel for this or any other reason without reservation and will almost certainly use it again when something over and above a run-of-the-mill hotel is required.

Highly recommended!!",5,2015,10,04
132,spacious rooms and great location,"Walking distance to Oxford Circus shopping mecca, beautiful rooms, great bar.  Really nice breakfast as well.  They have a hotel taxi on the ready to take you to dinner, which was a nice plus, especially on a rainy night.",5,2015,10,03
132,Wow!! ,"Amazing!! Can't describe how satisfied I'm 

We stayed there for 5 nights and everything was perfect!! Best bar in town!! 

Fancy, Funky & cool hotel!  

Great modern rooms! And they something call the ""perpul bar"" it's only the gust! 

Every night I have to pass by it before I get to my room! 

Great outdoor seating area m to enjoy the afternoon tea or cocktails! 

Amazing staff!

132,Hip Hotel with great bars,"The Sanderson is a real experience as well as a top modern hotel with great staff
The Long Bar and the smaller cocktail bar are excellent. We were told that the restaurant offering is to be changed and improved. This is long overdue although the current food offering is tasty and few seem to eat in the restaurant 
      
      
      ",5,2015,10,03
132,Great rooms and perfect location,"First time I've stayed here and wont be the last.
Rooms are great and spacious.
Staff are friendly and excellent.
Breakfast also superb.
Location ideal.
Bar is a good place to have a couple of drinks before heading out.
Gym is extremely well equipped

132,What is there not to like about the Sanderson,"We have stayed at the Sanderson a few times now and it is a superb hotel.  The Sanderson experience is without doubt something that seeps into the core of your most special memories.

To start with the entrance to the hotel oozes ""cool"".  The reception staff are incredibly professional but understand the importance of being approachable and friendly.  Nothing was too much trouble.

Our room was exceptionally clean and very well appointed.  I have to say that the lighting which is usually a major gripe in the majority of hotels was excellent.  The bed was more than comfortable and despite the fact that you are in the middle of London there was no noise or outside disturbance. 

We had pre dinner drinks in the Purple Cocktail Bar.  I must compliment the young lady who was our mixologist on Sunday evening.  What an asset to the company!  I am sorry that I dont know her name but she really was excellent.  We were completely impressed with her knowledge but most of all her approach to the customers was exemplary.  

All in all the Sanderson is a fantastic hotel, the staff are superb and it is a hotel that I would have no hesitation in recommending to anyone.",5,2015,09,29
132,Fabulous experience,"My husband and I were celebrating our 7th wedding anniversary.
We were warmly greeted by Giuseppe who was very approachable and friendly. He had a lovely cheeky smile.
We booked a superior room; it was spacious and airy. Clever use of floaty curtains and blinds at a touch of a button. The bed was large and very comfy, dressed with a quilt as light as a feather but warm and cosy. Lovely fluffy white towels and good quality toiletries. 
There was a knock at the door and a member of staff asked if we would like rose petals strewn over the bed!
Whilst we were out for the evening, a bottle of champagne was delivered to our room, together with a decoration of macaroons, chocolates and sliced fruit on a plate. A lovely touch with a hand written note from Paris, welcoming us and wishing us a happy anniversary. A wonderful and thoughtful touch. Thank you. 
Breakfast was available until 11.30am so we slowly wandered down and enjoyed deliciously yummy yoghurt with fresh fruits. We chose well from the hot menu, including excellent poached eggs. The continental buffet was abundant and included cold meats, cheeses, smoked salmon, croissants and homemade breads. My husband would have liked a stronger cappuccino but that's just a small point. The waitress who served us was super efficient and friendly. 
We didn't feel rushed and we checked out, again with Giuseppe. It felt like he knew us.
Overall, the whole experience was fantastic. The staff at the Sanderson make everything seem effortless. The level of customer service is extremely high and very much appreciated. 
Don't be fooled by this drab office-style exterior..........there's a gem inside.

",5,2015,09,28
132,"Hip, trendy and cool...even though I'm not","Overall I really enjoyed my stay at the Sanderson and will be definitely be back on my next trip to London.  The hotel is located in a pretty quiet street (nice) but central to all the restaurants on Charlotte St as well as the shopping on Oxford St.  There are two tube stations within a short walk - Goodge Street and Tottenham Ct Rd.

This property is very much like their sister property The Delano in South Beach - white drapes every where.  The standard king room was very comfortable, but not sure the king bed is really a full size king...more like a queen, but it's fine for one person.  The room is decked out in white sheer drapes which are also used to section off the bathroom from the main bedroom.  If you are looking for bathroom privacy, this does not really do the trick, but there is a separate toilet and shower each with a frosted glass door, but not a lot of sound barrier.  

The hotel has a beautiful garden area off the main lobby bar which severs drinks and has a limited but ample menu.  There is also a full service restaurant that is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The main lobby area has a collection of funky furniture and a huge couch in the shape of lips right when you walk in the door.  This made me smile every time I walked in the hotel.

There are room darkening shades in every room and they are truly room darkening.  Which comes in very handing when you arrive from an international flight and need a nap.  If you room isn't ready at check-in, they have a beautiful spa area (again, lots of billowing white sheer drapes) which create a maze of privacy.  They offer a private relaxation area which has room for a bit of luggage as well as a super comfy chair to relax in.  There are also shower and locker room facilities to use to freshen up.  Very nice touch instead of having to wait in the lobby of the hotel.

Overall a great experience and very nice hotel!",4,2015,09,28
132,My favourite hotel in London.,"Really love The Sanderson. It's my type of hotel. I've stayed at other hotels in the Morgan Group and they're all my kind of hotel. High end, luxury, trendy but without the poncy'ness of some high-end hotels.

Room was fantastic. Purple Bar is a favourite of mine too. My only criticism would be that they automatically add on a service charge, but when you get the bill, there's a space to leave another service charge. The price of the drinks are expensive enough, without the need for TWO service charges. 

Overall a great stay and I will always choose this hotel over others, especially when they do their deals and you get 33% off:-)

Went to Hakkasan for dinner, which topped it off nicely. 

Would highly recommend this hotel, but don't try to do it on a budget; spoil yourself and stay less often, but go all out...you'll really have a great time:)",5,2015,09,28
132,"Wonderful hotel, well located and with an amazing staff","From the beginning our stay was amazing , the staff is super friendly and helpfull (especially JJ , who attend us very well and gave excelent local tips).
Do not miss the breakfast, the eggs benedict are wonderful.
      
      ",5,2015,09,28
132,Loved it!,"Second time here and absolutely loved it. had the Mad Hatter's Tea and superior room inc breakfast. fab room, very quiet location, extremely comfy bed and excellent service all round. Only gripe was that when we asked housekeeping for a small bottle of still water, a small jug of warm skimmed milk and a couple of 'rich tea' biscuits at 6.30am Sunday, room service came up with a litre bottle of 'Belu' water and 4 luxurious cookies. Which was all very well but we only wanted to dunk them in tea and we were charged £10.35 for the prinilege. Ho hum, you live and learn i suppose.",4,2015,09,28
132,Amazing hotel unlike no other,"I really enjoyed my stay. The hotel us so funky from the crazy elevator to the great rooms. I will definitely be back.
Staff were all cool and attentive. I am not a formal person do the was great. Food excellent and prompt.
The best modern hotel I have visited in london. Don't judge this hotel by a boring exterior !!!",5,2015,09,27
132,Beautiful hotel - very unique!,"Throughout the hotel, you will be amazed at the little things they have on display which are so unique! The purple room with all the alcohol is certainly an experience! The food (breakfast) was out of this world, and the room itself was brilliant. Very expensive though (£250 a night) so if you can get it cheaper than this, then you got a good deal!",5,2015,09,26
132,Fantastic attention detail made my birthday weekend very special,"My husband booked the Sanderson to celebrate a big birthday with our two grown up children and from the time we checked in until we left I felt totally spoilt! The room was beautiful with a big bath, rose petals on the bed and tea lights all around. My daughter had told the Customer Experience Manager (called Paris) what a special weekend it was and she went out of her way to make it even more so with a bottle of wine to our room and making space for us for afternoon tea (definitely worth doing). thank you Paris so much for all the little touches and thank you to my family for choosing this hotel, I can't wait to come another time! It's expensive but in our opinion it's worth it for a special occasion.",5,2015,09,25
132,Just fabulous,"What a wonderful experience, from start to finish.  Great staff, the room was amazing (luxurious but different - stylish but not sparse), and the purple bar and pool room were a great addition to the Long Bar that we knew already.  It was our second anniversary and we were treated incredibly well, especially by the reservation and restaurant staff who catered for my wife, who is vegan, with care and aplomb.  Well done, Sanderson!  We'll be back.",5,2015,09,23
132,Another wonderful stay,"Much anticipated return for birthday celebration. On arrival, made to feel so welcome and booked in quickly.
Had excellent well-priced set lunch by Allan Pickett in Sanderson Suka restaurant
which included glass of wine.Ideal as we were going to a musical matinee which was within easy distance of hotel
Loved our room which was absolutely amazing: being a loft suite with terrace and is thoroughly recommended .Enjoyed champagne outside on our terrace looking over London roof tops .Comfy Loungers,very relaxing and fantastic start to our evening.
Good, fast breakfast with plenty of choice. Swift checkout.
As usual, all staff were friendly and efficient,making sure our stay was very special. 
.Looking forward to our next visit",5,2015,09,22
132,Location - Location,Hotel is very hip and in a very nice neighborhood with lots of little cafes around. Our room was spacious and clean. Shower has no curtain or door so the bathroom was flooded every time we took a shower. Bathroom amenities are provided from Marlin & Goetz. Staff is friendly. We tried the afternoon tea. I recommend to make a booking as it was very busy even though it was during the week. The afternoon tea was just ok. Looks all pretty and they fill up the sandwiches etc. if you like more. However I had better and in my opinion not worth the money but a nice experience. The best part of the Hotel is the location. Just a few steps from Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Tube station. I would stay here again as the Hotel is very modern and you can't beat the location.,4,2015,09,22
132,Only spent one night but would definitely go back,This place rocked. The location was fantastic and the staff could not have been better. They went out of their way to get our room ready when we showed up early and offered great suggestions for spending some time until it was. The room was spacious and super comfortable. Only downside was the hip little faucets were hard to turn on and off when your hands were wet. But that is a really minor quibble with an otherwise delightful stay.,5,2015,09,20
132,delightful city hotel,"From the outside this looks like a drab, typical unimaginative 60's building. Step inside into an alternate reality of high art and imagination. 
Consistently superb standard of rooms, service is top notch.
Self contained little oasis ideal for short stays in the centre of London.",4,2015,09,19
132,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed at the Sanderson for one night at the beginning of September. 
My husband, two young children and I had a loft double double room.

Our room was amazing, spacious, clean, tidy and modern. 
We had a double bed and our boys shared a double bed. 

The bath tub was a fantastic size.
The turn down service in the evening added that little special touch. 

Our boys absolutely loved the space themed lifts and the quirky style of the hotel. 

I must admit I was a little apprehensive about taking our children as they are quite young and thought the hotel might be more geared to couples but I was wrong. Even though this hotel has a lot going for it and perfect for couples, as a family we were made to feel more than welcome and they do provide facilities for children. 

Breakfast was high quality and the choice is excellent. 

Thank you so much to Paris Barati and Jon Dodd for organising our stay. The bottle of champagne and macaroons was a lovely touch. 

Location is perfect and the hotel is so easy to find. 

Our children haven't stopped talking about it and we really hope to return soon. 
",5,2015,09,16
132,"Quirky outside, beautiful inside","My first impression of the hotel wasn't great. Seemed very strange but the staff and the room changed my mind.

Check-in went extremely well and the elevators to the rooms are very close.

The room was clean and neat. There is only glass between the bedroom and the bathroom but there is a ""gold curtain"" that can be draw .

My only complaints are the wireless didn't work for me or others traveling with me and the mirror in the bathroom isn't behind the sink which makes shaving a challenge.

Besides those this is a great hotel!

132,Wonderful stay as usual ,"This would be my third stay at this wonderful, edgy hotel located at the center of London and I just love it ! The front office / check in staff are so welcoming , JJ and Linx were so friendly and professional when I arrived early morning, making sure to check me in immediately into the room  after my long flight and offered an upgrade for free . The linen in the room is excellent and the bed as good as my bed at home. Luxurious bathroom and quite fast free WiFi. I recommend this hotel . Feel at home

132,"Best hotel in the world for cocktails, service & fun times!","I have travelled the world extensively and the Sanderson London remains one of my favourite hotels in the world. The staff are always friendly and helpful. The atmosphere and vibe is that of an oasis in another world.  We visited for a surprise birthday for a best friend and the experience was faultless. J.J was extremely helpful with all of our needs upon check-in offering upgrade options and even sent a bottle of Champagne up for us to help celebrate in the evening. The wonderful concierge Bilken recommended the BEST place to eat that was totally suited to our taste and requirements. We enjoyed the signature Mad Hatters Tea party as well, and as usual the favourite part of our trip was our time in the Purple Bar with our favourite bartenders of all time, Karol, and the lovely Marta who gave us impeccable service. Karol is a one of kind mixologist with the presence and production of a magician. The whole experience was magical.  Definitely recommended for a special occasion or anytime for that matter! Thank you Sanderson London for a truly enjoyable experience and memories that will last forever. We will be back!",5,2015,09,14
132,Great Suites,The liveliness of the hotel lobby bar coupled with the new suites recently reveled make this a fantastic and trendy place to stay. The bar team works hard to really reinvent amazing cocktails and drive the amusement of the eclectic guests you will see here....,5,2015,09,13
132,Stylish hotel in a fantastic location,"A super, stylish hotel in the heart of London! Although this hotel is pricey it is close to great shops, restaurants and theatres. Staff are very professional and the breakfasts are lovely. Make sure you take plenty of cash as cocktails are expensive but quite addictive- especially the espresso martins! I would totally recommend this hotel.",4,2015,09,13
132,"Tredy, Hip, L.A. style in London.","This hotel has fantastic terrace and bar, its the place to be seen on certain nights.   The decor is a Phillip Stark mix, just a great place. Very well located just a block from Oxford street and 2 blocks from Soho. Very nice staff !",4,2015,09,12

Location is perfect, staff great, room lovely except the shower!!! the designer wants shooting!!! Great buzzing cocktail bar, a wee bit expensive, but if you can get it on a deal I would definitely recommend, so easy for the West End, Soho, and Chinatown in particular, the room may cost a bit but you will save in taxi journeys. Well done to the management and staff",5,2015,09,11

Once again, expectations exceeded, since the hotel's staff (from the doormen, reception, room-cleaners (never saw them but the room was always tidy!!)) were always polite and assisting. Beautiful rooms, with free wifi and complimentary newspaper (independent if am not mistaken), with a walking distance from all of the London's attractions. could not ask anything more!! Top class baby-sitting facilities.",5,2015,09,09
132,Birthday weekend away in London,"The staff are very friendly and professional. We were offered an upgrade and as we were away for both mine and my husbands birthday we thought "" why not""!!! Unfortunately I don't think it was worth the extra money.The room was ok, but not blown away. The long bar is lovely and the garden area, where afternoon tea seemed to be very popular. unfortunately we didn't get to try this as it was fully booked. The receptionist organised some Birthday Cake to be sent our room after check in which was a lovely touch. Service great.",4,2015,09,08
132,modern and chic hotel in great location,"Location wise this hotel is perfect for shopping and getting around London; its just off Oxford Street and a 5minute walk from Oxford Circus tube station. 
Very modern and plush inside the hotel - with plenty of seats in the lobby area. We arrived early and within 5 minutes had completed check in and left our bags as the room wasn't ready.The Purple cocktail lounge was brilliant and the waitress very knowledgeable and helpful in what to choose - although she couldn't tell us where to get the mini desk lights from (which was a nice touch and much needed). Even the lift interiors are ""out of this world"" and another quirky touch
All the staff that we spoke too were very welcoming and happy to answer our questions; from the check in staff through to the waitress and the door staff - couldn't fault anyone and the service was a very high standard.
The rooms are very modern in both layout and décor. The media hub was a good thing to find in the room and being able to connect our phones and stream our own music was a nice touch.
I'd definitely recommend this hotel, more for the location than anything else, but would gladly stay again.",5,2015,09,08
132,Wonderful experience,Stayed 5 nights and I would say it is one of the best London hotels that I have stayed. Very different from regular 5 star hotels. Staff very friendly. Gave me upgrade to deluxe room without even asking. Room was big and the bathroom was huge. Free wifi was quite fast. Each piece of furniture is unique. Continental breakfast was OK with limited choices. Mostly ate out so can't comment on food. The best thing is location. Just off Oxford street. 5 minutes walk from 3 tube stations. ...shoppers paradise. Will definitely recommend,5,2015,09,03

What an amazing time we had, this hotel is by far one off the best hotels we have stayed in for a long time.

This was the second time I have stayed at this hotel and I honestly cannot have better things to say about it.",5,2015,08,31
132,One of my favourite hotels ever !! ,Just got back from a stay for 3 nights .. I chose this due to staying at the Mondrian in LA a lot and liking the Morgan's hotel group hotels as you know what quality to expect which I think you need in a city like London.  I was nothing short of amazed by the hotel .. Could not fault anything at all beautiful atmosphere giant bed (think I booked early and got a superior room I struggle to understand all the double beds in London so was happy with the bed size being my bed partner smacked me in the head when we stayed at the mondrian london for a night as the bed was so small !! ) loved the evening turn down service with the candlelight at night .. Did not use the gym but the spa oh my god like walking into Alice In Wonderland in white. Whatever you do treat yourself to a massage to utilise this space.  Just book it if your budget allows can't see how you would find fault !! ,5,2015,08,30
132,helpful front deskj,"Wonderful hotel with great  ambience!  The front desk, especially Giussepe, is very accommodating and my husband and I were most pleased!  The room are great, the bar spectacular and the breakfast (included) is terrific!",5,2015,08,25
132,Absolutely superb!,"We stayed at the Sanderson a couple of times over the Summer and made me wonder why I ever chose to stay anywhere else! 

The staff are incredibly welcoming, always looking to go the extra mile for you. When we were checking-in, the front desk clocked the couple behind discussing where to go for dinner so they checked the opening hours for them without any prompting. Just little details like that which add to the warmth of the hotel.

Decor is top-notch - from the bars through to the lifts! Great cocktails here and the food is sensational as well.

Location is perfect. Just a couple minutes walk from Oxford Circus is probably the easiest way to describe how accessible the hotel is. 

I've previously stayed in hotels like The Mayfair / Langham / even Claridges but for me Sanderson has the perfect mix of fun nightlife and luxery with no compromises. I've booked to stay again next month with a friend and quite looking forward to showing it off!",5,2015,08,25
132,PLEASANT STAY!,"We had such an amazing stay at the SANDERSON in August 2015.

We would definitely go back.

We were able to walk to the theatre, to soho for dinner and then walk back to hotel - so great location.  Loved the funky interior, staff were lovely, room was great, had a wonderful breakfast in the morning. Very good price (can I say I booked via lastminiute.com?)  We will be back for our next weekend in London.  Hubby has to have complete silence and darkness for sleeping - ticked all those boxes.",5,2015,08,24
132,Exceeding expectations ,"Visited the Sanderson with my wife and 18 and 21 year old daughters for 3 nights. From the moment we walked in everyone was very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. 

One of the highlights of our stay was breakfast every morning, our waiter, Gaby, was very friendly and attentive. The food was outstanding, cooked by Gregory and Michaal, the breakfast chefs. 
 
On our next visit we will be sure to book the Sanderson as it is exactly what you are looking for in a hotel for a city break in terms of location and comfort.

Overall, a great London experience. ",5,2015,08,24

132,Attentive Staff and Excellent Service,"I have stayed here several times and each time I've been treated very well.  I travel to London for work and usually stay in the area around Soho Square.  I have stayed both here and at Charlotte Street a couple blocks over, and although aesthetically I find Charlotte Street to be a bit more charming, the level of service I've experienced at Sanderson completely out-classes it.  The lobby is a bit ridiculous and the bar and courtyard become a bit of a scene at night, but I always request a quieter room facing the street and they've always been able to accommodate that for me, in addition to usually providing a complimentary amenity or two.  The beds are quite comfortable and the turn-down service is well done (I usually hang the ""DND"" sign out and refuse turn-down at other places but I always get it here).",5,2015,08,22
132,Agua Spa... What a treat! ,"I am writing this review while enjoying the Jasimne tea a member of staff so kindly offered me ( I didn't even ask but I'm so loving it...) 

I'm not the kind of girl who visits the spa on a regular basis but I'm afraid that may have just changed forever! 

I've been wanting a facial for ages and procrastinated until today. They say all good things come to those who wait... Perhaps they're right. 

Booking was easy and quick. Marta greeted me on arrival and was very friendly and professional. My therapist, Elena was so amazing and put me at ease with her calm and professional manner. The spa is a quiet zone and I just loved that because I work in an environment where talking never stops ( in a good way) so it was such a sweet escape. The treatment itself was beautiful and I can't wait to wake up tomorrow morning and see the real difference. 

I'm on my own today but if I had a friend with me, we would certainly end up in long bar. Maybe next time...

Thank you and I'll be back! ",5,2015,08,20
132,fantastic stay,"great location close to all the attractions, staff were very helpful and were at hand when ever we needed them and the hotel is stunning. would stay there again in preference to any other London five star. 
      
      
      ",5,2015,08,20
132,Amazing,"This place doesn't get enough credit in trip advisor rankings. Never mind Hotel Cafe Royal and all the others trying to be number one. This is a hidden gem that is so perfect. You wouldn't believe it. 

Also the spa is in my opinion the best in London. 

Stayed twice now and will be staying again next time I'm in London",5,2015,08,19
132,Special Evening,"Trust The Sanderson to make a celebration special......
The delightful setting, attentive but unobtrusive service, fine dining, perfectly paired wines, the little special details the events team thought of: these all elevated our event to ""unforgettable"" status.
Chef Matthew, Paris, Indre, the whole team: thank you!",5,2015,08,19
132,Favorite Hotel,"Something about the Sanderson was quirky, yet also cozy. The white rooms had a crisp clean feel. I loved the long bar and we spent a couple nights sitting there trying its fun libations. The Alice in Wonderland Afternoon Tea was so much fun, with different flavored and black teas to choose from, any little (or big) girl would love getting dressed up for this fun mad hatter experience. The Sanderson is the only hotel I will stay in when travelling to London.",5,2015,08,18
132,Nike Global Wholesale.com off-site,"Great team, very polite and helpful.
Very warm welcome and AWESOME cocktails made by Miss Marta and ""master magician"" Mr.Carl. :-)
Thanks for a very successful event guys!
We would very much recommend this hotel to others.",5,2015,08,18
132,Fabulous modern decor,"We went for cocktails. They were expensive, but there was a good choice, great service and the interior and atmosphere felt special. Great for a treat.The modern interior is stunning! It is worth knowing this place as from the outside you would not necessarily be drawn into such a fabulous bar.",4,2015,08,18
132,Sofisticated,"Modern, Clean, Wonderful Service. Amazing Bar, Peolple are very professional and kind.  The place to stay in London. An inspire decoration.
The perfect hotel for couples, and business people. But also available for family.

132,Unusual hotel in a great location,"We stayed at the Sanderson Hotel having recently stayed at the Modrian which is part of the Morgan Hotel Group.  The location is super - right next to the shops of Oxford Street and close to Soho, pubs, restaurants, bars, etc. The decor is very light and airy with many modern and unusual furnishings and touches - think silky curtain walls, lots of odd designer chairs and seating, all very white and minimalist.  The room was a decent size and the bathroom was modern and clean.  It all felt a little ""cold"" but we were very happy and like that look.  Things are a little rough around the edges (feels like it could do with a freshen up) but the quality is good and we were happy with all the amenities.  Staff were very friendly and welcoming.  The breakfast was excellent - fresh and luxury produce and a nice setting next to a courtyard with water fountain etc.  The hotel gym is also very good - so much better than many 4 and 5-star hotels.  Overall a very pleasant stay and, with the offer we got, very good value for money.",4,2015,08,17
132,Stunning,Stunning hotel!!!!! Walked into this massive reception which was really modern and different to other hotels I have been to. Our room was beautiful with lovely lighting and drapes and all open plan. This hotel is a must to go to.,5,2015,08,17
132,Unique ,"If you are looking for something special, this is it. Unique decor, friendly staff and great location. Long bar very lively at weekend, alternative lounge bar comfortable with excellent selection of cocktails and great service.Standard room perfectly ok for one night stay but ask for a quiet room when you check in so you can get away from the party at the end of the evening.",5,2015,08,16
132,Disability test,Very young and polite staff that made our stay very enjoyable. Visited with disabled mother-in-law that tested the facilities for disabled access. Passed! Very big plus point for me was to have an underground car park; most unusual for London - just think could take mother-in-law direct from the car park to the room! Great. Slight downside was step access to courtyard but hotel has use of a portable ramp.,5,2015,08,16
132,A wonderful experience,"I have stayed at The Sanderson before and this was a birthday treat for my mum.  Paris arranged our visit and we were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived.  Honestly, the customer service is the best I've ever experienced.  The staff go out of their way to help in anyway: nothing is too much trouble and everything we could wish for was provided.  Special mention must go to Indre, Larissa and Ricardo in the restaurant who looked after is so well.  However, all the staff were so friendly and helpful it was a pleasure to stay there.  As for the hotel itself, the rooms are spotlessly clean and spacious.  The furnishings are attractive and comfortable and the food delicious.  Both my mum and I are vegetarian but there were plenty of options for us.  The hotel is extremely well located, being just off Oxford Street It is easily reached by public transport and is within walking distance of the West End theatres, shops and London attractions.  I can highly recommend a visit to The Sanderson.",5,2015,08,13
132,"Beautiful place, Fabulous service","I attended the Magic Mike XXL premiere on the 30th June, as I had tickets to go on the red carpet I decided to book into a beautiful hotel fit for a celebrity and I was not at all disappointed.

When pulling up to the hotel I wasn't sure if there would be a designated area to pull my car in to as I was aware it had valet parking, this was slightly confusing but there was a lovely gentleman on hand straight away to ask if I wanted him to park my car and put my luggage onto the porter trolley. 

The first thing I noticed when walking in to the hotel was the very fresh floral smell which was present through-out the hotel the whole time. During check in we were given a free upgrade and the staff were fabulously polite and upbeat. As we had arrived a little early our room was not ready but the staff quickly jumped on to arranging the room after realising what we were there for. Free bottled water is available throughout the stay.

We were shown to our room The lift is very unique with a space / universe design inside. There are quirky little things that I noticed throughout. The hallways are really quite dark but it makes it seem like a little adventure. When getting to our room we were absolutely delighted by the open design which could be privatised when needed. The porter delivered our luggage to the room which was helpful as we were rather well equipped for a one night stay. They also delivered a bucket of ice to the room and were extermely accommodating to every request. 
We had external people come to the hotel to do our hair and make up and previously hotels have wanted to charge extra for this but at the Sanderson, nothing was impossible for us I honestly cannot express enough how fabulous the service was. I ordered room service for dinner, the chicken with jasmine rice and broccoli was delicious! I certainly recommend it. Snacks from the mini bar were expensive for what they are but the prices are not out of line with any other hotel offering. The reception staff booked us a private mercedes to take us to the premier (we were expecting and had only asked for a standard London cab so again this was a bonus) The bed was extremely comfortable, the room was rather warm during the night but I slept straight through comfortably with no noise or disturbance at all. 

The check out process was a little long as we were in a rush to get away due to home commitments however they still rushed along to help us out. 

Overall.. I loved my stay here and I would certainly stay again!!",5,2015,08,12
132,Mrs Merilee weitzman,"My husband and I stayed at the Sanderson hotel in London for 4 nights at the end of 2 week Europeean holiday. From the moment we walked in, we were treated superbly by all staff that we came in contact with. Everything that we requested was immediately taken care of. A complimentary bottle of champagne was sent to our room as well as a room upgrade!  The only negative is that if you are there over a weekend, things get pretty noisy at the bar.  Request an outside facing room. 
Breakfast was delicious and made to order, besides the buffet. breakfast manager was polite, efficient and utterly professional. 
The whole team at the Sanderson is one of the best that I have encountered!
In particular, I would like to thank Guiseppe, Jonathan, JJ and Philip.
Well done!",5,2015,08,11
132,A wonderful Hotel,"Wow what a wonderful experience we had when we stayed at Sandersons. The service was excellent we were upgraded and the champagne and cake was a lovely touch it made our stay very special. Room immaculate, bed was so comfortable and breakfast yummy.

132,Agua Spa,"I took a friend to Agua on Saturday for some well deserved relaxation and pampering.
The hotel outside is quite bland but the doorman and receptionists were very friendly and once inside we took a very ornate lift to the spa on the first floor. 
Here, we felt we had entered another world! The spa receptionist was very welcoming and the hushed tones and attentive staff really relaxed us.
Having completed a short questionnaire we were shown around and everything explained.
We chose to use the steam room, then after a lovely shower waited in a private ""room"" (no walls, simply beautiful full length white curtains dividing the area). We relaxed on the most comfortable bed/chairs until our thereapists collected us.
We each had a full body aromatherapy massage then my friend had a manicure whilst I had a head massage.
Each of our therapists did both our treatments which was wonderful. My therapist Julia, asked if my feet were sensitive and did I have any concerns or questions. She was reassuring, friendly and professional. She used lovely scented oils, applied just the right amount of pressure and relaxed me more than I would ever have thought possible. Once my treatments were complete, she gave me some water, escorted me to our ""room"" and offered me jasmine tea. Another therapist then brought me tea and I awaited my friend. We were both so relaxed we simply lay back each with our own thoughts and didn;t even converse!
Having washed my hair (didn't want to shower off the lovely oils) I enjoyed using the comfortable changing area before leaving this heavenly dream of a place.
We both agreed that if we could afford it, we would definitely come on a regular basis.
I cannot praise the staff enough for making our afternoon so special and would like to again thank Julia for giving me an afternoon to remember and cherrish.",5,2015,08,10
132,Wonderful experience,"Stayed for my wedding anniversary and loved the room and service on checking in. There was a welcome platar with chocolate writing of ""happy anniversary"" on it and rose petals all over the HUGE bed!!! The action was well though and really made the day special. Will definitely stay again and would recommend Sanderson to anyone i know who wants to have a WOW experience.   ",4,2015,08,10
132,Lovely & Luxurious,"One of the best hotels in London by far. The epitome of luxury with a quirky edge. Staff are amazing and friendly and really make you feel welcome.

132,"Calm, tranquility and pure luxury- the spa!","It is hard to describe this place without littering my review with cliches and over used phrases, or even to not gush in the style of a lovesick teenager, but that's how it made me feel.

The changing room felt like it was my own private space. I loved the set up, and lack of walls, with just white curtains everywhere, it felt like I was walking around in a dreamlike state somewhere in between reality and sleep. SO relaxing and I haven't even got to the massage and facial yet, which was just outstanding. My husband treated me for my birthday, and I felt thoroughly spoilt rotten when I left. The chap who did my massage was so lovely, friendly and incredibly good at massage. Honestly, I floated out there afterwards! 

Love love love and cannot wait to return! 

Thank you for a tremendous afternoon of pampering!,",5,2015,08,07
132,A lovely hotel in a great location ,"This is a really stylish hotel but still very practical. My wife and I went for one night and were blown away by this place, it's quite minimalistic but we loved this and would definitely stay again. Service was great, except one slightly disappointing experience in the long bar whereby the staff were too busy dancing to the excellent live band so I could not get their attention to order another drink. I refuse to shout to get myself noticed, especially in an establishment like this. However this didn't really impact on our stay much and I would definitely recommend this hotel.

Will definitely go back with out children",5,2015,08,07

132,Relaxing Spa day at the Sanderson,"We visited the Sanderson hotel in order to use the Spa facilities as we were staying in a sister hotel and the service was fantastic.  The staff on the desk were extremely helpful and the doorman got us a taxi when we were leaving the spa, nothing appeared to be too much trouble.  The spa itself is amazing and extremely relaxing, all the staff  are friendly, helpful and very professional.  Our visit here was the highlight of our stay and Emma in the spa was the best beauty therapist I have used, she was so friendly and welcoming.",5,2015,08,05

The outside of the hotel is not the prettiest, however when you walk in its completely the opposite. The whole look of the hotel is stunning and its very clean.
The staff are extremely helpful and our room was perfect. Having stayed in quite a few london hotel I was not expecting the room to be as spacious as it was, the bed was also extremely comfy.
The breakfast was delicious and wish I could have stayed here for a lot longer!
I will definitely be returning to the Sanderson and would recommend it to anyone.",5,2015,08,05

132,"Best London Hotel...Best Location, Total Luxury, Best Service","As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the friendly staff and we found the check-in to be smooth and quick.  The lobby is decorated beautifully and as we were checking in, the kids took turns on the indoor swing and lip shaped couch.  I can't say this enough-The staff could not be more friendly and welcoming.  Paris, the guest relations manager, treated us with the utmost respect and professionalism. Our room was lovely in every way - quiet, comfortable beds, heavenly shower and bath area.  We were surprised and delighted when some treats of fruit and cakes were delivered to our room.  Breakfast was something we looked forward to and we were not disappointed.  The afternoon tea at the hotel is simply spectacular with a Mad Hatter theme (just google it to see the images...WOW!).  The spa and gym are amazing.  The bar seems to be the place to be at night.  The location is central so it's easy to walk to Covent Garden, British Museum, Piccadilly, Regents Park, Oxford Circus, Buckingham Palace, Churchill's War Rooms, etc.  Most of the shows are walking distance as well.  Thank you to all the staff at the Sanderson who made our stay so memorable.",5,2015,08,04
132,Very Impressed- Amazing Hotel,"Have stayed in nearly all the 5 star hotels around London especially in the Mayfair area, this hotel is now my favorite one out of them all. It was my first time staying at the Sanderson hotel and I was so impressed. The decor is fabulous and trendy, I mostly loved our bedroom (superior room) which was spacious with a gorgeous big bathroom, i loved all the windows which brightened up the room a lot with the white decor, it was mine and my boyfriends 5th anniversary and there was champagne and rose petals on the bed which was lovely. The staff were so friendly especially the concierge who couldn't of been more welcoming and helpful when we unloaded and loaded our bags in and out the car. Big king bed was comfy and for two nights the hotel was perfect. Right off Oxford street so a one minute walk to lots of shops and restaurants! Loved it - will be back!!",5,2015,08,04
132,Very impressive overall servce,"On Arrival the reception staff were very friendly and attentive, the bar staff were more than helpful and had knowledge of the local area. We were given access to the private bar where the cocktails were divine, with a relaxed atmosphere.
The room was lavish with ample amounts of glass and stone and an amazing shower. The décor was exactly what was described, the staff were all professional, knowledgeable, and very friendly. A very nice experience and would recommend to others.

A surprise birthday cake and champagne in the room was a lovely touch. The room was perfect and so quiet - who could believe we were in the centre of London. On Sunday we had friends meet us and we have afternoon Tea, once again fantastic service.  We were very sad to leave hotel but we will definitely return. A very big thank you to all staff who looked after us. ",5,2015,08,03
132,Wonderful stay,"I stayed in this hotel (August 1st) with one of my daughters and I can't overstate  how friendly and warm the staff were throughout our whole stay The reception staff particularly went out of their way to be helpful and to accommodate our needs,thnaks to Guiseppe  and his colleagues on duty that day. When you enter the hotel you are immediately affected by the aroma of beautiful oils and then the quirky furniture,this all adds to the stay.I highly recommend a visit.
      ",5,2015,08,03
132,Modern chic hotel in quiet but accessible location,"Stayed in this hotel due to proximity to work.  From the outside, the hotel building looked like an office building.  But that quickly changes as you step in to the lobby with the large red lips seating and themed bar and restaurant.  The staff is very friendly from the person greeting you from the curb to the front desk and all.

The elevator can be dizzying and the hallways are dark.  But the room is spacious, modern and beautifully furnished, with draperies/screens that provided warmth to what would be a cold modern style.  It took a while to figure out the lighting and shading controls.

The bathroom design is not your typical, with glass partitions, shelving and marble top vanity and sink.  They didn't have much room for your shampoo and personal products in the shower area.  And I personally wish there was a bathtub to relax after a long day.  But overall, the room provided a nice sanctuary in the city.",5,2015,08,02
132,AMAZING stay at The Sanderson ,"We stayed here for our wedding anniversary and it was the best hotel by far I've stayed in. The staff were helpful, informative and it is down to their attention to detail that made our couple of days PERFECT. 
Our room - loft terrace - was out of this world, spacious, luxurious and the extra special efforts made by the staff for our anniversary made our stay all the better. 

The view from our terrace was Big Ben one direction and BT Tower the other way. 
The location of this hotel, right by Oxford Street was fantastic. 
First night we had room service and the food was divine. 
Breakfast was wonderful and the choice of food breathtaking. 
Choice of bars, the Long Bar, Purple bar ( sheer luxury) and Pool room were so decadent I'm lost for words !!! 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. ",5,2015,08,02
132,Fantastic Hotel with Fantastic staff,"I booked this hotel through Secret Escapes and reserved a Deluxe room. This was a weekend away for my wife's 50th birthday, so I emailed the hotel to let them know. I received an immediate response from Paris, the guest relations manager.

Upon arrival my wife was wished Happy Birthday by the receptionist and she hinted that there was something special in the room. We went to the room (230) to find a huge room. The design is nothing like any other hotel I have stayed in, with the bathroom area behind glass and electrically controlled curtains with numerous lighting options.
Our bed was decorated with rose petals and we were also presented with a complimentary bottle of Champagne.
The room overlooked the central courtyard. The windows did not open and were double glazed, but there was very good aircon.
We went to a show Saturday night and upon return the bar was very busy, with quite loud music playing (This did not bother us). The bar seemed very popular, not just with hotel guests.

Our booking included breakfast, which was a choice of hot dishes plus all-you-want buffet including cereals, cheese, meats, croissants, toast etc. Everything was good quality and fresh.

All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful.

Would definitely recommend this hotel for a stay in London and I would stay here again.",5,2015,07,30
132,Gorgeous design + great service,"This is a hotel that impresses as soon as you walk in the door. The desk staff are very friendly and helpful. The ambiance in the lobby is trendy and energetic. But the most surprising thing to me was walking into my room. There are a lot of hotels that do modern design well, but it always feels a little sanitized. The Sanderson has a unique take on design that made me appreciate little details that I haven't noticed in a hotel in a long time. The use of glass, combined with great lighting, makes the whole room feel like an art piece. I love how things like the bed and the sink are slightly off-kilter, making the whole room feel a set where everything is precisely placed. This is also one hotel where the design doesn't get in the way of functionality. There were nice considerations like a good reading light near the bed, a comfortable table for working, and strategically placed USB ports. All of this is on top of a perfect location near Soho Square and reasonable pricing for the center of London. A great stay, and I hope to be back again soon.",5,2015,07,30
132,Beautiful Design,"The hotel lobby, bar, restaurant, and rooms are beautifully designed and maintained. The rooms are particularly comfortable and offer all manner of convenience.  There are a variety of connection types, including USB and plug adapters.  Bed side connections help travelers with mobile phones.  The room decor is elegant and innovative.

132,Glamorous minimalism,"An extraordinarily chic hotel in a hip location and not too expensive. The interior design is Phillipe Starcke ca2000 and has worn well. Don't stay on the weekend when the theatre visitors and shoppers from the provinces crowd the place out. Midweek is much cooler

The room was a room to die for! Really impressive, and confortable, as well as very quiet and relaxing. Very quirky room. The attention to detail this hotel provides is beyond expectations! The breakfast food was of super high quality too. I will absolutely be staying here again on my next visit to the city.",5,2015,07,29
132,A lovely pleasant stay. ,"Here for my boyfriends birthday. Choose this place cause I saw the review was good and it was indeed great. The staff at the desk was really friendly and helpful. They were very helpful too when I called for room service 

First entering the room. It was really clean and beautiful minimalistic. They sprinkled rose petals on the bed making it more romantic for me and my boyfriend and had a welcome cake for us :) and champagne was delivered to our room immediately by a friendly staff. 

Room was beautiful, with a great spacial room. The TV was personalized to us. Must say the room was good. Slept really well and had a wonderful sleep. 

The breakfast was complimentary with a wide range of buffet choices from the table. Fresh products like cheese, choices of bread and fresh berries were the highlight and the English breakfast was delicious. Again the waitress was really friendly and lovely. 

A must stay as this hotel is really good . ",5,2015,07,28
132,Beyond Expectations,"I booked two nights at the Sanderson for my fiancee's birthday as we were in London to see some sights and walk over the roof of the O2 Arena.  I wanted for her to enjoy some luxury and indulgence.  I'd eaten at the restaurant in the Sanderson before and knew it to be a nice, trendy place and so thought it would make a great place for us to stay.

I made contact with the Front of house Manager prior to our visit with a couple of requests and to let them know that it was a special occasion.  Well, to say we were well looked after is an understatement.  Right from the start everyone we had contact with was friendly, professional, helpful and relaxed.

We arrived early and left our bags before returning later to be shown to our room.  The front desk staff took all of this in their stride and were really helpful.

The room was lovely, it had a view overlooking the courtyard, it had a massive bed, which was incredibly comfortable and a really powerful shower and nice big standalone bath.

As it was midweek the Long Bar was not very busy, although busy enough still for there to be a good atmosphere.  The same went for the residents Purple Bar.  The drinks were fantastic, I had the signature 'Sanderson' Cocktail which was delicious.

We only had breakfast on the last morning as we had to be at the O2 early on the first morning so didn't have time sadly.  The breakfast we had was very tasty and filling and we rolled back up to our room.

We also made use of the gym which for a hotel gym is well equipped with modern machines and some free-weights.  There are also resident personal trainers, not that we used them.

All in all this was a fantastic stay, my fiancee had a wonderful time and felt very special thanks to the service we enjoyed and the extra touches that were included thanks to the front of house manager.

We will definitely stay here again and would recommend that others do the same.",5,2015,07,28
132,Utterly beautiful,"I stayed here for one night and from the chap that helped me out of my taxi, to the lady that checked me in and the chap that brought my room service - I found my experience to be absolutely perfect.

Room service food was excellent, happy son!
Staff very friendly and comfortable in their roles!

132,Lived up to its reputation,"Great hotel , fantastic service , definitely worth a stay . It is not the cheapest hotel but it is well worth it . We had plans to head out for the evening but after spending a few hours in the Purple Bar and The Long Bar we decided these venues were better than the entertainment around the hotel . A really enjoyable overnight.

132,Loevly hotel in great location,"My daughter and I recently stayed at the hotel - not really knowing what to expect, as we have never stayed at a Morgan's hotel before.  We did not eat in the hotel as we had a packed schedule, but the staff were second to none, nothing was too much trouble and it was an absolute pleasure to stay.  We upgraded our room to a loft, which was beautiful and everything was spotless.  We would definitely stay here again and would recommend the hotel, as both the staff and location were fabulous!",5,2015,07,27
132,Best ever stay,"Having stayed at the Sanderson's many times before it was wonderful to be back at the best hotel in London! It has been a few years as we have tried newer 'hipper' hotels but nothing beats this place!! The staff was amazing and helped make this stay for a special occasion unforgettable. Cannot wait to come back soon!!

132,Funky hotel brilliant location,Warm welcome from the moment the taxi drew up at the door.  Fun modern decor and young friendly staff.  Very comfortable room and lovely spacious bathroom. Asked for kettle and tea which promptly arrived.  Lots of spa treatments to choose from and staff welcoming but I personally did not like myriad curtain arrangement which I found slightly disorienting and frustrating as unable to hear what beautician was saying and could not ask about treatment as disturbed silence.  Breakfast copious and fresh with lots of healthy options including kale and avocado on a muffin with poached eggs - only reproach was that plate was not heated.  ,4,2015,07,26
132,Brilliant hotel!,"My boyfriend and I visited The Sanderson hotel on July 3rd. As soon as we walked into reception we were greeted by Jonathan at the front desk who made us feel very welcome. Paris, came to greet us and told us they had upgraded our room  free as it was my boyfriends 30th birthday. 

When we were shown to our room, there was champagne on ice and a cake. The room was superb. We felt like celebrities. The room was so clean and spacious. The design was modern and artistic. We could have quite happily lived there!

We went out for the evening and returned to the hotel and had a drink in the purple bar. Waiter helped us both choose a drink and very friendly. When we went to our room, there was yellow roses covering the bed which was a lovely surprise. 

We have told everyone about the Sanderson and would definitely come back.",5,2015,07,25
132,Best hip central london hotel,"4 nights at this great hotel.  All the staff are totally awesome.  The rooms are superb.  The beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in.  Could they do better at anything? I cannot  think of something.  No!

Oh and you can play pool and drink martinis at 3.00 am!",5,2015,07,25
132,"Great Location, High Standards","I use this hotel quite a lot for when I'm in London on business.
Staff always attentive and friendly. High standards that are consistent throughout. Never had a problem with any of their rooms, and the location is exactly what I need for central London.",5,2015,07,24
132,The best hotel in London,"I truly enjoyed my stay thanks to the fabulous Sanderson staff and the exceptional restaurant level.
I was blown away by the cocktails in the Purple bar and left completely overwhelmed by the dinner in the courtyard. 
Breakfast has a fantastic selection and a special thank you to Gabby who has been so caring for us.
Highly recommend it to everyone. ",5,2015,07,21

132,Trendy and cool with traditional service values,"This is a trendy and cool hotel conveniently located within walking distance of the West End and Oxford Street. The rooms are modern, spacious with all the amenities provided as well electrical fittings or adapters supplied. The service level is exceptional at front desk and in all departments including doormen, porters and the entire team. The staff is friendly and welcoming, always.",5,2015,07,19
132,Amazing ,"This is an amazing hotel with beautiful rooms! I would really recommend this interesting unique hotel as the lifts are fantastic, the mad hatters tea was huge and gorgeous (loved the amount of selection of food and tea) and the rooms are out of this world. There is also very quirky rooms and areas. ",5,2015,07,19
132,Wonderful stay,"My partner and I recently stayed at The Sanderson and were most impressed. The staff at check in were very welcoming and made us aware of all of the features of the hotel and room.  The room was beautifully clean and we liked the simple style and crisp white linen, reasonably spacious too.

After returning from dinner we went for a drink in The Long Bar, the courtyard was a lovely setting on a warm summer evening and service was attentive, great cocktails too!

We took breakfast at the hotel the next morning and each had The Sanderson Benedict, really tasty and again service was great.  Our only disappointment was that we were only staying for one night. We will be back! 

",5,2015,07,19
132,Brilliant hotel loved it,We went for my boyfriends bday when we got there the staff was so friendly and helpful the hotel is amazing they even left a bday cake and bottle of wine in our room for my boyfriends bday which was lovely to come back to and then on the night when we arrived back from our meal there was rose petal on the bed the guy on reception desk was reAly nice polite and helpful top class service all the time gorgeous hotel and central to Oxford street 5 min walk would defiantly come back ,5,2015,07,15
132,Best hotel in London. ,"Always stay at the Sanderson when in London. This is by far the best hotel in the city. Amazing location. Amazing decor. Amazing staff. Would not recommend staying elsewhere. Their sister hotel in NYC, the Morgan's is also my hotel of choice. ",5,2015,07,14
132,"10th Wedding anniversary, an experience we will never forget!","We stayed at this hotel for our 10th Wedding Annversary as we were visiting London to watch Ed Sheeran.  We were so amazed by the personal service we received from the Hotel (especially Paris on the front desk) at the time of booking we mentioned it was a special occasion and when we arrived our room had been upgraded, there was a bottle of champagne in the room with a card congratulating us and a lovely little cake with a Happy Anniversary message.  We were overwhelmed as this started the evening off beautifully!  From arriving at the front doors, the staff were so helpful and polite we were very impressed.  When we returned later that Evening they had also been in and covered the bed in Rose Petals which was a very nice touch and much appreciated.  The breakfast was amazing and again the staff couldn;t do enough for us. I can honestly say i don't think we would have received that kind of service in any other hotel and will definitley return asap. PS. The Cocktails in the Purple bar were amazing and the barmen were really friendly too!!",5,2015,07,14
132,This hotel has pizazz - great style and location!,"My husband and I stayed here for my 30th birthday - the ambiance and amenities were on point! Despite it's simple exterior, this hotel is very well designed and appointed on the inside, with fun details and furniture throughout. The rooms were very crisp and comfortable and we had everything necessary to make our stay comfortable. The bar in the lobby / outdoor terrace is really posh and packed with outside guests throughout the night. Staying on the 1st floor, we thought we would have heard the music and noise, but it was actually very quiet. We also enjoyed the Mad Hatter tea, which was such a wonderful experience with its creative details and tasty treats (book early, we had to negotiate a reservation 1 month in advance). The hotel is located in Soho with lots of pubs and cute breakfast places surrounding it, with the larger shopping streets just a few steps away. Just be careful that if you call for a taxi that you get a metered one vs. a private car, we were told it was the same price and it was definitely higher plus service charge for using a credit card. We had the best time here and would fully recommend it to anyone interested in feeling super trendy and spoiled!",5,2015,07,12
132,Wow factor,"I spent months looking for the perfect hotel in London to celebrate my boyfriends 50th birthday. I finally chose The Sanderson as I was looking for something a little bit different and it seemed to tick all my boxes.
The website photos are very accurate (unlike some) so I was not disappointed.  The staff are fantastic - friendly, helpful and above all, unpretentious. 
The corridors to the rooms are dark and lit up by room number plates on the floor but when you open the door you're met with a light airy room. The huge bed was covered in rose petals and was one of the most comfortable I'd ever slept in. 
The bedroom and bathroom are separated by a transparent curtain but there is also a gold curtain which gives privacy if required.

The only criticism I have is that the room was stifling hot and the air con system was not powerful enough for the room so was completely ineffective. We were given a fan but it was extremely noisy. 
The lock on the toilet door was broken and the door swung open. We reported it but it was not fixed during our 2 night stay.
The hotel is in a great location and is in walking distance to Oxford Street and Soho and is a 5 minute walk to the nearest tube station.
We got a taxi to see The Lion King but it would actually have been quicker to walk.

132,super modern & sleek,"we stayed in an amazing loft room. it was huge, spotlessly clean, ultramodern with a stylish twist. Nothing was too much trouble & the attention to detail was perfect.  
the hotel is within good walking distance for many of the London sights and shows.
breakfast was plentiful & the cocktails at the bar divine. 
We Loved, Loved Loved it all.",5,2015,07,09
132,Strange But Nice,"This is quite a strange hotel, very quirky and very modern.  Great place to stay and the staff were excellent. Spent time in the spa which was lovely, perfect end was the strawberries and champagne. The Long Bar is a great place to have a cocktail before dining.

132,SUPERB HOTEL,"Perfect location just off Oxford Street. Stayed for 3 nights with my daughter. Can't fault this place. Lovely, friendly staff who were always happy to help. Gorgeous room and bathroom. And an amazing bar with a great atmosphere any night of the week. My daughter enjoyed it so much she's staying here again this weekend to celebrate her graduation. Loved the eclectic feel of the public areas.",5,2015,07,07
132,Stylish London hideaway,"Great hotel, stayed here many times, although rooms, as is typical for London, tend to be small. Attention to detail in the rooms, and the lobby areas feels like stepping into fairytale. The long bar is always lively in the evenings with plenty of none-guests drinking there.",4,2015,07,07
132,Wry fancy meets Luxury caress,"There is an Alice in Wonderland feel as you enter the lobby of the Sanderson London.  A pair of headset strutting young bellmen smile at you as though their trousers could be tearaways.  Millennial girls swing from 60's basket chairs and you can ride the famed cosmic elevator and possibly meet, as I did, a freshly rosy, gorgeous, furry specimen of the male sex all dished out in a terry towel robe riding from the spa back up to his room and you also might be forced to exclaim ""I'm I had a dream like this once"", to which his rose face might burst out laughing and announced ""Touche!"" even though you are both over (shhhhh!) a certain age and far too exhausted to do anything about it.  Still, the fantasy is there for the intrepid.  The Sanderson has just the right amount of suites - my sleigh bed had pillows on both ends which made me think of a Finnish speed skating team for some reason and the bathroom looked a little like a mad surgeons playground.  On a functional level the beds were perfect, views lovely, room service was excellent, breakfast just fantastic, long bar very lively.   I adore the Sanderson.  It's the type of hotel you promise yourself you will check into for a few months under the excuse of writing a great novel but really it is just to have a fabulous time.",5,2015,07,04
132,Nice hotel in a good location,"Stayed here for 4 days on business. Was a nice hotel in a great London location. Didn't try to bar, club or Mad Hatters tea. Room was very nice and comfortable. Good noise shielding. Was very quiet. Room service was very good.

Seems to be priced similar to other nice hotels for this area of London.",4,2015,07,04

Good location and central to good bars and shops. Would recommend to young people. Modern rooms but still have a luxury finish ,5,2015,07,01
132,A little bit mad,"loved this hotel its eccentric but stylish, its a shame they have closed the malaysian food court as the food was spectacular. The staff have a fine attention to detail and addressed you by name on each occasion they saw you in the hotel . Strange picture of a dog on the bedroom ceiling but each to their own. The Alice in wonderland bar is an interesting concept , watching A 6ft3 american sitting on a miniature stool was amusing , where I wonder was the mad hatter, oh yes that would have been the barman !!!!",5,2015,06,30
132,"Beautiful hotel, superb service - faultless.","I stayed for a weekend with my sister in June 2015 as a treat to celebrate my upcoming wedding and her 40th Birthday. On arrival we were told we had been upgraded, but the room wasn't yet ready. Not a problem at all when you have the beautiful Long Bar to perch at while you wait! When we checked in after a leisurely cocktail in the bar, we were blown away to discover we had been upgraded to a Loft Suite! Not only that, when we entered the stunning room, there was a bottle of champagne and two little cakes wishing my sister happy birthday and me happy hen weekend! The room was incredible, huge and incredibly stylish with sleigh bed, a free standing bath and balcony large enough for a seating area and 2 loungers! I cannot praise this hotel or it's staff enough. So friendly, professional, welcoming and really willing to make your stay the best it can be. I thoroughly recommend staying here, I know they have competition from the Edition just opened on the same street, but don't be swayed, this is the place to stay. 5*****",5,2015,06,30
132,Trip to my favourite spa!!,"I am a repeat visitor to the lovely spa at the Sanderson. The staff are exceptional from the front desk to the therapy rooms. The quality of the services is consistently excellent and the environment is calm, quiet and relaxing. The perfect escape from a busy London day.",5,2015,06,29
132,"Our Favourite, Funky, and Fabulous London Hotel","My girlfriend and I stayed here three years ago, and we returned this weekend.  It truly is our favorite London hotel.  Incredibly trendy, yet perfectly relaxed, The Sanderson offers a calm oasis in the center of London.  It's not cheap, but you certainly get what you pay for.  The rooms are large, well designed and comfortable.  The bar down stairs can be loud over the weekends, but also offers some fantastic cocktails.  The staff are incredible, and will do anything they can to make your stay special.  We will be back!",5,2015,06,29
132,Excellent and beautiful Sanderson hotel in London,"I really enjoyed my stay. The staff was very helpful, especially Guiseppe at the front desk. He was fantastic to help me with all my questions! The hotel is a beautiful designer hotel in the heart of London near Oxford street. I recommend it. 
      
      ",5,2015,06,29
132,awesome,"Great Hotel, staff is amazing and there seem to be hundreds of team members available to you at any time. Location is great: shopping 1 minute to go, bars and restaurants all around (Soho), Regents Park 10 minutes walking distance. Tube station, rental bikes, bus stations, all in walking distance.
Rooms are great too. Only downsides: view from the room is nothing special, but you wont spend too much time in your room anyways, which you on the contrary can do as they are large enough not only for London but also for international standards and comfy. Second, I couldn't (or did not find out how to) open the windows. Air condition is in the room and works fine, but I like to let in some ""fresh"" air. Bar is great, interior design is great, what else? If you can afford, book it.
I stayed in my room alone, so I cannot remember if you can close the toilet as the bathroom was separated by curtains and not by walls, so if you are a couple and need complete privacy on the toilet, sort it out first by asking.",5,2015,06,26
132,Such special treatment was a treat indeed,"What does luxury feel like? Of course, it would depend on who you asked but perhaps it would be the taste of Champagne or delicious cocktails, or it might a king size bed with high thread count sheets, or for the more adventurous, a private intergalactic journey with a view of the stars (hint: the lifts are super cool). 

For my husband and I, I confess it simply felt luxurious to spend our anniversary in London while our young children were being looked-after by the grandparents… somewhere else! 

That was just the beginning though. Our previously simple view of luxury though has been spoiled for good now as we were utterly spoilt at the Sanderson with all of the luxuries listed above and more. Our upgrade to a King Deluxe room, with champagne on arrival was a perfect start, our room was a quiet and glamourous room with a big bath, a luxe double head shower and all the creature comforts you could want from a hotel room. 

The cocktails at the Long Bar, specifically the ‘Sanderson Cobbler’ and the ‘Black Bisson’ were the most delicious cocktails that either of us had ever tried. Like seriously, go there and order them. You won’t be disappointed! 

I think the best bit for us though is how special we were made to feel. Every staff member we encountered, and particularly Paris made us feel especially welcome. I have never before received such special treatment and this was a treat indeed. Thank you to the Sanderson and Paris – we will be back!",5,2015,06,24
132,The perfect choice,"What  an experience.  The best hotel, but not just because of the facilities, my experience is based on the staff of the hotel. Young gentle professionals always ready to help you and make you stay as unforgetable as possible. Gotta mention Jose and Ana (thanx for finding my phone) from front desk, in the bar is the superb Zibby, a truly profesional barman that is simply an outstanding person with a permanent smile. But really need to mention JOSE (above all)  and Aldo, the two bellboys... Cant find the words to thank them for their help, the Sanderson fame must be because of them. Actually every single worker made my weekend memorable. 

About the hotel, must mention the decoration and location. But that, many other hotels have. This is special because of the great group that seem to enjoy their work.

Thanks thanks thanks. 

Wait for me 'cause i'll be back.",5,2015,06,24
132,Surprisingly Spectacular Staff,"We ended a 10 day Euro adventure with a night at the Sanderson before flying home to Chicago and after a previous trip when the hotel we stayed at as the last stop was a disappointment, the Sanderson was a tremendous surprise in multiple ways. First of all, the staff. The front desk staff was incredibly courteous and wonderful. They gave us a very quiet room on the 3rd floor which had one of the more comfortable bed I've ever slept in within GB. After a lot of traveling between various countries, this guaranteed goodnight sleep was more than welcome, After doing a little shopping upon arrival (great access to Liberty/Bond St/Selfridges btw), we grabbed a lovely craft cocktail at the clever bar on the lobby level. It was pretty scene-y, but just enough that it provided fun people watching without a pretentious vibe. I'm always a critic of bathroom amenities, but there isn't really anything bad I can say about this one: GREAT hairdryer, Malin bath products, perfect water pressure in the shower. One sink and mirror, but the lighting for makeup was pretty spot on. My husband and I would absolutely love to stay here again - it was quite a good value for the fabulous vibe, location, and insanely comfortable bed.",5,2015,06,22
132,"Great design, great service, great nights sleep","This was the second time we'd visited the Sanderson. My boyfriend and I came back to celebrate our upcoming anniversary (the last visit was for his birthday)
All staff were very friendly and helpful. We were made to feel very special.
Therry and J.J on reception were lovely and made us feel very welcome.
Edward in the restaurant was great fun (very tall!)
The food was beautifully presented (We were lucky enough to be there for the new Allan Pickett menu) 
We had a lovely Deluxe room and enjoyed the big free standing bath.
Thank you to everyone at the Sanderson...!",5,2015,06,22
132,Is the Sanderson a pub or a hotel?,"I like the Sanderson.  You have wonderful front of house staff and they bend over backwards to help. The rooms are comfortable - but the minimalism gets bizarre at times when one tries to find a shelf for the soap and shampoo in the shower! And how about some tissues in the bathroom please? But the biggest issue for myself and my colleagues is that you have no quiet area where a guest can have a discrete chat. This is because the Sanderson's bar area has become a very hip nightclub most nights ohte week.

Even in Philip Starcke's post-modern world, I sincerely hope there's still room for a place of relative peace and quiet. Too often, it's just impossible for a house guest to get a seat at the bar and even if we do, it's so noisy that it's impossible to have a quiet ale. I appreciate that the Sanderson is directed at a younger, hipper, crowd but I do think you're alienating a large percentage of a  high net worth clientelle by not considering the possibility of a guests only lounge.",3,2015,06,22
132,Great Experience at the Sanderson,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights (June 10-14). There isn't much to say which hasn't already been said; The hotel is very stylish and modern, with the rooms being large with ample closet and shelf space to unpack your belongings. Customer service was great, we had arrived at noon after travelling overnight and the front desk worked quickly to get us a room as soon as possible without any issues. We had requested some items to be delivered to our room throughout the week (iron, etc.) and these items usually arrived within 10 minutes of us calling. We also took the opportunity to participate in the Afternoon Tea with some friends which was a lot of fun, I highly recommend it to anyone who is considering it - the food was excellent as well as the service.

We had a great experience at the Sanderson and would definitely stay here again when visiting London!",5,2015,06,21
132,My home away from home but with a splash of trendiness thrown in,"I've been staying at the Sanderson for years. Each time I go to London I think that perhaps I should try something different, however if I have ever ventured off I have very quickly returned. The hotel itself oozes cool, its trendy without being stuffy. The rooms are a great size and whilst minimal they feel cosy and inviting, especially at night when the candles are on. But what really makes this hotel are the staff. Most of them have been there for years, they are happy, friendly and go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. Another big plus is the awesome (almost full size) gym, the luxurious spa and the wonderful buffet breakfast which caters to everyone including those of use who are looking for a healthy start to the day. I love everything about the Sanderson hotel. Many thanks to everyone from Concierge, Reception and the restaurant for making me feel so welcome every single time I visit.",5,2015,06,21

132,Superb in Every Way,"This hotel is superb in every way, the rooms are lovely and well equipped. Reception, the door and the concierge friendly and professional. The guy on the door even ran the length of the road to get us a cab as we were in a hurry.

The bar, and Restaurant are well staffed and provide a good level of food and drink.

Happy in every way. Would be nice to have tea and coffee facilities in the room though.",5,2015,06,18
132,Nice and comfortable,"Centrally located, within walking distance to Oxford Street. Nice and comfortable room with a huge bathroom. In fact, it's one of the largest that I've been to. Staff was nice and attentive while service was fast.",4,2015,06,18
132,Perfect combination of location and hotel experience,"I'm writing my review even before we have left. We arrived and staff were happy and helpful straight away. Our room was ready to check in. The rooms of the Sanderson are exactly as you see on their website so no surprises or disappointments.room size great. We had just arrived from Paris tiny rooms.
 Emily at the concierge station is delightful. Always with a smile and some lovely tips for meals. She has a very personable manner.
we had an unexpected alarm this morning. It was a false alarm and they were so apologetic. A note was left on our  room door within the hour from the duty manager and a lovely offer of taking care of our breakfast.
There are roadworks at the moment and even though we occasionally can hear them during working hours it hasn't disturbed our sleep and does not impact on your stay.
Whilst here there were significant amounts of girls hanging out the front of the hotel. On enquiry from staff they would not disclose who was staying-very diplomatic . Of course the girls outside shared who they were waiting for..boy band..five seconds of summer. It didn't impact on our stay.
Location ..right near soho..walking to anything is easy
Value..hard for me to comment as our dollar is so bad, so it is on the dearer side for Australian.
Bed is really comfortable. Towels great size. Bathroom shower fabulous.. We have loved it and would definitely recommend to friends.",5,2015,06,16
132,Modern Luxury,"We don't get out that often so when we do - it has to be good. I loved the modern but still very luxurious feel of the Sanderson - the bed was pure white and super comfy. 
The location is very central and easy to walk to great restaurants and bars nearby.

132,Emily,"What a perfect stay. They took amazing care of us. It was a mini-moon and they made us feel so special. The room design is clean and thoughtful, the afternoon tea is fun. And the staff can't be beat. Great neighborhood for walking to shows. I highly recommend!",5,2015,06,15
132,Oddly comfortale,"I spent approximately a month at the Sanderson. I must say that the staff was possibly one of the most efficient and friendly I have encountered. It is a reflection of their management.

As far as the rooms are concerned...if you like Starck then you'll be well served. But as functionality is concerned it is 'wanting'.... If your stay is a short one then you will enjoy the comfortable bed and the basic structure of the room won't be a bother. But if you stay longer, as I did, you will realize that the rooms are designed to 'look' good but their functionality is below average.
A couple of examples : the mirror over the bathroom sink is about 2 feet away and to the side so if you trim your beard, inevitably all the stubble falls on the counter or the floor. The hot and cold knobs in the shower are 'slick' aluminum so when you're in the shower and have a little soap on your hands, its impossible to control the temperature..the separation between the room and the bathroom is a big glass wall. Nice looking, airy, but easy to smack into and certainly absolutely 'un- private'.

I know these are secondary but for a long stay its a bother.

Nonetheless, the management and staff do everything they need to to make your stay as pleasant as possible. The location of the Sanderson is perfect. The restaurant  good enough and the bar is a 'scene' from Wednesday through Saturday.

I would certainly recommend to stay there over a long week-end.",4,2015,06,12
132,"Spacious rooms, good location, nice bar","Excellent hotel. Front of the building does not give the right picture about the inside. Spacious rooms, good location, nice bar.
Only downside was that service at breakfast was quite slow, even when only ordering a cappuccino.",5,2015,06,11
132,Lovely night in quirky hotel,"We booked our night away from the family, a rare night as a couple again, as an early 50th birthday treat for my husband, and it didn't disappoint.  The staff were polite, friendly and helpful from the moment we entered the lobby.  The decor was fun and modern and gave us a feeling away from home and in a city centre hotel with some style.  The room was a good size and the bed was large and comfortable.  My only comment is a personal one in that I would prefer a door to the bathroom, but that is probably a style thing.  We slept remarkably well, it was quite and comfortable and felt well looked after by the staff.  I would, definitely go back and recommend this well located City hotel.  Oh and the breakfast was lovely.  We were sad we were only there one night.",5,2015,06,09
132,Friday 5th June,"We stayed for one night last Friday for my husbands birthday, we had a meal at the Alan Pickett restaurant. The one thing that stood out for me was the impecable service, the staff were attentive and not over bearing and it was a pleasure to stay there and we will be back. The small touches like champagne in the room on our arrival was lovely. ",5,2015,06,08
132,A month at the Sanderson,"What a great experience. Being in a hotel for close to a month can be trying, however the staff at the Sanderson really did go the extra mile to make me feel like one of the family.

Really looking forward to my next stay.",5,2015,06,08
132,Fabulous and Stylish,"Excellent location, surprisingly stylish and ample rooms, caring staff. I'll now be travelling to London often, and stayed at the Sanderson given its proximity to my office. I'm not a fan of ""quaint"", so I was delighted with the modern vibe of the place. My experience was above average, and I will be back soon and often. Paris at the front desk was the definition of friendly efficacy. Highly recommended.

132,Weekend stay,"I stayed at this hotel for the weekend celebrating my friend's 60th birthday. The hotel is wonderful in every way, so quirky & fun. The staff are so helpful, couldn't do enough for us. Paris had arranged for a bottle of champagne to arrive at our room for my friend which I thought was such a lovely gesture. The room was lovely, great night's sleep in such a comfortable bed, finished off with a great breakfast. So lovely to have a garden as well there to sit in. Would love to come back one day.",5,2015,06,03
132,Birthday Suprise,"We came here as a surprise for my wife's birthday and we had a wonderful time the service was superb and all the staff were so helpful and friendly and everything we requested was done straight away.

Would happily stay at this hotel again.,5,2015,05,31
132,Awesome staff at the Sanderson,"OMG.  What a fabulous setting for our wedding anniversary.  Great room. Really sleek, clean and comfortable - great night's sleep.   Very close to everywhere we wanted to go to within walking distance; theatre district and plenty of lovely eateries close by.

We enjoyed a great breakfast with plenty of choice.  

However, what really makes the Sanderson so special is it's staff, so welcoming, friendly and really helpful.  Thank you for a memorable anniversary.",5,2015,05,31
132,design and comfort,"We stayed there recently for 4 nights. First when we checked in we received a small room which we were  disappointed with . Upon our request the room was changed to a much nicer and larger room (#401). The hotel is beautifully design, our room was amazing, large  very comfortable and highly equipped.
The receptionists and the concierge team are very helpful attentive and polite .
We will be happy to return",5,2015,05,31
132,Excellent customer service,"Great location...Central for theatres, restaurants, shopping and London attractions.  A quirky feel to the hotel.  Great cocktail bar.  The service by the staff was the best - nothing was too much trouble.",5,2015,05,30
132,Great hotel in a great location,"Service at the Sanderson was exceptional from check-in. I was recognized as having stayed in a prior visit and received a warm welcome. Check-in was a breeze and I was on my way to my room in no time.

The room itself was clean, modern and sleek. Bed was very comfortable with top quality linens - very conducive to a relaxing night sleep.

Bathroom was spacious and well laid out with plenty of storage space. The shower had excellent water pressure and there was no delay in the hot water.

Close to the Oxford Circus tube station and with plenty of taxis around, transportation was very convenient. Proximity to Soho and Covent Garden provided plenty of great bar and dining options. 

Bar and restaurant on the property is also not to be missed. The Long Bar and Purple Room are themselves a prime destination for Londoners.",5,2015,05,29
132,Still the best hotel in London,"Same stuff, same management, brilliant every time.
I call it home!
It started as a very trendy fashionable hotel, it grew to a well managed hotel, and today it's a London classical monument that is home for me in London.
Well done!",5,2015,05,28
132,Superb,"If you're after a contemporary and chic hotel in a lively district in London then I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough. My wife and I travelled for a one night stay for her birthday, the first impression within the reception was this was a very stylish place and the staff were really helpful at check in.

The room was really nice, modern and with all the facilities you would come to expect. The location is excellent, there are some superb bars, restaurants and pubs around the corner. At night the hotel really comes to life, the bar was a hive of activity with a dj playing some great tunes - it was a really great place to start / end the night.

All in all I was extremely happy with the hotel and will definitely be checking availability next time I'm in the capital.",5,2015,05,26
132,Stunning Hotel with Outstanding Staff,"One of the most outstanding hotels I have ever stayed in with outstanding customer service and incredibly friendly staff.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the staff were outstanding, the longbar was a perfect way to spend a few hours enjoying a few drinks and relaxing into our trip.

132,"Mod,  Quirky and Great","when i first crossed the threshold i wondered if this hotel was for me but i was impressed with a very good and courteous welcome by the reception. My room was very mod but the carpet was beautiful original and the bathroom with a walk in shower was spotless.
The bed was so very comfortable. I had a great nights sleep. The breakfast next day was exceptional and nothing was too much trouble. The staff were fantastic. I was truly impressed. There is a central area which is the garden. It is unusual but very nice. My second night was as good and i had room service which was very good indeed, once again served by first class staff.
I have read the critical review by an earlier reviewer who was critical. Take no notice she is talking out of her a.......
I will be back to this hotel when I'm next in London. it is very convenient.",5,2015,05,25
132,Modern with great location,"Modern trendy hotel with great location and nice staff. The interior is modern; the elevators are pitching dark (black), with celling like a starry. It’s rather dark in the corridors as well. The rooms are spacious light and unconventional interior. Drapes, curtains and glass divide the bathroom and bedroom. Not our style, but still a pleasant room with all facilities. The beds are spacious and comfortable. We slept like logs.

The breakfast included a great variety of selections, all prepared to your order. However, the service was poor and did not live up to the expectations of a hotel of this standard. One out four breakfasts, the meal was served within a reasonable time.",3,2015,05,25
132,Wonderful hotel with amazing staff!,"Just returned from a weekend break at the Sanderson London, all I can say is WOW! This hotel is one of the best we have ever stayed in. The staff where so attentive and made sure we had the best time possible. The Manager Paris is an absolutely brilliant Manager, she went over and above to make our stay superb. The facilities at the hotel are excellent as are all the staff. Warm, friendly and welcoming......thank you to each and every one of them. We will definitely we back. Don't hesitate in booking this hotel, I can guarantee you will have an unforgettable experience.",5,2015,05,25
132,Best hotel I've ever stayed in,"Customer service was perfect, rooms impeccable, trendy, romantic. Expensive but worth every penny. By far the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. When we arrived we had white and yellow rose petals on the bed, which we didn't even request. Impressed to say the least.",5,2015,05,25
132,Mr.Craig Broadhead,This is my second time to The Sanderson and it is an excellent hotel. Stayed in the loft terrace rooms which were immaculate and spacious and having additional huge balcony on to the room made all the difference with the sun. The long bar and blu bar still satisfy with contemporary and custom concoctions. Shout out to Eb1/Jon/June ....oh and Beaker,5,2015,05,25
132,My Favourite Hotel In London,"Centrally located for shopping, wining, Dining and perfect if you are doing business also as all my business appointments were happy to come to the area (north of Oxford Street).

The Hotel has great Food and Beverage facilities, fully stocked mini bar, 24 hour room service, a great gym and the best steam room that will ensure you leave the hotel revived and looking fresh.

Phil the head Bell Man is great and his team are always at the from door to greet you.  When you get to the front desk hopefully Paris or John are around as these guys Rock and make you feel like everything is possible and that you are a guest in their own home.

132,Top location and trendy,"top location, trendy and young atmosphere. Went for a family week end but I would advice it for couples or business. Nice hall with design furniture, very nice bar and restaurant. Outstanding service make you feel at home.

132,Excellent stay,"The hotel exceeded expectations. Great room service selection which arrived quickly, excellent service throughout, friendly staff and loved the attention to detail - newspaper in morning, eu/UK power converter, huge selection in mini bar, fruit basket hand delivered.
Then of course there's the decor and location. Too many positives to mention.",5,2015,05,21
132,Pretty Cool Weekend,"It had been a very nice weekend in Sanderson Hotel. The hotel is outsanding, the design remarkable, awesome breakfast and the location is perfect for weekend of tourism and fun, but the very best of all: their staff. They're lovely, helpful and very friendly. Special thanks to ours ""spanish friends"" of the staff Cristina (Reception), Jose (Bellman) and our Canarian waitress... you did us to enjoy London!

A hotel to come back without a doubt!",5,2015,05,19

132,Luxurious stay,"I was on a 10-day business trip and had the pleasure of staying at the Sanderson London Hotel. The staff were incredibly accommodating - from check-in to breakfast to late nights in the billiards room, I always had more than I realized I needed. The beds were comfortable and the towels exceptionally large and plush. Location: superb! Highly recommend this hotel to business travelers.",5,2015,05,17
132,"Splendid, sexy, party vibe","Pros: If you're into a more relaxed, modern and understated elegance, this place is for you! If you're a fan of the older more stuffy types- stay away. This exquisite boutique hotel is central to shops, restaurants and nightlife! The long bar is a great location for meeting friends! I literally held court there for 4 hrs one night! High energy, super charged, super fun. Place to see and be seen if that's your speed. If it isn't -steer clear. Very friendly staff! Matt at reception was especially helpful! Expect Malin + Goetz toiletries, ample linens. Sheets are comfortable but not the highest thread count I've ever had in similar establishments. Rooms are no frills, clean lines, draping creates a very sexy ambiance and perfect oasis for lovers!

Cons: it's ALWAYS busy in the lobby and bar. I'd probably not stay here on a business trip. In spite of heavy traffic, the rooms are very quiet. We had a room towards the front and nice street view. Hallways are dark and spooky! Meant to be alluring but I really just couldn't see in the dim lighting.

Overall I enjoyed it and am likely to return on my next social visit to London!",5,2015,05,16
132,"Back again, again..","I am lucky enough to get to stay here often on business trips. Some have been lengthy stays but most are short stopovers. I keep coming back because it draws me like a moth to a lamp. It's the service that shines out for me.

Above all else.

Sure the rooms are cool, the beds huge, facilities top-notch and the Long Bar is indeed very long. But it's the smiles on arrival, the reassurance at reception that all is as is should be, the familiar faces in the lobby, behind the bar and at the restaurant are what makes the difference here. Being home from home. ",5,2015,05,15
132,Absolutely Fabulous,"I loved this hotel so much. I've stayed in many hotels in London, but The Sanderson really stands out. 
Two things especially - 

First is the amazing design. This hotel looks like no other hotel I've stayed at. It is absolutely beautiful, and not just beautiful, but high quality finishes on everything.

Second is its amazing staff. From the moment I arrived it was friendly smiles and great attitude from all of the staff. 
The location of the hotel is central and great as well.
But really, the reason I will definitely return to this hotel is its wonderful staff.
You guys were awesome - Thank you!",5,2015,05,13
132,On of the best choice in London,We have spend a very good stay at the Sanderson Hotel. The service is perfect.  The room was very clean and confortable.

132,Great in Soho,"The Sanderson is a quirky and sophisticated hotel which is the sister hotel to the Covent Garden St Martin's Lane.

Like the St Martins Lane, this hotel is built from a former office building.  As a result it has a funky sixties modern vibe on the outside and rooms that are Starck-ly designed if you know what I mean.

The bar and restaurant are excellent, but the service is not very solicitous.

The rooms are comfortable and the baths are excellent.

If you are looking for a top boutique hotel near media and tech companies, this is a great choice.  It is not a great choice for you and your kids.",5,2015,05,09
132,Great stay but..,"Stayed at the Sanderson hotel at the beginning of April with my husband for his 40th birthday. We had a fantastic time and the hotel is great, clean, modern and is in a great location. My only complaint would be the concierge and the mini cabs we were being offered instead of the black taxis. We had specifically asked for a black taxi to take us to the tower of London but had been advised by the concierge to use a mini cab instead as black taxis can be rather expensive so we went reluctantly with the concierges advice. This proved to be a big mistake!! After roughly about an hour we finally reached our destination this was down to the fact that the driver had no idea where he was going or what the best route was to avoid the traffic. We were then hit with the cost of the fare which was £50.00!! We paid the fare but were not happy and decided after our visit to get a black taxi back to the hotel rather then to go through a similar experience again with a mini cab. This proved to be a much more pleasant experience with a friendly driver who got us back in half an hour for half the price!! When we got back to the hotel we mentioned what had happened to other guests only to find they had had similar experiences. Please please please can the Sanderson look into this policy and have it resolved as unfortunately it ruined what would've been an amazing trip for us.",4,2015,05,07
132,Amazing hotel with exceptional service!,"Exceptional sevice, fantastic breakfast. Nikola was our waiter at the restaurant - we could not be more pleased. He was very kind and helpful. I love their other hotels and I stayed at St Martins a few times, but Sanderson is really the best. The size of the bed is huge. My favourite hotel in London!",5,2015,05,07
132,Shopping in style,"I stayed with my daughter for 1 night - we had booked a standard room but asked for a twin bedded room on arrival and were delighted to be upgraded to a superior room with two queen beds.
Staff were very friendly and helpful.
A trendy hotel in a great position for Oxford St and shopping- very stylish decor
Our deal booked on the hotel website include a great breakfast

132,Very modern cool hotel in the heart of London's west end,"The Sanderson oozes cool...the service is exceptional and from the moment you walk I'm you are greeted by modern, funky design.  The bars are suitably stocked with high quality wines and spirits and a great place to hang out.  I had a roof terrace which was fantastic...huge room..super super king (if there is such a think!) bed and a terrace with loungers...

Great hotel and great experience.  Highly recommend! ",5,2015,05,06
132,Amazing hotel in central London,"I've stayed at the Sanderson a few times recently for work, and it hasn't disappointed yet. I have always been a fan of their sister hotel St Martin's Lane, but the Sanderson has overtaken it as my absolute favourite hotel in London. The hotel has been refurbished since I last stayed there a few years ago - the famous lobby and bar are the same, they don't seem to date, but the rooms have been given an update and all of them that I've seen (from standard to the deluxe when I was luckily upgraded) are comfortable, airy and peaceful to either work or relax in with plenty of space for luggage, work or whatever you need to do. Not everyone will like the 'modern' bathroom layout with the sink/bath area separated from the bedroom by just a glass wall and curtain, but I love it. Amazing showers, quality toiletries and a very comfortable bed with fabulous crisp white duvet, pillows etc. all make it somewhere I always want to come back to if I can afford it on trips to London.
Really lovely touches - mini cakes, fruit etc in the room on return visits too and lovely staff.
I haven't tried the restaurant - room service food is average - but the bar, when it's not too busy, is a lovely spot to meet friends for a drink away from the madness of Oxford Street. Had a facial in the spa recently too, and it was fantastic. The spa is stunning.",5,2015,05,06
132,Classic hospitality with a modern flair,"A great hotel in a great location. Friendly service, without being too obtrusive. The ""long bar"" can be very loud, as it is a lively ""place to be seen in London."" Ask about the private bar for hotel guests. Only 2 blocks from New Oxford Street and SoHo. Great restaurants to the north and east.",5,2015,05,04
132,My favourite in London,"Had my bachelor party in London based at the Sanderson - was just sensational in every way - food, staff, service, rooms, setting, attention to detail, facilities! As a Londoner I recommend this hotel to anyone and shall be doing so to my clients from the US going forward! JUST AWESOME!

132,Pure Fantasy!,"From the moment we entered through the hotel doors to our departure the following day we were constantly surprised by the exceptional service by ALL. 
Jose Piquer was so generous with our luxurious room upgrade, without even asking! 
We were always made to feel like we were THE VIPs. The breakfast was probably the best we have ever had in a hotel and the beds were certainly the most comfortable with all the luxury linen. Loved the special touches of lit tea lights and chilled champagne when we entered our room.
We hadn't booked for an evening meal and wanted to try a restaurant nearby, we asked their Concierge, Giacomo, for assistance and he was more than happy to make phone calls for us and secure a last minute booking. It was perfect. Nightcaps in the Purple Room for residents only were a perfect end to the day.Best London hotel experience we have ever had! Can't wait to return again!!",5,2015,05,01
132,Amazing!,"We had one amazing night at the Sanderson on Saturday 25th April. It was a celebration of my partner's birthday so I emailed in advance and Paris & Ruth very kindly sent us a lovely message with a cake and a complementary bottle of champagne! …It definitely started the weekend off on the right note!
We were also lucky enough to be upgraded to a Deluxe room. What can I say?! It was fantastic! Lovely, large freestanding bath, the biggest bed I've ever seen with fab super-soft linens. The whole hotel is an experience in itself, very cool indeed.
Breakfast was very nice, if a little slow, but we weren't in a rush so no problems there.
We didn't go to the bars in the hotel as we were so worn out after walking all day then a large, leisurely dinner, the Long Bar looked very busy and fun. We'll have to go back to experience all it has to offer!
The location is superb, two mins from Oxford St. We parked at the Sanderson parking which was about £55 for Saturday lunchtime to Sunday late afternoon, which I don't think is bad for central London, plus the car park was almost empty!
Brilliant stay in a fabulous hotel with very friendly staff. 
Two very happy customers!

132,Best hotel in London for fun and cocktails,"I have stayed at the Sanderson at least 20 times in the last 10 years.
Absolutely fantastic service, decor, food, room service.
The bar / restaurant are a great place to start your night out and the little cocktail bar for guests only is a great place to finish the night.
Highly recommend the kiwi martini.

132,Swanky Hotel in central London,"High design hotel, with eclectic lobby, great long bar and centrally located with 2-5 min walk from Soho and Oxford street. Front staff were very nice, courteous and professional. We got a room upgrade considering it was our first stay at the hotel, which was highly appreciated. Room was beautifully designed and comfortable on the eyes. If it wasn't for the over the top design of the elevator and badly lit corridors and lift, it would have been a great stay.
Overall, very good hotel and is recommended for a business trip or for leisure.",4,2015,04,24
132,Mission Anything Possible,"As a regular visitor to The Sanderson in order to see doctors and receive medical treatment, my requests are often a little different.
I'm never disappointed.
From the doorman offering to go pick up my prescription, to the front desk ensuring I have a room with a bath and extra hanging space.
From the F&B team making foods to suit a restricted diet and getting my favorite coffee, to the wait staff cheering me up with smiles, hugs and funny stories. And cake.
There is NOTHING that fazes the staff of this amazing hotel.
And all of this in a cool, conceptual, arty design hotel package.
Better than bliss - it's like a home from home. A luxury home.

132,THE place to stay when in London,"This hotel and its staff continue to raise the bar in refined informal luxury and style. The new room decor is a soft soothing palette while maintaining the style that makes this hotel so special. Can't say enough good things about all the staff that discretely make you feel at home. During a previous stay, I arrived at LHR only to be told my Montreal bound flight was cancelled and my airline offered to put me up at a local 4 star LHR hotel. First thing I did was hire a car and headed back to the Sanderson for the night. The place to stay when in London.

Complimentary upgrade to a stunning room with bottle of nice champagne in a nice bucket and fresh rose petals on the bed waiting for us. The hotel is stunning, the service fantastic ( they put extra ice and a temporary veuve cork in the bottle so we could finish it the next morning). Not very quiet overlooking the bar area until about 2am but would very highly recommend this hotel for a special break. Location is fantastic too.

Upon checking into the hotel my wife  mentioned about our anniversary and we were told we had been allocated a loft suite upgrade. It was the best accommodation we have ever stayed in worldwide, a very spacious suite, top notch interiors by Phillipe Starck, Malin & Goetz toiletries (my wife loved them), a fantastic and comfortable gigantic bed we got lost in and the staff couldn't have been more courteous, helpful and friendly.  Room service food was done to perfection and always on time and the whole feel and vibe of the hotel was relaxing, stylish yet friendly.  We had champagne with friends in the Purple Bar, this was ideal as it is residents bar so friends can avail of it too. We will definitely be back and would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2015,04,21
132,Still the One,"A big fan of Morgan Hotels, I first stayed at The Sanderson in 2009, so it was a pleasure to find it still hitting its straps in 2015.  This stay was for four nights, again taking advantage of the long bar off the foyer and the comfy bed/glass walled bathroom.  The hotel itself is fabulous, but its location is pretty special too.  A minute away from Oxford Street, an easy stroll down to Regent Street, off into Mayfair, Piccadilly, back into Carnaby Street and down Soho way.  The walking and the shopping is great.  So too doorman Phil, still there six years on and still smiling.  I'll be back.",5,2015,04,21

We hadn't stayed at the hotel for a few years, but were delighted that they still maintained the quirkiness and standards. My daughter thought that the ice cream sundae in the restaurant was the best!

Room was beautifully appointed and staff were very helpful.",5,2015,04,17
132,Love it!,"I always try to book in different hotels for my business trips. Sanderson was wonderful,  clean, design, vibrant and friendly hotel. 
Your room can become an open plan with the bathroom so better be with close friends. I spent most of my time in the room, that's how i can judge level of comfort and practicality.
One detail to remember the smell of the towels :) clean n refreshing. 
Thank you for the staff smiles and help.

132,Overnight in the City,"We spent a relaxed afternoon in the Long Bar which is always busy and buzzy, mojitos are excellent! We had a lovely room, the view was not important as we were only there to sleep really, bed very comfy and bathroom well equiped, a decent hairdryer!! Unheard of in most hotels. Breakfast again was a relaxed affair, excellent choice, staff attentive and polite.",5,2015,04,16
132,Wonderful hotel,"Lovely hotel, beautiful decor. Large spacious room. Roll top bath & separate shower. Extremely comfortable bed! Very helpful & attentive staff. Amazing breakfast (included in our price, though could work out pricey if you spend on the day). Have to request tea/coffee making facilities - but no bother. Nice cocktail bar, expensive London prices though. Will certainly go back! Lovely romantic first night away from our little boy.",5,2015,04,14
132,Business stay in London,"Very good hotel experience.
Nice, good and attentive service all over the hotel.
Certainly one of the best hotel bares in London.

132,Weekend away,Booked this for a weekend away to see family. Will definitely return because we didn't spend enough time in this hotel!! Staff very friendly and helpful. The room was fabulous. Breakfast in bed was a treat. The  lifts were fun and the cocktails were worth every penny. Can't wait to return!!,5,2015,04,13
132,Birthday celebration,"Another fantastic stay at The Sanderson - one of my favourite London boltholes. 

The super cool rooms never fail to impress, combined with brilliant service and an extremely efficient and friendly team. 

The atmosphere in the buzzing Long Bar on a sunny Saturday afternoon was perfect for kicking off our birthday celebrations - bar tenders served up the best mojito's in town! 

We rounded off the night in the sultry Purple Bar for a few decadent late night drinks! 

And breakfast on Sunday didn't disappoint either - we were offered the perfect 'His & Hers' combination of hearty and healthy options! Fuelled up and ready to face the day! 

So thumbs up to The Sanderson - We'll definitely be back!",5,2015,04,13
132,Styled to Death but Lacking a Heart!,"I booked 2 nights at the Sanderson for a 'girls weekend' with my 14 year old daughter. I'm going to preface my review by saying that this hotel definitely has a narrow target audience. If you are 20-40 years old, single or couple, no kids and very image conscious you are going to LOVE this place. It has Stark cool, modern, minimalist styling and has an air of being 'the' place to be for that demographic. But for everyone else it is a cold and unwelcoming place.

When we checked in, the receptionist told me about the 2 bars and restaurant, pointing out that one bar was for residents only. My daughter and I decided to get a quick drink in the residents bar before going out. When we entered a very beautiful bar maid asked me if she could help me as though I was in a place I shouldn't be. When I said we would like a table, she humiliated my daughter by asking to see her ID. I explained she was not 18, but we were residents and wanted to get a quick drink, to which she showed us the door - 'over 21s only' allowed. The only place the hotel would let us sit to drink was tucked out of sight in the empty restaurant. It was so embarrassing for me and my daughter. 

The style over service and functionality continues throughout the hotel. The rooms are cool, but sparse. The only place to use a hairdryer is sat on a tiled floor, there's no hot drink facility (unless you call housekeeping) and the glass and voile bathroom thing looks cool but is utterly impractical. There's no drawers, so all your stuff ends up scruffy on the shelves. The pitch black corridors with tiny lights looks really cool until you need to find your room key in your handbag!! 

So, think carefully before deciding if this hotel is what your looking for. The beautiful staff look gorgeous but have no heart. Customer service is very low on the agenda. In fact, you feel far too intimidated to ask half the time. However, I'm sure that some people reading this will absolutely love it.

132,Quite satisfied,"Rooms a bit small for one week or more stay. Good food but more variety needed i.e for vegetarians. Very happy with cleanliness/ maintainance. Design features very uplifting. Very well trained reception/restaurant/cleaning staff. Even though I checked in 10 pm staff were very attentive. Excellent breakfast.

132,Best hotel experience in London,"I stayed in the Sanderson for a work event on the 8th and 9th April. The hotel is well positioned in the Marylebone district with plenty of lovely restaurants, cafes and shops nearby. 
I was greeted warmly by the staff both on the door and at reception. My room was stunning, white decor and very airy. The shower was powerful and roomy too and the products were gorgeous. I have stayed in numerous hotels in this area for work purposes but have to say the Sanderson was by far the nicest I have experienced. It is definitely my number one choice from now on. 
              ",5,2015,04,11
132,Fantastic Hotel and well situated,"We booked here after I had been for afternoon tea to celebrate my friend getting married. A quick aside, the afternoon tea is a fantastic experience and delicious!  Now back to the Hotel.  When we entered a member of staff leapt to his feet and asked if he could help and directed us to the reception area.  The 'Front Desk Agent' was friendly and so helpful.  The decor is quirky which we loved. The lift has a mirrored frame and you enter into an amazing 'space' (you will have to go to appreciate my humour!)  The corridors were dark which made it more of an impact when you open the bedroom door to a delicately decorated room.  The bed was massive and extremely comfy.  The room has been well designed using light white curtaining (reluctant to say net curtains because that conjures up an image so different to this).  The shower was powerful so you get a free massage in the morning!  

The only negatives worth a mention: we were thinking of ordering room service, but with a 12.5% 'discretionary' service charge and a £3.50 tray charge we felt it was a bit expensive on top of the food prices (I should say here that I am half Yorkshire which makes me yell 'how much!' at Menus); when we returned from the theatre the bar was jumping with loud music and very busy so no relaxing drink before bed!

Breakfast was included as a special offer (otherwise it would have been £45 for both of us, all together now - how much!)  I had poached eggs which were cooked to perfection, the first time I have ever been asked how I like my poached eggs cooked.  The bacon, mushroom and tomato were perfectly cooked but the black pudding was divine.  There was a lot to choose from at the breakfast buffet, cereals, difference breads, juices, cakes etc.  Coffee was great and we were kept watered which was a lovely touch.  
 
A lovely stay and the staff really made the place for us.  Seeing staff in the corridor they all said hello. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff (fab training or recruitment or both), immaculately clean, quirky, central and comfortable bed.

Ooo one more thing, ask for a quiet room.  We did and there was no road noise at all.",5,2015,04,10
132,Excellent hotel in Great location,"I spent a week with  my wife. The hotel, the room, the stuff, the food, the bar, the spa, all are superb. The location is perfect. Lots of great restaurants and very close to the shopping area. Walking distance from the British Museum and many other great places. Will definitely come again.

132,Great service,We booked a birthday treat for our daughter and her husband to go to the Mad hatter's Tea party and then stay the night at the Sanderson. We called ahead and explained it was a treat and the duty manager was great....they upgraded the room and provided a birthday cake......which made a special occasion even more memorable. Thank you ,5,2015,04,06
132,Funky and out of this world,"Don't be put off by the outside of this hotel. You are in for a treat once you venture through the front door. We were given a gorgeous suite and were bowled over at how comfortable and elegant it was. The staff were friendly, polite and accommodating. 

Upon returning from our dinner, we were welcomed by a stunning fruit platter, candles and our bed had been turned down. 

In the morning we had an amazing breakfast bought to our room and I can thoroughly recommend the Agua Spa - the treatments were heavenly and I adored the relaxation pods being wrapped in a comfy quilt whilst chilling out listening to music.",5,2015,04,04
132,Sanderson signifies stunning superiority!,"Stayed here on Saturday 28th March 2015 & from the minute we arrived until the second we left we were made to feel a million dollars & as though all needs, likes, dislikes & wants were of paramount importance to all of the Staff. 
We were greeted by Concierge upon arrival, whom dashed out in the pouring rain to assist us with our luggage & was somewhat horrified that we even attempted to lift our own bags; clearly, despite being a contemporary styled hotel, the level of service remains high-end old fashioned five star & it really couldn't be faulted. 
The reception team, the bar tenders, the waitresses, waiters, the housekeeping & of course the concierge were all unfailingly professional, polite & helpful & genuinely seemed committed to their respective roles & seemed to care; particularly Indre, whom had assisted us endlessly with our respective reservation. 
Our room 227 was just stunning & despite us being a pair of female cousins enjoying a birthday weekend in the capital, we both commented the room would have been perfect for a romantic weekend since the bed was beyond enormous & situated centrally within the extra large room & the entire appointment & decor of the room oozed sex appeal! 
The interior was very modern & contemporary but also very comfortable with every possible amenity catered for; nothing had been overlooked or forgotten.
Everywhere was beyond immaculate; the bathroom was spotless, modern, with all the expected luxury extras in soaps, fluffy towels, robes & slippers & the super-king bed was amazingly comfortable with an incredibly soft mattress, crisp, fresh linen & space galore! 
We opted for room service breakfast & the service trolley was impeccable with every attention to detail paid; perfectly starched linen cloths & napkins, individual sauces, butters, preserves, pasties, juices, fruit, tea selection, breads, & the full English was delightful. 
We enjoyed a welcome cocktail at the bar after checking in which were just delicious & the variety to choose from was overwhelming! The service was professional, slick & efficient, but exceptionally friendly & personable which really made all the difference. 
We spent the day elsewhere shopping, eating & drinking & returned some twelve hours later, circa 23.00 hours to discover an absolutely vibrant buzzing bar atmosphere, but we were excessively tired & somewhat tipsy so opted to retire for the evening, although next time we return will definitely take advantage of the lively in-house bar scene as it really was very atmospheric & seemed to be very popular indeed.
Special thanks must go to Indre, whom really went way over & above the call of duty to ensure that our stay was outstanding, if not perfect; for which she deserves recognition & commendation & our appreciation is inordinate.
We recommend highly & can't what to return to this rather unique venue. 
Thank you so very much to everybody.

We were in London to choose our wedding rings and when we told Paris the Hotel Manageress she went out of her way to make our night that bit more special.

Will definitely be returning!,5,2015,03,31
132,"Hip, luxury but not pretentious","Sanderson has the feel of a quirky boutique hotel but with all the elegant service and professionalism of a luxury property. The rooms are lovely with divine beds that provided the best sleep I'd had in years. I was staying for 10 days so I'm not sure if this was standard but I had a bottle of wine my first evening (that was poured by the attendant that brought it up) and a little tray of desserts my final evening. The concierge was incredibly helpful in suggesting amazing places to dine and the desk staff was even kind enough to hunt down a power converter for me. The hotel features a super trendy bar (which I'm the very image of not trendy), but I never felt excluded like a lot of those environments would make you feel. The staff is simply incredible. Helpful, polite, friendly--I can't say enough good things about the people there. The whole experience felt so personalized.
Overall, the Sanderson is one of the best hotels I've ever visited and I look forward to staying there again the next time I'm in London.",5,2015,03,30
132,I love Morgan hotels!!,"It's always a great experience staying at a Morgan hotel. Service is always very good,  décor is always super modern & very different to other chains.
The Sanderson is one of my favourites. Great location, close to Soho, friendly service & a really cool bar.",5,2015,03,30
132,A very good stay,"The Sanderson hotel is a beautifully understated hotel with pops of quirky colour, furniture and glamour. 

At check in the reception staff are very friendly and very efficient.

The rooms are minimal and small but they designed to a very high standard in understated glamorous chic.  We loved it.

The bed is very comfortable although it felt small, I'm not sure why. It felt like a double rather than a queen which you usually get in a hotel. I couldn't say for sure. The pillows were amazingly comfortable. We slept very well.  The hotel is very central and is about 250 metres from Oxford street but it was surprisingly quiet to stay in.

The bathroom is walled in glass panels from floor to ceiling and then hidden behind white curtains that gives an ethereal feeling and disguises all of the Functional elements of the wardrobe and cupboard space and separates the bedroom. 

The bathroom is very high spec. The shower is lovely and powerful. There is no bath.

The hotel has a spa but on this occasion we did not use it.

The hotel has two bars. The long bar which as the name suggests is a very long bar. It is actually rectangular and you can sit all of the way around it. The bar appears to light itself through the marble and it glows white. It is adorned with gorgeous candelabras and it is centred between white curtains shielding the street and the hotel restaurants. 

The bar has an extensive cocktail menu and serves amazing cocktails. We had many whilst we were there. 

The only issue with this very cool bar is getting served and getting into it. There are no tables set aside for hotel guests paying £350 plus a night who clearly want to spend more money in this hotel. Priority is given on a first come first served basis which appears to be to mostly non paying guests looking for the cool factor by drinking at this cool bar. 

It seems to resolve this issue the Sanderson have created a second bar called the purple bar. This is purely for hotel guests. It's a beautiful bar and it really is a purple room. Even the ceiling is purple. It's very glamorous and cosy but it lacks any real atmosphere because there are very few people in it.  The staff are impeccable and they bend over back wards to serve you which is the opposite of the long bar but without the atmosphere it doesn't will you to stay in it. 

I think that the Sanderson could take some tips from their sister company the St Martins Lane hotel who accommodate their hotel guests in their equally trendy bar instantly.  

The hotel offers an afternoon tea.  The Mad-hatters afternoon tea.  We tried to book this a month out prior to our arrival. We were told that this was fully booked. We sat at the hotel bar late afternoon whilst they were serving afternoon tea. We saw many empty tables that were never filled. I think this is very disappointing.

We never ate in the hotel so we can't comment on that.

All in all this hotel is brilliantly situated. It's a gorgeous modern hotel dripping in quirkiness and glamour. The bar if you can get a chair at it is fabulous. The cocktails are delicious. The rooms gorgeously understated and we had a great nights sleep. Overall a very good hotel.

132,Nice enough,"This is a design driven hotel. The bedrooms and bathrooms are immaculately presented and have very
Modern design. External facade of hotel uninspiring and looks like an office.
The large bar in the lobby is popular but expensive.
The hotel is located just off Oxford Street which means the hotel is conveniently located to get to most places. There are a couple of stores closeby where you can stock up on drinks snacks that can avoids he minibar prices.",4,2015,03,27
132,London Trip,"The Sanderson was a very modern and fresh place that has a little bit of Alice in Wonderland magic about it. The service was amazing, the spa just breathtaking and super relaxing and the Mad Hatters High Tea is an experience not to be missed! We had a great trip with fantastic friendly service. Perfectly located for visitors wanting too see the London sights!!!",5,2015,03,27
132,Gr-r-reat!,"I've stayed here twice in the last year or so, most recently last autumn and would definitely recommend this hotel if you need somewhere central in the capital.

Most recently we stayed in the deluxe double which we thought might be a drop in quality and style having previously stayed in a suite, but we weren't disappointed. Despite the obvious reduction in square footage, the deluxe room still offered an abundance of luxury and elegance. We stayed for our wedding anniversary and the staff had lined the room with pretty tea lights, covered the bed with rose petals and also supplied a chilled bottle of bubbly – a wonderful touch. Breakfast was perfect too - all the fresh fruits and pastries you’d expect plus a bowl of Frosties – they’re gr-r-reat!

The rest of the hotel is filled with touches of coolness and fun – whether it’s the galaxy-inspired lifts or the lobby’s luscious lips sofa, these seemingly extravagant extras blend effortlessly into their fabulous surroundings.",5,2015,03,26

132,Unique,"Well thought design you'd expect from a Morgan hotel. The rooms are very slick and minimal. The staff are welcoming and warm.

The only slight downside is the Long Bar on a Saturday night which gets very lively.",5,2015,03,24
132,Birthday Night,"We had a night booked in the Sanderson for a birthday treat.  From the moment we arrived, we were in sheer luxury.  The receptionist was very friendly and helpful and we were even given an upgrade which was amazing!  Our room was slick, modern and impeccably clean, exactly what you expect from a hotel like the Sanderson, we had a spacious roof terrace too which meant we could relax before our evening ahead.
My other half used the housekeeping service to iron some shirts and they managed to get all three done and delivered back in 30 minutes!  What service.
The hotel is so well located for a night out in London and the breakfast room service made the whole event even more special.
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in London for a night, weekend or a week.",5,2015,03,24
132,Like Alice in Wonderland,"Quirky, friendly, comfortable and very well located. The staff are really exceptional. For example, we asked for a restaurant recommendation pre theatre. On our return we found  the book of the play with ha hand written note in our room. 

The long bar and the dining room are aesthetic wonders. The lobby chairs are one of a kind. 

We will go back.",5,2015,03,23
132,Still a beautiful hotel,"It is still a great hotel in a great location. However, the bar scene is no longer what it was, and the F&B service was well below par (with the exception of the purple bar). Dining options are extremely limited, perhaps encouraging guests to enjoy plentiful nearby facilities. Breakfast service, while offering excellent choice, was far too slow and understaffed to be viable for a business traveller. If this sounds like a bit of a negative review for four stars, then maybe I ought also to mention the exceptional, charming and helpful reception staff, the efficient and friendly door staff and the thoughtful staff in the purple bar. The gym was also extremely well stocked and at the time of visiting (6am) completely empty.",4,2015,03,23

132,"Very swanky, which can go either way","I had a great stay here. Was in town for business, and the location of this property can barely be beat if you're working anywhere near Soho square. 

The bed was comfy, the staff could not have been nicer, and the rooms are sleek, slickly designed, unique, and comfortable. They let me check in early, which was a lifesaver, as my flight got in at about 7 AM and I arrived at the hotel around 9 AM. They even treated me to a wonderful little dessert plate upon my arrival. 

Amenities were great, the TV was cool since you could watch Youtube on it if you were so inclined, and even little details like the super high quality of the towels and shampoo, body wash, etc added a ton to my experience. 

That said, there were a few things that were a bit disappointing. Firstly, as other reviewers have mentioned, this is definitely a place aimed at a certain crowd. On a Tuesday night I went to the bar downstairs to grab a very expensive but very delicious cocktail, and the entire long bar was populated with what looked like models and lots of dudes wearing Pharrell hats. Fine, who cares, but these folks weren't the quietest or most polite people in the world, and you could tell that that was wearing on the bar staff a bit. Not that I blame them, but if you're looking for a hotel-bar kind of vibe, you won't really find it as this is much more of a trendy club type vibe. Different strokes, but be aware.

The other issue I had was that of the housekeeping schedule, and how they would alert you to their presence. On two occasions I walked into my room at night to find a member of housekeeping there. They were doing their jobs diligently - no concern there - but it was definitely a bit disorienting and shocking to find someone in your room. In the US it's more common for housekeeping to prop the door open while they're going about their business in your room, but here the doors would be fully closed. Just a bit strange. 

Also, I was in the room once while they made their rounds, and while they did knock it was barely audible, and the time they waited after the knock was infinitesimal - had I been getting dressed or something, they would have walked right in on me. Not quite sure what to recommend here but it seems that a better system could be devised. 

Ultimately I had a very good stay here but I can't say it'll be at the top of my list for the next business trip I had. Maybe if I was in London for clubbing and partying, but for a more low-key trip I think I'll look elsewhere.",4,2015,03,20
132,Comfortable and stylish perch for a business trip,"Found the room to be quite spacious by London standards and the bed setup to be be very comfy and ideal for a bit of pre-bedtime TV viewing.  Requested a quiet room and I got just that.  The lighting in the hallways and elevator is quite moody but fine to navigate for a short visit.  The bar is a lovely spot for a meal and drink.  Staff very welcoming and friendly.  Loved the products and only wish I'd had a bathtub!  Didn't realize it was an option.

Perfect location for what I needed to accomplish on the trip and handy for a bit of extra-curricular shopping as well",5,2015,03,20

The bed was very comfortable but not sure the room styling was for us but great for one or two nights.  Hotel staff and the breakfast was superb.  The communal area's were really nice/quirky and interesting but the bar itself was far too busy, did not appear to be any preferential treatment for guests - we gave up on using it as we could not find anywhere to sit at the bar.

132,Perfect start for first trip to London,"From the first greeting to the last farewell the entire team at The Sanderson were great.   The room was light and airy.  Although I am a bit tired of the Philippe Starck ""look"" (SlS Beverly Hills, Sanderson...they all look alike...) the hotel was bright in the public spaces and rooms.  The guest halls are so dark that I am surprised that more single travelers dont complain from a safety standpoint.  Jose the Assistant Front Office Manager was extremely helpful in giving recommendations and setting up car services.  Karil (sp?) the evening bartender in the private purple bar was friendly and so accomodating.  This bar was a perfect get away from the loud party scene of the main bar.  The hotel was in a perfect walking location from great restaurants and sites.  Would definitely return.",5,2015,03,16

132,Great location and service close to Oxford Circus,"I usually stay at the Sanderson on business twice a year and this was another good stay.  I stayed in the a double bed room I reserved (I didn't get an upgrade to the king size room that I've gotten before) and the bed size definitely made a difference for me and my husband. Next time, I'll make sure to reserve a room with a larger bed.  
I love that this hotel is walking distance to Carnaby, Oxford and Regent Streets.  Although I had some out of the ordinary hiccups on this trip (taxi to airport not getting reserved, room safe malfunctioning with our passports and computers still inside), the staff is usually very helpful.

132,Mixed experience...,"I am in two minds about this hotel. On the one hand it is in an excellent location and most staff members were very friendly. On the other hand, the room tried too hard to be ""hip"" and interesting, with a negative impact on practicality. The hallways too were very dark.
The bar in the lobby is excellent: lots and lots of hip, beautiful young things if that is important to you :-)",3,2015,03,09

From the very pleasant doorman and effecient book staff to the spotlessly clean room(shower room was sparklingly clean !) 
Gorgeous bedding and comfortable bed resulted in a good nights sleep 
Only criticism was really was the room whilst well insulated against outside noise ,did suffer a little from corridor noise ,guests returning later than us at night we could hear their advance and passing by through our door .Wouldnt out us off statng again. 
The hotel is very funky and minimal ,which suits us but not perhaps the older generation or tourists expecting a trad London hotel ,
Standard rooms reminds us of New York modern hotels ;compact but well designed ,we lived the glass cube like shower room area,separated by voiles from the bed area .one minor comment on the design,the uber funky Philppe Starck type basin taps were impossible to turn on or off once you had soap on your hands -plus a lack of a plug in the design made wet  shaving hard work .

Didn't dine there but the bar was a great space for pre dinner drinks ,more an area for posing ratter than to get comfortable in,pricey cocktails but great 

Excellent in room breakfast service 

Strangely whilst the hotel has (130?) rooms it felt very comfortable more boutique in fact .A good area for shopping ,Regent /Oxford street et. 
We will be back ,next time for a romantic break !",4,2015,03,09
132,Business in London,"Friendly staff, service all round excellent, beautiful rooms, fabulous location. Nothing to much trouble. I need a suit pressing, pop to reception as I was in a rush, asked then to collect from my room, suit hanging in the cupboard. Not only did they collect and return on time but also pressed a shirt for me that I had forgotten to add to my list! now that's service.
No downside.

132,Excellent,"Fantastic all round experience, I will certainly be coming to stay again. Downstairs Bar had a great atmosphere and was busy most evenings.

Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, check in and out was a breeze. 

One of the best hotels i have stayed in.
              
              
              
              ",5,2015,03,07
132,Loved this hotel!!,"Let me start with the very friendly doorman. We arrived quite early and assumed we would have to leave our luggage at the desk, but they already had a room ready for us. Our bags were brought up to our room and the doorman was giving us helpful information on things we may be interested in. In the lobby there is the long bar. The two bartenders I encountered made excellent drinks. There is an eatery there as well. I was good, not great. The purple bar is fantastic!! Very intimate. The bartender we had the first night in there made some drinks for us that I could possibly live on. I will post pictures later. He has traveled the world bartending. 
The room....I was impressed. The bed was super comfy, the bathroom was all glass, the walls, the shelves, the counters....I want to have one in my home like that! The mini bar was stuffed for our pleasure, just be aware of the price tag for each item. Americans will get a shock. You could not hear any outside noise from the hallway or from the street below. It is a very popular spot for drinks and music on the weekends, so be prepared for a young hip type crowd. I would return to this hotel although the price is quite a splurge.",5,2015,03,06
132,One of the best,"I'm a regular customer of The Morgans Hotel Group and, in particular, The St Martins Lane and i always loved to stay at their hotels. I decided to try the Sanderson and i was more than happy of my choice. Everything was great. The room, the food, the beautiful spa and the staff. Everyone was lovely with us.",5,2015,03,04
132,Thank you!,"After recently stopping at another hotel in the Morgans hotel chain, St Martins Lane, there was no question of where to go next. We booked the romance package and we weren't dissapointed! The room set up was sensational! After enjoying a glass of champagne in the room, we headed down to the hotel bar and were spoilt for choice! Not only that the drinks were arguably the best on London for the price and despite it being busy the service was excellent! We booked a meal in the hotel for he evening and this us is a must! Because of the weather we were able to sit outside and because of the tranquil water feature and candle lit lamps the experience was truly memorable, and the good made it that extra bit special. Speaking of special you have to try the mad hatters tea party! The flavours were a true experience and it was exceptional value for money! I must add this is also where I got engaged to my fiancée so this hotel will always have a special place on my heart. ",5,2015,03,04
132,Back again..,"Sorry but my review didn't load back then so here it is. I returned and ended up staying for most of the Summer last year. As a long term stayer you get to see a hotel warts and all and also experience a bit of its soul. I can't complain. Sure there were IT problems and the telly service had a mind of its own. But those matters were rectified eventually and with managements oversight and care.

The vibe of this hotel are uplifting. The staff in all areas do go that extra yard to make you feel welcome and do genuinely care if you are having an off day. From front door thru reception, house keeping, room service and of course the Long Bar - everyone made me feel at home from home and more than met my expectations.

I'm back again, again.. and just received a truly warm welcome from the team here. It feels good to be back. ",5,2015,03,03
132,Beautiful!,"This boutique hotel was truly outstanding. Service was amazing and the bar was buzzing with life. The rooms were unique and facilities we're great. Staff were helpful and polite. My only criticism has to be some of the hotel guests who were rude to the receptionists. They delivered impeccable service and should always be spoken to with respect. It's a shame the hotel attracts this sort of clientele. However, everything else was perfect.",5,2015,03,02
132,Still one of the best in London,"Great for people watching at the Long Bar and just a few minutes walk to all the best restuarants and shops....ate at the hotel a couple of evenings and could not fault the food...rooms were large and the beds were extremely comfortable

132,"Fresh, surprising, innovative.","It was a pleasure staying at Sanderson. The design surprised me in a most positive way. Service was excellent. I can freely say that Sanderson is a face of modern , fresh and innovative London as oposition to the traditional one.",5,2015,03,01
132,Great Hotel - Inconvienient Location,Amazing Philip Stark design - over the top spa - ultra modern room decor - but located in a mixed commercial/residential neighborhood far from a tube stop or any bars/restaurants.  I ordered a Hendricks and tonic at the bar and the bill with VAT and tip was $24.  Ouch!,3,2015,02,28
132,"Good Hotel, great location","The location of the hotel is top notch and you can go anywhere in London rather quickly.  Food and service is top notch.  Only minor issue is that it is so dark in the hallways to get to the rooms that you can barely see where you are going.  Wouldn't preclude me from staying there again, just would make sure to get my flashlight out.  ",4,2015,02,27
132,Lovely,"I stayed at the Sanderson London for 10 days initially and had to go back on my return trip. It's elegant. The staff were polite and charming. It's a simple luxury hotel that keeps the normal fuss to a minimum. The menu is good but doesn't have  wide spread. It's just off Tottenham Court Road so right in Central London. Overall, I'd go back there over and over again.",4,2015,02,27
132,Excellent service,Hotel staff are very friendly and efficient! Go out of there way to assist you and make your stay pleasant! The rooms are very clean and was upgraded to a suite with a bath that l enjoy while away. Room service quality was very good delivered in a timely manner and hot!,4,2015,02,26
132,Wonderful stay,"We just spent a week at the Sanderson and we were very impressed with the hotel. The location was excellent. It is in a vibrant neighborhood with  many great restaurants and shops. The concierges, Henrik and Joey , were so helpful with restaurant recommendations and general tourist information. Our room was spacious as well as the bathroom. Looking forward to returning on our next trip to London.",5,2015,02,26
132,Amazing time at London Fashion Week,"I was a concierge at the W Hotel in Seattle for 8 years, so I know a bit about service.  This was a great stay.  I have NO complaints.  All the amenities were amazing.  Phillipe Starck room was super.  Steven Rojas, my contact at Morgan's, really made it happen!  Thank you to everyone at the Sanderson London!",5,2015,02,25
132,Quality all around. Good people. ,"Excellent service and hospitality with a genuine smile. @Ebi, Ruth and Matt. Thank you. 
Clean rooms. Prompt service. Quiet inside, though in the middle of London. 
A lot of space in the gym with new equipment and a lot of variety.
The elevators are out of this world too. ",5,2015,02,25
132,I would return,"We booked The Sanderson because we wanted to be near Soho, but we didn't want to pay Ham Yard prices this time. The location was indeed excellent for all things Soho and central and the value for money was good for several reasons. It was also handy for Bloomsbury.

The most impressive thing about The Sanderson is the staff. Staff at the entrance and the check in desk were the perfect mix of polite and friendly and were great at making thoughtful suggestions, such as would we like a bottle of water to take with us on our journey home. The bar staff were also very kind, but the breakfast staff seemed a little sparse.

Our room was big enough and had a light and airy feel due to the use of thin white curtains instead of inner walls. Beds were noticeably good to sleep in. Sockets, chargers, shelves and places to hang coats were all very well placed and the design seemed well thought through. This functional but elegant vibe continued through out the other spaces in the hotel. I loved the groovy lifts with their intergalactic wall decor!

There were two very fine bars. The long bar seemed popular but there was always space there. The residents bar, in purple hues, was open til 3 am so no problem getting a nightcap. The cocktails both places were pleasant.

I would like to do it all again.",5,2015,02,24
132,Fabulous stay,"Where do I start? Gorgeous place. The hotel staff is lovely. Especially Paris this lovely lady at front desk. so accommodating. The stay was great as I stayed here for a week for business. Comfortable beds. Great bathroom
Loved the place and the great thoughtful staff.

Thank you Dagma for helping us with rooms.",5,2015,02,19
132,Redeemed themselves,"Stayed here for one while in town to celebrate my sons 18th birthday. purely because the hotel is quite funky. They offered us an upgrade to the penthouse suite Like many others but my offer was Five hundred pounds  

The rooms are very contemporary but could not understand why in my room it only had two electrical sockets (that I Could find) and shaver point that was two foot up a wall that was the ten feet from the basin (VERY PRACTICAL NOT)

We went out for a walk round town and on our return my wife fancied tea and cake but could we get it no the excuse being that it was Valentines day and people were having the mad hatters tea.
We did eventually get the to proved some cookies but that took an age to come.

Early evening we met in reception and as the long bar was busy we decided to use the purple bar which is for residences on entering noticed that tables had been reserved WHY I'm a guest the bar should be big enough to accommodate all its guests but you would be lucky to  get twenty in the place . However they did let us sit and have a pre-dinner drink but did not feel that we were welcome.

We went out for dinner and on our return were met by doormen that not to be too blunt reminded me of Nightclub Bouncers as two were wearing name tags with long black overcoats anyway retired to bed 

The sleep I had that was interrupt three times by noisy guests returning to their rooms shouting and laughing (WHY DO PEOPLE DO THAT I'M SURE THAT IF IT WAS THE OTHERWAY ROUND THEY WOULD BE UP IN ARMS ABOUT IT)

In the morning we met for breakfast and  shown to our table order our food and then waited for about 30 minutes. Eventually when it did come two dishes were cold one tepid the mine was hot.
Again the excuse came that they were busy but there were only twenty people in the restaurant.

THE GOOD THING WAS THAT ON COMPLAINING TO RECEPTION ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCE THEY DID APOLOGIES AND COMPENSATE US ( BUT AGAIN THE EXCUSE CAME ABOUT IT BEING VALENTINES WEEKEND ) AT A FIVE STAR HOTEL THATS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE EXCUSE THO

Would I be returning probably not as there a far better hotels in LONDON that what ever the circumstances would provide the service that I expect whatever the special event was happening that weekend",3,2015,02,18
132,Best valentines ever!!!,I booked a king deluxe room... On arrival I was offered the PENTHOUSE for about £150 more which I declined... But then was given the upgrade for free!!! What an amazing hotel very generous!! The penthouse was incredible I really appreciate that they gave me a weekend I will remember forever!! ️Xxx ,5,2015,02,17
132,Another Wonderful Stay!,"Friends of mine had advised me that they were going to London to purchase their wedding rings.   
I had not bought them an engagement present so thought this would be a great opportunity to treat them.

I emailed the Hotel and advised that the booking was a special occasion and I quickly received an email back from Paris one of the hotel managers stating that she would like to personally welcome us at the hotel and look after our stay. 

On arrival we were greeted by Paris who upgraded our rooms to Loft rooms. Although all the rooms at this hotel are amazing, these rooms were huge! They must be some of the best rooms available in London. 
We had lots of drinks at the lively Long bar and some more at the purple bar. 
This hotel is great as you can eat and go out all inside the hotel, also everything in central London is so close by!

Later in the night my friends were thrilled to find that rose petals had been spread all over their bed and complimentary champagne had been put in the room, and I was even more surprised to find the same had been done in our room! 

I have stayed at this hotel a number of times before but never taken the breakfast there. It has to be one of the best hotel breakfasts i have ever had! It was so good I only wish I lived close to the hotel so I could go there every week for Breakfast! 

This is definitely our favourite hotel in London and we will be back very soon!",5,2015,02,16
132,Amazing!,"Ive been to the bar many a time but never stayed.

Hotel room was amazing, thats all i can say! Such style and minimal elegance and class. Stunning!

Just stay here if you get the chance.

I will be back.",5,2015,02,14
132,Great location! Great Hotel! Great staff!,"This hotel was wonderful from the second we stepped through the door to the second we left. It was a birthday weekend and 8 of us stayed at the hotel, which was AMAZING! The staff were polite and helpful from the moment we arrived, supplying a last minute private room at the bar for us, a cake sent up to the room etc.

The rooms are modern and in great condition, bed are comfy, showers are powerful, and the toiletries are divine.

The breakfast if not ordered as part of the room is very pricey (£20 for a simple buffet spread) but otherwise I would recommend to anyone.

If its a special occasion the bar is busy and buzzing with guests and non-guests so perfect place to start the night, there are clubs and restaurants all within walking distance, and the next day you are right on Oxford St for some retail therapy. Soho, Covent Garden are all within easy reach.

A* - thank you for everything.",5,2015,02,10
132,30th Birthday Weekend,"My husband and I booked ourselves and my parents in for my 30th Birthday weekend. We wanted somewhere really central and the Sandersons location is perfect. 

As soon as we arrived we were treated to a complimentary upgrade  which was great and we loved the champagne and cake in the room to help get the celebrations under way, really nice touch.

I booked myself for a Spa package and have to say this was the best decision of the whole weekend for me, all the staff were hugely welcoming and the therapist who did my massage and facial was amazing (can't remember his name sorry!) I was also given a glass of champers, some strawberries and more cake so was pretty much in heaven for 2 and a bit hours. The spa is very peaceful and tranquil.

We later spent the evening at the Long Bar and Purple Bar - both do amazing cocktails but the Purple Bar is more money for the same drinks. Loved the vibe in the hotel bars and the pool table area is a good space to spend time with friends.

I really liked the design of the hotel and found all the staff to be so helpful. I was initially worried that my parents may not like the hotel as it is quite modern but they loved it as much as we did!

",5,2015,02,09
132,Wonderful visit,"A repeat visit for a special occasion, was made even better by the excellent, helpful and 
attentive staff, who could not have made us more welcome. Reception particularly good.
Great room with upgrade, champagne and rose petals on bed!
Delicious breakfast and lunch. Modern hotel, which always has a good atmosphere.
Quick valet parking with a smile
Would not want to stay anywhere else.",5,2015,02,08
132,Birthday weekend fantastic hotel,"We stayed at the Sanderson hotel, just off Oxford street, for my birthday weekend. The hotel foyer is funky, relaxing and fresh. The reception staff were very welcoming and they even gave us a room upgrade, to try out one of their newly decorated rooms. There are so many different features of this hotel that I loved: the residents only bar, plush and decorated in purple velour, the barman was super friendly and very attentive without being 'in your face'; the lifts were really funky; the atmosphere in the Long bar was buzzing and a DJ was playing on the late Friday evening; we had a tour of the spa, which looked so amazing with drapes creating a really intimate yet welcoming atmosphere. If you have the time, book yourself in for Afternoon tea,  it's one of the best I've had and it has a quirky Alice in Wonderland theme, a lot of fun. The room itself was amazing, so large and a real contemporary look and feel. The window blinds were really well designed. I discovered that the previous occupant of the room had taken some items from the mini bar,  I reportedit and they were replaced straight away, with no hassle. The breakfast the next morning was just ad good as the rest of the hotel services. It's such a great location too, in easy walking distance of most points of interest and of course the tube. Would definitely stay again.",5,2015,02,08
132,Trendy but overrated,"Amazing location and good service
Restaurant has unique menu and tasty selection
Bar is somewhat overrated
Rooms are nice but given the small size expected of a boutique style hotel, I expect a bit more luxury or trendy decour",4,2015,02,08
132,Love this hotel !,"I stay at the Sanderson a few times a year for business and I always enjoy my stay there. The location is excellent for shopping and being very central, makes getting around easy and convenient. The accommodations are clean and efficient. The décor is cool and inspiring. The staff are all professional and amicable but special callout to Giuseppe from room service - he was helpful and accommodating. I recommend this hotel to anyone needing central, clean and cool place in London.",5,2015,02,06
132,Thank you Agua Spa!,"I curate interesting and unique experiences for Londoners and visitors to the city.  We recently sent a couple to Agua Spa for a couples massage as part of their ""London weekend experience"" and the staff at Agua Spa was amazing.  They took great care of the couple and even offered to provide them with complimentary champagne and a cupcake after their treatments as it was the husband's birthday.  They were very friendly and easy to book with, and were quick to follow up to all of my emails and queries.  I really appreciate their help making this experience so special.  Will definitely be back there myself!",5,2015,02,04

Located in a nice area. Very friendly staff, especially Ebi, Jose, Matt and Ruth at the reception desk!

Will definetely come back!",5,2015,02,02
132,trendy and convenient,"Considering high hotel prices in London this offers great value: excellent location, affordable, modern, trendy and very clean and even 'roomy' rooms. Finally a hotel which has usb sockets in the wall for iphone, ipad and all. A real surprise: excellent soap, conditioner, shampoo etc. 
Breakfast, as every else: prohibitively expensive!",5,2015,02,02
132,Brilliant Birthday!,"Booked this hotel as a surprise for my wife's birthday, my wife would always choose tradition over contemporary but hasn't stopped talking about how great the hotel was. The hotel is in a fantastic location near Oxford St. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a ""loft room"" and were not disappointed -It was huge. The staff were excellent and really made an effort to make our stay special. A lively cocktail bar that was open late meant it was the perfect hotel for us thirty something's to forget about the children for a night or two. If anyone from the hotel reads this review. Thank you very much and see you soon.",5,2015,02,01
132,Fantastic birthday treat for my husband,"We stayed at the sanderson last night 31st jan 2015 , i booked it a month ago as a surprise for my husbands 40th birthday and also our wedding anniversary we have 6 children and only get 1 night away a year so wanted it to be something special last year we stayed at ME london and really thought that would be hard to beat but was wrong !!

132,Surprise booking -50th Birthday Celebration,"Even though we live in London ,I booked 1 x night in the sandeson on the 22nd January as a surprise for my Boyfriends 50th Birthday , as I had a night out planned in the West end.I had emailed the hotel advance to let them know it was a special occassion and I recieved a reply , that it had been acknowledged and that it would be ensured that the stay was made special; and it certainly was ! ....

On arrival at the hotel , the doorman showed us into the bar area.I went up to the host to let him know of our arrival , as a table had been booked , but we actually chose to sit at the long bar (always wanted to have a drink there) I mentioned we were guests but would not book in until after drinks as not to ruin the surprise. I was then asked to give the nod to the host , whom kindly arranged some cake and candles on a board with Happy 50th birthday written on. It was a lovely gusture. I then pretended to go to the bathroom and went to check in. I stood at the desk and beckoned the member of staff over (as so I couldnt been seen form the bar) The lovely ""JJ"" aided me to check in swiftly , as so I could put the key card into a birthday card. He informed me that we had been upgraded to an amazing room with a terrace , from a deluxe room ,as he had seen the email that it was a special occassion. He then said he would organise something in the room for the  birthday guest. Our room (606) was more than amazing and the upgrade really did make it so special for us with the terrace and stand alone bath .10 minutes into being in the room , room service brought in a complementry bottle of champagne in an ice bucket and more cake . The open plan room was lovely and the bed , well it was the best bed I had ever slept in , the pillows and bedding was so luxurious. I have to say the whole experience at the Sanderson was fantastic , and truely made special by the wonderful staff and service provided . A special big THANK YOU to JJ for making the room choice so special. ......

A week on and we are still buzzing from our amazing stay at the Sanderson.We hope to return to make use of the spa and long bar again in the future.",5,2015,01,29
132,The best home away from home !,"Stayed for a week of business travel on January 2015, the hotel design is unique with a lot of style and good taste.
The room was large, clean, well maintained, and designed beautifully.
Breakfast was very good, the front desk staff was very nice and helpful - late checkout  was approved without any problems.",5,2015,01,28
132,wonderful hotel,"we stayed at the Sanderson for one night following recommendation.the hotel is in a great location close to all that London has to offer. the reception area is stunning and very designer led and different but in  a good way.the room was huge with a super large and comfy bed.took us a wile to work out some of the lighting options.for a central London hotel the superior room was by far the largest in size we have stayed in .we went to the long bar in the evening and watched all the beautiful people.the atmosphere was great, a real mix of people.
we had the full breakfast the next morning which was probably the best i have ever had.
all the staff we encountered at the hotel from the door man to waiter/reception were all very professional and efficient.
can we please say a special mention to paris the guest relations manager for making our stay so special as it was a special anniversary the hotel left champagne in the room on the house such a nice touch and very much appreciated.we have stayed in many top 5 star hotels over the years in London but we will return to the Sanderson on our next visit without hesitation",5,2015,01,27
132,Good but nothing special,"Stayed here a few times now as it's very close to the BBC HQ but have to admit the place just doesn't do it for me.  Sure, it brings all the good things one would expect from a quality hotel but let's face it; the lobby is a strange mixture of modern art, the elevators are weird, the bar area is too sterile and the restaurant serves so-so food and you either sit inside in a dark environment with loud music or in the (heated) area outside which really is a drafty tent.  The doormen are too busy chatting with the girls at the bar or reception.  Nope, I'll find another hotel next time.",3,2015,01,26
132,Amazone stay,"Our Sanderson experience started with an amazing upgrade! Can't describe it with words. I have never seen such a huge hotel room in a city like London. It turned out that we got the Penthouse suite. A lovely place, well designed. Although a lot of my facination is related to this incredible suite, the rest of the hotel is good enough to be rated with ""extra class "": nice people at the reception, great service, cool interior design.",5,2015,01,24
132,Best spa in London,"The aqua spa at the Sanderson is the most glorious environment to spend time in.  The double-height floor space and use of billowing white fabric instead of solid walls was a stroke of genius.  The atmosphere is calm and peaceful - the only sound being the soft tumble of water in the central fountain. The staff are, without exception, delightful and do everything they can to make the experience special.",5,2015,01,21
132,Always Fantastic!,"We love visiting The Sanderson! The service is always excellent, staff are consistantly wonderful and really can't do enough for you. Rooms are beautiful, especially the Loft Rooms with balcony they are something special! The Long bar has a great atmosphere and really great cocktails! The hotel is quirky and the beds are super comfy! Always look forward to going back.",5,2015,01,20
132,Style vs Substance?,"We booked a room for a special birthday, and we were looking forward to seeing inside this familiar landmark. You enter an enormous lobby, quite an open expanse to cross to reach reception counter. The theme seems to be gauze, glass and chrome. Friendly, helpful staff booked us in, and took our cases as we had an appointment to keep. When we returned we went up to our room, which was apparently fairly newly refurbished. The lifts have a ""lost in space"" theme; very glossy, but an irritating chatter of percussion from the Muzak. The corridors were very gloomy, though the floor level lighting was very stylish.  The room (290) was a reasonable size, with wood floor in the main part, covered with a thick rug. The shower room had stone flooring which was weather marked and grubby, with splashes and footprints: very disappointing. The lighting was quite complex, it always took several guesses to set things as we wanted. We had to request tea/coffee making facilities, though they arrived briskly. The bed was big and extremely comfortable with fine Egyptian cotton bed linen, the location is quite quiet, and we could blackout the windows with both Venetian and roller blinds, so the sleeping environment was good. We had room service, both for breakfast (bacon rolls, small but adequate, and coffee: absolute best hotel breakfast coffee ever), and tea for four, which came as teabags and a pot of hot water.  Shower was another complex bit of kit, but plentiful hot water once decoded. All the interior walls were glass, and the gaps on the bathroom doors were huge. The acoustics were very echoic. There was a well stocked minibar, and a variety of ""travellers' requirements"", all at additional cost, of course. Is of us met for drinks in the Long Bar, brisk service, and rather noisy Muzak. 
We enjoyed our stay, however.",4,2015,01,19
132,AMAZING!,"I recently stayed at The Sanderson with my boyfriend for his birthday and were blown away!
We were lucky enough to be upgraded to one of the suites which was amazing and the special birthday desert which was left in our room was an added surprise and one we were touched by.

Throughout our stay the staff were extremely friendly and we were made to feel very welcome. We had lunch at the Long Bar which was really good and the food to a high standard.  Later we were joined by friends for drinks and the bar had a great buzz and everyone was well looked after.  The breakfast the next day was also an extra treat and were pleased as this was needed!

Overall, I cannot fault our stay and my boyfriend had an AMAZING birthday and one he will never forget thanks to everyone at the hotel.  Cannot wait to go back and would highly recommend this hotel to all my friends and family.",5,2015,01,19
132,Really friendly,"We stayed last year at the same time and we were recognised by some of the staff which was a nice touch.Although we got there about 11:30 am our rooms were available which is unusual but great as we could happily get on with our day.All the staff are helpful nothing seems too much trouble ,the bar area is fun and buzzing the rooms are very modern and funky very big beds and comfortable ,breakfast was really good and again the staff were excellent .We will be back again next year if not before.Thank you.",5,2015,01,16
132,Perfect Stay.,"
Had the most incredible weekend in the penthouse/terrace suite. The staff were all so attentive and friendly from before you even step through the door (lovely, friendly doormen). This is the best suite and absolutely beautiful- would be even more so in the summer. All our specific requests were catered to. Room service excellent, cars arranged for us as and when we needed. Enjoyed a spa treatment and have to recommend Jonathan for a massage (one of the best I've ever had and really puts you at ease). The spa arranged a private room for myself and my partner too which was lovely and the whole experience was second to none. The Long Bar, as usual was very busy, but we were served quickly and well looked after. Overall, a fantastic stay at a beautiful, chic, and well staffed hotel. Would your girlfriend love this hotel? Absolutely. A great start to the year, and hope to return soon.

132,Wonderful Experience and Awesome Customer Service,"I booked this hotel as a gift for my brother in law and my sister for his 50th birthday.  It was an expensive gift even though I booked this through a discount site but having read reviews and looked at the pictures - I thought this would be a lovely experience for them as a treat for a special birthday. 

I emailed the hotel to tell them it was a special occasion and was delighted with the response.  I had a response from both Nigel and Paris and between them they arranged an upgrade for my guests and offered to put a bottle of champagne in their room. I thought that was extremely generous.

My brother in law and sister were absolutely blown away by the experience - they said that everything was perfect from start to finish. They loved the quirky style of the whole hotel and the attention they received was excellent. 

I wanted to say a huge huge thank you to the team at the Sanderson for looking after them so well and making the 50th birthday so special.  The birthday cake with the champagne was a lovely touch. 

Thank you guys xxx",5,2015,01,11
132,Average,"The Sanderson is a very unique hotel. Personally the random designs in the rooms and the lobby took a while to get used to. Upon arrival, the guy at the check-in desk assumed I was sharing a room with my friend who had card problems trying to pay for his room and thus just blatantly ignored me. The Sanderson Hotel offers extremely large comfortable beds, probably the best I've ever slept in. The breakfast is good and the service is decent. However, the penthouse is substandard compared to other hotels. The standard rooms are but cramped. All in all conclusion, there are many better 5star hotels. Sanderson just isn't value for money. ",3,2015,01,07
132,Excellent stay,"We stayed again at the Sanderson on 19th of December for 2 nights, we had stayed in June 2014 for the first time and had gone onto recommend friends to go, ourselves and friends all received the same high level of service in all areas. Standards had not slipped. Highly recommend this hotel for great location, great staff, good food, excellent bar. One of the best London Hotels.",5,2015,01,07
132,Beautiful hotel with beautiful people!,"After being on my wish list of hotels for a while now we decided  to celebrate our wedding anniversary at the sanderson ! Now were normal people with 3 young children and unfortunately this has to be a luxury rather than something we can do every weekend ! Having said that I would sooner save and come somewhere that really is a taste of luxury than go home from home ! 
This hotel did not disappoint we visited the sister hotel some yrs ago (st martins lane ) and I would say this topped that ! We got a complimentary upgrade as it was a special occasion and had breakfast thrown in too ! Now I have to say It would have been worth the  money even  if we had to pay as it was the most amazing breakfast I've had in my whole life so to know we got it complimentary was just even better ! The room was gorgeous we had a bottle of wine left for us :) basically the hotel did everything in it's power to make sure our stay was special ! The staff were all as beautiful as the surroundings and I'm quite sure that was intended !  If u like the finer things in life and want to feel special I'd defo recommend ! Already hoping to go back for my birthday just got to start saving ;) thank you sanderson",5,2015,01,05
132,fabulous,"took my 3 children here for one night as a treat during October half term and it really was a treat. Friendly and helpful staff, wonderful rooms, great location. Would be back like a shot when finances allow.",5,2015,01,05
132,Style with Substance,"This was our second visit to the Sanderson. The first was September this year. This time we came with our children. Like us, the children also enjoyed the style statement the hotel makes with its iconic decor. The rooms exude a serene elegance that is contrasted by the excitement and sophistication of the Long Bar. The hotel staff were all very welcoming and service was faultless.  We could not appreciate the good location of the hotel on our previous visit as we caught taxis everywhere but during this stay it was easier for the six of us to walk. Oxford Street is a two minute walk away. Soho and  Leicester Square just another five minutes walk. Thanks for another memorable stay.",5,2015,01,03
132,Amazing hotel!,"From the decor to the service, everything is a complete wow! Location is also excellent. Go ahead and book. You will not be disappointed.

Special mention for Emily, the concierge who was super helpful and helped us organise a fantastic NYE celebration at the last minute. Brilliant! The hotel is lucky to have her! :)",5,2015,01,02
132,Eclectic decor - excellent service,"I enjoyed my stay at Sanderson so much! I was there for a week and they put me in a very quiet room at the end of the hall. Amenities were excellent and the staff was very friendly. After a redeye flight they offered to let me go up to the spa to shower and freshen up before my room was even available for check in. That's a very nice thing to have running on no sleep! The room was very spacious - I especially liked the blackout curtains (for jetlag adjustments). One thing is you have to call down to request coffee and tea service, but once I did that one they refreshed the service each day. Wifi was free in the room, was great for emails and reading news. Overall a wonderful experience and if I get the chance I'd love to go back.",5,2014,12,31
132,Still top bar and hotel in london!,"I am coming here for more than ten years. The hotel lost a bit of its glamour but still the rooms, design, lobby service and the bar are Amazing. Always buzzing and beautiful people at the bar and restaurant. The food overhere is always of a good quality. The prices are high but what do you expect in a 5star hotel in London. ",5,2014,12,31
132,Great Experience,"I recently had a weekend at the Sanderson. The drinks and service at the long bar were fantastic, bar staff really helpful.

The rooms are refurbished to a high standard, comfortable, great design, very functional.

A unique and enjoyable experience",5,2014,12,30
132,Home away from home!,"I get to London frequently and I always stay at the Sanderson.  It's become my home away from home in London. I was just there from December 17 to the 19th. The entire staff is awesome...Door guys, Front desk, Bar staff, Restaurant staff, and Housekeeping.......AMAZING!  Right off Oxford St, Sanderson gives you access to multiple Tube lines, great restaurants in the Soho area, and shopping for BLOCKS! I definitely like the new room upgrades, which warms up the modern décor in the room.  If you like a hotel with a great staff, energy, modern décor, and warmth, this is the place to stay.  I'll see the Sanderson in April, June for Wimbledon, and September.  Can't wait to get back!

Have a great New Year Sanderson!

132,Great hotel,"Booked for two nights to treat my wife. Absolutely fantastic stay, really highly recommend. Long bar was great on both nights, well worth coming back to. Very nice room with everything you need, very quiet. Location is perfect for any need. ",5,2014,12,30
132,Outstanding service,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the sandersons for two nights and had a wonderful experience. All the staff at the hotel are exceptionally hospitable.. I would like to thank Nigel Gardiner in particular for going out of his way for us. 
The private bar will make you some lovely cocktails. We also treated ourselves to afternoon tea which is renown in London. 
The room itself was spacious, that was filled with all the latest mod-cons you don't find in many hotels. The contemporary design was one to admire. 
The location was perfect, you can get to one of many top restaurants and shops in London by walking.
I would most definitely use the sandersons again",5,2014,12,29
132,Very Nice Hotel,"We chose this hotel due to the good reviews it had and location. Yes!, the reviews were right. Hotel staff were very pleasant and very helpful to our individual needs and requests. Location to Oxford street was perfect. Only two mins away. Rooms were very clean, modern and futuristic (bathroom a bit too modern and open plan for me). However, cannot say anything negative about the rooms save to say, the television could of been better placed in front of the BIG bed rather than on the side giving a side view. All in all, the hotel was fantastic, relaxed atmosphere and the staff really do justice for this top quality hotel. Would definitely visit again.",5,2014,12,28
132,Brilliant stay,"Stunning hotel, a real modern classic. Calm, funky and luxurious. We enjoyed two fabulous nights this December which really made our stay in London. Love the long bar, stylish and great professional service. The rooms are awesome, great beds, quiet, spacious and beautiful bedding. Thank you, we'll be back.",5,2014,12,28
132,Lovely hotel,Lovely trendy hotel and a perfect location for shopping! Lovely staff who were most helpful. Nice breakfast but a little pricey. The only downside for me was the bathroom was a little too open plan…. not much privacy but other than that the room was lovely :),4,2014,12,28
132,Luxurious Christmas,"We visited Sanderson on Christmas for two nights with my partner. We stayed there for two nights and we absolutely enjoyed it.

Although the whole concept is a little bit 90's the atmosphere and the whole experience has been really relaxing and luxurious.

After a warm welcome from the reception staff we were shown to our room.
Surprised that we would have a bathtub for ourselves in a standard room we indulged ourselves in the big bed and found almost everything we needed in the room.

The only disappointing thing (with allthe bug hotels to be honest) is the fact that you have to pay for your wifi access which makes it very difficult even for people lime us that live in the same city and we have our own carriers. In order to watch a movie on your ipad you have to pay 10£ for a 24 hours service. I suppose I am not cheap but when you pay so much wifi is kind of a basic service. Again,though as i said its a common thing in all hotels.

The service was fast,prompt and very friendly. Even when our drinks at the lobby bar took some time to come,Nigel,the shift manager apologised himself and offered us complimentary drinks for the day after.

Breakfast was delicious with Gambi being very friendly,smiling and willing to bring us all we needed.

JJ and the rest of the staff at the reception were there for us when asked really helpful.

We would definitely go back and give ourselves a luxurious treatment.

Hopefully soon
",4,2014,12,26
132,Definitely go back!,"Booked a room here just for one night for my boyfriends 21st birthday. It was more than I had expected, the entrance is very modern and inviting, as are the staff on reception. They were so friendly and helpful and the lift is the best lift I've ever been in. The location is perfect, about a two minute walk from Oxford Street. The room is absolutely stunning, I always judge a hotel room by it's bathroom and this did not disappoint. The bed was also extremely comfortable. The only down side I have (which is completely superficial and unnecessary) is that there are lots of mirrors in the room but no plugs near them. I had to curl my hair through my laptop webcam but, obviously, that wouldn't stop me going back again. I will definitely recommend to friends.",5,2014,12,22
132,nice,"the hotel is very nice, spoons restaurant is outstanding, food is excellent, service is good, even their menu is different, the seating area is magnificient specially the outdoor area, good for special occasion. expensive but worth it.",5,2014,12,19
132,ANOTHER STELLAR STAY AT THE SANDERSON,"Was in London for work for a few days and opted to stay once again at the Sanderson. So glad I did.  Their service is always excellent, especially the concierge staff.  They have a great gym and spa to decompress after a long flight or for a good work out.  They upgraded me to a terrace room, absolutely stunning and LOVED it.  Very quiet, great light, and very private.  I always love to grab a drink at the Purple Bar and Raphael was fantastic, super personable and a great staff member.",5,2014,12,19
132,Birthday weekend at the Sanderson.,"My girlfriend surprised me with a trip to the Sanderson for my Birthday and we both thought the place was amazing. My girlfriend had e-mailed the hotel prior to our arrival to see if they could do anything special because it was my birthday. Upon arrival we were told the fantastic news that we were being upgraded to a loft apartment room and also there was a bottle of champagne and cupcakes for us in the room! 
The room itself was like no hotel room I've stayed in before, it was all open plan with a huge bed in the middle and just a kind of glass partition dividing the bathroom area which had a massive stand alone bath in it.
As for the hotel itself it has a very cool, modern feel to it with lots of different quirky pieces of furniture dotted about the place. The long bar is a great place to hang out for a few cocktails and to mingle with a cool crowd however be prepared to pay high end London prices (bottle of water was £5!). There is also the purple bar which is a lot smaller and gets busy at night so you might not get space space for a table to sit at. Also there is nice lounge area with a pool table which is overlooked by a massive stained glass window and a spiral staircase that takes you up to the first floor.
Overall, a really classy, cool place but be prepared to pay more than normal for this.",5,2014,12,19
132,Excellent  Morgan property,Excellent  Morgan property with newly renovated rooms .Very spacious rooms and quite nicely decorated. Very cool lobby bar with tons of room. The staff is exceptionally cordial. The location is also good next to great clubs and restearunts.,4,2014,12,18
132,Amazing Customer Service,"Stayed here 4 nights before heading to Belgium for the white sensations party and the staff were absolutely ON POINT the spa was great and the the Purple bar out of this world!! would highly recommend staying at this property anytime your in London, The concierge helped me extend my flight and was very Knowledgeable of the surroundings.",5,2014,12,17
132,Oasis of calm with a funky upbeat vibe,"Stayed here with hubby whilst we both attended our respective office Xmas parties. Check in was effortless and loved the decor in the lifts :-)
Room spacious for a central London hotel and liked the curtains and mood lighting. Bed was very comfy, lots of room in bathroom / dressing area. Only small downside is whilst there is a huge mirror for getting ready in you do end up with hairdryer / straighteners / make up on the floor area. For a central London hotel I was really surprised how quiet the room was - we were near the lifts and facing out  to the front and never heard a thing. Will definitely be back!",5,2014,12,17
132,londons best kept secret?,"The Sanderson is certainly not your average london hotel. Don't go if you you like stuffy formalities! The whole thing has an amazing atmosphere, from the off the wall decor to the buzz in the long bar at night. the restaurant has a fairly straightforward menu  expertly presented and served. This was a family trip with my grand daughter who was made most welcome in what can be a fairly adult enviroment. Its a great place for couples and even if you are out and about on your own. Front of house team is just that< a great team all working together, and behind the scenes every provides agreat experience.",5,2014,12,16
132,Christmas Drinks and One NIght Stay,"Lovely hotel in the heart of London. My office had booked us in for the night for our Christmas get together and it was a great place to unwind and mingle with colleagues. My one criticism is that the bar area (around the main bar) was on the tight side, so was hard to stand by the bar in a group to chat – perhaps that was the intention! Breakfast options were great, from cooked to continental to cereal. We were warned by our cab driver to be aware of pickpockets/prostitutes in the hotel, but I saw no evidence of this.

The rooms themselves are very well appointed, but maybe a bit on the cold side (from a decor point of view, rather than temperature) as everything was a bit grey, black and white. Decent toiletries to use in the bathroom, with warm, cosy robes and slippers as standard. As a converted office building, the scope for refurbing the rooms must have been limited. My bed was also set at an angle which was a bit odd on first entering the room. The shower was powerful, but on the downside, the room didn't have a bath tub.

Decent pool table near the bar where we spent the majority of the night drinking and chatting. This room was very spacious and the waiting staff were very attentive. The location (we were booked into Hakkasan for dinner) was great and very central and accessible by foot to all London has to offer.",4,2014,12,16
132,"Stayed for business, and would return for leisure!","My husband and I stayed here for twelve days recently while on a business trip. Upon arrival, at 10:30 am, our room was ready although we did not request early check in. JJ, who checked us in, was efficient and informative. We then met Phil who gave us a quick tour and delivered our bags to our room. 

Upon walking in to 509 we were blown away. The sexy white curtains, the angled furniture, the chaise.... We looked at one another and giggled a bit. Good thing Phil made his way out quickly. ha! Soon there after we received a tray of macaroons, fruits, cheeses, and water welcoming us to the hotel. Our room was lovely, however, at night we felt as if we were in the bar all night long along with those actually at the bar. After the second night of this, we went down to the front desk and were promised a change of room by eleven the next morning. We went down to see JJ again who coordinated our change of room. We went out and about and upon our returned late that afternoon our room was changed, our items were moved, etc. 

Our new room, 328, was far more mind blowing- not that we thought that was possible and the best part was that it was far more quiet. This room had a fully enclosed shower that could only fit a handful of people as opposed to the room in the previous room which could easily git two handfuls of people, a separate free standing bath, a seperate makeup room, as I refered to it, and the same table and chaise and angled bed. Thus room also came with the Dumbbells and exercise guide. The remainder of our stay in this room was without any problems. 

This hotel is definitely the place to be when in London. The bars were filled with people both staying there and coming in to have a drink. The space is trendy and attractive yet unique. Style is one of their highest suits. We ordered room service several times during our stay and loved the food each time. The best part is that it isn't just delivered to your room. They come in, set up the table, bring the food out of the warmer cart and even present you with a rose for the table. It isn't regular room service, it's special! That's about how everything here is made to be special in some way. 

We look forward to staying here again in the near future when we find ourselves back in London.",5,2014,12,14
132,Excellent bar staff especially Jai,"Fabulous bar staff. Jai going that extra step to create a stunning non alcoholic cocktail and capture our special day in London by taking photos of us. 

Afternoon tea was equally good and fun and delicious. ",5,2014,12,11
132,What an amazing venue!,"We had a birthday event here in the pool room bar.. And we stayed way later then expected! The staff were fun but professional, the drinks are ridiculous (try the luxury mojito!) and the long bar next to our room was full off cool people. 
Likely be spending a few late nights here over Xmas!! 😳",5,2014,12,11
132,The People Place,"This was a last-minute, ever-changing trip for us. We're staying here again to visit hospitals and doctors nearby.
Once again, from the doormen to the front desk to the restaurant staff, the people have been helpful, concerned, flexible, friendly, efficient, and generally fabulous.
This hotel is a design icon, but that's almost irrelevant - it's The People Place.",5,2014,12,10
132,Fabulous,"I love staying at nice, funky hotels in london. This is the best. So trendy, young people around and great service. The rooms are stunning with along views and reasonable prices for what you get! 
Id definitely go back and go to the restaurant aswell which I've heard is really good",5,2014,12,09
132,Never again,"Overrated and too expensive for what you get.
Not everything what looks special is good.
Very small rooms, completely in white, which gave it a very clinic and cold look.
I would rather recommend a chain hotel in London, more value for money.
You not gonna use the hotel facilities anyway if in London.",3,2014,12,08
132,Modern London,"This hotel is a beautiful and chic, and truly one of the best places to stay in London if you need a luxurious and modern accommodation. They also serve amazing food, very LA influenced menu. You can get something healthy and light, which isn't always possible at the older places. The location is amazing if it is your first time in London, as you are in the center of all the amazing shops, tube stations and very near to all the typical sights to see!",5,2014,12,08
132,Best Cocktails and great service,"Sanderson is a beautiful, stylish and fantastic hotel. I was there with my mother and my sister for some cocktails and we had a great experience. Nice music, great cocktails and amazing atmosphere!!! 
Jai made delicious cocktails and his hospitality was superb!! I truly recommend :)  My mother said he makes the best Caipirinha in London!!!!",5,2014,12,06
132,Fantastic hotel,"Really great stay at Sanderson for a few days in London. The hotel is in a convenient location for Oxford street and easy to get to tube station for all other locations. 
Hotel was beautiful, room was perfect and bars were exactly what we wanted. 
Staff were really helpful and friendly, Matt in particular made our trip by organising surprise birthday champagne and cake! Couldn't fault this hotel, would highly recommend it.",5,2014,12,03
132,Perfect overnight stay in central London,"We booked this hotel through Secret Escapes, which we use a lot, and had a perfect stay in a gorgeous room with a delicious breakfast included.
The rooms were so well equipped and clean and the whole hotel has a very cool modern vibe, right in the heart of London so easy to get to all the shops.
We wanted to experience the spa but were not well on the morning we had booked treatments so were very disappointed not to see that.
Staff were very courteous and helpful, we even saw the famous male model Tyson Beckford in the long bar!",5,2014,12,02
132,Disappointing...,"My husband and I stayed here in October 2014 for his business. My husband has stayed here when he's been in London for over 13 years, sometimes bi-annually for a week at a time & I have accompanied him on a few occasions. When we arrived on this visit, were offered an entry level room on the first floor... Basically, their cattle class room. When we said we weren't happy with that, we were told we'd wait for a room on a higher level. Whilst not desirable as we'd had a long journey, we said that was fine & went and had a late lunch. When we arrived back, we were given a room on a higher floor, but still very basic. After 13 years of loyalty to the Sanderson, you would expect better service or at least recognition as a valued client for the prices you pay. It's not the hotel it was 10-15 years ago unfortunately.",3,2014,12,02
132,"The ""WOW"" Factor!!! ","I have frequented a number of 5* hotels in London for a long weekend. My partner and I stayed in room 610, a loft suite with a private terrace balcony overlooking London. From the moment we arrived the service was fantastic. The hotel is very vibrant and trendy, perhaps not quite suitable for a business trip as there was no desk in our suite but for pleasure this THE hotel to stay in!!. Close to Oxford St (5mins walk) with an amazing lovely bar you will not be disappointed if you are looking for a fun filled lovely weekend. The decor is very modern and funky and the furniture is fabulous. The door staff in particular were fantastic, very helpful chaps indeed. It is great to see a hotel that sets the bar for service all round in every stage of your stay. A massive well done to the team behind this hotel experience. I will definitely be back!! Well done and highly recommend for an extra special experience. ",5,2014,12,01
132,Wonderful Spa Experience,"I recently had an aromatherapy massage at the Agua Spa and had a wonderful experience.  The massage was brilliant and the chill out area was very calming, exactly what I needed.  The staff were so friendly, we could have stayed there all day!  Excellent customer service.  Thank you to all that made it a lovely afternoon.",5,2014,11,29
132,SUPER FRIENDLY ATTNETIVE SERVICE in a modern surrounding,can't elaborate too much except it was a great hotel. there is a busy bar scene but can't say it has the youngest crowds in town. great public spaces and excellent breakfast. close to shopping spots and great concierge service.,5,2014,11,28
132,too trendy for me / not enough amenities,"I stayed here for two nights on a recent business trip.
Pros:
- efficient service (adapter, tea service brought promptly)
- Malin & Goetz toiletries
- comfortable bed
- modern, cool decor - including a cute mini-couch built into my window sill
- very close to Oxford Street
- close to the Theatre district
- free wifi in the room for up to 3 devices (this really should be standard anyway, but sometimes you have weird experiences with hotels that want to charge you for this, and on a by-device basis  - e.g., Marriott!)

Cons:
- very loud (music at night, noises in the hallway and next door)
- limited room service menu and everything is very expensive
- no storage space in the room at all
- I was alone, but if you are sensitive about stuff like this, you may not like the fact that the shower and the bathroom are all glass and separated from the main room with just a curtain
- no iPod docking station
- no pool",3,2014,11,22
132,trendy,"The hotel is located in the middle of everything so if you want to do some shopping clubbing go out for dinner its minutes away from Oxford Street. The hotel is very hip  ... The reception staff matt and Jesus are really helpful and accommodating. 

The room is spacious and nicely decorated.

The spa is great we had an aromatherapy massage the spa layout is very cool the only down side is that there are no walls (curtains) and you can hear people walking outside walking on the wooden floors. Kristina and Katie Marta and Adam from the spa were all helpful and welcoming. 

We had breakfast and it was great the eggs Benedict was one of the best I had in London.

Overall we have enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it",4,2014,11,22
132,Trendy - Unpretentious Elegance,"My company booked me here and when I walked in the front door it was clear why.  This place makes trendy New York hotels look pedestrian.  Wow, just wow.  I walked in and the front desk staff was very friendly, making me feel like I mattered (despite my discounted corporate rate). The room - when I walked in to find myself surrounded by sheer white curtains I felt like I was in a Madonna video.  An excellent experience from check in to check out I would recommend the Sanderson to anyone.  Already fancy and you'll love it. Wanting to be fancy for a weekend and this is your place. Bring your most trendy attire and an attitude with it!",5,2014,11,20
132,Fantastic hotel!,"What a fantastic hotel! The location is just perfect for going shopping, clubbing or going sightseeing. Less than 5 minutes to Oxford street was perfect for us.

From the minute we arrived as a group of girls over to London for a shopping weekend we were not disappointed.

The staff could not do enough to ensure we felt welcome. We had amazing cocktails at the long bar on our first night and the place was buzzing with activity.
The superior double double rooms were fab with wonderful comfy beds and the glass cube for the bathroom was a real quirky addition. The only minor problem in the bathroom was that the taps on the sink were virtually impossible to turn off with wet hands. 

The décor is very tasteful especially down in the foyer.There is a real sense of peace and tranquillity in the corridors of the hotel with the dark lighting and the matching floor and wall colours.

Something that cannot go without mentioning is the amazing 5* breakfast - it was scrummy!! wow!! From an English breakfast to Eggs Benedict no one was disappointed in our group. 

Last by no means least I need to mention Jon D for the care and attention he showed us and made sure we were looked after from the minute we arrived to closing the door of the cab when we were leaving. 
Thank you so much and next time I better bring my husband for the fantastic 5* experience. :)",5,2014,11,20
132,Great Stay and Mad Hatters,"Love this hotel!

Took my mum and better half for Mad Hatters Afternoon Tea. Greg looked after us and made us feel special.  The atmosphere was made better enjoying the experience outside in the Chinese garden with the sun shining😀

The whole hotel including the rooms and the pool table room have something different to other hotels.  It's an adventure all in one.

Definitely recommend this hotel as a place to stay over the weekend!

",5,2014,11,19
132,Very trendy; amazingly comfortable bed!,"I have stayed at the Sanderson hotel many times on business trips to London.  I keep coming back to the Sanderson, despite having many other very nice options, because:
- I love the bed, it's so comfortable!
-The location is fantastic, a short walk to my office, right around the corner from Oxford street
-The spa is fantastic
-The room service food is great!
-The staff have a great customer service approach

A couple of things minor complaints:
-Much as I acknowledge my love for partying (and the bar here is great)  I don't want to hear drunk people running down the halls at 2am midweek giggling loudly (only happened on one occasion so no big deal)
-The taps to the sink are smooth and perfectly cylindrical, making it virtually impossible to turn off the tap with wet hands - rather a small problem, but still!

All in all, I thoroughly enjoy every stay at the Sanderson.",4,2014,11,19
132,Best Hotel in London,"From the minute we arrived for our anniversary weekend the staff bent over backwards for us. I have stayed in many hotels and I can honestly say that Sanderson is the best. Can't say enough good things. Wonderfully comfy bed, best breakfast I have ever had in a hotel and the spa is fabulous. Had one of the best massages of my life from Jonathan. To top it all off I briefly mentioned that we were there for our anniversary and when we returned to our room after being out for the afternoon there was a chilled bottle of wine and a handwritten note. Can't wait to come back. It's worth every penny. ",5,2014,11,18
132,"Great Design, Poor Service","This was our first stay at the Sanderson and I'm afraid it wasn't a brilliant experience.

Let's start with the positives; 
- the hotel design itself is beautiful. It's very quirky and modern and the room was clean and had everything we needed. The glass bathroom in particular was something we thought was a great touch.
- the staff in the purple bar (exclusive to hotel guests) was great. they were very friendly and attentive and they actually assisted with an issue we had better than anyone else including management staff. (explained later)

Negatives;
- when my other half arrived to check in (I arrived later) he was asked to pay £389 deposit per night for the room. As we'd saved for a nice weekend in London this was a fair chunk of our spending money so this put a downer on the trip from the start. My partner paid the first night on his debit card and when I arrived we were going to put the other night on our credit card. It was when we went to do this that they realised that they'd made a mistake and should only have charged £100 per night. Whilst they did refund the money, they weren't particularly apologetic and (due to the time it takes for refunds to process) - this left us with less money for the weekend than we'd planned.
- on our second night we were having drinks at the long bar (open to the public) when I received some very rude and sexist comments from two other customers at the bar. They continued to be very rude and so we removed ourselves and went to sit in reception to which we were told to move by a security guard. We explained the situation and he was extremely rude and insisted we go back to the bar. We asked him for his name but he refused. His manager was equally unhelpful. We ended up going to the purple bar and the staff there were incredible and very professional but the earlier incident had ruined the night. 
- two days after checking out we were charged a further £81 to our card without notification. This was due to mini bar charges which we were obviously happy to pay but felt that a call or email to explain the charge would have been good. When I rang the hotel to query the bill the gentleman was very rude (I believe it was the same person who checked us in actually).
- when we checked out we explained the situation and they said that they would email us with a formal apology within a couple of days but 10 days later and we've still not received anything. I've actually emailed them directly but had no reply.

All in all, a great design and hopefully the service is usually much better but as a first stay in this hotel, we weren't at all impressed with the service.",2,2014,11,18
132,Great cool Hotel,"We had a lovely time at the Sanderson, and will return. The room was fantastic. One of the best Ive ever had in London. It was one of the refurbished ones, and was immaculate. Great bathroom with beautiful free standing bath, plus massive shower. Fantastic massive bed with excellent linens, and a separate funky couch area. So a great nights sleep.

The bar was excellent too. Very cool and a trendy place to hang out. We knew it was busy and it was one of the reasons we came to this hotel. It does get pretty busy though, so not always easy to get a stool. 

The only thing we didnt love was the location. A quiet street to the north of Oxford Street, which we are not lovers of. Once over Oxford Street, you are soon into cool areas like Carnaby Street and Soho which was much better, but location to Oxford Street would not put us off coming back",5,2014,11,17
132,Wonder if the management will take note.,"We arrived and realised this didnt look like your usual Hotel Reception -its quirky and funky, impeccably presented. The two Guys that manned the Reception desk were polite and welcoming, and they were quick. We were slightly disappointed the our 2 rooms booked under same booking and time - we on different floors, but i dont think it was these guys fault and it seemed no major pain. 

Thankfully one of the two rooms we had booked was available early, which was great so we could dump bags and Hit the Shops ! The Sanderson is ideally placed to enjoy the delights of London shopping - Oxford street is round the corner.

 I should mention the Concierge service at this time , they were awesome - whipped luggage out of Taxi, Super helpful, friendly - they seemed really nice people and there was a lot of them on hand. I would like to thank one of them who came to my rescue when a London Taxi Driver was being obnoxious to me outside the hotel as i had request a receipt. The Concierge concerned with this unfortunate event - (He was a Spanish guy i think sorry if im wrong) and came back into reception to check i was OK after this unfortunate event. 

The room was really nice, the quirky and immaculately clean - attention to detail had been paid. The  candles had been lit for us returning to our room, curtains closed on an evening which was lovely to return to. The beds were comfy and i slept like log. However one of our party was woken at 3am by noisy guest in the next room which is always annoying.

The Breakfast was brilliant - The waitress described exactly how it worked, there was something for everyones taste - from a Full English, to Eggs Benedict - My Breakfast was first class

I really wanted to give The Sanderson a 5* rating as its a lovely place but it didn't quite make it - there were things that went wrong. 
 The hotel bar looked Fabulous and we looked forward to a cocktail upon our return from our Evening out. However it was packed, several people looked like they had enjoyed a few too many cocktails.  We were totally unable to get a seat or standing space at or near the bar area,  the bar staff took a while to serve us. I don't know if its always this lively and busy, and the atmosphere was great - it would have been nice to stay and enjoy the place, but there was simply to many drunk people in there.
What ruined the evening was that i find it simply and rude to have a group of men making inappropriate comments as we walked past them, that they wouldn't make if their wives, children or grandchildren were there! I asked myself am i getting old, looked around and these ""gentlemen""and thought they should know better. We were disappointed by this experience , which was compounded by the fact....It could have been so dam good! 

The Electronic room Key failed to work ( after having it reset twice on the same occasion) causing one of us having a wake up a member of our group that had retired to bed early.

I would like to return to the Sanderson however i cant help the thought i would rather have my husband with me next time if it was a Friday or Saturday night. I realise these might be events that the management cant always avoid, and can happen anywhere. There is a Chill out area with a billiards table which may be free, it wasn't when we stayed.  Lots of other aspects of our stay as previously mentioned made up for the areas that just let the place down.",4,2014,11,16
132,Excellent,"Myself and my partner stayed for a night here, we were very impressed, really cool hotel, loved our bedroom, the decor, comfy bed . We had drinks in the purple bar very quirky! Lovely stay and would recommend to anyone a great experience",5,2014,11,16
132,Another great stay,"Favourite hotel in London , rooms on the 6th floor fantastic , balcony with garden chairs to chill out on . Staff as always excellent ...fitness centre with relaxing area one of the most relaxing areas I have been to .

Can not wait for my next vitit . Tro / paul",5,2014,11,16
132,One of the coolest places in London,"Location is excellent, few steps from Oxford Street.
The design of the hotel from Philippe Starck is simply amazing (Morgans hotels are all cozy, but Sanderson is really special).
The long bar in the lobby is an institution in London, Purple Bar atmosphere is so unique.
Rooms are very nice and cozy.
Prices are good for one of the best places in town.
Highly recommended.",5,2014,11,16
132,"""Great Experience""","I really had a great experience, from the moment I arrived to the moment I left. The staff made me feel so welcome, each and everyone of them. The room was very comfortable and the breakfast was excellent, everything so fresh and served with a smile, which is so important, to get the day off to a good start. Well done to everyone there, you are a credit to the Sanderson. Keep up the good work.",5,2014,11,15
132,Fabulously slick..and it works,"We live in London so staying overnight has to be a worthwhile experience when a taxi home is an easy option, having stayed in most of the well known London hotels The Sanderson is a cut above, smooth, slick, funky but best of all it works, many hotels & restaurants try hard with the funky feel but fail. The staff are all very professional but laid back at the same time, using your name which goes a long way. We stayed in a Deuxe King which was large, bright & comfortable, after a few drinks in the fabulous Purple Bar we wondered how much noise we would hear in our room, we we pleasantly surprised..not a sound.
We both had treatments in the morning at the Spa, beautiful surroundings but my only criticism would be the partitioning of treatment rooms with just curtains means that you hear everything going on, taps running, conversation etc not great if you like to switch off during your treatment.
Overall, a fabulous stay & wouldn't even look elsewhere when staying in London again.",5,2014,11,15
132,Really wish it was a 5*,"The Sanderson is really  a hotel for the young and the hip and tends to be the clientele it attracts, I have stayed here and loved it and well hated it though mainly loved it. As I am commenting on my most recent stay it will receive a 3* rating. Check in as ever was quick, the lift upto the room is beautiful no matter how many times you have frequented this place, rooms not always the easiest to find but always large and clean. My most recent stay had a few problems which is a disappointment for me as I  have always  mostly enjoyed my stays here but this coincides with my joining tripadvisor, the room was as expected shower room only which is what you get as a standard room, which wasn't a problem even though I prefer a bath. However I was here for a long weekend with my guy, the first day I was the last to leave the room and left a tip which meant the tea and coffee were fully replenished the following 2 days my guy left the room after me he left no tip ( I know he's not used to the etiquette of a higher standard, but didn't think about it at the time) . However on the days he left the room after me despite being cleaned i.e water replaced etc the toiletries were not replaced, also I had put my towels on the hangers as I didn't want to get mine removed from the room with the hotels, however as well as not replacing the tea / coffee etc they had removed my towels despite my moving them out of the way and they were not traceable, I also had to contact house keeping to replenish the tea/coffee on these days, the hotel has been wonderful when I have been on my own so hate giving it a 3* rating, however when with company it just didn't work out as amazing as it had been on previous occasions. Now I am back to being single maybe my next time at the hotel may meet the mark and be back to the previous 5* experience I have had in the past.",3,2014,11,14
132,Excellent Food & Staff,I have never felt the need to leave a review before until I stayed at the Sanderson. If you're looking for a quirky London hotel with five star dining and excellent service then this is the place to go. Breakfast was just amazing & the cocktails at night were second to none. The staff went above and beyond their call of duty.  Thank you so much guys!! We'll be back. xx,5,2014,11,14
132,"Fab hotel, brilliant location and excellent staff","I stayed here for a girlie weekend. The location is perfect right next to oxford street. The hotel is lovely, the rooms are spotless and the service is second to none. The staff are extremely helpful and forthcoming. The food is out of this world and I highly recommend the breakfast. The expertise in cocktail making from the bar staff was brilliant to watch and the drinks themselves are delicious. Thanks to Jon for organizing a very special stay in this fabulous hotel for us. I'll definitely be back. Cannot recommend it highly enough!! 
Elaine from Ireland ",5,2014,11,14
132,"Gorgeous Hotel, Fantastic Experience.","From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were made feel so welcome. The staff were so friendly and helpful, and the rooms were beautiful. I had family over for the weekend to celebrate a special occasion and we stayed in the superior double double. It was cosy and warm and so quiet. And the icing on the cake was the delicious breakfast. It was so lovely and the perfect start to the day! I hope to go back and visit again soon! I can't imagine choosing anywhere else to stay in London.",5,2014,11,14
132,"Excellent for work stay, even if a bit over the top","Stayed for 3 nights this week for a work trip.  Arrived 6am, and there was no room ready, but I was courteously led to the spa, where I could take a nice shower, grab a robe, and crash quietly and comfortably in a soft chair, amid the 2-story-high white-draped lounge.  Heavenly.  Room was nice, with Morgans Group flourishes of simple lines, wall-less bathroom (and that shower that doesn't have a lip on the floor, so water leaks out if you're careful).  4 USB jacks, and a few electrical plugs.  Kudos to the excellent bedside lamps, extremely comfortable bed, and (for me) perfect pillows (very long and stuffed to good firmness with good feathers). I tried both bars - the long bar is good for socializing, but the Purple Bar (guests only?) had superior cocktails and booze selection.  The gym was as good as one could ask for - weight machines, cardio machines, free weights, bench, rollers, balls, etc...

Others have complained about noise, but I didn't experience any.  The place is very dark, so if that bothers you, be forewarned.  But I will be back.",5,2014,11,13
132,Another perfect visit!,"When visiting London I now don't even both looking at other hotels. We booked to stay for two nights in one of the deluxe king rooms. After having left another positive review I was told to email Lexi when we were returning and so after booking I did. She upgraded the room to the next level which was really kind of her. We got into London about 11 and as we wanted to do some shopping on Oxford Street decided to head to the hotel and drop our bags off. Our room wasn't due for check in until 3 so we were incredibly early and all I wanted to do was drop the bags off. The person on reception, who's name I have sadly forgotten, told us that if we gave him a minute he would get us another room upgrade and have a room ready straight away. This was fantastic service as I didn't expect to be able to check in so early. We went up to the room, which was the Loft Suit with Balcony, which is beautiful to say the least, and decided to unpack. 
We were in the room no less than 20 minutes when there was a knock on the door and one of the hotel staff with a hand written welcome note from the manager along with a bottle of champagne, this was a really nice touch and just made us feel more at home.
Didn't really do much in the hotel until the next night when we went to the purple bar for some cocktails. The waitress in the bar was really nice and helped us with our drinks. After a couple of drinks I ordered the Heisenberg cocktail which the barman, the one with the beard, warned me probably wouldn't be to my taste. I had it anyway and he was right lol. Anyway had an awesome time in the purple bar with the rest of the cocktails in there. 
The next morning was our last night and we were due to checkout at 12. I was a little worse for wear and called down to reception who happily extended the room so we could check out later. After signing the bill and leaving our bags to go round london I spotted an erroneous charge on the bill. Was simply a charging error. Went back to the hotel and explained that someone else's bill had been put onto my bill by mistake and it was dealt with professionally and refunded in about 2 minutes. 

In summary, brilliant location, brilliant room, exception staff and a great hotel. When looking for a top of the range hotel to stay at in london this one really is in a league of it's own!",5,2014,11,13
132,Amazing hotel - would thoroughly recommend,"We stayed here for just one night but were so impressed by everything, from the Front Desk staff (who were very helpful), to the the standard of room.
We told them it was our anniversary and got a complimentary bottle of Champers - a very nice touch!

Also, on the Sunday morning, we rang down for a newspaper

We also had afternoon tea which was expensive but well worth the experience. A very high standard & absolutely delicious.

After seeing a show, we decided to return to the hotel bar and it was absolutely buzzing! Great atmosphere and cocktails were fab.

Also, position of hotel is good, just off Oxford St and & 10 mins walk from theatreland.

All in all, was a great place and would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,11,10
132,Not perfect but pretty good,"First impression was of tasteful modern décor with some interesting modern artistic features a feast for the eyes on arrival. Check in was quite swift the check in clerk didn't tell us our room number but wrote it down on the usual key card holder.  Getting up to the 3rd floor on the planetarium lift (you'll know what I mean when you visit) was quick, however the corridors were extremely dimly lit and only illuminated by the room number lights, therefore we were unable to make out the room number on the card and had to go back to reception.  The room was very modern, but not the cleanest, the bathroom was only partitioned by an electric net curtain which was very amusing for about the first two minutes; on reflection, not sure the point of it was as there was another net curtain behind it that you pulled manually! the toilet partitioned by obscured glass.  Bed was queen sized and extremely comfortable and had a great night sleep. Air con nice and quiet and efficient.  Breakfast was bit hap hazard had to wait an age for our cooked breakfast which was cold on arrival, no side plates served with the toast.  So all in all it was ok, but don't think it was worth the price paid.  The dimly lit corridors could definitely be a health and safety hazard and probably do hide a multitude of sins !.",3,2014,11,09
132,Perfection,"Bonjour trip adviser...ers 

If you are like me and insist on reading a review or six before visiting somewhere this should help cement your choice
 
I took my partner here for her birthday. This was the first birthday we have spent together so I wanted to go to town all costs aside because i'm nice like that.

I emailed in advance to see if they could do anything special and they did not disappoint. Im quite easily impressed so a towel fashioned into some kind of bird of flight on the bed would've made me happy but oh no they left a chilled bottle of £45 champagne in the room....(googled it) and fresh rose petals on the bed indicating a night of passion would soon inhabit the boodwar which was wrong because after our night out we were so intoxicated i spent £45 on room service (which was delightful btw) and passed out on a cocktail stick imbedded in my foot.

The reception to the hotel is stunning. colorful eccentric and very classy all at the same time. The receptionist was very friendly and im pretty sure she gave me the eye which adds at least 10 points to my overall score. 

The room we stayed in was  a standard double which was the nicest room ive ever stayed in hands down. The bathroom was the sort of thing you would find in a spa with all sorts of cool things included (at a cost). 

The minibar was stocked to capacity with a hole range of things including a box with a sex toy kit which was a quirky bonus. 

The long bar is stunning but expensive. The purple bar was holding some kind on shady meeting which i can only presume related to a Russian black market arms deal as when I walked in was quickly ushered out by an apologetic chap in a nice suit.

When I staggered in at around 3am I ordered room service which was amazing and delivered promptly on a silver platter. I also ordered breakfast while on the phone which arrived at 11am on the dot on a mobile table cart thing. I presumed i would've ordered the full English however due to my blood alcohol level clearly not. A very proud waiter lifted up a metal dome on the cart to present...in his words with a slight french accent ""your fired eggs sir...perfectly rounded a little bit runny with toast and part fried cherry tomato's"" I kept my composure and thanked but as soon as he left there was laughter!

The only way to understand the level this hotel is at is to stay there. There's always bad reviews on every location on trip adviser but don't listen to them because my review's better! 

Much love
JK",5,2014,11,08
132,Nice hotels,On arrival check in was a bit too slow (only one person working behind the desk) but the rest of the stay was almost perfect. They apologize to have kept me waiting and gave an upgrade to superior rooms. Room was very nice and spacious and all the services were perfect. Breakfast a bit expensive. Location superb.,5,2014,11,07
132,brilliant,"Due to major school exams it was not possible to escape for half term so a compromise involved one night in London and being one night only it had to be great. I booked the Sanderson through a website at a reasonable cost which i then paid more to upgrade on arrival but we all loved it. The staff were laid back, friendly and efficient. The rooms were different and cool. The decor is fab. Everything work beautifully including turn down and newspapers, water, toiletries you want to take home at the end of the stay, pillows which are comfortable, air con that works,  and a great gym. Wished I had eaten there but didn't. Nevertheless I have a monumental desire to return.",5,2014,11,05
132,First class hotel AND best spa i have ever been to,"We got married in London 1st November. We live in London, but decided to stay at the Sanderson for our wedding night, as it is one of the best designed hotels in london (i am a fashion stylist, my husband a creative director - nothing else would do...) and i also booked in for treatments at the spa in the morning - an aromatherapy massage and Jurlique facial. 
Due to almost everything going wrong in our wedding preparations i arrived at the hotel in the morning having had 2 hours sleep and completely exhausted, with puffy eyes. but with friendly professional and caring attention, the staff at the spa sorted me out with the best massage and facial i have ever had (and i have been pretty much everywhere) - completely restoring me - god knows how. Afterwards i got a green smoothie and a bowl of strawberries - and extra ice for my eyes in case i needed it! Also i must mention that the spa design is beautiful. It will be my london-go-to-spa from now on.  The staff at the hotel also treated us like kings and queens, scattering fresh rose petals on our bed and there was a bottle of champagne waiting for us when we finally got back to the hotel in the small hours. i have never experienced friendlier, more attentive service, anywhere else. We are so grateful and warmly recommend the Sanderson. When we left, the manager gave us his card so that we could contact him personally if we wanted to come back for our anniversary. Class.",5,2014,11,05
132,Very special hotel,"My husband and I spent three nights at the Sanderson and had an absolutely wonderful experience. The hotel is both beautiful and whimsical!  From the Long Bar to the Purple Bar (stunning!) to the fabulous elevators, it does not disappoint!  The staff could not be nicer, truly.  Our room was gorgeous and the bed was extremely comfortable and the shower and soaking tub were great.  Kris and his staff surprised us with a sweet note and a bottle of champagne for my husband's birthday.  The location is perfect - so much of London is within walking distance and the tube is just a few blocks away.  Overall, a very special hotel!  We hope to return one day soon!",5,2014,11,02
132,Great hotel,but I can appreciate that the design would not be to everyone's taste. Great bar and outside drinking/dining area. The bar attracts a lot of non residents so tends to be busy and noisy late at night. If noise bothers you then ask for a quiet room location. Otherwise great hotel within 2 mins walking distance of Oxford Street/ Soho/ Fitzrovia,5,2014,11,01
132,Five star excellence,"This was our second stay at this excellently positioned hotel and we would recommend a stay here at any time.
From the moment you arrive at reception you are met with warmth and friendliness and that continues for the rest of your stay.
Our room was spacious, white, crisp and stylishly decorated.
As it was our anniversary we returned in the afternoon to find rose petals and candles waiting for us which was a lovely touch.
We had a superb nights sleep and the shower and toiletries was a real treat.
Breakfast was superb and included in our offer and the choice and quality of the food was very good. Again service was excellent.
Try booking direct with the hotel for a good deal and treat yourself to a touch of luxury at a convenient location for both shopping and it is just a 15 minute gentle stroll to Covent Garden,",5,2014,10,27
132,Great last minute decision!,"On Saturday I was due to depart London after lunchtime following three days of business meetings and subsequent nights out! During lunch I felt so tired and hungover I could not face the train journey home.   I knew I was only around the corner from this fantastic hotel and decided to turn up there check in enjoy the spa, facilities etc and travel home rested the next day.  What a great decision that was! On arrival I was politely greeted and offered an excellent rate for a superior quiet room on the 6th floor.  I booked a massage at the spa and had room service for dinner in the room.  Now this is not the first hotel you think of for a quiet stay due to the great onsite bars and restaurants but it really delivered that for me!  
TOP MARKS FOR THE SANDERSON.  SEE YOU SOON !",5,2014,10,27
132,As great as last time,"We just returned to the Sanderson for the second time and loved it as much a the first time.  The staff is fabulous. Everyone form Julie at the front desk, Joey and Biken at the Concierge desk, and the hostesses and servers in the restaurant were so friendly and helpful.  The hotel has such an air of intimacy and caring while at the same time being fun and trendy.  We were given a lovely room that was very spacious and well thought out. Never heard a peep from the bar that was always hopping at night.  We love this area of town as it is less congested, but easily accessible to everywhere we wanted to go.  If you want personal service in a modern upscale environment, I can't think of a better place to stay. Thanks Grant and the gang for showing us a fabulous time!",5,2014,10,24
132,Chic,"A beautiful, modern, new school hotel. hotel bar is almost constantly lively and a place to be seen. The rooms are very chic and minima, lacking personality but very comfortable, with attention to detail where it counts (bathroom etc). We were however upgraded to one of the newly refurbed rooms which are stunning. Fautless and a great central location.",5,2014,10,23
132,Very Happy Traveller,"The Sanderson really exceeded my expectation, it was an experience that has now set the bar very high for any of my future stays in any Hotel around the world. I have never written a review nor made a complaint but I felt I needed to just say like many who have stayed already, that it is a wonderful establishment. I was greeted immediately at the door by (Nigel) I think that was his name, I just notice his name badge had Manager on it. When you travel in 4.5 -5 star establishments you never see a manager, they always seem to be hiding or running around madly like there busy. He was an exceptional professional and was extremely genuine, and it really set our stay off to a great start.
The rooms were presented beautifully and the decor was very modern, it was sheik and sophisticated and was worth every cent. I did think it was over priced at time of booking but as they say ""you get what you paid for"". I will be back again and will be recommending to many of my friends.",5,2014,10,23
132,Absolutely amazing guest services!,"Stayed at the hotel after a disappointing experience. The manager and staff offered the most outstanding services to make out stay enjoyable!! It's so refreshing to know that such amazing customer services still exist!! Great location, the Long bar was really trendy, definitely recommend this hotel to anyone thinking about it!",5,2014,10,20
132,5 star luxury hotel,"Sanderson is a five star luxury boutique hotel in the heart of London's West End. The building was designed by the famous French architect Philippe Starck. Location is top - just a few steps from Oxford Street shopping and the vibrant Soho Theatre district. Rooms are newly renovated and very stylish designed. Not to forget the beautiful Courtyard Garden reflecting calmness, tranquility and peace. Drinks should be taken in the beautiful glowing onyx Long Bar.",5,2014,10,19
132,Quirky but great hotel,"The Sanderson public rooms are definitely quirky, but for me everything worked. My wife and daughter didn't like the cocktail bar or indeed the cocktails, but I wasn't there. 
We were in room 504 which was very large and well designed. The bed was huge and very comfortable. 
All the staff were very young but charming and helpful. We were the oldest guests as far as I could see but I did not feel patronised.

If you get the right price this can be a fantastic value hotel.",5,2014,10,19

132,Mathias Lindstrom,"A great hotel with excellent location. Everything from room to restaurant to staff and service was 5*
I had read a lot of comments here about the hotel needed to update but I really dont agree and in Sweden we have much better standars overall. It was nice and clean with a collection of cool furnitures and details. A special thanks to J. J at the hotel who provided magnificent service and made our stay the best. Helpful, serviceminded and always a smile! Thanks JJ! Furthermore many thanks to our countryman Henrik at Concierge desk - excellent tips and great knowledge. Even special thanks to C J at the door, so as Andre. Will visit again!!!",5,2014,10,14
132,Fantastic Birthday stay!,"I chose the Sanderson to stay in for my Birthday celebrations with my sisters and girlfriends and we had a fantastic time! From the minute our cab pulled up and the efficient doorman helped us and our luggage inside everything was perfect. We arrived earlier than check-in expecting only to leave our bags with concierge but Charles Dessert from Rooms coordination was so helpful and whisked us off to reception to check us in and sort our rooms. There was a small technical problem with the deluxe double queen room we had booked but he quickly rectified this and offered us more than suitable alternatives ( they even gave us complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience!). 
The rooms were fabulous, extremely comfortable beds, very clean & spacious. I had mentioned to Charles that it was my birthday & he sent up a bottle of champagne & a slice of cake to me which was a lovely gesture!

We had drinks and bar snacks at lunch time in the Long bar which were delicious & later we had cocktails before we went out for dinner which were also delicious. Eddie on the bar was an absolute star and looked after us extremely well as did all of the bar staff we encountered.
The breakfast was also 5 star - a great continental buffet  & a large choice of freshly prepared hot items on the menu.

I was a little worried that the Hotel would feel cold and impersonal as it is such a modern, trendy place but it could not have been more opposite. All of the staff at The Sanderson make you feel extremely welcome and nothing is too much trouble. I have stayed in lots of 4/5 star hotels in London and this is definitely at the top of my  list and I can't wait to go back!!",5,2014,10,13
132,11tg wedding anniversary surprise ,"My husband surprised me with a night out to the sanderson, we turned up and was given an upgrade on our room by a lovely man named JJ, I walked into a beautiful room with some amazing flowers and later after our meal come back to a bottle of champagne and bed turned down. Had such an amazing time just what me and my husband needed. Also would love to thank Biken who help my husband with the flowers and everything else that he needed. ",5,2014,10,12

Booked as a celebration weekend and just wanted to especially thank Charles at reception who went the extra mile. .We also received a lovely bottle of champagne in our room which was a lovely touch and when we ordered a taxi, we were offered by the concierge the hotel car which was lovely and added a touch of luxury to take us to our next location....It wasn't available for our return journey unfortunately so had to use a normal taxi service. Also Linxi was very helpful at reception when we checked out today and there was an error on our bill which she was quick to rectify and was very helpful and attentive.  The room was amazing..We had a standard room but it was far from standard! Very impressed and we both agreed that it is the best hotel we have stayed in. Lovely sized room and bathroom,  gorgeous interior design and luxury bathroom products. Breakfast was good  Thank you for a wonderful stay. Mr and Mrs Marston.",5,2014,10,05
132,Anniversary stay,"I recently booked a stay at the sanderson for our wedding anniversary. I booked over the phone and asked if they had any deals if I paid in full at time of booking, but was told no. I also asked if breakfast was included and again was told no. I went ahead and booked anyways as id aways fancied staying here , It was also close to the restaurant we had booked for  our anniversary ( Benares ).

After booking,  I looked on their website to find that indeed they did have an offer on,  for a free bottle of champagne on arrival and breakfast for 2. I emailed them about this and the lovely Fabio respond straight away saying that they would be able to give me this offer. 

On arrival before even paying the cab driver the door man was opening the cab door and taking our luggage asking what name we had booked under. As we got to the front desk they was already bringing up our booking as the doorman had given them our details very efficient . We was told that we had been upgraded and that our bottle of champagne would be sent up to our room. We made our way up to our loft suite we had been upgraded to and I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong the room was nice, it was big and I'm sure if you was staying for business it would be perfect. But we had a view of the road no bath in the bathroom which i had wanted as it was an anniversary. I decided that I wanted the room I had booked so went back to reception to be asked to move which they were able to do.

We moved to the deluxe king that I had booked to begin with. As soon as I opened the door I was very happy, the room smelled lovely, it was nice and big, huge bed,  large sofa and table to sit at and nice bathroom with free standing bath, it also over looked the courtyard. Very nice. I did see on some reviews people didn't like the curtains that separated the bathroom from the bedroom , I just wanted to mention that you still have privacy as there is a glass wall and also a blackout curtain that can come across. There is also doors on the toilet and shower.  As for the noise I didn't find it bad at all,  again I notice people mention it quite a bit on the reviews . Yes you can hear the hustle and bustle of the bar but its not bad and by the time we come back from our meal anyways the hotel bar looked like it was winding down and couldn't hear anything by the time we went to bed. 

We never received our bottle of champagne on arrival weather this was to do with the room change or not I don't know. We headed to the long bar to have some cocktails which were very nice but pricey. We went back to our room to get ready for dinner and still no champagne so once ready we headed to the purple bar I loved it in here. There was a hen do going in there for cocktail lessons but the staff did warn us of this before ordering our drinks but it was not a problem and everyone in there was lovely. After returning from diner I asked at reception if the champagne could be sent up and finally it arrived. We had a glass each and then went to bed as had been a long day. 

Over all was a nice hotel,  pricey but I suppose for a special occasion it is nice.",4,2014,10,04
132,Home away from home,"Can't wait to return to the Sanderson during my coming trip to London. The attention to details, personal touch and friendly staff all my this hotel my favourite.

I used to stay at the London Edition before venturing across the street and checking out the Sanderson. While The Edition is definitely high end and accommodating, it feel large and un-personal compared to the boutique feeling one gets at the Sanderson. 

Nir",5,2014,10,04
132,Amazing Hotel and staff,"We stayed at the Sanderson for about a week in September, and had an absolutely amazing experience.  The rooms were huge ( for London) and the staff were all amazingly accommodating (Charles especially!).  We stayed at the Ace in Shoreditch before coming to the Sanderson and while the Ace had it's positives, I can't say more positive things about the Sanderson.  The food was wonderful and everything was a breeze from start to finish. We also had some friends come for a meal and all of them were in love with the hotel as well - not hard to see why :)",5,2014,10,03
132,Lovely service,I enjoyed my stay here in particular the breakfast which is cooked only upon ordering instead of the usual buffet. Food was delicious. Gaby who waited at my table on all 3 mornings was extremely polite and  attentive. The only downside is the dark corridors and lifts. ,4,2014,10,02
132,Nice rooms but excellent service,"This isn't the cheapest hotel but we decided on an treat and this didn't disappoint, from the moment you arrive the staff are lovely and simply cannot do enough for you. The bar service can be a bit slow but again great staff and the cocktails are worth waiting for. The rooms are very stylish with lots of clean lines, glass and billowing drapes; the only criticism of the room I would have is that you haven't any drawer space just some open shelves in the bathroom area, there were fine for a 2 night stay but would have irritated me on a longer stay. I would go back again",4,2014,10,01
132,Fantastic hotel,Stayed here many a time and never had a bad experience to date. Staff are always friendly and efficient in all areas. Location is ideal as only 2 minutes from Oxford Street and all of londons nightlife. If you haven't stayed here you must!,5,2014,09,30
132,Great staff lovely hotel,I recently stayed here and only positive things to say about the place. All the staff are extremely friendly and efficenct. The facilities are excellent and I loved the long bar. The rooms are spacious and clean. Thoroughly recommend ,5,2014,09,30
132,"Fab location, great hotel ","We have been here a couple of times now, it is a lovely boutique style hotel with some quirky decorations. It is in a ideal location, lovely food in the restaurant. Clean smart rooms. Quite a celebrity hangout as each time we went we spotted a celebrity, first time was glee cast and second time was leona Lewis ! ",5,2014,09,29
132,Excellent staff. Immaculate service.,"I've only spent one evening at this hotel.  My first time. From the moment I entered the lobby, I was welcomed with smiles. Genuine smiles. The Sanderson is chic, classy and contemporary but there's a warmth to it all.  Inviting atmosphere with candles at the Long Bar to a more cosy and intimate feel of the Purple Bar with a fantastic cocktail genius behind the counter. Rooms are nice and big compared to what you get at most places in London.  Had a good rest and was recharged the next morning thanks to an incredibly comfortable bed. Staff are super helpful but never bombards you with assistance. Overall just a wonderful boutique experience. I will definitely be back for more than just an evening.",5,2014,09,28
132,Top notch staff,"I love this hotel. Wonderfully decorated rooms, spotless, comfortable. Couldn't get a better location in central London. All the staff throughout this hotel take their work seriously and are extremely polite and helpful. I've stayed in many hotels around the world, this one is on my short list of favorites. I stay here for business and pleasure. My wife loves it as well. Breakfast is excellent and the bar is very popular not only with the guests but also Londoners. ",5,2014,09,27
132,Discrete luxury and class!!,"Weekend away with OH and we managed to get into the Sanderson! From the moment you walked past the net curtained lobby (am sure to keep the paps at bay) you enter a very quirky world of Philip Stark including super long sofa, big red lips sofa, and wierd and wonderful seating arrangements. The day we arrived was unbearably hot and muggy in London so an ice cool bottle of water on arrival was increadibly welcome. 

Out room through a dimly lit corridor continues with more quirk with a very sumptuous big bed, a mini bar of naughty and nice delights and great bathroom. Given we were both off parenting duties for the weekend we made use of this. This is a place to take your most loved one for that additional bit of spice and decadence. We also have to commend the ever attentive Lukasz and Julia in the purple bar for increadible encylopic knowledge of thier chosen art of cocktail making. They revel in making something bespoke and off the menu and the ""old fashioned"" was knockout. 

Only flaw was on first day of breakfast service the restaurant appeared rushed and chaotic, given we stayed at the weekend you would expect it to be busy especially with a hotel of this reputation to cope with ease however not quite the experience with our breakfast taking over 40 minutes to arrive. We raised this politely with the management team who were apologetic and have to say next day was totally different and we recieved rock star treatment. Bravo!

Definatly a place to come back to, just leave the kids at home!!",5,2014,09,26
132,Must go back!,"We had a work do here and it is the quirkiest, funkiest hotel I have ever visited!  The furniture in the lounge areas is varied and arty, the entrances to the lifts are pure art deco.  There is a lovely bar and an atrium area with water feature which sadly we didn't have time to visit. I am guessing that the bedrooms will be equally interesting! The staff are friendly and helpful.   I am definitely going to visit again for cocktails,  and maybe lunch or dinner.",4,2014,09,24
132,The best stay ever!!,"We recently stayed at the Sanderson to celebrate an anniversary and a proposal. After making my online reservation I emailed Kris to request a possible early check in. Kris went out of his way to make our stay special and we received lots of special treatment that added to the wow factor that the Sanderson already has. Our stay was perfect, the staff so friendly (special thanks to Charles) and our room was amazing. We had a lovely evening on the courtyard and even though we didn't have a reservation on a busy Friday night we were given a table for 2 and then moved to allow 2 of our friends who wanted to celebrate our engagement with us to join us. The hotel is stunning and the service matches. We can't wait to return.",5,2014,09,21
132,I agree with the last review,"Great location, young friendly staff, loved it all but the noise.....felt like I was trying to get to sleep during a rave, won't deter another visit, will just bring ear plugs and a couple of sleeping tablets!",4,2014,09,21
132,If you want to get any sleep - stay elsewhere,"We stayed at the Sanderson for a few days during the week - on two out of the four nights they hosted large parties in the courtyard which unfortunately backs onto the rooms and means that the noise level was intolerable until they switched off the music at midnight. The sound quality in the rooms was very very poor too and after the parties finished we were subjected to loud noisy vomiting from two people in the next room - quite revolting! Sounded like they were in our room.

The hotel is cool and trendy and a good location for Oxford circus but for a five star - really unimpressed.",1,2014,09,18
132,Perfectection,"We stayed there for nine nights in August. We have been staying there for several years. The management and staff have been the since the beginning. Special thanks to Nigel, the manager. They are always courteous and respectful everytime. ",5,2014,09,18
132,Feel beautiful,"The rooms make you feel beautiful. Never had more fun just flipping through channels on tv. 

I spent all Sunday at the restaurant-bar with friends. The drinks are divine!

Spent Monday at the spa. Feels like the future with the 4 metre curtains. 

Sign me up for another stay!",5,2014,09,17
132,Always love arriving at this hotel!,"Stayed several times, usually on special occasions and big weekends in London!  They get the décor just right, and the rooms, the long bar, the funky back bar are all great.  I always recommend to family and friends.",5,2014,09,16
132,Fantastic,"What can I say, a most outstanding hotel.  The rooms were so clean and comfortable - and modern.  The Long Bar in the hotels foyer is frequented by many, however I could not here any noise in my room.  I will definitely stay here again.  Breakfast was also plentiful.  Very handy to Oxford Street and many restaurants.  A lovely hotel experience.",5,2014,09,16
132,Funky Chilled Hotel in the best location,"I was lucky enough to be taken to the Sanderson Hotel for my birthday last week. It's a great hotel, funky open layout with friendly helpful staff, in a location so Central next to soho but without hearing the noise from Oxford Street which is only a minute walk away.

We stayed in one of the refurbished suites and it was something special. The tea lights guided us through the shiffon curtains that surrounded the rooms. Never had so much space in a London hotel room which was needed as had the biggest slay bed which was sooooo comfy and separate dressing room to the hall and bathroom. The bath was huge and the lighting was perfect to continue the chilled theme throughout. 

The long bar was buzzing in the evening with a mix of tourists, city workers out after work and those that had come up for. Good night out. The purple bar was nice for a quieter few cocktails, nicely dark for a nightcap or more chilled to take in this special hotel.

We took advantage of such a nice room by having a late check out at 4, so much better than other hotels time wise and can highly recommend room service for a late brunch.

Everything was to such a high standard which made the stay even more special. Thanks for a fantastic stay.",5,2014,09,16
132,Cool Vibe!,"The Sanderson is the go-to in the West End and everything I've come to expect from the Morgans Hotel Group. The regular rooms are comfortably modern and the terrace suites are great for light entertaining. Long Bar (the hotel's main bar) as well as the other venues are great, but also pretty trendy so on certain evenings it gets a bit crowded. The staff is very accommodating throughout.",4,2014,09,15
132,"Great Hotel, cool ambiance","I’ve been to the Sanderson more than once now and will go back again.
I love the trendy décor of the hall, with bright red sof in the shape of lips, the elevator, that seems to take you to another planet and the structure of the room, which is basically a loft where the sleeping area and the bathroom are cleverly divided by some white, light curtains and glass and still you feel total privacy and comfort.
The staff at the reception is very friendly and helpful and you really feel welcomed here.The bar is very happening, with lots of cool people and they make a killer martini. The restaurant, Suka, is one of the best I tried lately, especially if you like Asian fusion cuisine.",5,2014,09,14
132,Something a bit different ,"Stayed here for 3 nights on business. A very cool vibe, from the lobby, lifts, corridors through to the room decor. Service was efficient, room service was even better. Excellent choice of room service breakfast. Turn down service a nice touch- quirky candle ! Loved the bathroom design, and the macaroons were a great welcome ",5,2014,09,13
132,Ultra Cool,"Loved staying in this ultra cool establishment. As this was a very important trip to London,I wanted something different to the usual stuffy five star hotels that have old fashioned interiors with frilly curtains and patterned wallpaper. This hotel had everything you'd expect from a five star hotel and the staff we all very welcoming and service was slick. Some of the highlights of our stay were cocktails in the famous Long Bar and use of the hotel's chauffeur driven car. I would like to thank Henrik for his personal care and making us feel speacial during our stay.",5,2014,09,12
132,Mad Hatters Afternoon Tea :),"I had afternoon tea with a friend and had such a fantastic time we decided to book a room.

We stayed in a deluxe room which had a bath tub.

Thanks to Greg for making it a crazy but exciting afternoon tea and also Nigel for the complimentary Champagne to our room.

It was a blast and a half!",5,2014,09,10
132,Far from stark,"Enjoyed a short break in London and one of the highlights was coming ""home"" to the Sanderson. These guys understand the concept of hospitality. Our room was lit with natural sunlight and it was pleasnt to be able to open the doors to the open terrace. Thanks to all the staff who made us feel welcome and worked to meet our needs. Make sure you set some time aside for a flyer in The Long Bar and a nightcap in The Purple Bar.",5,2014,09,10
132,Loved staying at the Sanderson,"Just spent four days at the Sanderson London Hotel and it was a relaxing way to ease into the bustle of London as it's walking distance to shops, theatres, Southbank, restaurants and transport. The hotel is funky and fun with spacious sunny rooms and great furnishings. The thing I liked most though was the friendly and efficient staff who made us feel really welcome and were happy to help in any way they could. I would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,09,09
132,Fantastic hotel ,"This is a great hotel just a stones throw from Oxford St. From the outside, it doesn't look like much but once you step inside you won't regret it.

The rooms are a decent size with a luxury modern feel to them. Our room was on the 3rd floor and was an open plan type of affair. 

We had breakfast the following morning which was delicious. Lots of choices and all tasting great.

We only stayed one night, the staff were very friendly and always helpful.

Definitely would stay here again. 
",5,2014,09,07
132,Great service from JJ,"Our booking agent messed up our room bookings which was a real worry because we were there for a 50th celebration.  Fortunately JJ gave us fantastic service, was really calm, sorted out different rooms and made sure we had a brilliant stay.",5,2014,09,07
132,London in Style,"Memorable  3 days in London put together by Concierge staff, particularly Emily Moulton. Fantastic bar and restaurant in hip environment. Hotel decor is artistic and will keep you eyes amused. Bed was extremely comfortable, slept like a baby.",5,2014,09,06
132,Exceptional,"I stayed in a newly refurbished loft terrace on a recent visit to London and can only describe it as an utterly fabulous experience. The newly designed room was stylish, warm, and yet in total keeping with Sanderson's original design ethos. Guests can now enjoy wonderfully comfortable seating and a stylish table on which to work or dine. The upgraded IT and television systems were easy to use and offered everything a business or leisure guest would require. The bed and bed linens were ultra luxurious. Even though the weather did not allow me to use the terrace it was very ""inviting"" with stunning furniture. At night with lighted candles it is seductive and romantic and in the day it is the perfect sun trap.  My only regret was I had so little time to enjoy such an exceptional experience.

The entire staff at the hotel were, as always, friendly and warm and nothing was too much trouble. Thank you for providing me a great stay.
GMK8",5,2014,09,06
132,Superb,"We arrived early but JJ on reception reworked the rooms to ensure I could get in and have a complimentary upgrade to a 'loft' room which was superb and very contemporary

The service from valet parking, check in, concierge right through to the waiting staff was outstanding and I would definitely return. 

Well done all!",5,2014,09,05
132,"Very chic, expensive hotel.","Initial reaction wow, very modern artsy quirky reception area. Room very comfortable, I didn't want to get out of bed in the morning. Spacious and luxurious. Bar pretty expensive and in the evening turns into a very funky area to socialise and relax. Staff very friendly and accommodating. ",5,2014,09,05
132,Crisp white lines,"Preferred this to St Martins, very good value for money and overall a relaxed atmosphere, as expected from a Morgans Hotel. Decent location. I did think the afternoon tea setting went against the hotel's grain, but people seemed to enjoy it, although the setting just wasn't for me. Bed was ridiculously comfortable and the hotel was extremely clean. We were on business and to be honest our particular room was very noisy over the weekend, but it certainly didn't effect our stay  (perhaps something to bear in mind if you're travelling with children).",4,2014,09,04
132,Fab!,"We booked this hotel not knowing anything about it.  We were advised it was a lovely hotel and trendy London place to socialise in.  We were in London for a special weekend with our 10 year old daughter.  The hotel from the road looked, in my husbands words, "" like an office block,"" but as soon as you stepped through the doors it couldn't have been more different. A calm oasis from the busy streets outside. The reception is full of weird and wonderful chairs. Our daughter made full use of these including shutting herself in the orange and beige box sculpture and taking selfies inside. The staff couldn't have been nicer or more helpful all weekend, even encouraging Grace to make the most of the reception area. 
The room was a deluxe king and was very impressive. Large very comfortable bed with a single but still lots of space to move about. Beautifully appointed bathroom suite. Large deep bath and separate massive shower. Decor was tasteful and modern, different to a lot of old London hotels.  Our space mad daughter also loved the lifts. 
We didn't use the restaurant but enjoyed a drink at the fabulous bar, again attentive staff and lovely Gin and Tonic.
We would love to stay at the Sanderson in the future, if you get a chance to stay at this modern London hotel you won't be disappointed.",5,2014,09,03
132,Such a fantastic hotel,"Great hotel, I have stayed here many times and I am never disappointed. 
Wonderful staff, food, ambience and the rooms are all different - very unique, modern and smart. Exactly what you would expect from a Philippe Starck hotel.",5,2014,09,02
132,Loved the sanderson!,"We went for our anniversary and we had a package with a bottle of bubbly, breakfast inc in the room rate. When we arrived we were greeted at the front desk and wished a happy anniversary, we made our way to the room in the coolest lifts I've ever seen, the room was unbelievable! Soo nice! The sleigh bed was huge and so comfy. The bathroom was amazing too. We settled in with the champagne (the bottle was £75 in a restaurant later that day, so not a cheap bottle) when we were ready for dinner we asked for a taxi and they said here, use the hotel car. Wow, ok!

We returned after a great meal and drinks when I called the front desk to ask when check out is, they replied that it's 11 but they can give us a late check out till 2. They also said as we're celebrating how about they send breakfast up to our room instead of us going down to the restaurant.  The service in this hotel was faultless! 

This is why I love morgans hotels, next one delano miami and mondrian NYC!",5,2014,09,01
132,Great party atmosphere!,"Stayed here with my sister. Room was quite small... As are most Schrager hotels. But interesting attention to detail. We went with the intention of using the hotel bars and not venturing out at night. It was great! 
Good mix of people. Different ages/nationalities. Good music and staff. Long Bar was packed! Want a seat? Get there early. Alternatively drink in the hotel guests members only bar. Watch out though... those drinks are s-trong!!! Played pool with some guests too. great night of fun.
Room service meal... delicious! A great hangover preventer!! Lots of it too.
Breakfast in the morning... Best Egg Benedict in the WORLD!! ",5,2014,09,01
132,Faultless!,"I booked our stay at the Sanderson hotel as a birthday treat for my boyfriend. We had an amazing time, made extra special by our beautiful room and the superb service received by all staff, in particular, Mike and Joey, the concierges. We both had fantastic massages at the Agua spa and wonderful cocktails in the beautiful and intimate Purple Bar. I would highly recommend this hotel, for couples especially.",5,2014,08,30
132,A home away from home... Always a pleasure!!!,"I've being staying at Morgan group hotels for the over 5 years now in London but also the US and I do so for good reason. The ability to make a guest feel at home is a true art and not to be underestimated none more so than the team at the Sanderson. 

The staff make this place... the guys on the front desk always make sure my requests are fulfilled and place me in a room which allows me to relax away from the hustle and bustle of the city. 

The decor is kept clean and crisp and nothing better than relaxing in the purple bar with a dry martini to wash away the days stress..

Thanks again Sanderson... I'll be back soon!",5,2014,08,29
132,Amazing,"As a travel agent, I recently escorted a group overseas and selected the Sanderson Hotel. I had advised the hotel of our early arrival and every room was ready and available. The accommodation is luxurious, spacious and beautifully appointed. The staff starting with the management to the great guys who greeted you at the door were all extremely friendly and helpful.
The location is ideal with easy access to the West End, Soho and Oxford Street.
I will have no hesitation in recommending it to my clients and personally  look forward to my next visit.",5,2014,08,28
132,5* service,"Stayed at the hotel recently in one of the Terrace suites, was given a warm welcome by Nigel Gardiner the duty manager. Room was great with outdoor space and lovely comfy bed. Complimentary champagne and chocolates went down a treat. Would definitely stay again highly recommended and thanks for the great service. A****",5,2014,08,28
132,Afternoon Tea...,"Myself and my girlfriend recently visited the Sanderson Hotel for the Alice in Wonderland themed afternoon tea. Food was great, service was very good and the ambiance was perfect.

My only niggle is that i feel as if the Alice in Wonderland theme could have been better! It needed more theatrics to make it an excellent visit!

Also The Long Bar is great for any cocktails you desire!",4,2014,08,27
132,Agua Spa - The best spa in London!,"My absolute go to place to escape the busyness of London life, Agua Spa is by far my favourite spa in London. The minimalist design and white curtains from ceiling to floor make it feel almost heavenly and the staff are always very attentive and extremely knowledgable. Not only just a place to relax, they offer some of the most advanced treatments and the best therapists in their field including the amazing Eve Lom (if you haven't already, you must book the Eve Lom experience which is truly amazing!). 

The relaxation room provides a relaxing space to unwind before or after treatments with refreshments and magazines provided. My favourite though has to be the individual relaxation rooms which house huge soft arm chairs that you can lie flat on to relax, read magazines or watch your own private tv. They even serve healthy lunches and refreshments here which is a dream. I have frequented many spas in London and know of no other that offers this - if your looking for some serious me time this is the place to go!

You can also use the gym and steam room on your visit and unlike most other London spas, the facilities here are never overcrowded. I would highly rate every service I have experienced here since I first visited the spa seven years ago. Although I have tried many other spas in London, nothing compares to the Agua Spa for a true escape. Enjoy!",5,2014,08,27
132,Great Location,"booked this hotel on Secret Escapes, it was lovely, check in was really quick and efficient , staff very pleasant, rooms ready at 11.30 which was a bonus. The rooms are very clean, modern, and have everything you need. the bed really comfy, towels really good quality, nothing I could fault with the rooms. The lifts are quirky/ fun. Went to the Purple bar in the evening for a drink very small and dimly lit, but made up for it later on when we went back to the Long Bar which was buzzing and really good. Drinks are London prices. Breakfast was good but could have done with being a little hotter. Check out was really quick and the bill 100% Would highly recommend.The location was fantastic only a five minute walk  from the bus and tube.",5,2014,08,26
132,excellent two-night stay at a great location,"My partner and I have stayed at Sanderson many times before, so the time has come to leave a review. We absolutely loved all our stays there. It's such a special place, with an incredible, sophisticated yet artsy vibe to it. The staff are absolutely the best - great customer service across the spectrum. Oh, and the bathtub... We LOVE!",5,2014,08,26
132,Fantastic business stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights (Weds 20th and Thurs 21st Aug) as part of a business trip to London, and what a fantastic stay the team at the Sanderson delivered. 
Not only did they go out of their way to secure us a large number of rooms at short notice, but delivered a first class experience for all of us at FPP.
The rooms were modern, impeccably clean, and as comfortable as I've stopped in.
I'm sure to be back again, and hope the high praise finds its way to all the staff involved during our stay.
",5,2014,08,25
132,Amazing SPA,"I had the best SPA experience ever, it felt proper luxury. The whole pack was flawless, I can't wait to go back, the massage was perfect and then I got to relax at the sauna, the best birthday present!",5,2014,08,24
132,Amazing Coktail Bar,"They have an amazing atmosphere! My favorite place in the center of London to enjoy a couple of Coktails in a great ambient and with a really nice music. 
The staff is very kind and always very friendly. Also the design is so good, I really love the reception.",5,2014,08,24
132,Consistently brilliant!,"Despite now living in the US and not being able to get to the Sanderson as much.. I always look forward to my home away from home in London. Nigel the Asst desk manager and Phil on the door are formidable! They know everyone's names and you can see how the guests are often repeat because they love the treatment.

This is a place made special by the staff and not just the trendy decor.

The breakfast is fantastic too!

",5,2014,08,22
132,For the Modern Traveler x,"A Phillipe Starck designed hotel, Sanderson Hotel is definitely an eye candy. 

Those luscious red lips in the main lobby is an attraction in itself. The furniture and fixtures around in the hotel lobby and bar alone was enough to make you feel like you're surrounded by art. It was tastefully done, and not too overwhelming. 

Check-in was easy, and the ride up to the room was such a thrill. The elevator replicates a time-travelling experience to space with the galactic ambience. Your senses were definitely tickled from the moment you stepped into the hotel all the way to your room. 

The room design was simple, and I appreciate the curtains adding a soft touch to the chrome and silver finishing of the room. The amenities were Malin and Goetz -- complimented the hotel experience. There was a small drawer of bathroom convenient items that is available for purchase if you forgot to pack your shaving kit. 

The mini bar is well stocked. Pricey, but that's a general rule when it comes to mini bar prices I suppose. 

I ordered breakfast, which came in a timely manner. It was delicious and the minimal plating wasn't annoying (for once!) The little corner table is perfect to get work done in the room before going out. 

Unfortunately for me, I didn't get a chance to try out the Madhatters Tea Party, but just by the looks of it, it looked lovely! Definitely something I'll like to try the next time I'm in London. 

Generally, pleased with my stay. I wished I took more time to jot down the name of the Concierge whom I've had the pleasure of interacting over the phone with, who was really understanding of a slight extension for a Late Check Out. The follow up call and the reprogrammed key cards were anticipated and definitely made it less of a hassle. The reminder call from Front Desk that I will be charged if I didn't leave the room and someone else needed my room could have been managed well. I didn't need to be made to feel like I was not as important as your next paying guest. But hey, I guess business is business.",4,2014,08,21
132,Perfect and cool as hell,"This is my goto place in London. Vibe is cool and laid back. Staff are great.  Nigel the assistant front office manager was great and is a gentleman and I always look out for him everytime I arrive. 

Will be back again next month",5,2014,08,19
132,"Superb, what more could you want","We have stayed here many times. Decent room rates, excellent bar, superb location. Whether you want a cosy night in.....check out the purple bar & try the many martinis or sit outside in the garden courtyard with a bottle of wine or two!",5,2014,08,18
132,Faultless!!,"I simply can not praise this hotel enough. From the moment you walk through the doors (opened for you of course) you are treated as if you are royalty. I happened to mention in passing that it was my birthday and that evening a beautiful desert and gift with a personal message was delivered. I had my year old nephew with me and staff were so thoughtful and all his needs catered for. Our stay was summed up when I happened to ask at breakfast for something and the response was "" of course, anything is possible"" and at the Sanderson it really feels like it is. Thank you for making our stay so very special and see you again soon.",5,2014,08,18
132,Good Choice!,"My husband and I recently celebrated our wedding at The Sanderson Hotel and we couldn't be more pleased with our choice of venue.  

Bennoit was so helpful in the run up to the big day.  Always replying promptly to our calls, making useful suggestions and even liaising with reservation to help us book our accommodation for the evening.

On the day Rafael introduced himself as soon as we arrived and made us feel very welcome.  He oversaw the whole day and made sure everything went seamlessly.  The Malaysian food from suka was delicious and went down very well with our guest, half of whom are Malaysian so tough critics and portions where more than generous.  

In the evening we stayed in a balcony loft room which again I would recommend, the balcony was perfect place to relax and enjoy the last bottle of champagne :-p.",5,2014,08,18
132,Quirky and different,"Myself and my daughter stayed here at the beginning of July for a couple of nights. We didn't get off to a great start as when I chanced asking if we could check in early after a horrendous delayed journey down to London, we were originally told that it shouldn't be a problem. Over an hour later however it would appear that it was in fact a problem and I think reception kept forgetting about us! However once we eventually got in to our room, we were pleasantly surprised at the amount of space and quirky design of the whole place. We have stayed in a lot of nice hotels and I have to say, this beats a lot of them on the sheer space. I also have to comment on the beds and how incredibly comfortable they are which again is rare! Myself and my daughter had a queen size each and it was fabulous! The actual bathroom and changing areas are unusual and a clever design and the whole modern, white and light colour scheme, with clever lighting, was very relaxing and lovely. The only thing was our electric curtain used to seperate areas, never worked! I absolutely loved the turn down service with the little tea light being lit on entering your room at night! I however was not as keen on the very dark corridors to all the rooms.
The reception area is fun and a great design, as is the bar area and pretty courtyard.
We in fact booked the Mad Hatter's Afternoon Tea here but we were abit underwelmed with it to be honest! The whole look of it is fabulous but unfortunately it is style over substance and extremely expensive. I strongly believe that if you are staying as a guest in this hotel, then asking for a 15% surcharge for afternoon tea is a disgrace! This was the only real negative I have on my whole stay and I would return but would not book afternoon tea again. 
",4,2014,08,18
132,It's sexy and it knows it!,"Now it's time to be a Rockstar. Thanks to Mister Stark, the design will engage your imagination. You'll be loving it from the moment you step in the lobby, then you'll get dizzy in the darkish elevator and you'll be totally seduced by the rooms. The long bar is a funky jam with lovely crowd after 6 pm and the pool table is something that you'll love to have in your club room. It's sexy, it's cool, it's unforgettable!",5,2014,08,17
132,A great weekend,"Stayed at Sanderson friday to sunday, on check in staff very friendly and attentive Bellman parked car and delivered luggage to room, i had a newly refurbished room on 4th floor , room very clean and practical,turn down service in the evening, Bar and Restaurant  excellent, and good atmosphere in the Long Bar.",5,2014,08,17
132,Hip and Trendy,"This ultra modern chic hotel is pretty cool.  Expensive dining is okay, but the ambiance makes you feel like a rock star.  Bed was comfortable and bathroom modern yet functional.  Room was small.  Dark psychedelic elevators whisk you to dark hallways.  Beautiful staff greets you in the lobby.  Nice bar closes too early.",4,2014,08,14
132,"Design, Style & Service","When Sanderson first arrived on the scene as a purveyor of hotel design, the ""beautiful people"" they focussed upon hiring had an attitude to match, but things have changed a lot in the last 5-6 years and the focus is very service orientated.  Design, Style and Service can be achieved with the right focus and a little training.

If quirky hotel design is your thing, then Sanderson is certainly one for you, and one that has an interesting history as a home for textiles, which the hotel designer played upon.  Cool and laid back, the cocktails are some of the best in London and the terrace is an ideal way to spend the afternoon.",5,2014,08,13
132,Cool boutique hotel in the heart of London ,"We've just come back from our ray at the Sanderson and were totally blown away. Service is great, decor is really cool and the room looked like something from an LA film star's house - all glass walls and drapes. The long bar is great for cocktails and really popular. If you stay here you also have to try the Mad Hatters afternoon tea. It's set in their amazing outdoor terrace/ court yard and the theme is very clever. We loved it. ",5,2014,08,13
132,Great Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel for two nights at the beginning of August and what a treat.  I loved the decor including the rooms - I have never stayed anywhere like it. The lifts are brilliant!  It is in an excellent position close to Oxford Street and theatreland.The staff were very helpful and friendly.  Would love to stay here again, really great hotel.",5,2014,08,12
132,Beautifully modern and yet still practical!,"This is one of the most fabulous hotels I have ever stayed in. The warm welcome at reception, the fabulous cocktails whilst we waited for our room (there are worse ways wait!) to the beautiful loft terrace bedroom, which is stunning....oh and how could I forget the extremely exciting lift...I could have spent hours in there!
The decor is stylishly modern and yet the rooms remain practical and liveable, for example the bedroom is open plan however there are practical curtains to shelter your modesty...even with your nearest and dearest you still need you time.
The thing that really makes this 5 star is the little details, the indulgent linen, the fabulous maintenance of the rooms by housekeeping, the powerful hairdryer, the electricity plug next to the large mirrors, etc, so many hotels forget that although beauty is appreciated people actually need to live in these spaces...this has not been forgotten at Sanderson.
This is a stunning hotel and I look forward to the next opportunity to come to stay again...seriously any excuse and we shall return.",5,2014,08,11
132,Fabulous Hotel!!!,"Stayed at the Sanderson in July, super cool edgy design, fantastic location just behind Oxford Street, the Staff at the Sanderson couldn't have been more helpful.
A really great Hotel, and a really enjoyable stay.",5,2014,08,11
132,The dilapidation of the Sanderson Hotel in London,"Who could forget the undeniable glory of the Sanderson Hotel in London when it launched. It was the hippest place to be in a city that’s not short of hip spots. It was the top in unscale modernity with the famous faces walking in and out and the best fashion events and after-events happening on its premises. The decor what out of this world, capturing modern design with some appropriately placed kitsch pieces symbolized quintessentially with the large red lips sofa places directly by the front entrance ready to greet you upon arrival.

However, this glory is long gone. On a recent trip to london we opted to stop for a short time at the hotel to give it the review we thought it deserves, upon arrival the door staff we extremely friendly, but for there on it was downhill. The reception took us longer than expect and when we informed them we are here to review the hotel, they didn’t even bat an eyelid. We booked online and just by judging from our names they labelled our country on the check-in application as “UAE” without even asking. I guess all Arabs look the same to them. As person who has stayed in the hotel a couple of years ago, I know how it has changed.

There’s nothing to say here other than the place has gotten worse with age. The rooms amenities show singes of ageing and some didn’t work, the floor carpet (which was horrendous to begin with, more suitable for Vegas hotel) is tattered. The first room we got wreaked of cigarette smoke, when we asked for a room change we were given a smaller room and told that the smell was that of a chemical cleaner (even worse). The curtains has matured to say the least and the internet connection was much slower than another hotel we were at in the same area.

It’s sad to see such a hotel deteriorate in quality. it was such an iconic hotel in London, however now it has dilapitation with the same attire it came in. No investment in new creative ideas or atmospheric changes. At least the elevator is still fun, but that’s about it. The prices are still sky high, too.  The drinks aren’t even as well mixed as before, from what we remember.

132,Modern edgy contemporary,"Pros: Friendly helpful staff
Nice decor very very modern
The purple lounge with in crowd and socialites
Close to a popular nightclub
Breakfast was fantastic! They had varieties and staff were nice 
Cons: not child friendly kept bumping ones head in artistic decor and mirrors
Very loud bar you could hear the noise from your rooms
The corridors were dark.....
The view is not too great was facing an office building",4,2014,08,10
132,"Great location, high quality, trendy hotel","Recently stayed at the Sanderson for a week in London on business.  The location is fantastic - right off Oxford St bordering Soho and the West End.  It's on a pretty peaceful st even though it's so close to Oxford St.  Very close access to the Central Line on the tube.

Everything about the hotel is very modern as you would expect from an Ian Schrager hotel.  Definitely trendy, and on Thursday night the bar area was pretty loud and vibrant.  The room design is really nice - comfortable bed, small sitting area, nice bathroom.

Breakfast at the hotel was good, I did not have any other meals at the restaurant.

Service was also excellent - the concierge had good restaurant recommendations and was able to call restaurants on my behalf to check for availability.

I don't think this hotel is for everyone - again, it's very trendy.  I wouldn't really recommend it as a family destination, but it depends on the age of your children.  My one complaint would be that my room was on the second floor facing the courtyard and noise / music from the bar could be heard, but wasn't too bad.  It did not prohibit me from sleeping.",4,2014,08,07
132,Contemporary concept hotel,"Generally: The staff here were lovely, very kind and amenable; the location is great for downtown London, I ran to Hyde Park within 10 minutes and it's right off Oxford St and yet it's quiet and peaceful; the rooms were ethereal and calming, the breakfast was delicious and the spa is really wonderful. The spa is in the adjoining building in a listed historic building which used to be a curtain showroom. The adaptive reuse of the building is perfect, super cool and very relaxing, plus the staff were great. All in all, this is a cool, chic hotel in great shape with a great vibe. 

Important note, which may or may not affect stay: I stayed here with a friend with no knowledge of what it would be like before I arrived. The name gave me the idea of a traditional old school London hotel, but it was nothing like it. The building is a rehabbed 1960s perspex type, which has been renovated into a cool, hip interior. It's very modern, and very 'concept', which I think a lot of older and more traditional people wouldn't love, the hotel seems to be trying a *little* bit too hard to be cool. The public spaces are very dark, the floors are lit only by lights at the base of the doors with the room number. The lifts threw me off since they are decorated with holographic type universe  motifs, and are completely dark, which might be disorienting. The rooms and fittings are so modern, that they're a little beyond practical use. The taps are beautiful chrome branches, but they were impossible to close once your hands were wet, which they usually are once you wash them. The lighting was so complicated that we couldn't even find the off switch for one of the lights in the bathroom and just left it on all night, which was a little hard to sleep with (but we could have called and asked, that was our own stubbornness.) 

SO, if you're not looking for a traditional hotel, but want something more cutting edge and super cool, then this may be for you. The stay was great, and very different from regular hotels, and the staff were very kind. Also the spa is worth a visit, just for the beautiful atmosphere.",4,2014,08,06
132,"Quirky, convenient and overall an enjoyable stay","Stayed at the hotel for 23 nights on a business trip.  This was my first stay in the area, having previously stayed in the city area/canary wharf. 

Location
The hotel is located between two Underground stations - Oxford Circus and Tottenham Court Road.  The hotel is within 7-10 mins walk to either stations and the cool summer weather makes for an enjoyable stroll in the morning.  The hotel is conveniently located near nice restaurants such as Roka along Charlotte Street and within walking distance to Chinatown (down Berners Street straight towards Soho and onwards - 15 mins).  Getting nice and reasonably-priced food is not a problem while the shopping streets (Oxford/Regent/Bond) are all short walks away.  I was working in the city and had to commute which was also very convenient given Bank is 4 stops/10mins from Tottenham Court on the Central Line.  I can walk to artsy Covent Garden (15mins) or take the tube down to Waterloo via Northern Line very easily.
   
Room and Facilities
I was surprised by the huge layout of the reception area, in-house dining area and the gym.  Hotels in the city tend to be smaller whereas this was a pleasant surprise.  I was given a deluxe area which overlooks a small street but could be noisy in the late night/early morning.  I have read reviews about the rooms above the dining and courtyard and was initially not pleased with a first floor allocation. But I did not get any noise from the courtyard or bar even though it could be very noisy coming through the hotel doors.  I see that there are rooms which either face the courtyard (nice view) or the streets.  I could imagine courtyard facing rooms to be disturbed on Fri/weekend nights.

The deluxe room was huge!  A friend came by and was also very surprised and interested by the layout.  The toiletries were replenished on a timely basis with daily fresh clean towels a standard feature.  The bed was very comfortable and the TV came with many channels (including Sky Sports!).

The gym is also very well equipped and I used the gym every 2-3 days.  There are treadmills for running, stationary bikes and free weights.  The room is spacious and you may find 5-6 people using the equipments every morning yet one does not feel congested.  There is a meeting room on the same level (first floor) and a nice-looking spa which I, unfortunately did not get to use.  There is also a relaxation area with a pool table just next to the lift lobby which was surprisingly hardly used.  

Service
The upgrade to a deluxe room was a good start!  Staff there are generally very nice and approachable, keeping the distance while maintaining friendliness if you need any help.  The room is kept clean and there is daily replenishment of bottled water.  I do find room service to be a little slower than expected given the huge in-house restaurant (about 20-30 mins).  Laundry services were exceptional though the shirts were returned late by a day and I had to call for a delivery on another separate occasion.  One gripe I have is with the replenishment of the cotton buds and tissue boxes.  I had only a pair of cotton buds which was used by day 2 and this was not replenished for the following 3 weeks.  However if this is the main problem, I think the hotel has done very well!",5,2014,08,06
132,Modern Refurbishment,"A very modern refurbishment. The rooms are very attractive. Very modern very chic. Very attractive bedroom design with glass sections to bathroom, shower and facilities. All can be curtained for privacy. Quality design with quality fittings.
The hotel lobby is attractive as is the bar area.
The Purple bar ...well an acclaimed design but reminded me of 1960's ballrooms....
The restaurant....well it will not be everyones taste.
Customer service excellent. The bedrooms excellent and quality of refurbishment well done.
Its all about individual taste.
The lifts are a ""must do""....you think you are in the planitarium....different and a very modern touch.
Overall great hotel....different and msy not be everyones taste but certainly great modern experience.",4,2014,08,06
132,Fabulous stay,"This Hotel is a wonderful place to stay, close to Soho yet very peaceful to retreat to after a wild night out. Our room was so comfortable and spacious with a wonderful  spacious bed and generous fluffy feather pillows. The décor was chic and very relaxing and overall the service was excellent. The atmosphere in the bar was bustling and we enjoyed a few drinks in the outdoor space before heading up to our very quiet and well planned room.",5,2014,08,05
132,Mostly excellent!,"Stayed for 2 nights Saturday and Sunday, great quirky hotel in a great location. Rooms were great nice and clean and nicely furnished. There was a great atmosphere in the long bar on Saturday afternoon and evening. The disappointing things were the late check in, rooms weren't ready until 4.45, almost two hours late, this resulted in us having to wait at the bar, whilst pleasant also expensive! Also the breakfast was poor and overpriced full English and eggs benedict both arrived cold after about half an hour, we didn't send them back as they had taken so long to arrive. If you stay in this hotel, go out for Breakfast and all will be good. Staff were really friendly.",4,2014,08,05
132,"Great hotel, friendly staff, cool setting.","We stayed for 2 nights over the weekend, great location very central. Modern hotel with a trendy feel, I was worried it would not be child friendly, but they were all really good with my 4 year old.  Great breakfast nice meal in the restaurant, tea looked amazing but we didn't have time to try. Bar was busy on Saturday night, but didn't hear any noise on our 3rd floor room.",4,2014,08,05
132,First Class service,Stayed at this amazing hotel for my girlfriends b'day .. Amazing welcome by the front desk ( Jay Jay ) who had was happy to help in the secret celebration .. Room was amazing and spacious with everything you need in a very minimal but cool .. Great welcome at the bar and lovely outside eating area although it seemed to have many hen nights booked in Saturday afternoon and if I am honest allowing the ladies to wear fancy dress and wigs brings the tone of this amazing hotel down .. I would advise against .. But maybe i'm being a bit unfair .. All in all I would recommend to anybody and if you have any pre checking requests do so before arriving as the process is easier .. Can't thank the staff enough ( They know what they did ),5,2014,07,30
132,My stay at The Sanderson,"I stayed at the Sanderson on Saturday and it was beautful. The staff were friendly, helpful accomodating.  I felt very spoilt and it was amazing!!!! 
The rooms were clean, fresh, very modern and had everything you need and even if you forget its in there already!  I would have preferred a wardrobe rather than hanging my clothes in the bathroom but it does suit the rooms decor. You cant help but feel special when your a guest. 

I highly recommend the Sanderson for all occasions.

Only negative I would say is dont opt for breakfast - £18 gave you 1 sausage, bacon that was so overdone it crumbled, eggs not cooked as requested and beans cold and took over 35 minutes to arrive.",4,2014,07,28
132,Continues to get better!,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Sanderson again last month while I was in London for work.  This property continues to get better.  I stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms, and absolutely loved it.  The sitting area was perfect for doing some work or just having coffee in the morning.  

The room was really spacious, and I love the minimal, whilte, clean decor of the Sanderson rooms.  If you are someone who likes traditional style, then this will not be your cup of tea.  The ammenities are by Malin & Goetz, one of my favorite niche brands.  What seals the deal for the Sanderson every time is the staff.  The entire team is fantastic.  A huge shout out to Nigel, Cam and Hendrike!  They made my stay so special, including giving me excellent recommendations for dinner.  I discovered amazing new places in a city I have come to know really well.

From the moment you walk in to the Sanderson you are just transported into a different world.  I loved coming back to the property at the end of long day.  Breakfast is fantastic (great spread!) and was included with my room package.  

The location is one of the best for getting around to all parts of Central London.  I travel often to this city and also stayed a few times at the Langham (which is also excellent).  However, I have to say that the Sanderson has won me over and will be my base for future trips to London.  Only have really positive things to say about this property.",5,2014,07,27
132,Best Hotel in London,"Excellent service from the doormen, reception, concierge,baby sitting facilities!! Perfect location, great ambience!! Free internet, water, newspaper are always a bonus plus with a good variety of tv selections (including internet channels).",5,2014,07,27
132,Just ok,"For the price they charge would expect a bit more,poor lighting in the rooms and corridors,staff abrupt,on the whole just ok but next time back to the Mayfair as they know what is required by guests,£310 per night then £30 each for breakfast is a liberty.
On a plus side bed fantastic and spotless,just one other downside no plug in the sink!! For us wet shavers that's always handy.",3,2014,07,27
132,Looks are deceptive! A different world inside.,"Stayed here during the week and had a suite with a roof garden, which was a super space - loft size, relaxing and well equipped although the see-thru furniture covered in veils is a little difficult to navigate - as are the electric blinds. 
Make sure you see the library and use the inner courtyard which is wonderful. 

Many people were booking horse rides in the city with reception and you should try that.

Breakfast was lovely but not included.

The location is fantastic. Ideal for my meetings during that trip.

All in all great hotel, good service but at this price there is lots of choice so I'll be trying others before returning.",5,2014,07,26
132,Excellent Service at the Sanderson,"We stayed at the Sanderson for one night on the 19th of July. They have clearly put a lot of thought and expense into disguising what is a very average building in central London. When you walk in you are hit by the trendy decor, the impressive layout and the well designed courtyard and restaurant. The hall ways are dark but when you open your room door it's white bright and super trendy. I treated my wife to afternoon tea for her birthday and she couldn't speak highly enough of the quality. JJ on reception organised a bottle of Cava to be delivered to the room while we were out and is an example of how good and in tune with the guests the staff are. My only feedback would be in the evening the bar was really busy and apart from the cocktail bar there was no where to really sit and chill out. It was either stand at the busy bar or sit at the restaurant table. As we checked out I advised I had a bottle of beer from the mini bar, but I also advised I think the fridge may have been broken as nothing in there was cold. I was only mentioning it so they can fix it and not complaining. The lady on reception advised the beer was on them as no one likes a warm beer and removed it from the bill. 
I have stayed in many London hotels and I get used to the very corporate service staff provide. This was still professional but so personal.  Keep up the good work as clearly your staff are happy at work which makes for a great customer experience.",5,2014,07,24
132,Nice and fresh with a great court yard,"Quite anynomous from the outside, however, very fresh immediately when stepping inside. A really cool bar and a superb court yard at the ground floor. Perfect for a cocktail in the summer. 
Friendly staff, good service. 
Rooms are quite spacious. Delicate and minimalistic style. Big bathrooms, no bath tub (at least not in my room) 
Location is good, however not exceptionally. Of course depending on your criterias. Very good if you are doing meetings in the City, not so good in terms of the main shopping districts if you prefer walking distance.
Alot of good restaurants nearby. Rooms a bit more than average expensive even for London, but you do get the feeling of staying at a five star hotel.
Would go back.
",4,2014,07,22
132,Fabulous hotel - extremely great staffing and decor,"Simply put, no need to look elsewhere. 

I've stayed at this hotel twice and similar experiences both times. Staff is excellent, very helpful, especially the doorman. The hotel rooms are sparkly clean, great atmosphere and nice decor. 

The lobby is spacious and lovely as well. 

The hotel is also convenient - quick 5 min walk to the Tottenham Court subway. 

I strongly recommend.",5,2014,07,22
132,"Fantastic hotel - service, location, amenities.","Morgan's Group is without a doubt the best boutique group out there. Never disappointed by their level of service, beautiful rooms and amazing locations. Would never stay anywhere else in London. Their hotels in NYC are also my preference.",5,2014,07,18
132,Good in parts,"We stayed here for one night so we could try the Mad Hatters afternoon tea.  When we arrived at check-in time, we were told our room was not ready (we have had this in so many London hotels, it's ridiculous).  After waiting ten minutes in the not at all comfortable reception area (more like a pretentious art gallery), the receptionist came over and said it would be another ten minutes.  When I remonstrated, she gave us two vouchers for cocktails in the bar.  This definitely helped alleviate my anger!

We were in a King Deluxe and it was a reasonable size, all clean.  However, there is so much glass (and white curtains), that I constantly felt I was going to walk into the glass, particularly when entering and exiting the bathroom.  The room was definitely designed with style not comfort in mind.  You cannot watch the tv from anywhere in the room but the bed, not from the sofa.  The sofa is not comfortable for two people to sit on and the only hanging rail is in the bathroom so clothes do feel slightly damp sometimes.  Also the windows were absolutely filthy, inside and out!

Afternoon tea was good, a fun experience.  The outside seating area is lovely, especially at night when it is lit by candles and you can really appreciate the water feature.  We had cocktails in this area late at night and it was stunning, easily the best part of the hotel.  Cocktails are excellent and the bar staff friendly.

Breakfast was a bit disappointing.  We ordered eggs benedict and both found that our eggs were overcooked.  On the menu it said that it would come with toast but we were presented with a bill instead.  When I requested the toast, the waiter seemed very put out.

Not a bad stay but there are better hotels around at this price point.",4,2014,07,17
132,Wonderful experience at The Sanderson,"We recently stayed at the Sanderson Hotel and we were overwhelmed by the courteous and friendly welcome received upon arrival, booking in was done with ease with no problems and the staff were very efficient and we were made to feel very welcome.

We found the super king sized bed to be very comfortable. I loved the modern decor which just made our family feel totally relaxed. We were given clear instructions as to how to use the air conditioner and the TV which also has connections for wi-fi, ipad and usb.

We experienced the High Tea and this equally was a wonderful experience in wonderful surroundings with very pleasant and experienced staff, a real treat with exquisite cakes and sandwiches.",5,2014,07,15
132,Favorite Boutique Hotel in Lodon,"We stayed already tree times in this hotel. Excellent service, beautiful rooms, nice bar / restaurant and a relaxing spa area. It is not too quiet - the bar is a popular place in the evening. We are looking forward to be your guests again!",5,2014,07,09
132,Perfect base for shopping and partying,"I was initially underwhelmed by the rooms but my appreciation for the white billowy curtains grew over my 4  day stay. The bathroom is well appointed with nice toiletries. The bed was amazingly comfy and I slept very well under the crisp white sheets.

Only an automatic curtain separating the room and the bathroom so no space to be shy!

The three points that made the hotel wow for me:
Location- walking distance from London's shopping, eating and partying hotspots.
Concierge- can get you on the guest list for pretty much any club you fancy.
Hotel's Purple Bar- exclusive for residence. We had very late night drinks with a very famous pop star who was in town and he even picked up our bill...what a Jamaican gentlemen!

Oh and even if you don't have a treatment the spa has an amazing steam room which is complimentary for residents and is a must! If you use to watch Absolutely Fabulous it will remind you of a very funny episode where Edina is dreaming :).",5,2014,07,04
132,Modern Hip Hotel in great location with excellent service,"This Hotel is part of the Morgans Group of Hotels, we have stayed at their hotel in New York and had high expectations, we were not disappointed. Despite a debacle over an email summer offer we received , the hotel management quickly sorted the matter out and sorted the reservation out for us. We stayed for two nights Fri/sat at the end of June. Hotel is about 15 mins from Kings Cross in a cab - location is excellent, hotel reception organised, young and professional, foyer is very trendy. Our large room was ready and we found we had been upgraded to one of the newly refurbished superior king room, which were very modern, chic and comfortable, with large roll top bed, there is no real view from the room, but the room makes up for it, bath and shower facilities excellent. Wifi was strong. We could not fault the room in any way it was big, modern and very comfortable and deserves a 5 star rating. The hotel does a mad hatters afternoon tea, which although we did not experience, looked fantastic and was very busy as was the bar, staff looked organised and professional and all very courteous and willing to assist. We had a breakfast package included and have to say the breakfast, which is served to you once ordered with a combination of a continental breakfast of help yourself suited us and was fine. The location of the hotel is superb, there are lots of local bistros, restaurants cafes to choose from within 2 mins walking, Covent Garden, Oxford and Regent street all easily within 5 minutes walking  distance. The street the hotel is located on is clean, quiet and smart.
Overall I would highly recommend this hotel as a 5 star boutique hotel and on our next visit to London we will stay again.",5,2014,07,03
132,Great refurb - now one of the best,"I wrote a review a few months when I gave it 4 stars and talked about the staff being great but the rooms now quite getting it right. 'Hunt the plug socket' was an annoying game, the rooms were too white and the shower flooding the floor was just a pain

Anyway, I am delighted to say the hotel is being refurbished now and the new rooms are a massive step on.  The colouring is a little less stark, there is a comfy seat to sit in and the plug socket situation is largely remedied!  The staff remain as great as ever so while the shower flooding situation is still annoying it would seem churlish to mark it down a star just for that.  I find it hard to decide between here and The Edition when in this part of London as the best place to stay but neither will disappoint.",5,2014,07,03
132,Happy to Come Back,I love staying at the Sanderson. I havent been able to fault the service in all my stays so far and I will be back again in July. In June I was a little disappointed with the room refurbs. Nice little touches like the ceiling paintings have vanished. Hope that these come back. Phil the Bell Captain and his team always seem to go that extra yard in ensuring I'm properly taken care of and Jon at front desk needs to be commended for his patience dealing with my bills. I still love the Long Bar but the Purple Bar is a nice respite when the Long Bar is getting a bit boisterous. Looking forweard to being back again soon.,5,2014,07,02
132,Amazing!!!!!,"My husband and I stayed at the Sanderson last Saturday for our wedding anniversary and it was amazing!! When we arrived we were greeted by the really polite and friendly doormen. Quick and easy check in and we were upgraded free if charge, which was a surprise. All staff are very friendly, especially in the Long Bar and purple bar, can actually have some (drunken on my part) chats compared to some other london hotels! Not pretentious one bit!!! Hotel itself is gorgeous very modern and beautifully decorated. Prices are a bit steep in bars but as to be expected in London. Long Bar has brilliant atmosphere with DJ and meet some lovely people. Will definitely be returning for our next anniversary! Xxx",5,2014,06,21
132,Renovated Room - What a Joke,"We stayed for one night in a deluxe room. £574 inc VAT...

The Air Conditioning was totally inadequate.  we had a most uncomfortable, sleepless night.  The A/C was working but only one small outlet in a large room.

Only wardrobe was a hanging rail in the bathroom - result....damp clothes.

The hot tap on the shower was almost inoperable unless you had super-strength and dry hands...!!  Don't they test the rooms regularly?....obviously not.

No Razor socket

1 tiny body wash, 1 tiny shampoo, 1 tiny conditioner, 1 tiny body lotion - 2 people.  Had to ring down for more body wash.  It was freely available but do you want to wait for this when you've decided to have a shower? Is this 5*....I think not.

No Turndown Service.

Room rates quoted without VAT - nobody does that these days.

I was horrified to be told on departure that this was a newly renovated room.  Somebody needs firing..!!

The staff were really great but this is not the only factor that makes a great hotel.

There are many decent, genuine, sincere 5* hotels in London (I've stayed in most of them) This isn't one of them.

I must declare that I received a 15% discount on my bill. Was it a nice gesture?...yes.  Will it encourage me to stay there again?...no.  I want to be assured of a comfortable night's sleep.  I don't think I'll get it at The Sanderson",2,2014,06,19
132,"Agua Spa Review - Amazing Experience, can't wait to return","My sister-in-law and I recently enjoyed a day at the Agua Spa and enjoyed it so much, we are in the process of booking again at the end of August.  We both had a treatment for the end of the day so arrived around lunchtime to enjoy the facilities.  

Once you get out of the lift you breathe a sigh of relief as you realise you've arrived - the amazing smell and feel hits you as soon as you enter the beautiful white interior of the spa.  The desk staff are lovely and friendly, though do advise you once you've arrived that it's a quiet zone, so you spend the whole time whispering, which we found surprisingly easy! 

Once the forms are filled out we were shown to a our 'pamper pod', which was this gorgeous area just for two.  With two day beds, loads of lovely duvets and pillows, individual lights and magazines - we were really impressed as usually you have to fight over space in the 'relaxation rooms'.  The dressing/shower rooms are equally impressive - spacious individual areas with showers, dressing tables and lovely toiletries, all which seemed to be replenished very regularly.  You're given a locker key and the locker holds your slippers and dressing gown.

There's no pool or jacuzzi at the Sanderson, just a steam room, but it really doesn't seem to matter.  We had a really relaxing time in our pamper pod and ordered lunch - the menu is short but has really lovely options - I had the tuna tartare and my sister in law had the turkey.  I was expecting the dishes to be expensive but they were both under £10.  We both also had a smoothie - both were delicious.  The lunch was delivered to the pod and all set up between our day beds, we barely had to move!

After lunch we had a steam and then it was pretty much time for our treatments.  I had the Vit C Bisse facial which was divine - I dozed off a couple of times and my skin was glowing afterwards.  My sister in law had a massage which she said was really good.  

The main thing about the Agua Spa though is the experience itself - it's so calm and relaxing and so are the staff.  Everything seems to be done effortlessly and you leave with a real spring in your step.  I've been before and just had an Eve Lom facial without using any of the facilities, but the full experience was definitely worth it.   The treatments are on the expensive side even for 5* London hotel - for example, the same Eve Lom facial is available at Spa NK in Notting Hill for about £30 less and is just as good, albeit not in the same surroundings - still good though! 

That said, it's become my favourite spa in London and I can't wait to go back in a couple of months!",5,2014,06,16
132,Quirky buzzing hotel,"The Sanderson offers a great location from the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street and is an intriguing hotel. The quirky design features are interesting especially the thoughtfully placed furniture in the lobby area, the snooker table in a room with a magnificent stained glass window, the trendy Long Bar and the amazing lifts that make you feel like Charlie in the Great Glass Elevator! Billed as a Boutique hotel, it's fits the bill on its quirky styling, but in my opinion it's too large to be listed as this type of hotel with 150 rooms. The Long bar is buzzing and obviously a popular place to go for the London crowd so the Purple bar for residents (or those with reservations) is a welcome retreat. The atmosphere is very chilled and dark! It takes a while to get acclimatised to the room so to see the innovative cocktail menu it has to be viewed with the assistance of the light from a mobile phone! Having said that the bartender was very helpful and attentive, making cocktail recommendations based on your preferences and provided a couple of drinks that were sublime (although an accompanying nibble wouldn't have gone a miss). 
The bedroom was a good size and continues with the minimalistic feel. The bed was large and comfy with plump pillows that almost wrap around your head as you lean on them. As asset with regards to sound proofing mind as our room was on the first floor and right above the courtyard area, so there was noise from the busy bar and the constant bass beat from the music until the early hours of the morning. There's plenty of storage and space in the room including the bathroom however ""the Ingenious design touches of the whimsical aesthetic of Philippe Starck"" made me feel like I was staying in a private hospital room (the voile curtains in particular). It's all quite clinical. 
Staff were all very pleasant and welcoming with no exception. Check in/out was efficient, service in the bar and at breakfast was good as was house- keeping when we made a late night call for a cup of tea. There's no facilities in the room but are promptly provided on request.  
Breakfast was included in our package and there was a good selection on offer including a choice of coffee. 
I'd have no objection to staying another night at this hotel although it's pricey.",4,2014,06,08
132,Über cool luxury,"The Sanderson is sublime. You are surrounded by a feast of design by Phillipe Stark which is quirky and stylish, I loved everything about it. I've always wanted to stay here and I was not let down, everything about it was stunning and the staff were excellent too. We had forgotten to book somewhere to eat, (on a Saturday evening), but the concierge recommended somewhere and it was booked immediately and it was perfect. The rooms are stylish and comfortable and we had a great weekend. I will definitely be returning and next time I must try out some treatments from the spa.",5,2014,06,07
132,Couldn't fault the Sanderson.,"We usually stay at The Sanderson's sister hotel St Martins Lane but decided to try The Sanderson. The staff cannot do enough to ensure your stay is perfect. The room was perfectly equipped, the cocktails in the bar prepared and served with panache, there was a real buzz about the place but also totally relaxing. Breakfast and service was first class. We would happily recommend this hotel to anyone who enjoys stylish hotels and good service.",5,2014,06,07
132,Super cool design and relaxed 5 star service,"I loved the Sanderson hotel. The look, the feel, the location, the design and above all the staff! 
The rooms are really modern and edgy, with super-cool glass bathrooms. The towels, linen and even the minibar gets a special mention as well - really nice quality and selection beyond my expectations even in a 5 star property. 
A really cool feature was the fact that the turndown service included the housekeeping staff lighting a tea candle in the room, turning the cool, but to some perhaps slightly cold, design-room into a cozy and welcoming place in the evenings. 
I also really enjoyed the purple-bar and it’s tiny chairs – what a crazy idea – I was amazed it worked! A special mention as well to the Swedish hostess at Purple for all her great suggestions, and excellent service! 
A word of caution, If you are looking for a traditional somber 5star hotel this is not for you. If you love funky design, individuality and great people this is THE place for it. Sanderson is not a quiet place, its cool and buzzing, and its totally awesome.",5,2014,06,03
132,Unique,"Very good location and super nice staff.
The room was outstanding, reflecting at 100% the Morgans hotel philosophy.

Breakfast could be improved, but overall the variety and the quality of the products was ok. 

I'll come back if I have the chance!",5,2014,06,02
132,Agua Spa,"I have visited Agua spa many times and I just love it! From Marta that has been the sweetest most accomodating, lovely, professional receptionist to Chinatsu my therapist who gave me the best treatment ever. Not only she had the best advice for my skin and back. 
Agua spa is very much a special place, the look of it is timeless and the service is perfection. 
Thank you to you guys!",5,2014,05,22
132,A good stay,"This hotel although it is a bit expensive in regard of the rooms which are not very spacious, it is good choice for staying in the city centre. It offers many facilities and it is clean although there is some noise in the corridors especially if you stay at saturday.",4,2014,05,21
132,Exceptional,"Everything about the Sanderson is fantastic.

I have stayed in standard rooms and the penthouse and all are perfect, modern, elegant and stylish, great beds, great size.

The selection of bars and restaurants within the hotel and excellent.

For me the Long Bar and the Purple Bar are two of the best hotel bars in town and serve truly amazing cocktails and snacks.

Great location.

All round excellence.",5,2014,05,21
132,DISAPPOINTED,"I stayed at this Hotel in March with my 2 daughters and it really leaves a lot to be desired.

My husband had booked the Penthouse Suite which is 2 bedroomed, he requested that the second bedroom be twin bedded. On arrival we were not escorted to our room but advised how to get there via 2 lifts. The second bedroom had a double bed so we rang the front desk and then housekeeping who advised that twin beds would not fit and they inferred that we would not have been offered this option. It was eventually agreed that an extra z-bed would be located in the lounge area, not ideal but this was the best option we were given other than leave things as they are (my daughters are adults so this was not an option).

We partook of Afternoon Tea, which was absolutely wonderful.

We went to the Theatre that evening and on our return decided to have drinks from the mini bar, although we had a kitchen area there were no glasses or cups in the cupboard or a bottle opener. Another call to housekeeping who were very rude and told us to look in the cupboards, as we had already looked they sent up the necessary pieces. Also needed to ask for tea, coffee etc. for the room.

The next morning we went down for breakfast, the service was wonderful and the food delicious. 

Off shopping after breakfast. no doorman so had to flag down our own taxi!

Returned early evening to find min bar had not been replenished and glasses had been removed. Another call for glasses and bottle opener.

Breakfast next morning again no complaints service exceptional and food delicious.

Packed and checked out, gave list of items taken from the mini bar which were added to the bill. Again no doorman so flagged a taxi to go to Euston.

Now I find that there has been a extra charge of £6.00 charged to my credit card I have no idea what this is!!

Definitely will not stay here again.",2,2014,05,19
132,Very cool and different,"If you like ultra modern and the unusual you will love this place. The bar is a real feature and there are iconic shots to be had of the ""eye backed"" chairs. The purple bar is cool. The stark white mood- lit room was certainly dramatic and striking. I would like to have had an afternoon drink in the garden/courtyard but it was busy with afternoon tea parties. Well placed for getting around London.",4,2014,05,13
132,Quirky and Fun,"This one split my wife and I in our views i tend to like boutique hotels with individual touches and she likes more ornate and floral so this one was much more to my taste than hers but we both agreed it was a fun stay. The decor and furnishing are fun and unusual. You arrive in a very modern reception and we were immediately struck by unusual chairs and mirrors which are very distinct if you then look towards the long bar the eye chairs will immediately catch your attention. The pool room is striking with yet more unusual chairs, stain glass window and a playable pool table. The small purple resident bar was darkly lit in the evening with candles and was perfect for a quiter more intimate cocktail and conversation as opposed to the long bar which could get very busy.  Cocktails were very tasty and good selection. The rooms were good size well fitted, decoration and bedding stark white with subtle lighting  I loved the room but my wife wasnt sure. We didnt have a main meal in restaurant so cant comment on that. Afternoon Teas were clearly popular in the courtyard it was full when we went for a drink in the main bar. Overall Good central London location for shopping very modern feel to the hotel and if you like individuality in your the hotel this is certainly different.",4,2014,05,10
132,Cool as Ice,"Stylish with quietly attentive staff, funky minimalist bedroom, huge bed, lively bar scene and a very cool ambience. It's got to be checked out if you are staying in London and want to be within a few minutes of the West End and Soho. The understated breakfast was served in a calm atmosphere, perfectly rounding off our overnight stay. Faultless.",5,2014,05,08
132,"Very funky, vibrant and full of life","We stayed here for a weekend in London with friends. Our room looked exactly like the one in the picture.....modern, not too spacious but adequate. The bed was a bit low but comfortable nevertheless. 
We stayed in the hotel bar which was great, played some pool, the atmosphere was great, busy but not overly crowded, vibrant. 
The service was great overall, we had a great time - would highly recommend the Sanderson.",5,2014,04,19
132,Thank you soo much !,"Best hotel stay ever, they saved my life! Thank you Kris! You know how to handle problems ! Will do it again not cause I loved it but because I feel to be in debt toward you guys ! Next time all drinks all on me :*",5,2014,04,15
132,omg beatiful!!!!,"this hotel is the dogs do dars!!i have been lucky enough to spend various weekends at this truly stunning hotel,and have actually been spoilt and stayed here twice over the past 3 weeks :)
the staff in this hotel could not be more helpful and they go out of their way to make your stay special.we arrived home yesterday evening  and i would say i had one of the best weekends ever.it was a double celebration,my partners birthday and our engagement!!
the sanderson truly excelled themselves.on arrival we were greeted by J J on reception,lovely guy.also concierge recognised us and came over to say welcome back.we were upgraded to a loft suite,the rooms in this hotel are stunningly furnished.we went out and on our return a bottle of wine and a welcome note left from linzi,how lovely.and the sanderson reccomended a fab restaurant to me a few weeks ago,aqua neuvo(northern spanish food).had a lovely meal with friends and on our return someone had been to our room and lit all the candles on the terrace.truly magical.its all these touches that make this hotel one of a kind.every single member of staff so lovely.i truly felt like a princess this weekend.thank u,we cannot wait to return.x",5,2014,04,14
132,Very cool hotel,"Unusual decor, chic unusual style rooms, not totally practical but fabulously comfortable bed. Love the funky lifts but don't like the dim dark corridors. We travelled as a large party and experienced the amazing mad hatters tea, very inventive and tasty. The purple room is very purple but cosy nonetheless. Breakfast was well cooked and there was plenty of choice. Service was a little hit and miss but the staff who looked after us were polite. Would definitely visit again.",4,2014,04,13
132,Creative decor,Once you pass through the front door of the Sanderson you suspect your stay will be unique. Many hotels are just creative in the lobby but this hotel is unique everywhere. I think our brain function improved by considering curtains for walls instead of plaster. Angled furniture and 3 d art in the elevators. Beautiful outdoor deck attached to our ro by floor to ceiling windows  - wish the weather had lent itself to using the deck. Fantastic and very popular bar attracts the young business crowd. Try it for the light and fun environment. ,4,2014,04,11
132,Can not fault,"I returned to the Sanderson again this weekend having stayed here on a few occasions in the past and again I can not fault my stay!!

We chose the romance package which consists of a room upgrade, bottle of champagne, breakfast and a late checkout of 4pm! We stayed in one of the renovated room which was lovely very spacious and nice touches like rose petals on the bed. I have stayed in many hotels in London but I love the Sanderson as it's quirky and modern! With it being only. Few minutes from Oxford street it's location is perfect!

Service from staff from dining to bar to front house, spa and valet is impeccable! They are all very polite and very accommodating 

We also returned to the agua spa which is a must if you have time during the visit I recommend a back massage and eve lom experience!

The bar is great atmosphere in the evening and if staying at the hotel be sure to take advantage of the purple bar as well which is very quirky seating.

Thankyou to all the staff at the Sanderson for another great stay I will for sure be returning again very soon!",5,2014,04,07
132,The staff here are the rudest I've ever encountered!,"Having stayed at many 4 & 5* London hotels from The Savoy and Mandarin Oriental to The Haymarket and Soho Hotel this is the one hotel I had visited for drinks on numerous occasions but never as a resident. 

I had been on at my partner for a while saying we needed to have a weekend here and he decided to treat me to just that for my birthday. 

To cut a long story short, I wish we had booked into any of the above or the Mayfair. From the minute we arrived to the minute we left the staff were rude, obnoxious, pretentious and thought they were a lot better than they actually were. We had an issue that we had recently changed our accounts from one bank to another and our new cards hadn't been activated so we left a cash deposit at reception because we don't use or own credit cards as don't feel the need to. However you would have thought we second class citizens for doing this. Check in ended up taking almost 20 minutes as a result and checking out was not much quicker as the money we had left in an envelope was no longer there and we had to wait for the staff to go and get it and have it signed off! Nothing like efficiency. It's not as though they never knew what date we were checking out so one would assume they would have had this ready. 

The only saving grace on a staffing level was the waiter in Suka was brilliant. Kind, courteous, helpful and with a great sense of humour! There was also one lovely bar hostess in the Purple Bar however the other one was horrendous. When we ordered our cocktails she came straight over to ask for the cash before we could be served as there was no card attached to our room. Therefore making us feel quite inadequate and rather red faced in front of others in an intimate area where everyone can overhear. Again made to feel we were second rate for not having a credit card and for paying in good old fashioned sterling pounds!!! It wouldn't have been so bad if she had spoken to us in a polite and respectful manner but her tone and behaviour were nothing short of appalling. When we left after one drink the other hostess asked why we were leaving so soon and I actually explained this to her and thanked her for her hospitality. 
She did apologise for her colleagues attitude but it was too little too late. Off to Zuma for us. 

Aside from the staff the room itself was looking a tad tired and although the bed was extremely comfortable I feel this hotel is very over rated and over priced.

I've only given the 2 stars for the comfy bed, the lovely waiter in Suka, the great meal we had there also and the Long bar. 

This hotel has had it's day and I would not recommend it to anyone. If the hotel management read this I would encourage them to send their staff to the same training school that The Savoy use as I could not find one fault with anything on my previous stays there. And the staff are beyond exceptional. 

We were made to feel uncomfortable our entire stay here to the point that even after an amazing proposal from my now fiancée on that weekend the only thing that ruined it for us was our stay at this hotel. We ended up booking into The Haymarket (Firmdale group) for the following night, which as per usual was amazing with first class service all round.",2,2014,04,01
132,Lovely Central Hotel,"Stayed here with my friend for a girly London shopping trip, fantastic location just off Oxford street.when we arrived the reception was extremely friendly, couldn't do enough for us, introduced to the concierge, shown around the hotel and escorted to our room and shown how to work everything.Great greeting and made to feel very welcome.
The hotel is very modern and contemporary , fab furniture, very white rooms and lovely comfy bed.Had drinks and ate at the long bar, great atmosphere and as the evening went on it got even more interesting, people watching , no need to leave the hotel as such a great place and then just upstairs to bed !
we will be back soon and take in the lovely afternoon tea which was going on in the lovely courtyard.
Book this hotel for a lovely stay, great location and fantastic staff and even  better if they have an offer on !",5,2014,03,27
132,Great bar!,"I went to this hotel to spend the weekend with my husband. The rooms were new, a bit noisy, but I will definitely come back because of the great experience we had at bar. It was always alive, full of interesting people. It felt good to come from a long day of shopping to this nice bar. Our bartender ( I guess his name was Eddy, he has a beard) was the highlight of our evenings. I never had so many great drinks in my life. He made one with strawberry and chocolate aroma that was just amazing! I can't wait to come back! The food at the restaurant was also very good. The breakfast was lovely and the staff was very friendly. 
",4,2014,03,27
132,Only place to stay in London! Fantastic experience!,"If you are looking for truly outstanding service, great food and an overall excellent experience, look no further. The Sanderson London has it all, from tailored, personal service to fantastic food and an extremely service minded staff. 
The rooms are quiet and stylish, the restaurants have great food and equally great service, and everyone you meet, from the porter to the concierge, waiters and managers, are doing everything they can to make your experience a wonderful and unique one. 
Combining such excellent service with a more casual, laid back atmosphere makes it the perfect weekend getaway hotel, and our new preferred home in London!",5,2014,03,24
132,Beautiful !!,"Gorgeous hotel with funky bedrooms and a stunning lobby and bar area. The courtyard is gorgeous but we were disappointed our friends had to go back through the hotel and stand on the street to smoke especially considering we were the only tables outside in the courtyard all evening.
Drink are pricey but service, flair and style make it worth it.
Will definitely be back as this hotel is a great base for London exploration !",5,2014,03,23
132,Valentines week end,"Stayed here with my wife for valentines. Very modern design which we liked.
After the theatre we took 2 friends back to get some cocktails. 
The long bar  was packed and Cocktails were great!
The following morning we decided on room service breakfast which was pricey but tasty.
Def reccomend!",5,2014,03,13
132,Not enough substance to match the style,"I stayed in the Sanderson hotel in January 2014. I've been there many times for drinks in the bar, and certainly the ground floor area is very impressive. 

However, the rooms just don't function. There are no plug sockets - when you ask for a kettle or an iron, you have to get really creative about plugging these in without having a weird wiring configuration around the bed. The shower completely flooded the bathroom. There's nowhere to put anything. There's no room to actually sit at the desk behind the bed. These are things I can cope with in a hotel, but not at this price. There's no attention to detail. I called room service for a cup of peppermint tea - and 30 minutes later received a knock at the door, to find a lady holding a peppermint tea bag (to which I responded perhaps I might also need a cup and an kettle!) - bizarre. 

For me, the real grating issue was the fact that during my stay, the hotel had no running water for 36 hours. I couldn't even flush the toilet. I received a cake and a cocktail voucher by way of apology, and to be fair, the situation was out of their control - this was a mains problem, not specific to the hotel. But however, when I asked what my options were, I was not offered the option to stay in one of their other hotels in London, the staff were completely disinterested in discussing this with me. Where were the complimentary large bottles of water to help us clean our teeth? Wouldn't it have been a nice idea to leave some face wipes instead of a cake??? When you are on your own, in a stark, flooded, soulless room with drunk girls falling around downstairs, echo-y corridors, and no running water whatsoever, you start to question exactly what you are paying 400GBP a night for. The answer is ""looks"" (and a very comfortable bed, I have to say). But these things just don't make up for everything else, to me.",3,2014,03,12
132,Another amazing stay,"Only amazing things to say about the Sanderson, just left there from another really great visit.
This hotel is just beautiful to look at, rooms are incredibly comfortable, food anywhere in the hotel is delicious, service is great with lovely friendly and interested staff. Great location one block form Oxford St. 
5 star all the way. Can't wait to go back again.",5,2014,03,12
132,great location,"the hotel is in great location and walking distance to various turisc places in london, as well they have a nice bar full of beautiful people.
the decor is fab, philippe starck style,which does make the difference if you are into decoration",5,2014,03,11
132,Sanderson Hotel London,"I have been staying in the Sanderson since it opened and it has never let me down. Walking back into the place always gives me a smile. Staff are efficient and friendly, the atmosphere at the bar in the evening just great! Well worth a try for business or pleasure. 
Luxembourg John",5,2014,02,27
132,Lovely hotel fantastic service,"This quirky yet very pleasant hotel is definitely worth a visit.  The staff are sooo helpful it's hard to remember better service.  I can highly recommend the afternoon tea really good fun.  Lovely bedroom.  The only thing to be aware of the bathroom, very lovely but you must be close with the person you share with- doors a bit see through",5,2014,02,23
132,3d time at Sanderson,"What is consistent.   Excellent staff.  Food is very good.  Trippy modern rooms.   There is one thing I have really picked up about this hotel chain, though.   Their computer and reservation systems are awful. I feel really bad for the hotel staff having to deal with it.   When I call for a reservation they always say they will email the res.  never and I mean never comes.  ""First time with us?""   Ummm. Actually.....   Seriously.  Give your poor employees a break.  They are awesome even though they are probably pulling their hair out.",4,2014,02,16
132,"Fashion hotel, great service","I stayed there for a weekend. A mix of work and relax. I can say the hotel is one of my favorite in the world and in London, for sure. It is a design hotel, it is a fashion hotel, they have a great service, a Philippe Stark design in every detail.

It is in the perfect position, midtown in london, near the oxford circus underground station. The rooms are white, with tends to divide bathroom and bedroom. The bed are huge king size, and on the ceiling in some rooms you can see paintings. A special hotel, surely, not for everybody. The elegance is not declared and shown as in the old style hotels. But I think it is perfect for this reason. Not invasive, always pleasant.",4,2014,02,16
132,Location-staff-hip,"stayed for 2 nights on business.
hotel is well located; lobby is really cool. check-in was swift.
got an interesting offer for a room upgrade.
room was large - well kept. Malin + Goetz stuff, evening turn down service; comfortable beds. 
as with many London hotels, noise isolation was not perfect (both noise from outside as inside).
room service was good.",4,2014,02,15
132,Not 1 single complaint about The Sanderson Hotel,"Firstly, let me just say that I did not pay for my stay at The Sanderson Hotel. I was lucky to win a 2 night stay here courtesy of Virgin Holidays. Upon Arrival at the hotel we were treated very nicely by the man on reception. He gave us a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room and gave us some information about the hotel. 
The room was very trendy with a massive sleigh bed in the middle of it. The bed was very comfy.
The mini-bar in the room was superb and had a lot of choices. I myself did not find the prices of the alcohol too bad for the mini-bar. it was £6.50 for a vodka (50ml) bit the mixers were expensive - £.50 for a bottle of coke, £4.50 for a can of Red Bull.
The only downside about the room was that there was not much privacy if you were doing your business in the toilet  due to the glass partitions etc.
The long bar was superb. I have read previous reviews stating it was £48 for 2 cocktails a lemonade and a beer - if this is true then it must have been champagne cocktails as most regular cocktails were around £12. The bar staff were great, I have absolutely no complaints about them.

I would love to stay here again; it has a good vibe although I know it will not be to everyone's taste. The front of house staff were really nice and gave us a map for sightseeing and i never felt they were looking down at me by the way I dressed (Jeans, T-Shirt and a padded jacket). we got to use the Hotels Mercedes as well for travelling to the theatre which was very nice, plus it was cheaper than a taxi.

If you have the money, stay here. It is a great place in a great central London Location.",5,2014,02,11
132,Still very good,"We booked the Sanderson Hotel for our wedding anniversary in London. I must admit i was a bit nervous after reading some negative comments. Honestly i don't understand why these come from.  We booked the Romantic Package (breakfast, champagne, upgrade included). We were really welcomed in a very good way.  Room (505) was beautiful, candles lit, very nice. Great shower. Breakfast was excellent.  Sanderson still got it.",5,2014,02,10
132,"Brilliant Staff, great breakfast & stylish rooms...","We stayed at the Sanderson for the 1st time last weekend and we were very excited to be going as had seen and heard so much about this lil gem! We were attending a friends 30th Birthday in Notting Hill so we wanted a nice hotel that was central and easy to get to from Euston etc- The Sanderson could not be better situated!!!

We are regular 'hotel go-ers' as my Fiance works away a lot and I usually go on the road with him. We tend to stay in The Marriott's as he is a platinum member and you know what you're getting when staying at a Marriott, so staying in The boutique style Sanderson was going to be a nice change for us!

We were not disappointed! The hotel is very stylish and spacious with lots of funky furniture in the lobby area. The staff at the front desk were VERY pleasant and are certainly all in the right job as they were super helpful at every given opportunity.

We booked a delux King room and the room was just beautiful. All white with a huge king size bed - which was so comfortable! The bathroom was also very spacious and modern with a wet room shower and exposed bath tub that was large enough for two people to share!

The lighting in the room was also great! You could choose how light or dim you wanted the room as there are a lot of different ways to light the room. The large mirror was perfect for getting ready and the turn down service with a candle was a lovely touch.

We did have a few minor issues with the room originally but this is where the service really excelled! Ivan who was the hotel duty manager could not have been more amazing. He moved us (at no extra charge) to a loft suite with balcony and this room was even more grand and spacious. The bell boy was so friendly and chatty, we honestly couldn't have been more impressed with the staff! This room also had a gorgeous terrace with candles in lanterns, very romantic and peaceful.

Breakfast was divine! (we had to take photos and share to our facebook friends!!) Wheeled in at a time of our choice was the most delicious full english and blueberry pancakes - YUM!!!
There was plenty of breakfast choices and all at very reasonable prices.

We weren't drinking alcohol as we have a big physique competition coming up and we had travelled from Manchester and were back on the road the following day for a week on the road again so sadly we didn't get to enjoy the gorgeous bars and all the hotel facilities, so with that in mnid we have decieded that we just HAVE to come back to this hotel to enjoy it all again as it really was a brilliant stay.

The rooms are so relaxing, perfect for couples -  We can't wait to return!!

Special thanks again to Ivan - what a star!!! We would love to buy you a drink we come down next!

I have uploaded some photos so you can see what a gorgeous hotel this was!",5,2014,02,10
132,Great On Everything Except What Matters,"The rooms are tiny, have thin walls, narrow beds & the price is 400 pounds a night. What more is there to say?

The bar downstairs is good, service good & , gym and location OK.

But in light of the rooms, who cares? I would make this place a second to last resort.",2,2014,02,09
132,Luxury hotel and top drawer service.,"We stayed one night having enjoyed a previous stay at the sister hotel St Martins Lane. Sanderson is heavy on design but not at the expense of comfort. Fantastic front of house staff were welcoming and when we expressed disappointment at the lack of a bathtub in our room we were upgraded without fuss or charge. 
The Long Bar was buzzing when we stayed, so much so we stayed in and partied in the hotel rather than seeking adventure in the nearby West End. Breakfast was top quality.
All in all as good as it gets in London and if you value service you'll enjoy your stay.",5,2014,02,03
132,AMAZING!!!,"This is the best place to stay in London hands down.  The bed is so comfortable, the staff is incredibly nice (including JJ at the front desk) and the location is perfect.  I've been staying here for years and i highly recommend it.",5,2014,02,02
132,"Great staff, rooms not very functional","I have stayed in the Sanderson hotel around 20 times in the last 6 months.  The staff are great - attentive without being fawning and get the balance just right.  Amongst the best I have come across.

But the rooms......  They just don't quite get it right. You play 'hunt the plug socket', and it's not easy.  The showers just flood the bathroom but hey, they're cool and funky so it doesn't matter.  It's not a home away from home, it's a white space in the middle of London. Also, on several occasions I've had to move rooms because of the paint fumes.  Maybe they should consider only letting people stay in them when the walls are dry! Oh, and don't get a connecting room unless you know the person next door.  They are very loud!

Shame as the staff don't embody what you get in the rooms.  I've decided to move on and try somewhere else but that's not because of the quality of staff.  Maybe I'll be able to charge my phone overnight and not have it rested by the door.  Fingers crossed!",4,2014,02,01
132,ups and downs,"I stayed in the Sanderson on business in January 2014. While the service was impeccable (attention for the small details, quick and efficient check in and check out, ...) as you would expect from this kind of hotel, I was not very impressed with the rooms. For one, the light from the hallway shines into the room at night and there is a lot of noise from revellers that are coming from the bar downstairs (I guess that depends on the room) and from traffic all night. Overall I struggled to get some decent sleep. secondly, The rooms are furnished very eclectic and sparse. While this might be appealing to some, it was not my cup of tea.
I have stayed in overall better hotels in London for the same price.",3,2014,01,29
132,Amazing,"I recently stayed in the Sanderson Hotel with my daughter …. its FANTASTIC!   The service is brilliant the rooms are very modern but sooooooo relaxing, no clutter.  Fans of the more traditional hotel might struggle… but give it a go… you won't be disappointed.   We had dinner in the restaurant on our first night - the food is amazing probably the best asian style food I have ever eaten.   The bar is lively but so sophisticated, great for people watching.  Our breakfast the following morning was to die for…how can french toast and berries / pancakes with blueberries taste so good.  Oh I nearly forgot to mention the spa its like a little piece of heaven. Superb location for theatre and shopping.

We are definitely coming back to stay and will be recommending the restaurant to all our friends.",5,2014,01,26
132,Perfect!,"Stayed here with my partner on the 18/01 as we were going out in London for our anniversary. On arrival at the hotel our room was not ready yet so the man on reception took us to the bar for some complimentary drinks which was nice. The decor when you entered the hotel really is amazing, modern and cool. The long bar is fantastic and the cocktails  were really nice. We stayed in one of the deluxe rooms which was simply stunning. Never had to FaceTime people before to show them how cool a room was in a hotel. Needed an iron so called down to house keeping, had it in about 30 seconds at the door. This is good as have been to hotels where stuff like that takes ages. On our way out we went to the purple residents only bar, this was fantastic. Didn't really see anything that I liked on the cocktails menu in here but the waitress simply asked what I liked and made one for me. Annoyingly we didn't get a chance to use the spa which we will be doing next time we stay. 

Overall a fantastic hotel, read reviews about staff 'looking cool but not being helpful' and have to say thats simply crap. All the staff were so polite and helpful to us throughout the whole stay. Best hotel I've stayed at and will be back again next time I'm in london.",5,2014,01,20
132,3 night stay over New year,"Back to the Sanderson because it's simply lovely. 
This time we took advantage of the upgrades on offer at check - in and got a better room and a package to include breakfast. 
Our stay was made more the relaxing as we enjoyed breakfast in bed a couple of times. The food is delicious
This is a cool and stylish hotel which modern art/design fans will love. I always imagine that those seeking a more traditional base would not appreciate its styling ( glass walls and sheer drapes)
The Sanderson is well located for trips into the West End as it is just off Oxford Street. 
We ate in the restaurant for breakfast one morning and this was let down by service. This hotel has a lot of staff but things like toast or more coffee take an age to appear
We enjoyed drinks in The Purple Bar and Long Bar on NYE which is great for people watching and posing!
Staff are always friendly and welcoming",4,2014,01,14
132,fantastic hotel,"Visited for 2 nights at the weekend to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday, i mentioned this when i booked and not only did they upgrade our room but the lovely Linxi had arranged for a bottle of champagne to be in our room when we arrived.....a very nice touch. The room was beautiful! a perfect mix of classy elegance with some quirkiness thrown in for good measure. I would highly recommend a visit to the Purple Bar, excellent cocktails made by a guy who really knew what he was doing. The staff at the hotel were what stood out the most, everyone was friendly and couldn't do enough for us, they made our stay really enjoyable and i would happily stay there again.",5,2014,01,13
132,Wonderful Hotel,Fantastic Service as soon as we walked into the Hotel...Was warmly greeted by JJ who was able to offer a fantastic deal on an upgrade...The room was spacious with its own small terrace and well worth the extra cost.The staff in the hotel were very helpful and friendly...The facilities are great and the Bars were buzzing in the evening...The venue is perfectly located for Oxford and Regent Street shopping and we will definitely be staying again.,5,2014,01,13
132,Sanderson has everything you'll need for London stay!,"The Sanderson was a perfect hotel for our London visit.  Walking distance from Oxford Street, Regent Street, Theatres and top Restaurants.  Their in house bar had a wonderful vibe and their Mad Hatters afternoon Tea was an experience not to miss!
The staff were warm and friendly and the accommodation was some of the finest I have had in London.
Can't wait to return",5,2014,01,12
132,Central London oasis!,"Haven't got a bad word to stay about the hotel, all the staff were attentive, friendly and efficient. Quality of room service was excellent - was forced to use it as my husband had a stomach bug, thankfully for him the room was very comfortable, this didn't spoil our weekend completely but we couldn't take advantage of the hotel restaurant and facilities as we would normally have done! Hotel car made a pleasant change to a cab and was not expensive.  Jo J on reception made check out a pleasure! Would love to return to make proper use of all the hotel has to offer.",5,2014,01,12
132,Fantastic Festive Fun,"Being regular guests of the Delano in Miami and St Martin's Lane hotel in London, which we adore, we thought we'd try The Sanderson over the relatively quiet Christmas period and we enjoyed every minute.  The location is super central, the decor trendy, the food fantastic and the staff exceptional.  Particularly JJ who went out of his way to ensure that we had a splendid stay and always greeted us with a smile whenever we bumped in to him.  We had a lovely stay and can't wait to return for the Mad Hatter's tea party which we unfortunately could not squeeze in this time round.",4,2014,01,09
132,Superb Service & Standard,"For New Year's we stayed at The Sanderson and let me tell you one thing, it was spectacular in the sense that the service was impeccable. The design of the hotel is about to get updated, but the Philippe Stark design is something classic by now. That hotel did set a whole new standard when it opened up and even though it needs some freshen up it still is a spectacular hotel in every sense. 

I love how everyone there is so attentive to ones needs in a very subtle but still straight forward way. Everyone there gave us nothing but amazing service, but the one that stood out was Karin from the Purple Bar. She gave us everything I asked for and helped us with just about everything with a huge, HUGE smile on her face. Everyone needs to get a cocktail from the Purple Bar just because of her.

One thing that truck me was that everyone at the hotel that I spoke to knew what room I stayed at and all the things that I had ordered. Now that's very good.

I got first class service, and an upgrade, tons of smiles and when I got back from the New Year's party there was a bottle of champagne in our room. I love champagne so that did put a very big smile. I trull recommend everyone to stay at the Sanderson.

Paolo Savi",5,2014,01,05
132,Birthday break,"Overall very impressed. Good staff, excellent food and the Long Bar's range of drinks very good. Atmosphere was very relaxing and we had an enjoyable stay.
The room was well designed and the facilities were good. Only issue is to reconsider the shower and sink taps, very funky design but difficult to switch off with wet hands! Considering the hotel's central London location, we had an undisturbed sleep.
      
      
      ",5,2014,01,04
132,Trendy but times they are changing,"Not my first stay at Sanderson, but probably the last. It is not that I am all that disappointed, after all I have rated Sanderson with 4 stars. How ever, I feel that what was once a super trendy design hotel is now getting a little bit outdated. I am aware of that many will disagree with me on this point, and argue that one of its strengths is the not changing environment. For me, how ever, I feel that there are so many others super nice hotels in London in this price category that Sanderson is no longer my top five pick. I really look forward to the new Mondrian opening later this year! We also had a little sad ending of our trip with the concierge arguing with me over 75 GBP after we paid approximately 2500 GBP for a long weekend.",4,2014,01,03
132,Not worth it!,"You think while checking into the Sanderson you'd get top notch service and attention given the hilarious amount of money you pay but No....

The management, front desk team are professional and welcoming. They changed our room when i expressed how small it was. Note: I did book the Superior King room which was over 37 sqm and they tried to squeeze me into a regular small room when I checked in! 
The concierge service is ok though.

Now the big ordeal:
Housekeeping is terrible, they dont do the room when you expect them to, they open the door and walk in on you at 7pm!! True horror

Food? What food?? 
Suka the Malaysian restaurant is the worst I have tried in my travels and no wonder the restaurant is always empty!

Staff??
Well apparently the Morgans group is more interested in projecting the image of a cool hip hotel by hiring young incompetent kids rather than trained professionals.

Overall, the Hotel is ok but not worth 300 pounds/night. The ambiance is nice and young but thats about it.",2,2014,01,01
132,Top notch service and best rooms in town,"We arrived at The Sanderson late morning on the Saturday, the receptionist JJ was very welcoming to my family and myself. He organised an upgrade to a balcony room for us and couldn't have been more hospitable. He got us drinks, gave the kids candy canes and organised our luggage and valet parking. The porter at the hotel took the cars underground for us, he also told us that he would put them out on the road for us on the Sunday as it was free parking. There are many amazing features to this hotel, first being its service. JJ rang us on many occasions to ensure everything was ok with the room. The pool room, residents bar and lifts have to be seen to be believed. 

When we got to our rooms we were bowled over with the design. The sheer curtains separate the different sections of the room and give a romantic feel to the room, especially in turn down when the staff lit all the candles in the rooms and on the balcony. The balcony room was fab and what a VIEW!!!! But is small on space compared to the Deluxe King we also had booked. The main reason we upgraded to the balcony room is because we were assured there would be more room for a pull down bed in there, but actually I felt there was more room in the Deluxe King. There was four adults and one child staying this time. Each room had a spacious feel, this is probably due to the tulle curtains. Both rooms had spacious bathrooms and free standing baths which,  compared to some I have ran before, didn't take long to fill on my relaxing Sunday morning wake up. The shower is very powerful and has a great attachment shower head which for us girlies who just want to refresh our hair is fab. I love the fact that you can buy Sanderson T-shirts in your room lol. Getting ready for our night out, I wandered around the room in the cosy dressing gowns that are supplied in the room, jumped on the bed and danced around the room to 9to5 on the radio. I felt completely at home and that's what The Sanderson does best here :-)

The TV is a great size anything bigger would be overpowering, it can be brought out of the window and turned around too in the DK, but in the Balcony room it was stuck in a cupboard which looked out dated and was in the way (it also housed the mini bar). The mini bar was very well stocked and a great way of topping up my Extreme Moijto from the bar down stairs. The TV is very difficult to get your head around the controls, even for me who likes to think of herself as very technically minded, my mom didn't have a chance lol. Another feature of the rooms was the HUGE mirror, I love love love huge mirrors and in the KD it was right next to the bed which could be used creatively on a romantic break lol. I used it for doing my hair and checking my outfit. Love love love it.  

Some extras in the room which I wish I had more information about, as soon as I entered,  was that in both rooms there were complimentary golf size umbrellas. They would have been really useful later on as it poured down and we got soaked lol. There was also coffee and tea facilities that we didn't find, they were well hidden, until we were about to check out the room. 

We spent one afternoon, before we went out for the evening, down in the bar and restaurant where we gobbled down an amazing themed afternoon tea based on The Mad Hatters Tea Party. The sugar cubes could be found in a jewellery box, so cute!!!! The down fall of this was the cakes, my sister and mom thought they weren't really that nice. They looked amazing and I tried some of the white chocolate on the rainbow cake and it was nice too. I think it was the goo that put them off. The tasty bit for me was the peas growing out of the tea cup on top yummy x on a side note, breakfast filled me up for a whole day, it's huge. Summer would be lovely as you could enjoy the outside space with the water features and comfortable seating. Would be a perfect wedding venue.

Pros
> feels like you are home :-)
> modern rooms that at very spacious and are different to what I have experienced before
> the service was AMAZING!!!! I take customer service very seriously as it can really make or break a stay. This is one of the best I have experienced at a hotel. 
> great for celebrity spotting :-) especially good looking England players 

Cons
> we need to know where the coffee and tea facilities are in the room
> directions for using the TV needed

We would def recommend this hotel to friends and family. We hope to stay here again soon. I would be very grateful that if you enjoyed this review and found it helpful, you press your mouse/finger on the little button that says YES. Thank you in advance x",5,2013,12,31
132,Too Modern,we stayed at the Sanderson Christmas week we had originally booked a king size bed but we got a queen bed in room 523 the staff were really helpful but the hotel was busy we couldn't find another suitable room but after 4 nights they gave us a Christmas gift and upgraded us to a loft suite for the last 2 nights which kind of balanced out the whole experience  the rooms are nice but too modern for our taste the bathroom floors are clean but have dark stains on them which still gives you the feel that their dirty on the upside the food was good and the bar and reception were lovely and the staff are great am a more traditional kind of person so i wouldn't stay there again and if u decide to stay don't eat at the Italian restaurant across the street it wasnt any good.,3,2013,12,30
132,Quirky and friendly,"We stayed on a Sunday night, staff that greeted us were friendly...the entrance was as expected from the reviews, although didn't expect the lift! Corridor felt a bit 'government institute', but the room was great, from the net panels separating the bathroom area, to the very comfortable bed - the candle lit turndown was a welcoming surprise.  Would have been nice to stay longer and spend some time using the facilities.",5,2013,12,29
132,Perfect!!! A romantic but different hotel!,I spend one night to celebrate my girlfriend birthday! This is a lovely sexy hotel different from others! From when you walk in you can feel a lovely welcome atmosphere  ! We had a bottle of champagne in the room after a night out on London! What a lovely touch to celebrate her birthday! Thank you so much!!!! ,5,2013,12,23
132,Good for business travel,"Recently stayed at The Sanderson when traveling for business. The hotel is centrally located - an easy taxi ride from Paddington Station. At check-in, the front desk manager gave me free wifi access for the duration of my stay which was convenient. 

I thought the hallways and elevators were really dark. It was a bit creepy to walk them alone late at night or early in the morning. However, my room was bright and made a good use of the space. My only complaint was that the desk area was a bit crowded against the separation with the bathroom. Also, there were very few plugs in the room, but I figured out on my last night that there was a power strip in the storage bin in the bathroom. I also loved that the hotel does turndown service. 

All-in-all things at the Sanderson went fine for my trip. Good for business travel.",4,2013,12,22
132,JJ at the front desk is the USP of the hotel.,"This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at in the UK. JJ at the front desk has done an excellent job of taking care of us. He was very friendly, welcoming and very considerate. Unlike other front desk staff at hotels who try to upsell you just to add stars to their cap, JJ understood our needs and recommended the perfect room . The room was magical and very upbeat with a bit of classy touch to it. The housekeeping, room service and the concierge and bell desk were perfectly doing their job. JJ kept everything in mind and was up to date with our whereabouts and accordingly took care of anything which was needed . He was so understanding that he sent us a lovely tray of strawberries and chocolates on the house as it was our honeymoon instead of champagne as we don't consume alcohol. I would love to go back again and take my family . CHIC, CLASSY and UPBEAT.",5,2013,12,22
132,Quirky and Fun,"We've stayed at the hotel on two separate occasions, each time in Deluxe King Gym. The hotel and the rooms are decorated in quirky Philippe Starcks style (minimalist design with  lots of white, glass and sheer curtains and funky splashes of colors and random objects) so if that's not your thing or you want more traditional, warm and cozy, this is not your place. 

Rooms - the room was spacious though wardrobes/storage was rather limited (esp for 2 people staying for over a week). Ask for additional hangers. Room 501 has more storage space but faces a bar which is loud. If you want a more quiet room free of unz-unz music blasting into wee hours definitely say so when you check in. We did and have stayed at a room facing a quiet courtyard (with a funky London view). 

Restaurant/Amenities - we've only had breakfat at the hotel and the food options and quality were very good as was the service. The bar area is VERY liely. This is ""see and be seen"" type of place with lots of private events, models hanging around etc. 
We haven't tried the spa but it's suppose to be one of the better ones in London, perhaps next time. 

Location - it's off Oxford Street which is a good and bad thing. Obviously very central with great public transportation options if you don't want to walk however you have to face the Oxford Street crowds when heading to the hotel (it's located in a side street about 1 block off Oxford Street)

Overall we had a great experience with a hotel. I think it's more suitable for young-ish singles/couples than for older guests and/or families.",4,2013,12,19
132,Amazing top class,"Well we stayed for one night and will return flawless service from the moment the door was opened!  Cam on front desk and Sam on the front door too many staff to name all polished!  The hotel lost for words stunning!  We had a double exec room and it was sizeable and had been laid out with candles and a complimentary gift, thank you!  We also used the spa and this place is a hidden gem heaven off Oxford street.  No negatives at all see you again Sanderson and lastly thank you Katie xxx ",5,2013,12,19
132,Very bad experience,"The hotel staff is no so kind, it is very strenge bo be in the hotel. The rooms are not quiet!!!
I will not recomend this hotel to another peope. Only one think is the good steam room in the gym.You have to pay for internet, breakfest etc.",1,2013,12,18
132,We were woken up (without request!) at 7AM on a Sat AM!,"My husband and I were fast asleep on Saturday, Dec 14 when we were awoken by housecleaning walking into our room and chatting at 7AM. We were jarred awake and said ""Hello?!"" and they quickly left. They then showed back up at approximately 8AM and knocked on the door saying ""housecleaning!"" -- waking us up again. It was very disconcerting and strange. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay.",3,2013,12,17
132,Pretentious and not somewhere you would feel at home,"I am on my second night at this hotel on business and can safely say this is not somewhere to relax.  The lobby, rooms, bar and restaurant are noisy. The rooms are fussy with far too many net curtains. In fact the whole place is a triumph of style over substance. The meal this evening was meant to be Malay street food but was disappointing with tough meat   ",2,2013,12,17
132,Sleeping on a cloud,"First stay at this fashion icon of a hotel.  Best night's sleep in a London hotel ever - like sleeping on a cloud! 
Very welcoming reception staff and a quirky room layout - very spacious with wet room ensuite.  Gorgeous toiletries and lots of in room amenities. No chance to try the spa but will definitely be back to give it a whirl!",4,2013,12,15
132,Quirky,"very interesting decor, very attentive staff overall an enjoyable experience. Great if you want something out of the ordinary and a bit off the wall. Purple bar is a must experience, the cocktails are excellent.",3,2013,12,12
132,Perfect stay,"Attentive staff at check in, a brilliant room (spacious - quite plain but thats how i like my decor), buzzing bar, and reasonable prices for what it is.  The location is good for shopping and sightseeing, with Oxford street a few minutes away and Hyde park maybe 20 mins walk.  Will definately stay here again.",5,2013,12,12
132,Fantastic,"Beautiful hotel room, beautiful bar and excellent quality cocktails and food. We visited the long bar and the purple bar.

On the minus side there is no pool and no sauna. Or at least that the staff no of.. we asked a few staff members. And it can be a long wait at the bar, but at least there are many people to meet while your waiting!

We found it a bit weird someone had been in our room more than once.",5,2013,12,09
132,"Up Market ""Shabby Chic""","Extended a business trip over the weekend and stayed here for two nights. Part of the Morgan Group of hotels so expensive but a good experience. A very understated hotel from the outside but very trendy, shabby chic inside. We had a great room with an enormous silver sleigh bed, ultra white walls and ceiling, very minimalist. About to undergo a refurbishment but all of the rooms are kept to a very high standard and are very Clean. Staff very helpful and polite. We prefer St Martins lane but only because it is more central within the West End. The Sanderson is about 10 minutes walk from Soho and may be 15 to Covent Garden. A great experience, thank you.",4,2013,12,08
132,The strangest hotel... in such a great way,"Amazing hotel to stay in - loved the total individuality of their decor. I wasn't sure what to think of the perspex wall divisions with curtains within the rooms, no hotel I've ever been to could even attempt to adopt such interior design.... and be so good at it. 
There was no 'view' from the room (just more buildings & fire escapes), but does that really matter when a hotel is so central, as good as on Oxford st.  
I slept like a rock in this hotel, it just exudes comfort (!) I'd definitely recommend it and will return in the future. ",5,2013,12,06
132,I owe them my first born!,"I've stayed in their standard room, the Superior King & the Balcony Loft. The loft is an absolute dream of course but I keep going back to the standard because it is spacious enough yet cozy.
I think they have the best service. I love the concierge Cam & Mike who get us all sorts of impossible restaurant bookings and theatre tickets at super short notice ... to them I owe my first born. I love the intimate atmosphere at the purple bar, where there is always an awesome mixologist & gorgeous hostess who make you not want to leave the place. The room service is excellent too & the minibar is packed with all sorts of goodies!",5,2013,12,05
132,Retro Cool,"Arrived last Saturday morning at 10am expecting that we would have to disappear and return later for our hotel room, however it was ready which was great so we checked in speedily and efficiently. The lift is amazing....just completely different from any other lift.....reflects the whole hotel really.....all very different.....from the reception area to the resident bar and the very quirky bedrooms with artwork on the ceiling and curtain separators between bedroom and bathroom! We stayed in a deluxe room which I think is the starting category and it was perfectly adequate! All the decor is artsy and cool.....very different and lots of imagination used in the design! The long bar was buzzy on Saturday evening.....full of 30-40 something beautiful people! Staff on the door of resident bar (only open late night!) was a bit up her own backside and repeatedly questioned us about whether we were staying in the hotel and thus qualified to be in the bar.....all a bit pompous and over the top to be honest....she was about 18 years old and barely legal herself let alone quizzing 2 doctors in their 30s who were spending over £15 per GLASS of wine- so a bit intrusive and annoying. Found a fabulous hotel up the road called the Edition which had the most amazing bar and literall 10seconds away-drinks not as expensive and ambiance much better....with no annoying hostess!!! Had room service which was very nice and prompt...but this was at 2am on Sunday night so I can't imagine they were too busy then! Check out was speedy and all reception staff seemed friendly. Relatively expensive.....would stay again if i got a deal but would try somewhere else next time! ",4,2013,12,03
132,Too cool for school - and they lost our cakes!,"As a regular patron of the Long Bar and the Mad Hatter's Tea Party I thought I would treat us to an afternoon and night at The Sanderson. We couldn't eat all of our sandwiches and cakes so these we're put away in the fridge for us to take home the next day... These were promptly lost by the staff. We had a loft suite with balcony which was ok although quite noisy.

The Long Bar was so busy that it was impossible to get served so we ended up eating and drinking at Gaucho. Even when we returned the Long Bar was still too busy to serve us mere residents.

We are having another night in town before Christmas but I've booked a different, very nice hotel in Fitzrovia which we've always wanted to stay at and have been to on many occasions for drinks / dinner",2,2013,12,02
132,Aqua spa.. Very nice!,"Just visited the spa at the Sanderson hotel.. I had a very good time.. The service was very good, the massage was good and there is no rush to leave the spa! Very nice place to come solo... I also has a glass of champagne, a salad and a little work out at the gym.. The value for money is great!",4,2013,12,02
132,Not as good as it use to be!,Over the years I have stayed at the Sanderson hotel quite a lot but sadly I think it will now be the last as I feel that when spending a lot of money it use to feel very special but on my last visit with friend it certainly didn't feel special just felt we weren't conforming to there rules . We ordered some drinks in the long bar then realised there was no seating so headed to the purple bar only to be told quite abruptly u can't take those glasses in there u have to order another drink in the purple bar ! so we tried to sit in reception  and was then told can't sit there also ! whilst the hotel still looks great they need to realise that other hotels in the area have come up if not exceeded the customer service you use to get there !,2,2013,11,27
132,A nice surprise,"I was allocate this hotel through a ' secret hotel' discount online and was a little nervous of how my stay would be as I am more old fashioned when it comes to my style of hotels I usually stay in. I need not have worried as everything was excellent. From accomodating my request for a quiet room with bath to the friendly welcome , everything was done to make me feel comfortable. The hotel itself and the rooms are styled in a modern but comfortable way , lay out is unusual but works well , the bathroom was especially good. Simple things like a decent shower , high quality towels and plenty of bathroom lotions and potions were nice touches that make hotels stand out.The bed was very comfortable and breakfast was a real treat , again the fact that the room service team rang me to tell me my breakfast would be 10 minute late was appreciated and the coffee was piping hot , a big tick from me on that one ! I really enjoyed my stay here , I would recommend to all.",5,2013,11,25
132,"Good hotel, great public spaces",Stayed here for one night on business. The hotel has a great feel from the moment you walk in and see the big red lips. The rooms are simple but interesting and the bar area with attached Japanese garden is an excellent place to start an evening out.,4,2013,11,24
132,A stylish central london hotel,"Very stylish, room felt spacious but certainly wasn't massive, modern (clean design) furnishings and design (open plan with bathroom).

Location is central, quite good for shopping (just off Oxford street and a short walk from Regent street) but don't expect any good views from this one - our room was at the front, directly in front of a row of quite drab looking offices.

Breakfast was the only meal we had here during our stay - it was very good quality, even if the choice was a bit limited compared to some other hotel breakfasts.

Service was professional but nothing to write home about.  Champagne bar is great when busy, but don't feel you have to pay the exorbitant 'service charge' if all the guy has done is hand you a bottle of beer.",4,2013,11,24
132,Urban retreat in Central London,"I have been to The Sanderson many times over the times but have never stayed so this was a first. This  hotel is not your traditional London hotel- it is super stylish and modern in every way, from The Long Bar to residents only The Purple Bar. The door man, who I think was called Phil made us feel very welcome and immediately greeted outside and helped us with luggage from our car . Reception and check in again was faultless and also the concierge, who I think was called Sean ( im useless with names!) , was really helpful with different guestlist options for local clubs and casinos. The cocktails are out of this world and no they arent cheap but i didnt feel this place was anymore expensive than any other luxury hotel in London. We also received birthday cupcakes in room, which was a nice surprise!
The rooms are very quirky and contemporary, which myself and my husband love, being fans of Phillip Starke design- it probably isnt everyones cup of tea
Breakfast was great, they even serve my favourite Burford Brown eggs, always a good sign!
An amazing hotel to put your glad rags on and mingle with trendy people and hear great music- we will certainly be back.....",5,2013,11,20
132,Very Cool Hotel,"I went to the Sanderson Hotel for the first time in 2000 and loved it, its a modern boutique type hotel so if you don't like hotels like Morgan Hotel Group Properties this place wont be for you, but if you like the trendy bar with the ambient background music with a very cool crowd most evenings you'll dig this spot. Much like its other trendy hotels the rooms are minimalist and most the action is in the lobby bar",5,2013,11,19
132,Great in Central London,Have stayed here many times over the past two years.  The rooms are small but well appointed and very comfortable.  Good aircon and heating. TV has all key international and domestic channels.  The beds are awesome and bathrooms are up to date and very clean.  Just make sure you don't end up in a room above the bar as it can crank 'till late and if you need to be in bed early this can be an issue.  Food is good too!,4,2013,11,15
132,Very noisy in rooms and too cool for its own good,Seemed like having a fab hotel experience was an afterthought to the trendy hip bar where if you weren't showing off you were out of place. Even the so called guests bar seemed to be reserved for non guests. Rooms basic but clean but don't accept a low floor front facing room as all you hear all night is car doors and drunken shrieks!,3,2013,11,10
132,Edgy but not practical,Rooms are basic without many amenities.  Breakfast was a disaster this morning.  Only half the order eventually arrived...and in random order.  Hoping that things get better before departing.  Don't think that I will return.,3,2013,11,06
132,Design is cool but usability is a must,"The owners worked so hard to make it cool, that they forgot that people want to enjoy the stay.

No power outlet close to bed, no storage space for cloths, no privacy in the toilet (noise), just one set of shampoo and conditioner for two adults ( I guess because there is no space to place them in the shower).

And a dirty towel was left in the room - nicely folded though....

But that's cool, so I guess who cares?

The king is naked!!!!

Not coming back and not recommending.",2,2013,11,02
132,Special!!!!,"From the moment you walk in you start an adventure. We stayed here for my birthday on friday 25/10/2013 and were treated like rock stars! Any niggles, problems or requests you might have will be handled professionally and efficently. Nothing is to much trouble. The staff at the Sanderson across all departments are all trained well and are there to ensure you fully enjoy your stay and leave happy! We stayed in a deluxe King room, it was huge!! The use of the sheer curtains and lights made the space a beautiful place to be and we left feeling so relaxed and rested. The bed is the most comfortable I have ever slept on it was perfect. Will deffo stay here again! ",5,2013,10,31
132,Exceptional Sanderson,"The slick and hip Sanderson just about ticks every box one can think of: central London location, amazing design throughout the hotel, super cool bar, and attention to every little detail in the rooms! 
And if all the above aren't enough, the service is second to none! I simply can't praise the staff enough - we had some problems with our reservation before arrival (not through fault of the hotel, but rather that the booking with our travel agent did not appear on the hotel's system) and they were amazing in following up, offering a very personalised service. 
Our request for a quiet room was fully taken into consideration and upon mention of a special celebratory weekend, we arrived to an upgraded room, lit with candles, with champagne on ice waiting for us....We really couldn't have asked for more. 
A very special mention to Katie who assisted us with the all reservation issues and Emily at concierge, who was fantastic with recommendations. Both went out of their way to ensure that our stay was perfect!",5,2013,10,29
132,They didn't even offer me a drink. ,Booked a room here tonight. Turned up and they had no rooms available!! Not a good start. They booked me into a Neo Georgian hotel down the road. Not pleased. Manager didn't even offer us a drink. Sad as we have been here so many times before. I came here last month and waited 40 minutes to get served at the bar. This place has gone down hill. If you want somewhere as hip as it used to be here go the the ME Hotel. ,1,2013,10,26
132,Great place,"This is our favorite hotel in London! Me and my wife we go there very often for a week end break after work, we love the style of this place and we love the purple bar for a drink, it makes us feeling great!",5,2013,10,22
132,Quirky Chic..,"Lovely hotel set just off Oxford Street.  We stayed here in the Summer, only for one night - the rooms are fairly small, but they are very nicely furnished, beds are comfy and the shower / bathroom facilities are good.  We basically chose this hotel for the location.  It was my Husbands birthday and we decided to have a night away (we live in Dubai) and usually stay with family in the UK, so it was nice to be on our own.  

The bar on the ground floor is very quirky, well worth a visit.  The main bar to right of the reception as you walk into the hotel is always very buzzy. 

The breakfast is very good, the staff very friendly, and I would say very good value for money.  A good place to base yourself if you are visiting London to do some shopping or want to see the sights.",4,2013,10,21
132,Good Central Location,"very friendly staff, was there for a week, excellent facilities. Took the hotel 3 days to repair the air con fir a fridge, then to  a sauna before it was finally fixed.

The lifts are have 3d space pictures, if your not drunk when u get in, you feel drunk when u get out.

The corridors have very dim lighting which could be a problem for those with a sight disability",4,2013,10,09
132,Great Trendy Hotel,"My friend and I stayed at the Sanderson Hotel, London as a treat on Saturday 5th October.  As soon as we arrived by taxi the doors were opened and our cases were taken to reception.  The doormen were very attentive, opening doors and hailing taxis for us when required.  We had requested a twin room but was given a double but Reception moved us immediately to a King Sized room with two quilts which was fine.  The rooms were very unusual but very clean and spacious.  Bed was really comfortable.  The Reception area was very trendy and the Long Bar was brilliant.  You should also try the Purple Bar, very romantic for couples.  Also have to mention the lifts which were like being in 3D space.  We also had the Mad Hatters Afternoon Tea here which was excellent and quirky.  Our only criticism was the noise from the bar at 1am but when we called down to reception they turned the music down slightly.  The drinks were also very expensive but there were plenty of places to walk to if you wanted to go a bit cheaper.",5,2013,10,08
132,"Central Location, young crowd.","Was just over for a long weekend at the end of September. Location is pretty great; a mellow side street off of the crowded and tacky Oxford street. Pretty close to several tube stops and the buses and cabs on Oxford. Easy walking distance to Regents, Liberty, Soho, British Museum, etc. Very central. 
In typical Schrager fashion the rooms and public spaces are more funky than functional, and the party goes late and loud. As in past 2AM, in the courtyard under your window. We slept fine due to exhaustion and nice boozy dinners- and we are from NYC. But others may have issues. And I will say the bathrooms are a bit much- the shower and sink hardware is tough to use- there are no shelves or baskets in the shower so everything ends upon the floor, there isn't mush privacy while using the toilet, etc- typical Schrager/Morgan's style. I sort of like it. 
Breakfasts were good. Concierge got us a nice reservation last minute at a popular restaurant. We arrived early in the morning and we were able to use the spa to shower and freshen up before storing our bags and heading out for the day. Nice attentive staff.",4,2013,10,03
132,"Kooky, modern hotel in the heart of London!","I had the pleasure of staying at Sanderson in 2010 when I came to London for a wedding. The reception area is stunning with funky furniture and white silk sheets hanging from the walls giving the place a very lux feel. The room was gorgeous, sticking with the interesting furniture and silk curtain theme, beautiful bathroom/wet room and the bed was soooo comfy! The lift is crazy!!!! Almost pitch black with 3D holograms covering the walls and ceiling made you feel like you were floating in space :) after the wedding we went to the private bar reserved only for guests. My partner had a whisky cocktail & a G&T, I had 3 apple & mint martinis (UNBELIEVABLE!!) unfortunately so was the £90 bill! Good job I wasn't paying!

Last year I treated my Mum to dinner @ Suka for her birthday. We had a stunning Malaysian banquet with a free cocktail! I found the offer on TopTable so the meal was very good value. My only niggle is that the waiter asked if we wanted water for the table which we assumed would be free and it wasn't! Won't make that mistake again!! 

If you have the money, you should definitely stay here. It can come across a little pretentious but it's a luxury 5* boutique hotel. It's supposed to be like that!! The staff are lovely, food and drink superb and if you're lucky you may spot a celeb in the Long Bar! 
I will definitely come back to try the afternoon tea... And another apple and mint martini!! :D",5,2013,10,01
132,Sanderson is a very well located hotel in London,"I have been staying at the Sanderson for many years-mostly staying there when i travel for business. Very comfortable hotel. Centrally located in Soho. Rates that are reasonnsable for that location. A staff that is very helpful. Only drawback will be for some, the very busy and sometimes a bit too loud bar. It is quite important to request a room on the upper floors and rooms that are far away from the bar. I did spend one or two nights in the past, trying to go to sleep with a lot of background noise coming from the bar! Restaurant is very good as well-both for breakfast and lunch/dinner. They also have a great terrace as part of the bar and restaurant. A deifinite recommend.",4,2013,09,30
132,Edgy and modern but lacks the personal touch,"I stayed for 6 nights and overall my experience was positive. Fabulous location.

It didn't start well though when I rang to add another day to my booking.  It seems that 'third party bookings' (I booked through Wotif), are considered as separate and I was told I needed to go back to the original booking and change it. My response was, er, you're the hotel reservation service, can't you help me?  There was reluctance.  Anyway we got over that hurdle, although with some insistence on my part!

Hotel was beautiful: decor stunning, rooms cool, clean and suitably minimalist for a hotel of this kind. Sheets and doona good quality,lots of towels and really nice bathroom products. Floaty curtains between bedroom and bathroom added to the atmosphere.  One thing with the bathroom - it didn't have an electricity socket. When I asked about it I was told none of the rooms do. Huh?  I needed to dry my hair and surely many men would need to shave?? 

At a practical level, I would have really liked to be able to make myself a cup of tea or coffee.  Fridge full of alcohol, snacks and sweets but no tea or coffee. Given the price of the rooms it would be nice to have tea, coffee and a basic breakfast included in he rate.

I found the staff quite nice and helpful, yes they like to reflect the uber cool tone of the place, but that's to be expected.  

I once read that the definition of a good hotel is a place you never want to leave.  Six nights was too long for me at the Sanderson.  A weekend would be great, but for me a longer term stay requires a more personal touch.

Maybe I'm just not cool enough....",3,2013,09,29
132,Absolutly fab!,Great service. Super clean design hotel. Friendly and 5 star experience. We loved the stay and look forward to coming back. Quite busy and smooth vibe in the evening bars. Rooms are superior. Spa access free and only minor catch is the 10 pound internet access. ,5,2013,09,29
132,Mixed review,"Too many mixed feelings about this hotel, so listed pros and cons below:

Pros:
Location - 2 mins walk from Oxford St shopping, 5 mins talk to 2 different tube stations. 3 mins walk to Charlotte St restaurants
Theme: Stunning lobby and lobby bars. Stunning pool room. Furniture is beautiful and beyond modern.
Rooms: Very beautiful and modern. Nicely decorated and provide an oasis to the city.

Cons:
There's a real snobbish feel about the staff. I was questioned in the lift (with my room key in my hand) if I was a guest of the hotel. Yes, I paid the exorbitant price to stay here. Yes, I had a room key, and yes, I also looked haggered and jet-lagged, but don't question people.
The lobby bar is a real destination for nearby workers to come have a drink after work, so it was very busy and noisy after 5pm
Way too overpriced for what it is - a funky hotel. No extra added services. No brekkie included or anything.
Elevator is disgusting. Its almost pitch black in there with solar-system-like walls and lights. It made me feel sick every time I entered it. Also, hallways to rooms are very dark.",3,2013,09,27
132,unusual hotel,"stayed for one night, very unusual furniture but looks really good, lovely modern room apart from odd picture on the ceiling above the bed, also no tea or coffee making facilities. would recomend this hotel",5,2013,09,22
132,Great Last minute stay!,"Positives:
-  Great Bed
-  Great Room layout having the bathtub/shower open to the entire room
-  Restaurant/Bar have great food and AMAZING COCKTAILS
-  Great Customer Service, everyone was very helpful 
(Stayed at the Langham Lonon on previous trip, they had horrible service)
-  Great gym for a hotel

Needs Improvement
-  Can't think of any just yet...",5,2013,09,20
132,Very Good,"Excellent value for this neighborhood.  Sanderson is one of those ""ultra hip"" ""ultra modern"" interior designs. If you are not into that sort of thing...it might be a little annoying.    I particularly like it and think that the modern open design of the rooms really maximizes the space.  However it is used in other places to cleverly disguise what are REALLY SMALL elevators and REALLY SMALL hallways.    The dark hallways are just plain creepy.  However the hotel is otherwise excellent with superb staff.  For London breakfast is absolutely superb.  Try to get a room not facing the bar.  Its a bit loud at night.",4,2013,09,16
132,Contemporary,"Despite the tired & dull exterior once you walk through the doors you are met with quirky chairs and decor. Bedrooms are smart but we did find the corridors quite dark and oppressive.  Space lifts were a great hit with the children.  Music from the bar not family friendly and eventually went off about 1.30am sunday morning but probably due to the power cut.  We were on second floor but could hear it quite well.   All staff were really friendly and spoke to us. We were made to feel welcome in our three day stay. Beds very comfortable. Rooms nice size for central London, we had a superior room. Staff were attentive and twice daily room attendant brilliant with a family. Lights dimmed and candle lit in evening a nice touch.  Downsides were noise at/during night, also from guests. Queues at check out time we're long and process took about 15 mins. Didn't get to eat at hotel as was in London for a nearby launch. Excellent location for us.",3,2013,09,16
132,Stylish laid back hotel,"We recently stayed for the weekend at this perfectly located hotel.
Our welcome was very warm at reception and our room was found by taking the ""galactic"" lift which was an experience.
Our room was bright,large and very comfortable and the bed enormous.
The shower was good and the toiletries very pleasant.
We enjoyed a very good and comprehensive breakfast with a wide range of fruits,cereals,breads etc.
The cooked breakfast was very well cooked and again the service was excellent.
We enjoyed drinks in the""residents only"" Purple bar and again we were very well looked after.
The prices are five star but to be fair so is the service.
The only slight complaint is that for the price we pay for the room we would expect tea and coffee making facilities.",5,2013,09,11
132,Amazing!!!,"We love staying at this hotel while we are in London. It's not the newest of places but is still a London landmark. The bars, the people, the food. The rooms are a bit small but that's london. We stay here as much as possible ",5,2013,09,09
132,Luxury and Elegance at the highest level,"Fantastic lobby, super rooms and friendly and helpful staff. The effect of the curtain 'walls' in the hotel lobby and rooms is marvelous, almost magical. 
In all a very pleasant and comfortable stay. Close to Oxford st. and Piccadilly Circus.",5,2013,09,04
132,Loved it.,"Recently stayed for 3 nights on a business trip at the Sanderson in London. Gorgeous hotel!!
Loved the room, bed was amazingly comfortable. Also loved the restaurant and bar. Great location close to Oxford St.
Service was also wonderful and staff really friendly and helpful.
I will definately stay here again.",5,2013,08,31
132,Service excellence,The staff at this hotel are outstanding. The food is truly fantastic and the room design is unique and brilliant. There was no aspect of my stay that was negative in any way. This is definitely a hotel that I would be happy to stay at again in the future. ,5,2013,08,30
132,Very poor experience,"I don't know where to begin... let's start with positive aspect hence the reason why 2/5 and not 1/5..
The design is interesting and the room was nice, it is a very different concept and I enjoyed it. I wanted to book a spa treatment but they didn't have the slot I wanted available but I have to say that the young lady at reception was very friendly, she's the one earning a 5* here..

However, the service was the main problem, although I came across some nice, friendly and interesting people who had a good 5* attitude, I would say 80% of the staff were not good enough for that standard. Lack of knowledge, poor attitude, no empathy..

The atmosphere is like walking into a very snobbish and posh club where people only look at you if you are a celebrity or if you wear flashy expensive Kanye West / Lady gaga like clothes..
I did not feel the 5* experience at all and I felt staff weren't people person who care about service and making a difference.

I live in London and never stay in hotels in the capital so it was exceptionnal however I often go to bars and restaurants within 5* hotels but I very much doubt i'll go there again (or maybe the Spa), this is really not for me.",2,2013,08,29
132,exquisite simplicity,"Philippe Starck has made this hotel a real pleasure to stay in. Right from the entrance lobby, with the red lips sofa welcoming you, or the bar stools looking right at you with wondering eyes. The rooms are exquisite: no walls, just pinkish drapes separate you from the bathroom and its wonderful set up. The painting hanging from the ceiling, skewed at the same angle my bed was, just blew me away. I loved it. Minimal decor, very white. A nice Starck sculpture also serves as weights while watching TV...Nice bed, great pillows, a superb sound and tv system, internet connection... if you can afford it, this is the place to stay in London. Staff are very kind and ready to help. WOuld go back any time",4,2013,08,26
132,Decadent,"We had a fabulous stay midweek. The Malaysian restaurant & the Purple bar were my highlights. We didn't feel the need to step outside the hotel & enjoyed a great evening chilling out over fantastic food and drinks. Our room was great & I particularly liked the turn down service with tea lights being lit and fresh towels. The rooms were a little tired in terms of decor but it didn't take away from the overall experience. 

Quirky touches like the painting on the ceiling were fun. Hypoallergenic bedding wasn't too much trouble. Staff were very friendly, great at recommending dishes for dinner and didn't make us feel rushed at any point.

Atmosphere is great and fantastic for people watching. 

I loved the Salvador Dali sofa in the lobby & the lifts were great, if slightly disorientating with a hologram feel. 

Can't wait to go back!",5,2013,08,23
132,Alternative stay in London,"We arrived late saturday night for 1 nights stay, When we arrived the hotel was very busy we were checked in and shown to our rooms the lifts the decor the whole hotel is so quirky and modern we loved it straight away.
from the space lifts to the Famous Sanderson Lips loved it all. only problem we had we were only there for such a short stay we didn't have chance to fully use all the hotels facilities. We found all the staff so polite and couldn't do enough the service at the The Sanderson blows the likes of the St Pancras renaissance out of the water were we have stayed service times before and always been up against rude staff!! Will 100% be returning to the The sanderson very soon. You can see what its such a popular fav of many celebs :)",5,2013,08,21
132,A stylish dig!,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Sanderson during our most recent trip to London and it was quite magnificent. The rooms are stylish: all-white, contemporary in design, bright (a wall of windows, at least in the room we stayed in) and in the center of the room a large bed which was probably my favorite feature - it was sooo comfortable that I wanted to stay in it all day. Possibly the best sleep I've ever had. The bathroom - which is separated from the bedroom by a curtain - is incredibly spacious and is equipped with yummy Malin+Goetz products. In fact the rooms at the the Sanderson are bigger than most of what you'd typically find in London hotels. The lobby is colorful and chic - reminds me a little bit of the Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas which has the same kind of plush and clubby (and self-consciously cool) neon/glass/plastic/velvet aesthetic going. The Philippe Starck-designed billiards room which also had a 2nd level lounge is awesome and surprisingly sparsely trafficked - there were never more than a couple of people playing every time we walked by. I didn't get to sit at the bar but it was crowded with sleek beautiful people on the Thursday night we were there. Friday didn't get as much action, for some reason. I get the feeling many trendy young hipsters hang out there, much as they do in NYC at the Standard Hotel or some similar fashionably ""it"" place. Service was very good. But most memorable was the room and the BED!!!",5,2013,08,20
132,Wonderful Stay,"Just had a wonderful two night stay.  We normally stay at The Mayfair, but prices are fairly high with little to offer other than the Mayfair location so we thought we'd give The Sanderson a try.
So glad we did.  The hotel is funky and quirky.  The rooms are airy and light  with lovely toiletries. 
We had the afternoon tea which was superb.
 We ate in the restaurant and drank numerous cocktails in The Long Bar, all highly recommended. 
They had complimentary bikes which we took full use of on the Sunday and cycled all over London.
We will definitely stay here on our next visit and would recommend to friends and family. ",5,2013,08,20
132,Sin city hideaway extraordinaire!,"Our stay was made even more special by the fabulous JJ !cant wait to come again! 
It was my birthday weekend and they sent up an iced comp bottle of Sav Blanc. Very nice indeed :) 
Reception was fast, friendly (JJ was super personable) and efficient. 

The beds were like soft fluffy clouds with ample pillows and Egyptian cotton duvet that actually leaves me dissatisfied with my own bed!

Cocktails ,, amazing albeit quite pricey. 
Cinnamon & Lemongrass Martini amazing! 

They've made it really hard to want to stay anywhere else in our kickass Capital.

Au Revoir for now!  
Xxx",5,2013,08,18
132,Love this hotel,"Rooms are nice, fresh and Airy my partner and I stayed for a anniversary weekend. Good service reasonably priced in a fab location. 
Don't miss out on the Purple Bar for residence, the chocolate martinis although a little expensive are amazing, definitely worth a visit.",5,2013,08,15
132,Agua Spa is heavenly,"I haven't been to the Agua Spa at The Sanderson for a while and now I remember why I used to visit so often.
I had a lovely full body massage with Matthew a few weeks ago. Exceptional customer service from the moment I arrived to when I left. Professional massage, followed by a light dinner and a relaxing time in the private pod areas afterwards.
A real treat. Completely forgot I was in Central London.
I am going again on Thursday and will reinstate my once a month visits.",5,2013,08,12
132,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"stayed just one night in July and can't wait to go back.  The room was white, spacious and comfortable.  The style of the hotel is cool with some kooky elements.  The location is perfect for shopping/theatre.  We didn't eat here, but we had a great night in the bar.  There is plenty of space including an outside area as well as a really great pool room.  Watch out for the London bar prices is the only negative thing I would say - £95 for a bottle of Prosecco makes it a little bitter to swallow!  The staff are constantly on hand to ensure you are looked after at every turn - from the minute you pull up outside to the comp water and luggage help when you leave.   Make sure you use the designer lifts when you arrive!  Overall, I can't wait to return for another fabulous weekend.",5,2013,08,12
132,Amazing,"Stayed in a Superior King room for one night as a celebration of our Wedding anniversary.
We were not disappointed. This hotel is quirky, weird, odd but truely amazing. We loved it. The staff were fantastic, could not do enough for us. The bed and shower were brilliant.
We were treated like we were the most important visitors they had ever had.
Breakfast was great as well",5,2013,08,10
132,Want to go back!!,"This for me was a dream come true. From the rooms to the service, everything was top notch. I didn't drink at the bar or use the restaurant but can tell you it looked pretty snazzy and modern. The whole hotel has a very modern feel to it. The room was amazing and I could of stood under the shower for hours. The bed was huge and very comfortable. I was a female staying alone for 2 nights and the staff could not of been more helpful, they seem to know everything about the area and can give great recommendations on where to go and what to do in London. I found them very friendly and approachable. It is nice and central, close to tube stations. I would certainly stay there again and would encourage anybody else to do the same.",5,2013,08,08
132,Loved it!,"We stayed on Saturday night in a standard room.  We loved the design of the hotel.  It felt modern, airy, clean & spacious with a buzzing happy atmosphere.

The staff were truly 5 star from the moment we stepped out of our car.  From the door staff to the front desk to the concierges, they were had just the right mix of friendliness & efficiency without an ounce of stuffiness.  We used the valet parking which was efficient & reasonable.  The only small issue was their recommendation of Dean St Townhouse which I've done a separate review about

The room, despite being the cheapest, was lovely.  The queen bed was easily large enough for us. The idea of setting the bed in the centre of the room worked so well.  It was very comfortable with clean, fresh linen & comfy pillows.

The minimal design of the room was just to our taste.  It was light, fresh & clean with design touches such as the shelf with weights & exercise suggestions.  The glass partitions & voile curtains softened the whiteness.  We loved it!

The shower was powerful & sleek & the toiletries excellent. The only small suggestions for improvement would be to swap the towel rail & mirror in the bathroom so that you can reach your towels when you've finished showering & to supply a kettle for those of us who enjoy a hot drink in bed!

The rest of the hotel is also excellent although the bar prices are a little expensive & I would have liked the option of a cava or prosecco which is a lighter drink than champagne.

We will certainly stay there again & thank you to all the staff who looked after us",4,2013,08,07
132,Great spot in London!,"Loved that the location is quiet but a short walk to Oxford St mayhem. Our suite was quirky but comfortable and my daughter was not happy with the glass bathroom walls, but we managed.

Any shortcomings are more than made up for by the ever helpful and knowledgeable staff.

Would definitely stay there again.",4,2013,08,05
132,fantastic hotel,"I had an amazing experience throughout my stay at the Sanderson.

The entrance area is very quirky and modern with a billiards room just off the main area which is great to see.  
Check in was easy with friendly & helpful staff.
We upgraded to a suite with a terrace and the room was just stunning.  Very minimalist but it works perfectly.  From the terrace we could see the BT tower, the Shard and Big Ben.

Had drinks at the long bar which were lovely, went to use the other bar at about 1/2am but was empty so just went back to our room.

Ordered room service but was extremely slow, the hotel were very apologetic though, and the food was good.
Breakfast in the morning was delicious with a good variety available.

Location is perfect, 20 second walk off oxford street, near to soho etc

I cant fault this hotel, I just wish I could afford to stay here on every visit to london.  Very similar to St Martins Lane as they are from the same chain, I struggle to chose my favourite but this might just beat it.",5,2013,08,01
132,Excellent Stay,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a night away from the kids. It is a modern, boutique hotel with a trendy lay out. Reception was efficient and welcoming. Our room was modern and minimalist, but comfortable and with everything one requires. Very comfortable bed and luxurious bathroom. Room service breakfast was included in our package and was quick to cone to the room. The cocktail bar downstairs is also fun. Highly recommended for a central London break with a modern, young edge.",5,2013,07,28
132,Fun place to stay in London,"I stayed here for a hot week in July and thoroughly enjoyed the Long Bar and its terrace before dinner and the purple bar after dinner.  Decent sized room for London, but the desk was not that functional for a business trip.  Will likely stay again next week.  Great concierge.",4,2013,07,25
132,A night to remember,"I booked a room at The Sanderson for my partner's 30th birthday and was not disappointed!
I told the manager that it was a special occasion, and we were made to feel special from the moment we arrived - the receptionist greeted us with news that we had been a given a complimentary room upgrade to a deluxe! After a relaxing massage in the Agua spa my partner was given a card and a selection of luxury cosmetics, and as if we didn't have enough cakes; she was presented with an additional one at the Mad Hatters Afternoon Tea with a message written in chocolate on the plate! To top this off, a bottle of chilled champagne awaited us when we returned to our room compliments of the house!

After an evening at the theatre we went to the hotel's 'Purple bar' to be greeted by the Bar manager Thierry who, to apologise for not having a table available immediately, took us through to the long bar and gave us a complimentary drink. When a table became free, he returned to escort us through to the Purple Bar where we finished our evening.

Breakfast, again was subject to a complimentary upgrade to finish off our fantastic stay!

We will definitely be returning again in the future!

Thank you!",5,2013,07,22
132,Special,"Annually we pick a hotel for a one night break, this year it was The Sanderson.  We were not disappointed.  The staff were very helpful and our room was huge.  Obvious from the outside it is an old office block and it does reflect inside but the design of the rooms is superb.  
Some 5* hotels supply tea or coffee facilities for the room, this hotel does not. 
The room was big and the TV rather small but that did not matter as we used the room just to sleep and freshen up.
Cocktails are wonderful, try the Dilicious or, if you like sweeter then Vanilla Spice, have a few! Break the bank!

Definitely worth a visit.  Sit on the lips!
",4,2013,07,21
132,AMAZING HOTEL. GO FOR IT.,"This is by far one of the best hotels in London. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Amazing design. Stylish and sophisticated atmosphere, terrific spa and fitness facilities, great restaurant and bar and central location, just steps from SOHO nightlife, Oxford St shipping and West End theatres. Marcela from the front desk was very kind when I requested an upgrade as I have the Morgans Hotel Global Card, and she upgraded my room to a huge 1 King Bed beautiful room. Can't be more pleased with my stay and can't wait to be back. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I stayed at the St Martins Lane before and had the same experience, it was as great at the Sanderson, so please consider that one too.",5,2013,07,18
132,My boyfriend's birthday weekend!,"I have eaten at the Suka restaurant many times over the years and been to the long bar and never been disappointed so thought this would be a good choice to stay and eat for my boyfriend's birthday!
I decided to go all out and go for the Loft room with balcony- when we got to the room I nearly cried! The bedroom was tiny and shabby! Furniture chipped and marks on floors- And as for the balcony..it looked like a council flat! Old furniture, creeking floorboards that moved when you walked on them, broken off dead looking bamboos in pots and furniture that lets just say looked very 'weathered'! I quickly called the front desk to complain and was immediately upgraded to a suite apartment that was incredible! It was very minimalist and cool and immediately cheered us both up!
We had dinner with 7 other family and friends at Suka that evening-we were given a set menu(that I had previously chosen) and every course was mouthwateringly good! And to finish off they brought out a delicious chocolate birthday cake! The cocktails were yummy as always.
The following day we had room service breakfast which was really good followed later in the day by the Mad Hatters afternoon tea! This really was amazing! I honestly can say I have had anything quite like it and have since bought friends vouchers for birthday presents in hope I'll get an invite! Heehee... Overall the staff were brilliant, and the hotel and amenities fabulous, my only suggestion is that the rooms are getting a bit tired and need a revamp! Thank you for a great stay!",4,2013,07,18
132,Sanderson simply rocks.......best of the best!,"I have stayed at Sanderson few times and every time I stay here my experience gets better,  Not only Sanderson is very unique hotel with everything you can want in a hotel but what's special about this hotel is their staff.  From the guys up at the front door to front desk to bartenders and waiters to the General Manager they are all creme d'la creme of the hotel industry.  Not to forget their concierge, these guys are by far the best and another reason to stay at Sanderson.  I'm a demanding traveler at times and have stayed at many five star properties globally including Ritz, Four Seasons, St, Regis and even the Burj-al-Arab in Dubai but Sanderson has a very special place in my heart,  Team Sanderson seems to get better every time I stay there and go above and beyond to make my stay an awesome experience.  Hope this trend continues and I look forward to my next stay........can't wait to go back! Bravo guys!",5,2013,07,18
132,Repeat visit and even better than before - if possible!,"Just had a repeat visit at the Sanderson hotel and it was even better than the last time we stayed if that is possible.

We thought the bar area was superb and offered a very relaxing ambience, with professional and attentive staff as we have got to expect.

We will certainly be back again but see how they can improve any higher.",5,2013,07,09
132,Nice Design hotel and very central,I enjoyed the stay as the staff was very friendly and welcoming. The rooms are modern and functional with a great design. I also enjoyed the breakfast which had for example fresh fruits with a great quality.,4,2013,07,08
132,Quiet oasis,"Cool and hip but so very peaceful, worth it for the bathroom alone, great tub and hot shower.  But also tranquil and calm throughout.  Service and style goes without saying.  The bar downstairs and the larger restaurant bar (with the cool chairs) also great.  Cool area close to charlotte street.",4,2013,07,07
132,Best affordable hotel in London,"I almost gave the Sanderson 5 stars, except that it is not on the best street...but the restaurant's food was delicious and we did the Mad Hatter's tea party on Sunday, which was fantastic.  The room showers and beds were not the best, but it was overall very clean and comfortable so I would definitely stay there again!",4,2013,07,02
132,Wow,"From the minute we arrived inside we were made to feel special, I have to admit from the road the building doesn't' look as spectacular; but boy does it make up for it inside.
We were upgraded as it was my husband 40th to a Superior king so modern, clean and quirky, loved the bed in middle of the room, so light and airy and just that bit of luxury we wer looking for on this special occasion.

We went out for the afternoon and came back to the room before tea, the bed was so comfy I fell asleep, which I never do! Loved the whole room.

We decided to have breakfast in our room and so pleased we did, a little trolley appeared, which opened into a table for 2, and underneath we're cupboards that kept food warm. The food was amazing, 

Worth every penny and planning too return for my 40th early part of next year.",5,2013,07,02
132,very stylish,"Our overnight stay on the 27th June was made to celebrate our daughter's 18th birthday.  We stayed at The Royalton  in New York, their sister hotel, a couple of years ago.   Our experience at The Sanderson was equally fabulous.   The hotel staff were of a high standard, very experienced and happy.  There was a lot of them!  So reaching someone was instant - a rare thing I thought.   This is not ""corporate"" hotel with standard decor in the rooms.  It's beautifully designed throughout with a lot of thought.   No noise filtered to our impeccable room.  The location is superb for London attractions.  Thank you very much for a lovely unique stay. Mr & Mrs Tilley",5,2013,06,28
132,"Great rooms, quirky style, and convenient location","The room was awesome, loads of space, huge bed, bright white decor with lots of windows and loads of sockets. The bathroom had great toiletries, and we had no trouble with noise from other rooms.

We ate at the in house restaurant Suka, and the waitress was so helpful. The food is Malaysian street style, and you choose 2-3 dishes like for mezes or tapas. Anyway, they stopped us from ordering too much, and the food was delicious!

We ate outside in May, as they have heaters!

Would definitely stay here again!",5,2013,06,28
132,Chic cool hotel,"My daughter and I had the most beautiful, wonderful time at the Sanderson last week (14-18 June).
Awesome hospitality, amazing service and exceptional location. Room service was efficient and our room was beautiful. Only thing missing was a tea and coffee pot and when requested, was delivered within 5 minutes.

The staff were so nice and helpful and the Breakfast was terrific. Mike at guest services gave us great advice, we used the gym and had refreshing showers at the Spa.

Special mention to Gabby who looked after us each day at breakfast and the door men who literally would “run for a taxi” when needed.

We will come back again.
Thanks Jeff and Naomi D",5,2013,06,25
132,Trendy hotel,The Sanderson Hotel is a pretty cool hotel to stay in. The rooms are decorated in a very modern motif. Not that functional but really nice to look at and fun to sleep in. Kind of funky desk for working and lacks a comfortable chair. The bar is happening early but the beautiful crowd seems to have moved on.,4,2013,06,21
132,a bit dated?,"we stayed one night at the Sanderson hotel
Bedroom was a bit dated, maybe perfect 10-15 years ago.
The resident bar very nice though.
Bed super comfortable, one of the best I have ever slept on. room with no view.
Room service (we ordered a cocktail at 6pm) very slow,we were told they were busy with afternoon tea!
Our ipod dock wasnt working but the problem was fixed very quickly.
the room was in need of a bit of refreshing in my opinion.
Quite expensive condirering that breakfast was not included (although wifi was..)
we didnt go to the spa but it looked very nice and relazing.
The from bar (open to the public) looked very busy at 8pm, I guess it's a nice place for a drink and to be seen.",3,2013,06,18
132,Overpriced office block,"Stayed at this hotel on the 7th June 2013
I have read lots of reviews on this hotel and I'm thinking wow can't wait to get there and when I did was very disappointed 
Big queues to get checked in 5.45 big queues to check out 9.45 
Rooms for a five star hotel very small with everything in the room designed so you don't take any  souvenirs i.e. pencil with no hotel name on slippers no hotel name on etc I'm past that but if I was from the states I may like a little bit of a hotel souvenirs 
At the night time no where near enough staff had to wait 40 minutes to get a drink at £14 for a average cocktail at that price the staff should be falling over you when I tried to get another drink she said they where closed 
But the residents bar was open oh dear it was like a gangsters paradise dark tacky and way overpriced  
The place was an office block and if you have every been to someone's house where they have done it up on the cheap and tried to make look like they have spent a fortune this is it, cheap and tacky with paint peeling of the walls in the courtyards restrooms not up to standard. The breakfast restaurant area not good looked like a canteen but the service and the breakfast food I must say was excellent 
If your looking for a boutique type hotel go the W hotel in Leicester square where they have spent serious amounts of money the rooms are twice as good with a better location all for the same price if not cheaper",3,2013,06,13
132,"Comfortable, classy and central","Pros: great location, helpful staff, free bottled water in room, very comfortable beds, lots of thought put into the whole hotel, scary cool elevators, buzzing bar downstairs in the evenings, great breakfast.

Cons: lots of well dressed folks made me feel like I might be the worst dressed inhabitant!

Other: I loved the lack of extra hidden charges. For instance, when I asked for a full English breakfast (my package only included continental) I was only charged a modest upgrade fee instead of the full price.",4,2013,06,02
132,Spacious and Modern Boutique Hotel - Worth the Splurge,"My husband and I stayed here during a pre-Christmas holiday in London. The room was spacious, quiet and very modern.  The toiletries and towels were high quality. There was nowhere to power the hairdryer in the bathroom however I have been told that is a health and safety policy in London. 

The location was perfect with lots of great bars and restaurant within walking distance. We enjoyed delicious cocktails and a bit of people-watching at the bar on Friday night. There were lots of little touches like complimentary candy canes at the front desk. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,05,24
132,Is it a nighclub or a hotel ?,"Stayed here for a night with my wife. Chose it because of its proximity to Ronnie Scotts Jazz club. Was overall disappointed. The bar area which is in the actual reception lobby and not separated was packed with loud revelers something that I did not expect from a 5 star expensive hotel. There were a group of 6 or so 40/50 year old ""Geezers"" propositioning a group of young ladies loudly across the bar for all to hear which was cringy and embarrassing and this was at 4.30 in the afternoon! The decor was certainly different and interesting in the lobby and the pool room. The purple bar was also very nice and thankfully only allowed staying guests in it. The rooms were trying to be cool and trendy and looked nice on first impressions but were not practical at all. All net curtains and silly fittings. My wife hated it as nowhere to sit and put her make up on. The room was also very tired with scuffed up laminate wooden floor and floor tiles. All in all the hotel is not my taste. They should spend more time trying to be a 5 star hotel and less effort trying to be cool and trendy. Seeing scruffy young doormen with hair all over the place and skinny jeans tucked in Doc Marten boots with when you arrive sort of sets you up for what to expect. For £400 per night I will be going to more classy traditional hotels when I visit London in the future. The location was very good and I also liked the pool room and the purple bar (and the lifts were very cool) but did not like the fact that the long bar was used as walk in off the street ""boozer"" for large groups of men out on the razz. Really was more like nightclub than a hotel.",3,2013,05,23
132,First class luxury,"We stayed at this hotel for a birthday treat and honestly it is the loveliest place.  The atmosphere is very peaceful the rooms are excellent I would strongly recommend this for a city break,the location is excellent staff lovely and the eye bar very lively although you don't hear a thing from your room! Bliss!!",5,2013,05,20
132,Great Location and Service,"We enjoy staying here, have stayed here several times... Great location and the rooms are nice. It's modern and trendy, people seem to love the lobby for the lips couch and floating chairs, good for pics. The gym here is actually really decent. No issues. No complaints. I would definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2013,05,14
132,Amazing - would LOVE to go back!,"I booked the Sanderson for a long weekend in London with my boyfriend based on the fact that the location was great & the decor looked amazing!
We wouldn't usually spend this much on a hotel but i'm so glad we did as from the moment we arrived to the moment we left it was a true 5 star experience.
Firstly, the staff. I was a bit dubious as prior to our visit I read a few reviews about the staff being rude & even 'stuck up' but my experience was in fact the exact opposite. Everyone we came across was super friendly & helpful, especially a few of the male reception staff & the lady working in the purple bar. All very welcoming & their local knowledge of tube journeys & places to eat was excellent. Everytime we left or returned there was someone waiting at the front door to greet us & open it for us, one of the male staff members even remembered our names which we were so impressed with.
Secondly, the Room. We only booked one of the standard rooms however this was still 28 square meters so more than enough room! It was exceptionally clean. The decor was so unique, it really was special, I loved all the drapes & mood lights. The bed & pillows were the comfiest we'd ever been in, in any hotel EVER!
Lastly, make sure to visit the Purple Bar for a yummy cocktail. It is expensive but this is a hotel bar in London people! The bar has a really luxurious feel & is actually very cosy. We found it the perfect place to take the weight off after a long day of walking. 
We didn't try breakfast as there were lots of other nice places to go within walking distance so can't comment on that.
Next time we're back in London we're booking back in here for sure!! Thank you to all the staff for a very enjoyable stay :)

132,Outstanding Hotel in London,"The Sanderson is a gorgeous hotel with an incredibly helpful staff - my husband and I spent a long weekend there to see an Arsenal match and couldn't have picked a better property. Our Superior King room was so spacious with a huge bathroom, the whole property was lovely, and the location is very good. Any time I needed something from the hotel staff - they were prompt and so courteous. Loved it here.",5,2013,05,10
132,Quality hotel,"My wife and I stayed overnight recently, after an appointment in Harley Street, nearby. The foyer was large, open plan and easy to navigate.  The room was MORE than adequate, and very well appointed. It was ideally situated (unfortunately) for shopping in Oxford Street, and made a very convenient base for the w/e.  The only downside was the noise from the bar below! Loved the dreamy drapes, though, and the breakfast was quality, even though minimal. Overall, a worthwhile experience in the centre of London.",5,2013,05,10
132,Mixed feelings...,"I recently stayed here on May 4th along with a girlfriend for a luxury weekend in London. We chose The Sanderson as my friend really fancied it and I must admit I wanted to see what the rooms were like- considering how modern and strange the lobby itself is!
Firstly positives:
The girl who checked us in was lovely- friendly and chatty
Our room wasn't ready at noon which was fine but she had upgraded us to a deluxe double! We were super excited!
The room itself was lovely- a vast and I mean vast bed with superb quality bedding and amazingly soft and fluffy feather pillows- which I loved.
Great toiletries and the bathroom was amazing
The elevators are like stepping into the Universe- almost pitch black and surrounded by stars- it truly wowed us!
The breakfast - when we had it (see negatives!) was delicious. Great fruit selection including blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries, melon and pineapple! Yum!
Turn down service where they lit a candle was a nice touch.
Location wise this hotel is perfect for shopping and exploring Soho for great places to eat- try Bincho Yakitori in Old Compton Street- delicious!
Negatives:
Our deluxe double although large and sumptuous smelled strongly of smoke- and the white curtains that divide the room from the bathroom had probably absorbed from prior guests. I am amazed in this day and age that any hotel lets guests smoke in them and it wasn’t nice!
We were on the 6th floor and yet at night- with the booming music in the Long Bar I could hear it in my room- and had to go to sleep with a sound of bass in my ears- NOT relaxing and actually very intrusive. God knows what it would have been like on the lower floors.
The TV system was a let-down- non responsive remotes and overly complicated. Somehow didn’t fit into the modernist ethos and oddly placed to view from the bed.
The breakfast was a monumental mess! When we got down we gave our room number and said we were on a package that included breakfast. The Italian (?) Maitre de lady said she would check and promptly came back and said ""No you are not on a package. I have checked and you don't get breakfast."" My friend had popped back to the room so I then had to leave the breakfast table to walk to reception to have them check and double check and finally they said yes you do get breakfast included. What followed then was a farcical discussion about how it included an English breakfast but that we could not have the continental option which was cheaper. The Manager eventually deferred to the breakfast staff and said “Ask them.” 10 minutes later we were back at our table where our waiter (I didn’t get his name-I think he was from Africa) told us we could help ourselves from the buffet and choose a cooked item from the left hand side of the menu. He was so helpful and seriously overworked. The maitre de type clearly didn’t want to get her hands dirty and actually serve or help any guests- and he had to do everything. By the time we had finished the whole place seemed very chaotic. I felt sorry for our waiter who tended to us really well even when he must have been at breaking point. Suggestion for the hotel- don't have staff who stand around and do nothing except walk a guest to a table and expect 1 member of staff to do everything else. Extremely poor for a hotel of this caliber and at the prices they are charging. 
Had a drink at the Long Bar on the Saturday- drinks are very expensive and the surroundings are in no way luxurious. At £13.00 a cocktail approximately I don’t expect to see the menu listing nuts or a bowl of olives for around £4-5 a pop! Most other 4 or 5 star hotel bars will give a little accompaniment to a glass of wine or a cocktail and this seemed like penny pinching as did the cheap paper napkins that our barman placed our glasses on to and which stuck to them and lifted every time we sipped our drink. For the pleasure of having him pour two glasses of wine I had an automatic service charge added on- even though he was at the bar and hadn’t walked anywhere- this wasn’t table service. Cheeky and not appreciated.
The doormen when there are polite and open the door but on several occasions there was no one at the door and we had to let ourselves in and out. For a 5 star property that isn’t acceptable.
So overall- it was mixed. Elements I liked and others I didn’t. Would I return? No- there are far better hotels in London for the same price or less. The Sanderson is starting to look and feel a little shabby around the edges and the prices are simply not justified.",3,2013,05,10
132,Peculiar but fun with great staff,"A very unusual somewhat eclectic London hotel with comfortable accommodation, super staff and a fabulous bar. The prices are eye-watering in both bars but if you have to drink in London, they are only a little above the norm. Everything works well, the rooms are large enough, well furnished and pristine. Good attention to detail and all in all a splendid place to stay.
The full English breakfast however was an absolute disaster. Cold, badly cooked and simply awful. Heaven knows what foreign tourists must think when confronted with such rubbish.",4,2013,05,09
132,"Sanderson Hotel, Burners Street","My husband and I spent 3 nights here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we had a lovely stay. The whole hotel is very modern, clean, elegant and spacious and is in a perfect central London location. Our room was wonderful - we really couldn't fault it. Instead of solid walls the spaces are divided by opaque glass with added drapes for privacy - all adding to a lovely airy feel. As well as the cleaning in the morning, the staff came back in the evening to turn down your bed and light candles (a lovely touch). All the staff were friendly and helpful but we did have to wait a little while for table service in the bar and restaurant. We would definitely go back - a lovely hotel!",5,2013,05,08
132,Great birthday weekend,"Fabulous hotel. Very modern and glamourous.  Service is excellent, everyone very helpful and genuine.  We had a great time. Spa is so relaxing, this is highly recommended, especially the sports massage. 

Only challenge is there is no where to shine shoes! 

Can't wait to return again soon. ",5,2013,05,03
132,Cool funky hotel at excellent location,"The Sanderson is known as a very funky cool hotel and it got his fame some years ago. All london wanted to be at the sanderson. The check in was very kind. The receptionist was quick, helpfull, to the point! They know how to execute their job. I had diner on their terrace and the same service continued in their restaurant. Very kind, helpful staff. And good food.
The room itself is decorated by philippe starck, the famous french designer. Not my thing, but seen in the context, successful executed. All accomodations are available. 
Although they do charge for internet use. 
Also request a room at back as front of the building can be noisy. 
The same service continued when checking out. 
Will return, thats for sure.",4,2013,04,24
132,Excellent services but form exceeds function.,"Long weekend in a fantastic location with generally superb services, particularly in the Purple bar. Sunday morning breakfast service was a little hit and miss, but the food was good.

Rooms a little small and the design was challenging (for me): sink was nearly unusable, lights were at head height (painful) and it is possible to have too much white!",4,2013,04,17
132,Chick and sexy but neglected,"Was there last week during my visit to London.
Ugly facade but chick interior. Also very clever from the point of the investor, while except some design equipment and furniture (P.Starck), all the other materials are cheap. Maintenance is also more on the poor side as one can see that the management does not spend so much money on it.
Staff is nice, service is very good.
The best thing is the bar. It is one of the ""IT"" places in London. The bar is overcrowded from 17:00pm untill midnight. A lot of beautiful young ladies come to the bar to have a chit-chat and a nice time. During the night, there is a DJ as well. All in all, the atmosphere is great and it's the biggest value of this hotel.
Afternoon tea is BAD.
Although they present themselves and charge as a 5* hotel, definitely it is not. 4*max!!",4,2013,04,17
132,One of the best in London,"It was my wifes birthday and she was pleasently suprised when a bottle of wime and cakes arrived at our room. The staff were attentive but intusive and were very helpfull through ot our visit. Breakfast was one of the best we have had a full English lived up to it's billing, the fresh fruit also was great. Will be back again enjoyed the experiance.. Well done to all the staff.",5,2013,04,15
132,Stylish chic mixed with cosmic cool!,"There's tons of great things that stand out about this hotel and only the checking in process we'd rather forget.

A porter greeted us upon arrival to collect our luggage and the front door was opened up to us as we walked in. A lovely way to start the stay and a nice touch to any 5* hotel we feel. As you enter the reception, you're first struck by Salvador Dali's fabulous red lips sofa and the various pieces of African furniture darted around room. My favourite piece is the perspex bubble chair that hangs from the ceiling, which I just had to have a go in! The boutique is very quirky but nothing really worth buying in it to be honest. The Suka bar is very cool and the Purple bar is very seductive with a very low lit ambience and lots of velvet sofas and candles. Me and my boyfriend tried the famous Chocolate Martini and it was delicious! The cocktail menu is expensive but then everything generally is in this hotel, so I guess you should come prepared. Don't forget to have a game of pool on the giant purple snooker table too!

Amazing things include the Cosmic designed lift! Absolutely loved it. You feel like you're stepping into space when you first see it! So much fun added to what would normally be a boring lift journey up and down to your room. The breakfast menu and food quality is utterly first class and there is something here for everyone. You're spoilt for choice. The view you have over the courtyard is just lovely and I ate one of the best Egg Benedicts in London in my opinion!

The bedroom layout felt very different, which you come to expect from an edgy/designer hotel and the bed was in the middle of the room on an angle. Not great for those types who prefer box corners and straight lines!!  Lovely mood lighting available on a switch and a neat sound system to play with. Bathroom sink was also on an angle and was made of copper. No actual bath but a walk in shower. There is no set divide either with a door between the bathroom and bedroom but lots of wispy curtains covering the gap. We had a room which looked out onto office buildings at the back of the hotel but it was genuinely nice and quiet with no audible traffic noise, which is a miracle for being located in central London. The curtains/blinds are all operated on an electric switch and there's a cool set of designer dumb bells in the room, should the mood for a quick work out grab you!! We never had time to try out the Spa, so I couldn't even tell you what it looked like.

The only downside to the hotel when we stayed were the staff on reception. They were cocky and carefree in their attitude towards us and proved fairly useless in their overall know how. We had one foreign lady and one English male manager deal with us on the night we arrived, who both didn't seem that warm and friendly. We had a frustrating time trying to check in, as our online booking hadn't come through on their computer system and so we had to book our room all over again there and then, which turned out to be more expensive. We also ended up having the car valet parked for a hidden charge of £5, then paying a 24 hour car park charge of £40 a day, plus paying a congestion zone charge of course, so it's mega expensive if you've opted to drive into London.

It isn't the sort of hotel I'd recommend for an über relaxing and tranquil stay as it's far too bustling and fussy for detail for it to ever be a chilled out venue. It is however, perfect for trendy/partying types who fancy a central London nights stay in a cool, fashionable environment, with an affinity for swanky bars and designer furniture!",4,2013,04,10
132,Sanderson is London at best,"I have stayed at Sanderson at least 30 times in the last 3 years for both, business and pleasure with my family, and I have never been disappointed. Super-stylish, trendy, very friendly and care-taking people, a fantastic bar and restaurant, always a pleasure to come back and enjoy the lively atmosphere. This is London!",5,2013,04,09
132,Amazing hotel in great location,"I recently stayed at the Sanderson hotel for two nights and was very impressed. The room sizes are good for central London, and this together with the fab decor made for a really memorable stay. The decor in the public areas is also fantastic - I loved the lip sofa in reception. Staff were very helpful. Oh and if you like porridge I highly recommend giving it a try - best I've ever tasted! Although worth noting as it is made to order it will take a while to arrive!",5,2013,04,08
132,Fantastic Hotel,"We love Sanderson hotel, we stayed here for the third time. Love the location of the hotel, the room and the breakfast were fantastic. 
We can really recommend this hotel for people how wants to have a luxury stay when they are in London.:).

132,The definition of a design hotel.,"I stayed here for five nights. Judging by the bland exterior you could never guess what goes on inside. Awesomely decorated with nifty details. I personally loved my room but friends described theirs as ""like sleeping in a hospital"" to ""weird, just weird"". The hospital feel is somewhat right, although I liked the sleek, iPodesque feel to the room and the not-very-private bathroom. With better service (see comments below) I´d pull out the fifth star.

Great location with great shopping nearby.
Cool looks
Good bar
Great gym

-
Mostly very stale service with an Eastern Europe touch (not in a good way), both in the lobby and the restaurant
Service in the restaurant was slow, not very friendly and the food was nothing to write home about.
No pool.",4,2013,04,04
132,One of my favorites in London,"I love the Sanderson hotel, it is a very stylish and vibrant hotel.
The long bar is always fun for a cocktail and the service at the hotel is great.
Rooms are clean and a good size for European hotels.
Love the elevators when you go for a ride you will see what i mean :)",5,2013,04,03
132,Relaxed Chic.,"From the moment you walk in the Front Of House offered a warm welcome at this stunning Soho hotel. Reception fast, friendly (but not ""matey""). Rooms, (we had a standard one) are well appointed, fresh, spotlessly clean and have a great design.

Do try the restuarant and do eat breakfast here. Eggs Benedict sets you up for the day.

The downstairs bar is vibrant and has a mixed crowd and fills up early. Great cocktails.

This hotel though quite big feels small. It's trendy but not at all ""sniffy"" and has a great location.

Will stay again.

Thanks.",5,2013,04,03
132,A Hotel of the Highest Order!,"No other hotel can measure up to the Sanderson. Not only is this the coolest, hippest place to stay, but the staff is the most friendly and accommodating I have ever encountered. The Philippe Starck décor is uber hip. Every design detail is perfect and the hotel is immaculate. The management and staff truly care about their guests and go out of their way to make sure you have a phenomenal stay. The manager Jose, concierge Mike and front desk agent Marcela are outstanding. The Sanderson has my highest recommendation. My husband and I wouldn't stay anywhere else in London.",5,2013,03,31
132,london chic,"i first entered the lobby and was greeted by a pleasant lounge music and very chich trndy looby and a very nice front desk personel after getting all of my details they gave me a key and made my way to the elevator wich by the way are very cool....while you go to your fllor you have a space show and music inside the lifts.....very nice touch....then you go down dimed hallways wich makes it very sexy and loungy and thank goodness for the illuminated numbers on the floor or i would of never found my room!

The room was very nice big and spacious and super minimalist...big bed,a picture frame on the ceiling,a desk behind the bed and a armoire containing the tv and drawers and voila that was my room....the gorgous thing is the bathroom! huge bathtub very cool glass wall with curtain that are incased between the glass panels.....and a shower and everything needed but once again super clean sharp minimalist lines.....My only complaint was the music base that i could def hear from my room .....but as i am a night owl did not mind.....if your an early light sleeper ask for higher floors!

the 3 bars are very cool and happening and draw are very diverse crowd....:) love the overall atmosphere will def be going back.",4,2013,03,31
132,Tres trendy,"Double deluxe are fab massive rooms, v trendy. Love the space effect lifts. Bar lively, but pricey. Amaz bathroom with stunning bath, v quiet rooms which is always a bonus in London hotels. Great central location for everything.  Defo going back.",5,2013,03,29
132,"Amazing -- style, service and central London!","The Sanderson is a great property -- location, service, atmosphere, staff and style!  It is has a lot going for it.  Kept thinking during my stay -- why have I not stayed here before.

The lobby is really unique with the bar and lounge to one side, the iconic red lips sofa and just super interesting items/decor all around. The rooms are all white and I loved the open layout and spacious feel.  I know some people prefer having closets and more defined space in a room, however, I loved the fluidity of the space.  The bed was heavenly -- slept so well.  The bathroom is really spacious and the bath products are amazing (Malin and Goetz from New York, a brand that I love!).

I ate at Suka one night.  The food was excellent and the service great.  I loved walking into the Sanderson after a full day of work.  It is truly a luxurious haven in the heart of London.  The location is a real strength of this property.  Everything is so convenient -- just off Oxford Street with Soho and Covent Garden a short walk.  Great access to public transportation and getting around London.

Most importantly, the staff are such a joy at this hotel.  They really care.  Cam (concierge) was simply fantastic.  So willing to assist with anything.  

I will be back in London and the Sanderson will be my base.  Highly recommend it!",5,2013,03,25
132,hip hotel amazing location,"location is amazing just go down and you r on oxford
rooms big and comfy beds mattress nice on the soft side
staff helpful young and lively
the hotel feels like a club or an hip bar
overall liked it very much",4,2013,03,20
132,"Ridiculous rooms, nice for an art exhibition but not to stay","Let me start by saying that the people working at the hotel are very nice indeed. The Malay restaurant is also good with good service, and not too expensive.
The rooms however... I would go there to take a picture, have a laugh, and leave. They were designed by Philippe Stark. I love his design in bars and others, but this was utterly ridiculous. No closed cupboards to put your clothes in, and no place to leave your toiletries, not to mention a place to leave your suitcase. The night table beside the bed was so small I couldn’t place there my phone and a bottle of water.
When you travel for business things are supposed to be functional. Here nothing was. A pity, really.",2,2013,03,19
132,The Best weekend away,"We have just had the best weekend in this hotel, i would recommend it to anyone that wants amazing service with a smile . The room was amazing, the long bar and music on Sat night was fantastic, with cocktails that tasted sublime. My husbands Bday weekend and we returned to the room to find a chilled bottle of vino and cake, the entire staff make this hotel the best i have ever  stayed in. We will for sure return very soon.",5,2013,03,18
132,"Modern, Fun, and Convenient","Stayed recently at the Sanderson.  I've stayed here several times.  The rooms are failry large, with flowing white curtains, a modern bathroom, and nice amenities.  I had a fun night at the bar, as it was a great looking crowd with great music.  If you are looking for a tradditional London hotel, this is not.  If you want a fun, lively contemporary spot, with a great bar, restaurant and reasonablly priced, stay at the Sanderson.  I will definitely again.",4,2013,03,16
132,special in a good way,"As a huge london fan, i was allready happy to go to this amazing city.
Certainly because it was one of the first times i was able to go outside, with my disease i have,
and my boyfriend surprised me to go to london in a fancy hotel to treat me, saying ""don't let yourself down, treat yourself"" ..with this moto we went to london.
After talking before our trip with one of the managers, José, i was quite looking forward to this place.
He upgraded us to a bigger room, which i needed for having the most relaxing atmosphere with my disease. Unfortunetaly, our trip started very, very bad ! Our bus to london took instead of 4 hours , a 15 hours trip ! So we landed really tired, angry, hopeless in the sanderson hotel and where at the beginning a bit dissapointed. Not a bellboy helping with our luggage coming out from the cab, no one opening the doors...and the reception desk said nothing else then ""oh, what a shame"" and asking directly to pay everything. I felt a bit sad, but maybe we were so annoyed of our trip that started that bad we were a bit too ? Unlikely we were happy with the ztmosphere in this hotel. i am a huge fantasy fan and this hotels screams fantasy...that's what you think upon arriving in the rooms. For me, the rooms are quite big for the standards of london ! Lovely bed, lovely bathroom with a bath ( thank you josé, you made my day) !
sadly, the special ""curtain"" thing was totally broken, they are supposed to open and close to create different atmosphere in the room but ours was totally broken. On the top strips were falling down, we told the reception this problem but upon arriving in the evening it still didnt work. 
This hotel has a huge fantasy atmosphere, with one of the best locations you can imagine...sooo easy ! The second day we wanted to eat dinner in a fun place and the concierge, with Joey i think...a guy from belgium, was amazing ! Helping us as a pro in a way like he was ""a friend"" ...amazing ! The restaurant he told us was indeed a very good one!

WOULD i go back to this hotel ? Offcourse ! But the next time, i hope the reception is a bit more ""welcome"" feeling and ""helping"" feeling, especially when you see the guests are feeling bad.
Beside this : we had an amazing stay and recommend this hotel to everyone !

Ps : room service breakfast was on the small size, but really good !

Greets, 

Niek",4,2013,03,15
132,Very different!,If your looking for something out of the ordinary the Sanderson has it! Very modern and very dramatic. The foyer and reception is a bit like Alice in Wonderland from large lips settee to Perspex hanging chair to Louis the 16th settees. Stepping into the lift it was like getting into the tardis! Rooms are on very sparse line to fit in with the rest of hotel. Bed in the middle on room lots of white and stainless steel. Bathroom is behind lots of voile curtains that can be open or closed. Could be very sexy for a naughty weekend away. Beautiful hotel if you are looking to impress or wants something very different! Forget to add perfect for a shopping experience as you turn the corner and there is Oxford street! Lol,4,2013,03,15
132,Lovely Charming Staff,"I stayed here for my 30th Birthday and unfortunately had arrived feeling very unwell, the gentleman behind the desk picked up on this and automatically sent peppermint tea up to my room in the hope it would make me feel better. We then had a lovely bellboy who assisted with our bags and made sure we settled into the room, after checking i was ok or needed something several times. This continued throughout our stay and even upon checking out.

Honestly can say the staff at the Sanderson are without a doubt the best i have experienced in London without a doubt.",5,2013,03,15
132,Best Service In Chic Hotel,"I rarely write reviews unless I am extremely impressed with a hotel, and I most certainly am with the service at The Sanderson. I flew into town for London Fashion Week, landing to a crazy schedule that didn't allow me any time to plan and caused me to change plans frequently. The staff at The Sanderson handled all of my needs with such ease and kindness. They began doing the work for me days before I arrived, making excellent recommendations and securing reservations at London's hottest spots. I was most impressed with Cam at the Concierge, he was there whenever I called on him and always got the job done.  Tickets, dinners, you name it. I am SO impressed and just love the staff here.

The Afternoon Tea was fabulous, as is the bar scene at night. I was very comfortable in my room and enjoyed the spacious, modern bathrooms! A truly great and stylish stay.",5,2013,03,13
132,Lovely Hotel but let down by staff,"The hotel in terms of the look is amazing, however the staff let the hotel down.

Check-in and the first contact was pleasing and made you feel at home but this was short lived. We made our way down to the famous long bar for afternoon drinks and were met by staff that were both unwelcoming and at times rude. The experience was spoilt by the constant addition of service charges per order. This may be a small point but after a few drinks this soon adds up. 

In the evening we requested a taxi and were left waiting when the staff seemingly homed there magician skills of vanishing. 

Come the breakfast we were presented by a member of staff who just was never interested in the customer and instead just seemed to sulk in the corner. The menu or options were never explained and instead we were just offered a coffee. Without finishing my breakfast (folk still in hand!) the bill was slid on to table. 

Maybe classed as five star but the staff and lacking the charm you get from other five star london hotels.",3,2013,03,13
132,Simply great...,"My fiancee treated me to a great London weekend night on my birthday and asked me where I wanted to stay...  I said the Sanderson is my favorite London hotel.

The staff were just fantastic and made us feel incredibly welcome and appreciated.  The room was beautiful and difficult to leave, despite a great night out arranged by Cam the awesome concierge.

Food and drinks were of equally high standard and the cocktails at the Purple Bar were just as good as I remembered them to be.

I cannot thank Mr Piquer at the front desk enough for helping to make my birthday into a special memory and demonstrating such customer service savvy, hospitality and sheer 5* class.  I look forward to my next stay.",5,2013,03,12
132,Amazing place - The Nr. 1 in London!,"Before our 2 night stay we had a unfortunate experience with guest services, however the Director of Rooms of The Sanderson Hotel made it up in an amazing way like we never experienced somewhere else before. We had a extraordinary warm welcome at check-in and received an wonderful upgrade (marvelous loft with balcony). The design of the hotel, the staff and the location are absolutely amazing. Everything feels like a great experience; especially the funky and trendy interior of the general spaces and rooms is almost unprecedented in London.  The concierge service is also of a very high standard; they recommended us some very nice places and even arranged a table at a nice, and well suited for the occasion, club; they literally do everything to assure you have the best stay in London ever. In summary; we stopped thinking about staying somewhere else in London - The Sanderson is the place to be! This Hotel deserves a ""Travelers' Choise-Award"" for sure!",5,2013,03,11
132,Chic boutique hotel,"Stayed here in February and I loved the feel of the hotel once I stepped in. Decor was funky and modern, and the staff were friendly and prompt during check in. 
Rooms are of a good size, and had some touches of ""art"" in it which fits very well with the whole hotel.
Location was great as it was smack in the middle of Oxford Street with food places and shopping very nearby!",4,2013,03,07
132,Stylish and fun,"Had a great stay last night at the Sanderson. Excellent quiet location only minutes from Soho and Oxford Street. Our king room was funky with a great bed and nice decor touches. When I booked I was asked if we were visiting for a special occasion and I said it was my partner's birthday. When we checked in they wished him a happy birthday - a nice surprise for him and when we went up to our room after we'd been out for dinner they'd left a bottle of wine, a little cake and a birthday message. All this showed a great attitude and we generally thought the staff were excellent. The Long Bar is lively and fun. This place is not cheap by any means, but we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely go again.",4,2013,03,03
132,Funky splash out,"Where the beautiful people hang out, this hotel is a funky place where there is a party on every night.  Do not pick this hotel if you want somewhere quiet!  Having said that, the frontdesk provides earplugs on request and most of the time the rooms are quiet enough and away from the hustle and bustle of the bar.  The Long Room is the place to be seen and has excellent cocktails (but not cheap!) and is good for celebrity spotting.  The Purple Bar is for hotel guests only and has an astronomically priced bar menu.  Breakfast at Suka is tasty and varied.  Afternoon tea on the patio is also a treat.  The rooms and general decor is quirky but comfortable and clean.  Location is ideal: a 2 minute stroll to Oxford Street, with Oxford Circus and Bond Street stations both close by.",4,2013,02,27
132,Great stay only marred by ridiculous breakfast pricing!,"Stayed at the Sanderson before as we love this hotel.  Used my Tablet Plus privileges to get a free upgrade to a Superior room, free continental breakfast and free wifi - nice!

Made full use of the pool room and loved the free mini-cocktails they gave us in the resident's only Purple Bar.

Also enjoyed drinks in the Long Bar in the evening - was lively and buzzy due to London Fashion Week luvvies packing out the hotel.

Shout out to Jose I think it was on Reception who checked us in - very friendly and professional and ensured I got my upgrade without me even having to ask (and even when the hotel was near capacity!)

The only real downer was at breakfast the next morning.  Continental buffet is £18 per person and was included in my rate.  As I was nursing a major hangover, I wanted to switch my continental for a full Veggie Breakfast which is also £18.  Easy to do you would think? But oh no!  The waitress insisted I would have to pay another £18 on top so therefore £36 for my Full English!  so for £18 I expected a mountain of food - what do I get?  A portion that could just about feed a 10 year old!  A real shame that the service at breakfast spoiled an almost perfect night.  No doubt I will stay again but next time, will either stick to the free continental or go out to a local café for breakfast!  Sort it out guys - it's one thing paying the difference between one breakfast type and another but asking for a full price on top and then delivering a tiny portion (even if it was great quality) is pretty disappointing (and she had the nerve to charge service on top of that too!)",5,2013,02,23
132,"Over priced , over rated and get over yourself staff","Visited the long bar at the hotel yesterday....what a disappointment. The bar is very impressive, but no one there to seat you, so you have to fight for a seat. Having got seats at the bar, no body gave us a menu or was interested in taking our drinks order. There was a lot of chat behind the bar between the staff but they were not engaging with their clients.  After 15 minutes my daughter asked if we in the right place to order drinks. After a while our drinks came...two very mediocre cocktails, a lemonade and a warm beer, no £48.45 including 15% service charge. No nuts, olives or nothing! We either had to pay immediately on receiving our cocktails or open a tab! Lousy cocktails, lousy staff and a lot of attitude.",1,2013,02,17
132,Seriously Good Stylish Hotel,"We stayed at the Sanderson last month for a weekend trip in London and were delighted.

Location is great just North of Oxford St allowing easy access to great shopping & entertainment whilst escaping the direct bustle.

Although uninspiring outside once inside it is spectacular. Beautifully thought through design, service that really cares and great attention to detail. We didnt eat in the hotel but did partake of the cocktails...superbly made and in a great buzzy atmosphere. Many hotel bars are more like waiting rooms...in The Sanderson's Long Bar you feel you are in a club & far from our normal rural life.

Overall highly recommended & we shall be back soon.",5,2013,02,16
132,Relaxing night away,"Stayed for here as a pre-baby night away and we really enjoyed it. Had a lovely large deluxe room with stand alone bath - felt like a big area considering most central hotel rooms are on the small side. Room itself very stylish - clearly the minimalism isn't to everyone's taste but you know what this hotel's about when you book. Personally I loved it, my wife found it a bit dark and didn't love the net curtains with glow lighting but each to his own. Very different from your average hotel room, even in a hip hotel. 

TV system was very cool with good films etc, minibar was expensive but as it's Central London you're hardly a captive and we stocked up elsewhere. Silly that wifi's not free - for a modern-thinking hotel a charge of £10 or whatever really isn't on. 

The purple bar was very cool for a pre-dinner drink, really nice surroundings, great cocktails and friendly service. They made my heavily pregnant wife a special cocktail and ensured she got a seat. Lovely clubby atmosphere a nice contrast from the noisier Long Bar. 

Only minor gripes were that the room was quite noisy with pumping music late on the Saturday night but I guess that's to be expected given how popular the Long Bar is and didn't bother us too much. And I know this isn't Claridges but the laid back doorstaff seemed like they were helping at a school parent's evening rather than working at a 5 star hotel. Overall though a really relaxing stay in a nice area of London.",4,2013,02,11
132,Where they enjoy having you,"Location, Location, Location but the real kicker was the staff and I'd have to say they made it; genuine smiles, genuine people; so kudos to Management and staff for creating that vibe; not an easy accomplishment, especially in a big city.   Great to stay in rooms that are different;",5,2013,02,08
132,5* Service in a relaxed but different environment,"From the moment we arrived the staff were fantastic, from the helpful receptionists, to Greg in the Purple Bar where fantastic cocktails are made - even if you do not know what you want you just explain what you like and they will come up with something. The potato wedges on the bar snacks menu (part of a sharing platter) are Devine! Breakfast is fantastic with a superb choice and excellent service. All waiting staff explain what it is they are serving you. All the drinks are a bit pricey but are made from the finest ingredients. You don't just get ordinary Bacardi for example, you get 8 year old Bacardi!
The rooms are fine. Very white and uncluttered.
Hints: On a Saturday night either book a table in the Purple Bar or get their early. It is for residents only but can still get busy.
In your bathroom, you need to fill the beaker with water and put over the plughole to retain water in the sink - sounds weird I know but you will understand when you get there!

Negative points: £10.00 a day for wifi - come on Sanderson - you make plenty of money on the drinks to provide free wifi!

If you are in London or thinking of travelling to London, then this hotel MUST be on your short list- preferably at the top of your list!
We must go back to experience the afternoon tea that everybody talks about.
All drinks are a bit pricey but as mentioned above, are made from the finest brands and taste fantastic.",5,2013,02,07
132,Excellent Hotel,"This trendy boutique hotel is right in the heart and centre of London. You walk in and face straight away the Salvador Dali sofa of red lips! The staff are super friendly and helpful. The decor is beautiful and rooms tasteful, all 5 star quality. Excellent breakfast, even had soy cappucinno and plenty of fresh fruit. The spa is really worth a visit, all in white with high ceilings....great steam room and space to relax afterwards....healthy food options. All round a great stay.",5,2013,02,06
132,5 star hotel!,A lovely hotel in the heart of london. The staff was lovely and the the front desk area amazing!The room was lovely although not something special regarding the price. The bathroom yes it was  made by glass! The long bar at the ground floor was fantastic! great people!great cocktails!,5,2013,02,03
132,Leap Year Proposal !!,"In Feb 2012 I came here to propose to my boyfriend - Now fiance!
The staff were so friendly and helpful, helping me put candles in the room and laying out the rose petals on the bed for me.
I had told my partner that the 'Kings Of Leon' were staying at the hotel, the only downside to this hotel was that they weren't actually there!

Would recommend this hotel to anyone, its so stylish and sophisticated and the outside courtyard is beautiful !!
Many thanks to all the staff that made it possible for me.",5,2013,01,31
132,Great hotel - stay not long enough !,"Stayed at this hotel before an evening function at the Grosvenor. And had to leave first thing as a day of meetings lay ahead. Was gutted not to be there longer ! Very friendly welcome at reception, before going up in the amazing lift to my spacious room. Lots of lovely touches, the bed was really comfortable. Well worth a visit.",5,2013,01,26
132,stylish and different,"Love the quirky reception, bars, lifts, rooms, ambience, everything. Nothing to not like. Breakfast omelette was probably the best ive tasted. If you are bored of the same old hotel interiors and like stylish modern design this will be a refreshing change",4,2013,01,22
132,Lovely hotel. Fantastic Spa,"I had a lovely stay recently at the Sanderson. We had a business meeting there during the day and they very kindly checked our whole party in early (in some cases with an upgrade) so we could unpack. The rooms are modern but luxurious and the bed was lovely and cosy. We had Spa treatments in the afternoon and the staff there were lovely and the vibe is very chilled. On the whole the staff were great, the one exception being the chap on reception after midnight who was rather unpleasant when I asked for my room key. He asked for ID, which I didn't have, and almost created a stand off situation. He then sighed loudly and asked for my postcode, which I gave him, and handed the key over - what was the point! Overall a great hotel in a good location.",4,2013,01,20
132,trendy modern hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights in a quad room with 2 friends.  Room was fantastic,very clean and comfortable.  Had everything you needed in the room, from luxury toiletries, umbrella to use and even berrocca tablets for if your feeling a bit jaded the morning after!!!  hotel great, very luxourious, felt a real treat to be staying there. Both Bars were comfortable and the cocktails were delicious. Staff very helpfull.  Cannot fault the stay.",5,2013,01,16
132,A mix of clients,"Mixing late night party folk with a good night's sleep is not going to be easy on all occasions, and so it was with the Sanderson. It is a laid back hotel with staff who portray as relaxed an approach as is possible in an hotel. Service was quite good generally and quite relaxed.

The public bar is fun but would benefit from the lights working under the worktop to be tip top.

Bedrooms are well maintained.",4,2013,01,12
132,Superb Service from the Sanderson's General Manager,"My husband and I rate The Sanderson and The Clift as our two favourite hotels in the world, & have enjoyed our stays and visits to both hotels on many occasions. I would personally recommend both hotels to anyone! I recently had a ""chance encounter"" with Kevin Rockey, General Manager at The Sanderson, and without going into too much detail, I would like to say a massive THANK YOU to Kevin for restoring my faith in the value of excellent customer service. I am already looking forward to our next visit to this wonderful hotel!",5,2013,01,11
132,A Great place to Stay in London,"If fairness not the first time we've stayed here but for NYE 2012 we decided to take advantage of their New Years Package which included a room, a chilled bottle of champagne, entry to the private party, complimentry glass of champagne on arrival to the party and a late check out with breakfast/brunch served until 3pm!

On arrival we were met by the doorman who caleted parked our car and then were escorted to reception where we were we met by two stunning and very charming young laides who checked us in, welcomed us again (nice touch) and then told us we'd be given a free room upgrade.

The party, held in the Long Bar was well attended (but not so busy it was uncomfortable) and well organised. The staff, particularly the bar staff, were excellent and they seemed to be enjoying the evening as much as we were which only added to the experience (at one point the bar manager jumped up on the bar and started dancing much to the delight of the crowd). The hotel had Marina & The Diamonds doing a live set which was also well planned and executed (sound quality was superb).

The following morning (well it was more like midday after a 3am finish!) we went down for brunch and had the most delightful omlette before eventually checking out and heading hom.

A NYE to remember for all the right reasons",5,2013,01,05
132,My stay at the sanderson Nye 2013,"My check in was a bit messed up really which wasn't a good start at all the girl at front desk seemed a bit ditsy and with it being NYE the vibe was a bit too casual for my liking.
Though the hotel had a fantastic vibe once i had got to the bar and my room.
I would reccomend this hotel for any young couple, great cocktails, cool and friendly staff and such good hospitality (when there not too busy)

Great value for money we stayed in the loft suite and were given a discount as we booked on same date, though didnt like the fact that internet wasn't included.

Afternoon tea was very nice sweet and tasty, spa was the bomb so idyllic 
Much better than other hotels i have stayed in London.

Staff are friendly and good looking-which is a bonus :)",4,2013,01,04
132,Great hotel but might not suit everyone,"I really enjoyed my stay here and I must say that I did not really perceive any of the complaints from some of the other reviewers. The rooms were stylish and modern and typifies the style of the whole hotel. This is not a hotel for those that like to stay somewhere grand and traditional but more for those open to a fun, trendy hotel in a great location just off Oxford St. It is NOT cheap by any means, and nor is the restaurant and bar but to be expected in a place like this.

What I liked:
* trendy stylish rooms, love the minimalist but modern style
* purple bar with billiards table for guests only
* unlike others, I thought staff were friendly and helpful throughout. I thought the restaurant staff were particularly to be commended
* great restaurant - the malaysian food and portions are a good choice for lunch
* treadmill in my room which I didnt book!
* great location for shopping 

What I didnt like:
* ok, the prices are a bit high, including in the restaurant and room service but not anything more than many other hotels in London
* my room faced the courtyard which played music until late on most nights. Not an issue for me on this trip but could be if I were staying here on business
* I felt a bit let down by the Long Bar - it had been built up in my mind and I really didn't sense anything special there. It was a bit quiet (maybe due to the time of the year), and didn't really feel I was going into anywhere more than a slightly cooler hotel bar.",4,2013,01,04
132,Perfect,"I wouldn't change anything to this beautiful hotel...rooms are cosy and comfy, staff is friendly, bar is trendy....and just 2 minutes to Oxford Street!
My favorite hotel in town, I Definitely recommend it",5,2013,01,03
132,Agua spa...fabulous treat,"I can't tell you how special yesterday's spa was for my little sister and I. The therapists were fantastically experienced and made us feel very relaxed so I knew we were in for a real treat. I personally look forward to coming back for a regular treatment with Elena.
Thanks again and Happy New Year to you all at Agua

132,Sublime Hotel -  the stuff of dreams,"This hotel is the sort of hotel that you dream of. Every aspect is spot on. Each member of staff from cleaners to reception desk all have a very personable approach.You feel very valued as a guest. The lady at reception even offered us a glass of champagne as we were a bit stressed on arrival. Almost immediatly setting us up with the service personality that this hotel is renowned for.The room has great aspects of design elements, from net curtains to the lighting. A very exhilarating shower with interesting shower products like vitamin b6 and peppermint gels.The bed is the most confortable hotel bed I've slept in with a duvet that keeps you warm without being to heavy.The hotel lift is surreal and arriving at the Purple bar there is a vast array of cocktails and again the barmen are super interested in making the best cocktails for you in the alice in wonderland atmosphere.
So glad to have had a chance to stay here. And can't wait to go back again.
It excelled in all my expectations and made a great Christmas present for us.",5,2012,12,22
132,Amazing hotel,"This is by far my favourite hotel in London. The staff are exceptionally friendly and its great value for money. The Long Bar serves the best Apple Martinis - love it. The location is perfect, food excellent. I cant think of anything negative to say...",5,2012,12,21
132,My choice hotel in London,"Minimalist, stylish and comfortable rooms, fairly priced. The hotel is always happy and bustling with interesting and beautiful people. Incredible locations, short walking distance to great restaurants in SoHo. Restaurant is over-priced (like many things in London)",5,2012,12,19
132,Sleep in a Dream,"The rooms are amazing! It is just like sleeping in a dream! Both beautiful and fun.
The purple room staff are a little slow and clueless but the drinks very are good.
The front desk is very helpful and efficient. The  breakfast is very good and offers both cold and hot options.
The hotel is also exactly were you want to be, a quiet street close by it all.",4,2012,12,16
132,I Just Love This Place,"I have stayed at the Sanderson probably seven or eight times in the last two years and I have to say I love it.

With that being said, I do now always book a Loft with balcony room as they are lovely and I think, worth the extra money. Also I am a smoker and my partner is not so there is a little pressure there.

Being able to have a drink on your own balcony is lovely and having breakfast outside on a Summers morning is just delightful.

This possibly sounds a bit too good to be true and I do have one small gripe, which is, soft close toilet seats please. There is noting worse than going to the loo in the middle of the night and after one has finished bang goes the lid, waking the other half! She's not at her best being woken by a banging loo seat.

And onto the bar, gets very busy with non residents on the weekends but has a really nice buzz, if you like that sort of thing, which I do.

So all in all a great experience.",5,2012,12,11
132,A nice stylish stay,"I spent a few days at The Sanderson in November and had only previously had a drink in the Long Bar on occasion. The staff are all helpful and professional and I found the Malaysian food in the restaurant very good.

Like most London hotels it is expensive but the ambiance is good and the rooms are very feng shui with offset beds and furniture.

Overall a good venue and recommended if only for a drink at the bar.",4,2012,12,11
132,Fab-tastic!,Didn't stay in the hotel. Went to the Long Bar with a friend for cocktails. We drank More Summers which were as delicious as the barman who served us. The evening was an amazing experience of tastes & culture. I will be back.,5,2012,12,05
132,The Sanderson London,"Was on a weekend trip to London, choose the Sanderson was surprised when i walked through the door a warm welcome greeted me, check in was fast.

My room was a deluxe which was good overall had amenities etc. met some grate staff chaz was helpful in room service as im fussy with my food he sorted it. A lovely girl at front desk helped me out i think her name was kiayli. 

The dj was grate and lots of fun at my stay thanks to everyone, a place to go to especially the Longbar even if your not a guest ",5,2012,12,03
132,a night to remember!,"amazing location... amazing room... treat yourself! Had heard about this hotel many times... and decided to visit ... yes it's a bit OTT, but the room was amazing... all white and modern... the glass-walled bathroom was spotless!! The receptionist was a bit full of herself... but is added to the whole experience... in a funny kind of way.. the bar was packed (but I didn't use it as I do not drink alcohol)",5,2012,12,01
132,Great trendy hotel,"Nice hotel, beautiful design, great location.
Service is great, everybody is very attentive and nice.
My room was very comfortable, beautiful clean design. The shower is a little narrow but the whole design is very nice.
Amenities are great.
The restaurant downstairs is very good, and the bar is not bad at all.
Great choice if you like trendy cool hotels, as those sometimes forget about good service.
I loved the hotel and my room, despite of being at the worst possible location (next to the service rooms, which were a few and quite noisy).",4,2012,11,29
132,Great Spot -- Impeccable Service (Thanks Kaylee!),"The hotel, chic and personable, is a must stay for first timers or frequent travelers. The rooms, as unique and comfy as they come, are only shadowed by the phenomenal customer service. Kaylee and Lucas, in particular, were beyond helpful - from great recommendations to seamless assistance with rooms, they presented a sense of comfort that all top hotels should emulate. The location is tough to beat - just off Oxford Street in a trendy part of Soho, yet not in the midst of all the razzle-dazzle where you will be woken up at night. The long white bar is a fun spot - good drinks and a better scene - but the hotel manages to maintain a boutique feel that the Morgan Hotel Group always seems to maintain. This, again, has more to do with the it's service than anything else... Thanks Kaylee!",5,2012,11,28
132,Amazing cocktails!!,"My husband and I had our first weekend away without children, we chose the Sanderson on a recommendation from a friend and it was like no hotel I have ever stayed in before. We were slightly disappointed with the room as it was very basic, and then we had problems with the TV, the shower over the bath and the phone in the room. The first night we went to the Long Bar for cocktails before going to the opera and after a 15 minute wait to be  served decided to leave , however on our second night the bar had more staff and we were served quickly, the staff were really attentive and the cocktails were amazing, it is definitely worth going just to try them. The manager came round asking if everything was ok with our stay and my husband mentioned an issue we had had with housekeeping earlier in the day and he made sure our account was credited with a round of drinks which was unexpected but very nice.
The location was fabulous just a 2 minute walk to Oxford Street, for this (and the cocktails) it would probably be somewhere we would return to.",4,2012,11,25
132,Über cool hotel and great staff,"Had a fabulous stay at the Sanderson where I went with my girlfriend and left with a fiancé. This hotel is seriously cool but, aside from all the design that really sets it aside from some of the stuffy old fashioned hotels in town, the service we received was excellent right from booking to checkout. In advance of our stay, the concierge service was particularly exceptional, absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they really helped me make the day that extra bit special - thank you Alex, Cam and Marala!",5,2012,11,25
132,When you have a little more to spend,"If you are looking for an experience at a hotel in London rather than just a 5 star venue, then I can strongly recommend the Sanderson. 

I stayed here for a couple of nights. The location is central, close to shops and resturants as well as an good distance from both London City Airport (45 mins by taxi) and London Heathrow (best done by taxi-Heathrow Express combination). 

Decor-wise the Sanderson is famous. Its minimal-meets-surealist design makes  the experience memorable. The common areas are all well laid out. Staying at the hotel will also secure you access to a very popular bar. 

Rooms can be small so I recommend going for a deluxe room as this will give you a bit more space. The rooms are probably more challenging to stay in for a first-time romantic getaway as the bathroom and bedroom are separated by elegant curtains rather than walls but as long as you know this in advance - it ads a child-like experience to working out how to get the most out of the design. 

I recommend the Sanderson to couples and business people a like. This is not a kid-friendly hotel in my opinion.",4,2012,11,25
132,Sanderson's staff saved us,"I would like to share an incredible experience my husband and I had the day before Thanksgiving travelling from Sanderson's Hotel to Heathrow to fly home to Colorado. We picked up a cab in front of the hotel and realized when we arrived at Paddington railway station that we had left a crucial briefcase with travel documents, computer, etc. in the cab. Having failed to get anyone  on the phone via the generic London cab numbers supplied by other cabbies, we called Sanderson's on the off chance they could help. The staff were incredibly helpful and checked with about four people before putting us through to the doorman, who had just spoken to the cabbie, had his mobile phone number, and eventually reunited us with our briefcase. We were not even staying at the hotel, but will now be loyal customers and fans. We have had many reasons for Thanksgiving the following day, and the staff of Sandersons is top of the list.",5,2012,11,24
132,"Great Bar, great people watching.","The long bar in The Sanderson is one of the best bars I have been to in London, especially for people watching. It's very amusing! But the bar itself is great, as are the cocktails. This hotel is so quirky, I love it, and I  stayed here a few years ago too, and would recommend it for a weekend in London. Great for it's location too. We ate just around the corner at The Salt Yard, and then trekked along to the hotel to have some fab cocktails. The music is good on a Saturday night too, so a great meeting place with friends.
We snuck into the resident's bar when my feet started to hurt and thankfully they let us stay. In this little cocktail bar they make bespoke cocktails - you just tell them the kind of flavours you like and they'll whip you up your own concoction. It's pricey, but a great way to end the evening. The room is very dark and decadent, and simply fabulous. The furniture is all quirky and miniature, with comfy sofas all around the edge of the room. Think Gothic Alice in Wonderland. 
It's a must for a decadent end to an evening out in Londond.",4,2012,11,19
132,brilliant hotel,"i have never done anything like this so it was a first and probably the last as it was all paid for. when we arrived the doorman took our cases to reception, staff very helpful as it was early we were just going to leave our cases and go shopping but room ready so dumped cases and went shopping just off oxford st so ideal. later in the day we had a spa treatment , i had back neck and shoulder massage my sister has a facial, absolute bliss. in the evening we had a restaruant booked and didnt have clue where it was so reception googled map for us then called us a taxi as to far to walk. called room service a couple of times very good.  full english breakfast sunday morning yum yum. A little noisy at night as our room faced out on to the road and people coming in late had no thought when walking down the corridor. room lovely could not fault, mini bar was pricey but you dont have to use it. A totally briliant weekend.",5,2012,11,18
132,"Nice To Look At, But Looks Ain't Everything","The lobby is 5 star chic. So is the elevator. The rooms too.
But the functionality is about one star

The rooms (and I've stayed in 3 different ones) suffer from Boutique Hotel Syndrome: no thought was given to anything a traveler might actually need or want.

OUTLETS: Hidden in the corners of the room, not particularly accessible from the bed or desk, hard to find. (PLUS - they do provide a complimentary adapter. MINUS - it's buried in the mini-bar in between the condoms and the cashews, not on the desk where one might actually look for it)

NOISE: The rooms are noisy. There is a very active bar scene and it spills out to the front of the hotel and to the interior atrium every night until around 2AM. There are a few rooms that overlook the back, but if you want a quiet night's sleep, this isn't the place.

SERVICE: If you ask the staff to do something (fetch a taxi, help with bags, etc.) they are quite gracious and accommodating. But you have to ask and that's what separates a great hotel from a good one. The hotel has a large number of non-guests coming in and out at all hours to use the bar, the spa and the gym, and I suspect that is why it's tough for them to figure out who is a guest and who just wandered in to check out the lobby. That's an explanation not an excuse - I'd rather have the doorman ask me if I need a taxi every time I leave the hotel versus walking outside, noting an absence of cabs in front of the hotel and having to turn around and ask the doorman if he could please find one for me. They are extremely helpful once you ask, but anticipating needs is what the service business is all about.

GYM: Excellent. One of the best hotel gyms I've seen, especially in Europe. BUT... they seem to cater to non-guests who have gym memberships (and their personal trainers) which has the effect of making the actual hotel guests feel like intruders.

BAR: Lively, but feels touristy rather than chic and local. Really loud too.

ROOM SERVICE: Excellent food, excellent service... to a point. No attempts ever made to collect the dishes when you're done

BREAKFAST: The buffet breakfast is very ample, very tasty and the servers are very good too. Breakfast is often included in the room rate as part of their package deals

INTERNET: They charge for WiFi, though you don't have to log in daily and the speed is pretty good for a hotel - I was getting about 5 up and 5 down, which is about 1/10 of what I get at home, but faster than connecting via my phone

LOCATION: Excellent location in Fitzrovia, near SoHo and Oxford Circus, you can pretty much walk anywhere in the West End in about a half hour-- cross Oxford Street and continue on Wardour and there are a many excellent restaurant options

BATHROOM: More Starck madness: there's just a curtain and glass separating the bathroom from the bedroom, so if you wake up in the middle of the night and you're sharing a room, be prepared to wake up your partner. The shower has no lip on it to stop the water from coming out, so you need to put a towel in front of it or wind up with a wet floor. The soap dish in the shower is tiny and only holds two bottles: if you're using shampoo, conditioner and body wash, you're out of luck. Excellent products though each item - shampoo, body wash, conditioner, lotion - is a different (strong) scent, and that kind of defeats the purpose.

BEDS: Very comfortable - linens are soft and not overly heavy or light - just right. Lots of pillows too.",3,2012,11,15
132,Fantastic Hotel,"This hotel is a cut well above the rest. In a fantastic location just off the madness of Oxford Street and beside many superb places to eat and drink. The main bar is excellent serving some of the best cocktails I have been fortunate to sample. Bar staff could be a little more attentive, most of them seemed to be employed for their looks rather than their work ethic. But the the quality of their product were fantastic and made up for any shot comings.
Rooms are very cool, although it took a little time to get used to.
I really enjoyed this hotel and I shall be back in the near future.",5,2012,11,13
132,It is all about the location,"My husband and I stayed at The Sanderson from 10th to the 12th Nov. We booked here as friends we were meeting had stayed previously and recommended. The hotel is very stylish if a little random in places! If you want to stay somewhere stylish, different and close to Oxford St and West End this is the hotel for you. 
However if you want somewhere with good soundproofing, stylish yet practical and attentive service from waiting staff this may not be the hotel for you?
As stated in the title the big plus for this hotel is its location, only 15 mins in cab from Euston and a few minutes stroll onto Oxford Street. We had a great weekend but I probably would not return to this hotel.",3,2012,11,12
132,business brothel,"it is hard to feel completely comfortable in a hotel that has a bar used by prostitutes and businessmen. Every Tuesday and Wednesday they also hire out the courtyard for functions that can go well into the night with loud music till the last customer leaves...which could be 5am.
the turn-down service was slack. our room was only turned-down 2 times in two-weeks.
they have scraped the extensive dvd library and instead have a tiny selection (15 films) chosen through the tv.",3,2012,11,10
132,Fantastic Hotel,"We arrived early in the moring and our rooms were ready within 30 minutes for check in. Hotel staff was super friendly, from the front desk to the restaurant manager they could not do enough for us to make us welcome. Super trendy bar at night. Hotel lobby & rooms are very modern and our room we stayed in was fantastic, we stayed in a deluxe room on the 2nd floor. Breakfast was really delicous and service outstanding. Could not have been more pleased. The location of the hotel is in walking distance to a lot of great places, British Museum, lots of great shopping, trendy restaurants all around. Definelty recommend this hotel to the sophisticated traveler.",5,2012,11,02
132,A Classic Modernist Experience,"We've not been to London for many years, but we won't wait so long to return. Our stay at the Sanderson was impeccable from beginning to end. How is it possible for their staff to remember our names (at any time of the day) is just a small indication of the level of service the Sanderson offers. We felt as welcome as if we were regulars. The hotel is a Stark redesign of the wonderful Sanderson Head Showroom, located in the worldly Soho district, that is still a fantastic mid century modern building. To say that a Stark inspired interior still resonates in todays ever evolving design aesthetic is wonderful. The room was spacious, clean and well appointed. We enjoyed room service twice, both times incredible (the Beef Bourguignon is incredible and worth skipping a night on the town). If shopping, dining or West End theatre are on your itinerary, I strongly recommend staying here. Singing in the Rain was fantastic entertainment as were the restaurants on Charlotte street for wonderful dining. Selfridges is a luxury shopping dream come true. Back at the Sanderson, after being greeted home by the ever attentive doorman, one could relax, have a smart cocktail at the bar with the local London urbanites or shop at Luna And Curious in the lobby. The Sanderson became our refuge after taking in the endless sites of London over a late August long weekend.",5,2012,11,01
132,The front of house staff need to be trained properly,"It is unfortunate that i have to write a review for the Sanderson which scores so badly but unfortuately the staff on reception and the arrangement of the concierge is such that i do not believe they should be a 5 star.

Let's start with the good stuff:

Breakfasts - these were excellent with good service,  although some people may find the staff a bit over friendly, they have clearly been taught to rehearse the same lines to everyone to make them feel valued. In some hotels this works, in the Sanderson it seemed a bit contrived, but that could have been because we had such a bad stay there.

The Manager - if you have a problem and the staff are not responding then make sure you contact him. He is the only one with any authority and we ended up feeling sorry for him because the people working for him at the front desk and in housekeeping were clearly very badly trained. Either that, or he was not managing them well....

The less good stuff:

The rooms have HORRENDOUS soundproofing.

The housekeeping staff have a manager who comes to check on the rooms once they have been serviced, but be aware that he does not knock and may barge in at any time. When we rang the front desk to complain, the girl did not seem at all bothered and we have no doubt the message was not passed on.

The front of house. There is no concierge on the door to help you carry bags from your taxi or assist you in any way. After check in you are offered the service of a bell man, but by this point you have done the hard bit!

The reception desk staff. We didn't meet one person on the front desk who was properly trained, or who understood our requests or complaints. It took several phone calls to establish that we wanted an extra reading lamp in the room, the receptionist thought we needed an engineer despite the fact we never reported a fault, we just asked for an extra light!

On check in we were combining two independent bookings which our agent had attempted to do prior to our arrival but with no luck [probably due to the staff on the front desk being so uncapable]. We successfully arranged it so we could stay in the same room and provided the usual credit card details for the extras. The following day we were then hounded all afternoon by the girl who had checked us in to go and pay for the previous night and the extras incurred. She hadn't combined the two bookings at all and expected us to ""pay as we went"" in order to make her life easier. Eventually the manager looked after the situation but the receptionist was so incompetent and rude when we were trying to explain the situation.

Later on in the day, we again had to call on the reception staff for assistance and even after 3 calls and 45 minutes our request was not met.

Soundproofing is horrendous. There are other reviews that suggest not being above the bar and we would echo this. You can hear it all day and night and everything that goes on in the corridors as well.

All in all the place needs to retrain their staff or get better skilled personnel for the front desk. This is the part of the hotel that leaves the biggest impression on a guest and for us we would have received better service in a budget hotel.",2,2012,10,31
132,"If you have the means to stay in this luxurious hotel, you won't regret choosing Sanderson.","We needed a place to stay while being stuck in London due to hurricane Sandy. The Sanderson's staff couldn't have been more accommodating. From laundry service, to arranging meeting space, to the fabulous bar tender, we couldn't have been more pleased. The rooms are gorgeous. Breakfast was delicious. And the decor is funky and modern, while still being quite comfortable. We loved it!",5,2012,10,30
132,Too clinical,"Stayed with a group of girls for a ""classy"" hen night. Booked in with confusion over credit card guarantee etc... Requested an early book in but didn't get one. In fact, left luggage and took a walk into town to return to still no rooms ready.... 
No concierge at door when we arrived, heavy front doors.... Random furniture with plain front desk... Lifts amazing! Blinged up and beautiful! 
Afternoon tea ok, I've had better ill be honest. Breakfast amazing! Best ever...
Rooms sparce.. With no privacy for groups sharing :(( double superior room had two beds that weren't double but three-quarter which disappointed.... No kettle in room either and the view was awful of fire escapes and the back of a building.....
Girls congregated in one room to surprise hen in question and at only 6.30 received complaints from adjoining room... Was asked to leave room and go downstairs by manager, not impressed....... We had originally requested adjoining rooms by were located on different floors! 
I won't be returning and certainly not st those prices!",4,2012,10,28
132,"Very Nice, Hip, Great Location","Got to stay here several nights on a work visit to London.  Being part of the Morgan's Hotel Group, and sister to St. Martin's Lane Hotel, I assumed this would be a great hotel which it was.

Location is great.  Assuming you stay in a particular part of London either for work or to tour, this part of town is nice.  It's a more affluent crowd with a lot of cool old pubs around, plenty of places to eat, and quick 5-10 minute walk to several tube stations, safe.

Hotel is expected Morgan's hip/chic.  Gigantic lip sofa when you walk in, modern look, really cool elevator that had a quasi-3D illuminated star constellation on the ceiling.  For London the room size was pretty good, nice bed and amenities, nice shower, very clean, view of the street and adjacent office building.  Service was also good for what I encountered but didn't talk to the front desk much or use any facilities.  The bar on the ground floor is particularly cool with an interesting varying scene.  Drinks are not cheap, but good, so its cool to stop in after dinner, have a drink, and clock out.

My only complaint might be the room rates out of a corporate arrangement, but you're paying for the location and that it's a Morgan's hotel.  For a work visit it was excellent.",5,2012,10,27
132,It is juat a mess!,"I make a disicion to book my VIP guests at this hotel because I like the design.
I booked 1 deluxe King and 2 Twins on 19-20 Oct and 24-16th Oct.
But when I start making my booking I come across I can only fill in one guest name on the booking form for Twin room! And I need to fill in 2 names because of the VISA application.
Finally I have to call thier customer service and it put me through Canada, The people who work there are hardly understand what I need and most of the time I feel like I was talking to the robot!
Eventually I manage to speak to the london hotel booking team and get all my guests names in a writen confirmation manually.The london team has make so much mistake of the spelling and it took me numerous time to get it right!
By the time we check in, they make a mistake by given my guests 2 deluxe and 1 twin.- I only found out when the guests check out!
We were away for few days and check in again and this time they make the same mistake!!!!!
It was around 7pm and all the twins rooms were taken and Nigel offer 2 double room instead but he didn't mention this is a joining room! My guests have to stay with thier children so we didn't take it. Furture more, we were ask for a late check out on 26th Oct and non of the check in staffs know about this!!!
They have no conmunacations between management and staffs!
The feed back from my guests is they serve the worse coffee in town!!!!! and I wonder the manager have tasted thier own coffee!!!!!
Unfortunatelly, I have book in for my next VIP group in DEC so I am praying they get it right this time. Aman!",2,2012,10,27
132,Special place and attentive staff,"My friend and I spent a couple of nights here booked via Voyage Prive. Although we were assured that there would be no problems getting a twin room by Voyage Prive, when we arrived we had been booked into a double. The reception staff were very apologetic but had no twin available our first night; they could not have been more helpful and organised an upgrade for the following night.
Rooms are spacious,clean and we found all the staff charming and attentive. Afternoon tea was really special and just ask if you want to have time to drink your champagne first before tea is brought.
Breakfast is substantial and all cooked fresh to order so be prepared to wait a short time; it was a big plus for us that it is served until 11.30am at the weekend.",5,2012,10,21
132,5 Reasons why this isn't a 5 star hotel,"1.  IT'S LIKE STAYING AT A NIGHTCLUB
I Like nightclubs, but I don't expect to feel like I am in a nightclub when I am in my room.  It was unbearably loud.  The rooms aren't soundproofed.  I did get relocated further away from the bar after I raised the issue but was relocated adjacent to the fire stairs which was used regularly and loudly.  On weekend nights I was regularly questioned at the door by the security to validate that I was a guest.

2. FOOD
I tried the breakfast for the first three days.  Cold toast.  Hotel style coffee.  Gave up and went to an an amazing Italian bakery PRINCI just 5 minutes walk from the hotel - it is brilliant.  Best coffee in London.  I tried the room service three times each time it was too cold to eat.

3.  ROOM QUALITY
There is no getting around Philippe Starck is a genius.  The Sanderson is like walking into the 90's.  It is one of the key reasons why I wanted to stay here.  While the bed is great the rest of the furniture is very poor quality and seems like it is direct from 90's IKEA.  Drawers get stuck.  The cupboard's unstable.  The blind broke when I tried to use it.

4. SERVICE
I don't think I was cool enough to get great service.  I have stayed at a lot of 5 star hotels and the best ones make everyone feel welcome and treat every guest equally.  I also wasn't told the hotel had a car service until I was leaving - something I would have loved to have used.

5. VALUE
When you stay at a great hotel in an amazing city you always feel like you are spending well no matter what the cost.  At the Sanderson I felt I was staying in what might have once been a great hotel.  The is the first review I have been motivated to write because the quality of the experience was so poor.  I know there are great hotels in London unfortunately this isn't one of them.

132,So far not impressed,"Arrived by taxi from airport, 
No concierge . Taxi driver looked for assistance to no avail. driver carried bags ou stairs and into hotel. Staff seemed unconcerned. Laughed no one around. A helpful young  man, not in his usual duty, finally performed check in. Seemed very disorganized, no protocol. Poor reception. Room very small. Claimed an upgrade would have been available but hy were sold out. Very limited place to put clothes, bags, etc for a longer stay. One plug far off from anywhere to plug computer in. No plug available by desk to plug devices in.
Will review at the end of stay. For the caliber of hotel, not up to standard. Great location for shops and cafes and restaurants.",3,2012,10,19

The best part was the breakfast, the best breakfast I've ever had! ",5,2012,10,12
132,Seriously good location!,"Loved the hotel! Good service, good rooms, seriously good and fresh breakfast (although it was a shame the fruit was covered in fruitflies the second day). Loved the spa which you can use to freshen up after your journey if your room isn't ready yet.
Found the evening doorman a little cocky, as though he didn't find everyone worth staying in his hotel, but whatever...
Rooms are beautiful, not your typical hotel room which makes it feel as though you're really staying somewhere special instead of just another hotel room. I did found the glass toilet door a little bit of an invasion on my privacy :)

132,Best spa,"Have been to the Sanderson spa several times - it never disappoints.

A lovely relaxed atmosphere

Fantastic therapists - all treatments are great quality.

Lovely changing rooms with great toiletries.

Really nice staff and excellent service.

Fantastic healthy food

A real oasis in central London.

Well worth the money - a great day guaranteed.",5,2012,10,08
132,A youthful hotel with the coolest interior and excellent service,"When I arrived at this hotel one late Friday night I thought I stepped into a discotheque. The music and noise from “The long bar”, just at the right of entrance, was impossible to miss. It gave a youthful and energetic impression, if a little surprising. Checking in was very welcoming and I was not disturbed by sound when in my room.
The lifts at Sanderson are worth a visit of its own.  For a few seconds you feel like you are travelling through galaxies. Every elevator should be like this! 
My room was so beautiful. White and delicate, it was a soothing experience just to enter. One wall was made of glass but with a curtain in of white, transparent fabric. When being in my room I felt almost like living in air.  
The room is done once a day. Two bottles of water are complimentary and there are the usual trimmings of shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and shower gel. 
Breakfast was well made with buffet and menu.
Service at Sanderson was very pleasant throughout my stay.",5,2012,10,05
132,2 day stay in the heart of Soho,"Chic interior, happening bar, impressive courtyard and brilliant location. I have stayed here 3 times already and would recommend it to all. Hotel is pricey for a boutique set-up but totally worth it in my view.
I stayed at a loft which had a large balcony, great for a gt provided the weather allows it.",4,2012,10,05
132,Trendy hotel - not for the conservative traditionalists,"The Sanderson looks like an office block in a prime location just off Oxford Street (I must have walked past it numerous times without realising it was a hotel). Once you step into the lobby, you realise that it is not a conventional hotel but a very arty hotel. A cosmic lift takes you to the darkened hallways so favoured by the latest wave of boutique hotels. The room was all white with the bed arranged in the middle and with a glass separated bathroom. The addition of privacy blinds makes this arrangement perfectly useable. A prime location and well designed alternative room make the Sanderson a luxurious treat for a stay in central London.",4,2012,10,04
132,"Great staff, great rooms",We stayed at the Sanderson and found the staff just wonderful.  The restaurants at the hotel were very good as well. We traveled with a 4 year old and everyone was very accommodating to his needs.  We were there on business and got rooms for our clients who couldn't say enough great things about the hotel.  We had a business lunch at the onsite restaurant and that was very fab as well. I highly recommend the Sanderson for business or pleasure.,5,2012,09,24
132,Good and bad,"As others have stated this is a contemporary hotel with bright, white rooms and lovely shower and bed (always important to be comfy) . Also a great central location. However, a couple of negatives- soundproofing is very poor and people seemed to come and go all night - we could hear actual conversations from the hall outside our room. Not good. Bar noise was loud too as we seemed to be right above it. Also we were woken to the unmistakable smell of cigarette smoke permeating from another room. On mentioning this at checkout the staff were apologetic and did offer us breakfast or an upgrade on next visit (not sure there will be one though cause of broken night)",3,2012,09,23
132,The most incredible facial at the Agua Spa,"I had a facial today with the incredible Eve Lom based on how amazing the product range she developed is.  

After having this treatment I now realise that I've never factually had a proper facial.  She is not only extremely thorough but she is also exceptionally easy to speak to, gave great advice and I left feeling properly looked after. 

I booked another appointment straight away even though I really can't afford it and I somehow suspect that these treatments are actually worth it.",5,2012,09,21
132,"great hotel, and good value","I love the Sanderson hotel. The trendy lifts and reception may put some people off, but the quality of the rooms are fantastic. They are light, and white, with fantastic showers and big baths. Toiletries are great too. Concierge service is great, and the Long Bar has yummy cocktails. The only negative thing is the turn down service is a bit sporadic. But if they don't come, phone and in 5 minutes the staff are there. There was a fire alarm in the middle of the night, and the staff were a bit disorganized, but by the time I woke up there was a letter to apologize. The food is great also. The reception was so helpful and printed a big document for me when I had to work the weekend, and didn't charge (100 pages)",5,2012,09,21
132,A-ma-zing,"At this amazing hotel for the weekend and we absolutely loved it!  To be greeted by a pair of massive red lips as you walk through the door to eyes on the back of all the chairs, from the quirky rooms where there are no parallel lines to the fabulous lifts and fabulous staff.  Just one drawback - the awful disco type thump, thump of the bar/restaurant music which drove us over the road to an awesome Italian restaurant and a period of peace and quiet. It's an adults' hotel with a childlike theme and we were transported into a world of make believe for that brief visit!  We will certainly return!",4,2012,09,16
132,Overall a positive experience,"Big downside - the exterior appearance of the hotel. As you arrive it looks like an old office block.  No grand lobby or entrance like you expect 5 star hotels to have. 
However, inside it's lovely.  Very different, modern decor and spacious. It is an oasis when you're consider you're steps away from the bustle of Oxford Street. 
The rooms are very comfortable, all white everything and again quirky touches with the decor. 
All the staff were very friendly and helpful.",4,2012,09,15
132,"I liked it, but ...","I guess it all really depends on what you like in a hotel. I love the Sanderson to come to the bar; I like its courtyard and the Long Bar. So I decided to stay one night for an occasion, and was looking forward to it. For me, the rooms are a bit 'Emperor's New Clothes'. Yes, the decor is quirky - our room was white, white, white (fine), with a bed taking up the whole room and that's really about it. The Starck fittings are nice - and no doubt expensive - but the rest of it looks really cheap, if that makes sense - cheap MDF cupboards, really cheap plastic venetian blinds, cheap plastic hangers and drawers in the bathroom. This is not an experience which cries 'luxury', it's an experience which cries 'cool stripped down non-luxury'. Call me old fashioned; and I love a design hotel (Boundary in Shoreditch does this beautifully for example, and I love the Zetter in Clerkenwell) but this is too much of 'it's Philippe Starck, that should really be enough to justify the huge expense of your room'.
Well, it wasn't enough for me. I'll pay my money for a bit more luxury, please. The Firmdale Hotel group in London for example, or the ones I have mentioned above. Those do it very well. Having said all that, the staff were very nice always, the common areas as I say are cool, but this hotel just doesn't work for me. Perhaps that says more about me.",3,2012,09,10
132,Amazing service,"What a lovely hotel with fabulous staff, who provided incredible service. At check in just mentioned why we were in London, on return a bottle of champagne in the room. Worth every penny! Decor interesting to say the least, rooms light and bright, lifts a trip in space, modern but relaxing, a lovely place to stay, will definently stay at this hotel when in London. If have to say anything negative and it's not really, gym great but spa a little odd.",5,2012,09,09
132,"Shaken, not stirred","I've been staying at the Sanderson quite regularly for about 4 years - and when I say regularly, I mean at least once a month.  It has everything I like, quirky decor, wonderful greeting, airy bright rooms, great gym, wild lifts, two bars and a restaurant.  Thank God for the Gym.  It's a very smart way of recovering from the two bars where nearly all the bartenders make classically glacial vodka martinis. (My colleagues tell me they do all the drinks well but I see no reason to change.) The restaurant serves a wonderful English breakfast for people who've been to the Gym and kindly enough - a continental breakfast people who should. Later in the day it serves a wonderfully inspired twist on Malaysian food. In fact, if the Sanderson was in Kuala Lumpur, it would be just as popular as it is in London.",5,2012,09,05
132,Simply amazing.,"Loved this hotel from day one. Fantastic design and art. Lovely staff and hotel concierge, very helpful and friendly! Great location.. Walking distance to lots of things. Rooms were tiptop and the bed was super cozy! ",5,2012,09,03
132,"Chic, modern and lively hotel:- a great place to stay","The Sanderson Hotel, London is uniquely designed in a modern quirky décor, offering wide open spaces (great for those who love open plan design, as I do) interspersed with funky unusual furniture; nothing is ‘uniform’ about The Sanderson, which somehow offers new levels of relaxation and recreation. The welcome desk was not looming upon me, but instead somewhere in the far distance to my left. The doorways to an interesting shop, a restaurant and the lifts all had the same beautiful mirror surrounds that one may only know which doorway to enter by asking or by chance exploration. In fact, this is really the theme at this luxurious designed hotel. Expect the unexpected and enjoy moving beyond the ‘norm’, which I certainly did. Check-in was rapid and without a glitch, so before long I was entering the galaxy inspired lift and whizzing up to the fifth floor. My luggage was with me just one minute later, literally. This is the fastest hotel service I have experienced, so I was able to relax and take in the brilliant white surroundings with voile curtain partition’s offering a beautiful fluid feeling to the open plan design, complete with glass partition’s for the shower and toilet, offering a spacious flow from room to room. There was no bathtub in this particular room, but as the shower was so great, I honestly did not miss this. I did need to request a kettle, as there was none automatically provided in the room, as although one can use room service, it is wonderful to make your own beverages whenever you require replenishment. Rombarts Coffee Filters and Organic tea were waiting for me upon my arrival back to the hotel later in the day, along with an exotic fruit platter and two delicious cup cakes. The beds are very large and plush. I benefitted from a deep sleep that night, also helped by the most comfortable pillows imaginable. 

Salt & Honey Express Treatment

Efficiency certainly is a theme for the entire hotel, as the Spa called me to say that my appointment for the following day at Agua Spa could be brought forth one day, which was ideal for myself. Less than ten minutes later I slipped into the escalator and arrived at Agua Spa ready for my express Salt and Honey Treatment. The Spa ambience was very peaceful and serene. There are few walls here, as a white floaty curtain sections off each ‘room’. The therapist greeted me warmly, explaining the express treatment. Salt and Honey was massaged over my body, offering intense invigoration to assist my circulation and detoxification. It had been a day of running to many appointments in London, and my body sincerely welcomed every minute of the twenty-five minute treatment, which actually seemed slightly longer. The massage was firm and deep. The therapist discussed healthy eating habits, as I had mentioned I wished to clear any cellulite, She recommended cutting back on salt, eating high protein, and low carbohydrate – yet always to include some to keep the energy in your body burning well. She mentioned that it is a good idea to have larger meals earlier in the day, and end the day eating the smaller meal, preferably with no carbohydrates, high protein and no fruit. Swap regular cheese for cottage cheese, and bread for crisp bread. Also it is a great idea, according to the therapist, to body brush to stimulate the circulation, and drink plenty of fluids that are not high in caffeine. I was guided to the shower room to rinse off the salt and honey scrub. Cascading water from all four corners of the shower greeted me, offering one of the most invigorating five-minute showers I have known to date. It almost takes your breath away. I emerged feeling so fantastically vitalized, and cleansed at a deep level. I left Agua Spa with a spring in my step and a radiant smile ready for my evening plans. 

Agua Salt and Honey treatment is £40 for 25 mins. 

Food

I was able to find a vegetarian breakfast upon the menu, which delighted me. My breakfast comprised of a vegetarian spinach sausage, bubble and squeak, baked beans, baby vine tomatoes, eggs, toast, filled croissants, fresh orange juice, and Latte. The breakfast was extremely flavorsome and each morsel savored. Once again the service is timely, and collection of the tray efficiently quick. 

Additional highlights

You may enjoy the long bar, as the vibe is sublime and enticing, yet I was unable to experience such as I had other plans that evening. It is great to stay at a ‘happening’ hotel where nightlife is thriving. 

The Sanderson is a place to be…a place to experience and relax. 

The Sanderson is located between Oxford Circus and Tottenham Court",4,2012,08,31
132,Fab Experience,"I visited the Sanderson a few years ago whilst entertaining clients, sadly the experience was a negative one. I am pleased though, to be able to say that since that visit, my perception has certainly changed! 

I have maintained visiting the long bar with clients but not stayed or entertained in the restaurant. I contacted the management team recently to advise of my experience previously and to explain that my 3 year anniversary was approaching but I was unsure whether to stay.

The team at the Sanderson did everything from that phone call through to the moment we left to make our visit over BH weekend amazing! Our room was fantastic (Deluxe King, my partner is 6ft3"" and he could've slept width ways had he wanted!), cocktails was delicious (Polish bar man could do with etiquette advice), complimentary bottle of champagne was a exceptional surprise for us! I think our choice of dishes at dinner could've been better but they certainly cater to all tastes (Squid starter highly recommended). I would certainly return!",5,2012,08,29
132,Uncoventionally different for the right reasons,"Google Mapped the outside & thought ""not sure about the look"" but gambled on the inside pictures being accurate & they are accurate.  I think this is an office converted & got to commend them on the high standards achieved. It's quirky & makes you smile all the time. From the Frontman Greeter throughout, we found all staff very attentive & genuinely happy. I'd mentioned on booking that it was our 21st anniversary & asked if possible for an early check in, which they obliged. The Receptionist commented on it being our anniversary, congratulated us and worked to find a few complimentary upgrades which we greatly appreciated. Seems a trendy place for non residents to drop into but you can comfortably moved about as a resident even if you don't quite match up dress wise to those that have dropped in. We used the Soa facility for about an hour. The lady member of staff made us very comfortable, explaining the complimentary & chargeable services. When we eventually got back to our room (very comfortable and trendy. A relaxing room indeed) we'd been left a complimentary bottle of Champagne which shows the attention they laid to my low key booking. Overall, we're greatly impressed & thankful to all the staff we met for making our stay memorable. They did the Hotel proud",4,2012,08,26
132,Great Cocktails in Long Bar,"Went to the Long Bar for cocktails with some friends. The staff were really friendly, cocktails delicious! Because of the lovely weather we sat in the patio, which was beautifuly decorated with some candles etc. The decor of the bar is fantastic, lovely long net curtains all around make you feel like you are in a fairy tale. I noticed they do afternoon tea, which looked very appetizing.",5,2012,08,23
132,Beneath the veneer - a huge dissapointment,"Arrived in the evening and bar was busy with people spilled out on to the street smoking making for an unpleasant experience trying to get to reception.  Was checked in promptly, and offered an upgrade (at an additional cost) which I accepted.  The room was a big let down - nice decoration but ridiculous layout with television at an angle that couldn't be seen from the bed.  Lots of space but no seating area. The rooms are fine if you want something that looks nice but the comfort factor was seriously lacking. The receptionist failed to tell me that I had been put into a smoking room.  Ordered room service which arrived after about 35 mins (uncovered and cold) and was pretty poor .  The partying either in or around the hotel went on until late therefore it was hard to get to sleep.  

As with other comments if you complain the staff are polite but do not really seem to care or wish to right the situation.   I can think of four or five better alternatives in this area of London and do not intend to stay here again.",1,2012,08,19
132,Great service but could not be everyone's cup of tea.,"I will begin by telling that the location is fairly convenient (not exactly dead center but close enough and for who likes quiet maybe better than too central), the staff is friendly, well trained and willing to help with a smile and the rooms are clean and of a decent size. The breakfast is correct and weather permitting terrace/patio using makes it cozy and relaxing.
In the Superior king room the whole bathroom construction including the partition towards the room is glass. It doesn’t have a door but an electric curtain may offer some privacy if needed. All the doors inside are glass (transparent or not) including the shower and the toilet cabins. This may look good but are not practical at all: on one hand the first of the occupants to take a shower is unmistakably splashing water through the 1 inch gap between doors or cracks between glass partitions such that the floor becomes wet and slippery and both uncomfortable and dangerous for the second person. On the other hand, since same gaps are present for the toilet cabin the cohabitants of the room better not drink carbonated drinks and stay away from bloating foods as privacy is super flue and every little noise can be heard from everywhere in the room. A bit too intimate I would say…
Also, the hallway floor is somewhat noisy and inexplicably covered with a cheap carpet plus whenever anybody closes a door on a floor, everyone on that floor knows it. This may be annoying especially early in the morning or late at night. No noise insulation whatsoever.
Other than that, the place is funky (must note that holographic “stellar” elevator) and Stark did a good job decorating it. The Long Bar with the tens of his signature bar stools really looks its Stark-Best I’d say.
All in all, despite the minor discomforts it was a nice stay, staff being the highlight.",3,2012,08,17
132,A fantastic stay in a beautiful setting,"We recently stayed at the Sanderson for three nights whilst visiting for the Olympic Games. From the moment you arrive and the front door is opened, the style and class of this Hotel is immersive. The lobby is beautifully decorated with flowing voil, modern art and funky furniture, and it doesn't stop there... the room was crisp, clean and modern and packed with design. The bathroom was particuarly special, being almost entirely perspex (the walls have voil for privicy!) and the complimentary products were also very nice. I found it a bit annoying that wifi in the room was not complimentary, it being free would definitely add to the overall 5star package, particularly as the room rates are quite high. Other than that I could not fault the room, it was the definition of relaxing!!
After visiting the theatre on the first night we decided return to the hotel and have drinks at the Long Bar. The cocktails our friendly bartender advised were brilliant and made a fantastic end to the day... so much so, we visited the bar every night! In fact, we found all the staff to be welcoming, fun and always helpful.
Staying at the Sanderson was a brilliant experience which, when combined with a bustling Olympic London, made it a perfect place for relaxation and play. I would definitely stay again.
",5,2012,08,14
132,What's Not To Like About This Boutique,"We stayed at Sanderson Hotel for a few nights in-between moving apartments which is always somewhat stressful but being able to stay here made it all better. I find the modern contemporary design soothing in many respects particularly as a large portion of the rooms are decorated all white. By the end of it I didn't really want to leave and when faced with decorating our new place days later found myself trying to copy some of the Sanderson's elements.
I think my favourite thing was riding up and down the elevator which has a feel of floating through a galaxy, although not sure I would want to try it after some drinks LOL.
The hotel staff were perfectly attentive to guests from the moment that we pulled up out the front, through check in and check out. Staff at this hotel don't just want to help you when you approach them, they want to help all the time.
Facilities at the hotel are outstanding from bar to restaurant in fact I have been meaning to pop back to try a couple of things.
Overall not only one of my favourite Hotels in London but also Europe and a large part of me can't wait until I have to move house again so I can stay again.",5,2012,08,13
132,Wow what a place.........,"We stayed for one night at Sanderson Hotel when we came for an Olympic event.  It's a really swish place and great for people watching.  The foyer, and the billiard room off it are stunning. And very Dali-esque.  The staff were attentive and there's water and champagne on the reception desk to refresh you while you wait.  Check-in was very smooth with the cases being whisked up to the room before we got there.  The lift, as mentioned in previous reviews, is quite something! Yes, the corridors are dark but I think this just adds to the chill-out atmosphere of the place.  The huge bedroom was open-plan. A massive white sleigh bed in the centre of the room.  Everything in the room was positioned at an angle which took a little bit of adjusting to especially after a few glasses of wine!  The dressing area, toilet and wet room were separated by white nets and glass which gives a dream-like, ethereal feel to the room.  The toiletries were really top quality and it was good to have them replenished during the turn down service. All in all a really good experience.  If you are looking for a top-end, quirky hotel with a bit of celebrity spotting thrown in, Sanderson is a really good bet.  Highly recommended.",5,2012,08,13
132,Luxury...,"Everytime I go to London I stay in this masterclass of a hotel. Check-in is really easy and the bell boys come straight out to collect your bags. Security is high aswell so this makes me feel safe. The rooms are are white and very, very nice. The corridors are quite dark though, but for me its not a problem. I know this wont effect your stay but the lift us great. The three walls in the loft are themed like space and its great. The food is delicious and the service is great. The bar is amazing and it has a great atmosphere.",5,2012,08,12
132,Not my cup of tea...,"Don't get me wrong it's a lovely hotel and we were greeted by lovely people, it starts with the lift, something out of a night club, the halls are so dark it's unbelievable and that's at 12 noon, the room was bizarre with net curtains for walls and see through showers and a bed in a most bizarre angle.

The bar area and restaurant were much better so overall if you like quirky and unusual you'll love it but if you like the Dorchester then this isn't for you",4,2012,08,06
132,"Luxurious, querky and fantastical!!","Stayed at the Sanderson last weekend for the opening ceremony of the Olmpics and the hotel was wonderful. Just off Oxford Circus, you have not got far at all to walk into the action of the main shopping street and Soho. You walk in and are immediately hit by the boutique beauty of the place. Quirky furnishings, funny yet tasteful art and a warm welcome. The service is top class, spoilt from the front door, the front desk....all the way round the hotel, even to the sausages at the morning buffet (very fresh btw...and you can order what you like if you're not a buffet type). The building used to be an office block funnily enough but has been refurbished and wonderfully modernised. The rooms are a hott, I'll leave this for your imagination....nothing to what I was expecting. The hotel all round exceeded my expectations...a memorable stay.",5,2012,08,01
132,Blocking the money on your credit card,"I came to London for job and inviting company booked me this hotel. I think that the main aim of the hotel is to be comfortable. For sure, nice and modern design is always great ( and this hotel has super modern and stylish design), but the main thing for me is when things meet their requirements.

There is a chink between door in the shower and the shower cabin (its not a mistake, its designed like that), so when I have shower and water splashes all around, the water goes in that chink as well. There is also really tiny round shelf in the shower, so when I was trying to put there my own shampoo, which is not that small as the hotel's one, it used to fall and hit my legs all the time. This all is not a big deal, but if you are staying in 5 stars hotel you just want to feel comfortable.

One very disappointing thing and the reason why i m writing this comment is about blocking money on your card. Normally hotels block about 100 pounds/euro as a guarantee of payment in case you were using extra services as room service or spa. But not 400 pounds! I stayed Sanderson 2 days, then I left to another city, and came back to London and stayed there again for 4 days. For the first stay everything was ok about my card and they didnt block any money. But at my second stay I found out that hotel blocked 400 pounds, which is quite big sum of money. They are supposed to unblock the money at check-out, but for that moment i couldn't use those money. I came downstairs to the reception and they told me that they count it as 100 pounds per day, so as I m staying 4 days it's 400 pounds. I wonder if I stayed for a week, would they have blocked all my card, because I had just 600 pounds on it. When i talked to the reception, the lady told me that i could left 100 pounds cash as a deposit - why they didn't tell that before? For sure i d left 100 than 400, its a big difference! Its very disappointing that such big hotel restricts the freedom and ruins plans of a tourist without even noticing before.",3,2012,07,18
132,"3rd time I've stayed, modern hotel","Stayed for a night, 3rd time so about time I wrote a review. Very modern hotel, big reception area, funky furniture. Check in and out quick and easy. The room not huge, but big enough, crisp linens, nice toiletries very powerful shower. Long bar, nice and buzzy atmosphere, very expensive drinks but knew this from before- pear Bellini £14. Service was very good though. The restaurant is simply delicious. Extremely helpful staff. We sat outside first but it got a bit chilly so we mov inside. We ordered 6 little dishes, every one was fabulous, from the satay to the pork belly. Well located, we walked to the Shaftesbury theatre in the day to see rock of ages (rubbish by the way, have reviewed that separately). Also great for shopping in oxford st and surrounding streets. A really pleasant stay.",4,2012,07,15
132,May not be for business travellers,Modern and unique. Long bar also nice. However may not be suitable for business travellers - corridors were bit too dark for me I almost fell (and I was sober!),3,2012,07,14
132,Avoid the courtyard rooms,"its a lovely hotel, the service and rooms perfect.
Ask for rooms far away from the courtyard.
You will sleep better.",4,2012,07,09
132,Beware the dreaded fire alarms,"Have been a regular at The Sanderson for many years. 

Great hotel and typically impeccable service - until now.

Spent the weekend there and was woken by fire alarms early in the morning on Saturday AND Sunday.  Apparently the system is extremely sensitive and if someone chooses to smoke in their room every guest in the hotel knows about it. 

The most disappointing bit was the response from the assistant manager. When I first raised my complaint about being woken he said there was nothing he could do. Subsequently, he chose to refund my room upgrade and mini bar tab. All a little too much, a little too late. 

Sad to say I am disappointed with my favorite London hotel. ",2,2012,07,04
132,Terrible check-in experience ruined stay,"This hotel is beautiful to look at but extremely rude, arrogant staff let it down. I have stayed in this hotel on a number of times with my partner and although we've tried other hotels what always pulls us back to the Sanderson is the room and particularly the bed - it is so huge and so comfortable and you are guaranteed a great night's sleep. And on this occassion, I did have a great sleep but my problem began at check-in. 
I arrived on a later flight and my partner had already checked in and left the hotel leaving a key for me at reception. Arriving at reception, there was no warm greeting, no welcome, just a miserable, grumpy, rude lady (I am so disappointed I didn't get her name to make a proper complaint but she had brown short hair and was possibly south african, new zealander.) When I explained my partner had left my name, she checked the computer screen and curtly replied, 'You're name is not on the room so I can't let you in.' She then went on to the next customer without letting me respond. I called my partner to check and he guaranteed me it was on the room. I then had to wait for 5 or so minutes while the horrible lady dealt with another customer. She came back and as I politely told her 'My name is definitely on the room.' She cut me short with 'Sir, I've told you your name is not on the room so you'll have to appreciate I'm not letting you in.' At this point I was getting irritated as she wasn't letting me explain that they had changed my partner's room and he had filed out paperwork and they had probably forgot to transfer my name from the old room to the new one. At this point she went behind the wardrobe and returned with said paperwork and started to make me a key. What was terrible here was that there was absolutely no recognition of her mistake or the fact she had made me wait or being so rude to me. I had to say something so I told her I found her rude. I was obviously not the first person to think this as her rehearsed response of 'I'll endeavour to rectify that' simply made me more annoyed. This woman really shouldn't be working in this industry. A simple, smile, a welcome, a friendly face is what you're looking for. Not this arrogant, obnoxious, rude woman. It really did dampen my stay and I really don't think I'll ever return - most comfortable hotel beds in the world or not.
On other bad notes - the glasses in the mini bar were filthy and I had to ring and wait for clean ones.
And the pressure in the shower was so strong, it was actually painful.
In short this hotel is beautiful to look at with stunning rooms but the staff could definitely do with some training and possible learn how to smile and be polite to the customers.",2,2012,06,26
132,Beautiful hotel!,"Stayed here for a night recently and have to say i loved it. The room was beautiful and tranquil, location was amazing for shopping on oxford street and the food in the restaurant was exciting and really really tasty. Crazy expensive but i think...it was worth it.",5,2012,06,22
132,Still not convinced,"Had been a year ago for business, wasnt particularly impressed so decided to wait a while and try again.
Have to say that all the good points (friendly staff, good bar/entertainment) are still there, however, the concept of the hotel still is bewildering to me and so detracts from the experience.
The main bar is still as active as ever, with Thursday-Sat nights being a free for all for all kinds of beatiful people. The Sauna is spectacular as is the whole health center.
My issue is with the rooms that are very dark (already the lift is basically pitch balck and so are the corridors) and with the basic nature of the rooms. 
Beds in the center of room, curtains that divide the living area from the bathrooms, not even a mirror in front of the wash-basin, rather on its side making shaving a nightmare.
I think the hotel's concept was modern a few years ago, but now it just seems dated and would reccomend a make over..",4,2012,06,20
132,Awful door men!,"My husband & I were entertaining customers recently, and after dinner at Nobu we decided to take them to The long bar, we have had many great night and wanted to show our company what a great hotel.  Wrong move we left a very stylish Nobu bar only to be treated disgracefully by the door men at the Sanderson. Not only were we turned away for no reason we were extremely embarrassed as these were my husbands top customers. I think the policy is if your face fits you get in. Very very disappointing indeed!!",3,2012,06,19
132,Cream Tea- expect to wait a while for your tea.,"I went there on a Sunday for a birthday Cream Tea, the presentation was lovely, the food was nice but nothing special, they hype up the food to make it sound unusual, but its just lollipops and stuff, there was more sweet stuff than savory, the sandwiches were lovely and fresh but small. However my main problems were we weren't asked what tea we would like until after he had brought us the food, so by the time the tea came we were half way through our food, also a few of us asked for fruit tea, their tea didn't arrive with ours, in fact they had to wait another 30 minutes plus just to be told they had run out, so by the time they had received anything to drink we were nearly finished.
Also the most upsetting and frustrating part was that I had originally booked a table for 7, but when I tried to change it to 8 the day before I was told no I couldnt, they were completely and fully booked, so I had to tell one of my friends sorry you can't come at the last minute, not what I wanted to do on my birthday. Which would have been understandable if we had gone there to a packed out restaurant, but it wasn't, and we could have easily added an 8th person to our table and I could have had all my friends with me.
In summary, nice, but not £40 worth of nice, Cream tea at the Ritz is much better! (£35 plus they added on £5 service charge) but would have been nicer if all my friends were there being fed and watered on time",3,2012,06,18
132,Excellent Hotel,"I stayed at the Sanderson hotel a while back with a group of Friends for Royal Ascot last year. (sorry for the delay in the review) we stayed for a week and we had several rooms including one of the penthouse suites.
The rooms are amazing very comfortable with everything you could ever need in a bedroom. Robes slippers Spa Toiletries.
The rooms are of a good size to. 
The lifts in the hotel are great never seen anything like it before.
The penthouse was amazing the furnishings were nice to With your own private lift we had views right over the whole of the city to.
we did have a few parties in there after a few successful days at the races but we never had any problems with noise.
The staff were always very friendly polite and very helpful.
we were in the main bar most evening before going into town and it was always packed but a really good atmosphere with a few famous faces amoungst the crowd.

We ate at the hotel a few times and the food was always great. we didnt encounter any problems whilst staying at this hotel and by the end of the week we didnt want to leave as we were having so much fun.

The hotel is a couple of minutes walk from Oxford Street so ideal for us and the shopping.
we would definatly stay here again and we would recommend this hotel to enyone! :)",5,2012,06,17
132,Beautiful Rooms,"Great part of town with stunning rooms and a super chic bar.

Paper thin walls though. You can hear every single foot step of people walking down the corridors and when walking down the corridor you can hear other people talking / TVs etc.

For the reason above, I wouldn't stay there again.",4,2012,06,14
132,Super cool hotel!,"I stayed at this cool hotel with my partner on a city break to London. I love the decor of Morgan hotels & having stayed at St Martins Lane in London & both The Huson & The Royalton in New York.
Rooms are never massive, but are contempary & stylish. The cocktail bar off the foyer is a great place for predinner drinks, with a real buzz & great music. Berry capprinha's are to die for.
Great service.",5,2012,06,11
132,Blown away!!!,"Well what can I say...? It was amazing, from start to finish.  On arrival, the desk staff were attentive and so lovely.  I (and especially my partner James) could not believe it when we arrived to our room with an amazing spacious balcony!  We made the most of it all weekend as we both love being outside, and we enjoyed the sun each morning (even when we woke at 6am we sat outside for half an hour before going back to sleep).  The candles made the balcony look stunning so I was glad we arrived in the evening!  Thanks to the hotel staff for lighting them before our arrival.  I recommend to anyone to get the Loft Suite - it's just amazing.
  
We visited the Long Bar with a good friend who came to see us for a couple of hours; she is used to being in Chelsea and is a banker but she was so impressed with the whole place and I of course, was singing its' praises.  I think she will be coming back herself soon enough :-)
 
The service in the Purple Bar was outstanding from start to finish, and the cocktails were stunning (chosen by the very talented bar staff because we didn't have a clue what we wanted!).
 
My final word; I was genuinely and honestly touched by everyone's generosity, flexibility and attentiveness throughout the whole of our stay.  James and I thank you so incredibly much, in his words, it was ""immense""!  I look forward to being there again soon and you have set the bar very high!!

Particular thanks goes to Sonia who was helpful from the word 'go' before I even got to the Sanderson! A sincere thanks from the bottom of my heart for helping me make James's birthday so special! Five stars and more! Thank you.

132,Simply the best.,Another night at the Sanderson and am happy to report that their high standards have been maintained.  Informed them that the stay was a birthday surprise for my wife and on return back to our room there was a complimentary bottle of Champagne.  A really lovely touch from a 1st class hotel.  Can't wait till our next visit.,5,2012,06,03
132,Excellent option,"I wasn't sure about the garish furniture in the foyer with a slightly euro trash feel.  But the room was calm and worked exceptionally well.

Despite being the base level room I had plenty of space and everything I needed.  It felt light and open and fresh.

The day spa was worth a visit.  And all room service was excellent.  The jet lag juice from the day spa menu was terrific.

I found all the staff to be helpful and very friendly.

The location is excellent.  Two minutes walk north of Oxford Street.  Good local cafes in nearby Charlotte Lane.  Lantana made great coffee.

Suggestions - tea and coffee facilities are available via housekeeping but I only stumbled upon this being available.  No power points in the bathroom means hairdryers need to be plugged in to the floor socket next to the hall mirror. The cord isn't that long which makes using your hairdryer awkward and an annoying design fault to an otherwise well laid out room.  

",4,2012,05,31
132,Pure luxury in the Penthouse suite,"My boyfriend and I spent a night in the truly stunning Penthouse suite... it was a dream hotel room!

Firstly a private lift with our own butler took us up to the room, and it was stunning. The bed was set at an angle in the centre of the bedroom and it was huge and super comfortable, with fluffy white pillows.

The room is dreamy and romantic, with floaty curtains draped all around the room. The bathroom was just as luxurious - it was set 'within' the bedroom, in a glass 'box' draped with the same curtains. There was a large power shower, lovely products, and an amazing huge metal bath with steps leading up to it.

The location of the hotel is fantastic, and the views from the suite are magnificent. The windows are huge and you have an awesome view of London from both sides of the suite.

We ordered lot's of food, drinks and champagne and it all came promptly - the service was excellent, discreet but friendly and helpful.

I would DEFINITELY recommend this hotel for a romantic break; especially the Penthouse suite!",5,2012,05,25
132,Adequate,"Got off to a rather rocky start with checkin.  Unfortunately, this young lass Laura from Vancouver Canada was a real snot.  She was too busy kibitzing with other people instead of helping us register.  We got in rather late and were tired, to say the least, what with the time change and jet lag.  But if we were men in tight fitting clothes we would have had her undivided attention, alas we weren't.  She waved us in the general direction of 'The Purple Room' telling us she would 'sort things out'.  But she didn't and we had to go find someone else who sorted out the mess she made.  She half-heartedly apologized saying 'she just got on full-time and was finding her way around this'??????  What????  

The room was interesting and stylish.  The location in London is unparalleled.  We did feel better after a good nights sleep, but after our encounter with Laura, we avoided her whenever we had to ask for help at the desk.  Like we said, if we were well buffed men she would have licked us up.",3,2012,05,23
132,"amazing staff, perfect night","I booked Sanderson recently for some friends of mine who were travelling from Australia and I wanted to give them one special night. Sanderson was perfect. They came back and said all sorts of lovely things: the staff were fantastic, they always seemed ready to help and talk, even if it wasn't their job. they were confident they could call the front desk and ask anything and it would be sorted out. they made a particular comment about how buzzy and lively the bars were but they felt so relaxed and tranquil upstairs. there were loads more but those were the highlights!",5,2012,05,23
132,Very Special Hotel,I stayed there for 2 days. The decoration was very special rather minimal. Bathroom was excellent with shower room and bathtub as well. Very clean. Room service great. Spa piece of art. This hotel has a nice sense of a smaller friendly hotel. My only complain was that there was not real honey at breakfast but only akakia honey which did not taste well.  Very good location close to everything.,4,2012,05,16
132,where to stay in London? this is the place,Been in london for weeks on business and have been staying at the Sanderson. The team on the front desk are fantastic. I can't decide which smile i like best. The guys on the floor are all over it. and the barmen are literally on fire.,5,2012,05,15
132,Just the place we were looking for!,"We were looking for a slightly whacky, crazy, but still sophisticated hotel with a high level of QOL for the weekend, and we found it at the Sanderson. As soon as we entered the reception, it felt bright and airy with some whacky furniture and visuals in it.  The staff behind the reception desk were cool and sexy, and set the same tone in the way they interfaced with my wife and I as the hotel felt. We had arrived early and had only planned to leave our luggage at reception, but they checked us straight in, no problem. 

The room we had booked online was the cheapest (at £300), so was expecting it to be small, and it was, but brilliantly designed, laid out and was very bright and airy. The bathroom was part of the same room with only thick opaque glass separating the room, the bathroom, the toilet and the shower, all separate. There was an electric curtain you could use to separate the bathroom from the room. We didn't bother, but if I was sharing the room with anyone but my wife, I would.  There was one painting in the rool...and it was stuck on the ceiling above the bed...great fun. The room was just what we had been looking for.

We were out all afternoon and night and came back around midnight and the huge bar was heaving and very loud, just as we had been expecting, but not what we were looking for.  When we checked in we had been told there was a VIP Bar just for hotel guests we could use if we wanted called The Purple Room.  It was just off the reception, and the entrance looked like the entrance to a lift and the way the door appeared I thought I was supposed to be hitting the button for a lift, but it as just a walkway into the bar, the visuals wee just crazy!  When we walked in it was very...Purple!  It was very small and tight, but it felt cozy and quiet with some ambient jazz music, just what we were looking for.  Probably room for 20-30 people. Mainly a cocktail bar and the staff knew how to make a cocktail for sure.  I was actually only after a coffee and when I asked I had my only negative experience as the waitress said it would take about 20 mins as she would have to go to the restaurant/bar to get it. It was really just a 'we don't do coffees here' kind of comment, so as i can't drink alcohol I ordered a Coke.  Behind the bar I had noticed a more mature, sophisticated spanish looking cocktail guy and a couple of minutes after we had ordered our drinks, he came up and asked me what coffee I had asked for, and disappeared out of the bar. A minute later, he returned with my espresso and a tiny jug of 'liquified' sugar and poured it into my coffee. Incredible! A couple of lazy hours chatting later we paid our bill and retired to our room...the coffee wasn't on the bill. The Purple Room is a must.

We had decided long before the trip to find our sunday morning breakfast in Covent Garden, but now wished we had had it at the hotel.  In the afternoon when we returned to collect our luggage we also noticed lots of people enjoying their afternoon teas. A little expensive as others have mentioned, but I'm sure it would have been worth every penny.

We booked literally two days before our stay so it was only to be expected that our room was just around the corner from the lifts, and as you would also have expected on a Saturday stay in a crazy vibrant hotel, we got woken once in the night by a group returning to their room in the early hours, but if you want a quiet boring time, the Sanderson is not for you, and so keep out...they (and we) don't want you there! ;)",5,2012,05,07
132,"relaxing, modern hotel with superb service","The service was impeccable, friendly but not overbearing.  the room was clean, well stocked, and comfortable.",5,2012,05,04
132,"elegant, perfect position and kindness","I was at the Sanderson last week for job reasons, with a large group of guests. I would suggest this hotel to anyone: elegant, modern, central. The design attitude is really well executed, furniture is stunningand all the officers are extremely kind, with a problem solving approach. Breakfast is good and also the malaysian restaurant is really tasty.",5,2012,05,02
132,MAD - BAD HATTERS TEA !!,A very disappointing experience. Very poor service-disinterested staff. All served together - champagne brought with tea cakes etc. No one asked if we wanted more tea or if things were ok. Table next to us was having chineese food!!! Smell of this off-putting. Cold despite the heaters. Not worth £35 a head - worth about £5!!,1,2012,04,27
132,Wonderland,"I booked the Sanderson as a birthday treat for a friend. Being a Londoner, I'm used to getting deals with London hotels. Often they'll give you their best rooms for their lowest rates if they know they aren't going to fill the rooms. No such luck with the Sanderson. They are part of the Morgans Hotel Group, and my charming haggling fell on deaf ears. 

I booked a standard double for Friday / Saturday with breakfast.

You approach what looks like a nondescript office block, and then enter into Lewis Carroll's Wonderland. If any hotel lobby has a wow factor, this is it. And because the interior is fantastical and not fashionable, it's really ageing well. We checked in and a bellboy took our bags and then, on the way to our room, gave us a tour of the hotel. The room was much bigger than I expected, and looked exactly like the pictures on the website. It was immaculate, and filled with signature Phillippe Stark touches: sleigh bed, weird weights, yards of chiffon, framed picture on ceiling. The bathroom was separated from the main room by glass walls. The sink was set in an orange cut glass mirrored table, with a single white rose head in a small vase. It was all pretty much perfect.

There is a huge central courtyard for outside drinking/dining. Breakfast is served there too. In the evening, the centre of focus is the Long Bar, which is open to guests as well as the general public. It can be hilarious for people watching and drunken shenanigans. The bar is very popular with single women and guys in suits who like to buy drinks. But guest can escape all this in two resident only areas: the pool room, and The Purple Bar. The pool table is pretty tatty considering the rest of the hotel, and the cocktails in the Purple Bar are some of the best I've tasted, but they come at a premium price. 

Another aspect of the hotel is the gym and the spa. The spa is literally heaven-like. Treble height ceilings, hung with signature chiffon, create different zones, with the constant sound of running water. You'd never believe you were just off Oxford Street.

And finally, after all this, when you return to your room, you'll find the hotel's turn-down service have left lit tea-light candles, which illuminate the white rooms.

Everyone should experience a weekend at The Sanderson.",5,2012,04,24
132,Exceptional service and timeless design - a TREAT,"Booked the Sanderson for a special night away and the stay exceeded all expectations. Our Loft room was exceptionally light and spacious with high quality design. Agua spa package was great value

They really went the extra mile with service in every respect when I informed them of a special occasion, thanks to Marcela. One slight issue with our booking was not only resolved but compensated for above our expectations",5,2012,04,10
132,Really special hotel,"The whole stay was very pleasant.  Service was brilliant from the beginning and staff was always ready to help with booking of restaurants and cabs.  The room with its unusual layout was very comfortable, especially the large double bed and the perfect pillows. We loved the hotel's decoration and the great furniture. Room service was always promptly provided and up to high standard. 
On Saturday we had a family dinner for 10 at the restaurant Suka and the staff were most obliging and helpful. When I requested a special surprise birthday dessert for my husband they diligently arranged it. 
Overall we appreciated the no fuss yet very attentive and correct service from the staff throughout our stay.",5,2012,04,05
132,WHAT A HOTEL!!!!,"This is by far the best hotel my partner and i have stayed in.  For a young(ish) couple like us, this hotel was perfect.  Really funky lobby with unusual furniture, next to the stylish bar with eyes printed onto the rear of the chairs.  This in addition to the intimate purple bar which is again stylishly decorated.  From the moment we stepped into the front entrance, our bags were taken from us by staff on the doors....just to walk to the check in desk.  We were running late to a function, which we relayed to the staff.  They immediately requested us a cab, took our bags up to our rooms for us, had an iron and ironing board ready for us, so we could quickly get changed and we were gone.  Brilliant service i know from experience i wouldn't have got anywhere else.  There are just so many quirky things in this hotel that make it great, such as the elevator, which was clad with stars, making you feel like your in space and the low level lighting on the floors which illuminated the room number from the floor.  The little bits that just make it really interesting.  I haven't even got to the room yet have i?...Well, we stayed in room 311, which was a queen deluxe.  Not much bigger than any other room you would book at this size, however due to the layout of it, it felt really big.  The semi transparent curtains which separate the bedroom from the bathroom and then the glass panels that separate the toilet form the shower just made it look very classy.  Again something very unique and nothing like i have ever seen from the usual boring room i have ever stayed in.  The little extras such as bath robes and slippers, just waiting there was great, just that extra touch, going that extra bit further.  This may also sound silly, but the towels were hug and thick, which you may expect from a hotel, but do not always get.  No great big wooden wardrobe, but a rail that is cleverly hidden away behind the curtains, again nice touches.  The bedroom itself had a nice big bed set at an angle, which faces the blinds (Which are electronically controlled).  The pillows are extremely comfortable!!...and the complimentary water each day helps with the hangover......!  I also think the small weights with the little diagram on how to use them is again something unique and another little touch that makes this hotel so impressive.  The staff are incredibly welcoming and cant do enough for you.  I really cant rate this hotel highly enough.  By far the best hotel we have ever stayed in and my girlfriend is American...she complains about everything, but not this one.  I do have one small minor moan though and that is about the price of the drinks in the purple bar which was at 40 pounds for a glass of wine and two cocktails, a bit excessive but everything else made up for that.  I would recommend this hotel to everyone i know who is going to London and for anyone who reads this post i would recommend it to you too, brilliant hotel, brilliant service and something you will have never seen before.  Daniel and Aynsley.",5,2012,04,03
132,We keep coming back,"This is one of the most beautiful places I've ever stayed (in a big city anyway).

I wish I could take the whole room back home with me (and the crazy furniture in the lobby too), but even if one ignores the great design and decoration, the Sanderson hotel is still a great place to stay when in London.

The Aqua Spa at the hotel offers superb therapies for tired muscles. The prices are reasonable - like any good spa in any major city in the world - the ambience is unique and so are the therapists. Well, at least the ones that I've tried anyway - thai style massage and regular aroma therapy massage. Do not miss this spa!

Breakfast buffet is big and plenty and will keep you going for most of the day.

We were lucky enough to have a Danish speaking concierge during our stay - that is quite extraordinary and lucky, but of course it doesn't exactly spoil the experience. He was very helpful and he was able to provide all the information (and tickets) that we needed.

We are usually travelling on a budget, so we prefer to stay there in January when the prices are very reasonable and you get really good value for money.",5,2012,04,01

132,The Sanderson Hotel Bar - A High Octane Experience.,"Of course it depends what time of the day or night you descend on the Sanderson Bar. On a weekday afternoon you can have the whole expanse of the bar to yourselves with the exclusive attention of a lone barman. Visit after 17.00hrs and the pace begins to hot up considerably. In the summer you'll need to book a table in the stylish courtyard and you could be standing at the bar for a fair amount of time before a couple of bar stools are vacated. Even when there is a light amount of action the bar staff seem to want to leave you alone before asking you what you'd like for your first drink. Most strange...Once you assert yourself however and get that first order in, things flow nicely thereafter. One small niggle is that they charge for the ""nibbles"". In every five star hotel bar these are always complimentary and add a nice ""classy"" touch making one feel, that despite the top end prices, one is receiving the true five star experience. That aside, it's one of the hip places to see and be seen in. I'd have to recommend it. Oh, and by the way, the Martinis are excellent!",5,2012,03,19
132,SUKA RESTAURANT,"I have just come in from a mother's day lunch for 6 people at The Suka, What a shambles that was, firstly the wrong menu come then 10 minutes later the rice appeared. When questioned the waiter told us to 'CHILL'. To end it off we were charged the WRONG set menu tariff.

Was woken early morning by fire alarm did as was instructed and made my way down the fire escape. It was alse alarm, thanks. Then was told at check out to phone back to claim a possible up grade on my next stay. This is not how you deal with a guest that has been dragged out of bed for no reason. I wont be phoning.",3,2012,03,11

132,Very special anniversary!,"We just spent our 11th wedding anniversary at Sanderson and were blown away.  The second we got there it was a different world.  A few steps away from the Saturday madness of Oxford Street we arrived at about 4pm to a perfect oasis of calm.  A wonderful welcome from John at reception got it off to a good start - no fawning like many other hotels, but just pleasant and genuine interest. A quick look around the lobby and you just know it's a very different type of hotel.  We had a Deluxe Double on the 5th Floor overlooking the main street.  Room was large and plenty of space to move around even with the huge sleigh bed dominating the the room.  Very quirky without being over the top, the bed positioned at an angle bang in the centre of the room with a painting from the ceiling above,  white drapes sectioning off the entrance to the room, various lighting options & candles, a massive full length mirror leaning casualy against one wall, wood flooring and the best bathroom I've seen to date.  A glass wall separates the bedroom from the bathroom with an automatic movable drape curtain to provide more privacy, freestanding roll top bath tub, separate toilet, a huge powerful walk in shower and some quality toiletries.  In all a space that we were happy to relax in. Going back downstairs for dinner around 8pm the lobby and bar had transformed into a club-style bar and had a totally different feel to it.  We took a table in the garden courtyard where we stayed for the rest of the evening.  The menu has changed since we last ate there and now it's just Malay rather than Asian-fusion, but this new menu works much better and with more value for money.  A few more cocktails after dinner while the DJ did his thing and that was our evening. All the restaurant team were great and attentive but not too much so that it was anoying - spot on.   Next morning the public areas were back to the relaxing cool as it was when we had first arrived. Didn't want to leave the next day - thank you Sanderson - pure quality - will be back!",5,2012,03,05
132,Wow... great hotel,"Just when I entered the Sanderson I understood its a bit diffrent hotel by the spactacular design, but I wan't evry exited from this hotel - its lobby is boring. 

But you don't have to stay too long in order to understand its the best hotel in London - the rooms are very big and well designed by Phillippe Starck. And the hotel cafe offers great patio at the SUCA. 

I didn't have tea time at the hotel becuase you have to book it 24hours in perior but next time in London I'll keep stayin at the same hotel and book the Tea Time in advance!",5,2012,03,04
132,"Unique, trendy, great cocktail bar","We had the 'loft' room which was really like staying in your own apartment. Bed was great, huge and comfortable, room had very modern interior decor.

132,"Stylish, well located, it's something different","Really different and with unique design, very well located, you'll find the Sanderson a choice that you will remember.
rooms are spacious with pampering amnities. However sometimes it seams that they went too far with the fine design. For example you won't be to wash your hands without rubbing the sink. Turning on the bed lights was also chalenging. Still it will be my choise for my next stay in London
If you can afford it - go for it.",4,2012,02,26
132,"Great, hip hotel if your young.","Have stayed at Sanderson hotel number of times and always had a great stay. Nice rooms, great mini bar and comfortable beds especially straight off an 8 hour flight from US. But our most recent and last stay, was extremely noisy from the club in the lobby. Two children could not get to sleep. Was moved to a room on the top floor and Was being cleared of previous guests who were smokers. Decent hotel and very hip. Just a little too noisy",4,2012,02,24
132,London's quarkiest,"This hotel is one fo the quarkiest you can find in London and is not because of the unique reception area, so modern and different than all the hotels.  It has 2 bars on the ground floor, one old school and another modern which seems to be attracting the wrong crowd and sometimes you feel like you are somewhere in Asia not in London.  There is a great restaurant and an outdoor area with heaters when is cold, so is a good place to relax and have a chat.  

The uniquely designed elevators, took me to the top floor where my suite was located, but how narrow the hallway was: 2 people could hardly pass near eachother.  Maybe this was to favour the suite, which as extremelly large, open plan, only separating the hallway and bathroom via glass and see through curtains.  A mix of Louis XV furniture and modern too, made the space even more interesting and the large terrace with Morrocan lights and lots of plants made the whole space so addictive.  One of my favourite places!",5,2012,02,24

132,Hip and happening.,"Having stayed at St Martins Lane previously, I decided to try their sister hotel.

Once again I was not disappointed.  The public areas are quirky and fun.I especially loved the Purple Bar. 

The room was spacious, very clean, and you know you are staying in a design hotel. 

The hotel is in a great location to explore the West End.",5,2012,02,20
132,Aging Trendster Trying to Keep Up,"O.K. -- so I'm not exactly hip, but I like to think I can spend some time in a trendy hotel and feel comfortable.  Maybe this is more about me, but I had a lot of problems feeling comfortable at The Sanderson.

Its dated.  The chair situation in the lobby is completely contrived (they even realigned them as soon as I tried a couple of them.)  The concierge is a pill -- unless you're hip.  The outdoor restaurant/lounge had a strange mix of customers, including a middle-aged couple making out next to me and my daughter -- ick -- really?  Really.

To get to my room, I had to take a nauseating space-themed elevator ride, only to land in a hallway so dark I walked by my room a few times.  Once in the room, I did find it spacious and well-appointed.  And quiet!  I was concerned that the place would be a noisy drunken party hotel, but my sleep experience was excellent.

And thus, I don't know what to think about this hotel -- it is a mixed message -- the public sections are trying too hard to be something they're not, and the rooms are a quiet refuge.",3,2012,02,17
132,I actually felt like Alice in wonderland,"What a wonderous stay it was. My boyfriend decided to blow half of our unofficial accommodation budget on staying at The Sanderson, without this bold move i don't know what our first impression of London would have been like. The cocktails, The beetroot crust-less sandwiches, and the surroundings of the Sanderson has left an everlasting impression on both of us. When booking we opted for the conservative deluxe room, which was perfect apart from the bed springs penertrating our kingsize mattress. located right in the heart of the media/ad agency land in Noho, it would be fair to say the bed had copped it's fair share of lunchtime debauchery.Totally understandable after a cocktail or two at the bar downstairs. Thankfully the lovely team at The Sanderson upgraded our room. We only had a couple of days to shop, eat our way through London and catch up with friends from NZ. If we had not of stayed somewhere so central we wouldn't have been able to fit everything in. I am now the biggest ambassador for The Morgans Group, particularly for the fact that they support and showcase some of the most talented spatial/industrial designers in the world. We will absolutely return on our next sojourn, hopefully next time i will stay awake long enough to enjoy room service after a hard night painting the town red.",5,2012,02,16
132,Hipster Hotel in London's Groovy Area,"I have always had good experiences staying at hotels operated by The Morgans Group and  Sanderson Hotel was no exception. My girlfriend and I went over to London from Dublin for the weekend and had a fine visit, contributing to that pleasant time was our stay at Sanderson. The moment you enter the lobby, its stylish appearance informs you of the uniqueness of the property. A very nice staff welcomes you and moments later you find yourself in your room, a room unlike the trad hotel rooms we have come to expect, the bed is on an angle creating a pleasing space. Bathroom, roomy and again not your traditional water closet. 
Walking distance to London's High Street shopping district, several minutes on foot to West End theater areas, Covent Garden,etc.
A 4 to 5 Star hotel in appearance, service and location. All together loverly.",4,2012,02,11
132,Fantastic Hotel,"I stayed here for 1 night on the 4th February with my sister. The hotel is absolutely amazing and loved everything about it. The staff on reception were very helpful, and the concierge too, was really friendly and happy to help with any query given to him. 
Our bedroom was fantastic, and the beds are the best I have ever slept in!!! The room was very large - we had a Superior room, which was brillant, all the little quirks to the room added to the extra special experience that the Sanderson gives to its guests. 
If you get any free time, go to the Long Bar and Suka - both are amazing, I had the most fabulous cocktail in the Long bar, and loved the buzzy atmosphere!!!
Overall a fab experience and I wouldnt hesitate to stay again!",5,2012,02,10
132,Sanderson,"Stayed at the Sanderson many times and is still the best hotel in London.  Not cheap, however you get what you pay for.  Rooms are 1st class, bar is great and staff very friendly and helpful.  Will definitely be staying again.",5,2012,02,07
132,Great stay and excellent staff: a welcome Jan treat,My partner booked the Sanderson for a January surprise treat. We live in London so it’s there is no real reason to visit London hotels (apart from to the great dining experiences and great bars). However we will definitely be visiting the Sanderson again. The concierge (Cam I believe he was called) was simply fantastic; he made us feel really special. It’s great to be treated to good service. We were planning on dining out but initially but he found us a lovely table in the restaurant. The food and the cocktails were great. I’ve been the bar before so knew what to expect- it’s always quite buzzing and the DJ was good.,4,2012,01,25
132,"Quirky, charming and professional","Great stay for a week in mid-January 2012 - staff very attentive and helpful, meeting room well-conditioned and catered for, bedrooms fresh clean and spacious.  Nice touch with lit candles in bedroom every evening (very special).  Minor criticisms would be the lack of fresh air circulating, bedroom windows did not open, they were very dirty and the view was beyond depressing. Also TV channel choice is appalling.  However, given the location, the overall standard of the hotel and the outstanding staff, the windows & TV are only small issues.  London has a world of entertainment to choose from. Internet service is excellent, showers and bathroom fabulous.  Food great, cocktails could be improved upon (e.g. lychee martini's should actually have martini in them!!).",5,2012,01,24
132,"Cool and hip, but unfriendly and soulless","The hotel's website gets your expectations quite high but the experience wasn't that special and not worth the price. Trendy furnishing and details here and there. The hotel's bar was one of the Soho's hot spots but there were old rich men hanging around with their escorts, so not very tempting. Location is excellent and lot of great restaurants near by though the concierge managed to mess the reservations several times. Room was spacious with wooden floor and modern furnishing. I'm confident that with this price I'll get better service and atmosphere elsewhere.",4,2012,01,23
132,Excellent,"Sorayareid@o2emial.co.uk... I enjoyed this stay, as the service was excellent especially Cam the Concierge, whether its Sanderson or St Martins Lane his attention to detail is spot on and he makes you feel welcomed before you arrive, and continues throughout the stay, he definately goes beyond the 1st class service you would expect from a hotel. I have and will tell my friends and always make them ask for Cam. I hope that he is available for when my partner books the penthouse for my birthday in April as we will expect the same service.",5,2012,01,22
132,First class customer service with great facilities,"We stayed over xmas, the room was superb and the staff were excellent at seeing to our every need. Definitely would stay again.",5,2012,01,20
132,cool and sleek,"great location, specta (Berner street), spectacular room and one of the coolest bar in London.",5,2012,01,17
132,I always love my trip to the sandersons,"I have been traveling to London with my business for over a year now and each month I am down I stay here. It's perfect. The staff are great, the purple lounge is Devine and the interior is minimalist/modern. I was even given a complimentary upgrade. You can't beat it central location and as it always seems to be ""the name on everyone lips, it's got to be.. Sandersons"" I have two more evenings here before I go and I will enjoy them. ",5,2012,01,16
132,Best cocktails around!!,"Having previously stayed here I recommended this hotel to my boss as the location of our Christmas night out.  We had a fabulous evening, cocktails in the purple bar were amazing, the food from the Suka restaurant was fabulous, the staff very very attentive and nothing was too much trouble.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2012,01,14
132,The Sanderson Hotel...WOW,"Stayed here 12 January 2012 in a deluxe room. The hotel looks nothing from the outside but walk into the lobby and it is fantastic. The decor is stunning and the lifts are very unusual. The staff are very welcoming and utterly professional. The rooms are fab and quirky. The food is exceptional. 

2 minutes walk from Oxford Street

Great hotel, great staff well worth a visit",5,2012,01,13
132,Amazing Stay,"I stayed at The Sanderson in September the night before my wedding, along with my four bridesmaids, then my wedding night with my new husband.

We had a fantastic stay! The hotel is absolutely beautiful; fabulous minimalist, interesting rooms and stunning lobby/lift/public areas. It also has a beautiful covered outdoor garden which is used for food and drinks can be taken out there too.

As it was such a special occasion I emailed the Guest Relations Manager Marcela before our stay letting her know what we were there for and she bent over backwards to make our stay even more special.
For the first night I had booked a Superior double double for the girls as this sleeps 4, and a Standard Queen for myself and my Mum to stay in.
Marcela gave us a better rate than we had for the double double, and gave me the choice of a free upgrade to either a loft suite or a loft with balcony. We took the loft with balcony and it was fantastic. When we got there she had a bottle of champagne sent up, and a bottle of wine to the room the girls were staying in along with a lovely note wishing me good luck for the following day.

We spent the first night in the Long Bar - excellent cocktails! We also had nibbles at the bar and breakfast the next day which were both great and service fantastic.
Would recommend this hotel to anyone who likes very modern design, looking for a special stay in London.",5,2012,01,13
132,anniversay getaway,"My boyfriend and I spent the anniversay weekend in this hotel.
It has been a very nice expericence, the location is super central and the staff has been very professional and kind.
I love boutique hotels and the Sanderson reflected my expectations.
The room was smaller than I expected (we booked the superior king) but, as at the Morgans in New York, it's a little price to pay to be in such a central position!
The hotel is cold and impersonal ouside while inside, every detail exude design and neatness, it's very cool, most of all the restaurant and the hall, the contrast is such a surprise!
The only negative aspect has been the wi-fi connection, I didn't expect it to be free but at least a little bit cheaper!",4,2012,01,09
132,Querky something different,"Fab hotel with a very good vibe! Plenty of young city types frequent the bar. The room was clean and interestingly the pictures are hung on the ceiling.
Breakfast was excellent, plenty of choice, lovely cakes, omelettes cooked to perfection.  The staff were very attentive.  Definitely worth a visit to experience a hotel with a difference.  Bar prices high but that's London for you!",4,2012,01,04
132,Unique but not perfect,"This was my first stay at any hotels in the Morgan's group but I have stayed in many 'boutique' hotels before. What I usually love about boutique hotels is the way they challenge the norms of the large luxury hotels when it comes to service, amenities and rooms. 

The decor is certainly very cool and modern for London, with lots of Starck touches (eyes painted on the bar seats, plenty of perspex etc) and as mentioned in other reviews, the lift is stunning. The room is small but not uncomfortably so with lots of glass and interesting angles. The inclusion of a pair of freeweights and an exercise chart in the room was cute too (sadly they went unused by me). The restaurant is good - Malaysian street food is the hook, and while the prices certainly didn't reflect the street food concept, the food was great. The little 'VIP and Residents Bar' was quirky though never seemed to be full of either VIPs or residents but perhaps it was the time of year.

Then, unfortunately, they fell into the trap of copying the 5 star annoyances so prevalent in London hotels. Paying for WiFi seems very silly in 2012, but paying per device, so a traveller with laptop, iPhone and tablet needs to cough up 30 pounds per day, means this hotel becomes quite unattractive for a business traveller or tech laden holidaymaker. The excuse given by the front desk was 'it makes it faster', which, while perhaps true, could be managed with some intelligent technical solutions like limiting downloads or offering a premium connection that allowed high bandwidth use.

Other annoyances included the dreaded 15% ""discretionary"" gratuity that seems to be creeping into London establishments, introduced no doubt by transatlantic jealousy of the tipping culture to the detriment of London visitors who are also slugged with 20% VAT. Which is also frustrating - there is no way I can avoid the VAT, so just tell me the room rate including it! Again, not unique to this hotel but frustrating all the same. Finally, many staff seemed disinterested beginning with a doorman upon our arrival with 4 bags who watched us struggle through the glass doors while he finished his phone call. I thought he was a guest and so was most surprised when he asked us to give our names to check bags.

To finish on a positive note, the front desk experience was excellent, patient, helpful and efficient. For 200 pounds a night for a Standard room, it wasn't bad value for money but there are many hotels in London competing at this price point and the Sanderson could do with some creative ideas so that service matches the decor.",3,2012,01,02
132,"Great stay at Sanderson, London",We stayed at Sanderson over Christmas. The room was stunning - contemporary yet really comfortable. But what made our trip was the staff. So friendly and obliging - nothing was too much trouble. We can't wait to go back.,5,2012,01,01
132,High design but takes some getting used to,"First thing to say is that aesthetically you can't fault the Sanderson, the lobby and bar is more art space than reception. I loved the sofas, bar and general opulent feel and felt like I had been transported to the upper eastside than the back of Oxford st. 

The room on the other hand was a little odd... maybe I'm just an old fashioned girl, but I like a clear delineation between the bathroom and bedroom! It's basically separated by a curtain! I was on a romantic trip with my new guy and it killed the romance somewhat knowing that unless you put the TV on loudly, you could hear everything going on! I think if you were with someone you knew very well it wouldn't matter as much. 

Other than that there were the usual extras I'd expect from a hotel of this calibre, and the bed was lovely, large and comfortable. 

I don't think I would stay again purely because of the super-modern layout, but I'll definitely be back for drinks!",4,2011,12,23
132,Suffers from the boutique dilemma,"The bed was comfortable, the design interesting and the staff friendly. But, it falls into the usual boutique dilemma. High on design, low on fit and finish. The room is not what I would describe as comfortable and the oddly lumpy hallway carpet appeared to be cleaned via Fabreeze (actually witness it's application). Which made me wonder how clean the rooms were. The location is great for hanging out in Soho without being in the thick of it and Charlotte Street is close by as well.",3,2011,12,17
132,Faultless,"I recently stayed at the Sanderson in London for the weekend with my partner. We stayed in a Delux King and cannot fault the service. When we arrived, the room wasn't quite ready, but the reception staff were very friendly and most helpful. W were provided with some free drinks in the long bar while we waited - not that we waited long. When we got to the room we weren't disappointed. Absolutely beautiful. The  attention to detail was second to none and the room exuded  a cool and sophisticated sense of pure luxury and indulgence. The bars are slick and stylish and the staff approachable and friendly. On a side note - the lifts are absolutely amazing :) I will definitely be staying there again.",5,2011,12,15
132,not what i thought it was going to be like,"arrival at the sanderson , beautiful nad clean . room small but enough for short stay ( queen bed ) glass toliet walls so no privacy etc ... went for drinks ( long bar closed ? 2-30 pm ) went outside cold but being half cooked by patio heater . people were moving saying too hot from above . ordered 2 snacks , burger / fries club sandwhich fries ( fries cold and tiny serving ) table next to us has twice as many same meal ?  purple room seats tiny and larger ones i sank in it as it it was broken . when i returned to room had bites !!! to rear and legs . also did not have selection of known spirits ? service excellent but with a £400 drinks bill u would think so .

day 2 ,  
breakfast was cold . lunch meal for 8  all fries were cold , and other meals very slightly warm , in a hurry so no time to re cook etc . service v good ... arrived back at hotel 10-20 was told no food as restraunt closes at 10-30 . had meal in purple bar again cold fries and meals only warm . service very good . 

day 3 .
 woken up at 5-30 by VERY NOISY staff collecting meal requests from door , shouting talking and knocked door when passing , VERY ANNOYING . breakfast luke warm , tiny servings .
 

room had been made at eve but bar NOT stocked up or water replaced .

checked out , we gave instructions that we were paying for our 6 quests each guest was given a bill ?  and when we tried to pay again a mix up .

would not return ... shame beautiful hotel , good service but at those prices just not good enough",3,2011,12,14
132,Overall very impressed,"We go to London several times a year and stay at various hotels throughout the city and overall Sanderson may be our present favourite. 
We love the newness, service and perks of The Arch and if you want a quiet new hotel it has the edge; however, this time we wanted to try something with more of a scene. Obviously hotel has competition from the W, but this hotel should be considered as well.
The Long Bar in lobby was always full and lively in the evening and the courtyard space is very nice:. it attracted a younger, good looking crowd but wasn't intimidating or overly pretentious.
The hotel's style is ""minimal, white and a bit sterile"" so very early 2000's but it's not looking overly dated yet as it's well-maintained.
We were in a room with two queen beds and truly it was the largest (around 30 square mtrs) we've had in London. So nice to not be tripping over luggage all the time. Bathroom was large with lots of space for storage - only small complaint is there's very little shelf space in shower (one 4 "" circular shelf). Bathroom has no door and is separated by glass wall but you can make it more private by closing curtain wall.
One very impressive thing was the price of room service. It can be pricey everywhere - particularly London - but we ended up having it a few times and service, price and quality were all good. Thai green chicken curry was around 13 pounds plus the high delivery, gratuities...
Only other negative is wi-fi was at additional cost but at least it worked fairly well.
So if you still like this style/design of hotel and you can get a reasonable rate, the hotel is great. Location, of course, is amazing. If we can get room for around same rate (305 pounds plus VAT), we'd stay here again. 
Again remember that i had room with two queen beds which is probably quite a bit larger than standard rooms.",4,2011,12,06
132,INCREDIBLE,"Incredible place, great design!!
sanderson is just in the heart of London, a fabulous hotel where you can spend there inside all your time and you'll never get bored about this place, starting from breakfast, then launch, then aperitif, then dinner, then after dinner!!!
Purple bar it's just amazing and it can happen to seat near famous star!!
When in London I'll stay att Sanderson forever!!",5,2011,12,02
132,The complete hotel experience!,"Fantastically located for the West End and Soho this hotel really does have it all. The rooms are incredible, amazing beds & lush bathrooms. The staff were brilliant and nothing was too much. Loved the bars and would highly recommend the very unique afternoon tea experience. Definitely something different on the London afternoon tea scene! A must for a London treat! I will be back!",5,2011,12,01
132,Out of this world!,"I'm a girl that's hard to please, but the Sanderson exceeded all my expectations!! What an amazing one-off experience..truly a unique gem in central London. Where to start? The quirky pieces randomly peppering the Reception area, the drama of long bar, the dreamy spa, the intimate decadence of the purple room, the lush courtyard (I could go on..!!) 
I loved the wit of the decor..the constant surprises..even taking the 'galaxy' lift is an experience! The 'Loft' room was extremely comfortable and well proportioned and I thought the privacy of the layered curtains to the wet room was a really cool idea :-) The staff throughout were charming and proficient and the atmosphere was chilled yet there was a real energy/buzz to the public areas of the hotel. I didn't manage to sample the Malaysian food in the Suka restaurant, but the smells were intoxicating! 
Sublime. I'll can't wait to come back. Thank you!
Gabby",5,2011,11,25
132,BEST hotel in London!,I stayed here 10 years ago and just went back for the first time last week ... Still the COOLEST hotel in London!  The concierge was very helpful and the door men are the nicest and most helpful I've ever experienced.  My room was ready early which was very nice of them and the 2 bottles of complimentary water made such a difference.  The restaurant was VERY good and the service was even better!  The management team runs around and makes everyone feel welcome and important (get that noodle dish!) ... I wish other restaurants could be this welcoming and inviting ... I want the Purple Bar to be my bed room!  Beautiful!  Oh -- And Alex the bar tender in the Purple Bar was AMAZING and so friendly! I would come back just for him ... He made sure we were having a great night! I miss you already Sanderson!,5,2011,11,22
132,Amazing hotel!!,"The Sanderson Hotel is my absolute favorite hotel in london.  The atmosphere is comfortable yet chic and it is an excellent place for relaxing at the bar and enjoying conversation or just people watching.  The rooms are beautiful, clean and so comfortable.  The staff are excellent and accomodating.  Stay there if can, you will not be sorry!!",5,2011,11,21
132,Very nice property,"I've just returned from a week-end at the Sanderson Hotel in London. We really liked this property. Our room was great and the Long Bar and Purple Bar are wonderful places.

I would just point out that their wifi Internet seems to be unreliable. It, sometimes, is so slow that it's unusable.

This was our first stay in a Morgans Hotel since I received their Global Card and I was disappointed that the only perk I received was complimentary Internet. I was denied a 3:30pm late checkout when their booking engine showed that our room wasn't booked for the night (contrary to what the front desk staff told us).

No upgrade either although at least one higher category room was available on their booking engine when we checked in (once again we were told that the hotel was fully booked so they couldn't upgrade us).

Concierge was great for restaurant reservations and car transfer bookings.",4,2011,11,14
132,WOW....its just a work of art,"Not only was the staff quick and marvelous...but seriously knowledgeable...I pride myself on knowing non-ordinary happenings and quizing the staff on them...They were current and knew prices and hours of all ""attractions"" that i might want....we were in a deluxe suite --fab!!!!
Its location is on a quite street walking distance to major shopping areas.. Cliental are upscale and reserved...food is amazing and you have a choice of many restaurants locally.
we met Bruno Mars in the lobby who stopped to take pictures with us.
MUST STAY if you are in london.",5,2011,11,11
132,"Great hotel, very different, but not for everyone","I don't think I have ever seen so many net curtains and glass walls in one place. However, we had a fairly big room (I think Deluxe King but I'm not sure) and it was very pleasant. On the first night we stayed there we had a few drinks in the outside bar. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was very relaxed.

It's definitely not like most hotels in terms of decor. As I said the rooms are different and the lifts are very funky. 

My only comment is that it's a hotel that attracts young people and I doubt a person who enjoys a Westin or a Grand Hyatt would necessarily like the place.

However, all in all it's very good.",4,2011,11,07
132,Home away from home,"I just spent the last two weeks at the Sanderson hotel in London on a business trip....it felt like ""Home away from Home"".  Great location in the heart of London, near to shops, restaurants and my UK office was just a 5 minute walk away.  Professional staff and a hidden gem of a restaurant with a recently revamped menu.  My room was spacious with a tub and shower and I had a functioning work desk.  After work it was good to relax at the ""Long Bar"" or in the ""Purple Room"" as both bars had a lively upbeat vibe.

I've stayed at the W Hotel in Leicester Square and even the St. Martins hotel in London....the Sanderson hotel tops them all.

This is my ideal location to stay while I'm in London.  I'll be back early in the new year.",5,2011,11,02
132,Amazing experience,"Our stay at the Sanderson Hotel was an amazing experience from start to finish. From the attentive staff, the quality of the rooms and the atmosphere of both bars and restaurant. Top drawer and we will be definitely be staying again.

Richard",5,2011,11,01
132,Pure Class,"Have visited this hotel many times during visits to London.

The hotel is a master piece of modern, chic, class....Have stayed in many of the desingners other hotels also...All are excellent.

The location of the Hotel is perfect for central london...Of course its not cheap but who cares, if you can afford to splash out on a bit of down town Luxury I would spend it here.....",5,2011,10,29
132,Long Way to Travel for a below average Meal,"We visited the Sanderson Hotel last week having seen the Suka restaurant on Master Chef. However the Nasi Goreng was the worst I have ever tasted boring and bland.  The first bottle of wine was so bad we asked for it to be changed for another. Not really the experience you wish for when having travelled from the Wirral on the pretext that the meal would be superb.
The staff were very attentive so no complaint there what surprised us was the restaurant was empty except for two tables...Maybe this should have been our early warning sigh that the food is over priced and poor quality.",3,2011,10,15
132,Love this hotel!,"This is the second time I stayed here with my boyfriend, for a long weekend in London. You cannot go wrong with this hotel. It is in a great location, close to areas of great shopping and eating, and close to the tube. (Must go to Yauatcha for dim sum- its only a 7-10 minute walk from the hotel). The rooms are a bit small, but they do the job. If you like modern, minimalist feeling, then you will enjoy, not for someone who likes a classic hotel (e.g., four seasons, mandarin oriental). Also, the bathroom is only separated by a curtain, in need of a real door.

The other good thing, is the bar is always packed and has a relatively fashionable and hot crowd, so good for people watching. The drinks are fabulous!. Also, as hotel guests you have access to a smaller bar called the Purple room, which is dark and romantic and great for an after dinner drink.

As for the concierge, they are super attentive, polite, and give great recommendations. (if only it were this way in the US). They recommended a play (Ghost) and purchased tickets for us, which was great! Thank you!",4,2011,10,11
132,Nice very NICE,"was in london with work this week and had the privalage to stay here 

well what more can i say great location and great for shopping",4,2011,10,03
132,"Friendly staff, lovely rooms, overall excellent","Having stayed at the hotel 3 times over the past year in a number of different rooms I can say this hotel is my favourite hotel in London. Very central location, nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff and we were greeted with a smile everytime we entered the hotel.

Will certainly be staying here again on our next visit to London.",5,2011,10,03
132,"A great Morgans Hotel, just a little pricey","My business partner and I stayed here during a business trip to London. We stay at Morgans Hotels often and are Tablet Hotel members, which brings its own set of perks. We got upgraded to better rooms for our stay, which was awesome.

Pros:
- Arty, funky design and décor. I had framed artwork above the bed on the ceiling in my room - I appreciate fun touches like that.

- My room was huge (thanks to being upgraded) and it had a treadmill (and small free-weights) in it! Too bad I didn't use the workout equipment.

- Nice big bathroom with a proper shower (ie. walk-in, with a door) and Korres amenities which I love.

- Great service from hotel staff - everybody from front desk to bellmen. Cam the concierge was sweet and extremely helpful with reservations, flight check-ins, and pretty much anything else we needed. 

- The hotel provides a car service during the evenings, since taxis may be hard to come by on Berners Street at night.

- The restaurant has great breakfasts and good service. We had fabulous cocktails at the Purple and Long bars -- which were quite the happening scenes on the evenings we were there.

- Wi-fi and continental breakfast was included with our King rooms.

Cons:

- Very few cons for the Sanderson. The first is that it is a little pricey -- that is to be expected for a Morgans Hotel, especially in London, but with the US dollar low, £25 per person for breakfast and £12 cocktails just hurts.

- While the car service provided by the hotel is an excellent idea, in some cases it just might not be worth it. We were charged a flat rate of £15 to take us to Covent Garden -- which we later discovered was a £6 cab ride. Also, the driver had a very hard time understanding us (the address/destination was NOT complicated) and this made for a very frustrating ride.

- I had a great big king-size bed, but the mattress was hard and uncomfortable, and the pillows were too soft and unsupportive.",5,2011,09,30
132,Coolest Hotel in London,"everything about this hotel tells me im young, im cool and im sexy !",5,2011,09,22
132,Mutton dressed as Lamb,"Perhaps we should have realised our stay would be less than ideal after standing in front of reception for more than ten minutes, and being ignored simply because we were young adults. Though we were upgraded (albeit to a smoking room, which I wasn't pleased about), the stay continued to be less than ideal for our needs. Room service was average, and certainly overpriced (even more so than the average hotel room in London). My boyfriend's gripe was that upon coming back late at night, there was security outside the doors granting entry to the bar. They let us in easily upon learning we were guests, but it was incredibly intimidating and not all pleasant.
Considering me and my boyfriend are aged 21 and 24, I wouldn't say we're too old for the Sanderson... But we certainly felt too mature. Considering the price, and my experience of other London hotels, I can't recommend this one.",3,2011,09,13
132,"Terribly mediocre, at these prices just terrible","The hotel was once cool, but the design and decor has become very dated. The cool people have left the building and the only people we saw in the hotel as either guests or coming to the restaurant or bar can, to borrow a New York City term, as bridge and tunnel. The food at the restaurant Suka is ok, but at that price, it borders on highway robbery. The room service food is absolutely atrocious, again at ridiculously high prices. TV, entertainment system in the rooms are a total joke. The paint on the furniture is chipped, the lustre is gone. The hotel is in need of a serious revamp. 
Do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else...",2,2011,09,12
132,Glass house,"This hotel surprised me.  It was my first trip to London and I wanted to go first rate.  The lobby looks fun and bar is always hopping in the evenings.

As you move to the elevator and go upstairs, you enter a black galaxy like elevator.  You get to your floor and exit into a dark creepy hallway painted purple with creaky wood planks under the carpet (5th floor).  

Upon entering your room, you will be engulfed with white lacy curtains everywhere and glass bathroom.  Yes, glass bathroom.  I can see shower and sink from bed.  The floor creeks as you move about room.  The view will take your breath away as you stare into the office building workers across the way.  But, never fear, you don't have to do that long because you have about 10 channels to watch on tv.... 8 of them news.

The bed is comfy if you like firm mattresses.

Location is off the beaten path if you are touring.  However, I was able to walk to almost all the locations I wanted if you don't mind sweating.",3,2011,09,03
132,"Scratch beneath the surface, there are lots of cracks","What a beautiful hotel. Wonderful design, trendy and cool. Everything it says on the label (website) is accurate and true except:

1. The rates quoted on their site (until you get to the final page) are EXCLUDING VAT. (Tax). This is contrary to HM Revenue and Customs VAT regulations unless the business concerned does NOT sell to the public. VAT is 20%, So a £255 room becomes over £300.

2. We ordered 1 breakfast, we were delivered 2. We got 1 deducted from the bill. The form is quite clearly designed to facilitate this error.

3. 1 small complimentary plastic bottle of water in the room is paltry.

4. A full English breakfast at £25 is ridiculous.

5, Charging Internet in any hotel, let alone this one is also ridiculous

Apart from that it was great, ha ha. Try the Covent Garden hotel or any of the Firmdales or for a great classy bargain Zetters.",3,2011,09,03
132,Fur Coat and No Knickers,"Undoubtedly a cool hotel with minimalistic design and some great little details, but scratch the surface and there isn't much there.  Hotel service is woefully lacking, the basic rooms are very small and the minimalistic feel soon starts to look cheap and in some areas tatty and impractical.  We were put in the wrong room grade to start with and unpacked before we realised, we then asked to move so had to pack up and unpack all over again.   They gave us an upgrade (no cost to them) and a bottle of the cheapest house red wine they could find - PATHETIC.  We asked them to change this to a 'decent' white and again, got the cheapest house white which we waited over 2 hours for after chasing 5 times!!!  Very, very poor and insulting.  We ordered some room service which came cold and the cost for this was a £3.50 tray charge and a whopping 18% service charge!  Anyone who pays this has more money than sense and is a total idiot in my opinion.  They aslo have the funniest line in there guest book I have ever read - 'for your convenience a 10% service charge is added to all spa treatments', well thank you very much, that is very convenient!!  Why don't they just charge 10% more and pay the staff a better wage.  At breakfast they brought my porridge at the same time as my omlette and there is also a kick back scam with some mini cabs outside.  A kit kat from the mini bar is £3.50, are you serious, they are 60p!  I'm not short of money, but the Sanderson is taking the pee with some of their charges and I'm afraid just isn't good enough to get away with it

I have listed the hotel as 'ppor' due to the cost in relation to the experience, on it's own it was good, but at £500 a night it aint all that!!",2,2011,08,27
132,"Very friendly staff, cool lobby but impractical room","Stayed there in July for one night.  cannot fault the check in desk, door staff and concierge, all very friendly.  Location fantastic too as it is 30 sec off Oxford street.  Room is a bit of let down, stayed in the deluxe king room, the room is big and bright, all white and  minimaliste, but impractical.  Bad points, takes ages to close the electrical pink curtain to shut off the bathroom area, 4 windows with double blind, so takes good few mins to turn the blind and the black-out blind down.  its a new hotel but the paint work is already scruffy in the room.   good point, big room, big bathroom, really comfy bed, quiet.  on the whole £325 a night, its not bad.",4,2011,08,19
132,Fantastic Location but a but pricey,"I stayed here when traveling to London for work.  The location is fantastic, right off of Oxford street. Minutes from the tube, shopping, and dining.  I have stayed at Morgans properties before and I was pleasantly surprised to be ""welcomed back"" even though this was my first visit to this property. There was even a small welcome present of chocolate covered strawberries waiting for me in my room, a nice treat after a long day of travel. The room was clean and spacious. The staff friendly and attentive. The only downside is it's a bit pricey.  ",5,2011,08,19
132,great hotel very nic dsign,"I stayed in this hotel, the bar is great, nice outside patio and great restaurant. Rooms are very small but well designed. Good location.
I live in London but stayed in this hotel due to a business commitment.",4,2011,08,12
132,"Great Location, Hip Hotel, Sterile Rooms, Generally average","Before I start I might as well point out that I am still staying at Sanderson as I type. Been to the hotel a few times for drinks and dinner and fell in love with the bar scene and nightlife and the quirky lobby. Hence I decided to book a 4 night stay on a trip to London (live abroad now) and I am no longer in awe of the Hotel after this stay. Don't get me wrong the lobby and bar/restaurant area is still fab and perhaps I have been a little spoilt by staying at the W in Leicester Square for my first 2 nights (amazing hip fabulous W hotel by the way). The rooms at Sanderson are a bit void of personality; sterile and clinical - feels like a different world compared to the funkiness of the lobby! They are clean and white - very simple. Some people will like it but the room at the W was more up my street. Even the doors in the rooms are too hard to open Room service is fast when you're paying but the minute you ask for simple things like a kettle, an iron, tea, missing tea spoons it takes forever! When the kettle finally arrives it has limescale on it causing my tea to taste of limescale all week. After paying £10 a day for the internet we were told that we could only use one device at a time - meaning that my partner and I couldn't be on the Internet at the same time with 2 different devices - first time I've ever experienced that in a hotel. All in all the Sanderson is a hip hotel literally 2mins walk from Oxford Circus, fun to visit but when you dig deeper it leaves much to be desired. Glad I stayed but would probably try somewhere else another time.",3,2011,08,09
132,LOVED it! What a fun place!!!,"Great hotel with amazing staff and funky rooms and decor. 
Initially I was surprised by the staff calling me by my first name, however they were definitely the most attentive staff in any London hotel I have stayed in. Inparticularly, the young Swedish chap on the door who went out of his way with carrying my bags, opening doors, and running up the street to find me a taxi!
Rooms are great, although if you are not wanting to share your bathroom experience with your partner, these rooms may not be for you! The ceiling art work made me giggle ;)
Breakfast pricey but very good. Malaysian evening meal was exquisite.
All in all, a great hotel, full of trendy young things.
LOVED IT!!!",5,2011,08,03
132,Trying to be cool but lacks class,"Tried this hotel as the usual hotels i stay in Ldn had been booked up. I travel to ldn 4x a year on average so I feel i can make good comparison. When i walked in the front door i thought i was going be blown away, it looked chic, the check-in was great but faults soon appeared.

The room is like a neon-lighbulb and a tad overdone, eveything bright white, so make sure no light gets into the room when you are sleeping! they also were not spacious at all,  compared to hotels like Claridges, Mandarin or the Berkeley. Its trying to be quirky, and cool but think its fails badly. 

On any given night, its almost impossible to get to the bar to enjoy a drink - look its great that the bar has a vibe, but guests are not given any preferrential treatment at all, which did suprise me. Cherry on the top was the doorman not letting me back in the hotel at 10pm one night bc the bar was to full, until I threw my toys, and a manager came and profusely apologised for the doorman misunderstanding thinking i wasn't a guest..... hmmm

Location was fine, easy to get to the city, and kings road for business. Food was ok but not great. 

I just don;t think this hotel lived up to the standard i would expect of a 5* hotel in LDN. Maybe I have been lucky in my choices up till now, but something really seemed to be lacking.",2,2011,07,30
132,"Posh, but not all that practical","The lobby and bar is by far the best thing about this hotel. Very posh and fun.  The staff were very helpful as to restaurant recommendations.  On the downside, the rooms are simply not practical.  The flowing curtains are nice but offer no privacy if others in the room.  There is no outlet by the sink. Still the biggest concern is the complete lack of sound proofing.  We could hear everything - and I mean everything - the couple next door were doing at night.  There was a party down the hall, which I recognize is not the hotel's fault, but I also shouldn't be able to hear it quite so clearly.  When told the next morning about the extreme noise I was offered an ""I'm so sorry"" but nothing else. 
Can't say I will be back unless I'm prepared to be the one hosting the party til the wee hours.",3,2011,07,27
132,Still the coolest Hotel in London!,"Stayed at the Sanderson Hotel in London for a couple of nights with my Partner and had a wonderful experience. Have stayed there before a couple of years ago and have to say that it hasn't changed a bit: it is still a hip, cool and warm Hotel full of good looking staff who tend to go beyong their duty to make your stay awesome.
We arrived quite early in the morning after a long flight and as our room wasn't ready we got to spend a few hours in their superb Spa.
The bedroom was spotless with their super comfy beds and great sheets. The Bar and Restaurant serving delicious food and yummy cocktails, too yummy which makes you tend to have a couple too many... anyway!!!
You never fail by staying there, still the great Sanderson Hotel.",5,2011,07,27
132,Very Quirky......,"All a bit surreal, but in a good way....
Staff were at all times excellent, room was a good size, and very comfortable.....
Breakfast was excellent, only a little over priced.",4,2011,07,27
132,Amazing room and great staff,"I used this hotel as the place to propose to my girlfirend. I wanted it to be a suprise and the hotel and the staff were extremely helpful in making this happen, helping me preplan and prepare the room.

The hotel is an amazing venue that has great rooms and facilities that make this a wonderful place to visit as a couple. It has a great location too which means you have a short walk to soho for nightlife and oxford street for shopping.",5,2011,07,20
132,Would stay again!,"A fantastic hotel in the middle of everything, fantastic service, everyone seemed to be so helpful. Have recommended to all my friends and recommend you stay too. 
The quirky little features like landscape painting on my roof (complete with frame) right above my bed was very unique - I liked it a lot! Would stay again when next in London.",5,2011,07,18
132,CAN'T FAULT IT,This hotel is simply the best - it's faultless....would go back again and again,5,2011,07,08
132,Best hotel in London,"I travel to London several times a year for work and recently decided to try a new hotel.  The Sanderson lives up to everything it promises.  The second you get out of the cab you are greeted by stylish, attractive and extremly friendly staff.  The hotel lobby and rooms are in impecable condition.  The restaurant and room service menus are incredible.  The spa is breathtaking.  

The best part of the hotel is the guest only Purple Bar...which is absoulty stunning.  You will be absolutly amazed watching the mixologists make your cocktails.  One mixologist in particular Victor was incredible, he was extremly knowledgeable, friendly and talented.  I tried several drinks on the menu and they were the best cocktails I have ever tasted.  

You will not be dissapointed if you stay at this hotel.",5,2011,07,05
132,Best hotel in London,I have been staying at the Sanderson regularly for the last six years. The staff have become almost like family and look after me and members of my family whenever we are in London for business or pleasure. Nothing is ever too much trouble. The housekeeping and room service staff are always prompt and polite. The doormen led by the loyal and courteous Phil are the best bunch of guys I have met at any hotel in the world. Mike and his concierge team are legendary and the lovely Marcela in charge of guest relations is superb. No review would be complete without also mentioning Ian Telford as the backbone of the Sanderson and it's status as truly the best hotel in London. My only negative comment is that I miss the old Spoon by Alain Ducasse as a really classy restaurant and the garden benches which made dining in the garden very special. Maybe one day ......,5,2011,06,30
132,Five star service and unique amenities,Staying here was quite a treat. The boutique decor is upscale with amusing detail. I forgot my power converter and the staff were kind enough to courier it back to the States at no charge. Breakfast is delicious (although pricey). Bartenders serve up yummy original cocktails.,5,2011,06,25
132,Always a pleasure and an attentive staff,"I have been staying at this hotel for business a couple of times over the last few years, and have always been extremely satisfied with the staff, the surroundings and the general vibe of the hotel. The rooms are really nice, definitely try the gym of you have time! The concierge has some great tips about where to eat, and we have not been disappointed once.
At the weekend the bar in the lobby/terrace can get very lively, so I usually try to get a room that is not facing the courtyard! I I think it's great both for business and personal travel!",4,2011,06,24
132,perfect location - perfect design,"i can only recommend this hotel. me and my boyfriend stayed for three nights in a standard room on the 4th floor. the room was surprisingly spacious and the interiour design is stunning. the staff was very friendly and helpful and the room was very clean. the room service was perfect and i was surprised how quiet the room was although it was located near the elevator. the infamous long bar was always crowded but the people visiting are one of a kind - if you want to join the hip crowd, go somewhere else and save some money. the sanderson is defintely the pergect choice if you are looking for extravagant interiour design and a hotel in a good location. oxford circus is just around the corner... what else can a shopaholic ask for?",5,2011,06,23
132,Fantastic place - it's home,"If you are an international traveller who likes a cool place to stay, hanging out with people like yourself, with great non-intrusive thoughtful service - then this is the place for you. Very cool place - the food is great, the rooms are quiet, it has beds you can actually sleep soundly in (important if you sleep in 4 - 5 different beds a week). The bar scene is great too - fantastic people watching, ad a great cocktail selection. Thoroughly recommended!",5,2011,06,20
132,Style over service,"Service was poor, bars closed earlier than advertised. Beware of cabs, silver mercedes are lined up outside and they are twice the price of a black cab without ""the knowledge""!!! Poor that a quality hotel would allow it. Overall we like the hotel, lifts are very cool, purple bar is lovely.",3,2011,06,19
132,Always outstanding,This is our 3rd time at the Sanderson and once again everything was fantastic. The staff recognised our return which is always nice. The room was fantastic as always we normally always have a loft suite but this time we went with a deluxe double it was not as big but had everything you could need. We also had chance to sample the Agua Spa. My wife had the hot stone massage which she said was amazing. I had a de stress which was very good. The whole experience is exceptional and the staff were very good. The bars as always are great fun and have a buzz you don't get at many places. Breakfast was not as good as normal but was still excellent. All the staff were friendly and helpful. I could not recommend this hotel more it has that WOW factor which is what makes it special. I can not wait till my next visit.,5,2011,06,16
132,Where sexy & professional staff treat you like family,"3 amigos and I flew to London to attend the champions league soccer final at wembley stadium. Since we're big fans of the skybar at the mondrian back in LA we decided to give the sanderson a try. OMG what a hotel! Sexy and professional staff rocking from the door to the reception to the bar to the spa to every corner of this Hotel with capital H. The darling-love-darling concierge hooked us up with a mercedes limo to the stadium, Stan the man made culinary outings memorable and the maids were phenomenal. They always came when we were out. How do they do that? How do they know? We will definitely be back. Keep it up Sanderson!",5,2011,06,16
132,"Review of Agua Spa, Sanderson Hotel","I didn't stay at the hotel, but frequently have spa treatments at the uber-luxe Agua Spa in the Sanderson.  The spa is amazing, not only for its design and architectural interest. but also for the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff.  I would highly rate every service that I've enjoyed there - manicure, pedicure, massage and holiday-type treatments (lash & brow tint, etc).  

The must-have treatment that keeps me coming back for more is the Eve Lom Experience, a world-class 90-minute facial that truly rejuvinates body & soul.  This session is a wonderful treat.  Try it.  You will not be disappointed with the products, the staff and the relaxing environment.  There is no queuing, nor any feel of an 'assembly-line'.  Everything feels very personalized.  Enjoy!",5,2011,06,15
132,Was absolutely delighted to stay at this beautiful hotel,"The Sanderson exceeded my expectations from the moment we arrived all the staff were friendly helpful and courteous .The room was fantastic very clean and fresh
The style was funky chic.
I loved drinks at the water bar each afternoon.the spa offers amazing treatments and staff at the spa are true professionals.
The duty manager and front desk staff were very friendly and helpful.
The livery gents on  guest service 
There were two different men and both of them bent over backwards to help me book the best events and restaurants.These guys made a 5 star hotel feel like a six star experience .
I will definitely stay here on my next trip.We had room 327 on the third floor nice and large
Great room",5,2011,06,14
132,Great Stay but a bit noisy!,"Had a wonderful time at the Sanderson, staff very helpful and whole hotel very cool. Only negative is that the hotel is a times a bit manic, not it terms of staff but the general volume of people passing through at night, not very relaxing!

Overall very good!",4,2011,06,14
132,good service on offering research enquire,"Sanderson is really cool hotel on design and other services. They give me professional information on academic research on time. Definitely, it is top branding service standard.",5,2011,06,09
132,A wonderful cool atmosphere!,"You'll be enthusiastic of the cool atmosphere of the lounge!
All the services are excellent and rooms' design is really made for living in a great luxury.
You can also enjoy Suka restaurant, an exciting Malaysian food experience.
Overall, Sanderson hotel is really a few steps from Oxford Street, Oxford Circus, Soho....and so your staying in Sanderson will be like feel at your wonderful home.",5,2011,06,08
132,"TRENDY, STYLISH, ELEGANT, WONDERFUL LOCATION, BEST BAR","Great hotel very stylish, trendy and modern. The staff is very friendly and professional. The rooms are modern,very clean and full of light . I had a kindsize bed with pampering duvet. The bar in the lobby is the greatest, very busy starting 5 pm with gorgeous guys and gals. Looks like a teriffic place to meet people.
The location is very central, you can walk to a lot of places. The Concierge is very knowledgeable and will gvie you good advise regarding theater tickets, restaurants and places to visit plus directions and a map.
I did not go to the spa but it looks like a place where you can get professional treatments and really pamper yourself.
THIS IS MY HOTEL WHEN IN LONDON!!!!",5,2011,06,07
132,"It's an "" I always stay there place"" ......","I have nothing but admiration for the Sanderson, Agua and all its staff .
I have been a guest at the Sanderson on many many occasions,for me it works so well
The Lobby area and reception staff are amazing always pleased to see you agin and fall over themselves to help without being in your face ,
The bar is cool, during the day its not too busy which is good as you can meet up and at least hear one another with an outside patio area as well,the night time different vibe very busy very bustling.
 The spa is good for when you need to relax ,massages and steam room are excellent .
The rooms are clean and spacious,well looked after and still looking good .
A well worth while stay if your in that part of town",5,2011,06,07
132,Wonderful experience from start to end,"We were 'WOWED' by the fantastic service we received during our recent stay at Sanderson, by far it is the best hotel we have stayed at in London. Special mention must go to Michael the Senior Concierge whose manner and style should be bottled - he took time to find the most enjoyable events and sites for my teenage children and made us so welcome when we returned. The hotel is trendy, smart, immaculate and the service could not be improved....it made our break to London truly memorable.",5,2011,06,06
132,"Great Rooms, Attentive and Professioal Staff -- Killer Bar, Spa and Vibe","I can't say enough good things about this hotel -- I've stayed at more than 10 hotels i London over the last year, all 5-star, and I've become attached to Sanderson.  Some hotels are ""too cool"" for their own good and lose the personal touch or are arrogant - not Sanderson.  Everyone one of the staff was incredibly professional, genuine, inuitive about needs/desires, very responsive to any request, the conceirge is ""connected"" and can get reservations at difficult tables - it's truly a delight to stay in a hotel where little things, as well as big things are 100% attended to.  No stress, no hassles -- everything was smooth and carefree.  It's modern, but not cold or institutional.  It's hip/cool, but not arrogant.  And all services, even room service and laundry -- are truly 5-star and exceptional!  The bar is particularly active on certain nights, and the pool table off the lobby is a terrific place to chill.  As a very, very picky traveler who prefers only the best - I really like the relaxed, yet sophisticated vibe of Sanderson.",5,2011,06,04
132,Funky!,"Stayed here on a buisness trip (thursday evening). The staff were fantastic, good size room and very clean. 
I ate in Suka (Malaysian cuisine) which was an enjoyable experience and I would recommend. The Long bar after dinner is always buzzing with slickers in suits letting of steam, media professionals of the Soho/Fitzrovia area and fashionable youngsters looking for a good time.

If you like contemporary, lively and you don't want an early night then this place is for you.",5,2011,06,03
132,"Fabulous & trendy hotel, but warm and friendly!","I was lucky enough to have a 1 night stay recently at The Sanderson - alas it was on business, so I didn't have near enough time to really soak it up!
What a fabulous hotel though - the staff are really warm & friendly, particularly in the reception / concierge, as well as the meeting / banquet staff. 
The rooms are huge & spacious which is so welcomed in central London. The cool, white crispness of the accommodation rooms are beautiful - it was so nice to stay in a hotel in London where it wasn't 'traditionally British or European' in decor!
The only small negative to my stay was the staff in Long Bar - later in the evening, they seemed to get flustered when it was busy and it wasn't amazing service - but the cocktail I had - 'Honey Passion' made up for it!
I will definitely be back & will be telling everyone to stay there should the opportunity come up :-)",5,2011,06,03
132,Best Hotel in the World,"I stay at the Sanderon Hotel for work six times a year and I look forward to arriving every time.  The hotel is spacious by all standards (not just European), immaculate, and the service is better than any hotel I have ever stayed at in the world.  I am greeted by a member of the door staff even if I arrive at 5am and if you let the front desk know ahead of time that you are arriving early from overseas, they will honestly do their best to give you a room.  In the very rare event a room is unavailable at 7am, they have private lounge areas in their spa where you can sleep.  
The hotel bar is always a fun scene and the restaurant has innovative and high quality food.  The concierge team is well known and if they can't get you in to all the hottest top spots in London, then no one can.
The manager, Kris Rajski, and night manager, Stewart Thurlow, ensure that all their guests are well looked after and will do whatever it takes to go the extra mile.",5,2011,06,02
132,Great Service - I'll be back,"I've been staying @ the Sanderson for the past 10 years.Everyone @ your hotel gives the best service. Marcela Almedia personaly takes care of my reservations. Phil is one of the best bellman, he always makes sure im well taken care of.. Mike also does a great job ensuring my dinner reservations and any other needs I may have are also taken care of..
We're going to miss Ian, he has also been a good friend... I would'nt ever consider staying @ another hotel in London. The sanderson is my home away from Home..
Thanks again Steven Oshatz",4,2011,05,31
132,Consistent Quality and Enjoyment,"Having been to London from the U.S. on business in excess of 100 times over the course of the past 20+ years, I have had the opportunity to stay in many of London's top hotels.  For the past several years I have stayed at the Sanderson on a regular basis.  The rooms are very nice and comfortable, the management is first-rate, the dining is superb, and the enjoyable atmosphere of the hotel provides a nice balance whether one is traveling for business or for pleasure.",5,2011,05,30
132,A true Oasis in the dessert of London!,"When I'm in London for Business or Pleasure then its only a matter of time before I just need to get a way from the traffic, the tube and the people! The Sanderson is like an Oasis - cool & clean in the reception, in the bar (inside or out) and most definatley in the guest room.  Its a true ""breath of fresh air"" and my absolute ""go to"" hotel - plus its located a short walk ot tube ride to anywhere I would want to be.",5,2011,05,30
132,only place to stay,"I travel to London 4 times a year and have been staying at the Sanderson from the day they opened there doors in 2000. I am greeted upon my arrive with a smile and my favorite room waiting for me. 
The staff is Incredible from the minute you walk in the doors until you leave. They are friendly and know all the right places to go to.  The rooms are clean and bright.  There is nothing better than the Sanderson",5,2011,05,28
132,Great Bar. Beautiful Spa. And the Rest.,"While I did not stay in the hotel I had the opportunity to have a tour as well as eat/ drink in the bar. I look forward to the opportunity to stay at the Sanderson during my next visit to London. I'm a bathroom guy - I especially liked that the bathroom was open and part of the room (separated by a translucent/ sheer curtain). Plenty of space (in the room I looked at) and very tranquil. Despite the large cathredral ceilings in the spa area the space felt very inviting - long curtains hanging from the cieling it's quite breathtaking. There is a general lack of warmth in the spaces I saw - very open, modern, cool color tones, but it's made up by their design and of course the people. The bar served great food and drinks - try the Chorizo!!",4,2011,05,27
132,Nothing was too much hassle for the Sanderson Team,"We hired The Sanderson's Agua Sap for a Press Event in May 2011.  From start to finish the team bent over backwards to accomodate what we needed.  

They were able to cope with any last minute changes even up until the day itself, ensuring our day ran without a hitch.

The food was second to none, staff pleasant and cheerful and the overall feel of our event was just as we required.  We will be back.",5,2011,05,25
132,Loud at night and annoying room features - hip factor not worth the price,"Stayed 3 nights on the third floor.  It's an old building they have done over with a whitewash of cool colors and whites.  The room was noisy with the noise originating from the hallway, not outside.  Room was inconvenient in several ways, like the only outlet for a hair dryer was so low to the floor you couldn't stand in front of the mirror, had to crouch.  There were gauzy curtains instead of interior walls that were constantly getting caught in the shower door, toilet room door etc.  Desk space was so small you couldn't sit in the chair.  Only about 10 channels of TV, the front desk staff either called our room or put a call through in error a few times, waking us early in the am or late at night with one ring.  The bar is very cool, the concierge services are top notch, they accommodated our request to check in early after an all-night flight, but overall we were not comfortable or relaxed during our stay.",3,2011,05,23
132,The Most Amazing Place in the Whole World!,"StayEd at the Sanderson during the weekend and it was one of the best amazing experience I've ever had in my life! 

Kris.",5,2011,05,22
132,Awesome!,"We booked the loft with balcony, and we loved every minute. We booked the earlybird 30% special which made the tarriff acceptable (that + the great AUD exchange rate!). The room was spacious and modern, and the balcony is fantastic to use when entertaining friends or family (though: wouldn't want more than 4 guests as it gets crowded).
Awesome property in a good location: close to everything. My recommendation is to skip the hotel breakfast (fairly expensive at 25 GBP) and try one of the cafes that you can find in the surrounding streets - there are some good ones around.
Only problem was the privacy of the room during business hours: there are office blocks across the road and the top level of the office building can see into the room if the curtains are open - not the biggest issue, but it pays to be aware. We were also overcharged a decent pennny too when we reviewed our credit card statement, so this is something we are currently discussing with the property.
Overall - a top hotel and we are more than satisfied!",5,2011,05,20
132,I loved it!,"Having stayed at a few of the Morgans Hotel Group's other properties, I knew what I was in for.  Comfortable beds, luxuriously appointed rooms, great service and a stellar in-house restaurant were my expectations and I must say I was not disappointed.  The staff are super friendly and even with the ins-&-outs of a hip London hotel, security was never an issue.  Slept soundly on an extremely welcoming bed and had a GREAT club sandwich and dessert via room service.  It may not be to everyone's taste but for me, I dug it.  If you want a great place to stay in the West End and need a little more than what the local bargain motel has to offer, give it a shot.  Miles ahead!",5,2011,05,20
132,a truly special treat...,"I took my boyfriend to London for his birthday and chose to stay in the Sanderson hotel. We love funky/creative design and this sounded like the perfect fit. We loved the design from the minute you walk through the front door. Upon check-in, we were upgraded to a larger room when we mentioned this was for a special birthday. We also found a bottle of wine and cupcakes in the room that evening. I think it's those little touches that justify the price tag. The design in the room is impressive, maybe not the most comfortable or plush but it's what makes the experience.",4,2011,05,16
132,"Incredible service, amazing hotel in best location.","We recently stayed for 7 nights in this hotel. We arrived tired after travelling from Australia, and I enquired about a bath. Our room did not have one, but I was given an upgrade straight away to a beautiful room with a large bath. Bliss. We then received a complimentary fruit plate delivered to our room. The rooms are amazing and quite different. The beds are so comfortable, and the bathroom towels etc are very large, soft and fluffy, with a plentiful supply.. The staff are lovely and the breakfast was also excellent.   Nothing seems to be any effort for them. The location is really good, and we walked to most places, Regent Street for shopping is just a few minutes away.",5,2011,05,07
132,Very clean and modern,"A hotel with such modern decor would not usually be my top choice but Sanderson had some attractive rates for a hotel of this class and I decided to give it a try.  I was very happy with this choice.  The rooms are clean and bright and I particularly liked the use of hardwood and tile rather than grungy wall to wall carpeting.  My room was large by London standards and the bed was very comfortable.  Sanderson is well-located on a quiet street just off Oxford Street and walking distance to Soho and many key attractions.

The hotel bar was definitely busy most nights and the lobby is filled with loud-ish music, but none of this noise made it to my room.   Service is fine.  It's not ""tripping over themselves to help you"" fantastic, but it was adequately polite and attentive.  Housekeeping was exceptional.  I found particularly amusing the gentlemen posted at the front door who couldn't seem to decide whether they were bouncers, security guards, or doormen.",5,2011,04,25
132,Chic and welcoming.,"Typically a chic hotel is also pretentious - the Sanderson defied this stereotype.  Its stylish interior was coupled with a welcoming and friendly staff.  The minimalist rooms were spacious and very clean.  The restaurants and bar were fun and trendy and the food was fantastic.  Most importantly, the staff was very helpful and accommodating.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend this to others as a great place to stay whether visiting London for business or pleasure.",5,2011,04,18
132,Not exactly an oasis of calm,"I stayed at the Sanderson in London  for two night in April after having found a deal on Jetsetter on this ""5 star hotel"".  I arrived at around 8.30pm after a 6 hour journey, to a lobby that throbbed with the sound of house music. I thought that I had arrived at Studio 54 by mistake, perhaps understandably, as the hotel used to be owned by Ian Schrager. I was surprised not to have been offered any help with my 3 bags by the doorman. I was given a room on the first floor (in British parlance, 2nd floor in US) and was extremely apprehensive about the noise problem but it turned out to be acceptably quiet. The room itself was a quirky Phillipe Stark design. All white with the bed in the middle of the room and at a very slight angle to true, the bathroom vanity was at a more pronounced off center angle. (Why???)
The bed was comfortable, there was a decent flat screen TV but with a pretty limited range of Sky satellite channels and internet access (wireless) was $16 per device - I had a computer and an i-Pad so $32 per day for the two. The bathroom was cool but not seperate from the bedroom, with just a diaphanous mesh curtain between the two.
I ordered breakfast from room service the following morning, which arrived precisely on time and was good albeit not a great bargain at $40 for a continental breakfast.
I left the hotel at 8.30am and when I returned to my hotel at 3.45pm, my room had not been cleaned, although the breakfast tray had been removed other than the used cereal wrappers and the used tea bag pouch as well as one of the two half-used jam pots that I had put on my croissants. (strange????)
Arriving back at the hotel that evening I was stopped from entering by the doorman who enquired whether I was going to the bar or the restaurant.
The gym is large and well equipped. The public areas have cool decorations. It is clearly trying to have a very cool vibe and perhaps I am not the target customer. If you are looking for a happening hotel with major bar action and a disco sensibility, the Sanderson may be for you. I will not stay there again, but wouldn't dissuade my 18 year old son from trying it.",3,2011,04,17
132,An office block pretending to be a hotel,"The reviews that I read about the Sanderson remind me of the story of the Emperor's New Clothes.  It seems that people think if they criticise the great design of Phillipe Starck they will in some way be seen as luddites.  Well luddite I am.

The hotel is a poor office block conversion, the ceilings in the corridors and rooms are so low they are oppressive.  The rooms are offices that have a few lace curtains hanging from various places to try to make them look like rooms...it doesn't work, they still look like offices.   The bathroom is small and poorly fitted.  The lobby is an office lobby...etc...etc.  On the same trip I stayed at the Connaught, if these two hotels have the same star rating questions have to be asked of those who do the rating!

There are a few saving graces; a busy bar, a nice malaysian restaurant and superb staff.  However, they do not make up for the lousy state of the building.  Don't be fooled, if Phillipe Starck hadn't put his name to the design everybody would see it for what it is...a poorly revamped office block.",1,2011,04,14
132,very slick,"A  nice hotel in a good position. Furnishings are modern and stylish The staff were friendly and helpful. Only downside was that housekeeping would enter the room without knocking. This happened on a few occasions. When speaking to front of house I was told that they knock ""quietly"". They didn't knock at all! Another hotel that doesn't offer free wi-fi in rooms. I'll be avoiding all hotels that don't offer free wi-fi. I see no reason why this isn't a standard offering.",4,2011,04,13
132,Excellent Service - attentive but non-intrusive,"Everything about my stay at the Sanderson said ""service with excellence"". The room was spacious, the staff friendly (but not to the point where it gets annoying), the food was great, the drinks even better. What struck me the most about my stay was how aware the staff are of who is staying at the hotel. Upon stepping outside the hotel, the doorman (Alex) greeted me by name and asked if there was anything he could do for me, and how was everything in my room that I had asked for (I had some flowers sent up and some strawberries in chocolate). If everyone is greeted in the same way as I was, there simply isn't another hotel one should visit other than the Sanderson. My only gripe was the room was too hot (which I could have asked them to sort) but I thought it really didn't matter given how well I was treated. From check in to check out, my stay was amazing. Oh, and I recommend the mojitos. Fab!!",5,2011,04,04
132,Sublimely brilliant - nothing too much for their team to arrange,"We stayed here in March and the service we received was amazing. 
We held a large VIP event in the Agua Spa and the team were so welcoming and accommodating- the spa manager even took the time to email and work on finalising arrangements during her own holiday in South Africa. 
Food was brilliant - I can recommend all of the Spa food as we tried out everything! 
Spa treatments were fab - all my journalists were happy and are booking repeat trips! 
I can't wait to go back here as it reall does feel like home from home (only better, but don't tell my husband this!)",5,2011,03,30
132,A hotel of this quality should be able to handle the basics or are they just superficial,"No problems with the overall quality of the public spaces and the room. Stylish and comfortable during my 4 night stay. 

My big complaint however is with the food at the long bar. i was on my own on a Monday night and just wanted a simple burger and fries and  a glass of red wine. No problem Homemade burger and fries on the menu So ordered and had a glas of rioja ( only 3 red wines by the glass to choose from) and i waited. The wine tasted as if it had been in the bottle opened for about 2-3 days quickly changed to a fresh bottle without problem by the friendly staff. But the wine was not great quality I would guess 3-4 GBP per bottle retail. ( ( 8 GBP per glass!). Then comes the burger which was huge but definitely not homemade and with fries just like from McDonalds. I eat the fries and left the burger it was that bad....the sort of thing you buy in bulk a supermarket. For 18GBP this is simply not adequate. I complained and got a shrug from the staff.
the week before i was in a small Rennaissance hotel just off the highway in NJ where I got a real homemade burger with thick cut fries that was perfect and with a choice of 10 good quality red wines by the glass. All for less than half the price of the sanderson. ( I am not from the US by the way) If they can do it then a so called up market hotel should be doing better than this.",3,2011,03,28
132,I've been a Sanderson lover for 5+ years and the affair continues...,"From the moment you arrive, until the moment you leave, the staff here are on point, the uber mod aesthetic is stylish, the energy is fab and the cocktails have a kick - for a NYC boy I'm proud to call the Sanderson my London home away from home.  They also have one of the best hotel gyms around....

If you're looking for a traditional British lodging experience, this may not be for you - take some time to familiarize yourself with the Morgan's Hotel group's offerings and make a decision.

For me - 5+ years of awesomeness and even when things haven't gone as smooth as silk, the efforts to fix it are always above and beyond.",5,2011,03,25
132,Loved it.,"Used it visit the Long Bar when I was a young Aussie living in London... drinking overpriced champagne we couldn't afford... always thought the place was special.

Finally had the opportunity to stay and I must admit it still deserves respect.. the atmosphere is great, the reception staff were very helpful and more down to earth than expected.. the rooms we're excellent.  the only issue I had was on my first night (sunday) where I could hear parties and people in the hall ways continuously throughout the night..  such as trendy hotel attracts a certain type of visitor and you must be willing to accept a some noise ... other than this the hotel floors are generally peaceful. 

Internet was annoying at 10 pounds per day.",4,2011,03,20
132,We loved the Sanderson,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay here. The front desk staff were extremely professional and very helpful. Fortunate to book a room with a terrace which was fantastic.The breakfast buffet was first class. Loved the long bar and the lavish purple room. Great location for us - tube, shops, China White. This is what a five star boutique hotel should be. Will return.",5,2011,03,20
132,Style over substance - a little impractical,"I stayed here for 5 days and would probably try somewhere else next time like st. martin's lane - (though I'd certainly agree that this hotel is MUCH better than some others that I've stayed in in the area and would probably come back if I don't find anything else better).

I quite liked the styling - the lobby is interesting and had interesting decor and furniture pieces.  The space-theme in the elevators was a little over the top - it was all a little holographic / out of focus and made me dizzy every time I went in.  

The room is also stylish but it would appear that the designer had chosen to prioritize style over practicality.  For example, the desk was wedged between the bed and a big glass wall separating the bathroom from the bedroom in such a way that you can hardly get into the chair, let alone lean back or wheel around.  On the desk is a big metal tray which contained all the hotel information but quickly you find that you have to dump that on the floor in order to find space to put your laptop.  

I really loved the little silver clock by the side of the bed - I was tempted to buy one... until I realized that it was almost impossible to set the alarm with the little plastic dial on the back.  

The shower had no place to put shampoo/ soap etc. so you have to put it on the floor.  There was no iron / ironing board in the room so I had to call for it.  There was also no kettle in the room to make a cup of tea or coffee.  There was a little letter from the manager saying that this is one of the most common requests from guests so they are trialing a ""complementary tea/filter coffee service"" and to call housekeeping for it.  When I called, they seemed confused and said that there is no complementary coffee.  I had to read the letter out to them before they sent me something.  

I ordered some room service while I was there - I think the western food is ok but the green papaya salad from the malaysian menu is it REALLY quite bad.  

On the upside, liked the styling, good location, good water pressure in the shower...  maybe I will come back again.",3,2011,03,19
132,funkyyyyyyyyyy,"what a trendy and complete different hotel experience
great hotel not the most centrally located depending on what you wish to do during you stay 
however the hotel itself was fabolous, very modern and trendy hotel 
great resturant called spoon
the room are very funky and nice
will definately stay here again",5,2011,03,17
132,What a Treat!,"Myself and my boyfriend came here for our first anniversary. The staff were helpful and friendly and the hotel itself was stunning.

The rooms are quirky and that add's to it's uniqueness over other hotels.

Located in between Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Circus Tube stations it's in an ideal location for a night on the tiles in Central London!

We also had treatments at the spa the following day and what a treat. The spa is a tranqil haven and the staff are friendly and professional. I didn't want to leave!",5,2011,03,08
132,A great experience,"Sanderson is a great hotel from the minute you step inside.  Decor, staff, service are ball first class.",5,2011,03,06
132,An Experience,"I wanted to get away for my birthday and couldn't travel aboard so decided to stay at the Sanderson.  The rooms are BEAUTIFUL!!!!! the service was AMAZING!!!!! and the spa i loved because you could have your privicy in the lounge area (1) and (2) they really make you feel like you are the only person at the spa. I Always enjoy the food, the long bar is one of a kind.  People this hotel is a MUST..................",5,2011,03,02
132,"Becoming dated, and over priced","This hotel is becoming dated and has lost its shine. Room layout is tiring and not user friendly. Also, charging £10 for internet access is a joke - do they charge extra for water?",3,2011,02,18
132,"Great Hotel, and the most amazing concierge in the World","I have stayed in this hotel many, many times over ten years, but have never written a review. The hotel is still modern and funky even after all these years. I always really enjoy my stays in the Sanderson as the staff are wonderful. The location is also ideal for all that London has to offer.

I wanted to write the review now to recognise the wonderful service I received from Mike the concierge. Nothing was too much trouble, and he booked dinners and clubs for both nights of my stay. His recommendations were wonderful, and he was able to pull string to get me into the top places.

Great hotel, and wonderful concierge.",5,2011,02,16
132,A great combination of style AND substance.,"I stayed at The Sanderson for just the one night, checking in mid-afternoon after a long flight from Asia.  My first impression was a very polite and welcoming doorman and a very quick but friendly check-in.  I have stayed at a number of Morgan's hotels and have always been intrigued to stay here at the Sanderson. On first impressions, I found the room to feel a bit 'officey' compared to other Morgan's hotels, but this is more lightly a product of the building the hotel was converted from.  Although the (extremely comfortable) bed took up most of the room, it was still practical enough for 2 people with 2 suitcases.  

After coming back to the room after a few hours shopping, it was a really pleasant surprise to see two lovely cup cakes and a handwritten note wishing us a wonderful stay.  I think this says a lot about the hotels commitment and urge to make every guest feel special.  Although I didn't visit the bars, they did look very busy and happening for a Friday night, and more importantly, the soundproofing of the room is great so there is no disturbance at all.  

I think the dreamy and surreal mood of the lobby doesn't quite translate into the cheaper/standard rooms which disappointed me slightly BUT the room was very comfortable, the bed the absolute comfiest I've stayed in all year, the room service menu was more reasonably priced than I expected, and the service is the style I prefer the most: professional but relaxed, efficient but friendly.

I would definitely stay again. I only wish I had more time to stay than one night.

Sanderson feels like a rare example of a 'design hotel' without attitude or pretension and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel (The best of the Morgan's Group I have stayed in so far!!!!!)",4,2011,02,02
132,Design that don't last,"The design of the hotel didn't age well, even if it's quite recent. The service is fine but the room furniture is just weird and don't make you feel cozy at all.",2,2011,01,31
132,"Great Hotel, Lively Bar and fabulous Staff!!","I have stayed at the Sanderson Hotel 3 times in the last six weeks and would be very reluctant to stay anywhere else now...  I have travelled with different friends each time who are all impressed with the hotel reception area, the bedrooms and the fabulous Long Bar!  The atmosphere during the day is very laid back which is great for a chill out drink and a bite to eat but then the pace hots up and by late evening the place is packed!  Our intention was to go out on our last visit but we were having such a great time in the bar we never made it.

The bedrooms are all of an excellent size and have all been very clean and well maintained.  We did have an issue with our cd player not working and within 5 minutes of calling it had been resolved.

As I have  visited with another female friend we always felt very safe and well looked after.  On each occasion we have had recommendations and reservations made for us my Mike, the Senior Concierge (who's recommendations are worth the cost of the stay alone!) and every one of these has been a fabulous experience to places we would never have known about.

It has always been such an enjoyable experience that I will be visiting again in March!",5,2011,01,31
132,Very cool and comfortable,Spent the night at Sanderson whilst on business. Very comfortable room and the public areas are cool. Dinner in Suka and a drink in the Long Bar is highly recommended.,5,2011,01,25
132,Let Mike the senior conceirge help your stay,"We were staying athe The Sanderson for my 40th birthday and after checking in we were greeted by Mike Fitzgerald the senior conceirge. Mikes a loveble character with excellent knowledge on whats going on in london. He showed us round the hotel immediately making my wife and i at ease, this treatment and approach continued with all other staff throughout our stay. Mikes an Infectious guy and sets the scene for the rest of the hotel. A great weekend was had with an offer from Mike to assist us whenever we are back in London whether staying the night or not",4,2011,01,20
132,Marcela  makes you feel like the only guest in the hotel,"Arrived at the hotel early morning from overseas. I checked my blackberry and realized that my office forgot to make reservations. Marcela immediately greeted me at the front desk and said not to worry. Within a couple of minutes, she looked up my rate and room type from previous visits and made my reservation. She then took a  a room that was on hold and made it immediately available. She even upgraded me. When I arrived back at the hotel that afternoon there were fresh cupcakes with a welcome note from Marcela. Definitely top notch professional service in a hotel that treats you like an important guest. 
I've stayed at the Sanderson and other hotels in London but Marcela definitely turned me into a loyal Sanderson guest. I would not stay in any other hotel.",5,2011,01,12
132,5* Fabulous Sanderson,"Firstly I would find it very hard to see what there is to dislike about this hotel.  After staying in London over the years this has to be the most beautiful fun and exciting hotel experience fab concierge, reception and door men.  We booked to stay in a basic room at the Sanderson as our flight to New York for xmas was cancelled,  the hotel in New york we booked The Royalton is part of the same group of hotel.  We were so disappointed with the trip having to be cancelled so decided to have a night out in london in style.  When we arrived at the Sanderson we had mentioned what had happened and they took control of the situation and made our sad situation  a memorable fab one.   They 5 times upgraded us to a loft suite beautiful room recommended a great japanese restaurant around the corner suggested drinks at The Savoy and left us two lovely cakes in the evening with a nice note telling us to relax with them and enjoy our stay.  The hotel has two amazing bars the long bar I have drank in on other occasions and have always had a great time the purple bar area is intimate and relaxing especially as a couple.   Hotels in London for £200 a night are nothing special just the same old mediocre however for £250 you can have fabulosity all the way.   Thankyou so much The Sanderson hotel The Talmans room 122 23rd Dec.",5,2010,12,26
132,Funky Hotel - I recommend!,"I loved Sanderson Hotel during my stay in the beginning of December. I was on a business trip and did not have much time to enjoy the hotel and its services, but the little I had time was... simply awesome!

I loved my room which was spacious, comfy and modern, the bed was so comfortable that I didn't want to leave it in the morning! breakfast was excellent and service 5 Star, loved the fresh fruits, pastries, omelettes and lattes... I also enjoyed a couple of drinks in the super cool, dimly lit bar in the hotel lobby and their delicious mediterranean sandwich with salad. 

If you go to London, go to Sanderson!",5,2010,12,22
132,"Poor service, not great, overpriced, but looks nice?","Overpriced food and drink, snooty bar and reception staff. They could do with training in good customer service, something many of these top rated hotels should do best.
The interior and overall design of the place is cool, but let down by the staff and over the top prices. Pretty on the outside, but once you delve in deeper the cracks appear everywhere.
The rooms are nice, clean and good hotel decor, I'm afraid that's the only positive thing I have to say. If you are feeling flush and like to pay over the odds and need to stay off of Tottenham Court Rd, this might be the one for you.",3,2010,12,07
132,"Great room, great service - pure class!","The Sanderson Hotel in London is part of the Morgans Group of hotels and is another Philippe Starck designed hotel.  My wife and I were staying in a deluxe room for our 6 yr wedding annniversary.  The room was not ready on arrival so the guy on reception took my luggage.  I had to speak to the concierge to arrange some flowers for the room as a surprise and I mentioned it was our anniversary.  The concierge Rich was friendly and helpful.  We cam back later that evening and collected our room keys and were given two cocktail vouchers for the Long Bar which was great.  My luggage was already in the room along with the flowers.  The room itself was large and unlike anything I've ever seen before! Lots of glass everywhere, white walls, bed, furniture etc, huge white silky curtains draped between the main part of the room and the glass bathroom (which could be automatically retracted back and forth using some electric buttons).  A great balcony with a lounger and 2 seater sofa and candles everywhere.  The hotel staff had also very thoughtfully put white petals all over the bed and given us a large bottle of Pommery champagne on ice!  What a lovely gesture!  We went for drinks that evening in the Long Bar and had some nice cocktails although I've had better caipiroskas if I'm honest.  We went out for dinner and returned quite late that evening.  That night, there seemed to be a party going on in the next room and in the corridor which kept us awake between 4am and 7am.  My wife complained in the morning and was promptly offered a free breakfast for two and an upgrade the next time we visit! What great service!  The English breakfast was huge and very good quality.  On departure the front office manager Krzysztof apologised for the noise again and gave us his card in order to arrange our next visit and ensure we got our upgrade.
Overall, a fantastic experience, great room and some of the best hotel service I've ever experienced.  Other hotels should take note.",5,2010,11,21
132,Not for business travellers,"I am lately in London a lot for business and this must be the most user unfriendly hotel to date. The staff are all wannabe models with a pretentious air surrounding them and cant get a decent nights sleep as the aircon (which doesnt turn off) makes a dreadful noise. I have tosay that even the bed was offputting, its placed in the middle of the room without the psychological comfort of having the bed next to a wall. 
To avoid if possible. ",2,2010,11,11
132,"Not worth the money, not worth the hype","The hotel is very expensive, yet underwhelming in style and service. The room is completely white, the bed not very comfortable, and not even an arm-chair... Not worth it",2,2010,11,08
132,Amazing experience and staff,"The Sanderson is an amazingly stylish hotel but also doesn't take itself too seriously. The staff are extraordinarily skilled, friendly and down to earth. Style is fab, spa is fab particularly the individual curtained off couches, the food is phenomonal, great atmosphere. It is high end, nobody there looks like the recession has touched them and in many ways this is refreshing. It is definitely worth the experience.",5,2010,10,26
132,Outstanding Hotel with very freindly staff,The girls loved the design it was a good location for shopping and we had a wonderful time. The concierige were absolutely terrific and helpful :-) Will go back with my husband can recommend this hotel... Only downside was the breakfast buffé wich was expensive and not anything special...,5,2010,10,25
132,Unbelievably expensive !!!,"I just wanted to treat myself while I was on business trip to stay in a fancy hotel. Ok, I know that London is a very expensive capital, I have to come here almost every month but I would never go back to the hotel. When you pay such a high price you would expect an outstanding service. Nothing of that sort happened, not even a good service actually. Go to a B&B 2 stars and you might find the staff more helpful and friendly...",2,2010,10,24
132,Very Expensive and a bit tacky!,"My husband arranged a night at the Sanderson for my birthday.  The room was cool and trendy, but when you are paying nearly £400 a night, we were disappointed we had to pay £7.00 for a cup of tea and an extra £50 for a cooked breakfast!
We ate in the evening and again the food was not worth the £50 per head we paid.  The bar was also full of call girls, one of which hung herself off my friend's husband trying to buy drugs and another tried to get in a fight with my sister......not very 5 star!
Service was slow, and food average. :(",3,2010,09,27
132,My favourite London Hotel now!!,"Wow! From check-in I knew straight away this was going to be a wonderful stay! We were provided with champagne on arrival which was such a lovely touch. The Staff member who checked us in made us feel so welcome and special. All Reception staff were like this with all guests - lovely to see. Some people harp on about the hotel being pretencious. I can honestly say that I never saw any of this while at the Hotel. Every staff member was just wonderful. Our room was just wonderful! The bed was like sleeping on a cloud! It was just beautiful. The room was an amazing size too. Very impressed We did not end up going out until late as we loved the room so much! We visited the Purple Bar which was stunning! Yes, it is rather expensive but you are in a 5 star Hotel and it is so worth it! Staff in here were awesome too and so helpful. I work for a Booking Agency and I can honestly say that the Hotel exceeded my expectations. I will definitley be sending my customers here in the future. Thank you so much to all of the staff for making us feel so welcome. Keep up the good work! I cannot wait to get back there!",5,2010,09,06
132,Spacious and Modern Hotel,I recently stayed at the Sanderson for a work conference and was impressed with all aspects of the hotel. The hotel offers minimalist design inspired rooms which are very  spacious and comfortable. I Had the best sleep in a while and considering the central location just off leicester square I experienced a very peaceful nights sleep. The staff are friendly and attentive and the restaurant has high quality food in modern surroundings. I would recommend this hotel for both business and leisure stays due to its great location and comfortable rooms. Would defintely stay again when in London.,5,2010,09,05
132,Absolute Luxury,"From arrival to departure it was a joy. Staff were very helpful and couldn't do enough for us. Went for a superior double which was devine and didnt want to leave the room. Had lunch at Suka, pre dinner drinks at the Long Bar and post drinks in the Purple Room. Food, cocktails, service all excellent. Stylish with substance. Going to try their sister hotel, St Martins Lane next!",5,2010,09,01
132,Tragically Hip - Literally,"Booked 5 nights with an additional night to make sure I had a room upon early am check-in after an overnight flight from New York. Check-in was a total nightmare. The hotel canceled me out and charged my card for 5 nights of a no-show, even though I specified advance night booking and early check-in on their website. So after canceling me out of the system and after arriving in their hotel tired from my trip, not only did I not have a room, but they continued to charge me for the room they had canceled on me the night before when they labeled me a no-show. Dead tired, I had to wait 20 minutes and supposedly was upgraded to a better room, which at night was impossible to sleep in until the Long Bar downstairs closed.  I am very familiar with the Morgans Hotel Brand.  The big sale is the party scene(Long Bar) the secondary event is sexual hedonism in rooms that are dreamy. I'm cool with both , but for the love of god, at least try to maintain some sense of your British decorum. On one night during my stay it seemed a raving pack of overly inebriated chavs took hostage the hallways of the fourth floor at 3am.  Now up from the debauchery outside, I decided to have a look at the food choices. Ugghh forget the limited menu, but what really turned me off was the GBP3.50 service fee, the 22% gratuity and then another ""recovery fee"" all before deciding which choice you would make.  Drinks there were good however, I did have a few very good mojitos in the Purple Bar one evening.   

What shocked me was what I found in the spa. The Men's steam room was moldy and smelled as such. The mold smell was so strong the attendant would not let me sit in there until he sprayed eucalyptus aroma which still did not help. The relaxation areas were nice, but back to the tragically hip title.  What locker room in a spa does not have basic disposable grooming amenities?  Only towels and soap for a shower, no combs, deodorant sprays cologne choice, toothbrushes, q-tips or cotton. razors, hairdryers. It was very weird that a hotel that sells itself to the good looking well groomed crowd did not have any of these basic amenities on offer. So back to the room looking like a drowned rat.  One of the toilet doors was broken in the locker room.  One sink out of service. So the spa was for lack of a better word to describe the experience, dodgy!

As for the location, it may be the best location in London for hours between 7pm and 4am, but after that it seemed impossible to get a cab to the office. Bell staff were never found during the daytime to help hail a cab. Everyone seemed to hide during the day behind the front desk curtains as if a bunch of vampires. The location is convenient to the touristy shopping areas only, not central to any business location in the city.  Regardless I wanted to stay there to experience another Morgans, but was left doubting I would ever return for a stay of this length here. I would however definitely return for the bar.  I am also not sure I would recommend to others and remain pissed about the check-in experience and the fact I was still charged for the night they canceled me out on!",3,2010,08,30
132,AMAZING- U GOTTA TRY IT.....,"Stayed at the Sanderson for a long weekend and didnt want to leave.
The place is great.
While it is a little on the expensive side, its simply worth it.
Right from check-in the staff were great - especially the concierge who magically secured us tickets to a sold out west end show - thats service.
The bar is fantastic, great place to people watch and amazing cocktails to boot.
Am going to book for a few days in November as soon as I sort out some flights.
Everyone needs to experience the Sanderson - you wont want to stay anywhere else in London.....",5,2010,08,27
132,Expensive luxury no breakfast !,"My family (with 3 teenagers) stayed here in July. We were very happy with rooms, cleanliness, helpfulness of staff and location - near Oxford Street. For the price we paid, I felt breakfast could easily have been included. However there were numerous cafes around esp Italian bakery.
Our balcony was lovely, a rare find in London. The bed was excellent and we slept really well.
Not really a family hotel, better for couples - nightlife fans as bar looked fantastic !",4,2010,08,18
132,"Great location, but rooms almost too trendy?","Stayed at the Sanderson for 4 nights in mid July on business.  Overall, i think it is a great hotel for singles and couples, but too trendy and lacking in facilities for families.  

Pros
- Location is excellent.  Close to Oxford St for shopping, close to Soho for bars and restaurants.  A little bit of a walk to the tube though...St Martin's Lane (the sister hotel) arguably has a better location right next to leicester square
- Rooms are very clean and modern, with a funky shower....but almost too chic.  Lacking a little bit of ""comfort"" and ""warmth""....be nice to have some colour somewhere for example (everything is all white)
- Bar is great, though pricey....sort of place to see wealthy middle aged men with attractive young girls 
- Gym was nice 
- Service was fantastic by all the staff I encountered

Cons
- I'm a lover of clean modern hotels, but this was almost too chic...as mentioned, the rooms come across very bare.  
- No in house movies selection....definitely doesn't seem to be the place where you can chill out in the room for hours by yourself to relax
- Would be awesome if it had a lap pool
- Little bit far away from the tube (guessing around 400-500m walk?)
- Pricey, so doubt would pay for it on personal account

Overall, still a nice hotel...but in future, I'd prefer to stay in something a bit more traditional but still modern like the Intercontinental or JW Marriott Grosvenor House.",4,2010,08,04
132,Too trendy for its own good,"We stayed in this hotel in May paid for by my company and so was glad it wasnt my money!
Whilst the hotel was great fun with fantastic bars and in a great location I thought the rooms were a total rip off, they were small white boxes with absolutely nowhere to store anything other than hang a couple of suits /dresses up...this hotel is obviously frequented by those who travel light! I also thought the proce of drinks were steep even by London standards £9.50 for a G & T..but beautifully presented.
Good for spotting the famous and beautiful people great location right in centre of west end and close to Soho and bar and wating staff were great fun no stuffy pretentious stuff you get in some 5 star
Bad for rooms, overspriced food and drinks and some customers being rather pretentious and stuck up
Go but only if someone else is paying",3,2010,07,30
132,"I dont know if its worth it, may need another stay???","Stayed here quite a while ago. I thought I would give my review. The hotel is in excellent location, we stayed here for 2 nights on bed and breakfast basis. Check in did take a while as it was quite busy but that wasn’t a problem (no apology was given). The room is fairly big and a good bathroom size also. Downstairs in the bar area it gets quite busy and loud and you will be probably not get a good sleep if you decided to have one, as I could hear a lot of racket as guests were coming upto sleep. Also there was lots of noise of dustbin men or workers clearing the streets. (when u pay ££££ u expect to have a nice pleasant sleep)! Breakfast was good and a lot of variety. Service was ok nothing terrific I would say as there was some slow service when ordering drinks. I am considering coming to London, not sure if should return to this hotel???",4,2010,07,29
132,"Very nice hotel, but meant for a certain crowd","Overall, very nice. Good service, pleasant staff, great location in the West End.
The rooms are interesting, with beds in the middle of the room and artwork on the ceiling over the bed. The style is uber-modern, which is not for some. At night, it did feel like a European dance club in the bar area.

The Malaysian restaurant was good, and the rooms were clean & nice, so long as you like the decor and style. I'm not sure I was cool enough to stay there :)

All in all, its a good place to stay if you need to be in the West End or near Soho Square.",4,2010,07,07
132,Fantastic in every way,"I went with my partner and my puppy, we have stayed previously at The Shore Club and Delano (also Morgans group) and had a fantastic time, we weren't expecting it to be as amazing as there but as soon as we arrived they made us feel very welcome. We went out during the day for a couple of hours and when we arrived back to the room there was a card for Monty (our dog) saying hope he enjoys his stay, and a book with quotes about dogs, we were really touched and it made us feel special. For the evening we decided to stay downstairs at the bar, which had a fabulous ambiance to it. The drinks were quite expensive but it was worth it, all the staff were so friendly and helpful through out our stay, the hotel was beautiful and they made us feel like VIP's, although it was just one night it felt like a mini break. I wouldn't of changed anything about our stay and cant wait to go to the St Martins Lane next time, I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is a wonderful place where you get treated like your the only person staying. Its a treasure in London!",5,2010,07,06
132,"Sleepless in London - what a ""waste""","As almost all Morgan hotels (16 stays) Sanderson is a rare and refreshing study in cool ""haute hotellerie"" and design. Lovely and we keep coming back (kept!) But If you need sleep and have been travelling half the world make sure that you don't get a room facing the back of the hotel and the carpark - the further down, the worse! Unless you have a special interest in loud men (from 4-7 am) emptying garbage (especially bottles and lots of them) and loudly discussing the weekends football loss. It's our 6. stay at the hotel, we pay superiour room price, asked for a quiet room - but for the second time got tickets to the special performance of the infamous  London show ""The garbagemen of the Backstreet"" and ""Sleepless in London"" Not recommendable, not fair  - and a pity , there is so much good to say about this place - so what a waste...",2,2010,06,28
132,"6-Star service, luxury and quality","We stayed at The Sanderson for our wedding weekend for a touch of elegance and luxury even though we live in London.  Having had food and cocktails in the beautiful Long Bar and garden, we know the quality and beauty of this hotel, just off Oxford Street.
From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with such warmth and charm from the Sanderson Team.  The check-in team were courteous, warm, professional and a pleasure to deal with.  The lobby and ground floor space in chic, stylist and a beautiful place to be.  The purple, 3-d hologram lifts were a quirky and fun experience!
Our room was light. bright and a stylist laid out.  The queen sized bed and linen was so comfortable and we slept very well over of stay.  The bathroom had a huge bath tub (space for two with comfort) and the wet room area was well equipped and the shower also had room for us both.  The Sony audio visual kit was sleek and high spec'.
The room-service team were a joy to behold - nothing was too much trouble and every order was delivered promptly.
We had a table booked for the Friday evening in the garden of the hotel restaurant.  The food dazzled us - modern Malaysian and Asia food at it's finest.  The head chef knows his stuff!  Every dish was beautifully presented and tasted delicious.  The restaurant and bar team looked after us so well.  The bar was busy with Friday evening customer but provided plenty of back ground ambiance and buzz.
The concierge team had heard it was our civil partnership /  wedding the following day and we were over-whelmed when they sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne to our room later that evening.  These personal touches over the weekend made our stay even more special.
The front of house team were so helpful with assistance with making travel, car and taxi  arrangements to get to our ceremony on time.
After an wonderful (and exhausting) ceremony and reception, we welcomed the calm and elegant return to the Sanderson.  A hand written card of congratulations from the hotel team and another bottle of bubbly awaited our return to the room - such a lovely thought from the team.  
We checked out the following day and  again had a lovely chat wit the friendly and professional front of house team and went back to reality.
The elegance, charm, sincere warmth of the Sanderson hotel, as well as the excellent food and drink (have cocktails in the Purple Bar) would make us recommend the Sanderson to any one looking for a special hotel for any occasion in the heart of the West End.  We can't thank the team enough for their hospitality, charm and excellence of service and food.

With our best wishes

Euan & Richard",5,2010,06,11
132,Fantastic Ambience - wish I could stay more often,I stayed in the Sanderson as part of a work junket so cannot really comment on value or service but this is a special place with a real wow! factor and should not be missed. If only I had spent less time supping the magnificent cocktails and more time tucked up in the sumptuous bed I would have had time to catch breakfast but alas this was not to be. Bar service was immaculate late into the night...,5,2010,06,10
132,Fabulous Trendy Five Star Hotel with no stuffiness!,"My wife and I stayed at the fabulous Sanderson Hotel for our 10th wedding anniversary. We wanted a special hotel and 5 star but don't like the stuffiness sometimes attached to that level of hotel in London. The Sanderson is funky, cool and fun and the staff make you feel really at home and relaxed with none of the formalities which we find off-putting. the room and bars are superb and and we had a really great stay made all the more special by the way the staff looked after us on our specail anniversay. FANTASIC!!",5,2010,06,08
132,Over rated Hotel Def not 5 Star !!,"I am a frequent traveller via business and leisure chose this hotel re the reviews i read on TA and also location..Arrived to a lovely welcome fron the reception staff whom i must say are very polite and welcoming..Nice reception area...We booked the more expensive room as it was our first wedding anniversary..we arrived at the room to find th eroom looking more than shabby the net curtains def have not been cleaned since they were put up !! and the white chair coverings were now not white ,the sink was dirty also..My husband had unpacked within minutes as we were meeting friends for lunch..I req that we were moved as the room was dirty and shabby the staff moved us to another room which again was still shabby and extreemly small but the sink was clean.. Nice touch in the evening with the candles being lit in the room should think u get a little extra with the high cost of the rooms here !! ..Downside corridors loads of drunken people running up at down from 3am to 5am and ignored by the hotel !! not what i would expect from this type of so called 5 star hotel..The bedrooms in both rooms we had were tiny with open plan bathrooms so if you a shy not the hotel for you...

The bar area looked fun but v v v v v expensive so save for your cocktails  ..

Wouldnt stay here again like more space and VALUE for what it cost's felt let down..",2,2010,06,07
132,WOW factor from beginning to end!,"My partner and I had a fabulous time staying at the Sanderson this weekend for our anniversary - from the moment we walked into the impressive lobby, filled with an eclectic mix of furniture that wouldn't look out of place at Tate Modern, we were greeted by warm and friendly staff and shown to our room via the mystical lift - an experience in itself!  The room was out of this world, with a huge sleigh bed in the middle and a freestanding bath that was plenty big enough for two! Sheer curtains drapped throughout the room gave it a romantic feel, though, true to Phillipe Starck style, there were also quirky touches including a framed painting on the ceiling.  Before heading out for dinner we had a drink in the courtyard garden, which was filled with colourful flowers and a water fountain - perfect on a warm summer's evening.  We came back to the hotel after dinner for a drink in the Purple bar, and I'm pleased I listened to the Bar Manager's prior advice to forgo dessert and leave room for a chocolate Martini, which was by far the nicest cocktail I have ever tasted!  When we returned to our room we were touched to find it had been tidied and candles lit, and this exceptional level of service continued right up until the time we checked out, when we were offered a bottle of water for our journey home.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious break, in a unique hotel, in a great location - absolutely fantastic!",5,2010,06,06
132,"Nice Bar, Hype but overpriced rooms","If you are a fashion victim , this is the place, if you like comfort avoid it.
I recommand the bar , a best.Location is great.",4,2010,06,02
132,Don’t believe the hype,"I stayed here with my wife, and we had a room on the first floor.

The lift ride was an amazing 3D holographic ride, however I unfortunately wasn’t spending the night in the lift!!

The room, while it may have once been impressive, now looked shabby and dull. Net curtains strewn across the room separate the bathroom from the bed, which is screwed to the floor at a strange angle. The Bed was ridiculously uncomfortable. I could feel the springs in the mattress and they pinged whenever you slightly moved.

We arrived back to the hotel around 12.30, and got ready for bed. There was the gentle thump thump thump from the long bar below seeping through the floor. I phoned reception and they seemed unconcerned, so I asked for two pairs of ear plugs. 10 minutes later a battered box which once contained 3 pairs of ear plugs was delivered, with two lonely, possibly used ear plugs. I contacted reception again and said I had requested two pairs. They stated that was all they had. I aksed if they often got complaints about the noise, to which they answered ‘yes’, but they had stopped handing out ear plugs. I asked what I could do, and was told the music from the bar would stop at 2.00am!!! Great!!!

Breakfast,
We ordered breakfast, we had 30 minutes to eat as we both had meetings to attend, I explained this to the waitress and we ordered. After 28 minutes our cooked breakfasts turned up, they looked delicious. I had 3 mouthfuls before having to leave!!! It was very tasty, and would have been very good if I had the time to eat some of it!!

All in all, for the money this place was terrible, the staff were either rude or unhelpful, depending upon there fancy, and you have about a 50% chance your room key will work!!

The only reason to stay would be to say you have stayed at the Sanderson, but if you state that to anyone who may have also stayed there, expect nothing but sympathy!!!",1,2010,06,01
132,Little details make a difference,"I decided to try the Sanderson as a change of pace from its sister-hotel St. Martin's Lane where I've stayed on previous trips to London.  The hotels are very similar in design, pricing, and room layout.    The modern style of the Sanderson won't appeal to everyone-  but I find it a nice change of pace.

Overall, I found the staff at the Sanderson to be very friendly, the room to be small but not necessarily cramped, and the the bed to be very comfortable.
I liked the layout of the room with the desk seated behind the bed-   it gave me enough space to get some work done without impeding on space to get dressed.  Wifi is an additional charge and is a little on the expensive side (~12 GBP if I recall).

The bathroom of the Sanderson is completely open and was my least favorite detail.  I'd prefer not to worry about water from the shower spilling over into the rest of the bathroom.  One other pet peeve-  there is lots of merchandise for sale in the bathroom and there were a few moments where I wasn't sure what was complimentary and what I'd be charged for.

The Sanderson got great marks though for its attention to little details.  Calling down for a wake-up call, I was asked whether I wanted coffee with my wake-up call.  Sounded great.  Sure enough, about 3 minutes after my call, there was a knock at the door and a carafe of coffee.

The lobby bar of the Sanderson was great for a after-work drink before dinner.  Returning after dinner, it had transformed into something a little too clubby for me, but there was plenty of space in the lobby to sit and have a somewhat quiet conversation.

Location is very good if you want to be in Soho though the Sanderson sits on a fairly quiet street.",4,2010,06,01
132,Hated it,"Modern overkill. A bed in the middle of the room, bizare ripped curtains, flooding bathrooms, fuzzy flatscreen TV and phones that don't work. The staff is only helpful when it comes to getting a car or cab. The staff recommended a horrible tour group, booked the wrong tour for us, knows the location of almost nothing near the hotel and pretty stupid when offering options to get to the airport. I would only recommend this hotel to people that plan to spend some late nights at the happening Suka Bar in the lobby.",2,2010,05,23
132,Overpriced for just ok,"I was really looking forward to staying at this hotel. And then I read the reviews and I thought there were just people being fussy. Let me start from the beginning.
The hotel is conveniently located, very close to Goodge street tube station (5 minutes) and only a short walk from Oxford. I don't see how some other people felt that it was very far from the tube.
The lobby is impressive and unique. Staff were friendly. The lifts are really funky and unusual. Our room key was not working, but not a huge deal. The room was very minimalistic. Shower and bathroom was more than nice, however all the item looked old (rotten sink etc).
Bed was the most uncomfortable I've ever slept in. Really hard, couldn't get to sleep (and trust me, I can sleep mostly anywhere). No coffee making facilities, which was really annoying (particularly for all the money we paid) and an Icelandic bottle of water - ironic because of the next day's potential cancellation of my flight (things need to be thought PR-wise).
Generally, I found that style was overpowering comfort. Lots of TV channels available, but everything seemed to be charged on top of, which for the money we paid, is not good enough. Everywhere in the room there were sealed things (CDs, candles etc.) that you could purchase.
Staff overall very helpful, immediately responding to our questions. Finally, the gym was really good, well equipped with everything. There was only one steam room available, which for a spa, is a bit not enough (a jacuzzi, or a sauna, would have been nice).
Overall this is one of the hotels that were funky at some point, but it now looks tired. Having said that, we really enjoyed the bar and the outdoor area. I've stayed at other morgan hotels and this is definitely the weakest of all for the money.
And finally, I find it really good that the management seems to have responded to all previous posts, but disappointing that every review has rated this hotel as average.",3,2010,05,17
132,Overpriced Travelodge,"This hotel is great for a group of young people as they let you throw private parties in your room in the middle of the night and sleeps over 10 people in a standard room. The walls are very thin so it’s great if you don’t want to get any sleep.

One would hope that staying in a 5* hotel there would be a certain calibre of guests staying!!!

The room was more standard then minimalistic, with a bit of the dirty old cloth separating the bathroom and the light (that lit it up) did not work. The bed looked like it was from an IKEA advert and the bathroom had damp marks and was not practical. Especially seeing as you had to hang your clothes up in the bathroom!

Overall I felt like I had stayed in an overpriced Travelodge. I wouldn't have thought this hotel was any more than a 3*. I couldn’t wait to leave.  

It does not live up to expectations of a 5* hotel!",1,2010,04,27
132,Fab but Noisy at Night,Deluxe room exceeded expectations. Large stylish and comfortable. Long bar and purple bar great. Only problem is that the courtyard has been covered with a tacky plastic tent to accommodate more local drinking office workers and is extremely noisy in the courtyard facing bedrooms. Luckily we were in the bar until quarter to one after a great spanish meal at Finos nearby and the bar shuts shortly after 1. Dont have a courtyard room if you want a good nights sleep! Would stay again though.,4,2010,04,09
132,Trendy but so far from the tube,"Nice hotel, trendy, nice people (so many vips during our stay, if you are interested), nice rooms, overpriced if you don't have a special offer like us that usually stay at morgans hotel groups. The only problem is the distance (15 min walking) from the nearest tube station, when is raining it's a problem. The staff is really nice and friendly. VERY BAD TO PAY FOR INTERNET ACCESS WHEN YOU PAY MORE THAN 300 POUNDS/NIGHT.",3,2010,04,06
132,Too try hard,"This is a lovely hotel, but there's something a bit too try-hard about it.  It's pretentious and a bit tasteless rather than effortlessly chic (ie the naked woman 'walking'  It all feels a tad preposterous instead of the height of cool... I hated the bathroom separated by the curtain in the rooms.  Our ipod docking station didn't work, and why do you need weights in the rooms?!  Still, there was a general sense of luxury and touches of true sophistication.",3,2010,04,06
132,just poor,"Not the sort of place where you would want to spend your night. This self-proclaimed 5 star hotel would struggle to get 3 stars in any reasonable classification scheme. 

We stayed in a Deluxe King room on the 4th floor, which looked amazing on the website. In reality, the parquet turned out to be plain creaking floorboards, the bathroom fittings looked cheap (including plastic toilet seat + lid, and partly painted over glass panes), and the cupboards were DIY. There was a huge limescale stain around the washbasin and mould growing underneath the glass table.

Despite having paid extra for a late check-out and having put out a 'do not disturb' sign, hotel staff tried to enter our room three times on the day of departure.

We can confirm other reviews regarding the level of noise at night.",1,2010,04,04
132,"Most stylish hotel bar, with buzz & great  atmosphere in Central London","Really enjoyed this excellent and stylish hotel. During weekend which we were there, the buzz and the atmosphere in the ""Long Bar"" was great fun, good music, good atmosphere, full of the 'beautiful set' and delightfully interesting company. Food & restaurant good if you like activity in bar nearby. Not Cheap, but worth it and lots of fun. Terrific location, terrific eye-candy and really enjoyable. Great outdoor area that feels like holiday zone rather than work buzz. Recommended for fun and laughs - rooms very stylish and swish - designed to impress. Like the ""touch"" with the apples in room and really enjoyed the stylish weights to help stretch. Clever. Thoughtful. Different.",5,2010,03,20
132,Style over comfort. 5star prices - 0star customer service,"As trendy as the rooms are, they are tiny with hardly any storage space and no bath. The toilet is separated from the rest of the room by a glass wall which suddenly pushes your relationship to the next level of intimacy regardless of your intentions. In addition to this the room had a potent musty odour.

For the one night we stayed, we were kept awake till 3.30am by noisy neighbours. It took the front desk over an hour to quieten them down. We were then woken early by the strong smell of cigarette smoke coming from an adjacent room.

The service at breakfast was slow and dismissive.
 
On checking out we weren't asked the standard question: Was everything ok with your stay?  We had to prompt the member of staff and tell her our grievences. On complaining about the smell, we were told we were on a smoking floor - although we were never given the option when checking in. They didn't apologize for their massive oversight and the apologies made for the early morning noise, the slow response to the complaint and the poor breakfast service was half hearted. In addition to this, nothing was offered by way of compensation. 

We were told that someone from management would be in touch the next day to discuss the issue further and and if we ever decided to stay with them again, they would try to do something for us.

This was appalling customer service from this so-called ""5star"" hotel.  Our day out in London was ruined by the terrible night's sleep. We left with our clothes and luggage smelling of cigarettes and we were given no real apology or compensation. 3 weeks on, we have still not heard from the management of the Sanderson. And there is no way we would ever consider staying there again.",1,2010,03,12
132,"Truly unique, stunning hotel with exceptional service","My partner and I stayed here for one night last week to celebrate his birthday, and had an absolutely fantastic time. The group which owns the Sanderson also owns several well-known hotels around the world, such as the Mondrian and Delano in Miami – so if you have been to one of those, you will know what to expect. The hotel is a spectacular feat of design: the lobby is sleek and airy with Dali inspired furniture; the interiors of the lifts are hologramic pictures of space – great fun;  and both the Long Bar and the Purple Bar are extremely chic and innovatively designed. There is also a stunning Billiards Room, featuring a huge stained-glass wall across an entire room, in which you can play the game.

Our check-in was very smooth and friendly. I had telephoned the night before to ask if we could check in a little early, and this was accommodated. We were also upgraded, which was a nice surprise. 

Our room itself was stunning and absolutely unique; large with white walls, light wooden floors and a glass wall to the bathroom area, which made it extremely bright and airy. What made the room unique was that each detail contributed to make it a work of art. The king-sized bed, pedestal in the bathroom, artwork on the ceiling above the bed and shawl on the desk chair were all purposely set at an angle. There was even a small Philip Stark art installation/set of dumb-bells on the wall. The wall to the bathroom/dressing area was made entirely of glass, although there was a white curtain which could be pulled across for privacy.

The bed itself was comfortable, although not as comfortable as most hotels of a similar quality I have stayed in. The pillows were surprisingly hard and there was only one thin duvet which wasn’t quite warm enough for me. Apart from that, we had a very good, quiet sleep. Breakfast in the morning was enormous and delicious – fortunately it was included in our room as otherwise would have been extremely expensive.

We spent quite a bit of time in the Long Bar, both in the evening and during the day. The decor, staff and clientele were chic and gorgeous, as were the drinks. The atmosphere did turn rather sleazy later on in the evening, disappointingly, as it was very obvious that there were many women looking for business and men cruising around the bar looking to meet them.

All in all, we had a fantastic time at the Sanderson and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for something chic and a bit different to your usual 5* experience.",5,2010,03,08
132,Love It,"Me and my wife were here only yesterday. We loved the resturant (Sucka, Malay) and the Long bar (Vibrant atmosphere). Good food and drink, the best Saturday night for a long time...we be back there very soon.",5,2010,02,21
132,Don't try to sleep there,"At first glance, the hotel is gorgeous. The lobby is intriguing. The elevators are SPECTACULAR. The rooms are a white filmy dreamspace. But the bedsprings were hard, in spite of the fluffy mattress cover; the room was noisy overlooking the street; the light from the lit number panel on the floor outside shines brightly under the door into the room; and it takes a rocket scientist to get the toilet to flush. I found a good deal on price, but if I had paid full price I would have been very unhappy. Very hip bar scene. The Purple Bar, for hotel residents, is worth the detour for the Lavender martini (although very pricey). Suka, the Malaysian restaurant, is a real treat and not overpriced.",3,2010,02,20
132,Amazing - something truely different,"Got taken here as a surprise by my partner, and from the moment the all black clothed young handsome young men opened he care door and showed us into the hotel I knew I was in for a surprise !

From outside it doesn't look like a hotel ! its so discreet.

Reception was like being at the Guggenheim museum but was so laid back and I stretched out on this massive sofa in the most unusual shape.

Bedrooms were great ! totally blew me away - bed in middle of floor - painting on the ceiling - you name it, it had it.

The lifts were like being in a time machine wisking us away to another world. and that is exactly what it was. No bog standard here, the room numbers are in little light boxes on the floor.

Think hotel Babylon but smarter !

Loved the residents only bar - like Alice in Wonderland. Staff so attentive, you only had to tell them once what you drank and from them on, as you would come to the end of your drink they would very knfdly ask you (would you like a refreshment sir)

Restaurant was amazing, great food.

Did see the Long Bar which looked busy with a lot of wannabes as is non resident bu looked fun !

Totally fell in love with this place and wouln't even think twice where to go again for something special.

Max the card and feel special !",5,2010,02,11
132,Truly Hip,"If you can afford it, don’t miss this hotel. Its near everything you want to be near in London and the hotel is truly fun and hip. Just make sure to always have your room key, you will be asked for it a lot.",5,2010,02,04
132,lovely experience,"after a previous unhappy experience here

I would love the chance to try an evening meal here",4,2010,01,26
132,"Sexy, stylish hotel, great staff...","Stayed there for 9 nights including new years. Was a great experience. Location is very convenient. I really appreciate art, decor and style... this hotel gets full marks for that. Some people may not understand the style of this hotel so would move on to criticise the decor, very sad, I know.

Previous hotels where I have stayed in London include the Ritz, Dorchester, Lanesborough. The Sanderson is just different. I cannot honestly say it is superior to those hotels but it is without a doubt an experience in itself. 

Staff: extremely helpful, polite and very presentable.

Room: super sexy, always clean, spotless.

Concierge: brilliant and efficient.

New year's eve party was great.

Long Bar: Surreal. A great place to go to for drinks.

Purple bar: Exclusive for resident guests. Very nice touch.

Downsides: Room service prices are excessively high. 18% added gratuity PLUS GBP 3.5 per order! That is just ridiculous. Also, if you woke up in the middle of the night for some water, a bottle would cost you GBP 10!!!!

All in all, would definately like to stay there again.",4,2010,01,19
132,Great atmosphere and location,"I enjoyed this hotel -- the staff was nice ,the room was clean and stylish, and the location was great.",5,2010,01,15
132,Wow,"My wife and I recently stayed in London for a weekend break. After much searching and checking of hotels through various hotel websites I cam up with a short list of about 10. I then further reduced the list and I decided that we would stay in the Sanderson. It was all a surprise for my wife, hence the I part. Anyway, what can I say about the Sanderson - Wow Wow and Wow again. My wife said the room was the best hotel room she had ever stayed in. From our arrival on Friday evening at approx 7pm to our departure on Sunday morning we were treated exceptionally well. The front of house team from the receptionist to the concierge were always at our disposal and very courteous. This was also none in a non intrusive way which is something I really liked. The room was incredible. A fabulous open plan room with ensuite and bath. I had asked for some little extras and we had champagne to our room on arrival and candles in it. It all created the perfect ambience for the weekend. The location of the hotel was also very important in my choosing. 100 yds from Oxford St and all the shops you could want. Soho with the trendy bars and restaurants and of course Regent St. There was no buses/taxis etc over the weekend apart from to/from airport so that also meant alot. On Friday we dined in the Suka restaurant at the hotel. It was very nice but I will say that it is designed for the larger groupo of people but then it did say that when I was booking it. Anyway, the food was very well presented and again a real trendy ambience. The Sanderson is expensive but with forward planning there are some excellent deals on the hotels own website. Also, you get what you pay for! In summary for a romantic weekend for yourself and your partner, if you are going to London, book the Sanderson. You will not be dissapointed",5,2009,12,17
132,Style over content,"Booked via lastminute (and paid) yet we had to hang around for half an hour while they found our bookings. Basin had no plug and none was available in the hotel - odd as every house has them. Glass walls to bathroom means everyone wakes up when the bathroom light comes on in the night. Bar is chic but sleazy later - we talked to the pimp and some of the girls who 'work' there. On the plus side, the breakfast was A1 and the spa excellent. Expensive for what it is though",3,2009,12,11
132,super cool hotel,"The Sanderson is one of the coolest hotels in London, great design / cool bar. 
A must go I would say....",5,2009,11,30
132,Amazing hotel,"Beautiful place, like it's sister hotel at St Martin's Lane, very hip, trendy and noisy! Perfect if it's the sort of thing you're looking for, which we were. Lovely food as well.",5,2009,11,28
132,"Unique, but a bit sterile.","This hotel had it's fun points: cool decor in lobby, good breakfast, hip style. However, some points that could be improved on:

Evening noise from bar in lobby.
Lack of privacy in bathroom.
No walls in spa = noise from sitting room during massage. (Not cool.)
Occasionally less than helpful staff at front desk. (Though mostly were fine.)

I got this hotel as part of a charity auction. Paid a lot for it, but for a good cause. Wouldn't pay for this hotel rack rates - doesn't seem worth it. However, overall experience was satisfactory.",4,2009,11,22
132,Quirky and fun but expensive,"I recently stayed at the Sanderson with my best friend on their Suka package in a deluxe room.  I'd heard about the Sanderson from friends and had been recommended to try it.  

On pulling up outside the hotel it looked like a converted 60's or 70's office building but on entering the lobby it was very quirky with a lot of interesting decor items that added a fun ambience.  We arrived just after noon and I thought I'd try my luck to check in and luckily a room was available.  The check in guy was very helpful and even gave us an upgrade to a room with a treadmill - not so useful when I was on a girls week-end and the last thing on my mind was workng out - but it came in handy for flinging clothes over!
After check in we flew up to our room (via the fun space lift) to drop our bags off and I was pleased with first impressions upon entering the room - again quirky and fun styling! I loved the big sleigh bed on an angle and the weird egg shaped footstool? is it a footstool?

We headed off to shop and did not get back to the hotel until very late afternoon.  We grabbed a nap and then got ready for the evening ahead.  For two lady friends sharing the room all the amenities were perfect and we were both able to get ready without getting in each other's way - plenty of room to move about in the actual room plus in the bathroom and wardrobe area.

Once ready we headed down to the long bar which was already packed at 7.30pm on a Saturday night.  We had to wait several minutes to be served and I was not able to open a tab that could be transferred to the Suka restaurant where we were eating that evening.  So we had to close the bar tab, open a new one in the restaurant then close that when we had finished eating and open a new one to have an after dinner drink back at the long bar - something I can perhaps understand for non residents who might abscond but a pain in the b*tt for a resident.  Suka is about 10 feet from the long bar!

Dinner in the Suka restaurant was OK - nothing fabulous and not anywhere I would rush back to given the price.  We asked the server's advise on how many dishes we should order for 2 people and were advised 6 - 3 for starter and 3 for main plus 2 sides.  Having not eaten there before we did not know the portion size so we went with the advice we had been given - it turned out to be far too much and we could have got by with 4 dishes in total without any sides.  We had to leave 3 dishes completely untouched - a waste when we're talking nearly £10 a dish!  Flavour and presentation wise the food was good but not great - hence my comment about not rushing back.  I've had better meals at local Asian cuisine restaurants.

After our meal we headed back to the bar which by now was heaving.  I waited about 10 minutes to be served and had to work very hard to catch someone's eye to order a drink even though they did not appear to be rushed off their feet.
The bar had a great atmosphere - lots of 'beautiful people' but none with attitudes.

In summary the stay was fun but expensive - the Suka credit against the room rate was a godsend given the price of the meal and the food we did not eat.  The overall cost was justifiable if you are splitting it with a friend but I would struggle to hand over my credit card for one night with my husband  when we would take the hit together.
The hotel is interesting, quirky and I would recommend to friends if they have deep pockets.",4,2009,11,20
132,Pleasant and Unique Hotel,"This relatively small hotel is not what I would have chosen, as I typically enjoy brass and glass hotels.  Nevertheless, I was quite impressed by the hotel.  The staff is superb, the rooms are nothing short of immaculate, and contrary to some other comments, the hotel is rather quiet.  Sheer curtains separated sections of my very large (even by American standards) room.  Room service was promptly served.  I wouldn't recommend this hotel for families with kids, but it's great for couples and business travelers.",5,2009,11,14
132,"Appalling, waste of time and money","I have signed up to Trip Advisor to warn you not to waste your time or money at this appalling establishment.  An expensive mistake on my part to book a night away in London to celebrate a special occasion.  The staff try there best however the poor, high handed management ruin their efforts.  We had two experiences at the Suka restaurant which were bearable however room service was over prices and inedible.  Unfortunately we were woken during the night by a fire alarm, there was complete lack of care and organisation for residents and the only member of staff that we saw during the experience stunk of a alcohol- thank goodness it seems it had only been a false alarm!",1,2009,11,14
132,"best for cocktails, not for accomodation","Great bar, not so great rooms-didnt eat there.We often go uptown from Kent to hit the better eating venues etc.
We stay at the best hotels as it is our hobby.We have stayed at other hotels in this chain but found this room far too small and so noisey sleep was not possible",3,2009,11,09
132,The Price of Awkward Design,"This was my second stay at the Sanderson.  I had previously forgiven its hipster quirkiness since I love staying at cool ""design hotels"".  But this time...I found so many little annoyances, that it pretty much added up to one BIG feeling of frustration.   I'm all for 'intentional imperfection"", but the vanities and the artwork are askew enough to look like a mistake.  I'm also a petite 5'2"" woman...and yet, I keep running into table corners, the glass partitions that are slightly too wide, and the bathroom doors that are slightly too narrow.  I felt like Alice in Wonderland on a very mild acid trip.  What's the point?

If you are traveling for business, get ready to throw your computer out the window.  The connection is so slow and craps out so often, that you're liable to lose all your work.  (Which is why I've had to write this review 3 times!)  I made several calls to the front desk, and just got the run-around and never got any help.  I'm sorry, but in 2009, I have to dock any 5-star hotel for charging $15/day for wireless.

The spa and the gym is lovely, however.  For me, a spa freak, it is its saving grace.  I was disappointed though that I have been denied my Eve Lom facial several times because they are always overbooked.  So plan well in advance.

Also, bring your own music and movies.  I submitted a list of about 10 from their library, and got 3 of my least preferred back.

Again, this is not a horrible hotel and it does have a trendy vibe.  But by 5-star standards, it's a bit frustrating, especially when one compares to the impeccable service and attention in 5-stars in Asia.  It reminds me a lot of the Soho Grand or Paramount in NY...where the hype keeps it alive.

I would love this hotel to redeem itself to me!",3,2009,11,07
132,Exceeded My Expectations,"I was somewhat apprehensive prior to arrival owing to the mixed reviews. However all aniexty was immediatly alleviated on arrival.

My partner and I are both of  Afro-Carribean descent and frequent many high end establishments whereby our presence, is often less then welcoming :-(

This was the complete opposite with The Sanderson Staff. Infact they were extremely friendly and welcoming.

The receptionist, was extremely patient and accomodating, as you are required to place a deposit (something i was not informed at the time of booking), we were able to pay cash, with the deposit paid with a debit card. We were not made to feel awkward. I believe the receptionist name name was Inja..(30/10 was the date , i am not sure if i remember her name correctly and its only fair that she receives due praise)

Further we were upgraded to a Deluxe King (breakfast included) as it was my birthday. With which i was truly elated, I have never had anything like that happen to me before :=)

Loved the lift and on entering room 404 i was suitably impressed. The huge sleigh bed, the super white, minimalist interior and the lcd large screen tv, where all immediately noticable.

I must say the room was spotless, no dirt in sight, which is remarkable for an all white Decor.

The bathroom i loved, its sexy and clean. Visible from the sleeping area if you use just the white curtain, but can be concealed with usage of both the pink and white curtain. 

Complimentary toilitries are provided, shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. (make sure you bring toothbrush & toothpaste, thankfully we did). A bathrobe and slippers are also provided with compliments for the duration of the stay.

I would give the room/bathroom a 9/10.

The shower needs a shelf and the enclosed toilet would be perfect if it automatically freshened on the toilet flushing), the light switches are so far away once in the bed and a remote of some sort which controlled the lighting,temp and curtains would be much appreciated.

Tea and coffee making facilities are much needed also. We ordered room service for tea and coffee, but we would have much preferred to make our own.

Aside from that, it was a Friday night, both the long bar and purple bar were popping (slang for full and lively..lol), yet our room was sooo quiet, no transferrance of noise which was fantastic.

We dined out, partner wanted a steak, on return the doorman remembered us and us greeted with a smile. 

The atmosphere was cool, alot of well dressed young trendy types. No pretension noticed, but then i wouldn't notice that as i am appreciative of a young gorgeous trendy and well dressed scene.

My boyfriend loved it, we hung out in the Billiard room, the fellow guests were also mostly very friendly.

Having had a good night sleep, in that divine bed, nice firm mattress and the pillows were just right. I woke up alot earlier then my partner. I decided to check out the AGua spa...woooow is all i can say. Its all white, with silver furnishings etc. The receptionist was lovely and she lead me to the steam room and dressing area. Plenty of water with fresh lemon slices,ice, magazines,iced flannels near the steam room to ensure that you can suitably relax in the environment. Great for a morning after a big night out. Very cleansing and detoxifying.

We went down to breakfast, it was busy and the staff again was faultless. Very attentive and ensured that that we had eveything we need. Breakfast is held in the Suka resturant, which alongside the rest of the hotel has a fab decor.

Check out was effortless, i was actually owed money, the receptionist offered to keep our bags behind the desk, if he were going to do more shopping.

All in all we had a fabulous stay, we live in London, but it really is an Urban Retreat with a very cool, contemporary, liberal vibe to it.  So it really is possible to have a mini break in your own city.

 We will be returning, but for longer then one night and i plan to use the Agua spa for days when i just need to get away from it all,",4,2009,11,01
132,Signed up..Just for this,"Wanted a weekend away in Semptember and as family members had stayed previously I thought I would book the Sanderson. Really pleased I did and having read, but never used, this website before I felt the need to sign-up to post this review. Fantastic hotel, it's ""a little different"" in a very positive way, cool, chic, superb location and I spent the following few days telling everyone how different and cool it was - especially the lifts! Really enjoyed the stay, reasonably priced and will certainly be back on the next visit to London. I have had no hesitation in recommending to friends. Great hotel.",4,2009,10,29
132,.,"A lavish ""Urban Spa"" in the heart of London’s West End, Sanderson offers a retreat from the bustle of the city into a world of fantasy and wellbeing. The landmarked 50s building has been transformed by Philippe Starck into a surreal Cocteau-like dream world, epitomizing a “new luxury” that is smart, pared down, and tempered with a healthy dose of wit and irony.",5,2009,10,17
132,Potentially great but let down by service,"The good side of the Sanderson:
We had high hopes of a stay to remember when arriving at the Sanderson for a short spa break and an afternoon at the Agua Spa got us off to a promising start; the team were fantastic and had us both de-stressed in no time! The room was stylishly minimal and some miracle worker manages to keep all of those white walls free from the usual scuff marks that even the best hotels gather over time. For the evening we had a quick drink in the Purple Bar (intimate but friendly) followed by an amazing dinner at Suka - great food in a relaxed atmosphere.

The bad side of Sanderson:
Unfortunately first impressions last and the check-in experience at the Sanderson left a lot to be desired. Having arrived at 1pm our room wasn't available until 5pm but instead of the basic courtesy that you'd get at the lowliest of b&b's, we were left with the distinct impression that our desire for a room was an unwelcome intrusion into their primary role as uber-cool style icons. Happily this aloof attitude did not extend beyond the front desk but it sets the scene and subsequently being pleasantly surprised by good service can't be a good sign!

Overall we'll most definitely be going back to the spa and to Suka but we'll be sleeping at a different hotel when we do.",3,2009,10,15
132,The Sanderson in London is Incredible.,"From the incredibly stylish entrance, bar and cathedral with pool table to the chic and innovative choices and detail paid to the guest suites, the Sanderson in London by far is one of the most comfortable, convenient and hip properties I have encountered in my travels.  

The staff is friendly and dedicated to service - as I was stepping out of my black cab I was greeted by name, until my room was ready they took my luggage and sent me off to the spa on the 2nd floor.  

Room service within 20 minutes generally, and an in-suite bar selection you would expect from Morgans Group (Generous quantities of ""Top Shelf"" Liquors and Beers, Wines and aperitifs).  My one tiny complaint is the  Exclusive Hotel Guests Only Bar - ""Purple Bar"", doesn't carry Jack Daniels, it's simply not fancy enough!

While staying In London for 26 nights, it didn't take long for the Sanderson to become my home away from home.   All I can say now is that I'm homesick for Sanderson!

Bottom Line -  It's a great destination that won't disappoint - Business & Pleasure combined.",5,2009,10,13
132,A certain idea of Perfection,"It was my second stay at the Sanderson and this time everything was perfect from the beginning to the end (since my last stay, the rooms are maybe a little bit ""tired"" but the new LCD screens are definitely a great touch, the concept is still refreshing and all the Staff was absolutely perfect and friendly from the beginning to the end - except the concierge that did not allowed us to make pictures in the lobby).
 
I usually come severall times in london (about a week each time, for leisue puposes) and I usually let an apartment in the middle of SOHO. Our last stay at sandersons was so nice that, maybe, next time we could plan to stay there (even though it would be a more expensive ""option"").

The concept of the hotel is still perfect and you really are as in an ""urban retreat"". The contrast between the public area and the room is very refreshing and it is a real place to unwind. The turn down service with the candel lighten and all the room modified takes a great part in that sensation.

The locastion is very convenient and quiet.

Whe had the chance to be upgraded (as former clients of the hotel) and it was a great touch. Moreover, breakfast was included in our rate and it was absoulutely perfect. Do not hesitate to try it. The cold part was very luxurious (real fresh fruit, luxury jam, absolutely amazing pastries) and the hot part was completly fitted to our requirement (you can order everything what you want, even in term of cooking).

This night at the Sanderson was the last night of our holidays and it was perfect and allow us to forget that it was the end !",5,2009,10,13
132,Amazing Experience - One of the Best Properties I've Ever Stayed,"My time at the Sanderson was too short.  From the moment I stepped foot in this property, I was treated like royalty, and that experience lasted until the moment I left.

I booked one night at the Sanderson via the Morgans Hotel Group website, mainly because I am a huge fan of their other properties.  I've always enjoyed the Mondrian in Los Angeles, and the Clift in San Francisco, and thought that since I would be in London, I would check out another.  While the hotel rate could not be qualified as ""budget,"" it certainly was much less expensive that choices like the Four Seasons, Berkeley, or Mandarin Oriental.  I had booked a standard room, and planned for a wonderful stay as a solo traveler.

I arrived at the Sanderson on foot, after taking the tube to the Oxford Circus station.  It is only a short walk from the station to the hotel (maybe 10 minutes total), and in a very populated shopping area (no chance of ever feeling like you are walking through a ""shady"" neighborhood at night).  Upon walking into the hotel, I felt like I was in another world.  The furniture was incredibly unique and fun, and while I would certainly consider the lobby ""minimalist,"" everything worked well together.  Since I had arrived around 12:00pm, I was informed my room was not available yet (check-in time is at 3:00pm, as are most other properties in the world), and I was apologized to for the inconvenience.  I gave the young lady my mobile number, checked my bags at the hotel, and went to do a little shopping.  The employees of the Sanderson quickly learned my name, and upon returning to the hotel about an hour later to use the restroom, I was greeted by first name whenever I walked past someone I had already met.

Around 1:30pm I received a phone call saying my room was ready.  I went back to the check-in desk, and the same young lady apologized once again for me having to wait (no apology necessary in my mind, as I was 3 hours early for check-in anyway).  She had informed me she upgraded me to a ""loft"" room, which was beyond words to describe.  Another employee came out with my bags, introduced himself, and helped me to my room.  The elevators are very unique in this hotel as they all include a sort of ""outer space"" vibe, but still maintain an antique London quality.  My room was on the first floor, only a short walk from the elevator.  The hallways, while dark, are very private and unique, and all room numbers are labeled in lights on the ground (a nice change from the typical number on the door).

Upon entering my room, I was blown away.  A HUGE bed in a sort of ""sleigh"" frame, hardwood floors, curtains instead of walls (all controlled by a button on the wall instead of having to pull the curtains around), and a gorgeous shower and bathtub for lounging in.  Behind the bed was a very functional desk, and two nightstands included a complimentary bottle of water and a few fun facts about the hotel.

I decided to inquire at the Agua Spa down the hall whether a massage appointment would be available, and was pleasantly surprised that I could schedule one within two hours.  The cost was around 75GBP, which I considered very reasonable for a high-end property (I usually would not pay so much, but since this was a short vacation, I thought I'd splurge).  I took advantage of the steam room, calming room, and the delicious flavored water before heading in for my massage.  I will say, of all the massages I've had in my life, this had to be a favorite.  It was not at all rushed, the masseuse was friendly and engaging, and knew exactly where to focus her attention.  I certainly would return to this spa.

After dinner, I decided to take advantage of the Purple Room and Longbar that the hotel offers.  The Purple Room is a guests-only ""lounge"" where drinks are served.  Your name is checked against a list of registered guests at the door, and a very dark, yet fun room awaits.  There were only two other guests when I entered (the space is not huge, but is large enough to probably hold 40 or 50 guests), and a very friendly waitress recommended a nice beverage for me to try.  As expected, the beverage was delicious, and while not cheap by any standards, I found it to be reasonably priced.  Since I was a solo traveler, the waitress engaged in fun conversation, and I never felt like I was lonely in this space (the other guests that were in the Purple Room were couples, so not much of a chance to meet other solo travelers).  I was informed the Purple Room is open to 3AM, which is a nice treat in case you are in the market for a late-night drink or snack.

Afterwards, I decided to visit the Longbar, just to see the atmosphere.  The Longbar is a ridiculously long (I'd guess 80 feet or so) bar with fun furniture and exciting music.  It was crowded as can be for a Thursday night, but I was able to easily get one of the bartenders' attention and order a beverage.  Like the Purple Room, I found the Longbar to be full of couples and business groups; I did not come across any other solo travelers.  I would not necessarily recommend it to anyone looking to meet someone new, but I would just for fun conversation with others, or just for a fun atmosphere.  There was also an outdoor lounge (covered under a huge canopy) which you could enjoy, as well as a restaurant in the hotel that I heard was delicious, though I did not try myself.

Even as the night progressed, hotel employees addressed me by name and were always courteous, and I could not have been more pleased.  I returned to my first floor room (I could not hear any music from my room, even though I could see the outdoor patio and the Longbar out my window), and did a little work.  Everything in the room was very functional and easy to use, and the room was incredibly spacious.

Check-out was just as simple a process, and while I did not take advantage of breakfast in the hotel or room service, I feel the food would have been delicious (based on what I had heard from other guests).

The Sanderson truly is a gorgeous property with a fun, friendly, engaging staff, and a must-see for those visiting London looking for a high-end property without going overboard on price.  My only comment was the difficulty in using the Wifi (it required going to the front desk and requesting a physical username/password from them), as I wish it would be as simple as logging on from the room and having it charged directly to me.  Repeat guests had complained the rooms were in need of a renovation as the property is almost ten years old, though since this was my first stay, I found everything to look fresh and new, and was not the least bit tired of the design by the time I left.

Highly recommended to all.",5,2009,10,08
132,2nd Wedding Anniversary Stay,"I booked into the Sanderson on one of their special packages called the Suka package - which gave me a double room and £100 credit in their Suka restaurant for £270 (excluding VAT) as a second wedding anniversary celebration.

First impressions of the location - very close to oxford street - very well positioned but quiet enough to seem as though you were not near the bustle. The outside of the hotel looked like a shabby old tower block but once inside my opinions quickly changed - very cool lobby area and the lady on reception very helpful and professional. The room was not ready but she said she would call me when it was - which she did as promised. 

The room was very stylish - the lighting in the corridors get your eyes used to very dark spaces then as you enter the room BAM flooded with light and white style fittings. All added to the feeling.

We ate in the restaurant - i wouldnt rush back there - very pricey for what you are getting not that we had an eye on the money but looking back the dishes were heavily overpriced for what they actually were. That said they were tasty enough. All said and done a nice evening meal and a couple of drinks in the long bar which was starting to liven up by the time we finished our meal. 

Didnt have breakfast there as i have this major thing about £25 per person for hotel breakfasts - the wife hates it and call me what you want but i just cant handle it!!!!!! So we went round the corner and had bacon rolls and croissants with tea and coffee, plus a nice morning stroll where we sampled the delights of the tramps morning bin scavenging for their breakfast. Sad to see.

All in all a nice hotel experience but looking back i would have much rather stayed in a £100 hotel and spend £200 on a really good night out.

Enjoy it once but not somewhere i dream of going back to!

Hope this helps.",4,2009,10,01
132,"So, So, So Cool!","Oh my god I'm so hip!
There is no doubt about the pure Euro chicness and trendiness of this Morgan's Group property. If you like slick and happening this place is where you need to be; equipped with  a couple bars, a purple pool table a lobby with very modern aesthetics and happening restaurant this place goes the distance.
The room was a curtain lovers dream for where walls and doors might traditionally be  there are lights translucent curtains. The bed was very comfortable and the painting of the English country side above it was a humorous touch. The shower was of good pressure and the fixtures up  to the moment. The wash basin mirror however was oddly placed, making shaving a bit more of a challenge than it ever has to be.
We had breakfast through Room Service twice and it was rather standard. The important thing was it was on time, and hot.
The concierge was professional though I wish they had steered us away from York & Albany which the Hotel supports through their guest guide.
The area where the hotel is located is pretty lively and within walking distance from many shops and some theater as well as an Underground stop.

A couple side notes the bar does get loud and if you are roomed on the court yard you will hear the crowd and the music until about midnight; the gentleman who checked us in had informed us about this before hand so it wasn't a bother at all. We visited the Purple bar which is more of a small lounge to have a couple drinks in before we headed out to dinner. I ordered their Brooklyn (which is a Manhattan made with Sazerac) and while the beverage was very good I got a bit of a surprise when I ate the cherry; there was a pit inside! The bartender was more concerned with explaining how awesome he was because they use fresh cherries and prepare them in their own liquors and such and didn't really see the problem with a cherry where the pit is not expected to be. I hate to sound like a tool but I would have liked a warning.
Anyway if you are going to stay at a Morgan's Group Hotel in London, the Sanderson is my pick over St. Martin's Lane.",4,2009,09,16
132,Mixed Feelings,"My initial apprehension as we approached the time of our stay at the Sanderson was heightened when we arrived at the entrance of the hotel directly from Heathrow after a 12 hour flight, and there was nothing to signify it was a hotel entrance, no porters nor doormen to welcome us or, at least, to help us with our luggage. It was 6.30pm. Finally, after struggling with our luggage and practically kicking the front door open, we were met with...
nothing....
but funky designer furniture pieces... and a smart-looking bar to our right and the front desk on our left.
Determined not to be put off, this being the first holiday my husband and I have had together for a while, we approached the front desk. Perhaps my experience with Asian 5 star hotels has coloured my opinion but I've always felt that notwithstanding the decor of the hotel, how funky, cool or avant garde it may be, the friendliness/sincerity of the reception/front desk staff should be a priority. But this was not to be. We had an adequate reception. Enough said.

Things started to look up when the young bellhop led us to the strangely incongruous lift darkened with scenes of space, the Final Frontier..., and apologised that he had not been there to help us with the luggage as he was assisting another batch of guests. His sincerity and warmth was a contrast to our initial reception.

The room door opened directly into the bathroom and dressing area with a lovely freestanding bathtub to the left and glass-walled water closet & shower cubicle at the end. A white sink bowl sat atop an orange venetian glass vanity and a mirror floated above slightly to the side suspended from the ceiling. Filmy white curtains formed the ""doors"" to the glass shelving and hanging space on the right with a fluorescent uplit floor (presumably so that your designer shoes would look very cool!). 

The bellhop carefully went through the ins and outs of the room, stressing gently that there was an opaque curtain behind the transparent curtain that served to block the bathroom from the bedroom for the purposes of modesty, since the walls in the bathroom were transparent too. These curtains worked at a touch of a conveniently placed buttons.

Ample storage space was found behind white cupboards along the length of the wall of windows, and the expected amenities such as soaps, robes, hairdryer and umbrellas were artfully placed in frosted plastic boxes or directly on the glass shelving at the dressing area.

However, despite promising he would return with an extra luggage rack for us, our bellhop was not seen again till we checked out 4 days later.

The silver and white leather bed was positioned at an angle to the room and directly above it on the ceiling was a silver framed landscape painting. A grey pashmina was provided on the white duvet and the silver & glass writing desk was set behind the bed's headboard. A white spanish shawl was draped over the white office chair, presumably for use. Silver bedside tables, another white chair, a silver chair with wings and a tall mirror made up  most of the other extra furnishings - slightly eclectic but functional.
Together with our upgrade came a treadmill (however, in our country, it is known as clothes horse) and the management thoughtfully provided us a bottle of mineral water, a bottle of wine and a daily newspaper. No slippers, though, but we survived. The adjustable airconditioning was a godsend as it was London, and there are good days and better days. 

If we had not needed to engage the services of the hotel staff, for instance, at check-in, the porter service at check out (they were reminded twice, and please note that the response of ""oops, I forgot"" is not an impressive one), and concierge services to leave a gift to be collected 2 days later which went MISSING until several visits and calls ensued, I'll have to say that I enjoyed my stay. The service was really nothing to write home about for a hotel that brags about its coolness. A cool hotel is one that manages to serve their guests as if it's the one thing on earth they were put there for. The staff here, with the exception of the porter, the doorman and a couple of housekeeping staff, seemed to feel that it was their job to act cool.

All in all, a new experience for me, as I've never been stopped at the entrance of my hotel to be asked whether I was staying there although it all made sense when I remembered that it was a Friday night and that the Sanderson housed one of the ""cool-er"" bars in London, with all and sundry trying to get in. Bouncers as doormen, what a novel idea! The Purple Bar also a legend in its right as it admitted only hotel guests. We never tried the Malaysian restaurant called Suka, as we had just arrived from...Malaysia; so I'm sorry that I have no comments in that regard, nor did we sample any of the other outlets as we took full advantage of the fact that the hotel was less than a few minutes' walk from Oxford St, Regent St, Bond St etc. with all those wonderful side streets, nooks and crannies. (Eg The tall doorman on our first morning, kindly directed us to a sweet Italian coffeeshop round the corner.)

I do think that it is time for a little bit of maintenance work to be done on the fittings and furnishings although I have no complaint but I can see why there have been comments regarding the room rate not being reflected in the upkeep of the hotel/rooms. If you enjoy the old world or traditional style of decor, this hotel is not for you.",4,2009,08,29
132,Dont even think of dining at the Suka or having a business dinner!!,"Hi,

I am a city lawyer and brought a colleague to the Sanderson hotel, Suka restaurant, yesterday. 

I thought I should write and let you know my experience. 

The decor of the place is lovely but the experience ends there. The food was awful and so was the service. 

I had to get up from the table twice / three times to get someone to assist us - something you really do NOT want to be doing at a business dinner. I ordered my second champagne cocktail and it arrived after 45 minutes and only once I had finally walked into the restaurant (I was sitting outside) and called the waiter again. 

The food was below standards - the lamb was leathery and I'm not sure if teh waiter noticed but we left most of it. The duck tasted as if it was from a smoked duck packet and had just been put on the fire to grill and the roti chanai tasted as if it had been made ages ago and heated up in the microwave. The skewers of beef were cold. To call this malaysian food is an absolute apology and disgrace. I didn't want to complain at the time as I was there with a business colleague and we just finally wanted to get out. I even had to get up again from the table to get the bill!!

When we got out of the hotel we asked for a black cab and were told that black cabs are very infrequent and were offered a mini cab which we refused (we were two girls and didnt want to take a mini cab).  We finally walked to find a cab and were met by very unpleasant elements. 

I have been to Asia de Cuba and stayed at the Hudson in NY and both have been great experiences...

I dont think I will ever want to bring a business colleague to the Sanderson again and certainly never for the food or the service! If this review can be passed on to the management that would be great - it might help the next unsuspecting person who goes there for a meal!!",1,2009,08,25
132,"Outdated, tired and noisy","This hotel was cool in 2002 but is way past its prime.  The bathroom had water damage, there was a 1990's treadmill in our room, and the spa space lacks privacy.   Overall, the decor is really tired and also not that well kept up.

We stayed on a Saturday night and had a flight out the next morning. We discovered that the music from the Long Bar is really loud until 1:30 am.  I'm not usually bothered by this kind of thing, but it was hilarious - it was so loud that the base was shaking the room, and we were on the 4th floor!  We asked to be moved, but the only available rooms were on the courtyard, and all rooms on the courtyard were equally loud. 

It also has a ""quaint"" (aka outdated) film delivery service. There is a DVD player and you order films off a menu. Sounds fun, but when you look at the selection of films, it's not. 

There are so many other great places in London, you should skip this. Visit the Long Bar for a drink, but don't stay here.",2,2009,07,28
132,overpriced,"It's a great location and the whole thing looks very trendy in a Michael Douglas sort of way. So much so, we decided to stay a night. On first glance, the room was impressive, all white waftiness and clinical design. Sort of net curtains meets Damian Hirst. Anyway, there were two dots of blood on the sheet. We should have complained (did mention it on the feedback) but by the time we'd discovered this 'scene of the crime', we'd already unpacked. Couldn't get the TV to work so had to call room service, who did come fairly quickly. The air conditioning was raging all night and we couldn't turn it off. We didn't really like the toilet being IN the bedroom. It is seperated by a frosted glass wall but you can still see your partners silouette, which is not romantic. If you're at all suceptible to stage fright, when peeing in front of your partner, best stay elsewhere. So far, we were able to laugh all this off but the killer came the next morning when any remaining shred of romance was swiftly despatched. Soon after our breakfast was delivered, someone knocked on the door to say have you finished? Then 5 minutes later, when a man with a hostess trolley asked us if we'd like to buy any alcohol (at 10.30am), then they knocked again for our breakfast dishes. We felt like shouting, ""OK, we get the point, you want us to leave"". We had two drinks each and the bill came to over £400. For this price, we'd have rather had a blood free, quiet room with a toilet that wasn't at the end of the bed. Call me old fashioned, I know.",2,2009,07,23
132,"Chic, funky, and central - you will love it here","I stayed here with my wife for a weekend.  I was a bit unsure about whether this would be one of those overly fussy places where everyone wants a tip for everything and hangs around like a nasty whiff.  Thankfully, there was none of that.  It was like 'we're there if you need us'.

The hotel is fantastic to look at when you walk in.  Very trendy.  The lift's are cool with a dark space theme and music playing.    The staff are very nice.  Professional and far more approachable than the stuffy types you can get at other upmarket hotels around the Park Lane area.

The Suka restaurant is great.  The food is sheer bliss.  A word of note though, you'll need to bring your wallet for this.   We thought it was a main meal sort of thing but it became apparent that each of the meals are 'tapas' style -and 3 dishes are recommended.   In my view, if you need 3 of these dishes, you're either extremely hungry, or have issues with eating.   The food itself is beautiful but each of these tapas range between about £12 up to a whopping £20-ish just for a single tapas style plate.

If you get 3 dishes, you're looking at c. £45 - £60 just for your main course dish(es).

The drinks are also very pricey.   c. £10 for a glass of wine.   £5 for a bottle of water.   £4.50 for an OJ.   Four of us ate (no dessert and two on soft drinks) and I was expecting the bill to come in at about £150.   It came to about £300 which when two are drinking soft drinks, works out at quite a lot.    Thankfully, the food was very good.

Overall, this is a great hotel.  Yes it's pricey but hey, you're staying at one of the nicest hotels in London that's unlke most hotels you'll ever stay in (in a positve way).  You know what you're letting yourself in for.    You will walk out of this hotel feeling like an A Lister, which let's face it, is why you'll be staying in this hotel in the first place.   It'd be a bit like buying a Bentley and complaining that it drinks too much juice.

Re the rooms, the funky theme continues.  Nothing like any other hotel I've stayed in but that's a good thing.   We had a superior room which was great.  I don't know what the standard rooms are like but in realirt, they're probably a bit on the small side but 1, you only need the room for a sleep and 2, the rest of the hotel more than makes up for it. 

If you want to treat yourself, I would highly recommend this hotel.   We would defintely return.

Thank you to the staff for making it a lovely weekend.",5,2009,06,28
132,Fantastic stay,"Just come back from 1  night stay in Loft balcony suite and highly recommend this modern, chic hotel right in the middle of where  you need to be in London. Fabulous room, great service from reception to bar staff and bellboy. Will return!!! Thank you.",5,2009,05,23
132,tatty all style no substance,"Very disapointing . Rooms where good looking but dirty.There were even specks of blood on the ladies lobby toliets.We cound,t check in to 15.00 and had to leave by 12.00 alot of money for not even 24hrs.Had two rooms which where booked last year but cound,t even get them on the same floor .For real service ,style and what a hotel of this calirber should be stay at The langhams",1,2009,05,22
132,i feel cool now,"I liked staying here - There is a modern design triumph everywhere you look. The service was friendly and competent. The location is very central. I stayed in room 129 and there was wifi from a neighboring building, so i avoided paying the annoying 15 pound charge for internet - yay! One thing i didn't like was that the gym was positively arctic from the blasting air conditioner! 
My younger co-worker (24 yrs) was definitely more enchanted than me, and i suspect this place is a hit with twenty somethings.",4,2009,05,13
132,Didn't quite meet expectations,"We stayed here for one night, on recommendation from friends. The location was excellent for shopping, easy access to underground car park, etc. I don't know quite what we were expecting, but the room just felt a bit too stark. Would probably be ok for some people (white walls, picture on ceiling), but we just didn't feel comfortable. Having the bathroom behind a curtain and the toilet in a glass box was just too much for us! - ok for some I'm sure, but was just lost on us! We didn't try the food, but the bar was definately fun. We've stayed at The Soho Hotel a few times, and next time we're in London we will return, we just felt so much more comforftable there, and love all the little extra touches.",3,2009,05,09
132,"Tired, tatty and overpriced","My partner and I spent one night at  this hotel for a romantic anniversary break - and we really chose the wrong hotel.  Although the photos on the web make it look funky and stylish, the bedrooms are simply former offices with a large bed in the middle. Yes the bed is very comfortable, and the bath and the shower are fine, but with thin, metal venetian blinds at the windows,  only one painting - on the ceiling - and white net curtains seperating the sleeping area from the bathroom, there really is no romance. 

 For some reason there was an old, cheap, grey pashmina thrown on the bed - the only reason I knew this was part of the room and not something left behind by a previous guest, was because we had to change rooms as our first one had a horrible smell. 

There are no tea or coffee making facilities - so it's very expensive room service for a cup of tea.   If you need to use the bathroom in the night, there is only one light switch which turns on all the lights, thus waking up your partner. And with no bedside light, you have to stumble in the dark to find that switch! Both the rooms and the hotel corridors looked tired and a bit tatty - maybe it is due for a refurbishment

The chairs in the famous Purple Bar are the size 5 year olds sit on at school - not comfortable!  Breakfast is great, but a long wait.  The saving grace is the wonderful staff - really friendly and helpful.",2,2009,05,07
132,Disappointing....,"I was really looking forward to our visit to the Sanderson and although it doesn't rate very highly on trip advisor I assumed it was so 'out there' that it was too different for the average visitor.  Yes, it has a very trendy bar which has a great vibe. Yes, the decor when you first arrive is quite stunning in that it is completely different to any hotel we've ever stayed in so that was quite refreshing.  The room (deluxe king) was very minimalist and again quite refreshing in its simplicity. BUT it just doesn't quite hit the spot because the quality of the furnishings when you look closely is quite poor (the low lighting hides any imperfections!).  For the price you pay for the room, you would expect face flannels wouldn't you?? And yes, they light a candle (tealight) for you on turndown. ... but that is it! I foolishly assumed that this quality of hotel would provide bottled water in the room.  No - we were charged £10 for a bottle of water.  And there are no coffee/tea making facilities in the room -  no doubt hoping that you will go downstairs and have one at a cost of £4 ...... We have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world and don't mind paying for good service and surroundings but somehow I felt a bit cheated here. I really wanted to love it.  I really really wanted to!  But I came away feeling like they just wanted to get as much money out of us as possible!   Mis-information about payment up front left a bit of a sour taste too..... On a more positive note, the hotel is located in a great position for central london and the concierge was great.  Go to the Long Bar for a cocktail before a  night out, but I would not stay at The Sanderson again - there are lots of other hotels where you are made to feel special and I didn't feel that here.",3,2009,05,05
132,"Good, but not outstanding - a shame....","Interior design is great, typical Stark, the ""space lifts"" are super cool.

Service ranged from a cool (verging on ice cold) reception welcome, to the bar manager dealing with a complaint extremely well.....

Room rate isnt cheap (expected), but everything is charged extra, including £5.95 to have a shirt ironed, £3 room delivery charge for room service, gratuity added to everything (unfortunately normal for London nowadays), £20 charge for the hotel driver to take us to as restaurant etc.....  

A bit irritating, ive never had those charges at other similar hotels ive stayed in - to me, thats why you pay to stay in a 5 star hotel, to benefit from all the comforts, service and amenities. 

We booked a Deluxe room which was a bit disappointing for the price (quite often the case in Morgans Group hotels i find), so we complained and received an upgrade to the Loft, which was more comfortable.

Overall, we did enjoy it, glad we tried it, although i wanted to love it, personally, its unlikely i would stay there again.",3,2009,04,15
132,Ultra hype hotel,"Minimalist and trendy, the Sanderson is great for anyone who like this kind of hype hotel.
Location: Berners street is only a few minutes walking from Oxford and Regent street. Perfect.
Great minimalist lobby with original sofas and chairs.
On the right the lobby bar, very much crowded on saturday night, but quite empty on sunday evening. Good music and ambiance.

Breakfast was good with a lot of choice.

The room was not huge, but with an incredible design: white curtains everywhere (even to separate the bathroom from the room), comfortable bed with a painting on the ceiling (never saw that before!).

Service was good for what I've asked.

The Sanderson is really a cool hotel, but if you like traditionnal luxury hotels, I understand that some people might not like this hotel.
I will certainly return, even if the rates are quite expensive.",5,2009,03,18
132,"Beautiful Hotel, Fantastic Location","Myself and my husband have just returned from another fantastic stay at the Sanderson Hotel. We stayed here back in 2001 shortly after it had opened and were extremely imnpressed with everything the hotel has to offer and were extremely pleased that absolutely nothing has changed over the years. The service is faultless, especially the conciege/doorman who were always polite and friendly (particularly one gentleman who welcomed us to the hotel on arrival and then helped us with a taxi 4 days later when we left and remembered exactly where we were returning too...impressive memory)!! 

The room was spotlessly clean and tidy with the same lovely touches (such as lit candles during the evening turn down service). The shower was amazing and the bed extremely comfortable)! 

Being fans of Phillipe Starcks work its great to walk through the reception area stopping to look at his pieces! Plus, the elevator is probably the funkiest I have ever seen!

We will not hesitate to stay here again (especially as we have a gauranteed upgrade the next time we stay, as a thank you and apology for experiencing a group of disrespectful guests who decided to shout and scream down the corridor at a ridiculous time of the morning. The upgrade was not necessary, as it was not the hotels fault, but a very kind gesture none the less).",5,2009,03,16
132,Fantastic concierge and overall great hotel,"Had a three nights stay at the Sanderson in August 2008. The hotel is very conveniently located near Oxford Street and the Theatre District. Liked the design and loved the breakfast (although it’s quite expensive if you don’t have it included in the room rate), but the best part was probably the excellent concierge service. Highly recommended, would not hesitate to return.",5,2009,03,14
132,I would NEVER stay here again or recommend the Sanderson!,"I booked the Sanderson as a suprise for my partner as it was his birthday, so I over indulged and booked the romance package which set me back over 800 for 2 nights so I expected damn good service for the money! Concierge was fantastic, managed to organise a cake for me beforehand which was ready for us on the night I requested. Reception did not even offer to help me with my luggage to my room, again which was dissapointing.. and then onto the worse bits...our room, I found a used shaving kit in the drawer (and it was covered in hair!!) which disgusted me and then there were holes in our bed sheets.. and the real icing on the cake was that someone came into our room, not once .. but TWICE when we were in the bath!!!! 

I spoke to the front desk downstairs who assured me they would investigate and let me know what had happened, later that day I received a call from the duty manager who explained that the porter had come into our room by mistake and he should have gone into the room next door as he was bringing up luggage for some guests. In return for the inconvience he offered us a free soft drink at the bar which I found insulting! 

I complained to the sanderson after my departure and they have since offered me another nights stay, which is the least they could do.. let's just hope my next stay is better than the first!",1,2009,03,01
132,"Great service, rooms a little tired","Yep it's achingly hip and the staff are what you'd expect from a top notch hotel - friendly and well-informed.  What lets it down is the standard of the rooms - the bed linen and towels felt like they'd been washed to a sandpaper consistency, and no amount of silky white curtains can disguise the fact that it's clearly a converted office block.  This hotel needs a revamp to really justify the prices they charge.  There are better options in this price bracket elsewhere.",3,2009,03,01
132,bragging rights ahoy,"Stayed at a suite here. Very modern, lots of glass and minimalist lines used. Floor to ceiling windows, welcome bouquets and evening munchies. Yada, yada.

When we were coming in late one evening, there were tons of hoochies at the front door, trying to get into the hotel bar. The doorman sees us and immediately parts the crowd. Sweet!

Yes, I supposed it's all for the bragging rights. I've certainly stayed at much better hotels, but this is just for the London experience of it all.",4,2009,01,23
132,style over substance,"Voted the hippest hotel in the UK in 2008, I was quietly excited about the visit and gently disappointed with the experience. The hotel is nothing to look at from the outside, but has great interior design, and a buzzing atmosphere. The rooms were very different from the normal corporate hotel, but comfortable, well thought-out and with some nice touches. The bars, restaurant and lounge area were all great fun to sit, watch and be seen in. What a shame therefore for it all to be let down by the shallow, dis-interested and borderline incompetent staff. From the over-aggressive security staff at the entrance, to the vain and vacuous reception staff, who were more interested in how trendy they looked rather than providing a 5 star service, they were awful. The only diamonds amongst the rubbish were the Purple Bar staff, who were discrete and professional at all times.",4,2009,01,17
132,Loved the Sanderson,"Chic hotel right in the heart of Soho.  Very modern and trendy, and the staff was pleasant and helpful.  I had a standard double room which was spacious and tastefully decorated.  Loved the super comfy bed and sleek bathroom (especially the Korres toiletries).  Room service was tasty though slightly pricey.  There are two cool bars on the main floor; I especially liked the funky Purple Bar with its endless list of yummy martinis.  Location cannot be beat...  I much prefer the Sanderson to its sister hotel, St. Martin's Lane; happier with my room and definitely the service at the Sanderson.

My only complaint is the paper-thin walls.  I could hear nearly everything going on in the room next to me at all times...",5,2009,01,04
132,Satisfaction Guaranteed,"Very centrally location, great service, good interior and food.",4,2008,11,12
132,great spot and location,i stayed in the sanderson hotel in november and it lived up toits expectations. we were looking forward to a few days break in london and wanted a hotel that was central and that lived up to its expectations. the sanderson did exactly this. oxford circus tube is only 5mins walk away and leicester square is a 5-10 min walk so location couldnt be better. rooms are well finished and funky with a cool and calm design. staff were very friendly and helpful and were available anytime they were needed. beware the cost of room servise. £24 for 2cups of coffee and 2 scones. def recommend this hotel though and id stay here again for sure,5,2008,11,07
132,blast off to your room in this funky make over,"The Sanderson offers a very interesting makeover of a 1960's hotel, with elements of Hotel W and an attempt to be ultra cool.  The lobby is enormous and features the most out-there furniture which was a bit confronting for a business traveller, but wait! there is more.  Enter the lift and you are blasting off into space in your tin can with the milky way around you. Landing on your floor you are plunged in a cavernous darkness only illuminated by room numbers on the floor at the foot of your door. (I can only imagine stumbling around in the dark if pissed).  The rooms are quite large, white and lofty with wispy electric curtains separating the washroom from the bedroom.  All in all very spacious and light for London with large windows and did I mention natural light.  A great alternative if you can stomach the experience of getting to your room and want to be close to Oxford Street.",4,2008,10,09
132,Over priced and over rated,"I spent one night in this hotel on business recently. It is all very fine to look at and thinks highly of itself, as do most of the bar patrons, but it's really not worth the money.

Check in was fine, staff friendly.  The room is very minimalist.  While I admire minimalism to look at I prefer a some comfort in my hotel rooms.  The beds were fine, the covers too lightweight.  At the desk there is a reading lamp which is plugged into the only socket in the vicinity so to work on my computer which needed to be charged I had to plug out the lamp and work without adequate light.  In the bathroom there is a lot of glass which is again nice to look at but slightly disconcerting, I had to always double check my route out in case I was about to walk straight into another glass wall. The sink leaked onto the floor and the shower attachment on the bath did not work.

The food in the restaurant downstairs was excellent.  It is Asian in style and they suggest you order 2 to 3 plates per person - I suggest 2 at most as the portions are quite big.  I thought the food bill was actually very good value.

I cannot give an accurate review of breakfast as it took so long to come that I gulped half of it down before rushing off.  There was a very nice buffet of cereal and fruit and the cooked breakfast had to be ordered.  When placing my order I explained I needed to leave in 20 minutes to get to the airport and asked would my order be ready before that, I was told it would.  Over 20 minutes later, and having had to ask for it again, it arrived.

I wouldn't return.  There was nothing awful about it but The Soho Hotel down the road which is a similar price offers much better value.",3,2008,09,16
132,Loved the Sanderson,"Just got back from a wonderful stay at the Sanderson. What an amazing hotel - The rooms with all the white fluffy curtains, and the hotel staff helpful & polite. The spa was wonderful and relaxing. The atmosphere was attractive and the staff attentive. I would definitely recommend it",5,2008,09,12
132,Sexy and Chic,"Fab hotel, beautifully designed and furnished.  Our room was exquisite, modern with great attention to detail full of great products.  Two bars, one for public access and one just for guests serving great cocktails.  Fashionable London crowd and used by lots of agencies for shoots and putting up models etc.  Full of beautiful people.

Staff very attentive.

Location very central for restaurants and shops etc in the West End just off Oxford Street.

Looking forward to going back!",5,2008,09,07
132,The perfect chill out...,"We booked the hotel through the website and had problems with our booking. They were very good, Ama in particular as absolutely brilliant. She made every effort to accomodate us and went above and beyond the call of duty!

We looked on the website and saw some of the special offers - well worth doing! We found a 'Suka Package' which gives you the room and £100 credit for use in the Suka restaurant.

Upon arrival to the hotel, the room was ready 3 hours before we were scheduled to be in it! We arrived at 12pm and our room shouldnt have been ready until 3, but they gave us the key straight away so we made our way up. The lifts are awesome but you really need to experience these for yourselves so I wont ruin it for you - but they are out of this world!

Making our way down the corridor, they are fairly dimly lit but it gives a relaxing atmosphere. We stayed in room 122 which was apparently a Loft King. All we could say was 'wow'. From the super king size sleigh bed in the middle of the room to the bathroom separated by flowing white and pink curtains. The facilities themselves appear very nice, the bath for example is big enough even for me (6'5'', stocky chap!), but the shower connector in the bath fell off and the main shower looked like it may fly off at you whilst you are in it! However, these are only very small issues and dont let this distract you from the hotel. You really do feel a world away. The rooms are very, very relaxing indeed. The bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever stayed in, with pillows you can just sink into and a quilt to match. The blinds also block out all light, we woke up at 8:30am and you would have thought it was 2am it was so dark! The room was immaculately clean, but be careful when in the bathroom as some of the toiletries are there for your use but you may be charged A LOT of money. A sponge, for example, was £14 and a plain white t-shirt was £25.

The staff are very attentive, however, there was some confusion caused with the type of package we booked and we felt we had to explain ourselves to every person. Instead of having dinner at Suka, we used the £100 credit for a couple of cocktails and also for breakfast the following day. If the cocktails are a 'must try' then breakfast is even higher on the list. I had a full english which was amazing. It doesnt look like a huge breakfast but it is certainly filling. My fiance had eggs benedict which she pretty much inhaled within seconds! It really was fantastic. If dinner is as good as breakfast then you wont be disapointed.

We also had drinks in The Purple Bar - definitely try the 'Divine Chocolate' cocktails. AMAZING. Very romantic, intimate space which is great for relaxing in after a night out.

Overall, we had a very relaxing couple of days and if we could live there we would! It is in a fantastic location for shopping (literally 30 seconds off Oxford Street) and is within 5 minutes walk of 3 good tube stations. The staff are friendly, attentive and make you feel extremely welcome and we are already thinking about our next visit.",4,2008,08,25
132,Fantastic funky hotel!,"Came to stay at this hotel for the weekend with my husband, my sister and my parents, to have a good time in London.
When we walked through the entrance, there is an instant wow factor! Everything is so trendy and funky!
Although we were early, we were immediatley allocated our rooms and our luggage was bought up to us by a Porter.
The rooms were fabulous - everything was so minimalistic and modern! The bed was in the middle of the room and had pillows at either end so you could sleep either end! The sheer curtains separate the room from the bathroom and create a sultry look. For more privacy, you just hit the elctric button on the wall and an extra pale pink curtain appears which is not so see through!
I thought the photos on this website made the rooms look small so was a bit worried. But was suprised to see thatthey are actually bigger than what they look like in the photos.
Before going out ot dinner in the evening, we went for a dirnk in the famous long bar in the hotel. Very glam, busy and lots of people! Had an extensive coctail list which we got stuck into! But of course very pricey!
When returning back from dinner, around 12:30am, we were going to go for a night cap at the Long bar but could not believe how busy it was! Y ou could not ever get to the bar! Eveyone was drubk happy, chatty, music, etc. So we decided to go to the bar right by the reception, much smaller, quieter and romantic. So we all sat down and ended up sitting there for a few hours getting quite drunk! The staff were very attentive and the drinks kept coming! But be wary of the price. There were fiuve of us sitting there for around two hours and the bar bill came to £270, although there were a few cocktails included in this.

The beds are soooooo comfortable! And the best things about the rooms for me were the blinds. They completely shut out all light! I can never lay in, the light always wakes me up! But when I woke in the morning, in pitch black and glanced at the clock, I could not believe it was 10am! I want these blinds!

The hotel staff were great. There was an incident when I thought I had left one of my shopping bags in the lift. I called down and spoke to the reception and there was a security man knocking on my door in less than a minute! Turned out that I was just being stupid and had not left the back in the lift at all!

Overall, had a fantastic time.Is completely different from any other hotel that I have stayed in. I Dont think this would suit an older coouple looking for a romantic break though, as it is so trendy and modern. My parents really enjoyed it, tehy are in their early 5o's but very modenr. But they said if they were going away on their own, they would have chosen a different hotel.

Would be a great hotel for a romantic weekend for a young couple or even for a girly weekend.",5,2008,07,23
132,Cool but at a Price by The Peke,"The Boyfriend and I had two nights at the Sanderson as part of our holiday this year. We like to 'do' London from time to time. I had stayed at the Sanderson before, but as a prize through my company, so it was interesting to assess it when I was actually paying for it.

Be aware that you will only get a discount on your parking if they park your car for you. We wernt informed of this so they relented and gave us reduced parking (still £85 for 2 days!). Not even sure if that was the discounted rate. Ho Hum.

The lobby is impressive, modern and cool. I was put in the bauble thing hanging from the ceiling and left spinning around much to The Boyfriends amusement! Was fun sitting on a pair of lips waiting for a taxi. The staff were welcoming, helpful and personable, even when part of my luggage was a Tescos carrier bag (dont ask - we all need emergency chocolate!). 

The rooms are clean, modern and I happen to like the floaty curtain thingy ying yang effect. Pressing the buttons kept The Boyfriend amused for a while (he's a boy and a lovely man what more can I say!?). However, not much privacy when you are in the loo unless you turn the TV up!! THE BED IS THE BEST and I didnt want to get out of it - huge, comfortable with lovely pillows and linen.

The concierge was helpful, managed to get us a table at the Gaucho Grill at the time we wanted in preference to our own attempts to book in (odd as they were half empty anyway but thats another story!). If you want theatre tickets, make the effort to walk to the theatre yourself - you will save £30 per ticket (in other words £60 for us for the sake of a ten minute walk) rather than pay the agents pemium.

The down side is the price. Is it worth the £300 + per night standard rate? Even at £266 per night that we paid via lastminute.com it seemed steep for room only (went to Harvey Nicks instead for brekkie!). The crowning moment was the price for one champagne cocktail and vodka and orange at the bar - £23 AND they charged us over 2 quid for the privlige of serving it to us!! The Boyfriend is still in therapy!

Also, I was shouted at by a barman for standing the wrong side of the rope thingy. Not very respectful way to treat a paying guest methinks. As for the people in the bar - well it was more middle aged businessmen looking for a bit of young totty to throw wads of cash at - but each to their own.

The room we had overlooked the central bar/restaurant area and was noisy up until closing time but thereafter was fine. 

I admit I do like the Sanderson - it feels cool and I like the quirky way it is done. However, worth the inflated costs? Only you can decide?!",4,2008,07,15
132,give this one a pass,It is all lipstick and rouge.....not really worth a 5 star rating.  The finishings look amazing on the website but up close are not well done....hence all the subdued lighting in the halls and elevators.    Rooms are very small for and the quality is not there for the price.    There are far better hotels in london.  would never stay there again.,2,2008,05,30
132,"I liked it, not a lot but I did like it","Much hype about the Sanderson, a 50's building transformed by Philippe Starck.  It definitely a cool hotel. As always in London it's hideously expensive - wether it's value for money is gonna depend on you.   We had a deluxe King Room. Large bed but very hard and very uncomfortable. Great Linen as you would expect. Pretty rubbish tv channels but who is there to watch the telly anyhow.  Oh yes, and lovely huge bath tub.  

Cool bars, extremely yummy breakfast in bed, fantastic mojitos, but at that price it's no more than you would expect.   My one disappointment, not being able to get a cup of tea and a slice of chocolate cake in my room at 2am. It's what I needed after a night out but apparently there was no cake in the kitchen! Big let down.

I liked it, not sure I'd go again though. There's nicer places in London for this price.",4,2008,04,29
132,Best for fun,"The Sanderson is the best for a night time with a girlfriend or romantic weekend with boyfriend. But in general the best things about the sanderson you can experience even if you do not stay there...the bar, the terrace, the food (not amazing but interesting) and the spa. It is definitely worth using but not sleeping in it!!",4,2008,04,17
132,A wonderful stay,"Have just got back from a brief and wonderful stay.  This is such a fantastic hotel - it looks amazing, particularly the rooms with all the white floaty curtains, and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Also had some spa treatments - and again a wonderful relaxing atmosphere and very attentive and capable staff.  I would definitely recommend it - can't wait to go back.",5,2008,04,03
132,Not Impressed,"My husband and I stayed at the Sanderson Hotel in October of 2007.  We were interested in staying at the hotel due to the design aspects as shown on the internet.  The staff at the hotel were very unprofessional which was pretty sad, since the hotel itself was not that great.  I will say that the location was good for us and China Town is a not too far away.  Also, we were in walking distance of several theaters and restaurants.  

The food at the Sanderson's restaurant was not good, especially for the price!  There are several good moderately priced Indian restaurants and pubs which would make a much better choice if you don't want to be disapointed.

The hallways are extremely dark and are very lightly lit.  The room itself was not bad, however the furniture inside was made very cheaply and it showed.  You could also hear the people in the room above us.  The hotel lobby music was extremely loud, if turned down a notch it would have been fine.

The wireless internet service was out and I was charged for it anyway!  I had to have them remove this from the bill, even though it was a known fact that it was down!  And there was no other way of getting internet access to your room!

The concierge at the hotel was more interested in talking with other staff and gossiping instead of helping paying hotel guests, and acted like it was a  huge burden to ask  him for information as to where a good Indian restaurant was.

The Sanderson would be a great hotel if the service and food were better.  It also seems to be one of the places to ""Be Seen"" and if I were younger and in my twenties I probably would have enjoyed the ""Vibe"" more.",2,2008,03,06
132,A Spaceship,"Stayed at the Sanderson in September '05 for the weekend before attending business meetings in Paris. My company at the time had a preferred rate at the Sanderson. 
Hotel: Very trendy lobby, the ultra chic staff is very nice and quickly checked us in and delivered our bags.
Room: the layout is a bit odd, clear glass and sheer curtains,  luckily I had my own room because there is no privacy.
Bathroom: When I entered the room I asked my chic bellman ""Where is the bathroom?"" and he answered: ""You are standing in it.""  hmmm OK
Shower: I nearly flooded the ""bathroom"" after taking a quick shower - see photos of the shower set up.
Food: breakfast is insanely expensive, did not even bother.
Beds: Very comfortable but not ""cozy"". 
Elevators/Hallways: very very dark with music constantly pumping at all hours.",3,2008,03,05
132,Sisters Fav Hotel!,"I booked this Hotel as a surprise Christmas present for my sister (we also went to see Cirque Du Solieil at the RAH).  If you like contemporary and to be in with the ""it"" crowd then this is for you. I thought we were checking into an office block when we first arrived as the outside is nothing special although the doormen are very handsome! Check in was amazingly quick and straightforward. The lobby is quite strange - not quite sure what the theme is and whether sitting on a seat resembling a large pair of lips is comfortable - but!. As everyone says the lifts are amazing. Take the steps at the first floor to see the amazing stained glass window as you drift down to reception. Although it was February we took a look at the outside space which I can imagine is lovely in the summer. The 'long bar' is just that and at night was filled  to capacity with ""beautiful"" people who I think come to be seen. We went in to the Purple Bar which is for residents only. It is quite tiny considering how many rooms there are in the hotel. You can only get in here if you show your hotel card which is taken off you!! - and for some reason there are tiny chairs in here only 1 foot off the ground!!!. Masses of Vodka cocktails ranging from about £12 and the ""baristas"" were making loads of complicated cocktails!!
The room - fantastically huge as I had booked a twin room, the beds were almost double and extremely comfortable. The air conditioning did keep us awake so we turned it off. Bathroom is OK and the ""pink"" curtain you can draw electronically gives enough privacy. Toilet is separated by glass (frosted) and the shower once I had turned it on and drowned myself was lovely. Be wary of the expensive goods in the bathroom - easily recogonised as to 'pay for' as they are all wrapped up. Used the hairdrier which was fab- not one of these tiny things you get in most hotel rooms but a proper drier. The inclusion of bathrobes and umbrellas (in case it rains outside!!) a nice touch. I agree with the comments of one of the other writers in that the TV/'expensive' mini bar housed in what resembled a formica cabinet from B & Q was ugly and outdated - not atall in keeping with the lushness of the rest of the surroundings - not quite sure I get the non-entity picture on the ceiling either!!!
I would say that the Hotel is ideally situated if you want to shop - we walked to Oxford Cicus without any problem. Taxis to Harrods (packed on a Sunday!!) from the hotel cost about £13 and to RAH another £13.
Breakfast is lovely - loads of choice although I consider it expensive if not booked as part of your package.
My sister loves this Hotel (and its sister St Martins Lane near to Covent Garden) - me, not quite sure if I would stay again, £358 for one night is as others say rather overpriced!",3,2008,02,09
132,Awesome!,"Great Hotel in a fantastic location!!
Staff were very friendly from reception to bar staff.
Walked to all bars & shops in soho.",4,2008,01,23
132,Worst two night's sleep of our lives,"We have just returned from a two night stay at Sanderson and are very sleepy.  The air conditioning system in our Deluxe King room was fairly noisy but it was severe dehydration that woke us every half-hour, and the £8 per bottle mineral water from the mini-bar didn't do much to quench our thirsts.

Sleep-deprived on night two, we thought we were probably just unlucky when our neighbouring guests decided to hold a ""party"" well into the early hours of Sunday morning.  That said, it could be that they had no choice but to make their own entertainment... the DVDs are (in our opinion, a vulgar attempt to squeeze more money out of their guests) £11 per night.

Though the Sanderson interior is very pretty to look at (and the lifts are wonderful!), it is incredibly over-priced for what is quite simply a big West-End tourist-hotel.  Both you, and your wallet, would be better off opting for one of the many smaller boutique hotels in the City...",2,2007,12,31
132,Out Of This World!!!,"The hotel is definaltly a place everyone has to stay at , at least once.. its one of those hotels you either love or hate!! i personally loved it , it was very modern and funky. everything looked brand new, fresh and as if it had never been touched!

The lobby was large and had unsual furniture, the staff were all very friendly and down to earth , not even stuck up as you would expect from some 5star hotels. 

Our room was on the 2nd floor , we could hear the noise frm the long bar frm our room but onli very slightly .. it didnt ruin our stay at all. 

The rooms are modern, simple, plain but also very unusal. We had a superior room im not sure how much different the standard is to the superior. Everything in the room looked brand new , all except the TV which i think you should be upgraded to a flat screen as you would expect it too seeing as its a 5star hotel thats whole focus is space saving and making a airey , relaxing environment, so the chunky TV spoils this slightly. 

The lift isss AMAZINGG!! i will say no more - you will have to see for urself as i do not wnt to spoil it for u! 

We had breakfast included with the room - the price of the contintental + english breakfast was £22.50pp - A lot of money!! but if its your stay at the hotel is a one off and a treat then you may aswelll treat urself to the breakfast. It was very nicee and everything you would expect, the resturant itself was very attractive and had a nice view of the garden.

Overall A great hotel!! Only Cons was the extra costs they charge you that are very expensive!! i worried at everything i picked up and used in the bedroom as i didnt know what was complimentary and what we had to pay extra for. The Wireless internet is at an extra cost of £15 a day. Their are large bottles of shampoo etc. in a box in the bathroom that you can also purchase along with the very tempingg over=priced food and drink in the minibar. Their is a Sainsburys not far from the hotel so just stock up on ur food and drink their if need be as it is a lot cheaper!!

Also... the mercedes taxis tht are outside the hotel are extremely overpriced also.. they wanted £15 for a 5min trip. we got a black cab instead and it costed £5.  So be careful!!! They will charge you anything because they think that you will pay it as you are staying at a upmarket hotel!! 

Hope this has been some help to you. Have a nice stay at the hotel if you do go.",5,2007,12,29
132,A great place to party but not necessarily for business,"$700 a night doesn't buy much these days in London, especially at this hotel.  Pack accordingly and prepare yourself to do battle with the oh so stylish but impracticalities at this place such as 1) a flashlight so you can see in the dimly lit hallways that were cool in the 90s but we're over it now; 2) a book reading light, otherwise you have to haul yourself out of bed to turn off the light when reading in bed; 3) an electric kettle - inconceivalble that a place that charges this much doesn't offer them.  It cost me $43 to have one delivered to the room and came with one tea cup, 4 tea bags and a sugar bowl - not even a cookie.  Fortnum & Mason here I come!;  4) an extension cord so you can plug your gear into sockets located at floor level and not have to use your computer while sitting on the floor, nor dry your hair in the same position; 5) a small hammer so you can fully depress the button to flush the toilet, and a nail repair kit so you can fix the nails you broke trying to depress the oh so stylish button without the hammer; 6) determination to get past the doormen at night who ask for your name on a list to go into the lobby - or just grease them with a 20 pound note - this is what those who weren't on the list appeared to be doing during my visit; 7) slippers as those marble floors in the bathroom are very cold in winter; 8) willingness to be an exhibitionist while you are in the room as the glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom give you a great view of the neighbors both day and night, and vice versa, as well as a traveling companion (let's hope you are very, very close) while you use the shower and the loo in full view ; 9) a luggage rack, or just don't bring much with you as the suitcase will end up on the floor taking up the path that goes around the free-floating bed in the middle of the room; 10) a rubber door stopper to keep the maids from barging in - those Do Not Disturb signs don't show up well in the very dark hallways.  

Thankfully the hotel provides ok toiletries and lots of plush towels to mop up the water that oozes out onto the oh so stylish flush-with-the-floor glass-walled shower.  Call ahead for a showercap to be placed in the many shower-only rooms - who would think that someone might need one and they could be placed in the rooms automatically.

Restaurant service is brusque with the black-clad waitresses constantly interrupting and one told us to cash out in the midst of a meal as she was leaving her shift and needed to get paid!  

On the positive side, the hotel is very well located on a fairly quiet street, the concierges were very helpful regarding restaurant suggestions and the day shift door men adept at giving directions and finding taxis.

Great place for a wild weekend with a hot date, but not very practical for business travelers or those who expect the basics to be covered.   If you go to mingle with the trendy crowd, Increase the odds that you and your paramour will get into the bar at night - check in on a weekday!",2,2007,12,20
132,Nice Hotel,"I have stayed here once before for business.  Last time I found it a little too funky, appropriate for people younger than me.  But my usual hotels in London were booked up, so ended up staying here again. This time, I was more comfortable.  The glass wall around the bathrom did not bother me. Actually, I liked the firmness of the bed.  The services such as the laundry valet, front desk, etc was good.  The concierge, however, seemed a little less knowledgeable than usual for this class hotel.  There is a popular bar in the lobby and the restaurant is extremely expensive.  But I liked the hotel. Decent value for money.",4,2007,12,02
132,Great place to take a girl,"This was one of the best places that I have ever taken a girl - it was awesome - they have white draped curtains and a bed that is huge! And - it is right in the middle of London, with great access to Oxford Street and the Theatre DIstrict. I stringly recommend this place.",5,2007,11,06
132,"Awesome Hotel, cant wait to go back!!","This hotel is awesome, please please stay if you get the chance, you wont be dissapointed!!!",5,2007,10,26

I have stayed there on a number of occasions and enjoyed it.

132,Great Lifts - Great Spa,"Had a great stay here . Full of quirky furnishings .The outside space is lovely you don t feel like youre in the middle of london .Lovely cocktails not cheap though.The spa experience was fab I felt like I was in heaven ,vast expances of white voile .I was shown to a beautiful lounger complete with personal telly.Being in the lifts was like being in space surrounded by the galaxy.Service great only downside room was not overly large but glass walls between the bedroom and the bathroom was slick.Would go back again ,Get yourself a deal by searching the internet. im",4,2007,10,18
132,Too cool for school!!!!,"No two ways about it, this is a seriously cool hotel. OK, so it's not exactly cheap but if you are looking for something special this is it.

The entrance lobby is fantastic with loads of weird chairs and sofas to relax on. There are two bars leading off from the lobby. The first (The Purple Bar) opens in the evening only and is small and very intimate. They serve a huge range of martinis.

The second (The Long Bar) is open all day and worth checking out. Not cheap (2 cocktails cost me 30 pounds!).

The room was minimalist but beautifully presented. Only drawback was that here was no bath in the en suite.

Definately an experience worth repeating! Take my advice on this one and book yourself in.",5,2007,09,30
132,Good but not perfect!,"The Sanderson is a fun hotel which takes itself a little too seriously. Upon check in I was surprised to be asked if we needed help with our bags-not quite what I had expected, there was also a lack of doormen too! Some of the staff have a slightly arrogant attitude and can bit perhaps a little abrupt. The rooms are comfortable and modern but nothing luxurious or particularly unusual really. The mini bar is very expensive with a water costing £4 and a mars bar £3.50 but to be expected I would imagine. We drank in both bars-I can't fault the cocktail bar but felt the other bar was a tad pretentious and was very under staffed. All in all we had a great time but I wouldn't rush back as overall I felt we have had better experiences in similar priced hotels.",2,2007,09,25
132,hype & trendy,"I have stayed at this hotel for more than ten days and here are my views:
the location is great, close to almost everywhere
the rooms are interesting and so sexy and are comfortable
housekeeping may be a problem. if you leave your telephone dischanger on the floor while leaving the room in  a rush, you will find it sitting on the floor when you are back in your room. and do not expect a wonderful housekeeping service. just average. for the money you are paying, you expect them to be more attantive and careful.
minibar is the most expensive one I have ever come across
the bar is very very hype and trendy
do not , but do not take the cars waiting in front of and recommended by the hotel cause they are cheating (the big luxury looking cars!). take a black cap or walk until oxford street and fınd a cap.
",4,2007,09,11
132,Modern Chic and Sexy,"Stayed at the Sanderson for two nights for a romantic weekend in London.  Greeted very warmly at the front desk and given key to our loft suite room 608.  

The rooms are very spacious and incredibly crisp with clean lines.  A massive sleigh bed sits in the centre of the room with only a glass partition separating you from the basin shower and free standing bath - very sexy. Everything you would need from a top notch hotel room from double bath to umbrellas and a massive balcony to enjoy a drink on.

We ate in the room on our first night and the food was excellent as it came from their Asian style cooking restaurant.

The only negative was we ordered a chauffeur from the concierge to take us to a concert but he did not turn up.  The hotel then very quickly arranged another car to take us and bring us back.

The Sanderson is the best hotel I have stayed in for some time and the staff and amenities are first class.  It is very expensive but well worth it for that special weekend.
",5,2007,09,10
132,Is Sanderson too cool by far? Surely not!,"Stayed at Sanderson for a weekend to celebrate my 7th wedding anniversary. 

First impressions are deceiving as from the outside it looks like a dodgy 80s office block but the lobby is filled with interesting furniture and this prepares you for the extravagance of Sandersons interior.

We arrived at 15:30 but were told our room was not ready so were shown to the bar and given a complementary drink will we waited. The reception staff are very helpful and approachable.

We chose to sit outside at one of the few tables not already reserved. Annoyingly as soon as we sat down a waitress came round flinging reserved signs on all of the tables outside. So book a table outside when you book your room if you want a drink when you arrive or in the evening. Our room was ready when we finished our drinks.

The room was spectacular. We stayed in a loft king, 110 I think. Oh and the lift is very nice. Pitch black with a holographic start field on the walls! Bed was great, bathroom great but another hotel whose cool shower leaks all over the floor! The best bit was the roof terrace where we could sit out in the morning having a lazy breakfast, extended in this case given the very generous check out time of 12:00.

We didn't use the hotel restaurant but the bar gets VERY busy.  The billiard bar is very nice indeed.

All in all a great hotel. Would I stay again....of course!
",4,2007,08,30
132,Very Different,"Hotel was very modern and ran into a couple of celebs here. room was small but nice, only thing was found it difficult to get the air conditioning to blow cool air, because of this room was quite stuffy! very expensive to drink here, and residence bar closes early so beware!! no tea making facilities in the room but overall the location was nice, staff were very friendly and did enjoy!
",3,2007,08,07
132,Cocktails to die for!,"My husband and I stayed at the Sanderson for a two day break for his Birthday.

We enjoyed an excellent experience from the moment we walked in, to the moment we left.

I was a bit worried that the staff would be a bit too ""beautiful"" to help - but I could not have been more wrong. They could not have done enough to make sure our stay was as pleasurable as possible.

If you have the budget then I would definitely recommend one of the Forest Suites with a balcony. We booked Suite 606 and it was amazing and very well appointed. The air-con was especially welcome during the muggy evenings.

The room service was prompt and of an excellent standard. The breakfasts were great and the cocktails in the Purple Bar were to die for! 

I would definitely recommend a stay at the Sanderson. It's not a family hotel - but great for romantic breaks in the old smoke.
",5,2007,08,07
132,Best Hotel I have ever stayed in!!!,"Do not believe the bad reviews this is the best hotel in London, All the staff are friendly and will do anyting to help you. This was a birthday suprise for me and I was so impressed, Stayed in the loft room 130 and had a gorgeous massive bed and bathroom with bath and shower! view of the restaurant below. hotel is within walking distance of China town and central soho so good for drinking. Purple bar is gorgeous and the chairs are of normal size (I noticed a below comment about the seats being small!!) Staff always greet you with a smile and room service is very quick had breakfast delivered to the room which was perfect. The hotel is trendy comfortable and good fun not your boring traditional hotel. I would recomend it to anyone! If I could move in I would Love it!!!! :-)
",5,2007,08,07
132,obsessed!!!!!,"My bf and i stayed here ( i convinced his sweet little self) and it was really fun. Would not bring a family here, but for what we wanted it was awesome! The bar at night was packed and lots of fun (fri night),
expensive drinks, trendy rooms. But walking distance to shopping
great concierge and fun at night. Would def. stay here again. The rooms are funky and stylish, same with the hotel. Its a young hip crowd and you dont have to leave to hotel to have a great fri evening.
But, although the concierge was friendly the italian restaurant accross the street they 'got us in at last minute' was only- ok...try and find somewhere else. Also- dont go to Nobu- very $$, crappy tiny rolls and obnoxious waiters that dont even let you finish your food with out taking your plate. Ok, im getting sidetracked. We left the sanderson early sat morning but got a full english breakfast. Although im a brit this was SERIOUSLY good and worth every bite! Also the guys at the front door already knew the heathrow express was delayed and totally saved us from missing our flight. Its hot!
",4,2007,06,20
132,Guaranteed fun if you are alone or meeting one of your Londoner pals,"Ask for Ian or Jasper.  Fun lobby.  Bartenders are flirtatious.  Food is good.  You can get into the latest clubs if you stay here.
",5,2007,06,03
132,Over rated,"This hotel is supposed to be the ultimate in luxury, despite all the rave reviews I feel otherwise.  Yes the decor is very trendy and different, but I actually felt like I was in Ikea.  The toilets were clean and the soap could have been from Tesco, locks didn’t work and the sanitary bins were broken. The corridors looked like they had just had emulsion of a trendy colour slapped and that was it!  Our room was a basic room, but I have stayed in rooms with better facilities in a travel inn!  The toiletries were non-existent, no cotton wool, or tissues, there was no kettle or tea making facilities, I rang reception for a kettle but it never arrived.  The room was pokey and small, the only plus point was the hair dryer which was better then your average hotel dryer.  

The spa is well over rated, you sit in a big room with drapes and that is it, I am sorry but for the price I expect a little more then a chair a couple of apples and lots of white curtain.  I did have a treatment, again you were surrounded by white curtain, this gave one the feeling of being in hospital rather then a luxury spa, also you could here the groups of girls talking in the chill out room, hardly what I would call relaxing.  We ordered lunch which took over 30 mins to arrive, I had a chicken club sandwich, which cost £23, but was on cheap white bread, the salad was very poor as well and the dressing tasted like it had been made out of vegetable oil! 

As for the price of drinks, I was appalled, maybe I am a little out of touch, but £15 for a cocktail that took ages to arrive, is not my idea of a bargain.

The long bar, yes is very cool, but also very presumptuous, the staff were very slow to serve and once again it cost a fortune, at around 12.00 I was told in a rather abrupt was to remove myself from the outside terrace area by a member of staff as they were closing it.  There are ways of asking people in a polite way to leave the area.

In short this hotel is trying to be trendy and chick, however the decor in trendy and cheap, and the drinks and drinking areas trendy, expensive and presumptuous!  Sorry but take me to the Dorchester or Claridges next time!
",3,2007,05,14
132,Great Bed!,"Loved this hotel.  The room was unique but very comfortable.  I loved the bed.  I liked the curtain as a bathroom wall.  The shower was full and forceful.  Blackout shades.   Fun, lively scene at hotel bar.  Restaurant pretty outdoorsy setting.  Very short stroll to Oxford Street and Tube station.  My only complaint - I could not find an electric outlet in the bathroom!
",5,2007,05,12
132,Sanderson is Fabulous,"The Sanderson is an ultra modern hotel near Oxford Circus Tube.  It's similar to the St. Martin's Lane but much nicer, friendlier and the rooms are bigger.  This is not a place where you can have privacy -- so it should be a close couple that books this room.  It is very clean, beautifuly maintained.  The lobby is  total scene but there is quite bar just for patrons of the hotel.  The service was excellent.  We loved Ian the concierge who took great care of us -- got us into all the great restaurants.   The location is good (near SoHo, West End, Covent Garden) to everything but Oxford is a very busy street.
",5,2007,04,30
132,Best Breakfast!,"My boyfriend booked us in here for my birthday as a surprise. Although some of the room decor seemed a little tired I loved the well sized room and beautiful big bed. The spa is a little overpriced and with next to no internal walls, I felt slightly nervous about being almost completely starkers! 

Purple bar was good although empty on the evening we visited. Cocktails very good but typically not that cheap. £9 for a 'classic' and £14 for a more modern drink. Well worth a go but if you're on a budget, I'd stick with one or two.

I can't say enough about breakfast. It really was fantastic. Lots of choice and beautifully cooked. Fantastic fruit, croissants, pain au chocolat, yogurts and muffins were also available. The non-resident clientale seemed a little snobby though and I did get the impression that some people were there just to be seen. A little sad but don't let this put you off. Beautiful hotel and great service throughout our stay. Give it a go!

132,Still leading the pack,"I have stayed at The Sanderson several times with work over the years and whilst it is beginning to show it's age, it is still a great destination hotel. 

Obviously I would never be able to afford its published rates but each visit has been booked through websites and it works out as not much more than one of the better chains like Raddisson Edwardian. 

The staff have always been very charming, the room whilst no longer so fabulously trendy is still great fun and the cocktails in the Long Bar are wonderful. We were there mid-week and there were loads of people being turned away from the bar.

Only downsides this stay was a lack of bar-food and the silly prices for the minibar and things like coffee.

132,style wothout substance,"Very funky lobby with very pleasant staff. Purple bar had highly uncomfortable tiny seats , long bar very very crowded. ""Space ship"" lift could have been at home at Disney's, corridors had minimal lighting which I found a bit naff. If you like net curtains than this is the hotel to go for, they were used everywhere in the room as screen/dividers. No heated towel rail, mirror at ""funky"" angle in order to make it difficult to put on make up. A wardrobe (a rail hiding behind a net curtain) in the bathroom is NOT stylish, nor is the socket for the hairdryer near the floor in the bedroom. WOW-there was a picture on the ceiling above the bed!
I think they are just trying too hard to be different and for nearly £300 a night I expect style AND comfort. An experience, but not to be repearted.

132,"Sophisticated, chic and trendy","We stayed here for two nights end of Jan, '07, and we had a great time in what can only be described as a complete design experience. Having read other TA reviews, I was expecting pouting staff looking gorgeous but completely useless; I was pleasantly surprised to see that the staff were some of the most hospitable I have encountered in a large hotel. They were polite, informative and extremely friendly in a very sincere way - not what you usually get from this type of place!

The communal areas are fab., with  a great and vibrant bar wich serve lovely cocktails and wines. The long central bar feels a little bit posy, but I guess the whole place is. The private bar was quiet on both nights we were there - early in the week - but is fun and decadent. The martini collection is nothing if impressive.

Our room was a good size with  a big sleigh bed and a running machine! White floor to ceiling curtains seperate the bathroom which was sleek, clean and of course trendy. (Only shower, no bath). Plenty of nice toiletries. Spa was an experience - the hot stone body massage, whilst pricey, was brilliant. It's a must see area of the hotel so do have  go!

Overall highly recommended as a great treat - didn't get chance to try the restaurant but it looks similarly stylish. Will definitely stay again.

132,An expensive disappointment,"£280 a night for a small room with tiny shower and no bath.  Noisy fans outside room. Head of housekeeping possibly the rudest man I have ever come into contact with.  Price quoted was ex vat so nice surprise of £80 on my bill as I checked out.  If you value style over any kinf od substance or comfort this could be the place for you.  By the way - if you thought the rooms were expensive, don't even venture to the bar where if the surly barmen will condescend to serve you you'll be asked to extract a kidney as payment - oh yes and it's extra for crisps.  My 6am coffee was... £8.50 plus £3.50 for a biscuit.  That's right £12 for a capuccino and a biscuit.  Bargain

132,Unique!,"My new husband booked us 2 nights at this hotel as a surprise - and what an amazing stay!  I had been to the bar before so I knew the decor was not that of your average hotel, but as it inhabits an old office block I was slightly dubious about how nice the rooms could be - how wrong I was! We had a HUGE room with silver sleigh bed, and everything else except a silver chair and red rug was pure white, with layers of net drapes and beautiful lighting to create different moods. The bathroom and double ended bath were equally big, with great products and more sexy lighting. The whole hotel is ultra modern and minimalist with very individual touches but it can be slightly overwhelming and waiting in the lobby one evening I definitely felt a little out of place without any designer glad rags on! I agree with previous reviews that this is a place to see and be seen so if that's not your thing, then a night or two for the experience and top central location should be enough - it is very expensive mind!

132,Hip hotel - Stay a night for the novelty factor or if you wish to be 'seen',"Stayed here for a week in November.  It is a hip hotel popular with upcoming stars trying to get themselves seen and footballers. But I can't help but think it is all gets a little too much after a while.  This is where Madonna did her interview screened on Oprah after the adoption of David so it does pull the stars ... but unfortunately all the staff are also waiting to be 'discovered' and most of the time it is difficult to get served as they are more interested in posing and preening themselves- that is unless you tip big! Imogen from BB was a receptionist here ... need I say more????

Anyway - on to the review - 
The interior of the hotel is all sleek and white with a pitch black lift up to the room - unfortunately the standard rooms are absolutely tiny - even though they are very modern in terms of design and layout.  But they are absolutely spotless with a crisp white and silver image.  The first night there was an all night party in a nearby room (a famous guest apparently who they ended up asking to leave).  The party was never ending, even after many visits from security, however the next day I was upgraded to a huge suite with free standing bath, sleigh bed, and separate lounge area!  this room was enormous and very impressive. On checking out I was told that this room normally costs STG 750 per night - so aI was glad of the upgrade but I really don't think it would have been worth that sort of money. I also saw a delux room as I had a friend staying there ...and while slightly bigger, it would be considered a standard room in any other 5* hotel.

The Long bar and the Purple bar are both nice but very small and it is difficult to get a seat in the long bar there when they are busy. The price of both the drinks and the finger food in the bars is quite pricy - more overpriced than most 5*'s in London - even the Ritz! Towards the end of the week the long bar is buzzing from about 4pm in the evening with lots of local business people and the glamorous set! At one stage I counted 11 bar staff behind the small bar - but yet there was no one to serve a drink. I ordered the dessert tasting plate another day and it took 50 minutes before i got it! It seemed if youtip high you are assured personal service both from the bar staff and the door staff - but otherwise they can't be bothered! But be warned - the amount of times guy's tried to pick me up in the hotel was unbelievable.. .even in the corridors to the rooms I was propositioned.  It seems there are a lot of  call girls working in this hotel regularly (you can even find them wandering around floors knocking on rooms) - so for a single woman it is a bit of a nightmare to sit in the bar if you are alone and don't want that sort of attention. Men even waited for me outside the ladies asking if i was looking for a good time!

There was a fight in the Purple bar one night when a drunk group of 2 girls/2 guys were ordering cocktails and no-one was paying - the staff handled it well and called out one of the guys who was staying in the hotel to tell him he was being used by the two girls.  Thee appeared to be a lot of free loaders or hangers on hanging around the hotel most of the time - this was a complete turnoff as you felt everyone was insincere as a result!  The Billiards room also was closed off most of the time for private parties.  Another gripe about the purple bar is that the hostess was always asking if you were on the VIP list to gain entry there - and thjen when you went in it was always practically empty.

If you want to get away from it all then there is a very relaxing seating area near the treatment room - all in white - where there was absolutely no noise and it was a nice getaway from the fuss.  The gym is also impressive with lots of equipment and in the week I was there I never saw anyone else use it.

All in all I would recommend this hotel for a night out in London (Just don't book a standard room)- Fantastic location near SoHo and the West End for shows etc - but if you are a looking for 5* treatment, luxury plush surrounding and a relaxing environment - then stay elsewhere. 

Note - I've found that this hotel is often available as a 'top secret hotel' on Lastminute at a much reduced rate so worth taking a look there!

132,Funky & Modern Experience!!,"On arrival reception was full off eye catching bits, lips sofa, sliver thrown, long chaise longe, pictures of dogs heads, alien chair, the bar was busy and the music was pumping (2 in the afternoon) All staff were very helpful especially doormen and reception, check in was quick and friendly we were shown to our room via the stepping into a space themed lift and given quick but informative details about the hotel. 
Rooms are amazing all clean, modern, elegant sleigh beds, glass walls, flowing curtains, ceiling to floor mirrors, running machine and weights (not used haha) desk/dressing table. Bathrooms were fun nice products, lovely bath, fun free standing sink!! Long Bar equally as busy in the evening great cocktails, purple bar less busy and more intimate!! Breakfast was fab (£22.00) so try and get it included in the package delish pastries, fruit, cereals and juices followed by a posh fry up all served until 12 which is a bonus!! 
Overal Fun stay, funky, modern, lively not ideal for anyone over 40 unless young at heart!!
Minor thing the bar is loud and can be heard in rooms facing the centre court of the hotel for an early night or less noisy stay ask for a street facing room!!
",5,2007,01,09
132,Absolute top experience,"Hoteliers, send your managers and staff to Sanderson to learn how a hotel shall be operated and guests should be treated!

After staying the last four days at Sanderson, me and my wife  talks about the staff and the value of having the right people onboard at a hotel. 

-Sandersons has a staff that I wish all the people staying at hotels should have the opportunity to meet.

We have been staying at many upper class hotels over the years and I must say that Sanderson is the best one we have ever experienced as to the overall picture in which ,as you may have already understood, the staff plays a very very important role.

Go here if you are young at mind, experience how good things are at a hotel where the staff is proud to work and proud to give you all the service you would ever dream of, all on a personal basis.

132,unforgetable.,"I have been wanting to stay at the sanderson for a long time now since i am a big fan of cutting edge  design hotels –and of designer Philippe stark in particular.

I booked a deluxe room for new years eve weekend – 28/12/06-1/1/07 and was hoping for a very romantic and memorable stay in this very famous hotel on this very special time of the year.

i got everything  i wished for.

The design – well it is truly fabulous – different then any other hotel I  ever stayed at in the world: it is unexpected, beautiful, original, amazing and you cant get enough of it. It is like a perfect bizzar dream, if you know what i mean.

Front desk – the staff at the sanderson are young and friendly. They treated us with perfect manner. we arrived at the hotel at 9 am and immediately were given a room although check in time was 3 pm!
 
Concierge – was helpful and even got us a table at ""j-sheeky"" restaurant on a Saturday evening! (one of the hottest seafood spots in town with an impossible waiting list)

The deluxe room –not words nor pictures can truly describe how wonderful and pleasant  It really was. Sized about 42 sqm. The bed was very large, very very beautiful  and incredibly comfortable. The floor was wooden, the bath area was spacious and included a stand alone bath, a walk in shower, a toilette – all designed magnificently. In fact every item you find in the room is superb – from the toiletries to the towels – to the amazing sofa – to the picture on the ceiling.
Don’t be nervous about the ""see through bathroom"" – when you use the electrical curtains it becomes completely privet and the whole room get amazing colored lighting effect that makes it feel very heavenly and sensual. 

The aqua spa – is b-e-a-t-i-f-u-l. Book a massage and you will enter another dimension.

The purple bar – is for the use of hotel guests only. It is small, dark, extremely cool and relaxed. Amazingly designed.

The long bar – hip trendy and buzzing – not our cup of tea although very stylish indeed.

Courtyard – stunning. 

The gym – spacious with cutting edge equipment.  

The billiard room – again, so beautiful!

Location – prefect – 2 min from oxford and regent streets, 7 min from soho and fabulous covent garden.

Prices – when you come to London you should prepare  yourself for the fact that you are coming to one of the most expensive cities in the world. And the sanderson definitely lives to it's city's rep.  it is extremely expensive to stay at the sanderson. Everything costs… even cocktails start at 11 pounds and I don’t even want to start telling you about the prices of the spoon restaurant or the room service. It is EXPENSIVE!

Summery – if you got the cash – you really got to give the sanderson a try. It is not just a beautiful  hotel to sleep in - it is  an amazing experience that makes you feel very special and to me – worth the money.

* don’t book any room except the deluxe or one of the lofts.  We asked to see The smaller ""standard"" and  ""superior"" rooms to check out the décor  and they were small  enough to really piss you off!

132,Fun & Quirky!,"Hotel very minimalistic and modern, with some lovely features.  Staff very pleasant & helpful.

Only one gripe:-

Having my son & his girlfriend return to the Hotel with us to enjoy a night cap, the staff in the Purple Bar commenced covering the optics with clingfilm and even mopped the bar floor, whilst we sat with our guests.  Not what I had expected for such a hip Hotel!!
",5,2007,01,04
132,"Funky, Quirky and Surreal","Words cannot fully describe this hotel and photos would not do it justice. This hotel is amazing and really different from what else is on offer in London. As you walk up to the hotel, the outside of the building looks quite plain and standard, however as soon as you step into the lobby it is like Alice stepping through the looking glass into another dimension. 

The lobby has a pop art feel to it with a different types of furniture dotted around the place and there are unusual framed paintings of dogs looking straight at you. As you step into the lift, you are encased in an almost pitch black 3D outer space environment with funky music playing. There is a beautifully designed Billiard room near the lobby which also features several strange pieces of furniture such as chairs with mammoth horns coming out of it. The long bar is buzzing at night, and everyone looks young and trendy. 

My husband and I stayed in a Deluxe Room with a city view. The room does have a wow factor to it. The room is all white and silver and minimalist which makes the room look crisp and clean. The bed is placed diagonally across the room and there is a painting directly over it. There are so many cool features, from a giant egg sculpture next to the chair, silver dumbbells on the wall to little silver tea-light candles lit at turndown. The bathroom is separated by a clear glass wall and one sheer curtain and one thick curtain, there was a small sink and a free standing bathtub, next to this space is a walk-in shower and the toilet which are both separated by opaque glass, there are no internal walls. There is no wardrobe and the only place to hang clothes is on a clothes rack in the bathroom area. 

This hotel is lovely especially if you are looking for something modern and different. It is fun, funky, quirky, trendy and very surreal and I cannot wait to go back again.

132,The Nightclub Residential Experience,"There is so much to say about this hotel! Other reviews will mention the high prices, the long bar and the pictures above the bed so I won't go into detail on them. I shall instead write briefly about my overall impressions of the overall experience we had here.

I would say the whole place is like a trendy nightclub. The lifts are pitch black, with illuminated walls shining patterns of stars and planets, and loud funky music. The corridors leading to the rooms are also very dark. The music is a recurring motif of the hotel - at breakfast it was pretty loud too! In our room there was even a CD that you could buy of the hotel's 'soundtrack'.

Our deluxe room had lots of nice little details that we enjoyed, ranging from the Phillipe Starck dumbells on the wall to the lovely, weighty little alarm clocks and the stylish glass-walled shower room (You can do great 'Evil Genius' impressions in there thanks to the superb echo!). The transparent walls ensure that you and your significant other will never be out of each other's sight - so this is a place that couples may enjoy more than lone business travellers.

We found the service to be very friendly and efficient. All the staff were good-looking and trendy, and far from stuck-up as could have been the case.

The other residents seemed to be mid- to late thirties upwards, and looked well-off (well, you'd have to be wouldn't you?). Come nightfall, the bars are packed with attractive people in their late-20s upwards and you begin to really see the whole point of the hotel. The transition from bar to bedroom is seamless as an experience.

So in summary - yes the long bar is great, yes the purple bar is smoky, and yes the pool table always seems to be taken, but if you're young (or young at heart!), well-heeled and are after a residential nightclub experience, this is probably the place to get it.",4,2006,11,26
132,"Overrated, achingly hip however achingly uncomfortable","A five star hotel should be: comfortable, discreet, glamourous, clean with impeccable service

I absolutely despise this place or maybe I am a bit too old for it, late thirties. It feel like an expensive nightclub with bedrooms instead of a hotel. The constant music piping in the lifts, are intially ok, but following a few trips can be incredbily annoying. 

My room, merely a standard room was pretty awful considering how much I paid for it. The bathroom floor was stained, a permanent stain, I hasten to add. Toiletries minimal, however you could purchase a few more, 'purchase' being the operative word, the dressing gowns were washed out and scratchy. 

As for its hipness, well a boxy sony television is hardly cool these days!

Not to mention the purple bar which is really overpriced!

As for the doorman, well they tend to disappear on a regular basis!

The hotel saving grace is the long bar, which has an increbile vibe. 

The Sanderson no more, give me the Four Seasons, Dorchester or Claridges any day..................Canadian and British hotels!
",2,2006,11,25
132,One in a million,"From check in to check out I felt really special. The bellman treated me so kindly with all their assitance.I found the entrance to the hotel almost took my breath away. You just don't find many hotels in the world quite like the Sanderson. The little touches like the candle in the room and the amazing aqua spa. Which I would go everyday if I could. I was very surprised at some of the negative remarks made on this site about the Sanderson as could not find a floor with this hotel. You  feel like you are in another place when staying there. I will be back very soon.
",4,2006,09,29
132,not enough bang for your buck - for me anyhow,"myself and my husband stayed here while he was in London on business, the reviews of the hotel looked good and its in a great location.

From the outside, the hotel looks dreadful, inside, things get much better, the lobby is cool, but i'm not sure if it makes a cohesive whole....the receptionists are all good looking, dressed in black - quite trendy rather than chic.  The lifts are dark - think night sky, i found them too weird,,,,
Our room was a standard and like another reviewer, the tv was totally wrong in the room.  Also, there were stains on the walls, which are very obvious in an all white room - lastly, although our room was non-smoking, I definitely got the smell of smoke in the room - didn't ask to be moved however, as we were jsut too rushed for time.  

The picture did fall off the ceiling narrowly missing my husband - the hotel did  absolutely nothing by way of an apology,  which for me says it all....

We had planned to stay in the hotel for dinner, the outdoor terrace is lovely, however, after a mediocre lunch - club sambo for 17 quid, we decided not to bother and headed elsewhere.  We came back to the hotel for drinks and were very disappointed - we were not allowed to have a drink outside - it was a sunday and was about 11.30 and instead headed into the purple bar, which was full of smoke and very low seating.  The service was terrible

Overall, great location and very trendy, but they have some way to go to deliver the service their prices demand
",2,2006,09,12
132,pricey..but worth the experience,"We knew we were going to pay a lot to stay here, but I love splurging on cool hotels for the experience, and the Sanderson was pretty much worth it.  There were a few hiccups with our room rate (they had us down for a more expensive rate but I had the confirmation with our actual rate which they honored when I showed them the printout) and they also inadvertantly checked someone else into our room while we were out to lunch.  But their head concierge Ian was fabulous and upgraded us to a king suite with terrace which was unbelievable.  I found the staff very nice and helpful and although it was very expensive for drinks at the bar and any add ons...anyone who books this quality of hotel should anticipate such charges.  Definitely recommended if you are willing to splurge and looking for a unique experience.
",4,2006,08,08
132,Favorite hotel in the world,"Sanderson is definately my favorite hotel.  This was my second stay and it was even better.  The standard rooms are a little smaller than the superior but they are just as much fun.  Everything is very clean and modern.  I love the curtains and the glass between the bathroom and room.  All of the staff are friendly if you are staying at the hotel and it is easy to get something if you need it.  The Long Bar is always fun and makes some of the best drinks in London, as does the Purple Bar. The lobby is a scene and always fun to walk through.  The agua spa is amazing, really one of a kind, and has great massages.  The restaurant is nice in the summer because you can sit in the outside terrace which is beautiful.  The food is good but  for the money I'd recommend Asia de Cuba at the St Martins Lane.  The location is also perfect as it is right near Oxford Street and Soho, everything is walking distance, good for restaurants and nightlife.  It's very expensive but I'll come back whenever I have the chance.

",5,2006,07,23
132,"Cold room, cold staff, cold experience","I've stayed in some of the best hotels in London and abroad and this by far achieved the ugly title of worst yet. I took my partner here as we were attracted to the fashionable modern appearance and location in the centre of London. By all accounts the Hotel was trendy, seemed to be buzzing and the staff were attractive and dressed well. However they were also shockingly aloof and arrogant, quite patronising and clearly disinterested in anything other than how their hair looked or whether they could stiff you for a few extra quid! The room was quite dirty (a deluxe) and everything was at an added cost. Where did my £500 go? Although the minimalist appearance was quite kitch and unusual I really didn't think it warranted the premium I had to pay. I'd expect better service in a 2 star in Peckham. For example; they suggested we should get a cab to our chosen restaurant (a short walk away, say 15 mins) which we initially objected to, and then they persuaded us that 'it's ok we'll get one of our cars to take you' which seemed good of them, only to find it had a £10 premium on the fare, they gave us the impression it was free nevermind more than normal! I asked, and checked twice, for a bottle of champagne to be put in the room on arrival, there was none. We were told rooms weren't available until 3, and despite asking several times they really didn't have any flexibility in this at all, and became quite rude when I asked if I could ask them to make an exception. The bar staff were rubbish and seemed to want to wind us up. Altogether I had a good night as I was partying in London, but I would definitely not recommend you go unless you have serious cash to burn for very little reward. I got the impression they get very little repeat business and because of their location they didn't care! My experience would have been just as good in a two star, seriously.
",1,2006,07,13
132,The Staff made it an enjoyable (but pricey) stay,"From the minute we pulled up in the cab the staff at the sanderson made us feel important and special.  All details, even storing important camera equipment while the room was turned, was addressed professionally, with courtesy, and concern.  Gary escorted us to our room, i felt weird because i called it a ""freak show"".....it was small, no view, the windows didn't open, faced a fire escape, no bathtub, etc.  I'm not a big ""Boutique Hotel"" person, but the trendiness certainly made up for it in other places in the hotel.  It really is like being in a big art piece.  The long bar is clean, functional, and loaded with energy and good looking people. Cocktails were created with verve and panache, and were very tasty.  Questions were answered and care was given with every interaction with the staff.  Be prepared to spend!  Took three friends out in the courtyard restaurant, had a few drinks and appetizers, the lobster salad, and a seared tuna, bill was $450.  Room for two nights was $1000., but it did include continental breakfast, where i had very yummy oatmeal.  The neighborhood was alive and too full of people, reminicent of Times or Herald Squares in NYC.  Conversion rate is definitely not good right now.
",4,2006,07,13
132,Style over substance?,"I am a designer and I have, for some time, had an ambition to stay at this hotel. I was not disappointed, It does have a WOW factor and it is visually exciting.  All the public areas are beautifully designed and unlike many hotels you actually want to spend time there.  The bedrooms however are not quite as successful. We had a double room, probably the cheapest room rate and I cannot comment on more expensive rooms.  The room was quite small, all white with a double bed positioned in the centre of the space. The bathroom (with shower only) is a glass cubicle with curtains. The loo was 'bog standard' no evidence of Philippe Starck here! The shower did not work and flooded the floor. The shaver point was impossibly positioned in relation to the mirrors and the sink with no plug made washing contact lenses a chore. The heating system was irratic. So although it looked fantastic It was not a pleasure to use.  

This is an expensive hotel. A pot of tea after our night out cost £14.
Why do hotels charge such silly amounts for basics like tea and water? It irritates and makes you think the whole place is a rip off.  

A word about the staff: fantastic!  The Charm School has done a good job!
",4,2006,06,01
132,"OK, But Watch Out for the Purple Bar","Everything would have been rated as top notch were it not for a snotty hostess in the Purple Bar.  I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights and each night she asked me if I was a guest at the hotel, while she clearly did not ask others the same question.  Usually, I had to ask for the bill more than once, one night I actually stood up and waited for her to bring it.  I once was there with a business client and his jacket unknowingly fell to the floor.  Rather than picking it up, she just kicked it aside with her foot.  Totally unprofessional behavior for a hotel of such a high caliber (and price).
",3,2006,05,29
132,Super cool,"The Sanderson is my favorite of the Schrager hotels. The lobby is hip and bar are hip, as expected. The service is impeccable and the rooms are a slice of heaven. You are enveloped in a sea of white - curtains, bedding, floors, walls and feel like you're floating on a cloud. I loved escaping to my room after a hectic day of sightseeing. To top it off, the location is perfect for being on top of all the action. I can't wait to be back in London and stay here again!
",5,2006,05,18
132,We were not disappointed,"We loved the clean modern esthetics of the room.  Everything was bright white, from the walls, the furniture and the bedding, but done in a tasteful understated yet quirky way.  There was a glass wall with gauzy curtains that separated the main bedroom from the bathroom and the room itself was quite big (we were on the top floor, and this may have been one of the deluxe room).  I used the wonderful stand-alone bathtub several times during the trip and the bubble bath they provide is quite decadent.

The hotel is located in a convenient area, about three block from the nearest tube station (Goodge street).  The street is safe and quiet, though only about two blocks away from the shopping madness of Oxford Street.  The staff was quite friendly and helpful, and the hotel itself is hip and trendy with a very ""happening"" bar scene.  Definitely more designed for the younger crowd.

As several other reviewers mentioned, this is not a hotel for everyone.  If you have more traditional taste, and like rooms with antiques and chintz, Sandersons is not for you.
",5,2006,05,15
132,A hotel to remember...,"I took my partner to stay at the Sanderson Hotel as a surprise for his birthday, and we loved every minute of it. We stayed only one night and from the moment we arrived we appreciated the quirky and modern nature of the hotel. The front desk staff were incredibly friendly and really made us feel right at home, despite the fact we are probably not their usual clientele (we were dressed more trendy/student than designer/chic)! They informed us they were fully booked in their standard accommodation and we were upgraded several levels to a Deluxe King. 

The room was fantastic and in my opinion of a more than adequate size. The bed was immense and the best I have ever spelt in, with soft duvets and plenty of pillows. The decoration was intriguing and while modern, never felt sparse or uncomfortable. We especially enjoyed the picture on the ceiling! The pink and white curtains which surrounded the room provided a sensual atmosphere, and the fact they were electrically controlled also ensured they were practical as well as looking great. We loved this feature, as did we the lighting, which is versatile in creating different moods while keeping the room bright and airy. 

I will echo from the previous reviews that the bathroom does not have ""walls"" as such, but panes of glass which separate it from the room. The curtains can be pulled across to give you some privacy. The shower was large, strong, powerful and hot. Being a fan of Starcks' designs I loved the fixtures. We did not use the standalone bath but it was a nice feature to have. The towels were as large as bedsheets, and the bathrobes were an excellent touch.

Yes, the mini bar is expensive but nobody makes you use it. We did not sample room service nor have time to visit either the restaurant or the two bars, but they were both busy and full of life. The public areas of the hotel are all interesting and well presented, with the unique elevators taking the staring role!

This hotel is clearly not for everyone, but for us it was a fun and memorable night away in an ideal location. The room upgrade, the little candle lit in the room when we entered, the superb and friendly service at front desk all made it unique. It is expensive, and in all honesty perhaps a little overpriced, but if you're going to blow the budget you'd struggle to find a more fun place to do so than the Sanderson!
",5,2006,05,08
132,Sanderson great,"First the Sanderson is in a great location to visit London. Soho, Covent Garden, Shaftesbury Avenue, Oxford Street and Hyde Park are all close by. If you re prepared to walk for 30-45 mins Knightsbridge and the Museums are also within reach. Perfect, we were there for three nights and never used the tube. OK it looks quite expensive but not really in London terms. 
The staff are excellent concierge and booking in staff very friendly and efficient especially helpful in guiding you to restaurants etc even printed us a map to allow us to walk to a restaurant without a problem.
The rooms are quite small and extremely modern(think hospital room white) but everything works well i.e showers etc although our rooms TV was quite old not at all in keeping with the room.
The Purple Bar is great after a night out in town only small but very busy and friendly. Not sure about the long bar only stayed there very briefly too many people celeb spotting for me!     
Finally the breakfasts where extremely good and my girlfriend said I had to mention the lifts they are great playing the best tunes I heard in London that weekend.
I ll be back soon!

132,What an experience,"Sanderson is absolutely a must!! Rooms are not so big, but it is simply stilish..coming back in the afternoon I found candles light up..could you imagine a white room lighted by candles?

The SPA is just the entering room of Heaven!

Bars and cocktails are more that 5 stars rated!

Thanks Sanderson!

132,Fab - As usual!,"Sanderson is such a great hotel, the rooms are trendy and cool, very comfortable in every way. 

The bar attracts a nice group of people and it's very easy to chat to everyone.  

Give this place a try! Don't forget your Jimmy Choo's at home, you will need them!

132,Celeb spotting,"Decided to take a young lady friend to see the delights of the Purple bar.
Was not disappointed at all in the place from the moment I met the concierge.
I had phoned in advance and asked to enter the purple bar as a non-resident.
This, I was told, is never a problem and I received an email saying I was on the guest list and it should be fine to come down on tuesday evening.
After browsing the ""rather"" expensive menu I decided on a martini cocktail......which was so addictive I drank more than 4 of them that evening.
On the celebrity side of things I was pleased to have met and spoken to a very friendly young American lady called 'Pink'. She was talking to her small group of 3 friends about her house in the States, her wedding ring ..etc...
It was such a private lil hideaway that celebs feel safe, chilling out in the Purple bar, and I felt comfortable bringing my friend there.
If you don't mind spending a quite a bit of money then this is your place!!!
ENJOY!!

132,Awesome! Amazing! Astonishing! Triple AAA!,"Stayed at Sanderson hotel 18-22 February 2006, and it was a fabulous experience. Everything about the hotel is great. The décor all over the place is fantastic, from the beautiful lobby, the attractive long bar with its striking garden, the intimate purple bar, the lovely billiard room, the sophisticated restaurant, the stunning aqua spa area and the gorgeous rooms. Yes it is definitely a Philip Starch experience and if you don’t like that style you should go elsewhere. The service is brilliant. I have been to St Martin’s lane as well, which is very nice, but this is the flagship! I have stayed at many other top class hotels in London, but this is going to be my regular spot in the future. Go there and experience something different! Enjoy!

132,Sanderson - relaxing and sexy,"After a very long and stressful 2005, my husband decided to take me for a surprise break to London and we stayed at the Sanderson hotel. My husband has stayed there on business many times. He often talks about the hotel and the staff, but I have never been.
The whole experience was simply magical and I think Christmas time in London made it more so.
The rooms are very dream-like and very very white (amazingly clean - you can tell that I am a housewife and mother!). A real treat for me was the spa - Agua - I felt as if I had drifted off to another world.
Thank you Sanderson. You have chilled out a stressed out Mummy!
Fingers crossed that I can visit Sanderson again.",5,2006,01,16
132,Hype - but better than OK,"Standard rooms are VERY small and decoration is amusing for a day or two but no longer. Premium rooms are very expensive - one can find better for one's money.

Service is excellent.

Bars are good - restaurant is poor.

Trendy.

Good for a weekend on the town.

132,superb hotel and service,"Second time at the hotel on a business trip. Excellent service from check in to check out. Room service is a bit overpriced and foreign exchange rates are not competitive although there is a FX exchange within a five minute walk. Agua spa is woth a visit, buy book ahead for any treatment. Long Bar is a must, noisy and jammed from 6 pm on Friday evenings, but the Purple room is rather quiet. Not for eveyone since this is a non traditional hotel but if you are into design, fashion, media, and music, you will not de disappointed.
",5,2005,07,05
132,Overrated,"Let's start with the obvious - the Long Bar is a great, trendy, very expensive restaurant that's a draw for people in London, and a fun part of staying at this hotel. But I was otherwise very disappointed in this place, as I seem to be lately with all the Shrager properties. The service was inconsistent - ranging from calm and professional to aloof and judgemental. The room were incredibly small, and while chic, it felt cold and impersonal. But what surprised me was that it was quite noisy; I could clearly hear people in the hallway all night long. When I went to check out, there was a huge screw up with extra charges and it took far longer than necessary to get settled, making me nearly miss my flight to the airport. (I was there an extra 40 minutes!) I wouldn't stay here again.
",3,2005,07,01
132,A fantastic Stay,"My husband and I stayed at the Sanderson to take a break for the weekend. We arrived on Friday, and found ourselves in a different world.  The sleek designs were amazing, and the staff were absolutely amazing.  The manager on duty checked us in (Jason?).  He knew our names before I had even got to the front desk, and remembered it for the entire stay.  We asked for his help a number of times throughout the two nights, and he was always happy to help-truly one of the best i have ever seen.  All other staff were only too happy to help, and amazingly intuitive to whatever you could possibly be wanting.  Suzie, the concierge, was able to get me into the perfect restaurant for us (at very limited notice), simply by asking me one or two questions, and the cocktails in the purple bar were among the finest we have ever had.

I would stay there again and again for a weekend of fun or simply to unwind.  The hotel is amazing, but the staff are incredible.
",5,2005,06,03
132,Will never stay here again!,"We had won a weekend holiday in London and were booked into the Sanderson hotel.  As it was a 5 star luxury hotel we were really looking forward to it.  On check in, the receptionist kept clicking away on her computer for ages before we asked if there was a problem and she said ""yes, i do not have a booking for you.""  We were made to wait for approx 40 mins before they realised that they did have a room for us, apparently there had been some mix up somewhere!!!!
We made our way to the lifts only to find it pitch black inside apart from moon and stars decor on the walls, exiting the lift to our floor we found that was also pitch black apart from small lights outside each door illuminating the room numbers.  When entering our room it felt like we were in a hospital ward, net curtains in abundance with white walls and bedding.
No dressing table, no wardrobe and only one socket (not practical for women who use hairdryers and tongs!!).  Prices were ridiculous, cup of coffee @£4.62 and a gin and tonic and glass of water in the residents bar £13.50.  We actually checked out a day early and were glad to get home to some normality.  If you want a futuristic clinical hotel this is it, otherwise don't waste your time....or money!!!!!
",1,2005,04,12
132,"Modern, expensive and a bit overrated","If you like minimalistic surroundings, this hotel is the place to be. The rooms are very white and there is hardly any furniture, only a desk and a bed. The bed was lovely though. I usually have trouble sleeping in hotelbeds but not this time. The bathroom was nice. Orange sink, great shower and a green lit mirror. The toilet seemed a bit cheap and it wasn't attached very well. The other thing that bothered me was the fact that there was no closet. I had to leave my clothes in my suitcase. 
The staff was very friendly and attentive. However, DONT LET THEM ARRANGE A CAB FOR YOU! The hotel has a deal with the most expensive cab-service in London. We partied in the same area for two nights. The first night the hotel arranged a cab for us: We payed 25 pounds. The next night we arranged one ourselves (an official radiotaxi) and only had to pay 6 pounds. The bars in the hotel were very nice and we had some expensive but lovely cocktails. The only negative thing I can think of was that the people in the white bar were a bit pretentious. The hotel is located in Soho, the place to be. But the street in which it is situated is truely the most boring street in Soho. If you are into hip minimalistic designerhotels you can better stay at St. Martins Lane, a hotel of the same group. The rooms were a bit smaller but nicer (with light in adjustable colours) and the location is so much better: in the heart of Soho in a street that is alive and vibrant.

132,Great Hotel,"Spent a weekend at this hotel last month and loved it to bits.  The receptionists were great and the camp concierge guy was a scream, coming out with some great one liners.  Took my 13 year old daughter who thought he was fab and the hotel ultra cool.  COuldnt quite work out initially why check in/check out along with any request was dealt with in such a hassle free way.... then wondered if it was because they were all male??  just a thought.....

Great lobby , loved the art and furniture.  Lifts are whacky and should think very strange if you were worse for wear!  

The long bar was very trendy and packed the Sat night we stayed - although trying to get a 13 year old through the bar to the Spoon Restaurant situated at the other end of the bar was not an experience to be repeated although she thought fun!  The waiter kindly found us another way back to our room when we had finished.  The food and service in Spoon was excellent as was the breakfast the following morning although there wasnt much of it!

The room we had was very stylish but as a previous reviewer has mentioned a bit Ikeaish.  We tried to book some Spa treatments but apparently have to book weeks in advance so that was a little disappointing but overall a great hotel and would certainly stay again.
",5,2005,04,05
132,"Crazy place, good time","We arrived in the Sanderson late one night, having travelled for about 15 hours from the Indian sub continent. The bar was busy, a good sign, and the lobby was not crowded with people. The desk staff were very helpful (and attractive!) and we were shown to our room straight away. The lifts were the first ""unusual"" thing you notice about this hotel, as they were black with dance music playing in the background instead of the usual muzak. 

Our room smelled of smoke. We weren't sure what to do (we were very tired) but eventually decided we wanted to change, which was quick and efficiently done. The bellboys didn't even grumble when they had to carry all our bags back down to the lobby again (although we did tip generously).

Now, here's the thing. The Sanderson is a ""hip"" hotel, a ""minimalist"" hotel, whatever that means. If you expect to walk in and find the usual comforting ambience then be prepared for a shock. There is nothing in the room. A big bed in the middle, facing away from the door, turned to an angle. A writing table / headboard behind the bed, with two bed side tables. A TV. Strangely shaped metal weights on the wall. And that's it. Everything is white. We didn't even know where the lockers were!

I was very tired and a little moany and wasn't in the mood for the artiness of the place. The toilet / shower doesn't have a door, but a curtain - automatic at that. The sink is free standing and again positioned at an angle in the room. There's an odd painting hanging on the ceiling over the bed. 

However, once I got in to bed, things started looking up. It was amazing - the sheets and duvet and pillows were all feather and so unbelievabley comfortable. I drifted off in no time.

Next morning, we went for breakfast and I am still drooling over it. Fantastic! You don't get much, but what you do get is just super. The best poached eggs I have ever eaten, and the sausages were great. Very attractive, friendly waiting staff.

The concierge was hilarious. As camp as they come, he informed us he ""wouldn't be seen dead darling!"" in Camden, as we asked if he knew the area! A very nice guy though, he helped us find some obscure shop we were looking for. 

Purple bar was nice, but as mentioned by others, there was no one in it! We met a London friend and had a drink, but even later when we came back from dinner, there was still no one there. The main bar was bustling though. We didn't stay for a drink, we just wanted to get back into that bed!

By now I was used to the quirky room. In time I got to love it. If you arrive tired after a long flight it is kinda weird, but if you arrive with an open mind and in the mood for something new, then its great. The door staff were great, helpful for holding taxis and opening doors etc.

By the way, don't order room service, absurdly expensive!
",4,2005,01,26
132,We stayed for 'New Year' at the Sanderson,"and had an excellent time. The staff were really friendly and made us feel very welcome. Two very different bars to choose from and the most bizarre lift/elevators around !
",5,2005,01,04
132,The details could be better for the price...,"We stayed at the Sanderson for a week in October. We're familiar with the Morgans Group aesthetic and approach to service, so were not surprised when we arrived at an eclectic, trendy, but comfortable hotel in a prime location.

The room was comfortable, and I like the emphasis and space given to the bathroom. My only gripes were the insufficient storage, tiny desk, and charge for internet access.

Service-wise, they let us down a few times. First, we were promised an Amex Platinum upgrade at check-in, but it never materialized. After some cajoling, they offered us a slightly bigger room in the same category (""deluxe"" at almost $US500 per night). It was still just a room, albeit with a freestanding bath. We also had three separate problems with room service. I think it was mostly a language barrier--don't expect perfect English in London. The concierge was enthusiastic, if not really very inspired--all his suggestions seemed to be too conveniently located in the neighborhood. London is bigger than Soho.

The gym is good, and the place has a buzz, but on the whole I would be inclined to try the Kemps' Soho Hotel the next time I want to stay in the neighborhood.",3,2004,12,22
132,Great Hotel,"Enjoyed our stay at the Sanderson very much, a little nervous before we arrived due to some pretty bad reviews, we had already booked and paid for 8 nights in advance so had no choice but to continue with the booking and expected the worst, but we were very surprised with everything, staff, room, gym, breakfast, everything was great, would definately recommend the hotel and if in London again would only stay there...Great location...

132,I will come back !,"I took my wife to London for our wedding anniversary and we chose the Sanderson for all its hype... and we were not dissapointed ! Everything was excellent, from the room to the staff ! We had an excellent time there drinking martinis at the Long Bar (thank you Roberto), eating at the the Spoon+ and chilling out at the most excellent Purple Bar. Only problem : you just don't want to go out ! If you love design, bars and eating then you will love this place. Just to be honest the Spoon+ isn't the best restaurant out there but it sure is on the top list for trendy eating hideouts.
",5,2004,12,08
132,"Stylish, but not great.","I was recently in London on business and looked forward to the peaceful, tranquil minimalist white rooms of the very stylish Sanderson. What I ended up with was a room on the first floor just above the bar which has a live dj and is very noisy. My room was far from peaceful. I called up and asked to be moved and the staff were very polite. They didn't have a room but would call me tomorrow and move me for the remainder of my trip. They didn't call. This went on for days until eventually they closed the bar for a private function. Not only were hotel guests excluded from the bar and dining area, the party had a live band and was EVEN LOUDER. This went on until 1am and the staff could do nothing to help.

The room itself was okay but a little dark as it was on the inside of the building. I've stayed there before and had a much lighter room on the outside and would definitely ask for one of those. It was still very stylish and comfortable with a dvd player and a nicely stocked minibar. Great bed and bed linen.

So... ask for an outside room on a high floor and you should be fine. The staff were very friendly, just a bit useless at times. The room service is good but don't expect to get everything you order. The wake-up calls are unreliable so take an alarm clock.

All in all I much prefer the St. Martins Lane hotel from the same group.
",2,2004,11,16
132,Perfect!,"Absolutely the best hotel I've ever been to!

The decoration throughout is super-cool, but the staff really friendly so we felt right at home!  The room (a standard one) was excellent with the legendary glass bathroom and painting on the ceiling and a reasonable size for London.

The purple bar is tiny and totally candlelit with the most amazing martini menu - including chocolate ones - £8 or £9 each though so don't go mad! Breakfast out in the courtyard garden under the heaters was wonderful - we could have stayed there all day.

If you love modern design and want luxury without all the usual 5-star snobbery this is the hotel for you!

",5,2004,11,16
132,What a nightmare!,"I prepaid a reservation at Sanderson for 2 nights, it was $485US per night.  For that amt of money, you would expect they actually would have a room for me at 7pm when I tried to check in.  They did not, and they shuffled me across the street to a much less desirable location.  This hotel put two authorizations on one of my credit cards (presumably for the room, which was supposedly prepaid by Sanderson) that I gave them for incidentals, for a total of $1200 credit that is still tied up.  The second night the Sanderson did have a room for me, but I preordered breakfast that never arrived.  I gave up and left the hotel after waiting for an hour.  They did nothing to compensate me financially for the fact that they had moved me to a less desirable location the first night, and said 'sorry about the breakfast.'
Lovely.

132,Service and Staff are shocking,"One of the worst hotels i have ever stayed at.  Inital appreance is good but the service and staff are arrogant and self absorbed.  The staff a rude the sevice shocking.  They ruined our wedding nite.  My wife was locked in a toilet for 20mins, during her massage they cut her eye and when we confronted the manager he response was sorry but there is nothing we can do...ha....We have started legal action against the hotel.....do yourself a favour dont book here.

132,Saw celebs and clubbed in Soho!!,"We loved it!  Saw celebs and had a fabulous night. The room was small, gorgeously decorated and the shower was divine.  Got a good rate and could not moan and the restaurant in the courtyard does the best ever burger and chips at a great price!  The staff were rather annoying and the furniture made you feel rather uncomfortable and you felt like it was more art than sitting down but all in all we had a great stay and the location is fabulous!  I agree about the Purple Room, I expected to see a load of sexy celebs all huddled up in there behind the exclusive 'I am staying therefore a member' purple curtain but it was just us and it was a Saturday night at 2am!!  We had fun without anyone else to stare at but if you are paying more than £200 for the night, I would think again.....loved it for location, design, cheap food, long bar and Soho but not what I was expecting.   I guess if you can afford a suite or can get a suite bargain, you may get to lord it and really appreiciate it.  Our room was rather Ikea but saying that we stayed out so late we didn't really care and there was that shower.....xxx
",4,2004,09,05
132,"Exceeded Expectations ... Brilliant, as the Brits would say!","This is one place that certainly lived up to all the hype.  Not one bit disappoited.  We were lucky enough to be upgraded to the deluxe room at no extra charge.  Yes, this hotel is extremely modern (some would say strange), but in this case, it works.  Bravo, Ian Schrager.

The only thing I would say is that you should try to bring someone that you're entirely comfortable with to share the room with you, as the sheer curtains, even though they say the pink one is ""opaque"", you can still pretty much see what is going on in the sink and in the toilet areas from the bedroom when the bathroom lights are on.  The shower is back in the corner, so no problem there.  Otherwise, you have to use the toilet with the light off to avoid a public display of your private moment.

The pictures on the ceiling were a riot (we would never get away with that in earthquake-prone California), and the Long Bar was fantastic.  Yes, it is jammed with somewhat-beautiful people (not supermodels, don't get carried away), and most are not wearing runway fashions, they are wearing business suits, as the early 30-something London executive crowd tends to drop by straight from work.

I found the Purple Bar to be somewhat depressing.  Yes, it's for guests only, but I never saw more than one person in there ... I guess it would be great for closet alcoholics that don't want to be seen drinking in public, but the Long Bar is much more inviting and not as intimidating as some of the other users make it sound.  The bartenders are fantastic.

The space-travel elevators were fun, as was the funky furniture in the lobby.  Fantastic service, and a really super-friendly non-pretentious staff too.  They didn't even have that stiff British formality you sometimes find in London hotels; everybody was very approachable.

This is a VERY sexy place, great for a special splurge for a romantic date (wasn't my case this time unfortunately, but maybe the next time around).

If you can afford it, and your idea of a nice London hotel doesn't resemble something out of Buckingham Palace, stay at the Sanderson!

132,My first date!,"I was taken to the Sanderson by a lovely man that I had just met and he couldn't have picked a better place - I was very impressed and will remember it for the rest of my life.

132,Sanderson -- Vast Improvements,"I stayed at Sanderson for the fourth time from April 25 to April 28.  My room was booked at the Ian Schrager Hotels website at a promotional rate of 310 quid for what previous experience taught was a nicely-sized, deluxe room -- including a guaranteed upgrade and a complimentary bottle of Champagne.  I figured I would be upgraded to a deluxe room with treadmill.

From the very beginning, I could tell that a new days has dawned across the Ian Schrager empire; I first witnessed, last December, that staff at Clift had become friendly, proactively helpful and faultlessly sincere and polite.  The maids there were greeting me in the halls, for crying out loud.  I wish everyone who makes ridiculous assumptions that non-English or new-English speaking people cannot provide a ""wow"" level of service could have seen Clift's staff in action.  ""Friendly"" translates around the globe.

But back to Sanderson...after a warm welcome and assistance from the door/bellman my travel companion and I  had a few laughs with the front desk staff.  We were early, so they kindly offered us a cuppa and to have our luggage stored.  We declined the cuppa and instead went to Agua Spa to confirm our appointments which we'd made on the nifty (though not failsafe) ""Customization"" option you can choose through the website -- this service purports to allow you to customize your room amenities and dinner reservations around town, and they offer to meet other special requests.  

As a test of the system, I made two requests.

First, I asked the concierge to book a table at Gordon Ramsay on Royal Hospital Road one month in advance of my visit (GR takes reservations one month to the day in advance only and it fully books within an hour).  It is notoriously hard to book, and I wanted to see what pull the hotel had at culinary hot spots around town.  Disappointingly, I never heard from anyone at the hotel about this request, nor was it mentioned at check-in.  Luckily, I had gotten up at 1am where I live, one month in advance, and made reservations under the name of my traveling companion. 

On a less grand scale, I also ordered a bowl of ripe pears to be placed in the room prior to our arrival (nitpicky, but not impossible to obtain nor too pricey!)...in the end, we checked in and found Sanderson also failed the pear test, but it was one of only a couple relatively minor stumbles.  Still, it matters when you offer a service and don't follow through.

But any fruit frets were dissipated when, upon entering our room in the afternoon, we were stunned to find we had been upgraded to a ""Loft suite king w/balcony, tub and shower, landscaped terrace, floor-to-ceiling windows "" (room 607) -- these rooms are not only Phillipe ""Carved glass furnishing, glass walls and diaphonous curtains"" Starck at his greatest, they also feature an expansive wood-planked outdoor terrace given privacy by a hedgerow of bamboo, planted in oversized gray flowerpots.  Across the way is Chaplin's furniture store and Fitzrovia, Oxford Street, Covent Garden and Soho beckon just down Berners Street.

Sanderson service was exceptional from beginning to end.  The turn-down lady at night, the desk staff, the bar staff (especially Purple Bar) and room service were all a pleasure to interact with -- good looking people with a mind for the customer.  A great recipe for hospitality!  

This Agua Spa experience was an improvement over my most recent -- I walked out last December after they were 25 minutes late getting me in for my treatment.  This time everything ran like friendly clock-work.  Gabby was my therapist, and she did a great facial and massage (Eve Lom facial).  A guy in a spa?  Eeeek!  Well get over it...a good looking woman pampering you for 90 minutes has to appeal to somebody, I would think...

Beauty in the details contributes a differentiated, positive experience in a hotel.  To that end, it's worth pointing out that the complimentary welcome bottle of Champagne could have been Cuvee Eurotunnel 2004, but it turned out to be Laurent- Perrier NV and that ain't bilge water.  It was a nice touch to see that a hotel charging me 5 quid for a packet of mini-bar crisps stepped up to form when it was their turn to splurge.

The room appeared freshly painted -- it was impeccably clean and the Starck design touches (aside from a few small holes in the diaphonous room dividing curtains and hardwood floor scuffs) were in day-one condition...this is particularly relevant in Sanderson's case, since it made such a fuss about its cutting edge look.  There's nothing more pathetic than highly trumpeted technology and design that either doesn't work or fails to achive a basic ""wow.""  I've been in hotels that think they're XBox, but are really just a bad game of Pong.

I walked out of the Sanderson with a nearly-confirmed, positive re-estimation of the Schrager chain.  It's damned expensive to stay at Sanderson, but it's more expensive at other places and a lot less fun -- a certain place on Park Lane, for instance.  Thus, given that i got all the design and all the service I expect at the rate, and given the amazing room upgrade, I felt that the 1078 quid with tax, 2 Agua Spa facials (at 98 quid each with added charges for spa entry and gratuity), phone calls, mini-bar crisps and half-bottle of white wine, and room service breakfast was numbingly expensive for 2 nights but worth every penny in the most hedonistic way.

All this place ever needed was a smile and a sense of competence to match the aesthetics of its physical and human resources, and right now it's sunshine on Berners Street, even when it rains (hard during our visit, with thunder and lightning!).  But we were next on our way to an overnight at Clift in San Francisco. Would it be as good an experience?  Only a 10 hour plane ride stood between us and the answer....

132,Sexy Sanderson,"The hotel is a lot of fun but is definately not for everyone. If you're more for traditional this hotel is probably not for you. Everything is unique from the lips chair in the lobby to the space theme and music in the elevator. One thing you'll notice is theres curtains everywhere which creates a sort of sexy atmosphere. Both the Purple Bar (for guests only) and the Long Bar are beautiful and serve great original martinis. The restaurant Spoon isn't cheap but your meal looks like a work of art. The pillows and sheets in the rooms are really comfortable and the bathrooms are definately something different. Watch out for the showers tho they tend to flood. The spa, Agua, is excellent and very relaxing. The whole experience overall was just a lot of fun and the service is great",5,2004,04,28
132,Top-Notch,"What a hotel! I have stayed in another Ian Schrager hotel in London, so my expectations were already high. From the moment we walked through the door, we were greeted exuberantly by Peter and the front desk staff. We were treated to a tour of the hotel's highlights by Peter and shown to our room. Nothing could have prepared us for a room like this...simply superb in its subtelty! Booked for a late dinner at Spoons and was not disappointed...great food, great wine recommendation by the Sommelier. Then, had drinks in the Purple Bar...quite an extravagance for for hotel guests only and well worth it. We are planning a trip back just for the spa!",5,2004,02,23
132,The Sublime Sanderson,"I stayed at the Sanderson for 16 days on a business trip last summer. I loved the design of the hotel, from the Lips sofa that greets you inside the door, the diaphanous curtains throughout the Long Bar and many panels of faceted Venetian glass.The room was spotless, well-appointed and attended to twice a day by the housekeeping staff. All sheets, pillowcases, even the duvet cover were changed every single day. The bed was a heaven of comfort. And the air conditioning, during one especially steamy London week, was blessed and chilly relief.The shower was finally one in the U.K. that an American can figure out -- it was wonderful, always plenty of hot water. I loved the innovative Philippe Starck designs. The bowl sink was set into a red Venetian glass table that afforded lots of room for necessities. Four large plastic bin-drawers were perfect for storing toiletries. Just pull one out and put it on the red table.The staff was wonderful -- from check in on. Thom, the Concierge looked after every need and tracked down an errant package and gave me twice daily updates, then tracked me down in the restaurant and personbally handed it to me.Breakfast in the Long Bar was an ample buffet and each morning Chai would specially make me a giant espresso, taking the ordinary coffee away saying, This isnt for you!I had dinner at Spoon+ twice and lunch once. The food was superb, and the sommelier made glass by glass recommendations that enhanced the food superbly.The Long Bar is quite a scene, starting at 4 each day. By 6 you cant get near it. How fortunate there is the Purple Bar, just for guests. Their vodka martinis are the best!Although it is pricey, I would jump at the chance to stay at the Sanderson again. They treated me royally, and my experience couldn't have been better.",5,2003,11,26
132,What a Hotel!,"My husband and I stayed at the Sanderson in November 2002. What a hotel! It fits in the category of minimalist chic, yet it is very comfortable. The bed was large and soft, and very comfortable, with a 400 threat count duvet cover. There was a stereo and CDs in the room, which was a nice extra that you normally don't have in hotel rooms. 
There was lots of storage space for bags and clothing. The bathroom was huge. The hotel is very well located, in the heart of the Oxford area, and we walked to all the sights and shopping. The restaurant there, Spoon, is the best restaurant I have ever eaten at (really!), and the room service was honestly the best I have ever had. My husband and I enjoyed the bars there, the Purple Bar and Long Bar. Really, we didn't have to leave the hotel for a night out if we did not want to. The staff was also extremely accomodating at all times. And, the rates were reasonable. I just came back from another trip to Europe and I wish there were ""Ian"" hotels where we stayed. If you're going to London, you can't go wrong with this hotel.",5,2003,10,24
132,Superb,What a hotel. This is a great place if you're hip. We loved it when we stayed here as part of our honeymoon recently. Can't wait to go back.,5,2003,07,24
132,Nice but,"Interesting hotel in concept and design, but does all minimalist content just hide the fact that it is a converted office building? The Long Bar is cool, and the garden patio pleasant, but the Purple Bar and Pool room seem juvenile. All of this may appeal to some, but when the phones go down, help rather than sarcasm or platitudes would be appeciated. This is not a business friendly hotel, except for the ""working girls"" at the bar, I guess!",2,2003,06,19
132,Good option in London,"The hotel is very well located, all the tourist attractions were close and there was a great culinary offering, a nice place with first-class service, everyone was super friendly, the room was a good size but poorly distributed, the breakfast did not correspond to a 5*, very little variety .",4,2024,05,23
132,Top,"Top! Structure, location, staff and food!
Special praise to Vito, front desk, for his kindness, professionalism and availability.
And to Elena for her kindness and great availability
It must be said that people like them make the difference in these stays",5,2024,04,25
132,Exceptional service,"We enjoyed a wonderful stay at the Sanderson Hotel, where every aspect exceeded our expectations. The decoration is very original and the service was truly exceptional. Without a doubt we will return soon to live another wonderful experience.",5,2024,01,11
132,Not even the shadow of what was,"The hotel is not a shadow of what it once was. The staff is not very attentive, you have to wait a long time at reception, since most of the time there is only one person.
Rooms regular cleaning. That's if the mattress and pillows are unbeatable. Expensive and regular breakfast. When I had the toast I didn't have the coffee and when I had the coffee I didn't have the toast.
No hotel details of that category. None
They don't even take your suitcases up.
My room was one of the superior ones, but since I asked for two beds we ended up at the end of a long hallway, on the first floor, to get there you had to go through the reception area and behind some fire doors there was the hallway. The windows of the rooms overlooked a gloomy patio and you could even hear sounds of goods being unloaded. They do charge it as one of the best in the hotel, perhaps because it was so big (just for that reason)",3,2023,12,08
132,Cheer up London,"Hotel situado muy cerca de Oxford St ideal para ir a principales atracciones de la ciudad andando o hacer planes de noche.

132,Hotel ottimo per visitare il centro di Londra. ,"L’Hotel si trova  in una posizione perfetta per visitare il centro di Londra.

Il surplus dell’hotel è la gentilezza di FERRUCCIO un ragazzo italiano sempre disponibile e pronto a darti consigli su come ottimizzare al meglio il tempo. ",5,2020,02,04
132,Poca eleganza ma molto ‘trendy’,"Hotel di tendenza, molto pulito camere ampie. Personale alla reception fantastico e pronti a soddisfare ogni tua esigenza.
Verso l’ora dell’aperitivo il cocktail bar dell’hotel comincia a riempirsi di giovani eleganti fini a tarda sera.
Diciamo che è tutto impeccabile, per il mio
Gusto personale un po’ kitch alcuni dettagli. Scomodo in una camera con 5 finestre non avere un pulsante per tirare giù le tende oscuranti...
Colazione in camera ok. 
Manca un po’ quell’eleganza diciamo che contraddistingue i 5 stelle di un certo tipo.
È comunque stato un buon soggiorno. Concierge top.

132,Ottimo hotel,"Hotel ottimo. Posizione strategica per oxford street. Vi ho soggiornato per motivi di lavoro e devo dire che è stata una scelta vincente per la posizione vicino appunto ai negozi.

Ci hanno dato una superior senza aggiungere pagamenti extra. Camera molto ampia pulita ben arredata di design 
Bagno diviso con una bel gioco di tende
Molto luminoso molte finestre.

Non ho provato la colazione purtroppo per i poco tempo a disposizione ma immagino sia buonissima",5,2019,10,10
132,Ottimo ,"Hotel sfruttato pochissimo nella due giorni londinese perché più tempo fuori che dentro. Si nota in ogni modo un servizio di alto livello, una gentilezza, un lusso non sfarzoso. Ottima anche la colazione usufruita. ",5,2019,09,01
132,Tolles Hotel mit sehr aufmerksamen Service,"Habe (leider nur) eine Nacht im Sanderson verbracht.
Von außen ist das Hotel recht unauffällig (was aber nicht negativ ist). Die Lobby ist sehr großzügig gestaltet, man fühlt sich gleich wohl.

Einchecken ist sehr zügig und zuvorkommend. Das Zimmer war angenehm groß mit Sitzecke, großem Fernseher, der auch drehbar an der Wand angebracht war. Die üblichen Amenities wie Wasserkocher, Kaffeemaschine und Mini-bar waren geschickt ""versteckt"", so dass das Zimmer einen schönen aufgeräumten Anblick bot. Das Bett stand im Raum mit zwei Nachttischen, Lese-Stehlampen dabei. Das Bad beherbergte auch den Kleiderschrank-Bereich. Dusche und Toilette jeweils als Separée vom Hauptbadraum abgetrennt.
Abends wurde das Bett aufgeschlagen. Ich hatte auch Roomservice, der auch sehr zuvorkommend war.

Habe mich in diesem Hotel sehr wohlgefühlt und wenn mein Weg mich wieder nach London führt, kehre ich gern zurück.

132,Welcome to excellence,"Welcome to excellence. Welcome to the Sanderson London Hotel. L’accoglienza a cinque stelle del ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Sanderson London Hotel è spigliata, modernamente elegante e piena di vita !. La stessa vita che si respira nelle street londinesi. L’ascensore che vi porterà alle vostre camere è spaziale !. La quintessenza della moderna eleganza la troverete al Sanderson London Hotel. La tolleranza è sempre sintomo d’intelligenza tra popoli. La lingua non sarà quindi un problema a Londra. Camere di taglio molto moderno e ristorazione dai sapori di taglio internazionale. Quindi: più burro, che olio. Long Bar Sanderson da mozzare il fiato per il “florilegio” di eleganza e fiori !!!. Wow !!!.

132,Non è all'altezza di un 5 stelle,"Camera molto luminosa , moderna e spaziosa ma poco funzionale. Una sola presa usb sul comodino , i pulsanti per chiudere le finestre non funzionavano , e per spegnere tutte le luci ci ho messo almeno 5 minuti (troppi pulsanti sparsi in giro per la stanza senza una vera e propria logica), mini bar molto fornito ed in generale esperienza positiva anche se le finiture e il confort non è all'altezza di un 5 stelle. Nota molto negativa il customer service, nessun tipo di benvenuto nè dai ragazzi alla porta ( che parlavano ad alta voce in italiano tra di loro ) nè alla reception quando ho effettuato il check-in , sembrava quasi fossi un problema e non benvenuto. Altra nota negativa la zona colazione , assolutamente non all'altezza di un 5 stelle, poca la scelta dei prodotti 'free',  il resto era alla carta a pagamento, anche qui il receptionist all' ingresso della zona colazione non mi ha degnato di un saluto o un 'buongiorno sig. ... ' mi ha semplicemente chiesto il numero della stanza e di sedermi dove volevo, solitamente in un hotel 5 stelle l' ospite viene accompagnato al tavolo. A pranzo avevamo prenotato per 4 persone e abbiamo passato 10 minuti a discutere con il ragazzo alla reception che non trovava la nostra prenotazione , ci ha fatto chiamare il responsabile che si era occupato della prenotazione , che ha confermato la nostra versione, per poi scoprire che era un errore del receptionist perché stava guardando le prenotazione degli afternoon tea e non quelle del pranzo. La struttura in generale è pulita e tenuta bene ma molto vecchia e 'anni 60', da fuori non sembra assolutamente un'hotel. La posizione è molto comoda perché a 5 minuti a piedi da Oxford Circus. Purtroppo però non lo definirei un hotel a 5 stelle, manca di troppi servizi e il personale non è all'altezza.",2,2019,03,30

132,Modernes Hotel inmitten Londons City,"Das Hotel liegt in einer Seitenstrasse und in einer Minute ist man mitten im Geschehen, es ist sehr modern eingerichtet. 
Uns hat besonders das Frühstücksangebot begeistert, sehr gesunde Auswahl die man auch von der Karte bestellen kann.
Die Zimmer (Standard) sind wie fast immer in London recht klein gehalten und leider nicht sehr gut isoliert, sodass man schon den Verkehr der Strasse hört.",4,2018,08,26
132,Nochevieja en Londres,"Fuimos de forma inesperada a Londres en nochevieja y nos decantamos por este hotel por encontrarse muy céntrico y porque ya nos habíamos quedado en otros de la misma cadena. Quiero destacar que Morgans utiliza un ambientador con un olor muy característico y reconocible en todos sus hoteles,   Cuando entras por la puerta,  de forma inmediata lo reconoces el te hace sentir como en casa.
El hotel está  muy limpio y cuidado, la decoración es muy moderna y la fiesta de nochevieja aceptable.
Precio, atención  y calidad correctas para un hotel de cinco estrellas.",4,2018,08,10
132,Scelte di dubbio gusto per un 5 stelle...,"Sono rimasto sinceramente deluso da questa struttura; mi aspettavo soluzioni di classe e  dal massimo comfort, che però non ho trovato.
La camera è molto grande, ma poco funzionale; non esistono armadi e l'unico posto dove poter appendere un abito è nella zona bagno; anche il lavabo è piccolo e scomodo. Poi è un'impresa spegnere tutte le luci, dato che esistono circa una decina di diversi interruttori..
Di dubbio gusto anche l'astronave - ascensore, completamente al buio..
Nota positiva la colazione, abbondante e variegata.",2,2017,10,29

Hay que verlo.
Por la noche,tienes muchísimo ambiente,a mano derecha,de la entrada,tienes una barra larga muy ambientada y divertida.

La relación precio calidad equilibrada",4,2017,03,18
132,In der gleichen Kette ,"Neben dem St. Martins Lane das 2. Hotel in der Nähe der Oxford Street, welches ausgezeichnet ist. Schöne Bar mit tollem Design durch das ganze Haus. Hippe Leute treffen sich hier an der großen Bar. Speziell auch das Foyer. Aber die Lage in einer Seitenstraße der Oxford Street ist nicht zu toppen. Kommen sicher wieder!",5,2017,01,22
132,Lo mejor el personal del hotel,"Estuvimos en navidades y la experiencia fue muy buena. Hotel muy bien situado que permite ir andando dando un paseo a Oxford street, Piccadilly, Leicester Square, China town, covent garden y el soho. 

El hotel es moderno y el personal muy amable. Muchos españoles trabajando en el hotel que nos atendieron estupendamente. 

La parte negativa, que por la noche se forma bastante jaleo en el bar de abajo y se Oye bastante ruido aunque no era hasta muy tarde. Tambien el bufet del desayuno se queda un poco corto (cafe zumo yogur tostadas y poco mas) para lo que es un hotel de Esta categoria. En cuanto al spa no permeten usarlo a menores de 12 años cosa que nunca he visto en otros donde siempre he Podido acceder con mi hijo.",4,2017,01,01
132,Fashion hotel,"Bellissimo Albergo molto fashion arredato in maniera moderna perfetto come location
Il personale giovane e Cortese
Adatto anche alle famiglie

E' Che la camera aveva solo una finestra molto piccola Ed essendo al primo piano si faceva fatica a vedere 
Fuori, ma poco importa visto Che andavamo in camera solo per dormire!

132,Hotel de moderno y de moda. Muy buena opción,"El Sanderson es un hotel muy moderno que está muy bien situado, sobre todo cerca de la zona de tiendas de Oxford st. El bar de abajo es muy animado y se puede cenar bien en plan informal. La habitación tenía todo lo que puedas necesitar. Incluso unas pesas por si quieres ejercitarte un poco. Por poner alguna pega, era un poco oscura. El baño también moderno y completo. De lo mejorcito de Londres en plan moderno",5,2016,10,13
132,Una mala experiencia ,"Íbamos con muchas ganas después de ver las fotos en la web.. acceso bonito y un vestíbulo muy bonito decorado. El atractivo acaba cuando te enfrentas a unos lúgubres pasillos. La habitación bonita decorada pero poco práctica. Hay que ponerle de acuerdo en seguir los mismos horarios, se oye todo desde el baño a la habitación. Mal descanso con mucho ruido en pasillos también.. 👎👎👎",2,2016,10,12
132,Esagerato e alla fine scomodo,Ho soggiornato per motivi di lavoro sei notti al Sanderson e mi sono ripromessa di evitare da ora in poi gli alberghi firmati Stark. Effettivamente la location di questo albergo è stata strategica perché a pochi minuti dalla galleria dove lavoro e comodo per raggiungere la Frieze Fair a Regents Park ma dormire in una camera da letto con le pareti del bagno fatte di leggera stoffa bianca può essere divertente solo se non si divide la camera con nessuno per non menzionare le pareti della toilette in vetro semitrasparente che mi hanno creato dei seri problemi di privacy. L'arredamento eclettico e di cattivo gusto è ormai un brand negli Stark hotel e quindi si sopporta anche se ormai comincia ad essere datato. Perfetto il servizio! Il personale è gentilissimo. C'è una bella palestra e anche una SPA al primo piano. Il servizio in camera celere e professionale. ,3,2016,10,08
132,Great Hotel,"Hotel in sehr zentraler Lage und trotzdem ruhig. Das Design einfach toll. Nur schade, dass man die Fenster nicht öffnen kann.

132,Pochi Elementi Positivi,"Sono stata qua tre notti con il mio fidanzato. Le ragazze alle reception sono molto snob e mi hanno trattata come se fosse casa loro e mi stessero ospitando gratuitamente senza ricordarsi che ho pagato quasi 600£ per tre notti e che sono delle dipendenti ed io una cliente! Mi spiace che per 4 ragazzine con la puzza sotto il naso ci perda una catena. Non tornerò mai più e lo sconsiglierò. L'esperienza peggiore in un 5 stelle o pseudo tale. L'unica nota positiva é Giuseppe C. alla reception : ragazzo gentile, intelligente perché ha capito la situazione poco piacevole e di una cordialità vista poche volte.",1,2016,09,05
132,Excelente,"Si vas a Londres mi recomendación es este hotel. Es muy diferente e innovador su decoración es muy atractiva Esta muy bien situado y cerca de todos los lugares tanto monumentos como zonas comerciales.

132,MODERNO ECCENTRICO,"Ho soggiornato due notte in questo albergo che si trova in una traversa di Oxford Street quindi estremamente centrale e comodo per visitare le vie dello shopping, Piccadilly, Leicester square, Soho ecc ecc. Il design è estremamente moderno e ricercato, bella la hall, la sala biliardo, la sala esterna stile giapponese e il bar minimale. La colazione è di ottima qualità, ma un po' ristretta per un 5*. Le camere sono sempre in stile moderno, pulite, ma mancano forse di un po' di personalità. Come spesso succede all'estero non esiste il bidet, secondo me grave mancanza per un 5*. In generale dare 4,5 come voto, l'albergo è molto bello, ma ha alcune mancanze come una piscina nella spa per esempio e pecca a mio avviso in alcuni piccoli dettagli e attenzioni che ci si aspettano da un hotel di lusso neanche così economico.",4,2016,05,14

Personal multilingüe, atentos y dispuestos a ayudar, principalmente en recepción. Quizá los únicos ""peros"" que le pondría son: 1) Falta de privacidad porque las habitaciones queda frente a un edificio de oficinas, 2) Ruido. No excesivo, pero sí puede ser incómodo porque el hotel está en una zona de mucho movimiento y 3) El restaurante no es cómodo para grupos medianos (+8 personas).",4,2016,02,01

132,Buen ambiente,"Me ha encantado,la estancia,en este hotel!
Servicio muy correcto.
Tubimos la suerte,de encontrar entre el staff,a una persona Española,que nos hizo,muy buenas recomendaciones.
La decoración super moderna y el bar muy ambientado.
Yo no me lo perdería,si teneis la oportunidad.
Vale la pena",4,2015,03,15
132,Curioso,"Un hotel de moda en lo que era una fabrica, habitaciones muy modernas, buen servicio, el bar restaurante es caro pero al mismo tiempo un local de moda en Londres, la ventaja es que si vas de fin de semana casi ni te mueves del hotel, el ascensor estrellado tiene su ""je ne sais quoi""",4,2015,02,20
132,Hotel moderno pero con clase y distincion,"un hotel singular, muy bien ubicado. moderno pero con clase gracias a la decoracion de phillipe starck.cuidan mucho los detalles y te hacen setir en casa, tanto en la recpecion como en el bar y en los restaurantes. un bar de moda . habitaciones minimalistas pero acogedoras. merece la pena.",5,2015,02,15
132,Ubicación excelente y muy bello,"A sólo unos cuantos metros de las calles más importantes de Londres, cerca de tiendas y restoranes, además caminando podemos llegar a los lugares más emblemáticos de como London Eyes, el palacio, Big ban disfrutando de una bella arquitectura. El hotel es maravilloso y muy elegante, el personal muy amable en todo momento. Siempre una sonrisa y buena disposición a resolver cualquier duda.",5,2014,12,10
132,"Design, efficienza e posizione strategica","Ho soggiornato in questo hotel per complessivi 6 giorni (quattro+due alternati da un giorno fuori città) pochi giorni fa.
L'albergo è in una posizione strategica, a pochi passi da Regent Street e dalla fermata della metropolitana di Oxford Circus, quindi centralissimo.
L'arredamento dell'albergo è moderno e di gran classe (splendidi i due bar e la sala biliardo), sempre molto frequentato anche la sera per un drink.
La camera (la mia era una standard con letto matrimoniale), pur non grandissima, era molto bella, quasi tutta sul bianco, con specchi e tende fluttuanti. Ovviamente pulitissima (è previsto un room service anche nel tardo pomeriggio, con piccola candela lasciata accesa ad illuminare la stanza al vostro ritorno), è munita di televisione a schermo piatto, frigobar fornitissimo, pantofoline e, su semplice richiesta, viene fornito anche il bollitore munito di tutto il necessario per il caffè o il thè (che prima della colazione o nel pomeriggio, è assai comodo).
Wi-Fi gratuito in camera. Letto comodissimo. Accappatoi. 
Colazione abbondantissima e di altissima qualità nella splendida sala al piano terra (cereali, marmellate, pane di vario tipo, brioches, succhi ecc. e, cucinati al momento gustosi piatti caldi  (noi abbiamo mangiato delle squisite uova al prosciutto, un ottimo porridge all'avena con miele e mirtilli e un altrettanto ottimo pancake con sciroppo d'acero). Ottima anche la cena e il servizio in camera.
Il personale è efficiente, gentile e multilingue oltre che molto professionale.
Tra l'altro, avevo dimenticato del denaro nella cassaforte della camera e sono stata subito contattata, una volta rientrata in Italia, per concordare l'invio dello stesso.
Lo consiglio per chi vuole un hotel moderno, comodo ed elegante, a due passi dal centro.
 Io vi ho soggiornato con mio figlio di 9 anni ma è ottimo anche per chi viaggia solo o in compagnia anche per la vivace atmosfera che si respira nel bar dal tardo pomeriggio in poi.
Ottimo e molto divertente anche il The del Cappellaio Matto (in sintonia con l'arredamento surreale dell'hotel). 
Non posso dire nulla sulla spa perché purtroppo non ho avuto il tempo di sperimentarla.",5,2014,08,11
132,Zentrumsnah und persönlich,"Das Sanderson liegt zentral und wirkt sehr cool. Ist es aber nur im positiven Sinn. JJ und Jon an der Rezeption sind super hilfsbereit und extrem nett.Für ein Hotel auf der Insel ist das Frühstück mit gutem Brot, Käse und Nutella für Deutsche eine Freude.",4,2014,04,25
132,"formidabel, unbelievable","wer sichs in london gutgehen lassen will, sollte im sanderson residiere! mitten im zentrum, ausgezeichneter service, schicke flippy designerhotelausstattung, tolle bar-alles was das herz begehrt!!! dafür spart man taxikosten um in die city zu gelangen, denn man ist ja schon dort!",5,2014,04,17
132,Atmosfera ricercata,"Sono stato in questo hotel tempo fa per un viaggio di affari. L'atmosfera è molto ricercata, le stanze molto molto curate e ben disposte con servizi di eccellenza dove predomina il vetro e le trasparenze. La colazione è servita in un ambiente raffinato con pasti all'altezza dell'hotel.",5,2014,03,24
132,L'Hotel dell' incanto,"Sono stata in questo albergo per una vacanza di 5 giorni a Londra.
Le camere sono eccezionali, bellissime!
Il servizio è molto curato, il personale gentile e la colazione molto buona anche se non compresa nella prenotazione.
La posizione è comodissima, praticamente in centro.
Unico neo?
il prezzo, hotel di classe ma molto caro, come del resto lo standard  a Londra",5,2014,03,24
132,Troppo design per un hotel senza bidet!,"Premetto che non è stato scelto direttamente ma consigliato. abbiamo preso un camera standard al 5 piano: molto minimal e come sempre mancanza del bidet che rende la vita di noi italiani emozionante nel decidere se fare la doccia tutte le volte o azzardare a posizione irreali sul lavandino. cmq hotel pulito, personale attento anche se devo ammettere che non mi è stato possibile accedere ad un computer con stampante in quanto il business center era chiuso.....
i rubinetti sono così di design che per chiudere l'acqua devi prendere un asciugamano. molto apprezzato la sistemazione della camera in serata. attenzione durante i weekend in quanto essendo un posto ""giovane"" il bar ""kilometrico"" è pieno di gente fino a notte tarda.
io faccio fatica a vederlo come un albergo di lusso. la posizione è buona e in 2 min si è sulla Oxford e Soho. Secondo me c'è di meglio.",4,2014,02,16
132,"Esta muy bueno, pero para ir en pareja","El hotel está muy bien ubicado, cerca de buenos restaurantes, subte, bares y negocios. La comida en el hotel es buena, todas las noches hay movida en el hotel, es óptimo sí estas soló o también en pareja. Las habitaciones son lindas y originales.
No me parece que sea apto para familias por el ruido y por otro lado hay que tener cuidado con los precios porque todo lo adicional es muy caro.",4,2014,01,31
132,Super,"Ottimo servizio, pulizia accurata delle stanze, staff molto cordiale! Ci tornerei! La posizione è comoda e l'albergo  è davvero molto bello e particolare!  Favoloso il bar per aperitivo! Molto buono anche il ristorante!!! Molto ben frequentato!",4,2013,12,03
132,WOW!,"Immagino sempre casa mia arredata come la camera che avevamo scelto. Il Loft Balcony è qualcosa di speciale ed estremamente unico. Camera spaziosa con un design perfetto:  il comodissimo letto posizionato in mezzo alla stanza, il bagno ultra-moderno con le pareti di vetro, la terrazza circondata con piccole canne di bambù..tutto è perfetto e curato nei minimi dettagli.
La hall e le aree comuni sembrano una galleria d'arte e sono affollatissime ad ogni ora del giorno, dato che bar e ristorante attirano una moltitudine di persone anche dall'esterno.
SPA molto carina ma il trattamento fatto sfortunatamente non è stato dei migliori.
Toernerò presto! Thank you Sanderson!",5,2013,10,27
132,Stiloso,"Design puro...
hotel giovane, pulitissimo e arredato con stile!
Il ristorante e il bar è sempre affollato e ben frequentato.
Ottima la colazione personale giovane e sempre presente e le camere sono magnifiche. Ci ritornerò sicuramente e lo raccomando a tutti quelli che amano gli alberghi di un certo livello",5,2013,10,14
132,Perfetto per chi cerca qualità e stile,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel a fine giugno 2013. Posizionato bene, già all'entrata respiri lo stile moderno e fresco degli hotel ultima generazione. Avevo camera deluxe, molto bella, bianca luminosa e con letto super comodo e avvolgente. Quindi ottima qualità del sonno e riposo. Servizio in camera eccellente, gentilezza e cortesia del personale in ogni momento. Una particolarità il bar all'interno: un locale con ospiti anche esterni, per cui anche non volendo uscire, la sera sai come passare il tempo. 
Lo consiglio",5,2013,09,17
132,"Toll, wenn man es etwas moderner und außergewöhnlich mag","Wer etwas mit modernen und etwas anderen Hotels anfangen kann is im Sanderson gut aufgehoben.
Bauhausklassiker aber auch vieles andere an moderner Kunst ist hier zu finden.
Die Flure erscheinen einem auf den ersten Blick etwas zu dunkel, wenn man sich darauf einlässt, ist der Effekt toll.
An der Bar, welche am Abend auch zum Treffpunkt der Londoner Partyszene wird, ist immer etwas los und Mann tolle Cocktails genießen.
 Kein günstiges Hotel, aber unbedingt eine Reise wert.",4,2013,07,28

Ottima posizione e davvero splendido in tutto!!

Super consigliato per rendere la vostra vacanza indimenticabile!!",4,2013,06,01
132,Bello ma..,"Un discreto hotel nel centro di Londra Oxford street .
Elegante , comodo, niente da dire ma, quando tutto deve diventare design estremizzato sicuramente si paga in comodità. Camera spaziosa, ma con bagno doccia etc a vista. È divisa solo da parete di cristallo. Lavandino molto stilizzato con specchio laterale, molto bello ma veramente scomodo.
Hotel in di Londra con bar alla moda , va bene per clienti molto giovani o se si vuole fare scena.
Comunque servizi e personale ottimi",4,2013,05,26
132,excelente diseno y servicio en muy buena ubicacion,"A metros de Oxford street este hotel disenado por Philippe Stark cuenta con un excelente diseno, cuidados los detalles, muy buen desayuno y confortables habitaciones.

132,Perfektes Stadthotel,"Bereits beim betreten der coolen Lobby fühlt man sich in diesem Morgans Hotel zu hause. Wir wurden persönlich über das Hotel informiert und zu unserem Zimmer geführt. Das aussergewöhnliche Zimmer bietet allen Komfort und man wird jederzeit perfekt betreut. Die zwei Bars werden wie in den Hotels in Los Angeles und San Francisco rege belebt. Es macht einfach Spass die Leute zu beobachten. 
Die Lage ist zentral und trotzdem sehr ruhig. 
Jederzeit wieder!",5,2013,04,24
132,5 Sterne-Preis für ein 3 Sterne-Hotel.,"Obwohl ein Aufenthalt im Sanderson eigentlich ganz vielversprechend beginnt (mehr oder weniger großzügige Hotellobby, Blick auf den eindrucksvollen Billard-Raum mit einem Glaskunstwerk von John Piper sowie die ""Long Bar"" zur Rechten) und auch das Betreten des spacig gestalteten Aufzugs Großes erwarten lässt, wird man spätestens beim Erreichen des jeweiligen Stockwerks mit einem unheilvollen ""Bing"" aus seinen Träumen gerissen. In unserem Fall war die Freude leider von besonders kurzer Dauer (1. Stock). Durch muffige, verschlissene Gänge, die man ansonsten nur in Motels im mittleren Westen der USA anfindet, geht es über einen dreckigen violetten Teppich gen Zimmer (Nummer: 123). 

Das Zimmer ist von der Größe ok, vom Rest leider nicht. Es gibt nur zwei kleine Fenster am Ende des Raums, die sich nicht öffnen lassen. Luft kann lediglich über eine Klimaanlage zugeführt werden, ein untragbarer Zustand. Fernseher (unnötig kompliziert zu bedienen), Safe und Minibar sind in einem häßlichen Kasten versteckt, der so ganz und gar nicht zum Designanspruch des Hotels passt. Und außerdem vor den zwei winzigen Fenstern steht, damit noch weniger Licht ins Zimmer kommt. Beim verglasten Badezimmer gibt es statt Türen nur Vorhänge, die elektrische Bedienung für die Vorhänge war defekt. Durch die fehlende Tür und die dadurch fehlende Intimsphäre hätte man das WC eigentlich gleich neben das Bett frei im Raum platzieren können. Steckdosen gibt es im Badezimmer übrigens keine, wozu auch. Ein Wasserhahn mit Kalt- und Warmwassermischer sollte in einem Hotel dieser Klasse eigentlich Standard sein. Fehlanzeige. Warum die Putzfrau jedesmal eine Kerze im Zimmer anzündete, die noch den letzten Sauerstoff verbrauchte, blieb ein Rätsel. Wer Frischluft will, muss das Fenster einschlagen. 
Internet kostet 10 Pfund pro Tag, was bei den Zimmerpreisen eine bodenlose Frechheit ist. Das Frühstück war der einzige Lichtblick, obwohl die Wartezeiten auf eine Eierspeise hart an der Grenze waren. Wer übrigens nur ein Croissant vom Buffet naschen will, muss automatisch das Continental Breakfast bezahlen, das um die 20 Pfund kostet. Nicht sehr kundenfreundlich. 

Das einzige, was an diesem Hotel mit 5 Sternen zu bewerten ist, ist der Preis. Schade, von Hotels der Morgans Group bin ich eigentlich besseres gewohnt.",1,2013,04,06
132,Einfach nur Klasse,"Erst einmal ist das Hotel gut gelegen. Von Heathrow kommend einfach in den Heathrow Express, von Paddington mit der Metro oder mit dem Taxi ca. 10 Minuten und man ist mitten in London. Marleybone / Westminster ist eine schöne Ecke und man kommt gut überall hin.
Das Personal war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit, sowohl an der. Rezeption, beim Frühstück, Housekeeping etc. 
Die Zimmer sind sehr geräumig (auch in der Standard Kategorie), haben eine moderne, eigenwillige Einrichtung und bieten Komfort, Platz und Ruhe. Für meinen Geschmack war das Bett sehr bequem, Decke und Kissen sehr gut.
Zimmer und öffentliche Bereiche im Hotel waren vorbildlich sauber.
Das Frühstück fand ich phänomenal und ausgewogen im Angebot. Besonders empfehlenswert die Eier Benedikt.

Ich habe mich rundum wohl gefühlt und würde jederzeit wieder hier buchen.",5,2013,03,05
132,Muy buena relación calidad precio,"El Sanderson es una muy buena opción para alojarse en Londres. Me he quedado en este hotel un par de fines de semana y seguiré haciéndolo ya que creo que es un hotel muy cómodo, limpio y con todos los servicios que uno puede esperar de un hotel de lujo manteniendo precios muy razonables.
tanto el restaurante como el bar están muy animados durante la noche y el personal que parece sacado de una pasarela de moda es muy amable y siempre están dispuestos a ayudarte si necesitas algo.",4,2013,02,18
132,Eccellente,"abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel i primi di gennaio, hotel di design, stanza spaziosa, letto magnifico, alla reception molto gentili e disponibili, ottima location per visitare il centro di Londra, consigliatissimo",5,2013,02,07
132,Capolavoro di design,"Trasformato in un capolavoro di design da Philippe Starck, il palazzo anni 50 di Berners Street (una traversa di Oxford Street) è uno degli alberghi più esclusivi di Londra. Le stanze, con bagno a vista circondato da vetrate, hanno enormi letti napoleonici argentati e sculture improbabili a forma di uovo. Forse un po' troppo kitsch ma d'effetto. I prezzi esorbitanti sono assolutamente in linea con la tipologia di clienti (rappers, stilisti, attori) che si incontrano nella hall. La posizione è ottima: a pochi passi ma fuori dal delirio di Oxford Street.",5,2013,01,06
132,SUUUPER,"Wir waren begeistert von diesem Hotel. Das Zimmer (Superior-Room) war recht gross und hell (Fenster an der ganzen Front). Das Badezimmer war riiiiiesig :-) konnte man sich richtig Platz lassen fürs Schickmachen. Badezimmer ist auch nur durch einen Vorhang und einer Scheibe vom Schlafraum getrennt, was den ganzen Raum sehr gemütlich wirken lässt. Das Bett ist superbequem. Das Personal war sehr nett, die Bar schick und stylisch. Ein weiterer Pluspunkt ist sicher die Lage, 5 Minuten zu Fuss in der Shoppingstrasse.",5,2013,01,04
132,Stylisches Hôtel mitten in Soho,"Lustige Location. Komplett untypisch fuer London. Modern, stylisch und nett. Lustiges Publikum in der Bar, gemischte Altersstruktur und multinational.

132,OTTIMO!,"dopo tanti hotels a londra è la mia prima volta al SANDERSON, ci siamo trovati benissimo,bello ,allegro , sempre molto ben frequentato,  lounge bar sempre pieno di bella gente, molto comodo, prezzo non eccessivo soprattutto se paragonato ad altre situazioni.
Materassi favolosi!!!",5,2012,08,31
132,Maestro philippe starck.,"La genialità degli arredi e dei particolari lascia senza fiato.
La stanza ricca di ogni comfort, perfino Xbox e sigarette in stanza. Letto meraviglioso, frigo fornitissimo, lettore iPod, bagno con vasca divisa dalla stanza da una tenda.
Ascensore buio illuminato solo dalla riproduzione del cielo stellato.
La colazione in camera ben servita e ricca.
Il meraviglioso bar dell'albergo, frequentato anche dagli esterni, all'altezza. Drink non completamente di livello sebbene ben studiati, ma frequentazione elegante e dj set ogni sera. Lo consiglierei anche solo per una bevuta di coppia o con gli amici.
Punta di diamante: il purple bar con una selezione pazzesca di vodka.
Tutto forse un po' troppo caro, ma ciò che e' di moda e curato si paga....
L'albergo e' anche dotato di spa.
Unico neo: quando abbiamo prenotato una stanza fumatori, non ci e' stato detto che il prezzo era maggiorato rispetto a quello selezionato on line.
Posizione dell'albergo centrale e vicino alle stazioni tube di tottenham court road e Oxford circus.",4,2012,02,07
132,Cool!!!!,"Sono stata per un weekend a fine agosto,con due amiche,posizione incredibile per lo shopping londinese, nel pieno centro della citta'. Hotel di design....con particolare attenzione ai piccoli dettagli nelle camere,bellissima l'idea di accendere un light profumato,durante la messa a notte della camera.
Ottima la colazione in camera,poco ricca quella al buffet.",5,2012,02,07
132,Bellissimo Bar,"Lo scorso anno sono stato diverse volte al Sanderson Hotel per un drink.
L'arredamento e lo stile sono inconfondibilmente del geniale  Philippe Starck.
Il servizio è ottimo,l'atmosfera,la clientela etc etc.
Merita una visita per una piacevole serata con amici (lo consiglio anche di giorno).
L'unica ""mancanza"" è  il numero limitato di sgabelli al Bar!",5,2012,02,05
132,"bello, ma servizio approssimativo","l Hotel è veramente particolare, molto cool; posizione buona; esternamente inguardabile; servizio door pessimo, idem la concierge; molta approssimazione anche da parte del desk, a parte Isabella, molto gentile. in breve avevano perso una valigia (su due), avevanio sbagliato a prenotare il cab da LH, si sono dimenticati di avvertirci quando è arrivata l auto per il tetro, non risucivano a trovare dell alcool disinfettante.
arredamento mooolto fashion, bello.",3,2011,12,08
132,Molto cool. Da vedere in onore del grande P.Stark,"Parti comuni molto belle e particolari. Bella musica, pieno di giovani, ottimi servizi anche al bar e al ristorante. Colazione speciale, varia e ricca. Le camere molto pulite sono silenziose verso l'esterno pur essendo nel cuore di Soho, ma rumorose nei confronti di quelle vicine.  Sarebbero da rimodernare, ma perderebbero di autenticita'. Ci tornerei volentieri....",4,2011,11,14
132,Gute Leistung-Schöne Zimmer / allerdings auch knackige Preise,"Wir waren im August mit 2 Erwachsenen und einem Kind (8Jahre) für einen Citytrip in London und haben im Sanderson Hotel geschlafen. Die meisten Zimmer haben Betten im Format 160x200 weshalb wir beim Check-in gleich mehrere Zimmer gezeigt bekamen um mit 2 Erwachsenen und 1 Kind gut untergebracht zu sein. Das Hotel ist sehr stylish. Das Personal von Rezeption bis Bar nicht übermässig aufmerksam jedoch unheimlich freundlich! Das Zimmer war groß und sehr gut ausgestattet. Es hat an nichts gefehlt. Es sei zu erwähnen dass die Badezimmer sehr offen gestaltet sind und einzig durch Milchglas und Vorhänge Intimsphäre geschafft wird.  Abends ist die Location am Wochenende eine beliebte Szene Bar auch für Londoner weshalb es je nach Zimmer auch mal lauter werden kann (Musik). Das Frühstück besteht aus Croissants, Toast, Früchten und Joghurt sowie süssen Kleinteilen (keine Brötchen !)
Alles in allem waren wir sehr zufrieden jedoch ist der wirklich knackige Preis nicht unbedingt gerechtfertigt!",4,2011,08,22
132,Si può dare di più,"Si arriva al Sanderson convinti di entrare in uno degli hotel più inn di London city ed in effetti da subito, appena varcato, si ha una strana sensazione...difficile da spiegare. L'ambiente è elettrizzante, giovanile, dinamico ed anche leggermente informale. Le camere necessitano però di essere al passo con i tempi...non è possibile che in tal magnificenza vi sia ancora necessità di richiedere un dvd per un film...con tanto di lista fornita dalla reception....ma dai! Anche il bagno con le dotazioni andrebbe spolverato un pochino. Letto comodissimo, gioco di luci affascinante. Pareti di vetro della stanza spettacolari...forse sin troppo a discapito di mancanza di aria fresca da respirare da una finestra (totalmente assenti nella nostra camera). Camere non insonorizzate benissimo. Personale un po esuberante...ci siamo trovati all'improvviso (e per due volte) una graziosa signorina (molto graziosa) che dopo aver bussato ha atteso 5 secondi per aprire da se la porta e piombare in camera chiedendo: room service....avete bisogno di qualcosa? Pochissimo italiano...e questo per me è stato un problemino.....Informazioni e servizi non proprio al top (sarà stato per il mio inglese...maccheronico...ma non ho avuto risposte esaurienti). L'ascensore impregnato sempre degli odori della cucina....La colazione magnifica. Non abbiamo mangiato ma la location era davvero molto affascinante, così come la trasformazione notturna dell'hotel in luogo di incontro e musica. Carino e simpaticissimo il sexy kit in camera (da acquistare a 10 euro). Insomma...con un po più di attenzione, professionalità ed una rispolveratina alle camere sarebbe perfetto. Tre notti ci sono costate circa 1300 euro (che beninteso ripagherei).",3,2011,08,08
132,buon hotel,"Storico hotel di design a Londra (fatto da P. Stark) posizione perfetta, parti comuni (lobby, bar, ristorante, giardino ..) ancora belle, le camere invece risentono il peso degli anni. Seppur centrale è hotel molto silezioso con ottimi letti ; la camera invece - come del resto molti hotel di design degli anni 90 - è poco pratica soprattutto per il bagno e gli armadi che non ci sono....",3,2011,06,10
132,Fashion,"Un po' freddo per l'arredamento così moderno, molto di design,il servizio e' ottimo,sono stati molto gentili,le stanze sono molto grandi per essere a Londra e molto pulite!",4,2011,01,11
132,"Nettes Hotel, nicht unbedingt jedermanns Sache","Beginnend beim check-in über den Restaurant- und Barbereich bis hin zu den Servicekräften sind die Mitarbeiter dieses hauses sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit, wenn auch nicht immer in jeder Situation unbedingt kompetent. Letzteres fiel mir immer wieder einmal im  Restaurant negativ auf. Die Atmosphäre in diesem Haus ist schon eine besondere, das Design der Zimmer nicht unbedingt jedermann Sache, auch wenn die schon in früheren Berichten genannten offenen Badezimmer weniger problematisch sind. Es gibt zumindest immer die Möglichkeit, den Raum entsprechend optisch zu teilen. Als störender empfand ich in diesem Zusammenhang den tag und Nacht aktiven Brunne im Innenhof, der durchaus ein gewisses Nervpotential besitzt, so dass ruhesuchenden Gäste von Räumen zum Innenhof eher abzuraten ist.  
Die Aussenarchitektur des Hotels ist nicht unbedingt schön zu nenen, die Lage des Hotels ist jedoch für London-Reisende durchaus empfehlenswert. In zwei Minuten ist man auf Oxfort Street und auch die Tube-Stationen Tootenham und Oxfort Circus sind in wenigen Minuten erreichbar.",4,2010,11,09
132,Design-Hotel mit zwielichter Bar,"Das Sanderson ist berüchtigt, auch Promis wie Paris Hilton feiern hier an der Bar! Und diese ist sicherlich das Auffälligste an dem von außen wenig modern wirkenden Hotel: Ab ca. 5 Uhr nachmittags finden sich hier leicht bekleidete Damen ein, die von S-Klasse Benz vorgefahren werden. Die Bar schließt gegen 2 Uhr nachts. Zimmer und Bar sind besonders modern designt. Im Zimmer finden sich nur Glas, Milchglas und Vorhänge. Hervorzuheben ist die Lage: Nur wenige Gehminuten zum Picadilly Circus, Bars und Restaurants sind also an jeder Ecke zu finden. Für Familien ist aber von dem Hotel abzuraten. Als Geschäftsreisende hatten wir einen ordentlichen Tagungsraum, aber die Klientel - vor allem in der Bar - hat nicht alle Kollegen angesprochen. Aufgrund der hohen Preise würde ich das Hotel nach der gesehenen Leistung (3 Tage) nicht nochmals buchen.",3,2010,10,07
132,Bisogna assolutamente andarci,"Anche se solo per prendere un drink questo albergo è assolutamente da vedere. Arredamenti strepitosamente fuori dal comune camere strane ma belle. ottimo il ristorante e bellissimo il giardino interno. Strategica la posizione in pieno Soho. Caro anche per Londra ma ne vale la pena. Unica nota stonata l'addebbito in carta di credito per gli extra di oltre 1600 pound che mi sono state puntualmente restituite alla partenza, ma che mi hanno scaricato la carta per tutto il soggiorno; meno male che ne avevo un'altra.",4,2010,08,16
132,DA NON PERDERE!,"Non si può andare a Londra e non soggiornare al Sanderson: è un posto incantevole, dal design unico. Già in reception si ha idea del suo stile cool e ricercato, e una volta in camera non si è affatto smentiti: atmosfera sensuale, ricercatezza assoluta.

Ottimi anche i servizi.",5,2010,08,01
132,HAMMER Hotel - nur vom FEINSTEN!,"Phänomenales Hotel - ein ERLEBNIS! Luxus pur - vor allem die Aufzüge haben es in sich - man fühlt sich schwebend im All von Etage zu Etage gleitend. Herrlich! Grosse, helle, komfortable Zimmer mit fantastischen Betten. Mehrere Lagen absoluter Schlaf- und Liegekomfort! Durch Glaswände abgetrenntes Bad das sich durch feder-leichte Vorhänge mit etwas Privatsphäre ausstatten lässt. Grosse Dusche (in manchen Zimmern zusätzlich Badewanne) und separate Toilette. Luxuriöse Seifen, Duschgel, etc. alles vorhanden. Highlight sicherlich auch das Dampfbad mit Erholungs-Oase (definitiv entspannend!!), grosser Fitnessraum und Billiard-Zimmer. Die grosse Bar anschliessend an das Haus-eigene Spitzen-Restaurant ist Treff- und Sammelpunkt zum täglichen Apéritif. Wer es gemütlicher möchte geht in die ""Purple Bar"" die ausschliesslich für Hotel-Gäste oder Gäste des Hotels (VIPs) reserviert ist - der Name ist Programm. Erstklassiges Personal - stehen 24/7 mit Rat und Tat zur Hilfe. Chauffeur-Service der sogar günstiger ist als ""Black-Cab""-Fahrten. Definitv eine Reise wert!!!!

132,"Gute Lage, schönes Design - mäßiges Service","Das Sanderson Hotel liegt gleich in der Nähe der Oxford Street und ist daher in ausgezeichneter Lage zum Shoppen bzw. sind auch sehr viele Bars und Restaurants in der Nähe. Die Einrichtung des Hotels ist sehr schön gestaltet sowie auch die Zimmer. Wobei die Zimmer sehr offen gestaltet sind,d .h. Glaswände zum Badzimmer und WC die mit einem Vorghang abgetrennt werden können. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist für ein 5-Sterne Haus nicht sehr ausgiebig. Es ist zwar alles vorhanden... aber das Luxus Gefühl fehlt ein wenig. Das Serivce war OK, aber nicht das was man sich für ein 5 Sterne Hotel erwarten würde.",4,2010,07,05
132,Tolles Design Hotel für Städte-Trip,"Das ""Sanderson"" ist ein sehr zu empfehlendes Designhotel in Londons Westend für eine Kurztrip nach London. Sehr zentral zum Shoppen und Ausgehen. Die Design-Zimmer sind geräumig, hell & freundlich und haben einen sehr transparenten & progressiven Charakter. Wir haben uns in unserem Zimmer sehr wohlgefühlt. Die Terrasse (Innenhofe) ist ein Kleinod zum Chillen nach intensiven Nachmittagen durch Londons Strassen. Sehr zu empfehlen für den Abend ist die ""Long Bar"" und das Restaurant mit einer wirklich hervorragenden Küche. Den Spabereich habe ich nicht getestet. Das ""Sanderson"" ist ein TOP-Hotel für einen London-Besuch.",5,2010,06,03
132,auf die zimmerwahl achten,"das design der lobby ist etwas aussergewoehnlich - ein wenig ""alice im wunderland"", d.h. ungewoehnliche groessenverhaeltnisse und formen der rezeption und moebel in der lobby. ein erlebnis ist der fahrstuhl...
ich hatte leider ein zimmer 1. oder 2. stock, direkt ueber anlieferungs-/abholungszone des hotels - um ca. 5.00 uhr begann ein auch mit groesster muedigkeit nicht zu ignoriender laerm: LKW's, lautes rufen, hupen, sehr laute ein- und ausladegeraeusche. 
ich persoenlich finde, in hotels dieser preiskategorie duerfte es solche zimmer nicht geben. auch der service nicht ok: auf meinen hinweis beim auschecken wurde mit einem schulterzucken und i'm sorry reagiert. 
ich finde, der internetzugang im sollte jahr 2010 kostenlos sein (oder nur geringfuegig kosten), besonders in hotels dieser kategorie. im sanderson ist er mir besonders teuer in erinnerung. fruehstueck habe ich nicht ausprobiert, da ich zum fruehstuecksbeginn zum flughafen musste, es lies sich auch nichts vorher arrangieren.
die simmer sind sehr clean und cool eingerichtet, ich hatte das bad im zimmer nur durch einen vorhang abgetrennt - fand ich ganz nett.",2,2010,06,02
132,einfach super,Die Hotelzimmer waren sauber und das Personal super nett. Das Hotel ist ideal für shopping touren und das Restaurant und die Bar ein MUST.
