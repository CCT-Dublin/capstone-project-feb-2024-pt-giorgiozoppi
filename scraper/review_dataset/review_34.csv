34,Just what the doctor ordered....,"The Wittmore in Barcelona was the last stop on our 10 day trip.  Unfortunately, half way through the vacation, my wife and I came down with a nasty cold.  We arrived at the hotel after a less than pleasant flight from Bordeaux, and were worn down.  When the driver pulled up to the alley that lead to the hotel, we were warmly welcomed by a member of the reception team, who helped drag our bags over the cobblestone pavement and into what seemed to be a secret hideaway of an exclusive residence.  We were offered a glass of wine while they checked us in, which we gladly accepted, and immediately relaxed.  The staff showed us the ultra-cool bar/lounge/restaurant, with a central courtyard seating option, and we could already feel ourselves recovering from our malaise.  Once we entered the spacious and smartly decorated suite on the fifth floor, I knew that we were going to be ok!  From the floor to ceiling windows that opened out into the courtyard, to the Marshall Amp bluetooth speaker, the large, king-sized bed, and complimentary mini-bar (complete with gin, tonic and limes), all was right in the world.  Throughout our three night stay, we never wanted for anything, as the staff was extremely attentive to anything we needed.  The food and the hotel vibe was so good, that I am almost embarrassed to say that we ate there every night - once in the restaurant and twice in our room.  As part of the suite package, the Wittmore offers an exclusive rooftop experience night with drinks and charcuterie plate.  When it was our night, the wind was a bit too much to handle, but that was no problem - the staff just served us in our room.  We did get to experience the rooftop as well - bringing our gin and tonics and taking in views of the surrounding city.  The Wittmore provided one of the best hotel experiences we've ever had, and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates a luxury boutique hotel with warmth, beauty, great food, and sexy vibe.  If we ever get back to Barcelona, there is no doubt where we will stay!",5,2024,10,13
34,Charming Oasis,"I have to admit I was a little nervous walking down the alley to the hotel.  Once inside the door all worries fell away when greeted by the charm of everything beyond the doors.  From the staff to the design of the place.  What an oasis!  Very comfortable and very quiet.  The staff, though, was the best.  They answered all of our needs.  Shout out to Ivana and Nicole.",5,2024,09,28
34,Lovely Stay in the Gothic Quarter,"We had a lovely stay at this beautiful and comfortable hotel.
The staff were so friendly and welcoming.
The welcome drinks upon check in and the slice of cake for my birthday were a pleasant surprise.
The breakfast was delicious and generous. The staff were happy and friendly in the morning. 
We loved having a restocked bar fridge. Upon our return from touring the sights we could unwind with a beer or gin tonic including fresh lime and lemon. 
The terresse was a nice place to unwind and dip in the pool.
We throughly enjoyed our stay and with no hesitation would recommend.",5,2024,09,03
34,"5-Star Boutique hotel for couples with amazing rooms, service, and rooftop pool!","This is probably the best hotel in Barcelona for couples looking for a boutique retreat in the heart of the Gothic Quarter with an amazing restaurant and rooftop pool!  The staff was so attentive and accommodating to all of our needs.  AND the room was absolutely spacious, stylish, and comfortable.  5-Star boutique location at its finest.",5,2024,08,16
34,Publicists should receive 5-stars for the hype.,"Medium room is small. No views. Service felt transactional. Roof photos are deceptive. No gym/amenities. Location is inconvenient, apart from a walk in the Gothic. I wanted to love this hotel but they have much to learn about boutique service. Unfortunately, supply and demand in BCN will allow mediocre to pass for luxury.",3,2024,08,06
34,Will be back,"My husband and I just stayed here for 6 nights. This hotel is the perfect escape from the labyrinth that is the gothic quarter. The vibe is adults only and super sexy. The 22 rooms allow the staff to give personal touches. I loved the snack delivery daily including fresh bread and fruit. Popcorn came with turn down service as well. The staff was attentive and warm. Fernando, Renee and Danny the bartender took great care of us. Contraband is tops. The Chateaubriand melted with incredible flavor. We arranged car service thru hotel for airport pick up and drop off. Professional friendly and made sure we got to where we needed to be.  Thank you Wittmore",5,2024,08,05
34,Not worth the price.,"We are Globalist Hyatt members and stayed here because of all the positive reviews and the brand recently joining Hyatt.   It’s nice, beds are comfortable, but other than that, not sure what all the excitement is for.   We had a Medium room, were not upgraded.   The medium room is small and you struggle to open 2 suitcases in it.   The hotel has no views - all rooms look into a courtyard so rooms are dark. The bar has a cool vibe, nice to stop by for a drink.  We did, interesting though, we ordered a dirty martini and they didn’t have olives. Overall for over $500 a night, I think there are way better options in Barcelona for less!  …oh and breakfast wasn’t include either for that price, even as a Globalist members.  Extremely slow service at breakfast and not attentive.   Overall, disappointing stay.",3,2024,08,04
34,Amazing Stay,"Our experience at the Wittmore Hotel was amazing. Along with the beautiful, spotless hotel and location, the staff was wonderful and definitely enhanced our stay. We keep raving about our stay. We will definitely go back to the Wittmore Hotel.",5,2024,07,07
34,Hidden gem in Barcelona's Gotic section,"The Whittmore, a boutique hotel, is a hidden gem in the Gotic district of Barcelona. We loved the rooftop lounge with plunge pool overlooking this magnificent, historic city where you can enjoy food and cocktails as you listen to church bells clanging while you take siesta. Our concierge, Xavier, like all the staff, was friendly, welcoming and gave us suggestions for where to dine like a local. The rooms are small, but you can soak up the ambience simply by opening your windows to the flowery courtyard.",5,2024,07,04
34,The Reviews are Right...The Wittmore is Amazing!,"Stayed for several day, pre-cruise, in November 2023. Lucked out with unseasonably warm weather. 

Hotel is the best little hotel in Spain. Couples only, Best breakfast of any hotel we have stayed at. Staff are friendly and amazing. The attached restaurant, Contraban, so delicious. 

Rooms are great. Hall in room is a little dark, but that is the only negative. Bed comfortable, great water pressure. Very quiet. 

Honestly, cannot say enough positive things about this hotel. Stay here, I know you will love it. ",5,2024,06,20
34,Outstanding Dinner,"The Contraban Restaurant, nestled within the elegant and cozy boutique hotel Wittmore, is a true hidden gem in Barcelona. Our dinner experience there exceeded all expectations. The restaurant's stylish decor and superb ambiance set the perfect tone for the evening. The live DJane's music was the perfect accompaniment to the evening.
The staff were exceptionally courteous and friendly, ensuring we felt comfortable and well-taken care of throughout the night. However, the highlight of our visit was undoubtedly the fantastic food. The chateaubriand, grilled squid, and macaroni with secreto ibérico were particularly memorable.
In summary, the Contraban Restaurant not only offers outstanding cuisine but also provides a wonderfully pleasant atmosphere for a special dining experience.",5,2024,05,30
34,Absolutely stunning atmosphere and an amazing staff! Can’t recommend enough,"We had our wedding dinner at Wittmore Hotel with food and drinks from Contraban restaurant in April 24.

The whole experience was perfect in every way! The hotel itself is astonishingly beautiful and perfectly located in the city, the food and drinks were amazing, and the staff were so warm and lovely the entire event. 

The planning of the wedding was made so simple by the help from Veronica Mansson who really went above and beyond. We talked back and forth a while deciding what  we wanted, and they took care of absolutely everything. We didn’t have a problem or worry at any point, so we could just sit back and really enjoy our wedding. Something we will be forever grateful for.

So a big thank you to Wittmore hotel, the kitchen and the staff for making it such a memorable event! We are sure to come back",5,2024,05,29
34,Perfect location and people - we will be back  !!,So glad we chose to stay at the Wittmore - felt like staying with friends - every single staff member ( bar one - but that bad experience was swiftly and professionally dealt with ) could not do enough to make sure that we had an enjoyable stay - was so nice to see a team who clearly enjoyed working together and also had pride in the Wittmore - well done management and especially Veronica - a star employee who you should keep hold of at all cost !!,5,2024,05,20
34,The Perfect BCN Stay,"Wittmore defines ""5 Star"" service. Close to everything, yet tucked away from everyone. The Staff of Wittmore made my wife's birthday, and our whole stay, unforgettable! Wittmore exceeded our every expectation. Stop searching for the right place to surprise the one you love; Wittmore is it!",5,2024,05,19
34,We won’t stay anywhere else! Fabulous boutique hotel - thank you.,"We picked this small, boutique hotel due to a combination of its size, reviews and location near/in the Gothic Quarter. We have generally recently steered away from chains and large hotels that could be ‘anywhere’ rather than full of character and warmth.

The Wittmore did exactly what we were hoping for and way more! The incredibly calm vibe that this place exudes is only excelled by the excellent and warm staff. 

Nothing is perfect and we were unfortunately victims of some light fingered ‘locals’ when out and about… why mention it in this review? Well, the staff were brilliant and empathetic. One even offered to walk us to the nearest police station if we were shaken up and wanted to be accompanied. A great touch that truly stood out and sets this place apart.

There was one minor issue so we decided to mention it and from the Manager down,  including Veronica, the front of house manager, through every member of staff, everyone wanted to make up for it. Somebody (Veronica, we guess,) runs an excellent team here.

The service can make or break an establishment, regardless of how nice the furnishings and decor are. They made a beautiful, small, boutique and calm oasis even better.

We had a ‘middle room’ and it was lovely. We saw a review that said the place is too dark but in our view, it adds to the serenity and general ambience. Check out the rooftop terrace and small pool - what an amazing retreat after a day sightseeing in the middle of town.

If this hotel is among your wish list and/or options for a stay in Barcelona, PLEASE try it. They all deserve a chance to help make your trip that little bit extra special.

A beautiful small, boutique hotel with excellent staff and service. Thank you again Veronica and the whole team.",5,2024,05,19
34,Best Stay ever,"Every single staff person was delightful, helpful and professional beyond expectation. They were not only welcoming, but friendly and happy to us. Amazing food and service at the Contraban restaurant. The rooftop was a delightful way to end each day with a great cocktail.  I would stay here again and again...",5,2024,05,04
34,Wonderful small hotel in a great location!,"Such a wonderful hotel! The hotel small, and intimate. Our room overlooked a small courtyard a few floors below us. The room was spotless, with a great bathroom with very high end amenities. We were greeted at the front desk with drinks when we arrived. The small restaurant is perfect for early breakfast or or late snack.. The location is off a small side street, in a wonderful, walkable part of town. I would highly recommend staying here.",5,2024,04,10
34,Great experience in contraban @ Wittmore,"Me and my daughter had a lovely dinner at Wittmore’s restaurant: Contraban, we were delighted with all the amazing dishes and the great service. Definitely one of our favorites in Barcelona and highly recommend. All the food was plated wonderfully and tasted great, additionally  the staff was very attentive.",5,2024,04,08
34,JUST PERFECT,"First ,we would like to thank all the team in the hotel that made us happy during our short stay but very pleasent one..The team makes you feel you are at home.In all respects the hotel is one of the best that we have ever stayed , if it is not the very best one can be the second best..It is located in old town , close to almost all places to visit in Barcelona..You can reach everywhere by walking, close to many nice restaurants , and the hotel has a good restaurant too..Breakfast is perfect ..Rooms are decorated very well & functional.We will definetely choose this hotel for our future trips to Barcelona.",5,2024,03,27
34,What Barcelona Looks Like,"The Wittmore Hotel was a wonderful experience that really brought attention to what the Gothic Quarter in the city of Barcelona has to offer. Although we stayed for a few days, we were impressed by the bar and dinner service provided and had a chance to have a nice relaxed afternoon in the rooftop and sulk in the view of Barcelona. 

Definitely will have to recommend this place to many friends and family, and come back as soon as possible.

Thank you!",5,2024,03,18
34,Amazing!,"The hotel was beautiful, the location was very easy to walk to/from and the service was outstanding. Breakfast was delicious! We would stay here again without a second thought- it was a great experience. Extra points for an amazing rain shower for my very tall husband with the best water pressure!",5,2024,03,06
34,Family Dinner,"In general the whole service was very good. The facilities are beautiful, reception was kind, food was amazing. Need to try the Cigala, its just an unique dish. 
The ONLY thing is that it was slightly too hot, eventhough we were in winter. So I'd say to turn down the heating of the room a bit.",5,2024,03,05
34,Hidden Gem in Barcelona!,"If you are looking for a boutique hotel with fine furnishings and thoughtful staff, this is your hotel hide away. It is tucked behind an alley that leads to other shops and restaurants. The hotel is just a few walkable  blocks from the seaside as well.  There is a rooftop wading pool too that allows you to relax and unwind. The only down side we found was the rooms were not well lit.  Perhaps a more powerful lamp(s) could be purchased for the rooms.
Excellent hotel service and accommodations!",4,2024,01,02
34,Sexy & Swanky,"Sexy and swanky!  This adults-only boutique hotel is tucked away in an ally of the gothic quarter.  I recommend mapping the location before arriving.  While there isn't so much to do around the area, it is not too long a walk to the Placa de Catalunya area.  We had rooms 206 & 306, which were the hotel's Large Room.  The rooms were slightly above average size, and featured multiple French doors that opened to the courtyard.  The bathroom was average size.  The hotel bar is lovely.  We received terrific service every time we came back to the hotel.   Reserving cabs ahead of time was recommended, as it typically takes 15 minutes to get a taxi.  Turn-down service featured a snack each night.  ",5,2023,12,10
34,Fantastic,"Wow! I simply cannot recommend this hotel enough. Why? Service was impeccable - they were so friendly and helpful, and nothing was too much trouble. Facilities - room was great (very comfortable, well appointed, quiet .... could not fault a thing). Food was awesome. Breakfast was a real treat - simply delicious. And we also ate there one evening (the tasting menu) and it was just great. What a lovely stay - thank you so much Wittmore hotel!
So grateful to have found this place - we will be back!!",5,2023,12,10
34,This little hidden gem in the heart of Barcelona- we can highly recommend. Beautiful designs- great food best staff ♥️,"We loved this little hidden gem in the heart of Barcelona- most beautiful design- amazing food and the best staff ever.
Not to mention the cosy gorgeous decorated rooms - with free minibar!!!
- the best drinks and backgammon in front of the fireplace after a long stroll in the streets of Barcelona, is just a perfect way to end your day.",5,2023,12,09
34,Perfect Hotel for couples trip to Barcelona,"This hotel is beautifully thought out and was a wonderful place to explore Barcelona from. The room had everything we needed, it was spacious and the bathroom was also big enough to feel luxurious. There were lots of little touches that made it feel really special, each day they provide 2 beers, some gin and tonic, a lime, crisps, some little snacks like olives or a piece of cake. The staff are particularly lovely and friendly, breakfast was perfect.",5,2023,11,26
34,Trendy boutique but not worth the money,"The room war very stylish but had its quirks. The dark walls and low light bulbs make it dark which is a shame if you're looking to enjoy the Mediterranean sun. While the quality of food at the restaurant is good, service is quite slow and I wouldn't recommend adding breakfast. It's much cheaper and faster to pickup from one of the many bakeries nearby. Being a small hotel, my last night there was a private event that turned the main courtyard into a dance party past midnight. All rooms look into the courtyard so it's not ideal. Definitely check if there is an event going on during your stay if you're a light sleeper.",4,2023,11,26
34,"great location, great service, nothing too much trouble. LOVED","We stayed here in August at the height of summer. The staff from arrival to departure were helpful, honest and so accommodating. They recommended and booked tours for us, helped organise and store bicycles for us to use. 
it is in a great location. We received welcome treats, it was. my birthday so a birthday treat.
Daily breakfast was exceptional and was a highlight of our day.
Our fabulous stay was topped off by the beautiful Ivanna discovering that our next stop was Menorca. She was from here so typed up a 2 page itinerary on where to eat, what to do, secret coves and placed to visit. This exceeded our expectations and ensured the next part of our trip was taken care of. From the front office manager to the door man, restaurant staff and front desk we received 5 star service.
Put this hotel on your list if visiting Barcelona. Bravo to Wittmore. ",5,2023,11,04
34,Perfect from start to finish ,"I would thoroughly recommend the Wittmore. Was a terrific stay from start to finish, has a cool clubby vibe and the service was exemplary, breakfast and dinner superb and all this in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. Rooms are elegantly decorated and the free mini bar provided pre dinner G&T’s so nothing not to like ! Thanks to the superb team for making us feel so welcome and for a wonderful four days.",5,2023,11,02
34,Gorgeous hotel design and experience ,"Stunning time in Barcelona staying at the Wittmore Hotel. I can't recommend this hotel enough. The staff were so attentive and friendly. Mark and Ivana at the front reception made us feel so welcome and were very helpful with restaurant bookings and recommending places to visit. Fernando in the restaurant was exceptional, his level of customer service was brilliant and he could not do enough to ensure our experience was flawless. Well done Wittmore Hotel not only are you a gorgeous place to stay you provided a fantastic experience for me and my husband, and we will be back.",5,2023,11,01
34,Hotel after my heart,A trip to Barcelona will never be complete without a stay at Wittmore Hotel. I’m impressed beyond words and am already planning my return visit. Hotel and rooms are gorgeous and the staff couldn’t be more accommodating. I loved small touches like free water and snacks / mini bar. There is everything in the room for the most comfortable stay. It was a joy to lounge in bed and look out to the beautiful living wall and courtyard. Definitely don’t skip out on dinner at Contraban downstairs and breakfast in bed. Magical experience.,5,2023,10,24
34,Heavenly 3 day mini break.,"Totally fabulous stay in this wonderful hotel. From the minute that we arrived the staff could not have done more for us. We arrived early before the check in time and our room wasn’t ready which wasn’t a problem to us however we were invited into the bar area and given complimentary drinks, by the time we had finished them our room was ready. We were shown to our room by Julian who explained every detail of the hotels facilities and gave us some very good advice on places to visit which we took up. Andrea in reception was also a delight and booked restaurants for us. The staff in the hotel restaurant were also really friendly and efficient serving the wonderful breakfasts. If you are thinking of visiting Barcelona you should definitely stay in this hotel, even the drinks in the mini bar were included in the price of the room which we have never had before.

Thanks to all the staff.",5,2023,10,01
34,If you enjoy the Gothic Quarter you will like it,"The rooms were small and the location difficult to get to if you're taking a taxi.  There was no concierge. The rooms use an old fashioned key which was a bit inconvenient.   Other than that, we had a good stay and would recommend it to anyone who can afford it and enjoys the crowds and charm of the Gothic Quarter",4,2023,09,23
34,Luxurious but chill style with amazing food and drink. 10/10,"I came for a weekend, and the Wittmore was a dream. The whole vibe of the hotel is dark and romantic. If I could I’d give them a 10/10. 
The food at their restaurant is as well unique and delicious. Although, on top of everything else, they have a kind and well organized staff. Can’t wait to come back to this hotel.",5,2023,09,14
34,10 out of 10!,"Incredible stay. The staff treated us like family and made our visit to Barcelona a dream. Breakfast was delicious, only to be topped by one of the best dinners we have ever had on our travels. We opted for the XL room and would highly recommend. Location was perfect to explore all the different parts of the city. Would stay here again if we return!",5,2023,09,12
34,They have room for improvement,"The rooms are small and we struggled with the layout a bit.  There are too many furnishings for such a small space.  The bar area seemed overwhelming.  They provide fresh limes/lemons for gin & tonic, etc.  The problem is we do not drink gin & tonics!  So, perhaps they can offer questionnaires to arriving guests so they can customize the rooms accordingly.  The hotel is very well built, looks modern and feels luxurious.  The lighting was way too low.  The round vanity makeup/shaving mirror was not lighted. However the low lighting + balcony perhaps gave the room a romantic feeling.   It's a shame that there was no fitness area in the hotel even though I think they have the space for it.  Front desk recommendations were a hit & miss.  The second night the attendant booked us dinner at a restaurant ""Cadaqués"" that ended up being a tourist trap.  Also, someone at the front desk said there  were ""no Ubers in Barcelona"".  But we found Ubers.  Breakfasts were outstanding and the service was great in general but room service was not that great.  One day we left a breakfast tray outside our room at 11am and when we came back at 7pm, the tray w/leftover food was still there!  Also there was only 1 toilet paper roll in the room and NO extras.  We had to go to the lobby to get toilet paper which was a little embarrassing  ",4,2023,09,04
34,Great experience.,"The location is in the middle of the gothic neighborhood, nonetheless it was very quiet & the whole team was very nice. The breakfast was excellent. Do not miss out a drink by the pool in the evening.",5,2023,09,01
34,Excellent Hotel,"This is a super hotel. It is in a fantastic location but very quiet, the staff could not be more helpful and the room I was in had a large double bed. In addition, the breakfast is ideal. I could not fault this place and would definitely stay again.",5,2023,08,18
34,A True Luxury Boutique Hotel in the Gothic Quarter- Fabulous oasis in busy Barcelona!,"My family’s 3 night stay at the Wittmore in Barcelona in late July 2023 was fabulous.  It’s a true luxury boutique hotel in a great secluded portion of the Gothic Quarter. It’s very centrally location.  I think they have 24 rooms and the decor of the hotel is fabulous.  The actual hotel looks like the pictures you see online (which is not always the case).  The best part about the Wittmore is the staff; all so helpful and professional and we had a Lot of requests! Nicole front of house Manager keeps everything running smoothly, Mark and Guillem doorman, bellmen were most helpful. Marina in the restaurant, bar always we ready to go above and beyond to assist.  Veronica and Julian at reception were so nice and helpful with reservations etc. The A/C works great in the hotel.  The rooms are clean, clean clean.  The breakfast at the restaurant Contraban was Awsome.  The bar was the best.  The rooftop pool was very cool.  I am so glad we selected the Wittmore over a large impersonal hotel on major thoroughfare.",5,2023,08,07
34,Beautiful hotel with the best staff,This hotel is special. The hotel itself is gorgeous and unique. Moody speakeasy vibes. The staff is what makes the hotel everything. They treated us as friends and made us so comfortable and welcome. The complimentary mini bar was such a nice touch and the evening snacks were such a nice touch. We will always stay here.,5,2023,07,27
34,"Comfortable, quiet oasis","Above and beyond service, especially William. After a hot slog through the alleys in 30 degree heat there is nothing better than drinking cold rose with your feet in the rooftop pool, looking over the Gothic Quarter. The beds are comfortable, the pillows from another world and the inches thick solid doors ensure privacy. We had the lamb in the restaurant and it slid off the bone! It often feels in Spanish hotels that the staff are acutely aware of and aspire no higher than the stars on the front door; the Wittmore in every way acts as if a sixth star was possible.",5,2023,07,10
34,"Not the best room layout but a great experience, overall, in the best part of Barcelona.","We stayed here for 3 nights and it grew on us. Initially, we were like, ""What have we done booking here?"" The room was small (mostly a long hallway of unusable space) and cramped ... although the bathroom was perfect ... almost as big as the bedroom and had the best shower we experienced on a 12 day long trip through Spain and France. Seriously, we must have showered 3 times a day because it was very hot and felt better than going in their tiny puddle ... er, pool. While the actual room was not our favourite during the trip, the hotel stay itself was among our favorourite.

Overall, what won us over was the level of service. The staff were friendly and excellent ... especially the Italian overnight desk agent. Our room was cleaned spotless each day, there was a welcome bottle of Cava on ice waiting for us when we arrived and the mini-bar was all free. Seems like a little thing but each day it saved us money on drinks because they restocked 2 bottles of local beer, a small caraf of gin and tonics and cold water and juice. The best potato chips we ever tried and a small container of nuts. For a $500/night hotel, it seems like a non-factor but this was one of our favourite parts of the stay.

We had come to Barcelona hoping for a bright, sunny, airy feel ... know that this hotel is pretty 'dark and moody'. When you enter, the lobby is beautiful but lots of maroon velvet and black accents. The rooms are similar. Maroon carpet and walls, not much lighting and they are cozy but feel a little 'gothic'. Each room has tall windows which open out onto a 'shaft' in the center of the building with ivy on it. You miss out on the sunlight and at night, even with all the lights on, the room is a bit depressing.

The room is very tight (aside for the long hallway which included a closet for clothing (very narrow, so our suitcases wouldn't fit and we had to lay them on the floor of the hallway) and the mini-bar. There really wasn't too much space to walk around the bed and they had a small bench and a table and chair, which were so small I can't imagine anyone actually using them. There was a Marshall bluetooth speaker and the bed was pretty comfortable, if not a bit on the firm side, with enough pillows. The A/C kept the room cold enough vs. the 90 degree and humid weather outside.

Oddly enough, my favourite part of any hotel room is the bathroom. This was the true standout. The shower was a huge 'bay' with a shower curtain, which didn't look too luxurious but the rainfall shower absolutely felt like a waterfall with wonderful pressure and you could have the two heads on at the same time. The sink area was smaller than we hoped but nicely done in marble and silver accents. No bidet, which surprised us for Europe, but the bathroom was separate enough to offer privacy from the sleeping room. The toiletries were disappointing as the containers were on the wall vs. individual. (I am an actual soap guy ... and hate using communal body wash.)

I will say that the hotel had a nice, classy vibe. It felt much more like a hotel in Paris (with a British name) than anything we'd dreamed of in Barcelona. The roof deck was great ... it had panoramic views of the city and had enough space to stretch out. It rained for part of our trip, so the cushions on all the furniture were a bit wet, even when the sun came out. There was a shallow (2-3 foot) pool, which we jokingly called 'the puddle' and a section you could sit and have a smoke, or loungers you could lay on.

We had one meal in the downstairs restaurant and a few drinks. Both were okay/average. The location is great ... in the Gothic quarter. It is VERY hard to find the hotel without a map the first time or two. After a day, it's easier to find once you are familiar with the landmarks. The Gothic Quarter is beautiful and feels a bit like a cleaner version of Naples, Italy. It's a 15 minute walk to the 'heart' of Barcelona. It seems like there are a lot of newer restaurants/bars near the hotel, although very nice ones. Bar La Playa is right around the corner ... this is a 'must do' Tapas place. If we had to do it over again, this is exactly where we would want to stay again. Historic but close to shopping, etc.

The worst part about this hotel is parking and getting around with a car. The streets are too narrow to drive down for most people ... the hotel directed us to a parking garage, which was impossible to find so we parked in a small garage just a few streets over for the same price (35 Euros/24 hours) If you are uncomfortable with narrow streets and crowds, you might want to park further outside the Gothic Quarter and walk in. Those with city-driving shyness won't love the location ... but it really is the best place to stay. We did find in Barcelona the rumors about people eating dinner at 11 p.m. are very exaggerated. It was hard finding a decent place open past 10 p.m. for dinner during the week.

Overall, this hotel made our trip better and we would return.",5,2023,06,29
34,Best hotel in the Gothic District!,"The Wittmore is located in the Gothic District, which is the oldest part of Barcelona. However, there is nothing old about this hotel! The hotel is updated, stylish, and modern. It is a small hotel with rooms surrounding a central courtyard. The courtyard has a beautiful living green wall. The breakfast each day at the restaurant is fantastic and fresh. The staff are friendly and professional. They remembered our names each day. Our room was comfortable and luxurious. The included minibar (with potato chips, ingredients for gin and tonics, and water) were a very nice addition. We particularly enjoyed the nightly turndown service. The rooftop is unreal! There are fantastic views of the city, along with a small pool to cool off in. I would absolutely stay at the Wittmore again in the future!",5,2023,06,29
34,Great hotel - a must stay!,"Great service, great location.

This is a great hotel!  The rooms are well designed, the staff very personable and no ask is too large for them.

We stayed in a suite and it was good value for money - very large, great design and huge shower.

The hotel organised all of our dinner reservations during our stay and every restaurant was fantastic!

Get them to plan tours, meals and anything else you need to enjoy your time in Barcelona!",5,2023,06,24
34,Great stay at the Wittmore,"Had a beautiful stay at the Wittmore. Lovely room with thoughtful touches. The front desk was tremendously helpful, friendly, and gave great recommendations. The location in the Gothic quarter is perfect— walking distance from many great restaurants and even the beach isn’t too far. Had an excellent experience. ",5,2023,06,05
34,Chic & edgy home away in one of the city's best neighborhoods,"The Wittmore is a must when visiting Barcelona! Tucked away on a quiet corner in the heart of the city's bustling and vibrant Gothic Quarter, it was the perfect home away from home for the four nights we stayed. Residential-style rooms facing the hotel's courtyard were outfitted with plush furnishings and a dark, edgier color palette (great robes too!). There was a cute little rooftop bar and the food was amazing. We loved the breakfast selection (a mix of healthier and indulgent options) and the room service bites. Daily turndown treats and a pre-stocked mini bar with beers, gin and freshly bottled water were also a nice touch. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. It was the perfect, relaxing stay with luxurious touches that never felt pretentious. 10/10 recommend and look forward to staying here again.",5,2023,05,24
34,Great Stay at Wittmore!,"Hotel Wittmore in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter is a hidden gem that exceeded all my expectations. The staff was incredibly friendly and made me feel right at home. The rooms are beautifully designed, and I enjoyed waking up to their wonderful breakfast each morning. The hotel's location allowed me to easily explore the historic streets and immerse myself in Barcelona's vibrant culture. I highly recommend Hotel Wittmore for a memorable stay. Shout out to Guillem who arranged a fabulous in room massage for me on such a short notice!",5,2023,05,22
34,A+ stay at the Wittmore. Everything was beyond our expectations!,"We stayed at the Wittmore for 4 nights in April 2023. We had a wonderful stay there and the staff was just absolutely amazing! My partner happened to dropped a very precious and sentimental piece of jewelry down the sink drain. I spoke with the staff and Gabriel at the front desk arranged for one of their maintenance colleagues Francisco to come and see if it could be retrieved. The next night when we got back from dinner, the gentleman at the front desk gave us an envelope that had the jewelry in it! My partner was beyond relieved and so happy!!!
The customer service at the Wittmore was simply outstanding. The room was quiet, clean and tidy and the hotel was so close to La Rambla and the Mediterranean.  We look forward to staying at the Wittmore again when we come back to Barcelona!! Thank you :)",5,2023,05,15
34,Charming small hotel in the gothic quarter,"We recently departed from a stay and would absolutely recommend it to others.  Very nice decor, great friendly staff, very attentive if you have any specific needs, and quiet comfortable rooms (with true king bed) Free minibar is a nice touch which had some beer, components for a cocktail, and fresh cold water.

Only downside is location - cabs/Ubers struggled to find it and kept trying to kick us out very far away.  Also, when leaving, the cab won’t come within a few blocks (streets are super narrow) so you have to carry your luggage yourself through the streets. If you are looking for like full service/doorman kind of place, this is not it. That said, it is still a great option for those willing to deal with it.",5,2023,05,11
34,5* decor with 3* customer service and a 2* review. ,"This hotel has 5* decor, the staff are friendly enough and it is very well located however the overall experience did not match the 5* tariffs during our stay.
I could forgive the underwhelming welcome,  the wrong food being brought to us and our drinks orders being forgotten but when we returned to our room at 6pm on the second day after a very enjoyable day in the city, we found that the room had not been cleaned (but someone had been in and left us some cake!). 
The reception staff seemed indifferent to this oversight so I asked to see the manager only to be told that they were not in the hotel so I asked for the manager to contact me when they were in the building. I did not get any  contact from the manager though it transpired that the General Manager had been sat in the bar near us while we waited for our room to be made up. 
Having been mildly irritated by this experience I began to take more notice than normal of other things such as the bathroom fittings not working properly, the coffee machine leaking and the rubbish piles near the front door - none of these things is particularly bad but it's definitely more what I'd expect in a 3* hotel not a 5*. 
I would still recommend this hotel to people partly because I could have just been unlucky on this occasion and partly because I think it's important to support high end boutique hotels as I know it's not easy for them competing against the big hotel chains but it definitely won't be my first choice next time I'm in Barcelona.

34,Great hotel in perfect location ,"Fabulous hotel in a great location. Lovely staff, superb breakfast and comfortable, quiet rooms. The little extras in the room like the free mini bar and the popcorn when returning back at night were greatly appreciated.  Highly recommended! ",5,2023,03,27
34,THE most amazing boutique hotel in hub of Barcelona,We had a wonderful stay at this classy hotel.  The staff was friendly and went out of their way to accommodate our needs.  The vibe was laid back and relaxed and we felt af home from the moment we walked in.  The bed was super comfy and probably the first hotel I’ve been to where the pillows didn’t hurt my neck :)! Bonus!!!.  Free mini bar too.  Attention to detail was exceptional.  We WILL be back !,5,2023,02,21
34,Amazing Stay,"We felt very comfortable at the Wittmor Hotel, because it is a super cozy, intimate, warm place with a central location that makes it easy for you to walk the streets of Barcelona.   Its living room with fireplace and large library make you feel at home with the added bonus of a very special attention from its staff from start to finish.",5,2023,02,12
34,Understated elegance in the heart of Barcelona,"Elegant but understated. Nothing over the top. Lovely boutique hotel in the Gothic area. Unbelievable service. The staff can not do enough for you. Restaurant suggestions and places to visit are great if you ask.
Spend a few minutes on the roof sitting in the sun. Very zen like garden setting.
Fabulous breakfasts. If it is not on the menu, just ask and they will make it. Be sure to get a cheese tray and try an omelette.
Special shout out to Lucia who was so helpful.",5,2023,02,05
34,Good!!!!!,"We spent a wonderful time in Barcelona also in Wittmore. Guillermo was so kind and good with the recomendations!! All the stuff was kind and helpful. The hotel is beautiful, the rooftop is so cute to chill, I will recommend it for sure.",5,2023,01,29
34,Absolutely fabulous Wittmore!,"This hotel was an outstanding experience from arrival to departure. Quiet rooms, extremely comfortable beds and very clean. The food was gourmet in Contraban Restaurant. 
For me the highlight was definitely the staff that made me feel like I was staying with friends. They are all so friendly and helpful!. Special thank you to Veronica in GR for going above and beyond! 
I will be back ! Hugs from Dubai!",5,2023,01,28
34,Amazing staff and rooms,"I was in Barcelona for 3 days, i decide to stay at Wittmore beacause it’s a Small hotel, quite and elegant. But i didn’t expect that amazing service. Specially Reception. Guillermo in the afternoon was so kind and helpful. Also the young lady at mornings!

Great location in the Gotic Quartier and nice rooms with big beds.

I recommend this hotel and also the restaurant.

Thanks Wittmore!",5,2023,01,11
34,The most SUPERB boutique hotel in Barcelona,The hotel is a gem and the staff aims to please its guest.  The food in the restaurant is excellent.  We stayed in the extra large room with the separate sitting area and it was a great place to rest and relax after a day in the city.  The staff delivered popcorn to our room each night and we enjoyed it while watching a movie.  I cannot say enough about this hotel and the wonderful service and personable staff.  Thank you!,5,2022,12,30
34,Wonderful Service,"The Wittmore hotel is beautiful and has a great location in Barcelona. One thing that really set my weekend there apart was the high level of service given by the staff who went the extra mile to help us. They helped find and reserve restaurants and attractions and made sure we had a taxi to the airport on time. They were very warm and always ready to lend a hand with what we needed to have a great stay. It really was exceptional service. I normally don’t write these reviews but felt they needed to be recognized - it’s a beautiful place, nice soaps and common areas, and really a stellar service team on the ground. Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2022,12,28
34,Definitely recommend…,"What a lovely hotel. Loved the location and the ambiance.  Room is a bit dark, but not in it much during the day anyway.  Felt cozy.  Bed and linens were very comfortable.  Nice roof deck. Great shower. Definitely enjoyed our stay.  We did have one hiccup with the breakfast that was supposed to be included, but management stepped up and corrected the situation. Very cool green wall…",5,2022,11,22

34,"Amazing, beautiful, lovely, delightful, experience, lavish, luxurious","The Wittmore Hotel captures everything and all aspects of what a boutique hotel should strive to be.

And with their friendly staff members, it makes the experience extra special and enjoyable.",5,2022,11,22
34,Perfect spot for a relaxed break,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Whitmore Hotel. There is a very relaxed and easy-going vibe from the moment you enter via a little side street and the whole place is extremely comforting.

We walked pretty much everywhere and the location on the edge of the Gothic Quarter was extremely convenient for most places and very peaceful in the evenings. But you could easily walk out and find 50 places to eat within 10 minutes walk if you wanted so you did not feel “out of town “.

The Room was very comfortable with a huge , comfortable bed and plenty of space for packing clothes away and a very modern bathroom with a very powerful shower. The air conditioning was basically silent. Our room overlooked the courtyard which was a nice little view. Although the rooms are not very big it was absolutely fine for our purposes.

We had a very good lunch in the pretty little courtyard restaurant and there are places to sit both outside and inside. Breakfast was also very good. 

The staff are young and attentive and all spoke perfect English we thought the overall level of service was extremely high, much better than you would find in a place of comparable cost in somewhere like London or Paris.

In the evenings the bar is lowly lit and plays nice music with a DJ on Thursdays to Saturdays. It had a very relaxed vibe and you cd still sit outside even in mid November. There is a wide range of cocktails and other drinks. Again the service was very good.

The front desk were able to help with reservations and concierge type advice. Taxis always arrived on time when ordered.

This is a terrific boutique hotel for people like us in our early 50s with no children in tow (it is an adults only hotel). It is no surprise that it carries the ‘small luxury hotels’ moniker.",5,2022,11,19
34,Delightful,"My husband and I are enjoying the Wittmore for three nights. It is quaint and charming. The staff is exceptionally helpful and recommending. The bar and restaurant are so inviting. The food is excellent.
We would definitely recommend the Wittmore. We will definitely return.",5,2022,11,11
34,Fabulous,So pleased their sister hotel was full. This one’s even better!! Perfect stay in every way. Wonderful location for shopping and walking everywhere. The staff cannot do enough in this stylish downtown hotel. Roof top bar is stunning and quiet away from the business of the city. Perfect balance,5,2022,11,11
34,Best kept secret in Barcelona!,"My family of 8 just stayed for 3 nights (before and after departing cruise ship).   The service is outstanding - the gentlemen who helped us at the front desk went over backwards to help with everything - from the welcome wine/champagne to arranging for a driver to the airport.  Not to mention that had to drag suitcases for 8 of us to/from car that can’t pull up to the front door!  The Contraban Restaurant was absolutely wonderful, which we weren’t expecting from a small hotel.  The rooms were lovely - I saw reviews that said the rooms were small, but we thought they were absolutely delightful.  Every room looks out to the lovely courtyard which has a garden wall.  And, the rooms are so quiet!  There is a roof top bar where they readily brought drinks and nibbles.  They never said no to us once!  And, we loved the location - right in the old Gothic City.  There are adorable bars, cafes and restaurants within easy walking distance.  Our family loved the Wittmore and we would go back again!  It is a Hyatt property, but if you want your Hyatt points, you have to book through Hyatt (apparently not the hotel or Small Leading Hotels).  We highly recommend The Wittmore!!",5,2022,10,20
34,Best experience,"Very good experience, awesome room and service... Especially Guillermo! 
If you want to eat Mediterranean food the restaurant in the hotel is the best!
Also the location is perfect to visit the center of the city.
I'll come back soon!",5,2022,09,05
34,Phil Oxlade-Chamberlain,"Been travelling for dozens of years for work and I have never felt so comfortable. The location is unbeatable, situated in a small alleyway in the old town of Barcelona  and when you least expect it you come across the hotel. The service was very friendly and attentive at all times. I wanted to try the restaurant and was amazed with the presentation of the dishes and the decoration. The rooms were exactly what the photos show: elegant, modern and comfortable. I already know which hotel I will stay at when I return to Barcelona.",5,2022,09,04
34,"Stunning, Modern Amenities and Old-Fashioned Service","This is an extremely classy establishment with outstanding service, highly recommended!  Stayed just shy of a week and loved every minute, no detail is spared.  Even the fragrance of the hotel stayed with us, it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.",5,2022,08,28
34,Beautiful hideaway in Barcelona,"The hotel itself is beautiful. From its hidden location in a back alley to the dimly lit and cozy interior — 10/10 for vibes. 

The room itself, while “tiny” was quite nice. Excellent air conditioning, very comfortable bed, nice Juliet balcony, and fantastic water pressure in the shower. 

Stopped at the bar for a drink and it was very good. The rooftop has quite a great view of the city and was also well appointed. Unfortunately while they had bar space on the roof, you had to press a button and wait or order downstairs. The website also had conflicting information about what was available on the roof (QR code in room states “beverage service only” while main website says they have a separate food menu). The pool is also only ~1 foot deep so not a “real” pool. 

Staff were friendly and welcoming, although it seems like they run with a small staff (occasionally no one at the front desk, roof bar not staffed, only one bartender). 

Overall I’d certainly return to this property!",4,2022,08,15
34,Lessons in how to manage a hotel brilliantly.  Look no further,"The Wittmore is the probably the perfect city break hotel.  Not big.  Lovely staff.  Great location.  Cute little courtyard.  The rooms aren’t large but then most places in that area are small - its the nature of the streets and architecture.  Everything is comfortable and well thought out.  The bathrooms are spectacular.  The bed are super comfy.  I didn’t have breakfast included in my room rate but the hotel were so hospitable and wouldn’t have dreamt of charging me for the coffee I had mid morning.  They were only to happy to furnish us with towels for our visit to the beach.  Under no obligation they gave us a room to shower and change in for our late flight departure.  It’s little touches like those that spell luxury for me.  And those are the ones that a guest remembers. Well done the Wittmore for managing to understand what a guest wants and providing a warm and welcoming atmosphere in a city full of hotels. You set yourself apart.

PS a full length mirror in the rooms would be fab - just a thought, not a criticism",5,2022,08,11
34,Heavenly,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights at the beginning our trip and it ruined all other hotels after that.  The customer service is outstanding from the moment of arrival until departure.  There is always someone there to assist you and provide advice.  They take great care to learn about their customers and cater to their needs.  

The rooftop terrace and staff are exceptional.  Front desk staff exceptional.  The food and staff at the restaurant also exceptional.  The rooms were tasteful and spotless.  The overall decor of the hotel was modern but still fit in for the Gothic Quarter.  Coming back to the hotel each day after exploring the city was great.  Relaxing and restorative.  We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,08,02
34,"Wonderful, relaxing and joyous","We spent five wonderful nights in this beautiful boutique hotel in the middle of the gothic quarter and could not recommend it highly enough. Not only are the staff super friendly and helpful but the rooms are very comfortable and the rooftop bar and plunge pool offer a quiet retreat where you can properly relax.

The restaurant’s menu is a little eccentric, but we liked that, and the langoustine carpaccio is worth planning a trip to Barcelona to experience… Michelin inspectors please check this extraordinary chef out as he/she deserves recognition.",5,2022,07,03
34,"Relaxed, luxurious and confidently chill hotel","Wonderful. No complaints. The staff are really friendly, laid back and the location is right in the middle of the gothic area. Really a special location and the hotel style, service and rooms are all of high quality yet blend in with the surroundings. Great food.

The bar staff on the rooftop are the best. 

Just really enjoy this place and we will be coming back soon.",5,2022,06,20
34,Incredible hotel in Gothic Quarter,"Excellent hotel in Gothic Quarter. Very nice, accommodating staff. Hotel itself is beautiful with first floor restaurant perfect for a quick meal / drink / espresso and stunning rooftop bar with panoramic views of the city. Location of the hotel is perfect as well, in the middle of the Gothic Quarter and walking distance to everything. Rooms were spacious, comfortable, and the bathroom was fantastic. Had some of our best sleep on our vacation here.",5,2022,05,31
34,A must stay in Barcelona,"Wow! I cannot wait to return. Everything about this hotel was outstanding! The staff were exceptional, the hotel is beautiful, yes rooms are small but it is all put together so well. This is in a fabulous location, walking distance to so many amazing restaurants and bars. The rooftop is a stunning plus , I can’t say enough about how great it is. We will definitely be back ‘",5,2022,05,26
34,"Great location,  friendly and cheerful staff but some aspects disappointing","We stayed at the Wittmore for six nights. The location of the hotel is excellent for sightseeing with many restaurants within easy walking distance. The staff were all very helpful, friendly and eager to please. However especially during the first couple of days of our stay they were obviously extremely short staffed. 

After we were seated for our first breakfast it was 20 minutes before the waiter came to take our order during which time we were not offered any coffee or even water. It took over an hour to have the meal. The waiter was lovely and kept apologizing for the delay saying he was the only member of staff present. The food when it did arrive was good.

A few days later we ate dinner at the hotel restaurant. We were 4 adults and our order was taken reasonably quickly. However the service for the meal was hopeless. My main dish arrived a full 15 minutes before any other dish arrived. In fact the last person's main course was a full 1 hour later. Quite unbelievable. This was unfortunate as otherwise the dinner was excellent and the food was actually quite delicious.

We do not know if the staffing issue was Covid related and if so then maybe it was understandable.

Our room was the Large type and it looked nice with good looking bathroom of decent size. We soon realised that some aspects of the bathroom were very impractical. The glass shower door was only half-way along the rest was the dreaded shower curtain which was sucked inwards as soon as the shower was on. The only two hooks in the bathroom where the staff put the bathrobes each day was inside the shower cubicle so we had to remove these before showering. There were no towel rails at all just a shelf below the sinks where new towels were rolled up and placed there, so there was nowhere to dry out wet towels. The one and only mirror in the whole room was in the bathroom and it steamed up after the shower was used. 

The bedroom itself was rather dark despite good sized windows looking onto the courtyard and the dark lampshades made it very dimly lit at night too. The seating was rather uncomfortable and there was nowhere to put a computer just two bedside tables (one had a large radio on and the other the two large glass water bottles) and a small coffee table. The bed was very comfortable, the room was nice and quiet and we slept well.

We also had an issue with items not replaced when the room was serviced each day. One day we only had 1 hand towel not 2), one day the coffee machine pods were not replaced and the machine itself was not emptied (my husband did this as it was full and would not work otherwise), on two days our bottled water was not replaced and we were minus a wash cloth on one day also. Fairly minor, yes, but when we called down to reception to report this on several occasions our call went unanswered.

In summary we enjoyed our stay, the food was good but there were little niggles which left us a bit frustrated.",3,2022,05,10
34,Utterly wonderful!,"What a gem of a hotel, 20 odd rooms, intimate, attentive but respectful staff, best cocktails I’ve ever tasted and a wonderful roof terrace. I can’t say a bad word about this place- definitely worth a visit if you like boutique hotels!",5,2022,04,12
34,Perfect little gem of hotel in Gothic Quarter,"My husband and I can’t say enough good things about this beautiful little gem of a hotel tucked into an ancient side street in Barcelona’s famed gothic quarter.  From perfectly appointed rooms to the talented mixologist to truly kind, attentive  and professional staff, we could not have picked a better place to stay.  All the rooms look out on a lovely, quiet courtyard that seems miles away from the hustle and bustle of the city, but the hotel is in easy walking distance from the waterfront, Las Ramblas and other attractions.  Arriving on an early morning flight, they bent over backwards to give us an early check-in for a much needed snooze before setting out into the city.  The price was so reasonable for all this hotel had to offer.  Bed, towels, in room bar, and spa like bathroom were dreamy.  We seldom write reviews, but this place is truly special.  Thank you for a truly memorable stay.",5,2022,03,25
34,Charming hotel,"We only spent one night at the Wittmore, which in retrospect was a good choice. The bar and library are beautiful and cozy. They offered us a complimentary glass of wine which we enjoyed by the fireplace. The service was excellent and attentive. The reason I am giving 4 stars rather than 5 is because the room which I booked was supposed to be small, not tiny, and was extremely cramped. I could not even open my suitcase without hitting something. There is no way my daughter and I would have been comfortable for over a night. I asked for a quiet room and for some reason they put us on the first floor?  it was a rainy night and relatively quiet at the hotel, but given the busy neighborhood of the Gothic district the sound proofing must be excellent because I heard only a little  We ordered room service and the food was good. Unfortunately the diverter was not working in my shower so I had to use the hand held sprayer with would not stay put in it's holder so it kept facing the wall or I just put it down on the ground until I needed to rinse. This should have been reported by housekeeping and this room should not have been offered to a guest, in my opinion. Unfortunately, the weather was not great so we did not get to enjoy the rooftop bar. The other issue is the trash in the street of the alley to the hotel. I would recommend the hotel, but only for a short stay unless you want to spend money on a larger room. ",4,2022,03,17
34,A must stay in the Gothic,"We splurged alittle and were not disappointment on the awesome location of this boutique hotel.  Down a quaint, narrow side street lays a dark, lavish oasis that is so calming from the bustle of the city.  Walking in, you'll love it!  Our highlights were the rooftop deck in the afternoons to unwind/relax with some light bites after a busy morning of adventures... and the amazing breakfast every day.  It was great to just walk down and fuel up with delicious food and attentive service. We were spoiled.  The bar is great below, but with the rooms you can sometimes hear the 1 loud person at the bar if you go to bed before midnight.  A true hideaway that made our trip so special- we could walk almost anywhere too! So close to the ocean and so many restaurants on the streets, close to shopping too.  A must stay!",5,2021,08,07
34,Best bar in Barcelona,"We didn’t stay at the hotel, but we stumbled across the bar one night and had the best drinks of our life. Eduardo hand crafts drinks of every flavor and they are so thoughtfully our together. Completely delicious. The vibe of the bar is really chill - gorgeous outside patio with a plant walk and open to the sky. The inside is so unique - it had a bookshelf wall, a plaid wall, fireplaces and cushy couches. At midnight a disco ball drops. Such a fun place, great drinks. We kept ending up there at the end of our nights out.",5,2020,02,16
34,Absolutely Divine!,"Last morning in Barcelona but we’d definitely recommend a sojourn here. Imagine the city has changed quite dramatically since I was last here 24 years ago but a lovely place to visit out of season.

Weather a very comfortable 15-20 degrees, a nice warm spring so not too hot or cold to get out and about and explore.

We found the most beautiful independent boutique hotel called the Wittmore. Tucked away in an alley in the gothic quarter right by all the action but at the same time an oasis of calm. Couldn’t ask for more from an affordable 5* star hotel and their philosophy covers quite an old school etiquette of no children and no photography so less of the Instagram influencer nonsense and more old school art of relaxation and conversation! Amazing what taking away the need to post on social media does to the atmosphere of a place. Definitely get the breakfast and make sure you visit Eduardo the mixologist! 

Very rare to find a hotel where every little detail has been thought through and the upmost care put into everything, from music to aroma! There’s even a fabulous roaring fire and calming green wall in the courtyard.

The staff couldn’t have been nicer and the room couldn’t have been any more comfortable even if they tried! The blackout windows and absolute silence on an evening makes for a great sleep!

The rooftop bar and pool has cracking views and must be a delight when the city gets just too hot.

The location is spot on for most of the places you’ll want to visit (walking distance to el born, gothic quarter, the beach etc) and we ate incredibly well at restaurants barely a few steps away from hotel.

Whilst your here, try to visit Koy Shunka, a Michilin star Japanese restaurant which is absolutely divine. The tasting menu was a fabulous culinary experience and a great way to spend a birthday!

As is our thing, we managed to organise a very relaxed few days combining lots of walking, shopping and the best sights to visit. We managed to get to Nou Camp, La Boqueria, La Ramblas, the gothic quarter, el born, Sagrada Familia, Santa Maria del Mar, Parc Cuitadella and Parc Guell, the beach, Gracia, the Picasso museum and more, without feeling particularly tired or stressed. There was still plenty of time for endless coffees, oysters for lunch in Barceloneta, a quick trip up the cable car to Montjuic and a visit to the amazing tailor Oscar H. Grand in El Born. 

Nowhere felt particularly touristy, expensive or too busy. We barely queued anywhere and even Sagrada Familia had a lovely sense of serenity and spirituality.

Next time we’ll bring an empty suitcase for the amazing artisan products and clothes made right here in the city.

Overall a fantastic city for a lovely long city break. Couldn’t ask for more in a holiday and every penny spent at The Wittmore was well worth it!",5,2020,02,07
34,Stylish tranquil oasis,"Excellent location in Gothic Area close to port front.
Fantastic suite, excellent customer service from all staff and super food. Rooms have everything you need.
It's quiet and relaxing. The roof bar and sun terrace would be great in summer, we were there in January so enjoying the roof top views with your jacket on was a delight.
There are restaurants within a short walking distance, the hotel is first class.
We enjoyed everything about the stay.",5,2020,02,04
34,What a gem!,"The Wittmore is tucked away in a small alley in the Gothic quarter.  It feels special just upon arrival.  The property is a wonderful respite in a big city.  Both the courtyard and roof deck are relaxing places to eat, read, and generally take a break from the sightseeing.  Throughout our stay the staff was extremely helpful and even helped us move around our reservation due to flight issues.  

The rooms are small but well appointed.  With the shutters closed it can be very dark (great for sleeping, tough for breaking through the jet lag).  

Overall, highly recommend this for couples staying in Barcelona.

34,BCN Perfection,"This is a beautiful hotel. It is small, intimate and warm. The rooms are cozy and the staff anticipates your needs so well. The room we booked is nicely sized and we have the Large King. The restaurant and lounge are sumptuously decorated and the cocktail master is an artist. ",5,2020,01,01
34,Perfection,"My husband and I stayed at the Wittmore for three nights (kicking off a weeklong trip around Spain) and could not have been more pleased with our stay. The hotel is immaculate - with gorgeous, masculine decor, a cozy fireplace, a rooftop with unbelievable views of Barcelona, and a picturesque courtyard. The staff went above and beyond to ensure we felt welcome and that all of our needs were met. Special shout out to the fantastic concierges Luigi and Guillermo for their guidance. And an extra thank you to the absolute master of specialty cocktails Eduardo, who prepared our pre dinner drinks each night with artistry! The delicious breakfasts and coffee made for perfect morning send offs. It was hard to say goodbye to this beautiful hotel and its amazing staff!",5,2019,12,20
34,Fantastico!,"Small romantic boutique hotel hidden in the Gothic quarter. Excellent location once you become familiar with your surroundings. Small but with a big personality, sophisticated but homey. Staff was excellent and accommodating, concierge service was excellent. The restaurant was superb as was the intimate bar, especially if you are fortunate enough to have Eduardo behind the bar. The rooms are well appointed, well decorated, with lots of light from the atrium. Didn’t spend much time on the roof top bar .... next time, when we rerun in the summer. All-in-all one of top small hotels in Europe.",5,2019,11,24
34,Amazing service!,"My wife and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. We loved everything about this hotel, from the cool decor, the great breakfast, and the very helpful staff.  (Thomas...with an H!!), made sure we had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable, and even walked our bags with us to the taxi when we left. Service with a smile! Thank you for making sure we had a great visit!",5,2019,11,04
34,Pre Cruise Treat!,"Wonderful boutique hotel!  Beautifully done.  The ""small double"" room was quite roomy with every room in hotel overlooking the lovely courtyard.  Oscar, Tomas, and Phillipe could not have been more helpful and attentive!!  Would recommend this lovely, quiet, elegant, off the beaten track but right in the middle of the Gothic area!!",5,2019,10,29
34,Beautiful boutique hotel in beautiful Barcelona,"My husband and I have just returned from a week at The Wittmore Hotel in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona, and we can't stop talking about how wonderful our stay was. 

We arrived at the hotel to check in for our 6 night stay with Luigi and Berta, only to find out that our assistant had a miscommunication with the hotel, and we were only booked for one night. Before our panic could set in, both of them assured us that we would be accommodated for the whole week even though they were fully booked. They were genuine, efficient, and managed to find us a room within a few hours. It was wonderful how they took a potentially difficult situation for us, and smoothed it out without us having to worry. We were both so impressed with how well we were treated by Luigi and Berta. Perfect first impression.

Our room was just lovely, and very well appointed. It was romantic, with literally the best linens we've ever slept on in a hotel. Seriously, we're contacting the management to find out where they get their sheets so we can buy a set for ourselves. Unbelievably soft. The decor of the room was also very sexy, yet classy. The wood shutters completely block out morning sun when closed, which was great after late nights strolling through the Gothic Quarter. Even the bathroom fixtures pretty. Basically, if you're impressed by attention to details, you'll find The Wittmore a perfect stay.

Another notable mention....the rooftop pool deck was amazing. A small, shallow soaking pool surrounded by cushy lounge chairs with an abundance of pillows to lounge on. There's also a fantastic food menu they offer while on the roof deck, along with cocktails. Eduardo the bar manager was brilliant at creating cocktails we'd never tried before, and quite the ambassador of the party. 

Lastly, the location of The Wittmore can't be matched. We were never further than a 10-15 minute walk to anywhere in the Gothic Quarter. We had only to taxi when going to Park Güell, and Camp Nou. 

Hopefully you find this review helpful, and worth the time. We were completely impressed, satisfied, and excited about our time at The Wittmore. Beautiful place with equally beautiful people! ",5,2019,10,08
34,Wonderful place to stay! ,"Beautiful hotel with wonderful people al the front desk, specially Cristian and Oscar who were friendly and ready to help all the time. Breakfast is good, dinner service is slow and since I have allergy problems waitress was not at all helpful or creative on finding alternatives for me. Rooms are clean and cozy. Beautiful terrace with wonderful view and delicious beautiful cocktails prepared by Eduardo. I would certainly come back when I visit Barcelona again.",4,2019,10,06
34,Loved this hotel!,"We give The Wittmore and excellent rating in every category from service, to quality of room, and exellent restaurant.  Unlike a large chain hotel or an old school ""grand"" hotel, the Wittmore is a warm and welcoming personalized service experience.  ",5,2019,09,30
34,Luxury Hotel in Gothic Quarter w/ Amazing Service,The service at this hotel was some of the best we have experienced from across the world.  Very nice hotel room with some of the most comfortable robes.  Drinks at the restaurant were also delicious and the interior garden was a nice backdrop..,5,2019,09,27
34,Wonderful Wittmore ,"My husband and I absolutely loved staying at The Wittmore! The location is excellent and is within walking distance to many attractions. The rooms are immaculate and well appointed. The roof top terrace is wonderful to sit and have a drink or a bite to eat while looking over the city. It’s a beautiful hotel.
There are many beautiful hotels but not all with staff like this that truly make you love this hotel. They are so personable and friendly. So knowledgeable and willing to help with your every need. The doorman, the wee gal that served me coffee, the turn down maid, the rooftop bartender and the front desk crew ....I think you are all amazing. Thanks for making our stay in Barcelona so wonderful. ",5,2019,09,23
34,City break in a gem of a boutique hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"Booked The Wittmore after reading many good reviews and having taken a look at their cool website. The hotel did not fail to deliver with the room being fantastic, despite being labelled as a small, and all the staff were ultra helpful. Ate breakfast and an evening meal in the restaurant which also came right up to scratch.
Thoroughly recommended.",5,2019,09,17
34,Great Hotel,"What a great spot. The hotel is nestled in a great area for roaming and sampling Tapas. The Staff here is exceptional. Very attentive to every request, warm and friendly. Rooms are dark but very well appointed. The top floor deck is a must for sunset and views of skyline and harbor. If you like a small hotel with great service this is the spot. I would definitely recommend. ",5,2019,09,08
34,Amazing experience,"My husband and I had a one night BCN layover on the back end of our Summer trip and we decided to treat ourselves to the Whittmore.  The hotel staff are impeccable. They are overly accommodating to every request.  The hotel is swanky and luxurious.  The rooms were beautiful with every detail accounted for.  As in most cases, the in room drinks and snacks were overpriced so we stayed away from those.  But the restaurant, the Whitty, may have been one of the best meals I have ever had.  You must eat there.  The decor is so elegant and intimate, I felt like a celebrity.  The staff was attentive but not invasive.  We each had 3 courses and the food was to DIE for, including a complementary amuse bouche.  The wine was very reasonably priced.  Beautiful experience.  Don't hesitate to stay here, but at the very least, you MUST eat here.",5,2019,09,05
34,Great hotel,"Amazing hotel in an amazing neighborhood. The location of this hotel couldn’t be better, from the very moment I walked out of the hotel I felt in the middle of everything, night life, small shops, narrow European streets. The hotel staff was amazing as well, always trying to do their best, they do not overcharge you but rather focus on making your stay pleasant. Thank you again, guys!
I have spent two beautiful days in Barcelona and in this hotel, and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2019,09,02
34,A hotel that goes the extra mile...,"We came to The Wittmore as part of a friends getaway. From the word go, we knew it was going to be a special place. Tucked away in a small alley, the front immediately screams class. Inside, the decor is sultry (almost to the point of being too dark) and opulent, with the air of a private and exclusive club. The design of the whole building is aimed towards guests having a luxurious experience. The rooftop terrace is crowning jewel, with 360 degree views of the city. However, it is the staff who really make this hotel stand out. Nothing is too much bother and with every exchange, no matter what the request, you are left with the distinct impression that nothing is too much and that this is not just a job to them. Everything is very personal and bespoke. The front desk were always incredibly helpful and cordial, having your key ready before even asking for it, attending to all our requests. The bar and serving team are also of the same ilk. Cocktails mixed by Eduardo are a must! Overall, a really fabulous hotel.",5,2019,09,01
34,Stylish gem for grown ups,"Had a lovely time here at this hidden gem with perfect service. The rooms were very comfortable, the beds/pillows fabulous, and the roof terrace was cute with a generous amount of sunbed space for the square meterage and the splash pool just what we needed to cool off while enjoying a bottle of rose. They couldn't have been more helpful at the concierge, storing our rental bikes, ordering cabs, etc. Breakfast was lovely too and the little courtyard for dining and drinks was sweet. It looked like a great place for winter with the tartan carpet and cosy classy bar vibes inside. They just seemed to get everything right!",5,2019,08,24
34,Impecabble Service in the heart of the Gothic Quarter,"After the better part of a week in an apartment (which left something to be desired), I decided to check into The Wittmore for my last night in Barcelona.  To say I was pleased with my decision would be an understatement.  From the moment I called to inquire if I could check-in early, to the warm welcome and room upgrade, to the rooftop daybeds, to the tranquility of the cozy ""small"" accommodation, it was brilliant.  I was a little worried that it might be seedy given the admonition of ""Adults Only.  No Pets.  No Photos,"" but my concerns were unfounded.  Nothing seedy about it.  Just a grown up hotel with amazing service, wonderful food, and comfy rooms. My only complaints (not really complaints, just obversations): 1) the rooftop pool can at best be called a wading pool; and 2) the inner rooms on the lower floors were pretty dark (but with the AC made a great place for an afternoon siesta).

I will most certainly stay here again!",5,2019,08,06
34,Wonderful Hotel Experience!,This adult only hotel is located in a great part of the city.  We could basically walk to every site we wanted to explore. The room was wonderfully decorated and all the staff extremely professional and polite. And the aroma that constantly flows through the hote is calming and not over bearing. Without a doubt my husband and I will return.  This place helped us fall in love with Barcelona. ,5,2019,08,03
34,Fab bar and food!,I love this hotel.  The bar area and the dining area are very special.  Just a great reprieve from the bustling streets.  And the owner of the hotel is so friendly! The wine list is great and the bar snacks were superb. ,5,2019,07,18
34,Excellent hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Wittmore in the beginning of our honeymoon. We absolutely loved the hotel and the staff. It’s a small hotel, which made our stay feel extra special and more exclusive. The rooms are immaculate. The best part of our stay was the service. The staff was so nice and helpful. Gianluigi wrote down a bunch of recommendations for us and was always so helpful - along with the other staff members. The rooms are made up twice a day so you have fresh towels at night and the maid leaves these delicious chocolates. I wish I brought some home! It is a quaint hotel with a special charm to it and wonderful staff. Stay here! You won’t regret it.",5,2019,07,18
34,Best Hotel ever,"We came into this hotel for private vacation, end this is definitely the best welcome hotel with very nice employees who wish to help any time you just need
A very clean hotel with best service.
Highly recommended",5,2019,07,15
34,Beautiful oasis in a sea of tourism,"Stunning hotel hidden off a side lane in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona.
Staff are amazingly attentive, friendly and knowledgable of all things local.
Best thing about Barcelona for us.  10 out of 10 .. if you miss it .. you miss out.",5,2019,07,13
34,Fabulous stay at this boutique hotel,We stayed for my husbands 50th.  We were welcomed to our room with a beautiful desert for his birthday.  The hotel itself is extremely quiet and rooms are small but had everything you need.  The bed and bedding was possibly the best I have experienced in a hotel.  I would highly recommend this hotel.  We loved the location.,5,2019,07,12
34,THE BEST!!,"My husband and I just traveled through Europe for 2 weeks. This hotel was by far our favorite, they took such care with every detail. The staff were amazing!!! So lovely, all incredibly helpful and recommended the best restaurants of our whole trip. When we return to Barcelona we will absolutely stay here, the rooms were lovely! The breakfast was delicious and so fresh! Couldn’t have loved our stay more! Definitely stay here!! ",5,2019,07,06
34,Incredible and special stay,"The hotel was beautiful and Luigi was absolutely incredible and attentive. He made sure we were always taken care of — from coordinating meals (and walking us to the restaurants in the area) to ensuring we made it to a last minute Gary Clark Jr. concert on time, he truly went above and beyond. Thomas was also incredible and kind and a great resource for our stay. The service was stellar and something we know is hard to find elsewhere. The garden and rooftop were so beautiful and quiet — truly a relaxing stay. The fact that the hotel is hidden down an alley way made it that much more special.",5,2019,07,04
34,Stunning boutique hotel,"The Wittmore is a beautiful hotel, it’s modern and elegant and we loved it.  It’s located in the gothic quarter with lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance. Our package included breakfast which we ate in the beautiful courtyard every morning. The set menu included, a hot drink, fruit and yoghurt (the best yoghurt I’ve ever tasted I’m sure it must have a million calories) a basket of pastries and then a choice of egg dishes. 
The roof terrace is stunning the cushioned day beds are so comfortable we had a late flight so we used the roof terrace until late in the day. Our room was very comfortable and the bed is like a cloud, we kept one shutter open during the night as once they’re closed it’s pitch black in the rooms. 

We will definitely return to this hotel when we return to Barcelona. ",5,2019,06,29
34,Magnífic Boutique!,"We had a wonderful stay in The Wittmore, Barcelona. Everything was exactly as advertised, in fact, it was better! The staff were warm and accommodating and always ready to help, when needed. A special mention to the concierge, Luigi, who was fantastic! His restaurant recommendations were always spot on. 

We stayed in a “tiny” room and while it was small, it was no less luxurious. We loved it! We had to be a little creative with where we put our belongings but we managed well enough. 

The roof top was special and relaxing with a paddle pool to cool off in, if needed. Just chilling up there after a busy day of sight seeing, was ideal.   

While I believe they have big rooms (we never saw one), if you’re looking for a US Midwest style hotel with gargantuan rooms, this is not the hotel for you. If however, you are looking for a hotel that is unique, intimate, private, welcoming, luxurious and generally just special, then we (my wife and I), highly recommend The Wittmore in Barcelona.",5,2019,06,26
34,Couldn't recommend it more!,"This is everything it says it is and more. A wonderful place to stay where you really feel at home. Nothing is too difficult for the staff, the breakfast was amazing, the patio garden a real gem to plan your day. The rooms with an extra touch of space was much appreciated with two travellers and a lot of luggage. The interior décor in the lobby, rooms and rooftop bar were beautiful. We needed reservations and assistance with car hire, all provided without fuss. Couldn’t recommend it more.",5,2019,06,18
34,Good hotel in a great location.,Boutique hotel in a great location in Barcelona. Good and helpful staff. Ambiance is quite dark. The rooftop pool is quite small and is more of a paddling pond! We stayed for 5 nights and always looked forward to going back at night to enjoy the hotel.,5,2019,06,07
34,Staff is amazing!!!,"Luigi and Gabriel did everything for us: gave a tour of the room and property, recommended restaurants and made impossible-to-get reservations, sent a staff member to take us to the nearest phone store, marked up a map with many possible destinations, called all taxis, EVERYTHING. Best service I’ve ever experienced (even with 20+ years of being an executive with American Express).
Small room, but still a stunning property.",5,2019,06,04
34,Fate,Trust me if you found this hotel book it. You will not regret it. One of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. Perfect location wonderful staff delightful charm. This hotel has everything you could want and more.,5,2019,05,31
34,Beautiful boutique hotel in the Gothic Quarter ,"I booked this hotel for our 10th wedding anniversary, and it did not disappoint. Location was great, room was extremely well appointed and the attention to detail was noticed. Staff were genuinely kind and helpful. Meals, drinks, bedding, pillows, turn down service, free bottle waters... everything you could expect from a five star hotel. ",5,2019,05,29
34,Vacation ,"They Are Amazing! You can not get better staff Anywhere!!! I can’t say enough about this place. I have never gone to a hotel and have been treated with such care. I am truly spoiled! The location is Great and within walking distance of everything in old city. My only suggestion is when booking make sure you get the correct room size. We started out in a smaller room and when wanted to make a change, they could not do enough. ",5,2019,05,21
34,Like a home away from home,"Even though the Wittmore is located in the middle of the bustling old city, it's hidden away  and once you enter the hotel you feel sheltered from the outside world. It's cozy, elegant and modern - all at the same time. 

What really makes the experience so great is the kindness and attentiveness of the staff, it's not only about the service, but about the feeling of care that they leave behind. (Especially the doormen we encountered made us feel they personally cared.) I would recommend a Dark and Stormy drink in front of the fireplace on a rainy day, and the original tomato salad.",5,2019,05,09
34,Hidden gem in the heart of Barcelona,"We stayed here for 4 nights in April 2019. We were greeted by Luigi the concierge whose warm manner and professional expertise set the tone for the entire visit. The public spaces are spectacular and the rooms contain every amenity - including luxury linens, wonderful in room bar, and prompt room service.  The roof top deck was the perfect place for a snack and drink.  The staff was attentive and friendly and made dinner reservations at excellent restaurants which really enhanced the quality of our stay. We will definitely return here on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2019,05,06
34,"Beautifully designed, amazing location","An fantastic gem in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, with beautifully designed rooms and public spaces, very pleasant and knowledgable staff. A tranquil, sophisticated, sultry oasis in the centre of Barcelona.",5,2019,05,03
34,"Beautiful rooftop with sun deck, amazing decor all around","The room was beautiful and bed was super comfortable. The design of the entire hotel is really unique and impressive. Our bellman Thomas (or Tomas?) was the best and a great help for our stay! We did not get a chance to eat at the restaurant but we did order food to the sun deck (Rose, meat and cheese) and it was delicious all around.
The sun deck was my favorite part. A beautiful bed of yellow.
The hotel was a bit pricey but the experience was 5 stars",5,2019,05,01
34,Overall just an amazing experience with professional and lovely staff members!,"We stayed here in april of 2019 for 5 nights and in summary we just want to write that the stay was amazing. 

Related to the hotel itself; the hotel is located in the old city which is amazing. When you walk outside you find yourself in the centre of the old town surrounded by hundreds of small shops; the hotel smells lovely and every staff member is friendly and helpful; The rooms (even the smaller ones) have everything you need and they look amazing (the hotel is only about three years old); The breakfast was wonderful! (some other reviews say that the options are limited, but I personally disagree). We had breakfast included which comes with juice, coffee/tea, fruitsalade, yoghurt, cereal, toast, croissants, omelette and more. All the ingredients were fresh and prepared with lots of attention; During our stay the weather was quite windy, but the hotel does offer a great roofterras with an amazing view of the city; and last but not least, we absolutely loved the shared area/bar of the hotel. It is cosy, warm and just gorgeous to look at.

While we were absolutely impressed with the hotel, we would still like to give our biggest compliment to the hotel staff. I do not know if management is reading this review, but just know that you have AMAZING personnel working at the Wittmore. Everyone was just extremely kind, helpful, friendly and super professional. Our main reason to go back to the Wittmore would definitely be for the staff at first place.

Thank you all for an AMAZING stay!

Kind regards,

Kais :)",5,2019,05,01
34,Best hotel sleep ever,"I chose this hotel based on the TA reviews, and don't think I have anything new to add to the conversation. The location, property, and most importantly the staff, truly deserve all of the praise that they've received. 

Perhaps one thing that stood out for my wife and me, that hasn't been abundantly described, was sleep quality. Our Large room provided the quietest atmosphere and most restful hotel sleep we've ever had. 

To address the most common ""knock,"" yes, it's a little dark in some areas, but for us, the lighting contributes to the cozy and relaxed feel of the hotel...and serves as an appropriate extension of the cavernous Gothic Quarter environment.",5,2019,04,24
34,Tiny Jewel Box,"The interior of this hotel feels like an elegant London townhouse.  From the moment we arrived the staff treated us like royalty.  The service level was better than any hotel I've stayed at including my favorite Mandarin Oriental. All staff was outstanding, however Gabriel went beyond expectations assisting us in the resolution of a problem we had with a dishonest cab driver that charged us 45E for a 1.5 km ride from cruise terminal to Wittmore. He showed real concern for his guests. Tomas at the door was so helpful with directions (crazy morass that Gothic Quarter).  Denny always fun to talk to at meals.  Our suite was comfortable, soft quality bedding.  Super clean.  The water pressure in the shower made it hard to get out of.  Very good food and generous cocktails.  Pure luxury in the over populated maze that is the Gothic Quarter.",5,2019,04,15
34,A hidden gem in Barcelona!,"We stayed in this luxurious boutique hotel for 5 nights where the rooms where very comfortable and the staff were all lovely.
The hotel is in an excellent location in the gothic quarter for bars, restaurants, independent shops and near the marina. It is hidden away and difficult to find so I suggest you ask your taxi drive to drop you off at behind the office (or “Correos” – you will see all the yellow post office vans parked up) on the corner of Carrer d’Angel Baixeras and Carrer de la Fusteria and then you can walk down Carrer d’En Gignas and then the hotel is after the third “street” on the right and lies back a bit. It’s not signposted so you do have to look for it.
We chose a larger room which had a little settee and table which was perfect to have breakfast and a very large comfy bed. We would have benefited from a full length mirror and a choice to have a brighter light in the bedroom. The bathroom was a good size and had plenty of light. Lots of room for storage and in room safe. Note that there is no kettle in the rooms. Housekeeping made sure the rooms were immaculate and we were greeted with a surprise nearly every day, ranging from a fruit bowl, a birthday cake, chocolates and fresh bottled water.
The hotel boasts a fantastic rooftop terrace with views of the sea, Montjuic and the Sagrada Familia. There are plenty of sun loungers and small pool on the terrace and a bar (bar was not open when we were there but a waiter service is available). It was just perfect, relaxing with a glass of wine, watching the sun go down after a hard days sightseeing.
The bar and restaurant were excellent and Helena makes smashing cocktail – she is truly an asset to the hotel as she was always helpful and greeted us with a lovely smile. 
We ate in the comfortable intimate restaurant to celebrate my birthday and the food was elegant and delicious. Again Helena and her colleague were attentive and made the evening very special for us. 
Unfortunately our last night at the hotel did not go to plan as we wanted a quiet cosy night. The hotel hosted a birthday party so we couldn’t use the bar area (had to use the restaurant). We ended up going out for dinner only to return to a very noisy party going on. As the party was in the bar area and the ground floor terrace, the loud music, shouting and screaming ascended up to our rooms so we couldn’t sleep until the early hours. I did ring up reception who did not do anything. We would have given this hotel 5 stars but the last night really let us down.
Thomas was there to greet us with a sunny smile at the end of the day and he provided an excellent service when we departed the hotel. Our taxi could not pick us up near the hotel as the police had moved him on. Thomas spoke to the driver/company and walked us to the taxi which was about 10 minutes away and he helped us with our luggage. We are very grateful to Thomas and thank you for ensuring that we got to our taxi safely.
We would return to this hotel in the future… as long as there are no late night parties taking place!
Thank you Witty!",4,2019,04,10
34,My favorite hotel when staying in Barcelona,This is my husband and I second time staying at The Wittmore and love this hotel. We have stayed at other hotels before this but discovered this last year and stayed  here again this trip. This is my favorite hotel in Barcelona. The hotel is charming and the staff top notch. Everything about it is superb from the rooms and beds to the location in the gothic area. I love the smell when you walk in the door. You won’t be disappointed.,5,2019,04,01
34,A fabulous stay in a stay fabulous hotel,"My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We loved it. The staff were welcoming and helpful from beginning to end. We loved the ambiance and décor of the hotel - really luxurious and extremely clean. Our room was excellent with plenty of space and the bed was extremely comfortable. We loved the bathroom products and the minibar was really well stocked with everything you could want. The waiting staff were brilliant and really attentive to our needs. We absolutely loved the roof terrace and enjoyed 2 lunches up there in the sun and loved the fact that it was a peaceful oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

The only thing we found disappointing and irritating was that there was no coffee machine in the room which we would have liked and would have expected in a 5* hotel. We were told we could have coffee at anytime but on both mornings we ordered coffee in room there was a problem. On the first morning it never arrived and the 2nd morning we had to chase twice to get it sent up to our room and when it did arrive it came without milk! It would be so easy to just put a nespresso  machine in the room! Although this was a small issue it would have made our stay better had we been able to make coffee in our room at our convenience. 

Overall this hotel is fabulous and we can't recommend it highly enough and we will definitely be back there for another stay.",5,2019,03,31
34,Outstanding Hotel and Hospitality start to finish.,"My wife and I spent a week at the Wittmore.  The property itself is absolutely beautiful and very clean.  Great amenities.  The hospitality is what pushes it over the top.  Every person we encountered had a great passion for hospitality.  Luigi was our main concierge and anticipated every need of ours and took a personal interest in our stay to make sure had the best experience possible in Barcelona.  Gabriel, Marta and our Bartender Helena were also passionate about our experience.  I will recommend the Wittmore to anyone staying in Barcelona.  Thank you very much all!  what a great experience.",5,2019,03,29
34,"second time in Barcelona, second time at the Wittmore","Absolute perfect in the layout, interior decoration, details, and staff kindness. Nothing seems superfluous, and there's an overall balance and taste. The British style in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea.
Besides, the Wittmore is nested in the Gothic borough, walking distance from anything that Barcelona is famous for.
Highly recommended.",5,2019,03,21
34,Wow a real gem,"We travel often and have stayed in chain hotels, boutique hotels, homes...the Whittmore is top notch.  The staff is fabulous concerned with every detail. The hotel is charming, welcoming, comfortable, stylish and lavish. I don’t usually eat hotel food however their dining area was so beautiful we chose to dine in & are thrilled we did! I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,03,10
34,Amazing stay in Gothic center,We had an amazing stay at this wonderful boutique hotel.   Everything from the library to the restaurant to the rooms were simply amazing.  The location gives you perfect walking distance to many of the amazing sites around Barcelona.    Highly recommend!,5,2019,03,05
34,Almost don't want to share...,"My husband and I visited this hotel for the second time...two years apart. Each time has been amazing. The hotel is situated in an alley, off a tiny street. You really feel tucked away in a private luxury retreat within the old, Gothic quarter. It's quite magical to be in that neighborhood, which is one of the best to explore if you've never been to Barcelona before. The rooms are wonderful - we appreciate the double sink (perfect for couples), the soft bed and sheets, the gorgeous and thoughtful design elements, and the views to the courtyard. The staff is beyond helpful, going above and beyond to provide recommendations or book an event. We had several people helping us as one coordinated team. Everyone knew what was going on and were so professional and friendly. The food is eclectic, to say there's no theme to the menu, but it's all delicious. Not ""just hotel food,"" but a lovely dining experience. If it's warm I highly recommend taking in the views from the pool rooftop - gorgeous. And if it's cold, perhaps snuggle up with a game of chess and perfected cocktail in the library. The Wittmore is almost too good to share, but as a thank you to all the wonderful staff who made our second trip another unforgettable experience - we recognize you with appreciation.",5,2019,02,25
34,Awesome place to stay,"room, location, food was as expected; really really good; friendly staff; cosy place in the middle of Barcelona - Gothic center; due to the small amount of rooms a quiet place to stay; you hardly see other guests; the roof top terrace provides a wonderful overview
 over the city",5,2019,02,24
34,"Wonderful Place, Wonderful Staff","This is a 5 star hotel in the best part of Barcelona.  The manager is extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  The staff was inviting and professional.  The room was comfortable, well equipped and immaculate.  The food was fine dining at its best.  Time and effort is apparent in even the small details.   The front desk is well informed about the area and their suggestions were accurate and perfect for our desires.  We will return here when in Barcelona again.  Thank you for the pleasant experience.

34,The best Vacation we had in a long time,"very friendly  good recommendations for restaurants We  booked Small room and it was clean, nice . The hotel was very quite we didn't hear any other guests.Our last night at the hotel we booked Tinny room but they upgraded us with no charge. I would give this hotel 10.",5,2019,02,20
34,Hidden Gem (But Eat and Drink Somewhere Else),"I sweat I don't mean to be mean spirited about my review. I really liked this place.... The first thing I'll tell you is that the hotel is a little hard to find. I suggest using google maps even if you know your way around Barcelona. 
It is very centrally located, walking distance from the waterfront, the beach, the gothic quarters, many restaurants and bars, etc. etc.... But the entrance is through a small  alley, so inconspicuous that even with a GPS system telling you that you're in the right place, you can still miss. If the bellman or doorman are not standing outside you will totally miss it, like I did the first time around.
But once you find it, this place is beautiful... It is just my style. A small luxury hotel with great decor, quiet, stylish, very chic. My room was in the second floor. Not too big, but big enough, the bed was AWESOME! High quality mattress that was just what I needed. A nice Marshalls mini radio ready to plug or pair with your device, and shutter doors on the windows that can make your room as dark as you need it at any time of the day (I really love this feature!) very nice shower and nicely decorated bathroom.
When we arrived the front staff was very polite and accommodating. Very quickly expediting our room check in, which gave me a great feeling of ""I'm in the right place""....

My one negative experience? The bar/restaurant area. Such poor service! I was very discouraged by the lackadaisical attitude of the wait staff. The service certainly didn't match any of the other services of this hotel, which up to this point had been excellent in every other area. 
I decided to stay at this hotel after thoroughly researching it, based on many comments that praised it elegance and premium atmosphere, which turned out to be on point.
Everything started when my girlfriend and I decided to go to the bar for an early afternoon drink. We stepped into the very elegant restaurant/bar area, where there was a young lady doing some preparations behind the bar. We stood in the front facing her, waiting to be asked if we wanted something. The girl looked at us, and for some ten or twelve minutes continued about her business, as we patiently waited for her to become unoccupied. After our long wait, I stepped up to her and addressed her to ask for two cocktails, but then after all that time, she decided to inform us that the bar wasn't open yet. She could have said that to us the minute we walked in! Needless to say, after expecting the same quality of service we received when we arrived and not getting it, we were pretty puzzled and upset.
We decided to go get our drink somewhere else and walk around the town for a few hours. When we returned in the evening, around 630pm we decided to grab a cocktail at the lobby bar again.... This time, there was a young man behind the bar, preparing drinks and we patiently waited for our turn... Only to see him put those drinks on a serving tray and disappear.... We looked at each other, because he walked right by us without a word. After a couple of minutes we went to the front desk of the hotel which isn't too far away from the bar, and asked if the bar was open. They said yes, but that there was a happy hour by the pool bar on the roof and we should head up there if we wanted to buy drinks. We took the elevator to the rooftop looking for the bartender/waiter, but he was nowhere to be found. We did see 3 or 4 people with drinks, and then who shows up? The female waitress from earlier. I ask female waitress from hell if the bar is open, to which she replies ""the bar is closed up here, but the bar downstairs is open"" to which I ramble something to the sound of ""but they told me downstairs that the bar on the rooftop was open"" She shrugs her shoulders and shakes her head while repeating ""downstairs...""

We headed back ""downstairs"" and there was no one at the bar. No bartender, not a soul. After a couple of minutes he shows up (the same guy that ignored us before) and tells us he will take care of us after he prepares a drink someone else ordered. It takes him what felt like forever to prepare that drink, another five minutes to deliver it, and about 30 - 40 minutes after we arrived at an empty bar, we finally were able to order.
We decided to eat from the restaurant and the food was overpriced and uneventful. The cheeseburger bread was old and dry, and the service was slow and graceless.

Barring that experience, the rest of the hotel was a great place to stay.... But how can you detach their bar/restaurant terrible service from the rest of the place? It all becomes one experience to me.",4,2019,02,10
34,"Wonderful neighborhood; helpful staff, pricey.","If you're a walker and love investigating the city, this is a brilliant location.  But while there is nothing ""wrong"" with the Wittmore, we found the rooms small, DARK, crowded and expensive (as is their food).  Staff were very very good, helpful, always on hand.  But in an effort to (perhaps) be ""clubby"" it crosses over to ""dreary"" -- especially the guest hallways and rooms -- where it was a real effort to read.  One of our party had a suite and even that was a tight fit.  Lovely atmosphere overall, and especially if you're on an expense account.  We're retired and aren't so would probably select another hotel next time we visit Barcelona.",4,2019,02,07
34,Perfect in every way,"I loved every minute of our trip to Barcelona with a lot of the credit going to the incredible staff that gave us excellent recommendations on everything from where to eat, shop and sightsee every day. The Hotel is spotless and the food at breakfast and waitstaff that served us were perfect. The decor has so many tasteful objects to enjoy while your relaxing there and the quality of the towels and linens are fantastic. We needed help sending things back to the States and long after we left they still helped us with a problem we had and solved it for us. We are so so grateful.I can't wait to go back.",5,2019,01,22
34,Unbelievable experience,"The Wittmore Hotel was simply breathtaking. My husband and I have traveled all over the world but I can say without a doubt that this is my favorite hotel of all time

It has perfect ambiance with darkly lit rooms and crystal glassware. Our bedroom and bathroom opened to the gorgeous vertical garden in the courtyard. The rooftop bar and pool was a great place to relax in. Located down a quiet alley in the Gothic Quarter with easy access to all of Barcelona's major sights, you had no idea what a treasure awaited you. 

Luigi, the concierge, was unbelievable in giving us great recommendations for dinner and drinks (one time even walking us himself to an unbelievable tapas restaurant around the corner) 

The Wittmore Hotel is a true gem of a hotel and I will without a doubt always return there when coming back to Barcelona.",5,2019,01,21
34,Gorgeous hotel & Rooftop,"Hands down the best hotel with rooftop we have stayed at! The hotel itself is very well decorated and shi-shi, as you would expect the resturant and room amenities are a bit over priced but doesn’t matter because you are in the heart of the city with everything you need at your doorstep. And a phenomenal rooftop to relax on after a long day eating and exploring!",4,2019,01,02
34,Excellent location and staff,"I did a TON of research to find what I thought might be the best spot for us to stay in during our 4 night stay in BCN. Looked at Soho House, Cotton House, and a few others - to give you a sense of the vibe I like. Picked The Whittmore based on stellar reviews, it's location and because I love boutique hotels and their decor was on point. 
Overall, it was a great stay.
The location is killer - El born is nearby and the Gothic Quarter really is amazing to walk around in and get lost in. Highly recommend this location. 
The library and the bar and really the room too was all very lovely and well done. Loved the vibe of the place.
Staff was great too. We had drinks in the library and service and cocktails were excellent. Thomas, the doorman, was amazing. Very charming, he speaks 5 languages, gave helpful tips and seemed to really enjoy people. He should be promoted - seriously, he's an asset and can add even more to guests in a bigger role.
Areas that were disappointing: the room (we had a Small Plus Balcony although it seems every room has a balcony so not sure why it is in a special category) is very small. Actually, the bathroom was amazing, it was just the room with the bed was very cramped.  
The room didn't have a full length mirror, it didn't have hooks for coats or anything. We were on the 4th floor and did get wafts of food smells occasionally. 

Overall, I wasn't wowed like I thought I would be and the price point was high enough to increase my expectations from the start. It's a lovely place though and the location and the decor/vibe was such that I'd recommend it anyway.",4,2019,01,01
34,Perfect spot in the Barri Gotic,"So, as most tourists probably do, we spent far too long trying to find a place to stay in the Barri Gòtic in Barcelona. In the end, I honestly can’t say exactly why we chose the Wittmore, but regardless, having now completed our trip, we are extremely glad that we did.

The hotel has absolutely everything you could ask for - a perfect location, high quality and well fitted-out rooms and restaurant/bar, and most importantly amazingly friendly and helpful staff. Staff helped with everything from tips for cocktail bars, restaurant bookings, end even transport recommendations to help us get around a strike and demonstration in the Barri Gòtic. 
We had an amazing time in Barcelona, and part of that was due to staying at the Wittmore.  

If you’re reading hundreds of reviews before your trip, and vascillating over your options, I recommend just biting the bullet and booking the Wittmore. ",5,2018,12,23
34,Amazing ,"Staff are wonderful
Room was cosy but very high quality
Overall ambience was sublime
This hotel has it all! A great bar with beautiful staff and background music to soothe away the aches and pains of long Barcelona walks!
My wife and I have had simply the best threw days here!
Every restaurant recommendation from Gabriel and his team was an experience.
Overall one of the best places I have stayed for everything. I travel every week for business so have become very discerning.
Well done Witty! An outstanding stay with outstanding staff... oh yes and they don’t like Real Madrid which makes me feel great too!

",5,2018,11,25
34,Tucked away gem in the Gothic Quarter,"This hotel met our exact taste, located in a wonderful central area near the major attractions Barcelona has to offer.  The room offers premium comfort / amenities at an attractive price.  The hotel staff was friendly and helpful throughout our entire stay recommending authentic local restaurants and experiences.

The room are constructed of high quality materials -- spacious master bath w/ rainfall shower head, premium plush carpet, comfortable bed, and floor to ceiling windows that open to an enclosed patio(great for natural light and outside air).  Be aware that given the dark inner walls of this hotel, the rooms can be very dark but this was never an issue.

We have stayed in boutique hotels all over western Europe and this was among the best in terms of quality to value.  Hats off to the management and staff, this hotel deserves 5-star status.  I hope it continues to grow and expand into the neighboring buildings.",5,2018,11,18
34,Best hotel ever!,"We found this hotel by chance without any recommendation and what a surprise.
It is tucked away right in the middle of the Gothic quarter, yet it is super quite.
The decor is outstanding, the included breakfast phantasmic and the location couldn't be better. We never needed a car, everything can be explored by foot.
And the best part was the concierge. All the guys on the front desk were so incredibly helpful and had the best recommendations, specially what food was concerned. We liked to stay away from the obvious touristy spots and they totally understood sending us to the local, lesser known places. I must have gained 10 pounds, because every restaurant was extraordinary. The hotel is truly an old style boutique hotel, run by very hip and young people, who know the city well. The rooms and beds are super comfortable. We will come back here whenever we go to Barcelona next.",5,2018,11,02
34,"Perfect location, perfect property, perfect stay","I felt compelled to write a review because our experience from start to finish at the Wittmore was perfection. It is a beautiful property, and in a great location to explore the city. We were greeted by Gabriel who showed us around and helped us get settled. He also made some suggestions for lunch nearby. Our first evening we enjoyed dinner at the hotel (Witty) and despite our first impression of the menu being quite odd (very creative appetizers and seemingly limited and straighforward entrees) it was an incredible meal. Do not let the menu deceive you, you must have at least one meal here! We also had breakfast the next day which was equally excellent. The rooftop pool and lounge area was gorgeous (it's higher up that most buildings so you get a great view), and the room was comfortable and lux. I would agree that the rooms feel small - we had a large and I could not imagine smaller for 2 people - however we really didn't spend much time there and the beautiful design elements made up for the small size. We'd absolutely return to this hotel if we ever have the pleasure of visiting Barcelona again.",5,2018,10,22
34,top class and classic,"We booked the Wittmore as a special birthday celebration in a very vibrant, culturally aware city that we once lived in. The Wittmore  more than lived up to its reputation for first class, extremely personable staff, every touch excellent. The rooftop pool, service, mini bar and snack quality, the perfect touch. Hats off to Gabriel, Eugenia and Elena for making our holiday stay and birthday return to the magic city, top class.",5,2018,10,09
34,Decor & Ambience perfect! Service - wow!,"We are staying 5 nights in this hotel in the Gothic quarters. What a location!  Rooms are perfectly set with so much high end stuff!  Everything down to the Qtips provided are high end. Breakfast was included and so fresh.  Service by every single person was superb.  Rooftop lounge has spectacular 360 degree views of Barcelona. 

Bed is super comfortable.  Bathroom was super clean and everything is new.  Minibar is nicely stocked.  

We will definitely come back.  ",5,2018,10,07
34,We've never been more comfortable,"Our stay at the Wittmore was perfect from start to finish. Luigi and his staff were most gracious and helpful. The entire facility is very tastefully decorated and in pristine condition ... and the location is right where you want to be in Barcelona. The rooftop lounge is like entering another world of serence peace and quiet! The entire city of Barcelona is special, but the Wittmore does it proud!",5,2018,10,02
34,Loved this Hotel!,"Great design, impeccably clean and quiet.  The best part was the outstanding service from the entire staff!  The rooftop views are not to be missed. The breakfasts are served in a lovely courtyard with a beautiful green wall.  The perfect central location for our first visit to Barcelona.",5,2018,10,02
34,A bonafide 5 star experience,"I've had the opportunity to stay at various ""5 star"" properties for business and pleasure, but I can't recall receiving this level of service.  The staff is genuinely concerned with every facet of their guests' happiness.  We went for a slightly upgraded room so I think it may have been a little larger than the standard rooms, and it was fantastic.  This is what a boutique hotel is supposed to be.",5,2018,09,29
34,Elegant Boutique Hotel,This hotel is great for couples. The staff was always attentive and helpful and this was clearly one of the upper end hotels in the area with a lower price tag than you may think. Rooms were designed well and while not huge the space was smart. Huge bathroom and shower!!,5,2018,09,26
34,We stayed for five nights in August 2018.,"We loved our stay. It is a great central location, with friendly and helpful staff. They decor and feel is very stylish.  Our initial room wasn’t to our expectations but they happily changed us to another that was roomy, bright and quiet - perfect. There website doesn’t make it easy to choose a room as it is a little low on detail which I think is part of their mysterious positioning. We would happily stay again and recommend to friends.",4,2018,09,20
34,Unique property with exquisite attention to detail.,"This was the last hotel of four during a two week trip to Spain, and by far the best. The property is in an ideal location in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter, but you won't want to leave the hotel! The rooms are large and well appointed, the roof top pool is extremely relaxing, and the lounge/restaurant is both cozy and romantic. Could not be happier with this experience.",5,2018,09,17
34,Just amazing ,"Lovely hotel with a lot of style, many decorative elements and features thought through in detail. Somewhat hidden away and yet at the heart of Barcelona, perfectly located. Bed was top class, lovely bathroom. The roof terrace offers views over the town second to none,, whilst being a harbor of peace with the pulsing life downstairs in front of the door.
Most importantly, very personal and personalized reception by the excellent and always helpful staff who keep the guests a priority at all times. 
A hidden gem and definitely a place to return to.",5,2018,09,10
34,Excellent Location!,"Wonderful service, fantastic views from the rooftop, and overall calm and wonderful atmosphere amidst the city. Our room overlooked the interior vertical garden which was nice and quiet. The location was great as most everything was in walking distance.
Only two areas I would suggest for improvement- the rooms are very dark and could use better lighting. And they require you to leave your room key at the front desk when leaving the hotel. Would prefer to come and go without stopping at the desk each time.",5,2018,09,05
34,Outstanding ,"This is a very special place. The Wittmore is right in the middle of the historic beauty and mystique of the Gothic Quarter walking distance to great restaurants and tourist attractions. However, what makes this hotel is the service and the front desk staff, which are world class and second to none. The concierge and front desk staff take the time to get to know you and anticipate what you might want whether it's an item for the room, a booking at a tourist attraction or a reservation at the best tapas place in town. Luis, Luigi and Berta were particularly outstanding and went above and beyond at every junction to be helpful and professional. Every time we would come back from a restaurant recommended by one of them, they would take the time to ask what we liked and didn't like and were ready with another recommendation and reservation (incorporating our feedback) the following morning for dinner that next night. We've stayed at a lot of top notch hotels and this was one of the best luxury hotel experiences we've had in any city in the world.

34,Love this place!!,"Difficult to find at first but WELL WORTH IT!!! Great location in the Gothic Quarter, impeccable service, excellent restaurant and rooftop terrace!! Rooms are a little tight but not unusual for a boutique hotel in an old part of town. Love all the details in the hotel and room.",5,2018,09,02
34,"Great Hotel , gorguys boutique hotel , close to everything","Great hotel, beautiful room, close to everything .
Ideal for couples I would say ...... great décor , nice people , I really enjoyed it . 
The breakfast was simple but really good and the terrace upstairs is great to chill.
The only thing is that they should put a bartender in the terrace and make cocktails because it was super limited , and also maybe change the music constantly instead of listening to the same CD all day . But the hotel was amazing",5,2018,08,29
34,Cannot go wrong!! Fantastic!,"This is a little oasis in the middle of the Gothic Area, not suitable to all budgets, but for us it was perfect! 

The music sets off a truly old world charm, charming staff. We had 5 nights here and loved it. If back in Barcelona we will 100% stay her again.

In August, spend some time on the rooftop watching the sunset, listen to the Bell Towers and seabirds that set up another great evening of local culinary delights which is all right at your doorstep.",5,2018,08,23
34,The Jewel of Barcelona,"The Wittmore is unequivocally the best boutique hotel anywhere. Down a small alley in the gritty Gotik district, you come to an oasis of warm sophistication. Decor, restaurant, staff are all brilliant.",5,2018,08,19
34,Only the smell just outside is extraordinary,"This Hotel trully does it. The staff is superfriendly And helpful, the location is perfect, the pool And bar on the rooftop make you feel like a moviestar (No need for visiting the dirty beach). Rooms are always tidy, they make up the beds twice a day, always fresh towels (also on the rooftop)...But that smell...hmmm delicious. Everywhere in the building, even in the elevator, it smells really Nice. Please stay here if you’re planning to stay in Barcelona",5,2018,08,19
34,One of my favorites ,"We’re a couple in our early 30s from NYC and absolutely loved this hotel. It’s a little hard to find, in an obscure corner in the gothic district but worth every penny! The bed was incredibly comfortable, room spotlessly clean, shower and amenities luxurious. Ready to go back ASAP!",5,2018,08,13
34,Jen Crayner,"We had a wonderful time in Barcelona and our stay at The Wittmore was great!  The staff was most gracious and spoke English, because our Spanish was most horrific I’m sure (haha) .....we were always greeted at the door and upon entering the courtyard/bar area!  The rooms were quite comfortable and fully equipped, especially the minibar!!!!  The rooftop area is a must and we spent most early evenings enjoying the city views with cocktails.  I highly recommend staying at The Wittmore when you visit Barcelona!!!",5,2018,08,13
34,Wonderful stay at The Wittmore Hotel,"We recently took our Honeymoon trip to Barcelona and stayed at the hotel.  From the moment we walked in until the moment we checked out, we experienced first class treatment.  The front desk staff was more than accommodating, and the rooms were so charming with a gorgeous view of the vine wall and cafe downstairs.  The location was perfect for exploring the Gothic Districts quaint restaurants, shop,and bars.  We enjoyed an afternoon at the rooftop pool which included food & beverage service and on our last night we had a candlelit dinner in the restaurant downstairs-AMAZING Meal!  Truly magical for our special honeymoon and we will certainly stay again when we return to Spain!!",5,2018,07,31
34,"Well-hidden, but worth the search!","This is a truly marvelous hotel from bottom to top - every aspect from the booking to the checkout was handled in the most professional and courteous way possible. 

Where do I start?... I think perhaps the most important thing for first-time visitors to Barcelona to know is this: taxi drivers generally do not know the Gothic Quarter, and when you give them ""The Wittmore"" as your destination, you might not actually wind up there! Communicate with the driver... make sure he knows where he's going before you leave the train station or airport. Three trips to Barcelona, and each time, the taxi driver didn't know where the hotel was! In their defense, the Wittmore is well-hidden, even for the Gothic Quarter. It is at the end of a blind alley, and unmarked until you are literally standing in front of the hotel. My best advice: enlist the Wittmore staff to help with your ground transportation to the hotel.

The Wittmore is a boutique hotel in the fullest sense of the term. It is small, but punches well above its weight in service and facilities. The restaurant is excellent, with a varied menu that will suit most tastes. I particularly liked the Russian Salad, and the Roasted Coquelet. The bar serves up a wide variety of unique and tasty drinks. I discovered the Claridge at the Wittmore; it was served in a coupe, and really well done. Ditto for their Negroni and the Sazerac. 

If you want to lie in the sun and relax, the Wittmore has a rooftop pool and bar; there's also an observation deck slightly above the rooftop that offers stunning views of Barcelona. It's a particularly nice place to relax and enjoy a cocktail in the early evening. 

The rooms are spotlessly clean and modern with touches that speak to the care taken by the hotelier and his designer/decorator. They are a bit on the small side (mine was 22 sq m), but who goes to Barcelona to lounge in a hotel room? However, if that's your thing, there are suites available. 

I'll close by praising the staff. I really can't say enough; they are individually, and collectively, the best I have encountered.",5,2018,07,23
34,Lovely and private,"Lovely boutique hotel. The hotel is very well located in a beautiful and authentic neighborhood, with cute small streets and alleyways, but also a short walking distance from the beach.
The people working at the hotel are very nice and very helpful.
The rooms are beautiful, we had the two biggest rooms.
Roof terrace and restaurant with patio very cute and very well decorated.
I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone visiting Barcelona. I felt very much at home thanks to the ambiance and the people.",5,2018,07,15
34,Blissful Experience,The hotel staff are outstanding and everyone goes out of their way to be helpful.  The rooms are beautiful and quiet and cool.  The lounge downstairs is a nice place to have a drink and the roof has a beautiful view. Did I mention the location is perfect?  Put this hotel at the top of your list for Barcelona!,5,2018,07,10
34,A hidden gem,"Spectacular hotel!  Hidden down an unassuming alley way, this hotel is a breathtaking oasis.  Rooms were beautiful, food was outstanding but best of all the staff goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome and assist with your every need.  This is the gold star that all hotels should measure themselves against.  We will definitely go back.",5,2018,07,05
34,Magical hidden luxury boutique hotel located in the heart of the city!,"Magical hidden luxury boutique hotel located in the Gothic quarter of Barcelona. Quiet and secluded, this incredibly stylish option is set in an incredible location, steps away from all the sights you'd want to see and visit in the city. 

On previous visits to Barcelona, we have always stayed at the Grand Central Hotel for its location, amenities and service...but now this is our new favourite! 

The staff were extremely professional, courteous, and take their jobs seriously. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by a male staff member who was super enthusiastic and showed us around the hotel.  He pointed out all the design details (we are fans of good design) such as the Italian made key chains, the bathroom, the art deco sconces, the old school ""modern"" rotary phone and the ""made for the Wittmore"" cocktails in a bottle. 

We loved the decor and the attention to detail.  The interior is warm, luxurious and welcoming. No detail has been overlooked.  The shower was incredible (we loved the tile work and the water pressure) and was just what we needed after a long flight.  
The rooftop swimming pool is more like a wading pool.  But the 360 degree rooftop terrace views of the city more than make up for it!!!

The room was on the smaller side, but based on our extensive travel experience, it's a typical European room size. It was no smaller than rooms we have stayed at in Milan and Paris.  It was definitely workable.  

The Wittmore is worth every penny for the level of service, decor, and amenities it provides. FIVE STAR service, and a FIVE STAR HOTEL. Stay here if you can. We will definitely stay here on our return trip to Barcelona.",5,2018,07,03
34,Cool & classy,"Beautiful bolt hole to explore the city, fantastic staff who couldn't do enough for you; small & perfectly formed hotel - we had the courtyard restaurant to ourselves on the first night and the roof terrace was occasionally busy but never crowded, all residents only.",5,2018,06,29
34,"Flawless, absolutely flawless!","Absolutely flawless - attention to detail unsurpassed, service perfect, suite stunning, food delicious, cocktails inventive and I can honestly say I have never said that about a hotel.  Location is truly quirky but this only adds to the charm.  You feel part of a very select club who have access to The Wittmore.  Go and stay in this hotel!!",5,2018,06,28
34,Fantastic hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"Love this hotel and will go back again...and again!  We even booked the “tiny room” which is accurately described but we were there for one day and two nights and it was superb.  Bathroom was large and it was quiet with a very comfortable bed and layout.  Rooftop bar is fantastic and the staff are amazingly helpful and eager to attend to your needs and eclectic requests.  

Because the Gothic Quarter is a warren of narrow alleys and streets, this one is best reached by taxi but if you have to, just go to the main post office in the quarter and it’s two blocs or so from there.  Great location to walk and see the sights in this historic area which also has some of the great boutique shopping areas.  Do stay in the Gothic Quarter if you are traveling for pleasure and The Whitmore is 5-star level.  Romantic for couples...top pick!",5,2018,06,24
34,Great stay! ,"The Wittmore was our first stop on our honeymoon and we had an amazing time there. The room, the breakfast, the rooftop and the bar were all fantastic. It had a great relaxed vibe and we’ll definitely stay there again when in Barcelona. 

Our only minor suggestion would be to make the lighting in the rooms a bit brighter. 

",5,2018,06,16
34,This is where you need to stay...,"I know, you’re probably vacillating in relation to a number of Barcelona hotels in this category as I was - Soho House, Mercer, Casa Camper etc - but I’m really glad I chose to stay here.

I was after a classy, but understated, boutique getaway and the property delivered in spades: twenty something rooms, fantastic bar and uncrowded rooftop (and vista), turndown - at the right time - and superlative, unobtrusive service. 

If you’re a couple, which I wasn’t for most of my stay, I’d recommend a Small Plus or above.

Gianluigi, the concierge, has the charm of Cary Grant. But not American, thankfully.

I’m a jaded 40 something year old lawyer, so if I’m gushing, you know it’s good. I’ll be back!",5,2018,06,16
34,First Class Boutique Hotel,"The Wittmore provides a wonderful experience if you like boutique hotels. Service is without equal. Staff is well trained, very friendly and helpful. Rooms are spacious and well appointed. We enjoyed dining at the hotel for both breakfast and dinner. The only downside is that the hotel is difficult to find and difficult to access by taxi as it is nestled in a side street in the gothic quarter. I would suggest that you arrange for the hotel to arrange a pick up for you at the airport with taxis familiar with the location. However, location is ideal for exploring the city and especially the old town. ",5,2018,06,07
34,Great place to stay,"We had to extend our stay in Barcelona at the last minute and decided to try the Wittmore after reading other reviews.

We were not disappointed.

The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the room was perfect.

The hotel is very quite and the rooms are well appointed.

We had a perfect breakfast on the day of departure and then we regretted not staying in the hotel for dinner on the night before.

On check out we were running late and the concierge went to extreme lengths to secure a taxi for us which was appreciated. 

We would definitely stay again.",5,2018,06,04
34,"Cute, Quiet, Customer Service Supreme","We stayed here to start our Spanish vacation for a couple nights, then returned a couple weeks later for our final night and couldn't have asked for a better experience! Upon our return to end our trip, they remembered us and were very helpful with any and every request we had for them.

The location is awesome as you can easily walk to the waterfront, the shopping district, tapas is everywhere and it's a short distance to all the wonderful historic places in Barcelona.

The only precautionary note I would add is that if you have mobility issues of any kind, you will likely have to walk the cobblestone streets for a couple short blocks as you can't get a car/taxi to their door. If you don't mind a short walk with your luggage, it is more than worth it!",5,2018,05,31
34,"Staff, Room, Location",Great small hotel in a convenient location.  Staff is consistently helpful and friendly.  Rooms are well equipped and very quiet.  Bed is quite comfortable.  Marshall Bluetooth speaker in the room and good WiFi throughout. Breakfast is also good and well priced for the surrounding area.  ,5,2018,05,31
34,Nice but to dark in the hotel,"I have just stayed last week,
The hotel is hard to find, and on entering it,I thought I was in a 60’s night club.
It is very dark inside,hard to see even in reception,
If you are offered a room that’s called TINY, it lives up to its name,not a room for 2 people.its very cramped little wardrobe space, no mirrors in the bedroom,
And again the lighting is so dark, only daylight comes from doors that open onto the courtyard below,
The bathroom again is very badly lit,impossible to see,only 1hand basin,
We had to use our phones to see when we entered the room,couldn’t see the lock.
I couldn’t fault the staff ,who were great ,very charming and helpful,
The best part of the hotel is the roof terrace,(probably because there is natural daylight)
They should turn this into the restaurant where you can eat breakfast,as the courtyard is a bit depressing,not like the pictures on the site.
The location is not central,long way from sites,and shops,and taxis are expensive.
Although is is near Los Ramblas,
Don’t eat on Ramblas,it’s expensive and the food is very touristy,not good
We found some little local places,near the hotel,and the food was excellent and reasonably priced (go where the locals eat.
I wouldn’t go back to The Wittmore,based on the lighting and the crammed rooms",2,2018,05,26
34,Comfortable Boutique Hotel in Great Location,"A great, intimate hotel, off the beaten track - away from ""tourist central.""
Our XL room was very good, staff friendly and helpful. The roof area is great, peaceful place to relax at day or in the evening and the central atrium lounge areas is extremely comfortable and welcoming. Recommended.

A small point to note is that taxi drivers don't seem to like coming along the narrow lanes too much, so allow extra time if you're booking one - or just order it for the end of the road behind the post office building.

Some have said the rooms are too dark but we found them to be fine. They are certainly not brightly lit but it was not an issue - there's plenty of light on the bathroom for getting ready to go out. The only time it became a little difficult was seeing inside the room safe, you need to use your 'phone torch to see properly.",5,2018,05,18
34,Fabulous Boutique Hotel With Charm and Great Service,"I would definitely stay here again for the following reasons:  cleanliness, comfortable bed, air conditioning, location is interesting in the heart of the gothic district, uniqueness in style, bathroom amenities are plentiful (there is everything from condoms to small wooden comb), quietness (inside room facing the beautiful living plant wall garden), ADULTS only meant it was quiet without hearing any children running in the halls). 

I wouldn’t stay here if:  you have mobility issues (rooms are small) and you have to park a block or so from main entrance - although not an issue for us and added to the charm I don’t think that’s attractive if you are elderly and have a hard time walking.   Also if you don’t like dim settings don’t stay here. The hallways , rooms, and stairwells are dark!  I almost missed a few steps a few times as the lighting makes it almost impossible to see the stairs until your eyes adjust to the light.  Also if you are expecting a warm large pool - it isn’t- more of a refreshing foot bath but the rooftop lounge is comfortable and interesting views of the panoramic 360 degree views - great place to chill out if weather is cooperating (strange that they closed it one day as it was raining earlier and they didn’t reopen it - I would have loved to sit outside in the crisp fresh air - but was told rooftop was now closed - thought that was unusual and the guy didn’t know if they would reopen it- no further rain was forecasted.    Also no short shorts (or athletic wear) are allowed in the eating areas - prices is bar on the higher side but there are great tapa places within walking distance.   

However, I would totally stay here again if you love interesting, clean, quiet, smaller boutique hotels and you aren’t expecting the run of the mill Westin or Four Seasons 

Five star in my books but due to some of its unique quirks others may not appreciate the individuality.   

Thank you for the great stay!",4,2018,05,13
34,Meh,"Just ok - not five star hospitality, but good location 

Pros: great location tucked in an alley of the gothic quarter, rooms are modern with good furniture/bathrooms/toiletries/robes/hallways, hip ‘nyc’ vibe 

Cons: loud music from the courtyard can be heard on all floors late into night (not for light sleepers), we tried to go to the bar two different days and were told they were booked (usually hotels have room for guests and at a minimum they should have gotten us in the second night), staff friendly but not particularly attentive or helpful",3,2018,05,12
34,Lovely hotel,"We enjoyed 1 night at The Wittmore Hotel.  Sure which we could have stayed longer.  We arrived at the hotel at 9am (check in is much later) and they were very accommodating (we emailed and said we'd hoped for early check in)  - offering a room upgrade and to spend time in the pool area.  

The service is outstanding--from the welcoming doorman to the front desk to the waitress at the restaurant!  The room was lovely and the sheets were to die for (I'd like to know where they purchased them).  My only (tiny) complaint is that it is very dark in the hallways and the room.",5,2018,04,29
34,Distinctly Unique Hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"Stayed at the Wittmore for 2 nights and absolutely loved every moment of our stay here.
The Wittmore is tucked away in the Gothic Quarter which only adds to its charm.
The service is first class all the way and the property is stunningly beautiful.
The rooms all face a very pleasant interior courtyard and the black/red color color combinations give the hotel a very unique and romantic feel. Service from all the staff was awesome, particularly Luigi and Tomas. It’s a small intimate property and they really make you feel at home and are always available for recommendations for seeing this incredible city.
I would absolutely recommend this property and can’t wait to come back for a longer stay next time.",5,2018,04,27
34,A real gem in the heart of Barcelonas Gothic Area,"We stayed in the 3rd week of April. The hotel is hidden down a blind alley which in itself says something about exclusive feel of the place. The vibe of the hotel is relaxed, cool, chilled out and sumptuous. Velvet curtains separate areas and there's lots of wood floor and rugs. 

There's a lovely central atrium with flowers growing up one wall - all rooms face this way. 
The room we stayed in (204) was delightful. Always smelling gorgeous every time we returned, beautifully smooth cotton bed linen, large walk in shower, really nice complimentary products. Possibly the best mini bar I have seen!

The sun terrace on the roof is perfect. Large sun loungers, small pool to dip your toes in, bar, all day menu with some lovely dishes on as well as your basics like burgers and fries. 

The staff were very friendly without exception and tried really hard to make sure that everything was perfect for your stay, Reception booked trips for us and offered advice. 
There were a few minor errors throughout our stay with drinks and breakfast orders but nothing that wasn't sorted straight away. Overall very professional.

Restaurant food was limited in menu choice but all excellent. The Silencis white wine is a very nice dry white. 

What more can I say - it was very nearly perfect!

One note for the owners - can I suggest increasing the lighting in the stairways, particularly on the lower couple of floors? It is really very dark and we and another guest did have minor falls.

However, this didn't blight our short break and would highly recommend this place.",5,2018,04,19
34,Private luxury and very cosy!,"The Wittmore suite is excellent “Room 501” the most comfortable bed and relaxing lounge area. The staff are very helpful and speak excellent English and very welcoming. 

If we had to find faults the breakfast was disappointing, presentation immaculate but  food was cold and you left hungry and hap hazard, but we found this was the case throughout Barcelona restaurants. 

The main highlight is that it is adult only and very smart interiors, located up a small side road (google maps 100% needed) all the room windows faced into a centre garden none looking into the streets making it feel like you could be anywhere. 

We would recommend to everyone and when we visit Barcelona again we will be staying here. ",5,2018,04,02
34,Escape to relaxation ,"From the moment you walk up the small street to the door and in to the lobby you start to feel this will be special...and it is ! Everything is compact, and that’s part of the charm. Rooms very comfortable, and absolutely quiet - we were on the second floor and when we opened the windows we got the fresh air and the music and voices from the courtyard which was great, and once they were closed it was an oasis of calm. We didn’t eat dinner but breakfast was good; it’s a limited menu but you don’t need more. Location made walking everywhere in the evening very easy. Staff all very helpful, making it a very welcoming place to stay. ",4,2018,03,25
34,NO ACCESS DUE TO MAINTENANCE,"I booked a suite at The Wittmore for one night at the cost of just over £700. This price was extremely high in comparison to most other hotels in the vicinity. We viewed the hotel a day prior to our arrival to ensure everything was organised. We were shown the roof top pool, bar and terrace, as this was the reason for us booking such a high priced hotel in this location. However the following day, we went to access the rooftop to be told that it was all closed due maintenance. Pretty unbelievable as we had been assured barely 24 hours prior, that all was fine to use. We were unable to access the bar, terrace and pool areas at all during our stay. Our original complaint was completely ignored. We had to contact the hotel manager & Expedia several times to attempt to rectify the situation and to either move hotels or be discounted on the huge amount paid but the hotel and it’s unbelievably rude owner Narcis [-] adamantly refused to do anything. Mr [-] actually rang our room three times as we attempted to sleep arguing aggressively that his hotel needs maintenance and how dare we complain. He was extremely rude and highly inappropriate. He should have closed the hotel or like many other hotels warned potential visitors and offered discounted rooms. This man has the worst idea of customer service I have ever seen in my life. This was an extremely small hotel, a terrible rip off of the Soho House that is located just down the road. I highly recommend staying there (Soho House) instead if you are looking for a hotel with amazing outdoor space and a roof top. 

It is safe to say we will not be coming back to The Whittmore any time soon.",1,2018,03,18
34,Fabulous for a city break,My husband and I spent a fabulous few days in Barcelona staying at the Whitmore. It is almost disconcertingly British but undeniably classy and the service excellent. We visited in early March so it was a bit chilly to take advantage of the delightful courtyard but I would imagine it would be a little oasis on a warm Barcelona day. The rooms are compact but perfect for a city break. Our room was spotless and the bed was wonderfully comfortable. The bathroom well laid out with good toiletries provided and plentiful big fluffy towels and gorgeous robes. We only had breakfast in the hotel once but it was very well cooked. I would however recommend walking 30yards round the corner to Milk for a truly stunning brunch. The staff at the Whitmore couldn’t have been more helpful and charming. They gave excellent restaurant recommendations and were all delightful. We will return! ,5,2018,03,15
34,Perfect Honeymoon Hotel - I'd give it 10 stars if I could,"My husband and I stayed at the Wittmore on our honeymoon to Barcelona and cannot recommend it highly enough! It was absolutely perfect.  I did so much research to find a romantic hotel that had some charm, and this place really delivered.  It's located on a quiet street in the Gothic Quarter and boasts a gorgeous interior with a British flair. 

The staff at the Wittmore is absolutely top-notch, offering us recommendations, directions, and even an umbrella on days when rain was in the forecast.  In fact, one night we got the munchies at about 1 a.m. and when we went downstairs to ask if there were any 24/7 convenience stores nearby, the nighttime doorman (who by the way is a very talented artist with a gallery just down the street) didn't even hesitate to offer to escort us to the nearest one! 

The rooms are beautiful with great amenities. They are not spacious (we stayed in one of the ""small"" rooms) but we had enough room to feel comfortable for our long stay. 
The bed was really comfortable and the shower was big with excellent water pressure. We loved opening our french doors to the pretty interior courtyard, and it was nice to fall asleep to the live jazz they had in the lounge a couple of nights. On several evenings we ended our night in the hotel's cozy lounge to split a bottle of wine or have a few cocktails in front of the fireplace - very romantic. 

We had planned to only stay at the Wittmore for the first few days of our trip as a ""splurge"", but loved it so much that we stayed the entire 10 days. It was expensive for us, but it was well worth it. I would recommend the Wittmore to anyone and everyone.  Thank you for making our honeymoon wonderful!",5,2018,03,14
34,Perfection,"My wife and I stayed here on a city break and were quite exited about the “Adults only” tag as this was our first trip abroad minus kids in 14 years.  The hotel is perfectly located right between the Gothic Quarter and the beach, close to the bottom of Las Ramblas and not far from Place Real and all the other fantastic Gothic Quarter buildings and sights.  We took the Aerobus from the airport to Place Catalunya and walked down Las Ramblas (early morning so not too busy) to the hotel and then early Sunday morning, when leaving,  walked back up to Place Catalunya to catch the return bus which was very convenient. The hotel is gorgeous, dark, cozy with mood lighting and the fantastic central courtyard.  Our room was compact but plenty big with a fantastic bathroom and had 3 windows into the central courtyard.  The hotel is very peaceful and restful with no noise from adjoining rooms or above and below (thanks to soft furnishings on walls and floors) and the room is provided with all the extras you need and a super mini bar. The roof area is fantastic with super views of the city.  It was mid Feb so the roof bar was not open and nobody was in the roof paddling pool.  We did not eat in the restaurant but did have a drink on returning late one night in the bar sitting on the comfy couch in front of the fire.  The staff were very attentive and friendly and could not do enough.

There are plenty great bars and restaurants close by on Carrer den Gignas and Carrer Ample that are worth a look and the beach and Marina are only a short walk away.

It is a top quality hotel and perfect for a couple on a city break and if willing to splash out a bit more than normal on a high quality hotel you will not be disappointed by the Wittmore.  We loved it and would return again in a heartbeat.

We took a few photos but will respect the no photo request from the hotel and keep these to ourselves. Those posted on TripAdvisor capture everything you need to get a feel for the hotel.  A real hidden gem in  Barcelona.",5,2018,02,28
34,We got to come back!,"We just love the Wittmore. This time we had our teenage kids with us. (Lots of parental points for such a ""cool"" place to stay, lol.) Gracious service as always. I can highly recommend room 502, a larger room between the two-room suites on the top floor. Lovely and spacious, although the kids though their rooms on lower floors had a better view of the ""plant wall"" in the middle of the hotel!",5,2018,02,26
34,Lovely boutique hotel in the Gothic Quarter with a decidely British air,"My daughter was studying abroad in Barcelona and I came to visit. Based on good reviews, I booked the Wittmore. Not the easiest to find in a tiny corner of the Gothic Quarter, but well worth the effort. A delightful visit from start to finish. Beautiful, lots of dark wood, thoughtfully designed, warm furnishings, all of the amenities, bountiful mini bar, nicely appointed bathroom, heavenly mattress and pillows, lovely restaurant with very good food, welcoming, knowledgeable and very helpful staff (all of whom speak impeccable English). I will definitely return.",5,2018,02,24
34,Cancelled as I didn't accept tripling of price,"I had a very disappointing experience with Wittmore. I booked my room to attend the MWC in Barcelona long time ago via Hotel.com. After half a year Wittmore started to send me messages saying that the prices were wrong due to a system error, and now they had trippled for the period, and they asked if I would accept this. I wouldn't and told them so. I also informed Hotels.com, who came back and said (wrote) that the booking was perfectly fine as they had talk to Wittmore. On that background I cancelled my backup booking. And then yesterday Wittmore wrties and tells me that they have now cancelled my booking as I didn't accept the tripled price. I engaged Hotels.com, but they just came back and didn't want to help out ... but said ""We appreciate your kind understanding regarding this matter."" The same happened a couple of years ago in Barcelona. I have now cancelled all my bookings with Hotels.com ... they are not of much help when needed. I will book a replacement with another site ... or opt for AirBnB.",1,2018,02,13
34,Unique experience in Barcelona!,"We had the most amazing time at the Wittmore in Barcelona. This hotel boutique has a unique elegant style, is romantic, warming and welcoming. All the staff is very polite and helpful, wanting the guests to have the best stay. The location could't be better: in the heart of the Gothic neighborhood, with its small old charming streets full of historic places, tapas' restaurants and shops. I would come back at any time!",5,2018,02,11
34,Amazing winter hotel!,"I love places like this and the Wittmore truly lived up to expectations. Hidden in an alley in the gothic quarter, the hotel has a decadent ambience with an air of secrecy to it as if you've stumbled upon a hidden treasure! The service was wonderful. I had a glass of wine and the ham croqueutas (which were amazing) at the fire place! This is probably the best thing about the hotel at winter. I didn't pay a visit to the rooftop but I heard it's wonderful. The rooms are spacious and I loved the little truffles placed by my bedside in the evening after I returned from dinner. Will definitely be recommending it to friends and family!",5,2018,02,02
34,Poor service at reception,"I visited the hotel as I was hoping to book a large number of guests in to the hotel in early Spring.
As the booking was for a wedding party I really wanted to have a look at the roof terrace. I was told by a rather surly male receptionist that the terrace was only open to staying guests. I explained that I was hoping to make a booking for friends later in the year and could I just pop up and have a quick look with a member of staff. I was told in no uncertain terms that I would not be allowed to look at the roof as I may be spotted on CCTV and I was not currently a staying guest.
Consequently I will not be booking this hotel for my wedding guests due to the attitude and unhelpful ness of the reception staff.
Needless to say I was disappointed and offended to say the least.",1,2018,01,31
34,Simple Luxry,"We booked The Wittmore for a week in January, admittedly it is a bit tricky to find the first time, nestled in one of the many streets of the Gothic Quarter. Our taxi driver had no problem finding it though. Right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the Gothic Quarter is a little quiet sanctuary. This is the true boutique experience, only 22 rooms, no children, no pets. What more could a couple on a European getaway ask for. The rooms are tastefully decorated, with a real old world touch. The staff are as good if not better than any I cave encountered anywhere in the world. Friendly and attentive without being over bearing. The restaurant and bar downstairs have a good range of wine and beer. The one meal we had there was excellent.

The highlight for me was the coffee. The Italian waiter who's name I regrettably forget made an excellent flat white.

The Wittmore for us was the perfect hotel, compared to the others we stayed in Munich and Paris on our trip this was head and shoulders above them all. We will 100% stay here the next time we're in Barcelona.",5,2018,01,17
34,Understated luxury,"We stayed at The Wittmore for a weekend in late November. The hotel was absolutely perfect for us, a couple traveling without children. The Gothic Quarter location is classic Barcelona, and the hotel is quite easily accessible (three blocks from a main road, half a block from a side street), despite being tucked into an alleyway that serves to functionally eliminate street noise. We booked an extra large room and were upgraded to the largest suite, which was big and beautifully appointed, with a huge shower and a very comfortable king bed. The service was impeccable but not intrusive, the restaurant was quite good with a nice bar, and the roof deck was comfortable and had a fantastic view. Perhaps most importantly, the hotel was quiet - no street noise, no noise from other guests, no children allowed - and had a seductive, dimly-lit vibe that harmonized with the Gothic Quarter.",5,2018,01,08
34,The perfect stay in the Gothic neighborhood ,"I had the opportunity to stay at The Wittmore Hotel as solo traveller, on my way to a business meeting, in December 2017. The Wittmore is a simply fantastic boutique hotel characterized by a cosy, elegant atmosphere. The personnel is extremely kind, helpful and friendly. The hotel location - in the very heart of the Gothic neighborhood-ensures calm and silence but at just few minutes walking from The Rambla, Plaza del Rey and the beach. Guests can also enjoy a sundeck with a bohemian view on Barcelona terraces, a small patio with a stunning vertical garden or a comfortable lounge area. I hope to come back to this hidden gem in one of the most vibrant area of Barcelona. ",5,2017,12,22
34,Luxury,"Beautiful and luxury hotel in the heart of barri gotic. Ideal for restaurants, shopping and... rest. It's silence is priceless. Rooms should have a mirror in the wall (the only one is on wc), but that's not a big problem. Great decoration everywere. I'll recomend it to others.",5,2017,12,11
34,Loved my stay ,"We stayed at The Wittmore for 3 nights and it was such an enjoyable stay. I have traveled a lot, what sets this place apart is the service and professionalism. From front desk to the bar, there was not one person that was not helpful and professional. When we arrived the hotel at 11am from a 20 hrs flight the room was ready for us, considering check in time was 3pm this was greatly appreciated. Our luggage didn’t arrive with us and the gentleman at the front desk was so helpful and kept helping us chase the baggage with the airline. The lady at the front desk gave us great reco for tapa bars. They gave us complimentary strawberries with chocolate for our honeymoon which is a nice gesture. They called Taxi for us on the day we were leaving with no issue. The hotel has impeccable taste from the lobby, restaurant bar to the room. Love the decoration and ambience. We stopped by the bar a few times for drinks it’s beautiful. They have an awesome jazz band on thur night be sure to check it out. My only suggestion is like people say, they don’t have mirror in the room. This is very difficult for ladies trying to get ready to go out. However everything else makes up for this. If I return to Barcelona will stay here again! ",5,2017,12,01
34,Mysterious and romantic,"Boutique hotel in gothic quartier, hotel looks amazing, rooms are fantastic, atmosphere top!! Its absolutely Perfect place to bring there your girlfriend. Homely small but very luxurious place,Candles, fireplace, amazing food and wine, darkness and mystery. Make it rock- she will fall in love for sure",5,2017,11,27
34,Great Boutique Hotel ,"The Wittmore hotel is in a perfect location, right in the heart of the Gotic quarter. I love this area with all of the gorgeous architecture, small alleyways and tapas bars. It’s quite hidden away which I think is quite special. Tip: great tapas place called Gourmet Sensi around the corner.

The hotel itself is tiny. Only 22 rooms and very little hotel amenities but it does have a gorgeous restaurant and bar. The hotel is finished to a high standard and has clearly just been renovated so everything feels new and fresh. It’s on the ‘darker’ side of design but I liked that.

Check in was nice with a great doorman who took my bags and brought them to the room. I was given a room on the second floor. Again full of lovely design touches - a huge king bed, beautiful light fixtures, a marble bathroom and a view over the inner courtyard with the walled garden. I was incredibly impressed with the many toiletries available in the room!! 

The downside to the room was the size. I was alone and it felt very tight. There was nowhere to put my suitcase - think I’d struggle a lot if there were 2 people. The hangers in the closet were over the minibar so you couldn’t hang any long coats etc.

I did have one bad experience. Upon check out the clerk - who was friendly - booked me a taxi but it took over 25 minutes and he kept saying it’s coming, it’s coming. I was so late for my flight in the need I had to give up and turns out there were many taxis on the nearby street I could have taken in 2 minutes. I wish he had told me this to avoid the stress of almost losing my flight.

I would stay here again despite the room size and check out issue. ",4,2017,11,26
34,Can't wait to come back,"Lovely, lovely little hotel in a hard-to-find but really great location in the Gothic Quarter. I wish there were other words than charming, lovely, wonderful, to describe our stay. From the front desk to the waiter at the rooftop bar, the everyone was delightful. We had a very quick trip that required some logistics with car pick-ups on a couple of days, and the desk helped us with that seamlessly. We simply can't wait to return.",5,2017,11,22
34,"Hidden, but worth finding","Total first class from front desk to door to room. Add in a delicious dinner in classy restaurant and you’ll get the idea of this place. 
I only briefly made it up to the roof deck since I was there on business - wish I had some relaxation time to soak in sun and have a drink. 
Room was quite comfortable and large enough for the big bed, love seat and table. Wifi worked fine. Nice courtyard view which actually overlooked the restaurant below
I took others’ suggestions and went elsewhere for breakfast (once at Benedict’s around the corner - another must visit!)
Only tricky piece was hailing a cab when needed. Best walking to a main street and locating a sign for cabs",5,2017,11,18
34,Great Stay at The Wittmore,This is a beautiful hotel in the Gothic Quarter.  It has a lot of charm and a very modern yet authentic feel.  The staff were excellent and always helpful.  The location is brilliant and the rooms and decor first class.  Would certainly stay here again. ,5,2017,11,18
34,"Beautiful, friendly and cozy hotel!","Hotel was exceptional! Very friendly and helpful staff, beautiful decor and immaculate!
Would NEVER stay anywhere else in Barcelona!
 Location is superb, as you can walk to all sights- Las Ramblas, Barceloneta, several other neighborhoods, The Mercat, Cathedral! 
The sun deck is amazing for an afternoon cocktail or lunch, as is the all of the amenities. ",5,2017,11,14
34,Hidden Gem in the Gothic quarter,"An absolutely lovely hidden gem boutique hotel located in the Gothic Quarter. I️ wish we could have spent more time there. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom  was modern, clean and luxurious.  Two windows opened to a stunning courtyard below. The walls were covered with vines and flowers and was absolutely beautiful. The staff were professional, pleasant and efficient.  I️ can’t wait to stay here again when back in Barcelona!!! Definitely 5 stars",5,2017,11,08
34,Fantastic hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"This is a wonderful hotel buried deep in the Gothic Quarter. It's very atmospheric, with darkly lit, elegant corridors and rooms - (sometimes the corridors are a bit too dark!). The rooms are a mix of art deco and film noir. With retro pieces that the radio and the phone mixed with very stylish touches. Woke up each morning by Frank Sinatra playing in the bar (a recording not the person) which, if you are a fan, is fantastic. The rooftop bar is very spacious and modern with great views over the city. Highly recommended.",5,2017,11,07
34,"Elegant, sexy, and mysterious!","Let me start by saying this is the first time I have ever felt compelled enough to write an online review about ANYTHING.  This is how strongly I feel about The Wittmore.

We had THE BEST, most amazing stay at The Wittmore during our week in Barcelona. The entire property is beautiful, elegant, sexy, and mysterious! The location of the hotel is perfect.  We loved coming down that tiny alley in the Barri Gotic to ""go home"" at the end of every day. We enjoyed having before-dinner drinks in the hotel lounge in front of the fireplace and we absolutely loved the view from the top top level of the rooftop deck! It got a little cold and windy when we were up there, so someone even brought me a big fluffy towel to wrap around my shoulders.

Our bed was so big and comfortable, and the shower is massive and outstanding. The toiletries were very high end and abundant. Turn down service was perfect and we enjoyed the bottles of water and little treats. Anything we needed was provided - with a smile.

Everyone at The Wittmore was so genuine and helpful, even before we even got to Spain! They were very helpful with setting up dinner reservations, etc. I especially want to say that Javier and Melania were so incredibly friendly and went out of their way to help once we arrived and for our entire stay. I will forever think back on my trip to Barcelona with a fond heart, and The Wittmore is a very very big reason for that. I wish we never had to leave.  Congrats to The Wittmore for being such a memorable, elegant hotel and providing such incomparable service and hospitality.  I will never stay in another hotel in Barcelona.",5,2017,10,28
34,A Gem in the Gothic Quarter,"I can't say enough good things about The Wittmore. We had to walk a block down a narrow road to get to the hotel because it was too narrow for our cab, and that added to its appeal. We were greeted by a professional, kind and helpful staff. They recommended the best restaurants, offered to make reservations and even printed out directions for us.
The hotel itself fits perfect in the Gothic Quarter, the dim lights (which took some getting use to) created the perfect ambience, as did the décor. The room was perfect, toiletries top-notch and the ""rain"" shower was absolutely the best I've ever experienced. 
Rooftop terrace was perfect, I only wish they kept it open later in the fall/winter; we would have loved to have spent more time up there, regardless of the temperature.
Quiet and peaceful and we appreciated that it's an adult only hotel.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to feel pampered in luxury without the hustle/bustle of a big or chain hotel.",5,2017,10,26
34,exceptional,"Hotel was great , rooms very clean and atmospheric . Great breakfast and stuff was very kind and helpfull. Definitely i will recommend it to friends!   Lights were a bit low but you get used to it  quickly",5,2017,10,25
34,Wow!!!!    Amazing experience.  ,"We enjoyed a perfect stay at the Wittmore for 3 nights.   The staff doesn’t miss anything—almost as if they can read your mind.   The customer service is amazing and we enjoyed conversations with the staff.    We were very happy with the concierge staff, front desk, maid, restaurant and bell staff.   They recommend great restaurants, got reservations and provided touring ideas.   One night we came back to our room to find a nice hand-written note from the staff and cake to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday (which was delicious).   

The hotel also kept us appraised of the ongoing protests and their location so we could avoid the crowds.   We felt very safe the entire time in all areas of the city.  

We stayed in a “small” room which was perfect for a couple.  The hotel design/style is very unique and is is very romantic/sexy.  Everything in the room is top-notch, from the hairdryer to the Marshall speaker.  The rooftop bar is amazing and we enjoyed a few hours in the sun on the lounge chairs one afternoon.   

The location is perfect for exploring the city and is surrounded by fantastic restaurants, nightlife  and shopping.  

We highly recommend The Wittmore experience.  Having stayed in several 5-Star hotels, The Wittmore deserves the 5-Star rating for the accommodations and service.   It is much more relaxed than most 5-Star hotels (you won’t find bellman dressed in a suit and a cap or Victorian decor) but don’t let that fool you.  Think 5-Star accommodations and service without the pretentious feeling of similarly ranked properties.  The hotel concept is unique, luxurious, romantic and perfect for us.    

Tip:  bring the address of the hotel with you so the cab can find the hotel.  It is tucked away in the Gothic district, a newer property and not well known by drivers.   The drivers will drop you off a block from the hotel given the narrow roads.   ",5,2017,10,24
34,Lovely Stay,"The location of this hotel is great though it is tucked down a little side street..easy to miss but well worth the visit. The staff were exceptional with their friendliness and service and couldn't do enough for you. They have a l lovely roof top bar which we unfortunately missed out on as it closes at 5pm in the winter but it looked lovely.The room we had was a little small but it didn't matter as the little extras made up for it. It had the best toiletries in the bathroom that I had ever come across in a hotel, the only thing for me missing was tea/coffee making facilities.
Would definately stay here again.",5,2017,10,23
34,Better than the Ritz,"I can’t even begin to tell you how nice this hotel is.   Possibly the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in, and I have stayed at the Ritz.  After a very long 12 day Med cruise it was ecstasy to step into a plush, QUIET luxurious room.   The young lady at check escorted us to our room and explained the lighting options, mini bar, roof top terrace, dining options and robes and slippers.  The silence of this hotel is really noteworthy.  No street noise and beautiful windows overlooking the wall of lush greens.  They do have an evening turn down service where our toiletries were nicely arrange and our slippers were positioned at the side of our bed.  Also some water and clean glasses on the nightstands with a beautiful little dark chocolate truffle.  The feather bed made it almost impossible to get out of in the morning.  But don’t worry the shower was equally impressive with both a rain option or a wand.  Strong water pressure and adjustable temperature in a beautiful glass and marble enclosure.  If I change anything it would be the fire detector on the ceiling above the bed does blink every 10 seconds so bring a sleep mask.   We will definitely stay here again!!!",5,2017,10,18
34,"Great location stylish hotel, and fantastic staff","We spent 5 excellent nights at The Wittmore, which is hidden among some fun alleys in the Gothic Quarter. Our room was very well appointed and generously sized.

The staff went out of their way to take care of us during check-in, check-out, meal-times, and pretty much any time we walked near the front desk. Also, special accolades to the bartenders there who make legitimately excellent cocktails.

We booked a ""Large"" room which was probably more than 2 people needed, but we enjoyed having some extra space.",5,2017,10,14
34,Wonderful Small Hotel with an Outstanding Staff,"This hotel was the 5th luxury hotel my wife and I visited over the past three weeks.  We agreed that this was by far the best of all.  The British style decor seems a little odd in Spain, but we loved it.  The lobby, restaurant, and bar are elegantly done.  The food and drink is great, and is served beautifully by an attentive and caring staff.  Julia and Steph were the best.
The front desk personal handled every request promptly and correctly.
The room was not large but well appointed and very comfortable.
The Wittmore is located in a quaint neighborhood with truly great shopping, restaurants, especially Tapas, and bars.  It is an ""Old World"" gem waiting to be explored, and close to Las Ramblas.",5,2017,10,14
34,Overall poor experience,"We come pretty often to Barcelona as I bought a flat in the beautiful gothic quarter since couple of years. We saw the wittmore hotel construction as it just face our building and were looking forward one day to finally go and enjoy the hotel itself. Was a great deception starting from the high price per night. My partner booked the room and clearly stated was a special night as our wedding celebration. We were expecting at least a simple acknowledgement of our special occasion or a little treat being neighbours and have suffered for many months lot of noise and construction dust. Breakfast was supposed to be included but they told us was not and was a mistake from booking. Our room was pretty small on the first floor overlooking the noisy restaurant. When complained about it, they kindly told us to close the windows... I would have expect a better and higher room. overall would have been much better stay at home and spend the 300 euros in some other place. On the good side, I would highlight the decor British dark design that it’s very charming and the service always very good and polite, that is a plus in Barcelona",2,2017,10,14
34,Loved it and highly recommend,"Great little boutique in the Gothic Quarter. We had a room facing the inner courtyard and living wall. Very quiet and cute. Great service -- we needed help finding taxis and such during the separatist demonstrations, and the front desk went above and beyond. Fantastic bar; Kevin the bartender is a great mixologist and fun to talk to. Lovely roof deck and plunge pool. We will definitely stay there the next time we find ourselves in Barcelona. ",5,2017,10,13
34,Incredible stay - a true 5 star Barcelona boutique hotel experience,"We stayed here five nights and loved every minute.  Killer location! In the Gothic quarter, a block away are fantastic restaurants, bars and shops, yet it is at the end of an alley so the hotel is dead quiet inside.  An oasis away from the hustle.

The common areas and rooms are impeccably decorated with extremely high quality materials and details - very strong water pressure shower, super comfortable bed, feather pillows.

A lounge with a bar that you want to hang out in and enjoy for hours.  The bartender is an artist who can make any drink but revels when you give him the chance to design a cocktail for you - down to the color, scents, etc.  

Extremely delicious breakfast with many options and again, very high quality ingredients and care in prep.  Served in beautiful china indoors or outdoors in a cozy interior patio.  We also enjoyed dinner there very much.

And the service.  Not sure how to describe it as they anticipated and delivered on every one of our needs.  Our concierge found us a 1 star Michelin restaurant at the last minute.  Magic!  Also helped identify routes to famous sites, modern and traditional tapas, etc.  The service excellence continued on the rooftop bar, breakfast and the doorman.  They were all so attentive, professional and thrilled to please and go the extra mile. It was hard to leave that level of pampering and I'd go back again, any time.",5,2017,10,07
34,Small hotel,"My wife booked it following amazing reviews and I would even suggest it but only in a large category. Our room was too small, we had lot of luggage and didnt really have space to unpack. Service was good and friendly but overall not worth the price as everything its very small size for US standards. courtyard, terrace and room too small. good breakfast and rooms amenities well equipped. Overall between 3/4 out of 5",3,2017,10,04
34,One of the best hotels anywhere!,"Where to start? Everything is just right at the Wittmore. The hotel is hard to find but no worries, the hotel staff will help you find it and navigate the Gothic Quarter streets. Every detail is handled with your enjoyment and satisfaction as the top priority. The hotel is quiet but not in a ""shh don't make any noise way"" but more of a ""we spent money to make sure sound doesn't go crazy in here"" way. Food, excellent. Drinks, even better. Our bartenders all made excellent cocktails with a pride and care not seen in most places. 

The rooms are all done well with just the right details that tells you they designed this place to maximize your enjoyment, not extract every dime from you. Visit the rootop for a relaxing drink with wonderful views. And did I mention the service? I did right, because seriously everyone there is incredibly helpful. 

My wife and I have had the pleasure of staying in several top places around the world and we felt pretty strongly that this place cracks the top 5 all-time. If you are going to Barcelona and don't consider the Wittmore you will regret it.",5,2017,10,03
34,Revisit Anniversary. ,"This place just gets better. 
Service is the real key here, the friendly welcome as you enter the establishment each time. 
Whoever trains the staff here has clearly worked very hard. 
Rooms are still an excellent standard, food is good and the ambience in the courtyard for a Romaric evening or a relaxed breakfast is perfection. 
Great beds and didn't want to leave, but you can always come back!",5,2017,10,02
34,Five star and almost beyond ,"Great location, amazing staff, superb breakfast and rooms  that are awesome. Add a rooftop with a bar that serves delicious drinks and you have The Wittmore.
It could be hard to find but worth finding. Dont miss this hotel in the hear of Barcelona ",5,2017,09,29
34,Just wonderful ,"Soon us we get to the hotel , Gabriel helped with our luggage, then Giorgio meet us , he is a very helpful concierge,and very nice person ;Maria was so friendly too every one there , junior ,Javier , Pedro, Carlos , Tamara , Tania, Kevin the bartender was very friendly and excellent mixologist, everyone was amazing, but the kudos are for Mark and Julia , Mark is super wonderful guy , he’ smile is sincerely, and we leave sad because we want to say good by to him , he deserved the best I have no words to explain how amazing human being he is , we miss you Mark :( Julia is a very kind and wonderful woman too helping us with recommendations and the very good service she have , Now talking about the hotel we feel like we was in a club in a good way , then they upgraded the room with extra lighting the room , such a very good amenities in the bathroom, we leave so sad we feel in love with Barcelona, hope to return and see all that friendly faces, sincerely Alexis Jacobo & Willy :) ",5,2017,09,29
34,PHENOMENAL!,"This hotel is truly phenomenal. From the linens and pillows to the beautiful toiletries and don't get me started on the minibar! You could probably last about 5 days on the snacks alone. And they offer gummy bears which is my favorite!! The staff are nothing short of mind readers, I had emailed back and forth for a few months before my trip to Barcelona with the concierge Giorgio and he answered all my questions promptly and arranged transfer service from and to the airport, arranged massages, gave suggestions on an amazing tour company.  And let me just say once we checked in and I was able to meet him in person, he is so good looking I could barely speak. I'm happily married and my husband and I joked for the rest of the time there that Mr. Dreamy is one of the only people who has ever limited how much I talk. Sorry that was just a side note! The hotel also has a beautiful rooftop pool area and bar that is so relaxing,and the service is excellent up there too. I was very impressed with how wonderful the housekeeping ladies were as well. The only VERY MINOR thing that bothered me is that there is no place to put a gratuity on charge slips. So unless you have cash on you constantly you are not able to tip the staff. We will be returning to Barcelona next year and I won't even think to book at Wittmore.  Thank you to the ENTIRE staff! 
Jennifer and Charlie Jett ",5,2017,09,28
34,Amazing place!,"We really enjoyed staying at this hotel. Amazing decor and excellent service. My only gripe as others have mentioned is the lighting (or lack thereof) in the rooms. The rooms have a dark amber glow, which looks cool if you're in a club, but is completely unsuitable for finding things in your suitcase or packing. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend staying here. The rooftop bar is nice too and offers great views of the city.",5,2017,09,28
34,Excellent boutique hotel in Gothic quarter,"We stayed here for 3 days prior to a cruise in Sept. We were warned that the rooms were small, but we found them a perfect size and containing everything we needed. Lots of nice toiletries etc. Restaurant was small, but very good. When you arrive or depart you must walk a few steps to the location where a taxi might stop, but this is easy. The staff all should receive an A+ grade. Julia especially competent and pleasant in the restaurant. The front desk staff went above and beyond with advice about restaurants and booking tickets for various events. This may seem expensive at first blush, but it was more than worth it.  The only possible downside was that the lighting is fairly dim, which won't bother younger guests, but elders should have magnifying glasses.",5,2017,09,19
34,Overall great stay,"There´s a lot of good things to be said about the Wittmore. The staff is really attentive in the reception. The food in the restaurant is great and the decor pretty cool. The minus is not many but they are there. As others have written before; the lights in the rooms are really bad. Yes, it´s cozy and cool in general but it´s making things as packing really difficult. The pool on the roof is not really a pool but a small ""pond"" you can dip your feet in our sit in. That being said the roof-top is really great and the breakfast (which is by ala carte only) is great as well (and served on the roof-top during summer at least)",4,2017,09,17
34,I love this hotel!,This hotel is fantastic.  The staff was super helpful (e.g. providing map and recommendations to see; booking museum tickets; loaning beach towels).  My wife and I loved hanging out on the roof after a day of touring.  We absolutely loved this hotel!,5,2017,09,15
34,Outstanding!,"The Wittmore is without doubt an amazing place! It's beautifully decorated, has fantastic staff and is in a great location (it's a little hard to find at first but this only adds to the experience). We loved the restaurant/bar area, loved the rooftop pool area, loved our room - basically loved the hotel :) I'm certain you will too.

When I return to Barcelona I will be staying at the Wittmore again.",5,2017,09,05
34,Lovely hotel w attentive service,"My husband and I stayed 3 nights.  Great location (albeit hard to find for taxi from the airport-email hotel and ask for the best drop off location) and very friendly and helpful staff. The concierge, Tanya and Giorgio, recommended excellent restaurants.  As the other review state, the rooms are poorly lit and I found myself needing my iPhone flashlight when digging through my suitcase.  The bathroom amenities are luxurious!  Only disappointment was that our room was not ready until 3pm. That is the stated time but was expecting it would have been ready earlier as we arrived around 11am. ",5,2017,09,04
34,A SUPER CHIC HIDDEN GEM IN OLD TOWN BARCELONA,"We were recommended by family to go to The Wittmore. We decided to call in for an afternoon drink, which turned out to be a fabulous cocktail from a vast cocktail menu.
The Wittmore is a hotel which is so understated and hidden away down a little lane. It is a new building but is brimming with super chic style. The staff are all very charming and friendly. The hotel has a rooftop terrace with little pool and great views over the city. We decided to return for dinner the next evening. The candles were lit and the red velvet curtain was drawn. We were shown to our table and we sat down on a cosy sofa. The menu has something for everyone and it did not disappoint. Again the attention to detail continues in the kitchen. A delicious dinner with a great wine list too. Would highly recommend to stay or dine or both!",5,2017,09,03
34,Very small and no light ,"I stayed in a tiny room and wish I didn't that was my fault, not the hotel. The hotel is very nice a quite. The witty restaurant is very good. The drinks are very creative and good. The staff is awesome they help you every chance they get with no problems. The room I felt was over priced for the size. It was very small. It might be good for a short stay, but for 7days it was a nightmare. I couldn't walk without jumping over my suitcase. For the price and in comparison to other 5 star hotels that I've stayed in in the Barcelona area. It didn't justify the money spent. Also my wife main complaint other that the size is that it's no light in the hotel period. The hotel is very dim, if you need light to do make for the night or for any reason you won't have it. No sun light no artificial light, just dim amber lighting. Over all I would go for one of the other hotels in Barcelona as this one didn't meet my needs. But it's a nice hotel right in the middle of the gothic quarters. I just feel I could have gotten more bang for my buck elsewhere. Just for comparison my hotel in Dubai 5 stars and all was way cheaper and bigger than my tiny room. GET SOME LIGHT!!!!!!",4,2017,08,28
34,Fabulous hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"The Wittmore is a little unusual. It's a bit British, and has the most amazing service. We had a fabulous stay and would return at the first opportunity.

The rooms aren't large (if you're American you might find this strange, but if you're British you will hardly notice), but they are well furnished and neatly laid out. The view from our room into the courtyard and restaurant below was lovely. The air con was super-efficient, and very much appreciated when we got in from a hot day walking or cycling round Barcelona. 

The hotel has a wonderful roof garden. Views are amazing, and although the pool is tiny (there is no chance of swimming in it!), it was nice and cool. The library was completely different, yet equally enjoyable: a quiet place to sit and have a drink.

What made the hotel perfect was the staff. They were, without exception, wonderful. Friendly, helpful and nothing seemed too much trouble. The restaurant is excellent and again had wonderful service.

The quirkiness of the Wittmore only added to its charm. The dim lighting in corridors was very atmospheric, our shower was inexplicably enormous and the mini-bar could have kept us fed and watered for months!

It's very rare that you get real character in a hotel along with faultless service, but that's what we got when we spent a few days at the Wittmore.",5,2017,08,24
34,Jewel in the heart of the Gothic area,"This sweet little hotel is a jewel in the heart of the Gothic area of Barcelona.  As many reviews say, it is hard to find but have no fear, the General Manager gives you a personal business card should you get lost in the city during your stay.  Upon arrival, the front desk staff and bellman couldn’t have been nicer.  We arrived early so our room was not ready but we were escorted to the rooftop wading pool and deck where we were treated very well.  The waiter brought us chilled water and towels and made us feel right at home.  When we were brought to our room, the small category, it was more than adequate.  We were in room 104 on the 1st floor and it was amazingly quiet.  It looked out to the vertical garden which is absolutely beautiful.  The toiletries in the bathroom were wonderful as was the large shower.  We enjoyed cocktails in the library, which is so beautifully decorated and so comfortable.  The service in the bar was exceptional as well, just like everywhere else at The Wittmore.  There is only one thing we didn’t like and that was the lighting in our room.  It is very dark, so dark that we used a cell phone flaslight to read a map.  This would not stop us from booking the Wittmore again.  It is a wonderful little property.  One of the best we’ve stayed at.",5,2017,08,22
34,Amazing service,"We stayed here in Barcelona this week and the hotel staff took amazing care of us - from making sure we were safe in the hotel during the terrorist attack to going out of their way to give us advice on our trip to Madrid. Although the hotel facilities are great (beautiful pool and rooms), the staff make the stay worth it.

A few things to keep in mind: being dropped off at the hotel can be difficult for taxis and it is hard to explain where to get dropped off with minimal Spanish. This is because the hotel is very much hidden in the Gothic Quarter. I also wouldn't recommend eating in the hotel as the food wasn't that good.",5,2017,08,20
34,Best Place to Stay Ever,This hotel is a prime example of you get what you pay for.   I have never seen a hotel staff that was as good as this.   From the moment you walked in the door to the moment you left they took care of everything.  Just ask and they can handle it. The roof top area is a great place to relax and have a drink.  I recommend eating at least one dinner in the hotel.  The food is excellent and the service is superior to anything I have ever seen.    The entire staff speaks very good English.    That was very helpful since I know 10 words of Spanish.   If you get the chance you must stay at this hotel!,5,2017,08,17
34,I highly recommend the Wittmore Hotel,"This hotel is beautifully appointed from the restaurant, to the rooms to the rooftop. The staff are also super helpful and friendly. One of my favourite hotels! I would highly recommend having dinner at the restaurant. The food was really delicious.",5,2017,08,14
34,A hidden gem in the gothic quarter,"From the moment we booked the hotel staff reached out to us with ideas and suggestions to make the most of our stay.   We used the services of the concierge to arrange excursions and dinner and all exceeded our expectations.

We felt pampered from the moment we arrived, the service was personal and attentive.  The patio area is a quiet haven after a busy day to enjoy a cocktail.  The roof was a great to place to have breakfast and plan the day.

Our room overlooked the lovely patio area and was well appointed with every attention to detail that you would expect from a hotel of this quality.

After a guided tour of the gothic quarter organized by the hotel - highly recommend this option if you want to have a personal tour of the less well known highlights of the city - a quiet drink turned into dinner when we realized how beautiful the patio was!

For a romantic getaway it would be difficult to beat this hotel.

34,"Bespoke, understated and elegant.","We live in magical times indeed. If I have 4 hours to travel door to door, I can go to North Yorkshire, North Wales, The Kyle of Lochalsh or Barcelona.....stupid question really. This was the best type of break. A Wednesday adult escape that morphed into a long weekend. We travelled light, with small rucksacks, and by mid-morning we were strolling from Placa Catalunya down past the cathedral to find The Wittmore in Gothica. The cheap and quick airport bus is the best way to get into the city. Barcelona being the favourite bolt hole at the moment, we kind of new where we were going, but its still not that easy to find. Secluded and understated up a side street. 

First impressions are stunning. Dark wood, dark carpets, immaculate staff and that unmistakable waft of Joe Malone Pomegranate Noir. Our room wasn't enormous but it was perfect. Looking on to the internal courtyard, the dark wood theme continued. The en-suite bathroom was fabulous and festooned with high quality toiletries.

We took an early lunch on the rooftop – beautiful fish tacos and a crisp Verdejo in a gorgeous location – what could be better? -  before heading out for some Michelin starred dining – yes we are pigs. This was a pattern we began to follow – rooftop, verdejo, fine food, vermouth. The other surprising gem in the Witty is the cocktail bar and the unlikely named Kevin…..from Argentina. His cocktails were heavenly, but I have now developed an addiction to Old Fashioned and Mint Juleps. He’s also got great chat and its good to get some local recommendations for food and drink.

Any down sides were very minor. There was one English TV channel, also we had asked the hotel to book some restaurants but they did so in their own name. It was quite fun trying to work out what name the booking was under. The biggest down side was leaving. This is surely the definition of the boutique hotel. Bespoke, beautifully considered and designed, impeccable discreet service and effortlessly cool. We shall return!",5,2017,08,07
34,Beautiful Hotel In the Heart of the Gothic District,"Wonderful, romantic hotel with great amenities and top notch service. Breakfast on the roof is an absolute must! Highly recommend. We stayed in one of their ""tiny"" rooms and it was more then spacious for 2 of us.",5,2017,07,28
34,Funky Gothic District Hotel,"We arrived in Barcelona after 10 days of staying in small B&B's and old hotels in Ireland. We couldn't have been more delighted with the Whittmore and their outstanding service. We had rooms 104 and 105 which is actually up a level from the lobby. This small hotel (I believe they have 20 rooms total) overflows with its uniqueness and sexy decor. You really feel like you stumbled upon a secret speakeasy. The gothic quarter has a lot of small windy streets that all look the same so google maps (or a street map) was a must. Many taxis have a hard time finding this hotel but the front desk can book one of their regular drivers to transport you from the airport so there isn't any confusion. If you need a taxi during your stay, the doorman will walk you around the corner to the intersection and call a taxi. I recommend snapping a photo of the address to keep on you at all times so you can show a driver if needed. There is an elevator in the hotel to service the 6 floors. Wifi is free and air conditioning in the rooms worked well.

The restaurant downstairs is beautifully decorated in reds and blacks with a view of the  inner courtyard. I had breakfast there several times and it was so peaceful. Breakfast is not included with your stay, however. I personally enjoyed the omelettes and the little side salad that is served with it. 

We had a two King bed rooms with 104 being a handicapped shower. These rooms were in small category on the room designation with smaller rooms available in the hotel. We were fine with the size and were surprised at how big is was given the description. The bathroom is quite large with an exceptional shower. They had the best toiletries I have ever seen in a hotel. In addition to the regular shampoo, conditioner and lotion, they had a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, cotton balls, comb, shaving cream, razor, shower cap and loofah. The hair dryer was also a nice surprise (very powerful). The actual bedroom had a door that separated it from the hallway and bathroom which came in handy when my husband had to take a business call and I wanted to take a shower. The best part about the room was the unique blackout louvers that covered the windows at night. For the most part it is a quiet hotel with only one night being noisy from music nearby. The rooms open to the center courtyard that goes all the way up to the rooftop. My only frustration was with the lack of lighting in the room. The closet was in the hallway between the bedroom and bathroom. I had to turn on my phone flashlight to go through my luggage and find things. Mood lighting is great but not if you are trying to locate clothing.

We had snacks at the rooftop several times. There were yellow and white striped lounge chairs around a small shallow pool (probably only 8"" deep). Even though the view was average, it was a fantastic place to hang out and enjoy an afternoon drink. I couldn't get enough of the mojitos here and thought it was the best I ever had. I also liked the burrata cheese and tomato salad they offered.  Pedro the bartender was outstanding.

I will admit that there were a few times at night where I was on guard in the gothic district but felt safe at the hotel. They post a guard at the street entrance on the weekend nights to ensure safety.

I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,07,25
34,"Fabulous hotel, best service ever","3 days Barcelona, shopping, dining and a spectacular concept. the Wittmore was our home. Great location, friendliest service ever (Melania!), lovely rooftop with very small but usable pool. And great service again. With a smile.

We had a great time. Thank you!",5,2017,07,24
34,Beautiful boutique hotel in good location ,"First of all, the staff at the Wittmore was the friendliest ever. All of them are supernice and helpful. Great job from all of you!

The hotel has a courtyard with a small restaurant and bar. 

On the rooftop there are sunbeds and a small pool (not for swimming). Breakfast is preferrably taken here. Maybe lunch as well.

So why only rated a four? The light! Difficult to see where to put the key when entering the room. Difficult to pack your bag unless you put it on the bef. Finally, the bathroom need more light - difgicult to make a proper make-up.",4,2017,07,24
34,Stylish Hidden Gem,"Absolutely stunningly designed boutique hotel in Barcelona!   Loved the location (Gothic), Staff, Food & Drinks!   The burgers and mojitos are delish!!!!  The rooftop deck was lovely - as long as you don't want to actually swim.   The pool is only about a foot deep but we really didn't mind.   The guest rooms and baths are beautiful and well appointed.    The whole of the hotel (including the rooms/baths) is dark/dim but I am sure that is intentional.    We found the small room a little challenging to manage with two large bags.   Overall Lovely!",5,2017,07,21
34,"Good, but room for improvement ","The reviews of this hotel are outstanding, but there is definitely room for improvement. My fiancée and I stayed for 6 nights. The room was true to its title: tiny. A little too tiny for our suitcases and clothes. There was also no full length mirror (just one mirror in the bathroom), and the room and hotel in general were incredibly dark; so much so we couldn't see where to put our key in the door! The fact that there were only dimmed lamps in the room resulted in dodgy makeup application. Not a good look. The bed however was incredibly comfortable and I would love to order the pillows. So very soft! The rooftop and cooling off pool was lovely and basically our own private rooftop until Friday hit. This became busy, and we were happy we had plans to get out and about. There was also very loud music on the Thursday night until very late. Whilst the hotel is seemingly trying to tick the every soho house type boutique box going, perhaps a few little friendly touches to make the rooms more practical (lights and mirrors) would enable every guest enjoy the experience, not just bachelor men. I felt young single (and very much intending to mingle) men was the target audience for this hotel.",4,2017,07,20
34,Just misses being absolutely fabulous,"Just back from a stay at the Wittmore, overall a positive experience but just one or two issues that stop it being fabulous. This hotel is really stylish and exudes exclusivity, starting with the discreet entrance. The staff  are very attentive and extremely pleasant, you do feel they would do anything for you. Small touches like bottles of water etc are appreciated. Our arrival was marred however by the receptionist insisting we had booked a tiny room despite my confirmation clearly stating we had booked a large double room. She was happy to give us a large room but at a cost, stating that the 'large double room' stated on our confirmation actually meant ' large double bed' !! Anyway the manager, Pilar arrived and dealt with it immediately and professionally ensuring we had the room we booked. This exchange lasted only a short time but the Wittmore must know first impressions are crucial and having to debate about what you have booked isn't ideal. The rooms are smaller than other hotels I have stayed at but that is well documented on the website so shouldn't be a surprise, they are also extremely well appointed and the toiletries are fabulous. However there is no full length mirror or if there is I couldn't find it, which brings me to the other downside; this hotel is dark really dark and while I get it is all about the ambience it becomes rather annoying, we had trouble unlocking our door it was so dark. Lets end on a positive because overall it is a great hotel, the bar is fabulous, has a great atmosphere which we loved and where we indulged in one or two (or more) amazing cocktails.",4,2017,07,16
34,Hidden gem,"Our party of six adults stayed here only 1 night before leaving on a cruise.  We all want to go back and stay longer.  
Everything in this hotel was top notch. The bellhop met our party of six down the street to take us to the hotel.  There is no grand entrance on a street with a sign... you actually walk down an alley way to the entrance.  The front staff was more than professional, they were extremely friendly and will help you in any way possible.  We arrived in Barcelona without luggage and they tried to help us track it down.  The day we were scheduled to check out it was raining, as we were stepping out to go to breakfast, the front desk offered for us to borrow umbrellas while we walked around (we didn't even have to ask).
We stayed in a ""tiny"" category room, which was more than adequate for a night or two.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  The shower was absolutely amazing and the toiletries provided were great.
We loved hanging out on the rooftop at the bar.  Bartenders and staff were amazing and take such pride in what they do.
We all highly recommend this hotel.  You will not be disappointed.",5,2017,07,13
34,Best kept service in Barcelona ,"This was a good surprise. Very friendly and helpful staff, nice and quiet rooms with a super comfortable bed. The shower had THE best water pressure ever (very important when you have long hair and wash it). The bar/restaurant had a bit of a British private club feeling about it. The only downside was the pool on the rooftop, or lack thereof, it was more a bassin. I just want to write that in case you are going there and are expecting to be able to swim. 
",5,2017,07,11
34,"Excellent, exotic, funky, except...","Just an outstanding experience, although we were only there for one night.  A very special place to stay.   Only one caveat (although still worth five stars!) - the location, while fabulous in other ways, is inaccessible by car or taxi.  Taxis can approach a nearby street; larger vehicles (car service autos etc) can only approach further away.  Get your driver to call the hotel as you approach, and they will send a porter and luggage cart.  Rooms are small, although VERY smart!   Deliberated about how many stars to give ""Location"" - in the end gave five.  Would have given less if I wasn't mobile, if I had a mountain of luggage, or if it was pouring with rain!",5,2017,07,11
34,Comfort and excellent service,"My husband and I stayed for 5 nights in the Wittmore and couldn't be happier with our choice. The service received from the staff was top notch, particularly the front desk and twice daily housekeeping. After making several other stops within Spain, the comfortable king bed was a lifesaver! We stayed in the ""small"" room which was quite spacious for two people particularly by European standards. I would not hesitate to stay here again - thanks to the great staff at the Wittmore!",5,2017,07,10
34,Great stay in a great location,"This hotel is an under-appreciated boutique gem in the Gothic Quarter. Its situation at the end of a blind alley keeps it away from high-traffic areas, and the rooms facing toward an interior courtyard made for very quiet nights. The rooms are well appointed and come with generously-stocked mini bars. The sundeck on the roof has great views of the city and a light menu of tasty snacks. Similarly the ground-floor restaurant was fantastic for breakfast. The staff are impeccable in everything, and every staffer I encountered was fluent in English. From arrival to departure, they were tops in service and efficiency. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,07,09
34,a highly confortable and chic but charming boutique hotel in the Barrio Gotico,"All excellent. Wonderful taste, Amazing bed, Great staff, unique and very convenient location. A real dream ! The breakfast in the garden or on the roof top is an enchantement. The atmosphere of the hotel is very special, elegant but cool and relax",5,2017,07,08
34,Best Hotel I've Stayed At,I've traveled alot and this is the first review I've written for any hotel.  The Whittmore is hands down the best hotel that I have stayed at.  The rooms are immaculate and the service is even better.  We spent the first leg of our trip in Barcelona at a 5 star chain hotel and the difference was night and day.  I had no idea that a hotel could make our stay so enjoyable.,5,2017,07,08
34,Gothic Lux,"The location is perfect, walking distance from everything. The staff is lovely and extremely helpful. I booked the extra large room which was perfect to spread out for 2 people. Gorgeous decor full of deep red velvet and black wood with touches of patterns full of personality. The french doors open to the courtyard which let in lovely breezes late in the afternoon and sound of music from the courtyard. The rooftop bar/pool is perfect for lounging, grabbing a tasty drink and taking in 360 degree views of Barcelona. Under 30 rooms makes this a perfect place for great service and privacy. This in not your typical hotel full of wondering tourist. Intimate and well serviced is the best way to describe this boutique hotel.",5,2017,07,08
34,Hotel Stay,Just perfection! One of the best experiences we ever had at a boutique hotel. The staff couldn't do enough for us. So accommodating. Excellent location right in the old section. Place is immaculate. Really was a pleasure!,5,2017,07,07
34,Fantastic Hotel & Service,Me and my fiancé loved this hotel and could not be more pleased with our stay. The staff was incredibly helpful and the room was stunning. The hotel is also located in the heart of Barcelona and within walking distance of everything. Highly recommended! ,5,2017,07,05
34,"Wittmore Hotel, Barcelona, Gothic Area (Great Service and Surprisingly Good Food)","A few days ago we got back from a Barcelona/Greece vacation. In Barcelona, we stayed at the Wittmore Hotel. Now, I will admit I tend to be the pampered-type. I don’t go on vacation unless I can do things up really nice.  The things I liked about the hotel include the nice helpful people who gave excellent service. Practically, every day we were getting directions to new adventures or having them make dinner or attraction reservations. I got the impression they were only too happy to help us out.  All of them treated us nice and with respect and helped in every way possible. So the service was excellent.
The room were small. I hear that is very European. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were kept clean. Room service was also nice and prompt.
The hotel is located closed to several attractions so you can walk to them like the beach and Picasso Museum. 
Good foods is within walking distance of the hotel. To our surprise, we found out the Witty which is the restaurant in the hotel also makes great food. We often ask the servers what is their favorite dish or what is most popular. Speaking of servers, we had Stephano for a server. He was great just as the hotel and restaurant managers were. He recommended a ravioli dish stuffed with lobster. We also liked the cheese cake. We enjoyed breakfast on the rooftop, watched the fireworks and looked at the city from the roof top.
I would stay at the Wetmore again and again. I will mention that the hotel is located in an area of the city where they used horse carriages in the past, so not a lot of cars venture down the street. We felt safe and most folks we met were helpful. The hotel staff came to meet us, carried our bags and help to arrange transport to the airport. They even gave us cards to hand cab drivers if we got lost.
So definitely for service they are an A plus organization. My only suggestions would be a few more bright lights about the place. At my age, I am more interested in seeing than a romantic setting.
In closing, I would give the hotel and friendly people that work in the hotel and restaurant an excellent rating.",5,2017,07,04
34,Perfection,"Stayed for 2 nights on a ""second honeymoon"" in June 2017. Perfect boutique hotel in every respect. Great location on quiet corridor in Gothic quarters. Comfortable, well appointed room overlooking inner courtyard. Excellent views from rooftop bar/restaurant. Service by staff was best I've ever experienced - helped us with dinner reservations, tourist attractions, rental car. Price was reasonable too.",5,2017,07,04
34,Hidden Gem in a great location,"We really lucked out with this hotel. Warm and sincere greeting from a very well trained staff. The room was very small but we knew that when we booked. A great rooftop deck with a bar, comfy loungers ans even a small shallow pool to cool off. We would highly recommend this great hotel",5,2017,07,02
34,Perfect ,"Everything was so lovely and the staff are extremely polite and helpful our room was kept clean and hotel smelt lovely 

The room was lovely with speakers and a good hair dryer

One change would be to offer a wider drinks choice on the roof terrace ",4,2017,06,28
34,An Oasis in the heart of the Gothic Quarter,"This has to be the best hotel we have ever stayed in.  Small but extremely classy. There is an amazing attention to detail; from the room keys to the signature drinks. 

Try the rooftop lounge in the afternoon/evening.",5,2017,06,27
34,Excellent suprise,"This hotel was a great positive surprise. It is located in the Gothic quarter, with no car access. This is a beautiful and ""alternative"" area of Barcelona. The quality of rooms and service comes second to none, even when you compare it to other known luxury brands like Mandarin Oriental and Four Seasons. It is very close to the sea and has an wide variety of cafes and restaurants that can be reach in a short walk.",5,2017,06,26
34,Incredible Hotel - Better Than 5 Stars,"My wife and I just returned from our 4 night stay at The Wittmore and the hotel and staff far exceeded our expectations. The hotel is beyond luxurious with incredible attention to even the smallest detail. Every aspect of the hotel, from the lobby, restaurant, rooms and rooftop terrace is clearly designed to bring romanticism back to the hotel experience. The design and attentive staff seemingly transported us back to a time when a hotel was an experience rather than an inconvenience. 

We stayed in the ""Tiny Room"" and it was better than described. The room size is small, but that is clearly described on the website. While small, it felt much larger and was beyond luxurious. The bathroom was very large with the best shower I have ever experienced. The water pressure was extremely high, which is often difficult in European hotels. The room opened to the outdoor main floor terrace which could be loud at times. However, once the double doors were shut, the room was soundproof and we could hear nothing. During our stay, there was a massive festival with non-stop fireworks - we barely heard a thing. 

The rooftop terrace was an incredible escape from the city. It was intimate, romantic with friendly and attentive staff. The pool is a ""sitting"" pool that is about 2-3 feet deep which was great for laying out under the sun. 

My wife and I have stayed in many 5 star hotels in many countries - the Wittmore is in a class of its own and deserves a much higher rating. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to even the most discerning traveler.",5,2017,06,26
34,Perfection !!,"Amazing hotel in every way. Superb standard and design. Extremely professional and friendly staff. Location in the Gothic quarter is ideal. No traffic noise and can walk to restaurants, bars, beach. Barcelona with luxury.",5,2017,06,26
34,It doesn't get any better than this,"Stayed here for an extended weekend in June 2017. The perfectly located Wittmore delievers discrete elegance and excellence on all levels, with the rooftop bar/lounge as the jewel of the crown. Probably our best hotel experience ever. Highly recommended, if your budget allows it.",5,2017,06,23
34,"Classy and elegant, a wonderful hotel!","I can't rate this hotel highly enough. 

Location: excellent. Located in the southern end of the Gothic Quarter in a mainly pedestrian area, it is an easy walk to the beach, Barceloneta, La Ramblas, and various metro stations. Quick walk from where the taxi drops you off with your luggage (perhaps 1 minute), and the hotel provides excellent directions, however we did use Google Maps also, so no issues here.

Room: elegant and very comfortable. We booked a small room, which was ample for us. Extremely comfortable bed, black out blinds, spacious bathroom, excellent A/C control, no noise whatsoever - beautifully quiet. Agree with some of the reviews on the hot water situation but this didn't bother us (sometimes the water was only warm, not scolding hot). The rooms face into a courtyard area which has a gorgeous garden wall, however worth noting that natural light isn't super bright because of this (we were on the third floor) and the rooms are dimly lit. 

Other: the staff here are 100% fantastic. Great recommendations, very helpful with the local area, seemless check-in and check-out, and just a phone call away for anything you need. Turn-down service also outstanding - fresh water, chocolates, etc. every night when we got home. 

The rooftop was just wonderful. We spent a couple of hours enjoying the sun with drinks and snacks every afternoon. You can also enjoy breakfast up there from 9am. The breakfasts were devine - we usually don't like hotel breakfasts but can highly recommend this one!!

Overall - one of the best hotels I've stayed at. Small and personalised, you are made to feel absolutely spoilt.",5,2017,06,18
34,Barcelona City Break,"This is a fabulous hotel.
Friendly and helpful staff.
Not pretentious in any way.
Most comfortable room.
Good breakfast.
Ideal location with all the main attractions within walking distance.                        
Would definitely go to this hotel again.
",5,2017,06,17
34,Amazing Boutique Hotel,"I stayed in one of the ""Small"" rooms, which was plenty of room. I was traveling by myself, but it would have been fine for 2.
I truly felt taken care of while staying there. It rained quite a bit during my stay and I was offered an umbrella. I was met at the door each time I returned,
The room was well appointed and an amazingly comfortable bed, and a bath robe to die for.
The bartender in the hotel bar was friendly and made an amazing Cosmopolitan. I ate at the restaurant one night. Wow, is all I can say. Beef Wellington, tiramisu, espresso martini. It was quite a meal!
I would highly recommend this to anyone traveling alone, or looking for a romantic get away with that special someone!",5,2017,06,16
34,I shed a tear when we left.,"Finding the secluded Wittmore was not easy. We took a taxi from the airport, and our very patient driver looked at a map with us to figure out the location of the hotel in Barri Gotic, until finally he realized the cab wouldn't fit down the alleyway to the hotel. We knew we were in for an adventure.

We exited the cab in an adjacent alley, and after 5-10 minutes of searching, stumbled upon the gorgeous hideaway.

Don't let the search deter you. It's worth it.

The reception and concierge staff greeted us warmly, and welcomed us with a glass of water... we were a bit breathless after the search!

We were escorted up to our X-Large room on the 5th floor, and were blown away. The sitting area, adorned with a red sofa & two chairs, coffee table and Marshall Amp for Bluetooth music looked into the bedroom, which had an incredibly comfortable king bed. All of which overlooked the hotels stunning courtyard, complete with living wall. The closet space was more than adequate and the bathroom....oh my. The expansive walk-in shower and separate soaking tub were spectacular.

Others have noted that the noise coming from the courtyard was bothersome. We did not experience this at all. In fact, quite the opposite. Unless your windows are open, it's quite silent. Of course, being city kids, we kept the windows cracked some of the time to enjoy the ambiance of the party below.

We dined in the hotel restaurant (Witty) the first evening, and were welcomed even though we didn't have a reservation (which we felt terribly about, as they were slammed!). The food was wonderful, and the service even better. The wine list was just deep enough for our taste, and the cocktails were perfect. 

The rooftop is to die for. The night we arrived, they had arranged for a Brazilian guitarist to play for guests -- a beautiful, thoughtful touch. Service can be a bit slow on the rooftop at times, but if you're there, you've got time. We visited three times, and it was never too crowded. The ""pool"" is just for cooling off, so don't expect to be taking laps. Get a mojito. You won't regret it. I do wish the rooftop were open past sunset. I would have liked to see the city lights while enjoying a glass of wine. That is my one criticism!

Before arrival, the concierge staff provided us with both lunch and dinner reservations. With the exception of perhaps one, all were superb selections, and allowed us to sample the best of what Barcelona had to offer. 

Tamara, Melania and Giorgio all worked seamlessly behind the scenes to make sure our stay was memorable. It was, and their efforts are greatly appreciated.

We'll be back to the Wittmore each time we are in Barcelona. We could not have asked for better.",5,2017,06,15
34,Absolutely Fantastic!,"If I could give this hotel six stars, I would!  My husband and I stayed here for two nights to celebrate his 50th birthday and would not have chosen a better place.  When you arrive in reception, you are greeted warmly and with ice cold water served in beautiful cut crystal glasses accompanied by a sweet selection.  Georgia accompanied us to our room and explained everything.  We had a Superior Room (105) and it was plenty big enough.  Huge bed, sofa, TV, bedside tables, bluetooth speaker, mini bar (which was amazing!), wardrobes and safe.  Huge 'wet room' style bathroom containing a plethora of 'freebie' toiletries - Shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, shaving foam, toothpaste, shower gel, toothbrush, comb, etc., the list goes on!  Our room overlooked the patio and interior garden where dinner is served (ask for a table in this area if you go to the restaurant).    

The rooftop bar is lovely.  We went in the afternoon and evening.  Great service.  The downstairs bar is also fab.  We ate in the 'Witty' restaurant on the Sunday night and although it was very quiet (Saturday was packed) the food was stunning.  Again service was excellent.

The hotel is in a great location (note, it is hard to find, but if you call the hotel they will come and find you - our driver parked at the nearby post office as the streets are too narrow for some cars and the porter found and escorted us back).  

Overall, we were hugely impressed by the service, location, quality, decor and all round 'feel' of this hotel - it is fantastic.",5,2017,06,12
34,Perfectly nestled into the Gothic Quarter,"We have just returned from a two night visit.  The Hotel itself is very dark and mysterious but in a totally satisfying way.  The decor and cleanliness of the hotel is outstanding.  We did pick the smallest room and it is just that but it is very tastefully designed, especially the bathroom.  The staff are very helpful and we loved relaxing on the roof terrace after touring the city at the end of the day.  We also loved having breakfast on the roof terrace too.  We enjoyed a nightcap in the bar at the end of the first night and there was music to entertain us.  The location of the hotel is very well situated and you are spoilt for choice with all the bars in the immediate vicinity.",5,2017,06,05
34,Extremely Satisfied,"My wife and I stayed 7 nights at The Wittmore for our 20th anniversary trip in May 2017.  We were very pleased with the hotel.  Wow, this hotel is top notch and it's location in the Gothic Quarter is great.  The food from the restaurant and the wait staff is outstanding.  We visited the bar each night for a nightcap and loved every second of it.  The front desk personnel were very friendly and accommodating.  The rooms are luxurious and quite large for a small boutique hotel.  Do yourself a favor and stay here if you are planning a trip to Barcelona.  We are very much looking forward to going back.",5,2017,06,02
34,Boutique hotel with great location and great service,"We stayed at the Wittmore for a few days in May 2017. It's hidden down a side alley. The building itself was fully renovated into an older yet modern British take.

We found the staff very knowledgeable and friendly. We relied on them for two dinner reservations. One was for paella. The recommendation had mixed reviews on TripAdvisor which had us worried. The restaurant turned out great, to the credit of the hotel's staff. 

The room we had was very small, certainly more than we'd hoped for. We think this goes with the building's internal structure. 

The location though easily made up for it.

We loved the places and would gladly go back. ",5,2017,05,30
34,Would Never Stay Here Again,"This is a new hotel but does not deserve a top rating.   The design of the hotel is such that the rooms are on 5 floors above and surrounding the open air restaurant and bar on the first floor.  The bar's loud music plays until 1:00 a.m. So forget about trying to go to sleep before then.  The folks at the front desk are delightful and the view from the rooftop is enjoyable, but the water pressure for the shower is poor and only warm, not hot.  The rooms are really small and almost no closet room.  There is something strange about the air conditioning that even the staff do not understand.  I noticed several guests appear to be sick, coughing and sneezing, and I wonder if there is a connection to the A/C.  The bed pillows are just mush with no form. Food is good in the restaurant. 

With so many better choices to stay in Barcelona, including the Barri Gotic area, I will go somewhere else next time. ",2,2017,05,26
34,First class,"This hotel is a hidden gem in the Gothic Quarter.   Our room has one of the better showers I have seen in Europe.  It is a walk-in, not one of those dangerous rounded bottom tubs that are typical. The bathroom amenities are ultra luxurious. The decor is black and gold and very beautiful. The bar also doubles as a classy library. The staff are efficient and friendly. Our room was small,but cosy. Larger rooms are available. We will be back.",5,2017,05,25
34,Good location and quiet,"There are many pros to the hotel, the staff were very friendly, the room clean and tidy (with every travel item you need from razor to toothpaste), it was very quiet and dark to ensure a good nights sleep. 
The terrace is perfect for a pre dinner drink, the pool however is only a paddling pool and certainly not big enough to swim.

Although the hotel was tastefully decorated, mainly black with low lighting, I was forever tripping up over the carpet and couldn't see to put my key in.

We had breakfast a couple of times which was ok but not 5stars, cold poached eggs and our breakfasts arrived 5mins apart.

All in all the hotel was nice but not one I would return to, probably perfect for an older couple (apart from the darkness).
",3,2017,05,25
34,Beautifully and artistically designed and decorated.  Staff support and attention to detail is without parallel.,"Would chose this place for each time we visit Barcelona.  Elegant, intimate, luxurious, great location and superb service and staff support in every aspect.  Would not hesitate to recommend to friends. Will return many times.",5,2017,05,18
34,Brand new stylish and luxury boutique hotel,"The hotel has opened on 2016 (I suppose) and the design and style are very very refined...
It's becomed one of the barcelona's nightlife most hot spot, with a top of the art bartender and a glamorous restaurant.
The rooms are very refined in the style and in the materials.
The personnel it's young and motivated, very kind and polite, probably, in my opinion, it need a little more experience, but it's way far than become a problem :)

We'll come back for sure....",4,2017,05,18
34,Very pleasant hotel but too dark!,"The hotel is located in a peaceful little street in the heart of the old city. You might be afraid that it is too noisy, it is not. We had a room towards the patio. 
The rooms are good in size and the bathroom well equipped. 
Breakfast served on the rooftop when the weather allows it is worth it. Service a little slow. The egg omelette was perfect but after all we are in Spain! 
I had a delicious dinner in the patio, the Gaspacho (they called it differently) was excellent!
The main problem of this hotel is the lack of light! Its real bad. Be careful when you apply your blush ladies, you might have a surprise when you get out!!! There was no mirror in the room other than the bathroom one, would be nice to be able to see ourselves from top to bottom. If you make a reservation in a restaurant do check with the concierge if he/she received a confirmation.",4,2017,05,16
34,Luxury in the heart of the Gothic Quarter,"The Gothic Quarter is a maze of interesting alleyways packed with shops, restaurants and hotels, but this ancient neighborhood is the home of one of the most beautiful hotels I have seen. The dark walls with velvet curtains and interesting ""mid century"" meets traditional look, gives this hotel depth and interesting texture. The staff were always professional, always willing to help and made sure my stay was excellent. My room was always exceptionally clean and the rooftop and lounge experiences added to the richness this hotel had to offer. I highly recommend this hotel if you are interested in experiencing Barcelona in one of the most fascinating neighborhoods this city has to offer.",5,2017,05,14
34,Sumptuous stay ...,"The Wittmore is so amazing - everything about it makes you smile.  The staff are the absolute stars - from mixing the perfect Martini, to getting a table in the best restaurants, to running out and getting the Sunday Times - nothing is too much trouble, absolutely loved it.  The D R Harris toiletries are a really nice touch, the music at breakfast was super - and the location simply perfect.  We will be back.",5,2017,05,07
34,Outstanding Property,"This hotel is outstanding in every way.  From the location to the rooms, service, food, and facilities, everything about this property is wonderful and will be our ""go to"" hotel in Barcelona. While the location is unique, the food outstanding, and the service exceptional, the most memorable experience in this hotel is the roof-top deck with an outstanding view, wonderful food/drinks, and a beyond-cool vibe. My only regret is having to leave the hotel to go on a cruise. Please know that the only reason the hotel is ""adults only"" is because all of the rooms open to an inner courtyard with a view of a 6-story vertical garden. Lively children may disrupt the solitude. While taxi cab drivers may find the hotel tough to find, it is literally a stones throw away from the old post office and the waterfront mosaic sculpture. Use these as your guideposts.",5,2017,05,02
34,Amazing property and a staff to match,"As you will read on every review, the Wittmore is challenging to find....but worth the effort. Our stay from 4/23-4/29 was picture perfect. Our room 405 was directly across  from the living wall (a great way to wake up in the morning). Bed, hot water, towels all were first class and plentiful. Kevin in the bar and Steffenos in the restaurant provided unbelievable service as did the front desk staff. Dinning in the restaurant was excellent in service and in the quality of the food. The facility had the upscale, sanctuary feeling we were hoping for when we booked. When we go back to Barcelona, we'll only contact the Wittmore and base our schedule around room availability.....it's that good!",5,2017,05,01
34,Every detail is a delight,"The Wittmore is a lovely boutique hotel. The staff are welcoming, warm, and accommodating, and my room was comfortable and stocked with amenities. I was in Barcelona on my own for business, and enjoyed being able to use the roof and library/bar for work when I needed to but wanted to be out of my room. The Barri Gòtic is my favorite area in Barcelona, and this hotel could not be more ideally situated in that neighborhood (just make sure you know where you are going when you first arrive)--close to the water, the cathedral, Museu Picasso, El Born, and La Rambla.",5,2017,05,01
34,An hidden jewel,"An ideal cool place for a couple wishing to find some low profile hidden place to spend two/three days in the center of the city.
A boutique hotel with charm and discreet/attentive service.
One of the hotel visited in the last year with the best bathroom amenities. 
Breakfast in the roof terrace or in the bar has a special cosy feeling.
Concierge service accurate and friendly.
Definetely a place to take my wife.",5,2017,04,28
34,Really nice hotel,"Pretty much everything you'd expect from a 5* hotel - really comfortable room and very friendly and attentive staff.

It is well located pretty centrally in the gothic quarter of the city and is close to the beach.

The bed is insanely comfy, and if your fiancé puts on the bathrobe, good luck trying to get her out of it in time for your dinner reservation.

The roof terrace is nice and has a pretty good view. The pool up there is tiny, it looked about a foot deep and I don't even know if you are actually allowed in it. There is only a small selection of drinks available up there.

It is dark and gothic-looking inside which is perfectly in keeping with the area.

I would say it's not a hotel for kids! Other than that I'd definitely recommend a stay here. ",5,2017,04,26
34,Absolutely fell in love with this place!,"We chose The Wittmore Hotel for a two night stay before we departed Barcelona for a 10-day Mediterranean cruise on the Oceania Riviera.  We chose The Wittmore because its website looked intriguing and the reviews on Trip Advisor looked good.  Well, we were blown away.  The hotel is absolutely adorable.  It is located down this narrow alley in a wonderful part of town.  The décor is classy and warm.  And, the best part of all, is the staff.  Every single staff person who interacted with us was friendly and helpful.  Knowing no Spanish, we were a little worried but every employee communicated in English.  The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and also gave us excellent recommendations for nearby restaurants and bars.  We booked a ""small"" room but it really was more than enough space.  It was elegantly furnished with a luxury bathroom and a very comfortable king size bed.  And two great balcony windows opening out onto a peaceful courtyard.  We had drinks at the bar both nights (once outside in the courtyard and once inside) and the drinks were great as was the service.  The bar and restaurant area are beautiful.  We also had drinks on the rooftop patio by the pool.  The rooftop has 360 degree views of Barcelona.  Finally, the morning of our departure, we had a great little breakfast upon the rooftop as well.  We have stayed in hundreds of hotels all over the world and The Wittmore ranks in my top 10 favorite hotels.  Highly recommended!  We can't wait to go back.",5,2017,04,25
34,Lovely hotel,"Beautiful hotel in the best area in Barcelona. Nice restaurants and shops steps away. Beautiful rooftop terrace, with a small pool too small to use. Extremely serviceminded staff. Good food but quite pricy. ",4,2017,04,19
34,"Wow, fantastic, hidden gem, great location, superb service!!!","Wow, wow, wow. This is an absolute hidden gem in a great place in Barcelona.
The service from time of booking the room, to arranging car parking, to arrival, staying, leaving and after we left have been the best experience ever, compared to any hotel we have stayed in.
This most be the best boutique hotel in the world, just so good that you can only understand until you have stayed here.
The staff were so great, and the bed soooooo comfy we could have slept all day long.",5,2017,04,19
34,Beautiful boutique hotel,"This beautiful boutique hotel is nestled in the gothic quarter. Great location for exploring on foot.  Something interesting around every corner. We stayed 3 days in a spacious suite. Living area with couch, chairs, dresser and tv. Bedroom with sitting area, king size bed and tv. Really large bathroom with the most toiletries of any hotel I've ever stayed in- the usual shampoo etc and toothbrush, toothpaste, combs and razor. We didn't need them, but very nice to know they were provided if we had needed them. 
The staff is fantastic!  Cannot say enough great things about them. So helpful and friendly!
The restaurant was amazing. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. Best ceviche I've ever had!
The rooftop area was delightful and the perfect place to catch a few rays of sun while sipping a mojito. 
It pains me to have to complain about the lighting and thus withhold a star. But, truthfully I felt like we were staying in a dungeon... the lack of lighting was a problem: in the lobby we had to huddle around the one dim lamp to see the landmarks on the map, in the corridor we struggled to find the keyhole to unlock our door and in the room we resorted to pulling out our phones flashlight to be able to find clothing inside the luggage. It was a constant problem.  There has to be a balance between a romantic dinning experience and the practicality of a well lit room. 
",4,2017,04,12
34,"Stylish, Cozy and Comfortable","We stayed here for 3 nights. We had the ""Small"" room. 

When we first arrived, we were offered cold water and some small sweets/snacks. We arrived at the hotel in the morning and the room wasn't ready. We were able to get the room within 30 minutes. We just walked around the Gothic quarter and had a coffee.

The location is nice and quiet but shops and restaurants just around the corner. 

The room is small and dark, but it functions well. The bed is the best feature of the room. It is very comfortable.

The bathroom only has a shower but it has all the toiletries including mouthwash, tooth brush, tooth paste, a small wooden comb as well as condoms. 

The roof top is nice. It has a small pool, but it closes very early. 

Having the restaurant down stair and open area, it does get noisy. They do have good windows and If you close them, you do not hear any noise.

The only suggestion I have for the hotel is having a coffee machine in the room.

I would stay here again.",5,2017,04,10
34,The best hotel experience yet ,"If anyone is looking for the most wonderful and cool hotel experience the Wittmore is the place. From the customer service to the details in the hotel... its absolutely breathtaking. 
Thank you for an exceptional experience! ",5,2017,04,04
34,PARADISE BEHIND A BLACK DOOR,"We have just had 5 wonderful days at a magical hotel from the 21/3/17,the staff are a credit to this hotel and make you feel so special. We would be out all day seeing what Barcelona had to offer but every evening go back to this little private paradise behind the black door in a small street. The only thing that could have been better was the roof terrace was not open till next month which we were not told about until we arrived after reading on trip advisor 4 weeks ago (fabulous boutique) that it would be open in a few days, this did not spoil our holiday but it would have been nice to know before. PLEASE don't let this put any one off going because you will love it we did. It might be a good thing if the hotel put a small torch on each key ring ,I would like to thank everyone at the Wittmore for a wonderful stay my wife has not stopped talking about it.",5,2017,03,30
34,Old World Charm in the Gothic Quarter,"This gem of a hotel (22 rooms in all)  is nestled at the end of a tiny street in the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona and will provide you with the most exquisite setting to relax at the end of your busy day in Barcelona, no matter the purpose for your trip.  Although the style of the hotel is very modern, in terms of style of furnishings, it is the cozy atmosphere that evokes bygone days of privileged travel comforts.  If you are looking for a mega hotel with spas and workout rooms please go elsewhere, although there is a pleasant sitting area on the roof and a central patio that they open up for dining in the pleasant weather. The thought that went into the hotel common space is ingenious with most of the ground floor resembling an old world library and bar to one side and dining on the other two sides of the patio.  The staff is incredibly bright, attentive and intuitive.  It must be said that the hotel caters to romance and is a perfect setting for lovers, honeymoons and second honeymoons, restricting guests to adults only and featuring Frank Sinatra crooning in the background.  We arrived on a Sunday for a three day conference.  I shared the elevator with a young man and his fiancee, just engaged, who were having engagement pictures taken at the hotel.  The king sized beds are heaven.  We stayed in ""small rooms"" which were perfectly adequate in size.  The bathrooms are luscious in their appointments!  I truly did not want to leave this magical space.  Book a room....you are in for the time of your life!",5,2017,03,27
34,A rare hidden gem in the Gothic Quarter!,"We chose the Wittmore for a business trip to make sure that we got an authentic taste of Barcelona and we were not disappointed! Although it was semi-difficult to find the first time around, I loved the fact that it was so hidden away and definitely offered that escape I was desperately looking for after days of work meetings. The staff is truly fantastic, everyone was incredibly kind, helpful, and made our stay absolutely amazing! I loved the unique decor and atmosphere of this boutique hotel and the rooms exceeded my expectations of both charm and comfort. My favorite part about this place was the cozy library/bar area. A perfect place to unwind after a long day and order a delicious cocktail!",5,2017,03,27
34,Beautiful boutique hotel! ,"I stayed at The Wittmore for 4 nights with my husband and can't recommend it highly enough! I had high expectations after reading the reviews and was not disappointed! It did prove a little tricky to find when we first arrived but once we found the hotel we were welcomed by friendly faces and delicious welcome truffles and macarons. We stayed in a ""tiny"" room which certainly wasn't tiny and had a beautiful view out to the terrace adorned with fairy lights. The room was decorated to a high level with endless toiletries including toothpaste, mouthwash, a razor and a comb in the bathroom. Housekeeping came twice a day, each night providing a turn down service and putting slippers, truffles and a bottle of water by the bed. The bed was especially comfortable making it a little difficult to get up each morning! We loved the hotel and would definitely stay again. ",5,2017,03,25
34,A Honeymoon Masterpiece,"We spent a week of our honeymoon in Barcelona, and at The Wittmore.  For a romantic getaway it is perhaps without peer.  There is a wonderful juxtaposition between the old, rustic charm of the Gothic, and the swank luxury of the The Wittmore.  We spent our days, and nights, exploring Barcelona; and to be able to return to the Wittmore's quiet seclusion was such a pleasure.  The staff were all beyond professional.  They were all very friendly and helpful throughout our stay.  We were there for a week and a day.  That's plenty of time to have at least one less than perfect interaction, but we certainly did not!  By the way, the bar had some very nice Mezcal.  You should stay at this hotel and enjoy one of their mezcal negronis.  You'll thank me for it!   One more thing, the beds are freaking amazing, enjoy",5,2017,03,16
34,Peaceful Hotel in Great Location,"We very much enjoyed our stay at The Wittmore Hotel.  The location is excellent.  It does make the hotel slightly trickier to find, but I think that is actually a huge perk.  I loved how tucked away it was.  It was a very peaceful place to retreat after a long day of walking.

All the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful.  The water, chocolate truffles and madeleines served upon arrival were a lovely touch.

The decor was funky and while perhaps not 100% to our taste, very well done.  It made it a fun place to stay.  It had loads of character!  The outdoor courtyard with the living wall was a lovely place to chill out in.  I think it would be even nicer in the summer when I'm sure it will provide a cool, peaceful retreat.

Our room was very comfortable.  We were upgraded from our original room (which is always a nice surprise).  I believe our new room was a 'small' room, but it had plenty of space for us and a nice layout that put a number of doors between the bedroom and the main hall where the lift was and thereby created a very quiet room.  The beds were very comfortable as were the pillows (which I often don't like at hotels).

All and all a great stay!  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quirky, upscale hotel in a great location.",5,2017,03,13
34,Luxurious and refined,"It would be a mistake to stay any where else.  It was a secluded, private club atmosphere.  The staff and amenities are likely unmatched.

The bathroom was spacious and immaculately clean. Of course, the bathroom products were lovely.

Jazz music flowed quietly throughout the lobby and courtyard. We happily left our windows open to let it waft in.

The bed was perfect.

We travelled to NYC to Lisbon to Barcelona to Paris before returning home to LA.  This hotel was the only one we said we absolutely needed to return to at some point.  

Professionally operated, we felt greatly respected by the staff, an experience that I sometimes miss abroad.

",5,2017,03,12
34,Had it's charms...and it's issues,"I'd give this 3 1/2 stars. Here is why...

Pros: charming lobby and bar. Location is nice. Easy to get to most places by foot. I like the vibe of the downstairs and overall feel of the hotel. Most of the staff was nice and we liked leaving the key with the front desk. Taxis had no idea where it was, but we just ended up saying ""near the post office.""

Cons: room and hallways were overly dark. Couldn't see how to get the key in the door. The stairwells were so dark I felt for sure I was going to miss a step and fall. The room was too small for two people. Did not accommodate 2 suitcases. Room was so dark, when my husband left for a meeting, he unknowingly took a piece of my undergarment attached to his briefcase! Ha! Water pressure was weak and kept going cold and hot all three showers I had. Also, I was treated extremely rudely by the security guard one night. He assumed I wasn't staying there. It was insulting. The staff did apologize, but it wasn't like I looked like a hoodlum or something.

We stayed here during the MWC and waited too long to find a hotel and this was all that was available. This is my third time in Barcelona and I would pick a different place for my 4th time.",4,2017,03,11
34,Wonderful boutique hotel,"The Wittmore is charmingly designed and conveniently located. Additionally, the staff is superb -- knowledgeable, nice, and fluent in English. If/when I return to Barcelona I will certainly stay there again.",5,2017,03,10
34,Fabulous Boutique ,"This is a Beautiful hotel with welcoming and friendly staff, it's tucked away in a street in the picturesque gothic quarter a short walk from most things worthy of visiting in Barcelona. I had a fantastic stay with my girlfriend and we both loved the hotel. We had a meal the in the hotel on our last night and wish we had eaten there a hell of a lot more, the food and service is fantastic. The rooms are very homely and the beds are one of the most comfortable I have slept in, it isn't often you get a true sense of comfort, and it's the small gestures that count, such as toiletries in the room. The only negative is we couldn't use the roof terrace as it's out of season and renovation work was taking place, but I'd come back to the Wittmore in a heartbeat ! ",5,2017,03,01
34,What a Gem of Luxury and taste,"We stayed for 3 nights in Feb half term, the hotel was booked by my work as a prize, what can I say...... WOW tucked away in the Gothic quarter the hotel was impressive, with its own unique style, defiantly 5 star luxury, rooms were well presented both bed and pillows amazing, large screen TV and Marshall amp type MP3 speaker.
The Hotel staff were fantastic, very helpful and polite and quick to respond to any thing. If you are looking for a boutique luxury hotel this is the one.
Location is perfect to near by attractions.
I would defiantly go back, Thank you for making our stay a memorable one",5,2017,02,27
34,near-perfect for a couples retreat / treat,"Stayed at wittmore with my wife as a last minute St Valentines treat and we loved it. it's tucked away in a narrow street in gothic, so don't expect the taxi to drop you at the door! it's 2 mins walk from the nearest proper 'road', so no problem. use google maps to take you to the door

once there, we were attended to in a very friendly and efficient manner. shown to our room and given advice about where to go and eat etc.  

the place is dimly lit, which we loved, added to the ambience and romance of the place. our room was fabulous! top class fixtures n fittings throughout. awesome bathroom, shower, great bed, well stocked mini bar and the best little bluetooth speaker i've ever seen (by Marshall).

everything we say looked and felt brand new and spotlessly clean 

The bar area is cool and comfortable, with real books to read if you're that way inclined. there is also a courtyard area. i believe there is a roof top area but we didn't see that

i have stayed in many 'boutique' hotels in my time, but this is one of the best! they get most things spot on. 

hard to criticise, but if pushed, i would say the wine list could be better. it's normal to find only spanish wine here in spain, but it's a joy to have a change now and then. a little more selection would have made my day. instead, i chose a spanish cabernet sauvignon, which turned out to be a poor choice, I didn't rate it at all. with relatively few wines on the list, why find space for that? it's not a great grape to choose from spain, but i took a chance because i love cab sav and i get very weary of the same grapes (we live in spain).  i must add that there were some french (and german maybe?) options on the wine menu, but neither were tempting for me.

finally, the music in the bar / restaurant we found a bit odd. kind of 50s maybe? some cool electronic lounge music would have been spot on for me, but no doubt plenty would disagree. 

can't comment on the restaurant, because we didn't dine at the hotel. they gave us a great suggestion for lunch / dinner though
 
if anyone ever asks me to recommend a couples retreat in barcelona, this will be it!",5,2017,02,16
34,"""Out of this WORLD!""","I have recently just returned from my stay at The Wittmore Hotel, a surprise trip to celebrate a 30th Birthday. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by The Wittmore staff! The concierge Hana was absolutely wonderful, she well and truly went beyond to make our stay an experience to remember! Every member of staff was polite and most attentive! 

The Hotel has rich decor, which offers the first allure of secrecy! 

Our room was pristine, a beautiful king size bed which was hard to rise from as it was so comfortable!

I recommend room service, their coffee was delicious...we drank them looking out on the lush secluded courtyard garden!

The location is amazing, so lovely to stay in the Gothic Quarter!

Our last night, we sat and drank Old Fashioned cocktails by the fire! The ambience was mesmerising! 

We absolutely adored our stay at The Wittmore, I plan to return in the Summer!

Thank you for a memorable experience!",5,2017,02,12
34,Swanky,I don't normally stay in places like this but it was our last night and we wanted comfy beds. The beds were amazing. The concierge also got us into a great place for dinner and accommodated our every need. The bartender was also great. We didn't eat in the restaurant  but I'm sure it was good. I wish we'd been there longer than one night. It was a difficult place to find and we kind of lucked into finding it because our taxi driver couldn't seem to get to it and gave us incorrect directions. Hence the 4 instead of 5 stars. It's fairly new so I think they are working on that.,4,2017,02,07
34,Great service,The staff members go above and beyond to make sure that you are comfortable and that you are having a good stay.  They were really friendly and helpful.  I could not be more impressed with them.  The hotel is a little hard to find and they came out to get me on the street.  It is located in a really cute part of Barcelona and I had a great time walking around.  I really enjoyed my stay,5,2017,01,30
34,The Greatest Boutique Hotel EVER!,"My wife and spent five days at the Grand Hotel Central (which was also excellent) in Barcelona, then went on a 9 day Mediterranean cruise, then came back to Barcelona and stayed at The Wittmore Hotel to spend a little more time in Barcelona. 

The Wittmore is tucked into the alleyway vs. being on a main street and not easy for the cab to navigate, but WOW once we arrived. It's a perfect location in the Gothic Quarter where you can walk to everything, but more importantly we were treated like royalty and felt like royalty at every engagement with the hotel and dining staff.

The hotel itself, staff, dining experience and ambiance are out of this world and second to none. Elegantly appointed, five star service, five star dining experience and food, and reasonably priced.

We're coming back to Barcelona on another vacation this summer for a week and we will spend every night at the Wittmore and probably have most meals there too. WOW is an understatement and my wife says I'm the harshest critic she knows. The Wittmore is a 10 out of 10. I can't think of another time I could say that. Except about my wife of course. ;)",5,2017,01,23
34,Fantastic new boutique hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"This hotel is not easy to find at first in the narrow streets of the Gothic Quarter but finding it is very well worth the effort! Fantastic attention to detail, personal service and very comfortable beds are only a fraction of this hotel's qualities. The Concierge Giorgio gave us great recommendation for restaurants off the beaten track. Highly recommended, would definitely stay here again. (The hotel is adults only so not suitable for families with kids)",5,2017,01,15
34,Understated luxury,"Lovely hotel, brilliant attention to detail, oasis of calm in El barrio gotico. 
Room was lovely, courtyard view was nice to wake up to!

34,"If you want WOW in Barcelona, this is your place: Most unique hotel experience ever.","Home away from home in Barcelona: Two words to describe it: Unique and special.

This place is beyond words - all the reviews don't do it enough justice.

I've traveled around the world to more than 70 countries and have stayed in some of the best 5 star hotels all around the planet.   Nothing compares to the WOW and cool factor of the Wittmore to the point where I would never stay anywhere else in Barcelona and actually wished there were more Wittmore hotels in other parts of the world.

Barcelona is a beautiful city where you'd expect to spend most of your time outside in the city.  Staying at the Wittmore we felt that we actually needed and wanted another 2-3 days to just enjoy the hotel because it's that good and we loved the atmosphere.

To start with, the hotel is a work of art where every detail makes a difference, whether its the decor of the rooms, the restaurants and lounge, etc.  A truly unique luxury boutique hotel in a quiet corner of Barri Gotic (Gothic Quarter) which is a must visit and truly beautiful  and unique area of Barcelona with it's gothic architecture, mazed coblestone streets and beautiful squares -  This in my opinion is the best area to stay in Barcelona and it's really centric to entertainment and sightseeing.

They really went out of their way to make sure that every visual aspect and detail in the hotel makes it feel unique and makes you feel at home.  From the decor of the rooms (a mix of homey-modern-cool decor with state of the art gadgets, beautiful furniture and seriously comfortable bed and bedding) to the food and drinks at the truly unique lounge.  The entertainment at the lounge is pure class. 

The rooms:  Extremely comfortable and beautiful with every small detail taken care of.  We were lucky enough to be upgraded to one of the Suites thanks to Narcis who we were very lucky to meet and spend time with while we stayed at the hotel.   The suites are simply amazing and if you can, don't hesitate to book one - they are that good and you will not regret doing so.

However the staff really steal the show and make the Wittmore what it is ""home away from home"":   We never felt like were staying in a hotel.  It felt like we were staying at a beautiful luxurious retreat or home with some of our best friends and the owner of the house itself (Narcis) making you feel truly special -  It's difficult to explain but the experience was so amazing that we actually want to go back to visit the hotel staff.  The personalized service and how they treat you is really beyond words.  Starting with Giorgio and everyone else at the front desk, Maria in the lounge restaurant and of course Narcis, the owner who is always ready to welcome you to your new home in Barcelona and make sure that you have the best possible experience.  Everyone else in the front desk, the lounge restaurant, the guys at the door and the rooftop bar really made us feel as special but unfortunately we don't remember all the names! 

If you're going to Barcelona, and are looking for something really unique that doesn't feel like a typical hotel experience do yourself a favor: Stay at the Wittmore and if you can, book a suite. There is nothing else like it out there either in Barcelona and possibly in most other places around the world. 

Make sure you spend at least one of your nights in the beautiful hotel lounge:  The experience is unforgettable with live jazz and top class drinks and food in the company of amazing people.

Thanks to Narcis for creating a beautiful and hip home away from home for us in Barcelona and to everyone else who works in the Wittmore for treating us like family.  

We look forward to come back!",5,2016,12,18
34,Exceptional Staff. ,"We stayed at the Wittmore for a long weekend in December. The hotel was in a great location, however what gives this hotel the edge is the staff. They took time to make sure we got the very best from our visit by recommending superb Restaurants's, pre-booking our tickets and mixing some top notch cocktails. ",5,2016,12,11
34,Home from home,"Great place. Tucked away in the Barrio Gotico down a tiny side street but in the heart of this old neighbourhood, and steps away from plenty of little bars and restaurants, this really is a home from home. We stayed in a 'Small' room which was plenty big enough, with two small juliet balconies overlooking the central courtyard with feature garden wall, and looking down on the tables at the bar below.  Excellent soundproofing - it was only when we opened the windows late last night/early in the morning that we realised there was music playing downstairs - The Pearlfisher's Duet, marvellous. Little touches everywhere - small design details but a lot of thought has gone into this, from the lighting (a little too dim overall perhaps) to the Marshall amp style speakers in the room. Just great. And the most comfortable bed I've slept in for a long time.  The staff, just excellent. A particular mention to Tamara. From the moment we booked they kept in touch, offering (on request) a long selection of restaurant suggestions with detail on style, location etc, and arranged bookings.  A great time and a great place. Will return soon",5,2016,12,11
34,Just WOW WOW WOW,"Absolutely beautiful hotel tucked away in the gothic quarter.  Staff were amazing and couldn't do enough for you.  We stayed in the tiny room but it was big enough for us as we only stayed for 1 night.  Rooms were gorgeous and the amenities in the bathroom were out of this world, there was even a small natural sponge supplied. I will definitely be back and hopefully stay a few more nights ",5,2016,12,10
34,Sophisticated ambience with a flare of flirty frills,"This hotel is cleverly secluded at the end of a tiny little street in the heart of the ""Barrio Gótico"" which is the soul of Barcelona.  From here, virtually every part of the city that you would ever want to see is easily accessible... but why would you ever need to wonder out of the charming area of this neighborhood?  It is surrounded by amazing little tapas bars, art galleries, antique stores, clothing boutiques and top notch dining.  The location is prime but the way the hotel is situated at the end of this little ally gives you the sense that you are not surrounded by all the hustle and bustle. It truly is an oasis with the garden wall in the patio area, sophisticated tunes and/or live music playing, finely crafted board games scattered about the bar tables and a nice fire on a chilly November day.  In fact, while I was sitting in the bar waiting for my husband to join me, the owner came over and played a game of backgammon with me!  (Then he comped out drinks and sent over some delicious ""croquettas"" for us to snack on!)  The restaurant was so delightful that we decided to stay in and eat there for our last night in the city.  A million and one restaurants to choose from that are all outstanding throughout Barcelona, and we chose the restaurant in our hotel!... and it was a great experience!
The beds are very comfortable and the linens are high quality and very clean.  The toiletries in the bathroom were up scale and no detail was remised. The room was small and made it difficult to navigate the room with 2 suitcases but the furniture and decor were functional and pleasant.  
The service was great.  We left at 3:30 in the morning and they were right there ready to take our bags and walk us down to the cab they called for us.  Everything was right on time and we never had to wait long for much of anything!  I can't image that I will ever stay anywhere else the next time I return to Barcelona.",5,2016,12,06
34,Very cool boutique hotel,"We only went for drinks in the restaurant/bar but did check out one suite, which was very nice. No detail is overlooked at this property: the lighting, glassware and even the staff are all there to deliver a unique experience. The bar area reminded me of a scene from a David Lynch movie and there was a cool DJ playing (supposedly every Friday). The wine list was good and not unjustly marked up. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,11,26
34,"Unique, Trendy, Lux Boutique in the Heart of the Gothic Quarter","I personally love staying in small, luxury, boutique hotels, and The Whittmore is a fantastic example of why.  My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights during our trip to Barcelona, and both have nothing but good things to say.

The Wittmore is undoubtedly unique for the area.  If you're looking for a hotel that reflects Spanish/Catalonian culture, consider something else.  If, however, you want a trendy/stylish boutique hotel with fantastic rooftop views of the city, comfortable rooms, a top notch staff, and an excellent location in the heart of Barcelona's Gothic Quarter, this is your place.

A few key points relating to our stay...

-- Rooms are dark and cozy, with red velvet curtains and dim Edison bulb lighting, reminiscent of something Dracula might enjoy if he was an 80s English rock star.

-- The staff was extremely helpful, and made special arrangements in obtaining tickets to the Barcelona Beach Festival for us.  We didn't know this would be happening during our stay, and were really excited when they were able to come though with passes at the last minute.

-- Watch out of the random guys selling beers on the corner outside the hotel, and throughout the gothic quarter.  They're not pushy or overly intimidating, but they're also not there to sell just beer if you catch my drift.  More a comment on the location and not the hotel itself, which frequently had staff outside to guide hotel guests, and keep unsavory characters away...

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at The Wittmore, and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2016,11,21
34,One of my new favourite hotels,"The Wittmore Hotel was a little bit of heaven tucked away in a cul-de-sac alley in the Gothic Quarter. I was travelling alone on business and chose to book what they described as their ""Tiny"" room, which was perfect for me and not really that tiny.

The rooms were beautifully decorated and had every possible luxury you would want from a hotel. The bathroom had everything one would need if they had forgotten their toiletries kit.

The drinks cupboard was supplied with full-sized bottles of most liquor (I didn't partake) and the fridge was full of cool drinks and snacks.

I had dinner at the bar (tapas and beer) while a musician was playing. The restaurant/bar has great ambiance. 

Their staff helped me with a restaurant reservation as well as gave me some really good suggestions on things to see. Service was impeccable and all the staff spoke perfect English, though I appreciated their patience as I practiced my somewhat halting castellano. Special kudos to Tamara.

I have already recommended the Wittmore to my friends who travel to Barcelona and, sin duda, will stay here the next time I am in Barcelona.",5,2016,11,16
34,Fantastic place and location,"Hard to believe the level of service at this hotel.  Personally I have never experienced it before.  This hotel saved us with an opening when we arrived in Barcelona to find our reservations had been cancelled due to a bankruptcy.  Although pricey, pretty much everything about our stay was lovely.  The Bluetooth connection in the room didn't work and we weren't able to get any help from the desk.  Other than that a perfect stay in a 'tiny' room which actually wasn't as tiny as other places we had stayed in Europe.  Highly recommended.",5,2016,11,13
34,Great location & service,"My husband and I stayed in a ""tiny"" room for a couple of days earlier this month (November 2016).  We loved The Whittmore's location in the middle of the Old Town quarter.  There were restaurants and bars all over the place - and easy access to the Metro.  Service was impeccable.  The vibe was very trendy - think of the ""W"" if you're from the United States.  Great bar with live music certain nights.

The room itself, while very small, was laid out just fine.  If you have any sort of work to do, however, the room is not functional.  There is no where to do work on a laptop and the lighting is way, way, way too dark.  I appreciate the ambiance they're trying to create but there should be an option to brighten the room.  My other two complaints are nit-picky but I've stayed in many 5 star hotels and have high expectations.  The blow dryer was cheap (no cool function) and no full-length mirrors - easy fixes.

I recommend this hotel for those looking for a trendy vibe in a great location.  If you like space, definitely get a larger room.  And, if you need to work, inquire about working space in those larger rooms.",4,2016,11,13
34,A Jewel in Barcelona,"We spent two weeks in Spain, ending our trip in Barcelona, and wanted to spend the last four days in luxury. We chose the Wittmore based on reviews in Tripadvisor and were delighted with our choice. The hotel is hidden away in a small calle in the heart of Barcelona, in easy walking distance of many attractions and excellent restaurants. The room, while not huge, was luxurious. The food in the hotel restaurant was excellent. We were lucky to be in Barcelona during a jazz festival and the restaurant had great live performances most nights. 

The best feature of the Wittmore is its staff. Tamara at the desk was extremely helpful to us, finding us great places to eat and providing advice on places to see. The restaurant staff was friendly and helpful in recommending delicious menu choices. 

We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,11,11
34,Amazing Hotel in the centre of Barcelona,"The Wittmore is a real gem, a haven of tranquillity in the heart of the Gothic quarter. Everything is close by from las ramblas to the marina. The hotel is just stunning, rooms are very well appointed and in contrast to their same (small, tiny etc) quite large. The staff are fantastic and a huge thank you to both David and Hanna the concierges who both went out of their way to help arrange and advise. They even booked us into the Jazz club locally. The courtyard is stunning and best of all coffee on the roof terrace overlooking the real roofs of barcelona was so relaxed that one coffee turned into a lovely couple of hours in the Nov sunshine. Cant recommend the hotel highly enough, luxury without the brand blandness of a chain hotel, well appointed, friendly. I work in the travel industry so have stayed at luxury hotels all over the world from Dubai to New York and I can honestly say this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in any city",5,2016,11,11
34,Best find in Barcelona,What a great hotel! Classy and upscale. Very detail oriented owner must have designed this hotel because every detail of the hotel was well thought off from the monogrammed drink napkins to the slippers placed on a laid out towel along with a cold bottle of Evian on your bedside table at turndown service every evening. I'm impressed!,5,2016,11,07
34,Fantastic Boutique Hotel in the lovely Gothic Quarter,"This new Boutique Hotel is what it's all about! I loved that it was tucked in a small alley in the gorgeous Gothic Quarter. 
The hotel itself is beautiful and small. You can choose between different size rooms, we had the tiny room which was good enough. All rooms face have a balcony and face the courtyard. The staff was attentive and extremely nice.
I loved to location as it is close to everything as well as to the El Born neighborhoods that's famous for its nightlife and food. 
If you like intimate hotels with a sexy atmosphere this is the place for you!",5,2016,11,07
34,"Excellent location, facilitites and staff!","The hotel is phenomenal.  It is in an excellent, but somewhat secluded portion of the gothic district, which adds to its charm.  The newly renovated hotel is beyond comfortable, within easy walking distance form all important attractions in the gothic district and Las Ramblas.  Hotel comfort and value were excellent.  Most impressive was its friendly, dedicated and approachable staff.",5,2016,11,03
34,New hotel,"The hotel its self its nice, location not the best in the afternoon or evening. Price too expensive for a small little hotel. Our room was too small, no concierge service and no free transfers. Food its good",3,2016,11,03
34,Modern boutique hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"Located in the Gothic quarter, although a little hard to find, the taxi drivers know where it is and is easy to commute either by taxi or short walk to the Metro station. The hotel is so quaint and has a great old world charm in a modern boutique hotel. The amenities are plentiful and good quality. Daily turndown service with Evian water provided and chocolates. The staff are always polite, helpful and courteous. Great little find, and will definitely go back. It has a beautiful wall garden and the bar/restaurant is also very, very nice. Very comfortable beds too. The rooms are pretty much soundproof - The music playing in the corridors cannot be heard, and I have very sensitive hearing. The only negative is the lack of lighting in the entry area of the room, but it all adds to the atmosphere!",5,2016,11,01
34,"Lovely boutique hotel, central location in Gothic area","Ideal base for city break, newly opened I think. Dark decor and nice lighting, classy feel. Rooms (22) small (I had a ""large"" size one so assume ""tiny"" are very small) and overlook courtyard so noisy with window open but no problem if closed. Nicely equipped - lovely range of bathroom stuff, large walk-in shower (no bath), wireless speaker, minibar although no coffee or iron, beds and bedding perfect. Friendly staff. We didn't eat in hotel at all but has a small classy restaurant with a la carte breakfast and dinner. I guess see reviews for the restaurant (Witty) but menu was basic French/American staples - steak, chicken, boeuf bourgignon etc. Nice small hotel bar and seating at one end of restaurant. Lovely large roof terrace on 2 levels with plunge pool and a waiter - we were only couple up there and nice bonus. A short walk from drop off by cab as in small dead-end street off small pedestrian street. Not signposted nor even had hotel name on building so really difficult to find as also GPS doesn't work properly when down narrow side streets. We paid just over €300 per night for 3 nights. ",5,2016,10,27
34,The perfect hidden gem in Barcelona - Adults Only,"This amazing hotel - Adults only! has only been open for 5 months and it's perfect in every way.
In a very hidden little lane it's not easy to find - but once you've found it you will not want to wonder too far.
We were greeted by David who checked us in and took us around explaining everything.  We fell in love with the outside courtyard - with it's vertical garden attentive staff - especially the charming Maria.
Everything is just perfect with the guest to the fore of all area's. Wonderful seating area's, friendly knowledgeable staff, charming owner who made a point of greeting us daily.  Great cocktails, amazing food and wonderful wines.
It was more like a private member club and you felt honored to be admitted.
Can't wait to go back - thank you for a wonderful, unforgettable stay. Especially David and Maria.",5,2016,10,22
34,Wittmore and more,"Hidden away from the claustrophobic streets of the Gothic district the Wittmore is a quiete understated, haven, with a homely feel.

The excellent staff couldn't do enough for us, always attentive and very professional.

The restaurant served us delicious Spanish dishes with a good variety of International and local wines.

The room (medium sized) was quite and very easy to sleep in, a welcome rest from the busy streets. Furnishings were homely yet understated....basically very comfortable.

Jesus, our restaurant waiter also served us breakfast in our room, he is a great ambassador for the hotel with a great knowledge of both the food and wines.

I had the pleasure of being served one of the best Martinis I've ever tasted in the ""clubby"" cocktail bar,....very impressed!

All in all we would recommend the ""Witty"" to anyone seeking to enjoy the hustle and bustle of Barcelona but need a discreet, comfortable haven to recuperate for the next day!",5,2016,10,21
34,Luxo numa ótima localização ,"This hotel is a great choice in the heart of Barcelona. On my arrival the room was not ready and I had to wait until 3pm. This was not nice! However, overall the staff is extremely helpful and educated, always available to help with anything. The hotel is not cheap but it full of luxury. The bed is really good and the amenities in the room are great. I hardly recommend this place and if I could I will definitely stay here again. Congratulations for the team at the hotel! ",5,2016,10,20
34,Excellent customer service,"I stayed here for my birthday and enjoyed all the amenities of the hotel. The restaurant was delicious, the rooftop bar had incredible views, and the rooms were cozy. This hotel is in a central location; close to Barceloneta, plaza Catalunya, plaza George Orwell, plaza de real, and the metro.",5,2016,10,11
34,A hidden gem!,"Amazing boutique hotel, hidden in the Gothic Quarter.  Small but really well appointed guest rooms.  Great bathroom with luxury bath amenities.    Excellent restaurant and gorgeous courtyard.  Quiet, romantic, dark and elegant.  Love this place!",5,2016,10,11
34,The best hotel in Barcelona ,"This is one the best hotels I have ever been to, and definitely the best choice in Barcelona, especially for a couple.
The service is great, the rooms and decoration are amazing.
Fantastic patio and great rooftop terasse.",5,2016,10,11
34,So worth it. ,Words cannot express how fantastic this hotel is in every way. Every detail is accounted for down to the slippers they leave by your bedside at night. It's a great location near everything Barcelona has to offer. The restaurant is also not to be missed. You will love your stay at this hotel!,5,2016,10,07
34,Honeymoon,"Loved this hotel. Amazing!!!!
Their attention to details, raised the bar for us. It was the first hotel on our honeymoon out of four, and we kept comparing the other hotels to the Wittmore. Even though we got the tiny room; it did not matter. My husband and I both fell in love with it. When they say the room is sound proofed; it is. On our last night there; they had a guest singer in the restaurant/ bar/ court yard which all the rooms face, and the moment we closed our windows, we couldn't hear a thing and we slept through the night.
",5,2016,10,04
34,Sophisticated & stylish,"We've been to Barcelona a few times but never stayed anywhere quite like the Wittmore. It is simply very beautiful. It's small - as most boutique hotels are - and it's pricey. But it oozes comfort, style and five star appeal. Their 'Tiny' rooms, are indeed tiny. But beautifully decorated and the bathroom is real well done. Beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are very quiet. The staff are great on the front desk and the Concierge Team are the best we've come across to date. They recommended restaurants best suited exactly to our taste/mood. The bar is again, tiny, but wonderful - staff are really attentive and happy to spend time chatting about drinks, tastes, etc. It was always busy, which is a slight problem as a guest - sometimes before dinner there simply wasn't anywhere to sit and have a drink as they set every single table up for diners, and the few bar stools and couch area fill up with 2-3 parties in seconds. Location is magnificent. Rooftop great - not super plush (if you want a fancy highline cocktail experience then head to The Grand or the W). We lay there one late afternoon and relaxed, read books, had a beer. Very enjoyable and understated. I would stay in The Wittmore again, no question.",5,2016,09,29
34,Hidden Gem,"This hotel is truly a hidden gem in the heart of the Gothic Quarter.
Location is wonderful having access to all main city highlights within walking distance. While very centrally located this hotel is a peace haven and a great sleep is almost guaranteed. The rooms are beautifully decorated in old classic style and the bathroom is spacious with luxury amenities. Our room looked into the courtyard which made it very peaceful and quiet. 
Service is outstanding and the Concierge was extremely knowledgeable. Definitely recommend to touch base with the staff as they have great insights of the city and are always willing to help.
The hotel is located at the end of a very narrow street which makes it challenging to find in the first place but once you find it you will not regret staying here.
Would certainly go back!",5,2016,09,28
34,What determines quality of service,"After a week in Sitgas I had booked into the Whittmore for the weekend before flying home. I have visited Barcelona several times and love the city always staying in the Gothic area. This time at the Whittmore my taxi driver dropped me off and waved in the hotels genaral direction. Got hopelessly lost. At a restaurant the""Palosanto"" phoned the hotel and they sent a porter to find me which he did. Client service level always greatly influences my hotel judgement. 
My room being a single traveler looked out onto to central courtyard, very pleaant. The breakfast quality and service superb, I had the continental for me super. Had dover sole one evening and the flavours lingering in the pllate.
The reception and service levels of a quality for my next visit to Barcelona that I booked and paid for on departure. To me that indicates your approval.
One critism for health reasons I walk up and down from my room, please on the landings give to floor level.
On leaving get the hotel to book your taxi, I prebooked mine and it was an uphill walk to find the location. Fortunatly again the hotel came to my rescue with a porter dragging any case.",5,2016,09,19
34,Awesome hotel!,"First class experience all the way! Tucked away down a little street, we got a tad lost and calls the hotel. We were so close but missed it and the bellman came and got us! Carried our luggage the rest of the way and greeted with water and chocolate. The hotel is very well decorated and truly pleases all the senses. The smell, look and artistic decor along with the great service- truly top notch.

The room was stocked with designer amenities, comfortable bed and a mini bar that had everything you would need. Concierge was friendly and breakfast in the restaurant was delicious. 

When we visit Barcelona again- we will be staying here. Highly recommend- well worth the price!",5,2016,09,17
34,The Witty Awesome Bar,"I was staying in the hotel and came to the Witty everyday I was staying here!, I have tried the best cocktails ive ever had! I highly recommend this place. Patxi the cocktail master is very nice and on point with the drinks, always with a smile while he does his thing. If you like cocktails definitely you have to try The Witty.

",5,2016,09,15
34,Superb,"Tucked away in a quiet side alley, narrow even by the standards of the Gothic quarter, is this absolute gem.   Recently converted into a hotel, everything is new and yet has been carefully designed to feel antique.   We stayed in the smallest of the four room sizes - the room itself was small, but the bed was large and the bathroom more generous, and there was a narrow entrance hall with a closet and a great minibar.  The roof deck is a lovely spot to enjoy the real views of Barcelona - both the grand architecture and vistas and the next door apartments' laundry !   The    ground floor public areas are charming, built around a central courtyard, the food is very good and the service from all staff is outstanding.   Just be aware that while getting a taxi to the hotel is possible, it takes a few minutes more than usual given the narrow alleys - better to walk for a couple of minutes to the nearest main road and hail one there.  Overall, while its not cheap, this is a superb hotel for a romantic break, if you appreciate the charm of the location.",5,2016,09,06
34,Can't recommend highly enough!,"I'm just home from 6 nights at the Wittmore, and I have to say it's one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in. Everything about it feels high-end, from the furnishings to the incredible staff. It really does feel like the perfect oasis in the maze of little streets in the gothic quarter. As soon as you step in through the front door, you feel welcome and relaxed. The staff are lovely and so friendly and helpful. I had a 'tiny' room, and was expecting it to be very small, but I was amazed at how spacious it was. Have a G&T on the roof and watch the sunset across the city. Utterly beautiful. As the title says, I really can't recommend this hotel highly enough. I absolutely love it and will definitely stay here again when I return to Barcelona.",5,2016,09,05
34,"Once you're there, it's heaven.  A wonderful property.","We found the Wittmore Hotel to be a diamond in the rough - a wonderful high-end boutique hotel in the middle of the Gothic quarter where much of the spots are touristy and not first-rate.

The Wittmore is an impeccably appointed wonderful hotel and what made it really stand out was the staff.  Everyone that worked there was so gracious, accommodating and anticipatory.  I am in the middle of marathon training and would come back from my early morning runs with a bottle of cold water and a towel waiting for me with the concierge.  

The restaurant served outstanding food and we got to know many of the staff.  The specialty drinks are delicious.  

Overall, it was a wonderful experience.

Couple things to highlight:

* The neighborhood is specific.  If you're interested in the hot happening area - the ""East Village"" of Barcelona, and you want something quieter, you should head uptown.  If you want hot and happening, this is the spot.

* You'll need Google Maps or some kind of navigator.  It's difficult for taxis to get to the hotel and some of the roads are too narrow so you often walk from Laietana.  All good though.

Really, the staff and the furnishings and the decor made this so memorable we really can't speak highly enough of our experience.",5,2016,09,04
34,Barcelona's secret luxury hotel,"My 3-night stay at this hotel was just 10/10. The hotel is tucked away in an alley in the gothic quarter, which is probably not the nicest neighbourhood in Barcelona, but it makes for a very quiet and peaceful stay. The interior decor was very stylish and reminded me so much of the Chiltern Firehouse in London. The room was clean and luxurious, with great attention to detail. Bathroom amenities were among the finest of luxury 5-star hotels. Most importantly, however, the staff are so accommodating to your every need and go out of their way to make your stay fantastic. Special thanks to the concierge, David, who recommended great restaurants. Everything was perfect.",5,2016,09,04
34,Great EVERYTHING ,"Our stay at The Wittmore made our Barcelona trip perfect. The staff is so accommodating to your every need. Very helpful in helping us plan including booking special tours. Every meal we had there was great. Bartender makes great Old Fashion and knows which wines go with your meal. The terrace has some fabulous views of the city. The rooms are super clean and the attention to detail is remarkable. The hygiene products they provide are first class. In general we recommend this to anyone as the staff makes it right and the property is so clean, stylish and new. ",5,2016,09,03
34,Superb hotel,"Just returned from spending 3 fantastic nights at the Wittmore. Great location, tucked away in the gothic area. A small hotel which is stylishly decorated, good sized rooms and comfortable bed. Very peaceful and quiet. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooftop terrace and pool is an added luxury, great way to relax after a day site seeing. Would definitely recommend the Wittmore",5,2016,08,27
34,could be better,"2 nights beginning of august, good features and style all round the hotel. location didn't like, our taxi lost 15 minutes to find it. didn't know the hotel. going around at night its not suggested. 2people stop us to sell drugs or maybe beer. room its nice but on the small side for us",3,2016,08,24
34,"Something different, what a find!","Everything about this hotel is first class and fully deserves its 5 stars. Tucked away in its own side street but easy enough to find it is well located and central enough to areas such as El Born and a short walk to Barceloneta. Upon our arrival we were upgraded to a suite which was beautifully appointed and probably the quietest room we have ever been in. We were also allowed a very late checkout on our day of departure which meant we were able to get a full day in Barcelona and a few more hours on the sun deck on the Hotel roof terrace. This is a real hidden gem with fantastic views of the city and serving an excellent list of cocktails. All of the staff at The Whittmore are excellent, helpful and knowledgable of the area and the food in the hotel restuarant, The Whitty, is very good indeed. 

Can't recommend this hotel any higher.",5,2016,08,21
34,Perfection at The Wittmore,"Just returned with my family of 7 from a 2 night post cruise stay in Barcelona at The Wittmore. I work in the travel industry and have stayed at hundreds of hotels around the globe and can say without a doubt this is the nicest boutique hotel I've been to.  This is a new property in the heart of the gothic area of Barcelona with just 22 rooms. The restaurant in this hotel The Witty is just as fabulous.  Everybody we met that works here is very professional and without question the nicest people you could meet. And one of the best parts is a 2 story, roof top wading pool and deck. The views of the city were priceless. The only complaint we had was that our stay had to end.  Do yourself a huge favor next time you are in Barcelona..Stay here!  You will not regret it!!",5,2016,08,18
34,A hidden gem in the Gothic district,"This hotel has everything you would want in an elevated boutique hotel: location,  charm, attentive and knowledgeable staff and a hip lobby bar. I should also mention at roof terrence with a stunning view.",5,2016,08,17
34,Excellent all the way! ,"Excellence is the best word to describe this hotel.
Located in a narrow street where you wouldn't expect this pearl, a professional doorman greets you.
The moment you enter the Wittmore, you know you are in good hands. 
The reception doesn't feel like a reception. Highly trained and extremely friendly staff welcome you and check you in within a second. Water and sweets are offered and presented in beautiful glassware on a silver plate.
It feels genuine, nice and lovely. I knew my short 3 day holiday in this place would be a luxury treat. 
As we arrived late, we decided to have dinner in the hotels restaurant. It found out to be an excellent choice. Again all staff so friendly, smiling and very well aware of how to make you feel good. They have an inner patio with a wall covered in plants! Really stunning. 
The whole experience matched, from service, to interior, music, cutlery, food,......
The hotel houses a rooftop refreshing small pool and sunbathing amenities. 
As the hotel is adults only, you are not surrounded with screaming and yelling kids.
The room was in excellent condition, soundproof and superior bedding. All amenities are luxury standards.

I have visited many hotels, but the hotel and service level of the Wittmore was one of the best in years.

A very personal and stylish hotel with an exquisite level of service and focus on details. Congratulations.

",5,2016,08,15
34,A hidden gem...,"My boyfriend and I just stayed 4 night in a ""tiny"" room at The Wittmore and we were blown away. Even thought the room was called ""tiny"" we had enough space and really enjoyed it. The service is the best - two times housekeeping a day and the rooftop was the best place to end your day before going out for dinner. Their Dry Martini was the best I have ever tasted. We are definitely coming back. The only "" bad"" thing is that the breakfast is not included and it is a bit pricy, so we ate next door at a lovely brunch cafe. ",5,2016,08,12
34,Very nice hotel,"We stayed in the hotel in July and we find it a great hotel and will come back for sure on our next visit to Barcelona. We booked two rooms as we had our teenagers with us and the hotel arranged it that we had connecting rooms. Personal was very friendly, I also liked the style of the hotel. And also important is that you don't hear any noice of the outside. The terrace inside the hotel is also nice and on top of the roof you can relax and enjoy the view over Barcelona. It is also sitiuated close to the ramblas and in the neighberhood you find very nice local shops. The only thing which I should advice is to put a sign of the hotel in the other street, as the hotel is in a street that is not accessible with the car we had some small problems on finding it with our gps, so we parked our car in a nearby underground public parking space. Maybe the hotel should send an e-mail to the guest to inform them about it. But for the rest I have no negative comments.",5,2016,08,11
34,Excellent location and superbe service,"We have discovered the hotel by chance and are really delighted. The hotel is perfectly situated in the gothic quarter and close to the beaches. The rooms are outstanding, very well equipped (I have hardly seen a better garnished mini-bar), the bed is very comfortable and the design is clean and new. The cocktail bar is excellent and not overpriced as you could have expected. The breakfast was delicious, however the room service was over 20 minutes late, so be aware in case you have urgent appointments planned.",5,2016,08,09
34,Best Kept Secret in Barcelona,"I cannot say enough about the amazing Wittmore Hotel Barcelona.  Every moment of our stay was absolutely stellar from the adventure of finding the secret location, to the warm welcome upon arriving, to the pristine and extremely comfortable room, to the 5-star meals, to the best cocktails in Barcelona and finally to the staff and management, who exceeded our every expectation.  Our concierge, David was outstanding in every way and quite instrumental in making our experience in Barcelona a remarkable one.  We relied on him for advice on navigating the city, booking reservations for museums and tourist attractions, and directing us to the best paella in Barcelona!  The roof-top ""cocktail pool"" was the perfect way to end our days after traversing the city and absorbing all the beauty of Barcelona. Oliver, our host at the pool,was there to see to it that we were relaxed, happy and comfortable.  Meals at The Wittmore are something you won't want to miss.  Chef Albert Ventura has created a masterpiece of delights in each menu.  He graciously came to meet us and I was able to personally thank him for his exceptional talent.  We ended each evening with a visit to the bar to witness the amazing creativity and genius of Barcelona's top mixologist, Patxi.  His creation,""Oaxaca Velvet"" is incredible!  Thank you to General Manager, Pilar Riera for overseeing this wonderful establishment and for spending our last evening in Barcelona with us.  We will never forget our time at The Wittmore.",5,2016,08,05
34,Perfect experience for Barcelona,"This hotel has got everything right.  The location is wonderful for a great Barcelona experience.  The room was extremely peaceful and the staff were the most helpful of any staff of any hotel we have ever stayed in.  The rooms are a bit small though.

This is a true 5 star hotel with a 5 star experience.",5,2016,07,31
34,The best romantic hotel of Barcelona,"We've stayed in many good hotels in Barcelona within 15 years. Now the Wittmore is the best one for us. It's a new hotel at the heart of Barcelona near the Gothic district and La Rambla. Very clean rooms; excellent bed; nice design style of 1930; perfect breakfast; etc. If you want to plunge in the times of the film ""Great Gatsby"" settle here",5,2016,07,31
34,amazing place to say in Barcelona,"Tucked into an alley in the middle of the gothic quarter in Barcelona, this hotel was amazing. When you walk into the hotel, it is like stepping into a speakeasy. The rooms are very well appointed and the amenities (soap, razor, toothbrush) are well thought out. If you forgot something, it is likely that it is already in your room waiting for you! The location for the hotel make it a great place to walk around and enjoy the sites in Barcelona. Georgio and Chavi (hope I spelled that right) were excellent as well! I will be back for sure! The roof top deck is not to be missed!",5,2016,07,24
34,Just excellent!,"Located in an off-street in the Gothic Quarter, the hotel is almost undetectable. I could see it being difficult to locate first time without GPS/internet - but was a breeze for us with Google Maps. 

We had the ""Tiny"" room, which was indeed tiny and slightly dim, but still enjoyable and very positively cosy. The bathroom is also a decent size. The details of the furnishings from the toiletries, the comfy bathrobes, great Marshall speaker(with AUX cable - a surprise since a lot of other hotels have the older iPod docks that are no longer compatible) and the turn down service. 

Service is Absolutely Exemplary!! From concierge, (who helped us with all our restaurant reservations) through to the courtyard restaurant, to the rooftop pool. Everyone is super attentive and does their utmost to ensure the most comfortable stay. Breakfast is also well done. 

The rooftop pool area is a peaceful paradise in bustling Barcelona. It wasn't nearly half as busy as another 5* hotel rooftop pool we visited that our friends had stayed at. Thus giving us the chance to enjoy the personal service with our evening cocktails. 

We just cannot wait to return!!",5,2016,07,20
34,As beautiful as the City,"I was amazed, service was superb, amenities amazing, location incredible, I will be back!  I can not say enough wonderful things about this hotel.  I am only sad that my stay was not longer.  I felt like I was at a spa with the bathroom amenities, comfy robes and slippers, the turn down service.  It was perfect!  I can't not say one negative thing!
And the tallest garden in Barcelona.... nice touch!",5,2016,07,15
34,Fantastic and a classy!,"This hotel is just lovely. Comfy, generous rooms, fantastic restaurant, classy and inviting atmosphere, beautiful rooftop deck and pool, and attentive, helpful staff. Loved it!

Located in the awesome Barrio Gotico neighborhood, amidst the beautiful, old windy streets, it's surrounded by tapas bars and shops. Seriously, stay here! :)",5,2016,07,14
34,Beautiful! ,"Literally a hidden gem at the end of an ally in the gothic quarter. Impeccable design, amazingly friendly staff & beautiful  guest rooms. Even the rooftop is an oasis.

34,Amazing place ,"Stunning hotel.. Very 'chiltern firehouse.' Amazing ambience and great / friendly / helpful staff. Rooms are very comfortable and I love all the little extra features in the room..

Can't recommend enough. ",5,2016,07,02
34,Stunning ,"Absolutely amazing hotel

First time in Barcelona - I booked a tiny room which may sound off putting but was AMAZING

the staff are phenomenal and helpful! 

Nothing is too much trouble

And believe me the room had everything you can wish for and more! 

The lovely Italian girl on the bar suggests the BEST cocktails - I had a smoky gin one! You must try it!! 

Make sure you use all the hotel facilities and pay a visit to the roof top !!",5,2016,06,18
34,Understatedly stylish,"Stayed here for one night in a very well appointed room overlooking a courtyard.  
Made to feel exceptionally comfortable and slept in possibly the most comfortable bed I have ever been in.
The service was second to none from all staff encountered and I am looking forward to going back sometime soon.",5,2016,06,10
34,PERFECTION,"This hotel is INCREDIBLE. The staff were amazing, every single person we met was happy to help us, or provide advice, or make us an excellent cocktail! They made us feel special and welcome and were just the best staff. Our room was gorgeous, wonderful style and excellent amenities and toiletries. The food was wonderful, and the location is great. FAULTLESS.",5,2016,06,07
34,wonderful Hotel but the restaurant is disappointing.,"We stayed at the wittmore couple of nights because  the Adele's concert . The hotel is wonderful and the room is nice and the bed is very comfortable , I can see they spent alot of effort to trying to make this hotel as welcoming as possible , we like the idea of the hotel and it location , although is a little difficult trying to our taxi there because it is in a very small street. but over all It is a good hotel.
What I do not like tho , is the restaurant, Firstly , the music is too loud and too poppy for it style .. I barely hear the conversation when they playing some lady Gaga music at the dinner time, if it was chillout music I understand , but LadyGaga and some top 50 music I think are belong to bars but not a fine dinning restaurant. ...
About the food , my opinion is very average .   the roast beef is too thin and cold and the pork ribs were nothing special , the pasta dish and the fish dish were tasteless , sorry to say I am very disappointing in the overall experience. 
with such a lovely hotel , they need a better restaurant to match with. 

one last thing , this hotel have a no children policy .. I have a friend wanted to book a week of holiday with them but they rejected him .. what a shame.",4,2016,06,06
34,Excellent weekend!,"The Wittmore hotel is nice and cosy – at first it might be a big contrast to sunny and crowded Barcelona, but after few hours in the city you come back to the hotel like to a real oasis of peace and quiet. 
You can have a proper night sleep in a super comfy bed (window shutters!).
The rooftop is tiny but that proves to be a plus, since you can comfortably rest and enjoy the sun.
We only ate breakfasts at the hotel restaurant but we can definitely recommend it.

The housekeeping does an AMAZING job, bathrooms are fully equipped which is rare in most of 5 star hotels and both bathrobes and slippers are pure heaven to wear.

Overall: we had an amazing time!",5,2016,05,31
34,Beautiful,"wow. What more can I say, apart from the staff couldn't do enough; they even came to our rescue when we got lost. Everything was gorgeous. Attention to detail. Serene atmosphere. Ask them anything and they'll sort it.",5,2016,05,29
34,Coldplay Concert,"Best hotel in Barcelona, fantastic friendly staff, beds are so comfortable. Great location, and the restaurant is cool with a good vibe. Reminds me of Hotel Costes in Paris but smaller. Also reasonably priced, and will definitely return. ",5,2016,05,28
34,Highly recommended restaurant,"Restaurant with exquisite decoration, exclusive atmosphere with live DJ and food from other countries with Spanish fusion on par with everything else. The service was very nice. I recommend the chocolate brioche for dessert. We will be back!",5,2024,05,26
34,gastronomic art,"Excellent food, high-level dishes worthy of a 5* hotel. It is the perfect place within the Gothic Quarter to find an oasis of luxury and a surprising culinary experience. We will definitely return to try more dishes ;)",5,2024,05,04
34,Restaurant of 10!,Magnificent restaurant. Very elaborate cuisine with very successful and perfectly combined flavors. The atmosphere created in the room is very cozy. The staff who assisted us was very attentive and always suggested the best options. We will be back!!!,5,2024,04,09
34,SPECTACULAR RESTAURANT WITH SURPRISING MENU,"We have eaten at the restaurant for a work lunch. It's really spectacular. The atmosphere is very cozy (beautiful interior patio); the letter is surprising; The service is impeccable and very friendly and the quality of the product is wonderful. We have liked everything we have ordered, and especially: the roast croquettes (we have even repeated), the tuna tartar channel (delicious!) and the chateaubriand cooked in clay is one of the most succulent meat dishes we have ever had. I've eaten in a long time. As for dessert, I would highlight the tirmasu, a classic dessert but one that really nails it. It has truly been worth it and I will try to return soon, next night.",5,2024,04,09
34,A good restaurant,"I have had the opportunity to eat at the restaurant. A great place to stop if someone is moving through the area. The attention they have given us is very good. A reasonable range of dishes and a good wine list. What we have eaten, very good. I think we have all left very satisfied.",5,2024,04,09
34,Excellent food and treatment. I would repeat,"Excellent food and service. The roast croquettes, the tuna tartare cannelloni and the chateaubriand are essential.
Of the
Dessert highlighted the lemon cake
The cava and dish recommendations were very accurate.
Highly recommended and if I can I will return.",5,2024,04,09
34,Excellent food and atmosphere,"We went to the restaurant for dinner, they welcomed us very well and when we entered we noticed the nice atmosphere, with good music, calm and elegant. We tried starter, main dishes and post, all impeccable. The presentation and flavor of the dishes were surprising. Above all we highlight the crayfish carpaccio and the lamb. We had a beautiful night. We went up to see the views from the roof and we loved it. The location of the premises is perfect. We will be back for sure, highly recommended!",5,2024,03,21
34,"Perfect combination of atmosphere, music, tranquility, stylish decoration. Excellent food and good price.","We had dinner at Contraban on a Friday night and the experience was perfect both in atmosphere and food. There was live music from a DJ that allowed you to have a conversation where you could hear well and at the same time listen to music that gave a very good atmosphere. The food is very good. Both the quality and the presentation and concept of the menu. The crayfish carpaccio and the macaroni and the chocolate brioche are my favorites. And to finish we were able to stay having something quietly until the time we wanted because being a hotel you have that peace of mind. It is a perfect plan for dinner for two or with friends because the atmosphere is intimate, quiet, there are people but it doesn't feel crowded and it is a special experience.",5,2024,03,18
34,A hidden gem with great service,"A weekend as a couple in Wittmore is like getting away from the noise of Barcelona in a secret place.

The hotel still smells new and has different areas to spend time: the library, the garden (a beauty) or a fantastic roof top with views of the port.

The best the service. They are all super friendly and in the restaurant the attention is total. We asked for some recommendations and they were all a hit. Thank you very much, we will definitely return!",5,2024,03,17
34,A picturesque place where you can eat the best secret macaroni in the world :-D,"Today I discovered the CONTRABANDO restaurant at the Wittemore Hotel and I was amazed by all the senses. I loved the decoration of the tables, the craftsmanship of the dishes and especially the detail of the ceramic dogs on the table. Super cool. But one of the things I liked the most is the macaroni dish with a secret, I think it is the most delicious macaroni dish I have ever eaten. I also highly recommend the rustit cannelloni, a typical Catalan dish and very suitable at Christmas parties. The treatment of the waiters has been impeccable, affectionate and very fast, nothing to add. It has been a great choice to celebrate the Christmas dinner of our creative project.",5,2023,12,20
34,Cozy & Tasty,"Super cozy hotel, with exquisite staff and attention.

The Contraban restaurant is a must, be sure to try the assortment of hummus and the Iberian secret macaroni.",5,2023,12,20

34,Un oasis escondido en el Gótico,"
Fui a comer al fantástico restaurante (Contraban) del hotel Wittmore con un amigo y la experiencia no pudo ser mejor. Al entrar, el personal de recepción te saludan amablemente y te indican la dirección del restaurante. Tras una cortina, encontramos una sala preciosa y en medio un patio con un jardín vertical espectacular. Decidimos comer ahí. A pesar de los casi 40 grados que hacía en la calle, ahí disfrutamos de un fresco extraordinario. Nos recomendaron un menú cerrado (Executive) en el que había una (genial) selección de platos de la carta que acompañamos con unas cervezas. Simplemente, un 10!

34,Increíble,"Fuimos un fin de semana al hotel Wittmore y lo hemos pasado genial. Desde el primer momento el personal ha sido muy atento con nosotros, y el lugar en si es increíble. La decoración es original y el lugar está impecable. Nuestra habitación daba a un patio interior muy tranquilo y entraba sol y por la noche, el ambiente era tan relajante como necesitábamos. Una noche bajamos a cenar al restaurante Contraban, nos atendió Andrea y nos explicó muy bien los platos que probamos, que por cierto estaban exquisitos. Lo recomiendo mucho para quien quiera descansar unos días en la ciudad de Barcelona!",5,2023,01,24
34,Hotel digno de un 10,"El fin de semana pasado, yo y mi pareja estuvimos alojados en el hotel. Somos de Premiá de Dalt, por tanto no habíamos visto mucho la zona. 
La localización del hotel es maravillosa y super acojedora. Es increíble, representa ese rastro de luz entre todo el caos que hay en el barrio Gótico de Barcelona. 
Tanto yo como mi mujer, queremos dar las gracias a Lucía, de recepción, que nos ha acogido, hecho reir y nos ha hecho sentir como en casa.

En recepción me atendió Lucia, una muchacha muy amable. La comida exquisita, recomiendo en especial el carpaccio de cigala. En cuanto al servicio, debo destacar la atención de los camareros, Rene, Felipe y Andrea; fueron muy atentos y me hicieron sentir muy a gusto, además me resolvieron todas las dudas sobre la ciudad de Barcelona.

34,Expectativas superada!,"Hotel excelente! nos ha encantado todo, limpieza absoluta, agradecemos a Yisira, camarera de pisos por el servicio prestado y por estar siempre atenta a todo. En la recepción nos recibió Verónica y Fran, nos propusieron excursiones, actividades y reservas de restaurantes. Aparte de estar pendientes siempre de todas nuestras necesidades durante la estancia.  
 La comida y cócteles del restaurante son muy buenos, pero lo mejor de todo es el personal. Tanto en la recepción como el en bar/restaurante todos son muy amables, te hacen sentir a gusto y te dan un trato maravilloso. Superaron nuestras expectativas! Volveremos",5,2023,01,12
34,Una perla escondida en el Gótico,"Decidí alojarme en este hotel escondido en la zona baja del Gótico buscando una opción íntima y especial, y además unos amigos nos lo recomendaron especialmente. La verdad es que la experiencia superó de lejos las expectativas... a la llegada, el trato de los chicos de la recepción fue impecable, nos trataron excepcionalmente bien desde el primer minuto; nos invitaron a tomar un cocktail en la zona de bar del Contraban y la verdad es que el barman Bruno nos encandiló con sus propuestas de autor, un 10! Luego, teníamos planeado salir a cenar fuera pero finalmente decidimos quedarnos ahí mismo, ya que estábamos pasando un rato genial y, cuando vimos la carta (chef Alain Guiard) nos sedujo por la vista y, después, al paladar! Bestial!! Y para rematar la noche, de repente nos anuncian que una DJ se ponía a los platos para amenizar el final de la noche... no pudimos estar más encantados: disfrutando de una copa en un ambiente super cool y con un confort increíble frente a la chimenea! Y la guinda llegó con el maravilloso descanso de su exclusiva habitación Large. Habíamos reservado una habitación más pequeña pero al llegar nos ofrecieron un upgrade que nos pareció genial, ya que se trataba de una ocasión muy especial... y finalmente, acabó siendo una noche inolvidable. A la mañana siguiente, mientras disfrutábamos del desayuno, pudimos conocer al director del Hotel (David) que nos pareció un tipo encantador y súper cercano. No tardaremos en volver por el Wittmore aunque sea para tomar algo, antes de que sea imposible reservar mesa",5,2023,01,10

34,Ristorante Contraban piacevole sorpesa,"Sono stato a mangiare al ristornate  Contraban assieme a dei colleghi che lavorano come me da parecchi anni nel turismo e nell'hospitality. 

Devo ammettere che siamo rimasti piacevolmente sorpesi non solo dall'eccellente servizio ma dalla qualita della materia prima (la pasta squisita, ve lo garantisce un italiano) e dalla delicatezza nella presentazione del piatto. 

Non potro mai ringraziare abbastanza Veronica di ""Events Department""  che mi ha convinto ed aiutato ad organizzare questa cena che é stato un piccolo trionfo sotto tanti aspetti.

Complimenti a tutti e a presto.",5,2023,01,08

Es un hotel agradable y tranquilo. Con unos trabajadores excepcionales.
Habitaciones limpias, acogedoras con un mini bar variado de gran calidad.
A destacar; la coctelería y la chica de recepción, por su gran trato tan carismático como pro activo, ya buscando actividades durante nuestra estancia o recomendándonos puntos de interés por la zona. 
Muy recomendable, tanto por la gran atención por parte de ella, como por el maravilloso e delicioso restaurante.

34,Unterschiedliche Eindrücke…,"Zunächst einmal: das Hotel liegt sehr zentral in der Altstadt. Sobald man es betritt meint man in einem Kühlschrank zu schauen, sehr schummriges Licht, allein der Aufzug mit einer 20 W Birne beleuchtet, ich hab immer gedacht ich hätte meine Sonnenbrille auf gelassen… War allerdings ein Element für den Style, auch die Zimmer insgesamt sehr dunkel, Arbeitslicht gab es nicht. Das Internet insgesamt sehr langsam, die Daten tröpfeln im Sekunden Takt in den Rechner. Wir hatten eins der schönsten Zimmer eine Suite im fünften Stock, sehr schön, sehr ruhig, edel ausgestattet, guter Service. Insgesamt das Personal sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Frühstück super, man muss allerdings etwas Zeit mitbringen. Negatives Erlebnis: wir kamen nach einem schönen Tag abends in die Bar und wollte noch einen Drink nehmen. Unser Wunsch nach einem Mai Tai wurde aufgenommen, die Bar war ziemlich gut bestückt… Die Kellnerin besprach sich mit einem Kollegen der sie ziemlich barsch darauf hin wies, dass bei diesem Andrang in der Bar Extrawünsche nicht möglich wären, sie drückte uns daraufhin eine Karte in die Hand mit Cocktails, die Auswahl war sicherlich nicht fünf Sterne wert, sondern diese Cocktails, die auf der Karte standen hätten wir auch am Strand bei den fliegenden Händlern erwerben können. Obwohl der Dachgarten bis 22:00 Uhr geöffnet war, wurde um 21:45 Uhr schon mal als Signal das Licht ausgeschaltet für kurze Zeit, dann kam die Bedienung und wies uns darauf hin dass sie gleich schließen würde. Man erklärte uns hinterher wegen des Lärms, man könne die Dachterrasse nicht über Nacht öffnen, wir wollten aber eigentlich nur auf den Sonnenliegen dort oben liegen und lesen und unseren Wein genießen, wir hätten sicherlich nicht gelärmt, schade!
Also insgesamt ein Aufenthalt für mehrere Tage mit zwiespältigen Gefühlen, das Hotel nominell fünf Sterne, aber eigentlich vier Sterne plus aber die Lage zählt eben in diesem Geschäft.",3,2022,06,04
34,Klein und fein,"Feines, kleines Hotel mit Liebe zum Detail. Tolles Frühstück,wunderschöne und gemütliche Bar und Lesebereich.das beste sind die Mitarbeiter,die alle stets freundlich sind! Wir waren leider im März hier, die Terrasse soll auch wunderschön sein.",5,2022,03,20
34,Ambiente muy agradable,"El personal de recepción nos atendió perfectamente y el de sala muy atentos. Nos acompañaron a la mesa. Eramos un grupo grande y estuvieron muy pendientes de todo.
¡Una experiencia fantástica, repetiremos seguro!",5,2022,02,19
34,El personal un 10,"La atención y el servicio en el restaurante sin duda es lo mejor que hay en el hotel.
La comida es perfecta.... todo en su perfecto punto. 
El patio interior tiene una atmosfera muy acogedora.
La habitaciones cómodas, silenciosas y escuras.
Hemos notado la falta de cepillos de diente en los amenities del baño.",4,2020,01,25
34,No tienen Champagne frío. ,"Un hotel fantástico, con un interiorismo difícil de superar pero pido una copa de Champagne y me responden que no tienen Champagne frío, que tome cava. Que si quiero Champagne me tengo que esperar a que se enfríe. 
Finalmente me conformo con un Verdejo, frío eso si. 
Un detalle imperdonable en un hotel de este nivel. 
Difícil que vuelva por mucho que la agencia de comunicación que los lleva me insista. ",3,2019,12,26

34,"Rincón único, dónde falta el trato único","Un hotel único en Barcelona, escondido en un callejón del Barri Gótic, dónde se puede disfrutar de una tranquilidad exclusiva. Decoración cuidada al detalle al más puro estilo inglés; todo perfecto. Se agradecería un poco más de luz tanto en los pasillos como en la habitación. La terraza es un remanso de paz. Tomamos café mientras disfrutamos del sol .

Un desayuno delicioso, pero sorprende que en un hotel de cinco estrella no tengan un periódico para leer mientras desayunas. Ni español, ni inglés, ni francés ... simplemente no hay periódico. Algo inaudito en un hotel. Más sorprendente es que el desayuno no incluya agua. En el Wittmore se desayuna con un vaso de zumo y como pidas agua, te sorprenderán con una cuenta de 6€. Pequeños detalles, que hacen que un hotel encantador no deje un recuerdo único.",4,2019,01,20
34,Un posto magico nella Barcellona Gotica,"È già la seconda volta che io e il mio compagno ceniamo al Wittmore, una cucina senza troppe pretese, essenziale ma buona...il posto è meraviglioso, romantico, da coppia...in mezzo alle stradine di una Barcellona gotica e misteriosa.
Il personale è eccezionale, tutti gentili, simpatici e cordiali...servizio impeccabile.",5,2018,12,29
34,Hidden Gem!,"Versteckt in der Altstadt findet sich dieses stylishe Adults-only Hotel. Eine Oase - der schattige Innenhof, ein idealer Platz zum Relaxen bei tropischen Sommertemperaturen in Barcelona. Der hängende Garten samt seiner Bewässerung sorgt zusätzlich für Kühlung (und Befeuchtung, es tröpfelt ganz angenehem immer mal von oben auf's Haupt des Gastes). Der Service war auf Zack, die Portionen im Witty's Restaurant leider recht klein. Die Preise sind durchaus gehoben. Man braucht auch wirklich 3 Gänge, um satt zu werden. Der preiswerte Hauswein war aus, aber es gab einen Ersatz, der nur unwesentlich teurer war. Alles in allem: ein magischer Ort, den man sich dann und wann gönnen sollte, wenn man was zu feiern hat. Oder wenn man beruflich ein schönes Reisebudget zur Verfügung hat!",5,2018,08,04
34,Maravillosa celebración. 25 Aniversario,"El lunes 9 de julio celebramos nuestro 25 aniversario en el Hotel Wittmore. Organicé una cena sorpresa con mi familia y luego, mi marido y yo, nos quedamos a dormir. Fue una maravillosa celebración.
El trato del personal fue muy atento y muy profesional. Encantadores todos. La cena en el patio del restaurante con el jardín vertical muy agradable. Hotel con mucho encanto, con un toque Inglés - Parisino muy elegante. Sensación de estar de viaje en tu propia ciudad. Muuuuy recomendable!!!!
Gracias a todos por hacer que nuestro aniversario fuera tan especial!!!",5,2018,07,15

34,Verstecktes Juwel,"Klein und fein, das sind Attribute, die auf dieses Hotel wirklich zutreffen. In einer kleinen Sackgasse im Barri Gotic, nicht leicht zu finden, aber von der Post aus nicht ganz so schwierig. Die Zimmer sind nicht allzu groß, das Bad dafür schon und alles topp ausgestattet. Leider waren die Temperaturen für einen Aufenthalt auf der schönen Dachterrasse noch zu kalt. Die Sauberkeit ist exzellent, das Personal kompetent und sehr freundlich. Auch die Lage ist wirklich gut, alles ist in ein paar Gehminuten erreichbar. Für uns war es ein perfekter Aufenthalt. Muchas gracias!",5,2018,03,22

34,Es como encontrar un tesoro,"Al principio pensé que no iba a estar tan bueno, porque como que la llegada es algo extraña, pero la verdad esta increíble todo en este hotel.  
El personal muy atentos en todo, y el cuarto estaba espectacular. La única recomendación es que igual y pudieran agregar un poco de luz a los cuartos porque cuando tuve que empacar me costaba trabajo un poco ver. La cama creo que es la mejor en la que he estado en mi vida, ojala si alguien del hotel lee esto me diga cual marca es que esta buenísima.",5,2017,10,02
34,IMPRESIONANTE!,"Estuvimos mi pareja y yo el fin de semana. Impresionante desde el principio. La llegada, las atención de Giorgio, la habitación espectacular (406).

Uno de los mejores ambientes en los que hemos disfrutado más.",5,2017,09,11
34,Keine 5 Sterne GL.. zu teuer in Relation zu anderen Hotels ,"Das Personal ist freundlich, das Hotel ist relativ neu eingerichtet und sauber. Die Lage meines Erachtens nicht optimal. In der Altstadt versteckt in einer dunklen Gasse muss man am Morgen über das ein oder andere Erbrochene steigen. 
Insgesamt ist das Hotel sehr dunkel. Die Terrasse ist nett... aber von einem Pool kann nicht die Rede sein. Ein Fußbecken vielleicht. Das Frühstück war in Ordnung. 
Parkmöglichkeiten katastrophal. Es gibt ein öffentliches Parkhaus welches nicht die Öffnungszeiten einhält. Das führte dazu, dass wir nicht an unser Auto kamen und ein Taxi nehmen mussten. Entschuldigungen helfen da auch nicht wirklich viel... ",3,2017,09,10
34,Buen servicio,"Fuimos a la terraza de la azotea a tomar algo. Sitio recomendable, bonito y con un servicio estupendo y atento. Bebida por un precio asequible teniendo en cuenta que es un hotel de 5 estrellas. Muy agradable para ir en pareja.",5,2017,05,26

El hotel tiene un pequeño jardin en el centro del restaurante donde puedes comer, cenar o tomar un aperitivo. Es un lugar con encanto. Hay que reservar.",4,2017,05,24
34,"Eccellente, davvero non si può chiedere di più","Ho passato solo una notte in questo hotel ed è stata in assoluto la migliore in tanti anni. The Wittmore è un posto magico dove ogni dettaglio è importante e dove il cliente non è un cliente, ma un ospite di riguardo, e come tale viene trattato e coccolato con mille attenzioni da un personale davvero eccezionale. Certo, non è facilissimo da trovare: è in un vicolo tra i vicoli del barrio Gotico, ma guardando una mappa ci si arriva con facilità da una traversa di via Laietana. E il contrasto tra i vicoli e l'eleganza quasi austera dell'hotel è la prima sorpresa.
Per il resto è un perfetto boutique hotel: luci basse, spessi tendaggi di velluto, moquette. Un'oasi di pace nel caos della città. Dunque non è un hotel per famiglie. Le camere si affacciano su un bellissimo cortile interno con una parete vegetale e fiorita in uso al delizioso ristorante Witty. Il bagno, in perfetto stile retrò inglese, è equipaggiato di tutto quello che potrebbe servirvi, ma, magari, avete dimenticato a casa: dal filo interdentale al pettine. Gli accappatoi di spugna dentro e cotone fuori sono i migliori mai trovati in circolazione. E poi, sottolineo ancora, la cura del dettaglio che fa la differenza: al mio arrivo ho trovato un tavolino apparecchiato in camera, una  tortina con candelina e un biglietto scritto a mano in cui mi si ringraziava per aver scelto di soggiornare presso l'hotel nel giorno del mio compleanno e mi si augurava un felice soggiorno. Se ci fossero 8 stelle gliele darei. Davvero, non si può chiedere di più. Grazie a tutto lo staff per il felicissimo compleanno al The Wittmore. See you soon.",5,2017,05,21
34,Edel,"Edles Hotel, versteckt in Seitengasse, nicht zu erkennen... 
eher dunkel, schummrig aber mit Style... Rooftop mit Bar bietet sensationelle Sicht. 
Das Zimmer ist ebenfalls sehr edel und klassisch hergerichtet. 
Für verliebte Paare ein absoluter Tip",5,2017,05,15
34,"Top Lage, nette Location mit kleinen Abstrichen",Die Lage des Hotels in der Altstadt ist top. Mitten im Leben aber denn noch ruhig. Service sehr aufmerksam und zuvorkommend. Qualität der Speisen und Getränke ebenfalls sehr gut. Pool auf dem Dach ist eher ein kleines Becken zum Abkühlen... aber wirkliche nette Roof top Bar. Zimmer etwas klein und für meinen Geschmack etwas dunkel. Es fehlen ein paar Möglichkeiten zum Abstellen (Koffer) und Aufhängen der Kleidung. Bad war sehr schön und groß. Insgesamt ist das Wittmore mit kleinen Abstrichen sehr zu empfehlen - mal was anderes und ein bisschen besonders. ,4,2017,05,01
34,Un Hotel neoyorquino en pleno barrio gótico Barcelonés,Fin de semana con mi mujer y amigos en Barcelona. Un lujo de 5 estrellas GL en pleno Barcelona a pocos metros del puerto. Una maravilla muy recomendable. Excelente brunch el domingo. Muy cómodo. céntrico y con mucho encanto.,5,2017,03,07
34,"Acojedor, romántico, relajante... de lujo!","Exactamente lo que queríamos para un fin de semana romántico con mi pareja. Es muy inglés, sí, y si no te gusta la moqueta o el toque British, no te quedes. A nosotros nos encantó, desde la atención en recepción, el desayuno de gran calidad, el mobiliario con toque vintage y de diseño, las toiletries del wc de lujo, osea que espero volver muy pronto!",5,2017,03,03
34,Pequeño lujo,"El Wittmore es un hotel encantador, el restaurante es genial, el servicio, la comida, la decoración, los cocteles, todo en el hotel es fantástico. Es ideal para una celebración especial con la pareja.",5,2017,02,20
34,"Ubicazione infelice e scarsa illuminazione, altrimenti ok!","Boutique hotel di recente apertura nel quartiere gotico: Difficilissimo da trovare anche per i tassisti con navigatore..Abbiamo dovuto percorrere  a piedi gli ultimi due o trecento metri ...cosa che con valigie e la pioggia non è stata proprio entusiasmante.. 
Nell'insieme non male...Un gusto old England..nel decoro anche delle stanze che non sono molto spaziose, ( per fortuna abbiamo avuto un upgrading gratuito perché la stanza assegnataci all'arrivo era veramente troppo piccola ..Impossibile trovare uno spazio per i bagagli)  Unica nota veramente negativa è la luminosità scarsissima...che non giova certo a rallegrare l'atmosfera un po' da famiglia Addams... il ristorante del hotel non è male  anche se non a buon mercato, ma ha una capace e simpatica cameriera Italiana ed è stato soprattutto comodo permettendoci di non dover uscire visto la pioggia che imperversava.",3,2017,01,30
34,Hotel precioso y muy buen trato.,"Me sorprendió la decoración de este hotel, es precioso.
Se nota que hace poco que está abierto y todo está super nuevo.
Solo un pequeño pero, la iluminación en la habitación es muy escasa.
Repetiremos.",5,2017,01,23
34,Roast Beef,"Un lugar de ambiente british donde se ofrece una carta de cocinas diversas , desde unas croquetas a un ceviche , pasando por un Club Sandwich o una ensalada Waldorf. El Roast Beef estupendo.
Siendo un restaurante de hotel es una alternativa interesante y original.",4,2016,12,24
34,DECORACIÓN EXQUISITA,"Hotel exclusivo situado en un lugar emblemático de Barcelona.
Las vistas desde su ático son perfectas para divisar la ciudad y relajarse en un lugar cool con aire internacional.

El patio interior, las sesiones de jazz, su chimenea, biblioteca y decoración hacen de este HOTEL un lugar diferente en dónde cabe destacar el trato de las personas que trabajan aquí.

Sin duda repetiré.

Las habitaciones muy bien cuidadas en todos sus detalles.
Y también recomiendo subir a disfrutar del espacio que hay en la terraza del hotel.",5,2016,11,14

34,Hotel de lujo en uno de los mejores rincones de Barcelona,"5* entre las calles más emblematicas de la ciudad condal. Tranquilidad, lujo, elegancia, silencio...

La Plaça Reial... Tiendas, copas, baile...",5,2016,07,21
34,Charming Hotel in the Old City of Barcelona,"Idealer Standort in der Altstadt. Individueller Service, den man in großen Hotelketten vergebens sucht. Wir besuchten die ""Soul und Funk Night"" mit Désiree Diouf. Sowohl Live Music als auch Dinner excellent. Super Service an der Rezeption, man fühlte sich willkommen und umsorgt. Service im Restaurant überdurchschnittlich. Auch sionst, bis zum Pagen, vorbildlich. Gerne wieder!",5,2016,07,04
34,"Lugar excelente, muy bien ubicado y con todo lo que debe tener un lugar que se respete a sí mismo","Lo expresado anteriormente como excelente lugar, bien ubicado, buenas habitaciones , etc, sería insuficiente sino se complementa con la principal virtud de este lugar encantador y me refiero a las personas que allí realizan su trabajo, desde la bella joven italiana que trabaja en el bar, el chico que sirve el desayuno, los recepcionistas, el bartender que me preparó un coctel con Havana 7 con magia y misterios que lo hicieron inolvidable, tambien su joven Directora y  el super atento propietario del Hotel. Tal pareciera que el único objetivo de sus vidas es que te sientas bien, con un trato personalizado y una profesionalidad de altos kilates.

En resumen si quieres sentirte un cliente importante, no lo dudes cuando vayas a Barcelona el Wittmore Hotel es el lugar indicado.

No tengo dudas, este joven hotel dentro de muy poco tiempo será un lugar que siempre estará a full.

34,Un Diamante 5* en Barcelona,"Un amigo me recomendó este nuevo Hotel en el barrio gótico de Barcelona. es un Hotelito pequeño, parece casi un club privado inglés. Fui con mi mujer y la verdad es que quedamos encantados. Se que en cuando empiece a conocerse va a ser casi imposible poder reservar. Son unas 25 habitaciones, por lo que el servicio y la atención al cliente es sublime. La verdad es que me ha gustado muchísimo, y siempre que pueda voy a volver allí. El bar es precioso y respira clase por los cuatro costados. Puedo decir sin ninguna duda que es uno de los hoteles boutique más elegante en los que he estado. Para mí se merece un 10. Es un hotel mucho más exclusivo que cualquiera que los que conozco en Barcelona de 5*. Realmente te sientes un privilegiado cuando entras en el hotel. Super aconsejable!!!",5,2016,06,28
34,impresionante hotel de lujo en pleno centro de barcelona!,"recién inaugurado, en pleno centro de Barcelona (barrio gotico). situado en la zona baja de barrio gotico por lo que es muy cómodo para poder llegar a la zona de la Barceloneta y el barrio de moda del borne. Para llegar lo mejor es taxi y que te deje cerca de correos y andar dos minutos (ya que la calle es peatonal) o bajarse en la parada de metro de Jaume I (línea amarilla) y hay que andar unos 5-10 minutos. Esta increíblemente ambientado en los años 50, un restaurante precioso y un ático-terraza con una pequeña piscina y hamacas. La habitación espectacular, con todo lujo de detalles, el baño espacioso y mucha luz. La habitación con una cama increíblemente cómoda, se dormía como entre algodones.  Y sobre todo destacar la amabilidad de todo el personal, cuando llegamos a la noche nos habían colocado un botellín de agua a cada persona, las zapatillas cerquita de la cama... y un sin fin de detalles! si lo que quieres es un hotel de lujo con una decoración con gusto y en pleno centro no dudes en elegir este hotelazo! de diez!",5,2016,05,23
